			<head>MOVING TOWARDS A MORE DYNAMIC BUSINESS SECTOR IN SPAIN<lb/> By Alberto Gonzalez Pandiella 1<lb/></head>

			<p>Policy efforts to revitalise entrepreneurship and investment in Spain are of paramount importance to<lb/> absorb people and capital that have become idle during the crisis. Boosting economic growth requires a<lb/> new generation of high-growth companies to invest in more productive activities where labour could be<lb/> reallocated. Resources should flow to the most productive firms at the expense of the least productive ones,<lb/> which had not been the case in the years prior to the crisis. Lifting the performance of the Spanish business<lb/> sector requires meeting three inter-related challenges: reducing barriers to firm start-up and growth;<lb/> increasing exporting and innovation; and boosting competition. Additional constraints created by the crisis<lb/> should also be removed by rehabilitating highly indebted viable firms and facilitating the exit of the non-<lb/>viable ones, while improving access to credit and capital. The government reform programme already<lb/> underway in these areas should be deepened along these lines.<lb/></p>

			<head>Key challenges affecting the Spanish business sector<lb/> Resources need to be reallocated to the most productive firms<lb/></head>

			<p>An extensive literature has highlighted the important role of reallocation of resources across firms,<lb/> even within narrowly defined sectors, for overall productivity growth (<ref type="biblio">Arnold et al., 2008; Foster et al.,<lb/> 2002; Hsieh and Klenow, 2009</ref>). Firm-level evidence suggests that Spain has lacked flexibility to<lb/> re-allocate resources to more dynamic and productive firms (<ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>). In Spain, firms with low<lb/> productivity had stronger employment growth than others before the crisis. This contrasts with United<lb/> Kingdom, Italy and France that show a strong positive association between productivity and employment<lb/> growth. Productivity differentials between Spain and other high-income OECD economies cannot be fully<lb/> explained by the shift of resources towards the construction sector in the boom years (Mora-<ref type="biblio">Sanguinetti<lb/> and Fuentes, 2012</ref>), but result from a lack of flexibility preventing resources from being efficiently<lb/> reallocated (<ref type="biblio">Crespo Rodríguez et al., 2012</ref>).<lb/> 1.<lb/> Alberto González Pandiella is Economist in the Spain/Ireland desk in the Country Studies Branch of the<lb/> Economics Department of the OECD, contact email: alberto.gonzalezpandiella@oecd.org. This paper was<lb/> prepared for the OECD Economic Survey of Spain published in September 2014 under the authority of the<lb/> Economic and Development Review Committee. The author would like to thank to Pierre Beynet, David<lb/> Haugh, Alvaro Pereira, Robert Ford, Dirk Pilat and Spanish government officials for their valuable comments<lb/> and suggestions. Special thanks are due to Desney Erb for statistical assistance and Dacil Kurzweg for<lb/> technical preparation.<lb/> Figure 1.

			<p>The bars represent quartiles of firms within an industry ordered by productivity levels relative to the industry<lb/> average. The height of the bars measures annual employment growth, relative to the average of the country and sector. A bar higher<lb/> than zero means that employment growth in a set of firms was above average.<lb/></p>

			<p>Implementing reforms that raise the productivity of existing firms, while at the same time fostering<lb/> the flexibility needed for resource reallocation, will be one of the principal policy challenges for ensuring<lb/> strong growth in the future. An environment that promotes reallocation and entrepreneurial risk-taking can<lb/> also encourage innovative activity and investment in knowledge-based capital, which are associated with<lb/> productivity improvements (OECD, 2013a; <ref type="biblio">Andrews and Criscuolo, 2013</ref>). Structural policies can<lb/> influence the ease with which such re-allocations occur (<ref type="biblio">Andrews and Cingano, 2012</ref>). For example,<lb/> administrative burdens can hamper firm entry, thresholds built into tax or labour codes can create<lb/> disincentives for firms to grow beyond a certain size and credit markets may unduly favour incumbents at a<lb/> time of crisis.<lb/></p>

			<head>Barriers to firm start-up and growth are too high<lb/></head>

			<p>Regulatory barriers to firm start-up, growth and exit discussed below have resulted in a business<lb/> sector with many low productivity micro enterprises and too few medium and larger firms (<ref type="figure">Figures 2<lb/> and 2.3</ref>). These features can be observed both in the manufacturing and services sectors and have remained<lb/> unchanged over time. This dual distribution has serious implications for aggregate job growth, productivity<lb/> and employment quality because, as elsewhere, larger firms have higher productivity. Spain, together with<lb/> Italy, has more firms per unit of gross domestic product (GDP) than any other major European economy<lb/> (OECD, 2013b), signalling that the business sector is fragmented. Spanish dual firm distribution is more<lb/> similar to the one observed in developing countries, where many low-productivity locally focused micro<lb/> firms coexist with a few large export-oriented multinationals, than with the one observed in other advanced<lb/> economies.<lb/></p>

			<p>Barriers to start-ups have also resulted in low birth rates of firms and particularly of young high<lb/> growth firms (<ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>). Spain also has one of the lowest early stage entrepreneurship rates, a measure of<lb/> start-up activity (<ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref>). This is a crucial impediment to aggregate economic performance and job<lb/> creation. New enterprises yield a competitive pressure on incumbent companies, improving resource<lb/> allocation by forcing inefficient firms out of the market. New start-ups also exploit knowledge unused or<lb/> under-used by existing companies, drawing on knowledge spillovers to enter new and established markets<lb/> (<ref type="biblio">Acs et al., 2009</ref>). High start-up rates are strongly associated with high economic growth and job creation<lb/> (<ref type="biblio">Acs et al., 2006; Stangler and Litan, 2009</ref>). Net job-creation tends to be concentrated in few fast–growing<lb/></p>

			<p>Empirical evidence confirms this. Spanish young firms have a significantly higher contribution to<lb/> employment creation than older businesses. Indeed, the more favourable job-creation behaviour of young<lb/> firms with respect to mature firms is relatively more marked in Spain than in other economies (<ref type="biblio">Criscoulo<lb/> et al., 2014</ref>). Over 50% of new jobs in Spain between 2001 and 2011 were due to young firms, though such<lb/> firms accounted for only about 20% of total employment. Start-ups tend to be smaller in Spain than in<lb/> other countries, and they do not appear to grow much over time, both in manufacturing and services<lb/> (<ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref>). This suggests that the high proportion of small firms and the low presence of larger businesses<lb/> in Spain might be reflecting two different features: start-ups are often small and there is a large share of<lb/> more mature businesses that do not grow.<lb/></p>

			<p>Spain displays relatively high rates of self-employment (<ref type="figure">Figure 7</ref>). On the positive side, this can be a<lb/> signal of entrepreneurism. However, it can also be a sign that employers prefer to hire workers as<lb/> independent contractors to benefit from lower social security contributions, which could increase the<lb/> duality of the labour market and reduce labour skills. It could also indicate that the economy is not creating<lb/> enough opportunities in the formal labour market. Indeed, a higher incidence of self-employment tends to<lb/> be related to the size of the informal economy, which in Spain is estimated to be around 22% of GDP<lb/> (<ref type="biblio">Schneider et al., 2010</ref>), above the OECD average. On the one hand, the fall in construction activity, which<lb/> tends to have a high incidence of informality, would have contributed to reduced informality. On the other<lb/> hand, the recession reduced business and job opportunities in the formal economy and may have increased<lb/> incentives for entrepreneurs and workers to move to the informal economy. Informality may be a source of<lb/> jobs and livelihood in the short-term, but it hampers growth, job quality and productivity in the medium-<lb/>term. Informal enterprises have an incentive not to grow to escape from tax authorities and there is a<lb/> positive relationship between the size of the informal economy and the size of the micro-enterprise sector<lb/> (OECD, 2013b). Informal firms also tend not to invest in modernising production. This translates into low<lb/> productivity per worker and hence low wages. Moreover, the informal sector does not proportionally<lb/> contribute to the financing of public services and infrastructure and acts as unfair competition to compliant<lb/> firms.<lb/></p>

			<head>Internationalisation and innovation are low<lb/></head>

			<p>Along with the collapse of the construction sector (and to a lesser extent the downsizing of the<lb/> financial sector), the recovery of cost-competitiveness has allowed Spain to initiate a re-orientation of its<lb/> productive system towards exporting sectors. The weight of exports in GDP has considerably increased,<lb/> although it remains far below the euro area (<ref type="figure">Figure 8</ref>). It is essential that the Spanish business sector&apos;s<lb/> efforts to internationalise its activities continue and extend.<lb/></p>

			<p>Increasing further internationalisation would render positive effects on multiple fronts, since the<lb/> performance of manufacturing exporting firms is significantly better than that of non-exporting firms<lb/> (<ref type="table">Table 2</ref>.1). They are substantially larger, have higher real productivity and physical capital stock per<lb/> employee, rely more on skilled labour and are more likely to invest in research and development (R&amp;D)<lb/></p>

			<p>Increasing business innovation rates would also boost the number of exporting firms as innovative<lb/> firms also tend to export more. It is also crucial for boosting business sector productivity in the medium-<lb/>run. Business R&amp;D was 0.7% of GDP in 2010, far below OECD (1.6%) and European Union (EU, 1.2%)<lb/> averages. Around 50% of R&amp;D is undertaken by large firms. This is one of the lowest percentages in the<lb/> OECD and it couples with one of the most generous R&amp;D tax credit schemes. The proportion of small and<lb/> medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) that innovate is also well below OECD average (<ref type="figure">Figure 9</ref>). Few SMEs<lb/> undertake new marketing, organisational methods or make product or process innovations. Around 80% of<lb/> large companies do some kind of innovation, but this is again below rates observed in most OECD<lb/> innovative countries. The government should deepen its efforts to expand the innovation system and<lb/> encourage greater spillovers to the business sector (<ref type="biblio">Haugh and Westmore, 2014</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<head>Competition and cost-competitiveness need boosting<lb/></head>

			<p>Increasing competition across the Spanish economy, and particularly in network and professional<lb/> services sectors that all firms rely on, is crucial for cost-competitiveness. Spain has undertaken several<lb/> recent reforms to foster competition in goods and services markets. Prior to the recession profit margins<lb/> grew faster than in other euro area countries. Profit margins have moderated since the recession but remain<lb/> higher than in other euro area countries (<ref type="table">Table 2</ref>.2). High margins reflect the need for firms to rebuild their<lb/> finances in the context of tight credit conditions, but it also signals weaknesses in effective competition in<lb/> some markets (<ref type="biblio">Montero and Urtasun, 2014; Banco de España, 2014</ref>). As the recovery strengthens and<lb/> external financing becomes available at lower cost, it is essential to continue to foster competition in goods<lb/> and services markets to consolidate and reinforce competitiveness gains and to maximise the impact of<lb/> other reforms, such as those in the labour market, on job creation.<lb/></p>

Increases in wages, profit margins and taxes contribute to higher price increases, while<lb/> higher productivity helps to reduce prices. For example, in the period 1999-2008 the GDP deflator increased by 3.7 percentage points<lb/> in Spain. Most of the increase was due to increases in wages and profit margins. A small part of the increase was due to increases in<lb/> taxes, while productivity had no impact.<lb/></table>

			<head>Debt remains high and financing conditions are tight<lb/></head>

			<p>The Spanish business sector is weighed down by a large share of highly indebted firms by<lb/> international standards. At least one third of listed firms have a debt to EBITDA (earnings before interest,<lb/> taxes, depreciation and amortisation) ratio of over four (<ref type="figure">Figure 10</ref>). There are substantial differences across<lb/> sectors and also depending on firm size (<ref type="figure">Figure 11</ref>). The level of indebtedness, defined as debt over total<lb/> net assets, for small and medium-sized companies is significantly lower than for large companies (although<lb/> it should be noted that the coverage of small firms in the sample is very reduced). In the large corporate<lb/> sector the strongest deleveraging has taken place in information and technology companies, while large<lb/> construction firm&apos;s indebtedness kept increasing until 2011, following valuation corrections that translated<lb/> into lower asset values. Large companies in all sectors considered have debt-to-assets ratios above 45%,<lb/> while the ratio is above 35% for medium-sized firms.<lb/></p>

			<p>These high levels of debt are holding back businesses, as excessively indebted firms are unlikely to<lb/> invest and hire and if they ultimately prove unviable are using capital that could be reallocated to better<lb/> performing firms. The government has made significant efforts to improve the debt restructuring and<lb/> insolvency framework to help rehabilitate these firms and close down unviable ones. However, further<lb/> efforts are required to quickly unburden the business sector, and by doing so indirectly the banking sector,<lb/> otherwise the recovery is likely to remain very slow.<lb/></p>

			<p>At the same time the cost of borrowing remains high. Conditions are especially tight for smaller loans,<lb/> predominately used by SMEs (<ref type="figure">Figure 12</ref>). SMEs are particularly vulnerable to banking sector stress (<ref type="biblio">Ryan<lb/> et al., 2014</ref>), as they have more difficulties in establishing new banking relationships and they tend to use<lb/> real-estate assets as collateral. In addition, alternatives to non-bank financing have been so far very limited.<lb/></p>

			<head>Improving the regulatory framework to favour business dynamism and growth<lb/> Favouring business start-ups<lb/></head>

			<p>Fostering a dynamic and high performing business sector is complex and requires a broad<lb/> combination of policies. Particularly important is the interaction between product and labour market<lb/> policies. In Spain labour market policies that have resulted in dualism and precarious employment (<ref type="biblio">Haugh<lb/> and Westmore, 2014</ref>) are reinforced by product, service and financial market regulation that have favoured<lb/> incumbents and left capital in unviable firms for too long. Broad reform of product, tax, insolvency and<lb/> financial market policies is required to reduce barriers to firm entry and to spur reallocation of resources<lb/> towards a new cohort of more productive, innovative, export intensive and quality-job rich enterprises.<lb/></p>

			<p>Spain has been making good progress in improving measured product market regulations and<lb/> converging towards best practices in the areas of state control and barriers to trade and investment.<lb/> However, progress has been more muted in reducing barriers to entrepreneurship (<ref type="figure">Figure 13</ref>, Panel A).<lb/></p>

			<p>Starting a business is perceived to be far more difficult in Spain than in other advanced economies.<lb/> Spain has the second highest barriers to entrepreneurship in the OECD (OECD, 2013c). Spain also ranks<lb/> 142nd (out of 185) with respect to ease to start a business (World Bank and IFC, 2014). The regulatory<lb/> procedures have been too complex so far, especially the licences and permits system. Obtaining licences<lb/> and permits is more difficult in Spain than in most OECD countries (<ref type="figure">Figure 13</ref>, Panel B). Contrary to best<lb/> practices there are no standard procedures to use the &quot; silence is consent &quot; rule for issuing the licences<lb/> required to open up a business. And there are not yet single contact points for issuing or accepting all<lb/> notifications and licenses that are required to open up a private limited company. With the aim of<lb/> addressing this, the entrepreneurship law</p>

			<table>(law 14/2013) foresees the creation of the so-called<lb/> &quot; Entrepreneur support points &quot; (Puntos de Atención al Emprendedor) network.<lb/> Crucially, firms have not been operating in a single market in Spain but rather have had to face the<lb/> inconveniences of a regulatory framework, which is regionally and locally fragmented.

Barriers to entrepreneurship, 2013<lb/> ECO/WKP(2014)69<lb/> operate in multiple regions of Spain has been in many cases required to obtain a separate licence or permit<lb/> for their activity from the different regions where they wish to conduct business. In addition, often<lb/> requirements have differed, forcing higher costs on firms who have to adapt products to local requirements<lb/> (for example in labelling).<lb/></table>

			<p>To tackle this and move towards a truly single market the government has introduced the Market<lb/> Unity Law. This law is a flagship reform and, if fully implemented, has the potential to revolutionise doing<lb/> business in Spain. It aims at simplifying business licensing requirements, by increasing the use of<lb/> notification procedures (with ex post controls) and reducing the need for prior authorisations to exert<lb/> economic activities. It also aims at ensuring that permits issued in one region will automatically be valid<lb/> for the others. Thus, it has the potential to improve substantially the regulatory framework, foster<lb/> competition and eliminate barriers preventing firms from taking advantage of economies of scale. The law<lb/> is inspired by the EU Services Directive, but it is broader in scope. It provides for principles of free<lb/> establishment and movement of goods and services in Spain and for their application in practice.<lb/></p>

			<p>According to the law, all legal texts enacted at local, regional and central government level that may<lb/> be considered inconsistent with the market unity will have to be amended in the following six months. So<lb/> far 2 700 regulatory barriers, most at the regional level, have been identified as inconsistent with the<lb/> market unity. This process is to be supported by enhancing administrative cooperation, and by setting up a<lb/> procedure for responding quickly to complaints about obstacles to the single market. Spain&apos;s Competition<lb/> Authority has been granted power to file administrative appeals with regard to situations contrary to the<lb/> law. Legislative amendments will be discussed by regional and central government representatives in<lb/> sectoral conferences. The law also entails measurement and monitoring procedures, which should help to<lb/> assess implementation progress. These procedures include the elaboration of a directory of good and bad<lb/> practices and the publication of regulatory quality indicators. A swift implementation of the law, while<lb/> challenging both technically, due to the complexity of dealing with a large body of regulation, and<lb/> politically, due to resistance by some regions, will be crucial to boost the performance of the Spanish<lb/> business sector. Effective coordination and cooperation among the different levels of government will be<lb/> critical, in particular when it comes to amending sector specific legislation.<lb/></p>

			<p>Besides the law on market unity, another on-going initiative to improve business climate is Emprende<lb/> en tres, an electronic one-stop-shop designed to present declarations of responsibility required for<lb/> entrepreneurs to start up a new economic activity, and a reduced tax rate for new corporate starts-up<lb/> introduced in 2013. The rate is 15% for new companies. Spain also foresees conducting annual reviews of<lb/> the business regulatory framework to detect and remove obstacles hampering entrepreneurship, investment<lb/> and business activities. This initiative is conducted by the Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness with<lb/> the collaboration of ICEX (Spanish Export Agency) and Invest in Spain (the Spanish body in charge of<lb/> public relations with foreign investors). First meetings with representatives of several industrial and<lb/> services sectors, academics and research services are already taking place. In addition, the World Bank will<lb/> undertake a subnational Doing Business study in Spain during 2014 and 2015, with the aim of identifying<lb/> regulatory best practices among Spanish regions and spurring regulatory improvement.<lb/></p>

			<p>The law on Environmental Assessment 21/2013 also advocates for further standardising the<lb/> legislation across Spain in the area of environmental assessment procedures, seeking greater collaboration<lb/> and harmonisation across regions.<lb/></p>

			<head>Favouring firms&apos; growth<lb/></head>

			<p>Spanish business framework conditions include multiple size-dependent regulations, originally aimed<lb/> at supporting SMEs. One of them is the corporate tax that has special clauses depending on firm sizes both<lb/> in terms of turnover and number of employees. The standard corporate tax rate is 30%. The corporate rate<lb/> for SMEs – defined for the tax as firms with an annual turnover below EUR 10 million – is 25% on profits<lb/> up to EUR 300 000 and 30% above that. The rate is further reduced to 20% for SMEs with net revenues<lb/> below EUR 5 million and fewer than 25 employees who have not decreased the number of workers they<lb/> employ. Despite all these preferential rates for SMEs, larger firms are capable of optimising existing<lb/> deductions, resulting in differences between statutory rates and effective rates that widen as turnover<lb/> increases. The current configuration of the tax also implies differences in effective rates within the SME<lb/> segment depending on the number of employees that the firms employ (<ref type="figure">Figure 14</ref>). The effective rate is<lb/> highest for medium-sized enterprises having between 100 and 250 employees. This creates incentives for<lb/> firms to remain small ( &quot; lock-in &quot; effect), which has serious implications for aggregate productivity given<lb/> the higher productivity that generally prevails in larger enterprises. All this indicates that the tax is not<lb/> successful in supporting SMEs and may be penalising medium-size firms and biasing firm&apos;s distributions<lb/> towards smallest sizes, to the detriment of medium-sized. Reducing tax deductions would decrease the<lb/> capacity of larger firms to avoid taxation. Using that fiscal space to establish a unique and lower corporate<lb/> tax rate for all firms would provide better incentives for firm&apos;s growth and would also align corporate<lb/> taxation with the OECD average (25.3% in 2013, <ref type="figure">Figure 15</ref>), which would contribute to attracting<lb/> investment. In this sense, the government announced in June 2014 a draft tax reform, which proposes<lb/> broadening the base, reducing tax credits, reducing the standard tax rate to 25% by 2016 and suppressing<lb/> the preferential rate for SMEs. The reduced rate for starts-up, introduced in 2013, is maintained.<lb/></p>

			<figure>Source: OECD (2014), OECD Tax Database, www.oecd.org/tax/tax-policy/tax-database.htm.<lb/></figure>

			<p>Other size-dependant fiscal regulations, such as different levels of tax enforcement, also affect the<lb/> size distribution (<ref type="biblio">Almunia and López, 2013</ref>). Firms with more than EUR 6 million in reported revenue are<lb/> monitored by the large taxpayers&apos; unit, which involves more frequent tax audits and more information<lb/> requirements. The effect of this kind of threshold on firm behaviour is strong. There is excess mass of<lb/> firms, or &quot; bunches &quot; , just below the revenue threshold and there is evidence that firms have deliberately<lb/> reduced reported revenue by up to 7.5% to avoid falling in the high enforcement regime. There is also<lb/> evidence that firms locating below the threshold misreport their material and labour input costs to evade<lb/> taxes.<lb/></p>

			<p>There are also size-contingent regulations in the labour market that start to bind at different firm sizes.<lb/> They relate to different workers representation obligations, the availability of special employment contracts<lb/> (e.g. Contrato de emprendedores), social security contributions deductions and flexibility to change or<lb/> terminate employment contracts (<ref type="table">Table 2</ref>.3). Risk prevention obligations also differ depending on the size<lb/> of the company. Companies above 250 employees need to elaborate, negotiate and apply an equality plan.<lb/> All these size-dependent regulations start biting at different sizes. This prevents a marked &quot; cliff &quot; effect as<lb/> in France at 50 employees (<ref type="biblio">Garicano et al., 2012</ref>) but it compounds a complex system difficult and costly<lb/> to navigate.<lb/></p>

			<p>The &quot; plus &quot; sign indicates when more demanding regulatory requirements kick in. The &quot; minus &quot; sign indicates at which size<lb/> special conditions, such as fiscal incentives, are no longer available. For example, regulations on workers representation start<lb/> operating when firms have six employees; when they reach 9-10 employees there are additional requirements and yet more<lb/> kick in if the firm reaches 30 employees. As concerns hiring regulations, there is a special contract modality (Contrato de<lb/> emprendedores), offering an extended trial period of one year and several hiring incentives and fiscal rebates. That contract<lb/> modality is only available for firms with less than 50 employees.<lb/></p>

			<p>Size-dependent policies should be carefully designed to avoid they become unintended barriers to<lb/> firm growth. In general, the emphasis should be on ensuring that policies support the specific needs of<lb/> SMEs (for example providing direct innovation support, as young SMEs may not have the profits to claim<lb/> R&amp;D tax credits), rather than progressively tightening regulatory requirements with size, as is currently the<lb/> case in Spain. When designing support policies, their potential effect on firms&apos; growth dynamics should be<lb/> explicitly recognised and examined, with the aim of minimising distortions and potential &quot; lock-in &quot; effects.<lb/></p>

			<p>In general, business regulations de jure or de facto tend to be more detrimental for medium-sized<lb/> companies than for large or small companies. It is easier to ignore regulations when businesses are small.<lb/> Large companies have more legal and administrative resources that enable them to legally optimise and<lb/> exploit existing regulations. Medium-size companies neither can ignore regulations nor have resources to<lb/> deal efficiently with them.<lb/></p>

			<head>Increasing and deepening internationalisation<lb/> Export performance has been mixed<lb/></head>

			<p>The Spanish external sector has led the recovery and export performance has been better in Spain than<lb/> in other European economies (<ref type="figure">Figure 16</ref>). Both goods and services explain this performance. On the back<lb/> of improving cost-competitiveness and the need to search for new markets given the weakness in domestic<lb/> demand, goods exports have increased across most product categories. Additionally, services exports,<lb/> notably tourism, have also grown steadily since 2008. To further lift exports Spain faces four main<lb/> challenges: increasing the number of regular exporters; up-grading the technological content of exports;<lb/> diversifying trading partners; and ensuring that the business environment is favourable for both goods and<lb/> services exports.<lb/></p>

			<p>The export base has widened with an increasing number of firms becoming exporters (<ref type="figure">Figure 17</ref>,<lb/> Panel A). Both the number of firms regularly exporting and the number of firms exporting above<lb/> EUR 50 000 have remained constant though. Consequently exports are becoming increasingly<lb/> concentrated in a few firms (<ref type="figure">Figure 17</ref>, Panel B): the top 25 exporters accounted for more than 25% of all<lb/> exports in 2013; the top 100 exporters account for nearly 40% of exports.<lb/></p>

			<figure>Figure 17.

			<p>Export performance is influenced not only by changes in price and non-price-competitiveness, but<lb/> also by the composition of exports, whether in terms of geographical destination or of type of product.

			<p>strong, exports will increase even if competitiveness does not improve. A constant market share analysis<lb/> (CMSA) can help to disentangle and measure these factors (<ref type="biblio">González Pandiella, 2014</ref>).The basic idea<lb/> underpinning this analysis is that changes in exports are due either to changes in individual market shares<lb/> or to a specialisation in particularly dynamic markets or industries. A CMSA decomposes the difference<lb/> between the growth of Spanish manufacturing exports and the growth of total exports of the rest of the<lb/> world in two factors (Annex 2.A1). On one hand, the so-called market share effect captures the gain or loss<lb/> in shares that would occur if the export structure, whether in geographical or sectoral terms, were to remain<lb/> unchanged. It seeks to capture the extent to which changes in shares have been due to changes in price and<lb/> non-price competitiveness. On the other hand, the structure effect quantifies the extent to which the<lb/> country is benefiting from an advantageous position in terms of the composition of its exports. In turn, the<lb/> structural effect can be divided into a product effect, a geographical effect and a mixed effect. The first two<lb/> show the gain in share arising, respectively, from exporting products and from exporting towards regions<lb/> where demand has been more dynamic. The mixed effect captures the interaction of both effects, given the<lb/> impossibility of distinguishing perfectly between them.<lb/></p>

			<p>The CMSA signals that, in the more recent periods, changes in market shares have been the main<lb/> driving force behind Spanish manufacturing export performance (<ref type="figure">Figure 18</ref>,</p>

			<figure>Panel A). The negative total<lb/> effect indicates that Spanish exports grew less than world exports from 2003 to 2011, except in 2007. The<lb/> main contributor was the market share effect, indicating that the below-average growth of exports was due<lb/> to losses of competitiveness. However, a cross-country comparison reveals that losses of market shares<lb/> were less pronounced in Spain than in other European advanced economies (Figure 19, Panel A), including<lb/> Germany. Gains in competitiveness started to pay off in 2012 when Spanish goods exports grew above<lb/> world exports.<lb/> Figure 18. Main results of a constant market share analysis<lb/></figure>

			<head>How to read this figure:</head>

			<p>Total effect is the difference between the growth rates of Spanish exports and of world exports. The market<lb/> effect aggregates the variation of shares in individual export markets. The combined structure effect can be decomposed into product<lb/> and geographical structure effect plus a residual term (so-called mixed effect). Product and geographical effects are positive if a<lb/> country has above average specialisation in markets that grow faster than overall world trade. Conversely, high specialisation in slow-<lb/>growing markets gives rise to negative structure effects.<lb/></p>

			<p>The CMSA also highlights that Spanish export performance could have been even better if industry<lb/> and market specialisation were more geared towards more dynamic segments. For example the<lb/> contribution of the product structure to export performance has remained broadly unchanged over time<lb/> (<ref type="figure">Figure 19</ref>, Panel B). By contrast, Germany&apos;s evolution of product specialisation has been more favourable<lb/> to its export performance, reflecting a higher specialisation in products experiencing higher growth such as<lb/> medium to high technology products. Italy, had a similar evolution in product structure as Spain until 2006,<lb/> and has also recently improved the contribution of product specialisation to export performance by shifting<lb/> its sectoral export structure towards more dynamic products.<lb/> This highlights one of the main weaknesses of the Spanish external sector. Despite recent progress,<lb/> the product structure has remained broadly unchanged in Spain during the last ten years (<ref type="figure">Figure 20</ref>). Low-<lb/>technology exports have increased slightly even though this is an export segment that has grown below<lb/> average in world trade. The share of motor vehicles and components in total exports has fallen but this<lb/> remains a key sector in Spanish exports.

			<p>Spain&apos;s mix of trading partners has not been conducive to better goods export performance either<lb/> (<ref type="figure">Figure 19</ref>, Panel C). This reflects an over-specialisation in European markets that have grown below<lb/> average, such as France, Italy and Portugal. Around 63% of exports are destined for the European Union.<lb/> At the same time there is an under-specialisation in more dynamic markets, such as China and other Asian<lb/> economies. Exports to markets such as China and other emerging economies have recently increased, but<lb/> by less than world exports to those destinations.<lb/> Internationalisation policy needs to take also strong account of the services sector. Services account<lb/> for an increasing share of Spanish total exports and have significantly contributed to the rebalancing of the<lb/> Spanish economy and the return of the current account balance to positive territory. Most services<lb/> categories have grown since 2007, the exception is financial services. In terms of product composition,<lb/> tourism and travel account for more than 40% of total exports (<ref type="figure">Figure 21</ref>, Panel A). Geographically, as in<lb/> manufacturing goods, nearly 70% of export services are destined for the European Union (<ref type="figure">Figure 21</ref>, Panel<lb/> B). As in goods, Spain faces the challenge of increasing penetration of its services exports into non-<lb/>European markets and widening its product specialisation beyond labour-intensive services.<lb/></p>

			<head>Policies to improve export performance<lb/></head>

			<p>A broad mix of policies is needed to meet these challenges. To increase the number of regular<lb/> exporters, Spain should take advantage of the group of Spanish multinationals with substantial<lb/> international experience by establishing more formal mechanisms of collaboration between them and<lb/> SMEs attempting to gain access to new markets.<lb/></p>

			<p>Moving towards a product structure with higher technology content requires stepping up business<lb/> innovation activities. Innovation and export participation have been found to be heavily interlinked, both in<lb/> Spain (<ref type="biblio">Caldera, 2010</ref>) and internationally (<ref type="biblio">Altomonte et al., 2013; Aw et al., 2011</ref>). Exporters often access<lb/> diverse knowledge inputs not available in the domestic market (<ref type="biblio">Salomon and Shaver, 2005</ref>). Product<lb/> innovation is a very important driver of exports for Spanish firms, notably SMEs (<ref type="biblio">Cassiman et al., 2010</ref>),<lb/> suggesting that export promotion policies should be combined with policies focused on promoting product<lb/> innovation. Thus, coordinating and integrating internationalisation and innovation policies under a single<lb/> responsibility would likely be beneficial. It would allow effects of diverse policies to be internalised, avoid<lb/> potential duplications and could increase synergies between various modes of innovation and<lb/> internationalisation. In this sense, the Strategic Plan for the Internationalisation of the Spanish Economy<lb/> includes measures for a closer collaboration between the export promotion agency, ICEX, and the Centre<lb/> for Technological and Industrial Development (CDTI).<lb/></p>

			<figure>Efforts to improve business framework conditions are likely to have also a positive effect in attracting<lb/> additional foreign direct investment (FDI). Encouraging greater FDI would help to boost the technological<lb/> content of exports by bringing new technologies and processes to Spain. Indeed, economies such as Ireland<lb/> have used foreign investment to establish entire new high technology industries such as medical devices<lb/> and pharmaceuticals. Another of the measures of the Strategic Plan for the Internationalisation of the<lb/> Spanish Economy is the establishment of a new programme to attract and facilitate direct foreign<lb/> investment in the information and communication technology sector. Greater foreign investment would<lb/> also provide more potential for linkages into global value chains for Spanish SMEs. FDI inflows into Spain<lb/> have been falling since 2000 (<ref type="figure">Figure 22</ref>). Nevertheless, Spain has recently managed to attract and maintain<lb/> a healthy pipeline of FDI in the automobile sector. FDI inflows increased in 2013, reflecting rising investor<lb/> confidence and existing opportunities in some sectors under restructuring such as banking or construction.<lb/></p>

			<p>The cost to export remains high in international perspective (<ref type="table">Table 4</ref>), and this is likely penalising<lb/> exports to more distant destinations especially by SMEs and inhibiting market diversification. Maritime<lb/> transport activities show low productivity and reducing these and other trading costs associated with more<lb/> distant markets should be a priority (discussed below).<lb/></p>

Progress will be monitored through a set of indicators.<lb/></table>

			<head>Strengthening competition and boosting cost competitiveness<lb/></head>

			<p>Strengthening competition is also vital for sustaining and reinforcing the ongoing recovery of cost<lb/> competitiveness needed to underpin further internationalisation of the economy. Countries with more<lb/> competitive regulatory frameworks for services achieve higher added value, productivity and export<lb/> growth in the manufacturing sectors that use services as inputs more intensively (<ref type="biblio">Barone and Cingano,<lb/> 2011</ref>). The potential beneficial effects are particularly strong for Spain, which is one of the OECD<lb/> countries whose manufacturing exports embody higher value added from services (OECD, 2013d). Indeed,<lb/> for Spain the adoption of the best regulatory practices in services could increase real goods exports by 18%<lb/> (Correa-<ref type="biblio">López and Doménech, 2014</ref>).<lb/> An important lever for boosting competition generally is to facilitate new firm entry and growth by<lb/> allowing more flexibility in wage bargaining. New firms need to be able to offer different conditions from<lb/> incumbents as a way of offsetting the often sizeable advantages of incumbency. Indeed, inflexible labour<lb/> markets lead to less dynamic firm growth distributions (<ref type="biblio">Bravo-Biosca et al., 2013</ref>). Stringent regulation<lb/> increases the costs of downward adjustment and is likely to encourage a more conservative growth strategy<lb/> (which in turns decreases the pressure on underperforming firms). Lower risk taking and slower job<lb/> reallocation may in turn reduce productivity growth. Firms may be less willing to expand their workforce<lb/> or enter into new markets if they cannot reduce their workforce later if their efforts prove to be<lb/> unsuccessful. Recent changes in Spanish labour market regulations have provided a less stringent<lb/> protection legislation regime that gives more scope for new firms to offer different wage and working<lb/> conditions from incumbents. However, more can be done to decentralise wage-bargaining processes and<lb/> thereby reduce the power of incumbent companies to use sectorial agreements as barriers to entry (<ref type="biblio">Haugh<lb/> and Westmore, 2014</ref>).<lb/> Actions need also to be taken to increase competition in sectors that provide inputs used by nearly all<lb/> firms. This is an important avenue for reducing non-labour costs and improving competitiveness of<lb/> Spanish firms in international markets. Areas of key concern include electricity, professional services,<lb/> ports and oil distribution because of their pervasive use by the business sector and/or importance for<lb/> exporting. Increasing the efficiency of the judicial system would also help to lower costs for a large part of<lb/> the business sector.<lb/></p>

			<head>Increasing competition in professional services<lb/></head>

			<p>Business services, in particular professional services which account for 75% of business services, are<lb/> markedly less productive in Spain than in other European economies (<ref type="figure">Figure 23</ref>). This is coupled with<lb/> entry requirements that are above the OECD average (<ref type="figure">Figure 24</ref>) and practices far from those in the best<lb/> performing countries. The services trade restrictiveness index for Spain is also above the OECD average in<lb/> business services, particularly legal and accounting services (OECD, 2014). In addition, there is an<lb/> unusually large number of professions for which there is a requirement to be a member of the professional<lb/> body. Opening up these services to competition would increase productivity, drive down prices, improve<lb/> the quality of the services and provide more job opportunities.<lb/></p>

			<p>professions for which membership to the professional body would be compulsory. However, the final<lb/> reform seems to be less ambitious than originally planned on this front. It would be important that the<lb/> original ambition and spirit of the law is maintained by ensuring that membership fees cannot act as<lb/> barriers to entry to the professions. The reform could also potentially increase the mobility and competition<lb/> among providers of professional services throughout Spain and therefore can be framed within the effort<lb/> being undertaken via the market unity law to create a truly unified domestic market. Once the law is<lb/> approved, the consistency of sector specific legislation, including regional legislation and professional<lb/> organisations&apos; internal rules, with the new regulatory framework will also need to be swiftly ensured so<lb/> that the liberalisation is fully effective.<lb/></p>

			<head>Fostering competition in network industries<lb/></head>

			<p>Spain has made good progress in liberalising network industries. At the same time some sectors, such<lb/> as electricity and gas, are dominated by large vertically integrated companies. The electricity sector has<lb/> recently been at the centre of intense debate because of reforms to eliminate the so-called electricity tariff<lb/> deficit (see Assessment and Recommendations). Electricity prices are high in international comparison,<lb/> especially for SMEs (<ref type="figure">Figure 25</ref>). The new electricity price mechanism has the potential to incentivise more<lb/> effective price competition between different electricity providers. Nevertheless possible uncompetitive<lb/> price setting practices have already been identified by the competition authority (CNMC, 2014a), which<lb/> has claimed in multiple instances that the degree of competition in the wholesale market is insufficient<lb/> (CNC, 2013a). The market is dominated by two firms (Endesa and Iberdrola) which are involved in all<lb/> areas of activity and manage more than 70% of electricity demand via commercialisers and distributors.<lb/> The existing separation between distribution and commercialisation activities has been deemed insufficient<lb/> by the competition authority, despite existing requirements for legal and accounting separations.<lb/> Competition in the electricity sector could be strengthened by reinforcing the separation between<lb/> distribution and commercialisation, and also between distribution and other related activities such as the<lb/> installation of measurement equipment, where distributors can take advantage of their incumbent position<lb/> and information. Competition would be further boosted by ensuring a more level playing field between<lb/> incumbents and potential entrants, such as independent commercialisers, and by reducing the cost<lb/> associated to entering these activities.<lb/></p>

			<p>In this context, ensuring that the regulator can act effectively to avoid undue barriers to entry is<lb/> fundamental. In international perspective, there seems to be room to widen the scope of actions that the<lb/> regulator can undertake in electricity and gas areas (<ref type="figure">Figure 26</ref>). In particular, it would be beneficial that the<lb/> regulator reviews and approves contract terms between regulated entities or market actors, and issues<lb/> industry standards, guidelines and codes of conduct, as done in other OECD countries.<lb/></p>

			<p>Low cross-border transmission capacity with France has also contributed to inefficiencies and higher<lb/> costs in the Spanish electricity sector. It prevents Spain from engaging in cross-border trade in electricity<lb/> and gas, and from profiting from its overcapacity in electricity generation: only around 44 gigawatts are<lb/> used at peak demand compared with 100 gigawatts installed. A new electricity interconnection with France<lb/> was supposed to be operational in 2014 but its entry into service has been further postponed. More<lb/> effective interconnections with Portugal and France would foster competition between electricity and gas<lb/> companies, increase the liquidity of both markets, allow diversity of supply and provide a more<lb/> competitive environment.<lb/></p>

			<head>Boosting competition in ports<lb/></head>

			<p>Boosting competition in ports and lowering costs for exporters is key to boosting cost-competiveness<lb/> of Spanish firms and fostering internationalisation. The port regulator is not an independent body, contrary<lb/> to international best practices and to practices followed in other regulated sectors in Spain. Instead the<lb/> regulator is a ministerial department or agency, whose decisions can be overturned by governmental or<lb/> ministerial bodies. The port system in Spain is composed of 28 port authorities, which have ample<lb/> autonomy and depend largely on regional authorities.<lb/> Sea and coastal freight water transport activities have low productivity (<ref type="figure">Figure 27</ref>), despite Spain<lb/> having several ports that are large by European standards (e.g. Barcelona, Algeciras or Valencia),<lb/> suggesting the possibility of significant economies of scale. One direct and damaging implication is that<lb/> the cost to trade is significantly higher in Spain than in other OECD countries (discussed above). In some<lb/> instances anticompetitive policies and undue barriers to entry have been identified (CNC, 2013b).<lb/></p>

			<p>Transport costs tend to have a disproportionate effect on trade volumes (<ref type="biblio">Clark et al., 2004</ref>). In<lb/> general, it has been estimated that raising transport costs by 10% can reduce trade volumes by more than<lb/> 20% (<ref type="biblio">Limao and Venables, 2000</ref>). While Spain&apos;s regulated port costs have been decreasing, stevedoring<lb/> costs remain very high in international perspective, and these services typically account for the largest<lb/> percentage of the total cost of moving goods through a port. Stevedoring activities are restricted to a pool<lb/> of exclusive workers. Cargo-handling companies are not allowed to resort to the market to employ their<lb/> staff. Instead, cargo-handling companies are required to participate financially in the capital of private<lb/> companies, which in turn provide them with the required workforce. Only when the workforce proposed by<lb/> these private companies is not suitable or not sufficient can the cargo-handling companies freely hire staff<lb/> from the market. These restrictive labour practices discourage the entry of new cargo-handling providers,<lb/> posing a barrier to attract new investment. This regime is having a significant impact in the productivity<lb/> and competitiveness of Spanish ports and is hampering the Spanish export sector. According to the<lb/> European Commission it violates the principle of free establishment of economic activity, although the<lb/> issue has been brought to the court of justice of the EU. Access to stevedoring activities should be opened<lb/> and adjusted to the EU legislation.<lb/></p>

			<head>Increasing contestability in oil distribution<lb/></head>

			<p>Oil distribution continues to be impaired by lack of sufficient contestability. These are important input<lb/> markets for many other sectors of the economy, whose international competitiveness is hampered. Recent<lb/> trend in gross margins in the fuel distribution sector are characteristic of uncompetitive markets (CNMC,<lb/> 2014b). Consumers face high pre-tax fuel prices compared with international fuel prices and with pre-tax<lb/> prices in other advanced European economies (<ref type="biblio">Avedillo Carretero, 2013</ref>). The concentration in the<lb/> automotive fuel sector remains too high and there is evidence of aligned pricing practices between the two<lb/> main operators, REPSOL and CEPSA. There is also a high level of vertical integration between supply,<lb/> refining and retail activities. Low-cost fuel retailers have a low market share and the competition between<lb/> service stations located on major roads is low. In July 2013, the government simplified procedures for<lb/> opening service stations and introduced some measures which reduce the power of established distributors<lb/> against independent retailers. The number of openings of independent service stations has grown but<lb/> increasing contestability in the distribution sector remains yet necessary. Simplifying the opening of<lb/> service stations in supermarkets and hypermarkets and reducing the duration of long-term agreements<lb/> giving exclusive operating rights over service stations have provided positive competition dynamics in the<lb/> past in some regions, which should be further exploited.<lb/></p>

			<head>Improving judicial efficiency<lb/></head>

			<p>The judicial system is also an important source of costs for business and improving its efficiency is an<lb/> important path for increasing cost-competitiveness and economic performance (<ref type="biblio">Palumbo et al., 2013</ref>).<lb/> More efficient judicial systems have a positive effect on the size of firms, both internationally (<ref type="biblio">Kumar<lb/> et al., 1999; Beck et al., 2006</ref>) and in Spain (García-<ref type="biblio">Posada and Mora-Sanguinetti, 2013a</ref>). It also has a<lb/> positive effect on the entry rate of Spanish firms (García-<ref type="biblio">Posada and Mora-Sanguinetti, 2014</ref>).<lb/> The Spanish judicial system does not rank well internationally in terms of efficiency. Spain holds<lb/> position 26 out of a total of 35 legal systems in its ability to resolve disputes before the first instance courts<lb/> (<ref type="biblio">Palumbo et al. 2013</ref>). Spain ranks 21st out of 31 OECD countries in terms of enforcing contracts (World<lb/> <ref type="biblio">Bank and IFC, 2014</ref>). Clearance rates are low, the case backlog remains high, and procedures are relatively<lb/> lengthy (<ref type="biblio">European Commission, 2013</ref>), despite some recent improvement (<ref type="biblio">European Commission, 2014</ref>).<lb/> The government has adopted measures to enhance the efficiency of the judicial system, including<lb/> reorganising the courts, implementing electronic judicial files and promoting out-of-court solutions to<lb/> conflicts. However, significant problems remain. A critical problem from the business perspective are the<lb/> so-called recursos administrativos, which are appeals against the public administration, over for example a<lb/> tax liability or denial of a permit, that need to be undertaken before reaching the ordinary judicial system.<lb/> These administrative appeals are slow to make findings and rarely conclude on the merits of the case. They<lb/> should be replaced by time limited administrative mediation processes that would automatically be deemed<lb/> as in a firm&apos;s favour if the time limit is exceeded.<lb/></p>

			<p>In addition, despite significant investment in information and communication technologies, the new<lb/> tools are not yet readily available in all courts. Promoting further mediation arrangements can provide<lb/> faster and more efficient conflict resolutions. Increasing competition in the legal profession could also<lb/> induce lower litigation and hence have a positive effect on the efficiency of the system. The pressure<lb/> exercised by competition among lawyers would constrain their potential rents, thereby reducing the<lb/> number of cases that the lawyers may find profitable to bring to court rather than settle (OECD, 2013e).<lb/></p>

			<head>Tackling over-indebtedness and improving access to finance<lb/> Facilitating insolvency procedures to help restore credit growth<lb/></head>

			<p>Boosting the performance of the business sector requires faster rehabilitation or closing down of the<lb/> high number of firms that carry excessive debt burdens. Quickly restructuring corporate debts and putting<lb/> viable firms on the path to recovery would in turn clean-up bank balance sheets allowing banks to focus on<lb/> new lending and reallocating capital to new and more productive firms.<lb/> An efficient insolvency regime is a pre-requisite for achieving this but so far the Spanish insolvency<lb/> law has proved of little use to facilitate the restructuring of viable firms and swift liquidation of unviable<lb/> ones (Mora-<ref type="biblio">Sanguinetti and Fuentes, 2012</ref>). Business bankruptcy rates in Spain were among the lowest in<lb/> the world before the 2009 economic crisis. Existing procedures appeared to be unduly complex and<lb/> judicial resolution periods tended to be too long, which is part of the broader judicial efficiency problems<lb/> discussed above. In 2012 regular procedures lasted an average of 649 days, while the duration of simplified<lb/> procedures, that are supposed to be shorter, was 665 days (<ref type="biblio">Van Hemmen, 2013</ref>). To correct this<lb/> inefficiency the government introduced several changes within its entrepreneurship law. The government<lb/> has recently reviewed them again (Decree of refinancing agreements and debt restructuring) to make it<lb/> easier to get prior agreements on write-offs, maturity extensions and debt-for-equity swaps, and to reduce<lb/> the majority needed for creditor agreements to be approved. In many cases liabilities with tax and social<lb/> security authorities account for a very significant part of the debt, but so far both authorities have not been<lb/> allowed to restructure their debts. Clear guidelines for the participation of both authorities in the<lb/> restructuring process should be established.<lb/> Bankruptcy rates are low for SMEs, and, in particular, for micro enterprises. In contrast with the low<lb/> incidence of business bankruptcies, business related mortgage foreclosures have soared during the crisis.<lb/> Small business owners tend to finance their firms with loans secured on their homes, and, if lenders<lb/> repossess the collateral, that will be reflected as residential foreclosures instead of as bankruptcies. The<lb/> small rate of small businesses filing for bankruptcy suggests that these procedures are more costly and<lb/> drawn out than the main alternative procedure, the mortgage foreclosure, and that the personal bankruptcy<lb/> law is unattractive to the individual debtor (<ref type="biblio">García-Posada and Mora-Sanguinetti, 2013b</ref>). The challenges<lb/> ahead are to enable viable SMEs to restructure unsustainable debt and get recapitalised; and to ensure<lb/> nonviable SMEs cease their activities in an orderly fashion to allow effective redeployment of capital and<lb/> other resources. Insolvency procedures often fail to meet the needs of SMEs (<ref type="biblio">European Commission,<lb/> 2012</ref>). Alternative procedures, proportionate to the size of the business, should be put in place to make<lb/> adequate solutions available for all types of SMEs. Given the limited capacity of the judicial system and<lb/> the need for rapid resolutions, promoting and facilitating voluntary out-of-court restructurings for SMEs<lb/> could provide a cost-effective and swift alternative to court supervised proceedings.<lb/></p>

			<p>The government recently introduced new out-of-court pre-insolvency payment procedures for SMEs<lb/> (acuerdo extrajudicial de pagos). The payment agreement must be approved by 60% of creditors, have a<lb/> maximum haircut of 25%, and involve a payment moratorium limited to three years. Public creditors are<lb/> excluded from the negotiations. This new procedure is a decisive step to alleviate financial distress of<lb/> SMEs in a swift manner. Nevertheless, its current configuration does not offer sufficient incentives for its<lb/> use. The procedure could be made more effective by permitting the debt haircut to go above the current<lb/> 25% maximum and the payment moratorium above three years. A significant proportion of SMEs&apos; debts<lb/> are liabilities with tax and social security authorities. Integrating these liabilities in the payment plan would<lb/> be an additional step to make these procedures more effective. These procedures are facilitated by<lb/> mediators. The government is planning to change the way mediators are selected, appointed and<lb/> remunerated. This is welcome since the current system does not provide sufficient incentives to avoid long<lb/> processes ending in the final liquidation of firms.<lb/></p>

			<p>The recent entrepreneurship law created a new category to foster entrepreneurship (empresario de<lb/> responsabilidad limitada), according to which the entrepreneur can preserve their main residence from any<lb/> payment obligation originating from their entrepreneurship activities. This category puts undue emphasis<lb/> on protecting housing assets to the detriment of other type of assets. In general, setting-up insolvency<lb/> procedures providing clear and swift procedures for debt restructuring and resolution has been found to<lb/> have a far more decisive impact in fostering entrepreneurship than partial measures to protect<lb/> entrepreneurs&apos; assets. In this sense, introducing a new personal insolvency framework allowing for a<lb/> discharge of unresolved personal debt after liquidation or a payment plan for financially responsible<lb/> individuals, as existing in other EU countries, is a preferable alternative to tackle over-indebtedness of<lb/> individual entrepreneurs and increase entrepreneurship. Existing alternatives are too narrow in scope and<lb/> too stringent in their requirements to be broadly used or to have a significant impact.<lb/></p>

			<head>Moving towards more diversified financing<lb/></head>

			<p>Bank-lending has been the predominant financing source in Spain. The crisis boosted bank<lb/> disintermediation, in particular for larger firms that have increased issuance of corporate debt (<ref type="figure">Figure 28</ref>).<lb/> Issuance remains though below those observed in more developed corporate bond markets, such as<lb/> Germany, France or Italy. Market funding opportunities for SMEs have been more limited though.<lb/> Moreover, SMEs have more difficulties to establish new banking relationships and they tend to use as<lb/> collateral real-estate assets, whose value has fallen, which complicates further their access to credit.<lb/></p>

			<p>The downsizing of the banking sector makes the development of alternative, capital market-based<lb/> sources of finance more urgent, especially for SMEs. Developing non-bank financing, would also reduce<lb/> banks&apos; market power, which may help to make Spanish bank lending rates more responsive to monetary<lb/> policy. Where banks in Europe face limited competition, and firms depend on them, financing constraints<lb/> for SMEs have been found to be higher (<ref type="biblio">Ryan et al., 2014</ref>). Moreover, in normal downturns, healthy banks<lb/> help to cushion the shock, but when recessions have coincided with financial crises the impact on GDP has<lb/> been three times more severe for bank-oriented economies than for market-oriented ones (<ref type="biblio">Gambacorta<lb/> et al., 2014</ref>). Access to bank finance can be particularly challenging for young and innovative firms that do<lb/></p>

Thus, developing non-bank financing channels would make the<lb/> Spanish financial system more balanced, more resistant to shocks and more prone to entrepreneurship.<lb/> With that aim the government has launched a wide array of initiatives, including developing alternative<lb/> securities markets, improving the public guarantee system and venture capital initiatives (discussed below).<lb/> The effects of these initiatives will unfold progressively over time, and in the meantime measures to<lb/> improve firms&apos; access to bank finance are also required.<lb/></table>

			<head>Improving access to bank financing<lb/></head>

			<p>One way to improve the financing conditions of SMEs is to provide banks with funds to be used to<lb/> make loans to SMEs. In Spain, this is done via the Official Credit institute (Instituto de Crédito Oficial,<lb/> ICO) intermediation facilities. Through these facilities ICO provides funds to banks at a lower cost on the<lb/> condition that the funds are lent for a certain kind of activity or type of firm, including SMEs. Banks<lb/> assume fully the credit risk and charge a premium to remunerate their operating costs and the credit risk<lb/> assumed. ICO sets a ceiling for this premium, which currently stands at about 4%. The German<lb/> government agency Kreditanstalt für Wiederaufbau (KfW), OSEO in France and the European Investment<lb/> bank (EIB) also use these kind of facilities. Via these facilities ICO granted credit amounting to EUR 14<lb/> billion in 2013 (an increase of 20% with respect to 2012), having a material impact in the incipient<lb/> recovery in the flow of new credit. In the first half of 2014 credit disposition amounted to EUR 10.9<lb/> billion, which is a record figure. In the short-term, these facilities can be effective in improving firms&apos;<lb/> access to finance. Nevertheless, in the medium-term, the emphasis should move towards more market-<lb/>based alternatives currently under development (discussed below) and to make firms less dependent on<lb/> publicly supported bank finance.<lb/> Well-structured mutual guarantee schemes (MGS) can also play a decisive role in improving firms&apos;<lb/> access to bank finance. They spread some of the risk and thereby enable banks to extend loans to firms that<lb/> would find it difficult to access credit otherwise or to do it under better conditions (<ref type="biblio">Columba et al., 2009</ref>).<lb/> For banks they can act as an important risk mitigation mechanism since they do not need to provision loans<lb/> guaranteed by MGS.<lb/> In Spain, MGS are a special type of limited liability society with two types of shareholders:<lb/> &quot; participatory members &quot; , who subscribe some shares against the guarantee service (currently about<lb/> 100 000 SMEs); and &quot; protective members &quot; , which include local authorities, banks, chambers of commerce<lb/> and other entities that are involved in SME development. Typically, the guarantees issued by MGS cover<lb/> 100% of the bank loan. The Spanish system of public support to MGS is based on counter-guarantees<lb/> granted by CERSA (Compañía Española de Reafianzamiento, SA), which is under the Ministry of<lb/> Industry, Energy and Tourism (OECD, 2013b). CERSA can cover up to 75% of the risk, depending on size<lb/> and conditions of the loan. The rest of the risk is covered by the MGS themselves. A new measure<lb/> introduced recently in Spanish regulation allows banks benefiting from a guarantee from a MGS to request<lb/> the reimbursement of its claim directly from the counter-guarantor, CERSA. This reduces significantly the<lb/> counterparty risk of the bank with the MGS.<lb/> MGS could play an important role in the current financing environment, where SMEs face relatively<lb/> strict financing conditions and banks must ensure a high level of capital quality. MGS offer the competitive<lb/> advantage of being close to the borrowers. This allows an effective monitoring and screening of loan<lb/> applications. It is estimated that banks can obtain 45% risk-weighted yields on operations with guarantees,<lb/> compared with 16.5% without guarantees and that the cost of the loan for the SME would be reduced by<lb/> 250 basis points (PWC, 2014). Moreover, MGS tend to provide firms with long-term financing, while<lb/> SMEs usually obtain short-term loans from banks. Therefore they can contribute to SMEs moving towards<lb/> a more balanced financing term structure.<lb/> The use of MGS in Spain is lower than in other countries with a similar firm structure such as Italy<lb/> and Portugal. The volume of outstanding guarantees amounted to 0.6% of GDP in Spain in 2011,<lb/> compared with 2.2% and 1.9% in Italy and Portugal (OECD, 2013b). A more extended use of MGS in<lb/> Spain will likely require a change in scale. There are currently 23 MGS in Spain, but some do not have<lb/> sufficient capital to significantly expand their activity (PWC, 2014). In general, a change in scale, with<lb/> mergers or consolidation can help reduce the relative costs of the service, as well as broaden the offer of<lb/> guarantee instruments (OECD, 2013b). Larger MGS can also provide more professional management and<lb/> screening tools. A consolidation process is underway, after the entrepreneurship law increased equity and<lb/> resources requirements for MGS. At the same time, there is a trade-off between efficient scale and<lb/> proximity to borrowers, which historically has been MGS&apos; competitive advantage. Strengthening the<lb/> public counter-guarantee by further increasing the resources of CERSA may also be required. That would<lb/> imply an increase in contingent liabilities for the government. Thus, it should be accompanied by regular<lb/> stress tests to check the solvency of the guarantee system.<lb/></p>

			<head>Developing alternatives to bank-lending<lb/></head>

			<p>Besides bank loans, alternative financing sources are important, especially for high-growth firms that<lb/> want to diversify their funding basis or need a mix of debt and equity. As Spain&apos;s recovery gains steam, it<lb/> will be critical to supplement bank lending with new sources of finance, so that bank capacity constraints<lb/> do not hold back the necessary financing of new business. One of the main alternatives is venture capital,<lb/> which has remained underdeveloped in Spain so far (<ref type="figure">Figure 29</ref>). To contribute to the development of the<lb/> venture capital market, the government has launched a programme called Fond-ICO Global. It is the first<lb/> public venture capital &quot; fund of funds &quot; created in Spain, and has a budget of EUR 1.2 billion. It seeks to<lb/> promote the creation of privately managed venture capital funds investing in Spanish companies at<lb/> different stages of development, with the goal to mobilise around EUR 5 billion of funds. The venture<lb/> capital funds in which Fond-ICO Global invests must have a majority of private capital and a presence in<lb/> Spain. The amount of capital invested by Fond-ICO Global in each fund will depend on the stages in which<lb/> it invests and the size of the fund. The emphasis in ensuring a majority of private capital is welcomed,<lb/> since government venture capital efforts have been found to have a positive impact when they have a<lb/> minority position and not when they are leaders (<ref type="biblio">Brander et al., 2012; Grilli and Murtinu, 2014</ref>). The<lb/> selection of venture capital funds in which Fond-ICO participates is done via successive tender procedures.<lb/> It would be important to ensure a systematic and unified evaluation of the results of the first tenders so that<lb/> future calls can be adapted based on the results of that evaluation.<lb/></p>

			<p>Stock markets geared towards smaller firms are important complement to venture capital schemes.<lb/> Contrary to Germany or the United Kingdom where alternative stock exchanges are vibrant, the Spanish<lb/> alternative market, MAB (Mercado Alternativo Bursátil), has remained less developed: 22 firms are<lb/> currently listed, reflecting that not many SMEs comply with some of the requirements to list in the market<lb/> (e.g. estimated value of the free float above EUR 2 million). Spain has also recently launched an<lb/> alternative fixed-income market (MARF, in its Spanish acronym). MARF&apos;s potential issuers are large<lb/> unlisted companies, with EBITDA levels of at least EUR 12 million. Given these requirements, a massive<lb/> entry of issuers in this new market should not be expected (<ref type="biblio">Guijarro and Mañueco, 2013</ref>). So far six<lb/> issuances have taken place. MARF targets solely institutional investors and the minimum unit issue<lb/> amount is EUR 100 000. The examples of Germany and Norway, with markets raising volumes of funds<lb/> that represent 1% and 0.13% of GDP, are good benchmarks for MARF&apos;s potential capacity. Nevertheless,<lb/> the predominance of small firms in the corporate sector in Spain will constrain the total funds that can be<lb/> raised compared to other European economies more populated by medium-sized companies.<lb/></p>

			<head>Other measures would also help firms financing<lb/></head>

			<p>Access to credit by SMEs would also be improved if assessing borrower creditworthiness becomes<lb/> easier. Mechanisms to facilitate the regular production of uniform, quality data on the most important<lb/> aspects of the business of SMEs would help. Banque de France has been identified as the institution<lb/> collecting the most comprehensive set of data on SMEs (IIF, 2013), and this is coupled with the lowest<lb/> spread between loans to large companies and loans to SMEs in the euro area. Banque de France requires<lb/> detailed reporting on all loans larger than EUR 25 000, and from this data they compile credit scores on<lb/> around 280 000 companies operating in France, the majority of which are SMEs. The credit scores and<lb/> related financial information, including aggregated bank claims for an individual SME, are made available<lb/> to French banks. Establishing a comprehensive central credit registry similar to the Banque de France<lb/> model would significantly reduce information asymmetries and contribute to banks providing SMEs with<lb/> loans at better terms.<lb/></p>

			<p>The current framework of public financial support for SMEs, which rests on a broad variety of<lb/> instruments provided by various institutions, could also be simplified to make it easier for SMEs to absorb<lb/> information and access support. Simplification and consolidation may increase the effectiveness and cost-<lb/>efficiency of the system and avoid duplications. In addition to ICO there are several agencies and<lb/> institutions providing financing support to Spanish companies such as Compañía Española de Financiación<lb/> del Desarrollo (COFIDES) and Empresa Nacional de Innovación, SA (ENISA). In some cases these<lb/> institutions have cross-shareholdings and the instruments they offer are very similar (<ref type="biblio">Ayuso, 2013</ref>).<lb/> Concentrating all financing support in ICO may contribute to achieving economies of scale and<lb/> exploitation of all possible synergies, in addition to offering firms a clearer access point to support.<lb/> The financing of Spanish firms, in particular SMEs, is also seriously impaired by very late payments<lb/> -or even failure to pay – in commercial transactions. To combat that, a new law (Ley de Morosidad) has<lb/> established maximum terms of payment in commercial relations. These legal terms are compulsory and<lb/> binding and therefore cannot be lengthened by mutual agreement of the parties. The maximum term is<lb/> 30 days for administrative entities (from delivery of the document that accredits the total or partial<lb/> fulfilment of the contract) and 60 days for private companies (from the date of receipt of the goods or<lb/> rendering of services), in line with European Union directives. While payment terms have decreased, they<lb/> remain above the maximums established by the law. The authorities should introduce sanctions for those<lb/> firms systematically incurring late payments above the legal limits.<lb/></p>
