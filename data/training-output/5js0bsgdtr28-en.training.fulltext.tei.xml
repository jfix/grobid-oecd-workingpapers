			<head>EDUCATION<lb/> INDICATORS<lb/> FOCUS<lb/> 32<lb/></head>

			<p>Educational opportunities have a very important impact on a person&apos;s life. Employment, earnings, well-being, health and<lb/> trust are all strongly related to education and skills. A lack of high-quality educational opportunities is the most important<lb/> way in which poverty, social inequality and exclusion are transmitted from one generation to another. For countries to<lb/> grow and progress in a sustainable way, educational opportunities should be distributed in an inclusive way.<lb/></p>

			<p>The inclusiveness of educational systems can be assessed in two ways: first, by looking at the share of people with<lb/> low educational attainment or low skills and second, by looking at the size of the differences in attainment levels and<lb/> skills distributions. This briefing examines both measures, and tracks their evolution over time.<lb/></p>

			<head>The share of those with low education is decreasing rapidly, but not at the same rate in all countries.<lb/> Are education and skills being distributed more inclusively?<lb/></head>

			<p>Between</p>

			<table>2000 and 2013 the share of 25-64 year-olds with tertiary education grew by 3.1% a<lb/> year on average across OECD countries, while the share of those without an upper secondary<lb/> education fell by 2.9%.<lb/> In 2013, more than 40% of adults still lacked an upper secondary education in five OECD countries.<lb/> Some countries increased their tertiary attainment rates faster than they reduced lower<lb/> educational attainment rates, while others (Poland, Luxembourg, Czech and Slovak Republics,<lb/> and Korea) realised similar tertiary attainment increases but also reduced their below upper<lb/> secondary attainment rates by the same amount.<lb/> In all countries the share of low-skilled adults is lower among younger age groups than among<lb/> older ones, but in some countries more than 20% of adults still have low literacy skills.<lb/> In all countries the distribution of literacy skills is skewed towards the bottom, with a greater<lb/> spread between the median and the bottom 10% than between the median and the top 10%.<lb/> Most analyses of educational attainment rates look at the increases in the share of people with tertiary education, and<lb/> over the past decades OECD countries have witnessed a remarkable growth of such highly educated people. Among<lb/> OECD countries with data for all years between 2000 and 2013, the number of people with tertiary education grew<lb/> by 3.1% on average per year.<lb/></table>

			<p>But what has happened at the bottom of the educational ladder? Did educational expansion also decrease the share<lb/> of people with low levels of education in the population? <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref> shows that over the same period, the share of<lb/> 25-64 year-olds without an upper secondary education decreased by 2.9% per year on average across OECD countries<lb/> with data for all years, slightly slower than the growth rate for tertiary attainment, but many countries reduced<lb/> low educational attainment rates much faster. The highest reduction rates can be found among countries that had<lb/> reduced the share of people without an upper secondary education to below the OECD average of 24% in 2013.<lb/> Unfortunately, in five countries, more than 40% of the population still have low educational attainment, and those<lb/> countries have not even reached the average reduction rate of 2.9% per year.<lb/></p>

			<p>Figure 3 also provides a measure of progress in reducing the share of adults with low literacy levels. Although there<lb/> is no measure over time, looking at the difference in the share of 25-34 year-olds and 55-64 year-olds with low skills<lb/> provides an estimate of the amount of progress made. However, in countries that have effective adult-learning systems<lb/> through which older adults can improve their skills, such as Norway and Sweden, actual progress over time may be<lb/> underestimated. Thus, this proxy should be interpreted with caution. All entities have seen the share of adults below<lb/> Level 2 on the literacy scale fall by this measure, but in the Slovak Republic, England and the United States only very<lb/> modest progress has been made. In contrast to the trend in educational attainment (see <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>), those entities<lb/> with high percentages of adults with low literacy skills have also demonstrated the highest relative decreases.<lb/></p>

			<head>The share of adults with low literacy skills is also decreasing, but in some countries it remains at a high level.<lb/></head>

			<p>Moving from educational attainment to skills, can we say anything about the inclusiveness of a country&apos;</p>

			<table>s skills distribution and<lb/> its evolution over time? The 2012 Survey of Adult Skills, a product of the OECD Programme for the International Assessment<lb/> of Adult Competencies (PIAAC), found that, on average across participating national and sub-national entities, 16.4% of<lb/> 25-64 year-olds still have literacy skills below Level 2 although this average conceals wide variations between entities, as<lb/> Figure 3 (vertical axis) demonstrates. In Italy, Spain and France over 20% of adults do not reach Level 2 for literacy skills.<lb/></table>

			<p>where tertiary attainment has grown faster than low attainment has fallen. Some countries have low annual rates of<lb/> change; others have gone through a much more rapid expansion in educational attainment. Compare for example<lb/> the cases of Turkey and Korea: both share a similar annual growth rate in tertiary attainment, but in Korea this has<lb/> been accompanied by a similar or even slightly higher fall in low education attainment rates, while in Turkey the<lb/> share of 25-64 year-olds without an upper secondary education diminished only slightly.<lb/></p>

			<head>In all countries the skills distribution is skewed towards the bottom.<lb/></head>

			<figure>Figure 4 shows the overall distribution of literacy skills among 25-64 year-olds as measured in the OECD Survey of Adult<lb/> Skills (PIAAC). It shows that, in all national and sub-national entities participating in the survey, the distance between<lb/> the median and the 10th percentile is greater than between the median and the 90th percentile. In all entities the<lb/> distribution is skewed towards the bottom.<lb/></figure>

			<p>In the Slovak and Czech Republics, Japan, and Korea the overall size of the skills distribution is relatively small, suggesting<lb/> a fairly inclusive distribution of literacy skills across the adult population. In contrast, in the United States, Canada, Finland<lb/></p>

			<p>the distribution is wider, especially at the bottom end.

			<head>The</head>

			<p>bottom line: Not everyone has benefited from the increase in educational attainment and skills<lb/> in the population in recent years. The shares of adults with low educational attainment and low skills<lb/> remain significantly high, although the data suggest a fair amount of progress towards a more inclusive<lb/> distribution of education and skills. Differences between countries are very significant, however, and<lb/> some risk leaving parts of their population behind with enduring low levels of education and skills.<lb/></p>
