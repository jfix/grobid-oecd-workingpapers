			<table>CELE Exchange 2009/1<lb/> © OECD 2009<lb/> By Eamonn Greville, Department of Education and Science, Ireland<lb/> The Department of Education and Science in Ireland has recently drawn up a set of planning and<lb/> design guidelines for learning spaces for pupils with special educational needs in mainstream primary<lb/> and post primary schools.<lb/> The document entitled &quot; Planning &amp; Design Guidelines for Accommodation for Pupils with Special<lb/> Educational Needs in Primary &amp; Post Primary Schools &quot; (Technical Guidance Document 026) will<lb/> shortly be published on the Department&apos;s website at www.education.ie.<lb/></table>

			<p>These guidelines offer information on space planning and design for school principals, boards of<lb/> management and designers to make permanent learning facilities available for pupils with special<lb/> educational needs across the 26 counties of Ireland. The guidelines reflect many of the recent changes<lb/> in the country&apos;s educational system, changes that have placed greater demands on schools for additional<lb/> space to account for a growing range of teaching and support services for pupils with autistic spectrum<lb/> disorders, emotional disturbance and/or behaviour problems, speech and language difficulties, hearing<lb/> impairment, visual impairment, multi-sensory impairment, and other needs.<lb/></p>

			<p>A number of mainstream schools, mainly at primary level, have been providing classrooms for pupils with<lb/> special educational needs for some time, mainly in the area of autistic spectrum disorders; however the<lb/> type and quality of physical infrastructure needed to deliver these classes has often been less than ideal.<lb/> Classrooms at post primary level were less common, though in 1999 the Department helped set up a<lb/> special education facility for teaching up to 15 pupils with a moderate general learning disability in a post<lb/> primary school in County Offaly, Ireland. The project went ahead in 2001, and is today fully operational;<lb/> this has become one of the models of successful integrated special needs provision in the country.<lb/> The focus has now moved towards a more integrated service provision for pupils with special educational<lb/> needs in the mild/moderate spectrum. These guidelines will now, for the first time, establish a clear set of<lb/> physical parameters for schools and designers in providing a suite of learning accommodation for these<lb/> pupils within the mainstream school setting. The Department, working with the Special Educational<lb/> Needs Organiser, will identify suitable schools for this accommodation, based on a set of criteria, and<lb/> will work closely with these schools and their boards of management to establish the special needs<lb/> element and to fund the necessary physical and teaching resources.<lb/></p>

			<p>The spaces can typically be provided either as an extension to an existing mainstream primary or post<lb/> primary school, or as part of a new primary or post primary school design; the surface area totals 470 m²<lb/> for primary schools and 552 m² for post primary schools. The basis is a suite of two general classrooms<lb/> of 70 m² linked by a central activities area. Ancillary spaces include an individual withdrawal room<lb/> off each classroom, fully assisted toileting with a level-entry shower accessible from each classroom,<lb/> a multi-sensory room, a para-educational room, a linen/sluice room, storage, and an office and toilets<lb/> for staff. Outside are a dedicated secure play area (hard and soft play) and a sensory garden, as well as<lb/> additional car parking.<lb/></p>

			<p>There are two key objectives in meeting the challenges posed by providing for pupils with special<lb/> educational needs. These are inclusivity and flexibility. The Department&apos;s view is that for all new school<lb/> building projects, the spaces for pupils with special educational needs must be appropriately located<lb/> within the design proposal in order to promote and develop inclusivity. All pupils, regardless of ability,<lb/></p>

			<p>should be able to enter via the main entrance to the school building on a daily basis and participate in<lb/> their education in an inclusive manner. Locating their spaces in a remote, isolated part of the building<lb/> or in a stand-alone building, where contact and social development opportunities with the main school<lb/> population would be difficult to promote, is not acceptable.<lb/> It is equally important that the layout and quality of the design provides flexibility for the school and<lb/> support staff in adequately supporting its pupils. A typical example would be the classroom layout<lb/> which may change on a regular basis according to daily needs. Fixed partitions and immobile furniture<lb/> are not recommended as they would not offer the required level of flexibility to adapt the space to meet<lb/> the user needs.<lb/></p>

			<p>From time to time &quot; reverse inclusion &quot; may take place, i.e. where mainstream pupils are included with<lb/> pupils with special educational needs for curricular activities. Flexibility to adapt the teaching space is<lb/> critical in order to facilitate reverse inclusion and to ensure that the physical layout of the spaces does<lb/> not restrict or hinder the school&apos;s curricular programme.<lb/></p>

			<head>DESIGn SolutIonS<lb/></head>

			<p>The guidelines deal in some detail with the design considerations which need to be incorporated into<lb/> the physical building structure. The range of special needs is vast and the design solutions should<lb/> accommodate all needs however diverse their requirements. For example, some pupils with autistic<lb/> spectrum disorders can display extreme sensitivity to sensory stimulation: sound, light, colour, smell<lb/> and pattern. It is critical therefore that the building design for these pupils be aimed at reducing<lb/> environmental stimuli through directing attention to the amount and type of visual, aural, tactile and<lb/> olfactory stimulation. Conversely, pupils who have a visual impairment depend greatly on auditory and<lb/> tactile cues within the building, and its design should reflect this need.<lb/></p>

			<p>In addition, the drive for inclusion requires the designer to mesh the mainstream spaces and special<lb/> needs elements in a seamless manner both internally and externally. The Department expects schools<lb/> and their design teams to adopt pragmatic, cost effective approaches to ensure the continuum of<lb/> design solutions, particularly in spaces where special educational pupils require regular access to the<lb/> mainstream school (e.g. the general purpose room and circulation areas). Examples of a cost effective<lb/> approach include the use of appropriate colour, floor coverings, control of natural light and shade,<lb/> avoidance of strong patterns and textures, acoustic modification of the internal environment, and high<lb/> frequency light fittings.<lb/></p>

			<p>While the guidelines emphasise providing a pleasant educational environment, designers should<lb/> carefully consider the selection of materials and the detailing and design of services to ensure the<lb/> safety of all. Some pupils can become quite distressed and occasionally exhibit challenging behaviour;<lb/> finishes and fittings should eliminate opportunities for self-injury. Guidance is given on the appropriate<lb/> use of floor coverings, wall and ceiling finishes, acoustics, glazing, door ironmongery, daylighting,<lb/> mechanical and electrical services, and furniture and fittings.<lb/></p>

			<p>The document also lists typical spaces and their surface areas for primary and post primary schools and<lb/> presents a floor plan of an exemplar scheme which shows the optimum adjacencies and relationship<lb/> between these spaces for a primary school setting.<lb/></p>

			<head>concluSIon<lb/></head>

			<p>These guidelines are seen as a further positive step towards integrating pupils with special needs into<lb/> mainstream schooling. They will be enhanced and updated on a regular basis to reflect the changing<lb/> and challenging needs of these pupils and their environment. A number of these accommodation suites<lb/> are already under construction and more are due for completion over the coming years.<lb/> Pupils with severe and profound physical and intellectual disabilities including multiple disabilities<lb/> are not specifically covered by this guidance document. The Department recognises that those pupils<lb/> require intensive care and support in special schools, a number of which exist across the country. Due<lb/> to the specific space and design requirements for that group, the Department will develop separate<lb/> guidance for those schools in the future.<lb/></p>
