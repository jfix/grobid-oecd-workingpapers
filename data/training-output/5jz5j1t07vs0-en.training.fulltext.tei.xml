			<head>How to improve taxes and transfers in Israel<lb/> By<lb/> Philip Hemmings 1<lb/></head>

			<p>Taxes and transfers are an important tool for reaching economic, social and environmental objectives,<lb/> including achieving deficit and debt targets, creating a competitive business environment and assisting<lb/> low-income households. Given the multiple facets of tax and transfer policies, making the most of<lb/> &apos;win-win&apos; opportunities and having a good gauge of the trade-offs where these occur are key to good<lb/> policymaking. In Israel, past and renewed efforts to reduce public indebtedness, while making the tax<lb/> system more conducive to growth in an environment of high interest payments, large defence-spending<lb/> commitments and significant socio-economic divides mean the authorities have long been keenly aware of<lb/> the challenges. This paper evaluates current policies and plans for the future and concludes with a series of<lb/> recommendations.<lb/></p>

			<head>Notable features of the system<lb/></head>

			<p>Israeli policymakers have pushed tax and transfer reforms a long way in some dimensions, most<lb/> notably away from direct taxation and towards both indirect taxation and parsimonious social welfare<lb/> payments:<lb/> • Until 2011 the authorities had been cutting statutory rates of direct taxation on households and<lb/> businesses as part of a strategy of containing the &apos;size&apos; of government and making the tax<lb/> environment more business friendly. Up to 2007, total tax revenues as a share of GDP had been<lb/> close to the OECD average, but they have since dropped markedly, reflecting, in part, the effects<lb/> of reductions in personal-income tax (PIT) and corporate-income tax (CIT) (<ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>, Panels A<lb/> and B). However, this created difficulties of squaring goals in public-debt reduction with<lb/> spending commitments, and the 2011 &apos;tent protests&apos; saw increased political opposition; as a<lb/> result, the scheduled cuts in the CIT and upper rates of PIT were halted. Since then, rates in both<lb/> these tax bases have been increased as part of efforts to contain fiscal deficits, but also in<lb/> response to perceived injustices in the burden of taxation raised by the protests</p>

			<p>• Indirect and property tax revenues are high as a share of GDP in international comparison<lb/> (<ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>, Panel C). Value-added tax (VAT) accounts for the lion&apos;s share of indirect tax revenues,<lb/> and a municipally administered tax on housing and commercial buildings accounts for the vast<lb/> majority of property tax. Alongside the usual &apos;sin taxes&apos; on tobacco and alcohol, there are<lb/> specific customs duties or purchase taxes on many consumer durables and food items. The tent<lb/> protests prompted cancellations or reductions in many of these. However, some substantial<lb/> specific indirect taxes remain, including a heavy purchase tax on cars (though this has been given<lb/> an environmental dimension in recent years), and new taxes on some luxury items have recently<lb/> been introduced.<lb/> • As for civilian public spending as a whole, spending on welfare transfers to households is low in<lb/> international comparison. This is partly explained by Israel&apos;s somewhat faster economic growth<lb/> and lower unemployment rate than in many other OECD countries, particularly in recent years.<lb/> But the low level of spending also reflects broader efforts to limit the scale of total public<lb/> spending in the context of high debt-service costs and defence spending. Arguably, the level of<lb/> public spending also reflects a &apos;supply side&apos; policy view by successive governments, in particular<lb/> a wariness of cash benefits because of their potential to create welfare traps that discourage<lb/> employment. The low level of social spending can be seen both in the share of social spending in<lb/> GDP (<ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>, Panel D) and in comparisons of the tax-benefit positions of different sorts of<lb/> households. The tent protests nevertheless led to more generous tax breaks for households with<lb/> children and commitments to provide free childcare and early education services.<lb/> • For businesses the landscape is a familiar one. The statutory corporate-tax rate is combined with<lb/> various allowances (for instance, on R&amp;D outlays and capital depreciation), plus targeted tax<lb/> breaks and other support aimed at larger businesses and a menu of programmes supporting small-<lb/>and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). The centrepiece of support is legislation that includes<lb/> substantially lower corporate tax rates for internationally competitive businesses. As elsewhere,<lb/> tax revenues from corporate profits are modest compared with those on labour and on goods and<lb/> services and fluctuate considerably over the business cycle. However, based on an average of the<lb/> past seven years, CIT revenues as a share of GDP compare favourably with elsewhere (<ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>,<lb/> Panel C), suggesting that the effective rate is perhaps somewhat higher.<lb/></p>

			<head>Key challenges<lb/></head>

			<p>The challenges for tax and transfer policy can be seen as having four inter-related components:<lb/></p>

			<p>• Identifying the best (or rather least damaging) revenue-raising measures and cutbacks in public<lb/> spending to achieve targets in deficit and debt reduction. A package of measures as part of the<lb/> recent 2013-14 budget was the latest initiative to this end.<lb/> • Enhancing the role played by the tax and transfer system in achieving a socially acceptable<lb/> distribution of income and, in particular, in relieving Israel&apos;s chronic problems of poverty and<lb/> weak labour-force attachment in certain communities. High poverty rates and low employment<lb/> rates, particularly in the rapidly growing Haredi community and the Arab-Israeli sector, remain a<lb/></p>

			<p>concern, not only from a social perspective but also in terms of long-term growth prospects. Even<lb/> though Israel already has a reasonably pro-growth tax structure, further improvement on this<lb/> front, particularly in the context of competition with other countries for international investment,<lb/> needs to remain a policy priority.<lb/> • Improving the environmental features of the tax system. Despite progress in &apos;greening&apos; some<lb/> existing tax bases and the introduction of dedicated environmental taxes, as in most countries<lb/> there is room for further action on this front.<lb/></p>

			<p>The following sections first summarise the recent history of tax and benefit reforms and then discuss<lb/> how policy has addressed the above issues and the best way forward under five headings: indirect taxation;<lb/> household income tax and social benefits; taxes on property and wealth; business taxation; and evasion,<lb/> avoidance and administration issues.<lb/></p>

			<head>Background: the recent history of tax and transfer measures<lb/></head>

			<p>There have been three recent packages of tax and spending measures. The first followed up the<lb/> recommendations of the Trajtenberg Committee that was set up in 2011 in response to the tent protests and<lb/> aimed to be fiscally neutral. PIT progressivity was notched up, capital was taxed more heavily, and<lb/> customs duties were rationalised on consumer durables and food with a view to lowering retail prices<lb/> (<ref type="table">Table 1</ref>). Second, by mid-2012 it had become clear that fiscal balances were going seriously off target,<lb/> prompting revenue-raising measures that included a rise in the standard rate of VAT and further increases<lb/> in top-end PIT rates. This was followed in the 2013-14 budget by further measures as part of the significant<lb/> consolidation to bring the deficit back on target. This latest round of changes includes many revenue<lb/> measures and transfer savings, including additional hikes in the VAT, CIT and PIT rates and cuts in child<lb/> allowances.<lb/></p>

			<head>Indirect tax<lb/></head>

			<p>Indirect taxes have some attractive features. Theory and evidence suggests they are preferable to<lb/> direct taxes in terms of economic growth (for instance, <ref type="biblio">Arnold, 2008</ref>), as they favour saving and<lb/> investment and have a smaller impact on business costs and profits. Also, for those goods and services<lb/> where there is inelastic consumer demand (or producer supply), there are opportunities for reliable<lb/> revenues with comparatively low deadweight losses in economic welfare. Indirect taxes can also<lb/> &apos;internalise&apos; externalities, in particular those connected with the environment and public health. Of course<lb/> there are potential downsides: they can be a vehicle for protectionism, distort household consumption and<lb/> saving behaviour and can be regressive.<lb/> Israel has long made heavy use of indirect taxation. Indeed, at least since the mid-1990s revenues<lb/> from taxes on goods and services have been among the highest in the OECD area both as a share of GDP<lb/> and of overall revenues (<ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>). In revenue terms, VAT is by far the largest single item. Other indirect<lb/> taxes are by no means insignificant, however, representing about 37% of all indirect tax and nearly 4% of<lb/> GDP in 2011 (<ref type="table">Table 2</ref>). They are practically all targeted on specific goods and services in one way or<lb/> another and comprise various sales taxes, customs duties, excises and fees. Excise on fuels is the largest<lb/> component, accounting for about 45% of this class of revenues.<lb/></p>

			<head>A good system of VAT<lb/></head>

			<p>Israel&apos;s VAT system is admirable in that there is a single rate with few exemptions. As a result,<lb/> revenues (both as a share of GDP and of total revenues) have been consistently above the OECD average,<lb/> despite the comparatively modest standard rate (<ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>); thus, the VAT Revenue Ratio is high (this ratio<lb/> is derived by dividing actual revenues by the revenues implied by applying the standard VAT rate to total<lb/> household consumption).<lb/></p>

			<p>Multiple rates of VAT (with &apos;preferential&apos; rates alongside the standard rate) and more widespread<lb/> exemptions should be avoided. In contrast to the Israeli case, many OECD countries&apos; VAT systems have<lb/> become complicated because of such provisions. In principle, preferential rates and exemptions can be<lb/> used to address equity issues and correct for externalities. However, as pointed out in the OECD&apos;s<lb/> Consumption Tax Trends (OECD, 2012a), in general they are not the best tools for the job. As means of<lb/> addressing income inequality and poverty inefficiency arises because exemptions and preferential rates<lb/> benefit all households, including the affluent. Similarly, targeting environmental externalities via VAT can<lb/> be a blunt instrument as it may not accurately impact the source of the externality; for instance, reduced<lb/> rates on energy-saving appliances may boost demand and stimulate use, thus denting the intended curbing<lb/> of energy consumption. In addition, despite possibly good intentions, creating a subset of items benefitting<lb/> from preferential rates or exemptions almost inevitably gives rise to anomalies, complications, additional<lb/> administrative costs and the attention of lobby groups. It is worth noting that while there is only a single<lb/></p>

			<p>VAT rate in Israel, the retail prices of quite a number of basic food items are regulated, so there is some<lb/> official attention to affordability issues, although price regulation is not the best solution.<lb/> Indeed, the authorities should consider making VAT coverage even wider by removing the remaining<lb/> exemptions; fruit and vegetables along with services in the tourist centre of Eilat. Although they are hard to<lb/> justify on economic grounds, they remain fully VAT exempt, despite several proposals to eliminate them,<lb/> including during the development of the fiscal budget for 2013-14.<lb/> Raising the rate of VAT is in many respects a logical choice for increasing revenues. Indeed, it was<lb/> raised from 16 to 17% in 2012 and to 18% in 2013. As mentioned, VAT is more growth friendly than other<lb/> taxes, and relatively modest rate increases can yield sizeable additional revenues. For instance, a<lb/> 1 percentage-point increase is reckoned to add around NIS 4 billion (i.e. around 0.4 percentage point of<lb/> GDP). Should substantial additional revenues be required to reach the fiscal targets, then further increases<lb/> in VAT may well be among the best options. However, such a move would no doubt raise concerns about<lb/> the impact on the cost of living of low-income households. As underscored above, addressing this through<lb/> exemptions or preferential rates of VAT would be a poor strategy. Instead, consideration could be given to<lb/> providing offsetting measures in welfare policy.<lb/></p>

			<head>Welcome reductions in the taxation of specific consumer durables and food items<lb/></head>

			<p>Israel has historically made heavy use of supplementary forms of indirect taxation (purchase taxes,<lb/> customs and excise duties). Limited trade with neighbouring economies, tightly controlled points of entry<lb/> to the country and a low risk of retaliation from trading partners due to the economy&apos;s relatively small size<lb/> have made these attractive tax bases for the treasury and a vehicle for protecting domestic production.<lb/> Over time, the number of these supplementary taxes has been reduced, and the rates of tax or duty<lb/> have been lowered on those that remain. Complaints about the cost of living that were a key issue in the<lb/> tent protests of 2011 have prompted the government to undertake further rationalisation:<lb/> • Customs duties on consumer durables have been completely abolished. Previously, consumer<lb/> durable items under 21 tariff codes, ranging from microwave ovens to hairdryers, were subject to<lb/> customs duties typically at a rate of either 10 or 12%.<lb/> • Customs duties on food products where there is significant local production are undergoing<lb/> scheduled cuts that are typically due to be completed in 2015. These were very high on some<lb/> items and for many will remain significant, even when the reductions are fully implemented. For<lb/> example, duty on beef products was previously 190% but will only drop to 90%; similarly, the<lb/> duty on lamb will drop from 50 to 30% and on sausages from 50 to 22%. Clearly, and<lb/> unfortunately, there is reluctance to remove this dimension of agricultural support entirely.<lb/> • Reductions in customs duties on food items that the authorities have classified as having limited<lb/> local production have already been completed. The rates on these items vary widely such as fish<lb/> (cut from 5 to 3 shekels per kilo) and dried fruit (reduced from 25 to 8%).<lb/></p>

			<figure>• Customs duties on processed food are also undergoing scheduled reductions.<lb/></figure>

			<p>This is an encouraging development. Taxing imported consumer goods may be perceived as<lb/> preferable to taxing domestic production, but this point can be overstated as bringing imported goods to<lb/> customers often involves a sizeable domestic supply chain. Also, such taxes distort consumption patterns,<lb/> unless the price elasticity of demand for the products is zero. The customs duties on food are one of several<lb/> elements in Israel&apos;s substantial and costly support for domestic agriculture (OECD, 2013a) (see below).<lb/> This said the 2013-14 budget introduced new purchase taxes of 15 to 20% on several high-end, luxury<lb/> consumer goods, specifically airplanes, fur clothing, yachts and jet skis. Also, the car purchase tax has<lb/> been increased for high-end vehicles. This somewhat arbitrary selection of items for additional taxation<lb/> represents a largely symbolic gesture at taxing the rich; it is unlikely to raise much revenue or have<lb/> anything but a marginal impact on the progressivity of the tax system.<lb/></p>

			<head>Vehicle taxation: there is room for a better balanced system<lb/></head>

			<p>Israel&apos;s vehicle taxation is among the heaviest in the OECD. Excise plus VAT on gasoline and diesel<lb/> is similar to the levels in many European countries (<ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>). But, what really distinguishes Israel is the<lb/> hefty purchase tax imposed on cars, second only to that in Denmark. The high cost of purchasing and<lb/> running cars for private individuals plus generous tax treatment of company cars has led to a<lb/> disproportionate number of company cars, though recent reforms have seen some downward adjustment<lb/> (see below).<lb/></p>

			<figure>Figure 4.Taxes on gasoline<lb/> 2013 Q1¹<lb/> 1.<lb/> Or latest available period.<lb/></figure>

			<p>(and importers) towards cleaner cars. However, it is clear that the authorities also have revenues very much<lb/> in mind. For instance, a round of adjustments was made as part of fiscal consolidation measures in 2012,<lb/> and another one features in the 2013-14 budget. The bottom line is that the purchase tax, net of discounts,<lb/> remains high. Generally, effective tax rates range between 30 and 83%, averaging about 60% (hybrid cars<lb/> are taxed at a 30% flat rate, plug-in hybrids 20% and fully electrical cars 8%). Aside from being a source<lb/> of revenue there is little merit to such heavy taxation: the distortion in relative prices is substantial, and on<lb/> environmental grounds it makes more sense to target car use rather than ownership. The authorities have<lb/> moved somewhat in the opposite direction on this front with the introduction of the higher basic rate of<lb/> purchase tax on high-end vehicles (applying to vehicles with a pre-tax price of more than NIS 300 000).<lb/> One way of increasing the focus of taxation on vehicle use is via the tax on retail gasoline and diesel.<lb/> Benchmarking Israeli levels of retail gasoline and diesel tax against those elsewhere suggests there is some<lb/> headroom to raise them further while remaining within the range of international experience (<ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>).<lb/> However, as illustrated in the 2011 Economic Survey (OECD, 2011a), justifying middle-to-high tax<lb/> burdens on retail gasoline and diesel on purely environmental grounds either requires an assumption of a<lb/> very high implied price of carbon or taking on board additional externalities (and it may be difficult to<lb/> argue that fuel-based tax is the best way to internalise some of them). In short, pushing up excise on fuels<lb/> is certainly a feasible means of raising fiscal revenue, but the environmental case for doing so in Israel (and<lb/> some other countries) is not strong. Whatever strategy is chosen for fuel excise, pressures to lower it when<lb/> world oil prices are high should be resisted, as that discourages desirable demand and supply adjustments.<lb/> In recent years the authorities have occasionally succumbed to such pressures, causing some problems for<lb/> the treasury.<lb/></p>

			<p>There is also room to improve the relationship between diesel and gasoline taxation. In Israel the tax<lb/> per litre of diesel is similar to that on gasoline, which is more than can be said for many OECD countries.<lb/> This lowers demand for diesel-engine versions of private cars. However, as underscored in OECD<lb/> calculations (for instance, OECD, 2013b), the effective tax rate in terms of energy use or carbon emissions<lb/> is nevertheless lower than that that for gasoline. Thus, the authorities should in principle tax diesel more<lb/> than gasoline.<lb/></p>

			<p>There is also scope to develop other use-based vehicle taxes. To date most road pricing is in the form<lb/> of tolls on sections of road that have been built under build-operate-transfer (BOT) contracts with the<lb/> private sector and is therefore not really designed to manage traffic flows and congestion or contain local<lb/> pollution. One exception is a reserved-lane system operating on the main highway into Tel Aviv from the<lb/> south-east where public transport and some other vehicles (for instance, those with at least three<lb/> passengers) can use the lane for free, while others are charged a fee (which varies according to the current<lb/> volume of traffic). There is considerable scope to develop user charges further, for example, through more<lb/> reserved-lane systems, an urban congestion charge or GPS-based road charging. Progress is being made on<lb/> these fronts. In January 2013 the authorities announced the development of a reserved-lane system on<lb/> another of the main highways into Tel Aviv. Also, the tax authority is currently conducting a feasibility<lb/> study for an urban congestion charge. A recent OECD review of Belgian transport infrastructure<lb/> (OECD, 2013c), which has a similarly high population density to that of Israel, illustrates the challenges<lb/> and possibilities for policy on this front.<lb/></p>

			<p>There has been welcome reduction in the generosity of the tax treatment of company cars (typically<lb/> provided via leasing companies) but further adjustments are needed. For companies, all expenses (leasing<lb/> costs, maintenance and fuel) are tax deductible with no cap. As regards employees, since 2008 a use-value<lb/> (or in-kind income) has been added to taxable income, which varies with the car&apos;s characteristics<lb/> (including emissions) and has been substantially increased since its introduction. And, the tax treatment<lb/> was altered further in 2010 with a switch from seven in-kind income categories to a formula calculating the<lb/> in-kind income as a percentage of the showroom price. Data suggest there has indeed been a behavioural<lb/> response to these reforms. According to the Israeli tax authorities, the share of corporate sales in total car<lb/> purchases fell from 60% in 2006 to 40% in 2012, and it is likely that the tightened legislation drove at least<lb/> part of this trend. Nonetheless, the provision of company cars still remains common. A core problem is that<lb/> the marginal cost to driving a company car for private purposes remains practically zero, as the associated<lb/> recurrent expenses are often covered by the employer. Thus, the advantageous tax treatment, aside from<lb/> implying revenue losses, is also not ideal from an environmental perspective (OECD, 2013d). According to<lb/> the Israeli tax authorities, in the face of higher fuel costs more employers have been voluntarily<lb/> endeavouring to limit their support by, for instance, charging employees for car use beyond a certain<lb/> mileage. However, this should not be viewed as a substitute for further improving the tax treatment of<lb/> company cars. As suggested in the 2011 Economic Survey, one solution is to introduce a cap on corporate<lb/> tax deductibility for fuel expenses, the level of which could be perhaps varied to accommodate occupations<lb/> where mileages covered for work purposes are high (such as delivery staff).<lb/> The fine-tuning of vehicle taxation needs to be accompanied by improvements to alternative transport<lb/> options. Most notably, as OECD Surveys have underscored, public transport has to be sufficiently<lb/> developed to provide feasible alternatives to car use. Rail transport in Israel is particularly underdeveloped;<lb/> progress in building intra-urban rail systems has been slow, and the inter-city network remains limited.<lb/> Without further infrastructure development, ramping up vehicle taxation might fail to elicit a significant<lb/> reduction in the number of car journeys and associated emissions, and could prompt significant opposition<lb/> from the public.<lb/></p>

			<head>Excise duty on wholesale fuel: a potential &apos;universal&apos; carbon tax<lb/></head>

			<p>Israel possesses a ready-made instrument for a carbon tax via the excise that is already charged on<lb/> wholesale primary fuels (heavy oil, natural gas and coal). Practically all domestic GHG emissions originate<lb/> from these fuels (which apart from natural gas are entirely imported) as they are used to generate all<lb/> electricity and provide refined hydrocarbon fuels (such as gasoline and diesel for vehicles). Thus, the<lb/> excise on primary fuels is, in effect, already a carbon tax. However, the excise rates remain well below the<lb/> levels concomitant with prices of carbon that are typically assumed in policymaking, as illustrated in the<lb/> 2011 Economic Survey (OECD, 2011a, p. 113). Proposals to raise the excise to reflect environmental<lb/> externalities were made in 2006, although they were never implemented. Ramping up the excise to reflect<lb/> the shadow price of CO 2 would imply this particular externality is internalised throughout the supply chain.<lb/> Thus, for instance, in the presence of such a tax it would no longer be valid to include the shadow price of<lb/> carbon when performing an environmental account of excise on retail vehicle fuels. Similarly, justifying<lb/> guaranteed feed-in tariffs for renewable energy production on the basis of the shadow price of CO 2 would<lb/> no longer be appropriate. In any case feed-in tariffs are typically much higher than those suggested by the<lb/> shadow price of CO 2 , and other arguments are used to justify them, such as a need to support demand on<lb/> the basis that this promotes technological development that might lead to greater economic viability for<lb/> renewables.<lb/></p>

			<head>Other issues in environmental taxation<lb/></head>

			<p>Outside the energy sector, taxation can play an important role alongside regulatory and other<lb/> measures in ensuring environmental externalities are incorporated into household and business<lb/> decision-making. Environmental tax reform outside the realm of energy does not tend to involve<lb/> adjustment to established bases (where revenues can be fiscally important), but rather the introduction of<lb/> new taxes specifically designed to deal with environmental issues.<lb/> A landfill levy has been one of Israel&apos;s flagship initiatives of recent years, aiming to reflect the<lb/> external costs of this form of waste disposal and make other forms of treatment more competitive. The levy<lb/> varies according to the type of waste; for instance, the highest levy is imposed on the disposal of &quot; sludge &quot;<lb/> ECO/WKP(2014)9<lb/> and the lowest on construction and demolition waste; the low rate on the latter partly reflects a widespread<lb/> problem of illegal disposal. The proceeds are earmarked to finance waste-related developments. For<lb/> example, they have been used to help local authorities set up municipal waste-collection points, run<lb/> education and information systems and build recycling infrastructure. As is almost always the case with<lb/> earmarked funding, there are no strong grounds for believing that the revenues collected will equate with<lb/> the optimal amount of spending, and policymakers therefore need to remain aware of the risk of excessive<lb/> or insufficient funding.<lb/></p>

			<p>The landfill levies have been increased substantially since the scheme was first introduced in 2007,<lb/> and legislated increases are continuing for some forms of waste. Concerns about concentration in the waste<lb/> sector have been voiced and there is the possibility that the price of processing landfill waste may be<lb/> capped to curtail profit margins for landfill operators. This could perhaps be combined with a hike in the<lb/> levy so as to further limit margins and preserve a gap between the cost of landfill and more<lb/> environmentally friendly alternatives.<lb/> Environmental levies also apply to water extraction, quarrying and shipping. Similar to the landfill<lb/> levy, the latter two are linked to dedicated funds (for the restoration of quarries and marine pollution<lb/> prevention, respectively) (OECD, 2011b). As regards air pollution some progress has also been made in<lb/> increasing the role of economic instruments; the Clean Air Act (2008) introduced compulsory emission<lb/> fees and permits for plants with high pollution potential.<lb/></p>

			<head>Household income tax and benefits<lb/></head>

			<p>Household income taxes and benefits account for a significant share of fiscal revenues and<lb/> expenditures, and are an important tool of social policy. The architecture of the Israeli system is similar to<lb/> that in many other OECD countries. Households face progressive PIT plus social-security contributions on<lb/> the one hand, and are potentially eligible for a range of transfer programmes on the other hand, including<lb/> unemployment benefit, general social welfare, child allowances and child support (Tables 3 and 4). In<lb/> addition, recent years has seen the introduction of an earned income tax credit (EITC) for low-income<lb/> households. In terms of budgeting, most welfare benefits are administered by the National Insurance<lb/> Institute (NII), which also receives the social-security contributions directly. Shortfalls in the NII&apos;s budget<lb/> between contributions and spending are made up by central government revenues. Therefore, the<lb/> contributions are, for all intents and purposes, taxation in another name. Compared with other systems,<lb/> social contributions are light, and the welfare pay-outs are not hugely generous, reflecting the parsimony in<lb/> overall civilian public spending.<lb/> Israel&apos;s light tax-benefit system in terms of spending means it is not strongly redistributive. This can<lb/> be seen in comparing Gini coefficients for gross income and for income after adjusting for taxes and<lb/> transfers (net income), where the country has the second-largest degree of overall income inequality in net<lb/> terms but only the sixth largest in gross terms and is close to the United States on both counts (<ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref>). In<lb/> terms of relative poverty, the pre-tax rate is similarly close to that of the United States, but the post-tax<lb/> incidence of relative poverty is substantially higher and indeed is the highest in the OECD area (<ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref>),<lb/> echoing the low spending on social welfare. The bottom line is that any substantial reduction in Israel&apos;s<lb/> rate of relative poverty is likely to involve more public spending.<lb/></p>

			<head>The government&apos;s strategy on personal income tax<lb/></head>

			<p>The cancellation of scheduled cuts in PIT rates and the subsequent increases mark a change of<lb/> direction that Israel&apos;s policymakers would probably not have made, were it not for the fiscal difficulties<lb/> and the political pressures from the tent protests. The planned cuts in PIT, as well as those in CIT, reflected<lb/> a belief that these generate sizeable positive second-round effects in terms of investment and growth. As<lb/> OECD Surveys have argued, lowering top-end PIT rates probably delivered healthy marginal returns<lb/> initially in terms of attracting investment and incentivising labour, but these diminished over time with the<lb/> immediate fiscal consequences of cutting tax rates becoming progressively more prominent.<lb/> While the cancellation of the rate cuts was, on balance, a good move from a fiscal point of view, the<lb/></p>

			<head>Encouraging employment and combating poverty<lb/></head>

			<p>Income tax, particularly those aspects applying to people with low earnings capacity, in combination<lb/> with the generosity, accessibility and qualifying conditions of welfare benefits, govern poorer households&apos;<lb/> disposable incomes and influence their incentives to engage in the labour market. Ensuring that the system<lb/> of taxes and transfers is well designed is particularly important for Israel, given the large number of poor<lb/> households concentrated in the rapidly growing Haredi community and in the Arab-Israeli sector. The issue<lb/> is regularly assessed, for instance in the National Insurance Institute&apos;s Annual Surveys and the Bank of<lb/> Israel&apos;s Annual Reports and has been discussed in several OECD reports (the latest being a follow-up<lb/> review on social policy: OECD, 2013e). Of course the tax-benefit system is not the only area requiring<lb/> attention in order to make progress on reducing poverty. As described by the recent OECD review, the<lb/></p>

			<p>Over the past few years the tax wedge on labour has shifted away from being among the very lowest<lb/> in the OECD distribution, although this is not due to the tax-benefit system per se. Indeed, personal income<lb/> tax and total social security contributions on low-wage earners remain very light. Tax credits plus a low<lb/> bottom rate of tax (for 2013 the rate is 10% for the first NIS 63 360) mean that individuals earning up to<lb/> the average wage (approximately NIS 110 000) pay little or no income tax. Social security contributions<lb/> are also modest; the combined employee and employer contribution rate is only 6.95% up to 60% of the<lb/> average wage and 18.5% on earnings above this amount. Thus, the aggregate tax wedge based on standard<lb/> taxation and social contributions is among the least burdensome in the OECD. Even with the imminent<lb/> increases in tax rates, this wedge will still be low. However, mandatory pension contributions to<lb/> private-sector pension funds ( &quot; second pillar &quot; pensions) were introduced in 2008 with contribution rates<lb/> increasing annually according to a schedule that ends in 2014 (when the total contribution will reach<lb/> 17.5%). OECD simulations show that as of 2012 the tax wedge for a single person earning two-thirds of<lb/> the average wage with no children was only 13% of total labour costs, but 23% once the second-pillar<lb/> pension contribution is included (the &quot; compulsory payment wedge &quot; , <ref type="figure">Figure 8</ref>). Moreover, the latter figure<lb/> is estimated to reach 27% in 2014 due to the further increase in mandated pension contributions. True, the<lb/> pension-contribution component of the wedge probably elicits milder behavioural responses than the<lb/> taxation component, to the extent that individuals view it as a redistribution of their own income over time.<lb/> Also, a tax wedge of this magnitude is still well short of the largest in the OECD area. Nevertheless the<lb/> negative effects of further increases on the demand for and supply of labour and more generally the<lb/> business environment should be a consideration in assessing the pros and cons of further recourse to PIT or<lb/> social contributions as a means of raising revenues.<lb/></p>

			<p>The fact that a significant proportion of Israel&apos;s poor households are very large affects the policy<lb/> issues and complicates any assessment of the tax-benefit system. First, the universal child allowances often<lb/> account for a significant share of income for large households and, consequently, are often at the forefront<lb/> of debate about welfare benefits. The Haredi community&apos;s interest in maintaining generous child<lb/> allowances has, at least in the past, been intense and often influential. Not only are their families typically<lb/> large, but the Income Support Benefit is of limited relevance because most Haredi men study full time and<lb/> are thus ineligible based on the benefit&apos;s employment test. Large cuts were made to the child allowances in<lb/> the early 2000s, but this was followed by some programmed increases. However, the governing coalition<lb/> has reduced child allowances and moved away from universal provision: they were eliminated for those<lb/> with incomes of more than NIS 800 000 per year (i.e. around USD 225 000 or seven times the average<lb/> wage). Abandoning universality is justifiable in terms of spending efficiency in a difficult fiscal situation,<lb/> but with such a high threshold the savings will likely prove small. The reform to the value of the child<lb/> allowances is of some concern. The allowance has been cut to NIS 140 per month for each child,<lb/> previously it was either NIS 175 or NIS 263 (the latter applying to the second, third and fourth child) the<lb/> higher benefits were granted to children born before 2003. The cut in the allowance in itself implies<lb/> significant percentage reductions in the incomes of poor families with many children. However, the cut has<lb/> been made alongside a raft of measures providing positive encouragements to labour force participation<lb/> and skills development, such as the widening of free childcare, plans to revive private-sector job placement<lb/> and the increase in the value of the earned-income tax credit (EITC).<lb/> The presence of a significant number of large families has also to be borne in mind in considering the<lb/> extent and significance of poverty and the capacity of the tax-benefit system to bring these households<lb/> above the standard poverty thresholds. Relative poverty thresholds are commonly calculated as half of<lb/> &quot; standardised &quot; median income (the poverty rate is then the share of households below the threshold). The<lb/></p>

			<table>Two children<lb/> Couple<lb/> 1 earner<lb/> Couple<lb/> 2 earners<lb/> OECD average<lb/> Israel<lb/> standardisation procedure divides household income by an adjusted figure that gives progressively less<lb/> weight to each additional family member (conceptually this is intended to reflect economies of scale as<lb/> households increase in size). OECD relative poverty statistics, for example, use a standardisation weight<lb/> based on the square root of family size, i.e. the marginal weights for each family member are 1, 0.41, 0.32,<lb/> 0.27, etc. (Israel&apos;s National Insurance Institute uses a different</table>

			<p>weighting system in which the marginal<lb/> weights are typically higher). One practical implication is that, for instance, the poverty threshold for a<lb/> couple with six children is 41% higher than that of one with two children under the OECD&apos;s square root<lb/> approach; keeping large households above the poverty line implies a need for generous welfare provisions.<lb/></p>

			<p>There is a need to press ahead more vigorously on some fronts, the EITC in particular. The EITC is<lb/> available to workers with children and/or those aged 55 or over and is a non-wasteable credit: in other<lb/> words, households can receive a payment from the tax authorities if the credit exceeds the value of tax<lb/> otherwise owed. In its pilot phase the credit was twinned with a programme introducing government-<lb/>funded private-sector placement services, which was later cancelled. The EITC has operated nation-wide<lb/> since 2011 and the credit for mothers and single fathers was increased by 50% in 2012. During the pilot<lb/> phase (between 2007 and 2010) the scheme is estimated to have boosted recipients&apos; annual income by 7%<lb/> and to have reduced their incidence of poverty by about 4.5% (Bank of <ref type="biblio">Israel, 2013</ref>). Its subsequent<lb/> extension to the whole country plus the increases in credit amounts will have boosted its impact, but its<lb/> scale remains small. Further increases in the take-up, and possible also the generosity, of the credit are<lb/> required to have an appreciable impact on in-work poverty and incentives to enter the labour force (or to<lb/> increase hours worked among those already employed). Public spending on the credit was only 0.02% of<lb/> GDP in 2011. This figure will have increased since then due to increased take-up and hikes in the credit<lb/> but probably not to the level spent on similar schemes for instance in the United States and<lb/> United Kingdom where the credit costs 0.4 to 0.5% of GDP.<lb/></p>

			<p>Little progress has been made in reforming the disability benefit system, with disappointing take-up of<lb/> a new scheme aiming to encourage employment. As in a number of other OECD countries there are<lb/> concerns that there are fairly significant numbers of disability-benefit recipients who have some capacity to<lb/> work, but that the system neither encourages nor makes it easy for them to so. Gauged by the total number<lb/> of recipients, the problem in Israel has not swelled to the levels seen in some countries but nevertheless<lb/> needs to be tackled. To their credit the authorities have at least been trying to bring about concrete change.<lb/> Reforms in 2009, inter alia, brought a new classification of disability-benefit recipients and the<lb/> introduction of an earnings top-up payment (the Incentive to Work benefit) as an alternative to regular<lb/> disability benefit. The Incentive to Work Benefit includes guarantees permitting a return to full-time<lb/> disability benefit (if, for instance, the individual decides to quit their job) and is, in principle, financially<lb/> attractive. However, take-up has been extremely low – only 3 490 people entered the scheme in 2011 out<lb/> of the approximately 215 000 persons on disability pensions. Seemingly, mistrust of the guarantees<lb/> attached to the scheme and complicated procedures are key reasons for low take-up (OECD, 2013e). Such<lb/> efforts to engage with those already on disability benefits should not be abandoned. Also, there should be a<lb/> focus on new claimants, where reforms are often easier to implement and more effective, and on policies<lb/> encouraging employers&apos; demand for disabled workers. In that vein, new support centres to advise and<lb/> assist employers with disabled workers are planned.<lb/> In addition, tax-benefit policy needs to focus more tightly on the core socio-economic problem: that<lb/> of poor and often large households with weak labour-force attachment. Since the tent protests of 2011,<lb/> middle-class concerns have gained in prominence, and there is a risk that these overly divert policy<lb/> attention and resources away from solving the problems of poverty and wide socio-economic divides. In<lb/> the Israeli context some measures might, prima facie, help both low-and middle-income households but in<lb/> reality largely benefit the latter (and possibly high-income households too). In particular, reductions in<lb/> income-tax rates or social-security contributions, as well as expanding wasteable tax credits, are unlikely to<lb/> relieve poverty or raise work incentives among poor households to any great degree, because a significant<lb/> proportion already pay little or no income tax, whether working or not. For example, the decision to allow<lb/> men to claim child allowance when children are aged up to three years was a good move towards equal<lb/> treatment (though the treatment remains asymmetric as for mothers the allowance applies to older children<lb/> too), but also fiscally costly and largely benefiting middle-and upper-income households. Accompanying<lb/> the extension of the allowance with a reduction in its size would arguably have been a better move.<lb/> Of course, adjustments to taxes and benefits are only one element in the range of possible policies to<lb/> tackle socio-economic problems. For instance, the government is committed to widening access to free<lb/> daycare for infants and to early childhood education, which should help households combine work and<lb/> family life. And, with a view to providing longer-term improvement in living standards for poorer<lb/> communities, policymakers are endeavouring to improve education for Arab-Israeli students and to<lb/> encourage Haredi schools to pay more attention to core subjects, such as maths and languages.<lb/></p>

			<head>Pension reform<lb/></head>

			<p>Israel&apos;s pension system combines a modest publicly funded pay-as-you go pension (the first pillar of<lb/> the system) with favourable tax treatment of pension savings and pay-outs. As mentioned above, since<lb/> 2008 for (almost all) employees there are minimum compulsory contribution rates to private-sector pension<lb/> plans (the system&apos;s second pillar, see <ref type="table">Table 5</ref>). Thus, in broad terms, the authorities have avoided<lb/> significant fiscal commitment. This, combined with favourable demographics, means that public spending<lb/> on pensions has remained relatively low. And, even though population ageing will increase spending in the<lb/> future, public pension spending under current policy settings will remain among the lowest in the OECD<lb/> area.<lb/></p>

			<p>The first pillar of the pension system ensures reasonably adequate support for retirees when<lb/> benchmarked against standard poverty thresholds. However, this is not entirely thanks to the state pension.<lb/> Indeed, as calculations for the 2010 Economic Survey show (p. 128), even with the inclusion of seniority<lb/> payments (<ref type="table">Table 5</ref>), pension income per se probably falls somewhat short of the poverty threshold for<lb/> many retiree households. However, retirees can be eligible for top-up payments referred to as the Income<lb/> Supplement (similar to the Income Support benefit discussed above), and calculations suggest these<lb/> typically ensure retiree incomes are above poverty thresholds (though not by much).<lb/> However, the first-pillar pension is not devoid of problems, most notably a singular failure to reach<lb/> political agreement to bring women&apos;s eligibility age for the state pension up to men&apos;s. Commendably the<lb/> retirement age for men has already been increased to 67 years (this was achieved in 2009). However,<lb/> increases in women&apos;s retirement age have stalled, remaining at 62 since 2009, and a series of increases that<lb/> would bring it to 64 is due to start only in 2017. Among OECD countries it is now extremely rare for<lb/> women&apos;s retirement age to be below that of men and where this is the case for there to be no concrete plans<lb/> to close that gap.<lb/> While the second pillar of the pension system does not involve direct state funding, there are implications<lb/> for taxes and benefits and related issues. As pointed out above, the introduction of compulsory pension<lb/> saving involving both employee and employer contributions in 2008 is similar in some respects to a hike in<lb/> the tax wedge on labour as regards employees&apos; and employers&apos; incentives. Israel&apos;s tax treatment of pension<lb/> saving (or similar forms of saving) comprises partial exemption at the contribution phase, full exemption in<lb/> the accumulation phase, and imposition of PIT (though with some special breaks) at the pay-out phase<lb/> (so-called EET tax treatment). Previous OECD assessment (most recently in OECD, 2013e) has suggested<lb/> the tax treatment should be reviewed. One issue is that introduction of the mandatory pension contributions<lb/> was not accompanied by a revision to tax treatment, with tax relief continuing to apply to the compulsory<lb/> component which is in a sense wasteful tax expenditure. Also, the tax benefit on pension income is in the<lb/> ECO/WKP(2014)9<lb/></p>

			<table>Table 5. Key features of the pension system<lb/> First pillar (state pension and related benefits)<lb/> Retirement age<lb/> Men&apos;s retirement age reached 67 years in 2009. For women the retirement age is currently<lb/> 62 years; a schedule bringing it to 64 years is due to begin in 2017. There are limits on<lb/> earnings while in receipt of a public pension up to age 70 for men and age 67 for women<lb/> (this is being increased to age 70).<lb/></table>

			<p>Contributions<lb/> Total mandatory employee and employer contributions to the NII have several components,<lb/> including one for pensions. The NII&apos;s accounts are fungible in this regard, and the amount of<lb/> contribution has no bearing on the pension pay-out.<lb/></p>

			<head>Coverage<lb/></head>

			<p>Practically universal. Exceptions include immigrants who arrived when over the age of 60<lb/> who are covered by a special arrangement.<lb/> Pay-out<lb/> Pay-outs vary according to household composition and age. For example, as of<lb/> January 2013 for those under 80 years old the pension for a single person was NIS 1 502<lb/> per month and for a couple NIS 2 257 (the pensions are slightly higher for those over 80).<lb/> A seniority increment increases the pension by 2% for each year of full contributions after<lb/> the first 10 years of contributions (with a ceiling on the total increment of 50% of the<lb/> pension). Thus, for instance, including the maximum possible increment, the total pension<lb/> for a single person</p>

			<table>(aged under 80) is NIS 2 253 and for a couple NIS 3 386.<lb/> The &quot; survivors &quot; pension pay-out is similar that of the regular pension.<lb/> Income<lb/> Supplement<lb/> The income-support system guarantees minimum income levels subject to means testing.<lb/> As of 2013, for example, single persons aged 70 to 80 are guaranteed NIS 2 833 and<lb/> couples NIS 4 204.<lb/></table>

			<p>Deductions<lb/> A deduction for medical insurance is made on the basic pension (which is lower if the<lb/> individual is eligible for the Income Supplement).<lb/></p>

			<figure>Second and third pillars (compulsory or voluntary contributions to pension funds or similar)<lb/> Contributions<lb/> Mandatory minimum contributions to the new pension funds (introduced in 2008) apply to<lb/> employees&apos; earnings up to the average gross wage. The contribution rate has been<lb/> undergoing stepped increases and will reach 17.5% (7.5% from employees and 10% from<lb/> employers) by 2014. Five percentage points of the employers&apos; contribution also serves as<lb/> severance insurance.<lb/> Tax treatment<lb/> Tax treatment not only applies to &quot; regular &quot; pension products but also to saving via<lb/> life-insurance and provident-fund products.<lb/></figure>

			<p>Employer contributions are not counted in employees&apos; taxable income (with a ceiling).<lb/></p>

			<p>Employee contributions are subject to a 35% (wasteable) tax credit (with a ceiling).<lb/></p>

			<p>Returns on pension saving are not taxed.<lb/> Pay-outs (annuities) are taxed according to regular income-tax rules except there is: a) a tax<lb/> credit of 35% on the annuity (with a ceiling equal to about 30% of the average wage); and,<lb/> b) an additional tax credit if one&apos;s spouse does not work and has no pension.<lb/></p>

			<p>Other dimensions Tax incentives generally guide the retirement age (or equivalent) set in long-term saving<lb/> products. But there are some regulations too. For example, provident-fund savings can be<lb/> withdrawn only at age 60 or above.<lb/> Defined-contribution pensions include insurance for severance pay, withdrawal of which<lb/> affects the pension pay-out.<lb/></p>

			<p>Pensioners must redeem their pension on a monthly annuitised basis (and not, for example,<lb/> make capital withdrawals), unless the person already has a monthly income of at least<lb/> NIS 4 000 (i.e. about 60% of the average wage).<lb/></p>

			<p>There are portability provisions for switching between savings products (introduced in 2008).<lb/> form of a universal tax credit and is therefore not hugely efficient as a means of combatting pension<lb/> poverty. A further issue is that the returns to the mandated pension saving for low-income households are<lb/> dented, since the income from second-pillar pensions can mean reduced income-support payments as<lb/> pension income is counted in the means test. Adjustments aiming to further encourage pension saving are<lb/> being planned alongside proposals to introduce default portfolios in which investment risk declines as the<lb/> employee ages (the so-called life-cycle approach).<lb/> Parenthetically, scrapping the tax credit for medium-term saving in so-called &quot; advanced training<lb/> funds &quot; (Kranot Hishtalmut) was for a while included in proposed measures for the 2013-14 budget, but<lb/> unfortunately did not make the final budget. The funds have to be held for three years if the savings are<lb/> spent on training or education but if held for at least six years they can be spent on a wide range of goods<lb/> and services, for instance the purchase of cars. As OECD Surveys have pointed out there is practically no<lb/> economic justification for maintaining this particular tax expenditure.<lb/></p>

			<head>Property and capital gains taxation<lb/></head>

			<p>Israel is one of several OECD countries that have no taxes on the value of property in the form of<lb/> wealth tax or on transfers of property through inheritance or gift taxes. Interest income, dividends and<lb/> capital gains are subject to various flat rates of tax. The basic rate of capital gains tax is the same as that for<lb/> corporate income tax, but there are variations depending on the purchase date and the nature of the asset.<lb/> And, as in most other OECD countries, the tax treatment of housing (and real estate in general) differs<lb/> from that on other assets, which has an important influence on rates of home ownership and property<lb/> markets and therefore the focus of this section.<lb/></p>

			<head>Taxation relating to housing<lb/></head>

			<p>In a welcome move the 2013-14 budget pruned exemptions on capital gains from the sale of property.<lb/> The in-depth review of the housing sector in the 2011 OECD Survey was critical of the scope of these<lb/> exemptions, and the budget law has narrowed them considerably: exemptions on capital gains from second<lb/> homes or investment properties have been scrapped entirely (previously there was exemption as long as the<lb/> owner held onto the property for a minimum number of years); and a limit has been placed on the<lb/> exemption from capital gains tax for principal residences.<lb/></p>

			<p>In other respects the tax treatment of owner-occupied housing takes a practical approach. In theory,<lb/> owner-occupiers should be taxed on imputed rental income but allowed to deduct mortgage interest<lb/> payments. However, due to the practical difficulties of establishing imputed rents, the treatment is similar<lb/> to that in some other countries: neither imputed rents nor mortgage interest are taken into account (the<lb/> assumption being that their values are roughly equivalent, although this is not the case once the mortgage<lb/> is paid off). More serious is that up to certain limits private taxpayers renting out properties do not have to<lb/> declare rental income. In addition, the authorities should consider raising the Land Betterment Tax (Hetel<lb/> Hashbacha), which is imposed when the property sold has benefitted from favourable re-zoning; the tax is<lb/> currently 20% of the estimated value of the betterment accrued. Such a move would improve the state&apos;s<lb/> share in the windfall profits from re-zoning and reduce the incentives for property developers to try to<lb/> influence local planning decisions.<lb/></p>

			<p>Transaction costs on purchasing a house have become somewhat heavier: the tax has been increased<lb/> when purchasing investment property or second homes, and a supplementary tax has been introduced for<lb/> high-end property. Given the very wide search for additional revenues in the 2013-14 budget and the<lb/> continued concerns about the strength of house-price rises, these moves are understandable. Although these<lb/> particular measures are very unlikely to have dissuaded household mobility to any great extent, the<lb/> authorities should remain aware of this issue should further hikes in transactions taxes be considered. Also,<lb/> as a measure to cool the property market, the government has been considering a penalty tax on property<lb/> developers if the time between receiving the approval for construction and the sale of all properties in the<lb/> project exceeds three years.<lb/> Revenues from recurrent taxes on immovable property (i.e. housing or other buildings) are among the<lb/> highest in the OECD area (<ref type="figure">Figure 10</ref>, Panel B), representing about 2.25% of GDP and account for the<lb/> majority of property tax (including that on financial assets) (<ref type="figure">Figure 10</ref>, Panel A). Israeli property tax (the<lb/> Arnona) is based on the surface area and type of property and is a significant source of municipal revenues.<lb/> The exploitation of the tax base on immovable property is broadly welcome, given its textbook advantages,<lb/> in particular the low risk of evasion and less distortionary effects on economic behaviour compared with<lb/> other tax bases.<lb/></p>

These taxes are<lb/> levied on land and buildings.<lb/></p>

			<head>Source: OECD tax revenue database and OECD Economic Outlook 94 database.<lb/></head>

			<p>New regulations are in train that, if fully implemented, will double the Arnona on vacant apartments.<lb/> The move is part of wider efforts to increase the supply of housing; in this instance the intention is to<lb/> dissuade property owners from leaving apartments vacant for prolonged periods, which is quite common in<lb/> some localities, especially Jerusalem, where there are substantial numbers of foreign property owners.<lb/> According to the regulation, municipalities will use water-meter data to determine whether the apartments<lb/> are &apos;vacant&apos; and therefore subject to the higher Arnona rate. While this move is perhaps well intentioned,<lb/> prima facie it seems possible that the absent owners may find an easy way around regulation by arranging<lb/> for someone to occasionally run the water for them or by just leaving the tap on a little. Also, those who<lb/> are content with leaving apartments unrented are probably not that price sensitive and so the extra levy<lb/> may not substantially reduce the number of so-called &quot; ghost apartments &quot; , although then it would be an<lb/> efficient revenue-raising base.<lb/></p>

			<head>Company taxes and business subsidies<lb/></head>

			<p>Israeli policy on corporate tax and business subsidies appears to be guided by several objectives:<lb/> i) making the profile of taxes and subsidies attractive to investors, especially foreign investors;<lb/> ii) encouraging scientific R&amp;D and other forms of innovation; iii) promoting regional development; and,<lb/> iv) providing targeted support for the agricultural sector. Any one element of tax or subsidy often reflects<lb/> more than one of these goals. Various factors shape how far each is pursued, most notably the strength of<lb/> revenue pressures and the balance of tax burdens between households and firms. The latter not only<lb/></p>

			<head>Making the profile of taxes more attractive for business<lb/></head>

			<p>In small open economies such as Israel&apos;s the tension between keeping business tax light in the<lb/> interests of investment while accommodating revenue needs and tax-fairness considerations is particularly<lb/> acute because of their intense exposure to capital mobility. As elsewhere, corporate-income taxation<lb/> involves a range of tax breaks (and subsidies), many of which are, in effect, differentiating between<lb/> different degrees of capital mobility, thus helping ease policy tensions by targeting special treatment only<lb/> where it is most required to attract investment. However, the tools for achieving that differentiation are not<lb/> that precise and can result in a complex system that can be hard to communicate and entail high<lb/> administrative costs. As an alternative, some OECD countries have focused on imposing a low statutory<lb/> CIT rate with few base-narrowing rules, tax breaks or subsidies.<lb/> Until 2011 Israeli policy was also heading towards a low statutory CIT rate. It had been on a<lb/> downward track for some years and by 2011 had reached 24%, with further cuts programmed that would<lb/> have brought it to 18% in 2016. As mentioned, revenue concerns and political opposition arising from the<lb/> tent protests saw the schedules of cuts abandoned and followed by an increase from 24 to 25% in 2012,<lb/> with an increase to 26.5% scheduled for January 2014. At that point the rate will probably be once again<lb/> slightly above the (unweighted) OECD average (<ref type="figure">Figure 11</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<figure>Figure 11.

			<p>The negative impact of these developments on the perceived &apos;competitiveness&apos; of the tax system has<lb/> probably not been very large so far. The headline rate has not been increased substantially, and, in any<lb/> case, the attractiveness of the system also depends on the various factors in calculating the CIT base, as<lb/> well as tax breaks and subsidy programmes. The Law for the Encouragement of Capital Investments<lb/> (LECI), the flagship programme on this front, offers CIT rates well below the statutory rate plus other<lb/> support (<ref type="table">Table 6</ref>). Previously this legislation explicitly focused on attracting foreign investment; in its<lb/> current version the eligibility rules assess the firm&apos;s export orientation (whether foreign-owned or<lb/> domestic), a key criterion being that export revenues must account for at least one quarter of turnover<ref type="biblio">.<lb/> 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013</ref> 2014<lb/> 0<lb/> 10<lb/> 20<lb/> 30<lb/> 40<lb/> 50<lb/> Israel¹<lb/> OECD unweighted average²<lb/> OECD minimum<lb/> OECD maximum<lb/></figure>

			<p>Aside from taking into account the details of the tax system, investors also value responsible<lb/> macroeconomic policy.

			<p>Strong revenue pressures and greater public attention to the distribution of the tax burden between<lb/> corporations and households have increased the challenges in presenting a business-friendly tax profile.<lb/> Looking ahead:<lb/> • Further hikes in the CIT rate beyond 2014 could be damaging. Even if the direct impact may not<lb/> be significant, further rises may create the impression that the rate is on an upward trend and<lb/> prompt fears that economic policy in general is becoming less business-friendly. Rate cuts should<lb/> certainly not be dismissed entirely from the policy agenda, even though it may be some time<lb/> before fiscal conditions (and perhaps the political climate too) allow them to resume.<lb/> • There may be avenues for improving the efficiency of some CIT features. For example, the<lb/> LECI&apos;s international competitiveness eligibility rule mentioned above could perhaps be raised so<lb/> as to provide savings and better focus the preferential rates on businesses that are heavily<lb/> exposed to international competition.<lb/></p>

			<p>• There may also be opportunities to develop taxation more fully where activities are inherently<lb/> tied to location, in particular resource extraction. The authorities have already demonstrated a<lb/> capacity for reform in this area with the new tax-royalty regime for natural gas and oil resources<lb/> in 2011 (Box 1). Also as from 2011, businesses engaged in natural resource extraction have been<lb/> precluded from the benefits under the LECI. And, 2013 saw the launch of a committee to re-<lb/>examine tax-royalty regimes for natural resources outside the sphere of natural gas and oil<lb/> (dubbed the Sheshinski II Committee, after its chair).<lb/> • International comparison suggests there is room to reduce tax compliance costs for business.<lb/> According to the World Bank&apos;s Doing Business database Israeli businesses have to deal with a<lb/> comparatively large number of separate payments; 33 in total. According to the Israeli authorities<lb/> 27 of these tax payments can be made online. However, the World Bank data suggest taxpayers<lb/> are nevertheless devoting a considerable number of hours to making these payments (235 hours,<lb/> on average). In contrast, for example, for Ireland eight payments are reported with an average<lb/> time to comply of 80 hours (see later sections). Recognising the need for further progress, the<lb/> authorities aim for only 17 separate payments by end-2015, and ministries have been required to<lb/> make proposals for cutting red tape in the interface between government and business.<lb/></p>

			<head>Box 1. The 2011 reform of the tax-royalty regime for natural gas and oil resources<lb/></head>

			<p>The discovery of substantial offshore hydrocarbon resources (mainly in the form of natural gas) prompted positive<lb/> reform of the tax-royalty regime in 2011 and commitment to establishing a sovereign wealth fund (SWF). The reform<lb/> left the royalty rate itself unchanged but made numerous adjustments and added new features to taxation<lb/> (OECD, 2011a). In particular, a special profit levy is now imposed once the ratio of accumulated revenues over costs<lb/> of a particular gas (and/or oil) field reach a certain level (the levy is often referred to as the Sheshinski tax after the<lb/> person who headed the committee established to recommend reforms to the regime). The plan is to channel the<lb/> Sheshinski tax revenues, which will not become substantial for some years hence, into an SWF. Preparations for this<lb/> are well advanced; as of September 2013 the legislation had completed the parliamentary process. The establishment<lb/> of the fund reflects a welcome effort to ring-fence the public&apos;s share of the hydrocarbon resources and spread the<lb/> returns across generations through a drawdown mechanism. The fund will also be designed to reduce the risk of<lb/> so-called &quot; Dutch disease &quot; by skewing the fund&apos;s portfolio towards foreign-currency assets (the authorities have already<lb/> started combating Dutch-disease effects with the Bank of Israel&apos;s foreign-currency purchase mechanism).<lb/></p>

			<head>Encouraging innovation<lb/></head>

			<p>As elsewhere, R&amp;D activity and innovation in general are encouraged through favourable tax<lb/> treatment and a host of targeted programmes providing grants and other forms of support. Economic<lb/> justification for favouring innovative activity lies in externalities arising from gaps between public and<lb/> private returns to innovation and knowledge spillovers. However, while there is little doubt as to the<lb/> existence of such phenomena, their scale is uncertain, and the underlying processes generating them are<lb/> complex. Therefore, developing effective support programmes (either in the form of tax exemptions or<lb/> grants) requires good systems for monitoring and assessing programme impact and low policymaking<lb/> inertia when it comes to dropping poorly performing schemes or ramping up those that prove successful.<lb/> R&amp;D support programmes in Israel are managed by the Office of the Chief Scientist, which is<lb/> supervised by the Ministry of Economics and Trade. The main programme comprises a system of<lb/> competitively awarded grants. Its design is interesting in that, if the supported R&amp;D project generates<lb/> commercial revenues, then recipients must repay the grant via a deduction comprising a small percentage<lb/> of annual sales. These repayments are an important source of revenues for the Office and therefore the<lb/> system is more akin to high-risk loans than a pure &apos;grant&apos; programme.<lb/></p>

			<p>A number of additional programmes provide tailored support for small-scale start-ups, academic<lb/> research (especially when in conjunction with business) and co-operation between domestic and foreign<lb/> multinationals (<ref type="table">Table 6</ref>). Also, subsidy schemes endeavour to attract companies to base scientific R&amp;D<lb/> centres and R&amp;D in the finance sector in Israel. There is support for business parks for start-ups (so-called<lb/> business incubators) as well. A large number of state-owned incubators were established in the 1990s, the<lb/> vast majority of which were subsequently privatised (of the 24 currently operating only two remain in state<lb/> hands). Government continues to play a significant role, as it partially funds the financial (and other)<lb/> support provided to the entrepreneurs taken on by the incubators.<lb/></p>

			<p>Given the Israeli economy&apos;s impressive scoring on indicators of R&amp;D and high-tech activity (for<lb/> instance, OECD, 2012b), questions naturally arise regarding policy lessons for other countries on R&amp;D tax<lb/> breaks and subsidies. At face value the menu of support on offer in Israel does not differ radically from<lb/> elsewhere, but there may be important differences in detail. Also, there are other forces at work. Training<lb/> with sophisticated technologies during military service, a large pool of researchers in the Jewish diaspora,<lb/> and the engineering and science skills brought by the mass immigration from the former Soviet Union in<lb/> the early 1990s are commonly cited as the key drivers of the economy&apos;s success on this front. Digging<lb/> deeper into this issue requires an in-depth examination of Israel&apos;s innovation performance and policy.<lb/></p>

			<head>Regional development<lb/></head>

			<p>Israel&apos;s tax-subsidy system has fairly strong elements of regional development in that some support is<lb/> either available, or is more generous, only in certain areas of the country (or specific towns). The<lb/> preferential CIT rates provided by the LECI, for instance, are lower in certain regions. And, there is a<lb/> system of employment grants that is available only in some places. As for the other regional incentives<lb/> (such as those provided for housing), there are some sound socio-economic arguments to justify them; for<lb/> instance, promoting the development of poor peripheral areas and as a means of combatting the<lb/> externalities of urban congestion in the centre of the country. However, this is almost certainly not the sole<lb/> motivation for such regional incentives, given Israel&apos;s geopolitical situation.<lb/></p>

			<head>Support for the agriculture sector<lb/></head>

			<p>As mentioned in the context of customs duties above, support for the agricultural sector is significant:<lb/> as of 2012 producer support was estimated at 12% of farm receipts (OECD, 2013a). In addition to the<lb/> tariff-based border protection, agriculture is supported through a number of other channels including:<lb/> implicit subsidies through low rents of state-owned land (almost all land is state-owned), favourable<lb/> charges for water compared to other users, guaranteed prices and sales volumes for producers, direct<lb/> income support, capital grants and subsidised insurance schemes. Such heavy support brings higher<lb/> consumer prices, imposes additional fiscal burdens, curbs structural adjustment toward higher-productivity<lb/> sectors and implies spillovers on foreign trading partners, especially poor countries with plentiful arable<lb/> land. As detailed in a recent OECD assessment (OECD, 2013a), reform initiatives have typically headed in<lb/> the right direction (i.e. lowering support), but implementation is frequently slow. For example, reductions<lb/> in the guaranteed price paid to dairy farmers for raw milk along the lines recommended by the Kedmi<lb/> Committee in 2012 have yet to be implemented.<lb/></p>

			<head>A need for more integrated assessment of targeted business support<lb/></head>

			<p>Viewed as a whole, Israel&apos;s corporate tax and business support is generous, particularly to<lb/> internationally competitive, high tech operations. The principle of support can only be welcomed,<lb/> particularly that aiming to overcome informational barriers and asymmetries between private and public<lb/> returns in innovation. However, it is also important to recognise that, especially when stacked together, tax<lb/> breaks and other forms of support can be overly generous, subsidising much non-incremental activity. The<lb/> preceding paragraphs suggest this could be the case for Israel. For instance, it seems possible that some<lb/> firms can simultaneously benefit from the LECI, the R&amp;D fund and employment subsidies and probably<lb/> enjoy a hefty net subsidy as a result. In light of this, the recent establishment of an inter-ministerial<lb/> committee to examine the costs and benefits of business subsidies is certainly welcome.<lb/></p>

			<head>Evasion, avoidance and administration issues<lb/></head>

			<p>If additional revenues can be raised via enhanced compliance, for instance through more effectively<lb/> tackling tax evasion and aggressive avoidance, this would create room for manoeuvre in tax strategy and<lb/> help fiscal balances in general. The increased attention, both domestically and world-wide, to tax evasion<lb/> and avoidance is providing a political opportunity for renewed policy vigour on this front.<lb/> As in other countries the attention of policymakers, the press and the public has homed in on the<lb/> seemingly low levels of tax paid by some well-known business operations. Particular attention is often<lb/> drawn to companies&apos; &apos;tax optimisation&apos; strategies that erode the corporate tax base by shifting profits<lb/> between tax jurisdictions (base erosion and profit shifting, or BEPS), which has become a focus of OECD<lb/> analysis (OECD, 2013f). Governments, including Israel&apos;s, wish to create attractive environments for<lb/> business on their own terms, through targeted tax incentives and subsidy programmes such as those<lb/> described above, not through companies exploiting unintended loopholes. BEPS may not only imply losses<lb/> in CIT revenue but also put multinational enterprises (MNEs) in an advantageous position over domestic<lb/> firms and distort investment. Also, the perceived unfairness of BEPS risks damaging trust and compliance<lb/> elsewhere in the tax system. However, making progress in addressing these issues can be tough, especially<lb/> when this runs counter to MNEs&apos; vested interests. Recent experience in the taxation of profits (or<lb/> dividends) when transferred out of the country illustrates that resolving these issues is often a bargaining<lb/> outcome, rather than one driven only by economic principles (Box 2). This underscores the importance of<lb/> Israeli policymakers working together with other governments on the BEPS Action Plan to achieve<lb/> international consensus on actions to deal with weaknesses in the international tax system.<lb/></p>

			<head>Box 2. The issue of &quot;trapped profits&quot;<lb/></head>

			<p>Big business often has a degree of bargaining power regarding tax treatment, and Israel is no exception. This<lb/> has been exemplified by the issue of so-called &apos;trapped profits&apos;, which has become prominent. In a previous version of<lb/> the LECI foreign transfer of dividends or profits was subject to capital taxation. As a result, some large companies held<lb/> back from such transfers, accumulating large reserves of assets in Israel. A new version of the law, which came into<lb/> force in 2011, removed this condition, but not retrospectively. The regime for &quot; trapped profits &quot; was offered to<lb/> companies as a non-obligatory complementary measure following the transition from the former version to the current<lb/> LECI. Following consultation with business, an amendment to the LECI was passed in November 2012 under which<lb/> companies that accumulated profits under the former version of the LECI will pay between 40 and 70% of what would<lb/> have been owed under the previous rules when transferring dividends or profits. This non-obligatory measure<lb/> stipulates that the amount of saved tax in increasing the plant in Israel by purchasing more machinery and equipment,<lb/> R&amp;D expenditures or hiring new employees. According to press reports, as of November 2013 the amendment had<lb/> brought NIS 4.4 billion in revenues.<lb/></p>

			<p>The authorities&apos; efforts to tackle the &apos;trapped profits&apos; issue is part of a wider campaign to increase<lb/> revenues and to tackle evasion and aggressive avoidance. Concrete steps on several fronts have being taken<lb/> or are underway, including: media campaigns, increased numbers of staff (an additional 400 relative to a<lb/> total of around 6 000), further development and implementation of e-reporting, computerised systems for<lb/> fraud detection, and strengthening collaboration with other government bodies (for instance, the police)<lb/> and with other countries and international organisations. In addition, a host of technical adjustments to<lb/> legislation and regulation are in train (Box 3). Continued efforts along these lines can only be encouraged.<lb/></p>

			<figure>Box 3. Recent alterations to legislation and regulation aiming to reduce tax evasion and<lb/> aggressive avoidance<lb/> Recent measures taken by the Israeli authorities to close legal loopholes have targeted the following:<lb/> • Financial trusts: contributions from a foreign trust &apos;settlor&apos; (i.e. the person who creates the trust, the donor)<lb/> no longer produce tax-free income for Israeli beneficiaries.<lb/></figure>

			<p>• &quot; Family &quot; companies. Exploitative switching by enterprises in their status for tax purposes between &quot; family<lb/> run &quot; and regular businesses has been stopped. The amendment also explicitly defines the profits eligible to<lb/> be distributed to the shareholder free of tax.<lb/></p>

			<head>•</head>

			<figure>Revaluation gains. Enterprises can no longer avoid two-tiered taxation via revaluation gains. Revaluation<lb/> gains are surpluses &apos;generated&apos; by an increase in the value of assets and were previously subject only to<lb/> dividend tax.<lb/> • Real estate taxation. Legal changes include a narrowing of tax exemptions when property is transferred in<lb/> the form of a gift.<lb/> • Vehicle leasing companies. Unintended tax benefits have been removed and a depreciation rule made less<lb/> generous.<lb/></figure>

			<p>In addition, the campaign to counter evasion includes greater penalties for failing to report items legally requiring<lb/> disclosure, and, aiming specifically at money laundering, reporting requirements for foreign currency dealers have<lb/> been ramped up.<lb/></p>

			<p>Future plans aim to increase the power of the money laundering law, bring in new rules for controlled foreign<lb/> corporations, improve tax debt collection when activities are &quot; rolled over &quot; into a new company and establish a new<lb/> expert analyst unit.<lb/></p>

			<p>The authorities should also contemplate reforms to the institutional and organisational framework of<lb/> revenue collection:<lb/></p>

			<p>• There has been a shift internationally towards establishing more autonomous tax authorities, and<lb/> Israel remains among a handful of countries in which the tax authority (ITA) remains a<lb/> directorate within the Ministry of Finance (or equivalent) (OECD, 2013g). The arrangement<lb/> echoes that of the Capital Market Savings and Insurance Division, a supervisory body that is also<lb/> part of the Ministry of Finance. The establishment of a body that is more independent and<lb/> genuinely outside of the Ministry should be considered, or, if not, there should be some reflection<lb/> as to whether the ITA&apos;s relation with the rest of the Ministry requires adjustment.<lb/> • In Israel, social security revenues are administered separately from the ITA&apos;s administration of<lb/> the tax system. While this approach to revenue collection is also seen elsewhere, a growing<lb/> number of governments have, over the past two decades, integrated the collection of tax and<lb/> social security contributions to improve efficiency and effectiveness and to reduce the<lb/> compliance burden on businesses (OECD, 2013g). Reform along these lines should be considered<lb/> in Israel as part of efforts to reduce the perceived significant revenue leakage arising from<lb/> underground economic activities where incomes go unreported (e.g. cash-in-hand payments to<lb/> casual employees and incomes of self-employed taxpayers) in order to escape both taxation and<lb/> social security contribution liabilities.<lb/> • Increasingly, tax authorities in OECD countries are organising their operations on a &quot; functional &quot;<lb/> basis, inter alia featuring a dedicated division to administer the tax affairs of their largest<lb/> taxpayers. In addition, many have downsized office networks given reduced needs for<lb/> &apos;face-to-face &quot; services arising increasing use of modern electronic services. The potential for<lb/> further reforms in these areas should also be considered.<lb/></p>

			<p>Other avenues for improving the effectiveness and efficiency of tax administration should continue to<lb/> be pursued. These include embedding risk-management approaches for improving compliance across all<lb/> segments of taxpayers and enhancing the quality of services provided. Policy efforts regarding the latter<lb/> should focus on further developing and encouraging use of electronic services, especially web information<lb/> and systems for the electronic filing and payment of taxes, and to encourage their use.<lb/></p>

			<head>Box 4. Recommendations on taxes and transfers<lb/></head>

			<p>Indirect tax<lb/> • Should the regressivity of VAT require a policy response, use existing social welfare mechanisms rather than<lb/> recourse to multiple VAT rates. Renew efforts to remove the existing exemptions on fruit and vegetables and<lb/> services in Eilat.<lb/></p>

			<p>• Press on with the scheduled reductions in customs duties on consumer goods and food items, and maintain a<lb/> strategic goal for further liberalisation.<lb/></p>

			<head>•</head>

			<figure>Keep the &apos;green credits&apos; but cut the basic rate of purchase tax on vehicles. Shift instead to taxing vehicle use,<lb/> such as by fee-based reserved lane systems and urban congestion charging. Further tighten the tax treatment<lb/> of company cars. Accompany these moves by expanding alternatives to car use.<lb/> • Consider an economy-wide carbon tax by increasing the existing excise tax on primary fuels to levels<lb/> concomitant with the estimated GHG-emissions externalities.<lb/> • Continue to develop environmental levies. Remain aware of the risk of under-or over-funding from<lb/> earmarking the revenues from such levies for particular areas of spending.<lb/></figure>
