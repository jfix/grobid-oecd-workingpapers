			<head>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY<lb/></head>

			<p>This study updates previous OECD work on export restrictions. Its main purpose is to provide<lb/> information on the present situation regarding the use of export restrictions and international disciplines on<lb/> the measures. New material provided here is mostly based on WTO Trade Policy Review (TPR) papers.<lb/> Export restrictions are maintained to achieve diverse policy objectives, including environmental<lb/> protection or conservation of natural resources, promotion of downstream processing industries,<lb/> controlling inflationary pressures, and for fiscal receipts reasons. Export restrictions take various forms<lb/> such as export duties, minimum export prices, and reduction of VAT rebates which directly affect export<lb/> prices. Other forms include export bans, quotas, and licensing requirements which affect export volumes.<lb/> A number of trends concerning the use of export restrictions can be identified from a review of WTO<lb/> TPR country reports. One observes, for example, that the percentage of countries applying export duties<lb/> over the period 2003-2009 was higher than in previous years and that such duties were introduced<lb/> primarily by developing and least developed countries; examples of items most subject to export duties<lb/> were mineral and metal products, forestry, fishery and agricultural products, as well as those made from<lb/> leather, hide and skin. It also becomes apparent that when compared to export duties, quantitative<lb/> restrictions were more broadly used for social policy objectives, such as environmental protection or<lb/> conservation of natural resources.<lb/></p>

			<p>Under the current WTO rules, unlike quantitative export restrictions which are in principle prohibited,<lb/> there is no substantive discipline on export duties, although there have been efforts to revise this at the<lb/> multilateral and bilateral levels. The WTO accession process does impose, however, several disciplines as<lb/> evidenced by the Chinese accession process. Export restrictions have been also discussed during the DDA<lb/> negotiations in both NAMA (Non-Agricultural Market Access) and agriculture negotiations. Several<lb/> regional trade agreements (RTAs) went beyond the WTO by including prohibition of export duties.<lb/> Export restrictions result in losses of efficiency by inducing too much production in the exporting<lb/> country&apos;s downstream industry. Such measures also have income redistribution effects by penalizing<lb/> exporters of the restricted product while benefiting domestic processing industries. The measures create a<lb/> differential between the price available to domestic processors and the price charged to foreign processors,<lb/> and thus provide domestic processing industries with an advantage.<lb/></p>

			<head>I.<lb/> Introduction<lb/></head>

			<p>1.<lb/> In recent years, export restrictions have continued to attract the attention of trade policy makers,<lb/> both as a perceived means to achieve certain objectives and because of perceived gaps in international<lb/> disciplines on their use. For example, following the peso devaluation in 2002, Argentina once again<lb/> applied export duties to all exports in order to cushion the effects of exchange-rate fluctuations on<lb/> domestic products and to counter the sharp fall in tax revenue. After successive increases in rates, the<lb/> applicable duties were 5, 20, 15, 20, 25 and 45% (depending on products) as of mid-2006. 1 In 2007, China<lb/> eliminated value added tax (VAT) rebates on exports for 553 items to restrain the export of products<lb/> regarded as highly energy consuming, highly polluting, and consuming large amount of raw materials. 2<lb/> Since 1999, Cameroon has gradually prohibited exports of logs in order to promote the processing<lb/> industry. From 1999 until the prohibition of log exports in 2004, a certificate of registration had to be<lb/> obtained to export timber; this was intended to ensure that 70% of production was processed locally and<lb/> only 30% of the annual harvest exported as logs. 3 These examples display various objectives and methods<lb/> by which governments apply export restrictions.<lb/> 2.<lb/> By affecting the price and quantity of trade, export restrictions produce trade distorting effects in<lb/> the same way as import restrictions, but their incidence differs. However, multilateral disciplines on export<lb/> restrictions are not as clearly defined as those on import restrictions. The WTO accession negotiation in<lb/> general complemented disciplines on export restrictions, especially regarding export duties. During the<lb/> Doha Development Agenda (DDA) negotiations, countries communicated their positions on the scope and<lb/> modalities of future negotiations, inter alia in the case of export restrictions. Bilateral negotiation of RTAs<lb/> has been another channel for providing more discipline.<lb/> 3.<lb/> On the basis of this background, this paper offers an overview of the current situation, as well as<lb/> updating two previous papers on export restrictions which described the situation as of 2002. 4 The present<lb/> paper analyses factual information of such measures based on Trade Policy Review (TPR) reports and<lb/> describes key findings. Current discipline on export restrictions in the WTO is examined. It also analyses<lb/> recent trends with respect to disciplines at both the bilateral and multilateral levels. Finally, this paper<lb/> provides policy considerations regarding such measures.<lb/></p>

			<head>II.<lb/> Definition<lb/></head>

			<p>4.<lb/> Defining the term &quot; export restriction &quot; is the first challenge. A panel under the WTO Dispute<lb/> Settlement Understanding, in the context of the application of the Subsidies and Countervailing Measures<lb/> (SCM) Agreement, delineated the scope of &quot; export restraint &quot; as &quot; a border measure that takes the form of a<lb/> government law or regulation which expressly limits the quantity of exports or places explicit conditions<lb/> on the circumstances under which exports are permitted, or that takes the form of a government-imposed<lb/> fee or tax on exports of the products calculated to limit the quantity of exports. 5 &quot; The WTO&apos;s Trade Policy<lb/> 1.<lb/> See WTO Trade Policy Review Report by the Secretariat on Argentina (WT/TPR/S/176).<lb/> 2.<lb/> In China, exporters are entitled to VAT rebates although VAT is not necessarily rebated fully on exports.<lb/> When VAT rebate rates on exports are lower than the VAT rates actually paid, the difference between the two<lb/> rates constitutes a levy on</p>

			<table>exports. See WTO Trade Policy Review Paper on China (WT/TPR/S/199).<lb/> 3.<lb/> See WTO Trade Policy Review Report by the Secretariat on Cameroon (WT/TPR/S/187).<lb/> 4.<lb/> Analysis of non-tariff measures: the case of export duties, TD/TC/WP(2002)54/FINAL and Analysis of non-<lb/>tariff measures: the case of export restrictions, TD/TC/WP(2003)7/FINAL.<lb/></table>

			<p>5.<lb/> This case deals with the relation between export restrictions and subsidy. The question was whether US<lb/> regulations that treat a restraint on exports of a product as a subsidy to other products made using or<lb/> incorporating the restricted product was consistent with the WTO SCM Agreement (WT/DS194/R).<lb/> Review (TPR) papers deal with export restrictions in the section on &quot; measures directly affecting exports. &quot;<lb/> Under this heading, in addition to export-incentive measures (i.e. export subsidies; duty and tax drawback;<lb/> export processing zone; export finance, insurance and guarantees; and other export promotion measures),<lb/> the TPRs cover export-restrictive measures (typically, export prohibitions, export quotas, export licensing,<lb/> export duties and levies, and minimum export prices). Considering the fact that minimum export price and<lb/> reduction of VAT rebates have similar effects as other traditional export restrictions, this paper follows the<lb/> broader definition of export restriction used in the WTO TPR papers.<lb/> 5.<lb/> One of the most popular forms of export restrictions is export duties. This paper makes no<lb/> distinction between the terms &quot; export duties &quot; and &quot; export taxes. &quot; Both are used here in the sense of<lb/> (customs) duties on export. This does not include tax credit on exports, which might be well discussed as<lb/> export subsidies in the context of the Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures. A variety of<lb/> similar or complementary terms also exist, such as export tariffs, export fees, export charges, and export<lb/> levies. However, this paper prefers &quot; export duties &quot; or &quot; export taxes &quot; to the others.<lb/> 6.<lb/> Export duties can take different forms. It can be an ad valorem tax, specified as a percentage tax<lb/> of the value of the product; or a specific tax, specified as a fixed amount to pay per unit of a product. All<lb/> types of export taxes have the effect of raising the cost of exports, and thereby reducing the volume of<lb/> exports. 6 As shown below, minimum export price and reduction of VAT rebate rates may produce effects<lb/> similar to export duties.<lb/> 7.<lb/> Other forms of export restrictions directly affect the quantity of exports. The most extreme case<lb/> of restrictions is export prohibition. Export quotas are restrictions or ceilings imposed by an exporting<lb/> country on the total volume of certain products. Export license requirements establish that an application or<lb/> other documentation should be submitted as a condition for exportation and depending on whether license<lb/> acquisition is automatic, the requirements may affect the volume of exports. However, despite the<lb/> potentially negative impact on exports, export licensing has drawn relatively less attention, partly because<lb/> it is difficult to acquire information on this measure. Enhancing transparency on export licensing was<lb/> proposed during the WTO DDA negotiations.<lb/></p>

			<head>III.<lb/> Use of export restrictions during 2003-2009<lb/></head>

			<p>8.<lb/> The most systematic information available on export restrictions is found in Trade Policy Review<lb/> (TPR) country reports. TPR reports of WTO members include a section on measures affecting exports, and<lb/> more or less address export duties, quotas, licensing and other similar measures. The contents vary<lb/> reflecting each country&apos;s situation at the time the reviews were undertaken. Therefore, it is difficult to<lb/> compare between members and to draw quantitative conclusions; certain tendencies can be observed,<lb/> however, from these reports.<lb/></p>

			<head>A.<lb/> Export duties and other measures affecting export prices<lb/></head>

			<p>9.<lb/> The number of countries applying export duties (65 of 128 WTO members) during 2003-2009 is<lb/> higher than it was in the previous analysis (39 of 100 WTO Members during 1997-2002). On a regional<lb/> basis, the increase in the number of countries imposing export duties is clear regarding the Americas and<lb/> 6.<lb/> Export duties should be distinguished from fees and formalities, prohibiting fees and other charges rendered in<lb/> connection with exportation (or importation) that are addressed under Article VIII (a) of the GATT 1994. It<lb/> stipulates that fees and other charges shall not represent an indirect protection to domestic products or a<lb/> taxation of imports or exports for fiscal purposes. It applies to all fees and fomalities whatever its nature, but<lb/> explicitly states that &quot; export duty &quot; is excluded from the application. Therefore, a distinction should be drawn<lb/> between export duties and fees or charges, even though in specific cases the substance of the measures might<lb/> be similar and thus difficult to distinguish.<lb/> <ref type="biblio">Africa, where in 1997-2002</ref> the numbers were 9 out of 26 and 17 out of 26 countries respectively. 7 As was<lb/> the case in the earlier 2002 analysis, export duties were imposed mainly by developing and least developed<lb/> countries during 2003-2009 period (Table 1).<lb/> Table 1. Number of countries applying export duties, by regions and other groupings<lb/> (2003-2009)<lb/> Number of WTO Members<lb/> reviewed by TPRB<lb/> WTO Members imposing<lb/> export duties<lb/> Europe/Middle East<lb/> 39<lb/> 4<lb/> America<lb/> 31<lb/> 18<lb/> Asia/Pacific<lb/> 23<lb/> 13<lb/> Africa<lb/> 35<lb/> 30<lb/> Total<lb/> 128<lb/> 65<lb/> LDCs<lb/> 25<lb/> 21<lb/> OECD<lb/> 31<lb/> 4<lb/> Others<lb/> 72<lb/> 40<lb/></table>

			<p>Note: TPR reports from 2003 to 2009. Some Members were reviewed two or three times, but are here counted as one. The EU is<lb/> counted as 25 (considering 2 other countries were under TPR review during this period before they became EU members).<lb/></p>

			<head>10.<lb/></head>

			<p>The items most affected by export duties are agricultural products, mineral and metal products,<lb/> leather, hide and skin products, forestry products, and fishery products. (<ref type="table">Table 2</ref>)<lb/></p>

			<table>Table 2. TPR Summary of current situation on export duties,<lb/> by product (2003-2009)<lb/> Selected products<lb/> Number of WTO members applying export duties<lb/> (based on 65 TPRs)<lb/> Forestry products<lb/> 15<lb/> Fishery products<lb/> 13<lb/> Mineral products, metals, precious stones<lb/> 28<lb/> Leather, hides and skins<lb/> 17<lb/> Agricultural products (sugar, coffee, etc)<lb/> 36<lb/> TPR reports do not specify precise HS number of products subject to export duties. Therefore, this classification is based upon the<lb/> description of the products in the reports. In this table, hides and skins have been grouped with leather rather than agricultural<lb/> products. Products listed are not exhaustive; Comprehensive details are in Annex 1.<lb/></table>

			<head>B.<lb/> Quantitative restrictions<lb/></head>

			<p>11.<lb/> TPR country reports describe export prohibitions and export licensing in various ways. Because<lb/> of the variety of length of the sections in the member reports, it is hard to analyse these points<lb/> quantitatively, although certain tendencies can be observed. It is noted that no systematic distinction<lb/> between automatic and non-automatic export licensing is made in these reports and that export prohibitions<lb/> and licensing are being reviewed jointly.<lb/></p>

			<table>12.<lb/> In many cases, quantitative restrictions are applied by governments in relation to Articles XI:1(a),<lb/> XX and XXI of GATT 1994. This includes conservation of exhaustible natural resources, environmental<lb/> 7.<lb/> The Members reviewed in previous and present analysis are different, and the increase in the numbers results<lb/> partially from the fact that there were Members not subjected to analysis during 1997-2002. Still, several<lb/> Members which did not maintain export duties during 1997-2002 applied new measures during 2003-2008.<lb/> protection, and control of weapons and arms trade. Where there are multilateral agreements or<lb/> arrangements, the legitimacy of export restrictions is well recognised, particularly in such areas as security,<lb/> life, public health, safety and environmental reasons. A good example is CITES, the convention on<lb/> international trade of endangered species of fauna and flora. This explains why most WTO members<lb/> maintain quantitative restrictions regarding exports of some products. Even countries which do not apply<lb/> export duties generally maintain quantitative restrictions on some exports. To a lesser degree, quantitative<lb/> restrictions are used for industrial policy objectives to help develop higher value-added downstream<lb/> industries. (See Annex 2 for comprehensive details.)<lb/> 13.<lb/> In OECD (2003), around 20 Members described export quotas in response to restrictions by<lb/> importing members under the WTO Agreement on Textiles and Clothing (ATC). However, 1 January 2005<lb/> marked the end of the ten-year transition period towards the elimination of quantitative restrictions on<lb/> imports of textile and clothing under the WTO ATC. Therefore, export quotas for this purpose disappeared<lb/> in many countries. International commodity agreements or arrangements are also stated as justification for<lb/> measures taken for agricultural products — such as sugar and coffee — diamonds and crude oil. 8<lb/> Box 1. Illustrative list of rationales for export restrictions in TPRs<lb/> 1. Export restrictions for non-economic reason: security<lb/> • The United Nations Security Council Resolutions (e.g. sanctions against particular countries)<lb/> • The Convention on Chemical Weapons<lb/> • The Treaty on Nuclear Non-Proliferation<lb/> • Multilateral export control arrangements (the Australia Group (to prevent the spread of chemical and<lb/> biological weapons); the Missile Technology Control Regime; the Nuclear Suppliers Group; the Zangger<lb/> Committee (control of nuclear materials and related high technology); the Wassenaar Arrangement (control<lb/> of exports of conventional weapons and dual use products)<lb/> 2. Export restrictions for non-economic reason: life, public health, safety, and environmental reason<lb/> • The Basel Convention on the Transboundary Movement of Hazardous Waste and their Disposal<lb/> • The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Fauna and Flora (CITES)<lb/> • The Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer<lb/> 3. Export restrictions for economic reasons but in accordance with international or bilateral agreements or<lb/> arrangements<lb/> • International commodities agreements on sugar, coffee, and petroleum<lb/> 4. Export restrictions for maintenance of adequate supply of essential products; or for promotion of<lb/> downstream industries<lb/> • Forestry products (such as log, timber)<lb/> • Fishery products (including seasonable restraint for a biological rest period of fish)<lb/> • Mineral products, metals, precious stones<lb/> • Hides and skins and leather<lb/> • Agricultural products (seasonal measures are introduced in some cases).<lb/> Note: This list is illustrative, not exhaustive.<lb/> 8.<lb/> For example, the Kimberley Process Scheme certifies the origin of rough diamonds so as to prevent rebel<lb/> groups and their rivals from financing their war from diamond sales.<lb/> C.<lb/> Major policy objectives<lb/> 14.<lb/> The major policy objectives of export restrictions are:<lb/> •<lb/> Fiscal receipts or revenue purposes (export duties).<lb/> o Export duties may be seen as a reliable source of revenue, particularly in LDCs. 9 The<lb/> relative ease of implementing tax regulations through customs may make this an attractive<lb/> option for governments. Especially when international price is high, applying high tax<lb/> rates is sometimes used to address equity issues.<lb/> o This source of revenue is becoming less important for many countries. Although TPR<lb/> reports do not provide consistent data for all countries, the share of export duties in<lb/> government revenue is falling in several countries. In Ghana, the share of export duties in<lb/> total government revenue decreased from 11.4% (1998) to 2.3% (2005). In Thailand, the<lb/> contribution of export taxes to government revenue was only 0.3% of total tax revenue in<lb/> 2005/06. The Philippine authorities also indicated that revenue from export taxes was<lb/> minimal.<lb/> o The exception is Argentina. Between 2002 and 2005, income from export duties<lb/> represented 9.9% of total public revenue. Following the peso devaluation in 2002, all<lb/> Argentine exports were again made subject to export duties. Since 2002, successive<lb/> resolutions have altered export tax rates, with increases on a significant number of<lb/> products. As of mid-2006, the applicable duties were 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 and 45% on the<lb/> f.o.b. value, depending on the products in question. However, during the TPR Q&amp;A in<lb/> 2007, several Members questioned the necessity of this high tax rates considering change<lb/> of the economic situation during the last five years.<lb/> •<lb/> To protect and promote downstream processing industries by providing domestic industries with<lb/> cheap raw materials and inputs.<lb/></table>

			<p>o Even in cases where countries do not present this as an explicit policy objective, this can<lb/> be a major implicit motivation for export restrictions. Either export duties or quantitative<lb/> restrictions are used for this purpose. 10 Still, considering the fact that the price differential<lb/> between domestic and export price is the key component for this purpose, export duties are<lb/> preferred for this purpose.<lb/> o Export restrictions provide downstream processing industries with an advantage.<lb/> Differential export duty rates play an important role in this regard: higher rates for raw<lb/> materials or input products while lower rates apply for finished products. For example, in<lb/> Argentina the export duty rates for soybean, soybean oil and biodiesel were 27.5%, 24.5%,<lb/> and 5% respectively as of</p>

			<table>2007. 11 The price advantage provided to domestic downstream<lb/> 9.<lb/> Among the 25 LDCs under TPR review between 2003-2009, 21 countries maintained export duties.<lb/> 10.<lb/> For example, the WTO TPR paper provided that one of the major objectives of Indonesia&apos;s quantitative<lb/> restrictions was to promote higher value-added downstream industries. Mongolia&apos;s export prohibition of raw<lb/> hides and cashmere was also maintained to protect domestic processors.<lb/> 11.<lb/> The rationale for differential export taxes was discussed during TPR process. When asked for the reason for<lb/> maintaining differential export taxes, Argentina stated that its existence and permanence was closely linked to<lb/> the payment capacity of each industry. Argentina further provided that the export tax rate differential was an<lb/> industries can distort and reduce competition in both domestic and foreign markets.<lb/> (OECD, 2009c).<lb/> •<lb/> Social policy objectives, such as environmental protection or conservation of natural resources<lb/></table>

			<p>o This is the most popular and basic policy objective of quantitative restriction on exports.<lb/> For these objectives, limiting the volume of trade is the key factor and that is why<lb/> quantitative restrictions are preferred in this regard. Still, to a lesser degree, export duties<lb/> are also used to achieve these policy objectives. 12<lb/> o As stipulated in Article XX of GATT 1994, this objective is consistent with WTO rules<lb/> under certain conditions. 13 Therefore, even quantitative restrictions, which are generally<lb/> prohibited, can be justified if such measures meet certain conditions of WTO provisions.<lb/> o During the questions and answers exercise of the TPR, the Chinese government explained<lb/> that the application of interim export duties and the reduction of VAT rebates were aimed<lb/> at reducing exports of products that are highly energy consuming and polluting. Some<lb/> Members questioned the effectiveness of these measures, displaying concern that such<lb/> measures could result in increased domestic supply of products without a reduction in<lb/> production. 14 The Indonesian government stated environmental conservation as the<lb/> rationale for its export taxes on logs. In response to this justification, the TPR report<lb/> pointed out that lowering domestic log prices by export taxes would encourage processors<lb/> to expand production, but reduce the financial incentives for processors to adopt efficient,<lb/> less wasteful technology and processing practices, and that the incentives for owners of<lb/> natural resources to engage in conservation practices were diminished. Therefore, the<lb/> export taxes risk reducing incentives both for owners and processors to conserve and use<lb/> natural resources efficiently. 15<lb/> o Objectives such as conservation of natural resources could be effectively addressed with<lb/> export restrictions if they actually result in a production decrease. However, without<lb/> corresponding measures to restrain domestic consumption, an export restriction does not<lb/> always lead to a decrease in production (OECD, 2009b). 16 In this regard, regulation on<lb/> production itself, rather than on trade, is an alternative option considering that market<lb/> instrument permitted by WTO rules and was equivalent to taxes on imports or the tariff escalation applied by<lb/> the majority of importing countries to stop entry of processed products.<lb/> 12.<lb/> According to the TPR report on Angola, the authorities indicated that export duties were levied for the purpose<lb/> of environmental protection, particularly of flora and fauna.<lb/></p>

			<table>13.<lb/> This policy consideration is reflected in Article XX(g) of GATT 1994 which allows exceptional quantitative<lb/> restrictions if such measures are made effective in conjunction with restrictions on domestic production or<lb/> consumption.<lb/> 14.<lb/> See WTO Trade Policy Review Minutes of Meeting on China (WT/TPR/M/199/Add.1)<lb/> 15.<lb/> See WTO Trade Policy Review Report by the Secretariat on Indonesia (WT/TPR/S/184)<lb/> 16.<lb/> Although China applied export restrictions on molybdenum for conservation purposes, the production of<lb/> molybdenum in China has risen continuously, making the measure ineffective in fulfilling the stated policy<lb/> objective.<lb/> imperfections arise in the production stage regardless of the domestic or international<lb/> destination of the products. 17<lb/></table>

			<p>•<lb/> Controlling inflationary pressures and securing domestic supply (especially regarding agricultural<lb/> products for food security).<lb/> o An increase in the international price of a commodity may create inflationary pressures.<lb/> Several governments rely on export restrictions as a policy tool to keep inflation under<lb/> control and thus maintain stable price for basic products. An export restriction, by<lb/> increasing domestic supply, reduces the domestic price of the product, thus partially<lb/> offsetting the inflationary pressures coming from higher prices abroad. 18 However, such<lb/> measures when applied by large countries that can influence world prices can have a<lb/> negative impact on the welfare of trading partners, especially those of small countries, by<lb/> reducing the supply to the world market and thus amplifying the negative aspects of the<lb/></p>

			<table>initial high price (OECD, 2009c).<lb/> o Several governments responded to high food prices in 2007/08 with more trade-friendly<lb/> policy options. One of the most common policy responses has been to reduce or suspend<lb/> import tariffs on food products. Another response has been targeted cash transfers to<lb/> vulnerable groups. (FAO, 2008 and OECD, 2009a)<lb/> •<lb/> Other objectives: improving terms-of-trade and counteracting tariff escalation.<lb/> o An export tax on a particular commodity can improve the country&apos;s terms-of-trade — the<lb/> relative price of a country&apos;s exports compared to its imports — when applied by a large<lb/> country that has market power. Such a measure increases the world price of the<lb/> commodity, thus allowing the country to import more for each unit of the exported<lb/> commodity.<lb/></table>

			<p>o Many developing countries, which represent a small fraction of world exports in a<lb/> particular commodity, do not possess such market power. This objective can be achieved<lb/> under the assumption that other countries do not retaliate by raising tariffs themselves<lb/> (<ref type="biblio">Piermartini, 2004</ref>). Considering the difficulty of calculating optimal tax rates, there is also<lb/> a risk that application of too high rates will lead to a large welfare loss of the exporting<lb/> country (<ref type="biblio">Piermartini, 2004 and OECD, 2009c</ref>).<lb/> o Export restrictions can also be used to counteract tariff escalation by importing countries.<lb/> Tariff escalation is the practice of charging higher import tariffs on processed goods than<lb/> on unprocessed ones. The use of export taxes was suggested by several countries as a<lb/> policy choice to reduce the impact of tariff escalation on their exports of</p>

			<table>processed<lb/> products.<lb/> 17.<lb/> As the world&apos;s leading producer and supplier of copper, Chile responded to resource depletion by applying a<lb/> mining tax on the operating income of mine operators rather than relying on export restrictions. (OECD,<lb/> 2009c)<lb/> 18.<lb/> For example, in Argentina, MEP Resolution No. 114 of 8 March 2006 suspended exports of bovine livestock,<lb/> of the hoof, and of certain cuts and preparations and preserves of bovine meat for a period of 180 days. The<lb/> government justified this measure as necessary to maintain the stability of beef prices in the face of price<lb/> increases caused by external demand. Kazakhstan applied a temporary ban on wheat export in 2008 for the<lb/> same reason.<lb/></table>

			<p>o A study of tariff data suggests that the degree of escalation differs greatly across countries<lb/> and the tariff escalation found in some developing countries is more prominent than in<lb/> developed countries (<ref type="biblio">Piermartini, 2004</ref>). Furthermore, to be an effective countermeasure,<lb/> the application of export taxes should focus on countries with the most significant level of<lb/> tariff escalation. However, in most cases identical duty rates are applied among importing<lb/> countries, therefore making the effectiveness of this approach doubtful.<lb/> 15.<lb/> Although several governments apply export restrictions to achieve diverse policy objectives<lb/> indicated above, not all governments rely on these measures but use instead alternative policy options with<lb/> different trade impacts. This leads to the question of whether export restrictions are the most effective<lb/> option in achieving policy objectives and whether the measures achieve the objectives in the least trade<lb/> distorting ways compared with alternative options.<lb/> 16.<lb/> Normally, export duties are applied on a limited number of products. However, in some<lb/> countries, export duties are applied generally covering all products. Especially among the LDCs, a general<lb/> export tax is more widely used as evidenced in Bangladesh, Chad, Gambia, and Niger for example. When<lb/> generally used, the rates tend to be in the low range. For example, both Bangladesh and Pakistan applied a<lb/> general export tax of 0.25%, and Cameroon applied a general 2% export tax. In several countries, actual<lb/> tax rates are lower than statutory rates, and administrative bodies can raise applied rates under the ceiling<lb/> rates without the legislative body&apos;s approval or consent. 19 This creates an element of uncertainty.<lb/> 17.<lb/> Export duties, export quotas, and other forms of restrictions can be applied simultaneously so that<lb/> the overall assessment of measures is necessary to understand their total implications. For example, in<lb/> 2005 China removed an 8% VAT rebate for exports of primary aluminium and, in addition, imposed a 5%<lb/> interim export tax. Reducing VAT rebate rates has the same effect as export duties in that they raise the<lb/> cost of exports, resulting in reduced exports volume. One interesting point regarding reduction of VAT is<lb/> that such measures are aimed at curbing exports while VAT rebate schemes for exports normally work as<lb/> export stimulus.<lb/> 18.<lb/> Minimum export prices are applied either to achieve target export prices which are set to control<lb/> world market prices or to facilitate customs procedure – preventing under-invoicing. According to TPR<lb/> reports, the minimum export prices applied in the Philippines for rice and corn could have similar<lb/> economic effects as export taxes. In Brazil, however, a minimum export price was not used except as a<lb/> base to calculate export taxes. It is not clear, in some cases, whether minimum export prices are binding in<lb/> nature or just reference prices.<lb/> 19.<lb/> Export restrictions of one country may induce similar measures from other exporting countries.<lb/> Once an export restriction is applied, it is likely that importing countries will shift their source of imports<lb/> to other countries (<ref type="biblio">Dollive, 2008</ref>). The other exporting countries may then be forced to apply similar<lb/> measures in order to meet domestic demand by limiting their exports. 20 For example, according to<lb/> 19.<lb/> For example, Pakistan can impose regulatory duties up to 100% on exports without parliamentary approval.<lb/> Egypt, although it does not currently impose export duties, can apply export tax up to 100% at any time<lb/> according to the relevant regulation. In Thailand, the persistence of relatively high statutory export taxes<lb/> leaves an element of uncertainty, as export taxes on important products, such as rice or rubber which are<lb/> subject to 0% export tax, could in principle be reintroduced up to the level of statutory rates (10% for rice,<lb/></p>

			<table>40% for rubber) without legislative approval.<lb/> 20.<lb/> A similar case can be also found in Ukraine. Ukraine applied wheat export restraints throughout 2007 in an<lb/> attempt to combat the impact of their drought and to keep local bread prices low. As a result, wheat export<lb/> from Ukraine decreased from 4 669.01 MT in 2006 to 1 056.65 MT in 2007. Exports of wheat from Russia<lb/> and Kazakhstan grew significantly in 2007, by 47.9% and 53.4% respectively. Although many factors may<lb/> have contributed to this export growth, export restraints in countries like Ukraine may have contributed to this<lb/> Paraguayan authorities, the main reason cited for their application of export taxes on hides and soybeans is<lb/> the lack of raw materials for the domestic processing industry and the increase in exports of unprocessed<lb/> products, taking into account the distortion created in subregional trade by the taxes on hide exports<lb/> applied by Argentina and Uruguay. 21 This interaction can lead, in principle, to a situation of competitive<lb/> policy practices – and of increasingly higher export taxes (OECD, 2009b).<lb/> 20.<lb/> The lack of predictability is a concern for several WTO Members. In the 2007 TPR process of<lb/> Argentina, some Members expressed concern that although export duties were applied in 2002 on a<lb/> temporary basis under Resolution No.11/2002</table>

			<p>, neither the resolution itself nor its complementary or<lb/> amendatory regulations have contained any timetable for the phasing out of these duties.<lb/> 21.<lb/> The WTO accession process can contribute to the discipline on export duties, but results vary<lb/> across countries. At the time of its WTO accession in 1996, Bulgaria applied a range of export taxes for the<lb/> purpose of preventing or relieving critical shortages of foodstuffs and other essential products. However, it<lb/> undertook commitments to minimize such measures upon accession, and the TPR paper in 2003 provided<lb/> that Bulgaria no longer imposed any duties on exported products. During the accession negotiations, China<lb/> committed not to apply export duties other than on 84 items listed in its Annex. 22 According to the TPR<lb/> report in 2007, China applied statutory export duties on 88 items. In addition, China applied interim export<lb/> duties on 174 products, 64 of which were also subject to statutory export duties. In January 2008, the<lb/> coverage of interim export duties increased to 334 lines at the HS 8-digit level. Considering this binding<lb/> commitment, a question arose regarding the consistency of the interim export duties with WTO disciplines.<lb/> China replied that like other WTO members, China had the right to invoke Article XX of GATT 1994 to<lb/> implement necessary export restriction measures on exhaustible natural resources, and its measures were<lb/> based on this clause.<lb/></p>

			<head>D.<lb/> Economic implications<lb/></head>

			<p>22.<lb/> Export duties raise the cost of exported products, resulting in decreased export volumes. Reduced<lb/> exports may divert some supply to the domestic market, leading to a downward pressure on domestic<lb/> prices. Through this supply-side effect on international and domestic markets, export duties can create a<lb/> differential between the price available to domestic processors and the price charged to foreign processors.<lb/> This differential can provide an advantage to domestic downstream processors vis-à-vis foreign processors.<lb/> In this sense, an export duty acts as an implicit subsidy for the domestic processing industries, providing<lb/> them with an artificial competitive advantage. The economic implications vary according to the extent to<lb/> which the exporting country can affect the world market price of the taxed product. A supplier with a large<lb/> world market share will induce a stronger effect on world markets than will a small supplier. Quantitative<lb/> restrictions, by reducing the quantity of exports, induce similar effects as export duties.<lb/> shift in market share. By 2008, Russia and Kazakhstan also implemented export restrictions. In late January<lb/> 2008, Russia announced that it would levy a 40% export duty on wheat for exports bound outside of its<lb/> customs union. In February, Russia tightened the export restrictions, extending the export duties to its customs<lb/> union. Kazakhstan followed by levying export duties on wheat in</p>

			<table>March. It banned wheat export from 15 April<lb/> 2008 until 1 September 2008. Ukraine export restrictions not only forced importing countries to look<lb/> elsewhere, but also may have contributed to the decision by other exporting countries to apply similar<lb/> measures, further limiting the international supply of the commodity. See Dollive, Kendall (2008) The Impact<lb/> of Export Restrictions on Rising Grain Prices, USITC, www.usitc.gov and OECD (2009) Agricultural Policies<lb/> in Emerging Economies 2009: Monitoring and Evaluation.<lb/> 21.<lb/> See WTO Trade Policy Review Report by the Secretariat on Paraguay (WT/TPR/S/146)<lb/> 22.<lb/> See Report of the Working Party on the Accession of China (WT/ACC/CHN/49)<lb/></table>

			<p>23.<lb/> Export restrictions result in an efficiency loss in both the exporting and the importing country.<lb/> Consumption distortions result from the fact that too much of the taxed product is consumed domestically,<lb/> while foreign consumers consume too little. Production distortions result from the fact that too much is<lb/> produced in the exporting country&apos;s downstream industry, while too little is produced in the importing<lb/> country&apos;s downstream industry. This production efficiency loss is sometimes justified by the &quot; infant<lb/> industry &quot; argument, i.e. to provide an incentive for the development of a higher value-added industry. It is<lb/> not clear whether this infant industry strategy leads to successful results. 23<lb/> 24.<lb/> Export restrictions can also affect long-term investment and production response. For example,<lb/> when international food prices are high, one observed policy response is to ensure household food security<lb/> by lowering domestic food prices. Although there are other methods for this purpose, such as reducing<lb/> tariffs, some food exporting countries have chosen to reduce domestic prices by applying export duties on<lb/> agricultural products. However, imposition of export duties reduces incentives for the suppliers to increase<lb/> their production and investment, which will decrease long-term supply, thereby aggravating international<lb/> price increases. The long-term solution to high international prices would be to increase the international<lb/> supply of the products (<ref type="biblio">World Bank, 2008 and OECD, 2008</ref>). Price volatility and unstable supplies caused<lb/> by export restrictions create an insecure business environment. This is important regarding the mining<lb/> industry where investments are long-term and require large amounts of capital. The uncertainty, by<lb/> delaying investment in this industry, can have a negative impact on the supply of raw materials.<lb/></p>

			<head>IV.<lb/> Current disciplines in the WTO<lb/> A.<lb/> Substantive regulations: uneven discipline between export duties and quantitative restrictions<lb/></head>

			<p>25.<lb/> There is no single GATT/WTO article dealing exclusively with export restrictions. Still,<lb/> Article XI of the GATT 1994 is the key provision regarding export restrictions. It prohibits the use of<lb/> quantitative restrictions regarding both imports and exports. It states that &quot; no prohibitions or restrictions<lb/> other than duties, taxes or other charges, whether made effective through quotas, import or export licences<lb/> or other measures, shall be instituted or maintained by any contracting party (on the importation of any<lb/> product destined for the territory of any other contracting party or) on the exportation or sale for export of<lb/> any product for the territory of any other contracting party. &quot; Therefore, export duties are in principle not<lb/> subject to Article XI and thus not prohibited under this article, while quantitative restrictions are.<lb/> 26.<lb/> Regarding quantitative restrictions which are generally prohibited, the issue is whether these<lb/> measures can be exceptionally allowed under Article XI:2 (a) (critical shortage of foodstuffs), Article XX<lb/> (General Exceptions) and Article XXI (Security Exceptions). Article XI:2(a) allows each Member to apply<lb/> export restrictions &quot; temporarily &quot; to prevent or relieve &quot; critical &quot; shortage of foodstuffs or other products<lb/> essential to the exporting country. Article 12 of the Agreement on Agriculture (disciplines on export<lb/> prohibition and restriction) stipulates in detail when quantitative restrictions on exports are exceptionally<lb/> allowed. 24 Article XX allows exceptional quantitative restrictions for policy objectives such as<lb/> 23.<lb/> For example, in Cameroon, to encourage value added and ensure the supply of local wood for processing<lb/> industries, the entire log production must be processed on site, and for many species log exports are prohibited<lb/> since 2004. For the others, exports require a prior permit from the National Forestry Development Office<lb/> (ONADEF). Also, exports are subject to a tax of 17.5% of the f.o.b. value of log (unprocessed wood), and a<lb/> tax of 2% on other products. However, according to the authorities, the loss brought about by prohibiting<lb/> exports of most logs has not been offset by an increase of processed timber.<lb/></p>

			<table>24.<lb/> It requires members introducing new export restrictions on foodstuffs in accordance with Article XI:2(a) of<lb/> GATT 1994 to give due consideration to the effects of such restrictions on the importing member&apos;s food<lb/> security. Members, except non-net exporting developing countries, must notify the Committee on Agriculture<lb/> before introducing new export restrictions on foodstuffs, and must consult with affected members.<lb/> conservation of exhaustible natural resources, and ensuring essential materials for domestic processing<lb/> industry under &quot; certain qualifications. &quot; 25 However, the article also makes it clear that the exception should<lb/> not be abused for protection purposes. 26 Article XXI exception applies to measures for the purpose of<lb/> international safety. 27<lb/> 27.<lb/> Article II:1 (b) of the GATT 1994 prohibits all import duties other than ordinary customs duties<lb/> on products bound in Schedules of Concessions. 28 In contrast, no provisions specifically require a binding<lb/> obligation of export duties like import duties. Still, the MFN principle explicitly applies to export duties in<lb/> Article I of the GATT 1994 and relevance of the WTO Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing<lb/> measures was invoked under the WTO dispute setttlement scheme. 29<lb/> 28.<lb/> As is evidenced in WTO dispute cases 30 and in WTO TPR reports, export duties</table>

			<p>and quantitative<lb/> restrictions are just different forms of export restrictions, and in this sense are substitutes or supplements to<lb/> each other. It is also clear that prohibitively high export duties will induce the same effect as export<lb/> 25.<lb/> For example, (g) relating to the conservation of exhaustible natural resources if such measure are made<lb/> effective in conjunction with restrictions on domestic production or consumption; (i) involving restrictions on<lb/> exports of domestic materials necessary to ensure essential quantities of such materials to a domestic<lb/> processing industry during periods when the domestic price of such materials is held below the world price as<lb/> part of a governmental stabilization plan; Provided that such restrictions shall not operate to increase the<lb/> exports of or the protection afforded to such domestic industry, and shall not depart from the provisions of this<lb/> Agreement relating to non-discrimination; (j) essential to the acquisition or distribution of products in general<lb/> or local short supply; Provided that any such measures shall be consistent with the principle that all contracting<lb/> parties are entitled to an equitable share of the international supply of such products, and that any such<lb/> measures, which are inconsistent with the other provisions of the Agreement shall be discontinued as soon as<lb/> the conditions giving rise to them have ceased to exist…<lb/> 26.<lb/> The introductory paragraph (Chapeau) of Article XX provides that exception is allowed &quot; subject to the<lb/> requirement that measures are not applied in a manner which would constitute a means of arbitrary or<lb/> unjustifiable discrimination between countries where the same conditions prevail, or a disguised restriction on<lb/> international trade. &quot;<lb/> 27.<lb/> For example, (b)(ii) relating to the traffic in arms, ammunition and implements of war and to such traffic in<lb/> other goods and materials as is carried on directly or indirectly for the purpose of supplying a military<lb/> establishment; (c) any action in pursuance of its obligation under the United Nations Charter for the<lb/> maintenance of international peace and security.<lb/> 28.<lb/> The products described in Part I of the Schedule relating to any contracting party, which are the products of<lb/> territories of other contracting parties, shall, on their importation into the territory to which the Schedule<lb/> relates, and subject to the terms, conditions or qualifications set forth in that Schedule, be exempt from<lb/> ordinary customs duties in excess of those set forth and provided therein. Such products shall also be exempt<lb/> from all other duties or charges of any kind imposed on or in connection with the importation in excess of<lb/> those imposed on the date of this Agreement or those directly and mandatorily required to be imposed<lb/> thereafter by legislation in force in the importing territory on that date.<lb/> 29.<lb/> See WTO panel report on measures treating export restraints as subsidies (WT/DS194/R). Herbert Smith<lb/> (2009) even discusses the possibility of applying the WTO Anti-dumping Agreement (ADA). Dumping occurs<lb/> when the export price of a product is less than its normal value. Although normal value is usually the domestic<lb/> price in the exporting country, the ADA allows members to construct normal value when domestic price does<lb/> not represent normal value. If processed products are benefiting from a raw material price advantage caused by<lb/> export restrictions, it may be possible to construct normal value reflecting this market condition.<lb/></p>

			<head>30.<lb/></head>

			<p>In two dispute cases, the agreed solution was to transform quantitative restrictions to export duties. The<lb/> solution after the EC-Pakistan dispute on Pakistan&apos;s export prohibition on hides and skins resulted in the<lb/> replacement of prohibition by a 20% export duty. When disputed by EC, India also removed export restrictions<lb/> on hides/skins and leather and introduced export duties on these products. In both cases, the parties to the<lb/> dispute reached an agreement without establishment of panel.<lb/></p>

			<p>prohibitions. However, under the current WTO scheme, quantitative restrictions on exports are in principle<lb/> prohibited while export duties are allowed, and will lead to more frequent use of export duties than<lb/> quantitative restrictions. Export duties will increase government revenue, which is especially important to<lb/> LDCs; in addition, tax schemes are more transparent and less subject to discretion than are quantitative<lb/> restrictions. However, lack of substantive regulations on export duties means there is no multilateral<lb/> agreement to prevent the abuse of export duties.<lb/></p>

			<head>B.<lb/> Transparency and notification<lb/></head>

			<p>29.<lb/> Article X of the GATT 1994 requires a Member to: 1) publish its trade-related laws, regulations,<lb/> rulings and agreements in prompt and accessible manner; 2) abstain from enforcing measures of general<lb/> application prior to their publication; and 3) administer the above mentioned laws, regulations, rulings and<lb/> agreements in a uniform, impartial and reasonable manner. The paramount objective of this article is<lb/> transparency. Export restrictions are subject to this article considering its regulatory nature and effects on<lb/> trade. Therefore, the general rule of transparency applies to both export duties and quantitative restrictions<lb/> but no more than that; no obligation of notification under this article.<lb/></p>

			<figure>30.<lb/> The Decisions at Marrakesh include a Notification Procedure that has an indicative list of<lb/> notifiable measures. This list includes: quantitative restrictions, other non-tariff measures such as licensing;<lb/> export taxes, and export restrictions, including voluntary export restraints and orderly marketing<lb/> arrangements. 31 However, a note to this indicative list states that it does not alter existing notification<lb/> requirements in the Multilateral Trade Agreements and the Plurilateral Trade Agreements of the WTO. In<lb/> this sense, the initiative proposed by the United States, Japan, Korea and Chinese Taipei regarding export<lb/> licensing is one example of efforts undertaken to enhance transparency regarding export restrictions.<lb/> 31.<lb/> After the Uruguay Round, a decision by the Council for Trade in Goods (CTG) in 1995 created<lb/> procedures on biennial notification of quantitative restrictions. 32 The format of the notification does not<lb/> include export duties or taxes, seeming to reflect current disciplines on Article XI and relevant provisions<lb/> which exclude export duties from the application. The other decision by the CTG in 1995 established so<lb/> called reverse notification procedures to allow Members to indicate specific non tariff measures of other<lb/> Members for transparency purpose, but this process has rarely been used by Members. 33 Therefore, no<lb/> decisions specifically entail a notification obligation of export duties.<lb/></figure>

Only two reverse notifications for this<lb/> purpose have been found in the WTO documents.<lb/> 32.<lb/> In summary, explicit disciplines on export duties are very limited except the MFN principle<lb/> under Article I of GATT 1994 and the general transparency requirement (e.g. publication of regulations)<lb/> under the Article X of the GATT 1994. No country engages in the scheduling and notification of export<lb/> duties, in contrast to the strict scheduling of import duties.<lb/></table>

			<head>C.<lb/> WTO Accession<lb/></head>

			<p>33.<lb/> Since the creation of WTO, the accession process has provided certain disciplines on export<lb/> restrictions thus complementing GATT 1994, 34 especially regarding export duties for several countries<lb/> (<ref type="table">Table 3</ref>			<figure>). Regarding export duties, although there is no binding schedule for the existing Members, many<lb/> new Members committed to bind their export duty rates. Notably in the case of China, 84 specific items<lb/> have been scheduled, with the commitment to eliminate all export duties except on these items. The<lb/> schedule indicates the rate of bound export duties. Export restrictions were also one of the topics in the<lb/> discussion on Russia&apos;s accession. 35<lb/> 34.<lb/> The necessity and efforts to provide more discipline on export restrictions were not always shared<lb/> among WTO members. During Ukraine&apos;s accession negotiation, some Members stated that Ukraine&apos;s<lb/> export duties were very high, with a strong trade-distorting impact, and in some cases too prohibitive for<lb/> trade. A Member noted that Ukraine appeared to apply trade-related investment measures (TRIM) by<lb/> granting an exemption from export duties to agricultural producers, contingent on the production of certain<lb/> agricultural commodities. In contrast, some developing country Members had a positive view of export<lb/> duties as a development instrument. Other Members noted that the imposition of export duties was not<lb/> inconsistent with WTO rules. 36<lb/> 34<lb/> Paragraph 1.2 of Part I of the Accession Protocol makes it clear that the Protocol, including the commitments<lb/> referred in the Working Party Report, shall be an integral part of the WTO Agreement.<lb/></figure>

			<table>35<lb/> In the accession process of Russia, export duties on minerals, petrochemicals, natural gas, raw hides and skins,<lb/> ferrous and non-ferrous metals and scraps, etc., were discussed. WTO Members argued that in case where<lb/> Russia is the dominant supplier, third country buyers would suffer from increased costs because of the high<lb/> price of the product and would encounter insufficient supplies of the goods. They pointed out that the loss of<lb/> relative competitiveness in the global market for downstream products vis-à-vis Russian products should be<lb/> taken into account. Wheat (40%), log (25%), palladium/rhenium/titanium (6.5%), copper (10%) are several<lb/> examples of products subject to export tax since 2008.<lb/> 36.<lb/> See Ukraine Accession document WT/ACC/UKR/152.<lb/> Table 3.

			<p>The representative of China confirmed that China would abide by WTO rules in respect of non-<lb/>automatic export licensing and export restrictions. The Foreign Trade Law would also be brought into<lb/> conformity with GATT requirements. Moreover, export restrictions and licensing would only be applied,<lb/> after the date of accession, in those cases where this was justified by GATT provisions. The Working<lb/> Party took note of these commitments.<lb/> <ref type="biblio">Armenia<lb/> (2003)<lb/></ref> The representative of Armenia confirmed that any export licensing requirements or other export control<lb/> requirements would be applied in conformity with WTO provisions including those contained in Articles<lb/> XI, XVII, XX and XXI of the GATT 1994.

The representative also confirmed that from the date of accession, Ukraine will not apply<lb/> any obligatory minimum export prices.<lb/></p>

			<p>The representative of Ukraine confirmed that from the date of accession, the export licensing<lb/> requirements and other export restrictions and control requirements listed or any introduced in the<lb/> future would be applied in conformity with WTO provisions, including those contained in Articles XI,<lb/> XVII, XX and XXI of the GATT 1994. The export ban on nonferrous scrap metal would be eliminated<lb/> and Ukraine would remove current export restrictions on grains and precious metals and stones other<lb/> than gold, silver, and diamonds, as from the date of accession. The Working Party took note of this<lb/> commitment.<lb/></p>

			<head>V.<lb/> Evolving disciplines in bilateral/multilateral levels<lb/> A.<lb/> Regional and bilateral disciplines<lb/></head>

			<p>35.<lb/> Regional trade agreements (RTAs) include, to a varying degree, disciplines on export restrictions.<lb/> Several regional trade agreements, in contrast to the WTO, include disciplines on export duties. For<lb/> example, NAFTA, EU-Mexico, Australia-New Zealand (ANZCER), and Japan-Singapore (JSEPA)<lb/> agreements in principle prohibit export duties. The growing tendency in Europe and in the Western<lb/> Hemisphere to restrict export duties has been well recognised in both a bilateral context and in regional<lb/> trade agreements.<lb/></p>

			<figure>36.<lb/> In the EU, Article 25 of the Treaty establishing the European Community stipulates that custom<lb/> duties on imports and exports and charges having equivalent effect shall be prohibited between Member<lb/> States. This prohibition shall also apply to customs duties of a fiscal nature. Article 29 provides that<lb/> quantitative restrictions on exports, and all measures having equivalent effect, shall be prohibited between<lb/> Member States. Although there are exceptions to this general prohibition on quantitative restrictions, these<lb/> exceptions do not apply to export duties. 37<lb/> 37.<lb/> The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) is also stringent regarding export<lb/> restrictions. Article 314 of the NAFTA imposes a prohibition on export taxes, subject to a Mexican<lb/> exception for basic foods set out in Annex 314. Regarding quantitative restrictions, it provides general<lb/> rules in line with Article XI of the GATT 1994. Article 315 further specifies the conditions of exceptions<lb/> in Articles XI:2(a) or XX(g), (i) or (j) of the GATT 1994 by articulating detailed requirements such as<lb/> comparison of trade volumes. 38 Overall, these provisions help to enhance transparency and narrow the<lb/> scope of unpredictability by articulating regulations in annexes and detailed requirements in the provisions.<lb/></figure>

			<p>38.<lb/> In Article 2.8 of the US-Morocco FTA agreement, the Parties undertook not to adopt or maintain<lb/> any prohibition or restriction on the export of any good to the other Party, except as provided in the<lb/> Agreement and in accordance with Article XI of the GATT 1994. Article 2.10 provides that except as<lb/> provided in Annex 2-C, neither Party may adopt or maintain any tax, duty, or other charge on the export of<lb/> any good to the territory of the other Party, unless the tax, duty, or charge is also adopted or maintained on<lb/> the good when destined for domestic consumption. 39<lb/> 37.<lb/> Article 30 provides that Article 29 shall not preclude prohibitions or restrictions on imports, exports or goods<lb/> in transit justified on grounds of public morality, public policy or public security; the protection of health and<lb/> life of humans, animals or plants; the protection of national treasures possessing artistic, historic or<lb/> archaeological value; or the protection of industrial and commercial property. Such prohibitions or restrictions<lb/> shall not, however, constitute a means of arbitrary discrimination or a disguised restriction on trade between<lb/> Member States.<lb/> 38.<lb/> Article 315 (Mexico is exempted by Annex 315) provides that a Party may adopt or maintain a restriction<lb/> otherwise justified under Article XI:2(a) or XX(g), (i) or (j) of the GATT with respect to the export of the<lb/> Party to the territory of another Party, only if: (a) the restriction does not reduce the proportion of the total<lb/> export shipments of the specific good made available to that other Party relative to the total supply of that<lb/> good of the Party maintaining the restrictions as compared to the proportion prevailing in the most recent 36-<lb/>month period.<lb/> 39.<lb/> Annex 2-C stipulates that Article 2.10 shall not apply to a tax on exports of processed or unprocessed<lb/> phosphates, provided that the tax rate is no higher than 34 dirhams per ton of unprocessed phosphates, for five<lb/> years beginning on the date of entry into force of this agreement.<lb/> 39.<lb/> Other RTAs include disciplines similar to those under the WTO. For example, Article 2.5 of the<lb/> India-Singapore FTA agreement provides that neither Party may adopt or maintain any non-tariff measures<lb/> on the export of any goods to the other party except in accordance with its WTO rights and obligations or<lb/> in accordance with other provisions of the agreement. The Australia-Thailand RTA stipulates that the<lb/> Parties are not allowed to adopt or maintain any prohibition or restriction on the export or sale for export of<lb/> any good, except in accordance with Article XI of the GATT, but this does not deal with export duties. 40<lb/> Some RTAs do not include any discipline at all. In either China-Chile or China-Pakistan RTAs, there is no<lb/> provision on export duties. China, in its question and response paper regarding its RTA with Chile, made it<lb/> clear that it did not have any clause regarding export duties in its FTAs with other countries. 41<lb/> 40.<lb/> The fewer countries involved in negotiations, the easier to compromise and reach a conclusion,<lb/> and hence several RTAs were relatively more successful in disciplining export restrictions than the<lb/> multilateral forum of the WTO. However, it should be also noted that bilateral negotiations were not very<lb/> successful in restraining export restrictions of countries which were major users of such measures. 42<lb/></p>

			<head>B.<lb/> Doha Development Agenda (DDA) Negotiations<lb/> B1.<lb/> Non-Agricultural Market Access (NAMA) Negotiations<lb/></head>

			<p>41.<lb/> Since the creation of the Negotiating Group on Market Access for Non-Agricultural Products in<lb/> the context of the Doha Development Agenda (DDA), countries have communicated their thoughts about<lb/> the scope and modalities of the future negotiations, inter alia in the non-tariff field. Export duties have<lb/> been mentioned several times. Included in its draft modalities is a textual proposal from the EU on export<lb/> taxes. 43 In that proposal, the EU provided the following reasons as to why export taxes pose serious<lb/> difficulties for trade liberalization: 1) export taxes can have serious distortive effects on global commodity<lb/> trade especially when applied by major suppliers; 2) when used for industrial or trade policy purposes,<lb/> export taxes can serve as indirect subsidization of processing industries and influence international trading<lb/> conditions of these goods; and 3) export taxes can serve to displace imports on the market of the country<lb/> imposing the taxes, both for imported goods in direct competition with the taxed products and for imported<lb/> processed products. Among the reasons for the growing importance of export taxes today are inter alia: the<lb/> recent proliferation in the use of these instruments, which is possible under the weaker WTO rules on<lb/> export taxes compared to those on import restrictions or other forms of NTMs; and the shortfall of global<lb/> supply of some specific commodities, despite their abundance in a few countries – a situation that is<lb/> aggravated by export taxes in key supplying countries. 44<lb/> 42.<lb/> The European Union (EU) emphasized that any approach should ensure increased transparency<lb/> and predictability. Concerning transparency, Members should be fully informed of measures taken by any<lb/> other Member that may influence trade. The EU also considered that scheduling and binding of Members&apos;<lb/> export taxes could offer an appropriate route of ensuring adequate predictability. This approach would<lb/></p>

			<p>This initiative concentrates on export licensing which is another form of<lb/> export restrictions. According to this proposal, export licensing is defined as any administrative procedures<lb/> involving the submission of an application or other documentation (other than that required for customs<lb/> purposes) to the relevant administrative body or bodies as a prior condition for exportation. It requires each<lb/> country to notify, in writing, existing measures on export licensing and any new measures on export<lb/> licensing within 60 days after the effective date of the new measures. Each country, upon request by any<lb/> WTO member, is also required to provide all relevant information including, among others, the export<lb/> licenses granted over a recent period and other measures taken in conjunction with export licensing<lb/> regarding restrictions on domestic production or consumption.

			<head>B2.<lb/> Agriculture negotiations<lb/></head>

			<p>44.<lb/> Export restrictions were also discussed during the DDA agriculture negotiations. Most<lb/> participants agreed that some disciplines were needed to ensure stable supplies for importing countries.<lb/> Japan stated that in view of redressing the imbalances of the rights and obligations between importing and<lb/> exporting countries, and of maintaining the food security of food-importing countries, rules and disciplines<lb/> on export-promoting and export-restricting measures should be established. 47 They proposed converting<lb/> export restrictions to taxes that would then be reduced (similar to tariffication of import restrictions). Korea<lb/> proposed that rules and disciplines on export competition should be transparent and contribute to the<lb/> overall balance of rights and obligations between exporting countries and importing countries. In this<lb/> regard, disciplines with the following objectives are needed: (i) to prohibit exporting countries from<lb/> imposing export restrictions and prohibitions arbitrarily; and (ii) to prohibit the use of export tax for the<lb/> purpose of export restrictions. 48 Switzerland stated that disciplines are necessary in order to ensure that<lb/> 45.<lb/> The exception includes that (a) least-developed countries would undertake to schedule export taxes but may<lb/> maintain these export taxes unbound and (b) paragraph 6 countries (developing country Members with no final<lb/> bound total AMS commitments) would schedule export taxes but may maintain these export taxes unbound for<lb/> a certain number of tariff lines (the number is to be negotiated), in reflection of their specific development<lb/> interests and concerns.<lb/> 46.<lb/> See Protocol on Transparency in Export Licensing to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1994<lb/> (TN/MA/W/15/Add.4/Rev.5) which was proposed by Chinese Taipei, Japan, Korea, Ukraine and the United<lb/> States.<lb/> 47.<lb/> Japan specifically proposed: (1) to tariffy all export prohibitions and restrictions (by replacing them with<lb/> export taxes); (2) to bind all export taxes (including those possibly introduced in the future) (for products<lb/> subject to the export tax, to establish quotas in which a certain amount of exports will be exempt from the<lb/> export tax), and (3) in the case where temporary and short-term measures to restrict exports become necessary<lb/> before export taxes are introduced, to clarify the disciplines applied on such emergency measures used in order<lb/> to adjust the volume of exports. Measures for clarifying such disciplines are (i) to establish strict requirements<lb/> for the application of such emergency measures; (ii) to introduce consultations with other Members as a<lb/> prerequisite for imposing emergency measures, and to clarify the measures to be taken when the consultations<lb/> do not result in a satisfactory solution; (iii) to obligate Members, when introducing emergency measures, to<lb/> maintain the proportion of exports to domestic production at the level of preceding x years, in order to allow<lb/> importing countries to secure the necessary level of imports; and (iv) to limit the duration of such emergency<lb/> measures.</p>

			<p>45.<lb/> Exporting countries, while agreeing that tighter disciplines would provide Members with more<lb/> stable access to agricultural products, emphasized the interrelation between tariff escalation and export<lb/> restrictions. 52 According to them, tariff escalation hinders the capacity of exporting countries to develop<lb/> processing industries. In particular, it prevents developing countries from adding value to their exports. As<lb/> a response to tariff escalation, some developing countries have taken recourse to restricting or taxing their<lb/> raw material exports. The Cairns Group proposed that the agriculture negotiations should (i) develop both<lb/> improved disciplines on export restrictions and taxes and eliminate tariff escalation; and (ii) preserve<lb/> Article 12.2 of the Agreement on Agriculture and provide additional special and differential treatment<lb/> provisions to address the legitimate needs of developing countries, including least developed and net food-<lb/>importing developing countries.<lb/></p>

			<head>VI.<lb/> Conclusion and policy implications<lb/></head>

			<p>46.<lb/> Export restrictions are applied to achieve diverse policy objectives: increasing government<lb/> revenue, stabilizing inflationary pressure, promoting downstream industry, conserving natural resources,<lb/> etc. However, the effectiveness of these measures is questionable. Furthermore, export restrictions may<lb/> result in efficiency losses. Furthermore, export restrictions, by lowering domestic prices, can reduce<lb/> incentives for the suppliers to increase their production and investment, which can aggravate international<lb/> price instability. In this sense, when designing and applying such measures, policy makers should consider<lb/> several factors: (1) whether the measures are effective in achieving policy objectives, (2) whether the<lb/> benefit outweighs the cost of the measures, and (3) whether the measures achieve the objectives in the least<lb/> trade distorting ways.<lb/> 47.<lb/> Export duties and quantitative restrictions are substitutable policy tools as indicated in TPR<lb/> papers. Considering this nature, uneven discipline under the current WTO scheme may induce more use of<lb/> export duties. More reliance on export duties is, in a sense, consistent with the tariffication scheme of the<lb/> WTO regarding imports restriction. The problem is that unlike imports tariff which is regulated by binding<lb/> 49.<lb/> See Switzerland&apos;s Proposal for WTO negotiation on Agriculture (G/AG/NG/W/94).<lb/> 50.<lb/> See US Proposal for comprehensive long-term Agricultural Trade Reform (G/AG/NG/W/15).<lb/> 51.<lb/> See Revised Draft Modalities for Agriculture (TN/AG/W/4/Rev.4). Regarding Article 12 of the Agreement of<lb/> Agriculture, it proposes that the member instituting export prohibitions and restrictions shall consult, upon<lb/> request, with any other member having a substantial interest as an importer and shall report the progress made<lb/> in the consultations to the Committee on Agriculture. The Committee on Agriculture shall provide for annual<lb/> notification update and surveillance of the obligations and any member may bring to the attention of the<lb/> Committee on Agriculture any measures which it considers ought to have been notified by another member.<lb/> Existing export prohibitions and restrictions in foodstuffs and feeds under Article XI.2 (a) of GATT 1994 shall<lb/> be eliminated by the end of the first year of implementation. Any new export prohibitions or restrictions under<lb/> Article XI.2(a) of GATT 1994 should not normally be longer than 12 months, and shall only be longer than 18<lb/> months with the agreement of the affected importing members. These clauses emphasize that export<lb/> restrictions, even when applied for food security, should be applied only temporarily.<lb/> 52.<lb/> The Cairns Group, which included Argentina, Australia, Bolivia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica,<lb/> Guatemala, Indonesia, Malaysia, New Zealand, Paraguay, Philippines, South Africa, Thailand and Uruguay,<lb/> submitted its proposal paper (G/AG/NG/W/93).<lb/> schedule, export duties are not restrained by any substantive discipline. Lack of discipline may result in<lb/> abuse of export duties.<lb/> 48.<lb/> The growing number of bilateral and regional trade agreements has introduced disciplines to<lb/> prohibit export duties. In the WTO, accession procedures have provided a multilateral framework for<lb/> making progress with respect to individual countries, as in the case of China. During the DDA negotiations,<lb/> countries have communicated their thoughts on these measures. However, it is questionable whether these<lb/> efforts to introduce multilateral or bilateral discipline have been very successful.<lb/> 49.<lb/> Although the TPR reports are the most trustworthy source regarding the documentation of export<lb/> restrictions, it is not satisfactory. 53 The review process takes place every two to four years, depending on<lb/> the countries involved and therefore cannot reflect the most up-to-date information. The WTO notification<lb/> procedure is not effective especially regarding export duties, and this partially reflects lack of substantive<lb/> regulation on export duties. Transparency regarding the use and implementation of export restrictions<lb/> should be substantially improved.<lb/> 53.<lb/> TPR reports do not cover countries that are not member of the WTO and hence additional sources should be<lb/> consulted to have a more complete information covering these countries.<lb/></p>

			<p>Export taxes are levied at statutory rates in relation to f.o.b. values and on an MFN basis. In<lb/> addition, lower interim rates may be applied on an MFN basis. The Tariff Commission under<lb/> the State Council sets and publishes the statutory rates annually and revises the list of items<lb/> subject to interim duty together with the rates of duty. In 2007, statutory export taxes applied to<lb/> 88 tariff lines at the HS 8-digit level, including metals, phosphorous, benzene, and eel; 64 of<lb/> these lines were also subject to lower interim export duties. In the same year, interim export<lb/> duties applied to an additional 110 lines at the HS 8-digit level, which were not subject to<lb/> statutory export taxes. They included: some mineral products; iron, copper, nickel, and<lb/> aluminium ores; certain chemical products; as well as iron and steel products. The interim duty<lb/> rates on 142 tariff lines were increased on 1 June 2007, with a view to reducing exports of<lb/> products that are highly energy consuming and polluting, as well as those consuming large<lb/> amounts of raw materials. On 1 January 2008, the coverage of interim export duties increased<lb/> again to include some more steel products; in total, 334 lines (at the HS 8-digit level and<lb/> including 4 &quot;ex-&quot; lines) are now subject to interim export duties. In addition to these products,<lb/> exports of grain, rice, maize, and soybeans are subject to interim export duties, to discourage<lb/> their export. Though the main objective of these export taxes may be to improve the<lb/> environment by reducing exports of products considered to be highly energy consuming or<lb/> polluting, such taxes tend to increase the domestic supply of the products concerned. As a<lb/> consequence, their domestic prices tend to be lower than would otherwise be the case; thus,<lb/> export taxes may implicitly assist domestic downstream processing of the products concerned.<lb/></p>

			<p>Not fully rebating VAT on exports of certain products has a similar outcome. The VAT rebate<lb/> rates are adjusted from time to time to, inter alia, meet industrial development goals, and<lb/> control exports of certain products. For example, in</p>

			<table>September 2006, rebate rates were<lb/> lowered on, inter alia, some steel products, cements, and some textiles, as well as furniture,<lb/> plastics, and wood products. In July 2007, China eliminated rebates for some 553 items<lb/> regarded as highly energy consuming, highly polluting, and consuming large amount of raw<lb/> materials, and lowered rebate rates for 2 268 lines (HS 8-digit) that the authorities considered<lb/> prone to trade friction; such items included textiles and steel products. In December 2007,<lb/> China removed the VAT rebate on exports of 84 agricultural tariff lines, such as wheat, maize,<lb/> rice, and soybean, with a view to easing inflation. As a consequence, current VAT rebates are:<lb/> 17%, 13%, 11%, 9%, and 5%. The authorities state that VAT rebates on exports amounted to<lb/> CNY 487.7 billion in 2006 (CNY 420 billion in 2004), or about 6.3% of total merchandise<lb/> exports.<lb/> Chinese Taipei<lb/> (2006)<lb/> No export taxes.<lb/> Fiji (2009)<lb/> Export taxes of 3% apply to gold, silver, sugar, molasses, and, following the 2009 Budget,<lb/> unprocessed fish and timber to promote domestic value added.

			<p>Fisheries exports are subject to a 5% royalty, based on weight.<lb/> <ref type="biblio">Malaysia (2006)<lb/></ref> Export duties are generally imposed on main commodities, such as crude petroleum and palm<lb/> oil. Out of 10 580 tariff lines, 512 lines are subject to export duties, the majority being in 15-<lb/>20% range. The purpose of Malaysia&apos;s export duties is to discourage the export of raw<lb/> materials and to encourage downstream activities in the country. For example, a 5% export<lb/> duty is levied on cockles (molluscs), live cattle, buffaloes, goats, and wild animals and birds.<lb/> The export of wildlife is discouraged for conservation purposes. Export duties are also imposed<lb/> to fund research and development and promotion activities for commodities in downstream and<lb/> upstream industries and to maintain an adequate supply of certain goods in the domestic<lb/> market. Currently export duties are 15% on logs and range from 10% to 30% for crude palm<lb/> oil, based on tonnage. The Government imposes an export levy on selected species of sawn<lb/> timber to ensure an adequate supply for timber-based industries and for research and<lb/> development. With the exception of crude petroleum, which is subject to a flat rate duty of 20%,<lb/> duties on commodities are based on the &quot; cost plus &quot; concept: the duty is only imposed on the<lb/> excess over a threshold price that reflects the cost of</p>

Upon accession to the WTO, Mongolia<lb/> made a commitment to eliminate export duty on raw cashmere within ten years of the date of<lb/> accession. With a view to protecting metal-smelting plants, due to the increasing shortage of<lb/> raw metals and a large increase in the world prices of metals since 1997, export taxes on scrap<lb/> metals were raised from Tog 140/kg to Tog 350/kg in May 2004.<lb/> New Zealand<lb/> (OECD)<lb/> (2009, 2003)<lb/> No export taxes.<lb/> Pakistan<lb/> (2008)<lb/> Although export taxes are prohibited, the Central Board of Revenue (CBR) can impose<lb/> &quot; regulatory duties &quot; up to 100% on exports, by notification without parliamentary approval<lb/> (Customs Act). Duties of 25% were applied to exported ferrous and non-ferrous waste and<lb/> scrap in June 2006 and of 35% on pulses in 2006/07, due to domestic shortages; &quot; regulatory<lb/> duties &quot; also apply at 15% on exports of sugar, 30% on leather goods, 20% on hides and skins<lb/> and, from the 2007/08 Budget, 25% on specified metals and articles thereof. The authorities<lb/> indicate that such measures are used to control supply of commodities for local consumption<lb/> and not to raise revenue or assist domestic users of these goods; nevertheless export taxes<lb/> can implicitly subsidize users of affected goods by reducing domestic prices. The All-Pakistan<lb/> Textile Association no longer sets minimum export prices on cotton yarn. According to the<lb/> authorities the special mechanism mentioned in the 2006 Export Trade Order for monitoring<lb/> metal exports, including prices, was not established.

However,<lb/> provisions still appear to exist that enable export taxes to be re-imposed on other products,<lb/> although the authorities indicate that these may no longer apply. The authorities indicate that<lb/> the export tax on non-native logs is imposed to ensure an adequate, stable and sustainable<lb/> supply of domestic timber. However, export taxes are distorting and implicitly subsidize<lb/> downstream processors by providing logs at below world prices, thereby encouraging domestic<lb/> value added, which may be an inefficient use of resources if reliant on the subsidy. The<lb/> authorities indicate that revenue from the export tax is minimal.

Exports of<lb/> sawn rubber wood are also subject to a minimum export price to prevent the indiscriminate<lb/> felling of rubber trees, and thereby protect the rubber industry. As in the case of imports,<lb/> several types of border charges are levied on certain exports. While these charges may be<lb/> justified by the authorities on grounds of national security, environmental protection, financing<lb/> export promotion, and encouraging downstream processing, the use of such levies on the<lb/> export of locally produced materials is in effect, an input subsidy to processors. Insofar as<lb/> export sales of such materials are diverted onto the home market, the domestic prices of these<lb/> materials are reduced by the export restriction. While processors benefit from lower domestic<lb/> prices, domestic suppliers of materials are penalized. Encouraging production and exports of<lb/> processed products through export levies on inputs, risks developing inefficient industries.<lb/> Export duties and cesses may be imposed to: ensure the availability of raw materials for<lb/> higher-value-added industries and to promote further processing of local materials; finance<lb/> export promotion activities; and protect national security, archaeological items, and the<lb/> environment.<lb/> <ref type="biblio">Thailand (2007,<lb/> 2003</ref>)<lb/></p>

			<p>, Cameroon has set about gradually prohibiting exports of logs in order to promote<lb/> the processing industry. From 1999 until the prohibiting of log exports in 2004, a<lb/> certificate of registration had to be obtained to export timber, which was intended to<lb/> ensure that 70 % of production was processed locally and only 30 % of the annual<lb/> harvest exported as logs. However, the Ordinance also provides for log exports to<lb/> continue, subject to surtax, with the aim of promoting certain species. The export of two<lb/> species (Sapelli and Ayous) is subject to quantitative restrictions with exporters being<lb/> given quotas proportionate to the efforts invested in processing or exporting the species<lb/> being promoted which may be exported as logs. However, according to the authorities,<lb/> the loss brought about by prohibiting exports of most logs has not been offset by an<lb/> increase of processed timber.<lb/></p>
