			<front>ABSTRACT <lb/>Prices for commodities such as minerals and metals have increased significantly over the past <lb/>few years. At the same time, there has also been an increase in restrictions on the export of raw materials <lb/>which has led policy makers and business people to address free trade of raw materials. This paper <lb/>provides information on the present situation regarding the use of export restrictions and international <lb/>disciplines on these measures. Export restrictions are maintained to achieve diverse policy objectives, <lb/>including environmental protection or conservation of natural resources, promotion of downstream <lb/>processing industries, controlling inflationary pressures, and for fiscal receipts reasons. Export restrictions <lb/>take various forms such as export duties, quantitative restrictions, and licensing requirements. The number <lb/>of countries applying export duties over the period 2003-2009 was higher than in previous years and that <lb/>such duties were introduced primarily by developing and least developed countries. Under the current <lb/>WTO rules, unlike quantitative export restrictions which are in principle prohibited, there is no substantive <lb/>discipline on export duties, although there have been efforts to revise this at the multilateral and bilateral <lb/>levels. The WTO accession process imposes several disciplines. Export restrictions have also been <lb/>discussed during the DDA negotiations in both NAMA (Non-Agricultural Market Access) and agriculture <lb/>negotiations. Several regional trade agreements (RTAs) went beyond the WTO by including prohibition of <lb/>export duties. Export restrictions, by creating a differential between the price available to domestic <lb/>processors and the price charged to foreign processors, provide domestic processing industries with an <lb/>advantage. Although several governments apply export restrictions to achieve diverse policy objectives, <lb/>not all rely on such restrictions. Alternative policy options with different trade impacts are used. In view of <lb/>the significant impacts of export restrictions on global supply chains, transparency on the use and <lb/>implementation of such measures should be substantially improved. <lb/>Keywords <lb/>Export restrictions, export duties, quantitative restrictions, export licensing, raw materials, food security, <lb/>social objectives, conservation of natural resources, tariff escalation, terms-of-trade, fiscal receipts, trade <lb/>policy review, accession, regional trade agreements (RTAs), Doha development agenda (DDA), Non-<lb/>agricultural market access, transparency, subsidy, WTO disciplines. <lb/>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS <lb/>This study was prepared by Jeonghoi Kim of the OECD Trade and Agriculture Directorate under the <lb/>supervision of Frank van Tongeren.

			<body>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY <lb/>This study updates previous OECD work on export restrictions. Its main purpose is to provide <lb/>information on the present situation regarding the use of export restrictions and international disciplines on <lb/>the measures. New material provided here is mostly based on WTO Trade Policy Review (TPR) papers. <lb/>Export restrictions are maintained to achieve diverse policy objectives, including environmental <lb/>protection or conservation of natural resources, promotion of downstream processing industries, <lb/>controlling inflationary pressures, and for fiscal receipts reasons. Export restrictions take various forms <lb/>such as export duties, minimum export prices, and reduction of VAT rebates which directly affect export <lb/>prices. Other forms include export bans, quotas, and licensing requirements which affect export volumes. <lb/>A number of trends concerning the use of export restrictions can be identified from a review of WTO <lb/>TPR country reports. One observes, for example, that the percentage of countries applying export duties <lb/>over the period 2003-2009 was higher than in previous years and that such duties were introduced <lb/>primarily by developing and least developed countries; examples of items most subject to export duties <lb/>were mineral and metal products, forestry, fishery and agricultural products, as well as those made from <lb/>leather, hide and skin. It also becomes apparent that when compared to export duties, quantitative <lb/>restrictions were more broadly used for social policy objectives, such as environmental protection or <lb/>conservation of natural resources. <lb/>Under the current WTO rules, unlike quantitative export restrictions which are in principle prohibited, <lb/>there is no substantive discipline on export duties, although there have been efforts to revise this at the <lb/>multilateral and bilateral levels. The WTO accession process does impose, however, several disciplines as <lb/>evidenced by the Chinese accession process. Export restrictions have been also discussed during the DDA <lb/>negotiations in both NAMA (Non-Agricultural Market Access) and agriculture negotiations. Several <lb/>regional trade agreements (RTAs) went beyond the WTO by including prohibition of export duties. <lb/>Export restrictions result in losses of efficiency by inducing too much production in the exporting <lb/>country&apos;s downstream industry. Such measures also have income redistribution effects by penalizing <lb/>exporters of the restricted product while benefiting domestic processing industries. The measures create a <lb/>differential between the price available to domestic processors and the price charged to foreign processors, <lb/>and thus provide domestic processing industries with an advantage. <lb/></body>

			<front>When designing export restrictions, several factors should be carefully considered: (1) whether the <lb/>measures are effective in achieving intended policy objectives; (2) whether the benefit of the measures <lb/>outweighs the cost; and (3) whether the measures achieve the objectives in the least trade distorting ways. <lb/>Considering that export duties and quantitative restrictions are substitutable, more attention is necessary <lb/>regarding uneven discipline between these measures. In view of the significant impacts of export <lb/>restrictions on global supply chains, transparency regarding the use and implementation of the measures <lb/>should be substantially improved. <lb/></front>

			<body>I. <lb/>Introduction <lb/>1. <lb/>In recent years, export restrictions have continued to attract the attention of trade policy makers, <lb/>both as a perceived means to achieve certain objectives and because of perceived gaps in international <lb/>disciplines on their use. For example, following the peso devaluation in 2002, Argentina once again <lb/>applied export duties to all exports in order to cushion the effects of exchange-rate fluctuations on <lb/>domestic products and to counter the sharp fall in tax revenue. After successive increases in rates, the <lb/>applicable duties were 5, 20, 15, 20, 25 and 45% (depending on products) as of mid-2006. 1 In 2007, China <lb/>eliminated value added tax (VAT) rebates on exports for 553 items to restrain the export of products <lb/>regarded as highly energy consuming, highly polluting, and consuming large amount of raw materials. 2 <lb/>Since 1999, Cameroon has gradually prohibited exports of logs in order to promote the processing <lb/>industry. From 1999 until the prohibition of log exports in 2004, a certificate of registration had to be <lb/>obtained to export timber; this was intended to ensure that 70% of production was processed locally and <lb/>only 30% of the annual harvest exported as logs. 3 These examples display various objectives and methods <lb/>by which governments apply export restrictions. <lb/>2. <lb/>By affecting the price and quantity of trade, export restrictions produce trade distorting effects in <lb/>the same way as import restrictions, but their incidence differs. However, multilateral disciplines on export <lb/>restrictions are not as clearly defined as those on import restrictions. The WTO accession negotiation in <lb/>general complemented disciplines on export restrictions, especially regarding export duties. During the <lb/>Doha Development Agenda (DDA) negotiations, countries communicated their positions on the scope and <lb/>modalities of future negotiations, inter alia in the case of export restrictions. Bilateral negotiation of RTAs <lb/>has been another channel for providing more discipline. <lb/>3. <lb/>On the basis of this background, this paper offers an overview of the current situation, as well as <lb/>updating two previous papers on export restrictions which described the situation as of 2002. 4 The present <lb/>paper analyses factual information of such measures based on Trade Policy Review (TPR) reports and <lb/>describes key findings. Current discipline on export restrictions in the WTO is examined. It also analyses <lb/>recent trends with respect to disciplines at both the bilateral and multilateral levels. Finally, this paper <lb/>provides policy considerations regarding such measures. <lb/>II. <lb/>Definition <lb/>4. <lb/>Defining the term &quot; export restriction &quot; is the first challenge. A panel under the WTO Dispute <lb/>Settlement Understanding, in the context of the application of the Subsidies and Countervailing Measures <lb/>(SCM) Agreement, delineated the scope of &quot; export restraint &quot; as &quot; a border measure that takes the form of a <lb/>government law or regulation which expressly limits the quantity of exports or places explicit conditions <lb/>on the circumstances under which exports are permitted, or that takes the form of a government-imposed <lb/>fee or tax on exports of the products calculated to limit the quantity of exports. 5 &quot; The WTO&apos;s Trade Policy <lb/>1. <lb/>See WTO Trade Policy Review Report by the Secretariat on Argentina (WT/TPR/S/176). <lb/>2. <lb/>In China, exporters are entitled to VAT rebates although VAT is not necessarily rebated fully on exports. <lb/>When VAT rebate rates on exports are lower than the VAT rates actually paid, the difference between the two <lb/>rates constitutes a levy on exports. See WTO Trade Policy Review Paper on China (WT/TPR/S/199). <lb/>3. <lb/>See WTO Trade Policy Review Report by the Secretariat on Cameroon (WT/TPR/S/187). <lb/>4. <lb/>Analysis of non-tariff measures: the case of export duties, TD/TC/WP(2002)54/FINAL and Analysis of non-<lb/>tariff measures: the case of export restrictions, TD/TC/WP(2003)7/FINAL. <lb/>5. <lb/>This case deals with the relation between export restrictions and subsidy. The question was whether US <lb/>regulations that treat a restraint on exports of a product as a subsidy to other products made using or <lb/>incorporating the restricted product was consistent with the WTO SCM Agreement (WT/DS194/R). <lb/></body>

			<body>Review (TPR) papers deal with export restrictions in the section on &quot; measures directly affecting exports. &quot; <lb/>Under this heading, in addition to export-incentive measures (i.e. export subsidies; duty and tax drawback; <lb/>export processing zone; export finance, insurance and guarantees; and other export promotion measures), <lb/>the TPRs cover export-restrictive measures (typically, export prohibitions, export quotas, export licensing, <lb/>export duties and levies, and minimum export prices). Considering the fact that minimum export price and <lb/>reduction of VAT rebates have similar effects as other traditional export restrictions, this paper follows the <lb/>broader definition of export restriction used in the WTO TPR papers. <lb/>5. <lb/>One of the most popular forms of export restrictions is export duties. This paper makes no <lb/>distinction between the terms &quot; export duties &quot; and &quot; export taxes. &quot; Both are used here in the sense of <lb/>(customs) duties on export. This does not include tax credit on exports, which might be well discussed as <lb/>export subsidies in the context of the Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures. A variety of <lb/>similar or complementary terms also exist, such as export tariffs, export fees, export charges, and export <lb/>levies. However, this paper prefers &quot; export duties &quot; or &quot; export taxes &quot; to the others. <lb/>6. <lb/>Export duties can take different forms. It can be an ad valorem tax, specified as a percentage tax <lb/>of the value of the product; or a specific tax, specified as a fixed amount to pay per unit of a product. All <lb/>types of export taxes have the effect of raising the cost of exports, and thereby reducing the volume of <lb/>exports. 6 As shown below, minimum export price and reduction of VAT rebate rates may produce effects <lb/>similar to export duties. <lb/>7. <lb/>Other forms of export restrictions directly affect the quantity of exports. The most extreme case <lb/>of restrictions is export prohibition. Export quotas are restrictions or ceilings imposed by an exporting <lb/>country on the total volume of certain products. Export license requirements establish that an application or <lb/>other documentation should be submitted as a condition for exportation and depending on whether license <lb/>acquisition is automatic, the requirements may affect the volume of exports. However, despite the <lb/>potentially negative impact on exports, export licensing has drawn relatively less attention, partly because <lb/>it is difficult to acquire information on this measure. Enhancing transparency on export licensing was <lb/>proposed during the WTO DDA negotiations. <lb/>III. <lb/>Use of export restrictions during 2003-2009 <lb/>8. <lb/>The most systematic information available on export restrictions is found in Trade Policy Review <lb/>(TPR) country reports. TPR reports of WTO members include a section on measures affecting exports, and <lb/>more or less address export duties, quotas, licensing and other similar measures. The contents vary <lb/>reflecting each country&apos;s situation at the time the reviews were undertaken. Therefore, it is difficult to <lb/>compare between members and to draw quantitative conclusions; certain tendencies can be observed, <lb/>however, from these reports. <lb/>A. <lb/>Export duties and other measures affecting export prices <lb/>9. <lb/>The number of countries applying export duties (65 of 128 WTO members) during 2003-2009 is <lb/>higher than it was in the previous analysis (39 of 100 WTO Members during 1997-2002). On a regional <lb/>basis, the increase in the number of countries imposing export duties is clear regarding the Americas and <lb/>6. <lb/>Export duties should be distinguished from fees and formalities, prohibiting fees and other charges rendered in <lb/>connection with exportation (or importation) that are addressed under Article VIII (a) of the GATT 1994. It <lb/>stipulates that fees and other charges shall not represent an indirect protection to domestic products or a <lb/>taxation of imports or exports for fiscal purposes. It applies to all fees and fomalities whatever its nature, but <lb/>explicitly states that &quot; export duty &quot; is excluded from the application. Therefore, a distinction should be drawn <lb/>between export duties and fees or charges, even though in specific cases the substance of the measures might <lb/>be similar and thus difficult to distinguish. <lb/></body>

			<body>Africa, where in 1997-2002 the numbers were 9 out of 26 and 17 out of 26 countries respectively. 7 As was <lb/>the case in the earlier 2002 analysis, export duties were imposed mainly by developing and least developed <lb/>countries during 2003-2009 period (Table 1). <lb/>Table 1. Number of countries applying export duties, by regions and other groupings <lb/>(2003-2009) <lb/>Number of WTO Members <lb/>reviewed by TPRB <lb/>WTO Members imposing <lb/>export duties <lb/>Europe/Middle East <lb/>39 <lb/>4 <lb/>America <lb/>31 <lb/>18 <lb/>Asia/Pacific <lb/>23 <lb/>13 <lb/>Africa <lb/>35 <lb/>30 <lb/>Total <lb/>128 <lb/>65 <lb/>LDCs <lb/>25 <lb/>21 <lb/>OECD <lb/>31 <lb/>4 <lb/>Others <lb/>72 <lb/>40 <lb/>Note: TPR reports from 2003 to 2009. Some Members were reviewed two or three times, but are here counted as one. The EU is <lb/>counted as 25 (considering 2 other countries were under TPR review during this period before they became EU members). <lb/>10. <lb/>The items most affected by export duties are agricultural products, mineral and metal products, <lb/>leather, hide and skin products, forestry products, and fishery products. (Table 2) <lb/>Table 2. TPR Summary of current situation on export duties, <lb/>by product (2003-2009) <lb/>Selected products <lb/>Number of WTO members applying export duties <lb/>(based on 65 TPRs) <lb/>Forestry products <lb/>15 <lb/>Fishery products <lb/>13 <lb/>Mineral products, metals, precious stones <lb/>28 <lb/>Leather, hides and skins <lb/>17 <lb/>Agricultural products (sugar, coffee, etc) <lb/>36 <lb/>TPR reports do not specify precise HS number of products subject to export duties. Therefore, this classification is based upon the <lb/>description of the products in the reports. In this table, hides and skins have been grouped with leather rather than agricultural <lb/>products. Products listed are not exhaustive; Comprehensive details are in Annex 1. <lb/>B. <lb/>Quantitative restrictions <lb/>11. <lb/>TPR country reports describe export prohibitions and export licensing in various ways. Because <lb/>of the variety of length of the sections in the member reports, it is hard to analyse these points <lb/>quantitatively, although certain tendencies can be observed. It is noted that no systematic distinction <lb/>between automatic and non-automatic export licensing is made in these reports and that export prohibitions <lb/>and licensing are being reviewed jointly. <lb/>12. <lb/>In many cases, quantitative restrictions are applied by governments in relation to Articles XI:1(a), <lb/>XX and XXI of GATT 1994. This includes conservation of exhaustible natural resources, environmental <lb/>7. <lb/>The Members reviewed in previous and present analysis are different, and the increase in the numbers results <lb/>partially from the fact that there were Members not subjected to analysis during 1997-2002. Still, several <lb/>Members which did not maintain export duties during 1997-2002 applied new measures during 2003-2008. <lb/></body>

			<body>protection, and control of weapons and arms trade. Where there are multilateral agreements or <lb/>arrangements, the legitimacy of export restrictions is well recognised, particularly in such areas as security, <lb/>life, public health, safety and environmental reasons. A good example is CITES, the convention on <lb/>international trade of endangered species of fauna and flora. This explains why most WTO members <lb/>maintain quantitative restrictions regarding exports of some products. Even countries which do not apply <lb/>export duties generally maintain quantitative restrictions on some exports. To a lesser degree, quantitative <lb/>restrictions are used for industrial policy objectives to help develop higher value-added downstream <lb/>industries. (See Annex 2 for comprehensive details.) <lb/>13. <lb/>In OECD (2003), around 20 Members described export quotas in response to restrictions by <lb/>importing members under the WTO Agreement on Textiles and Clothing (ATC). However, 1 January 2005 <lb/>marked the end of the ten-year transition period towards the elimination of quantitative restrictions on <lb/>imports of textile and clothing under the WTO ATC. Therefore, export quotas for this purpose disappeared <lb/>in many countries. International commodity agreements or arrangements are also stated as justification for <lb/>measures taken for agricultural products — such as sugar and coffee — diamonds and crude oil. 8 <lb/>Box 1. Illustrative list of rationales for export restrictions in TPRs <lb/>1. Export restrictions for non-economic reason: security <lb/>•  The United Nations Security Council Resolutions (e.g. sanctions against particular countries) <lb/> •  The Convention on Chemical Weapons <lb/> •  The Treaty on Nuclear Non-Proliferation <lb/> •  Multilateral export control arrangements (the Australia Group (to prevent the spread of chemical and<lb/>biological weapons); the Missile Technology Control Regime; the Nuclear Suppliers Group; the Zangger <lb/>Committee (control of nuclear materials and related high technology); the Wassenaar Arrangement (control <lb/>of exports of conventional weapons and dual use products) <lb/>2. Export restrictions for non-economic reason: life, public health, safety, and environmental reason <lb/>•  The Basel Convention on the Transboundary Movement of Hazardous Waste and their Disposal <lb/> •  The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Fauna and Flora (CITES) <lb/> •  The Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer<lb/>3. Export restrictions for economic reasons but in accordance with international or bilateral agreements or <lb/>arrangements <lb/>•  International commodities agreements on sugar, coffee, and petroleum<lb/>4. Export restrictions for maintenance of adequate supply of essential products; or for promotion of <lb/>downstream industries <lb/>•  Forestry products (such as log, timber) <lb/> •  Fishery products (including seasonable restraint for a biological rest period of fish) <lb/> •  Mineral products, metals, precious stones <lb/> •  Hides and skins and leather <lb/> •  Agricultural products (seasonal measures are introduced in some cases).<lb/>Note: This list is illustrative, not exhaustive. <lb/>8. <lb/>For example, the Kimberley Process Scheme certifies the origin of rough diamonds so as to prevent rebel <lb/>groups and their rivals from financing their war from diamond sales. <lb/></body>

			<body>C. <lb/>Major policy objectives <lb/>14. <lb/>The major policy objectives of export restrictions are: <lb/>• <lb/> Fiscal receipts or revenue purposes (export duties).<lb/>o Export duties may be seen as a reliable source of revenue, particularly in LDCs. 9 The <lb/>relative ease of implementing tax regulations through customs may make this an attractive <lb/>option for governments. Especially when international price is high, applying high tax <lb/>rates is sometimes used to address equity issues. <lb/>o This source of revenue is becoming less important for many countries. Although TPR <lb/>reports do not provide consistent data for all countries, the share of export duties in <lb/>government revenue is falling in several countries. In Ghana, the share of export duties in <lb/>total government revenue decreased from 11.4% (1998) to 2.3% (2005). In Thailand, the <lb/>contribution of export taxes to government revenue was only 0.3% of total tax revenue in <lb/>2005/06. The Philippine authorities also indicated that revenue from export taxes was <lb/>minimal. <lb/>o The exception is Argentina. Between 2002 and 2005, income from export duties <lb/>represented 9.9% of total public revenue. Following the peso devaluation in 2002, all <lb/>Argentine exports were again made subject to export duties. Since 2002, successive <lb/>resolutions have altered export tax rates, with increases on a significant number of <lb/>products. As of mid-2006, the applicable duties were 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 and 45% on the <lb/>f.o.b. value, depending on the products in question. However, during the TPR Q&amp;A in <lb/>2007, several Members questioned the necessity of this high tax rates considering change <lb/>of the economic situation during the last five years. <lb/>• <lb/> To protect and promote downstream processing industries by providing domestic industries with <lb/>cheap raw materials and inputs.<lb/>o Even in cases where countries do not present this as an explicit policy objective, this can <lb/>be a major implicit motivation for export restrictions. Either export duties or quantitative <lb/>restrictions are used for this purpose. 10 Still, considering the fact that the price differential <lb/>between domestic and export price is the key component for this purpose, export duties are <lb/>preferred for this purpose. <lb/>o Export restrictions provide downstream processing industries with an advantage. <lb/>Differential export duty rates play an important role in this regard: higher rates for raw <lb/>materials or input products while lower rates apply for finished products. For example, in <lb/>Argentina the export duty rates for soybean, soybean oil and biodiesel were 27.5%, 24.5%, <lb/>and 5% respectively as of 2007. 11 The price advantage provided to domestic downstream <lb/>9. <lb/>Among the 25 LDCs under TPR review between 2003-2009, 21 countries maintained export duties. <lb/>10. <lb/>For example, the WTO TPR paper provided that one of the major objectives of Indonesia&apos;s quantitative <lb/>restrictions was to promote higher value-added downstream industries. Mongolia&apos;s export prohibition of raw <lb/>hides and cashmere was also maintained to protect domestic processors. <lb/>11. <lb/>The rationale for differential export taxes was discussed during TPR process. When asked for the reason for <lb/>maintaining differential export taxes, Argentina stated that its existence and permanence was closely linked to <lb/>the payment capacity of each industry. Argentina further provided that the export tax rate differential was an <lb/></body>

			<body>industries can distort and reduce competition in both domestic and foreign markets. <lb/>(OECD, 2009c). <lb/>• <lb/> Social policy objectives, such as environmental protection or conservation of natural resources<lb/>o This is the most popular and basic policy objective of quantitative restriction on exports. <lb/>For these objectives, limiting the volume of trade is the key factor and that is why <lb/>quantitative restrictions are preferred in this regard. Still, to a lesser degree, export duties <lb/>are also used to achieve these policy objectives. 12 <lb/>o As stipulated in Article XX of GATT 1994, this objective is consistent with WTO rules <lb/>under certain conditions. 13 Therefore, even quantitative restrictions, which are generally <lb/>prohibited, can be justified if such measures meet certain conditions of WTO provisions. <lb/>o During the questions and answers exercise of the TPR, the Chinese government explained <lb/>that the application of interim export duties and the reduction of VAT rebates were aimed <lb/>at reducing exports of products that are highly energy consuming and polluting. Some <lb/>Members questioned the effectiveness of these measures, displaying concern that such <lb/>measures could result in increased domestic supply of products without a reduction in <lb/>production. 14 The Indonesian government stated environmental conservation as the <lb/>rationale for its export taxes on logs. In response to this justification, the TPR report <lb/>pointed out that lowering domestic log prices by export taxes would encourage processors <lb/>to expand production, but reduce the financial incentives for processors to adopt efficient, <lb/>less wasteful technology and processing practices, and that the incentives for owners of <lb/>natural resources to engage in conservation practices were diminished. Therefore, the <lb/>export taxes risk reducing incentives both for owners and processors to conserve and use <lb/>natural resources efficiently. 15 <lb/>o Objectives such as conservation of natural resources could be effectively addressed with <lb/>export restrictions if they actually result in a production decrease. However, without <lb/>corresponding measures to restrain domestic consumption, an export restriction does not <lb/>always lead to a decrease in production (OECD, 2009b). 16 In this regard, regulation on <lb/>production itself, rather than on trade, is an alternative option considering that market <lb/>instrument permitted by WTO rules and was equivalent to taxes on imports or the tariff escalation applied by <lb/>the majority of importing countries to stop entry of processed products. <lb/>12. <lb/>According to the TPR report on Angola, the authorities indicated that export duties were levied for the purpose <lb/>of environmental protection, particularly of flora and fauna. <lb/>13. <lb/>This policy consideration is reflected in Article XX(g) of GATT 1994 which allows exceptional quantitative <lb/>restrictions if such measures are made effective in conjunction with restrictions on domestic production or <lb/>consumption. <lb/>14. <lb/>See WTO Trade Policy Review Minutes of Meeting on China (WT/TPR/M/199/Add.1) <lb/>15. <lb/>See WTO Trade Policy Review Report by the Secretariat on Indonesia (WT/TPR/S/184) <lb/>16. <lb/>Although China applied export restrictions on molybdenum for conservation purposes, the production of <lb/>molybdenum in China has risen continuously, making the measure ineffective in fulfilling the stated policy <lb/>objective. <lb/></body>

			<body>imperfections arise in the production stage regardless of the domestic or international <lb/>destination of the products. 17 <lb/>• <lb/> Controlling inflationary pressures and securing domestic supply (especially regarding agricultural <lb/>products for food security).<lb/>o An increase in the international price of a commodity may create inflationary pressures. <lb/>Several governments rely on export restrictions as a policy tool to keep inflation under <lb/>control and thus maintain stable price for basic products. An export restriction, by <lb/>increasing domestic supply, reduces the domestic price of the product, thus partially <lb/>offsetting the inflationary pressures coming from higher prices abroad. 18 However, such <lb/>measures when applied by large countries that can influence world prices can have a <lb/>negative impact on the welfare of trading partners, especially those of small countries, by <lb/>reducing the supply to the world market and thus amplifying the negative aspects of the <lb/>initial high price (OECD, 2009c). <lb/>o Several governments responded to high food prices in 2007/08 with more trade-friendly <lb/>policy options. One of the most common policy responses has been to reduce or suspend <lb/>import tariffs on food products. Another response has been targeted cash transfers to <lb/>vulnerable groups. (FAO, 2008 and OECD, 2009a) <lb/>• <lb/> Other objectives: improving terms-of-trade and counteracting tariff escalation.<lb/>o An export tax on a particular commodity can improve the country&apos;s terms-of-trade — the <lb/>relative price of a country&apos;s exports compared to its imports — when applied by a large <lb/>country that has market power. Such a measure increases the world price of the <lb/>commodity, thus allowing the country to import more for each unit of the exported <lb/>commodity. <lb/>o Many developing countries, which represent a small fraction of world exports in a <lb/>particular commodity, do not possess such market power. This objective can be achieved <lb/>under the assumption that other countries do not retaliate by raising tariffs themselves <lb/>(Piermartini, 2004). Considering the difficulty of calculating optimal tax rates, there is also <lb/>a risk that application of too high rates will lead to a large welfare loss of the exporting <lb/>country (Piermartini, 2004 and OECD, 2009c). <lb/>o Export restrictions can also be used to counteract tariff escalation by importing countries. <lb/>Tariff escalation is the practice of charging higher import tariffs on processed goods than <lb/>on unprocessed ones. The use of export taxes was suggested by several countries as a <lb/>policy choice to reduce the impact of tariff escalation on their exports of processed <lb/>products. <lb/>17. <lb/>As the world&apos;s leading producer and supplier of copper, Chile responded to resource depletion by applying a <lb/>mining tax on the operating income of mine operators rather than relying on export restrictions. (OECD, <lb/>2009c) <lb/>18. <lb/>For example, in Argentina, MEP Resolution No. 114 of 8 March 2006 suspended exports of bovine livestock, <lb/>of the hoof, and of certain cuts and preparations and preserves of bovine meat for a period of 180 days. The <lb/>government justified this measure as necessary to maintain the stability of beef prices in the face of price <lb/>increases caused by external demand. Kazakhstan applied a temporary ban on wheat export in 2008 for the <lb/>same reason. <lb/></body>

			<body>o A study of tariff data suggests that the degree of escalation differs greatly across countries <lb/>and the tariff escalation found in some developing countries is more prominent than in <lb/>developed countries (Piermartini, 2004). Furthermore, to be an effective countermeasure, <lb/>the application of export taxes should focus on countries with the most significant level of <lb/>tariff escalation. However, in most cases identical duty rates are applied among importing <lb/>countries, therefore making the effectiveness of this approach doubtful. <lb/>15. <lb/>Although several governments apply export restrictions to achieve diverse policy objectives <lb/>indicated above, not all governments rely on these measures but use instead alternative policy options with <lb/>different trade impacts. This leads to the question of whether export restrictions are the most effective <lb/>option in achieving policy objectives and whether the measures achieve the objectives in the least trade <lb/>distorting ways compared with alternative options. <lb/>16. <lb/>Normally, export duties are applied on a limited number of products. However, in some <lb/>countries, export duties are applied generally covering all products. Especially among the LDCs, a general <lb/>export tax is more widely used as evidenced in Bangladesh, Chad, Gambia, and Niger for example. When <lb/>generally used, the rates tend to be in the low range. For example, both Bangladesh and Pakistan applied a <lb/>general export tax of 0.25%, and Cameroon applied a general 2% export tax. In several countries, actual <lb/>tax rates are lower than statutory rates, and administrative bodies can raise applied rates under the ceiling <lb/>rates without the legislative body&apos;s approval or consent. 19 This creates an element of uncertainty. <lb/>17. <lb/>Export duties, export quotas, and other forms of restrictions can be applied simultaneously so that <lb/>the overall assessment of measures is necessary to understand their total implications. For example, in <lb/>2005 China removed an 8% VAT rebate for exports of primary aluminium and, in addition, imposed a 5% <lb/>interim export tax. Reducing VAT rebate rates has the same effect as export duties in that they raise the <lb/>cost of exports, resulting in reduced exports volume. One interesting point regarding reduction of VAT is <lb/>that such measures are aimed at curbing exports while VAT rebate schemes for exports normally work as <lb/>export stimulus. <lb/>18. <lb/>Minimum export prices are applied either to achieve target export prices which are set to control <lb/>world market prices or to facilitate customs procedure – preventing under-invoicing. According to TPR <lb/>reports, the minimum export prices applied in the Philippines for rice and corn could have similar <lb/>economic effects as export taxes. In Brazil, however, a minimum export price was not used except as a <lb/>base to calculate export taxes. It is not clear, in some cases, whether minimum export prices are binding in <lb/>nature or just reference prices. <lb/>19. <lb/>Export restrictions of one country may induce similar measures from other exporting countries. <lb/>Once an export restriction is applied, it is likely that importing countries will shift their source of imports <lb/>to other countries (Dollive, 2008). The other exporting countries may then be forced to apply similar <lb/>measures in order to meet domestic demand by limiting their exports. 20 For example, according to <lb/>19. <lb/>For example, Pakistan can impose regulatory duties up to 100% on exports without parliamentary approval. <lb/>Egypt, although it does not currently impose export duties, can apply export tax up to 100% at any time <lb/>according to the relevant regulation. In Thailand, the persistence of relatively high statutory export taxes <lb/>leaves an element of uncertainty, as export taxes on important products, such as rice or rubber which are <lb/>subject to 0% export tax, could in principle be reintroduced up to the level of statutory rates (10% for rice, <lb/>40% for rubber) without legislative approval. <lb/>20. <lb/>A similar case can be also found in Ukraine. Ukraine applied wheat export restraints throughout 2007 in an <lb/>attempt to combat the impact of their drought and to keep local bread prices low. As a result, wheat export <lb/>from Ukraine decreased from 4 669.01 MT in 2006 to 1 056.65 MT in 2007. Exports of wheat from Russia <lb/>and Kazakhstan grew significantly in 2007, by 47.9% and 53.4% respectively. Although many factors may <lb/>have contributed to this export growth, export restraints in countries like Ukraine may have contributed to this <lb/></body>

			<body>Paraguayan authorities, the main reason cited for their application of export taxes on hides and soybeans is <lb/>the lack of raw materials for the domestic processing industry and the increase in exports of unprocessed <lb/>products, taking into account the distortion created in subregional trade by the taxes on hide exports <lb/>applied by Argentina and Uruguay. 21 This interaction can lead, in principle, to a situation of competitive <lb/>policy practices – and of increasingly higher export taxes (OECD, 2009b). <lb/>20. <lb/>The lack of predictability is a concern for several WTO Members. In the 2007 TPR process of <lb/>Argentina, some Members expressed concern that although export duties were applied in 2002 on a <lb/>temporary basis under Resolution No.11/2002, neither the resolution itself nor its complementary or <lb/>amendatory regulations have contained any timetable for the phasing out of these duties. <lb/>21. <lb/>The WTO accession process can contribute to the discipline on export duties, but results vary <lb/>across countries. At the time of its WTO accession in 1996, Bulgaria applied a range of export taxes for the <lb/>purpose of preventing or relieving critical shortages of foodstuffs and other essential products. However, it <lb/>undertook commitments to minimize such measures upon accession, and the TPR paper in 2003 provided <lb/>that Bulgaria no longer imposed any duties on exported products. During the accession negotiations, China <lb/>committed not to apply export duties other than on 84 items listed in its Annex. 22 According to the TPR <lb/>report in 2007, China applied statutory export duties on 88 items. In addition, China applied interim export <lb/>duties on 174 products, 64 of which were also subject to statutory export duties. In January 2008, the <lb/>coverage of interim export duties increased to 334 lines at the HS 8-digit level. Considering this binding <lb/>commitment, a question arose regarding the consistency of the interim export duties with WTO disciplines. <lb/>China replied that like other WTO members, China had the right to invoke Article XX of GATT 1994 to <lb/>implement necessary export restriction measures on exhaustible natural resources, and its measures were <lb/>based on this clause. <lb/>D. <lb/>Economic implications <lb/>22. <lb/>Export duties raise the cost of exported products, resulting in decreased export volumes. Reduced <lb/>exports may divert some supply to the domestic market, leading to a downward pressure on domestic <lb/>prices. Through this supply-side effect on international and domestic markets, export duties can create a <lb/>differential between the price available to domestic processors and the price charged to foreign processors. <lb/>This differential can provide an advantage to domestic downstream processors vis-à-vis foreign processors. <lb/>In this sense, an export duty acts as an implicit subsidy for the domestic processing industries, providing <lb/>them with an artificial competitive advantage. The economic implications vary according to the extent to <lb/>which the exporting country can affect the world market price of the taxed product. A supplier with a large <lb/>world market share will induce a stronger effect on world markets than will a small supplier. Quantitative <lb/>restrictions, by reducing the quantity of exports, induce similar effects as export duties. <lb/>shift in market share. By 2008, Russia and Kazakhstan also implemented export restrictions. In late January <lb/>2008, Russia announced that it would levy a 40% export duty on wheat for exports bound outside of its <lb/>customs union. In February, Russia tightened the export restrictions, extending the export duties to its customs <lb/>union. Kazakhstan followed by levying export duties on wheat in March. It banned wheat export from 15 April <lb/>2008 until 1 September 2008. Ukraine export restrictions not only forced importing countries to look <lb/>elsewhere, but also may have contributed to the decision by other exporting countries to apply similar <lb/>measures, further limiting the international supply of the commodity. See Dollive, Kendall (2008) The Impact <lb/>of Export Restrictions on Rising Grain Prices, USITC, www.usitc.gov and OECD (2009) Agricultural Policies <lb/>in Emerging Economies 2009: Monitoring and Evaluation. <lb/>21. <lb/>See WTO Trade Policy Review Report by the Secretariat on Paraguay (WT/TPR/S/146) <lb/>22. <lb/>See Report of the Working Party on the Accession of China (WT/ACC/CHN/49) <lb/></body>

			<body>23. <lb/>Export restrictions result in an efficiency loss in both the exporting and the importing country. <lb/>Consumption distortions result from the fact that too much of the taxed product is consumed domestically, <lb/>while foreign consumers consume too little. Production distortions result from the fact that too much is <lb/>produced in the exporting country&apos;s downstream industry, while too little is produced in the importing <lb/>country&apos;s downstream industry. This production efficiency loss is sometimes justified by the &quot; infant <lb/>industry &quot; argument, i.e. to provide an incentive for the development of a higher value-added industry. It is <lb/>not clear whether this infant industry strategy leads to successful results. 23 <lb/>24. <lb/>Export restrictions can also affect long-term investment and production response. For example, <lb/>when international food prices are high, one observed policy response is to ensure household food security <lb/>by lowering domestic food prices. Although there are other methods for this purpose, such as reducing <lb/>tariffs, some food exporting countries have chosen to reduce domestic prices by applying export duties on <lb/>agricultural products. However, imposition of export duties reduces incentives for the suppliers to increase <lb/>their production and investment, which will decrease long-term supply, thereby aggravating international <lb/>price increases. The long-term solution to high international prices would be to increase the international <lb/>supply of the products (World Bank, 2008 and OECD, 2008). Price volatility and unstable supplies caused <lb/>by export restrictions create an insecure business environment. This is important regarding the mining <lb/>industry where investments are long-term and require large amounts of capital. The uncertainty, by <lb/>delaying investment in this industry, can have a negative impact on the supply of raw materials. <lb/>IV. <lb/>Current disciplines in the WTO <lb/>A. <lb/>Substantive regulations: uneven discipline between export duties and quantitative restrictions <lb/>25. <lb/>There is no single GATT/WTO article dealing exclusively with export restrictions. Still, <lb/>Article XI of the GATT 1994 is the key provision regarding export restrictions. It prohibits the use of <lb/>quantitative restrictions regarding both imports and exports. It states that &quot; no prohibitions or restrictions <lb/>other than duties, taxes or other charges, whether made effective through quotas, import or export licences <lb/>or other measures, shall be instituted or maintained by any contracting party (on the importation of any <lb/>product destined for the territory of any other contracting party or) on the exportation or sale for export of <lb/>any product for the territory of any other contracting party. &quot; Therefore, export duties are in principle not <lb/>subject to Article XI and thus not prohibited under this article, while quantitative restrictions are. <lb/>26. <lb/>Regarding quantitative restrictions which are generally prohibited, the issue is whether these <lb/>measures can be exceptionally allowed under Article XI:2 (a) (critical shortage of foodstuffs), Article XX <lb/>(General Exceptions) and Article XXI (Security Exceptions). Article XI:2(a) allows each Member to apply <lb/>export restrictions &quot; temporarily &quot; to prevent or relieve &quot; critical &quot; shortage of foodstuffs or other products <lb/>essential to the exporting country. Article 12 of the Agreement on Agriculture (disciplines on export <lb/>prohibition and restriction) stipulates in detail when quantitative restrictions on exports are exceptionally <lb/>allowed. 24 Article XX allows exceptional quantitative restrictions for policy objectives such as <lb/>23. <lb/>For example, in Cameroon, to encourage value added and ensure the supply of local wood for processing <lb/>industries, the entire log production must be processed on site, and for many species log exports are prohibited <lb/>since 2004. For the others, exports require a prior permit from the National Forestry Development Office <lb/>(ONADEF). Also, exports are subject to a tax of 17.5% of the f.o.b. value of log (unprocessed wood), and a <lb/>tax of 2% on other products. However, according to the authorities, the loss brought about by prohibiting <lb/>exports of most logs has not been offset by an increase of processed timber. <lb/>24. <lb/>It requires members introducing new export restrictions on foodstuffs in accordance with Article XI:2(a) of <lb/>GATT 1994 to give due consideration to the effects of such restrictions on the importing member&apos;s food <lb/>security. Members, except non-net exporting developing countries, must notify the Committee on Agriculture <lb/>before introducing new export restrictions on foodstuffs, and must consult with affected members. <lb/></body>

			<body>conservation of exhaustible natural resources, and ensuring essential materials for domestic processing <lb/>industry under &quot; certain qualifications. &quot; 25 However, the article also makes it clear that the exception should <lb/>not be abused for protection purposes. 26 Article XXI exception applies to measures for the purpose of <lb/>international safety. 27 <lb/>27. <lb/>Article II:1 (b) of the GATT 1994 prohibits all import duties other than ordinary customs duties <lb/>on products bound in Schedules of Concessions. 28 In contrast, no provisions specifically require a binding <lb/>obligation of export duties like import duties. Still, the MFN principle explicitly applies to export duties in <lb/>Article I of the GATT 1994 and relevance of the WTO Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing <lb/>measures was invoked under the WTO dispute setttlement scheme. 29 <lb/>28. <lb/>As is evidenced in WTO dispute cases 30 and in WTO TPR reports, export duties and quantitative <lb/>restrictions are just different forms of export restrictions, and in this sense are substitutes or supplements to <lb/>each other. It is also clear that prohibitively high export duties will induce the same effect as export <lb/>25. <lb/>For example, (g) relating to the conservation of exhaustible natural resources if such measure are made <lb/>effective in conjunction with restrictions on domestic production or consumption; (i) involving restrictions on <lb/>exports of domestic materials necessary to ensure essential quantities of such materials to a domestic <lb/>processing industry during periods when the domestic price of such materials is held below the world price as <lb/>part of a governmental stabilization plan; Provided that such restrictions shall not operate to increase the <lb/>exports of or the protection afforded to such domestic industry, and shall not depart from the provisions of this <lb/>Agreement relating to non-discrimination; (j) essential to the acquisition or distribution of products in general <lb/>or local short supply; Provided that any such measures shall be consistent with the principle that all contracting <lb/>parties are entitled to an equitable share of the international supply of such products, and that any such <lb/>measures, which are inconsistent with the other provisions of the Agreement shall be discontinued as soon as <lb/>the conditions giving rise to them have ceased to exist… <lb/>26. <lb/>The introductory paragraph (Chapeau) of Article XX provides that exception is allowed &quot; subject to the <lb/>requirement that measures are not applied in a manner which would constitute a means of arbitrary or <lb/>unjustifiable discrimination between countries where the same conditions prevail, or a disguised restriction on <lb/>international trade. &quot; <lb/>27. <lb/>For example, (b)(ii) relating to the traffic in arms, ammunition and implements of war and to such traffic in <lb/>other goods and materials as is carried on directly or indirectly for the purpose of supplying a military <lb/>establishment; (c) any action in pursuance of its obligation under the United Nations Charter for the <lb/>maintenance of international peace and security. <lb/>28. <lb/>The products described in Part I of the Schedule relating to any contracting party, which are the products of <lb/>territories of other contracting parties, shall, on their importation into the territory to which the Schedule <lb/>relates, and subject to the terms, conditions or qualifications set forth in that Schedule, be exempt from <lb/>ordinary customs duties in excess of those set forth and provided therein. Such products shall also be exempt <lb/>from all other duties or charges of any kind imposed on or in connection with the importation in excess of <lb/>those imposed on the date of this Agreement or those directly and mandatorily required to be imposed <lb/>thereafter by legislation in force in the importing territory on that date. <lb/>29. <lb/>See WTO panel report on measures treating export restraints as subsidies (WT/DS194/R). Herbert Smith <lb/>(2009) even discusses the possibility of applying the WTO Anti-dumping Agreement (ADA). Dumping occurs <lb/>when the export price of a product is less than its normal value. Although normal value is usually the domestic <lb/>price in the exporting country, the ADA allows members to construct normal value when domestic price does <lb/>not represent normal value. If processed products are benefiting from a raw material price advantage caused by <lb/>export restrictions, it may be possible to construct normal value reflecting this market condition. <lb/>30. <lb/>In two dispute cases, the agreed solution was to transform quantitative restrictions to export duties. The <lb/>solution after the EC-Pakistan dispute on Pakistan&apos;s export prohibition on hides and skins resulted in the <lb/>replacement of prohibition by a 20% export duty. When disputed by EC, India also removed export restrictions <lb/>on hides/skins and leather and introduced export duties on these products. In both cases, the parties to the <lb/>dispute reached an agreement without establishment of panel. <lb/></body>

			<body>prohibitions. However, under the current WTO scheme, quantitative restrictions on exports are in principle <lb/>prohibited while export duties are allowed, and will lead to more frequent use of export duties than <lb/>quantitative restrictions. Export duties will increase government revenue, which is especially important to <lb/>LDCs; in addition, tax schemes are more transparent and less subject to discretion than are quantitative <lb/>restrictions. However, lack of substantive regulations on export duties means there is no multilateral <lb/>agreement to prevent the abuse of export duties. <lb/>B. <lb/>Transparency and notification <lb/>29. <lb/>Article X of the GATT 1994 requires a Member to: 1) publish its trade-related laws, regulations, <lb/>rulings and agreements in prompt and accessible manner; 2) abstain from enforcing measures of general <lb/>application prior to their publication; and 3) administer the above mentioned laws, regulations, rulings and <lb/>agreements in a uniform, impartial and reasonable manner. The paramount objective of this article is <lb/>transparency. Export restrictions are subject to this article considering its regulatory nature and effects on <lb/>trade. Therefore, the general rule of transparency applies to both export duties and quantitative restrictions <lb/>but no more than that; no obligation of notification under this article. <lb/>30. <lb/>The Decisions at Marrakesh include a Notification Procedure that has an indicative list of <lb/>notifiable measures. This list includes: quantitative restrictions, other non-tariff measures such as licensing; <lb/>export taxes, and export restrictions, including voluntary export restraints and orderly marketing <lb/>arrangements. 31 However, a note to this indicative list states that it does not alter existing notification <lb/>requirements in the Multilateral Trade Agreements and the Plurilateral Trade Agreements of the WTO. In <lb/>this sense, the initiative proposed by the United States, Japan, Korea and Chinese Taipei regarding export <lb/>licensing is one example of efforts undertaken to enhance transparency regarding export restrictions. <lb/>31. <lb/>After the Uruguay Round, a decision by the Council for Trade in Goods (CTG) in 1995 created <lb/>procedures on biennial notification of quantitative restrictions. 32 The format of the notification does not <lb/>include export duties or taxes, seeming to reflect current disciplines on Article XI and relevant provisions <lb/>which exclude export duties from the application. The other decision by the CTG in 1995 established so <lb/>called reverse notification procedures to allow Members to indicate specific non tariff measures of other <lb/>Members for transparency purpose, but this process has rarely been used by Members. 33 Therefore, no <lb/>decisions specifically entail a notification obligation of export duties. <lb/>31. <lb/>Notifiable measures; Tariffs (including range and scope of bindings, GSP provisions, rates applied to members <lb/>of free-trade areas/customs unions, other preferences), tariff quotas and surcharges, Quantitative restrictions, <lb/>including voluntary export restraints and orderly marketing arrangements affecting imports, Other non-tariff <lb/>measures such as licensing and mixing requirements; variable levies, Custom valuation, Rules of origin, <lb/>government procurement, technical barriers, safeguard actions, anti-dumping actions, Countervailing actions, <lb/>Export taxes, Export subsidies, tax exemptions and concessionary export financing, Free-trade zones, <lb/>including in-bond manufacturing, Export restrictions, including voluntary export restraints and orderly <lb/>marketing arrangements, Other government assistance, including subsidies, tax exemptions, Role of state-<lb/>trading enterprise, Foreign exchange controls related to imports and exports, Government-mandated <lb/>countertrade, Any other measure covered by the Multilateral Trade Agreements in ANNEX 1A to the WTO <lb/>Agreement (Ministerial Decision on Notification Procedures adopted by the Trade Negotiating Committee on <lb/>15 December 1993). <lb/>32 <lb/>G/L/59 &quot; Members shall make complete notification of the quantitative restrictions which they maintain by <lb/>31 January 1996 and at two-yearly intervals thereafter… &quot; <lb/>33 <lb/>G/L/60 Decision on Reverse Notification of Non-Tariff Measures. Only two reverse notifications for this <lb/>purpose have been found in the WTO documents. <lb/></body>

			<body>32. <lb/>In summary, explicit disciplines on export duties are very limited except the MFN principle <lb/>under Article I of GATT 1994 and the general transparency requirement (e.g. publication of regulations) <lb/>under the Article X of the GATT 1994. No country engages in the scheduling and notification of export <lb/>duties, in contrast to the strict scheduling of import duties. <lb/>C. <lb/>WTO Accession <lb/>33. <lb/>Since the creation of WTO, the accession process has provided certain disciplines on export <lb/>restrictions thus complementing GATT 1994, 34 especially regarding export duties for several countries <lb/>(Table 3). Regarding export duties, although there is no binding schedule for the existing Members, many <lb/>new Members committed to bind their export duty rates. Notably in the case of China, 84 specific items <lb/>have been scheduled, with the commitment to eliminate all export duties except on these items. The <lb/>schedule indicates the rate of bound export duties. Export restrictions were also one of the topics in the <lb/>discussion on Russia&apos;s accession. 35 <lb/>34. <lb/>The necessity and efforts to provide more discipline on export restrictions were not always shared <lb/>among WTO members. During Ukraine&apos;s accession negotiation, some Members stated that Ukraine&apos;s <lb/>export duties were very high, with a strong trade-distorting impact, and in some cases too prohibitive for <lb/>trade. A Member noted that Ukraine appeared to apply trade-related investment measures (TRIM) by <lb/>granting an exemption from export duties to agricultural producers, contingent on the production of certain <lb/>agricultural commodities. In contrast, some developing country Members had a positive view of export <lb/>duties as a development instrument. Other Members noted that the imposition of export duties was not <lb/>inconsistent with WTO rules. 36 <lb/>34 <lb/>Paragraph 1.2 of Part I of the Accession Protocol makes it clear that the Protocol, including the commitments <lb/>referred in the Working Party Report, shall be an integral part of the WTO Agreement. <lb/>35 <lb/>In the accession process of Russia, export duties on minerals, petrochemicals, natural gas, raw hides and skins, <lb/>ferrous and non-ferrous metals and scraps, etc., were discussed. WTO Members argued that in case where <lb/>Russia is the dominant supplier, third country buyers would suffer from increased costs because of the high <lb/>price of the product and would encounter insufficient supplies of the goods. They pointed out that the loss of <lb/>relative competitiveness in the global market for downstream products vis-à-vis Russian products should be <lb/>taken into account. Wheat (40%), log (25%), palladium/rhenium/titanium (6.5%), copper (10%) are several <lb/>examples of products subject to export tax since 2008. <lb/>36. <lb/>See Ukraine Accession document WT/ACC/UKR/152. <lb/></body>

			<body>Table 3. Examples of disciplines undertaken at the time of WTO accessions (since 2001) <lb/>China <lb/>(2001) <lb/>China shall eliminate all taxes and charges applied to exports unless specifically provided for in <lb/>Annex 6 of this Protocol or applied in conformity with the provisions of Article VIII of the GATT 1994. <lb/>(section 11.3. of protocol) (Annex 6 indicates 84 products and rate of export duties.(ANNEX 2)) <lb/>The representative of China confirmed that China would abide by WTO rules in respect of non-<lb/>automatic export licensing and export restrictions. The Foreign Trade Law would also be brought into <lb/>conformity with GATT requirements. Moreover, export restrictions and licensing would only be applied, <lb/>after the date of accession, in those cases where this was justified by GATT provisions. The Working <lb/>Party took note of these commitments. <lb/>Armenia <lb/>(2003) <lb/>The representative of Armenia confirmed that any export licensing requirements or other export control <lb/>requirements would be applied in conformity with WTO provisions including those contained in Articles <lb/>XI, XVII, XX and XXI of the GATT 1994. The Working Party took note of this commitment. <lb/>Cambodia <lb/>(2004) <lb/>The representative of Cambodia said that Cambodia levied export taxes on certain unprocessed raw <lb/>materials and products to encourage local processing, encourage exports of finished products and to <lb/>protect human health. <lb/>The representative of Cambodia stated that, from the date of accession, Cambodia would ensure that it <lb/>applied its laws and regulations governing export measures and would act in conformity with the <lb/>relevant provisions of the WTO, including Articles I and XI of the GATT 1994 and the Agreement on <lb/>Subsidies and Countervailing Measures. The Working Party took note of this commitment. <lb/>Vietnam <lb/>(2007) <lb/>The representative of Vietnam confirmed that with regard to export duties on ferrous and non-ferrous <lb/>scrap metals (35, 45%), Vietnam would reduce export duties in accordance with its commitment on <lb/>export duties (Table 17 in Annex 2). <lb/>The representative of Vietnam confirmed that, upon accession, any remaining export restrictions and <lb/>management measures would be applied in a manner fully consistent with WTO provisions. The <lb/>Working Party took note of this commitment. <lb/>Ukraine <lb/>(2008) <lb/>The representative of Ukraine confirmed that Ukraine would reduce export duties in accordance with <lb/>the binding schedule, and that as regarding these products, Ukraine would not increase export duties, <lb/>nor apply other measures having an equivalent effect, unless justified under the exceptions of the <lb/>GATT 1994. The representative also confirmed that from the date of accession, Ukraine will not apply <lb/>any obligatory minimum export prices. <lb/>The representative of Ukraine confirmed that from the date of accession, the export licensing <lb/>requirements and other export restrictions and control requirements listed or any introduced in the <lb/>future would be applied in conformity with WTO provisions, including those contained in Articles XI, <lb/>XVII, XX and XXI of the GATT 1994. The export ban on nonferrous scrap metal would be eliminated <lb/>and Ukraine would remove current export restrictions on grains and precious metals and stones other <lb/>than gold, silver, and diamonds, as from the date of accession. The Working Party took note of this <lb/>commitment. <lb/></body>

			<body>V. <lb/>Evolving disciplines in bilateral/multilateral levels <lb/>A. <lb/>Regional and bilateral disciplines <lb/>35. <lb/>Regional trade agreements (RTAs) include, to a varying degree, disciplines on export restrictions. <lb/>Several regional trade agreements, in contrast to the WTO, include disciplines on export duties. For <lb/>example, NAFTA, EU-Mexico, Australia-New Zealand (ANZCER), and Japan-Singapore (JSEPA) <lb/>agreements in principle prohibit export duties. The growing tendency in Europe and in the Western <lb/>Hemisphere to restrict export duties has been well recognised in both a bilateral context and in regional <lb/>trade agreements. <lb/>36. <lb/>In the EU, Article 25 of the Treaty establishing the European Community stipulates that custom <lb/>duties on imports and exports and charges having equivalent effect shall be prohibited between Member <lb/>States. This prohibition shall also apply to customs duties of a fiscal nature. Article 29 provides that <lb/>quantitative restrictions on exports, and all measures having equivalent effect, shall be prohibited between <lb/>Member States. Although there are exceptions to this general prohibition on quantitative restrictions, these <lb/>exceptions do not apply to export duties. 37 <lb/>37. <lb/>The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) is also stringent regarding export <lb/>restrictions. Article 314 of the NAFTA imposes a prohibition on export taxes, subject to a Mexican <lb/>exception for basic foods set out in Annex 314. Regarding quantitative restrictions, it provides general <lb/>rules in line with Article XI of the GATT 1994. Article 315 further specifies the conditions of exceptions <lb/>in Articles XI:2(a) or XX(g), (i) or (j) of the GATT 1994 by articulating detailed requirements such as <lb/>comparison of trade volumes. 38 Overall, these provisions help to enhance transparency and narrow the <lb/>scope of unpredictability by articulating regulations in annexes and detailed requirements in the provisions. <lb/>38. <lb/>In Article 2.8 of the US-Morocco FTA agreement, the Parties undertook not to adopt or maintain <lb/>any prohibition or restriction on the export of any good to the other Party, except as provided in the <lb/>Agreement and in accordance with Article XI of the GATT 1994. Article 2.10 provides that except as <lb/>provided in Annex 2-C, neither Party may adopt or maintain any tax, duty, or other charge on the export of <lb/>any good to the territory of the other Party, unless the tax, duty, or charge is also adopted or maintained on <lb/>the good when destined for domestic consumption. 39 <lb/>37. <lb/>Article 30 provides that Article 29 shall not preclude prohibitions or restrictions on imports, exports or goods <lb/>in transit justified on grounds of public morality, public policy or public security; the protection of health and <lb/>life of humans, animals or plants; the protection of national treasures possessing artistic, historic or <lb/>archaeological value; or the protection of industrial and commercial property. Such prohibitions or restrictions <lb/>shall not, however, constitute a means of arbitrary discrimination or a disguised restriction on trade between <lb/>Member States. <lb/>38. <lb/>Article 315 (Mexico is exempted by Annex 315) provides that a Party may adopt or maintain a restriction <lb/>otherwise justified under Article XI:2(a) or XX(g), (i) or (j) of the GATT with respect to the export of the <lb/>Party to the territory of another Party, only if: (a) the restriction does not reduce the proportion of the total <lb/>export shipments of the specific good made available to that other Party relative to the total supply of that <lb/>good of the Party maintaining the restrictions as compared to the proportion prevailing in the most recent 36-<lb/>month period. <lb/>39. <lb/>Annex 2-C stipulates that Article 2.10 shall not apply to a tax on exports of processed or unprocessed <lb/>phosphates, provided that the tax rate is no higher than 34 dirhams per ton of unprocessed phosphates, for five <lb/>years beginning on the date of entry into force of this agreement. <lb/></body>

			<body>39. <lb/>Other RTAs include disciplines similar to those under the WTO. For example, Article 2.5 of the <lb/>India-Singapore FTA agreement provides that neither Party may adopt or maintain any non-tariff measures <lb/>on the export of any goods to the other party except in accordance with its WTO rights and obligations or <lb/>in accordance with other provisions of the agreement. The Australia-Thailand RTA stipulates that the <lb/>Parties are not allowed to adopt or maintain any prohibition or restriction on the export or sale for export of <lb/>any good, except in accordance with Article XI of the GATT, but this does not deal with export duties. 40 <lb/>Some RTAs do not include any discipline at all. In either China-Chile or China-Pakistan RTAs, there is no <lb/>provision on export duties. China, in its question and response paper regarding its RTA with Chile, made it <lb/>clear that it did not have any clause regarding export duties in its FTAs with other countries. 41 <lb/>40. <lb/>The fewer countries involved in negotiations, the easier to compromise and reach a conclusion, <lb/>and hence several RTAs were relatively more successful in disciplining export restrictions than the <lb/>multilateral forum of the WTO. However, it should be also noted that bilateral negotiations were not very <lb/>successful in restraining export restrictions of countries which were major users of such measures. 42 <lb/>B. <lb/>Doha Development Agenda (DDA) Negotiations <lb/>B1. <lb/>Non-Agricultural Market Access (NAMA) Negotiations <lb/>41. <lb/>Since the creation of the Negotiating Group on Market Access for Non-Agricultural Products in <lb/>the context of the Doha Development Agenda (DDA), countries have communicated their thoughts about <lb/>the scope and modalities of the future negotiations, inter alia in the non-tariff field. Export duties have <lb/>been mentioned several times. Included in its draft modalities is a textual proposal from the EU on export <lb/>taxes. 43 In that proposal, the EU provided the following reasons as to why export taxes pose serious <lb/>difficulties for trade liberalization: 1) export taxes can have serious distortive effects on global commodity <lb/>trade especially when applied by major suppliers; 2) when used for industrial or trade policy purposes, <lb/>export taxes can serve as indirect subsidization of processing industries and influence international trading <lb/>conditions of these goods; and 3) export taxes can serve to displace imports on the market of the country <lb/>imposing the taxes, both for imported goods in direct competition with the taxed products and for imported <lb/>processed products. Among the reasons for the growing importance of export taxes today are inter alia: the <lb/>recent proliferation in the use of these instruments, which is possible under the weaker WTO rules on <lb/>export taxes compared to those on import restrictions or other forms of NTMs; and the shortfall of global <lb/>supply of some specific commodities, despite their abundance in a few countries – a situation that is <lb/>aggravated by export taxes in key supplying countries. 44 <lb/>42. <lb/>The European Union (EU) emphasized that any approach should ensure increased transparency <lb/>and predictability. Concerning transparency, Members should be fully informed of measures taken by any <lb/>other Member that may influence trade. The EU also considered that scheduling and binding of Members&apos; <lb/>export taxes could offer an appropriate route of ensuring adequate predictability. This approach would <lb/>40. <lb/>See Factual Presentation regarding Australia-Thailand Free Trade Agreement (WT/REG185/3). <lb/>41. <lb/>See Question and replies regarding China-Chile FTA (WT/REG230/2). <lb/>42. <lb/>For example, although China is one of major users of export restrictions, there is no effective discipline on <lb/>such measures in six RTAs (including Hong Kong and Macao) it joined. <lb/>43. <lb/>See Draft Modalities for Non-agricultural Market Access, Fourth Edition (TN/MA/W/103/Rev.3). <lb/>44. <lb/>According to 2006 EC proposal (TN/MA/W11/Add.6), export taxes are used for the purpose of (or otherwise <lb/>having the effect of) (1) artificially transferring gains from trade between WTO Members; (2) creating unfair <lb/>advantages for domestic industries involved in international trade at the expense of other WTO Members&apos; <lb/>producers; or (3) evading existing WTO disciplines on export restrictions by shifting to more or less <lb/>prohibitive taxes on the exportation of goods. <lb/></body>

			<body>imply that (1) WTO Members should notify the introduction or modification of export taxes and (2) WTO <lb/>Members should undertake to schedule export taxes in their Schedules of Concessions and bind the export <lb/>taxes at a level to be negotiated with exceptions. 45 <lb/>43. <lb/>Regarding transparency, there was a significant initiative by several countries including the <lb/>United States, Japan and Korea. 46 This initiative concentrates on export licensing which is another form of <lb/>export restrictions. According to this proposal, export licensing is defined as any administrative procedures <lb/>involving the submission of an application or other documentation (other than that required for customs <lb/>purposes) to the relevant administrative body or bodies as a prior condition for exportation. It requires each <lb/>country to notify, in writing, existing measures on export licensing and any new measures on export <lb/>licensing within 60 days after the effective date of the new measures. Each country, upon request by any <lb/>WTO member, is also required to provide all relevant information including, among others, the export <lb/>licenses granted over a recent period and other measures taken in conjunction with export licensing <lb/>regarding restrictions on domestic production or consumption. Finally, according to this proposal, the <lb/>Committee on market access would review at least once every two years the implementation and operation <lb/>of this protocol. <lb/>B2. <lb/>Agriculture negotiations <lb/>44. <lb/>Export restrictions were also discussed during the DDA agriculture negotiations. Most <lb/>participants agreed that some disciplines were needed to ensure stable supplies for importing countries. <lb/>Japan stated that in view of redressing the imbalances of the rights and obligations between importing and <lb/>exporting countries, and of maintaining the food security of food-importing countries, rules and disciplines <lb/>on export-promoting and export-restricting measures should be established. 47 They proposed converting <lb/>export restrictions to taxes that would then be reduced (similar to tariffication of import restrictions). Korea <lb/>proposed that rules and disciplines on export competition should be transparent and contribute to the <lb/>overall balance of rights and obligations between exporting countries and importing countries. In this <lb/>regard, disciplines with the following objectives are needed: (i) to prohibit exporting countries from <lb/>imposing export restrictions and prohibitions arbitrarily; and (ii) to prohibit the use of export tax for the <lb/>purpose of export restrictions. 48 Switzerland stated that disciplines are necessary in order to ensure that <lb/>45. <lb/>The exception includes that (a) least-developed countries would undertake to schedule export taxes but may <lb/>maintain these export taxes unbound and (b) paragraph 6 countries (developing country Members with no final <lb/>bound total AMS commitments) would schedule export taxes but may maintain these export taxes unbound for <lb/>a certain number of tariff lines (the number is to be negotiated), in reflection of their specific development <lb/>interests and concerns. <lb/>46. <lb/>See Protocol on Transparency in Export Licensing to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1994 <lb/>(TN/MA/W/15/Add.4/Rev.5) which was proposed by Chinese Taipei, Japan, Korea, Ukraine and the United <lb/>States. <lb/>47. <lb/>Japan specifically proposed: (1) to tariffy all export prohibitions and restrictions (by replacing them with <lb/>export taxes); (2) to bind all export taxes (including those possibly introduced in the future) (for products <lb/>subject to the export tax, to establish quotas in which a certain amount of exports will be exempt from the <lb/>export tax), and (3) in the case where temporary and short-term measures to restrict exports become necessary <lb/>before export taxes are introduced, to clarify the disciplines applied on such emergency measures used in order <lb/>to adjust the volume of exports. Measures for clarifying such disciplines are (i) to establish strict requirements <lb/>for the application of such emergency measures; (ii) to introduce consultations with other Members as a <lb/>prerequisite for imposing emergency measures, and to clarify the measures to be taken when the consultations <lb/>do not result in a satisfactory solution; (iii) to obligate Members, when introducing emergency measures, to <lb/>maintain the proportion of exports to domestic production at the level of preceding x years, in order to allow <lb/>importing countries to secure the necessary level of imports; and (iv) to limit the duration of such emergency <lb/>measures.

			<body>measures taken for the purpose of achieving social objectives do not harm the interests of other countries, <lb/>and proposed the elimination of all export restrictions on agricultural products and the binding at zero of all <lb/>export tariffs (with a flexibility clause for the LDCs). 49 The United States proposed to prohibit the use of <lb/>export taxes, including differential export taxes, for competitive advantage or supply management <lb/>purposes. 50 The most recent draft modalities for agriculture includes clauses that introduce tightened <lb/>disciplines for new export restrictions with increased transparency and monitoring. 51 <lb/>45. <lb/>Exporting countries, while agreeing that tighter disciplines would provide Members with more <lb/>stable access to agricultural products, emphasized the interrelation between tariff escalation and export <lb/>restrictions. 52 According to them, tariff escalation hinders the capacity of exporting countries to develop <lb/>processing industries. In particular, it prevents developing countries from adding value to their exports. As <lb/>a response to tariff escalation, some developing countries have taken recourse to restricting or taxing their <lb/>raw material exports. The Cairns Group proposed that the agriculture negotiations should (i) develop both <lb/>improved disciplines on export restrictions and taxes and eliminate tariff escalation; and (ii) preserve <lb/>Article 12.2 of the Agreement on Agriculture and provide additional special and differential treatment <lb/>provisions to address the legitimate needs of developing countries, including least developed and net food-<lb/>importing developing countries. <lb/>VI. <lb/>Conclusion and policy implications <lb/>46. <lb/>Export restrictions are applied to achieve diverse policy objectives: increasing government <lb/>revenue, stabilizing inflationary pressure, promoting downstream industry, conserving natural resources, <lb/>etc. However, the effectiveness of these measures is questionable. Furthermore, export restrictions may <lb/>result in efficiency losses. Furthermore, export restrictions, by lowering domestic prices, can reduce <lb/>incentives for the suppliers to increase their production and investment, which can aggravate international <lb/>price instability. In this sense, when designing and applying such measures, policy makers should consider <lb/>several factors: (1) whether the measures are effective in achieving policy objectives, (2) whether the <lb/>benefit outweighs the cost of the measures, and (3) whether the measures achieve the objectives in the least <lb/>trade distorting ways. <lb/>47. <lb/>Export duties and quantitative restrictions are substitutable policy tools as indicated in TPR <lb/>papers. Considering this nature, uneven discipline under the current WTO scheme may induce more use of <lb/>export duties. More reliance on export duties is, in a sense, consistent with the tariffication scheme of the <lb/>WTO regarding imports restriction. The problem is that unlike imports tariff which is regulated by binding <lb/>49. <lb/>See Switzerland&apos;s Proposal for WTO negotiation on Agriculture (G/AG/NG/W/94). <lb/>50. <lb/>See US Proposal for comprehensive long-term Agricultural Trade Reform (G/AG/NG/W/15). <lb/>51. <lb/>See Revised Draft Modalities for Agriculture (TN/AG/W/4/Rev.4). Regarding Article 12 of the Agreement of <lb/>Agriculture, it proposes that the member instituting export prohibitions and restrictions shall consult, upon <lb/>request, with any other member having a substantial interest as an importer and shall report the progress made <lb/>in the consultations to the Committee on Agriculture. The Committee on Agriculture shall provide for annual <lb/>notification update and surveillance of the obligations and any member may bring to the attention of the <lb/>Committee on Agriculture any measures which it considers ought to have been notified by another member. <lb/>Existing export prohibitions and restrictions in foodstuffs and feeds under Article XI.2 (a) of GATT 1994 shall <lb/>be eliminated by the end of the first year of implementation. Any new export prohibitions or restrictions under <lb/>Article XI.2(a) of GATT 1994 should not normally be longer than 12 months, and shall only be longer than 18 <lb/>months with the agreement of the affected importing members. These clauses emphasize that export <lb/>restrictions, even when applied for food security, should be applied only temporarily. <lb/>52. <lb/>The Cairns Group, which included Argentina, Australia, Bolivia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, <lb/>Guatemala, Indonesia, Malaysia, New Zealand, Paraguay, Philippines, South Africa, Thailand and Uruguay, <lb/>submitted its proposal paper (G/AG/NG/W/93). <lb/></body>

			<body>schedule, export duties are not restrained by any substantive discipline. Lack of discipline may result in <lb/>abuse of export duties. <lb/>48. <lb/>The growing number of bilateral and regional trade agreements has introduced disciplines to <lb/>prohibit export duties. In the WTO, accession procedures have provided a multilateral framework for <lb/>making progress with respect to individual countries, as in the case of China. During the DDA negotiations, <lb/>countries have communicated their thoughts on these measures. However, it is questionable whether these <lb/>efforts to introduce multilateral or bilateral discipline have been very successful. <lb/>49. <lb/>Although the TPR reports are the most trustworthy source regarding the documentation of export <lb/>restrictions, it is not satisfactory. 53 The review process takes place every two to four years, depending on <lb/>the countries involved and therefore cannot reflect the most up-to-date information. The WTO notification <lb/>procedure is not effective especially regarding export duties, and this partially reflects lack of substantive <lb/>regulation on export duties. Transparency regarding the use and implementation of export restrictions <lb/>should be substantially improved. <lb/>53. <lb/>TPR reports do not cover countries that are not member of the WTO and hence additional sources should be <lb/>consulted to have a more complete information covering these countries. <lb/></body>

Export fees on ready-made clothes were eliminated in 2005. <lb/>Bulgaria (2003) <lb/>No export taxes. At the time of its WTO accession in 1996, Bulgaria applied a range of <lb/>export taxes for the purpose of preventing or relieving critical shortage of foodstuffs <lb/>and other essential products. However, it undertook commitments to minimize the use <lb/>of such measures upon accession, and no longer imposes any duties or other <lb/>charges on exported goods. <lb/>European Union (25) <lb/>(2009, 2007, 2004) <lb/>No export taxes. <lb/>Georgia (2009) <lb/>No export taxes. <lb/>Iceland (OECD) (2006) <lb/>No export taxes. According to Act 66/2002, a fee of ISK 500 should be paid for every <lb/>horse exported into a fund established with the purpose of protecting the species. The <lb/>authorities stressed that this fee is not collected by the Directorate of Customs. <lb/>Israel (2006) <lb/>No export taxes. <lb/>Jordan (2008) <lb/>An export tax of JD 30 per tonne is collected by the Customs authorities on exports of <lb/>scrap and waste of iron, brass, and aluminium, to secure the needs of the domestic <lb/>industry. Mining and quarrying products are subject to export fees, which are collected <lb/>by the Natural Resources Authority. In 2006, these fees generated tax revenues of JD <lb/>0.4 million. The Ministry of Agriculture collects fees on exported agricultural products. <lb/>These charges relate to services rendered, such as quarantine, fumigation, and <lb/>inspection. <lb/>Liechtenstein (2004) <lb/>No export taxes. <lb/>Norway (OECD) (2008, <lb/>2004) <lb/>Exporters of fish and fish products are subject to a levy between 0.2% and 1.05% of <lb/>the export value (f.o.b.), depending on the species and stage of processing. The levy <lb/>is used to finance the activities of the Norwegian Seafood Export Council (NSEC) <lb/>which assists in the marketing of fish and fish products. <lb/>Oman (2008) <lb/>No export taxes. <lb/>Qatar (2005) <lb/>No export taxes <lb/>Romania (2005) <lb/>No export taxes. <lb/>Switzerland (OECD) <lb/>(2008, 2004) <lb/>No export taxes. Export duties may be levied on goods listed in the &quot;export tariff&quot; <lb/>schedule, to guarantee the national supply (48 tariff lines at the HS eight-digit level). <lb/>Nonetheless, no export duties were applied during 2004-08. <lb/>Turkey (OECD) (2007, <lb/>2003) <lb/>Turkey applies export taxes at a rate of USD 0.5 per kg on raw skins (HS 41.01, <lb/>41.02. and 41.03; excluding processed raw skins); and USD 0.04 per kg for unshelled <lb/>hazelnuts, and USD 0.08 per kg for shelled hazelnuts.

			<body>Asia / Pacific <lb/>Australia <lb/>(OECD) (2007) <lb/>No export taxes. <lb/>Bangladesh <lb/>(LDC) (2006) <lb/>A tax at source on all export earnings remains at 0.25%, but no product-specific taxes, charges <lb/>or levies seem to affect exports. <lb/>Brunei <lb/>Darussalam <lb/>(2008) <lb/>No export taxes. <lb/>China <lb/>(2008, 2006) <lb/>Export taxes are levied at statutory rates in relation to f.o.b. values and on an MFN basis. In <lb/>addition, lower interim rates may be applied on an MFN basis. The Tariff Commission under <lb/>the State Council sets and publishes the statutory rates annually and revises the list of items <lb/>subject to interim duty together with the rates of duty. In 2007, statutory export taxes applied to <lb/>88 tariff lines at the HS 8-digit level, including metals, phosphorous, benzene, and eel; 64 of <lb/>these lines were also subject to lower interim export duties. In the same year, interim export <lb/>duties applied to an additional 110 lines at the HS 8-digit level, which were not subject to <lb/>statutory export taxes. They included: some mineral products; iron, copper, nickel, and <lb/>aluminium ores; certain chemical products; as well as iron and steel products. The interim duty <lb/>rates on 142 tariff lines were increased on 1 June 2007, with a view to reducing exports of <lb/>products that are highly energy consuming and polluting, as well as those consuming large <lb/>amounts of raw materials. On 1 January 2008, the coverage of interim export duties increased <lb/>again to include some more steel products; in total, 334 lines (at the HS 8-digit level and <lb/>including 4 &quot;ex-&quot; lines) are now subject to interim export duties. In addition to these products, <lb/>exports of grain, rice, maize, and soybeans are subject to interim export duties, to discourage <lb/>their export. Though the main objective of these export taxes may be to improve the <lb/>environment by reducing exports of products considered to be highly energy consuming or <lb/>polluting, such taxes tend to increase the domestic supply of the products concerned. As a <lb/>consequence, their domestic prices tend to be lower than would otherwise be the case; thus, <lb/>export taxes may implicitly assist domestic downstream processing of the products concerned. <lb/>Not fully rebating VAT on exports of certain products has a similar outcome. The VAT rebate <lb/>rates are adjusted from time to time to, inter alia, meet industrial development goals, and <lb/>control exports of certain products. For example, in September 2006, rebate rates were <lb/>lowered on, inter alia, some steel products, cements, and some textiles, as well as furniture, <lb/>plastics, and wood products. In July 2007, China eliminated rebates for some 553 items <lb/>regarded as highly energy consuming, highly polluting, and consuming large amount of raw <lb/>materials, and lowered rebate rates for 2 268 lines (HS 8-digit) that the authorities considered <lb/>prone to trade friction; such items included textiles and steel products. In December 2007, <lb/>China removed the VAT rebate on exports of 84 agricultural tariff lines, such as wheat, maize, <lb/>rice, and soybean, with a view to easing inflation. As a consequence, current VAT rebates are: <lb/>17%, 13%, 11%, 9%, and 5%. The authorities state that VAT rebates on exports amounted to <lb/>CNY 487.7 billion in 2006 (CNY 420 billion in 2004), or about 6.3% of total merchandise <lb/>exports. <lb/>Chinese Taipei <lb/>(2006) <lb/>No export taxes. <lb/>Fiji (2009) <lb/>Export taxes of 3% apply to gold, silver, sugar, molasses, and, following the 2009 Budget, <lb/>unprocessed fish and timber to promote domestic value added. The export tax base is the <lb/>f.o.b. value or, if not easily ascertainable or accepted by Customs, an estimated value in <lb/>accordance with legislation. Government policy is to ensure that the export tax and royalty rate <lb/>on any metallic mineral does not exceed 5% f.o.b. <lb/>Hong Kong, <lb/>China <lb/>(2006, 2003) <lb/>No export taxes. However, exports of clothing and footwear continue to be subject to a clothing <lb/>industry training levy of HKD 0.30 per every HKD 1 000 exported. <lb/></body>

			<body>India <lb/>(2007) <lb/>With the exception of tanned and untanned hides, skins and leathers (except manufactures of <lb/>leather), all other exports otherwise subject to tax have been exempted through notifications. <lb/>The export tax rates for leather range from 10% to 25% of the f.o.b. value of the product. An <lb/>export cess applied to various products including coffee, spices, tobacco and other agricultural <lb/>commodities has been repealed by the Cess Law (Repealing and Amending) Act, 2005 <lb/>enacted in 2006. No information was provided on which exports remain subject to cess. <lb/>Indonesia <lb/>(2007, 2003) <lb/>In 1998, Indonesia cut export tariffs on 34 commodities and revamped procedures for export <lb/>tax payments. It reduced export taxes by 20% at end 1998 and another 25% at end 2000. They <lb/>covered paper pulp, wood chips, veneer railroad sleepers, rattan, logs, sawn timber and <lb/>natural sand, and the raw materials for producing these products. Export taxes on these goods <lb/>had been as high as 200% for logs but have now fallen to just 10% The export tax on rattan fell <lb/>to 5%. The export tax on crude palm oil, one of Indonesia&apos;s largest export products, was cut to <lb/>3% (from 10%) in 2001, and in December 2005 the Minister of Agriculture announced plans to <lb/>reduce the tax further to 1.5%. The rate on crude palm oil by-products (including olein) was cut <lb/>to 1% (from 6-8%) in 2001. In 2005, the Government imposed export tariffs on raw skins <lb/>(25%), white tanned hides (15%) and coal (5%). <lb/>Japan (OECD) <lb/>(2009, 2007, <lb/>2005) <lb/>No export taxes. <lb/>Korea (OECD) <lb/>(2008, 2004) <lb/>No export taxes. <lb/>Kyrgyz Republic <lb/>(2006) <lb/>No export taxes. <lb/>Macau, China <lb/>(2007) <lb/>No export taxes. <lb/>Maldives (LDC) <lb/>(2009, 2003) <lb/>Fisheries exports are subject to a 5% royalty, based on weight. <lb/>Malaysia (2006) <lb/>Export duties are generally imposed on main commodities, such as crude petroleum and palm <lb/>oil. Out of 10 580 tariff lines, 512 lines are subject to export duties, the majority being in 15-<lb/>20% range. The purpose of Malaysia&apos;s export duties is to discourage the export of raw <lb/>materials and to encourage downstream activities in the country. For example, a 5% export <lb/>duty is levied on cockles (molluscs), live cattle, buffaloes, goats, and wild animals and birds. <lb/>The export of wildlife is discouraged for conservation purposes. Export duties are also imposed <lb/>to fund research and development and promotion activities for commodities in downstream and <lb/>upstream industries and to maintain an adequate supply of certain goods in the domestic <lb/>market. Currently export duties are 15% on logs and range from 10% to 30% for crude palm <lb/>oil, based on tonnage. The Government imposes an export levy on selected species of sawn <lb/>timber to ensure an adequate supply for timber-based industries and for research and <lb/>development. With the exception of crude petroleum, which is subject to a flat rate duty of 20%, <lb/>duties on commodities are based on the &quot; cost plus &quot; concept: the duty is only imposed on the <lb/>excess over a threshold price that reflects the cost of production. In September 2003, export <lb/>duties were reduced for 41 items and abolished for another 208 items. <lb/>Mongolia <lb/>(2005) <lb/>As of January 2004, Mongolia applies export taxes on several products, such as raw <lb/>cashmere, cut timber, scrap metals and worn rails, copper, zinc alloys/brass, aluminium <lb/>unwrought, etc. In so far as such taxes reduce the domestic price of these products, they <lb/>constitute assistance to their domestic processing. Upon accession to the WTO, Mongolia <lb/>made a commitment to eliminate export duty on raw cashmere within ten years of the date of <lb/>accession. With a view to protecting metal-smelting plants, due to the increasing shortage of <lb/>raw metals and a large increase in the world prices of metals since 1997, export taxes on scrap <lb/>metals were raised from Tog 140/kg to Tog 350/kg in May 2004. <lb/>New Zealand <lb/>(OECD) <lb/>(2009, 2003) <lb/>No export taxes. <lb/></body>

			<body>Pakistan <lb/>(2008) <lb/>Although export taxes are prohibited, the Central Board of Revenue (CBR) can impose <lb/> &quot; regulatory duties &quot; up to 100% on exports, by notification without parliamentary approval <lb/>(Customs Act). Duties of 25% were applied to exported ferrous and non-ferrous waste and <lb/>scrap in June 2006 and of 35% on pulses in 2006/07, due to domestic shortages; &quot; regulatory <lb/>duties &quot; also apply at 15% on exports of sugar, 30% on leather goods, 20% on hides and skins <lb/>and, from the 2007/08 Budget, 25% on specified metals and articles thereof. The authorities <lb/>indicate that such measures are used to control supply of commodities for local consumption <lb/>and not to raise revenue or assist domestic users of these goods; nevertheless export taxes <lb/>can implicitly subsidize users of affected goods by reducing domestic prices. The All-Pakistan <lb/>Textile Association no longer sets minimum export prices on cotton yarn. According to the <lb/>authorities the special mechanism mentioned in the 2006 Export Trade Order for monitoring <lb/>metal exports, including prices, was not established. An export development charge of 0.25% <lb/>of the f.o.b. value is levied on all exports (except from export processing zones) to finance the <lb/>Export Development Fund. <lb/>Philippines <lb/>(2005) <lb/>Only plantation (non-native) logs are subject to an export tax (20% of f.o.b.). However, <lb/>provisions still appear to exist that enable export taxes to be re-imposed on other products, <lb/>although the authorities indicate that these may no longer apply. The authorities indicate that <lb/>the export tax on non-native logs is imposed to ensure an adequate, stable and sustainable <lb/>supply of domestic timber. However, export taxes are distorting and implicitly subsidize <lb/>downstream processors by providing logs at below world prices, thereby encouraging domestic <lb/>value added, which may be an inefficient use of resources if reliant on the subsidy. The <lb/>authorities indicate that revenue from the export tax is minimal. Minimum export prices seem to <lb/>apply for rice and corn; according to the authorities, they are generally based on world prices. <lb/>Minimum export prices could have similar economic effects to export taxes. <lb/>Singapore <lb/>(2008, 2004) <lb/>No export taxes. <lb/>Solomon Islands <lb/>(LDC) (2009) <lb/>Export taxes are levied mainly on fish, minerals, and timber. Taxes on timber and fish are <lb/>levied on a value determined by the authorities. Between 2003 and 2007, export duties <lb/>represented almost 18% of total customs and inland revenue. <lb/>Sri Lanka <lb/>(2004) <lb/>Export cesses are currently imposed on, inter alia, tea, coconut products, unshelled raw <lb/>cashew, raw hides and skins. It would appear that these cesses are earmarked to finance <lb/>specific activities such as financing R&amp;D in the tea sector and supporting small-scale growers. <lb/>Exports of silica quartz are still subject to a minimum price of USD 300 per tonne. Exports of <lb/>sawn rubber wood are also subject to a minimum export price to prevent the indiscriminate <lb/>felling of rubber trees, and thereby protect the rubber industry. As in the case of imports, <lb/>several types of border charges are levied on certain exports. While these charges may be <lb/>justified by the authorities on grounds of national security, environmental protection, financing <lb/>export promotion, and encouraging downstream processing, the use of such levies on the <lb/>export of locally produced materials is in effect, an input subsidy to processors. Insofar as <lb/>export sales of such materials are diverted onto the home market, the domestic prices of these <lb/>materials are reduced by the export restriction. While processors benefit from lower domestic <lb/>prices, domestic suppliers of materials are penalized. Encouraging production and exports of <lb/>processed products through export levies on inputs, risks developing inefficient industries. <lb/>Export duties and cesses may be imposed to: ensure the availability of raw materials for <lb/>higher-value-added industries and to promote further processing of local materials; finance <lb/>export promotion activities; and protect national security, archaeological items, and the <lb/>environment. <lb/>Thailand (2007, <lb/>2003) <lb/>There has been no change in Thailand&apos;s export duties since 2003. Export taxes consist of <lb/>statutory rates and applied rates; applied rates involve specific (hides of bovine animals) and <lb/>ad valorem (wood sawn and articles thereof, from zero to 40%) duties. The contribution of <lb/>export taxes to government revenue remains negligible (0.3% of total tax revenue in 2005/06). <lb/>The persistence of relatively high statutory export taxes, nevertheless, leaves an element of <lb/>uncertainty in Thailand&apos;s trade regime, as export taxes on important products, such as rice or <lb/>rubber, could in principle be reintroduced up to the level of the statutory rates without <lb/>legislative approval. According to the authorities, the collection of export taxes is primarily for <lb/>the purpose of conserving the environment, although it also constitutes a form of assistance to <lb/>downstream processing. <lb/></body>

			<body>Africa <lb/>Angola (LDC) <lb/>(2006) <lb/>Export duties are levied on: ivory, powder and scrap (10%); raw hides and skins (20%); tanned <lb/>hides and skins (20%); and worked ivory, bone, etc., (10%). The authorities indicate that these <lb/>duties are levied for purposes of environmental protection, particularly of flora and fauna. <lb/>Benin (LDC) <lb/>(2004) <lb/>Although export duties were abolished in 1993, a fiscal tax on the export of cocoa beans, crude <lb/>petroleum and precious metals still seems to apply. <lb/>Botswana (2009, <lb/>2003) <lb/>The Cattle Export and Slaughter Levy Act 10 of 2005 provides for the imposition of a levy per <lb/>head of cattle exported from Botswana. The levy rate is currently P 10 per animal. <lb/>Burkina Faso <lb/>(LDC) (2004) <lb/>Burkina Faso imposes a levy of CFAF 500 (USD 0.83) for each export certificate for works of <lb/>art, which goes to the National Cultural Promotion Fund (FNPC). A special livestock sector <lb/>contribution is levied on the export of live animals. <lb/>Burundi (LDC) <lb/>(2003) <lb/>Most products are subject to a 5% export tax on the sales price plus packing costs. Higher <lb/>rates are applied to certain primary commodities: 15% on fresh vegetables, flour, cereals and <lb/>grains; and 6% on tea. Green coffee beans are subject to the 31% rate, but the tax has not <lb/>been collected since 1999. Raw hides and skins, leather, fur skins and articles thereof are <lb/>taxed at 3% and mineral ores at 1%. The government plans to eliminate export taxes and <lb/>charges from 1 January 2003. <lb/>Cameroon <lb/>(2007) <lb/>The CAEMC (Central African Economy and Monetary Community) customs regime allows <lb/>member countries to levy export taxes. Cameroon applies export taxes of 2% of the f.o.b. value <lb/>of exported goods, with the exception of logs, which are subject to a higher rate. Exports of <lb/>wood (raw or semi-processed logs) are subject to an export tax of 17.5% of the f.o.b. value. <lb/>Export taxes on logs have been imposed to encourage processing and hence local added <lb/>value. Exports worth CFAF 500 000 or more are subject to the inspection and control tax. <lb/>Exports of fish and meat are subject to a sanitary inspection tax at the same rate as imports. <lb/>Central African <lb/>Republic (LDC) <lb/>(2007) <lb/>Gold, diamonds, wood, cattle and live wild animals are the subject of special regime as regards <lb/>export duties and taxes. <lb/>Chad (LDC) <lb/>(2007) <lb/>A statistical tax on exports (RSE) is levied at the rate of 2% of the export value, on all tariff <lb/>lines whatever the destination of the goods. The Community preferential tax (TPC) of 0.4% is <lb/>also collected, on behalf of the CAEMC (Central African Economic and Monetary Community), <lb/>on all exports. Export duty is levied on certain, mainly agricultural and fish-breeding, products <lb/>to finance the export &quot; Rural Intervention Fund &quot; (FRE). <lb/>Congo (LDC) <lb/>(2006) <lb/>Merchandise exports are subject to several export duties and taxes, in particular: the 2% <lb/>automation fee; the 2% supplementary exit duty, from which certain products are exempt; and <lb/>the 2% levy on rough diamonds. Timber is taxed as follows: 1% levy for the public service <lb/>responsible for controlling forest product exports, the tax on timber exports assessed on the <lb/>basis of transport costs, the f.o.b. value, the species and the degree of processing. In addition, <lb/>there is a 15% surcharge on rough timber exported over and above the quota of 85% of the <lb/>production of each forestry enterprise, as well as the contribution to the road fund assessed on <lb/>timber for export or in transit. <lb/>Djibouti (LDC) <lb/>(2006) <lb/>Djibouti levies an export tax of DF 500/tonne on salt. <lb/>Egypt <lb/>(2005) <lb/>No export taxes. However, according to Article 8 of the Import and Export Regulations, a duty <lb/>up to 100% of the value of the good may be imposed at any time by the Minister responsible <lb/>for trade; according to the authorities, this duty has never been imposed. <lb/>Gambia (LDC) <lb/>(2004) <lb/>A 10% export duty is levied on all items, except diamonds, which are taxed at 3%; exports of <lb/>fish, fish products, groundnuts and their by-products, and all exports to the European Union are <lb/>exempted. <lb/></body>

			<body>Ghana <lb/>(2008) <lb/>Export taxes are applied on cocoa and hydrocarbons. The rates on hydrocarbons are <lb/>USD 0.09 per litre on aviation turbine kerosene and USD 0.03 per litre on gas oil. The share of <lb/>export taxes in total Government revenue has decreased significantly, from 11.4% in 1998 to <lb/>2.3% in 2005. <lb/>Guinea (LDC) <lb/>(2005) <lb/>A fiscal duty (DFE) is applied on the following scale: 0% for all agricultural or industrial <lb/>products harvested or manufactured in the Republic of Guinea; 3% for exports of gold and <lb/>diamonds; 2% for re-exports of goods of foreign origin previously imported against payment of <lb/>duties and taxes in Guinea. The DFE applicable to mining products is determined in the <lb/>various agreements signed with the mining companies. The tax payable by the Guinean <lb/>Bauxite Company (CBG) is USD 8 to 9 per ton of bauxite (it depends on the trend in global <lb/>prices), USD 1.75 per ton of alumina produced by the Alumina Company of Guinea (ACG) and <lb/>USD 0.5 per ton of bauxite used to produce alumina. A tax of USD 13 is payable per ton of <lb/>coffee. <lb/>Kenya (2006) <lb/>An export tax of 25% applies to hides and skins, and scrap metal. The tax was introduced in <lb/>2004 to encourage local processing. <lb/>Lesotho (LDC) <lb/>(2009, 2003) <lb/>Sales tax is levied at 15% on every diamond found in and exported from Lesotho. <lb/>Madagascar <lb/>(LDC)(2008) <lb/>According to the authorities, Madagascar does not impose any export taxes. However, some <lb/>products are subject to a charge. Given that these products are almost entirely exported, these <lb/>charges are de facto applicable almost exclusively to exports. Also, a charge is applied to <lb/>fishery products; a charge of 1.5% of the f.o.b. value is applied to worked wood; and a mining <lb/>charge of 2% is applied to mining products. Furthermore, forestry charges are levied on the <lb/>exportation of specimens of fauna and flora: at the rate of 4% of the f.o.b. price for live <lb/>specimens; 2% of the f.o.b. price for processed products; and 1% of the f.o.b. price for <lb/>specimens that have been reproduced. <lb/>Mali (LDC) <lb/>(2004) <lb/>Production of gold, which for the most part is exported, is subject to a levy of 3% ad valorem <lb/>under the CPS (export duty). Exports of cotton are also subject to a CPS of 3%. <lb/>Mauritius (2008) <lb/>No export taxes. <lb/>Morocco (2009, <lb/>2003) <lb/>The DH 0.50 tax on every quintal of maize exported was abolished in 2005. The levy of DH <lb/>7/tonne on plant fibre exported was also abolished in 2005. The levy on the exploitation of <lb/>phosphates, amounting to DH 34/tonne of crude phosphate equivalent, payable on exports <lb/>was abolished in January 2008. <lb/>Mozambique <lb/>(LDC)(2009) <lb/>Mozambique imposes an export tax of between 18% and 22% of the f.o.b. customs value on <lb/>raw cashews. Although no other specific export tax appears to be applied, certain items, which <lb/>are almost entirely exported, are subject to charges, e.g. cotton, fishery products, forestry <lb/>products, and mining products. For instance, a royalty of Mt 2,000 applies to exports of <lb/>unprocessed precious tropical wood, with a 25% reduction applying if processed. <lb/>Namibia (2009, <lb/>2003) <lb/>A 10% tax is imposed on unprocessed diamond exports. Export levies apply to live exports of <lb/>slaughter-ready cattle at N$39.50 per head, and small stock (sheep and goats) at N$7.90 per <lb/>head. <lb/>Niger (LDC) <lb/>(2009, 2003) <lb/>A 3% statistical export charge (RSE) applies to all goods except mineral substances, together <lb/>with a special re-export tax (TSR). Tobacco products are subject to a TSR of 5% when <lb/>exported to countries that are outside the franc zone but are members of the ECOWAS (for <lb/>example, Nigeria), and a TSR of 15% when exported to other countries outside the franc zone. <lb/>For all other goods, the TSR rate is 10%. Niger has a large re-export trade (for example, <lb/>cigarettes), mainly going to Nigeria, which is Niger&apos;s second most important trade partner, and <lb/>live animals are the second largest export. <lb/>Nigeria (2005) <lb/>The export amendment decree of 1992 prescribes that all raw material or unprocessed <lb/>commodities, whether mineral or agricultural, may be subject to the payment of an export levy <lb/>as may be prescribed, from time to time, by order of the Nigerian Export Promotion Council <lb/>(NEPC). In this respect, an administrative levy of US$5 per tonne is applied to exports of <lb/>cocoa, and of US$32 per tonne to exports of other raw materials. <lb/></body>

As from 1980, a 3% tax has been levied on all diamond exports valued by <lb/>the Government Gold and Diamond Office (GGDO), in conjunction with Diamond Counsellors <lb/>International. <lb/>South Africa <lb/>(2009, 2003) <lb/>South Africa levies a tax on exports of unpolished diamonds in order to promote the <lb/>development of the local economy, develop skills, and create employment. As of 2008, export <lb/>levy of 5% based on the value of exported unpolished diamonds has been applied. South <lb/>Africa also imposes an export levy of R 0.05 per litre of exported wine. <lb/>Suriname <lb/>(2004) <lb/>All exports are subject to a consent fee of 0.1%. A statistical fee of 0.5% applies to exports of <lb/>all products except bauxite, which is subject to a statistical fee of 2%. These fees are assessed <lb/>on the f.o.b. value of exports and are applied regardless of their destination. Suriname applies <lb/>additional taxes on exports of raw and roughly processed timber. Rates are expressed as ad <lb/>valorem rates of minimum f.o.b. values determined by the Government. In April 2004, the rates <lb/>were 20% for logs, and 5% and 10% for hewn-squares, sleepers (ties), and other semi-<lb/>processed timber. In 2002, wood export taxes accounted for some 0.1% of current <lb/>Government revenue. <lb/>Swaziland <lb/>(2009, 2003) <lb/>The only tax or fee collected on exports is the Sugar Levy, which is charged at a rate of 5.75% <lb/>of the proceeds from the net ex-mill export protocol sales to the EU, and applies two years in <lb/>arrears. <lb/>Tanzania (LDC) <lb/>(2006) <lb/>Tanzania applies an export tax on raw cashed nut, and a cess of 20% on raw hides and skins, <lb/>to encourage local processing of these goods. <lb/>Togo (LDC) <lb/>(2006) <lb/>Exports of agricultural, livestock and fishery products are subject to a levy by a way of advance <lb/>payment on income tax or flat-rate taxes payable in their stead. <lb/>Tunisia (2005) <lb/>Since Tunisia&apos;s last TPR in 1994, many export taxes have been abolished, in particular, those <lb/>on olive oil, fruit and vegetables, hides and skins, and cork. Tunisia now has two export taxes: <lb/>one cyclical tax on exported scrap iron (90 dinars per ton), levied when scrap iron prices rise in <lb/>order to discourage exports; and a &quot; customs services fee &quot; on crude oil exports (HS 2710), <lb/>calculated as 3% of their value. <lb/>Uganda (LDC) <lb/>(2006) <lb/>Uganda maintains a cess of 1% on exports of coffee (collected by the Uganda Coffee <lb/>Development Authority), 2% on cotton (collected by the Cotton Development Organisation), <lb/>and 20% on raw hides and skins. While the taxes on cotton and coffee are in place to finance <lb/>promotional activities, the tax on raw hides and skins was introduced to encourage local <lb/>processing of these goods. <lb/>Zambia (LDC) <lb/>(2009) <lb/>The 2008 Budget encouraged local value addition by introducing an export levy of 15% on the <lb/>export of copper concentrates and cotton seed (subsequently raised in the 2009 Budget to <lb/>20% for cotton seed), in recognition of the availability of local capacity to process these <lb/>products. An export tax exists on scrap metal, which is considered an important input for <lb/>manufacturing. <lb/></body>

			<body>Americas <lb/>Antigua and <lb/>Barbuda (2007) <lb/>Export taxes are applied on lobsters (ECD 0.10/lb) and fish (ECD 0.05/lb). <lb/>Argentina (2007) Following the peso devaluation in 2002, all Argentine exports were again made subject to <lb/>export duties. Resolution No. 11/2002 of the former Ministry of the Economy and Infrastructure <lb/>established export duties of 10% on a specific set of goods and of 5% on all other goods <lb/>except fuels, in addition to duties existing at that time. Since 2002, successive resolutions have <lb/>altered export tax rates, with increases on a significant number of products. As at mid-2006, <lb/>the applicable duties were 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 and 45% on the f.o.b. value, depending on the <lb/>goods in question. Export duties were introduced as price policy tools, to cushion the effect of <lb/>exchange-rate fluctuations on domestic prices, particularly those of household necessities, and <lb/>to counter the sharp fall in tax revenue. As a result, export duties have again become a major <lb/>source of public revenue. Between 2002 and 2005, revenue collected from these duties <lb/>averaged nearly 2.2% of GDP, the highest level recorded in the historical series that began in <lb/>1932. During that period, income from export duties represented 9.2% of exports and 9.9% of <lb/>total public revenue. Official f.o.b. prices are set for several dutiable agricultural exports, and <lb/>the declared f.o.b. value of a given sale is accepted only if it corresponds to the value <lb/>previously established by the competent authority. This procedure aims to establish the basis <lb/>on which rates are applied in settlement of export duties, refunds, drawback, contributions, <lb/>charges, services and other items that are levied on, or benefit, exportation of goods listed in <lb/>Law No. 21.453. <lb/>Barbados <lb/>(2008) <lb/>Barbados applies no taxes, charges or levies on exports, other than a levy on cotton exports of <lb/>BDSD 0.17 per pound. The proceeds of this levy go to the Barbados Cotton Growers <lb/>Association. <lb/>Belize <lb/>(2004) <lb/>Taxes on the export of logwood, mahogany, pine, cedar, coconut, and sugar are established <lb/>by the Produce Export Duties Act and the Sugar Act. However, the authorities indicate that all <lb/>export taxes have been repealed. Under the Meat and Livestock Act 1977, the Belize Livestock <lb/>Producers Association can impose a cess on both exports and domestic sales of cattle. The <lb/>cess on exports is specified in the legislation at BZD 10 per head plus 2% of sales value for <lb/>cattle for slaughter; and 2% of sales value for cattle for breeding. The legislation does not <lb/>specify the amount to be applied to domestic sales of cattle. <lb/>Bolivia <lb/>(2005) <lb/>Pursuant to the General Customs Law, no customs duty is imposed on exports unless <lb/>otherwise specified in the Law. Nevertheless, in the case of minerals, exports are subject to the <lb/>Impuesto Complementario a la Mineria – ICM (complementary mining tax), whose rate is <lb/>higher than that applicable to minerals sold on the domestic market. <lb/>Brazil <lb/>(2009, 2004) <lb/>Brazilian legislation allows for the application of an export tax of 30%, which can be decreased <lb/>or increased (to up to 150%) by the Camara de Comercio Exterior (CAMEX). The export tax <lb/>applies, in principle, to all exports, but with the exception of a few products, the tax is zero-<lb/>rated. Exports may be exempt from this tax according to their destination; coffee, sugar, <lb/>alcohol, and related products are exempt. Export taxes are levied on three product categories <lb/>down from seven product categories at the time of the previous review in 2004. In one case <lb/>(leather and skins) levies are charged on all exports, while, in the other two cases (cigars and <lb/>arms and ammunition), taxes are levied only on exports to certain markets, all of them in the <lb/>western hemisphere. Minimum exports prices are not used, except as a base to calculate <lb/>export taxes. <lb/>Canada (OECD) <lb/>(2007, 2003) <lb/>Export duties are imposed on Canadian-manufactured tobacco products and as of 12 October <lb/>2006, on softwood lumber destined for the United States. Exports of Canadian-produced <lb/>cigarettes, tobacco sticks, and other manufactured tobacco to all destinations are subject to a <lb/>two-tiered tax, with different rates for exports up to a threshold of 1.5% of a manufacturer&apos;s <lb/>annual production (CAD 0.075 per cigarette) and for exports above the threshold (CAD 0.178 <lb/>per cigarette). The tax on exports up to the 1.5% threshold is refundable to the foreign importer <lb/>and Canadian manufacturer upon proof of payment of taxes. The tax on exports over the 1.5% <lb/>threshold is not refundable and approximates the total federal and provincial taxes otherwise <lb/>applicable in the lowest-tax jurisdiction in Canada. The purpose of the export tax scheme is to <lb/>reduce the incentive to smuggle Canadian-produced products back into Canada from export <lb/>markets. On 12 September 2006, Canada and United States signed an agreement with respect <lb/>to exports of Canadian softwood lumber. This followed a long-running trade dispute regarding <lb/></body>

Canadian softwood lumber exporters will pay an export <lb/>charge when the agreed reference price of lumber is at or below USD 355 per thousand board <lb/>feet. Under the NAFTA and Canada&apos;s FTAs with Chile, Costa Rica and Israel, Canada has <lb/>undertaken not to maintain any duty, tax or other charge on goods exported to the territory of <lb/>the party(s) unless such levies are adopted or maintained on such goods for domestic <lb/>consumption. <lb/>Chile (2009, <lb/>2003) <lb/>No export taxes. <lb/>Colombia (2006) There are contributions of a parafiscal nature applied to exports of certain products, such as <lb/>coffee, emeralds, precious stones and some fuels. The coffee contribution tax is levied on <lb/>exported coffee and is equivalent to 5% of the price of the mild coffee exported. The emerald <lb/>contribution amounts to 1%, in foreign currency, of the export price of the unset emeralds. <lb/>Costa Rica <lb/>(2007) <lb/>Banana exports are subject to a tax irrespective of their destination. A tax of USD 1 per box or <lb/>container of 40 lb net of bananas exported is imposed. Banana producers receive USD 0.011 <lb/>per box exported from this tax. Since 1 January 2006, the Government imposed a minimum <lb/>price for banana exports f.o.b. from Costa Rican ports amounting to USD 5.70 per 18.14 kg net <lb/>box of top quality bananas. As far as coffee is concerned, in order to finance the operation, <lb/>maintenance and administration of the ICAFE, Law No. 2762 determined a tax corresponding <lb/>to 1.5% of the f.o.b. value of the coffee exported per 47kg unit of green coffee or its equivalent. <lb/>Dominica (2007) There are export royalties of ECD 0.50/ton on sand and ECD 0.45/ton on stone. <lb/>Dominican <lb/>Republic (2008) <lb/>In order to protect marine resources, Decree No. 11-01 of November 2001 introduced levies <lb/>on the export of fish, molluscs and live crustaceans. The tax on fish is 0.03 Dominican pesos <lb/>per kilogram (around USD 0.0009 per kilogram), while for molluscs and live crustaceans it is <lb/>5% ad valorem. Pursuant to the Mining Law of June 1971, exports of mineral substances in <lb/>their natural form or in the form of metalliferous mineral concentrates is subject to a royalty or <lb/>minimum tax of 5% of the f.o.b. selling price; this royalty can be credited against payment of <lb/>income tax (ISR) for the same fiscal year. <lb/>Ecuador <lb/>(2005) <lb/>Ecuador abolished export taxes through the Law on Facilitation of Exports and Waterborne <lb/>Transport. However, the exports are subject to the &quot;redeemable quota, &quot; and minimum prices <lb/>apply to exports of certain products. The redeemable quota applied to exports amounts to 0.15 <lb/>% of their f.o.b. value, except for petroleum and petroleum products, which are subject to a <lb/>redeemable quota of 0.05 %. Exports of ungrounded coffee, roasted ungrounded coffee and <lb/>roasted ground coffee are subject to a contribution amounting to 2 % of their f.o.b. value. The <lb/>proceeds of the contributions go to the National Coffee Board. Exports of banana and <lb/>plantains, cocoa, coffee, shrimp and fish products are subject to minimum reference prices. <lb/>The value declared on the single export form may not be less than the minimum reference <lb/>price set for each product. <lb/>El Salvador <lb/>(2003) <lb/>No export taxes. <lb/>Guyana <lb/>(2009, 2003) <lb/>Export taxes are applied to almost all exported products, apart from manufactured goods and <lb/>exempted items. Unless otherwise specified, a general rate of 1.5% is applied. Since 2003 the <lb/>only change to the items subject to export duties is the removal of shrimp. A wide range of <lb/>articles are exempt from export duties: raw gold; agricultural products and their by-products <lb/>(excluding cane sugar and molasses); forest products including timber and lumber; alumina; <lb/>manganese; goods exported to CARICOM (Caribbean Community) states. <lb/>Grenada <lb/>(2007) <lb/>No export taxes. <lb/>Guatemala <lb/>(2009) <lb/>The only export taxes concern the coffee sector. Coffee growers must pay 1% of the f.o.b. <lb/>export value of coffee, of which Q 0.10/100 kg go to the municipal authorities and the rest to <lb/>Anacafe. <lb/>Haiti (LDC) <lb/>(2004) <lb/>No export taxes. According to Article 167 of the Customs Code, goods for export are subject to <lb/>payment of duties that appear in the tariff as exit duties. However, the liberalization process <lb/>initiated in 1986 has led to the gradual and complete abolition of customs duties on exports. <lb/></body>

			<body>Honduras <lb/>(2003) <lb/>No export taxes. <lb/>Jamaica <lb/>(2005) <lb/>No export taxes. <lb/>Mexico (OECD) <lb/>(2008) <lb/>Export taxes applied to 19 tariff lines at the HS 8-digit level, including shells and claws of <lb/>turtles, bone substances, human blood, skins of wildcats, etc. (Also Exports are subject to the <lb/>DTA (Derecho de Tramite Aduanero) unless they are going to a country that is party to a free-<lb/>trade agreement signed with Mexico. The general rate is MXN 202 (around USD 18) per <lb/>transaction.) <lb/>Nicaragua <lb/>(2006) <lb/>No export taxes. <lb/>Panama <lb/>(2007) <lb/>There are no taxes on exports, except for exports of finished products made of native woods, <lb/>which are subject to a 1% tax under Forest Law. <lb/>Paraguay <lb/>(2005) <lb/>No export taxes were levied between 1997 and 2001. An export tax of 12% on fresh or salted <lb/>bovine hides was introduced in 2002. Initially, the tax was applied on f.o.b. value of exports, but <lb/>Decree No. 20.135/03 established a minimum unit value for customs purpose of USD 35 for <lb/>exported hides, and the tax is applied on this value, irrespective of the place of destination. An <lb/>export tax of 4% on soybeans, concerning the 2003/2004 harvest, and irrespective of the place <lb/>of destination, was introduced in 2004. The dutiable value is set at US$80 per ton exported. <lb/>The declared purpose of the taxes on hides and soybeans is to promote the local processing of <lb/>those products. In both cases, the main reason cited for their application is the lack of raw <lb/>materials for the domestic processing industry and the increase in exports of unprocessed <lb/>products, taking into account, according to the Paraguayan authorities, the distortion created in <lb/>subregional trade by the taxes on hide exports applied by Argentina and Uruguay. <lb/>Peru (2007) <lb/>No export taxes. The notional 0% tax levied on exports for statistical purpose was repealed in <lb/>2004. <lb/>St. Kitts and <lb/>Nevis (2007) <lb/>Export taxes are applied on live animals, lobster and cotton. Revenue from this tax represents <lb/>less than 2% of tax revenue. <lb/>St. Lucia (2007) <lb/>No export taxes. <lb/>St. Vincent and <lb/>the Grenadines <lb/>(2007) <lb/>No export taxes. <lb/>Trinidad and <lb/>Tobago (2005) <lb/>No export taxes. <lb/>United States <lb/>(OECD) <lb/>(2008, 2006, <lb/>2004) <lb/>No export taxes. <lb/>Uruguay (2006) <lb/>Exports of bovine, sheep, pig, horse and poultry meats, irrespective of their form but with the <lb/>exception of preserved meat, are subject to the FIS tax at a rate of 1% of the f.o.b. value of the <lb/>exports. The FIS also applies to some sales on the domestic market. Exports of raw, salted, <lb/>pickled and wet-blue hides pay a 5% tax. Exports of some other agricultural products are <lb/>subject to payment of taxes or levies intended to finance bodies such as the Uruguayan Wool <lb/>Secretariat (SUL), and the National Agricultural Research Institute (INIA). <lb/></body>

			<body>Annex 2. <lb/>DESCRIPTION OF OTHER EXPORT RESTRICTIONS IN TPR REPORTS <lb/>Europe/Middle East <lb/>Bahrain (2007) <lb/>Bahrain prohibits exports of some products including certain foodstuffs and fuels. Export <lb/>restrictions apply to, inter alia, live horses, camels, and antiques. <lb/>Bulgaria (2003) <lb/>Since January 2000, Bulgaria has liberalized its export licensing procedures. Currently, <lb/>export licences are required in a limited number of cases such as fulfilment of <lb/>international treaties and conventions to which Bulgaria is a signatory; protecting public <lb/>morals; maintaining public order and national security; and safeguarding national artistic, <lb/>historical, and architectural masterpieces. Licences are issued by the competent <lb/>government ministries depending on the product and are valid for up to three months from <lb/>the date of issue. Automatic licensing (registration) is applied to precious metals and <lb/>unsawn timber exports (except for fire-burnt timber). Before its accession to the WTO, <lb/>Bulgaria imposed quantitative restrictions on certain exports in order to ensure adequate <lb/>supplies in the domestic market and prevent or relieve critical shortages. For instance, <lb/>autonomous quotas were applied to the exports of goats, wheat, and barley. Upon <lb/>accession in 1996, Bulgaria abandoned all quantitative restrictions on exports of <lb/>agricultural products. <lb/>European Union (25) <lb/>(2009, 2007, 2004) <lb/>Export restrictions are allowed on grounds of public morality, the protection of health and <lb/>life of humans, animals and plants, and national cultural treasures. The restrictions are <lb/>under the competence of both the Commission and Member States. An export <lb/>authorization or license is required for the export of cultural goods and certain products <lb/>under the Common Agriculture Policy (CAP), and for the control of exports of dual-use <lb/>items and technology according to provisions set out in Regulation 1334/2000 (last <lb/>amended by Regulation 1183/2007). The export of software or technology by electronic <lb/>media, fax or telephone is also subject to authorization under the dual-use regime. Export <lb/>licences are required to export goods covered by the CAP from the EU. <lb/>Georgia (2009) <lb/>Georgia does not apply export quotas. Export licensing restrictions are applied only for <lb/>reasons of healthcare, environmental protection, national heritage and security. <lb/>Iceland (OECD) (2006) Export restrictions, prohibitions, and licensing apply in a number of cases including <lb/>narcotics, and ozone-depleting substances. <lb/>Israel (2006) <lb/>Currently some 35 items, by broad category, require a licence for various reasons, such <lb/>as the control of quality and standards of goods, compliance with international <lb/>agreements (including those regarding dangerous drugs and protection of plants and <lb/>animals), and conservation of local resources. Most of the goods covered by the control <lb/>requirement are agricultural products or chemicals. <lb/>Jordan (2008) <lb/>Export prohibitions, restrictions, and licensing are regulated through Import and Export <lb/>Law No. 21 of 2001, as amended by Temporary Law No. 18 of 2003. Automatic licensing <lb/>applies to, inter alia, wheat and other wheat-based products (including macaroni and <lb/>vermicelli) to ensure that the consumer subsidies granted on these products are <lb/>reimbursed by exporters when the products are exported. Jordan is introducing non-<lb/>automatic licensing to dual-use products (the goods covered by the dual-use export <lb/>control system of the European Communities). <lb/>Liechtenstein (2008, <lb/>2004) <lb/>Lichtenstein continues to maintain export controls on certain products on grounds of <lb/>safety, security, and environment, and to ensure compliance with international obligations <lb/>under treaties and conventions to which they are signatories. <lb/></body>

			<body>Norway (OECD) <lb/>(2008, 2004) <lb/>Norway applies trade embargos on the basis of US Security Council Resolutions relating <lb/>to Iran, North Korea, Sierra Leone, Sudan, etc. Since 2004, Norway has amended the <lb/>Customs Act to prohibit the export or re-export of counterfeit goods. Seven categories <lb/>including hazardous waste, minke whale products, cultural objects are subject to export <lb/>prohibitions or licensing. <lb/>Oman (2008) <lb/>Oman prohibits exports of antiques, and ancient manuscripts. Export restrictions apply to <lb/>date seedlings and to three species of fish (lobster, abalone, and shark) during the <lb/>breeding and reproduction seasons when fishing is not allowed. <lb/>Qatar (2005) <lb/>Export prohibitions apply to alcoholic products. They also apply to, inter alia, species of <lb/>fish and seafood products for food security reasons. <lb/>Romania (2005) <lb/>Exports are prohibited or controlled for various reasons, including environment, health, <lb/>public morality, national security, or to give effect to Romania&apos;s obligations under <lb/>international conventions. <lb/>Switzerland (OECD) <lb/>(2008, 2004) <lb/>Switzerland continues to maintain export controls on certain products on grounds of <lb/>safety, security, and environment, and to ensure compliance with international obligations <lb/>under treaties and conventions to which they are signatories. <lb/>Turkey (OECD) <lb/>(2007, 2003) <lb/>Turkey prohibits exports of 14 items (by broad category) for environment, health, cultural <lb/>reasons, or to give effect to obligations under international conventions. Each firm <lb/>producing oil products is subject to an export quota of 35% of production. An export <lb/>license is required for 25 categories of products including endangered species of wild <lb/>fauna and flora. The government has a power to make goods for export subject to quality <lb/>control, and the Undersecretariat for Foreign Trade (UTF) is responsible for enforcing <lb/>quality control of these commodities. Some 200 agricultural products (at the 12-digit HS <lb/>level) are subject to compulsory export controls for quality purposes. The coverage <lb/>includes citrus fruit, a variety of edible oils, and some hazelnuts. <lb/>United Arab Emirates <lb/>(2006) <lb/>The UAE maintains export controls (through permits) on certain products for safety, <lb/>security, and environmental reasons, and to ensure compliance with international <lb/>obligations under treaties and conventions (e.g. the Basel Convention, CITES, the <lb/>Convention on Chemical Weapons, the Treaty on Nuclear Non-Proliferation) to which it is <lb/>a signatory. <lb/>Asia/Pacific <lb/>Australia (OECD) <lb/>(2007) <lb/>Exports of some goods are restricted, unless permission or a licence is granted. These <lb/>include asbestos; biological agents; cetacearns (whales, dolphins, and porpoises); <lb/>chemical compounds; some cultural and heritage goods; defence and strategic goods; <lb/>diamonds (Kimberley process); drugs; endangered animal and plant species (subject to <lb/>the CITES); firearms, parts, accessories, and ammunition; hazardous waste; human <lb/>blood and other body fluids, organs and tissue; human embryos; ozone depleting <lb/>substances. Discretionary export licensing restrictions are maintained for reasons related <lb/>to SPS, the environment, and alignment with international agreements. <lb/>Bangladesh (LDC) <lb/>(2006) <lb/>Goods subject to export prohibition are listed in the Export Policy 2003-2006; the number <lb/>of goods on the list has been reduced from 19 to 16 since the previous review. According <lb/>to the authorities, the bans on exports of agricultural commodities and manufactured <lb/>goods are in place mainly for reasons of health, eco-balance, security, archaeological <lb/>value, or maintenance of adequate domestic supply. There is no export licensing <lb/>requirement per se, although an export certificate may be required from the relevant <lb/>authorities for certain products. <lb/>Brunei Darussalam <lb/>(2008) <lb/>Export prohibitions remain in place for prawn refuse and copra cake, and exports of <lb/>timber, oil palm, rice, and sugar are still restricted. Export licenses are required for <lb/>cigarettes, diesel, gasoline, kerosene, and salt. <lb/></body>

			<div type="annex">China <lb/>(2008, 2006) <lb/>In 2007, China maintained general export prohibitions on 40 items at the HS 8-digit level <lb/>(up from 25 items in 2004). Prohibited items include mainly materials relating to State <lb/>precious and rare animals and plants. The added lines are mineral products (HS Chapter <lb/>25) and some chemicals (HS Chapter 29). China maintains both global export quotas and <lb/>destination-specific quotas regarding Hong Kong and Macao. When determining the size <lb/>of quotas, the authorities consider, inter alia: national security, availability of domestic <lb/>resources for downstream processing, development plans for certain domestic industries, <lb/>and international and domestic demand. In 2007, 447 tariff lines at HS 8-digit level were <lb/>subject to export quotas and licensing administration (316 in 2005, and 319 in 2004). <lb/>Global export quotas applied to 146 lines at the HS 8-digit level in 2007 (down from <lb/>179 lines in 2004). From 1 January 2008, global export quotas are also applied to flours <lb/>of some grain products. China&apos;s non-automatic export licensing requirements are <lb/>implemented mainly to fulfil its obligations under international agreements, such as: <lb/>Articles XX and XXI of GATT 1994; the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the <lb/>Ozone Layer. Export licenses have also been used to reduce exports of certain products: <lb/>some steel products (83 tariff lines at the HS 8-digit level) have been subject to licensing <lb/>requirements since 20 May 2007. Automatic export licenses, which apply largely for <lb/>statistical purposes, were required for 284 lines (at the US 8-digit level) in 2007 (40 in <lb/>2004). <lb/>Chinese Taipei <lb/>(2006) <lb/>Export prohibitions cover some 48 tariff lines (HS 10-digit level), mainly products that are <lb/>banned under international conventions, such as toxic chemicals, arms and ammunition, <lb/>and narcotics. In addition, exports of trout and salmon products, plants used for <lb/>pharmaceutical purposes and antiques are prohibited. Exports of certain fish, including <lb/>trout and salmon, are prohibited for reasons of fishery conservation. Another 41 items are <lb/>currently subject to export licensing (7 February 2006). <lb/>Fiji (2009) <lb/>Prohibited exports are dangerous drugs (i.3. narcotics) as well as all live fish, and turtle <lb/>flesh and shells not meeting certain size limits. Exports of round logs are banned for <lb/>environmental reasons and to promote downstream processing, which provides an <lb/>implicit subsidy to processors at the expense of forest owners, by lowering the domestic <lb/>price. Exports of a wide range of agricultural products require an export licence from the <lb/>relevant authority, e.g. live cattle, manufactured sugar in consignments exceeding 5 kgs, <lb/>wheat brain, copra, oil cake and copra meal, various wood and wood products, and <lb/>coffee. <lb/>Hong Kong, China <lb/>(2006, 2003) <lb/>Exports of ozone-depleting substances to non-parties to the Montreal Protocol are <lb/>banned. Hong Kong also complies with trade sanctions imposed by the UN Security <lb/>Council. <lb/>India (2007) <lb/>Export prohibitions are in place for environmental, food security, marketing, pricing, and <lb/>domestic supply reasons, and to comply with international treaties. In addition to these <lb/>export prohibitions, India also issues ad hoc prohibitions on exports of sensitive products; <lb/>for example, export prohibitions have recently been issued for wheat, pulses, and sugar. <lb/>Also 171 lines at the HS 8-digit level (excluding special chemicals, organisms, materials, <lb/>equipment, and technologies) are currently subject to restrictions; products may only be <lb/>exported if a licence is issued by the Directorate General of Foreign Trade (DGFT), on the <lb/>approval of its Export Facilitation Committee. <lb/>Indonesia (2007, 2003) During 2003-06, export licensing, prohibitions, and restrictions were maintained to ensure <lb/>protection of natural resources and endangered species (e.g. in accordance with CITES); <lb/>promote higher-value-added downstream industries; upgrade the quality of export <lb/>products; and provide an adequate supply of essential products. Before 2005, Indonesia <lb/>exercised export control by dividing exports into two types, &quot; supervised &quot; exports and <lb/>&quot;regulated&quot; exports. Export approval requirements had to be met for &quot; supervised &quot; <lb/>products, including certain live bovine animals, live fish, palm nuts/kernels, lead and <lb/>bauxite ores/concentrate, petroleum oils/products, urea fertilizer, crocodile leather, <lb/>unprotected wild animals and plants, unprocessed silver/gold, and waste/scrap of metals. <lb/>Indonesia also conducted licensing and quota administration over regulated exports, <lb/>including: coffee, textiles and clothing, rubber, veneer and plywood or similar laminated <lb/>wood, teakwood, and mixed rattan and semi-prepared rattan. New export-import <lb/>regulations issued in 2005 lifted restrictions on the export of tapioca, semi-processed <lb/>rattan and silver. <lb/></div>

			<body>Japan (OECD) (2009, <lb/>2007, 2005) <lb/>Export controls (prior approval) are maintained to ensure national security and public <lb/>safety and to ensure adequate domestic supplies of certain agricultural and other primary <lb/>products. For certain agricultural products, including wheat bran, rice bran, oat bran, <lb/>clams, mussels and eels, the Minister of Economy, Trade and Industry needs the consent <lb/>of the Minister of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries prior to granting export approval. <lb/>Korea (OECD) (2008, <lb/>2004) <lb/>Export prohibitions, affecting 11 six-digit HS items, are maintained to protect animal <lb/>rights, endangered species, and preserve natural resources. Exports of sand and gravel-<lb/>related items have to be approved by the Korean Aggregate Association to protect natural <lb/>resources. <lb/>Kyrgyz Republic (2006) Export licences, administered by the Ministry of Industry, Trade and Tourism, apply to a <lb/>range of products for reasons of human safety and public health, environmental <lb/>protection (including under international conventions), national security, and preservation <lb/>of art, historical and archaeological treasures, and exhaustible natural resources. Goods <lb/>include weapons; explosives; nuclear materials and technology for military use; virulent <lb/>poisons; narcotics (including used in pharmaceuticals) and psychotropic substances; art <lb/>works and antiquities with historical, cultural or scientific value; ferrous, precious, and <lb/>rare-earth metals and their fragments; and rare raw materials of vegetable or animal origin <lb/>having pharmacological applications. According to the authorities, except for non-ferrous <lb/>metal fragments and waste, licensing is not intended to restrict exports but to control <lb/>exports of stolen materials. <lb/>Macao, China (2007) <lb/>No products are subject to export restrictions and controls except CITES species, ozone <lb/>depleting substances, toxic chemicals and precursory substances, etc. <lb/>Maldives (LDC) (2009, <lb/>2003) <lb/>Exports of live fish are subject to licensing, and trade in timber is controlled. Exports of <lb/>certain marine species are prohibited for environmental reasons. <lb/>Malaysia (2006) <lb/>The Customs (Prohibition of Exports) Order 1998, under the Customs Act 1967, sets out <lb/>export control requirements in three schedules. The first schedule consists of items that <lb/>are absolutely prohibited from being exported, for example arms and related materials of <lb/>all types, including weapons and ammunition, military vehicles and equipment, police <lb/>equipment, and spare parts. Exports of turtle eggs are prohibited as are exports of rattan <lb/>from peninsular Malaysia. The second schedule comprises goods subject to export <lb/>licensing. Licences are required for all exports to Israel, and for 43 product groups. The <lb/>third schedule consists of items that can be exported only after meeting certain criteria for <lb/>the protection of wildlife, health, security, and antiquities. In 2001, 36% of Malaysia&apos;s tariff <lb/>lines were subject to export licensing requirements; this level does not appear to have <lb/>changed, although current data were not provided. The list of products subject to export <lb/>licensing requirement also appears to be identical to that of 2001. <lb/>Mongolia (2005) <lb/>Exports of drugs and narcotics (and raw materials and equipment that can produce them) <lb/>and certain dangerous and poisonous chemicals are prohibited; exports of raw hides, <lb/>skins, and cashmere are prohibited with a view to protecting domestic processors. There <lb/>are no licensing requirements for exporters in Mongolia, except on some items including <lb/>guns, explosives and certain drugs. <lb/>New Zealand (OECD) <lb/>(2009, 2003) <lb/>Export restrictions are maintained mainly for health and safety reasons, but also in the <lb/>case of some agricultural products, including meat and dairy products, in order to manage <lb/>trade partners&apos; import requirements, and in the case of some horticulture products and <lb/>kiwifruit, for marketing reasons. <lb/>Pakistan (2008) <lb/>Export prohibitions focus on health, social, religious, or environmental protection under <lb/>international treaties e.g. CITES. They also cover exports of wood and timber generally. <lb/>Wheat flour exports were also banned in 2007 due to domestic supply shortages. <lb/>Precious and semi-precious stones and gold jewellery are subject to special procedures. <lb/>Philippines (2005) <lb/>Exports are prohibited or regulated on grounds of national interest, security, and public <lb/>health, and to fulfil the requirements of international agreements and conventions (e.g. <lb/>the CITES). The authorities indicate that exports of logs from native forests are also <lb/>banned for environmental reasons. Regulated exports require prior export clearance from <lb/>the relevant government agencies. Exports of rice and corn remain restricted. In order to <lb/>ensure food security and price stability, these commodities may be exported only if there <lb/>is a surplus, according to the authorities. Fish exports are also regulated on grounds of <lb/>domestic food security. <lb/></body>

			<body>Singapore (2008, <lb/>2004) <lb/>Security, health, and environmental concerns underlie Singapore&apos;s export restrictions and <lb/>mainly involve endangered species under the CITES Convention, arms, explosives and <lb/>explosive precursors, chemicals, and radioactive materials. Licensing controls are also <lb/>maintained on rice, excluding rice bran, under which all rice traders must be licensed. <lb/>Solomon Islands (LDC) <lb/>(2009) <lb/>Timber exports require &quot; specific authority &quot; from the Central Bank. The purpose of this <lb/>measure is &quot; to ensure that log exporters obtain open market prices for their log exports <lb/>and remit the full proceeds to Solomon Islands &quot; . A licence is required to export other <lb/>products subject to export taxes, war relics, live fish, and wildlife specimens. <lb/>Sri Lanka (2004) <lb/>Export prohibitions and licensing remain in place to protect the national heritage, public <lb/>health, and the environment (including endangered species). Exports of tea are subject to <lb/>quality check prior to exportation. Exporters of gems must obtain a Gem Dealers Licence <lb/>(renewable on a yearly basis) from the National Gem and Jewellery Authority. <lb/>Thailand (2007, 2003) <lb/>Changes in Thailand&apos;s export licensing and prohibitions since 2003 include the elimination <lb/>of prohibitive export licensing requirements on jute and kenaf seed, live bovine animals, <lb/>277 kinds of wild animal, fuel oil and products thereof, and fertilizer. Since May 2003, <lb/>Thailand has issued export certificates for rough diamond under the Kimberly Process <lb/>Scheme before export. The Export-Import Control Law regulates the export of items that <lb/>are in short supply domestically or that might unduly affect prices. The quota system is <lb/>ostensibly applied to help improve the livelihood of farmers and food security in the <lb/>country. For example, a portion of sugar production is reserved for domestic <lb/>consumption; the remainder may be exported to the world market. <lb/>Africa <lb/>Angola (LDC) (2006) <lb/>Exports of some products including poisonous or toxic substances or drugs, animals, and <lb/>gold and silver are restricted. <lb/>Benin (LDC) (2004) <lb/>With a view to preserving natural resources and in the wake of a shortage on the <lb/>domestic market, since 1997 exports of teak in the rough and charcoal have been <lb/>prohibited. On the other hand, exports of sawn teak in the form of boards, parquet flooring <lb/>and planks are authorized. Exports of seed cotton are prohibited. The export of precious <lb/>metals requires approval from the Ministry of Finance, except in the case of items <lb/>containing a small quantity of metal, items weighing less than 500 grams or up to 10 gold <lb/>coins. <lb/>Botswana (2009, 2003) Export licences are required for all exports, including to Southern Africa Customs Union <lb/>(SACU) members, for food security, sanitary and phytosanitary, and statistical reasons, <lb/>and under international conventions to which Botswana is a signatory. <lb/>Burkina Faso (LDC) <lb/>(2004) <lb/>Works of art are the only export subject to an authorization and a permit from the Ministry <lb/>of Culture. <lb/>Burundi (LDC) (2003) <lb/>Coffee berry exports are banned. Exports of sugar are subject to a quota which varies <lb/>depending on local demand. The sugar quota is managed through the SOSUMO <lb/>company (Société sucrière du Moso), which has a production monopoly. The State <lb/>determines the quantity of sugar to be sold to distributors in each region according to their <lb/>estimates of demand and the market price for sugar. As a party to the Convention on <lb/>International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), Burundi <lb/>prohibits ivory exports. <lb/></body>

			<body>Cameroon (2007) <lb/>In principle, quantitative restrictions (including prohibitions) and controls in force on <lb/>exports derive for the most part from treaties to which Cameroon is a party (Basel <lb/>Convention on the Control of Transborder Movements of Hazardous Waste, CITES, or <lb/>Chemical Weapons Convention inter alia). Restrictions are, however, maintained on <lb/>exports of logs for economic reasons. Following the adoption of Ordinance No. 99/001 in <lb/>1999, Cameroon has set about gradually prohibiting exports of logs in order to promote <lb/>the processing industry. From 1999 until the prohibiting of log exports in 2004, a <lb/>certificate of registration had to be obtained to export timber, which was intended to <lb/>ensure that 70 % of production was processed locally and only 30 % of the annual <lb/>harvest exported as logs. However, the Ordinance also provides for log exports to <lb/>continue, subject to surtax, with the aim of promoting certain species. The export of two <lb/>species (Sapelli and Ayous) is subject to quantitative restrictions with exporters being <lb/>given quotas proportionate to the efforts invested in processing or exporting the species <lb/>being promoted which may be exported as logs. However, according to the authorities, <lb/>the loss brought about by prohibiting exports of most logs has not been offset by an <lb/>increase of processed timber. <lb/>Central African <lb/>Republic (LDC) (2007) <lb/>The Central African Republic has eliminated all quantitative export restrictions. It has <lb/>participated in the Kimberley Process for trade in rough diamonds since April 2003. <lb/>Chad (LDC) (2007) <lb/>In general, the only quantitative restrictions and controls in force on exports should be <lb/>those derived from the treaties to which Chad is party (Basle Convention, CITES, <lb/>Chemical Weapons Convention, Treaty for the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons). In <lb/>practice, there are few restrictions or controls. <lb/>Congo (LDC) (2006) <lb/>An export declaration must be filed for all goods being exported or re-exported. Under the <lb/>Forestry Code, only processed wood in the finished or semi-finished state may be <lb/>exported, but in practice each forestry enterprise is required to limit rough timber exports <lb/>to 15 % of its total production volume. This threshold is often exceeded, triggering <lb/>payment of the 15 % surcharge. Under the Mining Code, every shipment of precious <lb/>minerals requires an export authorization issued by the central mining authority. <lb/>Djibouti (LDC) (2006) <lb/>The export of sawn timber and coral is prohibited. According to the authorities, apart from <lb/>the restrictions imposed under the international agreements signed by Djibouti, there are <lb/>no other export restrictions. Djibouti does not currently require export licences. <lb/>Egypt (2005) <lb/>Pursuant to Article 7 of Law 118/1975, the export of certain commodities can be <lb/>prohibited or restricted through Ministerial decree. The authorities indicate, however, that <lb/>Egypt does not maintain any export quotas, licences, or prohibitions. <lb/>Gambia (LDC) (2004) <lb/>Export prohibition, controls, and limitations are decided by the President. The current list <lb/>is identical to the list of prohibited or restricted imports; that list includes counterfeit or <lb/>non-standard coins or currency notes, firearms that are not properly licensed, narcotic <lb/>drugs, rough or uncut diamonds, certain types of noxious gases. <lb/>Ghana (2008) <lb/>Exports of unprocessed logs, raw rattan cane and bamboo are prohibited. Export permits <lb/>or certificates are required for a number of products, including mineral ore, and <lb/>chemicals. <lb/>Guinea (LDC) (2005) <lb/>The exports of raw diamonds are subject to the Kimberley process certification scheme. <lb/>One important focus of Guinea&apos;s action is improving the quality of local products and <lb/>products for export (in particular, agricultural, livestock and fisheries products) through the <lb/>adoption of international quality and health safety standards. <lb/>Kenya (2006) <lb/>Export prohibitions apply to round-wood and, if sent by post, to firearms and ammunition <lb/>of all types, and to other articles having the appearances of lethal weapons. A licence is <lb/>required for exports of most agricultural products, food, minerals, and mineral products. <lb/>Exports of certain agricultural and food products are subject to special licences for self-<lb/>sufficiency purposes. <lb/>Lesotho (LDC) (2009, <lb/>2003) <lb/>Some livestock and livestock products are subject to export controls. Only licensed <lb/>diamond dealers or producers, or their accredited agents, may export diamonds. <lb/>Madagascar (LDC) <lb/>(2008) <lb/>Madagascar has prohibited exports of certain species of wood in rough or semi-finished <lb/>form since July 2007, but authorizes exports in finished form. <lb/></body>

			<body>Mali (LDC) (2004) <lb/>Export prohibitions are either absolute or restrictive. The absolute prohibition regime <lb/>applies to exports of young bovine breeding animals, whereas the restrictive regime <lb/>affects the following: (i) exports of meat and live animals (which require a health or animal <lb/>health certificate issued by the Ministry of Livestock); (ii) hunting trophies (submission of a <lb/>permit or certificate in conformity with the CITES issued by the competent technical <lb/>services); (iii) plants (submission of a phytosanitary certificate issued by the competent <lb/>technical services); and (iv) works of art (authorization from the Ministry responsible for <lb/>art and culture). <lb/>Mauritius (2008) <lb/>Export bans are maintained under international convention to which Mauritius is a <lb/>signatory. Export permits are required for products considered &quot; strategic &quot; or &quot; sensitive &quot; to <lb/>the economy, and such products include sugar, sand, and limestone. <lb/>Morocco (2009, 2003) <lb/>Since 2003, a number of changes have been made to the list of products subject to <lb/>quantitative restrictions (and thus to export licensing). Consequently, in addition to cereal <lb/>flour (except rice flour), charcoal, collections and specimens for various collections <lb/>(zoological, botanical, mineralogical, and archaeological); and antiques over 100 years <lb/>old, since May 2003 the list has included substances and equipment using ozone-<lb/>depleting substances, and since August 2008, wheat and meslin, rye, barley, oats, maize, <lb/>rice, grain sorghum, other cereals, groats and semolina of common flour and barley. <lb/>Tanned hides and skins or crust leather of bovine animals, sheep and goats were <lb/>removed from the list in December 2006. <lb/>Mozambique <lb/>(LDC)(2009) <lb/>Special export regulations apply to certain products including plant and vegetable matter; <lb/>animals and products thereof; products subject to export taxes, such as cashews; <lb/>precious metals, gemstones, and mineral products; gold and silver, which may only be <lb/>exported by the Bank of Mozambique. Since 2002, a prohibition applies to exports of <lb/>unprocessed wood, reserved to local processors, but not to exports of unprocessed <lb/>precious tropical wood species, such as ebony and rosewood. <lb/>Namibia (2009, 2003) <lb/>Exports, except to SACU members, are subject to automatic licensing, except for some <lb/>products that require a non-automatic permit. These include medicines; live animals and <lb/>genetic materials; all ostrich breeding materials; meat and game products; protected <lb/>species under CITES; plants; firearms and explosives; and minerals, including diamonds <lb/>and gold. Export permits from the Meat Board of Namibia are required for exports of <lb/>livestock. Export permits for maize, wheat and mahangu are required from the Namibian <lb/>Agronomic Board. <lb/>Niger (LDC) (2009, <lb/>2003) <lb/>Since 1998, Niger has imposed an export ban on seed cotton in order to guarantee the <lb/>development of the cotton subsector. As part of the measures taken to offset the 2005 <lb/>food crisis, the re-export of milled rice has been banned since 2005. <lb/>Nigeria (2005) <lb/>Under Nigeria&apos;s Export Prohibition Act, certain exports are prohibited for purposes of <lb/>domestic food security, value-added considerations, and preservation of cultural heritage. <lb/>Currently, the ban covers raw hides and skins, timber (rough or sawn), scrap metals, <lb/>unprocessed rubber latex and rubber lumps, rice, yams, maize, beans, and artefacts and <lb/>antiquities. Nigeria&apos;s food safety regulations require export licences for unprocessed food <lb/>products; in certain cases, the Minister for Agriculture is empowered to prescribe grades <lb/>and standards of quality for these products. <lb/>Rawanda (LDC) (2004) According to the authorities, other than restrictions under international agreements of <lb/>which Rwanda is a signatory, there are no restrictions on exports. <lb/>Senegal (LDC) (2009, <lb/>2003) <lb/>Senegal does not currently apply any prohibition or quantitative restriction on exports. <lb/>The export of the following goods requires an authorization: gold, hides and skins, and <lb/>petroleum products. Senegal also imposes prohibitions and licensing under the <lb/>multilateral environmental agreements it has signed such as the CITES. <lb/>Sierra Leone (2005) <lb/>Export restrictions are maintained for health, safety, and environmental reasons. A <lb/>special permit issued by the Ministry of Agriculture and Natural Resources is required for <lb/>the exportation of plants and charcoal. Gold and diamonds, as well as any other goods or <lb/>materials as may be prescribed by law, are subject to export licensing requirements. <lb/></body>

			<body>South Africa <lb/>(2009, 2003) <lb/>A number of products are still subject to export control, including export permits (licences) and <lb/>prohibition. Controls are maintained on grounds of safety, security, and the environment, and to <lb/>ensure compliance with international obligations under treaties and conventions to which South <lb/>Africa is a signatory (for example, the Montreal Protocol). Exports of meat require a health <lb/>certificate and the payment of fees, depending upon the province, prior to export. Exports of any <lb/>alcoholic product with an alcohol content of more than 1%, except for beer, sorghum beer, and <lb/>medicines, require an export certificate. <lb/>Suriname <lb/>(2004) <lb/>The Negative List Decision adopted under the Law on the Movement of Goods lists the products <lb/>that are currently subject to export restrictions, which can take the form of prohibitions or non-<lb/>automatic licensing requirements. <lb/>Swaziland <lb/>(2009, 2003) <lb/>Export restrictions apply to products controlled under the various conventions on threatened <lb/>species, etc. to which Swaziland belongs. Export prohibitions may also be imposed in case of <lb/>food shortages resulting from drought or other natural disasters. <lb/>Tanzania (LDC) <lb/>(2006) <lb/>Since June 1998, export restrictions in the agriculture sector have been in place for white maize, <lb/>rice, cereals, beans, and unprocessed fish products; these are due to the precarious food <lb/>supply situation brought about by the ongoing drought conditions. <lb/>Togo (LDC) <lb/>(2006) <lb/>Commodity exports (coffee, cocoa, cotton fibre) have been free of all licensing requirements <lb/>since 1996. Coffee, cocoa and seed cotton are subject to quality, packaging and marking <lb/>standards. The exportation of rough diamonds from Togo is subject to the Kimberley Process <lb/>certification system. <lb/>Tunisia (2005) <lb/>There are several product groups that can only be exported with the prior authorization of the <lb/>Ministry of Trade, valid for six months. The main purpose of authorization is to prevent <lb/>shortages and ensure the availability of inputs for domestic industry. <lb/>Uganda (LDC) <lb/>(2006) <lb/>Exports of items that appear on Uganda&apos;s negative list are not allowed, and certain exports <lb/>require authorization from regulatory bodies. The negative list of exports includes timber, <lb/>charcoal, and whole fresh fish. For items covered by international conventions to which Uganda <lb/>is a signatory, such as some wild animals and their trophies, prior authorization must be <lb/>obtained from the Uganda Wildlife Authority; this is granted only if the exporter can satisfy the <lb/>authorities that the export is sustainable without endangering the species. <lb/>Zambia (LDC) <lb/>(2009) <lb/>Export prohibitions apply to certain types of logs under international agreements, and <lb/>occasionally for grains (during drought years). There are no general export licensing <lb/>requirements (except for prescribed goods) although certain goods, such as fertilizers and <lb/>gemstones require special export permits. <lb/>Americas <lb/>Antigua and <lb/>Barbuda (2007) <lb/>Exports of wild birds are prohibited, as well as exports of any live or dead wildlife or parts, in <lb/>accordance with the CITES. <lb/>Argentina (2007) <lb/>Since the previous trade policy review, export prohibitions have been reintroduced for <lb/>commercial reasons. In July 2005, it was decided to suspend exports of tailings of copper and <lb/>aluminium and their alloys for 90 days. The export ban was extended in March 2006 for a period <lb/>of 180 days. MEP Resolution No. 114 of 8 March 2006 suspended exports of bovine livestock <lb/>on the hoof and of certain cuts and preparations and preserves of bovine meat for a period of <lb/>180 days, except for foreign sales of &quot;Hilton beef&quot; subject to tariff quotas and sales covered by <lb/>bilateral agreements. The MEP justified the measure as necessary to maintain the stability of <lb/>beef prices in the face of price increases caused partly by external demand. This was prompted <lb/>by the National Government&apos;s priority of maintaining supply to the domestic market at <lb/>reasonable prices. In May 2006, the export ban was replaced by a quantitative restriction under <lb/>MEP Resolution No. 397/2006. Specifically, an export quota was set for the period between 1 <lb/>June and 30 November 2006, equivalent to 40 % of the volume recorded in the same period in <lb/>2005, with a requirement not to exceed 50 % of this total in each quarter. The established quota <lb/>is shared among exporters in proportion to the physical volume exported in the reference period. <lb/>In addition to the rules officially restricting exports, the Government has concluded agreements <lb/>whereby exporters of certain goods agree to voluntarily restrain their foreign sales, so as to <lb/>control price trends for these goods in the domestic market. <lb/></body>

			<div type="annex">Barbados <lb/>(2008) <lb/>At the end of 2007, an export license was required for: black coral, live sheep and goats; <lb/>tortoiseshell; and radioactive chemical elements. These licenses are not automatic and apply <lb/>irrespective of destination. <lb/>Belize <lb/>(2004) <lb/>Under the Supplies Control Act, 1963 (Cap. 293, 2000) and the Supplies Control (Import/Export) <lb/>Regulations, exports of certain products require a licence, regardless of their destination. <lb/>Licences for beans and sugar are automatic; for all other products – live animals, fish, <lb/>crustaceans and molluscs, logs and lumber and citrus fruit – the Supply Control Unit must <lb/>generally consult with the government body or association responsible for the product before <lb/>granting the licence. No export licences are granted for rosewood or medicate log and lumber, <lb/>and all other unfinished articles manufactured therefrom. According to the authorities, in 2003, <lb/>the Supplies Control Unit granted five export licences for live animals, 77 for fish, crustaceans <lb/>and molluscs, 113 for logs and lumber, 16 for beans, and 67 for sugar; no export licences were <lb/>issued for citrus. <lb/>Bolivia (2005) <lb/>In general, export of products affecting public health, State security, conservation of fauna and <lb/>flora and the cultural, historical and archaeological heritage is banned. Other exports may also <lb/>be prohibited by law. Pursuant to the 1996 Forestry Law (Law No. 1.700 of 12 July 1996), the <lb/>export of unprocessed forestry products is subject to restrictions and is strictly regulated. <lb/>Brazil (2009, <lb/>2004) <lb/>Exports of some organic chemicals included in HS Chapter 29 are prohibited to non-signatories <lb/>of the Montreal Protocol. Brazil also restricts exports to comply with United Nations resolutions: <lb/>exports of weapons and military equipment to Iraq, Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Somalia are <lb/>forbidden. Exports of certain wood (pine, imbuia, and virola) are subject to specific rules and <lb/>require prior authorization from the Brazilian Institute of the Environment and Renewable <lb/>Natural Resources (IBAMA). Exports of a relatively large number of products are subject to prior <lb/>authorization from different agencies, generally for safety, health, security or environmental <lb/>reasons, or when they are subject to export quotas. The list included some 663 tariff headings at <lb/>the HS eight-digit level in April 2008, representing some 6.8% of all tariff headings. <lb/>Canada (OECD) <lb/>(2007, 2003) <lb/>Most Canadian export controls are in place under the Export and Import Permits Act, <lb/>administered by the Export and Import Control Bureau. Section 3 of the Export and Import <lb/>Permits Act, the Export Control List (ECL), contains articles controlled for any of the following <lb/>purposes: to ensure that any action taken to promote and encourage the further processing in <lb/>Canada of a natural resource that is produced in Canada is not rendered ineffective by reason <lb/>of the unrestricted exportation of that natural resource; to limit or keep under surveillance the <lb/>export of any raw or processed good that is produced in Canada in circumstances of surplus <lb/>supply and depressed prices and that is not an agricultural product; to implement an <lb/>intergovernmental arrangement or commitment; to ensure that there is an adequate supply and <lb/>distribution of the article in Canada for defence or other needs; or to control the export of arms, <lb/>ammunition, implements or munitions of war or articles of a strategic nature or value the use of <lb/>which might be detrimental to the security of Canada. The vast majority of controlled exports are <lb/>controlled pursuant to international agreements that Canada has signed. <lb/>Chile (2009, <lb/>2003) <lb/>Chile does not have an export licensing regime. No Chilean exports are subject to export <lb/>quotas, which are prohibited by Law No. 18.840. Export prohibitions or controls apply to goods <lb/>whose trade is regulated by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species <lb/>(CITES). Chile also prohibits exports of goods such as: (i) anthropological, archaeological, <lb/>ethnic, historic, and paleontological objects and their parts; (ii) Chilean pine (botanical name <lb/>araucaria araucana) and larch; and (iii) psychotropic substances and other chemicals. <lb/>Colombia <lb/>(2006) <lb/>Colombia has commitments to apply restrictions on the exportation of certain products under the <lb/>Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, the Basel <lb/>Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and their <lb/>Disposal and the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer. Exports of <lb/>goods that form part of Colombia&apos;s cultural, artistic, archaeological and historical heritage are <lb/>also restricted. Coffee exports are prohibited if they do not comply with the quality standards <lb/>established by the National Coffee Growers&apos; Committee. <lb/>Costa Rica <lb/>(2007) <lb/>Export prohibitions are mainly imposed for reasons of national security, protection of <lb/>Costa Rica&apos;s heritage and for environmental reasons. Article 26 of Forestry Law No. 7575 of <lb/>13 February 1996 bans the export of logs and roughly squared wood from forests of specific <lb/>species. The objective of the Forestry Law is, inter alia, to ensure the conservation of natural <lb/>forests, the industrialization of forestry resources intended for this purpose and the creation of <lb/>employment.

This export prohibition is for the protection <lb/>and conservation of wildlife. <lb/>Dominican <lb/>Republic (2008) <lb/>The export of some products can be prohibited for environmental, public health or food safety <lb/>reasons. Although exporters&apos; licences have been abolished, some products are subject to <lb/>special export licences or certificates. In order to protect public health and the environment, the <lb/>Dominican Republic prohibits the export of some products, including human blood and blood <lb/>products, amber in its natural state, certain types of wood, and sand, gravel and soil suitable for <lb/>cultivation. In accordance with its CITES commitments, the Dominican Republic bans the export <lb/>of tortoiseshell in its natural raw state. <lb/>Ecuador (2005) <lb/>Ecuador has undertaken to apply export restrictions to certain products pursuant to the <lb/>Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Flora and Fauna and the <lb/>Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and Their <lb/>Disposal, and the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer. The <lb/>exportation of roundwood is prohibited except in limited quantities for scientific and experimental <lb/>purposes. The exportation of semi-finished forest products is authorized only when &quot;domestic <lb/>needs and the minimum levels of industrialization have been met. &quot; <lb/>El Salvador <lb/>(2003) <lb/>In general, export prohibitions are applied in order to protect the environment or the cultural <lb/>heritage or for economic reasons. At the end of 2002, the only prohibited exports were exports <lb/>of plants and animals in danger of extinction, in accordance with the Convention on International <lb/>Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), and exports of gas for domestic <lb/>consumption whose price is controlled on the internal market. <lb/>Guyana <lb/>(2009, 2003) <lb/>A number of items are subject to export licensing including: poultry feed; rice bran; rice chips, <lb/>rice dust, rice stock feed; wheat bran, wheat middlings, and wheat screenings; cane sugar in <lb/>solid form; fertilizers; hides and skins; feathers, bird skins with feathers, prepared feathers, <lb/>ornamental feathers, and other feather articles; gold; jewellery of precious metal or rolled <lb/>precious metal; scrap metal; articles made out of base metals; and arms and ammunition. Under <lb/>the Guyana Timber Export Act of 1973 (Cap. 67:03), written approval of the Guyana Timber <lb/>Export Commission must be obtained in order to export timber. State-owned companies are <lb/>involved in the export of sugar and gold. <lb/>Grenada <lb/>(2007) <lb/>Grenada prohibits exports of prepared opium, Indian hemp; and unfermented cocoa. The export <lb/>of a number of products is subject to licensing requirements. Exports of gas cylinders, coral, all <lb/>mineral products (HS chapter 25), live sheep, and live goats are subject to approval and receipt <lb/>of an export license. <lb/>Guatemala <lb/>(2009) <lb/>Export restrictions are mainly imposed for reasons of national security, protection of <lb/>Guatemala&apos;s heritage or for environmental reasons. Under the Forestry Law of 2 December <lb/>1996 (Decree No. 101-96), exports of logs of more than 11 cm in diameter is banned, unless <lb/>they come from plantations or nurseries registered with the INAB, in which case they require an <lb/>export licence. The ban does not apply to furniture and processed products made from wood. <lb/>Haiti (LDC) <lb/>(2004) <lb/>Controls are carried out in order to prevent tax fraud, particularly in the case of re-export. These <lb/>are carried out when an export permit is issued. As a general rule, the export of animal and <lb/>plant products requires prior authorization. Some types of live animals belonging to endangered <lb/>species (green anoles, mabuyas, snails) may not be exported so as to protect the national <lb/>heritage. The shipment of mangoes without proper fumigation treatment is also banned. Quality <lb/>controls and phytosanitary and animal health measures also apply to exports of coffee, cacao, <lb/>mangoes and animal products. <lb/></div>

			<body>Honduras <lb/>(2003) <lb/>Decree No. 323-98 of 18 December 1998 prohibits the export of wood from certain forests that <lb/>has not been incorporated into finished products, furniture or manufactured furniture parts. It <lb/>also bans the export of all forestry products from certain forests without due approval from the <lb/>State Forest Administration. As a contracting party to the International Convention on <lb/>International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), Honduras has <lb/>undertaken to prohibit exports of certain plants and animals threatened with extinction, in <lb/>accordance with the Convention. <lb/>Jamaica (2005) <lb/>Goods generally prohibited for export are listed in the Customs Act; the list is made up of arms, <lb/>ammunition, and naval stores; and spirits and wines. In addition, some exports such as shells <lb/>and some live animals are prohibited under international conventions. A number of products are <lb/>subject to export licensing. Export licences are required for environmental concerns, such as the <lb/>protection of crocodiles, shells and some live animals. <lb/>Mexico (OECD) <lb/>(2008) <lb/>The export of some goods is prohibited, including certain products of animal origin, plants, <lb/>narcotics and archaeological goods. This prohibition is based on the commitments in <lb/>international agreements signed by Mexico, the control of dangerous substances, sanitary, <lb/>phytosanitary and health reasons, and protection of the cultural and historical heritage. A prior <lb/>export licence issued by the Ministry of Economy (SE) is required for the export of 16 tariff <lb/>headings; the grounds for these licenses are the Mexican State&apos;s exclusive right to exploit and <lb/>market non-renewable natural resources. Since the previous review, the number of HS <lb/>headings subject to a prior licence has almost been halved from 28 headings. <lb/>Nicaragua <lb/>(2006) <lb/>Nicaragua still bans export of the following: caoba roundwood (only the export of caoba in the <lb/>form of sawn wood, plywood or veneered wood is allowed), spiny lobsters during their <lb/>reproductive phase or spawning (with eggs), with shells (with sperm receptacle) or moulting, <lb/>and estuary shrimps in the larval or juvenile phase. Nicaragua imposes export licensing <lb/>requirements to ensure compliance with quality and health controls or to meet international <lb/>commitments on international trade in wildlife under the CITES (CITES export certificate). <lb/>Exports of sawn wood also require a licence in the form of an authorization. <lb/>Panama (2007) <lb/>As a contracting party to the CITES, Panama prohibits exports of certain plants and animals in <lb/>danger of extinction in accordance with that Convention. Wood exports are governed by <lb/>Executive Decree No. 57 of 5 June 2002, which prohibits the exportation of wood in the form of <lb/>logs, stumps, roundwood or blocks, sawn or roughly dressed, of any species from natural <lb/>forests, as well as wood submerged in water. The authorities have noted that the purpose of the <lb/>measure is to guarantee the domestic supply of wood, in order to encourage the manufacture of <lb/>furniture at national level. <lb/>Paraguay <lb/>(2005) <lb/>Law No. 96/92 prohibits the hunting, commercial exploitation and export of wild animals in order <lb/>to guarantee the adequate protection, conservation and rational use of Paraguay&apos;s biodiversity; <lb/>this prohibition applies only to wildlife species not covered by express authorization of the <lb/>Environmental Secretariat. The authorities noted that Paraguay does not apply temporary <lb/>measures on exports of agricultural products for reasons relating to domestic supply, except in <lb/>the case of hides. The Ministry of Industry and Trade established a prior licensing requirement <lb/>in 2003 for exports of waste and scrap of aluminium or copper and copper/tin based alloys <lb/>(bronze). <lb/>Peru <lb/>(2007) <lb/>The exportation of wood in log form and other forest products in their &quot; natural state &quot; is <lb/>prohibited, except where obtained from nurseries or forestry plantations and &quot; not requiring <lb/>processing for their final consumption. &quot; A further export prohibition applies to seeds, specimens <lb/>and products of maca in the natural state or having undergone primary processing. The purpose <lb/>of this measure is to promote maca exports with higher value-added. <lb/>St. Kitts and <lb/>Nevis (2007) <lb/>Export licences are required for vegetables, monkeys, and several types of seafood. Export <lb/>restrictions are generally for safety and health purposes. <lb/>St. Lucia <lb/>(2007) <lb/>Restricted exports products include ginger and dry coconut, narcotics and drugs. Export-<lb/>licensing requirements apply for any goods covered by CITES. <lb/></body>

			<body>St. Vincent and <lb/>the Grenadines <lb/>(2007) <lb/>Exports of birds under HS 0106.99 are restricted and, in general, CITES rules are followed. <lb/>Under Import and Export (Control) Regulations No. 10 of 1992, a licence is required for exports <lb/>of: live swine; live sheep and goats; and live, frozen, fresh or chilled, and prepared or preserved <lb/>lobsters. In 2002, restrictions were lifted on exports of dried coconuts, potatoes, oranges, and <lb/>plantains. A phytosanitary certificate from the Ministry of Agriculture must be obtained for the <lb/>export of local produce or plants and plant materials. <lb/>Trinidad and <lb/>Tobago (2005) <lb/>A number of products require export licences from the Ministry of Trade and Industry. The <lb/>products covered include non-ferrous metal scrap and ores, planting material, including tissue <lb/>culture and other plant propagation material of (CITES) listed species. <lb/>United States <lb/>(OECD) (2008, <lb/>2006, 2004) <lb/>The United States maintains export restrictions and controls for national security or foreign <lb/>policy purpose, or to address shortages of scarce materials. Export controls can be based on <lb/>US domestic legislation, policy decisions, UN resolutions or on US participation in four non-<lb/>binding export control regimes: the Wassenaar Arrangement, which deals with controls of <lb/>conventional arms and dual-use exports, the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR), the <lb/>Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG), and the Australia Group (AG, chemical and biological non-<lb/>proliferation). <lb/>Uruguay <lb/>(2006) <lb/>Some exports are prohibited or subject to special requirements for reasons such as <lb/>environmental protection, to meet &quot;the country&apos;s needs, &quot; for sanitary reasons, or to protect <lb/>consumers. Decree No. 359/000 of 30 November 2000 imposed an initial temporary 180-day <lb/>ban on the export of steel and cast iron scrap. Subsequently, Decree No. 209/02 of 12 June <lb/>2002 definitively banned the export of these products. <lb/></body>
