            <head>France and in other European countries. In<lb/> 1<lb/> The decision to build a high-speed line between Paris and Lyons was taken in September<lb/> 1975. Yves Crozet — Discussion Paper 2013-26 — © OECD/ITF 2013<lb/> 2010, high-speed rail traffic amounted to 52 billion passenger-kilometres in France as<lb/> against 23 billion in Germany, 11 billion in Italy and Spain, 3 billion in Sweden and<lb/> 1 billion in Belgium and Great Britain. This relative domination by France can be<lb/> explained by its long-held preference for high speed: a field in which France has played<lb/> the leading role in Europe on the basis of what we might call the &quot; Paris-Lyon model &quot; .</head>

Thanks to those subsidies, it has been possible to<lb/> develop a TGV service even in towns that are located far from LGV lines. Because TGVs<lb/> can run on conventional lines (provided the lines are electrified), over 200 stations in<lb/> France are now served by TGVs. This can be seen from Map 1. TGVs run on an LGV for<lb/> part of their journey and on conventional line for the remaining, often long, section.<lb/> Thus, it is possible to travel from Marseille to Rennes, or from Marseille to Strasbourg,<lb/> and even to Frankfurt in Germany, without changing TGV. Traffic is only moderate on<lb/> these links compared to the Paris-Lyon route, but this helps to expand the TGV offer and<lb/> make it more accessible for customers.<lb/> 3<lb/> The author of this paper was one of the four experts. 6<lb/> Yves Crozet — Discussion Paper 2013-26 — © OECD/ITF 2013<lb/> Map 1.

            <figDesc>France led other countries to extend their LGV network<lb/> and TGV offer. There are two different underlying logics behind this development.<lb/> </figDesc>
<lb/> 
            <table> The first, which can be seen on Map 2, consists of applying the &quot; Paris-Lyon<lb/> model &quot; to destinations outside French territory. This was the logic underlying the<lb/> construction of the Paris-Brussels and Paris-London links (the opening of the<lb/> Channel Tunnel dates from 1993, as does the Paris-Lille line). Following Brussels,<lb/> there are now extensions as far as Amsterdam (the new HSL Zuid line) in the<lb/> Netherlands and Cologne in Germany. Since 2007 and the opening of the LGV Est<lb/> line, it has also become possible to reach German cities such as Karlsruhe,<lb/> Stuttgart and Munich by direct TGV. It is worth noting that these lines have not<lb/> been developed as part of a competitive structure but in co-operation between<lb/> the national rail operators of France, Belgium, the United Kingdom, Germany and<lb/> the Netherlands. Thus the company Thalys, which serves Paris, Brussels,<lb/> Amsterdam and Cologne, is a subsidiary of various historic operators (SNCF,<lb/> SNCB, NS, etc.). The same applies to Eurostar, the company that serves London,<lb/> Brussels and Paris via the Channel Tunnel.<lb/>  There is another form of high-speed rail development which can be seen in<lb/> Germany in particular, but also in the United Kingdom. </table>

            <table>Spanish network was not built to UIC gauge. Connecting the Spanish network to 11<lb/> the European network entailed adjusting to the UIC standard, and so Spain opted,<lb/> with the help of the European Union, to embark on the construction of an entirely<lb/> new LGV network. Like France, Spain first built lines between the capital (Madrid)<lb/> and the main conurbations such as Seville and Barcelona. However, Spanish<lb/> ambition does not stop there. Spain aims to create a whole new rail network<lb/> covering the entire territory, including links between medium-sized towns. The<lb/> Spanish LGV network is therefore the most extensive in Europe. It already<lb/> possesses 2 300 km of lines, and new LGVs are still under construction. The flip<lb/> side of this ambition is the high cost for users (tickets are relatively expensive)<lb/> and, in particular, for the regional authorities which have to subsidise the<lb/> infrastructure heavily. It is worth noting that a network which is 20% more<lb/> extensive than the French network carries only 20% of the TGV traffic that France<lb/> carries.</table>
