It explores three case studies and considers how effective they are in <lb/>enhancing teaching and learning outcomes. <lb/>The recent advent of wireless broadband Internet access and mobile communications devices <lb/>has provided remarkable opportunities for 21 st century blended learning models – simultaneous <lb/>online and face-to-face – and seriously called into question the industrial-age traditional &quot; egg crate <lb/>classroom &quot; model of teaching and learning. It has also enabled the emergence of a true synchronous/ <lb/>asynchronous and virtual/physical matrix of learning opportunities for which our existing built learning <lb/>environment infrastructure is not well suited. 1 <lb/>In response to these developments, many innovative learning environments are being trialed. These <lb/>include an increasing focus on the &quot; third space &quot; which supports social forms of student interaction. <lb/>The important issue here, especially in universities, is that students can now learn off-campus on line. <lb/></body>

			<body>Technology-enabled active learning environments: an appraisal <lb/>This is forcing us to rethink the nature of the 21 st century campus, and more specifically what physical <lb/>attributes need to be provided to encourage students to attend campuses and to actually meet face-to-<lb/>face with their colleagues, rather than interacting through the now prevalent social networking tools. <lb/>Interestingly, many of these spatial developments are being instigated – through initiatives lead by <lb/>information technology and communications departments – particularly in universities and increasingly <lb/>in further education and schools. 2 <lb/>LeARning technoLogieS <lb/>The above developments are blurring the boundaries between what has traditionally been seen as the <lb/> &quot; built learning environment &quot; and the information and communications technologies that support those <lb/>spaces. The rapidly emerging models of &quot; technology enhanced learning environments &quot; (TEAL) – first <lb/>introduced at MIT in 2003 3 – emphasises that acoustics, furniture, lighting (both natural and artificial), <lb/>mobility, flexibility, air temperature and security must support the educational technologies being <lb/>designed for those spaces. The traditional physical elements are technologies as well, but increasingly <lb/>these are interdependent with ICTs and audio-visual educational technologies. <lb/>In my view, all of these elements should be integrated under the one heading of &quot; learning technologies &quot; <lb/>and be considered within the same framework, whether it be budget, design, maintenance or flexibility. <lb/>The key issue is that the life cycle of each element and how these vary must be attended to in such a way <lb/>that all elements are up to date. 4 &quot; Stuff &quot; , as Brand calls the moveable elements, includes technologies <lb/>such as computers which tend to have a life cycle of 3 years. The space plan may well be 7 years, the <lb/>services 10-20 years whilst the structure could be in excess of 100 years. We are, of course, finding that <lb/>inserting these new technologies into existing buildings, and especially heritage buildings, is complex. <lb/>2.

			<body>Technology-enabled active learning environments: an appraisal <lb/>LeARning And teAching <lb/>It is paramount that these new innovations align the physical space with the educational technologies <lb/>so that both can support the pedagogies envisaged for those spaces. It is critical that this happen; after <lb/>all, the traditional classroom had to evolve from simply meeting the didactive teaching methods which <lb/>predominated prior to the emergence of significant educational technology. <lb/>I believe that the limitations of the traditional classroom in supporting these learning approaches is a cause <lb/>of concern, whether they be in the form of lecture theatres and seminar/tutorial rooms in universities, <lb/>or closed boxes for 25-35-40-45 students in schools (depending on the relevant country). The closed <lb/>classroom represents a physically outdated teaching model which does not match the inter-connected <lb/>virtual world we now live in. Students are learning collaboratively through a vast array of informal learning <lb/>spaces both on and off campus, yet are still crammed into outdated traditional models. What we know as <lb/>the &quot; knowledge age &quot; is rapidly morphing into a &quot; creative age &quot; yet classrooms, according to the students <lb/>I have surveyed, are the least creative space they can learn in. <lb/>These learning spaces need to adapt to meet the emerging needs of a wide range of pedagogies. <lb/>This concept is reflected in the Australian Learning and Teaching Council&apos;s 5 recent appointment of <lb/>15 discipline-specific teaching and learning advisors. <lb/>Although the original TEAL model noted above was launched to rejuvenate the teaching of Physics 1 at <lb/>MIT, many versions of it have proliferated in geology, chemistry, engineering, education, architecture <lb/>and some other disciplines. It is in engineering that the most advances have been made and this is <lb/>largely because of the need for engineers to have a wide range of competencies than cannot be assessed <lb/>solely in the examination room. <lb/>About the same time as TEAL, MIT&apos;s Aeronautical School initiated a new pedagogical model called <lb/>CDIO (conceive, design, implement and operate). This approach has now taken off across the globe. Its <lb/>wide use and variations in practice can be seen at www.cdio.org. <lb/>These issues are important because engineering schools are preparing students who, as professional <lb/>engineers, will be required to work in self-directed ways through problem solving and collaborative <lb/>team work. 6 <lb/>A critical notion to understand is the concept of graduate attributes or graduate competencies. For <lb/>engineers, these might be expanded to include critical thinking, communicating to peers and the wider <lb/>community, working in multi-disciplinary teams and environmental literacy. Engineers are involved <lb/>in complex projects involving infrastructure which means they will have to work across – and in <lb/>collaboration with – a range of disciplines. To continue to learn in a didactive, teacher-centred way will <lb/>not provide students with those competencies. <lb/>5. See http://www.altc.edu.au/april2009-altc-discipline-scholars-begin. <lb/>6.

			<body>Technology-enabled active learning environments: an appraisal <lb/>This was first understood in the teaching of medical students. For some 30 years medical students have <lb/>been taught in a collaborative way with groups of ten students being supported by a tutor. This model <lb/>is difficult to achieve across all disciplines because of budget constraints, but the approach can be <lb/>modeled using the TEAL concept. <lb/>cASe StUdieS 7 <lb/>In order to illustrate how effective they are in enhancing teaching and learning outcomes, three case <lb/>studies have been selected and are presented in chronological order, from 2003 to 2010. <lb/>the Australian Science and Mathematics School (ASMS) 8 <lb/>Opened in 2003, this public senior high school for pupils aged 15-18 (the final three years of secondary <lb/>school) has been featured in many publications and received many international visitors because of its <lb/>innovative design which meets what was then seen as a &quot; radical &quot; pedagogical approach. This school <lb/>was planned around the CDIO concept before that concept became common knowledge. <lb/>7. For further information, see www.woodsbagot.com. <lb/>8.

			<body>Technology-enabled active learning environments: an appraisal <lb/>cdio in the Faculty of engineering, University of Melbourne <lb/>Conceive, design, implement and operate (CDIO) is the most recent version of collaborative learning <lb/>spaces developed in the faculty. The CDIO concept allows students to work on theory and on practice <lb/>seamlessly. <lb/>Faculty of Engineering, <lb/>Learning Collaborative <lb/>Classroom <lb/>Faculty of Engineering, <lb/>Learning Collaborative <lb/>Classroom <lb/>Key points include: <lb/>• It is designed for ten groups of six (60 students in all), with each group of six able to work in twos or <lb/>threes.<lb/>• It allows students to work collaboratively on project-based activities in three-hour sessions. Not all <lb/>students use the practical studio or laboratory at the same time, but they work on specific set projects <lb/>in small groups.<lb/>• Social spaces and reflective spaces surround the studios for informal and collaborative study.<lb/>• It is used by the Faculty of Architecture, Building and Planning for construction students.<lb/>• Students now feel part of a community of learners and are observed within the Faculty for greater <lb/>periods of time on campus, including weekends and evenings<lb/>evALUAtion oF teAL <lb/>These emerging TEAL models which proliferated since MIT first launched the concept in 2003 are in <lb/>the early stages of evaluation. Some publically available articles on evaluation show that these spaces <lb/>work well. Although it is difficult to argue that the physical learning environment by itself can enhance <lb/>teaching and learning, it is clear that the physical learning environment can inhibit the practice of <lb/>some forms of effective pedagogy and therefore limit the extent to which graduate competencies can <lb/>be delivered to students. <lb/>For example, on average 90% of ASMS&apos;s students go on to university, and yet it has no classrooms. However, <lb/>another equivalent but independent senior secondary school, which only has classrooms and uses a tutor <lb/>model (but with equally motivated teachers and students) also results in 90% entry to university. The key <lb/>question, still to be researched, is whether these respective students are successful at the end of the first <lb/>year and can then move effectively through the university system. Specifically, is the TEAL approach more <lb/>effective in creating life-long learners compared to the 19 th century traditional classroom model? <lb/></body>

			<body>Technology-enabled active learning environments: an appraisal <lb/>Some studies suggest that there are significant improvements to learning outcomes in adopting this <lb/>approach. <lb/>Overall, these Active Learning Classrooms yielded very positive responses from instructors and <lb/>students. The instructors who were interviewed enjoyed teaching in the rooms so much that their only <lb/>concern was a fear of not being able to continue to teach in these new learning spaces. Similarly, more <lb/>than 85% of students recommended the Active Learning Classrooms for other classes. Instructors and <lb/>students overwhelmingly found that this space made a difference for them. &quot; I love this space! It makes <lb/>me feel appreciated as a student, and I feel intellectually invigorated when I work and learn in it. 9 <lb/>The studio space is also a significant investment and so must clearly improve learning outcomes: <lb/>engagement, attitude and collaboration in addition to absorption of the curriculum. Measures of <lb/>those outcomes are necessarily qualitative at this point, but based on comments from student and <lb/>faculty who actually learned and taught in the space, we would cautiously say that the studio has <lb/>met those goals. Of course we will need to continue to evaluate progress in outcomes as people gain <lb/>experience with using the space. 10 <lb/>In evaluating teachers&apos; learning at the ASMS, a recent doctoral graduate found significant connections <lb/>between the pedagogical process and the flexibility of the ASMS school design. 11 Clearly, evaluation <lb/>of the TEAL approach involves both quantitative and qualitative examination. It is also evident that <lb/>qualitative studies show significant support for the TEAL model from both teachers and students. Further <lb/>quantitative study is required to support these qualitative findings and this work is currently underway at <lb/>the University of Melbourne&apos;s LEARN centre. 12 Findings will be made available as they become public. <lb/>What is most pleasing from my viewpoint is that there are exciting alternatives emerging to the traditional <lb/>closed classroom and these are gaining increasing acceptance. I certainly look forward to evaluating <lb/>and using these findings in future projects and research. <lb/>For more information, contact: <lb/>Dr. Kenn Fisher <lb/>Associate Professor Learning Environments <lb/>Faculty of Architecture, Building &amp; Planning <lb/>Learning Environments (Action) Research Network <lb/>University of Melbourne <lb/>Parkville, Victoria <lb/>Australia <lb/>Tel.: +61424022039 <lb/>E-mail: fisherk@unimelb.edu.au <lb/>9.
