damage growth prospects. In Belgium, one of the most densely populated OECD countries, pressure on the 
environment is particularly strong, and is reinforced by the high energy intensity of the economy and 
concentrated agriculture. Environmental policy backlogs accumulated over the years highlight the 
challenges of reducing greenhouse gas emissions and water pollution in a cost-efficient way. To achieve 
environmental goals at minimum cost across the economy the polluters should face the marginal costs of 
the externalities they impose, which should be achieved by increasing reliance on environmental taxation. 
Potential adverse effects on income distribution could then be addressed in the tax benefit system. 
Moreover, where environmental responsibilities are better dealt with at the regional level, regions should 
have the most efficient tools, such as taxation powers. Where, due to economies of scale and scope or 
important cross-regional effects, environmental issues are better dealt with at the national level (for 
instance in renewable energy sources and transport policies), better co-ordination among regions or a 
greater role of the federal level should be envisaged. This Working Paper relates to the 2011 OECD 
Economic Review of Belgium (www.oecd.org/eco/surveys/Belgium). JEL classification codes: Q28, Q48, Q53, Q54, Q58, R41, R48. 
Keywords: Belgium; green growth; environmental policies; greenhouse gas emissions; energy efficiency; pollution; 
renewable energy; transport policies; road pricing; federalism ******* Une croissance plus verte en Belgique La dégradation de l'environnement due au changement climatique et à la pollution peut porter atteinte au niveau de 
vie et aux perspectives de croissance. En Belgique, l'un des pays de l'OCDE les plus densément peuplés, la pression 
sur l'environnement est particulièrement forte, et encore aggravée par la haute intensité énergétique de l'économie et la 
concentration de l'agriculture. Les retards accumulés par la politique environnementale au fil des années accentuent 
encore le défi qui consiste à réduire, avec un bon rapport coût-efficacité, les émissions de gaz à effet de serre et la 
pollution de l'eau. Pour que les objectifs environnementaux soient atteints pour un coût minimal dans l'ensemble de 
l'économie, les pollueurs devraient supporter le coût marginal des externalités qu'ils imposent, ce qui devrait être 
obtenu par un recours accru à la taxation environnementale. Les conséquences indésirables qui pourraient en découler 
pour la répartition des revenus pourraient alors trouver une solution dans le cadre du système de prélèvements et de 
prestations. De plus, dans les cas où les responsabilités environnementales sont mieux prises en charge au niveau 
régional, les régions devraient disposer des outils les plus efficaces, tels que le pouvoir de taxation. Lorsque, en 
raison d'économies d'échelle et de gamme ou de la présence d'importants effets transrégionaux, les questions 
d'environnement relèvent davantage de l'échelon national (par exemple, les sources d'énergie renouvelables et les 
politiques de transport), une meilleure coordination des régions ou un rôle accru des autorités fédérales devraient 
être envisagés. Ce Document de travail se rapporte à l'Étude économique de l'OCDE de la Belgique 2011

ECO/WKP(2011)63 4 ECO/WKP(2011)63 5 Greener growth in the Belgian federation By Tomasz Koźluk 1 Over the past decade progress has been made in assuring sustainable development and a better and 
healthier life for Belgians (OECD, 2007a), but environmental performance is still often judged as 
disappointing. 2 As further objectives are being set, the challenge for the coming years will be to meet them 
in a cost-efficient way. This paper goes through the areas of environmental policies where the problems are 
most pressing, starting from the goal of reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in this energy intensive 
economy. The slow development of renewable energy is also addressed in the context of climate change. 
Air quality, a particular problem in the main cities, is reviewed within this context of GHG emissions due 
to the interrelations between the two areas. Next, water pollution issues are discussed against the 
background of years of failing to meet European standards, and the intensive use of water resources. 
Finally, the division of environmental responsibilities is discussed, with the aim of assuring cost-efficient 
policies. The greenhouse gas emission targets are becoming increasingly challenging Belgium, as many OECD countries, is likely to fulfil its Kyoto commitments for 2008-12 (Figure 1). 
In the Kyoto protocol Belgium committed to a reduction of 2008-12 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions 
by 7.5% with respect to 1990, slightly less than the EU15 overall target of –8%. The federal government 
and the three regions signed an agreement specifying individual targets for each of them (Table 1). 
Together the regional targets yield a national reduction of emissions of 5.8% and the remainder is to be 
achieved by the federal government through the so-called Kyoto flexible mechanisms, such as the purchase 
of emission rights and emission-offsetting investments abroad. The regions may also use the flexible 
mechanisms to achieve their targets. 3 The 2008-09 emissions have turned out significantly lower than 
initially expected, owing to the drop in activity due to the global crisis – in particular low capacity 
utilisation in industry and slower transport growth (Figure 1 and Table 1). 1. 
The Working Paper is based on Chapter 3 of the OECD's 2011 Survey of Belgium which was prepared 
under the responsibility of the Economic and Development Review Committee. The author is grateful for

For instance, the Environmental Performance Index, which ranks countries according to fulfilment of 
established environmental goals, puts Belgium in 88 th place among 163 countries – the lowest of all OECD 
and EU countries (EPI, 2010). According to WWF, Belgium's ecological footprint – a proxy for the 
unsustainability of resource use – is the fourth highest in the world (WWF, 2010). 3. 
Regional governments can finance the purchase of carbon emission permits (on the EU ETS market) by 
emitters, in excess of the allocated permits. In 2010, the Walloon government planned to finance permits 
for a total of EUR 40-60 million for Arcelor Mittal to restart a blast furnace. ECO/WKP(2011)63 6 Looking forward, the climate change goals are becoming more ambitious. Within the EU's Climate 
and Energy Package (so called 20/20/20, Box 1) Belgium has committed to targets, for 2020 and beyond, 
by: participating in the EU's cap-and-trade Emission Trading Scheme (ETS), 4 adopting Belgian targets on Figure 1. Greenhouse gas emissions have been reduced, partly because of the crisis 1990

and that the GHG-emission intensity of GDP in 2009 is equal to the value in 2008 adjusted by the average decrease in the

The EU's Emission Trading Scheme is a GHG cap-and-trade scheme introduced in 2005 (Norway, 
Liechtenstein and Iceland also joined the scheme). It covers about 10 000 installations in the energy and 
industrial sectors, which generate over 40% of GHG emissions in the countries concerned. Emission rights 
are allocated according to internationally agreed national caps and within the country according to national 
allocation plans (NAPs) – 96% through grandfathering. The Belgian NAP covers over 40% of projected 
emissions: roughly 80% of industrial emissions and 97% of emissions from the energy sector. The NAP 
reserves 8% of emission rights for new entrants. From 2012, the EU scheme will include air transport and 
increase the emphasis on auctioning (over 50% of permits throughout 2013-20) over grandfathering. ECO/WKP(2011)63 7 reducing its non-ETS emissions by 15% (with respect to 2005) and increasing the share of renewable in 
energy consumption to 13%. Additionally, Belgium has adopted a 2020 target of a reduction of primary 
energy consumption by 18% with respect to a 2007 baseline. These targets appear challenging since the 
baseline scenario (assuming no policy change) is an overall 13% increase in GHG emissions by 2020 
relative to 2005 (Bossier et al., 2008). The non-ETS segment is to see a 4% increase. More recent 
estimates show that the crisis has slowed the increase in emissions (FPB, 2010), but even so the targets for 
2020 and beyond are unlikely to be fulfilled without substantial new measures. Table 1. The burden-sharing of greenhouse gas emission reductions across Belgium 1 Commitment (2008-12)

The emission outcomes are presented for illustrative purposes, and are not directly comparable with the emission targets, 
due to the fact that the targets include the ETS segment. The emission permits for the ETS segment are allocated in line with 
country targets can be saved for future years, as well as traded on the ETS. 3. 
Provisional figures 2008 and 2009. Source: International Energy Agency (IEA), Energy Policies of IEA Countries: In-depth review of Belgium, 2009; Regional and Federal 
governments. For the moment, in Belgium there is no clear national strategy on how the 20/20/20 goals are to be 
achieved (Box 2), but it is likely that the governments will sign an internal agreement, as in the case of 
Kyoto targets. If such an agreement will mean different ad hoc targets in each region, implying different 
carbon prices, it will make abatement at minimum cost difficult, due to limited price equalisation 
mechanisms for the non-ETS segment. Nationwide reduction strategies would be hence preferable. ECO/WKP(2011)63 8 Box 1. The European climate change targets for 2020 and beyond For 2020 and beyond, all EU countries committed under the climate and energy package (so called 20/20/20) to: @BULLET Reducing EU-wide GHG emissions by 20% relative to 1990. This includes a 21% cut (relative to 2005) in industries under the ETS and a 10% cut in non-ETS sectors (transport, residential, services and agriculture). 
Each country has an individual target -Belgium committed to the new cuts under the ETS and to cutting 
emissions by 15% in the non-ETS sectors. @BULLET Doubling the overall EU share of renewable energy in final energy consumption to 20% (10% specifically in the transport sector). The Belgian commitment is to increase its share of renewables to 13%. @BULLET Improving energy efficiency by 20%, on the EU level. The EU climate change and energy package also contains a commitment to further reduce emissions (in total 
by 30%) if an international agreement with other major emitters is reached. There are a number of direct consequences of the package for Belgium (as well as for other EU countries). 
Firstly, the effective separation between the ETS and non-ETS targets combined with a lack of market mechanisms 
between the two segments means that it is likely that abatement costs are going to differ between the ETS and the 
non-ETS segments. Hence, pure minimum-cost abatement will not be possible, meaning that there is likely to be too 
much abatement in one segment, while cheaper abatement possibilities in the other will not be exploited. Second, the 
individual targets are characterised by strong interactions. For instance, increasing the (Belgian) share of renewable 
energy in terms of electricity production, while likely to reduce the CO2-intensity of the Belgian economy, may not lead 
to any reduction in EU-wide CO2 emissions, as long as the ETS cap remains fixed. In a similar manner, improvements 
in, for example, household energy efficiency that reduce (Belgian) electricity use, will only decrease the price of 
emission permits on the ETS, but not reduce EU-wide emissions (OECD, 2011b). Box 2. Federal climate change policies and the planned phase-out of nuclear energy Over half of Belgian electricity production takes place in nuclear power plants which constitute the majority of 
base load capacity. On current plans (a 2003 law) nuclear energy is to be phased out between 2015 and 2025. In 2009 
the government took a decision to postpone the phase-out of the three oldest nuclear reactors by 10 years, but the bill 
has not yet been voted. The full depreciation of the nuclear reactors creates a windfall profit for nuclear producers, 
which the government is attempting to tax away. The level of the tax is under discussion, Federal strategies regarding climate change and energy policies focus on increasing the role of renewable 
energy sources – from below 4% of total energy consumption currently to 13% by 2020. As smaller scale renewable 
energy sources are a regional competence, the main plans are for off-shore wind energy (2000 MW of windmill parks 
in the North Sea), biomass (adapting two major coal plants) and bio fuels (encouraging the share in fuel transport via a 
quota system). These measures are to reduce emissions by 4%. For the moment, implementation of the plans is 
lagging – for example windmill developments are delayed because of regulatory issues (capacity constraints on the 
connection to the grid and bureaucratic procedures). The government also plans to increase interconnection capacity 
with neighbouring countries (in 2008 net imports of electricity were over 10% of total electricity use). Other measures 
will yield minor effects. The replacement of nuclear energy is likely to result in increasing overall CO2 emissions by 12-20%, depending 
on the assumptions. The phase-out may not be directly relevant for the 20/20/20 targets, since there is no  " Belgian "  
target for the ETS segment -replacing nuclear with fossil fuel plants will increase the ETS price of emission permits, 
inducing more abatement somewhere across the EU. The resulting increase in electricity prices may have some 
secondary effects on the composition of energy demand, as the relative price of high-emission fossil fuels will 
decrease. Still, there are currently no clear plans on how to replace nuclear. According to a sustainable development 
scenario (GEMIX simulations), a full phase out of nuclear energy would imply an energy mix with about 40% of energy 
coming from windmill farms by 2050. Such an outcome is likely to be expensive due to the limited physical space for 
off-shore windmill plants, and problematic in practice due to their poor reliability to provide base or peak load. ECO/WKP(2011)63 9 The high energy intensity of the economy leads to a large amount of emissions Despite a slight decrease over the past decade, Belgium's energy intensity of GDP remains above the 
OECD average (Figure 2). The reliance on no-emission nuclear energy reduces overall GHG emission-
intensity, but is offset by the widespread use of oil products and one of the lowest shares of renewable 
energy in the OECD. Overall, emission intensity is above the EU average. Energy-intensive industry 
generates almost a third of overall GHG emissions, a higher share than in the majority of OECD countries 
(Figure 3). Road transport contributes a fifth of emissions (roughly the EU average) while residential 
emissions have the second highest share in the OECD. Figure 2. Energy intensity of the economy is high, while emission intensity is average OECD = 100¹ 50

The OECD aggregate is an unweighted average and excludes Chile, Korea and Mexico. Source: United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change Database. Cheap energy has encouraged an energy-heavy production mix The energy intensity of Belgian industry is some 50% higher than in the EU15 (IEA, 2010), 
explaining the high GHG emission intensity (Figure 4, Panel B). The industry structure cannot entirely 
explain the high energy intensity, as the value added share of energy intensive industries (9%) is basically 
equal to the EU average (McKinsey, 2009). The low employment rate (OECD, 2011a) suggests the 
production mix may be a result of years of a combination of relatively high labour costs together with 
relatively low energy prices, potentially leading to a substitution away from labour to energy (arguments in 
favour of such substitution can be found in Bassilière et al., 2005). The relative prices reflect the high level 
of taxes on labour and low energy taxation (Figure 5), with excise rates for most fuels being at or close to 
EU minima, some even at zero rates. 5 Belgium also makes use of most of the exemptions to excise taxation 
available under EU law (HCF, 2009 and IEW, 2007) – for example, large users with an accord or permis 
environnemental face excise tax reductions on fuels up to 100% (HCF, 2009). 5. 
According to the Confederation Fiscal Europeen of the 14 main fuels listed by the EU, in Belgium 7 are 
subject to excise levies at minimum EU requirements and four have slightly higher values. For comparison, 
in France four fuels are taxed at minimum EU levels, while in Germany and the Netherlands none. ECO/WKP(2011)63 11 Figure 4. Emission intensity of industry is high¹ 0

Norway " . ECO/WKP(2011)63 12 The development of renewable energy sources is expensive A particular challenge that faces the Belgian economy, in terms of climate change targets, is the 
development of renewable energy. At the current state of technology, Belgium has limited natural 
advantages in terms of renewable energy: the marine territory is limited reducing the potential for off-shore 
windmills, while the largely flat landscape and moderate climate limit the potential for hydropower and 
solar energy. Furthermore, legal and regulatory problems, such as the fact that grid operators in Flanders 
regularly refuse to connect renewable energy producers and disputes on who should bear the connection 
costs, appear to raise entry costs to higher levels than in other countries (AEON, 2010). The result is one of 
the lowest shares of renewables in electricity production in the OECD, coming mainly from biomass, 
mostly imported from overseas. Pre-crisis simulations showed that the share of energy from renewable 
sources was to reach about 7.5% by 2020 -just above half of the Belgian target (Bossier et al., 2008). The 
effect of the crisis (lower overall energy consumption) and measures taken since 2008 should have a 
positive effect on the share of renewables, nevertheless, without further measures, it seems highly unlikely 
Belgium will meet its renewable targets. To encourage the production of electricity from renewable sources, the federal and regional 
governments have introduced green certificates (GC's, Table 2). In line with the division of environmental 
(and energy) responsibilities, the federal level is responsible for certificates concerning energy producers 
connected to the high voltage grid, while the regional certificates concern the low voltage grid. 6 Green 
certificates are issued to renewable energy producers by the relevant energy regulators. Each electricity 
grid operator is obliged to purchase all electricity from renewable producers at a market wholesale price. 
As the costs of renewable energy are generally higher than the wholesale market price, the green producers 
are compensated with gains from selling the GC's (either on the secondary GC market or to the grid 
operator directly for a minimum price). The grid operator also places the acquired certificates on the 
secondary market and can recuperate the difference between the cost of purchase of the GC's on the 
primary market and the secondary market price through distribution tariffs. On the secondary market, the 
GC's are purchased by the final electricity suppliers, each of which is obliged to acquire a certain 
minimum share of its electricity from renewable sources (in 2010 these were 2.8% in BCR, 6% in Flanders 
and 10% in Wallonia). This is done symbolically by acquiring a sufficient amount of GC's. The renewable policies are poorly co-ordinated across governments, resulting in five 
separate GC markets and making renewable policy unnecessarily expensive. The national programme 
(National Action Plan) for renewable energy is effectively a compilation of federal and regional 
programmes with little mention of intranational spillovers and coordination of the strategies on how to 
achieve the 2020 target. In practice, regions set their own objectives and use different tools to achieve 
them, choosing individually the winning technologies and disregarding the marginal abatement costs. In 
the absence of a price equalisation mechanism, market separation fails to exploit economies of scale and 
scope – regional GC's do not guarantee that investments in renewables are done where it is economically 
most viable (across the country), raising the costs of achieving the overall objective. The existence of five 
(relatively small) separate GC markets also raises administrative costs, and remains an international 
peculiarity; for instance Norway and Sweden are taking steps to create a common market. 7 6. 
The federal government certificates cover the grid above 70 kV. 7. 
The fifth separate market exists for combined heat and power production in Flanders. The separation is 
complete aside the agreement to accept Walloon GC's in Brussels on certain conditions. ECO/WKP(2011)63 13 Table 2. Various types of green certificates aim at encouraging renewable energy Prices in EUR per MWh, 2010 Federal state

decrease with the plant size. For hydro, wind and others the number of GC/MWh is 1. The system is currently under revision. 2. Reduced annually by EUR 20/MWh until 2013 and by EUR 40/MWh onwards.

scale production of renewable energy from the regional quotas and thus favours smaller, and likely less-
efficient, producers at the regional level. Indeed, when compared with the 55 EUR per MWh estimated 
increase in energy prices necessary to achieve the 2020 renewable targets (by making renewable energy 
economically viable), the regional GC's appear significantly overpriced, while the majority of the 
federal GC's are too cheap ( Bossier et al., 2008). 8 The former provide massive returns on low-risk 
investments in technologies with poor efficiency, 9 and have practically no effect on EU-wide 
CO 2 emissions (Box 1). The excessive prices may have negative environmental consequences, as by 
raising the final consumers' electricity bill they increase the incentives to switch to more polluting fossil 
fuels. Therefore, a common GC could be an efficient solution (De Serres et al., 2010). Mandatory minimum prices for certain renewable energy technologies mean that governments are 
heavily involved in picking winning technologies (particularly photovoltaic) and risk limiting the 
incentives to improve their efficiency. To avoid a bias to expensive sources, the single GC market should 
not be bound by minimum prices. Instead, the price of renewable energy, and consequently the 
development of the cheapest and most appropriate technologies, should be left to the market under the 
constraint of a credible national path for the mandatory minimum share of renewable energy. The 
reductions in GC's requirements for suppliers of large clients (currently in place in all regions) are 
effectively a subsidy to these clients, that is, to large energy consumers, and should be abolished. 8. 
Recalculated to 2010 prices, the scenario also requires a carbon price. 9. 
CREG (2010b) takes into account all implicit and explicit (federal and regional) government aid in 
Flanders – tax deductions, investment subsidies, and GC's to calculate the annual returns on equity of 55% 
for PV, over 100% for onshore wind and biomass and in excess of 1 000% for biomass co-combustion in 
existing coal plants. A similar study for Wallonia was not possible due to the lack of data. ECO/WKP(2011)63 14 Renewable energy is also encouraged through a number of investment subsidies and tax reductions. 
At the federal level, households can deduct up to 40% of their investment in renewable energy from 
income tax. Enterprises can deduct 13.5% of their investment in renewable energy from the taxable profits. 
The federal government also provides implicit subsidies to off-shore wind – through minimum prices on 
the GC market, connector cables, covering part of balancing costs and government-backed loans from the 
European Investment Bank (CREG, 2010a). The Flemish government provides investment subsidies to 
enterprises – 10-20% (to double in the future) of the additional costs of investments in renewables 10 
(Guisson and Marchal, 2008). Wallonia provides specific grants for small biomass and combined heat and 
power plants (IEA, 2010). A common, well-designed GC scheme and low market entry barriers would 
ensure the viability of investments in the most efficient renewable technologies across the country and 
improve incentives for R&D in this area. Transport is imposing an increasing burden on the environment The transport sector, as in most EU countries, has undergone the largest growth in emissions since 
1990 (Figure 6), reflecting increases in traffic volumes (among the highest in the EU15) only partly offset 
by better emission performance of vehicles. Particularly high growth of freight transport volumes mirrors 
increases in world trade as half of the freight traffic is international (Hertveldt et al., 2009). Passenger 
transport reflects intensive commuting, mostly by car with the use per capita among the highest in 
the OECD. Inland freight transport is mainly on roads, with an internationally high share of inland 
waterways. The road, motorway and rail networks are well developed and among the most dense in 
the OECD, but congestion is a frequent feature in bottleneck areas, in particular in the area of Brussels 
(among the most congested cities in Europe; Le Soir, 2010) and Antwerp. On current policies, emissions 
from transport are expected to continue growing over the next decade (Bossier et al., 2008). Figure 6. The share of emissions from transport and residential sectors has been increasing As a percentage of total GHG emissions,¹ 2008 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 10.0%

dominance of Belgian passenger cars (57%, second only to Luxembourg in the OECD, driving some 
70% of the vehicle-kilometres) and an important role of international transport. This results, to a large 
extent, from the relatively low taxation of diesel fuels (Figure 8), which is some 40% lower (excise 
taxation, per litre) than gasoline, despite its 15% higher carbon content and higher related emissions of 
other pollutants such as NO x and particulate matter. The two latter are a major problem, in particular in 
Brussels (Box 3). Furthermore, low diesel prices lead to a  " diesel illusion "  – one in four Belgians that opt 
for diesel do not drive enough to make this choice financially viable and would be better off buying a 
gasoline car (VAB, 2008). Figure 7. The role of diesel fuel is higher than elsewhere¹ Ratio of purchased diesel to gasoline,² 2008 0 1 2 3 4 5 0 1 2 3 4 5 ³

PM10), both largely due to the widespread use of diesel fuels in transport and heating. In the case of particulate matter, the agricultural 
sector is also an important emission source. As most EU countries, Belgium is likely to have met the 2010 EU targets for all pollutants 
apart from nitrogen oxides (NOx) but the margin by which the NOx target has been missed is among the highest (Figure 9). For 
particulate matter, excess concentration is among the most widespread among the EU15 with almost all the monitored zones 
exceeding the daily (though not the annual) limits. The problems are particularly acute in Brussels and Antwerp. Overall, the problems 
with complying with the EU's daily limit values for PM10 are likely to persist for many years to come (Fierens et al., 2006, Deutsch et 
al., 2010). ECO/WKP(2011)63 16 Box 3. Air pollution is linked to transport and household heating (cont'd) Figure 9.

In transport, the abatement of PMx and NOx -not directly linked to the quantity of fuel consumed -is largely pursued via 
EU emission norms for vehicles. Still, even the most recent EURO 5 emission norms for passenger cars permit three times higher 
NOx emissions for diesel than for gasoline cars, with particularly high freight emissions. Particulate matter norms are equalised for the 
two fuels in EURO 5, though in practice the emission of PMx from gasoline cars is negligible. Moreover, there remains a large stock of 
old vehicles, which do not comply with the stricter recent norms -it will take another 10 years till EURO 5 vehicles drive more than 
older cars (TML, 2006). Finally, since their introduction the EURO norms have not been effective in reducing NOx emissions per litre 
of fuels, in part as they concern emissions under very specific test-conditions, while in practice values can often be significantly higher 
and concern new cars while emission performance may deteriorate significantly over vehicle life (DEFRA, 2011). Figure 8. Fuel taxation favours diesel and LPG Percentage of taxes (excluding value added tax) in fuel prices, 2010 0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5

purchase subsidies for  " environmentally friendly "  vehicles. 11 Company cars provided by employers are 
strongly encouraged. Private use is treated as a lump sum in-kind benefit, with the taxable value between 
EUR 630 and EUR 2 400 per year depending on emission class. As a result, employers have been treating 
company cars as cheap non-wage compensation cost and the number of company cars is estimated at 22% 
of the passenger car fleet, of which a third are considered as in-kind benefits (Mossakowski, 2011). The 
cars are often provided with a so-called fuel card, a benefit which effectively facilitates the treatment of 
fuel expenditures as company costs. Over the past years, the federal government made steps to green the 
company car fleet by linking fiscal deductibility of the cars to their CO 2 emissions and, in 2010, reducing 
the deductibility of fuel cards to 75%. These measures should have positive environmental effects, but do 
not go far enough to repair the damage done by underpriced car use. The tax treatment of such in-kind 
benefits should be the same as of standard income. The federal government also encourages the purchase of low-emission vehicles through a tax rebate 
of 15% or 3% of the price for cars with CO 2 emissions below 105 g/km and 115 g/km respectively. 12 
Intended to green the car fleet, the bonus also encourages the purchase of small diesel cars aggravating the 
problem of NO x and particulate emissions in city centres, while its abatement cost is rather high -EUR 446 
and EUR 817 per tonne of CO 2 for the two categories respectively (HCF, 2009). In the Walloon region, the 
effects are amplified by an environmental bonus/malus system for car purchase. At the same time, car 
purchase and annual ownership taxes seem to be among the least discriminatory with respect to CO 2 across 
EU countries (see Braathen, 2011 for a comparison of Walloon numbers with other EU countries). All such 
subsidies have a high deadweight cost, as they are also given to people who would opt for a low-emission 
car anyway, a high fiscal cost (over EUR 200 million in 2010) and should be scrapped. The objective of 
greening transport should be pursued through marginal externality taxation of fuels, in particular a carbon 
tax (see below). 13 The federal government supports commuting through relatively complicated and generous commuting 
allowances which lower the marginal costs of travelling to work by all modes of transport (Table 3). 
Particular benefits concern public transport and collective transport and no distance limits are imposed on 
car travel. The system provides disincentives for moving closer to the workplace. Hence, the commuting 
allowance, particularly for road transport, should be either targeted to low-income workers, who otherwise 
risk falling out of the labour market, or replaced by a lump sum subsidy for such groups. 11. 
Ownership taxes (registration and annual road tax) are moderate relative to other EU countries. 
Registration and annual road tax are based related to the engine size and power (so-called fiscal power). 
Even for very polluting cars the registration tax falls with age. 12. 
The federal rebate is limited to EUR 4 500 per car. The total cost of the measure in 2010 was 
EUR 208 million (double that of 2009) – on average almost EUR 2 000 per car. Given the limited 
availability of cars with low emissions, a large share of the rebate may be pocketed by the producers 
(HCF, 2009). 13. 
To the extent there may be an overall case for encouraging the purchase of more fuel-efficient vehicles, as 
consumers may tend to undervalue the (far-in – the-future) fuel savings relative to purchase costs (OECD, 
2009b) – this can be done through purchase taxation (or registration fees) rather than subsidies. ECO/WKP(2011)63 18 Table 3. There is a wide range of allowances to support commuting¹ Lump sum benefits

a refund of bicycle costs. Employers can 
deduct 120% costs from CIT. 1. 
The employers and employees have to choose between the distance-based and the lump-sum allowances. Source: High Council of Finance (2009) and Federal Government. Public transport and bicycles are encouraged through tax benefits and other direct and indirect 
subsidies (reduced VAT, fuel tax exemption for public transport). The government refunds 20% of the 
commuting cost if the employer pays the rest. Despite this, only about 9% of Flemish and Walloon 
residents use public transport for commuting (the share is about 50% for Brussels residents), reflecting that 
public transport lacks flexibility to substitute the car on a wider basis (SPF Mobility, 2010). One factor 
may be that public bus transport is organised by a separate body in each of the regions and trains are the 
competence of a federal body, making co-ordination complicated. Moreover, at the regional level, land 
regulation issues and financing issues play a role, as for instance visible in the lagging setup of the regional 
express rail for Brussels. The limited ability of public transport to adapt to changes in demand, points to the need for flexibility 
and more competitive pressure. More co-ordination among the regional and local governments is a must 
and bus schedules and routes should be made more flexible to accommodate demand. Tendering of 
services, currently used to a limited extent in Flanders, should be encouraged. Operators should be able to 
propose new routes, and entry barriers need to be lowered, by guaranteeing access to infrastructure. Ticket 
prices should remain regulated, due to the limited scope for competition, but subsidies should be 
transparent and follow a clearly identified benefit (e.g. mobility, equity, urban reasons). The government 
wishing to impose obligations (e.g. free tickets for elderly) should pay the full cost directly. Finally, in 
order to green public transport by improving load factors, more flexibility should be coupled with exposing 
operators to price signals to encourage emission reductions – they should pay the full (external) costs of 
their activity (e.g. fuel taxes). ECO/WKP(2011)63 19 External costs can be internalised through fuel taxation and a congestion charge Fuel taxation is generally well below the external costs generated by road transport, encouraging the 
demand for transport and relatively high fuel consumption (McKinsey, 2009). As in most countries, fuel 
taxation is generally higher than most estimates of marginal environmental externalities generated by 
transport. However, the costs incurred by transport through fuel taxation are disproportionately large for 
gasoline powered passenger cars, compared to diesel powered cars and in particular freight vehicles. This 
is largely due to lower relative taxation of diesel, which is associated with external costs of a magnitude 
higher than gasoline, mainly due to NO x and PM x emissions. Moreover, if the non-environmental 
externalities, such as road wear and tear, accident costs and in particular congestion, are taken into account, 
fuel taxation appears too low, in particular for freight. Both of these arguments are strengthened in 
Belgium by the low taxation of diesel (see CE Delft, 2008, Koźluk, 2010, for international examples and 
Hertveldt et al., 2009, for a Belgian specific study). The arguments against higher fuel taxation are mainly 
related to competitiveness (of the freight sector and the port of Antwerp) and fiscal revenue leakage. Low 
taxation of diesel diminishes the incentives provided by the government subsidies for shifting freight from 
road to rail and inland waterways (IWW). At the same time, empirical analysis generally fails to find 
evidence of a significant effect of changes in fuel prices relative to neighbouring countries on fiscal 
revenues (Schmitz, 2011), though the importance of international traffic means that a substantial unilateral 
increase is sure to have some consequences. Nevertheless, the overall effects of higher fuel prices on fuel 
consumption are likely to be limited in the short to medium term – estimates show that a 1% increase in 
fuel prices would lead to about a 0.2-0.3% decrease in fuel demand (Schmitz, 2011). Long-term effects are 
likely to be higher as car owners switch to more fuel efficient vehicles (Goodwin et al., 2004). Fuel taxation should be adjusted in line with the marginal externalities – the users who emit pollutants 
should pay the marginal costs of their activity, so that they face the adequate incentives to reduce pollution. 
This means primarily increasing the relative taxation of the more polluting diesel, which should reduce the 
Belgian diesel bias, thereby lowering NO x and particulate emissions. Such a reform was recommended in 
the 2009 Survey, and the federal government made a step in this direction by increasing the excise on 
diesel in 2010. To boost the effectiveness of price-related measures, Belgium-specific price regulations 
should be scrapped: the price cap on automotive fuels, the automatic adjustment of excise taxes to 
accommodate large fuel price changes (inverse cliquet) and special refund of part of the excise tax for 
vans, buses, taxis and trucks (professional diesel). A particular externality of road transport is congestion. The estimates of the cost of congestion in 
Belgium range from 0.05% of GDP (Hoornaert et al., 2009) to 2% of GDP (INFRAS, 2004), largely 
concentrated in bottlenecks around Brussels and Antwerp. An efficient instrument to tackle this issue, in 
particular given the concentrated nature of congestion in Belgium, is a congestion charge for each 
kilometre driven in bottleneck areas and times (Fosgerau and Van Dender, 2010; Eliasson, 2010) or a 
simpler version such as city access charges (urban tolls) introduced in several cities in the OECD 
(e.g. London, Oslo, Stockholm). Such charges are well targeted to deal with local problems at a limited 
overall cost. A congestion charge is likely to be a viable solution to the traffic problems of Brussels, 
reducing queues, travel time and improving air quality, but its introduction encounters a major obstacle due 
to the regional division of powers in transport policies, as the outer ring road passes through Wallonia and 
Flanders. Road pricing can be a viable solution A more comprehensive, if ambitious, solution would be a nation-wide GPS-based road charge, such 
as the system recently proposed in the Netherlands (Koźluk, 2010). 14 Such a scheme should include a 14. 
In late 2009 the Dutch government (unsuccessfully) attempted to introduce a road pricing scheme to cover 
all roads and (almost) all vehicles, moving away from fixed vehicle taxation (registration and annual 
ownership taxes) to a user-pays system of charging road transport. A fixed vehicle-related per-kilometre ECO/WKP(2011)63 20 per-kilometre charge linked to the externalities generated by different categories of vehicles and a 
congestion surcharge in bottleneck areas. The system could bring about substantial reductions in 
GHG emissions from transport and air pollutants while limiting the negative impact on economic activity 
(for instance, contrary to fuel taxation road pricing does not discriminate between domestic transport 
services and transit transport, and does not encourage fuelling up abroad). If the externalities linked to fuel 
consumption (such as CO 2 ) would be embodied in fuel taxes, the per-kilometre prices could take care of 
the other externalities, in particular those linked to the driven distance (e.g. road wear and tear), 
discriminating by category of vehicle. The price-discrimination across categories would also improve the 
NO x and particulate emission performance (Box 3). It could first be rolled out for freight (as in Germany 
and Slovakia) and utility vehicles, as this is likely to be more politically feasible. For the same reason, road 
pricing in Belgium might first apply to company cars, and as the scheme gains more public acceptance, it 
can subsequently be extended to all traffic. In 2011, the three regions agreed on introducing a common GPS-based per-kilometre road charge for 
freight, though at the moment of writing details were not available. Such a system can only be efficient if 
introduced uniformly across the country, and even more so, if introduced across neighbouring countries. 
Moreover, when introduced for passenger transport, road pricing or congestion charges are likely to 
increase the demand for public transport, in particular in peak hours, raising the importance of making 
services more responsive to demand. Household energy efficiency is poor due to weak incentives 
The housing stock is poorly insulated (Table 4), contributing to household energy use (per square 
metre) 70% above the EU average (twice that in the neighbouring Netherlands) and residential emissions 
per capita twice the OECD average (Table 5 and McKinsey, 2009). A third of the housing stock pre-dates 
1945 (particularly in Brussels and Wallonia) and heating systems tend to be old (HCF, 2009). Non-
compliance with building norms means that the problems are not limited to old buildings (OECD, 2007a). 
Given the relatively high prices of electricity (Koźluk, 2009), the main source of household heating is 
natural gas. Heating oil, roughly a third more emission-intensive than gas (CO 2 per GJ), plays an important 
role (half of the energy use in Wallonia, a third in Flanders and Brussels). Table 4. House insulation is poor across regions As a percentage of total Double-glazed

due to the widespread use of social energy policies (Box 4) and, to a smaller extent, employer-provided 
in-kind benefits. As lower energy tariffs discourage energy saving, they should be scrapped, while social 
objectives should be pursued through social policies, such as a lump-sum income subsidy targeted at low-
income households, coupled with measures to increase the accessibility of energy-efficiency investments 
for such groups (see below). Another group not directly exposed to energy prices are those subject to the 
in-kind benefit, whereby the employer pays the electricity and heating bills. Such benefits are taxed as a 
lump-sum, regardless of the actual amount, 15 making them a cheap non-wage benefit. These benefits have 
negative environmental effects as concerned households face zero marginal costs of energy and are more 
likely to benefit higher income groups. Such benefits should be taxed as any other wage income. Box 4. Social energy policies and the incentives for saving energy Heating affordability for low-income households is guaranteed through the Social Heating Fund – a lump sum subsidy of 
up to EUR 300 per year (heating oil and natural gas bill). In addition, there is the so-called social energy (electricity and gas) 
tariff, equal to the lowest commercial (i.e. industry) tariff in the area and available to almost 7% (electricity) and over 5% (gas) 
of households. Since 2009, the attribution of social tariffs became automatic. Households eligible for social tariffs are also 
exempt from the federal surcharge on energy and face a price that can be well below half of the market tariff, hence providing 
much lower marginal incentives to save energy. The reduced VAT rate (12%) on coal for households can also be regarded as a social policy, given that low-income 
households are the most likely to be heated with coal. Despite a large decrease, coal still heats some 2% of households in 
Flanders, and the lower VAT effectively decreases the incentives to change to alternative fuels. In Flanders, all households are eligible for a free electricity quota for each household member. This may further 
decrease the saving incentive for households eligible for social tariffs (by reducing the total energy bill), but the effect on other 
households is unclear. The free quota has to be incorporated into retailers' pricing strategies and hence forces a higher tariff 
on the remaining consumption – potentially increasing the incentive to save. 15. 
The employer pays the annual bills, and the employees are taxes as if they received a lump sum income of 
EUR 370 in case of electricity, EUR 740 for heating. In case of management personnel the amount subject 
to taxation is twice as high. This amount has been increasing fairly rapidly in the recent years. ECO/WKP(2011)63 22 To counter the weak energy saving incentives and promote energy efficiency, the governments have 
stepped up measures to directly encourage investment in improvement of housing. The federal government 
offers numerous tax reductions (e.g. for the replacement or improvement of boilers, windows, insulation of 
roofs, walls and ceilings, energy-saving devices, installation of heat pumps, solar heaters and solar panels) 
of up to EUR 2 650 per household per year (40% of expenses). The regions top these up by a multitude of 
subsidies: 22 in Wallonia (down from 48 in 2009), 20 in Brussels and 18 in Flanders, some of which are 
decided upon an annual basis. The focus on energy efficiency improvements is commendable, in particular given the 
20/20/20 objectives, but the actual outcomes are rather disappointing (HCF, 2009). One reason is that 
government measures tend to pick  " winning "  technologies, disregarding the relative cost efficiency and 
despite the explicit advice from government-financed energy audits of households. The lowest subsidies 
are provided for measures most efficient in energy saving: roof, wall and ground insulation, window 
replacement (Renard,2008 and De Coninck and Verbeeck, 2006). A simple calculation based on 2008 data 
shows that due to federal and regional fiscal incentives, a Walloon homeowner would choose to install 
photovoltaic panels (PV) over wall insulation, where the latter would be six times more cost-efficient in 
reducing CO 2 (Spies and Buxant, 2008). The cost of CO 2 avoidance for the taxpayer would be EUR 23 per 
tonne in the case of wall insulation, but EUR 1 600 for PV, with similar outcomes in the other regions. 
Notably, the situation in Wallonia itself has improved somewhat, due to the reforms of Walloon measures, 
including scrapping of some of the regional subsidies to PV The strong public support for PV resulted in 
increasing take up in 2010, but is questionable given the climate conditions and no cost/benefit assessment 
of the policies (IEA, 2010). Similarly, fiscal incentives support both the replacement of old boilers as well 
as their maintenance. Most old boilers are subject to quasi-mandatory replacement (because of government 
or insurance norms), implying an effective subsidy to comply. 16 Finally, many existing subsidies concern 
also new housing, where measures could be implemented more effectively through stricter building 
standards. The incentives for insulation are more complicated for rented housing, which constitutes roughly a 
quarter of Belgian housing. Tenants are likely to be less willing to invest in energy improvements of their 
housing, not being able to reclaim the full benefits from the investment. Similarly, owners of rented 
property have limited possibility to recuperate the cost of the investment because of rent regulation. In 
principle, rent regulation foresees a phased-in increase of the rent due to an increase in property value (for 
instance due to an investment in energy efficiency). Still, the quality and energy efficiency of rented 
property remains rather poor, and a reviewing rent regulation in this respect, to introduce stronger 
incentives, should be considered. 17 Price signals provide the most straightforward incentives, while awareness could be improved, The importance of nuclear energy in providing base load electricity capacity means that base load is 
relatively CO 2 -free compared with gas-and coal-powered peak load. This distinction may not be 
straightforward in a unified EU energy market, but due to capacity constraints on the Belgian international 
connection grid, it is possible to assume that peak load is largely supplied by local producers. Hence, the 16. 
HCF also noted that given the very limited competition in many of the subsidised areas (e.g. energy audits, 
installation of equipment) suppliers are likely to take over a large part of the subsidy – reducing the effect 
on households' behaviour. Moreover, the division of powers obstructs the flow of these services -licenses 
for installation of facilities (e.g. PV) and audits issued in one region are not recognised in the other. 17. 
For example in Wallonia, 70% of owner occupied housing and only 50% of rented housing is classified as 
good or very good standard (Carlier et al., 2007). ECO/WKP(2011)63 23 governments also aim at smoothing electricity consumption, particularly through the 24-hour day. This can 
be done by encouraging meters with day/night tariff readings or the more costly so-called smart meters 
with real time readings. The Flemish government is planning smart metering by 2018, while tests are 
underway in Wallonia. As emphasised, such measures will not affect CO 2 emissions in the EU, as long as 
the ETS cap remains unchanged (Box 1). Households' energy efficiency awareness is poor. The data for Brussels reveals that many households 
are unaware of the state of insulation of their houses and thus is unlikely to take up subsidies (of which 
many households have not heard) or in general to improve the energy efficiency of housing (Table 4). 18 
The rental and secondary markets are also likely to suffer from the asymmetry of information, if the 
owners do not reveal the energy efficiency of houses put on the market. The governments have recently 
taken steps to reduce asymmetry by increasing energy awareness by making energy certificates (PEB) an 
obligatory document for the placement of houses on the market. Other measures include labelling of 
products (e.g. domestic appliances) but arguably, households' incentives would increase with the energy 
price. Overall, the existing subsidies for energy saving should be scrapped and the incentives should be 
provided through energy prices. Government policies should focus on fixing market failures in the areas 
where efficiency can be improved in economically viable ways: @BULLET Internalising the costs of externalities associated with energy use into the prices (through an 
externality tax, such as a carbon tax on heating fuels). @BULLET Reducing uncertainty for investments which are likely to break-even in years, by providing 
credible paths for externality taxation. @BULLET Supporting liquidity constrained low-income households to make such investments, (through 
targeted investment subsidies or cheap loans) to exploit relatively cheap abatement possibilities, 
as low-income households are likely to live in poorly insulated housing. In this line, the federal 
government has recently set aside funds to promote third-party financing and cheap loans for 
energy efficiency improvements of low-income households (FRCE/FRGE), while the regions are 
providing cheap loans. @BULLET Improving energy-efficiency awareness. 
@BULLET Enforcing minimum building standards for new housing. Notably, a number of the measures proposed above will also encourage more cost-efficient abatement 
in the remainder of the non-ETS segment: small industry, services and agriculture. Purchasing emission rights abroad may slow adjustment to a less carbon-intensive economy The national burden-sharing agreement foresees that the federal government offsets emissions 
purchasing carbon credits through Kyoto flexible mechanisms (Table 1). Almost half of the overall amount 
of carbon credits for 2008-12 has already been delivered by mid-2011 (of which a third through emission 
rights purchases and two-thirds through projects reducing CO 2 emissions in developing countries). The 
carbon prices paid are confidential. As mentioned, regions can also use flexible mechanisms. Such 
investments are a viable Kyoto tool that encourages emission reductions in developing countries, where 
they are likely to be cheaper. However, there is a risk that the strategy may be short-sighted. Such 18. 
Part of is be due to Brussels-specific reasons – an urban character of housing (more blocks of flats), more 
rented housing and more social tariff benefiters. Data for Flanders show that just above half of survey 
respondents heard of the federal tax reductions, most of them in the higher income groups (Cour des 
Comptes, 2009). ECO/WKP(2011)63 24 purchases are financed through the federal surcharge on energy which is subject to a reduction for large 
users, effectively shielding large emitters from external costs at the expense of small users. The result is 
reduced incentives for restructuring towards a less polluting technology mix and  " green "  R&D, which may 
delay the necessary adjustment to a less carbon intensive economy. Polluters must face the marginal cost of damages to ensure cost-efficient abatement Environmental taxation is used far less than in other OECD countries (Figure 10). Fossil fuels taxes 
are among the lowest in Europe (Table 6) resulting in a very low implicit CO 2 prices (Table 7) and a higher 
than optimal use of fuels, likely skewing the production mix from labour to energy and dampening 
incentives for energy-saving and environmentally friendly R&D. Only taxation in the category 
pollution/resources (for instance land-fill taxes and packaging waste, Box 5) is above that in most 
EU countries. Figure 10. Environmentally-related tax revenue 2009 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 % of GDP

Eco-taxes – limited environmental effect so far The eco-tax law (1993) introduced product taxes to discourage consumption of certain (environmentally 
harmful) goods by encouraging a switch to less harmful substitutes; hence in principle the taxes were to yield 
minimal revenues. The law included a first list of products subject to eco-taxation while further decisions were 
left to a committee of experts established for this purpose. The proposed products were drink containers, some 
types of industrial packaging, some disposable products (disposable razors till 1997 and cameras), batteries, 
pesticides (abolished in 2001) and paper. Most products would be exempt if a collection and recycling scheme 
was organised. The main problems with these eco-taxes concern industry opposition to placing individual products on the 
list, the lack of transparency and clarity of the motivation and the exclusion of major users of pesticides 
(agriculture) from taxation. As a result, the goods subject to eco-taxes were mainly marginal yielding doubtful 
environmental gains. Few products added to the list in due course: disposable plastic crockery, plastic bags, and 
containers of ink, glue and solvent for professional use. The revenue from the eco-taxes is indeed negligible 
(EUR 0.2 million in 2010) aside the tax on drink containers (EUR 200 million). A country-wide carbon tax would reduce emissions and improve energy efficiency Increasing the overall taxation of energy should bring about a cost-efficient reduction in emissions. 
Well-designed energy taxation would entail pricing the associated emissions (or generally, pollution), 
thereby giving polluters the appropriate and straightforward incentives to reduce harmful activity in a 
cost-effective way (Box 6). This should be achieved by realigning excise taxes and introducing a carbon 
tax on fuels. Current excise taxes on fuels have no relation to the environmental externalities – the implicit 
carbon prices differ vastly among fuels and among different uses of the same fuel (Table 7). Greater ECO/WKP(2011)63 26 neutrality should be introduced if the associated externalities do not differ too widely (there may be a 
special case for transport fuels, see above). To ensure efficient abatement at minimum cost marginal 
externalities should be built into prices. In particular, GHG externalities should be addressed with a carbon 
price. As the ETS segment of the economy is de facto subject to a carbon price, a carbon tax should be 
introduced for the non-ETS segment of the economy (primarily transport and housing, but also small 
industry, services and agriculture), particularly as this is where emissions have been increasing over the 
past two decades. 19 Given the high uncertainty about the optimal carbon price, the level of the carbon tax 
should be chosen with the aim of achieving the Belgian GHG 20/20/20 objective. 20 In this light, the 
government should establish a clear, credible timetable for the carbon tax (with some adjustment 
possibilities) in order to provide sufficient incentives to invest in greener technologies and R&D, as such 
investment is likely to break-even only over a long time frame. The new carbon tax may need to be 
adjusted to respect to EU guidelines, given recent EU Commission's proposals regarding changes in 
energy taxations (EC, 2011). Box 6. Cost-efficient  " green "  policies – polluters should face the marginal cost of externalities  " Green-growth "  policies should aim at overcoming the market failures arising from: the environment being a 
public good; the costs of monitoring and enforcement; imperfect or asymmetric information; and capital market 
imperfections (De Serres et al., 2010, Duval, 2008). The main principles for choosing instruments to reach climate 
change and environmental goals entail: @BULLET equalising the marginal abatement cost across emission sources to ensure lowest-cost abatement; 
@BULLET fostering an efficient level of innovation, in order to lower future abatement costs; 
@BULLET coping effectively with future risks and uncertainties. Putting a price on the pollution source or over-exploitation of a scarce resource should improve the competitive 
position of clean(er) technologies and goods and incentives to invest into green R&D as the costs of pollution will be 
integrated in the final prices. Pricing externalities can be done, for example, through a cap-and-trade scheme or a 
polluter-pays (marginal) externality tax. In the presence of high monitoring and information costs, in particular when 
emission sources are small and numerous (such as in transport or residential heating), the taxation of proxies (i.e. 
fuels) can be a viable solution, conditional on a sufficiently robust link with the externality. Externality taxation usually meets opposition on competitiveness grounds and, in the case of 
GHG emissions, because of the fear of carbon leakage. However, there is no obvious relation between 
environmental tax revenues and competitiveness (HCF, 2009) in particular within a co-ordinated 
EU approach. The ETS segment will face a carbon price by default, while the rest of the economy (mainly 
transport and residential) is less directly exposed to international competition. As all EU countries 
introduce measures to fulfil the 20/20/20 objectives, they impose a carbon price, explicit or implicit. The 
wider the coverage of a uniform carbon price, the more likely that emissions are reduced at the lowest cost. 
Carbon taxation will burden particularly heavy emission sources, but indeed this is the point of reorienting 
the economy to a greener path. A balance, though, must be found between a gradual introduction, which 19. 
During 1990-2009, Belgian non-ETS GHG emissions grew by 2.5%, while ETS emissions fell by 21%. 20. 
Establishing an optimal carbon price is subject to the enormous uncertainty surrounding the economic 
effects of GHG emissions and climate change, to materialize decades and centuries ahead. Meta-analyses 
show a vast range of estimates – a mean price of a tonne of CO 2 from a survey of 232 estimates is around 
EUR 60 (2010 prices) and the median around EUR 30, with extreme values not being uncommon (Tol, 
2009, Kuik et al, 2009). Simulations performed for Belgium show that achieving 2020 goals would require 
a carbon price of EUR 37 per tonne in the ETS segment and EUR 28 per tonne in the non-ETS segment 
(Bassiliere et al., 2008, adjusted to 2010 prices). ECO/WKP(2011)63 27 gives polluters time for less abrupt adjustment, and an excessively long phase-in which would punish 
cleaner technologies and risk the failure of meeting international obligations. At the moment, practically all Belgian ETS emission permits are grandfathered (granted for free based 
on historical emissions) providing windfall profits to heavy polluters. This should not prevent an efficient 
allocation of emission rights, as rights are tradable. However, it does imply transfers from energy 
consumers to producers. Moreover, empirical evidence show producers passing on the opportunity costs of 
holding CO 2 permits (obtained for free) to the wholesale price in most EU countries (Sijm et al., 2008) and 
in particular in Belgium (CREG, 2008) where estimated windfall gains for electricity producers are in the 
area of ½ per cent of GDP for 2005-07. Increasing the scope of auctioning would reduce windfall gains, 
yield revenue and improve the governments' experience in the auctioning system, but for the next few 
years the effects will remain minute under EU limits on auctioning. In this case, the federal government 
should consider fully taxing away the windfall profit gained from grandfathering of permits. 21 A carbon tax would also encourage energy efficiency – currently promoted through tax reductions for 
industry, voluntary agreements and requirements on utility suppliers. The federal government grants higher 
corporate income tax deductions for energy-efficiency and green investments, while the regions revert to 
voluntary agreements. Flanders and Wallonia have signed agreements with enterprises covering over 90% 
of emissions, rewarding participants with tax benefits (such as exemptions from the federal excise tax on 
fossil fuels), exemptions from selected regulatory requirements and financial aid. Electricity suppliers have 
a public service obligation of saving energy (IEA, 2010) under which they are to achieve annual reductions 
in final consumers' energy use under the threat of a fine (Flanders and Brussels) or in return for a premium 
(Wallonia). None of the measures seem a first best solution in a national context: tax breaks (CIT and 
excise) come at a high fiscal cost, while voluntary agreements are generally unlikely to be very effective in 
reducing emissions (De Serres et al., 2010) in particular if lower energy prices are granted in return. 
Moreover, such measures may have undesirable effects on emissions if electricity (and gas) is substituted 
with e.g. heating oil. Appropriate energy saving incentives should come from a national carbon tax. Revenues from environmental taxation could be used to lower taxes on labour The revenues from environmental taxation can be used to reduce more growth-distorting taxation, 
such as on labour, aiding the transition from an energy-intensive economy and potentially preserving the 
competitiveness of Belgian companies (see for example Bassilière et al., 2009). A well-designed shift in 
the taxation burden from labour to energy would be likely to increase employment (Bassilière et al., 2005 
and 2009) but admittedly, with automatic wage indexation (OECD, 2011a), this effect may be limited if the 
higher prices (due to environmental taxation, though potentially offset by lower labour costs) are translated 
into wage increases. Simple static calculations show that revenues equal to 10-15% of labour taxation 
could be obtained from a combination of: increasing environmental taxation to the EU average level; a 
carbon tax (non-ETS segment); and taxing away of windfall gains from free permits (ETS) and scrapping 
subsidies and tax reductions for transport, energy prices and energy-efficiency investments. Concerns 
about the regressive nature of environmental taxes (poorer households tend to have a higher share of 
energy in the consumption basket) could be addressed by focusing the reductions in labour taxation on the 
lower end of the income distribution. Still, many of the existing measures (in-kind benefits such as 
company cars, fuel cards, energy bills; energy efficiency subsidies) benefit mostly higher-income 
households; hence their scrapping could increase the progressivity of fiscal policies (HCF, 2009). Finally, 21. 
One of the concerns with electricity producers paying the price of CO 2 emissions is that wholesale 
electricity prices are set reflecting the marginal price of the most expensive production site operating. The 
carbon price increases this marginal price and thus creates a windfall gain for nuclear producers. In 
principle, (part of) this profit can be taxed away, but in practice not for imported energy. ECO/WKP(2011)63 28 higher revenues could also allow for more spending to improve the poor state of nature preservation 
(Box 7). Box 7. Environmental protection is costly, but should play a more important role The strong pressure on the environment comes from dense population, intensive industry, agriculture and 
transport. Land use reflects the high population density – residential and commercial services take up 19% of land use, 
second in the EU and two-and-a-half times the EU average. Industry and transport use 6% of land area, twice the 
EU average. Agriculture takes up 53%, leaving little space for nature. Despite progress in the recent years, Belgium is 
the OECD country with the lowest surface of protected environmental areas per capita, and among the lowest in terms 
of protected areas relative to total surface (the first and so far only national park of 57 square km was opened in 
Flanders in 2006). The level of protection of these areas is generally lower than elsewhere. Together with years of 
extremely poor surface water quality this has contributed to a situation where the share of threatened species among 
indigenous fauna and flora are well above that in most OECD countries. The heavy implicit and explicit subsidies to 
agriculture and land use policies have placed Belgium among the handful of OECD countries where the share of forest 
land has not grown since 1990, reflecting in part poor take-up of EU agricultural land forestation programmes 
(OECD, 2007a). Source: OECD Environmental Data Compendium, World Database on Protected Areas, UN Millennium Development Goal Indicators. Improvements in the area of water quality are visible, but suffer from a large backlog Significant attention was devoted to water quality in a previous environmental chapter (OECD, 2001), 
in part as the exploitation of water resources is among the most intensive in the EU. At the time, both 
surface and underground water quality were among the poorest in the EU, due to the effective lack of 
treatment of urban wastewater and very intensive agriculture. Brussels, with roughly 1 million inhabitants, 
dumped its urban sewage directly to the Senne river. Since then, government efforts have reduced the 
backlog in urban wastewater treatment. In 2001 the first treatment plant for Brussels, treating a third of its 
sewage, was put in place. The unsatisfactory situation of the mid-2000s (Figure 11) has improved 
significantly and by 2010 the number of agglomerations with insufficient treatment was reduced to 1 in 
Flanders and halved to 30 in Wallonia. 22 A large part of the success in Flanders was due to large regional 
subsidies to municipalities and a special-purpose public private partnership (OECD, 2007c). In 2009, a 
second treatment plant for Brussels was operational, ensuring that the majority of households in the area is 
connected to treatment. Nevertheless, by 2010, Belgium still had not implemented the urban wastewater 
treatment directive, for which it is to be fined. 23 Full compliance is not expected before 2013. 22. 
The assessment is done by the European Commission in light of the 1991 Urban Wastewater Treatment 
Directive. Under the legislation, all urban waste water generated by agglomerations of over 
10 000 inhabitants should be collected and treated before being discharged. Belgium has designated its 
entire national territory as a  " sensitive area " , the treatment must be more stringent to significantly reduce 
phosphorous and nitrate levels in waters before they are discharged. 23. 
In June 2010 the Commission has asked the Court to impose a lump-sum fine of more than € 15 million 
and a daily penalty payment of nearly € 62 000. ECO/WKP(2011)63 29 Figure 11. The share of population connected to wastewater treatment is low As a percentage of national population,¹ 2009 or latest available 0 20 40 60 80 100 0 20 40 60 80 100 ³ MEX

under the terms of international law. Source: OECD, Environment Database. Water quality remains poor, with the EU water framework directive not being implemented due to 
gaps in the harmonisation of definitions (among regions), in monitoring and in measures taken. Less than a 
fifth of surface waters were classified as not at risk of fulfilling EU ( " good status " ) targets for 2015, one of 
the poorest performances of the EU15 (EC, 2007 and EEB, 2010). National classifications for 2007-09 
show very poor surface and ground water quality, particularly in Flanders (UNECE, 2010). After an 
improvement in the early 2000s, non-costal bathing water quality returned to poor levels with 13% of areas 
nationwide (primarily in the south of the country) below minimum standards and monitoring problems 
(EEA, 2009). The regional division of powers may complicate the conduct of effective water policies, given that the 
two main river basins do not follow regional borders. While the Belgian governments are co-operating 
within international basin bodies, internal co-ordination failure is particularly visible in the Scheldt basin, 
the recipient of Brussels wastewater (EEB, 2010). Hence, there is a need for either a national body or inter-
regional bodies responsible for river basins to be created in order to ensure cross-border co-ordination and 
facilitate international co-operation. Such a reform would be in line with the requirements of the EU Water 
directive, which stipulates basin-based river management, but would avoid bureaucratic complications 
arising from separate river-basin authorities in each of the regions. Water provision (and sanitation) is a municipality responsibility which is usually delegated to inter-
municipal organisations. Currently, all three regions have different water pricing schemes, with a free 
quota in Flanders and cheap quotas in the two other regions. All three pricing strategies are based on a 
fixed fee and a variable per-cubic-metre price aimed at reflecting costs of distribution, capital and 
wastewater treatment. The variable price is lower for large users in all three regions. Given the persistent ECO/WKP(2011)63 30 problems with assuring adequate treatment, it is likely that the incentives for private investors to provide 
the services are insufficient. This can be improved by reviewing the charges for treatment to ensure 
polluters pay for the marginal generated externality in the case of (large) enterprises (basing the charge on 
pollution content of the discharge, as currently done in Flanders). For households, where monitoring and 
enforcement are likely to be costly, but the pollution load relatively uniform, wastewater treatment charges 
should remain incorporated in the water price, but transferred directly to the treatment provider (which is 
already the case in Flanders) rather than to the general regional budget. Overall this may result in 
increasing the tariff-financing of wastewater collection and treatment infrastructure. Finally, more 
competitive forces in treatment provision should be encouraged by lower barriers to entry and wider public 
tendering of contracts. Agriculture is a major source of water pollution Belgian agriculture is among the most intensive in the OECD, with particularly intensive animal 
husbandry and pesticide and synthetic fertiliser use having a negative impact on water quality. Despite 
being a heavy polluter, the sector benefits from extensive subsidies and preferential tax treatment, to a 
higher degree than in many OECD countries (OECD, 2010). In particular, federal subsidies aimed at 
increasing the reliance on bio-fuels (in line with the 20/20/20 goals) come at a high abatement costs (per 
tonne of CO 2 ): EUR 200 in the case of biofuels and EUR 600-800 in the case of ethanol (with extreme 
cases of up to EUR 2 000-4 400, Kutas et al., 2007). A more efficient strategy would be to impose a strict 
mandatory share of biofuels in the fuel mix, similarly as in the GC market, and allow the market to 
establish the price of individual biofuels. The sector is also fully exempt from excise taxation on fuels and 
road and motor vehicle taxation, hence is exposed to lower incentives in terms of GHG reduction targets. 24 In the area of water pollution, to combat phosphorus and nitrogen pollution from fertilisers regional 
manure management systems introduced over the past decade and have led to substantial improvement 
(Gybels et al., 2009). Additional benefits could be gained from a common system across the country, 
particularly if, as has been proposed in Flanders, a system of tradable manure rights is introduced. In this 
respect, a uniform, country-wide balancing system, with farm-level nutrient (nitrogen and phosphorus) 
accounts and quotas, could prove an effective way to curb excessive manure and use of synthetic fertiliser. 
Nutrient surplus above the quota would be subject to taxation. A system of this type is in place in Denmark 
(OECD, 2007b). Finally, excessive pesticide use should be curbed through an externality tax. In the 1990s, 
the eco-tax on pesticides in place in the 1990s, exempted the agricultural sector. This was replaced by a 
federal tax on pesticides, linked to pollution content (by category), which can be considered a step in the 
right direction, and by stricter command and control regulation, with some visible shifts to less polluting 
pesticide. However, the pesticide tax is several times lower for professional users (that is the bulk of users) 
and generally fairly low, in part due to cross-border leakage considerations. 25 As the effectiveness of a 
sales tax on pesticide may be mitigated by cross-border trade due to the small country size, it would ideally 
be co-ordinated with neighbouring countries. If this is not possible, taxing the use of pesticide (rather than 
purchase) should be considered. Environmental tools and policies should be co-ordinated and realigned As mentioned throughout the paper, the division of environment-related powers and responsibilities in 
Belgium is complex and fragmented. The three regions have a large share of responsibilities concerning 
environmental policies and directly related areas: agriculture, economic policy, energy, transport and R&D 24. 
Nevertheless, the majority of agricultural GHG emissions take the form of methane (from enteric 
fermentation and manure management) and nitric oxide (soil and manure management). 25. 
A reason sometimes cited to back a higher tax for non-professionals is the fact that they may use pesticides 
in a more harmful way (e.g. due to poor awareness). ECO/WKP(2011)63 31 (Table 8). Health care policy, where many of the consequences of environmental developments eventually 
occur, is largely federal, though shared with the (language) communities, which also deal with 
(environmental) education. The federal level has most taxation powers. Each government has sovereign 
powers in its area of decisions there are no mandatory co-ordination or binding crisis-resolution 
instruments, implying the need for intensive co-operation and consultation. A vast number of bodies have 
been formed for this purpose, such as the National Climate Commission in climate change and the 
CONCERE/ENOVER in energy. Moreover, as in other member states, a significant share of 
environmental, agricultural and economic aspects is dealt with at the EU level. Table 8. Division of responsibilities in environmental and related policies is complicated Federal level

level or potentially even the municipality level, given the better ability to adjust policies to the local needs. 
However, climate change and pollution do not respect borders, and therefore the current set-up increases 
the burden of environmental policies and reduces their effectiveness, thereby making Belgians poorer 
overall: ECO/WKP(2011)63 32 @BULLET The bodies responsible for environmental policies do not have the powers to use the most cost-
efficient tools. The regions lack of taxation power, prevents widespread use of externality 
taxation. Instead regions revert to more costly and less effective subsidy measures, which often 
reduce R&D incentives by choosing winning technologies (De Serres et al., 2010). The result – a 
multitude of instruments often leading to disappointing results, such as in energy efficiency 
investments in housing. @BULLET The administrative borders inhibit the implementation of efficient nationwide policies. In areas 
such as water policies, air pollution management or transport policies, regional borders are 
unlikely optimal boundaries. @BULLET Smaller markets prevent the exploitation of the economies of scale and scope in environmental 
policies, as visible for instance in the existence of (five) separate regional markets for green 
power certificates, hindering cost-equalisation of renewable energy use across the country. The division of environment-related responsibilities in a federation has been reviewed in a general 
context in the previous Survey (OECD, 2009a). As a conclusion: i) an appropriate division of powers 
should follow the division of responsibilities so that each government body can fulfil its tasks optimally; 
and ii) in areas where significant economies of scale or scope can be reaped, at the minimum close and 
swift co-operation should be ensured and moving competencies to the national level could be beneficial. 
An example of such nation-wide co-operation can be found in case of waste-management (batteries) where 
a single national entity takes care of collection and recycling (OECD, 2007a). More rigour in planning and decision-making could facilitate choosing the optimal solutions for 
reaching environmental goals. According to a review of federal climate change policies, the lack of proper 
evaluation of the costs and effects of (federal) measures means that decisions have little to do with 
economic reasoning (Cour des Comptes, 2009). Independent critical evaluations of regional environmental 
policies and the interaction with policies at different levels are hardly available. In order to introduce more 
economic rationale into environmental policy design, comparable cost benefit analysis (CBA) of all 
important environment-related policies (and major investments above a certain threshold) should become 
mandatory. 26 The independent analysis should apply national guidelines on parameters and methodology 
and include the evaluation and assignment of monetary values to environmental effects, for example on 
human health. Decisions to deviate from the CBA conclusions should be necessarily publicly explained. 
Ex post analysis should follow up on existing and future projects and policies to provide feedback for 
improvement of the CBA tool itself. 26. 
At the moment cost benefit analysis (CBA) is generally done at the regional level for investment major 
projects (as this is where they usually occur). Environmental Impact Assessment, an EU requirement, is 
less analytically rigorous and concerns only environmental impact. ECO/WKP(2011)63 33 Box 8. How to achieve greener growth in the Belgian federation Reduce greenhouse gas emissions and air pollutants in a cost-efficient manner @BULLET Introduce a carbon tax for the sectors not subject to the EU Emission Trading Scheme (part of industry, transport, housing and services). The level of the tax should be in line with emission reduction commitments. Speed up the introduction of 
auctioning of the ETS permits and consider taxing away windfall gains arising from the grandfathering of permits. Scrap 
measures that discourage energy savings (such as exemptions and reductions for large users). @BULLET Unify green certificates (GC's) across the country to replace the five currently existing, to benefit from the economies of scale and scope and ensure that renewable energy is developed where it is most viable. Consider scrapping the 
minimum prices for various types of renewable energy in order not to promote inefficient technologies and allow the 
market (under the GC scheme) to decide the price and mix of renewable energy. @BULLET Encourage investment in renewable energy by removing regulatory obstacles and publishing credible paths for the minimum requirements in the energy mix. Consider pursuing the targets for biofuels in a similar system. @BULLET Realign excise taxes on fuels with environmental marginal externalities. Take steps towards more uniform taxation of different uses of the same fuels. Increase the relative taxation of diesel with respect to gasoline to reduce the diesel bias 
and the associated environmental externalities. Scrap the reimbursement of part of the diesel price for professional use. @BULLET Implement country-wide road pricing for freight. Link distance-based user charges to associate externalities, including pollution (by class of vehicle). Extend the scheme to company cars, and eventually including passenger cars. The 
scheme would benefit from co-ordination with neighbouring countries. Consider congestion charges, particularly around 
Brussels, either independently or as part of road pricing. @BULLET Phase out the numerous subsidies to private transport in order not to encourage moving away from the workplace or the excessive use of cars. The commuting allowance, particularly for road transport, should be focused on persons otherwise 
at risk of dropping out of the job market, and could take the form of a lump-sum allowance. @BULLET Increase the flexibility and demand-responsiveness of public transport to increase its attractiveness through better co-ordination among regions and the federal train system, lower entry barriers, public tendering and the possibility for 
operators to propose new routes. @BULLET Drastically reduce the numerous subsidies for energy efficiency investment in housing and for industry. At the least, make sure that measures at different levels of government are co-ordinated in order to reach targets. Focus measures on 
liquidity constrained low-income households. Improve the energy efficiency awareness among households. @BULLET Phase out the social energy tariffs and VAT reductions in order to expose households to the same marginal energy saving incentives. Replace these with income subsidies for low income households. Improve water quality @BULLET Delegate responsibilities for water policies to an independent national authority or river-basin authorities. @BULLET Review wastewater treatment charges to ensure polluters pay the full marginal costs of environmental externalities. Encourage more competitive provision of wastewater treatment. @BULLET Introduce a pollution-content based pesticide tax on sales or application. Consider a country-wide manure and synthetic fertiliser management scheme, with balancing farm-level accounts and quotas for nutrients. The organisation of environmental policies needs to promote cost-efficiency @BULLET Increase the reliance on taxation of environmental externalities (rather than subsidies or command and control measures) to implement environmental policies. @BULLET Reconsider the division of environmental responsibilities and powers in the federation with an aim of assuring: that the responsible bodies have the most cost-efficient tools to achieve their goals (e.g. taxation powers); and the exploitation of 
the economies of scale and scope (e.g. in renewable energy). @BULLET Increase the role of economic considerations in environmental policies by introducing compulsory cost-benefit analysis for major investment projects and policies. Agree on national guidelines on parameters and methodology and follow up with 
ex post analysis. ECO/WKP(2011)63 34 Bibliography AEON (2010),  " Renewable energy non-cost barriers – Country Report Belgium Study for EC DG
