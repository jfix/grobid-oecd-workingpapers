			<p>The United States is endowed with an abundance of natural capital -the natural resource inputs and<lb/> environmental services for economic production -and economic growth has been punctuated by periods of<lb/> their rapid exploitation, such as for gold and other metal ores, minerals and coal, oil and gas. Since around<lb/> 2007, the country has been enjoying an &quot; energy renaissance &quot; thanks to its abundant stocks of shale oil and<lb/> gas being made accessible by the combination of hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling technologies.<lb/> The renaissance has revived production of oil and natural gas and is creating economic benefits. At the<lb/> same time, exploiting natural capital raises issues about how to make sure that the environmental impacts<lb/> and safety concerns are taken into consideration (i.e. internalise associated environmental externalities) and<lb/> ensure that longer-term sustainability, both of wealth and the environment, is taken into consideration. This<lb/> chapter, examining the recent upswing in oil and gas production, considers the policies that help capture<lb/> the full economic and environmental benefits while addressing externalities and longer-term sustainability.<lb/></p>

			<p>The next section describes the resource endowment in the United States and how shale oil and gas<lb/> have changed the picture for the energy sector. The next section discusses the economic benefits which<lb/> may emerge as a result of increased oil and gas production. The following section assesses how the rents<lb/> from the sector are being distributed and how taxation of the sector is implemented. This is followed by a<lb/> discussion of the local impacts of hydraulic fracturing and the regulatory challenge they create. The final<lb/> section then discusses the contribution natural gas could make to climate change mitigation and the<lb/> challenges it may pose moving towards an even lower carbon economy.<lb/></p>

			<head>The United States is well endowed with natural resources<lb/></head>

			<p>Natural capital represents a relatively small share of the overall wealth in the United States, which is<lb/> dominated by intangibles or human (and health) capital (<ref type="biblio">Arrow et al.2012</ref>). However, on a per capita basis,<lb/> calculations for the early 2000s still rank the United States 11 th in the world according to the abundance of<lb/> natural capital and 15th in respect to sub-soil mineral resources (<ref type="biblio">World Bank, 2006</ref>). Only a few OECD<lb/> countries have large shares of natural resources as a share of total wealth, which in the case of Norway<lb/> arises due to their ample off-shore hydrocarbon reserves. Japan, on the other hand, has very few natural<lb/> resources and its wealth is derived from human capital and produced (physical) capital.<lb/> Following the successful deployment of new technologies for advanced drilling, the Energy<lb/> Information Administration markedly increased its estimates of oil and gas reserves (<ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>.1). Shale gas<lb/> proved reserves -those reserves with reasonable certainty to be recoverable from known reservoirs under<lb/> existing economic and operating conditions -have risen more than fivefold between 2007 and 2011 and<lb/> now account for 40% of total gas reserves in the United States. In the case of oil, shale oil (often referred to<lb/> as &quot; tight oil &quot; ) proved reserves have also risen, though less spectacularly, and these deposits now account<lb/> for around 10% of total oil proved reserves. Forecasts suggest that production of shale gas will continue to<lb/> grow strongly till at least 2040 when it will account for one half of natural gas produced in the<lb/> United States (EIA, 2013). President Obama in his 2012 State of the Union address noted that recoverable<lb/> resources may last as long as 100 years at current production levels. At present, not all recoverable<lb/> resources would be commercially viable to extract, but in the longer term as energy prices rise and/or<lb/> technological innovation reduce extraction costs a greater share of these resources could be extracted. The<lb/> picture for production of shale oil is similar, but with total oil production peaking before 2030 and then<lb/> declining.<lb/> Natural capital in the United States has been boosted by rises in estimates of proved reserves of shale<lb/> oil and shale gas. Using a methodology developed by the World Bank to estimate natural wealth gives<lb/> some indication of the potential changes arising from these developments. By this measure, oil and gas<lb/> wealth in the United States grew from around 16% of GNI in 2000 to over 30% of GNI in 2008, just when<lb/> the shale boom was beginning to take off (<ref type="table">Table 1</ref>). Assuming the boost to reserves extends the resource<lb/> life, the expansion of shale oil and shale oil production could lift wealth derived from oil and gas<lb/> substantially. While more recent information on production costs is unavailable, using the latest available<lb/> figure to estimate the rents suggests that the natural wealth due to gas has fallen somewhat, partly as a<lb/> result of the falling natural gas prices in the United States (see below), whereas the wealth due to crude oil<lb/> rose further.<lb/></p>

			<p>The impact of shale oil and gas development has seen the gradual fall in crude oil production reversed<lb/> and the production of natural gas pick up. Between 2008 -when production hit its recent low -and 2013<lb/> crude oil production has surged, rising by almost 50%. Over the same period, the production of natural gas<lb/> has risen almost 20%, with shale gas production more than tripling and offsetting declines in conventional<lb/> natural gas production from other sources.<lb/></p>

			<p>The oil and gas boom has boosted the fortunes of a number of states and invigorated companies<lb/> working in the sector. The distribution of shale gas deposits across the country is quite widespread, though<lb/> the proved reserves are predominantly located in a handful of states, which is also where large-scale shale<lb/> gas production (these areas are often called &quot; plays &quot; ) is located (<ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>). The shale oil deposits are<lb/> predominately located in Texas, North and South Dakota, Montana, Colorado, Kansas, Nebraska and<lb/> Wyoming. Whilst energy stocks have tracked the recovery of stock market indices following the crisis, the<lb/> relatively small scale of hydraulic fracturing wells has led to a substantial inflow of independent companies<lb/> into drilling and supporting services. As a consequence, the major integrated energy companies have had a<lb/> less dominant role in the energy renaissance as it got underway, but have increasingly moved into this area.<lb/></p>

			<head>Capturing the economic benefits<lb/> Substantial economic benefits are beginning to arise from hydraulic fracturing<lb/></head>

			<p>The resurgence in US oil and gas production has already created discernible economic impacts,<lb/> boosting employment in the sector and exports of natural gas and (particularly) refined products (<ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>).<lb/> Other economic benefits are likely to arise as new production serves as a cushion to price volatility. The<lb/> direct effects of the oil and gas mining sector on growth have been relatively modest, boosting GDP<lb/> growth by on average by around 0.15 percentage points since the pick-up in energy production began in<lb/> 2007. However, BEA data on value-added of the oil and gas mining industry show that the sector has<lb/> picked up dramatically in 2011 and 2012 when the real growth rate of value added in the oil and gas<lb/> mining sector rose to 7% and then 18%, accounting for 0.23 and 0.35 percentage points of overall GDP<lb/> growth during these years, respectively. In addition, there are indirect upstream and downstream effects on<lb/> GDP that are not included in these estimates. The boom in shale oil and gas has contributed to strong<lb/> investment in structures in the oil and gas sector, with the growth rate in investment recording double digit<lb/> rates and averaging 18% annual growth between 2010 and 2012. Employment in oil and gas mining<lb/> remains relatively small, but rising strongly during the recovery from the crisis (<ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>). Including<lb/> support activities in the mining sector suggests that employment has been boosted by 300 000 between the<lb/> nadir in employment in 2003 and 2013.<lb/></p>

			<figure>Figure 3. The shale boom is boosting employment and net exports<lb/> Source: US Energy Information Administration (EIA) and the US Bureau of Labor Statistics.<lb/></figure>

			<p>In the states with the largest shale gas production, the growth rate of the oil and gas mining sector has<lb/> in some cases been spectacular, with Pennsylvania and North Dakota experiencing annual growth rates in<lb/> the sector of over 30%, albeit from low initial levels (<ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>). The effects are discernible in wage and<lb/> employment developments in some states. The impact of the resource boom is especially apparent on wage<lb/> growth. For example, according to BLS data, average weekly earnings in North Dakota are rising at a 7%<lb/> rate since 2011, compared with the national average of around 2%. BLS data also show that gains in<lb/> mining sector employment have contributed to sizable employment gains in a number of regions.<lb/></p>

			<head>The oil and gas boom has depressed domestic energy prices<lb/></head>

			<p>The shale gas and oil boom has changed the landscape for energy prices in the United States. The<lb/> relationships between international oil prices (Brent), domestic oil prices (WTI) and natural gas prices<lb/> (Henry Hub) have weakened, with the tendency for these prices to move together becoming weaker after<lb/> mid-2008, largely coinciding with the largely unanticipated rapid pick up in shale oil and gas production<lb/> (<ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref>). The decoupling of natural gas from prices in Europe and Asia is particularly pronounced. The<lb/> price of natural gas fell to as low as around one-quarter of natural gas prices in Europe and even less in the<lb/> Asian market before rebounding somewhat. The low price of natural gas promoted a switch in exploration<lb/> and production away from shale gas and towards shale oil. Lower domestic natural gas prices have<lb/> supported natural gas exports and are boosting the potential competitiveness for natural gas intensive<lb/> industry by reducing feedstock (mainly ethylene) prices, whereas other sectors benefit from cheaper energy<lb/> prices. Given liquefaction, transportation and regasification costs, the wedge between domestic and<lb/> international natural gas prices is likely to be persistent. Export of natural gas to countries without free-<lb/>trade agreements with the United States requires prior approval from the Department of Energy, for which<lb/> there is an established authorisation process. The Administration should ensure that energy exports are<lb/> promptly approved. Limited export-oriented infrastructure also currently constrains natural gas exports.<lb/> Although more than 9 billion cubic feet per day of export facilities have been granted conditional permits<lb/> from the Department of Energy and roughly 2 billion cubic feet per day have received final permits, LNG<lb/> export facilities are massive and require years to construct. With the prospect of lower domestic energy<lb/> prices, investment in pipelines and other transportation infrastructure, which are undertaken by the private<lb/> sector, will be important to ensure the economy can reap the full benefits.<lb/></p>

			<p>In the oil sector, legal restrictions on crude oil exports in place since the 1970s do not prevent the<lb/> exports of refined petroleum products. However, foreign sales may be limited to the extent that refining<lb/> capacity and transportation infrastructure are insufficient to handle the available supply. The<lb/> Administration is considering options under current law to allow exports of crude oil. Another approach<lb/> would be to abolish the prohibition of crude oil exports altogether.<lb/> Other sectors will benefit from the expansion of hydraulic fracturing through input-output linkages.<lb/> The demand from the development of the shale gas and oil sector to other sectors is likely to be relatively<lb/> weak. On the other hand lower energy costs can raise the competitiveness in energy intensive sectors,<lb/> augmenting the impact of relatively modest growth in unit labour costs (<ref type="biblio">Celasun et al., 2014</ref>). The impacts<lb/> on energy-intensive sectors, such as chemicals, are currently limited (<ref type="biblio">Goldman Sachs, 2013</ref>). To some<lb/> extent, the lack of a consistent picture in industries most likely to benefit from low domestic energy prices<lb/> is due to their capital-intensive nature. As new capacity takes time to construct the full impact on<lb/> competitiveness will only become apparent over time. That said, recent data suggests that the low domestic<lb/> energy prices are having an impact on exports. For example, <ref type="biblio">Spencer et al. (2014)</ref> note that net exports in<lb/> energy-intensive sectors more than doubled in value between 2006 and 2012 to USD 27 billion, though<lb/> still only accounting for a small share of overall trade. While the effects outside the oil and gas mining<lb/> sector have been relatively small so far, the potential for larger effects nonetheless exists (<ref type="biblio">McKinsey,<lb/> 2013</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<p>In order to reap the benefits fully, significant investment is required. This includes investments in<lb/> hydraulic fracturing and drilling itself, pipelines and other transportation infrastructure, reorienting import<lb/> terminals to export terminals and the expansion of energy-intensive industries that are likely to benefit<lb/> from lower prices. Given the significant sunk costs and irreversibility associated with these investments,<lb/> measures that reduce uncertainty support the development of transportation and associated infrastructure.<lb/> In this context, a stable policy regime, including for climate change (see below), acquires some<lb/> importance. As discussed below, the environmental impact of hydraulic fracturing is not well understood,<lb/> which creates uncertainty as to the likely regulatory response. In these circumstances, companies may<lb/> adopt a wait-and-see strategy and delay investment while environmental agencies develop their<lb/> regulations. The regulatory approach to the development of natural resources is likely to vary considerably<lb/> across states, covering environmental standards as well as permitting and licensing. Rahm (2011) notes<lb/> that the development of mineral rights in some states, such as Texas, is comparatively straightforward<lb/> whereas in others areas, such as New York state and a number of localities, development is explicitly<lb/> prohibited. The federal authorities become important regulators when resource development requires<lb/> interstate transport, with pipelines requiring the approval from the Federal Energy Regulatory<lb/> Commission.<lb/></p>

			<head>Who is capturing the benefits?<lb/></head>

			<p>The boom in oil and gas production is having significant effects in the states were the deposits are<lb/> located. This raises two related issues. The first concerns how the gains from oil and gas exploitation are<lb/> shared. The second is what happens after the oil and gas deposits are exhausted. In this context,<lb/> governments by capturing some of the resource rent can address how to adjust once the resource boom has<lb/> run its course. This could take the form of investing in education, including community colleges to help<lb/> workers become more adaptable, funding research, financing productive infrastructure provision and<lb/> establishing endowment funds and putting government finances on a better footing by paying down debt.<lb/> In some senses, due to the fungibility of money, ensuring that policy avoids squandering the revenues is<lb/> key to securing longer-term welfare.<lb/> Natural resources confer natural rents, which is roughly the difference between the price at which the<lb/> resource can be sold less the costs of exploitation and extraction or more formally the opportunity cost of<lb/> holding the resource underground. Policy settings are important in determining which groups benefit most<lb/> from the exploitation of natural resources, including future generations who stand to lose unless provisions<lb/> ensure they also benefit.<lb/></p>

			<p>In competitive markets, the benefits of resource exploitation are shared among several parties. First,<lb/> landowners benefit from owning the mineral rights through lease payments for their exploitation. Second,<lb/> new gas and oil production has pushed down energy prices, particularly gas prices, benefitting consumers.<lb/> In the oil sector, legal restrictions on crude oil exports in place since the 1970s do not prevent the exports<lb/> of refined petroleum products. However, foreign sales may be limited to the extent that refining capacity<lb/> and transportation infrastructure is insufficient to handle the available supply. For example, some refiners<lb/> are better adapted to using heavier crude oil than the light oil typically produced by hydraulic fracturing. In<lb/> this case, some of the possible resource rent obtainable for oil producers though exporting would be<lb/> sacrificed were domestic light oil production to rise to the point where it exceeds domestic refiners&apos; ability<lb/> to easily absorb it. The Administration is considering options under current law to allow exports of crude<lb/> oil. Another approach would be to abolish the prohibition of crude oil exports altogether.<lb/></p>

			<head>Taxation of shale oil and gas<lb/></head>

			<p>Federal and state governments may capture some of the resource rent through various taxes and use<lb/> the revenues to support spending or funds that will raise future well-being. Taxing natural resource rents, if<lb/> done properly, can be less distortionary than other forms of taxation (Box 1.). A well-designed profit tax<lb/> could reduce economic distortions which can discourage exploration and development. However, most<lb/> governments rely on royalties and the rate applied can be relatively low. A few states have experienced a<lb/> significant increase in revenues from resource related taxation (<ref type="table">Table 2</ref>) and enjoyed a corresponding boost<lb/> to spending (NASBO, 2013).<lb/></p>

			<head>Box 1. Taxation of non-renewable natural resources<lb/></head>

			<p>Profits derived from non-renewable resource extraction can be taxed while imposing relatively small distortions<lb/> on the economy (Andrade de <ref type="biblio">Sá and Daubanes, 2014</ref>). However, the form of taxation can influence the effort in<lb/> exploration and development. While a number of options exist for taxing resources rents, in the United States, most<lb/> governments rely on royalties (also known as severance taxes). Due to the split between federal and state tax<lb/> authority, combinations state resource taxes and federal corporate income taxation are typical.<lb/> Royalty taxes are based on the amount of oil and gas extracted. While relatively easy to collect they introduce a<lb/> number of distortions. The tax can induce the firm to shut extracting the oil and gas earlier than is socially optimal.<lb/> Secondly, the tax can reduce incentives to invest in exploration, although this can be mitigated partially by offering<lb/> investment subsidies. Broadway and Keen (2008) point out that this may give incentives for state governments to levy<lb/> higher severance tax rates than they otherwise would if the royalties are deductible against federal corporate income<lb/> tax. The range of rates levied across the states suggests that this is not an overriding concern. Profit taxation is<lb/> another approach (implemented in Alaska in combination with a royalty tax), which is intended to capture a share of<lb/> profits arising from the resource rent. In this approach a tax is levied on all real transactions on a cash flow basis. The<lb/> government reimburses the private sector firm for negative cash flows, which are typical in the early stage of a project,<lb/> and retain a share of total revenue when the project is generating a positive cash flow. In practice, governments find it<lb/> hard to compensate a private sector firm contemporaneously and prefer to allow the private company to carry forward<lb/> losses with interest. This form of taxation can potentially capture a large share of the resource rent without distorting<lb/> investment and production decisions. Furthermore, the tax base is likely to differ from the resource rent and will again<lb/> introduce distortions to investment and production decisions, though they are less severe than royalty tax regimes. A<lb/> final approach is through using fixed fees for exploration and auctions for exploration rights to capture some of the<lb/> resource rent. When other forms of taxation are also levied later on the project life, the amount of rent captured will be<lb/> reduced or the fee will discourage investment.<lb/></p>

			<p>The taxation of oil and gas resources in the United States varies depending on the ownership of the<lb/> land with the deposit. As the majority is on private land, the federal government has little influence on the<lb/> taxation of these resources other than through the normal application of corporate income taxes, which is<lb/> determined by Congress. When oil and gas deposits are on federal land, taxation on mineral resources is<lb/> implemented by the Department of the Interior. The Department of the Interior (ONRR) collects revenues<lb/> when bids for leases are made (bonus bids), rent while the lease is not in production (rental fees) and<lb/> royalties when production starts (royalties). Following criticism from GAO over the low federal<lb/> government take (GAO, 2013), the Department of Interior changed offshore terms (royalty rates set at<lb/> 18.75% for some offshore deposits, minimum bids, rental rates), but has not changed the onshore fiscal<lb/> system (royalty rate of 12.5%). For deposit on federal land, the states also get a share of the revenues from<lb/> the royalties. The split is 50-50 between the state and federal governments with the exception of resources<lb/> lying on the outer continental shelf for which the revenue split for littoral state governments is 27% or<lb/> 37.5% under the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act.<lb/> For oil and gas deposits on private or state owned land, there is no consistent tax treatment across the<lb/> states. Taxes on production as a share of the oil and gas sector&apos;s value added ranges from just 7% in<lb/> Arkansas to almost 60% in Alaska (<ref type="table">Table 2</ref>). Royalty tax revenues accrue totally to the state if the land is<lb/> privately held. Different royalty taxes are in place in 30 states, ranging from 10 cents on the barrel for oil<lb/> in Ohio to 8% of gross value in Kansas. Alaska implements a hybrid system combining a royalty tax and a<lb/> profits tax, which has more desirable properties. Pennsylvania, the third largest producer of shale gas in<lb/> 2011, does not levy a specific tax. However, Pennsylvania introduced an unconventional gas well fee in<lb/> 2012. If revenues exceed a threshold, surplus revenues will be distributed to localities. At the local level,<lb/> states may share some of the royalty tax revenue with local governments. In addition, hydraulic fracturing<lb/> rents are taxed through property and/or income taxes. In some cases, property taxes include mineral rights<lb/> in the base. Consistent with the theoretical analysis of royalty taxation, the development of reserves tends<lb/> to be depressed by higher rates of royalty taxation on value added (see Annex).<lb/></p>

			<head>Future generations<lb/></head>

			<p>One challenge is to ensure that current resource use also supports economic welfare of future<lb/> generations. On aggregate for the United States, estimates of adjusted net savings, which take into account<lb/> whether total wealth (including natural resources) is increasing, suggest that investment in education<lb/> outweighs the depletion of natural resources (Box 2). Using revenues to support future living standards<lb/> differs across the states. Some such as Alaska, Colorado, Montana, New Mexico and Wyoming have<lb/> created severance endowment funds, which inter alia use revenues raised from oil and gas exploitation to<lb/> help finance capital projects and invest in education. For example, West Virginia created a Future Fund,<lb/> capturing 3% of the severance tax to fund infrastructure, education and economic development as well as<lb/> tax relief and cultural preservation. The fund created limitations on how much lawmakers could draw on<lb/> the fund (SWF <ref type="biblio">Institute, 2014</ref>). The New Mexico Severance Tax Permanent Fund uses its resources to pay<lb/> interest in bonds financing capital projects also investing in education. Other states have earmarked natural<lb/> resource revenues to support spending that is less likely to benefit future generations. For example, West<lb/> Virginia did not establish a specific mechanism to ensure future generations also benefitted from the<lb/> mining of its substantial coal deposits. Rather revenues were spent annually. As coal mining in the state<lb/> has weakened, the state is facing challenges in adapting to this environment (<ref type="biblio">Williams, 2008</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<head>Box 2. Natural resources and economic sustainability<lb/></head>

			<p>Non-renewable natural resources once (economically) recoverable will be ceteris paribus depleted. As such the<lb/> country&apos;s stock of (natural) wealth is reduced, with the exploitation akin to a process of disinvestment. As such future<lb/> generations are not guaranteed to share in the benefits of these natural resources. This has led some authors, such as<lb/> Hartwick (1977), to recognise that investing the rents captured during the depletion of the exhaustible natural resource<lb/> in (produced) capital can enhance sustainability. That is, not only the current generation enjoy the benefits from<lb/> resource exploitation, but future generations also enjoy raised consumption possibilities. However, the degree to which<lb/> natural and produced capital stocks are substitutable is not always clear cut and in some cases the amount of natural<lb/> capital needs to be preserved above critical levels in order to provide environmental services that may provide life-<lb/>support functions.<lb/></p>

			<figure>Identifying empirically whether the current patterns of natural resource exploitation is sustainable presents a<lb/> number of difficulties in both the measurement of natural capital and identifying which types of investment will augment<lb/> future generation&apos;s stock of wealth. Standard measures of economic development, such as GDP growth and measures<lb/> of capital stocks generally do not consider the role of environment in production. A number of approaches have taken<lb/> into account the environment.<lb/> • One approach has been to adjust the standard measure of national savings by the depletion of natural<lb/> resources and the impact on environment. The so-called genuine savings or adjusted net saving assess<lb/> whether the exploitation of natural resources (and environmental externalities) does not subtract from<lb/> economic welfare of future generations (World Bank, 2006). Updated estimates for 2008 suggest that for the<lb/> United States that net savings (gross national savings minus consumption of fixed capital) was negative.<lb/> However, adjusted net saving was positive when taking into account education spending and making<lb/> adjustments for the depletion of energy and mineral resources and environmental damage from carbon<lb/> dioxide emissions and particulate matter. Nonetheless, savings in the United States were comparatively<lb/> small by both measures (Figure 2.6).<lb/> Figure 6. Adjusted national savings (2008)<lb/> As a percentage of GNI<lb/> Source: World Bank.<lb/></figure>

			<p>• Related and recent work at the OECD has attempted to take account of the use of certain types of natural<lb/> capital through adjustments to productivity measures (<ref type="biblio">Brandt et al., 2013</ref>). This work (covering the period<lb/> 1986 to 2008) suggests for the United States that the difference between traditional and adjusted<lb/> productivity measures is not large (<ref type="figure">Figure 7</ref>). However, during this period, oil and gas reserves fell and the<lb/> contribution of natural capital to growth was slightly negative overall. As such, during the period of resource<lb/> depletion, other factors of production needed to increase slightly to maintain similar rates of growth.<lb/></p>

			<p>In a number of cases, governments also collect revenues for conservation and remediation purposes.<lb/> At the federal level, the Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) was introduced in 1964 to capture<lb/> some of the rent from the depletion of oil and gas resources on the outer continental shelf to protect other<lb/> natural resources, such as coastal areas, open areas and wildlife habitat. At the state level, a few states levy<lb/> taxes to address oil field clean ups and restoration, including Louisiana and Texas. Several other states levy<lb/> oil and gas conservation fees which are earmarked for capping and reclaiming abandoned wells amongst<lb/> other uses.<lb/></p>

			<head>Local impacts<lb/></head>

			<p>Hydraulic fracturing has aroused considerable controversy. The environmental and social impact of<lb/> large scale drilling activity across the landscape has provoked significant local opposition in some parts of<lb/> the country. Bans have been imposed in New York State, metropolitan Pittsburgh and a handful of towns<lb/> around the country. However, survey findings reveal respondents are not necessarily opposed to hydraulic<lb/> fracturing, but want assurances that it will be conducted correctly (<ref type="biblio">Krupnick, 2013</ref>), implying a role for<lb/> regulatory frameworks in facilitating stakeholder acceptance (IEA, 2012).<lb/></p>

			<head>Local externalities<lb/></head>

			<p>At the local level, inhabitants experience a number of externalities (<ref type="biblio">Muehlenbachs et al., 2012</ref>). Close<lb/> to the well inhabitants face (adjacency) costs associated with noise and light pollution, local air pollution,<lb/> visual dis-amenities (pollution). In addition, there are a number of vicinity effects as people are affected by<lb/> the impact of traffic congestion and road damage as the road pavement in rural areas are often not<lb/> constructed for the heavy vehicles. The major impacts for residents are arguably through the environmental<lb/> externalities created by hydraulic fracturing. There is considerable uncertainty about these effects and the<lb/> science far from settled. The impact on the local environment is not universally negative. The substitution<lb/> of coal and other fuels by natural gas may have effects through reducing other emissions, such as sulphur<lb/> dioxide, carbon monoxide, nitrous oxides and particulate matter.<lb/></p>

			<head>Hydraulic fracturing puts stress on water resources…<lb/></head>

			<p>Up to 5 million gallons of water are needed for each shale gas hydraulic fracturing well. This demand<lb/> in a relatively short period of time puts stress on local water resources, which is not limited to a problem of<lb/> arid regions. Demands on water resources have mounted and water stress has become a more common<lb/> phenomenon. The rate of extraction of ground water from aquifers has increased over the 20 th century,<lb/> partly driven by land drainage to extend farmland. Since the turn of the 21 st century, the rate of ground<lb/> water depletion has accelerated, such that slightly less than one-fifth of total groundwater depletion since<lb/> 1900 occurred in the period 2000-08 (USGS, 2013). While hydraulic fracturing only accounts for a small<lb/> fraction of the demand for water, the localised demand for a short period can create important stresses on<lb/> water resources. For surface water, such demands can threaten the environmental services provided by the<lb/> local ecosystems when water levels or flows drop precipitously.<lb/> Respecting the competing demands on water resources requires adequate water rights are in place,<lb/> while respecting minimum flow requirements for water bodies. Pricing water resources effectively and<lb/> allowing trading may go some way to using limited water resources efficiently. Remediation efforts and<lb/> biodiversity-offsets or compensatory mitigation, which ensure that the environmental damage in one area<lb/> is compensated in another, can play a role to mitigate excessive stresses on water resources. For example,<lb/> the EPA has established &quot; mitigation banking &quot; to preserve wetlands. Under this approach, projects that will<lb/> have unavoidable impacts on wetlands must purchase offset credits to support the establishment,<lb/> restoration or enhancement of wetlands in a different location, which may be undertaken by a third party.<lb/> In a similar approach to offsets, the federal government uses royalties from the depletion of oil and gas<lb/> resources on the outer continental shelf held in the Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) to protect<lb/> other natural resources. Similarly, the Energy Policy Act of 2005 established the Coastal Impact Assistance<lb/> Program (CIAP) which provides money for coastal restoration and preservation for littoral states. While<lb/> the offset approach has attractive properties, care is needed to ensure that there are not non-linearities with<lb/> the depreciation of natural capital in one location that cannot be offset by supporting natural capital in<lb/> another (see Dasgupta, 2009 for a general consideration of these issues). In this context, the permitting<lb/> authority needs to ensure that the proposed project does not have unavoidable (irreversible) consequences,<lb/> such as contamination of a groundwater aquifer, that outweigh the proposed benefits. When irreversible<lb/> effects are a concern, the regulatory authority should postpone decisions until new information helps<lb/> reduce uncertainty about the consequences. Such decisions should also account for the public&apos;s preferences<lb/> for environmental services, which vary across the country. In this context, taking stock of opinions, such as<lb/> is done by Canada&apos;s biennial Household and the Environment Survey, would help better inform decisions<lb/> concerning the environment at both the national and state level.<lb/></p>

			<head>… and risks water contamination<lb/></head>

			<p>Risks from hydraulic fracturing wells include contamination of shallow freshwater aquifer and surface<lb/> water with chemicals and other substances used or released in the fracturing process. Reports examining<lb/> the potential for contamination of drinking water suggest that risks to aquifers are low if the hydraulic<lb/> fracturing takes place at sufficient depth. However, contamination risks stemming from faulty wells and<lb/> accidental spillage leading to surface water contamination remain (<ref type="biblio">Royal Society, 2012</ref>). Groundwater<lb/> contamination risk remains a major concern expressed by residents. This can also be seen through the<lb/> effect on property prices. Early evidence, using data from Pennsylvania and New York on house sales and<lb/> well placement suggests that houses near the wells benefit from economic rents, but within a close radius<lb/> of 1-1.5 km, the fear of groundwater contamination pushes house prices down (between 10% and 22%)<lb/> compared to houses that rely on public water supplies (<ref type="biblio">Muehlenbachs et al., 2012</ref>). Households may suffer<lb/> from adjacency effects, which push prices down further next to the wells. Overall the study noted that the<lb/> benefits from shale gas arrive quickly but then dissipate, consistent with a boom and bust type of<lb/> development.<lb/></p>

			<p>Water is often co-produced with hydraulic fracturing, which creates challenges for treatment and<lb/> disposal, such as separating out and re-injecting in lower appropriate disposal zones. Some of the water<lb/> introduced in the well (15-80%) will become &quot; flowback &quot; , which may need to be treated due to chemicals<lb/> added to the fracturing fluids as well as the materials mobilised during the fracturing process, such as<lb/> heavy metals and naturally-occurring radioactive materials. The wastewater may be recycled and used in<lb/> other wells, re-injected deep underground (often into salinic acquifers), treated and added to surface water<lb/> or spread over the land. Kiviat (2013) reports a number of incidents where hydro-fracturing fluids have<lb/> been released into the environment and discusses the implications for biodiversity. Empirical work<lb/> suggests that the major problems are more likely to be found at the treatment sites than the wells<lb/> (<ref type="biblio">Olmstead et al., 2013</ref>). Fracturing fluids contain chemicals to separate the oil and gas from the rock<lb/> formations and ease their passage through the rock as well as propping agents which hold the rock<lb/> formations open to allow the natural gas and oil to flow through the horizontal portion of the well to the<lb/> vertical portion of the well. Some states have not required the disclosure of what chemicals are being used<lb/> in fracturing fluids (<ref type="biblio">McFeeley, 2012</ref>). However, other states have begun to require industry participants to<lb/> report which chemicals are being used and voluntary reporting of chemicals is occurring with groups such<lb/> as Fracfocus and the EPA is seeking public comments on disclosure. While exemptions to public<lb/> disclosure due to trade secrets can be part of the disclosure regime, these should not become a loophole and<lb/> companies should be required to report the chemicals being used to a regulatory authority.<lb/></p>

			<head>The regulatory regime is complex<lb/></head>

			<p>Regulation on water use and the protection of groundwater and surface waters has originated at<lb/> different levels of governments, which has resulted in a complex overall regulatory regime. For example,<lb/> local authorities, groundwater management areas and regional planning bodies are involved in granting<lb/> access to water resources, and state and federal bodies are responsible for environmental management and<lb/> stewardship. Most regulation of hydraulic fracturing is issued at the state level, although the Department of<lb/> Interior can regulate hydraulic fracturing on federal land and EPA has some limited responsibility, which is<lb/> typically implemented by authorised states, tribes and territories. Under the federal Safe Drinking Water<lb/> Act, EPA&apos;s regulations specify minimum permitting requirements applicable to hydraulic fracturing of oil<lb/> and gas wells using diesel fuels. The EPA released guidance to state and EPA regional permit writers in<lb/> 2014. These regulations also apply to underground injection of wastewaters from oil and gas production<lb/> (irrespective of use of diesel fuels) for purposes of disposal. In addition, under the federal Clean Water<lb/> Act, EPA&apos;s regulations restrict the discharge of hydraulic fracturing wastewater to surface waters under the<lb/> national technology-based limitations programme. However, federal regulatory authority to address water<lb/> quality impacts of hydraulic fracturing is limited under several key environmental statutes – for example,<lb/> the oil and gas stormwater exemption from permitting requirements under the Clean Water Act and the<lb/> exclusion of hydraulic fracturing (other than where diesel is used) from the Safe Drinking Water Act<lb/> Underground Injection Control requirements. The federal authorities can also become involved when the<lb/> EPA issues an endangerment order, which can require a company to take immediate action to protect<lb/> individuals from harm (<ref type="biblio">Rahm, 2011</ref>). Further study is needed to formulate regulation to address<lb/> environmental concerns and increase public confidence in hydraulic fracturing, notably to harmonise and<lb/> strengthen the impact assessments of drilling projects.<lb/></p>

			<head>What happens when things go wrong?<lb/></head>

			<p>Transportation needs for shale oil and gas have grown rapidly, often in regions where the existing<lb/> pipeline capacity is insufficient. This has led to a surge in railroad transport, with the number of railroad<lb/> carloads of crude oil jumping an estimated 42 times between 2008 and 2013 (Association of <ref type="biblio">American<lb/> Railroads, 2013</ref>). Rail in late 2013 accounted for the transport of around 800 000 barrels a day or 11% of<lb/> total oil shipments. The transport of crude oil by train raises a number of risks. During 2013, a number of<lb/> accidents, including the explosion in North Dakota, reignited concerns about the safety of this mode of<lb/> transport, particularly in the aftermath of the Lac Mégantic tragedy in Canada. In this context, measures to<lb/> help develop pipeline capacity, such as expediting the planning process and reducing uncertainty about<lb/> projects, would be welcome. However, due to the dispersed nature of drilling, transporting oil to the<lb/> pipelines will still require other means of transportation. Federal authorities are responsible for setting rail<lb/> standards while state authorities, such as New York, are drawing up contingencies plans for the possibility<lb/> of accidents. To some extent, railroad transport is also favoured by the Jones Act, which bans foreign<lb/> shipping undertaking cabotage in US coastal waters. Railroads are ideally placed to benefit from the lack<lb/> of domestic shipping capacity.<lb/> A second area is what happens in the aftermath of significant environmental damage. After the<lb/> Deepwater Horizon event, Congress passed the Resources and Ecosystems Sustainability, Tourist<lb/> Opportunities, and Revived Economies (RESTORE) which channelled penalties levied under the Clean<lb/> Water Act for coastal restoration. Applying similar approaches for hydraulic fracturing may run into<lb/> problems. Due to the smaller size of firms involved, the possibility of appealing for bankruptcy can mean<lb/> that penalties will not cover all damage costs if the firm is found liable and it will not internalising the<lb/> externalities. Requiring insurance-type payments may lead to riskier behaviour than otherwise. In this<lb/> context, levying restoration fees, as many states already do to deal with clean-up costs and abandoned<lb/> wells, while leaving firms liable may be a reasonable approach. Alternatively, regulators could set<lb/> verifiable precautionary standards backed up by legal proceedings (<ref type="biblio">Hiriart et al. 2004</ref>). An alternative<lb/> approach could be implemented through bonding requirements, which are already used in a number of<lb/> states and by the federal government. Under this approach, companies post bonds prior to drilling wells. If<lb/> the exploitation results in no environmental damage the bond is returned to the company when production<lb/> at the well ceases (<ref type="biblio">Davis, 2014</ref>). States with a longer experience of oil and gas production tend to have<lb/> stricter regulations in place and levy restoration fees or bonds (<ref type="biblio">Richardson et al., 2013</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<head>Links to climate change<lb/></head>

			<p>In 2009, the United States committed to the goal of reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the<lb/> range of 17% from 2005 levels by 2020. There have been sizeable reductions in emissions, partly arising<lb/> due to the recession as well as to improvements in energy efficiency in the economy (<ref type="figure">Figure 8</ref>). In 2012,<lb/> carbon emissions from the energy sector fell to the lowest level in two decades. Among OECD countries,<lb/> the United States has achieved among the biggest improvements in energy intensity in recent decades,<lb/> albeit from relatively high levels. Its energy intensity declined at an average rate of 2% per year from 1980<lb/> to 2010. In recent years, policy efforts to improve energy efficiency further have been reinforced. For<lb/> example, the 2009 economic stimulus package included new energy efficiency initiatives and substantial<lb/> additional funding for existing programs. In June 2013, the administration unveiled a comprehensive<lb/> Climate Action Plan, including a plan to impose carbon emissions standards to both new and existing<lb/> power plants.<lb/> Despite the positive trends, preliminary data show that carbon dioxide emissions are estimated to have<lb/> risen by around 2% in 2013. During the summer of 2013, higher demand for electricity induced an increase<lb/> in coal-fired electricity supply and severe winter weather raised energy demand at the end of the year,<lb/> boosting carbon dioxide emissions and highlighting the interplay between weather conditions and the<lb/> electricity sector (Box 3).<lb/> The current approach to meet climate change objectives relies less on using market-based instruments,<lb/> such as an emission tax, and more on regulation. In this context, the EPA is charged with regulating<lb/> greenhouse gas emissions from electricity generation under the Clean Air Act. The states will have<lb/> flexibility in how to implement these requirements for power plants in their jurisdictions, thereby allowing<lb/> them to choose locally-appropriate compliance measures. Other initiatives to improve energy efficiency<lb/> will serve to reduce emissions further. This approach to emission abatement is arguably more costly than<lb/> an emission tax, though by inducing fuel switching may achieve some reductions at relatively low cost<lb/> (<ref type="biblio">Goulder et al. 2014</ref>). However, with this approach, care is needed to prevent the marginal abatement costs<lb/> diverging too much. Given the variety of approaches the states are likely to adopt, including market-based<lb/> cap-and-trade schemes (see Box 4), regulation may be needed to limit differences in the stringency of<lb/> regulation as well as address possible coordination failures across states. Carefully designed state-level<lb/> policy has the potential to achieve considerable emission mitigation at relatively low cost<lb/> (<ref type="biblio">Burtraw et al. 2014</ref>).<lb/></p>

Greater weather variability<lb/> The scientific evidence assessed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC<ref type="biblio">, 2013</ref>) points to climate<lb/> change amplifying extreme weather events, with the effects varying regionally. The types of extreme weather events<lb/> that are becoming more frequent include longer heat waves and heavier precipitation. In North America the threat of<lb/> flooding and more intense storms also appears to have risen.<lb/></p>

			<p>The combination of changing weather patterns with trends in energy demand has had implications for electricity<lb/> generation. Energy demand has changed as the share of industry in total output has fallen, technology has become<lb/> more energy efficient and the greater diffusion of air conditioning. These trends have led to electricity demand<lb/> becoming more weather sensitive such that when weather conditions lead to more use of cooling or heating, demand<lb/> for electricity surges. Over time as the reduction in consumption from sectoral change and improved energy efficiency<lb/> has reduced the average demand for electricity, the increasing sensitivity of demand to heating or cooling has seen the<lb/> ratio of peak to average demand for electricity gradually increase (<ref type="figure">Figure 9</ref>). During the periods of surges in demand,<lb/> the marginal producer of electricity may change with corresponding changes in fuel type. In 2013, more days had<lb/> pronounced peaks in temperature which would require cooling in buildings (raising cooling degree days) while the<lb/> winter in early 2014 was exceptionally cold raising the amount of heating needed to maintain a comfortable<lb/> temperature in buildings (raising heating degree days). Partly as a result, emissions of carbon dioxide from coal rose<lb/> by an estimated 2%, reversing some of the gains in emission reductions recorded over the previous five years as<lb/> previously mothballed coal-fired power stations were brought back on line. Greater weather variability complicates the<lb/> management of the electricity market and potentially makes climate change mitigation more difficult to achieve in the<lb/> absence of other measures. To the extent that the weather patterns are becoming more volatile, these challenges may<lb/> become more difficult to address.<lb/></p>

			<head>Shale gas can help reduce emissions<lb/></head>

			<p>Natural gas is a potential &quot; bridge fuel &quot; towards a lower carbon economy. The rapid development of<lb/> US shale gas resources has helped to reduce emissions by leading to a substitution away from coal-<lb/>powered electricity generation to natural gas turbines (<ref type="figure">Figure 7</ref>)</p>

			<figure>. Indeed, coal-fired power stations have<lb/> been under pressure from slowing electricity demand and competition from low natural gas prices. Coal-<lb/>fired electricity generation has fallen by around 11 percentage points of total electricity production<lb/> between 2008 and 2012, while natural gas accounted for a rise of 9 percentage points between 2008 and<lb/> 2012, suggesting little &quot; rebound effect &quot; induced by cheaper natural gas prices. Furthermore, prospects for<lb/> some coal-fired power stations are weakened further by Mercury and Air Toxics Standards (MATS) which<lb/> 1.4<lb/> 1.5<lb/> 1.6<lb/> 1.7<lb/> 1.8<lb/> 1.9<lb/> 2.0<lb/> 1.4<lb/> 1.5<lb/> 1.6<lb/> 1.7<lb/> 1.8<lb/> 1.9<lb/> 2.0<lb/> 1993 94 95 96 97 98 99 2000 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 10 11 12<lb/> will take effect in April 2015. The EIA (<ref type="biblio">2012)</ref> projects that this will lead to significant retirement of coal-<lb/>fired power capacity. These trends are likely to reduce externalities significantly. Detailed county-level<lb/> modelling for the United States suggests that by taking into account estimates of the environmental and<lb/> health impact of coal-fired power generation the harmful impact of air pollution from the sector is double<lb/> the conventional measure of value added. By contrast, the ratio of harmful impacts of air pollution from<lb/> natural gas-fired generation to the sector&apos;s value added is only one third (<ref type="biblio">Muller et al., 2011</ref>).<lb/> Natural gas can play a role in helping renewable energy gain a greater share of electricity generation<lb/> by helping to address the intermittency problem. Renewables are often a &quot; must-take &quot; generation source,<lb/> which means that when electricity generation from renewable sources fluctuates the system operator must<lb/> somehow achieve balance elsewhere (<ref type="biblio">Weiss et al., 2013</ref>). From a security-of-supply perspective<lb/> renewables can thus create challenges to system operators. As natural gas fired generators can adapt<lb/> relatively quickly to changes in demand and supply they have a role to play in facilitating the expansion of<lb/> renewables. This might happen because electricity production from natural gas would help meet demand<lb/> when generation from wind and solar electricity drops or rises due to changes in wind and sunlight. In this<lb/> context, an energy mix focusing on the combination of natural gas and renewables in electricity generation<lb/> will go a long way towards providing reliable supply while lowering US greenhouse gas emissions.<lb/> However, gas-powered generators cannot react quickly enough to offset sudden large surges or drop offs in<lb/> renewable supply. In this context, developing storage capacity, smart grid technologies and price sensitive<lb/> demand would complement renewable and natural gas generated electricity (<ref type="biblio">Benatia et al., 2013</ref>).<lb/> Finally, relatively low natural gas prices will also affect emissions from the transport sector, making<lb/> natural gas powered vehicles more attractive. Already low natural gas prices and the expectation that they<lb/> will remain low has induced investment in natural gas powered vehicles. The implementation in 2014 of<lb/> EPA regulations extending fuel economy standards to medium and heavy-duty vehicles will likely give a<lb/> further fillip to natural gas powered vehicles. As the refuelling network is expanded this could induce an<lb/> expansion from short-haul to long-haul trucking, leading to further gains in emission reductions (EIA,<lb/> 2013). The EIA projects that the transportation sector&apos;s consumption of natural gas will almost double by<lb/> 2040, with a large part of demand driven by gas-powered heavy duty vehicles.<lb/></p>

			<head>The shale gas challenge for climate change<lb/> Fugitive methane emissions and gas flaring<lb/></head>

			<p>While the substitution of natural gas for coal leads to lower emissions in electricity generation, the<lb/> production of non-conventional natural gas leads to emissions of fugitive methane during production, due<lb/> to leaks from loose fitting pipes and venting from gas wells, and transportation. More work remains to be<lb/> done to quantify the scale of these emissions and at what points in production and transportation they<lb/> occur. More is known about production than distribution (<ref type="biblio">Allen et al., 2013; EPA, 2013; IEA, 2012</ref>).<lb/> Accounting for these emissions could significantly reduce the climate benefits from switching to natural<lb/> gas, though they are unlikely to offset the long-term benefits from substituting away from coal.<lb/> Furthermore, relatively few sources may be high emitters and tools to identify rapidly and fix these leaks<lb/> could have large benefits (<ref type="biblio">Brandt et al., 2014</ref>).<lb/> The EPA has in place a long-standing and voluntary Natural GasSTAR Programme that encourages<lb/> the use of cost-efficient technologies to reduce and capture methane emissions. The administration has<lb/> announced a strategy to reduce methane emissions from the oil and gas sector, building on the STAR<lb/> programme. EPA guidance was to flare these emissions, as this reduces the potency of the emissions, but<lb/> following amendments to air regulations for the oil and gas industry in 2012 (new source performance<lb/> standards) companies are encouraged to move towards &quot; green completion &quot; of wells, which separates gas<lb/> and liquids flowing from the well and captures the gas. The second phase of the amendments starting in<lb/> 2015 requires companies to capture the gas and make it available for use or sale. In some cases, states and<lb/> local governments have already moved to address this issue for example, Colorado, in collaboration with<lb/> industry, has established regulations on minimising methane emissions. In other cases, states have<lb/> considered using taxation on flaring or venting, which would help gas producers internalise global<lb/> externalities. The differences across states regarding regulations on flaring or venting methane can be<lb/> considerable, partly reflecting the relative development of pipeline infrastructure. For example, flaring<lb/> methane in Texas is permitted in some case for 180 days, whereas in North Dakota flaring is allowed for<lb/> one year before becoming liable to pay taxes and royalties on the flared gas. In addition, exemptions may<lb/> then be granted if there are difficulties in connecting to a pipeline. At times, almost one-third of all gas<lb/> produced in North Dakota has been flared or otherwise not marketed (EIA, 2011).<lb/></p>

			<head>Knock on effects on energy markets<lb/></head>

			<p>The substitution of natural gas for coal has seen repercussions on the market for coal. Despite<lb/> declining domestic demand, US coal production has fallen relatively little as coal exports have more than<lb/> doubled since the shale gas boom began to take hold in 2007 (<ref type="figure">Figure 10</ref>). Low carbon permit prices on the<lb/> European market are inducing energy producers to increase their combustion of coal leading to a global<lb/> rise in carbon emissions. Appropriately pricing the carbon content of fuels, such as with an emission tax,<lb/> both in the United States and other countries, would ensure that the environmental benefits of switching to<lb/> natural gas in one country are not lost through increasing coal consumption in other countries<lb/> (see <ref type="biblio">Golosov et al, 2014</ref>). Further rapid increases in coal exports may be limited by capacity constraints at<lb/> existing export terminals coupled with local opposition -concerned about particulate matter pollution -to<lb/> increasing railroad transportation and constructing new coal yards at ports.<lb/></p>

			<head>Risks of lock-in<lb/></head>

			<p>A final challenge for climate change policy arises from the risk of lock in, whereby choices made<lb/> today will limit the opportunities available in the future. The development of shale gas can support the<lb/> transition towards a lower carbon economy. As seen above, relatively low natural gas prices have already<lb/> encouraged fuel substitution towards less carbon-intensive energy production and provide a platform on<lb/> which to build. The question is will natural gas act as a &quot; bridge fuel &quot; to moving towards a zero net<lb/> emissions target or lead to inertia to additional mitigation, which may also arise due to stranded assets. In<lb/></p>

			<p>Exports (right axis)<lb/> the absence of concerted action to manage the transition there is a danger that as relative prices change or<lb/> in the longer-term as natural gas begins to be depleted the energy market will respond by switching back to<lb/> coal-fired power. In this context, while the shale gas boom could provide the &quot; bridge fuel &quot; towards a lower<lb/> carbon economy, flanking measures (emission pricing, subsidising innovation, supporting renewables and<lb/> developing smart electricity grids) will be required to ensure this outcome. In particular, two areas were<lb/> flanking measures may be required are in countering natural gas hindering renewables and low prices<lb/> stymieing innovation.<lb/></p>

			<p>The expansion of natural gas fired generation may hinder the future development of renewable<lb/> energy. The development of smart grids -which offers the potential to harness renewable energy<lb/> effectively -is incremental and path dependent (<ref type="biblio">Koenigs et al. 2013</ref>). Without careful preparation, the<lb/> current expansion of natural gas and development of the supporting electricity infrastructure could hinder<lb/> future movement towards a lower carbon economy by creating difficulties in integrating a larger share of<lb/> more volatile renewable sources of energy. Against this background, the different government and private<lb/> actors need to co-ordinate their activities and support long-term investments that will re-orientate<lb/> transmission and distribution towards networks which can accommodate a larger share of low or (net) no<lb/> carbon electricity generation. The US Energy Independence and Security Act (2007) and the American<lb/> Recovery and Reinvestment Act (2009) have provided government support and funding for nationwide<lb/> modernisation of the electrical grid and ensure stable mid-term prospects for private investors. The Federal<lb/> Energy Regulatory Commission also works to promote the modernisation of the grid and the integration of<lb/> renewables in electricity generation. Such actions are important in overcoming possible lock in effects.<lb/></p>

			<head>Box 4. The Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative<lb/></head>

			<p>In 2009, the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI), bringing together initially 10 states, introduced a cap-<lb/>and-trade program for carbon dioxide emissions.<lb/>A final area where low natural gas prices may present a challenge to greenhouse gas mitigation is<lb/> through the effect on innovation. The United States is a leader in innovation on energy efficiency<lb/> technologies, although only a fraction of government R&amp;D support is allocated to the environment<lb/> and energy (about 1.8% of government R&amp;D). Patent filings related to green growth have been<lb/> steadily rising since 1990 and began outpacing the growth of total US patents since 2005.The impressive<lb/> gains in energy efficiency witnessed over the past decades were partly driven by high prices driving<lb/> innovation in energy-saving technology (<ref type="biblio">Popp, 2002; Aghion et al. 2012</ref>). In order to mitigate these<lb/> undesirable outcomes, some subsidisation of innovation in energy saving technology to &quot; direct &quot; technical<lb/> change would be warranted. Such an approach would be in line with the policy mix advocated by<lb/> <ref type="biblio">Acemoglu et al. (2012)</ref>, who showed that optimal environmental policy would use carbon taxes in<lb/> combination with subsidies to direct innovation activity towards the &quot; clean &quot; sector when goods are<lb/> substitutable. Case study evidence supports an approach of combining taxation and subsidisation in<lb/> promoting innovation to improve environmental outcomes (OECD, 2010). At the federal level, the<lb/> America COMPETES Act created the Advanced Research Projects Agency -Energy, which funds energy<lb/> technology projects. More recently, the administration has proposed to create an Energy Security Trust<lb/> Fund, which would work in this direction. Certain states, notably California -and also participants in<lb/> RGGI -have also invested in promoting energy efficiency and clean generation technologies.<lb/></p>

			<p>The successful deployment of hydraulic fracturing technologies is contributing to an energy<lb/> renaissance in the United States. Natural gas supply in particular has surged and estimates of potentially<lb/> recoverable natural gas resources have been revised upwards considerably. Developments for crude oil<lb/> have been similar if less spectacular. Against this background, how policy can affect the development of<lb/> natural gas and crude oil deposits acquires some importance. The form of taxation most typically used in<lb/> the United States is the severance tax, more commonly known as a royalty tax. This form of taxation has<lb/> adverse effects on the incentives to developed new reserves and also to abandon wells earlier than they<lb/> would be using other forms of taxation, such as profit taxes, which are neutral to development and<lb/> production.<lb/> 2.<lb/> The analysis in this annex examines the impact of taxation on the addition to natural gas and<lb/> crude oil reserves using US state-level data. This annex contains, first, a description of recent<lb/> developments in natural gas and crude oil reserves. It then briefly examines determinants of oil and gas<lb/> reserve growth. The third section describes the available data and the empirical approach to assessing these<lb/> influences. This is followed by a presentation and brief discussion of the results.<lb/></p>

			<head>Recent reserve developments<lb/></head>

			<p>3.<lb/> Estimates of proved reserves of oil and gas have altered dramatically recently, following the<lb/> successful deployment of new technologies for advanced drilling. The Energy Information Agency<lb/> markedly increased its estimates of recoverable gas resources (<ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>). The addition of new proved<lb/> reserves has maintained the ratio of reserves to production for crude oil, which has been relatively stable<lb/> over a prolonged period. The recent surge in natural gas proved reserves has reversed a prolonged decline<lb/> in the reserves to production ration over the second half of the 20 th century (<ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>).The distribution of<lb/> shale gas deposits across the country is quite widespread, though the proved reserves are predominantly<lb/> located in a handful of states, which is also where the large shale gas plays (i.e. where production is<lb/> occurring) are located. These developments have seen the proved natural gas reserves increase<lb/> significantly in a number of states (<ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>). Recent increases in crude oil reserves have been relatively<lb/> less substantial overall, but within a handful of states (notably Texas, North Dakota) the increases in<lb/> proved reserves of oil is dramatic.<lb/></p>

			<p>4.<lb/> Examining reserve development rather than supply can avoid some of the complications<lb/> presented by the effects of changes to the rate of extraction and the influence of storage on short-run<lb/> supply (<ref type="biblio">Ponce and Neumann, 2014</ref>). The approach adopted here looks at factors influencing the<lb/> development of proved reserves (IEA, 2013). Energy prices will play a role in determining proved reserves<lb/> by affecting the share of already discovered technically feasible reserves that are recoverable given<lb/> extraction and other costs. Prices will also affect the date at which a well is abandoned: other things being<lb/> equal, rising prices are likely to keep a well in production longer.<lb/> 5.<lb/> Empirical findings suggest that natural gas supply is inelastic in the very short run, but is more<lb/> elastic in the longer run (<ref type="biblio">Ponce and Neumann, 2014</ref>). While supply may be relatively inelastic, investment<lb/> in exploration and development appears to react to price changes, as shown by the rapid increase in the<lb/> number of crude oil rotary rigs when relative prices changed for oil and gas (<ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>). In 2007/8 as the<lb/> shale gas boom began to lead to a surge in supply, natural gas prices collapsed while crude oil prices<lb/> continued recovering after the financial crisis, pushing up the relative price of crude oil substantially. Other<lb/> factors may also lead to a structural break in the oil and gas mining sector around this time. The successful<lb/> introduction of hydraulic fracturing may have affected the success of finding reserves. Forbes and <ref type="biblio">Zampelli<lb/> (2002)</ref> argue that deposits in tight sands and shale are easier to locate than conventional reserves and that<lb/> hydrocarbons at shallower depths are more easily discovered.<lb/> 6.<lb/> Besides the physical availability of drilling rigs, the tax regime in place is likely to influence<lb/> incentives for exploration and development of reserves. Andrade de Sá and Daubanes (2014) point out that<lb/> royalty taxes are likely to blunt incentives to develop reserves and also give incentives to abandon wells<lb/> before would be the case with other taxes, such as profit taxes. Royalty (severance) taxes are the<lb/> predominant tax instrument used in the United States for capturing some of the resource rent. Only Alaska<lb/> implements a profits tax (alongside a royalty tax). On the other hand, Pennsylvania does not attempt to tax<lb/> the resource rent from hydraulic fracturing. Taxes on production reported by the BEA for the oil and gas<lb/> mining sector includes severance taxes and also the normal corporate income taxes, which the federal<lb/> authorities levy on all companies. The overall tax take relative to sectoral value added can vary enormously<lb/> across the states, but also across time within states (<ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref>). To some extent these differences will reflect<lb/> the differences in the severance taxes, though variations in tax schedules, such as lower rates offered for<lb/> the use of enhanced recovery techniques, will also play a role. The Census Bureau reports state severance<lb/> tax revenues. However, these revenues are not restricted to oil and gas mining.<lb/></p>

			<head>Estimation and data<lb/></head>

			<p>7.<lb/> The empirical approach adopted is an autoregressive distributed lag (ADRL) model (<ref type="biblio">Pesaran<lb/> et al., 2001</ref>). This approach allows the estimation of a relationship in levels as well as complex short-run<lb/> dynamics and the mixing of series that are stationary and non-stationary. The general form of this model is:<lb/></p>

				<formula>񮽙 񮽙 = = + 񮽙 񮽙<lb/> 񮽙<lb/> + + 񮽙 񮽙<lb/> 񮽙<lb/> + + 񮽙<lb/></formula>

			<p>where Y is the dependent variable and X is a set of explanatory variables. The actual specification used in<lb/> the following analysis exploits the state-level information using a panel data approach, taking the form of<lb/> an unrestricted error correction model with the following specification:<lb/> ∆∆ ,</p>

				<formula>= = + 񮽙 񮽙 ,<lb/> 񮽙<lb/> + + 񮽙 񮽙 ,<lb/> 񮽙<lb/> + + 񮽙 ∆∆ , + 񮽙 ∆∆ , + + 񮽙 +<lb/> 񮽙<lb/> 񮽙񮽙񮽙<lb/> 񮽙<lb/> 񮽙񮽙񮽙<lb/> 񮽙 񮽙񮽙<lb/></formula>

			<p>where Y is the measure of reserves (dry and wet natural gas reserves and crude oil proved reserves) and X<lb/> includes the relevant natural gas or crude oil price, the number of drilling rigs operating in the state and the<lb/> tax revenues in the oil and gas mining sector. The model is estimated with state-level fixed effects to take<lb/> into account unobserved heterogeneity at the state level. As energy prices are not available at the state-<lb/>level, period fixed effects are not used. The lag length is set to one, partly due to the limited number of<lb/> time periods available, but this choice is also supported by the Schwarz criterion for lag length selection.<lb/> 8.<lb/> The addition to reserves is assumed to be driven by energy prices, the exploration and<lb/> development activities and the prevailing tax regime. The data for reserves is taken from the Energy<lb/> Information Agency (EIA) using proved dry natural gas reserves (wet reserves are also used for robustness<lb/> checks) and crude oil for states. Drilling activity at the state level is from Backer Hughes, but this has the<lb/> shortcoming that state level information does not indicate whether the drilling rig is being used for oil or<lb/> natural gas exploration. Information on taxes on production and value added in the sector are from the<lb/></p>

			<p>). Investment in the number of drilling rigs is unsurprisingly associated with reserve growth. Higher<lb/> tax revenues from the oil and gas mining sector slow the development of natural gas reserves. The<lb/> estimates using slightly different measures of reserves and prices are very similar (Column 2 uses wet<lb/> natural gas reserves, while Column 3 reports results when using the Henry Hub natural gas price rather<lb/> than the wellhead price). When the sample is extended to 2011, the statistical significance diminishes,<lb/> though the estimates are quantitatively similar in size. In part, this result is driven by the inclusion of<lb/> Pennsylvania, where exceptionally rapid reserve growth in 2010 and 2011 suggest that a structural break<lb/> occurs when the hydraulic fracturing boom takes hold. Finally, the results reported for crude oil reserves<lb/> are weak, with most variables being statistically insignificant. Dropping the tax variable, so as to estimate<lb/> the equation for a longer time period reveals the expected long-run relationship between reserve and prices<lb/> as well as investment in drilling rigs. The implied long-run elasticity of supply of almost 0.4 is close to<lb/> other estimates (<ref type="biblio">Brook et al, 2004</ref>).<lb/></p>
