			<p>&quot; Fiscal rules &quot; : their impact on sub-central government autonomy .</p>

			<head>.......................................................... 25<lb/> Introduction and Summary<lb/></head>

			<p>1.<lb/> State and local governments in OECD countries have access to a variety of fiscal resources.<lb/> Discretion over these resources varies considerably, and so does sub-central governments&apos; power to shape<lb/> public service delivery. The design of fiscal autonomy affects sub-central government&apos;s behaviour and<lb/> determines outcomes like public sector efficiency, equity in access to public services or the long term fiscal<lb/> stance. Data to compare and assess the revenue structure of state and local governments would therefore be<lb/> helpful. But indicators have long insufficiently reflected the way state and local budgets are funded. The<lb/> main indicator used was the share of tax revenue allocated to sub-central governments, which is a poor<lb/> measure for the rich and complex pattern of their revenue sources. Since the composition of fiscal revenue<lb/> is a crucial indicator for sub-central power and a critical determinant for government finance and other<lb/> outcome variables, a set of more refined indicators for fiscal autonomy should be developed.<lb/></p>

			<p>2.<lb/> This document provides data and interpretation on the fiscal resources of sub-central government<lb/> (SCG) in a majority of OECD countries. The document is organized as follows: the first chapter gives an<lb/> overview on revenue and expenditure decentralisation. The second chapter deals with tax resources for<lb/> SCG and the discretion they can exert over them; this chapter includes a special section on how one may<lb/> distinguish tax sharing arrangements from intergovernmental transfers. The third section deals with<lb/> intergovernmental grants and the different conditions attached to them. The fourth and final chapter<lb/> summarises the previous chapters, presenting a set of fiscal autonomy indicators. Data were collected<lb/> through a questionnaire sent out in 2005 and completed using Revenue Statistics and National Accounts.<lb/> The purpose of this document is twofold: first it presents the newest available data and ways to produce<lb/> them, and second it shows how these data may be used for policy analysis.<lb/> 3.<lb/> The main results can be summarized as follows:<lb/></p>

			<p>• Own taxes are more important a revenue source for sub-central governments than grants. With<lb/> 60 percent against 40 percent, tax revenue accounts for a larger share of SCG revenue than<lb/> intergovernmental grants. Taxes over which SCG have at least some discretion account for the<lb/> largest share of SCG revenue with 38 percent. Earmarked grants follow as the second largest<lb/> category with 22 percent. Non-earmarked grants account for 19 percent, while tax sharing<lb/> arrangements account for 16 percent.<lb/> • A part only of tax revenue allocated to sub-central governments is under their control. Often<lb/> SCG&apos;s power to set and change tax rates and the tax base is restricted. In many federal countries<lb/> and some unitary ones, SCGs take part in tax sharing arrangements where the tax revenue<lb/> allocated to a single jurisdiction is either determined by all SCGs together or by central<lb/> government.<lb/></p>

			<p>• Earmarked grants are more important than non-earmarked ones. The relation between<lb/> earmarked and non-earmarked grants is 60 to 40 percent. Matching grants account for one third<lb/> of all grants. Revenue security is rather high: more than 70 percent of grants are mandatory and<lb/> cannot be changed at short notice by central government. Most grants support current expenditure<lb/> while capital expenditure grants account for a small percentage.<lb/></p>

			<head>•</head>

			<table>The dividing line between tax sharing and grants is sometimes difficult to draw. Reforms to the<lb/> fiscal design sometimes made both tax sharing arrangements and intergovernmental grants look<lb/> very much alike. To keep data comparable, a clear distinction between the two fiscal<lb/> arrangements is necessary. This document proposes a set of distinctive features that allow a<lb/> dividing line to be drawn. Current data are based on countries&apos; own assessment.<lb/> • The correlation between different indicators of fiscal autonomy is weak. Countries with a similar<lb/> SCG tax share may permit very different discretion over this share. Some countries combine a<lb/> large tax share with a small share of intergovernmental grants; in other countries both types of<lb/> fiscal resource are significant. Tax autonomy and fiscal rules stringency are unrelated. In sum,<lb/> there is no single pattern of sub-central fiscal design.<lb/></table>

			<head>Decentralisation ratios<lb/></head>

			<p>4.<lb/> Fiscal autonomy is part of the institutional arrangement – such as responsibility and revenue<lb/> assignment -in which the different levels of government operate. A common way to compare and assess<lb/> fiscal autonomy is the extent to which resources and responsibilities are under the control of local and<lb/> regional governments. SCG tax and expenditure indicators (or &quot; decentralization ratios &quot; ) can help to assess<lb/> fiscal decentralization and its evolution over time. While these indicators can hardly capture the<lb/> complexity and multidimensionality of fiscal arrangements, they can give a first impression of how much<lb/> power SCGs enjoy. The following figures show the current state of financial decentralization as measured<lb/> by sub-central government shares of total tax revenue and expenditure in OECD countries (<ref type="figure">figure 1</ref>) and<lb/> the evolution of these indicators over the last decade (<ref type="figure">figure 2</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<p>5.<lb/> The stylized facts shown in these figures can be summarized as follows:<lb/></p>

			<p>• The degree of decentralization varies greatly across OECD countries. While the sub-central share<lb/> of total government expenditures varies from less than 6 percent to more than 60 percent, taxes<lb/> accruing to sub-central governments extend between 3 and 50 percent. The constitutional<lb/> background of a country – whether it is federal or unitary – says little about actual fiscal<lb/> autonomy. Local governments in some unitary countries have a higher share in public spending<lb/> than local and regional governments together in federal countries.<lb/> • The sub-central tax share and the sub-central expenditure share have diverged over the last ten<lb/> years. While the share of sub-national expenditures generally increased, local taxing power -with<lb/> a few notable exceptions –remained almost stable. The rising expenditure share partly reflects<lb/> new responsibilities assigned to sub-central governments such as health care and/or non-<lb/>university education in Italy, Mexico and Spain, or active labour market policies in Canada. In<lb/> the US, the states took over full responsibilities for a number of programmes formerly supported<lb/> by the federation. On the other hand, local taxing power was reduced in many countries, such as<lb/> in France or Japan, where local taxes were replaced by intergovernmental transfers.<lb/></p>

			<p>• In most countries, sub-central government expenditures by far exceed tax revenue, and this<lb/> &quot; fiscal gap &quot; has widened in the last decade. The difference between responsibilities and resources<lb/> points to large intergovernmental transfer schemes. In general, the fiscal gap tends to be larger in<lb/> countries with high sub-central fiscal autonomy, i.e. local and regional jurisdictions with a large<lb/> tax share depend more heavily on transfers (Canada, Denmark, and – not shown in <ref type="figure">figure 1</ref> –<lb/> Switzerland); somewhat paradoxically, more decentralization can go hand in hand with more<lb/> dependency on central government resources. Size and structure of intergovernmental grants thus<lb/> become a particular issue in a decentralized environment.<lb/> 6.<lb/> A serious problem with these simple ratios, however, is that they only poorly measure the true<lb/> degree of autonomy that SCG enjoy in practice. On the revenue side, limits to set own local tax bases, rates<lb/> and reliefs reduce local fiscal autonomy. On the expenditure side, local spending may be strongly<lb/> influenced by upper level government regulation, thereby reducing discretion over various expenditure<lb/> items. In some countries, the transfer of financial responsibility for education or health care was hardly<lb/> more than a change in accounting procedures, while essential regulatory responsibilities remained with the<lb/> central government. Moreover, the various strings and conditions attached to intergovernmental transfers<lb/> may further influence the spending pattern of sub-central governments. To have a more accurate picture of<lb/> sub-central fiscal autonomy, a more detailed set of indicators is required.<lb/></p>

			<head>Revenue structure of sub-central governments<lb/></head>

			<p>7.<lb/> Sub-central governments (SCG) rely on own tax revenue, shared taxes and intergovernmental<lb/> grants. In table 1, the three main categories of fiscal revenue are put together, to allow for an overall<lb/> assessment and comparison of SCG fiscal structure. In order to facilitate the lecture of the table, grant and<lb/> tax categories developed further down this document are aggregated. Finally nine categories encompass<lb/> the different revenue sources available to local and regional governments. As for all other statistics in this<lb/> document, borrowing and fees are not included due to the lack of comparable data.<lb/> 8.<lb/> With an un-weighted average of roughly 60 percent against 40 percent, tax revenue accounts for<lb/> a larger share of SCG revenue than intergovernmental grants. With 38 percent autonomous taxes are the<lb/> single largest category of total SCG revenue. Earmarked grants follow as the second largest category with<lb/> 22 percent, indicating that more than one fifth of total revenue is largely outside the discretion of sub-<lb/>central governments. Non-earmarked grants account for 19 percent, while tax sharing arrangements –<lb/> widely used in constitutionally federal countries – account for 16 percent. Countries with tax sharing<lb/> arrangements have a smaller grant system and vice versa, suggesting some substitutability between the two<lb/> fiscal arrangements. Again there is wide variation between countries; while for some tiers own tax revenue<lb/> accounts for the overwhelming part (Canada states, Switzerland states), for others it is tax sharing<lb/> (Australia states, Austria local, Germany states, Czech Republic), for others again it is either earmarked or<lb/> non-earmarked grants (Greece, Mexico, Netherlands).<lb/></p>

			<head>A taxonomy of tax autonomy: history and indicator set<lb/></head>

			<p>9.<lb/> The term &quot; tax autonomy &quot; captures various aspects of freedom sub-central governments have over<lb/> their own taxes. It encompasses features such as sub-central government&apos;s right to introduce or to abolish a<lb/> tax, to set tax rates, to define the tax base, or to grant tax allowances or reliefs to individuals and firms. In a<lb/> number of countries taxes are not assigned to one specific government level but shared between the central<lb/> and sub-central governments. Such tax sharing arrangements deny a single SCG any control on tax rates<lb/> and bases, but collectively SCGs may negotiate the sharing formula with central government. The wealth<lb/> of explicit and implicit, statutory and common, institutional arrangements has to be encompassed by a set<lb/> of indicators that are simultaneously appropriate (they capture the relevant aspects of tax autonomy),<lb/> accurate (they measure those aspects correctly) and reliable (the indicator set remains stable over time).<lb/> The first indicator set on tax autonomy was published in 1999 (<ref type="biblio">OECD, 1999</ref>), and in 2005 the exercise was<lb/> repeated and extended (see box 1).<lb/></p>

			<head>A short history of taxing power indicators<lb/></head>

			<p>In the late 1990s the Working Party on Tax Policy Analysis and Tax Statistics of the OECD Committee on Fiscal<lb/> Affairs regarded the data on the taxing power of sub-central governments as utterly insufficient. The commonly used<lb/> ratio &quot; sub-central to total tax revenue &quot; was considered a poor measure for assessing taxing power since it did (and<lb/> does) not account for the effective discretion or control available to state and local governments. In 1997 the Working<lb/> Party therefore decided to set up a more detailed database. It established a set of categories -or taxonomy – to<lb/> account for the various institutional arrangements governing sub central taxing power. Tax autonomy was divided into<lb/> five categories, from full discretion over tax rates and bases to no discretion at all over any tax variable. In addition the<lb/> category &quot; tax sharing arrangements &quot; was divided into four subcategories that represent different power of SCG in<lb/> collectively determining and changing their own share. Data were collected through a questionnaire and for the year<lb/> 1995. 19 countries participated to the work whose results were published in 1999 (The taxing power of state and local<lb/> governments &quot; , <ref type="biblio">OECD 1999)<lb/></ref> In 2003 the newly created Network on Fiscal Relations across Levels of Government set out to repeat the<lb/> exercise, in order to assess how tax autonomy had evolved over time and how important it was in countries not<lb/> covered in 1999. In the light of the 1999 results, the taxonomy was refined and extended. The Network Secretariat<lb/> divided the various tax autonomy arrangements into five categories reflecting to what extent SCG had the right to<lb/> change the local tax base or tax rates, whether they needed approval from upper level governments to do so, or<lb/> whether local tax resources were embedded in national tax sharing arrangements. The Secretariat collected data for<lb/> the year 2002, which allowed evaluating the change of sub central tax autonomy over a period of seven years. The<lb/> results of this exercise are presented in this document.<lb/> 10.<lb/> The framework for both the 1999 and 2005 indicator set consists of five main categories of<lb/> autonomy (<ref type="table">table 2</ref>). Categories are ranked in decreasing order from highest to lowest taxing power.<lb/> Category &quot; a &quot; represents full power over tax rates and bases, &quot; b &quot; power over tax rates (essentially<lb/> representing the &quot; piggy-packing &quot; type of tax), &quot; c &quot; power over the tax base, &quot; d &quot; tax sharing arrangements,<lb/> and &quot; e &quot; no power on rates and bases at all. Category &quot; f &quot; represents non-allocable taxes. In order to better<lb/> capture the more refined institutional details the five categories were further divided into subcategories:<lb/> two for the &quot; a &quot; and &quot; b &quot; categories, and three for the &quot; c &quot; category. Special attention was paid to tax sharing<lb/> arrangements, where the four &quot; d &quot; subcategories are thought to represent the many different rules and<lb/> institutions for governments to determine and change their own share. Altogether 13 categories were<lb/> established to capture the various tax autonomy arrangements in OECD countries. Where applicable,<lb/> countries were asked to send separate data for both the state/regional and the local level. 24 countries<lb/> responded to the questionnaire, five more than in 1999. Since category six &quot; non allocable &quot; was hardly<lb/> used, the taxing power universe seems to be well reflected in this taxonomy.<lb/></p>

			<head>Level and evolution of taxing power<lb/></head>

			<p>11.<lb/> The stylized facts on taxing power of state and local governments in 2002 can be summarized as<lb/> follows (<ref type="table">table 3</ref>) 1 :<lb/></p>

			<p>• First, although tax autonomy varies widely across countries, most sub-central governments have<lb/> considerable discretion over their own taxes. At the average, the tax revenue share with full or<lb/> partial discretion (categories a, b and c) amounts to almost 60 percent for state and more than 70<lb/> percent for local government. In many countries (not shown in the table), permitted maximum tax<lb/> rates often double minimum rate.<lb/> • Second, categories a, b and c put together, state and regional governments have less discretion<lb/> over their tax revenue than local governments, since their tax revenue is often embedded in tax<lb/> sharing arrangements. On the other hand, with 51 percent of SCG tax revenue, the state level has<lb/> a higher share in high-powered autonomous taxes (category &quot; a &quot; ), while local governments are<lb/> often allowed to levy a supplement on selected regional or central taxes only (category &quot; b &quot; or<lb/> &quot; piggy-packing &quot; tax).<lb/> • Third, the c category (representing control over the tax base but not the tax rate) plays a very<lb/> small role in OECD countries. This probably points to a policy of gradually banning tax reliefs<lb/> and abatements as a tool for local and regional economic development, particularly in the<lb/> European Union.<lb/></p>

			<p>In some countries, SCG have the right to vary tax rates but actually set the same rate across the<lb/> country. Such &quot; unused taxing power &quot; invites a deeper look into fiscal institutions and the incentives they<lb/> generate for tax competition.<lb/> 13.<lb/> Tax sharing agreements account for a large part of sub central tax revenue in most<lb/> constitutionally federal countries (Austria, Belgium, Germany, Mexico, Italy), in constitutionally non-<lb/>federal Spain, in the Czech Republic and in Poland. Tax sharing is often considered as providing a balance<lb/> between granting local/regional fiscal autonomy and keeping the overall fiscal framework stable. In such<lb/> an arrangement a single SCG cannot set tax rates and bases, but SCGs together may have the power to<lb/> negotiate their common share. This power varies considerably across countries, from arrangements where<lb/> sub-central governments are in full control over their share, to arrangements where the share is unilaterally<lb/> set and modified by the central government. Often the distribution formula is enshrined in the constitution<lb/> and can only be changed with the consent of all or a majority of sub-central governments. In other<lb/> countries amendments to the sharing formula are easier to obtain, either with or without prior negotiation<lb/> involving sub-central governments. In some cases the institutional set up makes it difficult to decide<lb/> whether an arrangement is tax sharing or intergovernmental transfer; this issue will be dealt with in the<lb/> next section.<lb/> 14.<lb/> While the share of SCG tax revenue remained almost stable, taxing power increased from 1995 to<lb/> 2002 (<ref type="table">table 4</ref>). For the 17 countries where time series is available, tax revenue share rose by 0.6 percent<lb/> points for the state level and remained stable for local governments. In Spain and Poland SCG tax revenue<lb/> increased by more than 10 percentage points, while it decreased considerably in Mexico and Japan. But,<lb/> interestingly, the share of tax revenue over which SCG have full or partial discretion rose. States and<lb/> regions gained more tax autonomy than local governments, revealed by the increase of category &quot; a &quot; tax<lb/> revenue. Tax sharing agreements lost significance in countries such as Austria, Belgium, Germany, Mexico<lb/> or Spain, mostly in favour of taxes with more autonomy. In Norway, local governments gained some<lb/> autonomy over income taxes, while in Austria and Germany, they lost. In some countries (e.g. France and<lb/> Sweden) the central government is required to compensate the loss of sub-central tax revenue through<lb/> additional transfers; this effect is not shown in table 3.<lb/> 15.<lb/> The forces shaping the evolution of SCG tax revenue and tax autonomy are political, fiscal and<lb/> economic in nature.<lb/> • First and probably most important are policy reforms such as a reassignment of taxes to another<lb/> government level, a change in tax autonomy or a swap between local/regional taxes and<lb/> intergovernmental grants. Constitutional and legislative amendments largely account for the rapid<lb/> change in countries such as Belgium or Spain involved in a secular decentralization process.<lb/> • Second, fiscal reasons such as a relative change in tax rates or bases can also affect the pattern of<lb/> taxing power, e.g. if one government level changes its tax rate or base while another government<lb/> level does not. In many countries rates and base of local property taxes remain unchanged over<lb/> long periods of time, while the bases of central government income taxes or goods and services<lb/> taxes are regularly updated.<lb/> • Third, different taxes react differently to the business cycle or to structural change, and this may<lb/> affect tax revenue of different government levels. A local profit tax reacts more swiftly to an<lb/> economic downturn than a central government income tax, and a local sales tax on goods reacts<lb/> more slowly to the rise of the service sector than a central value added tax.<lb/> 16.<lb/> Altogether, the net effect of the three forces during the 1995 to 2002 period tended to favour sub-<lb/>central government&apos;s tax base slightly. For most of them no tax erosion could be detected, either in terms<lb/> of the revenue share or in terms of discretion. However, the tax share must be set against the expenditure<lb/> share, which increased in the same period (<ref type="figure">figure 2</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<head>Tax autonomy across tax category<lb/></head>

			<p>17.<lb/> The data on tax autonomy by tax type defy the beliefs on optimal local taxation (<ref type="table">table 5</ref>). While<lb/> fiscal federal theory asserts that mobile taxes should be allocated to higher levels of government, in<lb/> practice the largest single tax assigned to local and regional governments is the highly mobile income tax<lb/> on individuals, with more than 36 percent of total SCG tax revenue. If local corporate taxes are added, the<lb/> share rises to more than 41 percent. Taxes on goods and account for 21 percent of total SCG tax revenue.<lb/> Taxes on immovable property account for 19 percent only. Although most OECD countries apply some<lb/> sub-central property taxation, its yield is often limited and supplemented or even replaced by other taxes<lb/> such as a local income tax. In more decentralized countries, local income tax revenue largely exceeds local<lb/> property tax revenue. While income taxes may have general negative impacts on labour supply, it appears<lb/> that government succeeded in tackling the specific drawbacks for local government – e.g. their mobility -<lb/>using policies such as tax sharing arrangements or fiscal equalisation schemes.<lb/> 18.<lb/> A closer look at the table reveals that autonomy varies according to tax type. Property taxes are<lb/> usually assigned more discretion than other taxes, with almost all tax revenue in category a and b. Around<lb/> a fourth of income tax revenue is embedded in tax sharing systems, that restrict a single SCG&apos;s control<lb/> over this tax. Since many income tax sharing arrangements include fiscal equalization, they counteract<lb/> potential drawbacks, such as excessive tax competition, of local income taxation. The right to set tax rates<lb/> and bases does not mean that SCG actually make use of this right; in some countries tax rates appear to<lb/> vary very little or not at all across regions. Currently no data is available on the actual range of SCG tax<lb/> rates, however. It could therefore be rewarding to have data on actual tax rate variations, to have a closer<lb/> look at how fiscal design actually shapes sub-central behaviour with respect to tax rates, and how fiscal<lb/> policy can preserve local taxing powers and at the same reduce fiscal disparities.<lb/></p>

			<head>Tax sharing arrangements<lb/></head>

			<p>19.<lb/> Tax sharing is an arrangement where tax revenue is divided vertically between the central and<lb/> sub-central governments as well as horizontally across sub-central governments. In a tax sharing<lb/> arrangement, the individual SCG has no power to set tax rates or bases; however SCGs may collectively<lb/> negotiate policy reforms such as change to the sharing formula or to the tax rates. Often tax sharing<lb/> arrangements contain an element of horizontal fiscal equalization. Tax sharing has become a means to<lb/> provide fiscal resources to sub-central governments while maintaining central control over fiscal<lb/> aggregates. Tax sharing typically involves less autonomy on the part of sub-central governments than<lb/> autonomous taxes, and it may also change SCGs&apos;&apos; fiscal behaviour. By turning SCG tax revenue into a<lb/> common pool resource for all government levels, tax sharing may change fiscal incentives and the<lb/> resulting fiscal outcomes. For both statistical and analytical reasons, a careful distinction between both<lb/> forms of sub-central tax revenue allocation is therefore necessary.<lb/> 20.<lb/> Tax sharing arrangements can be analyzed on various grounds: the type of tax that is shared, the<lb/> legal procedures involved in changing the formula, the frequency of an adjustment to the formula, and<lb/> whether the sharing formula contributes to an equalizing objective (table 6).<lb/></p>

			<p>Note: PIT=Personal Income Tax, CIT=Corporate Income Tax, VAT=Value Added Tax<lb/> 21.<lb/> Most tax sharing arrangements cover major taxes such as personal income taxes, corporate<lb/> income taxes or value added taxes. Their high yield makes them attractive for SCGs, and the pooling<lb/> tackles potential drawbacks of purely local taxation. The procedure for changing the sharing formula is<lb/> mostly laid down in laws on tax sharing, fiscal equalization or the like. For the countries under scrutiny,<lb/> decisions on the tax sharing arrangements seem to be taken at the parliamentary level; in some countries<lb/> the share is defined in the constitution and adjustments require a qualified majority in parliament.<lb/> Consultation of SCG is quite frequent, but their explicit consent for adjustments is needed in some federal<lb/> countries only. The frequency and regularity of formula adjustment varies across countries, from irregular<lb/> to never, but it appears that tax sharing arrangements are a comparatively stable item in national fiscal<lb/> policy. Finally, some countries redistribute tax revenue from affluent to poorer jurisdictions; hence those<lb/> countries combine tax sharing and fiscal equalization in one single arrangement.<lb/></p>

			<head>Tax sharing and intergovernmental grants: a first attempt to draw a dividing line<lb/></head>

			<p>22.<lb/> Both tax sharing arrangements (category &quot; d &quot; of tax autonomy) and intergovernmental grants<lb/> provide resources to SCG. Drawing the dividing line between the two fiscal arrangements proves<lb/> sometimes difficult. On one hand, many tax sharing formulae have become so complex that they break the<lb/> link between what a SCG collects on its territory, what it sends into the common pool and what it finally<lb/> gets back. On the other hand, policy reforms have made some intergovernmental grants more look like a<lb/> share in the national tax yield. While the National Accounts and the Revenue Statistics provide some<lb/> guidelines, in practice what counts as tax sharing in one country may count as intergovernmental grant in<lb/> another; within some countries even, different central government bodies have adopted different views on<lb/> how to classify fiscal resources (e.g. Australia or Belgium). . Such lack of clarity jeopardizes the coherence<lb/> of SCG revenue statistics, reduces strength and utility of fiscal design analysis and impairs the<lb/> comparability of true fiscal autonomy. In order to ensure that fiscal arrangements are recorded properly<lb/> and on a comparative basis, a set of distinctive criteria is required.<lb/> 23.<lb/> In the following, we propose criteria that enable a dividing line to be drawn between the two<lb/> fiscal arrangements more clearly. These criteria include the revenue risk that sub-central governments are<lb/> exposed to, the freedom of use of the revenue obtained, the rules and formulas that define the distribution<lb/> of financial revenue, and the institutional decision mechanisms that define each SCG&apos;s annual share. Using<lb/> the concepts of vertical and horizontal distribution, we then propose asking a sequence of interrelated<lb/> question where each answer allows determining more precisely whether the fiscal arrangement is a tax<lb/> sharing or a grant. To be considered as tax sharing, an arrangement must cumulatively fulfil all<lb/> requirements, i.e. all questions must be answered with a &quot; yes &quot; .<lb/> • First question: Can sub-central governments freely use the tax revenue allocated to them? In<lb/> other words, is the revenue earmarked or not? If the revenue is entirely unconditional, it can still<lb/> be considered a tax sharing. If sub-central governments are not allowed to spend the revenue<lb/> freely, the arrangement should be considered a grant.<lb/></p>

			<p>• Second question: Is the amount of revenue allocated to the sub-central level a fixed proportion of<lb/> the total revenue from the shared tax(es)? In other words, does the sub-central level of<lb/> government fully bear the risk of revenue fluctuations? If SCG bear the full revenue risk, the<lb/> arrangement may still be considered a tax sharing. If the arrangement contains some<lb/> compensation for the revenue risk or a formula that compensates for fluctuations, the<lb/> arrangement has to be considered a grant.<lb/></p>

			<head>• Third question:</head>

			<p>Is the revenue share between the central and the sub-central government<lb/> predetermined (by the government, by national parliaments) and unable to be changed in the<lb/> course of a fiscal year? If the revenue share is predetermined, the arrangement may be considered<lb/> tax sharing. If not, it is considered a grant.<lb/> 24.<lb/> The first three steps, which mainly put emphasis on the vertical distribution, should allow for<lb/> clear-cut answers. Moreover, they do not contradict the procedure the National Accounts apply when<lb/> recording SCG tax revenue, and the criteria established by the Council of Europe.<lb/> 25.<lb/> The fourth step or question is more difficult since it deals with horizontal distribution of tax<lb/> revenue. Certainly an arrangement that reimburses the tax revenue to the jurisdiction from where it was<lb/> collected should be considered tax sharing. But many arrangements redistribute tax revenue across SCGs<lb/> in a way that loosens the link between a jurisdiction&apos;s contribution to and its final return from the tax<lb/> sharing mechanism. In order to allow for redistributive tax sharing arrangements, but to exclude<lb/> redistributive arrangements not linked to tax issues, we propose to ask the fourth question as follows:<lb/></p>

			<p>• Fourth question: Is the formula that defines the horizontal distribution of the revenue (i.e. the<lb/> distribution across jurisdictions of the same government level) based on one of the following<lb/> rules:<lb/> − the revenue is returned to the region from where it was collected, or<lb/> − the tax is returned either on a per capita or a per employee basis, or<lb/> − the tax is redistributed inversely related to tax raising capacity, i.e. SCG with a lower tax<lb/> raising capacity receive a higher per capita share than SCG with a higher tax raising capacity.<lb/> If revenue is distributed according to one of these rules, we propose to consider the arrangement<lb/> a tax sharing. If the redistribution formula contains indicators other than tax revenue collected,<lb/> population, employees, or tax raising capacity, the arrangement should be rather considered a<lb/> grant.<lb/> 26.<lb/> If all questions are answered with a &quot; yes &quot; , a fiscal arrangement can be viably considered a tax<lb/> sharing arrangement. A fiscal arrangement between levels of government can be thus called tax sharing if<lb/> the amount going to each government level is a strict share of total tax revenue, if this share is predefined<lb/> and cannot be changed in the course of the fiscal year, if the revenue for SCG is not earmarked, and if the<lb/> revenue allocated to a single SCG either corresponds to the revenue it has collected, or is distributed across<lb/> jurisdictions according to population, employees, or inversely related to tax raising capacity. For future<lb/> data collection exercises, it is proposed that countries indicate whether they agree on these criteria.<lb/></p>

			<head>Intergovernmental transfers<lb/></head>

			<p>27.<lb/> Intergovernmental transfers (or grants) provide sub-central governments with additional financial<lb/> resources, thus filling the gap between own tax revenue and expenditure needs. The main objectives for<lb/> intergovernmental grants can be roughly divided into: funding of SCG services, the subsidization of SCG<lb/> services, and the equalisation of fiscal disparities; often these reasons overlap. A flowering garden of<lb/> intergovernmental grants has evolved, with grants having different purposes and different effects on sub-<lb/>central governments&apos; behaviour. Rules and conditions attached to intergovernmental grants vary widely,<lb/> ranging from transfers that grant full autonomy and come close to tax sharing, to grants where central<lb/> government retains tight control over their use. The following statistics give an overview on grants from a<lb/> donors&apos;perspective, a classification of grants according to the various strings attached to them, and the<lb/> policy areas for which grants are predominantly used.<lb/></p>

			<head>Donors and recipients of grants<lb/></head>

			<p>28.<lb/> <ref type="table">Table 7</ref> shows a simplified version of the National Accounts donor/recipient matrix of<lb/> intergovernmental grants, with five donor levels (central, state, local, international and social security) and<lb/> – depending on the country type – one or two recipient levels (local, or state and local). The category<lb/> &quot; international &quot; displays funds directly allocated to SCG in some countries 2 . On the average, grants account<lb/> for 26 percent of total tax revenue 3 ; with Mexico having the largest grant system and Iceland having the<lb/> smallest in relative terms. With 72 percent central government provides the overwhelming part of grants to<lb/> local governments in both federal and unitary countries. In federal countries the central level is the main<lb/> provider for states and regions with 86 percent. In the majority of federal countries (Belgium, Canada,<lb/> Germany, Switzerland) is state government the main source for local governments. 2.7 percent of all grants<lb/> flow between states/regions (e.g. Belgium and Switzerland) and 2.5 percent between local governments<lb/> (e.g. Austria, Korea and Switzerland), pointing at various horizontal agreements or horizontal fiscal<lb/> equalization schemes. However, such arrangements are not always recorded properly in National Accounts<lb/> and revenue statistics.<lb/> 29.<lb/> In the period 2000 to 2004, the share of grants to total tax revenue remained almost stable with a<lb/> -0.2 percentage points decrease for grants to states and a 0.2 percentage point increase for grants to local<lb/> governments (table 8). However, average figures conceal that almost three quarters of countries<lb/> experienced an above-average growth of transfers, with the Czech Republic at the top with a 6.8<lb/> percentage point increase. Grants from the central government, by far the most significant donor, rose<lb/> annually by 6.4 percent for states and 8.3 percent for local governments, slightly exceeding the growth rate<lb/> of total tax revenue. Social Security appears to be losing its importance as a source for SCG fiscal revenue,<lb/> while the international level emerges in the European Union as a source for regional government finance.<lb/> Grants to local governments are evolving with wide variations, with annual growth rates ranging between<lb/> 30 percent in the Czech Republic and -2.3 percent in Norway. While large changes mostly reflect<lb/> institutional reforms such as responsibility reassignment or a swap between tax revenue and grants, a more<lb/> gradual increase could go back to increased demand for co-funding at the sub-central level.<lb/> 2.<lb/> The central government figures for Greece include EU grants. In other countries, grants are directly paid to<lb/> the receiving sub-central government.<lb/></p>

type="figure">figure 3</ref>) 4 . The main dividing line separates earmarked from non-earmarked grants where SCGs<lb/> have to use earmarked grants for a specific purpose while they may spend non-earmarked grants freely.<lb/> This distinction is crucial for assessing the true fiscal autonomy of SCG. Both types of grants can be<lb/> divided further into mandatory and discretionary transfers, reflecting the legal background that governs<lb/> their allocation. Earmarked grants may be further subdivided into matching and non-matching grants, i.e.<lb/> whether the transfer is linked to SCG own expenditure or not. A final subdivision is between grants for<lb/> capital expenditure and grants for current expenditure. On the non-earmarked side grants may be further<lb/> subdivided into block and general purpose grants, where the latter provide more freedom of use; since both<lb/> forms are unconditional, the distinction often collapses 5 . The taxonomy is consistent with the one<lb/> established by the Council of Europe.<lb/></p>

			<figure>Figure 3: A taxonomy of grants<lb/> Grants<lb/> Non-earmarked<lb/> General purpose grant<lb/> Earmarked<lb/> Non-matching grant<lb/> Mandatory<lb/> Discretionary<lb/> Mandatory<lb/> Discretionary<lb/> Block grant<lb/> Matching grant<lb/> Capital grants<lb/> Current grants<lb/> 31.<lb/> With a relation of roughly 60 to 40 percent, earmarked grants account for a larger portion than<lb/> non-earmarked grants (table <ref type="table">9</ref>). This means that central governments still have a strong impact on SCG<lb/> budgets and selected expenditure items. It is slightly surprising to see that earmarked grants, and hence<lb/> central control, are more important for state and regional governments than for local governments. Around<lb/> a third of all earmarked grants is matching, i.e. linked to SCG own expenditure. Through lowering the<lb/> price of local and regional public services matching grants are thought to foster spending, but by doing this<lb/> may put some pressure on both central and sub-central budgets. Around three quarters of all earmarked<lb/> grants are mandatory, giving SCG more revenue security but leaving less scope for central governments to<lb/> adjust expenditures rapidly to overall fiscal conditions.

			<p>). This evolution could mean that matching grants indeed exert some pressure on government<lb/> budgets. The share of non earmarked grants has slightly increased, pointing at more fiscal leeway for SCG,<lb/> whereby the local level has benefited more than the state and regional level. Structural change varies<lb/> widely across countries. In Belgium discretionary grants heavily increased at the expense of mandatory<lb/> grants at the local level. In the Czech Republic discretionary grants also increased markedly. The Spanish<lb/> regions increased their share of non earmarked grants.<lb/></p>

			<head>Grants by government function<lb/></head>

			<p>33.<lb/> Grants are used for different policy areas or government functions (<ref type="table">table 11</ref>). The National<lb/> Accounts divide government activities into ten functions in the so-called Classification of Functions of<lb/> Government (COFOG), and this division is also applied to intergovernmental grants. Data are available<lb/> only for earmarked grants because unconditional grants are not tied to specific government functions.<lb/> While National Accounts data are available for eight countries, the questionnaire asked all countries to<lb/> provide data with the same precision as provided by the National Accounts. In the end the data of eleven<lb/> countries could be used to assess and compare the functional structure of intergovernmental grants.<lb/> 34.<lb/> The category &quot; general public services &quot; accounts for the largest, rather unspecific share of<lb/> intergovernmental transfers. Education is the second largest category, pointing at the weight of local and<lb/> regional governments in providing primary and secondary education, with central government retaining<lb/> considerable control over funding and regulation. &quot; Economic affairs &quot; is the third largest category, largely<lb/> reflecting the weight of shared responsibilities in local and regional development policy. Again the grant<lb/> structure varies widely, reflecting the different responsibility assignments and funding arrangements in<lb/> countries. In general, except for &quot; defence &quot; and &quot; public order and safety &quot; , some degree of responsibility<lb/> sharing and overlapping characterizes most government functions. However, the low number of country<lb/> responses does not yet allow for stringent conclusions.<lb/></p>

			<figure>Fiscal autonomy: a multi-faceted concept<lb/> Fiscal autonomy indicator set<lb/> 35.<lb/> Fiscal autonomy is multi-faceted and must be assessed using several distinct indicators. The<lb/> following table provides a summary of all autonomy indicators developed in the course of this document<lb/> (table 12</figure>

			<p>). Indicators include the share of tax revenue allocated to sub-central governments, the discretion<lb/> over those taxes, the share of transfers allocated to sub-central governments and the percentage of<lb/> earmarked transfers. Although not treated in this document, two indicators for fiscal rules are added,<lb/> reflecting, respectively, the right to run deficits and the right to borrow (see box).<lb/></p>

			<figure>&quot; Fiscal rules &quot; : their impact on sub-central government autonomy<lb/></figure>

			<p>Rules constraining the discretionary power of sub-central budget policymakers have become quite widespread<lb/> among OECD economies. While fiscal rules for sub-central governments can be a means to achieve sustainable long-<lb/>term aggregate finance, they reduce the power governments have over their own budget. The same fiscal rules can<lb/> therefore be viewed from both a &quot; stringency &quot; and an &quot; autonomy &quot; perspective; with a more stringent rule assumed to<lb/> reduce the discretion a SCG has over its budget or selected budget items.<lb/></p>

			<p>In order to assess the extent SCG fiscal autonomy is constrained by fiscal rules, two indicators for fiscal rules<lb/> stringency were calculated for the Fiscal Network (Sutherland, Price and Joumard, OECD Economics Department<lb/> Working Paper 465). A simple linear transformation of these indicators yields &quot; fiscal rule autonomy &quot; indicators. The<lb/> &quot; fiscal rule autonomy&quot; indicators have the same dimensions as the other fiscal autonomy indicators shown in table 12<lb/> and the same meaning, i.e. the higher the value, the more lenient the respective rule and the higher sub-central budget<lb/> autonomy.<lb/></p>

			<p>The seventh indicator &quot; share of autonomous SCG tax revenue &quot; is the product of the SCG own tax revenue<lb/> share and the autonomy over those taxes; this product comes closest to what one could call a composite<lb/> indicator of revenue autonomy. Correlation between all indicators is very weak, and statistical concepts<lb/> like factor analysis fail to produce a single &quot; summary indicator of sub-central fiscal autonomy &quot; 6 .<lb/></p>

			<head>A few (non)correlations among fiscal autonomy indicators<lb/></head>

			<p>37.<lb/> As described above, the various indicators for fiscal autonomy are not or only weakly correlated,<lb/> pointing at the multidimensionality of fiscal autonomy and the great diversity of fiscal institutions in<lb/> OECD countries. Some of these non-correlations are interesting from a policy perspective since they may<lb/> either support or contradict a number of beliefs on the relationship between policy variables in the area of<lb/> decentralized public finance. The following scatter diagrams show a number of simple two-dimensional<lb/> relationships.<lb/></p>

			<p>• The first scatter diagram shows the relationship between the share of sub-central tax revenue and<lb/> the degree of autonomy over these taxes. The share of SCG&apos;s own tax revenue is hardly related to<lb/> their autonomy over those taxes. While in some countries SCGs have wide discretion over a<lb/> small tax base, in some other countries with large tax sharing arrangements autonomy has been<lb/> reduced to virtually zero. The picture again supports the view that a simple share of tax revenue<lb/> is a poor measure to assess true fiscal autonomy of sub-central governments and that for<lb/> analytical purposes – e.g. assessing the impact of decentralization on aggregate finance -more<lb/> sophisticated indicators should be used.<lb/></p>

			<p>• The second scatter diagram shows the relationship between the share of sub-central tax revenue<lb/> and the size of the grant system. While fiscal policy could substitute own tax revenue for<lb/> intergovernmental grants and vice versa, there is actually no relationship between the two fiscal<lb/> arrangements. While in some countries small local tax revenue meets with a small grant system,<lb/> others combine large local tax revenue with a large fiscal gap and an extended transfer system to<lb/> cover it. Only unconditional grants (not shown in the figure) and own tax revenue seem to be<lb/> substitutes, which points to the close relationship between tax sharing and grants arrangements.<lb/> Policy makers might actually be interested to know how and under what conditions increased<lb/> sub-central tax autonomy can reduce the need for intergovernmental transfers. Panel data and a<lb/> deeper look into the design of intergovernmental fiscal institutions could reveal the dynamics<lb/> between SCG tax revenue and grants.<lb/></p>

			<p>• The third scatter diagram shows the relationship between the share of sub-central tax revenue and<lb/> the extent to which SCG are allowed to run deficits. This figure actually assesses whether<lb/> countries with high sub-central taxing power apply stricter rules on fiscal behaviour. The lack of<lb/> a close relationship suggests that in practice fiscal rules are neither a substitute nor a complement<lb/> for SCG autonomy. Some countries grant SCG large tax autonomy but little budget autonomy,<lb/> others are likely to do the reverse, while some countries restrict both forms of fiscal autonomy.<lb/> Large local and regional tax autonomy is neither coupled to strict nor to lenient fiscal rules.<lb/> 38.<lb/> Any conclusion with respect to the relationship between different fiscal autonomy indicators<lb/> must be taken with great care since those indicators represent only one point in time. To assess the<lb/> dynamics between different autonomy indicators one needs to observe fiscal design and its outcome over<lb/> several time periods. What those indicators primarily say is that the design of fiscal relations across levels<lb/> of governments varies greatly across countries and that no single pattern of local and regional finance has<lb/> yet emerged.</p>
