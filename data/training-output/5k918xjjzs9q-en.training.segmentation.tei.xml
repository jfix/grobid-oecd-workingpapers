			<body>ABSTRACT/RESUMÉ <lb/>Portugal: Rebalancing the economy and returning to growth through job creation and better capital allocation <lb/>Low growth and huge current account deficits have characterised the Portuguese economy over the past decade. Easy credit <lb/>in global markets, combined with the absence of incentives to limit loan-to-deposit ratios until recently, made it possible to <lb/>finance internationally high levels of consumption and investment relative to gross domestic product (GDP) through over <lb/>reliance of the banking sector on wholesale funding. This led to high households&apos; and firms&apos; indebtedness and made banks <lb/>vulnerable to shifts in investor sentiment. However, investment and credit were mostly directed to sheltered sectors, giving <lb/>rise to an oversized road infrastructure, electricity generation capacity and housing stock. Weaknesses in labour market <lb/>institutions further held back productivity and hampered wage adjustment, making it harder to gain cost competitiveness. <lb/>The deleveraging process set in motion by the loss of access to foreign financing is helping to rapidly reduce external <lb/>deficits, but also has the potential to generate a damaging credit contraction, which enhances the importance of alternative <lb/>financing strategies for firms, such as greater reliance on equity. To restore growth, Portugal needs to foster the reallocation <lb/>of both labour and capital, essentially towards the tradable sector. Building on recent policy initiatives or commitments, this <lb/>will require reforming public policies that have long distorted investment allocation, ensuring that banks adequately <lb/>recognise and provision problematic loans and, on the employment front, reducing labour market segmentation and <lb/>increasing targeted training. Reforms in wage setting, labour taxation, unemployment benefits and activation policies will <lb/>foster job creation, thus enhancing output growth while avoiding high unemployment becoming entrenched and threatening <lb/>social cohesion. This Working Paper relates to the 2012 OECD Economic Survey of Portugal <lb/>(www.oecd.org/eco/surveys/portugal). <lb/>JEL classification codes: F32, G21, G28, J52, J64, J65, L94, R31 <lb/>Keywords: Portugal; macroeconomic imbalances; banks; financial regulation; deleveraging; credit allocation; <lb/>unemployment; labour costs; activation policy; wage bargaining; labour market segmentation; housing; energy. <lb/>************ <lb/>Portugal: Rééquilibrer l&apos;économie et renouer avec la croissance par la création d&apos;emplois et une meilleure <lb/>affectation des capitaux <lb/>L&apos;économie portugaise s&apos;est caractérisée ces dix dernières années par une croissance faible et des déficits volumineux des <lb/>paiements courants. L&apos;accès au crédit facile sur les marchés mondiaux, conjugué jusqu&apos;à ces derniers temps à une absence <lb/>de dispositifs incitant les banques à limiter leur ratio prêts/dépôts, a permis de financer à l&apos;international une forte <lb/>consommation et des investissements élevés par rapport au produit intérieur brut (PIB), par un recours excessif du secteur <lb/>bancaire aux marchés de la dette internationaux. Ce phénomène a abouti à un endettement important des ménages et des <lb/>entreprises et a rendu les banques vulnérables à un retournement de la confiance des investisseurs. Cela étant, <lb/>l&apos;investissement et le crédit ont été principalement orientés vers les secteurs protégés, donnant naissance à une infrastructure <lb/>routière, à des capacités de production d&apos;électricité et à un stock de logements surdimensionnés. Les carences des <lb/>institutions du marché du travail ont encore sapé la productivité et entravé l&apos;ajustement des salaires, rendant encore plus <lb/>difficiles les gains de compétitivité-coûts. Le processus de désendettement déclenché par la perte de l&apos;accès aux <lb/>financements internationaux contribue à réduire rapidement les déficits extérieurs mais pourrait également engendrer un <lb/>resserrement du crédit préjudiciable pour l&apos;économie, ce qui accroît l&apos;importance de stratégies de financement alternatives <lb/>pour les entreprises, telles qu&apos;une plus grande dépendance sur les fonds propres. Pour renouer avec la croissance, le <lb/>Portugal doit favoriser le redéploiement de la main-d&apos;oeuvre et du capital, pour l&apos;essentiel vers les secteurs exportateurs. En <lb/>s&apos;appuyant sur les récentes initiatives et engagements politiques, il lui faudra engager une réforme de ses politiques <lb/>publiques qui ont longtemps faussé la répartition des investissements, veiller à ce que les banques comptabilisent et <lb/>provisionnent comme il se doit leurs prêts problématiques et, sur le front de l&apos;emploi, réduire la segmentation du marché du <lb/>travail et renforcer les formations ciblées. Des réformes concernant la fixation des salaires, l&apos;imposition du travail, les <lb/>allocations chômage et les politiques d&apos;activation stimuleront la création d&apos;emplois et renforceront de ce fait la croissance <lb/>de la production tout en évitant l&apos;enracinement d&apos;un chômage élevé mettant en péril la cohésion sociale.

			<body>Portugal: Rebalancing the economy and returning to growth through job <lb/>creation and better capital allocation <lb/>by Álvaro Pina and Ildeberta Abreu 1 <lb/>The crisis made imbalances unsustainable <lb/>After a lost decade, the Portuguese economy has embarked on a challenging process of economic <lb/>adjustment and reform. Over 2001-10, real GDP growth averaged a meagre 0.6%, and unemployment <lb/>almost tripled. Labour market institutions have held back productivity growth and hampered wage <lb/>restraint, damaging external competitiveness. An array of product market inefficiencies and rents, <lb/>especially in sheltered sectors, also hurt productivity and competitiveness, not least by distorting <lb/>investment allocation. Insufficient risk perception allowed excessively high consumption and investment to <lb/>be intermediated by domestic banks through international wholesale debt markets, especially as there were <lb/>no incentives, such as a target for the loan-to-deposit ratio, to slow down lending until recently. Combined <lb/>with poor export performance, this led to high external deficits and indebtedness. Despite a growing tax <lb/>burden, public debt has also increased markedly, reflecting chronic difficulties in managing and controlling <lb/>public expenditure, of which government-directed investment projects are a good example. <lb/>While many of these problems have been long identified and discussed (e.g. Blanchard, 2007), the <lb/>global financial and sovereign debt crises have made them more acute and, when external private financing <lb/>dried up, unsustainable. Since May 2011, Portugal has been steadfastly implementing an ambitious three-<lb/>year European Union-International Monetary Fund (EU-IMF) financial assistance programme. It is <lb/>important to ensure that the inevitable short-run costs of the on-going macro-financial adjustment do not <lb/>degenerate into a deeper recession, and that continued structural reform efforts help to minimise the risk of <lb/>unemployment becoming structural and lay the ground for sustained and balanced growth. After outlining <lb/>how imbalances built up, this working paper discusses policies to rebalance the economy and return to <lb/>growth, focusing on restoring the banking system to health, fostering efficient investment allocation and <lb/>creating more and better jobs through improved labour market performance. <lb/>Macroeconomic imbalances have grown larger over the past decade <lb/>The very high current account deficits, of almost 10% of GDP on average during 2001-10, led to a <lb/>sharp deterioration of the international investment position from –39% of GDP at end-2000 to –107% ten <lb/>years later. This was reflected in the growing indebtedness of households and firms (Figure 1). Portugal <lb/>lost substantial export market share until 2005, with no signs of any significant recovery until 2011, while <lb/>imports were fuelled by high private consumption and (to a lesser extent) investment (Figure 2). After <lb/>some ten years of persistent, though moderate, real appreciation, cost competitiveness essentially stagnated <lb/>around the mid-2000s and did not start to recover until 2010, despite rising unemployment (Figure 3). <lb/></body>

			<body>A highly inefficient labour market, where poor institutions predate the crisis, has weighed both on <lb/>wage and productivity developments. Despite soaring unemployment since 2000, significant downward <lb/>adjustment of private sector real wages only started in 2011 (Figure 3). Explanations for this include <lb/>widespread administrative extension of collective agreements, long-lasting unemployment benefits <lb/>(especially for older workers) and pervasive labour market segmentation, all of which cossets insiders and <lb/>places the burden of adjustment on the fringe of temporary workers (Marques et al., 2009; Centeno and <lb/>Novo, 2012). Large minimum wage increases in 2006-11 further worsened matters. Until 2010, there was <lb/>no consistent policy of wage restraint in the public sector, which has some influence on private wage-<lb/>setting (Lamo et al., 2008). Poor labour market institutions have also hampered productivity. Segmentation <lb/>limits the mobility of permanent workers, and thus the quality of their job matches, and discourages human <lb/>capital accumulation by temporary workers (Centeno and Novo, 2012). Administrative extension stifles <lb/>competition between firms, as dominant firms use it as a way to exclude new competitors. <lb/>Though declining relative to GDP, investment has remained above the euro area average for most of <lb/>the past decade (Figure 2), but its allocation has failed to spur productivity growth. A continued emphasis <lb/>on government-promoted transport infrastructure, with both traditional public capital formation and public-<lb/>private partnerships (PPP) adding to the substantial investment from the 1990s, likely accounts for more <lb/>than half of the excess of the share of non-residential construction (other buildings and structures) relative <lb/>to the euro area (Figure 4). In 2000-09, public capital formation, mostly non-residential construction, was <lb/>on average 1 percentage point of GDP higher than in the euro area, and an almost as large differential has <lb/>been estimated for PPP investment flows (Kappeler and Nemoz, 2010), mainly road projects (Haugh and <lb/>Sorbe, 2012). <lb/>As a result of distorted incentives for homeownership and poor rental market performance, housing <lb/>investment remained skewed towards new dwellings (rather than renovation). Although declining, <lb/>investment further expanded the housing stock, already large at the turn of the century. Amidst shrinking <lb/>investment in most sectors (though, in the case of construction and others, from a high starting point), <lb/>energy stands out as an exception (Figure 4), with investment increasing from 0.6% of GDP in 2000 to <lb/>1.6% in 2009 (against a stable 0.6% for the 20 EU countries for which data is available). This increase has <lb/>been partly due to incentives for electricity production which caused a surge in wind farms (with <lb/>concomitant network expansion) and, to a smaller extent, in other generation technologies, leading to <lb/>excessive production capacity. <lb/>Financial sector developments have mirrored these trends in indebtedness and investment allocation. <lb/>Large-scale resort to international wholesale debt markets has filled a yawning gap between credit and <lb/>deposits in the domestic banking system. Portuguese banks had the fourth highest euro area credit-to-<lb/>deposit ratio in 2009 (after Estonia, Ireland and Slovenia), and the fourth largest increase since 2000 (Beck <lb/>et al., 2000). In addition, the allocation of credit to construction-related activities has been reinforced, to <lb/>the detriment of tradable sectors (Figure 5). <lb/></body>

			<body>Wide-scale adjustment began in 2011 <lb/>The correction of macroeconomic and financial imbalances started in earnest only in 2011. The <lb/>gradual loss of access to foreign financing by the sovereign and domestic banks over the course of 2010 <lb/>and early 2011 was increasingly replaced by official capital flows (Merler and Pisani-Ferry, 2012), mainly <lb/>through Eurosystem financing and EU-IMF financial assistance. Despite sizeable terms-of-trade losses, the <lb/>current account deficit narrowed substantially in 2011 (from 10% to 6.4% of GDP), due to both declining <lb/>import volumes and a strong export performance. While the former stem from internal demand weakness, <lb/>the latter reflects robust growth across a wide range of exported goods and services, most prominently in <lb/>transport equipment. This has been accompanied by increased geographic diversification, with major <lb/>increases (though often from a low base) in sales to countries as diverse as Algeria, Angola, Brazil and <lb/>China. Limited prospects at home are arguably forcing firms to become more exported oriented. Recent <lb/>improvements in cost competitiveness, especially vis-à-vis non euro area partners, have also helped export <lb/>performance (Figure 3). <lb/>Unwinding macro-financial imbalances <lb/>Managing bank deleveraging to ensure adequate credit supply <lb/>Bank deleveraging is essential to reinforce financial stability and ease the return to wholesale market <lb/>funding, and will accompany the necessary reduction of indebtedness of households and non-financial <lb/>firms. Core Tier 1 ratios need to comply with targets set by the Bank of Portugal (9 and 10% at end-2011 <lb/>and end-2012) and, for four of the largest banking groups, by the European Banking Authority (EBA) <lb/>(9% by 30 June 2012, computed under slightly different and more demanding rules, plus a capital buffer <lb/>for sovereign exposures). Further, the eight largest groups, accounting for 83% of the system&apos;s assets, are <lb/>to reduce their loan-to-deposit ratios towards an indicative 120% target by end-2014. However, if pursued <lb/>at too fast a pace, necessary bank deleveraging has the potential to threaten an adequate credit supply to <lb/>viable firms and worsen recessionary dynamics. <lb/>Progress has been made in increasing Core Tier 1 ratios, through both numerator and denominator <lb/>(Table 1). Among the eight largest banks, three already reached the 10% target in 2011 and a fourth one <lb/>(covered by EBA requirements) has reached that target in 2012 with private funds only. The others, which <lb/>include the three banks with the largest needs for sovereign capital buffers plus a smaller institution, have <lb/>resorted to (or are expected to require) public support for recapitalisation, funded, apart from the state-<lb/>owned Caixa Geral de Depósitos, under an EU-IMF programme facility of EUR 12 billion. The EBA <lb/>sovereign buffer has been by far the most important determinant of increased capital needs (Table 1), <lb/>largely reflecting banks&apos; exposure to Portuguese sovereign debt, which surged in 2010. Other major <lb/>determinants, dating from 2011 but with impacts on regulatory capital deferred until June 2012, have been <lb/>the recognition of actuarial losses associated to the transfer of banks&apos; pension funds to the general social <lb/>security regime and additional credit impairments under the Special Inspections Programme (see below). <lb/>Rules for bank recapitalisation with government funds should strike a balance between safeguarding <lb/>taxpayers&apos; interests, minimising the risk of political interference in credit allocation and creating incentives <lb/>for private shareholders to reimburse public support as soon as feasible. Under Portuguese legislation, <lb/>recently revised and compliant with EU competition rules, the government can inject funds using either <lb/>common equity or hybrid debt instruments, such as contingent convertible securities (CoCos). Shares will <lb/>be bought or subscribed at a substantial discount relative to market prices and are entitled to a priority <lb/>dividend, but confer no voting rights in ordinary management decisions (except for those shares in excess <lb/>of 50% of total common equity, which is a relatively high threshold). Hybrid debt instruments can make up <lb/>to 50% of eligible capital and will pay an interest rate initially set between 7 and 9.3%. This rate increases <lb/>over time, which reinforces incentives to shorten the duration of public support. Banks requiring public <lb/></body>

In case of non-compliance (assessed by the Bank of <lb/>Portugal) or, in any case, after five years, all remaining public capitalisation instruments (shares or others) <lb/>will be converted into shares with full voting rights. <lb/>Table 1.

Of which up to EUR 200 million would have been converted into shares if a share capital increase of that amount, subscribed <lb/>by private investors, had not been completed by 30 September 2012. <lb/>Source: Bank of Portugal. <lb/>Based on the recapitalisation plans submitted by the three largest banks requiring public support (two <lb/>private and one state-owned), the authorities made available more than EUR 6.5 billion of public funds, of <lb/>which up to 5 billion from the EU-IMF programme facility (Table 1), allowing the banks concerned to <lb/>exceed both EBA and Bank of Portugal minimum capital requirements by a considerable margin. While <lb/>funds in the two private banks have been injected through contingent convertible securities (initially <lb/>amounting to EUR 4.5 billion and paying an initial interest rate of 8.5%), the government could have <lb/>ended up with a sizeable equity position in those institutions, had private shareholders left unsubscribed <lb/>recent rights issues. In these and any future recapitalisation operations, the authorities should ensure that <lb/>the potential costs to taxpayers and the final beneficiaries of the funds are fully transparent, so as to reduce <lb/>moral hazard and maintain public support (IMF, 2009). Further, as envisaged, the authorities should keep <lb/>the remainder of the EUR 12 billion envelope for further capital increases if needed, even after 2012 <lb/>capital targets are met. This will help to minimise the risk of credit rationing, if losses from credit <lb/>impairments, likely to stay high or even increase in the near future, put downward pressure on capital and <lb/>hence on risk-weighted assets as well. <lb/>Banks have been reducing their loan-to-deposit ratios, which for the banking system as whole fell <lb/>from a peak of 167% in June 2010 to 140% in December 2011 (Figure 6). The ratio for the eight largest <lb/>banks as a whole was reduced likewise, to around 130%. However, there is considerable dispersion across <lb/>ECO/WKP(2012)71 <lb/></note>

			<body>banks. While five of those eight banks are already below, or very close to, the 120% indicative target, the <lb/>other three were still above 140% at end-2011. The contrast between both groups continued to hold in mid-<lb/>2012, though with some increase in dispersion among the more highly leveraged institutions. <lb/>Figure 6. Recent developments in banks&apos; loan-to-deposit ratio <lb/>End of period <lb/>1. <lb/>Since the previous semester. <lb/>2. <lb/>The definition of the loan-to-deposit ratio relevant for the 120% indicative target is slightly different from the one depicted <lb/>(generally 1-2 percentage points higher). <lb/>Source: Bank of Portugal. <lb/>Deposits have been growing vigorously since mid-2010, and account for most of the progress so far in <lb/>reducing loan-to-deposit ratios. Contributions to deposit growth initially came from non-financial firms <lb/>and non-monetary financial institutions but, in 2011, mainly from private individuals and general <lb/>government. Attracted by higher rates on deposits, households have adjusted the composition of their <lb/>financial asset portfolios away from other savings instruments managed within banks&apos; financial groups <lb/>(e.g. by investment funds or insurance companies) or non-tradable public debt (saving certificates). <lb/>Unspent funds from the EU-IMF programme have enabled general government deposits to more than <lb/>double in 2011. However, the potential for further deposit growth will wane over time. Developments until <lb/>mid-2012 suggest that deposits by private individuals, though still posting robust year-on-year growth, are <lb/>slowing down, while the more volatile deposits by firms are decreasing. <lb/>Over the course of 2011, a progressively larger share of the loan-to-deposit ratio decline has come <lb/>from the numerator, not only through growing credit impairments (further addressed below) and credit <lb/>portfolio sales, but also as a result of considerable reduction of loans to firms and households. Overall <lb/>developments in domestic bank loans nonetheless hide stark differences in financing conditions across <lb/>non-financial firms (Figure 7). Total credit granted by either resident or non-resident entities has displayed <lb/>a more benign trend, as some private sector large firms and non-financial holdings have managed to <lb/>increase their external financing (Bank of Portugal, 2011). Lending by domestic banks to state-owned <lb/>enterprises (SOE) outside general government has steeply increased, reflecting continued operational <lb/>losses and the need to replace non-resident lenders in rolling over maturing debt, though it should be borne <lb/>in mind that those enterprises only account for little more than 5% of outstanding loans by the resident <lb/>financial sector to nonfinancial corporations. In contrast, small and medium-sized enterprises (SME), <lb/>traditionally more reliant on resident lenders, especially banks, have witnessed major falls in credit. This is <lb/>in line with credit constraints reported in sectoral surveys, which are highest in construction, but have been <lb/>increasing also in manufacturing and services. These constraints also hamper the ability of SMEs to tap <lb/>supports for internationalisation and research and development (R&amp;D) co-financed by EU funds. <lb/>-20 <lb/>-15 <lb/>-10 <lb/>-5 <lb/>0 <lb/>5 <lb/>10 <lb/>15 <lb/>Billion euros <lb/>0 <lb/>25 <lb/>50 <lb/>75 <lb/>100 <lb/>125 <lb/>150 <lb/>175 <lb/>Per cent <lb/>Dec-2009 <lb/>Jun-2010 <lb/>Dec-2010 <lb/>Jun-2011 <lb/>Dec-2011 <lb/>Change in credits¹ (left scale) <lb/>Change in deposits¹ (left scale) <lb/>Loan-to-deposit ratio -total banking system (right scale) <lb/>Loan-to-deposit ratio -8 banks² (right scale) <lb/>ECO/WKP(2012)71 <lb/></body>

Helped by bond issuance operations under a EUR 35 billion state guarantee facility (eligible as <lb/>Eurosystem collateral), as well as by further measures to increase collateral availability taken in <lb/>February 2012, Portuguese banks took advantage of the two recent three-year European Central Bank <lb/>(ECB) long-term refinancing operations to both extend the maturity of their Eurosystem funding and <lb/>increase its overall amount (Figure 8). However, apart from some decrease in interest rates on new loans to <lb/>non-financial firms (rates which remain nonetheless very high), financing conditions in the economy have <lb/>not eased yet. Indeed, bank lending surveys suggest that some further tightening of credit standards in <lb/>loans to firms took place in the first semester of 2012 (especially as regards long-term lending) and was <lb/>likely to continue, though more moderately, in the third quarter. <lb/>Figure 8.

			<body>While lower loan-to-deposit ratios are essential for financial stability, deleveraging pursued at too fast <lb/>a pace risks aggravating the contraction of credit and economic activity. Exporting firms, on which hopes <lb/>of sustained growth depend, are vulnerable to credit constraints, as involvement in international trade tends <lb/>to increase the need for working capital and investment to enlarge capacity will eventually become <lb/>necessary. The growth of loans by the resident financial sector to exporting companies, though still posting <lb/>positive figures, has declined markedly to 1.5% in the second quarter of 2012 (year-on-year). The <lb/>authorities should ensure that the pace of convergence towards the loan-to-deposit ratio indicative target of <lb/>about 120% by end-2014 does not thwart economic activity. The degree of flexibility stemming from the <lb/>target&apos;s indicative nature is made more important by the fact that those banks further away from the target <lb/>have on average a larger weight of loans to firms in their portfolios. <lb/>Fostering credit reallocation and a smaller reliance on debt financing <lb/>Deleveraging should be accompanied by the removal of distortions to credit reallocation across <lb/>sectors, to enable productivity-enhancing shifts in investment composition. While distortions in housing <lb/>and energy are discussed below, financing pressures from SOE (Figure 7), mostly in non-tradable sectors, <lb/>are hampering reallocation, which underlines the importance of on-going efforts to improve their <lb/>operational performance (Haugh and Sorbe, 2012). When appropriate, cancelling or buying back PPP road <lb/>projects (Haugh and Sorbe, 2012) would also have a payoff in terms of reallocating credit away from <lb/>construction. <lb/>On the credit supply side, it is essential that banks refrain from &quot; ever-greening &quot; problematic loans, as <lb/>the ensuing protracted loss recognition would tend to depress productivity growth and slow down recovery. <lb/>To this end, several welcome steps have been recently taken by the Bank of Portugal. Supervisory <lb/>capabilities have been strengthened following the Special Inspections Programme, which examined on-site <lb/>the credit portfolios and stress-testing methods of the eight largest banking groups (with overall positive <lb/>results). Further on-site inspections are planned, which is welcome. Faced with major sales of banks&apos; non-<lb/>performing loans to outside vehicles (e.g. venture capital funds, often headquartered abroad), the central <lb/>bank has required detailed information reporting and imposed high risk weights on banks&apos; exposures to <lb/>those vehicles, which may be used to defer losses in case of insufficient haircuts. Further, banks have also <lb/>been required to identify all instances of restructured loans (even if still performing) due to financial <lb/>difficulties of the borrower. In this respect, the recent corporate insolvency law amendments, as well as the <lb/>extra-judicial conciliation framework now being finalised, are expected to facilitate the early rescue of <lb/>viable firms. The authorities should make data on restructured loans public and continue to use supervisory <lb/>tools to promote swift recognition of bad loans. As discussed above, this may make it necessary to provide <lb/>banks with more capital support. <lb/>Credit reallocation to viable SMEs would also be promoted by reversing the 2011 steep increase in <lb/>the prudential risk weight attached to loans granted under government-sponsored credit lines. These loans <lb/>benefit from a private sector credit guarantee, part of which enjoys in turn a government fund counter-<lb/>guarantee, amounting in general to 37.5% of the loan. As the fund providing the counter-guarantee is by its <lb/>legal setup considered to have the same risk as a credit institution for prudential purposes, exposures to the <lb/>fund (i.e. 37.5% of the guaranteed loans) saw their risk weights soar from 20 to 100% in 2011, as did <lb/>exposures to credit institutions, when Portuguese sovereign debt lost investment grade. Higher risk weights <lb/>made those loans less attractive to banks. The authorities could reconsider that aspect of the legal setup of <lb/>the counter-guarantee fund, thus allowing for lower risk weights on loans under SME credit lines. <lb/></body>

			<body>As deleveraging proceeds, companies will need to become less dependent on credit and more reliant <lb/>on equity, of either national or foreign origin, which inter alia will make the economy more resilient to <lb/>financial crises (Ahrend and Goujard, 2012). Foreign direct investment (FDI) accounts for a below-average <lb/>share of total external liabilities (16% in 2010, against 26% across the OECD), notwithstanding low <lb/>statutory barriers. In the past, the prospect of foreign investors taking majority stakes at large companies <lb/>was sometimes regarded with reservations (Ministry of Finance, 2011), in sharp contrast to an attitude of <lb/>often benign neglect towards high current account deficits. Yet FDI can be an important source of <lb/>technology transfer and, in times of tight internal credit, may also ease access to external market financing. <lb/>Opening up the economy and reducing external imbalances are important goals under the EU-IMF <lb/>programme. <lb/>Portuguese firms have a high debt-to-equity ratio, which increases their vulnerability to downturns <lb/>and deteriorating operational earnings (IMF, 2012). Reluctance to opening shareholder control to new <lb/>partners has been a long-standing barrier to capital market entry by many SMEs. Additionally, the <lb/>corporate income tax regime has long favoured debt finance over equity finance, a bias worsened in recent <lb/>years by the introduction and subsequent increase of a tax rate surcharge for profits above certain <lb/>thresholds (derrama estadual) in the context of fiscal consolidation, as well as by the increased taxation of <lb/>capital gains on equity shares (since 2010), though the latter is welcome from an income distribution <lb/>viewpoint (OECD, 2010a). An allowance for corporate equity, introduced in 2008, has so far been scantily <lb/>availed of, possibly because its scope is limited to SMEs, among other constraints. The authorities should <lb/>take further steps to alleviate the debt bias embedded in the tax system. One among several possibilities <lb/>would be to limit interest payments deductibility, and use the ensuing increase in revenue to reduce the <lb/>corporate tax rate. <lb/>Removing distortions to investment allocation <lb/>Housing market reforms to improve capital allocation and increase labour mobility <lb/>Rental market and tax policies excessively favoured homeownership and biased capital allocation <lb/>Portugal has a housing stock among the highest in the OECD area, mostly owner-occupied (Figure 9). <lb/>Over the past decade, investment in new dwellings, though on a declining trend, expanded the stock per <lb/>inhabitant by around 15%, with an increasing share of vacant homes (13% of the stock in 2011, which is <lb/>relatively high by European standards; OTB, 2010). Around one-third of the stock requires renovation, as <lb/>investment has been largely slanted to new construction (AECOPS, 2009). The increasing level of <lb/>homeownership went along with growing indebtedness of households (around 80% of loans to households <lb/>were for house purchase – Figure 1). It also helps to explain low residential mobility, as homeowners are <lb/>generally found to be less mobile than tenants (Caldera Sánchez and Andrews, 2011). In turn, this can be <lb/>an obstacle to efficient job-matching. <lb/></body>

Poor rental policies have resulted in a <lb/>malfunctioning and small rental sector (20% of dwellings in 2011, which is below that in most OECD <lb/>countries).

In particular, long and cumbersome eviction procedures have been a major hurdle <lb/>to the supply of rental housing. Long-standing rent controls for older contracts (33% of the total, 70% of <lb/>which paying rents below EUR 100 per month) create rigidities, as tenants are reluctant to give up tenure <lb/>security and below-market rents.

			<body>has also been held back by red tape and complex regulations for renovation. Limited supply and high risk <lb/>for landlords have resulted in high rents for newer contracts. The preferential tax treatment of owner-<lb/>occupied housing is likely to have helped to divert capital from more productive investments. Imputed <lb/>rents are not taxed and, until 2011, mortgage interest and principal payments were tax deductible. For most <lb/>properties, taxable values under recurrent immovable property taxes have long lagged behind market value <lb/>and significant exemptions have persisted, though progress is now underway (see below). <lb/>Thorough implementation of reforms is essential to increase the supply of rental housing <lb/>The new urban lease legislation, which will come into force in mid-November 2012, is an important <lb/>step forward in balancing rights and obligations of landlords and tenants as regards eviction procedures of <lb/>non-complying tenants. Until now, landlords had to go through the courts and enter eviction procedures <lb/>(acção executiva), the latter alone taking sixteen months on average. The new legislation creates an <lb/>extrajudicial procedure which aims at reducing average eviction time to around three months. If the tenant <lb/>opposes the eviction, the ensuing judicial process will have an urgent nature. The efficacy of the new <lb/>procedures is still uncertain and the authorities should be ready to take corrective actions, if warranted, to <lb/>ensure that both extrajudicial and judicial processes effectively decrease the eviction time of non-<lb/>complying tenants, as envisaged. <lb/>The new legislation also tackles rent controls, an area where past reforms have largely failed. Under <lb/>the new rules, old contracts (those predating 1990) can be renegotiated and, in case of no agreement, <lb/>landlords can choose between contract termination with compensation and a five-year contract with an <lb/>updated rent subject to an annual maximum of 6.7% of the property taxable value, after which full <lb/>liberalisation applies. However, wide-ranging exceptions apply, for both residential and non-residential <lb/>leases. Residential tenants who are aged 65 and over (60% of the pre-1990 residential leases, which <lb/>amounts to 20% of total residential lease contracts) or have a level of disability over 60% cannot be forced <lb/>to leave even after five years, and the above rent ceiling will persist. This lacks means-testing. Except for <lb/>low-income old or disabled people, the authorities should ensure that after this five-year transitory period <lb/>any ceiling to these rents is no longer below market values. <lb/>Another exception concerns leases to low-income tenants, which cannot in general be terminated <lb/>during a transitional five-year period and will benefit during this period from a lower and income-<lb/>dependent rent ceiling. Though rent liberalisation after those five years is welcome, low-income tenants of <lb/>all ages will need support once the transitory period expires, and instruments to that end should be <lb/>announced as soon as possible. Well-designed portable rent allowances might be considered, as these do <lb/>not seem to hinder residential mobility (Andrews et al., 2011). Exceptions to the possibility of contract <lb/>termination also cover broadly-defined small businesses, implying that many retailers will benefit for five <lb/>years from the fact that the transitional 6.7% rent ceiling will often keep rent levels below current market <lb/>values, which distorts competition. If a significant divergence between market and transitional regulated <lb/>rents persists, the authorities should shorten the transitory period, raise the ceiling or adopt a narrower <lb/>definition of small businesses. <lb/>In a welcome move, the authorities have also changed legislation to simplify administrative <lb/>procedures for renovation. The recent changes in both urban renovation and rental legislation are likely to <lb/>give a much-needed boost to rental supply, made all the more necessary by the likely increase in demand <lb/>stemming from household deleveraging and tighter credit. Currently vacant homes are expected to play a <lb/>part in raising rental supply, especially given their upcoming higher property tax costs (updated taxable <lb/>values in general plus a much higher tax rate for vacant dwellings). To foster this process, the existing <lb/>financing incentives for renovation works, which are currently being re-evaluated by the authorities, should <lb/>be focused on dwellings for rental. <lb/>ECO/WKP(2012)71 <lb/></body>

			<body>Remove the preferential tax treatment of owner-occupied housing <lb/>Since 2011, there have been welcome steps to reduce the preferential tax treatment of owner-occupied <lb/>housing. Mortgage interest deductibility is being gradually phased out and that of mortgage principal has <lb/>been eliminated. Rent deductibility is also being phased out, although at a slower pace. As for recurrent <lb/>taxes on immovable property, the authorities are carrying out a general updating of urban property taxable <lb/>values, to be completed by end-2012, have plans for regular updating in the future, and have significantly <lb/>reduced temporary tax exemptions for principal owner-occupied dwellings. The authorities should proceed <lb/>with implementation according to planned deadlines and, as recurrent tax proceeds gradually increase, <lb/>reduce reliance on the distorting real estate transaction tax, by levying it only on the initial transactions of <lb/>property. In a second step, the transaction tax could be replaced by value-added tax (VAT) (OECD, <lb/>2010a). Even though Portugal compares favourably with other European countries regarding housing <lb/>transaction costs, the weight of taxes in the costs of purchasing a dwelling is somewhat higher than average <lb/>(EMF, 2010). <lb/>Addressing rents in the energy sector to foster efficient capital allocation and improve competitiveness <lb/>Regulatory interventions are granting unwarranted returns to electricity generators and distorting capital <lb/>allocation <lb/>Opening the electricity sector to private initiative and competition and promoting renewable energy <lb/>have been at the core of Portugal&apos;s energy policy since the mid-1990s. Electricity generation has been <lb/>gradually opened to competition, though the previous incumbent, EDP – Energias de Portugal, still holds a <lb/>high wholesale market share (around two-thirds in 2011). Transmission and distribution have been <lb/>unbundled. Transmission is carried out by a single company, REN – Rede Eléctrica Nacional, and <lb/>distribution remains a virtual monopoly of EDP. An Iberian electricity market has been implemented, <lb/>aided by an increase in interconnection capacity. The retail sector has two segments, a competitive <lb/>liberalised market (47% of total power supplied in 2011) and a market with regulated tariffs, which are <lb/>being phased out. EDP is the chief supplier in the latter segment (as last-resort supplier) and is also the <lb/>largest player in the former, with a market share of 42% in terms of volume, against around 25% for each <lb/>of its two main competitors (and 80% in terms of the number of clients, against around 15% for the second <lb/>firm). <lb/>In recent years, Portugal has become a leader in Europe in terms of renewables (Figure 10), largely <lb/>due to the rapid growth of wind power from below 1% of gross electricity production in 2000 to 19% in <lb/>2011. Progress in harnessing renewable sources plays a major role in Portugal&apos;s contribution to the EU <lb/>efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to strengthen energy security. Portugal&apos;s emissions have <lb/>been declining since 2005 and, partly because of the economic crisis, in 2009 were already slightly below <lb/>their Kyoto Protocol target for 2008-12. However, the integration of such large amounts of wind power in <lb/>the electricity system requires, due to its intermittent nature, excess supply capacity of other sources that <lb/>can quickly respond when there is no wind (e.g. thermal plants) or take advantage of excessive wind power <lb/>when demand is low (e.g. pumped hydro storage) (Lopes and Gata, 2005). Six new dams are to be <lb/>constructed by 2017, three of which with pumped storage. Existing thermal plants are operating <lb/>significantly below their full capacity. Therefore, there is some excess generation capacity, all the more so <lb/>given the currently foreseen reduction of electricity consumption. <lb/></body>

Most generators currently benefit either from feed-in tariffs <lb/>(i.e. a regulated above-market price at which all electricity produced is sold to the network) for renewables <lb/>and cogeneration, or from financial mechanisms to ensure profitability for fossil-fuel power and large <lb/>hydro plants. All these support mechanisms give generators a revenue per unit of electricity produced <lb/>above the liberalised wholesale market price (Figure 11) and largely insulate them from market risks, such <lb/>as those stemming from demand or price fluctuations. Supports are often excessively generous and hence <lb/>cost-inefficient, distorting investment allocation, as argued above, and weighing beyond necessary on <lb/>electricity costs and prices (see below). <lb/>Box 1. Support to electricity generators <lb/>Most electricity generators under the ordinary regulatory regime (fossil-fuel power and large hydroelectric plants) <lb/>benefit either from financial mechanisms to ensure profitability or, more recently, from payments for availability: <lb/>•  Power Purchase Agreements (Contratos de Aquisição de Energia) were created in the mid-1990s with the<lb/>launch of international tenders to open the sector to private investment. Plants under these long-term <lb/>contracts supply their energy in exchange for a pre-established rate of return, which is independent of their <lb/>effective generation. <lb/>•  The early termination in 2007 of Energias de Portugal&apos;s (EDP) Power Purchase Agreements, to facilitate<lb/>liquidity in the Iberian market, was compensated with the Costs for the Preservation of Contractual <lb/>Equilibrium (Custos para a Manutenção do Equilíbrio Contratual) mechanism. This guarantees that plants <lb/>will be able to recoup the same profitability by selling production in the market as they would have obtained <lb/>under the former contracts. The mechanism includes a fixed annuity, to be received for 20 years, meant to <lb/>correspond to the estimated net present value of the previous contracts plus financial costs. This was done <lb/>on unfavourable terms because future cash flows were discounted at a rate of around 5% (government <lb/>bonds plus 0.25 percentage points) while the financial costs of the annuity are capitalised at a nominal rate <lb/>of 7.55% (average cost of capital of the producer). <lb/>•  The Power Guarantee Mechanism (Mecanismo de Garantia de Potência) was established in 2010 to<lb/>remunerate generators for providing stand-by capacity available to the system. It was granted as an <lb/>incentive to investment (EUR 20 000 per megawatt per annum) but applied to already existing or licensed <lb/>plants. In a welcome step, the authorities have recently discontinued this scheme, and redesigned <lb/>payments for availability. <lb/>0 <lb/>20 <lb/>40 <lb/>60 <lb/>80 <lb/>100 <lb/>0 <lb/>20 <lb/>40 <lb/>60 <lb/>80 <lb/>100 <lb/>HUN <lb/>EST <lb/>POL <lb/>BEL <lb/>GBR <lb/>CZE <lb/>NLD <lb/>IRL <lb/>DEU <lb/>FRA <lb/>GRC <lb/>FIN <lb/>SVK <lb/>DNK <lb/>ITA <lb/>TUR <lb/>SVN <lb/>ESP <lb/>LUX <lb/>SWE <lb/>PRT <lb/>CHE <lb/>AUT <lb/>NOR <lb/>ISL <lb/>Hydro <lb/>Wind <lb/>Other¹ <lb/>Total share in 2000 <lb/></body>

			<body>Producers under the special regime (renewables and cogeneration) benefit from the last-resort supplier obligation <lb/>to buy all electricity they generate and from a pre-established feed-in tariff: <lb/>•  The feed-in tariffs paid to renewables are differentiated by technology and guaranteed for a fixed time frame<lb/>(15 years in most cases). They take into account environmental benefits and are adjusted monthly for <lb/>inflation. <lb/>•  Cogeneration benefits from a feed-in tariff paid on all production sold to the last-resort supplier plus an<lb/>efficiency premium and a renewable energy premium. The feed-in tariff is indexed to inflation and to <lb/>changes in the oil price and exchange rate. It is guaranteed for ten years and may be revised and extended <lb/>for another ten years, but no time limit is established in the case of renewable cogeneration. Under this <lb/>setup, the authorities have in recent months considerably reduced future remuneration for cogeneration so <lb/>as to accelerate convergence to market-based pricing, which is welcome. <lb/>Figure 11. Unit revenue paid to electricity generators <lb/>Annual average, euros per megawatt hour <lb/>1. <lb/>This covers fixed and variable costs and therefore depends on the power plants&apos; utilisation (e.g. unit revenue tends to decrease <lb/>in rainy years). Data in 2007 refer only to the second half of the year. <lb/>Source: Energy Services Regulatory Authority. <lb/>In the case of renewables, feed-in tariffs are the key support instrument. They were very effective in <lb/>stimulating the development of renewable electricity, especially from wind, but too costly in some cases. <lb/>Renewables support expenditures in Portugal per unit of electricity consumed were the fourth highest <lb/>among EU countries in 2009 (Ecofys, 2011). In the case of wind, tendering for licensing was introduced in <lb/>2005, thus promoting cost-efficiency (IEA, 2009), and the feed-in tariff payable to the ensuing new <lb/>generators was brought down to EUR 75 per megawatt hour (MWh) or below, broadly in line with values <lb/>in other EU countries (OECD, 2011). However, around 80% of the existing wind capacity is still being <lb/>paid under older tariffs, above EUR 90/MWh. Support goes far beyond wind farms. Cogeneration <lb/>production, largely in the industrial sector, has also increased over the last years with the introduction of a <lb/>significant feed-in tariff (Figure 11), indexed to oil prices, payable on all electricity produced (IEA, <lb/>2008a). As regards fossil-fuel power and large hydro plants, most benefit from financial mechanisms <lb/>which guarantee a pre-established rate of return. Their effective rates of return are complex to estimate <lb/>precisely but are currently clearly above their average cost of capital (Portuguese Government, 2012). <lb/>Other generators have received payments for availability which have entailed a deadweight loss as they <lb/>were granted as an incentive to investment but applied to already existing plants. <lb/>All costs of generation support are supposed to be passed on to prices paid by end-consumers of <lb/>electricity, but so far only part of the costs has. In 2012, costs with subsidies to electricity generators <lb/>passed on to end-users will account for 14% of the average electric bill and 64% of total passed-on policy <lb/>costs (Figure 12).

			<body>on industrial users (ERSE, 2012), which helps explain the internationally very high electricity prices faced <lb/>by households. Still, prices for industry in 2011 were already above the OECD Europe average, according <lb/>to preliminary estimates. As the government decided on several occasions not to fully transmit to prices the <lb/>costs of support to generators, it has created a liability to be paid in the future by all end-users of <lb/>electricity. This tariff debt reached EUR 1.8 billion at end-2011 (about 1% of GDP) and is expected to be <lb/>close to EUR 3 billion at end-2012 (ERSE, 2011). This crowds out credit to other sectors, as the debt has <lb/>been securitised with banks (i.e. the entitlement to future payments is transferred to banks in exchange for <lb/>an upfront payment to the electricity companies), and should be paid through future increases in electricity <lb/>prices. If no reforms were implemented, eliminating the tariff debt by 2020, as the authorities have <lb/>committed to under the EU-IMF programme, would require that electricity prices grow by 2.8% per year in <lb/>real terms from 2012 to 2020. <lb/>Figure 12. Average electricity price structure <lb/>2012 <lb/>1. <lb/>Support to generators is 14% of total and other policy costs are 8%. <lb/>2. <lb/>Energy and commercialisation costs of the supplier (market determined). <lb/>Source: Energy Services Regulatory Authority. <lb/>Ensuring that electricity generation support is made cost-effective <lb/>The authorities must ensure that electricity generation support is made cost-effective and costs are <lb/>fully passed on to all consumers. This requires reducing excessive supports to both wind farms and <lb/>cogeneration, and to fossil-fuel power and large hydro plants. Also, the authorities should avoid cross <lb/>subsidisation between households and industrial users when allocating support costs. Under the EU-IMF <lb/>programme commitments, the government announced in May 2012 an intended reduction of overall <lb/>support costs by around 1% of GDP over the period 2012-20, but some measures are still to be legislated <lb/>or negotiated with electricity generators. Preliminary estimates suggest that in overall terms the announced <lb/>support reduction will decrease the real electricity price increases required to eliminate the tariff debt by <lb/>2020 by only one-fifth to one-fourth. <lb/>In the case of wind farms licensed before the 2005 reform, the authorities should reduce the costs <lb/>stemming from the much higher tariffs still being paid. In August 2012, an agreement in principle to be <lb/>voluntarily entered into by wind generators was reached (but still not implemented), whereby generators <lb/>are supposed to pay some compensation. As regards cogeneration, the authorities have already legislated a <lb/>considerable reduction in their future remuneration and committed to curbing fraud. They should also <lb/>introduce a time limit for feed-in tariffs for renewable cogeneration, as best practices recommend that <lb/>incentives be transitional and decrease over time to foster technological innovation (IEA, 2008b).

			<body>penetration, which currently stand at shares of 31% in gross final energy consumption and 55.3% in <lb/>electricity consumption by 2020 (Portuguese Republic, 2010). In 2010, actual shares already stood at <lb/>24.6% and 41.2%, respectively (DGEG, 2012), placing Portugal among the best EU performers regarding <lb/>the fulfilment of the 2020 targets. The government plans to keep existing commitments to renewables <lb/>penetration but to suspend the award of licenses for new generation capacity with feed-in tariffs until <lb/>further reassessment in 2014 (DGEG, 2012). Given the major progress already made, the authorities should <lb/>expand generation from renewable sources only to the extent needed to meet environmental targets, so as <lb/>to minimise short-run economic costs. In addition, under the current technology-specific support scheme, <lb/>the authorities should phase-out feed-in tariffs as renewables technologies become cost-competitive (such <lb/>as on-shore wind) or, if still required, choose more market-based support instruments (e.g. a premium in <lb/>addition to the electricity market price) to incentivise further cost reductions and optimise the overall <lb/>generation costs (IEA, 2011). <lb/>In the case of fossil-fuel power and large hydro plants, the authorities should reduce the rates of return <lb/>currently being paid to EDP and to generators holding power purchase agreements, aiming at bringing <lb/>returns closer to their average cost of capital. EDP has already communicated to financial markets that it <lb/>expects a minor reduction of its returns, but authorities should aim for more ambitious results in the <lb/>on-going negotiations with generators. In addition, the government has already legislated a new regime of <lb/>payments for availability and suppressed the existing one. The new regime includes a subsidy to thermal <lb/>plants for their availability, to be granted only after the end of the EU-IMF programme, and an incentive to <lb/>investment in new hydroelectric plants. <lb/>Promoting greater competition in the energy market <lb/>Concerns about only limited competition in both electricity and gas remain. Wholesale and especially <lb/>retail electricity markets are still highly concentrated. In wholesale markets, although substantial new <lb/>interconnection capacity has been added between Portugal and Spain, in some months of 2010 and 2011 <lb/>there was noticeable market splitting resulting in differential prices, usually a higher price in Portugal than <lb/>Spain. The regulator should monitor if the foreseen expansion of interconnection capacity is enough to <lb/>reduce congestion and market splitting and ensure that Portugal reaps the full benefits of the joint Iberian <lb/>electricity market. <lb/>Though competition in retail electricity markets will likely increase with the phasing-out of the <lb/>remaining regulated tariffs, progress may be slow as penetration in the household segment, where EDP is <lb/>strongest, entails high entry costs (administrative and commercial structures). In this framework, transitory <lb/>regulated tariffs should be managed so as to ensure that consumers switch to the liberalised market while <lb/>levelling the playing field for competing suppliers. More generally, the powers of the sector regulator will <lb/>be further strengthened by new legislation, expected to come into force soon, regarding the imposition of <lb/>sanctions. Sound regulation is all the more important in the present context of full liberalisation and <lb/>privatisation of natural monopoly network industries. <lb/>Despite steps towards liberalisation, wholesale and retail gas markets remain highly concentrated and <lb/>prices are high by international comparison. Work on a joint Iberian gas market commenced in 2008 but it <lb/>has been impeded by high cross-border transmission charges between Portugal and Spain. To encourage <lb/>greater competition, the Portuguese energy regulator, in tandem with the Spanish energy regulator, should <lb/>fully implement the recent inter-governmental agreement to reduce the cross-border transmission charges <lb/>between Portugal and Spain to zero. Moreover, the incumbent, GALP Energia, owns exclusive contract <lb/>rights to the supply of wholesale pipeline gas from Algeria, which is cheaper than sources available to <lb/>competitors. The regulator should further require GALP to auction Algerian pipeline gas to other firms <lb/>with no pre-set minimum price. Previous auctions have failed because the regulator allowed GALP to <lb/></body>

			<body>auction the wholesale gas at a price infinitesimally below the retail one allowing no margin for a <lb/>competitor. <lb/>Reforming the labour market to create jobs and help rebalance the economy <lb/>Labour market conditions have deteriorated sharply <lb/>Portugal has suffered large-scale job losses since 2008 (around 9% up to the second quarter of 2012), <lb/>which have taken total employment back to 1997 levels. Though the construction sector has been hit <lb/>hardest, shedding around a quarter of its workforce, important losses have also been recorded in services <lb/>(especially hospitality and trade) and manufacturing. The contraction in employment has affected young <lb/>workers the most, and has fallen exclusively on the low skilled (though job creation for workers with <lb/>secondary or tertiary education has not been fast enough to prevent a rise in unemployment among these <lb/>groups). Unlike in most other countries (de Serres et al., 2012), average hours worked have remained <lb/>broadly stable, placing the full burden of accommodating lower total hours on employment. <lb/>Job losses have led to soaring unemployment, but also inactivity and emigration. The unemployment <lb/>rate, at 15% in the second quarter of 2012, has risen by more than two thirds since 2008, for both cyclical <lb/>and structural reasons (see below). Increases have been stronger among those with lower or intermediate <lb/>qualifications and fairly proportional across age groups, though the 15-24 cohort has been somewhat more <lb/>penalised than others and unemployment rates remain strongly decreasing with age. The fall in the labour <lb/>force has come from those under 35 and the low-skilled. Participation rates have decreased markedly in the <lb/>15-24 age range, partly as a result of a return to school. Among those aged 25-34, however, participation <lb/>rates have edged up, which cannot be explained by population ageing alone and suggests growing <lb/>emigration flows. Though up-to-date statistical indicators are scarce, there is abundant anecdotal evidence <lb/>of both skilled and unskilled workers moving abroad, often to Portuguese speaking countries like Brazil or <lb/>Angola. <lb/>The financial and sovereign debt crises have exacerbated long-standing weaknesses of the Portuguese <lb/>labour market, rooted in defective institutional settings in employment protection legislation, <lb/>unemployment benefits, active labour market policies, and wage setting mechanisms. The unemployment <lb/>rate had been increasing long before the crisis, with long-term unemployment accounting for about half of <lb/>the total. Though overall employment barely changed in 2001-07, there were important shifts towards non-<lb/>tradable sectors, with manufacturing losing more weight in the total than in other countries (2.9 percentage <lb/>points versus 1.9 for the EU average). Labour market reforms are essential to help rebalance the economy <lb/>and return to growth, by fostering labour reallocation from non-tradable to tradable sectors and getting the <lb/>unemployed back to work. Building on recent progress, achieved with broad political support, reforms <lb/>should continue to be pursued without delay, to stave off the threats to social cohesion and potential <lb/>growth posed by high and persistent unemployment and a shrinking labour force. <lb/>Reforms in wage setting and lower non-wage labour costs can help create jobs <lb/>Shortcomings in wage setting mechanisms help to explain the difficulty in regaining competitiveness <lb/>and the sharp rise in joblessness, especially among the low skilled. Wage bargaining mainly takes place at <lb/>the sectoral level (Marques et al., 2009), where collective agreements are often negotiated between trade <lb/>unions (sole owners of the right to negotiate on the workers&apos; side) and employers&apos; associations (generally <lb/>dominated by the largest firms), each of which accounting for only a modest share of total sectoral <lb/>employment. These agreements are then administratively extended to whole industries (through the <lb/>portarias de extensão), setting a myriad of wage floors across the economy and giving extra clout to those <lb/>sitting at the negotiations table. <lb/></body>

			<body>Administrative extension effectively stifles firm-level bargaining, thus contributing to hindering <lb/>competition in labour and product markets (Bassanini and Duval, 2006; Traxler et al., 2001). Individual <lb/>companies can only opt out of a sectoral agreement through a firm-level one, but unless the latter is more <lb/>favourable to workers, trade unions (or, in companies with a workforce of at least 500, works councils <lb/>under delegation of unions) will have little incentive to negotiate. In international comparison, Portugal <lb/>ranks high in the degree of administrative extension (Visser, 2011), which tends to reduce the sensitivity of <lb/>wages to unemployment and thus raise unemployment persistence (de Serres et al., 2012). <lb/>Upward pressures on wages were compounded by very strong minimum wage increases in 2007-10 <lb/>(5.3% per year on average), followed by a further 2.1% rise in 2011. Though contributing to a decrease in <lb/>inequality in the lower half of the wage distribution, those hikes have led to job losses for the low skilled, <lb/>especially among youths and in manufacturing (Centeno et al., 2011). Further, the share of minimum-wage <lb/>earners in total employees rose from around 8% in 2006 to over 12% in 2010. For low-skilled workers, this <lb/>is likely to have led to a major compression of the wage cushion (the difference between actual wages and <lb/>collectively bargained wages), making firms lose an important degree of freedom in alleviating the <lb/>constraints stemming from collective bargaining (Marques et al., 2009). <lb/>In welcome steps, the authorities have halted further minimum wage increases and taken measures to <lb/>promote firm-level bargaining, by lowering the threshold for delegation of unions to works councils from <lb/>500 to 150 workers and allowing that sectoral agreements leave the negotiation of certain matters, <lb/>including wages, to the level of individual firms. Administrative extension was to be frozen until clear <lb/>criteria for extension have been defined and, in preparing these, the authorities have committed not to <lb/>extend any collective agreement subscribed to by employers&apos; associations representing less than 50% of <lb/>workers in a sector and, when that threshold is reached, to take account of the implications on <lb/>competitiveness when deciding on extension. However, in May 2012 some pending requests for extension <lb/>not complying with the 50% threshold were accepted, though with some postponement of the associated <lb/>wage increases. While at a minimum the authorities need to keep their commitments regarding thresholds <lb/>for extending collective agreements, they should go further and abolish administrative extension <lb/>altogether. The latter would in itself promote firm-level bargaining, which could also be fostered by <lb/>providing technical assistance to small firms so as to reduce bargaining transaction costs. Further, the <lb/>minimum wage should be kept unchanged until there are clear signs of labour market recovery for low-<lb/>skilled workers. <lb/>Recovering competitiveness through non-wage channels helps to smooth short run adjustment costs <lb/>and the associated employment losses. Instead of a fiscal devaluation tax reform, recommended in OECD <lb/>(2010a) and initially foreseen under the EU-IMF financial assistance programme, the authorities have <lb/>opted (in the context of the recent Labour Code reform) for an increase in working time of up to seven <lb/>days per year (suppression of four bank holidays and of the up to three extra days of annual leave granted <lb/>in case of no or few absences), to be implemented in 2013. Other Labour Code changes helping to reduce <lb/>unit labour costs include more flexible working time arrangements (bank of hours), which decrease the <lb/>need for overtime, and additional measures to reduce its cost. While these working time reforms should <lb/>facilitate future adjustment to downturns through hours rather than labour shedding, and be more effective <lb/>than fiscal devaluation in bringing about lower long run unit labour costs, short-run impacts on <lb/>employment could be fairly muted. Varejão (2004) analyses an opposite policy decision (the 1996 decrease <lb/>from 44 to 40 maximum weekly hours) and finds a very modest adverse impact on employment. <lb/>Reducing the labour tax wedge on low-wage workers can yield sizeable employment gains, while <lb/>implying much smaller fiscal costs than a general cut in social contributions. There is evidence that lower <lb/>tax wedges decrease unemployment (de Serres et al., 2012), and that this decrease could materialise <lb/>relatively quickly, especially for young people (OECD, 2012), in contrast with the more muted short-run <lb/>benefits from other labour market reforms. Potential employment gains from lowering tax wedges are also <lb/></body>

			<body>maximised by the high wage elasticities of labour demand in Portugal (Marques et al., 2009) and by past <lb/>minimum wage hikes (which took the minimum-to-median wage ratio from 51 to 56% in 2006-10, against <lb/>an average of 48% across 22 OECD countries in the latter year). As wages in tradable sectors tend to lie <lb/>below the Portuguese average (OECD, 2010a), targeting a social contributions cut on those earning less <lb/>than a certain threshold could also yield short-run gains in external competitiveness. Narrower targeting <lb/>(e.g. temporary cuts requiring net employment gains at firm level, such as those recently introduced under <lb/>the Impulso Jovem programme, targeted at long-term unemployed aged 18-30) implies lower fiscal costs <lb/>and deadweight losses. However, it tends to be harder to monitor and administer, less effective in terms of <lb/>employment (job creation could be deterred by the limited duration of the subsidy, or have a similar <lb/>limited duration), and more likely to distort competition between firms (different job subsidies to otherwise <lb/>similar firms based on the timing of hiring). The authorities should introduce an open-ended cut in <lb/>employers&apos; social contributions on low-wage workers, to the extent that compensating measures can ensure <lb/>that fiscal targets are met. <lb/>Recent increases in the level and coverage of the VAT standard rate make it more challenging to cut <lb/>social contributions while ensuring budget neutrality through compensating measures. It is indeed crucial <lb/>that any eventual reduction in social contributions does not endanger fiscal targets. However, property <lb/>taxes could offer some room for manoeuvre. Despite a large housing stock (Figure 2.9), their share in GDP <lb/>has long been low (1.1% in 2009, against 1.8% for the OECD as a whole), and will remain below-average <lb/>even once their expected contribution to budget consolidation in 2013 (around 0.15% of GDP) is pencilled <lb/>in. Revenues from recurrent taxes on immovable property, which accrue to municipalities, are set to <lb/>increase beyond 2013 (as the higher tax liability stemming from the updated property taxable values will <lb/>be phased in gradually), and could free central government resources if transfers to local government are <lb/>concomitantly reduced. In addition, targeting the cut on low-wage workers only (as opposed to a system of <lb/>progressive rates, simulated in Bank of Portugal et al., 2011) would significantly reduce potential budget <lb/>costs, though it would also require that the authorities smooth the discontinuity in marginal rates around <lb/>the threshold, to minimise distortions to the wage distribution, and tackle through stepped up monitoring <lb/>and sanctions the increased incentive for under-declaration of earnings. <lb/>Further reducing segmentation is key to improved labour market performance <lb/>High employment protection on regular contracts and the ensuing labour market segmentation lower <lb/>the sensitivity of wages to unemployment (de Serres et al., 2012) and harm firm performance and <lb/>productivity growth in different ways. The mobility and reallocation of insiders is hindered, whereas <lb/>outsiders are caught in a vicious circle of high job rotation and underinvestment in human capital (Centeno <lb/>and Novo, 2012). The 2009 Labour Code reform, which mainly focussed on reducing procedural <lb/>inconveniences and notice periods for dismissals, still left Portugal with the highest protection for regular <lb/>workers in the OECD (Figure 13), and with one of the largest gaps in protection between open-ended and <lb/>temporary contracts. <lb/>A new round of Labour Code reforms, started in 2011 and further pursued in 2012, has tackled the <lb/>more thorny issues of severance pay and causes for dismissal, taking Portugal closer to the OECD average. <lb/>Individual dismissals grounded on job redundancy no longer need to follow a pre-defined seniority order, <lb/>while those grounded on worker capability become possible in a wider range of circumstances (for <lb/>instance, new technologies or other changes to the job are no longer a necessary condition) and the <lb/>employer no longer needs to attempt a transfer to a possible suitable position. Severance pay has been <lb/>reduced from 30 to 20 days per year of tenure, with a 12-month ceiling instead of a 3-month floor (while <lb/>preserving accrued-to-date entitlements, as discussed below), which is still high by international standards. <lb/></body>

The authorities should therefore further <lb/>reduce severance pay, as envisaged under the financial assistance programme, and do more to tackle <lb/>duality. A step forward would be to increase the trial period for open-ended contracts (currently 90 days <lb/>for most workers), though an excessively long duration would risk making open-ended contracts being <lb/>used as temporary ones. To avoid excessively protracted temporary jobs, the authorities should also ensure <lb/>that the extension of the maximum number and cumulated duration of successive fixed-term contracts, <lb/>enacted in January 2012, expires as planned at end-2014 and is not renewed. <lb/>Duality also stems from the procedural costs of dismissing permanent workers (Centeno and Novo, <lb/>2012), especially when litigation is involved, as court decisions are slow and not always uniform across <lb/>territorial jurisdictions. Further, it remains to be seen how courts will deal with some of the new legal <lb/>provisions, such as the firms&apos; obligation, in dismissals for job redundancy, to define relevant and non-<lb/>discriminatory criteria to replace the previous seniority rule. To reduce delays and uncertainty, which <lb/>penalise firms and workers alike, the authorities should, as envisaged, introduce binding arbitration <lb/>(entered into on a voluntary basis) as an alternative to the judicial system in cases of dismissals. In the <lb/>medium term, a possibility deserving further examination would be to abolish duality altogether by moving <lb/>to a single employment contract (a flexible open-ended contract). <lb/>Reducing job protection on regular contracts takes time to yield productivity gains, as the reallocation <lb/>of workers to better job matchings is a gradual process, and under harsh macroeconomic conditions may <lb/>actually induce short-run employment losses, if lay-offs outpace job creation (Bouis et al., 2012).

This could be addressed by the creation of individual severance accounts, <lb/>portable when changing jobs and paid from a compensation fund financed by employers&apos; contributions. <lb/>While plans to set up that fund have yet to be detailed, the authorities should avoid increasing non-wage <lb/>labour costs in the current macroeconomic conditions, which could imply postponing the introduction of <lb/>the scheme. <lb/>Active and passive labour market policies need further reform and integration <lb/>The unemployment benefit system has long raised concerns both as regards labour market <lb/>performance and social equity. Internationally high replacement rates for older workers (OECD, 2010a), <lb/>essentially driven by benefit duration strongly increasing with age, help to explain high long-term <lb/>unemployment among those workers (Addison and Portugal, 2008) and may raise reservation wages <lb/>(Marques et al., 2009). Further, tight eligibility requirements, such as long contributory periods for <lb/>employees and the exclusion of the self-employed, have led to a below-average coverage of unemployment <lb/>benefits, made worse by the withdrawal of 2009/10 temporary measures to ease access and extend duration <lb/>(Figure 14). Unsurprisingly, coverage ratios increase with age (from 8.5% for 15-24 year-olds and 30% in <lb/>the 25-34 age range to 71.4% for those over 45, 2011 data), reflecting age-dependent benefit duration and, <lb/>above all, that those on the fringes of the labour market (e.g. with short temporary contracts or de facto <lb/>employees forced to be formally self-employed) are mostly young workers. Limited benefit coverage of <lb/>the latter is all the more worrying as there is some indication that austerity measures in Portugal could be <lb/>imposing a heavy burden on poor households with children (Callan et al., 2011). <lb/>Figure 14. Ratio of unemployment benefit recipients to the number of unemployed <lb/>1 <lb/>2010² <lb/>1. <lb/>Recipients of programmes classified as unemployment insurance or unemployment assistance divided by Labour Force Survey <lb/>unemployment. Due to institutional specificities, the programme classification cannot ensure perfect cross-country <lb/>comparability. The ratio for Portugal was 0.57 in 2010 which dropped to 0.42 in 2011 (0.46 adjusting for the break in series at <lb/>end 2010). The OECD aggregate is an unweighted average of data shown. <lb/>2. <lb/>2008 for Norway. <lb/>Source: OECD (2012), OECD Employment and Labour Market Statistics (database), July and Ministry of Solidarity and Social <lb/>Security. <lb/>The 2012 reform of unemployment benefits goes some way towards addressing the concerns above, <lb/>but benefit duration remains heavily age-dependent. Eligibility has been expanded by lowering the <lb/>minimum required contributory period for unemployment insurance from 15 to 12 months, with effect <lb/>from 1 July, and by extending benefit entitlement to self-employed workers who get at least 80% of their <lb/>annual income from a single entity (often de facto employees), though in this case a number of additional <lb/>0.0 <lb/>0.2 <lb/>0.4 <lb/>0.6 <lb/>0.8 <lb/>1.0 <lb/>1.2 <lb/>1.4 <lb/>1.6 <lb/>1.8 <lb/>0.0 <lb/>0.2 <lb/>0.4 <lb/>0.6 <lb/>0.8 <lb/>1.0 <lb/>1.2 <lb/>1.4 <lb/>1.6 <lb/>1.8 <lb/>SVK <lb/>POL <lb/>CHL <lb/>EST <lb/>NZL <lb/>SVN <lb/>ITA <lb/>PRT <lb/>2011 <lb/>CZE <lb/>NOR <lb/>GRC <lb/>CAN <lb/>SWE <lb/>PRT <lb/>GBR <lb/>CHE <lb/>ESP <lb/>LUX <lb/>OECD <lb/>DNK <lb/>HUN <lb/>ISR <lb/>FIN <lb/>FRA <lb/>AUS <lb/>DEU <lb/>BEL <lb/>AUT <lb/>IRL <lb/>NLD <lb/></body>

			<body>requirements will defer any practical application until 2013. Further, in 2012, as in 2010, a 10% increase in <lb/>unemployment insurance will be granted to lone parents or unemployed couples with children. To tackle <lb/>disincentives to work, the ceiling on unemployment insurance has been lowered by one sixth, a 10% <lb/>benefit reduction applies after six months, and older workers will see larger cuts in unemployment <lb/>insurance duration. However, for those 40 and over, the cuts in duration will be partly compensated by <lb/>longer provision of unemployment assistance (subsídio social de desemprego – a smaller, means-tested <lb/>benefit paid when entitlement to unemployment insurance ends), so that total benefit duration decreases <lb/>only slightly. Furthermore, current benefit recipients are largely unaffected, and current workers will be <lb/>entitled to benefits under the old rules in their first post-reform unemployment spell, compounding the risk <lb/>that the reform will do little to tackle high long-term unemployment among older workers. Benefit duration <lb/>should therefore be revisited and made age-independent, with much faster phasing-in provisions. The <lb/>authorities should also assess whether changes to eligibility prove effective in improving benefit coverage, <lb/>especially for young workers. <lb/>Job search assistance, generally a cost-effective active labour market policy (Card et al., 2010), has <lb/>substantial room for improvement in Portugal. The few existing formal studies point to only a modest <lb/>impact on unemployment duration (Centeno et al., 2009), and the share in total hiring of public <lb/>employment service (PES) vacancy registration and placements (around 23 and 13% in the mid-2000s, <lb/>respectively) are on the low side by international standards (Duell et al., 2010, Table 3.4). Reasons include <lb/>poor targeting of resources on those jobseekers most in need of assistance, shortcomings in job search <lb/>monitoring and sanctions for non-compliance (further discussed below), low outreach to employers, an <lb/>inefficient use of available information when matching jobseekers to posted vacancies, and limited <lb/>performance assessment of PES centres and associated networks (such as the Gabinetes de Inserção <lb/>Profissional, created in 2009). Some of these problems were likely compounded by a lack of resources, as <lb/>the PES budget and staff have not kept pace with rising unemployment (Table 2). In a welcome step, the <lb/>government has recently launched a programme for PES reform (Box 2), with measures to address the <lb/>above weaknesses and clear deadlines for implementation. The authorities should carefully monitor the <lb/>programme&apos;s impacts to inform further improvements. To foster compliance with deadlines, periodic <lb/>information on the roll-out of the different measures should be made public. <lb/>Table 2.

			<body>Box 2. The Programme for PES Reform <lb/>In February 2012, the authorities announced an integrated set of measures to make job search assistance more <lb/>effective, the Programa de Relançamento do Serviço Público de Emprego. This programme aims at increasing public <lb/>employment service (PES) placements by 50% and PES vacancy registrations by 20% until end-2013, inter alia <lb/>through: <lb/>•  Providing job search training within two weeks of jobseeker registration, closer interaction with jobseekers<lb/>and the use of profiling tools to identify those at greatest risk of long-term unemployment. <lb/>•  More effective procedures in collecting and disseminating vacancies, including the promotion of<lb/>partnerships with employer associations. <lb/>•  Greater cooperation with temporary work and private placement agencies.<lb/>•  Upgrading information technology systems to allow more interactions through internet and a better<lb/>jobseeker-vacancy matching. <lb/>•  Better linkages between active and passive measures, such as steps to curb fraud in proving compliance<lb/>with job search requirements. <lb/>•  Streamlining of active labour market programme offers and an assessment of their effectiveness.<lb/>•  Restructuring of the PES agencies network and systematic assessment of their performance.<lb/>Job search and availability requirements, underpinned by systematic monitoring and credible <lb/>sanctions, are important criteria for unemployment benefits eligibility, as they often lead to higher outflows <lb/>from joblessness and shorter unemployment duration (Johnson and Klepinger, 1994; Graversen and van <lb/>Ours, 2008). According to the letter of relevant rules, Portugal has the highest overall strictness of benefit <lb/>eligibility among 36 OECD or EU countries (Venn, 2012), with one sole area of leniency (no job search <lb/>requirements during participation in active labour market programmes [ALMP]). However, monitoring and <lb/>sanctions in practice appear far less rigorous. Job search proof must be provided every fortnight but <lb/>minimum standards are often undemanding (e.g. one action per week among a large menu of valid steps, <lb/>like applying to vacancies, attending interviews or sending out spontaneous job applications). Further, few <lb/>unemployment benefit recipients actually receive sanctions, which may be partly explained by the severity <lb/>of the penalties itself (benefit is permanently lost, rather than temporarily reduced or suspended). In 2011, <lb/>only 1.7% saw their job centre registration and benefit entitlement cancelled, a fairly low figure in <lb/>international comparison (Gray, 2003). Job search monitoring should be stepped up, with search <lb/>requirements made more demanding and extended to ALMP participants, and effective sanction <lb/>enforcement. To support the latter, benefit sanctions should be made less stringent (for instance, a <lb/>temporary reduction could replace outright cancellation). <lb/>With high unemployment, targeted job subsidies may be needed to keep job search requirements <lb/>credible (OECD, 2010b) and to help vulnerable jobseekers get some employment experience, even though <lb/>new jobs may last only for the duration of the subsidy (Centeno and Novo, 2012). In this vein, the <lb/>authorities have launched Estímulo 2012, a scheme requiring net employment creation and targeted at <lb/>those unemployed for at least six months, where employers must provide relevant training and receive for <lb/>six months a subsidy of up to 60% of the salary. The above mentioned temporary cuts in employers&apos; social <lb/>contributions under Impulso Jovem should also be of value on this count. To further stimulate job search, <lb/>the authorities have also made it possible to partially cumulate unemployment benefits and a wage. Benefit <lb/>recipients who accept a full-time job paying less than the benefit amount will remain entitled to half of the <lb/>benefit for six months, and to a quarter for the following six months (subject to ceilings). To increase <lb/>targeting while maximising the incentive to taking up work early in the unemployment spell, this <lb/>re-employment bonus is not available either in the initial or in the final six months of the benefit <lb/></body>

			<page>29 <lb/></page>

			<body>entitlement period. The scheme also includes provisions to prevent opportunistic behaviour by employers <lb/>and employees through collusive layoffs followed by rehiring. <lb/>Programmes involving training, subsidised internships or direct job creation are generally expensive, <lb/>and were substantially expanded in 2008-10 (Table 2). However, the very few existing evaluation studies <lb/>cast doubts on their effectiveness. As often in other countries, participation in job creation schemes <lb/>(medidas ocupacionais) was found not to increase the chances of finding a non-subsidised job (Nunes, <lb/>2007). Internships are useful in helping young people get a foothold in the labour market, and ambitious <lb/>new initiatives in the area, like Passaporte Emprego (a strand of Impulso Jovem), are being launched, <lb/>aiming to provide a work experience and training to around 50 000 young people who have been <lb/>unemployed for at least four months. Too generous subsidies for receiving firms, as was arguably the case <lb/>in the past, could nonetheless entail deadweight losses by displacing unsubsidised hiring. The authorities <lb/>have commissioned a systematic evaluation of how effective different measures are in fostering exit from <lb/>unemployment (see Dias and Varejão, 2011, for a progress report), and should use its findings to carefully <lb/>target programmes on specific groups of jobseekers. They should also remove the current general <lb/>exemption from job search requirements during participation in ALMP, as planned, and design <lb/>programmes so as to leave time for search. This approach is being pursued under the new Vida Ativa <lb/>programme, which aims at providing part-time training early in the unemployment spell. <lb/>Box 3. Summary of recommendations to rebalance the economy and return to growth <lb/>Unwinding macro-financial imbalances while avoiding a credit crunch <lb/>•  Remove barriers to credit reallocation by tackling incentives to investment in sheltered sectors and &quot; ever-<lb/>greening &quot; of problematic loans. <lb/>•  In bank recapitalisation operations, ensure that the potential costs to taxpayers and the final beneficiaries of<lb/>the funds are fully transparent. <lb/>•  Pay special attention to the financing conditions of small and medium-sized enterprises. To make firms<lb/>more reliant on equity and less on debt, alleviate the debt bias embedded in the tax system, for instance by <lb/>limiting deductibility of interest payments and using the increase in revenues to reduce the corporate tax <lb/>rate. <lb/>•  Ensure that the pace of convergence towards the indicative target for the loan-to-deposit ratio does not<lb/>thwart economic activity. <lb/>Removing distortions to capital allocation <lb/>•  Ensure that the new eviction procedures effectively decrease the eviction time of non-complying tenants in<lb/>order to increase the supply of rental housing. Foster urban rehabilitation by cutting red tape and focusing <lb/>existing financial incentives on dwellings for rental. <lb/>•  Reduce the reliance on the real estate transaction tax by levying it only on the initial transactions of<lb/>property. In a second step, consider replacing it by value-added tax. <lb/>•  Ensure that electricity generation support is made cost-effective and costs are fully passed on to all<lb/>consumers. This requires further reducing excessive supports to both wind farms and cogeneration, and to <lb/>fossil-fuel power and large hydro plants. <lb/>•  Given the major progress already made, further expand generation from renewable sources only to the<lb/>extent needed to meet environmental targets, so as to minimise short-run economic costs. In addition, as <lb/>renewable technologies become cost-competitive, phase-out feed-in tariffs or, if still justified, choose more <lb/>market-based support instruments. <lb/>•  Promote greater competition in the energy sector by managing the regulated electricity tariffs phasing-out to<lb/>ensure that consumers switch to the liberalised retail market and entry by new players takes place. In gas <lb/>markets, implement the agreement with Spain to lower cross-border transmission charges to zero. <lb/></body>

			<body>Reforming the labour market <lb/>•  Continue to tackle labour market rigidity and segmentation by further reducing severance pay and<lb/>introducing binding arbitration in conflicts over dismissals. <lb/>•  Further promote firm-level wage bargaining by abolishing administrative extension of collective agreements.<lb/>•  To avoid increasing non-wage labour costs in the short run, delay the creation of a compensation fund to<lb/>finance portable individual severance accounts. <lb/>•  Make unemployment benefit duration not age dependent, and ensure that changes to eligibility prove<lb/>effective in improving benefit coverage, especially for young workers. <lb/>•  Step up job search assistance and monitoring, with search requirements made more demanding and<lb/>extended to active labour market programmes participants, and effective sanction enforcement. To support <lb/>the latter, make benefit sanctions less stringent. <lb/>•  Use training and related programmes selectively, so as to maximise employability gains.<lb/>•  To improve employment prospects for low-skilled workers and ease labour cost adjustment, reduce<lb/>employers&apos; social contributions on low-wage workers, to the extent that compensating measures can ensure <lb/>that fiscal targets are met. <lb/></body>
