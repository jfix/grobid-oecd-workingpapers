	<div type="abstract">Abstract<lb/> Contingent liabilities are major sources of fiscal risks due to the uncertain financial<lb/> commitments they involve. Their effective management, therefore, is essential for increasing<lb/> stability and predictability in public finance.<lb/> This paper explores the role of public debt managers in contingent liability management based<lb/> on the results of a background OECD survey and the information provided by seven task force<lb/> countries. The results indicate that there are certain roles and responsibilities assumed by the<lb/> public debt managers in this field, while the degree of involvement differs widely across<lb/> countries. We also observed that the debt management offices&apos; (DMOs) involvement is more<lb/> prominent in the management of government credit guarantees, while contingent liabilities<lb/> arising from Public Private Partnerships (PPPs) and government sponsored insurance<lb/> programmes appear to be outside the domain of public debt managers in most cases. Drawing<lb/> on leading country practices and lessons from the past, this paper advises public debt managers<lb/> on possible motives and areas of involvement.<lb/> Authorised for release by Pierre Poret,<lb/> Director, OECD Directorate for Financial and Enterprise Affairs<lb/> JEL Classification: G18, H63, H81<lb/></div>
