			<p>As is true for nearly every endeavour, the better prepared one is, the greater<lb/> the likelihood of success. Education is no exception. Young children who have<lb/> learned how to behave in groups and have been introduced to the basics of<lb/> letters and numbers tend to be more open to and ready for the school experience<lb/> than children who haven&apos;t. Pre-primary education serves this purpose well;<lb/> and if all children, regardless of their socio-economic status, had access to<lb/> high-quality pre-primary programmes, these programmes could also help to<lb/> reduce the inequities in readiness for school that are related to pupils&apos; family<lb/> backgrounds. But results from PisA 2012 find that disadvantaged students are<lb/> disproportionately missing out on this formative education opportunity.<lb/> PisA consistently finds that 15-year-old students who<lb/> had attended pre-primary education tend to perform<lb/> better than those who had not attended pre-primary<lb/> education, even after accounting for the students</p>

For example,<lb/> in 2012, an average of 67% of disadvantaged<lb/> students had attended pre-primary education<lb/> for more than one year, while 82% of advantaged<lb/> students had done so. This difference in enrolment<lb/> between advantaged and disadvantaged students<lb/> is observed in almost all PisA-participating countries<lb/> and economies. it is largest – 48 percentage points –<lb/> in Poland, and between 25 and 30 percentage<lb/> points in Portugal, the slovak Republic and<lb/> uruguay. This means that the students who could<lb/> benefit the most from these programmes – those<lb/> from disadvantaged backgrounds – are less likely<lb/> to participate in them. This socio-economic<lb/> divide widened in the slovak Republic between<lb/> 2003 and 2012 as it did, to a lesser extent,<lb/> in Finland, Greece, Latvia, Luxembourg, Poland<lb/> and the Russian Federation; it narrowed, however,<lb/> in Germany, Korea, Macao-china, Portugal<lb/> and uruguay.<lb/> Notes: The change in the index-point difference in the PISA index of economic, social and cultural status between 2003 and 2012 (2012 -2003) is shown above<lb/> the country/economy name. only statistically significant differences are shown.<lb/> oEcD average 2003 compares only oEcD countries with comparable values on the PISA index of economic, social and cultural status since 2003.<lb/> only countries and economies with comparable data from PisA 2003 and PisA 2012 are shown.<lb/> Countries and economies are ranked in ascending order of the index-point difference in the PisA index of economic, social and cultural status between students who<lb/> reported in 2012 that they had attended pre-primary education (ISCED 0) for more than one year and those who hadn&apos;t.<lb/></table>

			<p>The bottom line: PISA results consistently show that a 15-year-old student – regardless<lb/> of his or her background – who had attended pre-primary school for at least one<lb/> year performs better in mathematics than a student who hadn&apos;t. That pre-primary<lb/> enrolment rates are growing faster among advantaged students than among<lb/> disadvantaged students signals that countries have to work harder to ensure<lb/> that all families, particularly disadvantaged families, have access to high-quality<lb/> pre-primary education, and to information about such programmes, near<lb/> where they live. An investment in early education, both for parents and<lb/> for governments, pays dividends later on in life.<lb/></p>

			<p>, that difference had grown to<lb/> 51 score points. This difference in mathematics<lb/> performance grew by more than 25 score points<lb/> in the czech Republic, Finland, Greece, iceland,<lb/> italy, Luxembourg, the slovak Republic, spain and<lb/> Thailand. in all of these countries, pre-primary<lb/> enrolment rates increased significantly during<lb/> the period; in Finland, Luxembourg and Portugal,<lb/> they grew by more than five percentage points.<lb/> one reason for the increase in<lb/> the performance gap lies in the fact that<lb/> 15-year-old students who had not attended<lb/> pre-primary education tend to be more<lb/> socio-economically disadvantaged. Given<lb/> the overall growth in participation rates,<lb/> students who reported in 2012 that they<lb/> had not attended pre-primary education<lb/> may have come from particularly<lb/> disadvantaged backgrounds. Taken<lb/> together, these findings show a strong<lb/> relationship between attendance<lb/> in pre-primary school and higher<lb/> scores in mathematics later on.</p>
