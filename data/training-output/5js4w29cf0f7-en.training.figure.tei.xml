At the time, household waste was growing at 3% a year. As a result, the United<lb/> Kingdom has adopted a range of approaches to tackle food waste and between 2007 and 2012<lb/> household food waste decreased by 15% which equates to an estimated 1.3 Mt reduction in<lb/> food waste over a five year period. New data on historical changes and a scenario analysis of<lb/> what may be achievable in the future suggests that between 2015 and 2025 around 20 Mt of<lb/> food waste could be prevented in the United Kingdom (WRAP, 2014d).</figDesc>

            <figDesc>The breakdown of this 15 Mt of food waste is illustrated in Figure 7 and Annex 2.A. In<lb/> comparison around 43 Mt of food are purchased in the United Kingdom (Defra 2013c;<lb/> WRAP, 2013d) (the majority for in home use), meaning that the amount of food wasted<lb/> throughout the supply chain is equivalent to around a third of that purchased. In addition to<lb/> food waste there are also 2.2 Mt of food or food by-products from food manufacturing used as<lb/> animal feed, and another 2 Mt of animal by-products sent to rendering plants. Annexes 2.B<lb/> and 2C illustrate the &apos;food loop&apos; in the United Kingdom, and the initiatives directed at reducing food waste around the loop. This updated, detailed evidence base will allow<lb/> Governments, WRAP and its partners to make strategic decisions regarding the prevention,<lb/> collection and treatment of food waste. It will enable the approaches and materials aimed at<lb/> delivering this to be refreshed and targeted, bringing benefits to individuals, communities,<lb/> businesses and the United Kingdom as a whole.</figDesc>
