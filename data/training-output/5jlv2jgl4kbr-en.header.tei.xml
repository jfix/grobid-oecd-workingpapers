Concerns<lb/> about high and rising public debt, together with market pressure in some cases, led to sharp fiscal consolidation in<lb/> 2011-13, against the backdrop of a weak economic situation at the time, which is considered to have made the<lb/> recession deeper and longer. Consolidation has slowed down afterwards, but countries with fiscal space have made<lb/> limited use of the leeway allowed under EU fiscal rules to support euro area aggregate demand. The expenditure<lb/> composition has generally become less growth-friendly, with large cuts in public investment. On the revenue side,<lb/> already high taxes on labour have tended to increase further. Structural reforms with direct positive implications for<lb/> the composition or efficiency of public finances have stalled.<lb/> While most policy levers to improve public finances remain at the country level, European and national policies can<lb/> be mutually reinforcing in fiscal governance and public investment. To achieve a euro area fiscal stance that fosters<lb/> the recovery, countries with fiscal space under the Stability and Growth Pact rules should use budgetary support to<lb/> raise growth, and existing incentives and flexibility should be taken advantage of to pursue reforms of tax and<lb/> spending policies. At the national level, it is essential to further upgrade budgetary frameworks, including through the<lb/> adoption of expenditure rules and regular performance of spending reviews. To promote capital formation and make<lb/> it more effective, EU budget resources for investment should be deployed in a way to crowd in national public funds<lb/> and private financing, and foster greater investment productivity. At the national level, better coordination of<lb/> investment across levels of government and upgraded administrative capacity would increase investment efficiency.<lb/> This Working Paper relates to the 2016 OECD Economic Survey of the euro area<lb/> (www.oecd.org/eco/surveys/economic-survey-european-union-and-euro-area.htm)<lb/> JEL classification codes: E62, F45, H20, H50, H54, H61<lb/></p>
