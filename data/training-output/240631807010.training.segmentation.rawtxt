paper investigates the implications of euro adoption in the Slovak Republic for inflation and interest rates with an 
attempt to quantify their likely size as well as their consequences for the general public. The empirical analysis – 
which makes use of the experience of the first-wave euro area countries – suggests that the cash changeover will 
most likely be associated with a moderate increase in consumer prices, estimated at around 0.3%. Policy measures to 
reduce this effect include public information campaigns, the conversion of publicly administered prices with the exact 
conversion rate and the reduction of administrative obstacles to increase supply. The minor purchasing power losses 
associated with this price increase will not be evenly distributed across the population with higher income households 
and families with children expected to be harder hit than others. Even though the exchange rate vis-à-vis the euro area 
will be irrevocably fixed, past appreciations of the koruna are still likely to pass-through to some downward pressure 
on consumer prices, with the cumulative effect estimated to amount to around 1.5% up to mid-2009. In the longer 
run, the Balassa-Samuelson effect and other factors affecting catch-up economies may raise the Slovak inflation rate 
above the euro area level. As capital markets have already fully priced in euro membership, no immediate effect on 
short-and long-term interest rates in the wholesale markets is to be expected for January 2009. In the longer run, euro 
adoption can be expected to foster financial integration, thereby leading to a convergence of Slovak retail interest 
rates towards euro area levels. This reduction in retail interest rates will benefit the general public with mortgage 
borrowers likely to reap the largest benefits. A potential risk of low real interest rates is the emergence of a boom-bust 
cycle; prudent fiscal policy and further structural reforms, including enhanced competition, would help to counter any 
such developments. JEL classification: F36; E31; E43

Ce 
document examine les implications de l'adoption de l'euro dans la République slovaque pour l'inflation et les taux 
d'intérêt avec une tentative d'évaluer quantitativement leur taille probable aussi bien que leurs conséquences pour la 
population. L'analyse empirique – qui se sert de l'expérience des pays de la zone euro de la première vague – suggère 
que le changement des liquidités soit très probablement associé à une augmentation modérée des prix à la 
consommation, estimée à peu près à 0.3 %. Les mesures politiques pour réduire cet effet incluent des campagnes 
publiques d'information, la conversion des prix publiquement administrés avec le taux de conversion exact et la 
réduction d'obstacles administratifs pour augmenter l'offre. Les pertes de pouvoir d'achat mineures associées à cette 
augmentation des prix ne seront pas également distribuées à travers la population; les ménages aux revenus plus 
élevés et les familles avec des enfants pourraient être frappés plus durement que les autres. Bien que le taux de 
change vis-à-vis de la zone euro soit irrévocablement fixé, les appréciations passées de la couronne slovaque 
pourraient encore se répercuter sur les prix à la consommation; l'effet cumulatif des effets retardés est évalué à 
environ 1½ pour cent jusqu'au milieu de 2009. À plus long terme, l'effet Balassa-Samuelson et d'autres facteurs 
affectant des économies en rattrapage peuvent accroître l'inflation slovaque au-dessus du niveau de la zone euro. 
Comme les marchés financiers ont déjà entièrement tenu compte de l'adhésion de l'euro, aucun effet immédiat sur les 
taux d'intérêt de grande clientèle à court terme ou à long terme n'est attendu pour janvier 2009. À plus long terme, on 
peut s'attendre à ce que l'adoption de l'euro favorise l'intégration financière, menant ainsi à une convergence des taux 
d'intérêt aux particuliers vers les niveaux de la zone euro. Cette réduction de taux d'intérêt aux particuliers profitera au 
grand public avec des emprunteurs hypothécaires récoltant probablement les plus grands avantages. Un risque 
potentiel lié aux taux d'intérêt réels bas est l'apparition d'une phase d'essor suivie d'une récession ; une politique 
fiscale prudente et des nouvelles réformes structurelles, y compris l'amélioration de la compétitivité, aideraient à 
résister à de tels développements. Classification JEL: F36, E31, E43

IMPLICATIONS FOR INFLATION AND INTEREST RATES by 
Felix Hüfner and Isabell Koske 1 This paper investigates the implications of euro adoption in Slovakia for inflation and interest rates 
with an attempt to quantify their likely size as well as their consequences for the general public. The 
following main findings emerge from the analysis: @BULLET The cash changeover can be expected to lead to significant price increases in a number of sectors, 
most notably in sectors related to recreational activities. The impact on the aggregate HICP, 
however, is likely to be small. Applying the experience of existing euro area member countries 
on the case of the Slovak Republic, the cash changeover is estimated to increase aggregate 
consumer prices by 0.32% between July 2008 and July 2009. @BULLET The price increase implies that a typical household will incur additional consumption 
expenditures of SKK 504 (€ 16.7) per year as a result of the changeover. The effect will weigh 
more heavily on citizens in higher income quintiles as they spend a larger share of their income 
on recreational activities. The consumption expenditures of citizens in the highest income 
quintile are estimated to increase by 0.11% more than those of citizens in the lowest quintile. @BULLET Product market competition appears to have played a major role in determining the extent of euro 
changeover-related price increases in the first-wave euro area countries. As such, the overall 
lighter product market regulation in the Slovak Republic compared to other euro area members 
and the associated higher level of competition should help containing price increases around the 
euro changeover. @BULLET Although the overall actual price effect of the cash changeover was very small in most euro area 
countries, inflation perceptions increased notably after the changeover as there was a widespread 
feeling among the public that the euro had brought about significant price hikes. Whilst such a 
widening of the perception gap in the Slovak Republic, if it occurs, might contribute to a negative 
attitude of citizens towards the euro, it is unlikely to have consequences for actual inflation. This 
is because in most member countries the effect was perceived as temporary by citizens so that 
inflation expectations remained unaffected or even declined in the aftermath of the changeover. 1.

the euro adoption in the Slovak Republic for helpful comments. A voluntary financial contribution by the 
Slovak government is gratefully acknowledged. 5 ECO/WKP(2008)40 @BULLET As with euro adoption, the conversion rate between the Slovak koruna and the euro will be 
irrevocably fixed, the effect of exchange rate changes vis-à-vis the euro on inflation will 
disappear. As the pass-through is operating with long lags, exchange rate changes prior to euro 
adoption will still affect domestic inflation for some time going forward. This lagging effect is 
likely to reduce consumer price inflation by 1.5% over the period June 2008 to June 2009. @BULLET Exchange rates vis-à-vis countries outside the euro area will continue to change after euro 
accession. As the euro tends to depreciate against the currencies of countries like Poland, 
Hungary and the Czech Republic, which account for 30% of Slovak imports, imports from these 
countries will become more expensive in euro terms, thereby exerting upward pressure on 
aggregate inflation in the Slovak Republic. @BULLET The strong real exchange rate of the Slovak koruna over the past years was at least partly backed 
by the development of economic fundamentals such as the strong rise in productivity in the open 
sectors driven by large FDI inflows. The real appreciation is likely to continue for some time 
going forward, although to a lesser extent than in the past. With the nominal exchange rate 
irrevocably fixed against the euro, any real appreciation vis-à-vis the euro will be reflected in an 
inflation rate that exceeds the average inflation rate in the remaining euro area countries. @BULLET On capital markets, the adoption of the euro will lead to an equalisation of short-term interest 
rates and the vanishing of the exchange rate risk premium in bond yields vis-à-vis the euro area. 
With one-month money market rates already at the euro area level and measures of the exchange 
rate risk premium near zero, this adjustment already took place. The remaining government bond 
spread vis-à-vis Germany of around 50 basis points is in line with other euro area member 
countries of similar perceived creditworthiness and is thus likely to persist after euro adoption. @BULLET Retail interest rates in the Slovak Republic are significantly above euro area levels for loans (and 
below euro area levels for deposits). In particular, Slovak households pay more for their 
household consumption and mortgage loans with long interest rate fixation periods than the 
average euro area household. Deeper financial integration following euro adoption is likely to 
lead to a convergence of Slovak retail interest rates towards euro area levels. This process may 
extend over several years, however. In case interest rates fully converge to euro area levels, 
interest rates for a typical mortgage may be up to 1.5 percentage points lower. @BULLET Among the population, borrowers will benefit more from the retail interest rate convergence 
(through a downward adjustment to euro area levels) than depositors (through an upward 
adjustment of deposit rates to euro area levels) and households will benefit more than non-
financial companies. Most of the benefits of retail interest rate convergence will accrue to the 
population in the Bratislava region, as most of the loans and deposits are located in this area. 
Lower mortgage loan interest rates are also likely to support the development of house prices, 
although the speed and extent of the impact is surrounded by considerable uncertainty. @BULLET Potential policy measures to deal with the impact of the euro changeover differ by the time 
horizon they aim at. In the short-term, measures could be taken to reduce the effect of the cash 
changeover, for example by intensifying public information campaigns, by converting publicly 
administered prices with the conversion rate and by reducing administrative obstacles to increase 
supply. Any programs to compensate for the price level effects of euro adoption should be 
limited to low income groups and social partners should be encouraged to exclude changeover 
costs from wage and price negotiations. Over the medium term, competition enhancing measures 
are important in order to raise productivity in the services sectors. In addition, measures to 
counter a potential boom-bust cycle induced by low real interest rates, in particular in the housing 
market, are essential. 6 ECO/WKP(2008)40 1. 
Introduction 1. 
On 1 January 2009, the Slovak Republic will adopt the euro and will become the 16th member of 
the euro area. Euro area membership will have wide-ranging consequences for the Slovak economy. The 
aim of this paper is not to present a comprehensive evaluation of all effects of the adoption of the euro, but 
rather to focus on the likely consequences of euro adoption for inflation and interest rates in the Slovak 
economy, presenting own estimates as well as drawing on the experience of earlier entries into the euro 
area. 2. 
Euro adoption in the Slovak Republic will be carried out according to a 'big bang' scenario with 
the euro being introduced simultaneously in both cash and non-cash circulation. The Slovak Republic 
opted for a dual circulation period of 16 days during which cash payments will be possible in both koruna 
and euro. To prepare the general public for the introduction of the euro, the government has started a wide-
ranging information campaign with special attention given to sensitive groups such as the elderly and to 
economically weaker regions of the Slovak Republic. Nonetheless, in a survey conducted on behalf of the 
European Commission in September 2007, less than half of all citizens answered that they felt well or very 
well informed about the euro. To help consumers getting accustomed to the new currency, dual pricing in 
koruna and euro will start shortly after the announcement of the conversion rate. Dual pricing will be 
mandatory until the end of 2009, although sellers can continue dual pricing on a voluntary basis for another 
six months. 3. 
As all assets and liabilities denominated in Slovak koruna will be converted in January 2009 into 
euro at a fixed conversion rate (already determined in July 2008), euro adoption should in principle not 
have any immediate impact on prices. A price effect can only arise if another conversion rate than the 
official one is used for converting koruna prices into euro. Motivations for such behaviour could be menu 
costs that sellers pass on to consumers, rounding of prices to obtain a price pattern that is attractive in euro, 
or simply the exploitation of pricing power on the side of sellers. The experience of existing euro area 
countries suggests that the cash changeover into euro is typically associated with an -albeit small -price 
level increase. Slovak citizens appear to expect similar price level effects for the Slovak Republic with 
83% of all respondents in the September 2007 Eurobarometer survey saying that they expect the 
changeover to be associated with increasing prices. 4. 
Adopting the euro as a new currency will also give rise to more medium-term effects on prices, 
notably for a country with a lower income level than the euro area average like the Slovak Republic. As the 
price level in such countries typically converges to the higher price levels of more advanced economies, 
their real exchange rates tend to appreciate. In the past the real appreciation was to a large extent reflected 
in an appreciation of the nominal exchange rate of the Slovak koruna. With euro adoption, however, this 
channel is no longer available and the catch-up process will show up in higher inflation rates rather than 
exchange rate appreciation. This is also reflected in the vanishing of the pass-through of exchange rate 
changes (vis-à-vis the euro) to consumer prices. In the past, exchange rate appreciation has helped to 
dampen consumer price inflation by reducing import prices. Although exchange rate changes prior to euro 
adoption will still help to contain inflation for some time going forward, it can be expected that this 
disinflationary effect disappears after approximately two years and be replaced by an inflationary effect as 
the euro is depreciating against the currencies of other central and eastern European countries that are an 
important source for Slovak imports. 5. 
Apart from the conversion of prices, the process of euro changeover will involve the loss of 
monetary autonomy as the monetary policy decision-making process is transferred to the European Central 
Bank (with the Slovak central bank governor participating in the process through membership in the ECB 
Governing Council). First of all, this means that short-term interest rates set by the central bank are 
determined on the basis of the euro area as a whole, instead of only the Slovak Republic. This change, 7 ECO/WKP(2008)40 however, will not lead to immediate adjustments in interest rates in January 2009 given that Slovak 
monetary policy was already prior to that date closely interlinked with euro area short-term interest rates as 
the koruna was participating in ERM II. In fact, as capital markets are forward-looking, expectations 
regarding euro membership have already led to a significant convergence of Slovak long-term interest rates 
towards the euro area level. At the retail level, however, there is still ample room for convergence and it 
can be expected that over the medium term Slovak retail interest rates will converge towards the prevailing 
euro area levels as euro adoption will foster financial integration through more transparency, lower 
transaction costs and more competition. This convergence in retail interest rate is likely to bring along 
benefits for both households and non-financial companies. 6. 
Through the transfer of monetary policy to the ECB, euro area membership will also have real 
effects on the economy. As a catch-up country the Slovak Republic tends to grow faster and exhibit higher 
inflation than the euro area average country so that its natural interest rate is likely to be higher. This 
means that, during the catch-up period, interest rates will tend to be set lower than otherwise, stimulating 
investment and discouraging savings. This will pose challenges for policy-makers, especially with respect 
to a potential boom-bust cycle of the economy, but also for the rate of return for ageing-related, necessary 
pension savings. 7. 
The remainder of this paper is organised as follows. Section 2 discusses the impact of euro 
adoption on inflation. Whilst the first part of the section focuses on the immediate changeover-related price 
effects, the second part focuses on structural aspects of euro adoption for the exchange rate pass-through 
and the Balassa-Samuelson effect. Section 3 then investigates the impact of the changeover on different 
interest rates, notably money market rates, government bond rates and retail rates. Section 4 then uses the 
obtained results to quantify the associated impact on Slovak consumers. Section 5 concludes with some 
policy recommendations. 2. 
The impact of euro adoption on prices 2.1 
Immediate price level effects of the cash changeover 8. 
The euro cash changeover that took place in 2002 in 12 EMU countries triggered a heated 
discussion about its effect on prices in literally all countries. Two years after the changeover, 95% of euro 
area consumers had the impression that the conversion of prices into euro had been associated with rising 
prices. Similar concerns were raised in Slovenia when it joined the euro area in 2007. Against this 
background, this section will review the empirical evidence on the price level effect of the cash changeover 
in the existing euro area member countries, present results on the likely effect in the Slovak Republic and 
analyze the role of product market competition for the size of the observed price increases around the 
changeover. 2.1.1 
Existing empirical evidence 9. 
Most empirical studies on the price level effect of the euro changeover focus on individual euro 
area member countries. Examples include: Buchwald et al. (2002), Chlumsky and Engelhardt (2002) and 
Deutsche Bundesbank (2002, 2004) for Germany; Folkertsma et al. (2002) for the Netherlands; National 
Bank of Belgium (2002) for Belgium; Pollan (2002) for Austria; Santos et al. (2002) for Portugal; and, 
more recently, Eurostat (2007) and the Institute of Macroeconomic Analysis and Development (IMAD) 
(2007) for Slovenia; and Eurostat (2008) for Malta. These studies commonly find that price increases were 
not a general phenomenon but limited to certain categories of goods and services, so that their impact on 
aggregate consumer price inflation was modest. Most studies estimate the effect at around 0.2 to 0.3% 
which is in line with the estimate published by Eurostat (2003) for the euro area as a whole (see Table 1). 8 ECO/WKP(2008)40 Nonetheless, prices have risen markedly in some sectors, particularly in some service sectors where the 
above mentioned studies have singled out restaurants and catering, hairdressers, cinemas, and dry cleaning 
as sectors with significant price increases. Table 1. Inflationary impact of the euro changeover Study

The range refers to those countries where the impact is significantly different from zero (France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, the 
Netherlands, Portugal and Spain). 10. 
One reason why the euro changeover could have been associated with rising prices is that 
retailers may have passed on the menu costs of adjusting their business to the euro on to their customers. 
While Deutsche Bundesbank (2004) identifies several German service sectors where prices increased by 
more than was justified by changes in the underlying cost factors, Hobijn et al. (2004) argue that the price 
increases observed around the cash changeover generally closely match those predicted by a simple model 
of menu costs. This view is supported by Gaiotti and Lippi (2005) showing for the Italian restaurant sector 
that the rise in the average price of a restaurant meal was mainly due to a greater fraction of restaurants 
revising their prices rather than to greater individual price revisions the price increases. The authors 
interpret this as being consistent with the menu-cost hypothesis. 11. 
Another reason for rising prices around the changeover relates to the need to find new attractive 
prices in euro. 2 After the conversion of prices into euro the prices obtained were often no longer attractive 
requiring an adjustment of prices to the nearest attractive euro price. Chlumsky and Engelhardt (2002) 
show for Germany that in May 2002 attractive deutschmark prices still dominated in more than half of all 
product groups considered, whilst in October 2002 the majority of prices had been adjusted to attractive 
euro prices. Although the rounding effect should theoretically be symmetric (with some of the attractive 
prices being below and some above the exact euro price) there was a tendency by retailers to round prices 
upwards rather than downwards. This is supported by Folkertsma et al. (2002) demonstrating for the Dutch 
retail sector that prices increased at above average rates in market segments where psychological pricing is 
of greater importance. Quantifying the effect of this rounding behaviour on retail prices the authors find 
that it accounts for about two-thirds of the observed euro-related price increases with the remainder 
attributed to the passing on of menu costs. 2. 
Two sorts of attractive prices can be distinguished: convenient prices in which the last digit is equal to zero 
so that they are convenient to pay and psychological prices in which the last digit is equal to eight or nine 
so that consumers are inclined to undervalue the cost of the product. 9 ECO/WKP(2008)40 12. 
One frequently cited explanation for why producers were able to raise prices around the cash 
changeover relates to the phenomenon of rational inattention. The central idea is that the euro changeover 
temporarily raised the information processing costs on the side of consumers as they had to convert euro 
prices back to the old currency in order to assess the price of a product. This increase in information 
processing costs was not matched by an equally large cost increase on the side of vendors as they had to 
perform the conversion only once rather than for each individual purchase and they knew the exact price 
that had to be converted whereas consumers needed to remember the benchmark price in the old currency. 
The high information processing costs might have induced consumers to pay less attention to price changes 
as the costs of detecting them outweighed the benefits, thereby creating temporary market power for sellers 
(Sims, 2003 and Reis, 2004). 3 Ehrmann (2006) provides an indirect test of the rational inattention 
hypothesis, showing that the inflationary impact of the euro changeover tended to be higher in countries 
with medium-complex conversion rates where consumers relied on (imprecise) rule-of-thumbs rather than 
using pocket calculators to convert prices. 13. 
Displaying prices both in euro and in the old national currency reduces the information 
processing costs on the side of consumers and with it the tendency of vendors to raise prices. This is 
supported by Folkertsma et al. (2002) showing for Dutch retailers that shops displaying prices in both 
guilders and euro raised their prices by half as much as shops that failed to show both currencies. The 
importance of dual pricing is confirmed by Ehrmann (2006) who shows that inflation around the cash 
changeover turned out to be relatively lower in countries where dual pricing was mandatory. 4 2.1.2 
Identifying sectors with significant price increases 14. 
In this section, sectors with significant changeover-related price increases are identified for the 
first-wave euro area countries in order to calculate an estimate for the likely effect in the Slovak Republic. 
The empirical analysis makes use of disaggregated data on harmonised indices of consumer prices (HICP) 
provided by Eurostat. The data are disaggregated at COICOP levels 2 and 3, covering respectively 39 and 
93 different categories of goods and services per country. 5 The results at COICOP level 2 will be used in 
the assessment of the monetary impact of the cash changeover on Slovak consumers in Section 4.1 as 
disaggregated data on consumption expenditures are only available at that level; the results at COICOP 
level 3 will be used in the analysis of the role of product market competition in Section 2.1.3 as it provides 
a more detailed picture of the changeover effects and allows making use of a larger data sample. 15. 
A number of corrections are made to the two data sets. First, sectors where prices are to a large 
extent administered by governments or where government ownership is substantial are excluded from the 
analysis so that only market determined prices are investigated. As such, the price indices of health, 
transport services, postal services, electricity, gas and other fuels, and education are dropped from the 3. 
Note that consumers do not actually need to ignore price changes. All that is needed for prices to rise is that 
sellers believe that consumers ignore price changes. 4. 
Dual pricing was only mandatory in Austria, Greece and Portugal. Empirical studies suggest that it was 
also widely applied in most other countries, especially among hypermarkets and supermarkets (see, for 
example, Banque de France, 2002 and Santos et al., 2002). 5 . 
COICOP (Classification of Individual Consumption by Purpose) is a classification by the United Nations 
Statistics Division used to classify consumption expenditures. 10 ECO/WKP(2008)40 sample. 6 Second, whenever a tax change occurred around the changeover period, the price series of the 
corresponding sector and country is excluded from the analysis. 7 16. 
In a first step sectors with a significant changeover induced price increase are identified by 
estimating the following system of equations jointly for all countries that started the circulation of euro 
banknotes and coins on 1 January 2002: 8 π ijt = α ij π ijt-1 + β ij π NEURjt + γ ij GAP it + δ ij D ij + 񮽙 ijt , 
(1) 17. where π ijt is the change in the price index in country i and sector j between July year t-1 and July 
year t, π NEURjt is the unweighted average of the respective variables in the United Kingdom, Sweden and Denmark, GAP is the average output gap of year t-1 and t, and D is a dummy variable equal to unity for the 
period July 2001 to July 2002. Focusing on July-July inflation rates allows capturing changes in the price 
setting behaviour that had already taken place in the run-up to the changeover (i.e. before January 2002) 
and changes in the price setting behaviour that did not immediately occur with the changeover 
(e.g. because of voluntary agreements with retailers to keep prices stable around the changeover). The 
average inflation rate of the United Kingdom, Sweden and Denmark is included in the regression to control 
for other exceptional events that happened around the changeover and that might have triggered price 
increases for certain goods and services such as the bad weather conditions of the winter season 2001/2002 
and the spreading of the mad cow and the foot-and-mouth diseases somewhat earlier. 18. 
In a first step, the system of equations (1) is estimated over the period 07/1997 to 07/2007 with 
generalised least squares (GLS) using price data disaggregated at COICOP level 2. 9 To obtain an estimate 
of the average changeover effect by sector, the coefficients on the changeover dummy are restricted to be equal across countries (so that δ ij = δ j for all i). The results suggest that changeover-related price increases did indeed occur in a number of sectors (see Table 2). Although the size of the changeover effect appears 
to have been quite sizable for individual sectors, the implied impact on the aggregate HICP is relatively 
small. Applying the weights of the different sectors in the aggregate HICP of the euro area suggests that 
the changeover raised HICP inflation in the euro area by about 0.34 percentage points, which is in line with 
previous studies (see Table 1). 10 Employing the same coefficients and the weights of the different sectors 
in the aggregate HICP of the Slovak Republic (as of 2008) shows that the price effect in the 
Slovak Republic is likely to be of similar magnitude than in the first-wave euro area countries, with 
aggregate prices estimated to rise by 0.32% due to the cash changeover. 6. 
Similar corrections are made by Lünnemann and Mathä (2005) and Ehrmann (2006). 7. 
The relevant tax changes comprise an increase in the maximum price of certain types of bread in Belgium 
in July 2001, the abolition of radio and TV license fees in Belgium in April 2002, an increase in French 
tobacco taxes in January 2002, an increase in German taxes on tobacco, energy and insurance products in 
January 2002, an increase in municipal taxes and levies in the Netherlands in January 2002, and an increase 
in taxes on tobacco, alcohol and hydrocarbon products in Spain in January 2002 (see Ehrmann, 2006). The 
general VAT increase in Portugal in June 2002 requires special treatment. All analyses are carried out 
twice, once including and once excluding all Portuguese data. As the conclusions remain unaffected, only 
the results including the Portuguese data are reported in the paper. 8. 
The equation is similar to the ones used by Santos et al. (2002) and Ercolani and Dutta (2006) to 
investigate the price effect of the cash changeover. 9 . 
This sample period is chosen due to data availability. 10. 
The calculations take into account both significant price rises and significant price declines around the 
changeover period. Significant price declines were identified for other major durables for recreation and 
culture and for other personal effects. Only taking into account significant price increases leads to a 
changeover effect of 0.36 percentage points. 11 ECO/WKP(2008)40 Table 2. Sectors with significant changeover-related price increases Sector

Next, the system of equations (1) is estimated using data disaggregated at COICOP level 3. To 
obtain a detailed sector and country breakdown of the changeover effect this time all coefficients, 
including the one on the changeover dummy are allowed to vary across countries and sectors. Significant 
changeover effects are again identified mostly in service sectors such as cleaning, repair and hire of 
clothing, hairdressing salons and personal grooming establishments, newspapers and periodicals, 
recreational and sporting services, domestic and household services, and restaurants, cafés and the like 
where changeover-related price hikes are identified in at least half the countries (see Figure 1 and 
Table 3). 11 This is consistent with other studies on this issue which also identify significant changeover 
effects in these sectors (see, for example, Deutsche Bundesbank, 2002; Pollan, 2002; Chlumsky and 
Engelhardt, 2002; and Ercolani and Dutta, 2006) and also with the results obtained earlier at COICOP 
level 2 as all sectors that show a significant changeover effect in at least one country are included in a 
sector that was already singled out at COICOIP level 2. Figure 1. Price developments in selected sectors Cleaning, repair and hire of clothing

There are also a number of sectors where prices significantly declined during the changeover period, most 
notably major durables for indoor and outdoor recreation including musical instruments; meat; spares parts 
and accessories for personal transport equipment; and insurance connected with the dwelling, where 
significant price declines were identified in four countries or more. 12 ECO/WKP(2008)40 Table 3. Number of countries with significant changeover-related price increases Sector (COICOP level 3) Number of countries with

The number of incidences of euro-related price increases varies considerably across countries 
(see Table 4). Price increases appear to have been particularly prevalent in Spain and France where the 
cash changeover led to price increases in more than one-fifth of all sectors when measured at the 5% 
significance level. In Finland, by contrast, price increases were not very common with significant 
changeover effects in only 6% of all sectors. Interestingly the three countries that had a legal requirement 
for dual display of prices around the cash changeover (Austria, Greece and Portugal) range in the lower 
part of the list, supporting the hypothesis that dual display helped to contain price increases. Table 4. Share of sectors with changeover-related price increases Country Significance level

The role of product market competition 21. 
Several studies suggest that the level of competition also played a major role in determining the 
extent of changeover-related price increases. Folkertsma et al. (2002), for example, show for the Dutch 
retail sector that above average price increases were observed in particular in market segments with low 
levels of competition. Likewise, Gaiotti and Lippi (2005) demonstrating for Italian restaurants that more 
market power (as proxied by a local concentration index) was associated with above-average price 
increases during the changeover. This section will investigate this issue further, relating the changeover-
related price increases identified in the previous section to the level of product market competition in the 
euro area countries. 22. 
Figure 2 plots the number of sectors with significant changeover effects against the OECD's 
indicator of product market regulations in the retail sector in 2003. 12 The figure suggests that a higher level 
of product market regulation (and hence, a lower level of competition) is associated with a higher number 
of sectors with euro related price increases, though the relationship is not very strong. Figure 2. Product market regulation in retailing and the euro-changeover effect 0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3 3.5 4 4.5 0%

To shed further light on the role of competition as a determinant of the price level effect of the 
cash changeover, a number of cross-section equations are estimated, relating the size of the changeover 
effect to the level of competition in the economy and a number of control variables to account for the 
cyclical position of the economy, the impact of the complexity of the conversion rate and for the presence 
of mandatory dual pricing: 13 Λ ij EUR = θ S D i 
S + θ C D i 
C + θ DD D i DD + θ GAP ΔGAP i + 񮽙Ψ i + 񮽙 ij 
(2) 12. 
Details about the construction of the indicator can be found in Conway et al. (2005). The data are taken 
from the OECD's PMR database (www.oecd.org/pmrhttp://dotstat/wbos/Index.aspx?datasetcode=PMR). 
As the database only contains data for 1998 and 2003 data for the intermediate years is obtained by linear 
interpolation. The final variable shown in the figure is the average of the values for 2001 and 2002. 13. 
The choice of the control variables is motivated by Ehrmann (2006) who provides empirical evidence that 
the size of the changeover was affected by the complexity of the conversion rate and the presence of 
mandatory dual pricing. 14 ECO/WKP(2008)40 15 24. 
Where Λ ij 
EUR is a measure of the price level effect of the cash changeover, D i 
S and D i 
C are dummy 
variables equal to unity for countries with respectively simple and complex conversion rates, D i 
DD is a 
dummy variable equal to unity for countries that had a legal requirement for dual display around the 
changeover (Austria, Greece and Portugal), GAP is the output gap and Ψ is an indicator of the level of 
competition. The size of the price level effect of the cash changeover is measured in two ways: first, by the 
difference between the annual inflation rate in July 2002 and the annual inflation rate in July 2001 which is 
the measure also used by Ehrmann (2006), 14 and second, by the size of the estimated changeover dummy 
in equation (1). Whenever the first measure is used as the dependent variable, the equation also includes 
the change in the output gap to control for business cycle effects. 15 25. 
The classification of conversion rates follows Ehrmann (2006) with the conversion rates of 
Germany, Italy and Portugal classified as simple, those of Belgium, Luxembourg and Greece classified as 
medium complex, and the conversion rates of the remaining countries classified as complex. 16 Three 
alternative indicators of the level of competition are used: first, the OECD's summary indicator of product 
market regulations (PMR), second, the OECD's indicator for product market regulations in the retail sector 
(RETAIL), and third, the size of the average mark-up in non-manufacturing industries (MARKUP). 17 The 
use of the indicator of regulatory impediments in retailing is motivated by the observation that most of the 
euro changeover-related price increases occurred in the retailing business. 26. 
Equation (2) is estimated for all sectoral inflation rates and, following Ehrmann (2006), for 
sectoral inflation rates that have increased by more than certain thresholds. Three subsamples are created. 
The first one comprises only those inflation rates that have increased by more than twice the average 
unweighted increase observed for Denmark, Sweden and the United Kingdom. The second one comprises 
only sectors which showed inflationary developments in excess of twice the average inflation rate observed 
over the period July 1996 to July 2001. Finally, the third subsample comprises only those sectors for which 
the changeover dummy in the first-stage regression was significantly positive at the 10% significance 
level. 18 27. 
The estimation results are reported in Table 5. The coefficient on the competition indicator is 
significantly positive in the majority of the specifications, supporting the hypothesis that a higher level of 
product market competition is associated with a smaller changeover effect. The evidence is particularly 
strong for specifications (5a) to (5c) which employ the size of the changeover dummy from the first-stage 
regression as the dependent variable and thus directly control for the national historic pattern of inflation 
and extraordinary events such as the cold winter and the spreading of the mad cow and the foot-and-mouth 
diseases that affected prices also in the three EU countries that did not join the euro area. 14. 
The change in inflation is used rather than its level as the latter would require taking into account country-
fixed effects which is not possible as the explanatory variables only vary across countries. 15. 
This is not necessary for all specifications that employ the size of the changeover dummy of the first stage 
regression as the dependent variable because the output gap was included in this regression. 16. 
Ehrmann (2006) examines the sensitivity of the analysis to the classification of conversion rates and finds 
that alternative plausible classifications yield the same results. 17. 
Details about the construction of the two product market regulations indicators can be found in Conway et 
al. (2005). All data are taken from the OECD's PMR database. The final variable entering the estimations 
is the average of the values for 2001 and 2002, where these are obtained by linearly interpolating data for 
the years 1998 and 2003. Mark-ups in non-manufacturing sectors are calculated based on data taken from 
the OECD STAN database. Using alternatively mark-ups in manufacturing sectors yields very similar 
results. 18. 
When estimating equation (2) for the subsamples, no sectoral dummies are included in the specification 
given that there are some sectors with only a single observation. ECO/WKP(2008)40 16 Table 5. The effect of product market competition on the size of the changeover effect Specification

Comparing the level of product market regulation across countries shows that the 
Slovak Republic is better placed than most existing euro area countries (see Figures 3 and 4). The relative 
degree of anticompetitive regulations is particularly low in the retail distribution sector, where price 
controls and operational restrictions are less common in the Slovak Republic than in other countries. 
Administrative burdens by contrast still create entry barriers to the sector, with administrative costs on 
business weighing particularly heavily on small enterprises. Examples include complicate procedures to 
pay social security contributions, high costs of obtaining permits to operate a business and high costs of 
dealing with licenses (see the 2007 OECD Economic Survey). Nonetheless, the regression results discussed 
above suggest that the relatively light product market regulation could contribute to a high level of 
competition in the Slovak Republic which might help containing price increases around the euro

The divergence between perceived and actual inflation 29. 
A puzzling feature of the euro changeover in essentially all countries that introduced the euro in 
January 2002 relates to the mismatch between actual and perceived inflation in the aftermath of the cash 
changeover. Whilst price increases around the changeover were concentrated in a few sectors with only a 
small impact on aggregate inflation (see Section 2.1.2) the public perceived the changeover as having led 
to general price increases. This mismatch between actual and perceived inflation is illustrated in Figure 5, 
showing the gap between actual and perceived inflation over the period 1996 to 2007. 19 While perceived 
inflation tracked actual inflation very well prior to the euro changeover with the perception gap close to 
zero in all EU countries, the perception gap opened up in all euro area countries after the changeover. In 
the three EU countries that did not join the euro area the gap remained close to zero suggesting that the 
departure of perceived inflation from actual inflation was indeed related to the cash changeover. Figure 5. The perception gap -40 -20 0 20 40 60 80

The sharp rise in perceived inflation around the cash changeover matches well with consumers' 
responses in the Eurobarometer surveys conducted on behalf of the European Commission. In the survey 
carried out in November 2002 almost 90% of all respondents in the euro area said that the conversion of 
prices into euro had been to their detriment; only 3% felt that the conversion had been in their favour (see

Data on perceived inflation is obtained from the Joint Harmonised EU Programme of Business and

prices have developed over the past 12 months? "  The possible answers are:  " risen a lot " ,  " risen 
moderately " ,  " risen slightly " ,  " stayed about the same " ,  " fallen " , and  " don't know " . As perceived inflation 
is measured on a different scale (-100 to +100) than actual inflation, actual inflation is rescaled by regressing perceived inflation on a constant and actual inflation, π t

you personally notice that, in your country when converted into euro, prices have been: rather in favour of consumers; rather to the 
detriment of consumers; or one way or another the rises and falls balanced out? The figures do not add up to 100 due to missing 
answers.

A number of arguments have been put forward to explain the deviation of perceived inflation 
from actual inflation in the aftermath of the cash changeover. Brachinger (2005) claims that consumers' 
inflation perceptions are more influenced by price rises rather than by price declines as they weigh 
purchasing power losses higher than purchasing power gains. 20 Moreover, consumers are likely to pay 
more attention to frequently purchased items than to routine items such as rents and items that are less 
frequently purchased (Del Giovane and Sabbatini, 2005; Pollan, 2002; Fluch and Stix, 2005). Del Giovane 
and Sabbatini (2005) explore this argument empirically and show for Italy that the gap between the 
inflation rates of frequently and less frequently purchased items can partly explain the divergence between 
perceived and officially measured inflation. Less encouraging results are obtained by Döhring and 
Mordonu (2007) who cannot find any evidence that an index of out-of-pocket expenditure explains 
inflation perceptions better than the overall HICP index. 21 32. 
The interactions might have been amplified by consumers' expectations of price increases around 
the changeover as people tend to check data that confirm their expectations less accurately than data that 
disprove them. Research by Traut-Mattausch et al. (2004) and Kamleitner et al. (2004) point in this 
direction showing in an experiment that individuals are biased towards perceiving price increases as a 
result of previously held expectations even when the price increases are not confirmed by the data. In 
addition, the extensive media coverage of the changeover with its emphasis on price increases might have 
amplified consumers' inflation perceptions in a number of countries. 20. 
The argument is based on the theory of loss aversion put forward by Kahneman and Tversky (1979). 21. 
These diverging results might be related to the fact that whilst in Italy the inflation differential between 
frequently and less-frequently purchased items started to widen in the aftermath of the changeover, this 
was not the case in most other euro area countries. 19 ECO/WKP(2008)40 33. 
If the perception gap also widens after the euro changeover in the Slovak Republic, this could be 
problematic in two ways. First, the associated increase in inflation perceptions may contribute to a negative 
attitude of citizens towards the euro which in turn may delay their adaption to the new currency. For the 
twelve first-wave euro area countries there is indeed a positive correlation of 0.76 between the change in 
inflation expectations in the aftermath of the changeover and the dissatisfaction of citizens with the 
common currency (see Figure 7). Figure 7. Change in inflation perceptions and unhappiness with the euro -5 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 0

Second, to the extent that inflation expectations are adaptive, a rise in perceived inflation may 
raise inflation expectations. If individuals set prices and wages with reference to the rate of inflation they 
expect, this might push up actual inflation. As shown in Table 5, perceived inflation and expected inflation 
are indeed highly correlated in the Slovak Republic. 22 While this was also the case in the first-wave euro 
area countries before the changeover, this relationship broke down at the beginning of 2002 with inflation 
perceptions starting to rise and inflation expectations starting to fall (see Table 6 and Figure 8). This 
suggests that consumers did not expect the price increases they perceived after the changeover to continue 
in the foreseeable future. The changeover was thus perceived as having an impact on the price level rather 
than inflation. If the same phenomenon occurs in the Slovak Republic and if it is indeed expected rather 
than perceived inflation that is driving wage demands, a rise in perceived inflation, if it were to occur, 
should not trigger any wage-price spiral and thus not pose a threat to overall price stability. 22. 
Data on inflation expectations are taken from the Joint Harmonised EU Programme of Business and 
Consumer Surveys. The survey contains, among others, the question:  " By comparison with the past 12 
months, how do you expect that consumer prices will develop in the next 12 months? "  The possible 
answers are:  " they will increase more rapidly " ,  " increase at the same rate " ,  " increase at a slower rate " , 
 " stay about the same " ,  " fall " , and  " don't know " . 20 ECO/WKP(2008)40 Table 6. Correlation between inflation perceptions and inflation expectations Jan 1995 to

Structural aspects of euro adoption 2.2.1 
The exchange rate pass-through 35. 
With euro adoption, the conversion rate between the Slovak koruna and the euro will be 
irrevocably fixed so that the effect of exchange rate changes vis-à-vis the euro on inflation will gradually 
disappear. As the koruna was appreciating against the euro, this pass-through of exchange rate changes had 
a damping impact on inflation in the past. With imports from the euro area accounting for over 40% of 
total imports, this effect is likely to be large (see Figure 9). Exchange rates vis-à-vis countries outside the 
euro area will continue to change after euro accession of Slovakia and those changes will continue to pass-
through to consumer prices. This concerns foremost other central and eastern European (CEE) countries 
like Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic, which account for 30% of Slovak imports. As the currencies 
of these countries tend to appreciate against the euro, imports from these countries will become more 
expensive in euro, thereby exerting upward pressure on aggregate inflation in the Slovak Republic. 23 
Hence, while the disinflationary impact from the appreciation of the koruna vis-à-vis the euro will vanish 
with euro adoption, an inflationary impact from depreciation vis-à-vis the currencies of other CEE 
economies will emerge. 23. 
Over the past, the Slovak koruna was appreciating against the Hungarian forint and the Polish zloty (with 
the appreciation amounting to respectively 2.9% and 2.5% per year on average over the period 2000 to 
2007) and remained roughly stable against the Czech koruna, so that the exchange rate pass-through vis-à-
vis these countries had a dampening effect on Slovak inflation. 22 ECO/WKP(2008)40 Figure 9. Country composition of Slovak imports, 2006

The pass-through of exchange rate changes to consumer prices is operating with long lags 
-typically it is assumed that a large share of the effect occurs within one year with the remainder occurring 
in the second year. This means that, although after euro adoption there will be no further exchange rate 
changes vis-à-vis the euro, past changes will still continue to influence inflation rates. Given the trend 
appreciation of the koruna over recent months (the appreciation since January 2007 amounts to over 12%) 
there will still be a damping effect on inflation for some time going forward. This effect will counter 
somewhat the price-increasing euro changeover effects identified in Section 2.1.2. 37. 
To identify the likely damping effect on inflation estimates of the exchange rate pass-through to 
consumer prices as provided by Korhonen and Wachtel (2005), Vyskrabka (2007) and Merrill Lynch 
(2008) are used (see Table 7). 24 Korhonen and Wachtel (2005) estimate a vector autoregression (VAR) 
model in first differences at monthly frequency over the sample period January 1999 to December 2004 to 
analyse the impact of bilateral exchange rate changes on headline inflation. Applying a similar approach to 
quarterly data over a somewhat longer time horizon Vyskrabka (2007) investigates the impact of both 
bilateral and effective exchange rate changes on core inflation. Merrill Lynch (2008) estimate a monthly 
VAR in first differences over the sample period January 2001 to December 2007 for both bilateral and 
nominal effective exchange rates. In the calculations, only estimates of changes in the bilateral koruna/euro 
exchange rate (as opposed to the nominal effective exchange rate) are used. 25 When only a short-and a 
long-run effect were given in the studies, linear interpolation was used to calculate the effect over time. 26 24. 
These studies were selected on the grounds that they also identify the speed of pass-through. Doliak and 
Karmazin (2007) find a total pass-through effect of similar extent (0.13-0.2), which is broadly in line with 
internal European Commission estimates, as reported in European Commission (2008). 25. 
As Merrill Lynch (2008) provide an estimate of the speed of the pass-through only for changes in the 
effective nominal exchange rate, it is assumed that the speed of the pass-through for bilateral exchange rate 
changes is equal to their estimate for effective exchange rate changes. 26. 
There are some indications that the extent of pass-through is time-varying. For example, in the Slovak case 
the arrival of large retail chains between 2003 and 2006 is reported to have raised pass-through rates 23 ECO/WKP(2008)40 The sample starts in July 2006; thus, the data point for June 2008, for example, is the impact that exchange 
rate changes between July 2006 and May 2008 have on inflation in that particular month. Table 7. Selected studies of exchange rate pass-through Extent of pass-through after Study

Source: OECD calculations, Korhonen and Wachtel (2005), Vyskrabka (2007), Merrill Lynch (2008). (Doliak and Karmazin, 2007). At the same time, the authors report that more recently, retailers did not pass 
on cheaper import prices in order to prepare for the costs of euro introduction. Such a time-variation is, 
however, difficult to identify empirically, above all in real-time. By relying on studies with a relatively 
recent sample period, however, our calculations should to some extent take such effects into account. 24 ECO/WKP(2008)40 38. 
Using this approach, Figure 10 shows the impact of past changes in the SKK/EUR exchange rate 
(July 2006–May 2008) on Slovak consumer prices. As can be seen, the past appreciation of the koruna is 
likely to exert a damping effect on consumer prices until at least the middle of 2009. The size of the 
cumulative impact is estimated at around -1½ per cent for the period June 2008 to June 2009 (i.e. inflation 
is likely to be reduced by 1½ per cent over this period); for the period June 2009 to June 2010 the effect is 
negligible. 27 39. 
Although from January 2009 onwards the Slovak Republic will face the same nominal exchange 
rate changes as the other euro area countries, it is likely that the resulting impact on consumer price 
inflation will be different. First, imports from outside the euro area represent a larger share of total imports 
in the Slovak Republic than in most other euro area countries (see Figure 11), implying that any given 
exchange rate change will affect a larger share of the goods and services in the Slovak Republic. Second, 
the country composition of extra-euro area imports in the Slovak Republic differs notably from those in 
other euro area countries (see Figure 12). In particular, the Czech Republic, the Russian Federation, Poland 
and Hungary are more important sources of imports for the Slovak Republic than for the other euro area 
countries, implying that exchange rate changes vis-à-vis the currencies of those countries will have a larger 
impact on Slovak consumer prices. Figure 11.

This assumes that no further changes in the SKK/EUR exchange rate will take place until the end of 2008. 
While theoretically possible such changes are highly unlikely as the conversion rate is set at the beginning 
of July. 25 ECO/WKP(2008)40 Figure 12.

The Balassa-Samuelson effect 40. 
Over the past decade, the real exchange rate of the Slovak koruna appreciated considerably both 
vis-à-vis the euro and in effective terms (see Figure 13). This real appreciation occurred through a 
combination of nominal exchange rate appreciation and higher inflation rates than in the trading partner 
countries. The adoption of the euro in 2009 will rule out any further nominal appreciation against the euro 
and therefore any underlying real appreciation will ultimately be reflected in an inflation rate that exceeds 
the average inflation rate in the euro area. As such, euro adoption will also have consequences for the 
longer-run evolution of inflation in the Slovak Republic. Against this background, this section briefly 
discusses potential explanations for the observed real appreciation of the koruna and reviews the associated 
empirical evidence. The existing literature suggests that the observed real appreciation was at least partly 
backed by the development of economic fundamentals such as productivity and is likely to continue for 
some time going forward, although to a lesser extent than in the past. 26 ECO/WKP(2008)40 Figure 13.

The most widely used explanation for the real appreciation of the Slovak koruna is the Balassa-
Samuelson (BS) hypothesis. The hypothesis was put forward by Balassa (1964) and Samuelson (1964) to 
explain differences in inflation rates and price levels between catching-up economies and advanced 
economies. The price level effect rests upon the idea that catching-up economies such as the 
Slovak Republic are characterised by productivity levels in the open and sheltered sectors that are lower 
than those in the advanced economies (see Figure 14). If tradable prices are given by purchasing power 
parity (PPP), low productivity levels in the open sectors imply low wages in these sectors. If labour is fully 
mobile or wage setting is solidaristic and wages equalise across sectors, wages and prices should be low 
also in the sheltered sectors. As the nominal exchange rate is determined by purchasing power parity in the 
open sectors, non-tradable goods and services should cost less in the Slovak Republic than in the euro area, 
implying a lower overall price level. Whilst the absolute price level of non-tradable goods in the 
Slovak Republic is indeed well below the euro area average, thereby supporting the Balassa-Samuelson 
hypothesis, the price level of many goods that are generally perceived as tradable is also markedly lower, 
suggesting that purchasing power parity does not hold for the open sectors (see Figure 15). This 
observation makes it clear already that the Balassa-Samuelson hypothesis cannot fully account for the 
lower price level in the Slovak Republic relative to the euro area and that other factors must be at work as 
well. 27 ECO/WKP(2008)40 Figure 14.

In its dynamic form, the hypothesis postulates that productivity will improve faster in the open 
sectors than in the sheltered sectors. Rising wages in the open sectors (in line with productivity 
developments) will spill over to the sheltered sectors, thereby pushing up the prices of non-tradable goods. 
Thus, if the productivity differential between the open and the sheltered sectors in the Slovak Republic 
exceeds that of the euro area, the overall price level should rise faster in the Slovak Republic than in the 
euro area. Figure 16 shows that productivity growth differentials have indeed been larger for the 
Slovak Republic than for the euro area, suggesting that this prerequisite for the Balassa-Samuelson effect is 
fulfilled. Figure 16.

A large number of empirical studies have tried to estimate the size of the Balassa-Samuelson 
effect in the Slovak Republic (see Table 8). These studies generally conclude that the effect is relatively 
small, having contributed not more than 1.5 percentage point per year to the real appreciation of the Slovak 
koruna (which amounted to around 7% per annum vis-à-vis the euro when measured based on the HICP). 28 
At first, this seems surprising given the strong productivity growth in the open sectors, particularly in 
automobile manufacturing and electronics, where large inflows of foreign direct investment contributed to 
a marked increase in productivity growth in recent years. 44. 
The transmission of this primary impulse seems to have been damped by a number of factors 
(Vladová, 2007; Égert and Podpiera, 2008). First, wage growth in the open sectors did not reach the growth 
rate of labour productivity; particularly in recent years (see Figure 17). Second, the wage equalization 
mechanism was imperfect with wages in the sheltered sectors growing at slightly lower rates than those in 
the open sectors (see Figure 18). Third, labour productivity growth in the sheltered sectors compensated for 
a certain part of the wage growth so that producers were not forced to pass on the entire wage growth to 
prices (see Figure 19). With productivity growth in the sheltered sectors well below the levels seen in 
Western European countries, promoting competition in the sheltered sectors by reducing administrative 
barriers and enhancing the general business environment could boost productivity growth in these sectors, 28. 
A few studies even find a negative BS effect (e.g. Égert, 2002a; Wagner and Hlouskova, 2004) or no 
significant effect at all (e.g. Égert, 2007). 29 ECO/WKP(2008)40 thereby further moderating the Balassa-Samuelson effect. Finally, although the share of market services 
(only those non-tradables for which prices are market-determined and not administered should ultimately 
matter for the Balassa-Samuelson effect) has risen markedly in the Slovak Republic, it still accounts for 
only one quarter of the HICP (see Figure 20). So even if a given productivity differential between the open 
and sheltered sectors would translate one-to-one into higher prices of non-tradable goods and services, the 
overall HICP would still rise by only one quarter of the productivity differential. Table 8. Selected estimates of the Balassa-Samuelson effect in the Slovak Republic Study

At less than 1.5% per year, the Balassa-Samuelson effect is clearly too small to explain the entire 
observed real appreciation of the Slovak koruna which (based on the HICP) amounted to almost 7% per 
year over the period 2000 to 2007. A number of alternative explanations have been proposed in the 
literature to explain the share of the real appreciation that cannot be accounted for by the Balassa-
Samuelson effect. One widely used explanation is the rising share of non-tradable goods and services in 
private consumption that comes with rising incomes in catching-up economies. 29 This rising share of non-
tradable goods and services affects aggregate consumer prices in two ways. First, assuming that non-
tradables have a higher inflation rate than tradables (such as because of the Balassa-Samuelson effect), by 
increasing the weight of non-tradables within the HICP, aggregate inflation will rise through a simple 
accounting effect. Second, the higher demand for non-tradable goods will push up the prices of these 
goods, thereby raising the aggregate price level. 30 This second channel can only affect inflation as long as 
the share of non-tradables is still rising. As shown in Figure 20, the share has remained fairly constant 
since 2005, so that in recent years, this second channel should have played only a minor role in influencing 
inflation in the Slovak Republic. 46. 
A closely related argument is the rising GDP share of government consumption observed in most 
catching-up economies. As government expenditures are biased towards non-tradable goods and services, a 
rising GDP share of government consumption is likely to lead to a rise in the relative price of non-tradable 
goods, thereby causing an appreciation of the real exchange rate. 31 However, in the Slovak Republic, the 
GDP share of government consumption has actually declined over the past (from around 21% in the mid-
1990s to around 17% in 2007), exerting a depreciating effect on the real exchange rate and thereby 29. 
The idea is an extension of Engle's law, stating that with a given set of tastes and preferences, as income 
rises, the proportion of income spent on food falls, even if actual expenditure on food rises. 30. 
Theoretically, such a shift in preferences towards non-tradable goods and services should only lead to a 
shift in relative prices. However, with the prices of tradables determined on the world market (small 
country assumption) the price level will be affected as well. 31. 
Oomes (2005) confirms this positive relationship between the GDP share of government consumption and 
the real exchange rate for the Slovak Republic, while Frait et al. (2006) cannot detect any significant 
relationship. 32 ECO/WKP(2008)40 counteracting the appreciating effect of the Balassa-Samuelson effect and the rising share of non-tradables 
in private consumption. 32 47. 
As the Balassa-Samuelson effect and the rising share of non-tradables in the private consumption 
basket lead to an appreciation of the real exchange rate via a rise in the prices of non-tradable goods and 
services they can only explain an appreciation of the HICP-based real exchange rate (which reflects the 
prices of both tradable and non-tradable goods and services). The real exchange rate based on producer 
prices (which should mainly reflect the prices of tradable goods and services) should remain constant as 
purchasing power parity is assumed to hold for tradables. This is not reconcilable with the empirical 
evidence as the real exchange rate has also appreciated when based on the producer price index, although 
to a lesser extent than the HICP-based real exchange (see Figure 21). Figure 21.

Another potential explanation for the observed real appreciation is the quality bias hypothesis 
(Hanousek and Filer, 2001; Mikulcová and Stavrev, 2001). Quality bias occurs when statistical agencies 
fail to adequately reflect improvements in product quality, thereby falsely attributing the quality-related 
part of the price increase to inflation. Filtering out quality effects is difficult in practice, especially in 
catching-up economies where quality improvements happen more rapidly than in advanced economies. If 
quality is not fully accounted for in the measurement of price indices, the real exchange rate will appreciate 
as it contains a part of the quality improvements. The quality bias occurs both on the consumer side, with 
households switching to higher quality goods and services as their disposable income increases, and on the 
producer side with foreign direct investment inflows causing a shift in the product mix towards high 
quality differentiated products such as cars and consumer electronics. It can thus provide an explanation 
for both the share of HICP-based real appreciation that cannot be accounted for by the Balassa-Samuelson 
effect and for the appreciation of the PPI-based real exchange rate. Empirical support for the quality 
hypothesis in the Slovak Republic is provided by Cincibuch and Podpiera (2006) and Égert et al. (2006). 32. 
This depreciating effect is likely to have been reinforced by the rising openness of the Slovak economy (the 
GDP share of exports plus imports doubled between the mid-1990s and 2007), which should have fostered 
competition in the tradable goods sectors, thereby holding down the prices of tradable goods. Égert (2002b) 
provides support for the depreciating effect of rising openness for the Slovak Republic. 33 ECO/WKP(2008)40 49. 
Pricing-to-market practices offer another explanation for lower price levels and higher inflation 
rates in catching-up economies. Producers might set prices deliberately lower in catching-up economies 
because of the lower disposable income of households in these countries. As disposable income rises, 
prices are adjusted upwards, leading to inflation rates in excess of those in advanced economies. Égert 
(2007) provides some evidence of such behaviour in the Slovak Republic, showing that the prices of small 
cars are around 10% lower than the euro area average. 50. 
A final explanation to be mentioned relates to regulated prices which make up a significant share 
of the overall HICP. As regulated prices have been adjusted upwards in the past in order to achieve cost-
recovering levels, they can partly explain the observed real appreciation of the koruna real exchange rate. 51. 
Going forward, the factors driving the real appreciation of the Slovak koruna are likely to 
moderate as the country's GDP per capita level catches up with the levels of western European countries. 
As regards the Balassa-Samuelson effect, Oomes (2005) expects an inflationary impact of 3% per year on 
average until 2010 compared with a projection of 1.5% per year by the National Bank of Slovakia 
(2006). 33 A further rise in the share of non-traded goods and services in private consumption might 
reinforce this effect, although any rise in the share is likely to be small as it is already very close to the euro 
area average. 34 Continued integration of Slovak manufacturing production into the global economy should 
lead to a closing of the quality gap with advanced economies and a saturation of the quality bias effect, 
albeit at a slow pace. The appreciating influences are likely to be dampened by continued fiscal 
consolidation in line with the Stability and Growth Pact, which will further reduce the GDP share of 
government consumption. 3. 
The impact of euro adoption on interest rates 52. 
The effect of euro adoption on interest rates runs via financial integration of capital markets and 
is multi-faceted. First, policy controlled interest rates converge to the euro area level immediately once 
monetary authority is transferred to the ECB in January 2009. Second, the premium for exchange rate risk 
imbedded in market interest rates relative to euro-denominated bonds will vanish which will reduce the 
spread of bonds vis-à-vis the euro area. Also, market interest rates will be increasingly influenced by 
factors common to the euro area rather than specific factors relating to the Slovak Republic. Third, Slovak 
retail banking markets will become more integrated with the euro area markets as the lack of exchange rate 
risk as well as lower transaction costs are likely to enhance cross-border financing activities. Hence, over 
the longer term, Slovak retail interest rates for loans (to both households and non-financial companies) 
may converge towards the lower euro area level and interest rates for deposits may rise towards the higher 
euro area level. Of these three effects, the convergence of retail interest rates is likely to have the largest 
impact on the population going forward. 53. 
Financial integration is defined as a situation where there are no frictions that discriminate 
between economic agents in their access to capital, particularly on the basis of their location. In practice 
this means that the same financial products, such as bonds, loans or deposits should have the same price 
across countries. While financial integration has already started in the CEE countries, not least with EU 
accession, the experience from existing euro area member countries shows that euro adoption enhances and 33. 
These estimates are based on historical estimates of the Balassa-Samuelson effect. To the extent that wage 
growth in the open sector will catch up with productivity growth, this might increase the size of the 
Balassa-Samuelson effect. 34. 
The dispersion of the share of non-tradables in private consumption across euro area countries is very 
small. The share is the highest in Austria (36%) followed by Spain, Ireland and Italy (32%). 34 ECO/WKP(2008)40 accelerates integration (ECB, 2003; Baltzer et al., 2008). 35 This is due to the removal of important 
obstacles, such as exchange rate risk, to the cross-border provision of financial services. As financial 
markets become better integrated, economies of scale can be realised and the supply of funds for 
investment opportunities is increased as banks and non-financial companies can tap the large and more 
liquid euro capital markets. Greater integration raises price transparency and lowers transaction costs, 
which should foster more cross-border activities, increase competition in the national markets and result in 
a more efficient allocation of capital as well as a reduction in the cost of capital. 54. 
At the same time, financial integration in the euro area is still far from perfect. While wholesale 
markets (such as the interbank money markets and government bond markets) are already fairly integrated, 
retail markets remain more fragmented (ECB, 2008). For the Slovak Republic, it can thus be expected that 
wholesale markets will continue to integrate fairly quickly with the adoption of the euro -in fact, a lot of 
the adjustment has already happened. Even though integration in the case of retail banking markets in the 
euro area is far from perfect, it is here where the Slovak Republic's markets still have the most catch-up to 
do with most of the adjustment potential probably existing in the business with households (with banking 
activities with non-financial companies already much closer to euro area integration levels). 3.1 
Changeover effects on money markets and government bond markets 3.1.1. Equalization of short-term interest rates 55. 
With the adoption of the euro, the Slovak Republic will give up its autonomous monetary policy 
and short-term interest rates will equal those in the euro area and will mainly depend on interest rate 
decisions made by the European Central Bank. The change in short-term interest rates at the time of 
joining will be relatively small, as i) monetary policy was constrained also before while the koruna had 
been in ERM II; and ii) expectations of euro adoption have already diminished the short-term interest rate 
differential. Indeed, as can be seen from Figure 22 one-month money market rates have converged to the 
euro area level by now. Figure 22.

Financial integration, of course, has already started prior to 1999, as European authorities took deep and 
successful steps to stabilise cross-country exchange rates and eliminate controls on international capital 
movements within what is now the euro zone. 35 ECO/WKP(2008)40 3.1.2 
Exchange rate risk in long-term interest rates will disappear 56. 
Euro adoption also implies that the Slovak koruna will cease to exist as a currency so that the 
exchange rate risk premium embedded in longer-term interest rates, which previously compensated euro-
based investors in Slovak financial assets for the risk of exchange rate changes vis-à-vis the euro, will 
vanish. As the adoption of the euro in the Slovak Republic had long been expected, a large part of this 
adjustment has already been factored into the prices of Slovak bonds. One measure for the size of the 
exchange rate risk premium that the market is pricing for a given country is the difference in swap rates 
between the country and a benchmark country. 36 This measure has converged to zero in all euro area 
countries in the period prior to joining, as can be seen in the case of Italy from 1999 onwards and in 
Greece, which became a member of the euro area in January 2001 (Figure 23). Figure 23.

For Slovakia, the swap differential to the euro area has also already fallen to almost zero 
(Figure 23, left panel), meaning that government bond yields are unlikely to include any significant 
exchange rate risk premium at this stage. Indeed, the current differential between Slovak and German 
government bond yields is already comparable to other euro area countries, such as Italy and Greece 
(Figure 23, right panel). The resulting spread, which reflects liquidity and default risk premia, will continue 
to exist once Slovakia becomes a member of the euro area and its size is likely to depend on the 
development of public finances as well as liquidity conditions going forward. As can be seen in Figure 24, 36. 
The swap rate is usually defined as the interest rate of the fixed leg of a fixed-for-floating interest rate swap 
with ten year maturity. Swap contracts are private agreements between financial institutions (typically 
investment banks) to exchange a flow of interest payments at a fixed rate for one at a floating rate, usually 
the six-month LIBOR. An interest rate swap does not involve any principal to be potentially lost by any of 
the two counterparts in case of default of the other. The counterpart risk for swap rates denominated in 
different currencies should be the same, since the investment banks who deal in swaps operate in all major 
markets. Also, swap rates do not contain a liquidity premium as there is no fixed amount of swaps 
outstanding (i.e. they are created upon demand). As a consequence, differentials between fixed interest 
rates on swaps should solely reflect exchange rate risk and therefore those differentials among euro area 
countries converged towards zero as the probability of monetary union increased up to 1999 (Codogno 
et al. 2003). 36 ECO/WKP(2008)40 the level of interest rate differentials in the euro area tends to be positively related to the level of public 
debt (although the relation is not very strong) and overall credit worthiness (as reflected in sovereign 
ratings), respectively. 37 Figure 24.

The current yield spread of Slovak government bonds vis-à-vis Germany is roughly 50 basis 
points, equal to the upper bound of the current distribution among euro area countries. While the current 
Maastricht debt level for the Slovak Republic of around 30% of GDP is below that of most other euro area 
countries (which would argue for a lower spread), the Moody's sovereign rating of A1 is worse. Recent 
research suggests that credit ratings are the primary driver of bond spreads in the euro area (Manganelli 
and Wolswijk, 2007), probably reflecting the more forward-looking nature of this variable in contrast to 
the backward-looking debt levels. Taking the rating as an indication suggests that the current yield 
differential of Slovak government bonds relative to the euro area is already close to the level that will 
prevail once the Slovak Republic has joined the euro area (similar to the Greek spread, as Greece is also 
rated as A1 by Moody's). 3.1.2 
Increasing influence of common factors on yield changes 59. 
While the level of the interest rate differential will thus still depend to some extent on local 
factors, such as public creditworthiness, the experience of existing euro area countries suggests that, with 
increased integration, interest rate changes are increasingly driven by factors common to the euro area. 
With euro adoption and thus closer integration, this phenomenon is also to be expected for the Slovak bond 
market. 37. 
See Codogno et al. (2003) for a discussion of default risk and yield spreads. While they a significant 
influence of debt-to-GDP ratios vis-à-vis Germany on the spread in some countries, they suggest that 
international risk factors are the more important drivers. 37 ECO/WKP(2008)40 60. 
The extent of co-movement is usually estimated by regressing individual country's yield changes 
against changes in the yield of the benchmark bond (which is the German government bond) (Baltzer et al., 
2008): t

Perfect integration would mean that the beta coefficient is equal to one, i.e. bond yields in all 
countries would only follow changes in the benchmark bond and local news would have no influence. 
Figure 25 shows the estimated slope coefficients for Slovak government bonds and the range for euro area 
countries in the 4 years prior to euro area membership. As can be seen, the beta coefficient for euro area 
members is fluctuating around one since the introduction of the common currency in 1999. The coefficient 
for the Slovak Republic is still below one but given historical experience it should converge towards one 
fairly quickly after 2009. Figure 25.

Effects of financial integration on retail interest rates 62. 
While the integration of money markets and government bond markets determines the underlying 
interest rate level for the economy, prices in the retail markets signal what consumers and enterprises 
actually have to pay for taking up a loan or the interest they receive on deposits. Even though the overall 
interest rate level, as seen above, has converged fairly closely to euro area levels, there still remains a large 
gap between the interest rates on loans and deposits for Slovak citizens and non-financial companies as 
compared with euro area residents. Euro adoption, by effectively leading to a more liquid and transparent 
capital market, will increase competition. This will lead to a reduction in the difference between market 
interest rates and deposit rates on the one hand and between market interest rates and lending rates on the 
other hand, thereby reducing banks' interest margins. 38 Cross-border activity of banks plays an important 38 . 
The high concentration among commercial banks in the Slovak Republic has led to a rather low level of 
competition (which, however, has increased over the last years) (IMF, 2007). Van Leuvensteijn et al. 38 ECO/WKP(2008)40 role in this process. 39 Even though cross-border competition between banks in the existing euro area 
member countries is far from perfect, their experience suggests that over time Slovak retail interest rates 
should converge towards the euro area level. 63. 
Integration is still an ongoing process and retail banking interest rates at the euro area level are in 
a continuous process of becoming more integrated, also reflecting the efforts of the Eurosystem and the EU 
to promote financial integration (European Commission, 2005; and ECB, 2008). As integration tends to 
lead to convergence towards the lower end of the distribution, this process will lead to a lower euro area 
average. Therefore, the assumption that Slovak interest rates converge towards the current euro area 
average level is likely to be a conservative estimate and the extent of convergence might well turn out to be 
larger. 64. 
In order to analyze the extent of integration as well as to proxy the likely changes following euro 
adoption, we use the monthly harmonised MFI interest rate statistics on loans and deposits for households 
and non-financial companies as published by the ECB and the National Bank of Slovakia. They break 
down different loan and deposit categories by type and period of initial interest rate fixation or maturity. 40 
The statistics are available for both new business and for outstanding amounts; in order to better gauge 
changes in the offer price of banks, we concentrate on the rates for new business in the following. These 
statistics are available from 2003 onwards for the euro area and from 2004 onwards for the 
Slovak Republic. 41 3.2.1 
Notable differences between Slovak and euro area retail interest rates 65. 
Turning first to households, interest rates for all loan categories are higher than in the euro area, 
notably for consumption loans (Table 9). 42 For the latter, Slovak households have to pay 2¼ and 
8¾ percentage points (depending on the initial interest rate fixation of the loan) more for a new loan than 
the average euro area household. The differences are smaller for housing loans, where the spread to euro 
area rates is between ¾ (for an initial interest rate fixation period of up to 1 year) and 3¾ percentage points 
(for an initial interest rate fixation period of 5 to 10 years). For the category of household loans for other 
purposes, differences from the euro area amount to up to 1.3 percentage points. 66. 
In contrast to household loans, loan conditions for Slovak non-financial companies in general are 
closer to those prevailing in euro area countries. This holds in particular for loan amounts of over 
€ 1 million where Slovak companies are even paying somewhat less for loans with an initial interest rate 
fixation of over five years than their counterparts in euro area countries. For loans up to 1 million, 
differences are between 10 and 130 basis points. This suggests that competition for company loans is 
already more developed than for household loans. (2008) find evidence that spreads between bank and market interest rates are smaller in countries with 
stronger competition. 39 . 
One example would be Slovenia, where interest rates on loans to households even fell below the euro area 
average recently. Allegedly, this is due to foreign commercial banks entering the market and trying to gain 
market share by undercutting local retail interest rate conditions. 40 . 
The initial period of interest rate fixation is a predetermined period of time at the start of a loan contract 
during which the value of the interest rate cannot change (ECB, Manual on MFI interest rate statistics, 
October 2003). 41 . 
For the Slovak Republic, we use interest rates for loans and deposits in koruna rather than euros as the 
latter represent only a very small share of the total volume (2½ % of total household loan volume). 42 . 
The following and Table 9 refer to averages for the first quarter 2008. 39 ECO/WKP(2008)40 67. 
Interest rates on deposits are generally lower in the Slovak Republic than in the euro area, both 
for households and for non-financial companies. Differences are larger for deposits with a longer agreed 
maturity (up to 1 percentage point for households, up to 2.7 percentage points for non-financial companies) 
as well as for deposits which are redeemable at notice (up to 1¾ percentage points for a notice period of 
over 3 months for households). Table 9. MFI interest rates for new business 2008, % Slovak

Extent and speed of convergence 68. 
Even though there is still significant dispersion of retail interest rates within the euro area 
analyses from the ECB suggest that they tend to converge over time. As can be seen from Table 9 (last 
column), the standard deviation of interest rates across euro area countries differs by loan category and 
ranges between ¼ and 1¼ percentage points. Even assuming that Slovak interest rates only decline towards 
the upper bound of the euro area interest rate distribution leaves ample scope for convergence, at least for 
household loans. The adjustment process, however, is likely to take some time as it will work through 40 ECO/WKP(2008)40 increased competition and reduced bank margins. The example of Greece, which joined the euro area in 
2001, shows that interest rates on housing loans (with an intermediate interest rate fixation period) only 
fully converged by 2007, after having decreased by around 2 percentage points since 2003 (Figure 26). Figure 26.

It should be noted that differences in bank interest rates across countries can also reflect 
differences in institutional factors (such as taxation, supervision and consumer protection) and financial 
structures. This may explain why integration in the euro area is far from complete. It might also influence 
the extent to which Slovak interest rates converge to the euro area level. 70. 
So far, empirical analysis suggests that convergence of Slovak interest rates is already underway. 
One way to demonstrate this is to estimate the following equation, which relates the change in the interest 
rate spread vis-à-vis the euro area average for every loan/deposit category i ( t 
i S , 
Δ ) to the lagged level of the spread (

A negative value for i β is indicative of convergence as loan or deposit categories with a higher spread have a tendency to converge to the benchmark euro area average more rapidly than those categories 
with a lower spread. A higher absolute value for i β is indicative of a higher speed of convergence (with a coefficient close to -1 signalling a complete convergence process). Table 10 shows the estimated i β coefficients for different Slovak retail interest rate categories, estimated over the time period January 2004 
to March 2008. As can be seen, all coefficients are negative, i.e. all categories are converging towards the euro area level. The speed of convergence (higher absolute β -values) tends to be highest for loans to non-financial corporations, suggesting that competition for this category is most intense. Convergence is also high for deposits of both households and non-financial companies. For household loans, the size of the β -coefficient is generally smaller, although for those categories with substantial interest rate differentials to 41 ECO/WKP(2008)40 the euro area average, there is evidence of faster convergence (consumption and housing loans with longer 
interest rate fixation periods). Table 10. Estimates of retail interest rate convergence i α i β p-value i β Deposits Households Overnight

Implications of the changeover for the general public 4.1 
Impact of euro related price increases on different groups of Slovak consumers 72. 
As discussed in Section 2 the cash changeover in the Slovak Republic will most likely be 
associated with price increases for a number of goods and services but only a modest increase in the 
aggregate consumer price index. In this section the implied financial impact on Slovak consumers is 
estimated making use of a disaggregated data set on consumption expenditures provided by Eurostat. 
Specifically, the data are disaggregated at the COICOP 2 level and by income, household type, age of the 
reference person, employment status of the reference person, and degree of urbanisation. 73. 
To gauge the implied impact on different groups of Slovak consumers, the coefficients on the 
changeover dummies obtained in Section 2.1.2 at the COICOP 2 level (Table 2) are multiplied by the 42 ECO/WKP(2008)40 weights of the respective sectors in the consumption baskets of different groups of consumers. As the latest 
year for which disaggregated data on consumption expenditures are available is 2005, the calculations are 
based on the presumption that the composition of the consumption basket after the cash changeover will be 
the same as in 2005. This assumption is of course somewhat problematic, especially since cash changeover 
induced relative price changes might lead to substitution effects whereby consumers substitute goods and 
services with relative price increases by goods and services with relative price declines. As such, the 
financial impact on consumers presented here is likely to be an upper bound of the financial impact on 
consumers. Table 11. Financial impact of the cash changeover on Slovak consumers Price level effect

The calculations suggest that the consumption expenditures of the average households will 
increase by around 0.2 percentage points due to the cash changeover. 43 This implies that a typical 43. 
This number differs from the HICP impact calculated in section 3.1.2 due to the use of two different 
weighing schemes. Whilst the weights used in section 3.1.2 correspond to the weights used by Eurostat in 
the calculation of the HICP, the weights used here correspond to the share of a certain category of goods 
and services in total consumption expenditures. The use of 2005 weights instead of 2008 weights as in 
section 3.1.2 contributes only a little to the difference as the HICP weights of the relevant sectors hardly 
changed between 2005 and 2008. 43 ECO/WKP(2008)40 household will incur additional consumption expenditures of SKK 504 (€ 15) per year (see Table 11). 44 
Different types of consumers will be affected to different degrees by this price increase. For citizens in the 
highest income quintile consumption expenditures are estimated to increase by almost 0.26% compared 
with an increase of only 0.15% for persons in the lowest income quintile, mainly reflecting the higher share 
of recreational goods and services, vehicle purchases and catering services in the consumption basket of 
the highest income quintile. Expressed in monetary units, this implies additional expenditures of SKK 981 
per year for households in the highest income quintile compared with SKK 241 for those in the lowest 
income quintile. 75. 
Comparing the changeover effect across different household types suggests that households with 
dependent children will be more severely hit by the changeover induced price increases than households 
without children as expenditures for catering services, recreational activities and vehicle purchases tend to 
be larger when dependent children are present. 45 For example, the additional annual costs per equivalent 
adult are estimated at SKK 232 for a couple without dependent children compared with SKK 341 for a 
couple with children. 76. 
Households with a reference person aged 60 and over should be less severely hit by the 
changeover induced price increases than households with a younger reference person. Recreational goods 
and services, vehicle purchases and catering services represent only 0.06% of their consumption 
expenditures compared with around 0.14% for households with a reference person aged 45 and below. The 
implied financial impact of the cash changeover amounts to SKK 163 per year for a household with a 
reference person aged 60 and over compared with SKK 560 to 710 for those with a reference person aged 
below 60. 77. 
Looking at the employment status of the reference person shows that the retired and the 
unemployed are likely to be the least affected by the cash changeover induced price increases. For the 
retired the financial impact is estimated at SKK 151 per year and household which, given the large overlap 
between the two groups, is very close to the estimate for those aged 60 and above. This suggests that the 
real value of pensions is diminished only slightly as a result of the changeover. The same applies to 
unemployment benefits with the size of the financial impact on a household with an unemployed reference 
person estimated at SKK 138 per year. 78. 
Regional differences in the estimated size of the cash changeover-related price increase largely 
reflect regional differences in income levels with a higher impact of around 0.26% in densely populated 
areas (which comprise mainly the Bratislava region) and a lower impact of 0.16 to 0.21% in intermediate 
and sparsely populated areas. 4.2 
Impact of financial integration on Slovak consumers and non-financial enterprises 79. 
Slovak households and non-financial companies will benefit from increased convergence of retail 
interest rates towards the euro area level (see Section 3.2), in particular mortgage borrowers as mortgage 
loans currently make up roughly one third of all outstanding loans (and two thirds of outstanding loans to 44. 
It cannot be excluded that some of this cost increase might be regained in the future as prices might 
increase by less than they would have done without the changeover-related price hikes. 45. 
As no data are available for the share of vehicle purchases in the expenditures of single parents with 
dependent children, the share is set equal to its value in the Czech Republic. This decision is motivated by 
the high correlation of 0.96 between the composition of the consumption basket of this household type in 
the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic. Robustness checks show that alternative methods to derive 
an estimate of the share lead to almost identical results. 44 ECO/WKP(2008)40 households). 46 Assuming that interest rates on household loans fully converge to the lower current euro 
area average level, households would benefit from lower interest payment in the order of SKK 6 billion 
(€ 200 million) (Table 12). 47 Around half of this benefit would accrue to mortgage borrowers. This 
compares with around SKK 1 billion (€ 33 million) lower interest payments for non-financial companies, 
reflecting the fact that interest rates for their loans are closer to the euro area level. Depositors would 
benefit from a convergence of Slovak deposit interest rates towards the higher euro area level. Using the 
current stock of deposits, households can expect to receive an additional SKK 4 billion (€ 130 million) in 
interest payments and non-financial companies SKK 1.8 billion (€ 60 million). Total interest savings/gains 
for borrowers and depositors add up to SKK 12¾ billion, around 0.8% of GDP. 80. 
Overall, households are thus likely to benefit significantly more from the convergence of retail 
interest rates than non-financial companies. Within the household sector, borrowers will save more in 
interest payments than depositors will gain by receiving higher interest rates. This static calculation (based 
on current outstanding loan amounts) does not take into account that private credit is expanding rapidly as 
is often observed in catch-up countries. For example, the share of mortgage loans in GDP currently 
accounts for 11% (compared with 40% in the euro area), up from around 6% in 2002. Thus, as more and 
more households become debtors and the outstanding amount of loans increases, the benefits of lower 
retail interest rates will also rise in absolute terms. Table 12. Benefits of lower retail interest rates (in SKK millions) Outstanding volume

loan/deposit category with the outstanding amounts in the first quarter of 2008 and summing up across categories. Due to the lack of 
a breakdown for loans to non-financial companies by size in the banking balance sheet, the average spread for loans above/below 
1 million euro was used in the calculations. The calculation does not include bank overdrafts (for both households and non-financial 
companies) due to the lack of information about outstanding amounts.

Taking into account the current composition of loans outstanding by initial interest rate fixation 
period, the average Slovak mortgage borrower pays a roughly 1.5 pp higher interest rate on his new 
mortgage than the average euro area borrower. In case interest rates have fully converged to euro area 46 . 
Data are taken from the bank balance sheet statistics in April 2008 as published by the National Bank of 
Slovakia and refer to loans granted to residents. 47. 
This and the ensuing calculation are based on applying the interest rate differentials for new business vis-à-
vis the euro area average (Table 9) on the outstanding loan amounts by different categories in April 2008. 
As data for outstanding loan amounts are available only by maturity, we approximated the outstanding 
amounts of households loans by initial interest rate fixation period using the average shares of different 
types of interest fixation of new housing loans granted since 2005. For non-financial companies, we 
assumed the initial interest rate fixation period matches the maturity of the loans. The calculated welfare 
benefits only materialise once the outstanding loan amounts are refinanced as borrowers will benefit from 
the lower interest rates only at the time when they take up a new loan or when they refinance their 
outstanding loan. The same holds for depositors. 45 ECO/WKP(2008)40 levels, a citizen who takes up a new housing loan of SKK 4.9 million (€ 160 000) (e.g. reflecting the costs 
of a 130 m 2 flat at an average price of 38 000 SKK/m 2 ) with an average interest rate fixation period will 
save interest expenses of up to SKK 73 500 (€ 2 400) in the first year. 82. 
Looking at the regional breakdown of loans and deposits suggests that it is mostly the region of 
Bratislava that is likely to benefit from this convergence in interest rates as more than half of all 
outstanding loans to the population fall in this area (Figure 27). 48 This also reflects the fact that in 
Bratislava real estate prices are around one third above the national average. In addition, almost half of all 
deposits are located in the Bratislava region. Figure 27.

Within the population it is usually the younger cohorts who tend to be borrowers while older age 
groups tend to be savers. As the adjustment of interest rates to households is likely to be larger for loans 
than for deposits (Table 12), the younger cohorts are likely to benefit more from saved interest payments 
than the older generation gains by receiving higher interest rates on their deposits. Bratislava

The likely impact on house prices 84. 
A lower level of retail interest rates is also likely to have an impact on house prices as it increases 
the affordability of real estate for households. Apart from interest rates, Beka (2007) points to the 
importance of disposable income, development of credit markets, demographics, public housing support, 
as well as supply of new housing as important factors driving real estate prices. While is it undisputed that 
the past dynamic increase in real estate prices in the Slovak Republic (annual price increases have 
averaged over 20% from 2005q1 to 2008q1) has also been driven by a lowering of real interest rates, it 
remains difficult to isolate the effect of this single variable. Empirical analysis is made even more difficult 
by the availability of only a short time series for house price data for the Slovak Republic (starting only in 
2005). 48. 
Developments for loans since 2001, however, indicate that the regional divergence is likely to become 
smaller. Since 2001 the share of the Bratislava region in total new loans to the population has decreased 
from close to 80% to the current 62%. For new deposits, on the other hand, the share of the Bratislava 
region has increased over the past years. 46 ECO/WKP(2008)40 85. 
Studies on house price determinants in CEE countries, such as Égert and Mihaljek (2007) who 
study a sample of CEE countries (excluding the Slovak Republic due to data constraints) usually find that 
house prices are significantly affected by changes in real interest rates. However, they find a wide range of 
impact estimates and thus the definitive size of the real interest rate effect remains somewhat inconclusive. 
The same uncertainty holds for the speed of adjustment of house prices to real interest rates. For example, 
it is conceivable that prices have already risen in expectation of this future decline in real interest rates. 
Such concerns are all the more important as the convergence of retail interest rates to euro area levels is 
likely to take some time and thus any increasing effect on house prices will be spread over several years. 
Hence, although the expected decline in mortgage interest rates is likely to give a further boost to house 
prices, the magnitude and timing of the effect is difficult to gauge. 5. 
Summary and policy recommendations This paper has studied the impact of euro adoption on inflation and interest rates in the 
Slovak Republic. In general, the immediate impacts in January 2009 are likely to be relatively small. While 
euro cash changeover effects on prices could be sizeable in specific sectors and for particular groups of 
consumer items, the overall price level may rise by around 0.3%, in line with the experience from previous 
countries that joined the euro area. Price effects can be expected to materialise rather quickly, either 
already before the euro adoption or shortly after the  " hot phase "  of price watch terminates. As euro 
membership has been fully priced in on capital markets, short-as well as long-term interest rates will 
probably not change at all in January 2009. More significant will be the medium-to longer term effects of euro adoption. First, as the exchange 
rate vis-à-vis the euro is irrevocably fixed, there will no longer be a damping effect on inflation (from 
exchange rate appreciation) through imports from the euro area, at least after past exchange rate changes 
have filtered through the distribution chain by around the middle of 2009. Second, Balassa-Samuelson and 
other effects related to catch-up countries may raise the Slovak inflation rate above the euro area level for a 
longer period of time, although the size of the effect is difficult to quantify. Regarding interest rates, euro 
adoption will foster financial integration with the euro area and this is likely to lead to a convergence of 
Slovak retail interest rates towards euro area levels. However, those interest rate changes associated with 
capital market integration will materialise only over a medium to long term horizon. Taking into account that the euro changeover will have an impact on inflation and interest rates at 
different points in time, the following policy recommendations are organised according to their time 
horizon. Policy recommendations for the short term – From now to mid 2009 @BULLET Rounding effects should only exert a minor upward pressure on prices. A pure mathematical 
rounding procedure would lead to rounding up in five out of 10 cases while rounding down in 
four out of ten cases. Public information campaigns as well as negotiations with retailers should 
therefore emphasize that euro adoption does not automatically mean rounding up prices. The 
same logic also applies to the transition to a system of new  " attractive prices " . @BULLET Publicly administered prices as well as prices and fees for public services still play an important 
role in the consumption basket for Slovak citizens. The changeover for such price items in the 
public domain should be presented as show case. For such prices the need to charge  " attractive "  
numbers is less evident. Publicly determined prices and fees should be changed strictly 
according to the conversion rate. The euro adoption should be used as an opportunity to 
introduce publicly available price and fee comparisons for public services, like public and 
municipal utilities. 47 ECO/WKP(2008)40 @BULLET International retail chains are already operating in the Slovak Republic. Most of them offer price 
information which is available via the internet. Consumer protection organizations could 
consider to put together representative samples of consumer baskets and maintain a  " beauty 
contest "  for retail chains, which is publicly accessible. Such comparisons should also include 
neighbouring countries, especially Austria and Hungary, which are in reach for a large share of 
consumers in Western Slovakia. @BULLET Calculations show that those socio-economic groups which are likely to experience a larger 
increase in the costs of their consumption expenditure also have a higher income. Programs to 
compensate for the price level effects of euro adoption should be limited to low income groups, 
especially families with children. General transfer increases would only stimulate price increases 
and should be avoided. @BULLET If suppliers want to increase their profits by gaining market share (and not by increasing prices) 
during the changeover period then any obstacles to bring the additional supply to the market will 
deter firms from choosing such a strategy. Remaining administrative obstacles to increase supply 
should be removed and arguments in their favour, referring to health and safety concerns should 
be carefully examined to avoid that such concerns are misused as entry barriers which protect 
insiders. Unavoidable changeover costs, like menu costs, as well as costs related to the handling of a new 
currency for some time in parallel with the current Slovak koruna, are equivalent to a one-off cost 
increase, which – under conditions of perfect competition – will be shared among suppliers and 
consumers according to the slopes of demand and supply schedules. Such cost increases cannot be 
rolled forward into wage increases without increasing wage costs throughout the economy and thus 
putting employment at risk. Social partners should be encouraged to exclude changeover costs from 
wage and price negotiations in the current and next rounds. Policy recommendations for the medium term @BULLET Competition is limiting the scope for misusing the euro changeover for an increase of mark-ups 
and to reap extra profits. A competition friendly regulatory environment, which keeps entry 
barriers low and avoids administrative overheads and red tape, is a powerful ally for the 
changeover campaign. While past reforms have achieved a lot already, much remains still to be 
done and this also includes network industries. Although regulatory changes need time to 
exercise an impact it is now the time to use this opportunity. The government should use the euro 
changeover to reduce and remove altogether entry barriers and accelerate its efforts to remove 
administrative barriers. Where competition is not yet possible due to the existence of natural 
monopolies, regulators should be endowed with sufficient powers to allow the use of private 
networks at fair conditions and to set prices which do not include excessive monopoly rents. @BULLET Financial market integration should lead to lower spreads, not the least because of the removal of 
any exchange rate risk within the euro area. Currently lending rates are above the euro area 
average, while deposit rates are below. Experience from the euro area demonstrates that financial 
sector integration takes time and that it more often takes the form of takeovers than cross border 
expansion. This process has been more or less concluded insofar as domestic (Slovak) banks and 
financial institutions are involved. However, there may be some scope for consolidation among 
the foreign banks. The government should investigate in co-operation with the central bank and 
financial market supervision in how far barriers for the establishment of a more competition 
friendly market structure in financial services exist. In order to reap these potential benefits from 
a pro-competitive market structure it will also be necessary to make sure that the associated cost 
cutting opportunities can be exercised. 48 ECO/WKP(2008)40 49 @BULLET Adopting the euro will eliminate the opportunity to pursue real appreciation via nominal 
appreciation. This is important for catching up economies, which have lower prices in domestic 
services sectors than in richer euro area member countries. This Balassa-Samuelson effect will 
damp real interest rates and can possibly contribute to a boom-and bust cycle. In order to avoid 
such a scenario the government should prepare a comprehensive policy package in order to 
compensate for the loss of monetary policy and the elimination of the nominal exchange rate as a 
channel for real appreciation. Such a package should include: − Measures to increase the scope for competition in domestic services sectors in order to close 
the gap of productivity growth with the (international competition exposed) export 
manufacturing sector. Such a measure would reduce the Balassa-Samuelson effect directly. − Measures to reduce the attractiveness of loan financed asset bubbles, in particular a capital 
gains tax. Such a measure would reduce the attraction of investing in a bubble market. − Maintaining a prudent fiscal stance and avoiding in particular to expand general transfer 
programs. The government should continue to improve the incentives to work as well as to 
search for work and to participate in lifelong learning in order to be employable longer. 
Such measures would increase the overall supply of labour and avoid a premature 
overheating of the labour market. − Establishing a regulatory environment which allows the development of a rental housing 
market. This would reduce the need to enter the housing market as a buyer in order to satisfy 
a housing need. ECO/WKP(2008)40 BIBLIOGRAPHY Balassa, B. (1964),  " The purchasing-power-parity doctrine: a reappraisal " , Journal of Political Economy,
