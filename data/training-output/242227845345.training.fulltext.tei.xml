			<head>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS ............................................................................................................................ 3<lb/> SUMMARY .................................................................................................................................................... 4<lb/> INTRODUCTION<lb/> Background<lb/> 1.<lb/> The release of the report To Err Is Human</head>

			<p>by the US Institute of Medicine in 2000 brought<lb/> patient safety issues to the fore by presenting the magnitude and impact of patient safety problems in the<lb/> US health system in clear detail. Since then a number of other countries have released similar reports with<lb/> disturbingly similar messages for their health systems. This has put the need for improved patient safety<lb/> monitoring and accountability under the spotlight. National administrations are now responding to the<lb/> rising interest in patient safety and quality with efforts to improve measurement and reporting systems in<lb/> these areas of health care performance.<lb/> 2.<lb/> To respond to country needs for internationally comparable information on indicators and data<lb/> systems for quality, the OECD initiated the OECD Health Care Quality Indicator (HCQI) Project in 2001.<lb/> The long-term objective of the HCQI Project is to develop a set of indicators that can be used to raise<lb/> questions for further investigation concerning the quality of health care across countries. In March 2006<lb/> the OECD published an initial report with data that was collected between 2003 and 2005 on an initial set<lb/> of quality indicators (<ref type="biblio">Mattke S et al, 2006</ref>). The results of this initial report from the HCQI Project showed<lb/> clearly that there were only a limited number of indicators available for international comparisons for<lb/> which there was consensus on the importance and soundness of the indicators and the availability and<lb/> comparability of the data. Consequently, the OECD embarked on a new phase of work through the HCQI<lb/> Project to work collaboratively with countries on improving data systems in five priority areas, including<lb/> patient safety. A second round of data collection conducted in 2006 to support this work confirmed that<lb/> there is a paucity of available national data to meaningfully track patient safety.<lb/> 3.<lb/> In part because of the lack of data and in part because of the very high level of interest across<lb/> member countries, the OECD formed an Expert Group on Patient Safety, which met for the first time<lb/> during <ref type="biblio">June 2006 in Dublin, Ireland (OECD, 2007</ref>). The meeting was hosted by the Irish Department of<lb/> Health and Children and was the first multi-country conference organised by the OECD on patient safety<lb/> data systems. The conference attempted to address three issues: a) getting patient safety data systems on<lb/> the agenda; b) developing a concrete work plan for improving patient safety data systems and international<lb/> comparability of patient safety data; and c) addressing how countries should approach linking data to<lb/> action to improve patient safety.<lb/> 4.<lb/> From the presentations made at the conference, it became apparent that the most readily available<lb/> set of data systems for tracking patient safety are hospital administrative data systems. It is noted that<lb/> efforts have been made in a growing number of OECD countries to adapt indicators developed in the US<lb/> which can be derived from hospital administrative data. However, it was recognized that important issues<lb/> still needed to be resolved before these indicators could be widely applied across OECD countries,<lb/> including the construction of translations between different national approaches to data coding and the<lb/> testing of indicators in the context of different country data systems.<lb/> 5.<lb/> The conference concluded with a commitment to increase the potential of cross national<lb/> comparisons of patient safety through two key work initiatives focussing on:<lb/> • Adaptation of hospital administrative data systems for facilitating cross-national comparative<lb/> information of Patient Safety Indicators (PSI), and<lb/> • Reviewing adverse event reporting systems.<lb/> 6.<lb/> As part of the overall effort under the first of these initiatives, this manual seeks to facilitate cross<lb/> national comparisons of indicators for patient safety through the provision of detailed practical advice on<lb/> calculating each indicator selected from a recommended set of Patient Safety Indicators (PSI) 2 utilising<lb/> national hospital administrative databases.<lb/> 7.<lb/> The set of indicators selected for further analysis and specification is summarised in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<p>based research effort that focuses on examining specific data elements and coding issues that currently<lb/> impede international comparability of patient safety indicators based on hospital administrative data. Next,<lb/> an experimental calculation of indicators is to be performed by a group of volunteering countries.<lb/> 10.<lb/> This manual was originally designed to support the calculation of patient safety indicators in a<lb/> group of countries volunteering to participate in the validation of the methodology. However it is<lb/> anticipated that the material presented will also be of interest to a wider audience, including researchers<lb/> and experts interested in the technical background and construction of the Patient Safety Indicators and<lb/> other countries looking to develop internationally comparable health care quality indicators.<lb/></p>

			<head>METHODOLOGICAL ISSUES<lb/></head>

			<p>Introduction<lb/> 13.<lb/> The methodology for facilitating internationally comparable Patient Safety Indicators set out in<lb/> this manual involves two key elements:<lb/> • Cross-walk between the key disease classifications<lb/> • Specified process of calculation<lb/> 14.<lb/> The Patient Safety Indicators dealt with in this manual are specified according to certain<lb/> diagnosis and, in some instances, procedure codes. There are currently different medical classifications in<lb/> use for coding diagnosis; the ICD-9 (International Classification of Diseases) classification which is no<lb/> longer updated by the World Health Organisation (WHO) is the precursor of the present ICD-10<lb/> classification. OECD member countries use ICD-9 (e.g. Spain, USA) as well as ICD-10 (e.g. Australia,<lb/> Canada, Germany). For that reason this manual contains both versions of the coding system.<lb/> 15.<lb/> Usually countries do not use the original version of a classification published by the WHO but<lb/> modify it according to their needs. Country modifications are still consistent with the WHO version,<lb/> keeping the structure of the classification tree. In some chapters of the ICD classification the country<lb/> versions are more extensive than the WHO version while in others they are not. This manual does not<lb/> cover all the different country versions of the ICD.<lb/> 16.<lb/> The technical specifications of diagnosis in this manual are based on the ICD-10-WHO, 2006 and<lb/> on the ICD-9-CM 3 . Therefore countries seeking to utilise this manual must ensure that before applying the<lb/> definitions the defined codes for inclusion or exclusion criteria are currently in use. Otherwise the<lb/> definitions at hand must be extended to include the subgroups added in the country modifications.<lb/> 17.<lb/> For example, <ref type="table">Table 2</ref> shows that one three-digit WHO code for decubitus ulcer corresponds to 8<lb/> four-digit codes in Canada, 5 four-digit codes in Australia and 50 five-digit German codes. To calculate the<lb/> numerator for the indicator decubitus ulcer, all country specific subgroups of the listed WHO code L89<lb/> must be taken into account.<lb/></p>

			<figure>3.<lb/> Definitions in ICD-9-CM are adopted from AHRQ (2003).<lb/></figure>

			<table>Table 2: Examples of Country Versions<lb/> ICD-10<lb/> WHO<lb/> (2006)<lb/> ICD-10-CA<lb/> (Canada, 2006)<lb/> ICD-10-AM<lb/> (Australia, 2006)<lb/> ICD-10-GM<lb/> (Germany, 2006), a 5 th<lb/> digit has to be used to<lb/> specify the location (10<lb/> subgroups)<lb/> L89<lb/> Decubitus<lb/> ulcer<lb/> L89.0<lb/> Decubitus ulcer limited to<lb/> erythema only [redness]<lb/> without skin breakdown<lb/> (Stage 1)<lb/> Decubitus [pressure]<lb/> ulcer, stage I<lb/> L89.1<lb/> Decubitus ulcer limited to<lb/> breakdown of skin (Stage 2)<lb/> Decubitus [pressure]<lb/> ulcer, stage II<lb/> Decubitus ulcer Stage 1<lb/> L89.2<lb/> Decubitus ulcer with fat layer<lb/> exposed (Stage 3)<lb/> Decubitus [pressure]<lb/> ulcer, stage III<lb/> Decubitus ulcer Stage 2<lb/> L89.3<lb/> Decubitus ulcer with depth<lb/> involving muscle (Stage 4)<lb/> Decubitus [pressure]<lb/> ulcer, stage IV<lb/> Decubitus ulcer Stage 3<lb/> L89.4<lb/> Decubitus ulcer with depth<lb/> involving bone (Stage 5)<lb/> Decubitus ulcer Stage 4<lb/> L89.5<lb/> Decubitus ulcer with joint<lb/> space involvement (Stage 5)<lb/> L89.8<lb/> Decubitus ulcer with necrosis<lb/> involving muscle or bone<lb/> (Stage X)<lb/> L89.9<lb/> Decubitus ulcer without<lb/> mention of severity<lb/> Decubitus [pressure]<lb/> ulcer, unspecified<lb/> Decubitus ulcer,<lb/> unspecified<lb/> 18.<lb/></table>

			<p>There are several criteria which are not consistent between countries that may influence the<lb/> calculated rates of the indicators. These are:<lb/></p>

				<formula>• Coding rules<lb/></formula>

			<p>− Definition of principal diagnosis<lb/> − Definition of secondary diagnosis<lb/> • Use of diagnosis type indicators (e.g. marking of secondary diagnosis as &quot; present at admission &quot; )<lb/> • Use of DRG for hospital reimbursement<lb/> • Certain administrative case information<lb/> − Admission type (elective, from long-term care, transferred from acute care)<lb/> − Admission weight of neonates.<lb/> 19.<lb/> A questionnaire was distributed with this manual to collect more information on the coding<lb/> specifications within each country participating in the initial experimental calculations of the indicators<lb/> (Annex 3). Participating countries were asked to fill out the questionnaire and return it to the OECD<lb/> Secretariat. The information on country specific coding specifications strongly facilitated the interpretation<lb/> of the results by the OECD Secretariat.<lb/></p>

			<head>Cross Walking from ICD-9 to ICD-10<lb/></head>

			<p>20.<lb/> The quantitative relationship between ICD-9 and ICD-10 is not 1:1. The ICD-10 is much more<lb/> extensive than the ICD-9 and structures in the classification trees vary between the two. In a preliminary<lb/> German project (<ref type="biblio">Drösler et al, 2007</ref>), mapping of diagnoses and procedures was performed for each<lb/> definition of the patient safety indicators (AHRQ 2004). Diagnosis mapping was performed using cross<lb/> walking tables (DIMDI, 2007) between ICD-9-WHO V6.0 and ICD-10-German Modification 2004 in two<lb/> steps, with updates of the indicator definitions appended to the translated version.<lb/> 21.<lb/> ICD-10 codes were manually revised after a preliminary crosswalk. Mapped ICD-10 codes with<lb/> an unclear relationship to the original ICD-9-WHO code were compared to the ICD-9-CM, which is the<lb/> origin of the indicator definitions. ICD-10 codes with correspondents in ICD-9-CM were rejected when the<lb/> matching ICD-9-CM code had not been specified in the definition of the indicator. Transferred ICD-10<lb/> codes were accepted when the medical concept matched the intention of the indicator definition. For<lb/> example, the ICD-10 code T88.4 &quot; Failed or difficult intubation &quot; was included to the numerator<lb/> specification of indicator &quot; Complications of Anaesthesia &quot; because it was a mapped result to the<lb/> corresponding ICD-9-CM-code E87.63 &quot; Endotracheal tube wrongly placed during anaesthetic procedure &quot; .<lb/> 22.<lb/> Due to the different country versions of the diagnosis classification, for an international project<lb/> such as the OECD Health Care Quality Indicators Project it is necessary to find a common &quot; classification<lb/> language &quot; . Thus the country specific ICD-10 translations of the indicator definitions have been<lb/> transformed to the ICD-10-WHO 2006 (<ref type="biblio">WHO, 2006</ref>) to serve as the basis for the crosswalk. The ICD-10<lb/> codes listed in this manual underwent an international harmonisation process initiated by the International<lb/> Methodology Consortium for Coded Health Information (IMECCHI) research collaboration (<ref type="biblio">Quan H et al,<lb/> 2008</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<head>Process of Calculation<lb/></head>

			<p>23.<lb/> The numerators pertain to subsets of the denominators. Calculate the denominator quantity first.<lb/> Then apply the numerator definition to the selected denominator data.<lb/></p>

			<head>Exclusions of Principal Diagnosis<lb/></head>

			<p>24.<lb/> Verify the documentation rules for the principal diagnosis (main diagnosis, discharge diagnosis)<lb/> in use for each country is required to decide how the exclusions of the principal diagnosis should be<lb/> performed.<lb/></p>

			<head>Definitions of Principal Diagnosis (PDx) 4<lb/></head>

			<p>A. The condition established after evaluation to be chiefly responsible for causing the<lb/> hospitalisation.<lb/></p>

			<head>B.</head>

			<p>The diagnosis that is finally established to be the main reason for the hospital stay; that is<lb/> demanding the most resources/medical effort over the course of the patients stay.<lb/> 25.<lb/> The original AHRQ patient safety manual is based on definition A (Department of Health and<lb/> Human <ref type="biblio">Services, 2005</ref>). For that reason most indicator definitions contain an exclusion rule if the<lb/> principal diagnosis of the case is equal to a numerator defining ICD code. For these cases it is unlikely that<lb/> the indicator-defining condition had been acquired during the hospital stay but was pre-existing.<lb/> 26.<lb/> In this manual it is assumed that countries using definition B for assignment of principal<lb/> diagnosis are able to identify the case-related admission diagnosis (ADx) in their data sets. In this case<lb/> patients with admission diagnosis corresponding to the numerator definition of the indicator should be<lb/> excluded (see left-sided flow chart &quot; PDx algorithm &quot; on p.14). Furthermore it shall be avoided that<lb/> countries using definition B for assignment of principal diagnosis miss numerator cases by assigning<lb/> specific complications as principal diagnosis. If a diagnosis type indicator is in use data can be properly<lb/> rearranged (see right-sided flow chart at <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>: PDx Algorithm).<lb/></p>

			<head>Secondary diagnosis<lb/></head>

			<p>27.<lb/> Patient safety indicators are largely constructed from secondary diagnoses. The calculation of the<lb/> numerator builds on secondary diagnosis for most of the indicators. The indicator definitions refer to<lb/> conditions aroused post admission. To make sure that all participating countries use the same definition of<lb/> secondary diagnosis it is presented here:<lb/></p>

			<head>Definition of Secondary Diagnosis (SDx) 8<lb/></head>

			<p>28.<lb/> Comorbid conditions are those conditions for which the patient received treatment and consumed<lb/> hospital resources in addition to those conditions considered to be the principal, main or discharge<lb/> diagnosis.<lb/></p>

			<head>34.<lb/> Pre-admission conditions</head>

			<p>without any necessary treatment during the hospital stay do not meet<lb/> the definition. Pre-admission comorbidities with in-hospital treatment meet the definition of the secondary<lb/> diagnosis. Countries using diagnosis type indicators have the possibility to distinguish between pre-and<lb/> post-admission comorbidities. If they perform additional exclusions of numerator cases their calculated<lb/> rates might be lower than in countries where additional criteria for secondary diagnosis documentation are<lb/> not in use.<lb/></p>

			<figure>Use of codes for external causes of morbidity and mortality ( &quot; E-codes &quot; )<lb/></figure>

			<p>35.<lb/> Several indicators (e.g. Complications of Anaesthesia) build on diagnoses codes from Chapter<lb/> XX (20) of the ICD-10 or the corresponding supplement of the ICD-9 respectively. The WHO designates<lb/> those codes for additional documentation of external causes of morbidity. The availability of these codes in<lb/> country modifications of the ICD may vary. Furthermore their use is optional in some countries.<lb/> Depending on the extent of available e-codes in country modifications indicator rates may vary between<lb/> countries.<lb/></p>

			<head>Exclusions of MDC<lb/></head>

			<p>36.<lb/> In countries using DRG for hospital reimbursement each case is assigned to a MDC (Major<lb/> Diagnostic Category) by the grouper software. The MDC assignment relies exclusively on the principal<lb/> diagnosis of the case (definition A above).The calculation of several indicators (<ref type="table">Table 3</ref>) requires the<lb/> exclusion of certain MDCs to ensure that whole populations with high risk for a condition are not counted.<lb/> For example, MDC 9 (diseases of skin, subcutaneous tissue, and breast) is excluded from the calculation of<lb/> indicator Decubitus Ulcer. Lists of ICD-10-WHO codes referring to certain MDCs are provided in the<lb/> Annex 2 -Code List M 5 for countries using ICD-10 without DRG reimbursement or if the MDC<lb/> assignment of data is impossible.<lb/></p>

			<figure>5.<lb/> Code lists and neonate identification are adapted from (InEK, 2006 and Commonwealth of Australia,<lb/> 1998).<lb/></figure>

			<p>37.<lb/> There are different methods to identify Neonates (MDC 15). If the admission weight of the<lb/> neonate and the information on age in days is available in the dataset the algorithm below should be used<lb/> for exclusion. Otherwise a code list will be provided in the Annex.<lb/></p>

			<figure>Algorithm for neonate identification (MDC 15) 10<lb/> 1 day &lt;age&lt;28 days<lb/> or<lb/> 27 days&lt;age&lt;365 days and 0 grams &lt; weight &lt; 2500 grams<lb/></figure>

			<table>Table 3: Indicators with MDC exclusion<lb/></table>

			<head>Procedure Codes<lb/></head>

			<p>38.<lb/> The calculations of eight of the indicators require procedure codes. Those indicators are<lb/> &quot; Postoperative Iatrogenic Pneumothorax &quot; , &quot; Postoperative Hip Fracture &quot; &quot; Postoperative Respiratory<lb/> Failure &quot; &quot; Postoperative Pulmonary Embolism (PE) or Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) &quot; , &quot; Obstetric Trauma<lb/> – Vaginal Delivery with / without instrument &quot; and &quot; Obstetric Trauma -Caesarean Section &quot; . There is no<lb/> common international medical procedure classification and each country participating in the experimental<lb/> calculation of the indicators uses a different catalogue for procedure coding. In the project at hand it was<lb/> not possible to provide a procedure code lists for each participating country. The procedure codes from the<lb/> US ICD-9-CM are listed in this manual because they are part of the original indicator definitions provided<lb/> by AHRQ. Furthermore, the procedure list provided in this manual shall support countries in adopting<lb/> corresponding procedures from their classifications in order to perform a precise PSI calculation.<lb/> 39.<lb/> Five indicators refer to denominator cases with operative treatment only. Those are:<lb/></p>

			<table>• Complications of Anaesthesia<lb/> • Postoperative Hip Fracture<lb/> • Postoperative Respiratory Failure<lb/> • Postoperative Pulmonary Embolism (PE) or Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT)<lb/> • Postoperative Sepsis<lb/> MDC<lb/> Condition<lb/> Indicators<lb/> MDC 4 Diseases/disorders of respiratory system<lb/> Postoperative respiratory failure<lb/> MDC 5 Diseases/disorders of circulatory system<lb/> Postoperative respiratory failure<lb/> MDC 8<lb/> Diseases and disorders of the musculoskeletal<lb/> system and connective tissue<lb/> Postoperative hip fracture<lb/> MDC 9<lb/> Diseases and disorders of the skin, subcutaneous<lb/> tissue and breast<lb/> Decubitus ulcer<lb/> MDC 14 Pregnancy, childbirth and puerperium<lb/> Postoperative PE or DVT<lb/> Postoperative sepsis<lb/> Decubitus ulcer<lb/> Postoperative hip fracture<lb/> Complications of anaesthesia<lb/> Iatrogenic pneumothorax<lb/> Postoperative respiratory failure<lb/> 40.<lb/></table>

			<p>For selection of these cases a comparison between the coded procedures and a list of all operating<lb/> room procedures available in a country&apos;s procedure classification is necessary. For the reasons explained<lb/> above it is not possible to generate lists of operating room procedures for each country. The following<lb/> interventional procedures are regarded as operative procedures: Pacemaker Implants, PTCA 6 or endoscopic<lb/> vessel repair. D&amp;C 7 is regarded as an operating room procedure where as a perineal laceration repair<lb/> during a regular vaginal delivery is not.<lb/></p>

			<head>Flow Charts<lb/></head>

			<p>41.<lb/> For each indicator a flow chart is provided to facilitate the understanding of the indicator<lb/> definition and the calculation process. For the construction of the flowcharts, definition A of the principal<lb/> diagnosis ( &quot; condition to be chiefly responsible &quot; ) had been assumed. Countries using definition B<lb/> ( &quot; condition demanding the most resources &quot; ) for assignment of principal diagnosis are advised to rearrange<lb/> their data in order to gain comparable results. A proposal for rearrangement is given in the flowchart at<lb/> <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>: PDx Algorithm.<lb/></p>

			<head>General Note<lb/></head>

			<p>42.<lb/> Data quality is always a concern in health indicator analysis that can also substantially affect<lb/> patient safety indicators. In addition to the proposed definitions, a comprehensive review of coding<lb/> practices, distribution of key data elements and country specific coding standards is strongly recommended<lb/> for data analysis of these PSIs. Given the nature of the PSIs, small sample size may lead to less precise<lb/> estimates and requires special attention when reporting these indicators. All of these factors can affect<lb/> comparability of the PSIs, and need to be addressed when making such comparisons.<lb/></p>

			<head>Remarks on Calculation of National Rates (Population Rates) and Mean Provider Rates<lb/></head>

			<p>43.<lb/> The questionnaire that was distributed with this manual to each country participating in the initial<lb/> experimental calculations of the indicators (Annex 3) requested two different presentations of a country&apos;s<lb/> results:<lb/></p>

			<p>• National rates (population rates) were requested to be reported in section VI of the<lb/> questionnaire. The national rate / population rate for each indicator is the ratio between events<lb/> (numerator) and population (denominator). The national rates (population rates) are weighted as it<lb/> is pretended that all the cases included in the calculation lie in one hospital.<lb/></p>

			<p>• Mean provider rates were requested to be reported in section VII of the questionnaire. The<lb/> calculation of a mean provider rate requires the possibility of data analysis on an institutional level.<lb/> The mean provider rate of an indicator is the sum of the individual hospital rates for this indicator<lb/> divided by the number of hospitals where this indicator was applied.<lb/></p>

			<head>Notes:<lb/></head>

			<p>• If for certain indicators, there were institutions without denominator populations (e.g. hospitals<lb/> without an obstetric department) these were to be excluded from the calculation of the mean<lb/> provider rate of that indicator.<lb/> • Indicators with rates of zero (institutions where no numerator defining event occurred within a<lb/> given denominator population) were to be included in the calculation of the mean provider rate.<lb/> • Cases treated in psychiatric institutions were to be excluded from the calculation.<lb/> 6.<lb/> Percutaneous Transluminal Coronary Angioplasty, an intervention in cardiology.<lb/> 7.<lb/> Dilation and Curettage, a gynaecological or obstetric treatment.<lb/></p>

			<head>Quick Step Overview of Essential Tasks for Data Preparation<lb/></head>

			<p>The following outlines the key steps in preparing data for the calculation of the Patient Safety Indicators:<lb/> 1. Convert listed ICD codes to your country&apos;s version of ICD<lb/> 2. Look up in your ICD classification if there are codes available for SIRS (Systemic Inflammatory<lb/></p>

			<p>Response syndrome). If these codes are available add them to the numerator inclusion list of the<lb/></p>

			<head>indicator Postoperative Sepsis<lb/></head>

			<p>3. Look up in your ICD classification if there are codes available for Iatrogenic Pneumothorax. If<lb/> these codes are available add them to the numerator inclusion list of the indicator Iatrogenic<lb/> Pneumothorax<lb/></p>

			<head>4. Look up the procedure codes</head>
