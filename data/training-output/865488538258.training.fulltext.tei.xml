			<head>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY<lb/></head>

			<p>Part I of the study investigates how regulatory objectives can be achieved in liberalised markets by<lb/> exploring experience with competition in several services sectors previously provided solely by<lb/> governments. In recent years, trade in network infrastructure services — including telecommunications,<lb/> postal/courier, energy, water and sewage — has increased, following changes in their provision leading to<lb/> stronger competition. In developing countries, in particular, liberalisation is seen as a way to increase<lb/> investment and improve infrastructure performance. Due to lack of domestic capacity and finance, when<lb/> developing country governments decide to open these services to competition, it usually includes a<lb/> decision to accept foreign participation. Technological innovation has also expanded the scope for<lb/> competition in sectors such as telecommunications and postal/courier and, to a lesser extent, energy. Even<lb/> where competition in the market may not be feasible due to features of scale and natural monopoly<lb/> associated with these services, competition for the market has been introduced through various contractual<lb/> arrangements between the public and private sectors. These have emerged as alternatives to privatisation.<lb/> While liberalisation can confer significant benefits in terms of increased efficiency, access and<lb/> affordability of services, it must be appropriately designed and supported by a strong regulatory<lb/> framework. Governments have at their disposal a variety of regulatory tools and approaches to address<lb/> market failures and meet public policy objectives in the new environment.<lb/> First, governments retain a major role in regulating tariffs in liberalised markets. The challenge is to<lb/> set rates that strike a socially acceptable balance between the interests of investors and consumers,<lb/> attracting needed capital while ensuring that prices are just and reasonable. Second, governments put in<lb/> place policies to ensure access and affordability of services to poor or unserved populations. In some cases<lb/> (e.g. telecommunications) liberalisation itself can increase access as competition lowers prices; in other<lb/> cases, specific measures are necessary, such as network expansion obligations or subsidies targeted at poor<lb/> consumers or at providers. Third, governments maintain responsibility for setting standards for the service,<lb/> either specifying outcomes (e.g. service quality and reliability) or inputs (e.g. materials and design to be<lb/> used by operators). Approaches to induce companies to meet standards range from mandatory service<lb/> obligations to market-based instruments. Standards should be sufficiently flexible to enable operators to<lb/> seek creative approaches to expand service provision, without compromising service quality.<lb/> Furthermore, strong and genuinely independent regulatory agencies and competition authorities, with<lb/> the capacity to put in place appropriate regulation and competition policy as well as ensure enforcement<lb/> are critical. The essential tasks performed by these institutions require considerable expertise in appraising<lb/> the structure and performance of markets. Development of regulatory capacity in developing countries is<lb/> likely to require substantial technical and financial assistance. Transparency in regulatory decision-making<lb/> and in activities between suppliers is also key to ensure accountability and the political acceptability of<lb/> reform. Evidence suggests that consumers are prepared to accept higher prices where service quality is<lb/> improved and the basis for the tariffs is transparent. Making information available to consumers can in turn<lb/> assist in mobilising them to play a role in monitoring the performance of service suppliers and the<lb/> enforcement of regulation.<lb/></p>

			<p>There is, of course, no universally appropriate model for reform. Every liberalisation programme must<lb/> take account of each sector&apos;s economic attributes and technological conditions, as well as the country&apos;s<lb/> economic, social, geographical, institutional and political characteristics. Against this backdrop, Part I of<lb/> the report presents concrete examples from both OECD and non-OECD countries of experiences by<lb/> governments with various regulatory instruments to ensure public policy objectives.<lb/></p>

			<head>Part II</head>

			<p>of the study complements Part I by linking the discussion of the liberalisation of network<lb/> infrastructure services at the national level with the GATS. It explores the main issues related to these<lb/> services in current GATS negotiations in terms of new possibilities for progress in light of real<lb/> liberalisation taking place in many countries and of important considerations specific to these services.<lb/> Enhanced GATS commitments in network infrastructure services can create momentum for further<lb/> domestic reform, and can anchor these reforms within an international legal framework. GATS<lb/> commitments can also provide a credible signal that the government is committed to sector reform and has<lb/> taken the necessary legal and regulatory measures to allow for investment, including FDI. WTO<lb/> commitments can thus contribute to improve the investment climate, helping to attract needed capital as<lb/> well as technical and managerial expertise. Preparedness to make GATS commitments can additionally<lb/> enhance leverage for commitments from trading partners both in services and in other areas of the WTO<lb/> agenda.<lb/> Notwithstanding these benefits, with the exception of telecommunication services, progress on<lb/> committing network infrastructure services under the GATS has been limited. This partly reflects the fact<lb/> that these services were mostly provided by public monopoly operators at the time of the Uruguay Round.<lb/> Nevertheless, significant reforms to introduce competition have since been undertaken which have changed<lb/> the market characteristics of these services in many countries. So there seems to be scope now to achieve<lb/> more progress at the multilateral level and the Doha Round offers WTO Members an opportunity for<lb/> anchoring recent policy reforms, giving them more permanency in a flexible and progressive manner. Yet<lb/> so far only relatively few Members have tabled new or improved offers in these services and developing<lb/> countries&apos; participation remains limited.<lb/> Part of the reason explaining this lack of progress relates to the main classification instruments used<lb/> by WTO Members in making commitments in network infrastructure services. Clarifying and modernising<lb/> the current GATS classifications is viewed by some countries as key to improve commitments in these<lb/> services. Several proposals have thus been submitted by a number of WTO Members suggesting<lb/> alternative or more specific definitions, some of which have already been adopted in the requests and<lb/> offers of a few Members. While in light of divergent views it may be difficult in the short-term to agree on<lb/> new classification instruments, WTO Members are not required to use any particular classification and the<lb/> Members concerned are free to modify the classifications contained in their schedules of commitments (as<lb/> long as consistency with previous commitments is maintained). By the same token, those Members that<lb/> consider that the current GATS classifications remain a valid framework to schedule commitments in the<lb/> relevant sectors can simply maintain them in their schedules. WTO Members have also been discussing<lb/> ways to ensure that any commitments in these services are not undermined by lack of commitments in<lb/> other (related) sectors.<lb/> Perhaps more importantly, concerns have been raised about the potential effect of the GATS on the<lb/> ability of governments to ensure adequate provision of network infrastructure services to the public. In<lb/> practice, this refers to the possible impact of the Agreement on governments&apos; ability to maintain their<lb/> traditional public service responsibilities either through monopoly public utilities, exclusive rights to<lb/> provide services or appropriately regulated competition. In light of the importance of these services for<lb/> society and their highly regulated nature, governments have been cautious about agreeing to subject these<lb/> sectors to binding commitments on competitive supply. The GATS, like other legally bound undertakings<lb/> in the WTO (or other international treaties), can affect the regulatory conduct of governments. At the same<lb/> time, the Agreement affords WTO Members considerable flexibility in this regard.<lb/></p>

			<p>In the absence of scheduled commitments, the GATS imposes only limited obligations, which do not<lb/> limit governments&apos; ability to retain control over network infrastructure services. When a country makes a<lb/> commitment, other more significant obligations kick-in, especially concerning market access and national<lb/> treatment. These may have more significant implications on autonomous policy making in these services,<lb/> intensified by the fact that the GATS is a relatively young agreement and some of its provisions remain to<lb/> be tested in practice. Scheduling commitments on network infrastructure services thus raises questions in<lb/> relation to their nature. At the same time, the flexibility imbedded in the Agreement allows countries to<lb/> schedule limitations to avoid these concerns and facilitate the assumption of commitments in these<lb/> services. This is reflected in the Uruguay Round schedules of some WTO Members and explored in Part II<lb/> of the study.<lb/> Once commitments in a particular sector have been made, additional disciplines on regulatory<lb/> measures apply, in particular those contained in Article VI. A closer look at these provisions reveals that<lb/> they do not seem to impinge on governments&apos; ability to regulate network infrastructure services. In<lb/> addition, current discussions under the Article VI:4 mandate indicate that any new disciplines in this area<lb/> will be broad enough to allow regulation for the protection of a wide range of public policy objectives.<lb/> This is confirmed by the Accountancy Disciplines, the one area where negotiations have been concluded<lb/> under the mandate. Another important example of GATS disciplines and the scope for autonomous policy<lb/> making in network infrastructure services is the Reference Paper on Basic Telecommunications. The<lb/> Reference Paper, which attains legal status only to the extent that WTO Members have incorporated it in<lb/> their commitments, consists of a set of pro-competitive regulatory principles for basic telecommunication<lb/> services akin to international best practice. The Reference Paper, in line with the Preamble of the GATS,<lb/> recognises governments&apos; right to regulate the sector to ensure public policy objectives. A case in point is<lb/> universal service requirements; the Reference Paper explicitly confirms the right of Members to establish<lb/> such measures.<lb/></p>

			<head>PART I: REGULATING FOR PUBLIC POLICY OBJECTIVES<lb/> I.<lb/> Introduction<lb/></head>

			<p>1.<lb/> This part of the study investigates how regulatory objectives can be achieved in liberalised<lb/> markets by exploring experience with competition in several services sectors previously provided solely by<lb/> governments. The aim is not to advocate particular solutions, but to provide policy makers with<lb/> information to feed into, and adapt to the specificities of, their own economic and political situations, if<lb/> and when they decide to liberalise.<lb/> 2.<lb/> The study presents concrete examples from both OECD and non-OECD countries of how<lb/> governments have used various regulatory instruments to achieve public policy objectives. The focus is on<lb/> telecommunication, postal/courier, energy and environmental infrastructure services given their network<lb/> characteristics.<lb/></p>

			<p>3.<lb/> The report also includes examples where experience was not positive, with the aim of providing<lb/> some guidance on the pitfalls to be avoided if the benefits of liberalisation are to be realised and sustained.<lb/> A number of cases provide examples of both negative and positive experiences, with initial, less successful<lb/> reforms being adjusted in light of experience and new regulatory solutions adopted. These cases underline<lb/> both the extent of experimentation undertaken in service sector reform in recent years and the need for<lb/> regulatory approaches to be adapted to local circumstances.<lb/> 4.<lb/> Examples of regulation of domestic private participants, i.e. where there is no trade, are included<lb/> where there is no apparent reason that the same regulatory measure could not be applied to a foreign<lb/> entrant. Examples of regulatory mechanisms involving publicly-owned companies are incorporated as well<lb/> when they are relevant for any type of operator (public or private). Reforms have at times been progressive<lb/> with the former public monopoly still being the main (or only) service provider, while the new regulatory<lb/> framework is designed. In these cases, the reforms have already been tailored to prepare for the<lb/> introduction of competition.<lb/> 5.<lb/> The next section of this part of the study reviews opportunities and challenges of introducing<lb/> competition in network infrastructure services. Section III then identifies a number of key regulatory<lb/> objectives that governments seek to achieve in liberalised markets to address market failures and meet<lb/> public policy objectives, and describes some of the regulatory approaches that can be used to achieve these<lb/> objectives. The last section presents the country examples in the chosen sectors.<lb/></p>

			<head>II.<lb/> Opening to competition<lb/></head>

			<p>6.<lb/> Historically, trade in network infrastructure services — including telecommunications,<lb/> postal/courier, energy, water and sewage — has been limited because they were mainly provided by<lb/> governments. Government provision was seen as necessary to ensure equitable access to these services and<lb/> because of their natural monopoly characteristics. The scope for competition in several network<lb/> infrastructure services has traditionally been limited given that the existing infrastructure — e.g.<lb/> transmission media in telecommunications, electricity grid and water and sewage pipes — is often<lb/> prohibitively expensive to duplicate.<lb/> 7.<lb/> Nevertheless, in recent years trade in network infrastructure services has increased, following<lb/> changes in the provision of these services leading to stronger presence of the private sector. In emerging<lb/> economies and developing countries, in particular, the underlying driver of decisions to liberalise is to<lb/> attract resources for the financing of investment and to improve infrastructure performance. Liberalisation<lb/> of these services is seen as a way to increase investment and service coverage, foster competition where<lb/> feasible and import technology and know-how. Due to lack of domestic capacity and finance, when<lb/> developing country governments decide to liberalise, it usually includes a decision to accept foreign<lb/> participation.<lb/> 8.<lb/> Competition in network utilities has also been facilitated by technological innovation. Changes in<lb/> production and technological advances have had especially dramatic effects on the market structure of the<lb/> telecommunication, energy and increasingly postal industries. In telecommunications, technological<lb/> change has almost eliminated natural monopoly in interexchange markets (e.g. long-distance services). The<lb/> rapid growth of cellular telephones, which increasingly substitute for wireline services, has played a big<lb/> role in reducing the importance of scale and natural monopoly associated with conventional local loops<lb/> (<ref type="biblio">World Bank, 2004</ref>). Internet-based services are undergoing similar dramatic growth.<lb/> 9.<lb/> In recent years, what once was a relatively clear cut divide between the monopoly provision of<lb/> postal services and competitive provision of courier services has become increasingly blurred. In a few<lb/> cases, this has occurred through market reforms which have formally reduced or terminated the scope of<lb/> monopoly rights, but for most countries this has been through the expansion of private sector operators into<lb/> areas once the exclusive preserve of the public service postal providers. Equally, many postal<lb/> administrations have moved beyond the confines of providing traditional postal services in reserved sectors<lb/> into new areas in competition with the private sector. This process of increased competition has accelerated<lb/> with new technological developments in postal services, with the range of possibilities opened up<lb/> considerably through electronic mail and the Internet.<lb/> 10.<lb/> In the electricity industry reforms involved unbundling of its four main components —<lb/> generation, transmission, distribution and retail — which led to different forms of competition (see Box 1).<lb/> New technologies have also facilitated the introduction of competition in generation (although there is<lb/> debate on whether the production of energy constitutes a service or a good). Low-cost, small-scale<lb/> generation units allow electric power to be produced closer to end users, reducing reliance on transmission<lb/> and distribution networks, which constitute services, and contributing to undermine their natural monopoly<lb/> characteristics.<lb/></p>

			<head>Box 1. Options for restructuring electricity markets<lb/></head>

			<p>Electricity markets can be structured in four ways, reflecting varying competition and customer choice:<lb/></p>

			<p>• Monopoly — the traditional status quo, where a single entity generates all electricity and delivers it over a<lb/> transmission network to distribution companies or costumers.<lb/></p>

			<p>• Single buyer — where a single agency buys electricity from competing generators, has a monopoly on<lb/> transmission, and sells electricity to distributors and large power users without competition from other suppliers.<lb/></p>

			<p>• Wholesale competition — where multiple distributors buy electricity from competing generators, use the<lb/> transmission network to deliver it to their service areas under open access arrangements, and maintain monopolies<lb/> on sales in their service areas.<lb/></p>

			<p>• Retail competition — where customers have access to competing generators, directly or through a retailer of their<lb/> choice, and transmission and distribution networks operate under open access arrangements. However, retail<lb/> competition may not involve all customers but may be limited to industrial customers.<lb/></p>

			<head>11.<lb/></head>

			<p>But even when competition in the market may not be feasible — e.g. local networks of water<lb/> pipes and sewers — it is possible to introduce competition for the market through monopoly franchises.<lb/> Many countries have used innovative strategies to facilitate private participation in these services.<lb/> Contractual arrangements between the private and public sectors, such as concessions, management<lb/> contracts or build operate transfer contracts have emerged as alternatives to privatisation — where<lb/> ownership is transferred through outright divesture. 1 A concession contract, for example, grants a private<lb/> company, typically through competitive bidding, the exclusive right to provide a service for a specified<lb/> period by using existing facilities and developing new ones. Thus, a concession agreement entails only a<lb/> temporary transfer of the infrastructure assets (such as water pipes) to the private sector. At the end of the<lb/> concession period the assets are transferred back to the public authority (<ref type="biblio">World Bank, 2004</ref>).<lb/> 12.<lb/> These changes are having the effect of gradually bringing network infrastructure services into the<lb/> realm of the market and exposing them to international trade. However, although the benefits of<lb/> liberalisation can be very important both in terms of increased efficiency and of service access and<lb/> affordability, past experience has shown that reforms must be appropriately designed and supported by a<lb/> strong regulatory framework.<lb/> 13.<lb/> If a government decides to introduce competition in services previously provided solely by the<lb/> public sector, it needs to shift from being the manager of these services to being their regulator. In light of<lb/> the characteristics of these services, to achieve public policy objectives in the new environment, new<lb/> regulatory tools and approaches are required, including with respect to pricing, universal access (both in<lb/> terms of availability and affordability) and service standards.<lb/> 14.<lb/> Another important dimension is the establishment of strong and genuinely independent<lb/> regulatory agencies and competition authorities, with the capacity to put in place appropriate regulation<lb/> and ensure enforcement. When these exist, private participation can lead to improvements in attaining<lb/> public policy objectives, because, for instance, government agencies may be reluctant to monitor and fine<lb/> (other) government providers — a classic conflict of interests. Transparency about government choices<lb/> (and reasons underlying them) and in activities between suppliers is also key, as is the introduction of<lb/> instruments to enhance consumers&apos; involvement in monitoring and evaluating the improvement of services<lb/> and the achievement of public policy objectives.<lb/> 15.<lb/> Experience has shown that there is no universally appropriate model for reform. Every<lb/> liberalisation programme must take account of each sector&apos;s features, including its economic attributes and<lb/> technological conditions, as well as the country&apos;s economic, social, geographical, institutional and political<lb/> characteristics (<ref type="biblio">World Bank, 2004</ref>). Furthermore, the elaboration of adequate regulatory instruments and<lb/> the establishment of institutions can be costly and may require sophisticated skills, and thus present<lb/> challenges that are likely to be most acute in emerging economies and developing countries. Provision of<lb/> technical assistance and capacity building to support liberalisation are thus particularly important for these<lb/> countries.<lb/></p>

			<head>III.<lb/> Regulatory goals and approaches<lb/> Regulating tariffs<lb/></head>

			<p>16.<lb/> Unlike for telecommunication services where trade liberalisation, coupled with technological<lb/> advances, has led to significant price decreases, private-sector involvement in water, sewage, electricity<lb/> and postal services can lead to increases in existing fees for service supplied by the government. This is<lb/> because often the price fixed under government monopoly does not even cover the cost of providing the<lb/> service. User-fees are one of the most controversial aspects of liberalisation, especially in environmental<lb/> network services and electricity. Network infrastructure services are capital-intensive services and<lb/> wherever that capital investment comes from, somebody has to pay for it: if not users then taxpayers or aid<lb/> donors. Providing water and sewage services &quot; free &quot; to end users, for example, ignores the huge costs of<lb/> collecting, storing and distributing water, as well as treating waste water. Cost-reflective tariffs are needed<lb/> to bring about the investment necessary to maintain, replace, modernise and expand the facilities and<lb/> services. User fees for water, and for water-waste management, are also crucial to the promotion of<lb/> conservation principles in user households and commercial enterprises (OECD, 2001).<lb/> 17.<lb/> A decision to liberalise these services does not of course mean the end of regulation in this<lb/> fundamental regulatory sphere — governments retain a key role in regulating tariffs. The key challenge<lb/> relates to setting rates that strike a socially acceptable balance between the interests of investors and<lb/> consumers, attracting needed capital and ensuring that tariffs are just and reasonable, and contribute to<lb/> universal service objectives. These goals are difficult to achieve simultaneously. Practical regulation may<lb/> entail trade-offs among them and lead to different incentives for economic actors. The optimal choice of<lb/> regulatory mechanisms depends on several factors related to the stage of national development, including<lb/> the sector&apos;s investment requirements, the availability of technical expertise and the quality of accounting<lb/> and auditing systems (see Box 2).<lb/></p>

			<head>Box 2. Mechanisms for regulating tariffs<lb/></head>

			<p>Two alternative mechanisms for tariff regulation are cost-plus and price caps.<lb/> 2 Under cost-plus regulation, the operator<lb/> submits a bill for its operating expenses and capital costs (depreciation plus an after-tax return on its investment that<lb/> equals or exceeds its cost of capital) and the regulator passes on these costs in the prices charged to consumers. One<lb/> of the attractions of cost-plus regulation is that it is likely to attract investment to a regulated sector because investors<lb/> know they will recover their operating and investment costs. However, cost-plus systems may create incentives to<lb/> engage in accounting contrivances and to inflate costs to convince the regulator to approve higher prices. Equally,<lb/> these systems may distort firms&apos; incentives to minimise costs because firms are not rewarded for reducing them.<lb/> Under price caps the regulator defines a set of prices that the operator will be allowed to charge. The utility is free to<lb/> price at or below these ceilings, and thus has a strong incentive to pursue cost-reducing innovation, use the lowest-<lb/>cost technology and operate with no waste. At the same time, consumers are protected because prices do not vary<lb/> with the firm&apos;s reported costs. However, a disadvantage of price caps is the risk of under capitalisation that may lead to<lb/> quality concerns. In addition, it is hard to assess future developments in the utility&apos;s productivity and there is therefore a<lb/> risk of excessive profits or losses. It is thus standard for a price cap mechanism to be reviewed, which may lead to<lb/> price adjustments if the rate of return falls outside a given range.<lb/></p>

			<p>In practice, most schemes have tended to be hybrid schemes, with the aim of sharing benefits and burdens between<lb/> the utility and its customers. For example, under some profit sharing mechanisms the firm is allowed to keep all profits<lb/> as long as the rate of return (revenue) falls within a specified range, thereby retaining incentives to achieve cost<lb/> efficiency. But if the rate of return falls outside this range, consumers receive a portion of the gains (or loss).<lb/></p>

			<figure>Source: World Bank, 2004; and Reineke and Schmitz, 2000.<lb/></figure>

			<p>18.<lb/> It is important to note that often poor consumers are simply left out of network services,<lb/> including in the case of services being provided by a government monopoly. This typically results in the<lb/> poor paying much more for these services than the better off. In the water supply sector, for example, the<lb/> cost per litre of drinking water in Nairobi is 10 times more for customers of vendors than it is for those<lb/> who are connected to a network. The ratios are similar in Latin America or even higher in the Caribbean<lb/> region. Paradoxically, this gives some ground for optimism. The regrettable fact that the urban poor are<lb/> used to pay very high unit prices suggests that there are resources available in the current expenditure of<lb/> poor consumers that could be channelled more efficiently (Simpson, forthcoming).<lb/></p>

			<head>Regulating to achieve universal access<lb/></head>

			<p>19.<lb/> In addition to introducing cost-reflective tariffs necessary to attract needed investment,<lb/> governments should put in place policies that help to meet the needs of those parts of the population, often<lb/> in poor periurban or geographically remote areas, who cannot afford to pay for network infrastructure<lb/> services. Allowing entry — particularly in sectors or segments where product competition is feasible, e.g.<lb/> telecommunication services — can itself increase services for the poor or unserved populations, as<lb/> competition introduces a range of price and quality options making service possible in outlying regions and<lb/> to populations at lower income levels. The introduction of competition in mobile telephones has<lb/> significantly reduced the universal access problem for the urban poor in many developing countries and<lb/> has also had a considerable impact on low-income users in rural areas (ITU, 2003). Similarly, the<lb/> expansion of private sector operators into areas previously reserved to the public postal monopoly has<lb/> considerably improved mail and parcel delivery in several countries.<lb/> 20.<lb/> In general, though, private companies must invest responsibly and therefore cannot alone be<lb/> expected to meet the needs of the poor or unserved population. Private actors, if free to choose, would<lb/> naturally seek profitable networks and most likely invest in utilities serving the cities and large urban areas.<lb/> However, meeting unmet needs should be a priority for governments — indeed, attracting the needed<lb/> resources is often the key motivation for introducing competition in the first place — so tools for inducing<lb/> the private sector to invest in coverage in low-income areas should be an integral part of any reform<lb/> programme. A common measure to extend access to service is to include network expansion obligations in<lb/> contracts with private providers (<ref type="biblio">Gleick et al., 2002</ref>). As for pricing, the incentives for investors and<lb/> consumers have to be right, and contracts need to encourage flexible and innovative approaches to meet<lb/> service targets.<lb/> 21.<lb/> Governments also have used various forms of subsidies and other support to protect poorer or<lb/> unserved groups within society. With the introduction of competition, direct (non-tariff) subsidies to poor<lb/> consumers have often replaced cross-subsidies. 3 Rather than providing blanket subsidies to hold tariffs<lb/> down, a policy that generally benefits the middle classes who are connected to the network, governments<lb/> have established mechanisms to direct the subsidies to poor neighbourhoods and unserved populations.<lb/> Other mechanisms have been used to promote sustainable use of natural resources while fostering service<lb/> access by the poor. In the water sector, these schemes consist in providing a basic minimum quantity of<lb/> water free or at low cost, but imposing higher charges for greater consumption. A key challenge, however,<lb/> is to target poor people accurately. Thus, these mechanisms require strong administrative capacity.<lb/> 22.<lb/> Direct subsidies can additionally be targeted at operators in order to create incentives to extend<lb/> access into otherwise unprofitable areas. In telecommunication services, for example, so-called<lb/> universality funds have been established to collect revenues from various sources, including government<lb/> budgets, charges on international connecting services or levies on all telecommunication service operators.<lb/> Universality funds are generally used to finance specific and targeted high cost areas or low income<lb/> subscribers. They provide subsidies to create incentives for private sector telecommunication operators to<lb/> serve areas that otherwise would be unprofitable (<ref type="biblio">Intven and Tétrault, 2000</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<head>Regulating to meet service standards<lb/></head>

			<p>23.<lb/> Government responsibility extends beyond ensuring availability of service at an affordable price.<lb/> Service standards in network infrastructure services have emerged as a major regulatory issue, not least<lb/> because many functions of modern society critically depend on these services. Standards may specify<lb/> outcomes, including with respect to service quality, service reliability and continuity, environmental effects<lb/> and customer relations. In the water supply sector, quality standards are crucial to address long-term<lb/> (chronic) health problems associated with high levels of pollutants. In the postal/courier sector, service<lb/> quality in terms of on-time delivery of letters and parcels and reliability (ensuring that letters are indeed<lb/> delivered) are very important. In electricity (as in water and telecommunications), continuity of service<lb/> (avoiding blackouts and brownouts) is a main issue. The need to address environmental effects caused by<lb/> market externalities, e.g. controlling energy and water resources, is also critical. Customer relations, e.g.<lb/> flexibility in payment methods, is an important aspect for all network infrastructure services, and can<lb/> contribute to meeting universal access objectives. Standards may also specify inputs, including with<lb/> respect to materials and design to be used by operators, and procedures (e.g. documents required from the<lb/> operator and users for service connection applications) (<ref type="biblio">Komives, 1999</ref>).<lb/> 24.<lb/> Private operators may have few economic incentives to ensure appropriate service standards.<lb/> Therefore, service standards need to be incorporated in the regulation of the utilities. There exist a number<lb/> of approaches to induce companies to meet standards, ranging from mandatory service obligations to<lb/> market-based instruments. Under mandatory service obligations, the regulator sets standards that the<lb/> operators must meet or otherwise face fines or even the cancellation of the contract. These schemes entail<lb/> broader social benefits by ensuring that consumers are protected through guaranteed standards of<lb/> performance.<lb/> 25.<lb/> Market-based instruments, on the other hand, aim at providing incentives to companies to meet<lb/> targets through improvements in efficiency. One case in point is the so called quality-incorporated<lb/> benchmarking. For example, under price cap regulation, a company that delivers increased quality relative<lb/> to its peers would be allowed to raise its price, while a corresponding price reduction would be imposed on<lb/> under-performing companies. Moreover, these schemes aim to introduce the dynamic benefits of<lb/> competition to quality provision. By using benchmarking, regulated firms effectively compete against each<lb/> other to deliver at an optimal mix of cost and service quality. Thus, in addition to static gains maximisation<lb/> (through improving the quality of service above a certain threshold), firms face an incentive to pursue<lb/> long-term investments that reduce the cost of quality provision (<ref type="biblio">Giannakis, Jamasb, and Pollitt, 2003</ref>).<lb/> 26.<lb/> Particularly in developing countries where large shares of the population do not have access to<lb/> services, countries are introducing flexible regulation that provides the strongest incentives for the operator<lb/> to seek creative approaches to meet service standards, while ensuring that important public policy<lb/> objectives, e.g. water quality, are not compromised (<ref type="biblio">World Bank, 2004</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<head>Effective regulatory agencies and competition authorities<lb/></head>

			<p>27.<lb/> The establishment of appropriate regulatory agencies and competition authorities designed to<lb/> signal government&apos;s commitment to potential private investors and protect consumers from exploitation<lb/> are essential to the reform process. In a natural monopoly situation, as is generally the case for water and<lb/> sewage, private participation does not for the most part lead to a competitive market, but to the<lb/> replacement of a public monopoly with a private one. Regulatory agencies and competition authorities thus<lb/> need to ensure that the interests of consumers are defended against potential abuses from a private<lb/> enterprise operating in a non-competitive environment. The crucial tasks performed by these institutions —<lb/> e.g. setting tariffs and quality standards, as well as ensuring enforcement — require considerable expertise<lb/> in appraising the structure and performance of markets.<lb/> 28.<lb/> Another key issue relates to ensuring access to bottleneck facilities, e.g. the local loop in<lb/> telecommunication services and the transmission grid in electricity. These facilities are essential in<lb/> delivering final products and are often too costly to duplicate. Regulatory agencies and competition<lb/> authorities have the difficult task of designing appropriate access rules, without which entry in these<lb/> industries will not materialise. Access prices for interconnection need to be high enough to compensate for<lb/> the use of the network, yet not so high as to preclude efficient operations by entrants. The goal of access<lb/> policy should be that competition in final service markets is efficient and does not favour owners of<lb/> bottleneck facilities or their rivals (World Bank, 2004).<lb/> 29.<lb/> Furthermore, particularly in sectors that feature competitive segments, such as<lb/> telecommunication, energy and postal/courier services, regulatory agencies and competition authorities<lb/> need to develop the capacity to identify abuses of market power and provide remedies that help to retain<lb/> competition as the main governor of industry performance. This includes prohibiting anti-competitive<lb/> behaviour, such as price fixing or tactics that hinder third-party access to essential facilities, as well as<lb/> blocking or conditioning mergers and acquisitions deemed damaging to competition.<lb/> 30.<lb/> Performing all these tasks effectively also requires that regulatory agencies and competition<lb/> authorities be largely independent from political influence. At the same time, it is important to ensure that<lb/> regulators do not become corrupt or inefficient. Citizens and firms should be able to find out who makes<lb/> regulatory decisions and what guides them, and to voice their concerns. In addition, affected parties should<lb/> be able to obtain redress if a regulator acts arbitrarily or incompetently (<ref type="biblio">World Bank, 2004</ref>).<lb/> 31.<lb/> Many transition economies and developing countries still lack adequate regulatory agencies and<lb/> competition authorities, which can be costly and require sophisticated skills. Some have yet to implement<lb/> the basic elements of competition law, let alone complex issues such as fair access rules. Development of<lb/> regulatory capacity in these countries thus requires substantial technical and financial assistance.<lb/></p>

			<head>Transparency and users&apos; involvement<lb/></head>

			<p>32.<lb/> There is evidence that even people with low incomes are willing to pay for network infrastructure<lb/> services when the services are reliable and the cost of delivering them is reasonably transparent and<lb/> understandable. Experience also suggests that people and businesses will pay more when they receive new<lb/> or improved services. In the context of reform, this suggests that dissemination of detailed information<lb/> about the improvement in services, and the capital investment needed to create these improvements, is<lb/> essential for public acceptance of increases in overall prices. The new or improved services need to be<lb/> clearly described and rate changes need to be phased in, together with strong education and information<lb/> programmes describing the changes and their reasons. Phasing in price increases allows people and<lb/> businesses to adjust to price changes if the schedule of change is communicated in advance and people<lb/> believe that it will actually be implemented (<ref type="biblio">Gleick et al., 2002</ref>).<lb/> 33.<lb/> Making information available to consumers can in turn assist in mobilising them to play a role in<lb/> monitoring the performance of service suppliers and the enforcement of regulation. A number of<lb/> instruments have been introduced to enhance consumers&apos; participation in regulation. So-called citizen<lb/> report cards have been used to survey the opinion of consumers in relation to service provision and their<lb/> interaction with the relevant public agencies. Citizens can provide useful feedback on the quality,<lb/> efficiency and adequacy of services and the problems they face in their interaction with service providers<lb/> (<ref type="biblio">Paul, 2004</ref>). Other measures include community-based monitoring and evaluation, designed either by the<lb/> community groups themselves or by government agencies.<lb/> 34.<lb/> Ensuring availability of information is also key with respect to activities between suppliers. In the<lb/> telecommunications sector, for example, transparency is important in relation to public licensing criteria,<lb/> universal service obligations, the allocation of scarce resources, interconnection rates, reference<lb/> interconnection offers and interconnection agreements.<lb/></p>

			<head>IV.<lb/> Examples of regulatory approaches and outcomes in liberalised markets<lb/> Regulating tariffs<lb/> Pricing of electricity distribution in the UK<lb/></head>

			<p>35.<lb/> The UK electricity sector has more than a decade of experience with incentive-based mechanisms<lb/> governing its electricity utilities. In 1990, the former publicly-owned monopoly on electricity distribution<lb/> was divided in 12 Regional Electric Companies (REC). The RECs held a local monopoly on distribution<lb/> and were allowed to generate up to 15% of their power (and purchase the rest from generating companies).<lb/> The RECs also collectively owned the National Grid, a company in charge of transmission. An Office of<lb/> Electricity Regulation (OFFER) was in parallel established and one of its missions was to implement a<lb/> price cap regulation based on the RPI-X formula. 4<lb/> 36.<lb/> The main cost categories used by the regulator to set the price cap are the operating expenditures<lb/> (Opex), which cover the costs of network operation, and the capital expenditures (Capex), which refer to<lb/> spending on long-term assets (e.g. lines and transformers). The incentive-based mechanism determines<lb/> efficiency levels of Opex by benchmarking the utilities&apos; operating costs (deducing some non-controllable<lb/> costs such as transmission system charges and asset depreciation) with respect to a combination of factors<lb/> comprising customer numbers, units of energy delivered and network length. Capex is regulated by using<lb/> forecasts of expenditure for quality improvement for customers and other factors. Inefficient firms are<lb/> required to reduce costs to meet set targets. These mechanisms contributed to a fall of operating costs in<lb/> real terms by nearly 30% between 1990 and 2002, encouraged new investment in the network, and<lb/> increased network reliability.<lb/> 37.<lb/> Nevertheless, for the first three years, tariffs for distribution operations were loosely capped in<lb/> order to let companies generate capital to improve their facilities. The result was high profits for the RECs,<lb/> which at the beginning achieved the fund raising objective for the improvement of the network. However,<lb/> at a subsequent stage these profits, and the resulting high prices for consumers, became increasingly<lb/> controversial, particularly in light of decreasing costs for operators. To address these concerns, OFFER<lb/> required significant price reductions averaging at 14% for 1995/96 and 12% for 1996/97, and readjusted<lb/> the price cap for the following years. Recent research also points to the rising concentration of the industry,<lb/> which may raise competition policy concerns.<lb/> Source: Giannakis, <ref type="biblio">Jamasb and Pollitt, 2003; Kwoka, 1997; and Thomas, 2004.<lb/></ref> Selected aspects of the California electricity crisis<lb/></head>

			<p>38.<lb/> In June 2000, California&apos;s electricity prices experienced an unprecedented level of volatility and<lb/> price increases, driven by the threat of supply shortages and a series of &quot; rolling black-outs &quot; that affected<lb/> millions of users. The situation led to bankruptcy of one distribution utility as well as considerable political<lb/> turmoil. Among the reasons commonly associated with the California electricity crisis, the particular<lb/> process of restructuring the California electricity sector has been identified as being a key factor. This<lb/> crisis underlines the need for the objectives and constraints of any reform effort to be clearly identified.<lb/> 39.<lb/> For instance, any transition from a vertically integrated utility to an unbundled structure<lb/> introduces price risks between generators and distributors that previously did not exist. High wholesale<lb/> prices for generators gives profits that are matched by losses of distributors who have to buy at these high<lb/> prices and sell at predetermined retail prices. The transition to an unbundled industry therefore needs<lb/> contracts and hedging instruments to insure against possible unexpected events that can have dramatic<lb/> effects on wholesale prices. In California, when approximately 20,000 MW of generation capacity were<lb/> sold to five new entrants, commitments were not required from the generators to sell a large fraction of the<lb/> expected annual output as a long-term contract to the three main utility distributors.<lb/> 40.<lb/> Further, tight demand with low spare capacity (and inelastic supply) may lead to volatile markets<lb/> and high prices even if there is competition among generators. As demand tightens relative to supply in the<lb/> face of inelastic and unresponsive demand 5 , large price rises have little effect on demand. At the same<lb/> time, each generator has increasing market power. The relatively large price increase caused by any single<lb/> company withdrawing a small amount of capacity is more than sufficient to compensate for the loss of<lb/> profit on that volume of sales, making such withdrawals highly profitable.<lb/> 41.<lb/> The case also shows the importance of establishing strong regulatory agencies with broad powers<lb/> to intervene, and which are not fragmented among jurisdictions. The responsibilities of these agencies<lb/> would include resource planning, oversight of competitive generation markets, distribution and<lb/> transmission prices, network access and service standards.<lb/></p>

			<head>Difficulties to establish sound regulation to electricity tariff-setting in Zimbabwe<lb/></head>

			<p>42.<lb/> In 1991, the Government of Zimbabwe introduced a reform programme of the electricity sector.<lb/> This included a performance improvement programme (PIP) for the national state utility responsible for<lb/> the bulk of electricity generation, transmission and distribution — the Zimbabwe Electricity Supply<lb/> Authority (ZESA). It also initiated a legal and regulatory reform framework for the electricity sector in<lb/> general. The Government and the Board of ZESA initiated the PIP with the appointment of a new Chief<lb/> Executive in December 1992, placing the latter and all senior managers on a performance contract.<lb/> Concurrently, Electricité de France (EDF) was engaged to work with the new management team to develop<lb/> a programme to improve the performance of the organisation in the key areas of technical operations,<lb/> customer service, financial performance and human resources management. Subsequently, several<lb/> programmes were developed between 1993 and 2000 which set performance targets, including with respect<lb/> to profitability to enhance investment, quality standards and customer satisfaction.<lb/> 43.<lb/> Profitability objectives were crucial to bring about much need investment and extend electricity<lb/> access to rural areas. One of the key strategies to improve revenues was to seek Government approval for<lb/> cost-reflective tariffs. However, a lack of policy commitment and often change of Ministers for Energy —<lb/> e.g. between early 2000 and 2002 there were three Ministers for Energy — resulted in a failure to<lb/> implement the legal and regulatory framework to underpin the reform. Indeed, the reluctance of the<lb/> Government to establish sound regulation to progressively raise tariffs to cost-recovery levels meant that<lb/> cash flow and profitability remained below targets. Tariffs were only adjusted in response to an actual<lb/> financial crisis, which was reflected in the constant liquidity problems, which ZESA faced over the years.<lb/> Financial deficits were funded through short-term borrowings. When tariff increases were granted,<lb/> profitability recovered almost overnight but for the cash flows it took several months to recover because of<lb/> the heavy short-term debts. With this ad hoc tariff setting approach, getting approvals for tariffs that reflect<lb/> prospective investment costs proved impossible. ZESA, therefore, failed to expand generation, negatively<lb/> impacting the rural electrification expansion programme.<lb/> <ref type="biblio">Source: Mangwengwende, 2002.<lb/></ref> Tariff policy in the Chilean water and sewage sectors<lb/></head>

			<p>44.<lb/> Chile introduced a new tariff formula in its water and sewage sectors gradually from 1990 to<lb/> 1995, when it reformed its publicly-owned Santiago Metropolitan Sanitary Works Enterprise (Empresa<lb/> Metropolitana de Obras Sanitarias, or EMOS) by means of a regulatory framework mimicking the design<lb/> of a concession with a private utility. EMOS was still a state-owned company but started to operate under<lb/> private law (privatisation ultimately occurred in 1999) and under the supervision of an independent<lb/> regulatory agency.<lb/> 45.<lb/> The tariff policy was designed both to signal to potential private investors that the government<lb/> was committed to not expropriating their return-on-capital through under-pricing and to curtail the chance<lb/> of monopoly rents. Tariffs are calculated every five years to cover the long run marginal cost 6 of a &quot; model &quot;<lb/> or benchmark company, and then readjusted to permit a &quot; reasonable &quot; return on assets (allowing at least a<lb/> seven percent return on capital). The water tariff is also indexed to a price index. To reduce the risk of<lb/> monopoly rents, the construction of the model company was a black box in order to make it harder for the<lb/> company to manipulate the information. The tariff has thus incentive properties similar to a price cap. If<lb/> EMOS can be more efficient than the model, it earns additional profits, giving the company an incentive to<lb/> maximise its efficiency. At the end of the period, tariffs may be adjusted downward to force the company<lb/> to share its gains with consumers.<lb/> 46.<lb/> The reforms led to significant gains to the government through taxes and dividends, while<lb/> consumers benefited from almost 100% coverage of expanding demand, better water pressure and fewer<lb/> interruptions of services. Consumers also had to pay higher prices, but the effects were ameliorated by<lb/> direct subsidies (see below). Employees gained from wages closer to market wages.<lb/> Source: Shirley, Xu and Zuluaga, 2000.<lb/></p>

			<head>High tariffs in two water and sewage concessions in Argentina 7<lb/></head>

			<p>47.<lb/> In 1995 private participation was introduced in the water and sewage sector in the province of<lb/> Tucuman, Argentina. A 30 year concession contract was awarded to a consortium composed of Compagnie<lb/> Générale des Eaux and a local investor. Aggressive investment targets were set in the contract. These had a<lb/> major impact on prices, which rose by up to 68%. In addition, this rise was spread across all consumers<lb/> equally, with serious implications for affordability by low income households. These concerns had not<lb/> been foreseen and were not addressed early on in the reform process. The new tariff became very<lb/> unpopular and public disapproval turned to resentment after outbreaks of turbid water. A non-payment<lb/> campaign was organised and an anti-privatisation local government was elected. The financial situation of<lb/> the concessionaire further deteriorated and several attempts to renegotiate the contract failed. A social tariff<lb/> was then proposed but public confidence had been lost and the case ended in international arbitration.<lb/> 48.<lb/> In May 1993, a 30 year concession contract was awarded to a private company to operate the<lb/> water and sewage services in Buenos Aires. Those consumers who were already connected to the system<lb/> initially benefited from a significant drop in tariffs and an improvement in the quality and reliability of<lb/> service. Expansion targets set by geographical area, with poor areas prioritised, resulted in large numbers<lb/> of new households being connected. However, an unpopular decision to pass the cost of system expansion<lb/> on to new consumers in the form of a hefty infrastructure charge was one of the issues that lead to public<lb/> unrest and early contract renegotiation. This very high connection charge, unaffordable for the poor, was<lb/> replaced by a bimonthly Universal Service and Environmental Improvement fee (SUMA), which was<lb/> levied on all customers regardless of when they connected to the network. Connection charges were<lb/> reduced to US$ 120 for water or sewage, repayable over five-years in interest-free instalments averaging<lb/> US$ 4 per month. Despite the fact that the changes resulted in a decrease in average bills in poor areas of<lb/> 74%, from US$61 to US$16, even at this level the rates remained unaffordable for the poor. In addition,<lb/> the renegotiation saw a reduction in some of the targets for expansion, again to the detriment of the poor<lb/> who are the primary residents of the unserved areas.<lb/></p>

			<head>Regulating to achieve universal access<lb/> Universal access through a competitive mobile phone market and umbrella people in Nigeria<lb/></head>

			<figure>49.<lb/> Nigeria is Africa&apos;s most populated nation with some 124 million inhabitants in 2002. Until<lb/> August 2001, Nigeria had one of the lowest teledensity rates in the world. In February 2001, the<lb/> government awarded three 15-year mobile cellular GSM licences for USD 285 million and the rise in the<lb/> number of mobile subscribers has been very significant. By December 2001, there were close to 400 000<lb/> GSM subscribers. The mobile operators managed to provide access to almost as many telephone<lb/> subscribers in four months than had been installed via fixed lines in 40 years since independence (there<lb/> were some 540 000 fixed lines at the end of December 2001). Growth has been relentless, reaching two<lb/> million subscribers by March 2003. Mobile coverage was initially limited to Lagos, the largest city, and<lb/> has now spread to 219 out of 550 local government areas.<lb/></figure>

			<p>50.<lb/> Although handsets and prepaid cards are expensive, service is being extended to those who<lb/> cannot afford a mobile handset and prepaid card through &quot; umbrella people &quot; .

			<head>Extending Chilean public telecommunication service to rural areas through market-based mechanisms<lb/></head>

			<p>51.<lb/> Although the Chilean telecommunications sector was the first in Latin America to be privatised<lb/> and opened to competition, a significant part of the population was still unserved in the mid-1990s. The<lb/> government created a Telecommunications Development Fund in 1994 financed by the national budget to<lb/> encourage private investment in areas with low income and low telephone density. A council selected<lb/> projects eligible for subsidies and granted licenses to private operators through competitive bidding. The<lb/> bidder requiring the lowest one-time subsidy was awarded the license. Rural localities needing public<lb/> telephones were grouped into projects according to geographical proximity and technical solutions likely to<lb/> be cost-effective, and the winning bidder had to commit to provide at least one public telephone in each<lb/> locality, available everyday and twenty-four hours a day.<lb/> 52.<lb/> The Fund was very successful. Between 1995 and 2000 it supported the provision of payphone<lb/> service to more than 6,000 rural localities with about 2.2 million inhabitants, thereby reducing the<lb/> proportion of Chile&apos;s population living in places without access to basic voice communication from 15% in<lb/> 1994 to 1% in 2002. In addition, some 25,000 individual rural telephone lines were provided. The<lb/> subsidies awarded cost the government less than 0.3% of total telecommunications sector revenue during<lb/> the funding period, making it one of the most cost-effective telecommunications support programme<lb/> world-wide, and Fund administration cost about 3% of the subsidies granted.<lb/></p>

			<head>Extending access to telecommunication services to rural Peru<lb/></head>

			<p>53.<lb/> As part of the reforms which led to the introduction of competition in its telecommunications<lb/> sector in the 1990s, Peru has established a subsidy programme, known as the Telecommunications<lb/> Investment Fund (FITEL), to finance investment in telecommunication services in rural areas. (A rural area<lb/> is mainly defined as a territory enclosing rural settlements of less than 100 housing units together or more<lb/> than 100 dispersed or scattered units.) The Supervisory Authority for Private Investment in<lb/> Telecommunications (OSIPTEL), the regulatory body for the sector, administers the fund and selects<lb/> projects to be implemented, while the Ministry for Transport and Communications is responsible for<lb/> approving them. The fund&apos;s assets come from a levy of 1 per cent on the turnover of companies.<lb/> 54.<lb/> The first stage of the programme involved a pilot project for installation of public telephones in<lb/> the Frontera Norte (north frontier) area. The main objective of this pilot project was to gather knowledge of<lb/> possible drawbacks that might arise with the launch of larger scale projects. The company Gilat To Home<lb/> Perú S.A. (GTH) won the tender to offer the service in the 213 populated centres selected for the project.<lb/> The licensing and financing contracts for the project were signed at the end of 1998, which opened the way<lb/> to the full network installation by end 1999, the agreed delivery date. By mid-2001, the operator was<lb/> providing a normal service. The first assessment of the project revealed that it was a success with regard to<lb/> the use of public funds for the development of rural telephony, bringing services to the local populations<lb/> which had previously been either non-existent or of difficult access. Public investment or subsidy per<lb/> inhabitant came to USD 11, covering a total population of 144 522 inhabitants on the basis of an average<lb/> investment per populated centre of USD 8 609. Nevertheless, the first assessment also highlighted some<lb/> problems for local people, including with respect to non-availability in villages of pre-paid cards or long<lb/> periods without service after equipment failure. A subsequent inspection revealed improvements carried<lb/> out by GTH in response to comments made in the first report.<lb/> Source: ITU, 2001a.<lb/></p>

			<head>Achieving universal access through competition and a universal service fund in the Guatemalan<lb/> telecommunications sector<lb/></head>

			<p>55.<lb/> Until 1996, telecommunication services in Guatemala were provided by the state-owned<lb/> monopoly, GUATEL. By the mid-1990s, there was growing dissatisfaction with the performance of<lb/> GUATEL. Not only was the company comparatively inefficient (around 60 mainlines per 1,000<lb/> employees), but it was failing to satisfy mounting demand for telecommunication services. In 1996,<lb/> Guatemala had one of the lowest teledensity ratios in Latin America with only 4.2 (fixed plus cellular)<lb/> lines per 100 inhabitants. With only 350,000 fixed telephone lines in the country, unsatisfied demand was<lb/> estimated at 1,000,000 lines.<lb/> 56.<lb/> The Telecommunications Law of 1996 (Decreto 94-96) paved the way for one of the most radical<lb/> market liberalisations witnessed in the region, removing all barriers to competition. The 1996 law also<lb/> created a new regulatory agency, the Superintendencia de Telecomunicaciones (SIT). The reform involved<lb/> privatisation of GUATEL, which was transformed into a new company TELGUA, of which 95% stakes<lb/> were sold to the private sector via auction awarded to TELMEX — the Mexican leading<lb/> telecommunications company which was formerly owned by the state and privatised in 1990. There are<lb/> now more than 250 companies involved in providing the full range of telecommunication services in<lb/> Guatemala. These include a number of major international investors such as Bell South, Telefónica,<lb/> TELMEX and Millicom International. Although the local telephony market continues to be dominated by<lb/> TELGUA, with 95% of all fixed line subscribers, sixteen other companies have entered the market.<lb/> 57.<lb/> An important consequence of liberalisation has been the need to rebalance call charges, to<lb/> remove the cross-subsidy that previously existed from long distance to local calls. As a result, local call<lb/> charges increased from $0.51 per month (for the basic subscription including 200 free minutes; equivalent<lb/> to $0.003 per minute), to $5.64 per month (equivalent to $0.028 per minute). Even this, though, falls below<lb/> the estimated economic cost of around $0.030 to $0.033 per minute. Competition for long distance services<lb/> has been more vigorous, with fourteen players, of which four major ones. The combination of tariff-<lb/>rebalancing and competition has led to dramatic reductions in long distance charges, from US$1.50 per<lb/> minute to the United States in 1996, to around US$0.30 per minute in 1998. More recently, charges have<lb/> fallen to around US$0.15 per minute as a result of the introduction of the possibility of tele-selection of the<lb/> long distance operator.<lb/> 58.<lb/> Mobile telephony service was also introduced through the awarding of four licenses. Calls are<lb/> charged at around $0.14 per minute, with some calling plans costing less than $10 per month. Aided by the<lb/> rapid expansion of cellular telephony, the overall teledensity index for Guatemala has risen almost fivefold<lb/> from 4.2 to 19.7 over the period 1997/01. Although about half of the new cellular subscriptions are second<lb/> telephones for the richest 20% of the population, they are also playing an important role in rural areas<lb/> where they have become as common as fixed line telephones and have begun to be used to provide<lb/> informal public telephone services.<lb/> 59.<lb/> The proceeds of the spectrum auctions held for mobile telephony services (up to an annual<lb/> ceiling of US$5 million) were allocated to a special fund (FONDETEL) designed to support the expansion<lb/> of public telephones in rural areas. In line with best practice in a number of other Latin American<lb/> countries, FONDETEL bid out the construction and operation of public telephones to the private operator<lb/> requesting the minimum subsidy. Between 1998/99, FONDETEL disbursed US$7.5 million of subsidies<lb/> for the installation of some 1,600 public telephones. Each US$1 of subsidy leveraged between US$2-4 of<lb/> private investment, so that the total subsidy cost per town was US$4,400. The network of formal public<lb/> telephones in rural areas has increased by 80% and, as result, 50% of rural households now have a public<lb/> telephone in their community, and 80% of rural households live within 6 kilometres (or about half an hour)<lb/> of a public telephone. However, unfortunately, the revenues from spectrum auctions have recently been<lb/> exhausted and no additional funding source has been identified for FONDETEL.<lb/> Source: Foster and Araujo, 2004.<lb/></p>

			<head>Universal access through cellular phones in rural areas of Bangladesh<lb/></head>

			<p>60.<lb/> Bangladesh is one of the world&apos;s most densely populated and poorest countries. The country has<lb/> one of the least developed telecommunication systems, with a teledensity rate of 2-3 fixed phone lines per<lb/> 1,000 people in 2000. The Bangladesh Telegraph and Telecom Board (BTTB) was the state monopoly<lb/> providing telephone services until the country embarked in reforms of the sector at the beginning of the<lb/> 90s. The reform programme opened the market to competition and awarded new licenses to private<lb/> companies, including operating in the cellular phone market in 1996.<lb/> 61.<lb/> A pilot project by GrameenPhone, a cellular operator with a national license that is building and<lb/> operating a rural phone network, is enabling rural village woman to resell cellular phone services within<lb/> their villages in order to extend access to telecommunications to rural areas at affordable prices. The<lb/> project is carried out by the not-for profit company Grameen Telecom and supported by its parent<lb/> company Grameen Bank, a successful for-profit micro credit bank which is widely established in<lb/> Bangladesh. GrameenPhone is a joint venture of Grameen Telecom (35 %), Norway&apos;s telephone company<lb/> Telenor (51 %) and other stakeholders. The programme began operating in March 1997 and by November<lb/> 1999 there were 950 village phones providing telephone access to more than 65,000 people. The micro<lb/> credit bank provides village woman entrepreneurs with credit in form of a lease to buy digital GSM cell<lb/> phones from Grameen Telecom. The women re-sell phone calls and provide services for incoming and<lb/> outgoing calls in their stores, at home, in the local market or elsewhere. The income of the woman<lb/> operators consists of the difference between charges paid by customers and the amount billed to the<lb/> operators by Grameen Telecom.<lb/> 62.<lb/> Early findings suggest that the programme has had considerable development benefits. It has<lb/> reduced the cost of communications relative to other services such as transportation. It has boosted<lb/> producers&apos; returns by enabling village pay phone users to compare rural prices with city market prices,<lb/> increasing their bargaining power. It also facilitated the flow of income between oversees workers or<lb/> workers in urban cities and their families in rural villages. Finally, the programme has enabled the village<lb/> pay phone entrepreneurs, poor by most standards but among the better-off in their villages, to turn a profit.<lb/></p>

			<figure>Still, Grameen Telecom&apos;s rural development programme lags behind the targets. Its initial target was<lb/> 40,000 village pay phones installed by 2002, an average of 8,000 a year. But by the end of January 2000 it<lb/> had installed only about 1,700.<lb/> Source: Lawson and Meyenn, 2000; and Richardson, Ramirez and Haq, 2000.<lb/></figure>

			<head>Universal access in postal and courier services in Guatemala through competition and private sector<lb/> participation<lb/></head>

			<p>63.<lb/> Guatemala maintained a state monopoly for postal services until 1997. These services were<lb/> provided by the Directorate of Post and Telegraph Services (DGCT), which operated under the Ministry of<lb/> Communications, Transportation, and Public Works. The sector was characterised by poor and unreliable<lb/> service, highly subsidised tariffs, under-paid staff and financial looses of US $2 million per year. In<lb/> addition, DGCT was not able to ensure service to the geographically remote areas. Nevertheless, service<lb/> roll-out was partly achieved by private companies. Indeed, despite the legally protected monopoly, private<lb/> firms had been operating in the postal and courier market informally since the 1970s. These companies,<lb/> ranging from very small to large international firms, like DHL, engaged in a variety of activities, including<lb/> in-city messenger, in-country delivery, international courier, and international remittance transport. Most<lb/> of the companies in the in-country market were operating regionally and for national coverage they were<lb/> subcontracting each other, especially for coverage in remote areas. The private service companies were<lb/> more expensive than DGCT (although competition helped bringing down prices), yet they reached remote<lb/> villages in the country.<lb/> 64.<lb/> The competition (and better performance) by private companies lead the Government to proceed<lb/> with plans to modernise and introduce private-sector participation in the public operator. In 1997, a five<lb/> year management contract was awarded to International Post Services (IPS), a subsidiary of Canada Post,<lb/> to improve postal service and ensure an acceptable level of universal service for the entire country. The<lb/> programme included a Government subsidy paid to the operator to keep tariffs down and ensure universal<lb/> service. The programme resulted in an increase of the number of access points and there were also<lb/> significant improvements in service quality, including in terms of reductions in mail processing, transit and<lb/> delivery times. The subsidy was still high, but lower than before the management contract. The resulting<lb/> enhanced sector performance has provided an incentive for the Government to award a ten year concession<lb/> contract for service provision to IPS.<lb/> Source: De Rodriguez, 1998; and World Bank, 2003.<lb/></p>

			<head>Subsidies for power benefiting the non-poor in Guatemala<lb/></head>

			<p>65.<lb/> In 1996, Guatemala reformed its energy sector and unbundled the generation, transmission and<lb/> distribution of electricity. The project included the privatisation of state-owned assets and regulated<lb/> concessions for distribution companies. A social tariff was created to subsidise the consumption of<lb/> electricity for poor households. In 2000, tariffs were capped at USD 0.08 per kWh for all customers<lb/> consuming less than 300kWh per month. As 90% of domestic consumers were under this threshold, the<lb/> cost of subsidies — USD 50 millions — was mostly transferred to commercial and industrial customers.<lb/> However, only 40% of poor households have access to electricity in Guatemala. The consequence was that<lb/> about 90% of the value of subsidies went to the non-poor.<lb/> 66.<lb/> An important issue in this cross-subsidisation programme is that the level of the threshold to<lb/> benefit from the social tariff was too high (300kWh per month) — meaning that it was targeted to almost<lb/> all consumers rather than only the poor. But the case also highlights the importance of the connection to<lb/> the network which is often a more important obstacle to universal access than the cost of the service.<lb/> Guatemalan families without a connection to the power grid have to pay significantly more for their<lb/> electricity.

			<p>67.<lb/> After different reform efforts had failed to improve water and sewage services in Senegal, the<lb/> government decided in 1996 to introduce private participation in the sector. A state-owned holding<lb/> company, SONES (Société Nationale des Eaux du Sénégal), was established to own the assets, carry out<lb/> investments and regulate the water sector. SONES signed an &quot; enhanced &quot; affermage contract with the<lb/> private company Sénégalaise des Eaux (SDE, a subsidiary of the French water company SAUR) to operate<lb/> water utilities. Under a traditional affermage contract, the private company bills all consumers and collects<lb/> the revenue at the tariff set by the government. The company then receives a fixed fee (covering costs and<lb/> a regulated profit) for the total volume of water sold and remits the difference between the revenues<lb/> collected and the fee to the government. This mechanism does not create any disincentives to serve poor<lb/> households as the company receives the same remuneration for all kinds of consumers (that is the<lb/> affermage fee is the same for each cubic meter of water sold). The contract between SONES and SDE is<lb/> said to be an &quot;enhanced&quot; affermage contract in the sense that it incorporates some investment requirements<lb/> as well as incentives in the fee formula to meet targets on leakage and bill collection.<lb/> 68.<lb/> A social connection programme was designed to expand service among low-income households.<lb/> SDE receives an additional fee for each new connection in eligible poor households, through a fund<lb/> financed by the government and donors. There is a profit included in this fee to give incentives to the<lb/> company to install social connections. This programme was also consistent with the social tariff<lb/> established as part of the affermage contract which, as seen earlier, is a contract that does not create<lb/> disincentives to serve poor households. Additionally, the government financed with the help of donors and<lb/> NGOs the construction of &quot; standpoints &quot; (public water points) for low-income areas with no private<lb/> connection.<lb/> 69.<lb/> Eight years later, this reform has resulted in significantly better services. There has been a 20%<lb/> increase in the amount of water supplied, and the number of customers connected has increased by 35%.<lb/> Exceeding its target requirements, SDE has installed a cumulative total of 89,000 new connections, among<lb/> which 76% are social connections provided at low cost to poor households. According to the last<lb/> Senegalese Household Survey (2001), drinking water is available (less than 15 minutes away) to more than<lb/> 70% of the households (almost 90% in Dakar).<lb/></p>

			<p>70.<lb/> In 1989 Chile created a system of subsidies for water and sewage, which took effect in 1990.<lb/> Anyone who holds a social classification card (CAS), has a household water connection and is not more<lb/> than three months late in paying their water bill is eligible for the subsidy. The CAS has been in effect<lb/> since 1980 and establishes eligibility for a number of targeted subsidies in addition to water and sewage,<lb/> including a flat-rate family allowance, minimum pensions, and housing assistance. Households applying<lb/> for a CAS are visited by a municipal official who allocates points to the family based on the size and<lb/> composition of the household, the occupation and education of the household head, the assets (car,<lb/> refrigerator, land, etc.) and per capita income of the family, and the characteristics of the dwelling (e.g.<lb/> location, number of rooms, exterior and interior materials used for construction, and whether it has a water<lb/> or electrical connection). Households with less than a maximum number of points are then issued a CAS<lb/> and those with lower points receive higher priority for getting subsidies. The yearly allotments for the<lb/> water and sewage subsidy are based on bi-annual surveys of family income by region. The allotments are<lb/> allocated so as to ensure that no family in the region pays more than five percent of its income for water<lb/> and sewage. The subsidy is paid directly to the water supplier, who subtracts the appropriate amount from<lb/> each household&apos;s water bill and collects the remainder of the bill directly from the customer. On average<lb/> the subsidy covers 60% of the water bill of eligible households, although in regions with high tariffs, up to<lb/> 85% may be covered.<lb/> 71.<lb/> The number of Chilean households covered by the subsidy has gone from 5% of those eligible in<lb/> 1990 to 95% in 1996. The expansion in coverage was largely the result of a public education campaign by<lb/> the water companies to convince eligible consumers to apply, although an easing of the conditions for<lb/> eligibility also helped. Nevertheless, recent research also shows that some amount of the subsidy has<lb/> leaked to higher income groups. In addition, the administrative costs of implementing the regime are high.<lb/> In 2002, the Government decided to redistribute a substantial number of water subsidies based on an<lb/> evaluation which showed that the subsidies were not reaching the target population precisely enough.<lb/> Subsidies are normally given for a three year period; however the conditions of a household can change<lb/> during that time and therefore lower the effectiveness of the programme.<lb/></p>

			<head>Problems with a geographic targeting system for water subsidies in Colombia<lb/></head>

			<p>72.<lb/> Colombia adopted a programme of cross subsidies for poor households laid out in the Public<lb/> Residential Services Law of 1994. The objective of the reform was to unify criteria for the application of<lb/> cross-subsidies across utility industries and to guarantee consistent application of the scheme across the<lb/> country. A geographic targeting system is used to classify locations into different levels of lower and<lb/> higher socioeconomic groups to determine which customers are eligible to receive a subsidy from the tariff<lb/> structure. In each municipality dwellings with homogenous characteristics are classified into six<lb/> socioeconomic categories. The criteria are set up by the National Planning Department – a government<lb/> entity developing strategic plans for the country to promote development and economic growth which<lb/> origins date back to 1936. Households of the first, the lowest category, receive a subsidy of up to 50% of<lb/> the average service costs, those that belong to the second category receive up to 40%, and the ones<lb/> belonging to the third are given a subsidy to up to 15%. The subsidies are funded through a cross subsidy,<lb/> meaning that a surcharge has to be paid by customers of the highest household categories and by industrial<lb/> and commercial customers. The surcharges cannot exceed 20% of the water and sewage bill, and if these<lb/> are not sufficient to pay for the subsidies of the first three categories, the difference can be financed from<lb/> general tax revenues (national and provincial budgets).<lb/> 73.<lb/> Almost 83% of households are classified in the first three categories, which makes the subsidy<lb/> programme very costly and difficult to finance through the surcharges. Moreover, studies show that errors<lb/> of inclusion are large, with subsidies often leaking to higher income segments of society.<lb/></p>

			<head>Regulating to meet service standards<lb/> Ensuring quality of service in the Brazilian telecommunications sector<lb/></head>

			<p>74.<lb/> Quality of service is one of the pillars of the Brazilian telecommunication reform model, and a<lb/> high priority for the Agência Nacional de Telecomunicações (Anatel), Brazil&apos;s recently-created<lb/> independent regulatory agency of the sector. The General Plan of Quality of Service Goals for Fixed<lb/> Switched Telephone Service was issued by Resolution 30 of Anatel&apos;s Board of Directors on 29 June 1998<lb/> shortly following Anatel&apos;s creation and before Telebrás, the monopoly telecommunications provider, was<lb/> privatised. There are 36 quality of service indicators including goals for response to request for repairs,<lb/> response to requests for change of address, response time by telephone, quality of service for public<lb/> telephones, information regarding provider selection codes for the consumer, emission levels and network<lb/> modernisation. Anatel can impose fines of up to R$ 40 million and has already fined a number of carriers<lb/> for not reaching their quality of service indicators. Anatel became the first telecommunications agency in<lb/> the world to receive an ISO-9001 certification, passing rigorous review concerning a series of requirements<lb/> ranging from development of systemic procedures to internal quality audits.<lb/> Source: ITU, 2001b.<lb/></p>

			<head>Ensuring service standards through a performance contract in the Tanzanian postal sector<lb/></head>

			<p>75.<lb/> Telecommunication and postal services were provided in Tanzania until 1994 by the same public<lb/> operator, the Tanzanian Post and Telecommunication Corporation (TPTC). The postal sector was<lb/> characterised by weak financial and operational performance, little commercial orientation and under-paid<lb/> staff. Although a monopoly for letter and other basic services existed, it was not appropriately enforced,<lb/> leading to growing unregulated competition from private providers of letter and parcel delivery services. In<lb/> the early 1990s, a reform process was initiated which led to the separation of the telecommunications and<lb/> postal public entities in 1994. The Tanzania Communications Act and the Tanzania Posts Corporation Act<lb/> established the Tanzania Telecommunications Company and the Tanzania Postal Corporation (TPC). The<lb/> reform also led to the creation of the Tanzania Communications Commission (TCC), an institution charged<lb/> to regulate postal and telecommunication tariffs, monitor quality of service, oversee competition and<lb/> safeguard network coverage and access. In 2003, the TCC merged with the Tanzania Broadcasting<lb/> Commission, establishing the Tanzania Communications Regulatory Authority (TCRA). The reforms also<lb/> led to the introduction of competition in the courier sector. Licences were granted to TPC and several<lb/> courier companies to provide express services.<lb/> 76.<lb/> A performance contract between the Government and TPC was signed in 1997 with the aim of<lb/> measuring performance targets. The contract was set for three years and extended in 1999 for a further<lb/> three years. It includes clear and measurable targets and procedures for monitoring performance with<lb/> respect to quality of service, business growth, customer satisfaction, security, and profitability. The board<lb/> of directors and TPC management have financial incentives to perform calculated as a percentage of<lb/> salaries and also significant penalties for under-achievement. This includes the dismissal of the Postmaster<lb/> General in a situation where targets are missed by more than 50%. Thus, the design of the contract<lb/> provides an explicit incentive to reach the set targets. The contract is audited annually by independent<lb/> consultants, including from foreign countries (New Zealand Post International Limited — now Transend<lb/> Worldwide Limited — undertook the second audit). The first audit results indicated that the targets were<lb/> met only in two areas, speed of service and security; however, the second audit results showed that targets<lb/> were met in all parameters expect business growth.<lb/> Source: <ref type="biblio">Ianni and Lohmeyer, 2001; and Guislain, 2004; and UPU, 2004; and Walsh, 2001.<lb/></ref> Improving postal services standards through a management contract in Trinidad and Tobago<lb/></head>

			<p>77.<lb/> Until 1999, postal services in Trinidad and Tobago were provided by a division of the Ministry of<lb/> Public Utilities. It was characterised by poor financial performance, low investment and decreasing mail<lb/> volumes. The per capita mail volume stood at 12.6 pieces annually — low for an upper-middle-income<lb/> developing country — and overall mail volumes dropped by 20 % between 1995 and 1999. The quality of<lb/> service was poor with mail frequently taking seven to ten days to be delivered, and universal service<lb/> reached only 50% of households. There was a great deal of unregulated competition for regular mail<lb/> services, much based on &quot; self-delivery &quot; by utility companies.<lb/> 78.<lb/> In 1999, the government initiated a reform to modernise the postal industry. It introduced the<lb/> Postal Act, which transformed the postal operator from a government department to a public postal entity,<lb/> with commercial orientation — the Trinidad and Tobago Postal Corporation (TTPost). The TTPost was<lb/> granted more management autonomy and commercial flexibility; a reserved area was maintained for letters<lb/> with the understanding that over time this would be subject to gradual liberalisation.<lb/> 79.<lb/> The reform process started with a five-year management contract to improve efficiency, service<lb/> quality, extend universal network coverage and gradually reduce government support. The contract was<lb/> awarded through competitive bidding to New Zealand Post International Limited (now Transend<lb/> Worldwide Limited), which is not a private sector company but has established experience in reform<lb/> processes. Transend has the responsibility to manage TTPost in line with international best practice that<lb/> would be measured by annual quality of service and revenue targets. It has a strong financial interest in<lb/> seeing that the project succeeds, given that the contract entails a compensation package that includes a<lb/> management fee for the day-to-day service provision and for the completion of special agreed upon<lb/> projects. This compensation is enhanced with an incentive mechanism for exceeding certain performance<lb/> targets, coupled with possible fee reduction if one or more of the performance targets are not achieved. The<lb/> management operator will also share profits as TTPost&apos;s financial performance improves. The contract<lb/> involves five performance indicators, namely customer satisfaction, expanded reach of universal delivery,<lb/> standards for transit time, growth of revenue, and net income. The progress achieved is monitored and<lb/> measured by independent third-party organisations.<lb/></p>

			<head>Quality of service in the UK electricity distribution utilities<lb/></head>

			<p>81.<lb/> Since the reform of the electricity industry in 1990, the UK has adopted different approaches to<lb/> the regulation of service quality. Until the late 90s, quality of supply in the UK was regulated through<lb/> guaranteed standards of performance, which entitled consumers to compensation if the regulated firm<lb/> breaches them, and overall standards, which refer to system-level performance. Overall standards were set<lb/> for each distribution utility. In 1999, the regulator and the companies supported the introduction of an<lb/> incentive-based regime for service quality regulation. Since the necessary foundation work had not been<lb/> carried out, it was proposed that the incentive mechanisms should be developed as part of a work<lb/> programme, known as the Information and Incentives Project (IIP). The IIP is divided in two parts. The<lb/> first part defined output measures for service quality, set guidelines for improving the accuracy of their<lb/> measurement, and constructed a framework for reporting and monitoring. The second part of the IIP<lb/> focused on designing an incentive scheme for service quality regulation. This scheme, which is similar to a<lb/> quality-incorporated benchmarking system, links the quality performance of the utilities to their allowed<lb/> revenue. It consists of mechanisms that penalise companies for not meeting their quality of supply targets<lb/> and reward companies that exceed them, including by guaranteeing less strict standards for the next control<lb/> period.<lb/></p>

			<figure>82.<lb/> The reform of the UK electricity industry led to a noticeable improvement of service quality.<lb/> Between 1995 and 2000, both the number and duration of interruptions have decreased. The average time<lb/> lost per connected customer due to planned outages has dropped from 16.3 minutes to 9.4 minutes. The<lb/> duration of the fault-related interruptions has also declined, albeit to a lesser extent.<lb/> Source: Giannakis, Jamasb and Pollitt, 2003.<lb/></figure>

			<head>Improving access to electricity in rural Chile through alternative technologies<lb/></head>

			<p>83.<lb/> In 1994 Chile launched a subsidy programme to extend access to electricity in rural areas. Most<lb/> of the projects have involved extension of the grid, a solution that usually means a lower cost per<lb/> connected dwelling and a higher quality of service. But several projects have relied on alternative<lb/> technologies, primarily one-house photovoltaic systems. These systems have been installed in isolated<lb/> areas in the northern part of the country (for nearly 1,000 dwellings), which has some of the strongest solar<lb/> radiation in the world. These non-conventional technologies generally provide electricity at a higher cost<lb/> and poorer quality (lower voltage, fewer hours of service). But they have been an attractive alternative<lb/> where extending the grid is too costly because of the distance from the existing grid or the high dispersion<lb/> of dwellings, both of which have increased the marginal cost of rural electrification in Chile. In 1995 the<lb/> average state subsidy per dwelling amounted to US$1,080; in 1999 it reached US$1,510. This outcome is<lb/> nevertheless consistent with the programme&apos;s goal of maximising rural electricity coverage within budget<lb/> constraints. At the same time, it allows a growing role for non-conventional technologies in rural<lb/> electrification projects, as improvements in these technologies can reduce their costs and make them<lb/> increasingly competitive with conventional solutions.<lb/></p>

			<head>Expanding access to electricity in rural Kenya through alternative technologies<lb/></head>

			<p>84.<lb/> The 1997 Kenya Electric Power Act liberalised the power sector in the country and privatised the<lb/> main power company, Kenya Power and Light — though the government still owns a controlling share.<lb/> Kenya Power and Light now buys electricity from three new independent power producers, and more<lb/> independent producers are preparing to enter the market. While Kenya Power and Light retains a<lb/> monopoly on distribution, privatisation has forced the utility to carefully scrutinise programmes that are<lb/> not cost-effective, including its rural areas. It has limited generation capacity, about 800 megawatts in<lb/> 1999, and has made urban and industrial customers a priority. During the same year, less than two percent<lb/> of the rural population had access to grid electricity, and efforts of the utility to extend access failed, partly<lb/> because of the sparse rural population.<lb/></p>

			<figure>85.<lb/> As result, some rural households started to use photovoltaic systems to supply electricity<lb/> provided by private companies. The process began in the early 80s when upper-middle class households,<lb/> NGOs and donors of aid projects installed photovoltaic systems in off-grid areas. Since the 90s large<lb/> numbers of rural households started to buy small photovoltaic panels and batteries. About 120,000 solar<lb/> photovoltaic systems for household use were sold in Kenya and between 1992 and 1998 the market grew<lb/> by more than 20% a year. Although early on the process was benefiting mostly upper-middle class<lb/> households, technological innovation made it possible to supply smaller and cheaper products.<lb/> Competition also contributed to lowering the retail price for a photovoltaic system from about US$100 in<lb/> 1990 to US$65 in 1998. Furthermore, the introduction of finance agencies has allowed lower-income<lb/> households to buy photovoltaic systems on credit.<lb/> 86.<lb/> The introduction of photovoltaic systems through private entrepreneurs has shown to be<lb/> successful in extending electricity access to the rural population. Since 1990, more than 2.5 megawatts of<lb/> photovoltaic capacity have been sold in Kenya. The rural electrification programme of the utility connected<lb/> fewer than 21,000 households between 1995 and 1999, while during the same period more than 80,000<lb/> households bought solar systems. By 1999, 3 to 4 % of the rural population had acquired a photovoltaic<lb/> system.<lb/> Source: Hankins, 2000.<lb/></figure>

			<head>Adapting service standards to permit extensions of low-cost water supply and sewage in El Alto<lb/></head>

			<p>87.<lb/> In 1997, the then recently-established independent Bolivian regulator (Superintendencia de<lb/> Aguas) approved a Suez-led concession contract for Aguas del Illimani to provide water and sewage<lb/> services in La Paz and El Alto. The contract contained explicit targets for connecting poor households but<lb/> did not provide adequate financial incentives for the company to do so. Moreover, the government did not<lb/> provide targeted subsidies to ease affordability. The concession contract stated that metered, in-house<lb/> water and sewer connections were the only acceptable technology, which put service out of reach of poor<lb/> households and essentially guaranteed that the company would fail to meet its ambitious target of universal<lb/> water coverage within four years. Recognising this dilemma, the regulator and the company agreed to<lb/> experiment with cheaper technology for providing connections. Most notably, the regulator approved the<lb/> establishment of lower-cost condominial sewer and water connections. These systems provide in-house<lb/> connections at lower cost by using smaller pipe diameters and burying pipes in shallow trenches in yards or<lb/> under sidewalks. The technology was found to be acceptable to the unserved population, and has allowed<lb/> affordable service to be extended in the poor neighbourhoods of El Alto and La Paz. In 2001 the<lb/> condominial technology was recognised by the Bolivian Institute for Technical Norms and Standards.<lb/></p>

			<head>Adapting standards to expand access to water and sewage to the poor in Manila<lb/></head>

			<p>88.<lb/> Manila introduced private participation in its water and sewage network in 1997 under two<lb/> separate concessions. The two concessionaires have been encouraged to use innovative technology and<lb/> third-party provision by contracts which do not contain strict standards for what constitutes a connection,<lb/> do not disallow third-party provision and allow the concessionaire to add households served through means<lb/> other than conventional utility connections to the covered population for the calculation of compliance<lb/> with coverage targets.<lb/> 89.<lb/> Responding to the need for alternatives for reaching the poor, one of the concessionaires has<lb/> developed a system known as Bayan-Tubig (Water for the Community), for water delivery in densely-<lb/>populated, hard-to-reach slum areas. An underground water line carries water to the perimeter of a slum<lb/> neighbourhood, and is then extended above ground, partially covered, attached to a wall, or lying on the<lb/> surface. The line connects to a battery of meters from where each homeowner makes their own plastic<lb/> connection, using small diameter pipes running from the main to households on the surface or along walls.<lb/></p>

			<figure>Maintenance responsibility for the plastic pipes lies with the customers. Community-based organisations<lb/> and NGOs play a role in intermediation and mapping of the network.<lb/> 90.<lb/> Estimates suggest that the Bayan-Tubig connections have reduced water connection costs for<lb/> poor families by up to 25%. As even these reduced costs are sometimes a challenge, the concessionaire has<lb/> also introduced interest-free repayment schemes over 6 to 24 month periods. Introduced in early 1999, the<lb/> programme had provided water connections to 19,000 poor households by the end of that year, and as of<lb/> 2001 the figure had risen to over 50,000. The other concessionaire was equally unconventional in serving<lb/> the poor, arranging to sell bulk water to a steel tank manufacturing company which then installed small<lb/> networks to serve poor communities.<lb/> Source: PPIAF, 2002.

ANRT also revises interconnection<lb/> agreements where necessary and settles disputes in regard to interconnection if required to do so by one of<lb/> the parties to the agreement (in conformity with the law). ANRT lets the parties negotiate interconnection<lb/> charges freely, even though the interconnection agreement must include a number of technical,<lb/> administrative and financial conditions. Where a given operator has more than 20% of the market, it is<lb/> mandatory for it to offer a technical and tariff quotation, which must receive prior approval from ANRT<lb/> (dominant operators must maintain separate accounts for their interconnection activities).<lb/> 92.<lb/> A number of disputes concerning interconnection and abuse of dominant position have already<lb/> been referred to ANRT. A recent one involved Médi Télécom, the second licensed mobile operator, and<lb/> Maroc Télécom. At the beginning of 2001, Maroc Télécom decided to offer a ten percent discount to all its<lb/> 8 The concept of interconnection refers mainly to reciprocal services offered by operators of networks that are open to<lb/> the public, which allow all users to communicate freely with one another, regardless of the network to which they are<lb/> attached or the services that they use. It also includes services offered by the operator of a network that is open to the<lb/> public to a provider of telephone service that is open to the public.<lb/> customers calling from a fixed station to a Maroc Télécom mobile station. Médi Télécom viewed this as<lb/> anti-competitive. It alleged that the same discount should apply to all calls in either direction between fixed<lb/> and mobile stations for its customers as well. The Agency reviewed the case at the request of Médi<lb/> Télécom, and decided that the application of discounts for Maroc Télécom customers only was<lb/> discriminatory and constituted an abuse of Maroc Télécom&apos;s dominant position with respect to the fixed<lb/> network. An initial injunction was therefore issued at the end of February 2001, in which ANRT reviewed<lb/> the facts of the case and instructed Maroc Télécom to adhere strictly to the conditions set out in its terms of<lb/> reference. Since Maroc Télécom did not respond within the allotted 30-day period for doing so, ANRT<lb/> placed Maroc Télécom on notice, giving it 30 days to remedy the situation or otherwise face penalties up to<lb/> permanent withdrawal of the license.

			<head>Peruvian Court for consumer dispute resolution in the telecommunications sector<lb/></head>

			<p>93.<lb/> The Peruvian Administrative Court for consumer dispute resolution (TRASU) was created in<lb/> 1995 by the regulator, OSIPTEL. TRASU decisions are made on behalf of OSIPTEL, but its decisions are<lb/> taken independently from OSIPTEL&apos;s Board of Directors and administration. TRASU intervenes only once<lb/> the consumer appeals the operator&apos;s response to a claim. Conciliation between the operator and the<lb/> consumer may be possible during the process. TRASU is a six-member collegiate body, supported by a<lb/> technical secretariat. OSIPTEL&apos;s Board of Directors appoints members to TRASU for an undefined term.<lb/> Members are professionals of high standing who serve on a part-time basis. The technical secretariat is<lb/> staffed with competent professionals that support the administrative court decisions. TRASU issues<lb/> guidelines on how it analyses complaints, which are based on previous cases and signal to consumers and<lb/> operators the likely outcome of future decisions. TRASU also rules on the proof needed to resolve claims,<lb/> and which party bears the burden of proof. In case of complaints regarding fixed line local calls, TRASU is<lb/> authorised to ask for the following as evidence: reports on faulty service; records of technical inspection;<lb/> average and variable measured local service usage; itemised call reports; and call investigation<lb/> information.<lb/> 94.<lb/> TRASU has the power to interpret and solve claims regarding all telecommunication services,<lb/> which are related to infringements of consumer rights, including billing, installation, and quality of service.<lb/> It can also impose fines if the operator fails to abide by its decisions.

			<head>Failure to ensure independence of the telecommunications regulator in Ghana<lb/></head>

			<p>95.<lb/> The performance of telecommunication services operators in Ghana, following the liberalisation<lb/> of the sector in the 1990s, has been viewed by the government and the general public as unsatisfactory.<lb/> One of the factors that led to this poor performance relates to the fact that the independence of the National<lb/> Communication Authority (NCA), the sectoral regulatory body established in 1996, has not been<lb/> appropriately safeguarded by the law.<lb/> 96.<lb/> There are three main reasons for this. The first is that the President appoints all members of the<lb/> NCA Board. Thus, the Board can be removed at any time by the President for &quot; stated reasons &quot; , leaving the<lb/> appointment of the Board open to possible political interference. Further, the formation of the Board was<lb/> delayed — there was no Director-General and the Acting Director was changed three times in the first<lb/> three years. The Board was finally named in 2000 just before the parliamentary elections, but after these<lb/> elections, won by the opposition, a new Board was appointed. Second, the law subjects the NCA&apos;s<lb/> functions to the directions of the Minister of Communications who, since 2000, also serves as the<lb/> Chairman of the Board. For instance, according to the law, &quot; (the Minister) may give to the Authority such<lb/> directions of a general character as appear to him to be required in the public interest relating to the<lb/> discharge of the functions of the Authority &quot; . Thus, the functions of the NCA could also be open to political<lb/> interference. Third, the financial autonomy of the NCA has been seen as excessive. The law empowers it to<lb/> generate funds by requiring payment of a fixed percentage of the total turnover of fixed and mobile phone<lb/> operators. The NCA also collects a further one percent of operators&apos; turnover for the Ghana Investment<lb/> Fund for Telecommunications (GIFTEL) to promote rural telephony in particular and development of<lb/> telecommunications in general. The use of these funds by the NCA has, however, not been specified in the<lb/> law apart from the annual report that the Board must present to the President through the sectoral Minister.<lb/></p>

However, competition with incumbent SOEs was weakened<lb/> when the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) allowed SOEs into wireless service in 1996 without<lb/> paying the license fee (or the interconnection charges paid by the private companies). The DoT also<lb/> decided to increase the interconnection charge, further weakening competition.<lb/></figure>

			<p>98.<lb/> In 1997, a new independent regulator was established, the Telecommunications Regulatory<lb/> Agency of India (TRAI). From its inception, TRAI sought to increase the level of competition among<lb/> operators. It asserted its authority on interconnection prices and asked the government to renounce the<lb/> increase in the interconnection charge. DoT sued TRAI and the High Court ruled that the regulator lacked<lb/> the authority to ask for the rate change. A second conflict occurred over TRAI&apos;s attempt to introduce<lb/> &quot; calling party pays &quot; for interconnections from fixed to wireless telephones (to discourage people from not<lb/> answering their mobile phones and calling back from their fixed line), which TRAI again lost. The next<lb/> battle was between DoT and wireless carriers who where unable to pay their license fees. From the<lb/> government&apos;s point of view, this was the result of over-bidding and poor business decisions, whereas<lb/> operators argued that the government&apos;s inadequate pricing rules prevented them from being commercially<lb/> viable. Unpaid license fees soared and the DoT started to withdraw interconnection from operators unable<lb/> to pay. By early 1999, the Indian telecommunications reform was under significant pressure, with a<lb/> regulator without authority over prices and entry decisions, and many private entrants almost bankrupt and<lb/> unable to compete with SOEs.<lb/> 99.<lb/> In March 1999, in an attempt to solve these problems, a new policy was adopted which gave<lb/> TRAI the authority to regulate prices and to adjudicate disputes between SOEs and private entrants.<lb/> Following further controversies, the reform was appealed and a new ruling of the High Court vacated the<lb/> authority of TRAI over the DoT. In January 2000, the government adopted an ordnance that removed<lb/> authority over telecommunications from the High Court and created a Telecommunications Dispute<lb/> Settlement Appellate Tribunal. New changes were agreed between TRAI and the government to level the<lb/> playing field between SOEs and private wireless companies. The reform is now considered a success,<lb/> leading to a rapid growth of reliable and affordable wireless services over the last years.<lb/> Source: Noll and Wallsten, 2004.<lb/></p>

			<head>Difficulties to implement a regulatory framework for postal services in Argentina<lb/></head>

			<p>100.<lb/> Until 1993, postal services in Argentina were provided by the state owned postal operator<lb/> ENCOTEL (Empresa Nacional de Correos y Telégrafos), which had a statutory monopoly on postal<lb/> service provision. ENCOTEL was providing a universal service consisting of the collection and delivery of<lb/> ordinary mail items up to 20 grams, the handling of standard telegrams up to 20 words and giro checks up<lb/> to ARS1000 ($1). The state-owned operator was characterised by poor service, low productivity, limited<lb/> management information and losses of over $150 millions per annum. The monopoly, though, already<lb/> started to weaken in the 70s with the Postal Law allowing private companies to obtain &quot; permissions &quot; to<lb/> service the market. By 1994, about 300 private sector companies were operating in the market with a share<lb/> of 50%, though only 4 were of significant size.<lb/> 101.<lb/> In 1992, the Government of Argentina introduced a decree that established a new regulator for<lb/> the sector, the National Post and Telegraph Commission (CNCT), clearly separating the regulatory and<lb/> operating functions. At the same time, ENCOTEL started to operate under private law and became the<lb/> National Post and Telegraph Company (ENCOTESA). One year later, in 1993, the postal monopoly was<lb/> abolished and the market was officially opened to private participation.<lb/> 102.<lb/> In 1997 the Government decided to introduce private sector participation in ENCOTESA through<lb/> a 30 year concession contract. The competitive tendering process was awarded to the Macri Group, a local<lb/> consortium, with technical expertise provided by the British Post Office. ENCOTESA was to provide basic<lb/> universal service set at pre-concession levels. Tariffs for these services were also fixed at pre-concession<lb/> levels whereas ENCOTESA was free to set prices for the other services. The concession holder was further<lb/> obliged to invest US $250 million over the first ten years to improve outlets and service provision. It was<lb/> also required to pay a fee for the rights to the concession of USD 104 million per annum in two six-<lb/>monthly tranches. At the same time, an effective regulatory framework was not put in place in the case of<lb/> the other private operators of postal services. No license was required for private companies to access the<lb/> postal market, except for a subscription in the Public Register of the Suppliers of Postal Services and the<lb/> payment of an annual sum of US $5000. In addition, there were no requisites for quality standards and<lb/> private companies were also excluded from requirements of universal postal service.<lb/> 103.<lb/> The concession initially led to several improvements, including with respect to efficiency through<lb/> inter alia automation of administrative functions and installation of telecommunication networks<lb/> integrating the first 500 of the mail&apos;s 1,500 branches, thereby offering new services. Financial losses were<lb/> increasingly reduced and reached USD 20 million in 1999. However, the lack of a sound regulatory<lb/> framework to underpin liberalisation coupled with large financial demands on ENCOTESA (fee payments<lb/> plus investment requirements) meant that this process came to a halt. While there has been no contraction<lb/> of services in rural areas neither has there been any significant roll-out of new addresses or postal outlets in<lb/> the country-side. Similarly, limited efforts were made to improve quality of service.<lb/> 104.<lb/> In March 2001, new regulations were established to bring change from a completely free market<lb/> to a market of licensed competition, including with respect to quality and universal service obligations. All<lb/> the private operators are required to obtain ISO 9000 approval as a condition to retain their licenses and<lb/> Article 48 provides for warnings, fines, and temporary or permanent withdrawal of operating rights for<lb/> infringing the regulations.<lb/> Source: <ref type="biblio">Fontdevila and Jensen, 2003; and Walsh, 2001.<lb/></ref> Effective regulation to ensure competition in the postal services in Sweden<lb/></head>

			<p>105.<lb/> In 1993, the Swedish postal monopoly was abolished and the postal operator was transformed<lb/> from a government agency to a limited liability company owned by the state, Sweden Post. Since then,<lb/> there are no reserved areas maintained in the postal market and a regulatory authority was established, the<lb/> National Post and Telecom Agency (PTS). PTS is an independent regulator monitoring the liberalised<lb/> postal market, including with respect to pricing, quality of service, and competition in the sector.<lb/> Additionally, during the same period, the Swedish Competition Authority was established charged to<lb/> implement the general competition law in Sweden. The letter mail market is dominated by Sweden Post,<lb/> with a market share of 93% in 2003. Its biggest competitor, CityMail, had a market share of 6.5% during<lb/> the same year while the remaining 0.5% of the letter mail market is handled by 26 local postal operators.<lb/> 106.<lb/> Competition rules have been an effective instrument to deal with anti-competitive behaviour in<lb/> the Swedish postal market. Since 1993, the Swedish Competition Authority has had more than a hundred<lb/> cases concerning Sweden Post. In one case, Sweden Post had exclusive agreement conditions tying<lb/> customers into buying from it all or the majority of their distribution needs. The Competition Authority<lb/> considered these practices an abuse of Sweden Post&apos;s dominant position and the Stockholm City Court<lb/> ordered Sweden Post to pay a fine of SEK 3.8 million for infringing the law. In another case, Sweden Post<lb/> applied a zonal pricing scheme for bulk mail postal services. The pricing structure meant that a lower rate<lb/> would be applied to distribution in 19 places/areas, which were then further subdivided into 3 zones. The<lb/> lowest rate was in the area that covered the three largest urban regions — Stockholm, Göteborg and<lb/> Malmö. The Authority considered that Sweden Post&apos;s pricing did not reflect the way individual customers<lb/> purchased postal distribution services, and that they were designed to make it difficult for other companies<lb/> to compete. The practice was thus considered an abuse of Sweden Post&apos;s dominant position and the<lb/> company was ordered under penalty of a fine not to apply zonal pricing. In yet another case, Sweden Post<lb/> applied a &quot; cream skimming&apos;&apos; clause. This meant that customers could anticipate a price increase if they<lb/> purchased a part of their distributional needs from CityMail. The Competition Authority ruled that this was<lb/> a violation of the law, particularly as this practice did not entail any provision of information to customers<lb/> on the price consequences of not purchasing all their needs from Sweden Post.<lb/> <ref type="biblio">Source: Jonsson, 2004; King, 2001; PTS, 1999; and Svensson, 1998.<lb/></ref> An independent regulatory agency in the Chilean water supply sector<lb/></head>

			<p>107.<lb/> The Chilean reform of the water supply sector greatly strengthened monitoring, by replacing a<lb/> hands-on government agency with an independent, arms-length regulator. Before reform, the Santiago<lb/> Metropolitan Sanitary Works Enterprise (EMOS) was under the supervision of SENDOS (Servicio<lb/> Nacional de Obras Sanitarias), an arm of the Ministry of Public Works. The reform created an independent<lb/> regulatory agency, the Superintendency of Sanitary Services (SSS), designed to signal government&apos;s<lb/> commitment to potential private investors and avoid consumer exploitation.<lb/> 108.<lb/> The organisational design of the SSS was detailed in a law that mandated a small, professional<lb/> staff with above average civil service salaries. The SSS&apos;s maximum professional staff cannot exceed 45<lb/> according to the law, while SENDOS had over 300 staff when it was dissolved in 1990. Although the staff<lb/> of both agencies were civil servants, the salaries for SSS professionals are similar to those of bank or stock<lb/> market regulators, and hence higher than those which SENDOS could pay. All SSS professional staff have<lb/> completed at least four years of higher education, which was not true in SENDOS, and most are engineers.<lb/> Unlike SENDOS, the SSS has no management responsibilities. Its focus is on measuring cost and<lb/> efficiency in the context of tariff adjustments and on assuring compliance with quality standards and<lb/> investment plans. In addition, the new regulatory contract for EMOS signals government commitment to<lb/> reform by including specific provisions related to enforcement against government reneging of the<lb/> contract. Any water company can appeal a dispute over tariffs to the SSS within 30 days. If the SSS and<lb/> the company fail to reach agreement, a panel of three arbitrators — one appointed by the company, one by<lb/> the government and one jointly agreed — has 37 days to reach a decision that both sides must accept.<lb/> Decisions can also be appealed to the courts. The fact that utilities can appeal the decision of the regulator<lb/> increases the credibility of the contract.<lb/> Source: Shirley, Xu and Zuluaga, 2000.<lb/></p>

			<head>Transparency and users&apos; involvement<lb/> Citizen Report Cards in Bangalore<lb/></head>

			<p>109.<lb/> The Public Affairs Centre (PAC) in Bangalore, India, has done pioneering work on Citizen<lb/> Report Cards over the past decade. The first report card on Bangalore&apos;s public agencies in 1994 covered<lb/> municipal services, water supply, electricity, telecom and transport. Since then, PAC has brought out report<lb/> cards on several other cities, rural services and also on social services such as health care. The findings of<lb/> the first CRC on Bangalore were most striking. Almost all the public service providers received low ratings<lb/> from the people. Agencies were rated and compared in terms of public satisfaction, corruption and<lb/> responsiveness. The media publicity that the findings received, and the public discussions that followed,<lb/> brought the issue of public services out in the open. Civil society groups began to organise themselves to<lb/> voice their demands for better performance. Some of the public agencies responded to these demands and<lb/> took steps to improve their services. The inter-agency comparisons and the associated public glare seem to<lb/> have contributed to this outcome. When the second report card on Bangalore came out in 1999, these<lb/> improvements were reflected in the somewhat better ratings that the agencies received. Still several<lb/> agencies remained indifferent and corruption levels continued to be high. The third CRC on Bangalore, in<lb/> 2003, has shown a surprising turnaround in the city&apos;s services. It noted a remarkable rise in the citizen<lb/> ratings of almost all the agencies. Not only did public satisfaction improve across the board, but problem<lb/> incidence and corruption seem to have declined perceptibly in the routine transactions between the public<lb/> and the agencies. It is clear that more decisive steps have been taken by the agencies to improve services<lb/> between 1999 and 2003.<lb/> <ref type="biblio">Source: Paul, 2004; and Ravindra, 2004.<lb/></ref> Transparency in Peru&apos;s telecommunications regulator<lb/></head>

			<p>110.<lb/> OSIPTEL, Peru&apos;s regulatory body for the telecommunications sector, has established several<lb/> mechanisms to generate a greater level of transparency in its daily activities and especially in its decision<lb/> making. These include:<lb/> • Advance publication of any standard of general application, with inputs received from operating<lb/> companies and consumers analysed, evaluated and taken into account in the proposed measures.<lb/> • Public hearings providing an exchange of views on specific topics, to create a direct relationship<lb/> between OSIPTEL and operators, consumers and other interested parties.<lb/> • Consultations to solve disputes between public telecommunication service operators or between<lb/> an operating company and consumers via conciliation and agreement between the parties.<lb/> • Establishment of independent, ad hoc collegiate bodies of multidisciplinary experts to resolve<lb/> disputes.<lb/> 111.<lb/> Other activities aimed at adding transparency to OSIPTEL&apos;s regulatory decisions include the<lb/> holding of seminars, the preparation of publications and allowing access to the general public to its<lb/> Information and Documentation Services, which hold the technical studies underlying OSIPTEL&apos;s<lb/> regulatory decisions, as well as the regulatory policies applied in other countries.<lb/> 112.<lb/> In 2002, following increasing demand from consumers for information, OSIPTEL began<lb/> experimenting with a mobile unit called MoviAyuda which travels throughout Lima, the capital city,<lb/> especially to high-complaint locations and areas with high pedestrian traffic. MoviAyuda brings the<lb/> regulator to the consumer, facilitates access to information, and reduces consumer costs and efforts in<lb/> obtaining relevant information. MoviAyuda also provides valuable feedback on the main problems<lb/> between operators and their customers, enabling the regulator to identify issues requiring policy action.<lb/> MoviAyuda doubled OSIPTEL&apos;s contacts with consumers in the initial two months of its launch —<lb/> including calls to its call centre (FonoAyuda) and visits to the regulator&apos;s offices. OSIPTEL has<lb/> furthermore set up temporary kiosks in highly-populated locations — such as business centres, public<lb/> squares and universities — staffed by personnel that can provide information or take complaints.<lb/></p>

			<head>The Australian Consumer Consultative Forum<lb/></head>

			<p>113.<lb/> The Australian Communications Authority (ACA) — the telecommunications regulatory agency<lb/> responsible for licensing, technical regulation and consumer protection — has a legislative obligation to<lb/> provide information to consumers on telecommunication issues, with the goal of creating a community that<lb/> is informed about the rights and options available to them in Australia&apos;s market. The Consumer<lb/> Consultative Forum (CCF) was established in 1997 in accordance with the Australian Communications<lb/> Authority Act 1997. The forum meets twice a year and provides the ACA with a formal mechanism for<lb/> consulting consumer representatives on a wide range of telecommunication issues. Members of the CCF<lb/> include organisations that represent consumer interests from a variety of perspectives, relevant government<lb/> agencies and industry bodies. The terms of reference for the CCF are to: a) assist the ACA with consumer<lb/> consultation on matters relating to its telecommunication functions; b) ensure that consumer interests are<lb/> adequately considered in ACA&apos;s decision-making; and c) assist in informing the community about<lb/> telecommunication service issues and matters relating to the industry. Issues put forward for consultation<lb/> include access to services, quality of service, impact of new technologies on consumers, including those<lb/> with special interests and needs, and comprehensive consumer impact statements.<lb/></p>

			<figure>PART II: NETWORK INFRASTRUCTURE SERVICES AND THE GATS<lb/> I.<lb/> Introduction<lb/> 114.<lb/> The aim of this part of the study is to complement Part I by linking the discussion of the<lb/> liberalisation of network infrastructure services at the national level with the GATS. It explores the main<lb/> issues related to these services in current GATS negotiations in terms of new possibilities for progress in<lb/> light of real liberalisation taking place in many countries and of important considerations specific to these<lb/> services.<lb/></figure>

			<p>115.<lb/> More precisely, this part of the study starts from the premise that to date, with the exception of<lb/> telecommunication services, progress on bound liberalisation of network infrastructure services under the<lb/> GATS has been limited. This notwithstanding the potential gains that can be derived by making GATS<lb/> commitments in these services. It thus reviews some of the key concerns potentially influencing WTO<lb/> Members&apos; decisions not to enter commitments in these services and attempts to address them.<lb/> 116.<lb/> In particular, it reviews problems raised in relation to the main classification instruments used by<lb/> WTO Members in making commitments in network infrastructure services and what options are available<lb/> to countries in this regard. It then examines key GATS provisions that may be relevant for the provision of<lb/> these services to the public. The discussion in Part I shows that there is a strong public service aspect to the<lb/> provision of network infrastructure services and that they require an appropriate regulatory framework to<lb/> ensure social objectives, such as availability, quality and affordability of service. The aim here is to address<lb/> concerns raised in relation to the potential impact of the GATS on governments&apos; control over the provision<lb/> of these services and explore how its framework can accommodate and support the objectives of national<lb/> polices.<lb/> 117.<lb/> Like other international treaties, GATS disciplines can put regulatory constraints on Member<lb/> governments. Yet countries accept such disciplines because they deem them necessary to reaping the full<lb/> benefits from international cooperation in a rules-based system. The underlying thread throughout this part<lb/> of the study is that the GATS affords wide flexibility for Members to tailor obligations to their national<lb/> policy objectives.<lb/> 118.<lb/> The next section reviews the benefits that may arise from enhanced GATS commitments in<lb/> network infrastructure services. Section III then discusses the limited progress achieved so far on<lb/> liberalising these services under the GATS. Section IV presents the main issues related to the classification<lb/> of network infrastructure services in the context of the GATS. The remaining sections assess whether main<lb/> GATS disciplines may lead to a loss of government ability to ensure adequate provision of these services<lb/> to the public.<lb/></p>

			<head>II.<lb/> Benefits of improved GATS commitments<lb/></head>

			<p>119.<lb/> It is important to recall the economic case that underpins bound liberalisation of network<lb/> infrastructure services under the GATS. Enhanced GATS commitments in these services can create<lb/> momentum for further domestic sector reform and much needed investment capital, and can anchor these<lb/> reforms within an international legal framework. GATS commitments can also provide a credible signal<lb/> that the government is committed to sector reform and has taken the necessary legal and regulatory<lb/> measures to allow for such investment (<ref type="biblio">Bressie et al., 2004</ref>).<lb/> 120.<lb/> In particular, GATS commitments send a signal to WTO Member governments and, in turn, their<lb/> investors, that there will be a rules-based, transparent, predictable and non-discriminatory regime in place.<lb/> In addition, the dispute settlement system provides an avenue of recourse should a country&apos;s<lb/> implementation of sector reforms fail to satisfy that country&apos;s GATS commitments. Investors who may<lb/> have questioned the government&apos;s commitment to sector reform can rest assured that there is an<lb/> international process for settling these disputes (through their governments) where a WTO Member has<lb/> undertaken GATS commitments in that sector. Without such commitments, investors would have to rely<lb/> solely on domestic legal remedies or international arbitration, if such recourse is available. WTO<lb/> commitments can thus contribute to improve the investment climate and increase the likelihood of new<lb/> investment in the sector.<lb/> 121.<lb/> This new investment can in turn provide capital, as well as technical and managerial expertise, to<lb/> build and expand the networks and services. This can be particularly important for network infrastructure<lb/> services which, as seen in Part I, require huge amounts of capital investment.<lb/> 122.<lb/> Another dimension of GATS commitments relates to the mercantilist nature of trade negotiations.<lb/> While considerable unilateral liberalisation of trade in services has taken place, it has been uneven,<lb/> especially in areas of export interest to developing countries. However, in trade negotiations, some<lb/> leverage for obtaining commitments from trading partners can be generated if a Member signals a<lb/> willingness to make GATS commitments in sectors or modes of export interest or in other parts of the<lb/> WTO agenda.<lb/></p>

			<head>III.<lb/> Uneven and limited progress to date<lb/></head>

			<p>123.<lb/> Notwithstanding these benefits, with the exception of telecommunication services, progress on<lb/> committing these services under the GATS has been limited. The telecommunications sector is one of the<lb/> most committed sectors overall. 105 WTO Members (counting EC Member States individually) have made<lb/> specific commitments concerning some aspect of the telecommunications sector. In basic<lb/> telecommunications, commitments have been made by 104 governments, 90 of whom committed during or<lb/> since the negotiations on basic telecommunications that took place after the end of the Uruguay Round.<lb/> Their suppliers account for well in excess of 90% of the world&apos;s total telecommunications revenues. In the<lb/> area of value-added telecommunication services, 89 governments have made commitments. It should be<lb/> recognised, however, that commitments may imply very different levels of access depending on the<lb/> limitations scheduled.<lb/> 124.<lb/> Nevertheless, the situation is quite different in the case of the other sectors. Including the post-<lb/>Uruguay Round accession countries, few WTO Members have made commitments in postal services,<lb/> although more Members have committed to courier services (10 and 49 respectively). About 17<lb/> commitments were made on energy distribution, and 56 commitments (counting EC Member States<lb/> individually) were made on waste water management services. No commitments have been made on water<lb/> distribution services.<lb/> 125.<lb/> This varied situation is due to a combination of factors. First, introduction of competition in the<lb/> telecommunications sector, which has been more widely embraced than in other infrastructure sectors, has<lb/> lead to significant price decreases and improved service world-wide. The working group established during<lb/> the Uruguay Round succeeded in producing a substantive sectoral Annex for the sector. The Annex on<lb/> Telecommunications sets out guarantees of reasonable access to and use of basic telecommunication<lb/> services provided by public operators. In addition, unlike the other sectors, telecommunication services<lb/> were negotiated by WTO Members as a separate negotiation dedicated to the sector following the Uruguay<lb/> Round. The Reference Paper on Basic Telecommunications (hereafter the &quot; Reference Paper &quot; ) also<lb/> emerged in the separate negotiations. The Reference Paper consists of a set of obligations for a pro-<lb/>competitive regulatory framework for basic telecommunications that become legally binding obligations<lb/> when a Member adds these to its schedule of commitments. To date, 78 Members have committed to the<lb/> Reference Paper in whole or with few, if any departures.<lb/> 126.<lb/> Conversely, as seen in Part I, the introduction of competition has been more gradual or difficult<lb/> in the other sectors. Nevertheless, since the Uruguay Round significant reforms to introduce competition<lb/> have been undertaken which have changed the market characteristics of these services in many countries.<lb/> So there seems to be scope now to achieve more progress at the multilateral level and the Doha Round<lb/> offers WTO Members an opportunity for anchoring recent policy reforms, giving them more permanency<lb/> in a flexible and progressive manner.<lb/> 127.<lb/> Yet so far, with the possible exception of telecommunications, only relatively few Members have<lb/> tabled new or improved offers in these services and developing countries&apos; participation remains limited. To<lb/> date, only a few Members have offered new commitments or improved upon or clarified existing<lb/> commitments in the relevant network infrastructure services: telecommunications (36), postal services and<lb/> courier services (15) energy services (14) and waste water treatment services (13).<lb/></p>

			<head>IV.<lb/> Classification of network infrastructure services<lb/></head>

			<p>128.<lb/> Part of the reason explaining this lack of progress relates to classification issues. Two main<lb/> instruments are used in the WTO for this purpose: the GATS Services Sectoral Classification List<lb/> (commonly referred to as W/120) and the United Nations Provisional Central Product Classification<lb/> (Provisional CPC). W/120 lists 12 services sectors, disaggregated in about 160 sub-sectors, indicating for<lb/> each of them the corresponding Provisional CPC number. The GATS does not oblige Members to use any<lb/> specific classification instruments, though once included in a schedule of commitments the corresponding<lb/> classification becomes legally binding.<lb/> 129.<lb/> For the most part, the concerns seem to reflect the way in which network infrastructure services<lb/> were provided at the time the classifications were developed. For instance, energy services are not<lb/> classified as a separate section under W/120. The few GATS commitments on energy services are<lb/> scheduled under pipeline transportation of fuels under transport services and as several entries such as<lb/> technical testing and analysis, and services incidental to mining and energy distribution under other<lb/> business services. This is largely due to the fact that energy markets were characterised at the time of the<lb/> Uruguay Round by vertically-integrated, state-owned monopolies, operating mainly in national markets,<lb/> especially in the case of electricity companies. Moreover, it had been a traditional practice in the energy<lb/> sector not to draw clear lines of distinction between goods and services. This was inconsistent with the<lb/> rationale of the Round, which was based on the clear and precise identification of trade-related services.<lb/> 130.<lb/> Similar issues also arise in the case of postal/courier and environmental services. The Provisional<lb/> CPC classifies postal services as the relevant delivery services carried out exclusively by national postal<lb/> administrations and courier services as essentially the same delivery services performed by private<lb/> companies. In reality, public postal administrations and private companies compete not only in a number of<lb/> services traditionally open, such as parcel and express delivery, but also in services once more commonly<lb/> reserved to public postal administrations. Several countries are also of the view that W/120 and the<lb/> Provisional CPC — which comprise sewage services, refuse-disposal services, sanitation and similar<lb/> services and other services — are outdated and do not reflect commercial realities in environmental<lb/> services as they focus mainly on waste management and pollution control.<lb/> 131.<lb/> Furthermore, one important feature of the GATS classification (and of most classifications) is<lb/> that services sectors are broken down into segments, which in reality are often bundled with other<lb/> activities, such as transportation, engineering, construction and financial services. For example, one<lb/> characteristic of postal and courier services is that they typically own their own fleets of trucks and even<lb/> airplanes. They are thus also dependent on commitments in air and road transport services that are<lb/> identified as sectors in their own right in W/120. Road transport may be a significant means of delivery for<lb/> parcels and other items within geographic regions or contiguous countries, and air transport is the<lb/> predominant means of delivery among distant locations. This can have important implications for the value<lb/> of commitments when, for example, different levels of market access are extended to different activities<lb/> that as a practical matter are inter-dependent or supplied in a bundled manner.<lb/></p>

			<head>Options available to WTO Members in current negotiations<lb/></head>

			<p>132.<lb/> These definitional issues are important because they define the extent to which specific<lb/> commitments apply to a given market. WTO Members have thus been discussing ways to modernise the<lb/> classifications under W/120 and ideas have been put forward to address the related concerns. While in light<lb/> of divergent views it may be difficult in the short-term to agree on new classification instruments, as noted<lb/> earlier, WTO Members are not required to use any particular classification and the Members concerned are<lb/> free to modify the classifications contained in their schedules of commitments (as long as consistency with<lb/> previous commitments is maintained). By the same token, those Members that consider that W/120<lb/> remains a valid framework to schedule commitments in the relevant sectors can simply maintain it in their<lb/> schedules.<lb/> 133.<lb/> For example, in the case of energy several proposals have been tabled by some WTO Members<lb/> concerning the organisation of W/120, with the aim of creating a definition of the sector to facilitate the<lb/> scheduling of commitments. Most of the negotiating proposals define the scope of the energy services<lb/> sector as covering the whole chain of energy activities (from resource identification to transmission and<lb/> distribution). They suggest new classifications or &quot; scheduling guides &quot; that can be used to make<lb/> commitments under the existing classification structure (from recent discussions it seems that these WTO<lb/> Members have abandoned the idea to introduce a new entry for energy in W/120). Some countries<lb/> (Norway and the US) have then presented offers that include a separate energy-related section in the<lb/> schedule. Meanwhile, other Members have made offers containing energy-related commitments under<lb/> other related categories such as transport and business services.<lb/> 134.<lb/> For postal and courier services the main issue relates to the integration of courier services into<lb/> postal services, given that the original premise for having separate classifications no longer applies. Most<lb/> submissions thus propose removal of the distinction between postal and courier services. In environmental<lb/> services, several Members have proposed revised classifications of the sector, they felt better reflect the<lb/> commercial realities of the sector. Here again, while some Members have made offers which have de facto<lb/> adopted a new classification for environmental services, other Members have simply retained W/120. The<lb/> most ambitious of the proposals has been submitted by the EC and suggests the creation of seven sub-<lb/>sectors based on the environmental media (air, water, soil, waste, noise and so forth). 9 The EC submission<lb/> includes a category for &quot; Services related to the collection, purification and distribution of water &quot; , which is<lb/> not classified in either W/120 or in the services part of the Provisional CPC, but which is technically often<lb/> closely associated with environmental services as seen in Part I.<lb/> 135.<lb/> WTO Members have also been discussing ways to ensure that any commitments in network<lb/> infrastructure services are not undermined by lack of commitments in other sectors. One potential solution<lb/> could be the establishment of a list or guide similar to the one proposed by some Members for energy<lb/> services. This list (in addition to the identification of &quot; core &quot; services) would comprise services which are<lb/> not telecommunication, postal/courier or environmental per se, but which are related or important to their<lb/> provision. These related services would be subject to a &quot; cluster &quot; or &quot; check-list &quot; , which could be used as an<lb/> aide-mémoire during the negotiations. The resulting candidates for commitments would then be scheduled<lb/> in the relevant GATS sectors.<lb/></p>

			<head>V.<lb/> The GATS and policy control<lb/></head>

			<p>136.<lb/> Perhaps more importantly, particularly in the case of environmental network and energy services,<lb/> concerns have been raised about the potential effect of the GATS on the ability of governments to ensure<lb/> adequate provision of these services to the public. In practice, this refers to the possible impact of the<lb/> Agreement on governments&apos; ability to maintain their traditional public service responsibilities either<lb/> through monopoly public utilities, exclusive rights to provide services or appropriately regulated<lb/> competition. These problems are intensified by the fact that the GATS is a relatively young agreement and<lb/> some of its provisions remain to be tested in practice. In light of the importance of these services for<lb/> society and their highly regulated nature, governments have been cautious about agreeing to subject these<lb/> sectors to binding commitments on competitive supply. The GATS, like other legally bound undertakings<lb/> in the WTO (or other international treaties), can affect the regulatory conduct of governments. At the same<lb/> time, the Agreement affords WTO Members considerable flexibility in this regard.<lb/> 137.<lb/> The GATS applies to any service in any sector, with two main exclusions, the most important of<lb/> which in the context of network infrastructure services is the exclusion of services supplied in the exercise<lb/> of governmental authority. 10 It defines trade in services by reference to four modes of supply. The<lb/> traditional concept of trade in goods is imbedded in &quot; cross border supply &quot; (mode 1), which refers to the<lb/> supply of a service from the territory of one Member into the territory another Member. &quot; Consumption<lb/> abroad &quot; (mode 2) involves the supply of a service in the territory of one Member to a service consumer of<lb/> another Member. Network infrastructure services are for the most part supplied through the establishment<lb/> of a &quot; commercial presence &quot; (mode 3), possibly accompanied by the &quot; presence of a natural person(s) &quot;<lb/> (mode 4).<lb/> 138.<lb/> The Agreement explicitly recognises in its Preamble &quot; the right of Members to regulate the supply<lb/> of services within their territory in order to meet national policy objectives &quot; . Market access (Article XVI)<lb/> and national treatment (Article XVII) need to be granted only in sectors which a Member lists in its<lb/> schedule of specific commitments. Members have also significant flexibility in scheduling as they are free<lb/> to choose and define the sectors, and select the modes of supply for which they are ready to undertake<lb/> specific commitments. Commitments can additionally be qualified with various types of relevant<lb/> limitations, thus allowing Members to tailor them to specific national policy objectives.<lb/> 139.<lb/> In the absence of specific commitments, the GATS imposes only limited obligations. The most<lb/> important of these is the most-favoured-nation (MFN) treatment, a prohibition to discriminate among<lb/> foreign providers supplying the same service. Each member had the opportunity to seek exemption from<lb/> the MFN obligation at the date of entry into force of the Agreement (an opportunity also afforded to<lb/> subsequent acceding countries). Even for committed services, many regulatory practices and objectives not<lb/> relevant to listing within the schedule itself are currently subject to fairly minimal disciplines on domestic<lb/> regulation (see below).<lb/> 140.<lb/> Regulations may also breach obligations and commitments under the GATS and still be allowed<lb/> under the provisions of Article XIV on exceptions. These provisions can be invoked to protect major<lb/> public interests, including safety, human, plant or animal life or health, national security, public morals and<lb/> public order. They can also be invoked to deal with the effects of a default in services contracts. The<lb/> measures should not, however, be applied in a manner which would constitute a means of arbitrary or<lb/> unjustifiable discrimination between countries where like conditions prevail or a disguised restriction on<lb/> trade in services.<lb/></p>

			<head>The carve-out for &quot; services in the exercise of governmental authority &quot;<lb/></head>

			<p>141.<lb/> As noted, the GATS applies in principle to all services, except those provided in the exercise of<lb/> governmental authority. GATS Article I.3 (b) states that, for the purpose of the GATS, &quot; services &quot; include<lb/> &quot; any service in any sector except services supplied in the exercise of governmental authority &quot; . This<lb/> exception is further defined in Article I.3 (c), which specifies that &quot; a service supplied in the exercise of<lb/> governmental authority &quot; means &quot; any service, which is supplied neither on a commercial basis, nor in<lb/> competition with one or more service suppliers &quot; . As such, supply of services by a monopoly (whether<lb/> publicly or privately owned) is not alone sufficient to exempt such services from coverage, if they are sold<lb/> to the public on a commercial basis.<lb/> 142.<lb/> In practice, since there is no single model of governmental provision of these services within<lb/> WTO membership, as the concept varies according to different sectors or segments, national traditions and<lb/> legal conditions, the coverage of the carve-out will vary depending on the country and service concerned.<lb/> However, uncertainties remain about its exact scope (see <ref type="biblio">Krawjeski, 2003; Cossy, 2005; and Adlung,<lb/> 2005</ref>). This definition does not provide for a clear determination of whether and under what circumstances<lb/> network infrastructure services provided on a monopoly basis by public utilities of particular Members<lb/> would fall outside the coverage of &quot;services&quot;.<lb/> 143.<lb/> This uncertainty stems mainly form the lack of clear definitions or guidelines. For example,<lb/> regarding services supplied on a non-commercial basis, while services provided for free would be likely to<lb/> fulfil this condition, it is less clear whether the same could be said in the case of cost-recovery fees. Even<lb/> equating commercial with profit-seeking would still leave some questions unanswered as to what concepts<lb/> of profit would be relevant. Similar questions arise with respect to the precise meaning of &quot; nor in<lb/> competition with one or more service suppliers &quot; , coupled with the fact that some network infrastructure<lb/> services, e.g. environmental network services, remain for the most part natural monopolies, meaning there<lb/> may only be one supplier in a given market.<lb/></p>

			<head>Network infrastructure services and government procurement<lb/></head>

			<p>144.<lb/> Another important issue concerning the scope of the GATS relates to government procurement.<lb/> Government procurement of services — defined as the &quot; procurement by governmental agencies of services<lb/> purchased for governmental purposes and not with a view to commercial resale or with a view to use in the<lb/> supply of services for commercial resale &quot; — is exempted from the MFN, market access and national<lb/> treatment obligations (Article XIII:1). Since the conclusion of the Uruguay Round, WTO Members have<lb/> been negotiating the possibility to develop disciplines for procurement of services. For the time being, the<lb/> only comprehensive WTO disciplines in this area are contained in the plurilateral Agreement on<lb/> Government Procurement (GPA).<lb/> 145.<lb/> A key question that arises in the context of government procurement of services is to what extent<lb/> contractual arrangements, such as concessions or build-operate-transfers (BOTs), fall under the Article XIII<lb/> definition of government procurement. It is unclear under what circumstances and what types of<lb/> arrangements would fall outside the scope of these three central GATS provisions. As seen in Part I,<lb/> concessionary arrangements play a major role in the supply of network infrastructure services. Recent<lb/> discussions show that WTO Members have different views in this regard and that even the definition of<lb/> different kinds of arrangements varies among countries. Some stress that the arrangements providing for a<lb/> contractee to sell commercial services to the public, rather than to sell such services to the government for<lb/> its own use, would not be covered by the definition of government procurement. However, this view is not<lb/> commonly agreed.<lb/> 146.<lb/> Cossy (2005) has provided some initial insight into the complex question of contractual<lb/> arrangements and government procurement of services. In the case of concession contracts, she argues that<lb/> for the most part they could not be considered a form of government procurement. This is because they<lb/> typically do not entail a purchase of service by the government and the service is not for the direct<lb/> consumption of the government but is supplied to consumers. For other forms of contracts such as<lb/> management contracts, the case for government procurement appears to be stronger, since the government<lb/> more clearly purchases and consumes the service for its own use. The state of BOT contracts remains to be<lb/> clarified, given that they combine elements of procurement (construction of a public facility) with<lb/> concessional regimes (granting of an exclusive right to provide a service to the public). This situation is<lb/> compounded by the fact that in practice contractual arrangements between a public authority and a private<lb/> supplier may combine different elements. In a few cases, however, WTO Members have scheduled specific<lb/> commitments on concessional arrangements, presumably as limitation on the conditions under which<lb/> foreign suppliers may participate in the market for the services concerned. This would imply a view that<lb/> such arrangements fall within the scope of existing disciplines.<lb/></p>

			<head>Implications of misinterpreting the scope of the GATS<lb/></head>

			<p>147.<lb/> These uncertainties have tended to cloud discussions on the impact of the GATS on network<lb/> infrastructure services, possibly affecting WTO Members&apos; decisions to schedule commitments in these<lb/> services. However, as pointed out by <ref type="biblio">Adlung (2005)</ref>, a key question that results from uncertainties on the<lb/> interpretation of the scope of GATS provisions, is the extent to which GATS obligations and commitments<lb/> could lead to a loss of policy control over the provision of these services. As seen earlier, if commitments<lb/> have not been made in a particular sector, only limited disciplines apply, the most important of which is the<lb/> MFN principle (provided that countries have not included the sector in question in their lists of MFN<lb/> exemptions). MFN treatment does not seem to impinge on governments&apos; ability to retain regulatory<lb/> controls over network infrastructure services, given that governments retain the right to exclude any<lb/> foreign participation in the services concerned.<lb/> 148.<lb/> Even if a country has made a commitment, Members retain a wide degree of flexibility and<lb/> latitude with respect to regulatory measures, although other more significant GATS obligations apply<lb/> especially in relation to market access and national treatment. While commitments involve different levels<lb/> of access depending on the limitations entered in the schedules, misinterpretation of GATS provisions may<lb/> in such case have important implications. As a last resort, if a country were to introduce new monopoly<lb/> rights in an area in which it had previously made commitments to competitive supply, it would be<lb/> necessary to follow the procedures on modification and withdrawal of commitments contained in GATS<lb/> Article XXI. This would entail the negotiation of commercial equivalent compensatory adjustments to the<lb/> schedule of commitments. If trading partners are not satisfied that such adjustments are made, they can<lb/> ultimately be authorised to take retaliatory measures of commercially equivalent effect.<lb/> 149.<lb/> Uncertainties could also arise with respect to national treatment commitments. It is unclear, for<lb/> example, whether national treatment would apply to certain types of treatment or privileges extended to<lb/> public facilities (e.g. postal administrations), in a manner that could require equal treatment of foreign<lb/> services and service suppliers supplying similar services. Such questions can arise with respect to financial<lb/> benefits such as subsidies or &quot;bail outs&quot;, discriminatory pricing controls, or preferences extended to the<lb/> services or suppliers concerned. As seen in Part I, subsidies and other incentives are frequently used to<lb/> meet universal access objectives in network infrastructure services. It is possible that where such<lb/> commitments are made these incentives may need to be offered on a non-discriminatory basis to all<lb/> suppliers (domestic and foreign) willing to contribute to universal service objectives.<lb/> 150.<lb/> Implications for commitments could also arise if in the future certain kinds of contractual<lb/> arrangements between the public and private sectors were interpreted as falling outside the scope of<lb/> government procurement. If relevant commitments are or were to be taken, a Member concerned would<lb/> need to grant foreigners the right to bid for contracts in the relevant sector and treat their offer like that of<lb/> other national suppliers. Although it is difficult to see how foreign providers would be less suited than their<lb/> domestic counterparts to meet the relevant sector objectives or to bid for contracts to provide service,<lb/> governments should be aware of unintended consequences.<lb/> 151.<lb/> Scheduling commitments on network infrastructure services thus raises a number of important<lb/> questions. At the same time, not committing may come at a cost. As seen earlier, GATS commitments in<lb/> these services could bring about gains in terms of increased investment via private sector participation and<lb/> wider availability of services, and thus can make a positive contribution to the fulfilment of the universal<lb/> service objectives laid out by many governments. Moreover, in competitive telecommunication<lb/> environments, for example, the concept of &quot;universal&quot; service has been nearly entirely delinked from the<lb/> notions of governmental or exclusive supply, such that competitive private sector market participants can<lb/> be assigned to assume these requirements consistently with GATS obligations or commitments.<lb/></p>

			<head>Limitations on network infrastructure services commitments<lb/></head>

			<p>152.<lb/> Pending a clarification of GATS provisions by the WTO membership, one option to avoid some<lb/> of these concerns and facilitate the assumption of GATS commitments may involve careful delineation of<lb/> the activities listed as open to competition and considerable thought given to relevant limitations to be<lb/> inscribed in network infrastructure services. As shown in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> below, WTO Members have wide<lb/> flexibility in this regard. It is possible to confine the scope of commitments to clearly defined and<lb/> circumscribed segments or activities of a sector, for example excluding public monopolies or confining<lb/> specific commitments to the private sector.<lb/> 153.<lb/> A great degree of flexibility with respect to scheduling can accommodate governments that so<lb/> wish to gradually move from monopoly service provision to the introduction of competition and private<lb/> sector participation. This includes the use of staged or phased-in commitments to end monopoly or<lb/> exclusive rights provision of certain of these services at a future date. WTO Members made extensive use<lb/> of phased-in commitments in the telecommunications sector during the Uruguay Round. 47 of the 105<lb/> Members that have made commitments on telecommunication services made use of such phase-ins, giving<lb/> them breathing room to institute the necessary legislative and regulatory frameworks for the introduction<lb/> of competition.<lb/> 154.<lb/> At the same time, it is important to recognise that the GATS cannot solve the issue of universal<lb/> access to network infrastructure services. It can only play a role in complementing policy decisions by<lb/> enhancing investor&apos;s confidence when countries decide to introduce competition and allow private sector<lb/> participation in these services. Domestic factors including the state and feature of the different sectors, and<lb/> the country&apos;s economic, social and political characteristics remain central. There are plenty of examples of<lb/> countries that have made full GATS commitments during the Uruguay Round which have had no impact<lb/> on their network infrastructure services.<lb/></p>

			<head>VII.<lb/> Additional disciplines on regulatory measures<lb/></head>

			<p>155.<lb/> Once commitments in a particular sector have been made, in addition to the market access and<lb/> national treatment obligations (subject to scheduled limitations), other disciplines apply. The most<lb/> significant of such disciplines relate to regulatory measures and are contained in Article VI, in particular<lb/> paragraphs 1 and 5. The question arises whether these disciplines can limit governments&apos; ability to regulate<lb/> network infrastructure services.<lb/> 156.<lb/> Article VI:1 requires Members to ensure that regulatory measures are &quot; administered in a<lb/> reasonable, objective and impartial manner &quot; . Article VI:5 aims at ensuring that licensing, qualification<lb/> requirements and technical standards are inter alia &quot; based on objective and transparent criteria &quot; (examples<lb/> given are competence and the ability to supply the service) and &quot; not more burdensome than necessary to<lb/> ensure the quality of the service &quot; . These criteria are based on Article VI.4, which provides for a negotiating<lb/> mandate to develop strengthened disciplines on these measures. The application of Article VI:5 is subject<lb/> to two limitations, that the measures in question nullify or impair specific commitments and could not<lb/> reasonably have been expected when commitments were made.<lb/> 157.<lb/> As noted by Adlung (2005), it is difficult to see how the provisions of Article VI:1 may impinge<lb/> on governments&apos; right to regulate given that they only relate to the &quot; administration &quot; of the measures and<lb/> not their substantive aspects. Article VI:5 may have a wider impact on regulatory capacity since as seen<lb/> above does contain substantive obligations. In this context, concerns have been raised about the fact that<lb/> the not more burdensome than necessary test of Article VI:4 is linked only to the quality of service (see<lb/> also <ref type="biblio">Trachtman, 2003</ref>). A narrow interpretation of the objective &quot; quality of service &quot; may leave out<lb/> measures relating to other important objectives seen in Part I. In practice, however, the effects of Article<lb/> VI:5 are likely to be limited given that its application is subject to the two limitations seen earlier. In<lb/> addition, current discussions under the Article VI:4 mandate show that any disciplines in this area will be<lb/> broad enough to accommodate a wide range of national objectives. In the Accountancy Disciplines 11 , the<lb/> one area where negotiations have been concluded under the mandate, the narrower quality objective has<lb/> been replaced with a broader set of objectives, including protection of consumers, the quality of service,<lb/> professional competence and the integrity of the profession.<lb/> 158.<lb/> It is also important to recall that even if a Member breaches its obligations under Article VI.5 (or<lb/> other GATS provisions such as the ones to be developed under the Article VI:4 mandate), its regulation<lb/> might still be permitted under the provisions of Article XIV on exceptions.<lb/></p>

			<head>The Reference Paper on Basic Telecommunications<lb/></head>

			<p>159.<lb/> Another important example of GATS disciplines and the scope for autonomous policy making in<lb/> network infrastructure services is the Reference Paper. The document is a tool for negotiating additional<lb/> commitments on basic telecommunication services under GATS Article XVIII (i.e. beyond those on<lb/> market access and national treatment). Unlike the Annex on Telecommunications, the Reference Paper<lb/> obtains legal status only to the extent that WTO Members have incorporated it in their schedules of<lb/> commitments.<lb/> 160.<lb/> The Reference Paper supplements other GATS disciplines, particularly the Annex on<lb/> Telecommunications and Article VIII of the GATS. Its objective is to ensure effective market access by<lb/> means of additional commitments to put in place a set of pro-competitive regulatory principles akin to<lb/> international best practice. As seen in Part I, ensuring the development of a genuinely competitive market<lb/> can be important because the particular characteristics of telecommunication services (and of other<lb/> network infrastructure services), make it unrealistic to change from monopoly to open, unregulated<lb/> markets, and expect the full benefits to be realised and sustained. Rather, a regulatory environment that<lb/> complements and supports the decision to permit competition is needed.<lb/> 161.<lb/> The Reference Paper, like the Annex on Telecommunications, represents a transfer of know-how<lb/> from countries with significant years of experience with reform of their telecommunication service sector<lb/> to other countries and has been used to promote policy reforms and FDI. It has also inspired considerable<lb/> debate on whether its elements can be transferred to other network services, such as postal/courier and<lb/> energy services. The argument is that, given the changing market structure and gradual opening of these<lb/> sectors to competition, regulatory authorities are likely to face issues that are similar to those encountered<lb/> in the liberalisation of the telecommunications sector. Attention, though, should be paid to the differences<lb/> between telecommunications and the other sectors, including with respect to the stronger difficulties<lb/> encountered in conducting liberalisation in the other sectors (as seen in Part I).<lb/> 162.<lb/> Specific competition-related disciplines in the Reference Paper include a requirement to prevent<lb/> major suppliers from engaging in anti-competitive cross-subsidisation and an obligation to establish an<lb/> independent regulator. At the same time, the Reference Paper, in line with the Preamble of the GATS,<lb/> recognises governments&apos; right to regulate the sector to ensure public policy objectives. A case in point is<lb/> universal service requirements; the Reference Paper explicitly confirms the right of Members to establish<lb/> these measures. Similarly, it allows considerable scope for each country on how to implement<lb/> liberalisation and regulatory reform. For example, the requirement for an independent regulator is without<lb/> prejudice as to whether the regulator should be separate from the ministry that makes telecommunication<lb/> policy or whether it should be a sector-specific regulator of telecommunication services or a regulator<lb/> operating under the general competition laws.<lb/></p>

			<head>CONCLUSION<lb/> 163</head>

			<p>.<lb/> The economic and social significance of network infrastructure services means that they are high<lb/> on the list of development priorities of many countries. Part II of the report suggests that, if appropriately<lb/> designed, bound liberalisation under the GATS can contribute to the advancement of these development<lb/> goals. By creating a more transparent and predictable legal framework, the GATS can contribute to<lb/> improve the investment climate and help attract FDI in these sectors. This can in turn provide needed<lb/> capital and technical and managerial expertise to build and expand the networks and services.<lb/> 164.<lb/> The WTO services agreement can place regulatory constraints on Member governments,<lb/> particularly when specific commitments are made. This is intensified by the fact that the GATS is a<lb/> relatively young agreement and some of its provisions remain to be tested in practice. At the same time, the<lb/> Agreement allows considerable scope through its flexibility to accommodate national policies. It is<lb/> therefore crucial to carefully examine its provisions and tailor specific commitments to national policy<lb/> objectives.<lb/> 165.<lb/> The liberalisation of network infrastructure services is no easy task and requires the<lb/> establishment of a strong regulatory framework. To achieve public policy objectives and ensure<lb/> competition in the new environment, new regulatory instruments and approaches are required, which need<lb/> to be adapted to the specificities of different sectors and countries. This is shown in the range of positive as<lb/> well as problem-ridden examples provided in Part I of the study of national experience in liberalising<lb/> network infrastructure services. Sound regulation and effective institutions are thus needed to ensure a<lb/> positive and sustainable outcome from the current round of GATS negotiations.</p>
