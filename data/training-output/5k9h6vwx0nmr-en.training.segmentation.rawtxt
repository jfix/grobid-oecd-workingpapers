3 METHODOLOGICAL NOTE This paper aims at providing an estimate of the resource envelope required in order to 
achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) on the global level. As widely 
acknowledged by previous contributors to this literature, modelling the cost of achieving the 
MDGs poses many data and methodological challenges. Like previous contributions, this paper relies on a very simple growth model to relate 
development financing — private or public — to growth in order to estimate how much it would 
cost to halve poverty across developing countries. The virtue of this model is precisely its 
simplicity but the trade-off is that it does not claim to take account of the effects of increases in 
development financing, tax revenues, public expenditure and transfers on the general 
equilibrium of the economy to which it is applied. For instance, increasing the supply of 
schooling does not necessarily guarantee that it will be met with an equivalent increase in the 
demand for education. The model used in this paper simply provides orders of magnitude that 
are helpful to size up the challenges that meeting MDGs entails for low-and middle-income 
countries. Similarly, when measuring the amount of transfers or government expenditure that it 
would take to achieve the poverty, education and health MDGs across countries, this paper 
acknowledges that the link between inputs and outcomes is often weak and that absorption and 
delivery issues can represent significant challenges in developing countries. From this 
perspective, the orders of magnitude presented cannot be taken to be precise estimates, 
especially at the country level, of how much public expenditure would be needed to increase in 
order to achieve specific MDGs. The importance of framing the corresponding debate in the 
larger framework of the quality of public policy and institutions is, indeed, a key take-away from 
the MDG costing exercise undertaken in this paper. Revisiting MDG Cost Estimates from a Domestic Resource Mobilisation Perspective DEV/DOC(2011)14 4 
© OECD 2011 NOTE MÉTHODOLOGIQUE Le présent document vise à fournir une estimation de l'enveloppe de ressources qui serait 
nécessaire pour atteindre au niveau mondial les Objectifs du Millénaire pour le développement 
(OMDs). Comme il a été largement reconnu par les contributions précédentes à cette littérature, 
la modélisation du coût de la réalisation des OMDs implique des défis relatifs à la méthodologie 
et aux données. Comme les contributions antérieures, cet article s'appuie sur un modèle de 
croissance très simple pour lier le financement du développement — privé ou public — à la 
croissance afin d'estimer quel serait le coût d'une réduction de moitié de la pauvreté dans les 
pays en voie de développement. Ce modèle a précisément pour vertu sa simplicité mais la 
contrepartie est qu'il n'a pas la prétention de tenir compte des effets de l'augmentation du 
financement du développement, des recettes fiscales, des dépenses et des transferts publiques 
sur l'équilibre général de l'économie à laquelle il est appliqué. Par exemple, un accroissement de 
l'offre de la scolarité ne garantit pas nécessairement qu'il soit rejoint par une augmentation 
équivalente de la demande d'éducation. Le modèle sur lequel ce document se repose génère des 
ordres de grandeur qui sont utiles pour évaluer la taille du défi que représente 
l'accomplissement des OMDs pour les pays à bas et moyens revenus. De même, dans le cadre de la mesure du montant des transferts ou des dépenses 
gouvernementales nécessaires pour atteindre les OMDs relatifs à la pauvreté, l'éducation et la 
santé, ce document reconnaît que le lien entre les intrants et les résultats est souvent faible et que 
la capacité d'absorption et l'efficacité des services publiques peuvent représenter des défis 
importants dans les pays en voie de développement. Dans cette perspective, les ordres de 
grandeur présentés ne peuvent être considérés comme des estimations précises, en particulier au 
niveau des pays, du montant dont les dépenses publiques devaient croître pour atteindre des 
OMDs spécifiques. L'importance de recadrer le débat correspondant dans le contexte plus large 
de la qualité des institutions et des politiques publiques est, précisément, une des conclusions 
tirées du présent exercice de mesures des coûts des OMDs entrepris dans ce document. OECD Development Centre Working Paper No.306 DEV/DOC(2011)14 © OECD 2011

7 PREFACE Almost ten years after the Monterrey Conference, financing development remains a major 
challenge on the international agenda. The landscape of development finance has evolved, with 
the emergence of new actors and sources of financing. In parallel, efforts have been made to 
improve the efficiency of the international financing architecture. The conclusions of the Fourth 
High Level Forum on Aid Effectiveness point to the need to broaden attention beyond aid 
effectiveness to the challenges of effective development. This has called for the establishment of a 
new, inclusive and representative Global Partnership for Effective Development Co-operation. Assessing the magnitude of the remaining financing challenges is paramount to support 
the advancement of the international development debate, including the achievement of the 
Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Surprisingly, few estimates or projections on MDG 
costs have been prepared for all developing countries. This paper fills this void by providing 
fresh orders of magnitude about the cost of reaching the MDGs by 2015. It goes on further to 
argue that the scale of financing needed to achieve the MDGs requires that development finance 
looks beyond official development assistance as its principal resource. As the economic crisis weighs on public budgets in OECD donor countries, the challenge 
of meeting the MDGs at the global level is shown in this paper to be unaffordable using official 
development assistance alone. In fact, improved domestic tax collection continues to make a 
growing contribution to the financing of development in all developing countries. This paper 
however shows that in many low-income countries, domestic taxes still cannot be expected to 
help to meet the MDGs in the foreseeable future. Raising additional revenue takes time in low-
income countries and it requires a determined effort to strengthen institutional capacity. Making 
sure that these new resources do help to meet the MDGs will require an additional political 
effort. Indeed, the poor quality of public expenditure remains a major hurdle for developing 
countries to meet the aspirations of their citizens. Achieving the MDGs therefore requires many conditions besides financing. It requires 
good institutions to design, implement and evaluate policies, notably in the form of strong public 
expenditure management at and across all levels of government, good implementation capacity, 
and a medium-term fiscal policy that ensures the sustainability of the MDGs. Effective public 
expenditures and the nexus between revenues and expenditures are at the core of the OECD's 
work and will feature prominently in the Global Forum on Development 2012. Revisiting MDG Cost Estimates from a Domestic Resource Mobilisation Perspective DEV/DOC(2011)14 8

9 RÉSUMÉ Ce document présente une nouvelle estimation du montant des ressources financières 
nécessaires aux pays en voie de développement pour atteindre les Objectifs du Millénaire pour le 
développement (OMDs). Les approches utilisées jusqu'à présent mettent trop souvent l'accent 
sur l'aide publique au développement (APD) et négligent le potentiel des autres sources de 
financement, comme les recettes fiscales nationales ou les flux de capitaux privés. Le document 
fournit une estimation du besoin de financement additionnel pour atteindre les OMDs en 
matière de pauvreté, d'éducation et de santé; il estime également le montant qui pourrait être 
couvert par un accroissement des revenus fiscaux des pays en voie de développement. Au 
niveau mondial, en moyenne, le potentiel représenté par une amélioration de la collecte fiscale 
correspond au montant des ressources supplémentaires nécessaires pour atteindre les OMDs. 
Pour beaucoup de pays pris individuellement, toutefois, d'importantes ressources externes 
seront encore nécessaires. La communauté internationale peut jouer un rôle important en 
élargissant sa notion de coopération au-delà de la mobilisation de l'aide publique au 
développement officielle afin d'assurer les ressources nécessaires pour ce financement 
supplémentaire. Classification JEL: I15, I25, I32, F35, O19. Mots clés: Objectifs Millénaires du Développement, Financement du Développement,

© OECD 2011 ABSTRACT This paper revisits global costing estimates of the size of additional financial resources 
needed in developing countries in order to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). 
It argues that earlier approaches to calculating the cost of financing the MDGs focus narrowly on 
aid as the principal source of additional resources for MDG achievement without paying 
adequate attention to the scope for other resources to contribute to MDG achievement, such as 
domestic tax revenues or private capital flows. The approximate additional cost of achieving the 
poverty, education, and health Millennium Development Goals are calculated and an estimate of 
the scope for increased tax revenues in developing countries is provided. Although at the global 
level the magnitude of potential additional resources available from improved tax collection is 
similar to that of the additional resources needed to achieve the goals, on a country by country 
basis substantial external resources will still be needed. The paper suggests the international 
community needs to broaden its notion of development co-operation beyond official 
development assistance in order to secure sources for this additional finance. JEL Classification: F35, H20, H50, I15, I25, I32, O19 Keywords: Millennium Development Goals, Development Finance, Poverty reduction,

11 I. INTRODUCTION An ancient parable describes the blind men who encounter an elephant and take turns 
describing it based on the part of the animal's body that they touch. Touching the smooth, sharp 
tusk, one describes the elephant like a spear. Holding the squirming trunk, another describes the 
elephant like a snake. Feeling the elephant's sturdy knee, still another describes the elephant like 
a tree. This parable shows that we can look at the same thing from many different directions, 
with each view offering an element of truth. However, we only grasp the full complexity of what 
we are trying to understand when we take all perspectives together. Understanding 
development success and how to achieve it holds a similar challenge. Development economists 
are like the blind men examining the elephant, often only narrowly seeing one part of a bigger, 
more complex picture. Few development issues exemplify this point more than the longstanding 
debate over the costs of achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). We are approaching the 2015 deadline for achieving the MDGs in a vastly different global 
economic and political climate than that in which the goals were initially formulated in 2000. In 
the late 1990s, many developing countries had experienced shaky economic transitions from 
socialist planning, debilitating financial crises, and in a number of cases both. Official 
development assistance (ODA) budgets had shrunk since the end of the Cold War, and many 
rich countries had reduced their engagement in the developing world. The MDGs proved 
extremely useful at refocusing the development community on measurable, achievable and time-
bound goals. In particular, this invigorated the development co-operation efforts of OECD 
countries that are members of the Development Assistance Committee (DAC) and re-ignited 
their engagement in partner countries. After a decade of declining aid budgets during the 1990s, 
the MDGs helped to galvanise the international aid community to dedicate an increased amount 
of resources to development co-operation in the 2000s. More than a decade later, the nature of development co-operation has changed. This 
change is due to the emergence of new poles of growth in the developing world as well as 
recession and increasing calls for fiscal austerity in rich countries. Partly out of necessity, sources 
for financing development have diversified and include rapidly growing South-South aid, trade 
and investment flows. Although aid and development co-operation still play an important, 
catalytic role, there is a general recognition that aid alone cannot reduce poverty and foster 
development. A number of countries have also increased their capacity to collect tax revenue and 
mobilise other domestic resources as forms of development finance. Tax revenues are already 
10 times larger than ODA on the African continent even though this average hides considerable 
country-to-country differences (AfDB, OECD and UNECA, 2010). Revisiting MDG Cost Estimates from a Domestic Resource Mobilisation Perspective DEV/DOC(2011)14 12 
© OECD 2011 In this new context, it is timely to revisit the costing estimates that many development 
agencies contributed to during the early 2000s. A fresh perspective on countries' capacity to fund 
additional development investment on their own is needed. The purpose of this paper is to offer 
an assessment of the orders of magnitude of resources needed to achieve the MDGs in the 
developing world as a whole and compare this level with the degree of financial resources 
available, domestic and external. While this paper offers a specific figure for how much 
achieving the MDGs could cost, the aim is not to propose that the international community 
scramble to meet this cost. Rather, these estimates should be used for understanding the size of 
the problem that continues to face many countries. Although it is not an insurmountably high 
amount, it is of an order of magnitude larger than the size of resources that could be raised from 
development co-operation alone. The estimates presented in this paper show that achieving the first six MDGs 1 Table 1: Summary Results of MDG Cost Estimates (2009 USD billion) globally 
requires approximately USD 120 billion in additional annual expenditures on health, education 
and poverty reduction worldwide. This is roughly twice the size of the potential increase in tax 
revenues obtainable from improved tax collection efforts in developing countries. It is also 
comparable to the size of current (net country-programmable) ODA flows. Approximately half of 
the needed expenditures is in low-income countries, while the other half is needed in middle-
income countries. While middle-income countries are much more likely to afford these 
additional expenditures themselves, the needs in low-income countries are concentrated in a 
small group of countries that currently receive only about a quarter of ODA flows. Increased tax 
revenue collection in middle-income countries is one way in which the (re)allocation of ODA 
towards low-income countries that need it the most can be further advanced.  " Financing gap "  Service provision

This paper only considers MDGs 1-6. Environmental sustainability (MDG 7) and partnership for 
development (MDG 8) are explicitly excluded, as these goals necessitate substantial contributions by 
developed countries, while the first six could be conceivably achieved solely by developing countries 
themselves. This paper divides the six remaining MDGs into three broad categories, looking at income 
poverty (MDG 1), health (MDGs 4, 5, 6) and education (MDGs 2, 3). Gender equality is thus treated 
narrowly as an education issue because one of MDG 3's key targets is gender equality in primary 
education enrolment. This is admittedly unsatisfactory for a number of reasons, but is considered 
necessary to maintain a sufficiently generalisable approach. OECD Development Centre Working Paper No.306 DEV/DOC(2011)14 © OECD 2011 
13 The USD 120 billion estimate is based on rough calculations (summarised in Table 1) that 
a USD 62.1 billion  " financing gap "  should be filled in 20 low-income countries, while 
USD 59.2 billion in expenditures on developmental services provision should be made in 79 
other low-and middle-income countries 2 The rest of this paper looks at how these estimates were obtained and what type of 
caution needs to be exhibited when using these figures. Section II places these calculations in the 
context of past efforts to measure MDG costs and the availability of domestic resources. 
Section III presents the methods used to calculate the costs of financing poverty reduction, health 
and education, as well as to calculate the scope for increasing domestic resources through 
increased tax revenues. Section IV documents the results of these calculations. Section V 
concludes. . Separately, calculations show that some USD 64 billion 
in additional tax revenues could be collected through improved tax effort, primarily in middle-
income countries. Unfortunately, however, the bulk of these additional resources would be 
raised in countries that are already on track for achieving the MDGs. 2. 
For the purposes of this paper missing baseline data from the early 1990s and missing data from the late 
2000s are extrapolated from either trends in GDP per capita growth, or in expenditure growth, where 
possible. This permits the estimation of the additional cost of MDG achievement needed in 99 countries. 
While these simplifying assumptions are not ideal, they are sufficient for the purpose of estimating 
broad orders of magnitude. These simplifying assumptions have been adopted to ensure the broadest 
number of countries, particularly low-income fragile states, are included in the estimates in this paper, 
as the aim is to compare a broad estimate of the magnitude of resources needed to achieve the MDGs 
with a broad estimate of the magnitude of extra budgetary and non-budgetary resources available to 
meet the goals. Revisiting MDG Cost Estimates from a Domestic Resource Mobilisation Perspective DEV/DOC(2011)14 14 
© OECD 2011 II. PUTTING MDG COSTING AND DEVELOPMENT FINANCE 
INTO CONTEXT The most recent Global Monitoring Report (World Bank and IMF, 2011) shows that the 
world is on track to reduce by half the number of people living on less than a dollar a day. 
However, progress is uneven country-to-country as 17 countries in Africa are far from halving 
extreme poverty. The world is also close but still has progress to make to achieve gender parity 
in primary and secondary education, provide access to safe drinking water and ensure primary 
education completion. At the same time it is clear that global progress is too slow on child and 
maternal mortality. There still exists a need to increase efforts to improve MDG progress, and in 
many cases increased financial resources are an important ingredient of this improved progress. 
MDG cost estimates have been instrumental in quantifying the need for increased resources to 
improve progress over the past decade, despite drawbacks and caveats with many costing 
methods. This section looks briefly at past efforts to estimate the cost of MDG achievement and the 
criticisms that many of these cost estimates have faced. It shows that one of the main drawbacks 
of earlier cost estimates was their implicit assumption that increased spending for MDG 
achievement necessarily need come from increased aid flows. Finally, it shows that a separate 
literature on the role of domestic resource mobilisation in development finance demonstrates 
that countries' potential for financing their own development is increasing.  " Tax effort "  is 
presented as one way to measure the degree to which countries are adequately mobilising the 
potential of domestic resources available. II.1. Past Efforts to Estimate the Cost of the MDGs Numerous articles and reports since the early 2000s have attempted to quantify the cost of 
achieving the MDGs. A chief objective of many of these previous MDG costing exercises was to 
argue for scaled-up development co-operation efforts by DAC member countries to help 
development partners finance the achievement of their own MDG targets. While this paper 
argues that the narrow objective of scaling-up development co-operation efforts is of limited 
usefulness, particularly given the financing constraints facing many DAC member countries, it 
nonetheless tries to emulate the most reasonable lessons of the approaches of past MDG costing 
exercises. OECD Development Centre Working Paper No.306 DEV/DOC(2011)14 © OECD 2011

USD 28 billion of USD 65 billion in 
ODA in 2002 went to MDGs based 
on four case studies of individual 
countries. As Table 2 shows, the order of magnitude of past estimates is comparable to the estimates 
of the current paper (once converted to 2009 USD). The 2001 Report of the High-Level Panel on 
Financing for Development, chaired by former Mexican president Ernesto Zedillo, gave a broad 
estimate that a USD 50 billion increase in annual ODA flows was needed to achieve the goals 
(United Nations, 2001). Devarajan et al. (2002) from the World Bank offered two separate 
calculations that arrived at figures of roughly the same size, finding it would take a 
USD 54 million to USD 62 million increase in ODA to achieve the poverty reduction goal, MDG1, 
or a USD 35 billion to USD 72 billion increase to achieve the education, health and environmental 
goals. They argued that these separate calculations could not be added up since reducing 
poverty would go a long way towards improving health and education, and improving health 
and education would also directly impact reducing income poverty. The 2005 report from the 
Millennium Project chaired by Jeffrey Sachs proposed gradually increasing ODA by 
USD 70 billion to USD 130 billion per year so that USD 189 billion in development co-operation 
efforts was going towards MDG achievement by 2015. Previous MDG cost estimates have faced criticism from a wide circle of observers, 
including from some of those who were involved in the calculations themselves. Devarajan et al. 
(2002) strictly cautioned that extreme care be used interpreting their own MDG cost estimates, 
and that monetary inputs are not the only, and certainly not the most important, constraint 
limiting MDG achievement. Reddy and Heuty (2005, 2006, 2008) also identified a series of 
problems with the literature on costing the MDGs, including the lack of a consistent cost concept, Revisiting MDG Cost Estimates from a Domestic Resource Mobilisation Perspective DEV/DOC(2011)14 16 
© OECD 2011 the absence of considerations about economies of scale in MDG achievement 3 A common thread tying together many previous global MDG costing exercises is the 
assumption that the main reason to quantify the cost of achieving the MDGs is to convince 
donors to scale-up aid flows to developing countries. Clemens et al. (2007) pointed out that policy 
proposals derived from previous costing estimates systematically misinterpret the simple and 
approximate methods of global costing exercises when they argue for scaled-up aid flows. 
Arguments to scale-up aid in response to the cost estimates rely heavily on unjustified 
assumptions that improved policy environments, which alleviate aid effectiveness bottlenecks, 
will be forthcoming and that constraints on absorptive capacity can be overcome easily. Easterly 
(2006a, 2006b) also criticizes the assumption that increased foreign aid will lead to growth by 
pointing out that arguments for scaled-up aid rely principally on outdated theories on the 
relationship between aid and growth. , and the lack of 
robustness of estimates to the choice of assumptions. Other critics pointed out that MDG costing 
misses the point of the MDGs themselves. For example, even one of the chief architects of the 
MDGs, Jan Vandemoortele, former head of the poverty group at UNDP, pointed out that the 
only correct answer to the question of how much will the MDGs cost is  " more "  (Vandemoortele 
and Roy, 2005). Another criticism of MDG cost estimates is the difficulty in assessing "joint production" of 
the goals. Devarajan et al. (2002) recognised this by providing two separate measures of the cost 
of achieving the MDGs, which they urged should not be combined so as to avoid  " double-
counting. "  Their first calculation measures only the resources needed to achieve the poverty 
reduction goal of halving poverty. This calculation assumes that poverty reduction achieved by 
increased growth sufficiently increases the demand and supply of health and education services 
to ensure the achievement of the health, education and environmental-related goals, as well. 
Devarajan et al. (2002) second calculation focused instead on the individual costs of achieving the 
health, education and environmental costs separately. It then assumed that improving these 
human development indicators has a consequent impact on incomes, thus ensuring the 
achievement of the income poverty goal. More recent studies have explicitly modelled the joint production of the goals at the 
country level. For instance, the World Bank's MAMS model provides a general equilibrium 
framework for countries to simulate the effect of improvements in one MDG on progress in 
others (Bourguignon et al., 2008). While this approach may be much more satisfying for 
modelling MDG costing, it is impossible to scale to the global level. It is also unrealistic in a 
number of countries because of the large amount of country-specific data needed. Thus, for the 
purposes of the present paper, the approach used by Devarajan et al. (2002) is followed and two 3. 
Given the data limitations associated with trying to estimate the cost of MDG achievement of the global 
level, many of the calculations in this paper (particularly those that are health and education 
expenditure related) rely primarily on linear trend models. However, Annex 3 explores the possibility 
that costs may change over time relative to countries' levels of development. While this type of analysis 
is preferred for country-level cost estimates, the calculations in Annex 3 indicate that cost differences 
between countries at the aggregate level may cancel each other out, indicating that for the purposes of 
this paper, linear extrapolation methods are acceptable. OECD Development Centre Working Paper No.306 DEV/DOC(2011)14 © OECD 2011 
17 separate calculations are considered – one based on poverty reduction through growth, the other 
based on the delivery of a number of developmental services 4 II.2. Mobilising Domestic Resources for Development . Double counting is avoided by 
concentrating on one set of calculations for low-income countries, and another set for middle-
income countries; the rationale behind this approach is explained below. The Monterrey Consensus (United Nations, 2003) recognises both the need for 
developing countries to take responsibility for their own poverty reduction and for their partners 
to support this endeavour with more open trade, aid and domestic policies that are coherent 
with their international development aims. The Consensus underlines the importance for 
development of tax, international investment, financial markets and private sector development, 
aid, remittances, trade and debt. Crucially, the Monterrey consensus highlights mobilising 
domestic financial resources as a critical action supporting the achievement of the Millennium 
Development Goals. While MDG costing exercises in the past may have placed the emphasis on aid as 
financing for development, domestic resource mobilisation — i.e. taxes and domestic savings — 
remains the primary source of sustainable MDG financing. Developing countries have made 
some progress in improving tax collection in the past decade, yet half of sub-Saharan African 
countries mobilise less than 17% of their GDP in tax revenues, below the minimum level 
considered by the UN as necessary to achieve the MDGs. Several Asian and Latin American 
countries exhibit even lower collection rates, in all tax categories. Moreover, in Africa, the 
increase has been primarily driven by resource-related tax revenues in oil-producing countries. 
Crisis-induced domestic revenue reductions threaten USD 12 billion of core public spending in 
the poorest countries. In terms of external resources, foreign direct investment (FDI) to developing countries 
dominates in volume terms (USD 670 billion in 2010). Yet FDI and other capital inflows to 
developing countries dropped by more than 50% in 2008 and are only slowly recovering. 
Remittances (USD 325 billion in 2010), funds from foundations and climate change financing are 
increasingly important, as are innovative sources of financing (such as the hotly debated taxes on 
currency transactions, international air transport or carbon emissions as well as new actors such 
as sovereign wealth funds and private equity). Although 2009 saw record levels of ODA from 
OECD countries (USD 120 billion) and aid from non-OECD countries (USD 11 billion), aid is a 
decreasing share of the overall financing for development picture. Bilateral aid comprises 60-70% 
of total aid and is concentrated on poor countries, with least developed countries receiving four 
times as much per capita as other recipients. Education, health, water and other social sectors 
absorb nearly 40% of bilateral aid. Multilateral organisations, global programmes and funds 
together contribute 30-40% of all aid. 4. 
Other factors indeed influence the trajectory of poverty in individual countries, such as for example 
food prices. However, for the back of the envelope calculations envisioned in this paper these impacts 
are assumed to be accounted for by the real GDP per capita growth and projections that are used to 
update the relevant poverty, education, or health expenditure figures. Revisiting MDG Cost Estimates from a Domestic Resource Mobilisation Perspective DEV/DOC(2011)14 18 
© OECD 2011 Tax revenues have been rising across the developing world over the last decade. The 
average tax ratio has been increasing in Africa, arguably the most critical region to MDG 
achievement, since the beginning of the 1990s. The tax ratio is defined as the total of all collected 
taxes expressed as share of Gross Domestic Product (GDP). This ratio is important because it tells 
how much tax revenue is available to a country's government, taking into account the size of the 
country's economy. The increase in the average tax ratio across Africa implies that many of the 
continent's economies have made noticeable progress in collecting taxes over the last two 
decades. Figure 1 plots the evolution of (un-weighted) average of tax shares on the African 
continent as a whole and its breakdown into different income categories. The 2010 African 
Economic Outlook (AfDB, OECD and UNECA, 2010) observed that an increase in revenue 
collected on resource extraction activities in some countries has largely driven the observed 
increase in the average tax share. Figure 1: Average African Tax Share Source: AfDB, OECD and UNECA (2010). Classifying African countries according to their level of income shows three different 
trends in tax ratios. The tax share of upper-middle-income countries is slowly converging with 
the tax share of OECD countries, to nearly 35%. Lower-middle income countries have a tax share 
comparable to other countries from other continents in the same income category, over 25% at 
pre-crisis levels. Low-income countries have a much lower ratio, below 20%. Taxes per capita correspond to the total of all collected taxes divided by the number of 
inhabitants. In general, taxes per capita have been increasing in Africa throughout the last two 
decades, although in low-income countries (LICs) the increase has been modest. Taxes per capita 
provide an intuitive measure of the amount of tax revenue available on average to the 
government for each inhabitant. In other words, it is the amount of tax money available for the 
government to spend on everything ranging from building roads to providing public education 
on average for each inhabitant. OECD Development Centre Working Paper No.306 DEV/DOC(2011)14 © OECD 2011 
19 Figure 2: Taxes per capita 1996-2009 Source: AfDB, OECD and UNECA (2010). Large differences remain across African countries in the levels of tax revenues per capita. 
In 2009 countries such as Burundi, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia and Guinea 
Bissau collected taxes per capita as low as USD 35 per inhabitant. It is noteworthy that albeit 
remaining very low, this amount has been rising steadily. However, it is difficult to envision any 
sort of consequential public service delivery with an annual public budget corresponding to an 
average of USD 35 for each inhabitant. At the other end of the spectrum, in countries such as 
Equatorial Guinea, Libya and the Seychelles, taxes reach over USD 3 000 per inhabitant. In 2008 
Equatorial Guinea collected as much as USD 5 317 per inhabitant. In 2009 this amount had 
dropped back to USD 3 806. Figure 3: Absolute Resource Taxes Source: AfDB, OECD and UNECA (2010). Revisiting MDG Cost Estimates from a Domestic Resource Mobilisation Perspective DEV/DOC(2011)14 20 
© OECD 2011 As highlighted by AfDB, OECD and UNECA (2010), the fiscal performance of the middle-
income African countries is highly linked to the international prices of natural resources. The 
effect of fluctuating resource prices since 2008 and onwards throughout the crisis can be seen in 
Figure 3, which shows the fiscal revenue from resource taxes. The degree to which these domestic resources can be scaled-up can be broadly estimated 
given some general assumptions. It has been well documented, including by the African Economic 
Outlook (AfDB, OECD and UNECA, 2010) and the Perspective on Global Development 2012 (OECD, 
2011) that there is increasing scope for mobilising domestic resources in developing countries. 
The next section, following a summary of the methods used to calculate the aggregate costs for 
achieving the MDGs, describes tax effort calculations (Piancastelli, 2001; Bird et al., 2004 and 
2008). The section also discusses how these calculations can be used to make reasonable 
estimates for the scope of scaling-up tax revenues in developing countries in order to increase 
domestic resources available for MDG financing. OECD Development Centre Working Paper No.306 DEV/DOC(2011)14 © OECD 2011 
21 III. METHODS FOR COSTING MDG ACHIEVEMENT 
AND MEASURING DOMESTIC RESOURCES This section examines three types of calculations on which this paper rests. The section 
first looks at the  " financing gap "  calculation, which is used to calculate the amount of additional 
capital an economy needs to maintain a target growth rate. This target growth rate will be shown 
to differ for each country according to the amount of growth in per capita income or 
consumption that will be needed to halve the number of people living on a dollar a day, 
assuming distribution-neutral growth. As shown in the previous section and as pointed out by Devarajan et al. (2002), the 
 " financing gap "  calculation should not be aggregated with other calculations of health and 
education costs to avoid  " double counting "  due to the possible  " joint production "  of MDG 
achievement. Unlike Devarajan et al. (2002), however, this paper considers an alternative poverty 
gap-based estimate of the cost for achieving MDG 1 which, this paper argues, can be aggregated 
with the health and education cost estimates. This alternative measure will be shown to be 
equivalent to a cash transfer that aims to provide enough income support to halve the number of 
people living on less than a dollar a-day by 2015. In this way, like Devarajan et al. (2002), this 
paper offers two separate approaches for calculating the cost of MDG achievement. This section thus looks secondly at how to estimate the cost of MDG achievement through 
scaling-up service delivery in order to avoid the  " double counting "  issue highlighted in the 
previous section. The cost of MDG achievement is the sum of estimates of the  " poverty gap "  to 
measure the cash transfer needed to achieve MDG 1, of estimates of education expenditures 
needed to achieve MDGs 2 and 3 and of estimates of health expenditures needed to achieve 
MDGs 4, 5, and 6. Finally, this section explores how estimates of tax effort can be used to 
calculate how much government revenues could be increased through improved tax collection to 
meet the needs identified by the MDG cost estimates. III.1. Overcoming the Limits of the  " Financing Gap "  MDG 1 is expected to be met because the Millennium Declaration posed the MDGs as 
global goals, not individual country goals. Thanks in large part to strong growth in China, world 
poverty will be halved by 2015. However, if the MDGs are monitored at the country level, the 
simplest way to disaggregate responsibility for achieving the global goal is by expecting each 
country to halve their own poverty headcount themselves. From this point of view, a number of 
countries will still be lagging behind on MDG 1 by 2015. To estimate the amount of additional 
resources needed by 2015 to achieve a poverty headcount ratio that is half of 1990 levels, this Revisiting MDG Cost Estimates from a Domestic Resource Mobilisation Perspective DEV/DOC(2011)14 22 
© OECD 2011 paper relies on two very different approaches. This first section looks at the  " financing gap "  
calculation that has underpinned many of the previous MDG calculations. The  " financing gap "  refers to the difference between the investment requirements an 
economy needs to achieve a targeted growth rate and the actual investment resources available 
through domestic or external sources of financing. The gap itself is calculated using a simple 
Harrod-Domar growth model that defines a mechanistic relationship between capital and 
growth. Many of the criticisms of previous MDG estimates cite drawbacks in the Harrod-Domar 
growth model and in particular in its later variation, the  " two-gap "  growth model, formulated 
by Chenery and Strout (1966). The workhorse model of early development economics, developed by Harrod (1939) and 
Domar (1946) and used for much of the post-war period, permits calculating the amount of 
additional resources an economy needs to obtain a specified target growth rate given savings 
rates and a fixed capital-output ratio. The approach gained appeal in the immediate post-war 
period as a useful way to study temporary shortages of capital, such as that experienced by 
Europe during its reconstruction under the Marshall Plan. As a way of quantifying the amount of 
capital needed to generate growth, the Harrod-Domar model helped quantify not only the costs 
of European reconstruction, but also the investments needed to stimulate growth under socialist 
five-year plans, such as those prepared by China, India and the Soviet Union. An appealing feature of the Harrod-Domar model was its compatibility with the notion 
that capital accumulation was a precondition for a country's  " take-off "  into economic 
development, such as Rostow (1956, 1959) theorised. This  " take-off "  can be delivered as a  " big 
push "  of externally financed investment needed to spark industrialisation, as envisioned by 
Rosenstein-Rodan (1943, 1961). The intuition that capital accumulation was a key constraint to 
economic development conveniently lent itself to models justifying foreign aid. In the early post-
war period, the principal justification for foreign aid to developing countries relied on the belief 
that aid could raise a country's growth rate to a level sufficiently high to ensure Rostow's  " take-
off "  in order to push the country out of a poverty trap and propel it into a pattern of self-
sustaining growth. Chenery and Strout (1966) thus re-formulated the Harrod-Domar model as 
the  " two-gap "  model, explicitly in terms of two types of financing gap, a  " savings-investment 
gap "  and a  " trade gap, "  measuring the ability of countries to maintain target growth rates given 
their savings rates and their trade balances. Importantly, these gaps were theorised to be filled by 
foreign aid (Chenery and Strout, 1966). The main problem with using financing gap models to cost the MDGs is not the models 
themselves but the assumption that the gap should be filled by aid alone. For instance, reflecting 
on some of the criticism of earlier studies that argue aid should be scaled-up, Guillaumont and 
Guillaumont-Jeanneney (2007) pointedly observed:  " The main argument for doubling aid is not 
simply to fill a financial gap, but to push countries out of the stagnation trap which will be 
impossible to escape otherwise. [...] The criticism then is an attack against the idea of a trap and 
its big push corollary. "  The assumption that a  " big push "  of aid stimulates growth in a 
mechanistic way is problematic and has been cited as a limitation of the previous MDG costing 
exercises detailed in Section II. For instance, Easterly (2006a, 2006b) pointed out that this  " big 
push "  theory ignores a number of issues that are crucial to making aid effective, such as 
institutional quality and absorptive capacity. With regard to this critique, Guillaumont and OECD Development Centre Working Paper No.306 DEV/DOC(2011)14 © OECD 2011 
23 Guillaumont-Jeanneney (2007) noted,  " Other critical opinions or reservations – mostly with 
regard to the notion of absorptive capacity – are intended to highlight all the reasons why 
increased aid is likely to be useless, wasted or even harmful. "  In other words, the criticism is 
aimed not at the financing gap model itself, but rather at the extension that it should be filled by 
aid. Criticisms notwithstanding, it is possible to shed the assumption that the big push should 
come from aid alone and still harvest the financing gap calculations based on a Harrod-Domar 
model as a useful construct. This is particularly true if the purpose is to obtain an approximate 
size of resources – whether domestic or external in origin – that would be needed to achieve a 
target growth rate. Importantly, the financing gap calculations themselves do not have to 
distinguish whether additional resources come from either aid increases or from elsewhere. In 
fact, the simplicity of the model used in this paper may be its strength: the only determinant of 
how investment resources are turned into growth in this model is the mechanistic relationship 
between capital and output, labelled θ, the incremental capital output ratio. For the purposes of 
this paper, this ratio is determined by how much investment has led to growth in output over the 
period since 1990. Hence, it varies greatly between different countries, and it is loosely related to 
the effectiveness of policies and institutions, including the business climate, and the historical 
experiences of each of the countries under consideration. To determine the target growth rate that will be used for this paper's calculations, the first 
step consists of estimating how much consumption or income growth will be needed to raise 
average incomes high enough to halve poverty by 2015. It is therefore assumed that inequality 
stays constant over the period, and the most recent distributional parameters can be used. These 
parameters define the points along each country's Lorenz curve. Methods developed by Datt 
(1998) can be applied to determine how much growth in mean incomes or consumption 
contributes to poverty reduction. Once the target growth rate needed to achieve the poverty 
reduction target is obtained, it can be plugged into a simple Harrod-Domar model that then 
determines the amount of resources needed to achieve the target growth rate, y, as a function of 
the following variables: 
í µí±¦ í µí±¡í µí±í µí±í µí±í µí±í µí±¡ = í µí±(í µí± í µí±í µí±£í µí±í µí±í µí±í µí± , í µí¼, í µí°¹í µí°·í µí°¼, í µí±í µí±í µí±, í µí±í µí±í µí±í µí±í µí±¡í µí±í µí±í µí±í µí±í µí± í µí±í µí±í µí± í µí±í µí±¢í µí±í µí±í µí±í µí± , í µí±í µí±í µí±í µí±¢í µí±í µí±í µí±¡í µí±í µí±í µí± í µí±í µí±í µí±í µí±¤í µí±¡ℎ) Using the 2009 values for savings rates, aid, FDI, and population growth, and the 
estimated value for θ, the incremental capital-output ratio, the only variable left unidentified is 
the  " additional resources "  term. Terms can therefore be re-arranged to calculate the amount of 
additional resources needed. 5 III.2. MDG Achievement through Service Delivery The financing gap calculation described above provides an estimate of the size of 
additional resources national economies would need to raise their growth rates sufficiently to 
achieve MDG1. As mentioned in Section II, the literature argues that to avoid  " double counting "  5.

© OECD 2011 of cost estimates, these resources cannot be added together with the costs to achieve the other 
MDGs. Indeed, particularly at the aggregate level, it is very difficult to disentangle the  " joint 
production "  of the MDGs: lower poverty improves health and education outcomes, and better 
health and education can lower poverty as well. In addition, reducing poverty by increasing 
growth is fundamentally different from improving health outcomes by increasing health 
expenditures and improving education by increasing educational expenditures. Similarly, there 
is a fundamental difference between reducing poverty by increasing growth and reducing 
poverty by redistributing income to poor people: once incomes improve through the growth 
process, they are much more likely to fall back significantly even though their growth may slow. 
Conversely, education, health expenditure and transfers to reduce poverty need to be 
maintained, or people will not remain healthy, children will not stay in school, and transfer 
recipients may fall back into poverty. While transfer programmes can potentially contribute to 
growth by altering the trajectories of the individuals and families they are allocated to, it is 
reasonable to assume that their withdrawal typically leads to significant social and development 
setbacks. In other words, the investment requirements needed to catalyse growth – such as those 
estimated by the financing gap calculation described above can be considered one-off 
expenditures needed to drive up growth rates in the lead up to 2015. Once sufficiently high per 
capita incomes are achieved, at the heart of the financing gap calculation is Rostow's (1956) 
assumption that economic take-off would lead to a period of self-sustaining growth. Thereafter 
additional resources should not be required beyond those produced by the economy itself. While 
this may be considered a simplistic assumption, it is no less naïve than the assumption that 
capital turns into output in a mechanistic way. Again, for the sake of this paper, it is sufficient for 
helping to gauge the order of magnitude of resources needed to achieve the MDGs. In contrast, 
the provision of services to achieve the MDGs can be treated as recurring, non-overlapping, 
expenditures: income transfers, health and education expenditures can and should be added up, 
and they need to be maintained beyond 2015 to secure MDG achievement. This implies another 
set of simplifying assumptions, particularly with respect to how expenditures are distributed and 
how recurring costs may change over time. Importantly, however, keeping these implicit 
assumptions in mind, these simple estimates allow us to gauge the order of magnitude of the 
cost of MDG achievement that takes the form of service delivery. The rest of this section looks first at the income transfers, second at the education 
expenditures and third and finally at the health expenditures that are needed to achieve the 
MDGs through service provision. Unlike the financing gap calculations, income transfers are 
assumed not to directly affect health and education outcomes. Indeed, the transfers calculated 
specifically target the poor who are the closest to the poverty line and provide them additional 
income to move them just above the poverty line. Consequently, the effect of poverty reduction 
on health and education outcomes is significantly less than it would be if poverty declined due to 
distributional-neutral broad-based growth, such as is assumed by the financing gap calculation. 1. Using the Poverty Gap to Calculate Transfers to the Poor (MDG 1) The poverty gap index provides a useful yardstick to measure how much the investment 
requirements calculated above correspond to the actual needs of poor people in each country in OECD Development Centre Working Paper No.306 DEV/DOC(2011)14 © OECD 2011 
25 question. Instead of looking at how much additional resources are needed to stimulate growth, 
the extra income the poor need to halve the number of poor by 2015 is estimated. The poverty 
gap (Foster et al., 1984) measure is a poverty indicator that measures the mean proportionate 
shortfall (z-yi) from the poverty line (z) for a given population (n): í µí±í µí±í µí±£í µí±í µí±í µí±¡í µí±¦ í µí±í µí±í µí± =

 *  í µí°¼( í µí± í µí±=1 í µí±¦ í µí± < í µí± §) Multiplying the poverty gap by the poverty line (z) and the total population (n) thus gives 
an aggregate measure of the total transfer required to eliminate poverty in a given country for a 
given distribution. The poverty gap is also easily computable from the parameters of the Lorenz 
curve the poverty headcount, mean income, and the poverty line, z, following Datt (1998). The poverty gap associated with the mean income and poverty headcount obtained 
under a  " business as usual "  growth scenario through 2015 -based on the most recent World 
Economic Outlook projections from the IMF-can be compared to the poverty gap of a distribution 
associated with the target growth scenario calculated for the financing gap calculation above. 
The difference between the predicted and the targeted poverty gaps in 2015 can then be used to 
calculate the aggregate transfer that will be needed every year to keep sufficient numbers of poor 
people out of poverty to assure that the poverty headcount is half its 1990 levels:

Calculating Expenditure to Meet Education-related Goals (MDGs 2 & 3) The cost of achieving universal primary education is estimated using the method 
proposed by Delamonica et al. (2001). Based on country-specific unit cost estimation of primary 
education, this study projected the annual additional cost of reaching a net enrolment ratio equal 
to 100% for primary education by 2015. According to the definition of the United Nations' 
Statistics Division, the net enrolment rate (NER) in primary education is the number of children 
of official primary school age who are enrolled in primary education as a percentage of the total 
children of the official school age population. Some authors, e.g. Glewwe and Zhao (2006), argue 
that keeping children enrolled in primary education until completion is a major constraint for 
universal completion of primary education, for instance when there exist outside options for 
children to enter the labour force or contribute to work at home. However, the simplifying 
assumption made here is that achieving universal enrolment in primary education would lead to 
universal completion of primary education if other MDGs are met. For instance, if poverty is also 
reduced significantly, it can be argued that the reservation wage available to children who do not 
complete primary schooling is less likely to be significant. Revisiting MDG Cost Estimates from a Domestic Resource Mobilisation Perspective DEV/DOC(2011)14 26 
© OECD 2011 The NER data available for years 1999-2009 and data for public expenditure 6 To calculate the number of students to be schooled, two hypotheses are made about the 
future baseline trend of net enrolment rates. First, the baseline scenario assumes that NERs 
remain constant at the 2009 level, on primary 
education come from UNESCO and the World Bank. Population census and projections are taken 
from the United Nations' World Population Prospects, the 2010 Revision (United Nations, 
Population Division). GDP per capita is taken from the IMF World Economic Outlook data, April 
2011 Edition. To assess how much education expenditure needs to be spent to achieve universal 
primary education, baseline spending on education must first be estimated under reasonable 
assumptions about future net enrolment rates. To project public expenditure, real public 
expenditure per student on primary education until 2015 is assumed to remain the same as in 
2009. Differences thus exist across countries, as there are countries and regions where the 
expenditure per student is higher than in others. These differences can reflect variations in the 
cost of providing a constant quality of education or, alternatively, of variations in the quality of 
primary education across regions and countries. It is beyond the scope of this paper to separate 
these two effects because the quality of education is not explicitly an MDG, while universal 
primary enrolment is. 7 í µí±í µí±¡í µí±¢í µí±í µí±í µí±í µí±¡í µí± í µí±í µí±í µí±í µí±í µí±í µí± í µí±í µí± í µí±í µí±í µí±í µí± í µí±¡í µí±í µí±í µí±¡ = í µí±í µí°¸í µí± í µí±í µí±í µí±í µí±í µí±í µí± í µí±í µí± í µí±í µí±í µí±í µí± í µí±¡í µí±í µí±í µí±¡ × í µí° ¶ℎí µí±í µí±í µí±í µí±í µí±í µí± 2015, 6−11 í µí±¦í µí±í µí±í µí±í µí± í µí±í µí±í µí± while an alternative scenario assumes that the NERs follow

Under the alternative scenario, the projected additional expenditure can be considered a lower 
bound estimate of the cost that could be incurred in 2015. 3. Calculating Expenditure to Meet Health-related Goals (MDGs 4, 5, & 6) Health-related MDGs include reducing child mortality (MDG 4), improving maternal 
health (MDG 5), and combating HIV/AIDS, malaria, and other pandemic diseases (MDG 6). 
Devarajan et al. (2002) argued that adding up the costs of achieving the different health goals 
could lead to their overestimation because the different goals are highly interconnected. On the 
other hand, it can be argued that there is also a risk of underestimating these costs considering 
the weak relation between public spending and health outcomes as shown by Filmer et al. (2000). 
According to the World Health Organization (2010), ensuring access to the types of interventions 
and treatments needed to address MDGs 4, 5 and 6 requires on average  " little more than 
USD 60 per capita [annually] by 2015. "  Of course, it is legitimate to wonder how realistic it is to assume that USD 60 per capita 
would be the amount of health expenditure required to meet health-related MDGs in all 
developing countries. For instance, calculations that are explained further in Annex 3 show that 
in low income countries the effect on child mortality of increases in health is insignificant. For 
lower-middle income countries, in contrast, the effect is strong and very significant while for 
upper-middle income countries, the effect is somewhat strong and still very significant. This S-
shaped health input-outcome relationship is consistent with the literature (see a discussion in 
Klasen and Lange, 2011). The implication is that for low-income countries, it is not even clear that 
expenditure on top of USD 60 per capita would necessarily lead to health outcomes compatible 
with attaining health-related MDGs essentially because of absorptive capacity issues. As for 
middle income countries, USD 60 per capita is probably an underestimate of the cost of meeting 
health-related MDGs in upper-middle countries. The reasons are twofold: the cost of health 
provision is correlated with the general price level and health outcomes become more expensive 
to attain the more advanced in health a country gets. Calculations explained in Annex 3 lead to 
estimates of a USD 83.4 per capita only to meet the child mortality MDG (MDG 4) in lower-
middle income countries, and USD 288.1 per capita in upper middle income countries. This paper, however, sticks to WHO's USD 60 per capita estimate not only because the 
virtue of its simplicity and transparency but also because it is questionable whether health-
related MDGs are as meaningful in middle-income countries as in lower-income countries. In Revisiting MDG Cost Estimates from a Domestic Resource Mobilisation Perspective DEV/DOC(2011)14 28 
© OECD 2011 middle-income countries, redistribution and offering access to health services to poor people 
may be a priority more in the actual spirit of MDGs rather than necessarily raising the overall 
expenditure per capita for the population as a whole. Such priority may not actually require 
spending per capita significantly above USD 60 per capita. What this discussion implies, 
however, is that more effort has to be devoted to understanding and addressing inequalities with 
respect to health outcomes in middle income countries. With the USD 60 per capita target maintained, to calculate how much additional 
expenditure will be required globally to meet this threshold, baseline spending on health first 
needs to be estimated under reasonable assumptions about future spending. The current level of 
government spending on health is projected up to 2015 for 128 developing countries for which 
data is available. Data for per capita total expenditure on health come from the WHO. IMF World 
Economic Outlook data, April 2011 edition forecasts are used for GDP growth projections between 
2011 and 2015. These costs per inhabitant are multiplied by population projections coming from 
the United Nations' World Population Prospects, the 2010 Revision (United Nations, Population 
Division). Two different baseline scenarios are analysed: i) Linear Scenario: initial per capita expenditure for health in 2009 8 ii) Constant Scenario: initial per capita expenditure for health in 2009 remains constant. grows at the same rate 
as per capita real GDP growth projection for each year; The linear scenario can be thought of as a more realistic estimate of the growth of future 
expenditure while the constant scenario serves more as a minimum estimate. Indeed, 
calculations explained in more details in Annex 3 show that the elasticity of health expenditure 
with respect to GDP while positive and statistically significant is below 1 for all developing 
countries in general. For low income countries it stands at 0.81, for lower middle-income 
countries at 0.89 and for upper-middle income countries at 0.95. The richer the country the more 
elastic is the health expenditure with respects to GDP. Thus, the linear scenario probably 
overestimates the growth health expenditure in low-income countries and therefore 
underestimating their corresponding gap by 2015. Further, given that these elasticities are not 
very different from unity, the constant scenario is clearly underestimating health expenditure by 
2015 and thus overestimating the gap by then. The simple calculations made are as follows:

Estimating the Scope for Scaling-up Domestic Resources Mobilisation Once estimates of the costs to achieve the MDGs – calculated as the  " financing gap "  or as 
the cost of service provision as defined in the two preceding sections – are available, a natural 
step consists in estimating the degree to which countries can scale-up the mobilisation of their 
own domestic resources to finance the local achievement of MDGs. This paper adopts the 
techniques used by Piancastelli (2001) and Bird et al. (2004; 2008) to calculate  " tax effort "  in 
developing countries. Their tax effort index is calculated to compare predicted tax revenues to 
actual tax revenues and to estimate how much extra tax revenue may be collected if a country 
improves tax collection. Empirically, taxes as a share of GDP can be shown to depend on the economy's level of 
development, on the share of the economy that is formal or industrialised and on the openness of 
the economy to trade. Generally, higher levels of development and higher levels of openness 
coincide with higher levels of tax collection.

their structural characteristics, while countries with tax effort above 1 are collecting more than 
they are expected to. 9.

© OECD 2011 IV. RESULTS OF COST ESTIMATES AND DOMESTIC RESOURCE 
MEASUREMENT This section presents the figures that lead us to postulate that the cost for achieving the 
MDGs equals approximately USD 120 billion in additional resources annually. It is important to 
note that this amount is roughly twice the amount of domestic resources that developing 
countries are estimated to be able to raise through increased tax revenues. Moreover, there is a 
mismatch between the countries where additional domestic resources can typically be mobilised 
and where the financing needs to meet the MDGs are. While half the required financing is 
estimated to be needed in middle-income countries, most of the USD 64 billion in potential 
increase in domestic resource mobilisation (potential increase in tax revenues) is concentrated in 
middle-income countries that are not lagging behind on MDG progress. This section first reviews the estimated cost of achieving the MDGs through filling the 
financing gap. Second, this section looks at the estimated cost of achieving the MDGs through 
increased delivery of development services in the form of expenditure increases on cash 
transfers, health and education. Third, the results of the tax effort calculations are then reviewed 
and used to show why, although substantial, scope for increased tax collection will have little 
immediate impact on MDG achievement. Finally, this section explains why the financing gap 
calculations are used for low-income countries while the service provision calculations are used 
for middle-income countries. IV.1. The Cost of Filling the  " Financing Gap "  Table 3 shows the results of the financing gap calculations by region and by income 
group. Taken at face value, the financing gap calculations reflect a need for more than 
USD 200 billion in additional resources annually to achieve the MDGs. The bulk of these 
additional resources is estimated to be required in middle-income countries. However, as 
explained in Section I, this paper relies on the financing gap calculations for estimating the cost 
estimate of achieving the MDGs in low-income countries, where a financing gap exists. 
Therefore, out of the more than USD 200 billion financing gap worldwide, only the 
USD 62 billion gap in low-income countries is considered to be a credible estimate of the cost of 
achieving the MDGs in these countries. This is for a number of reasons explained below. The East Asia and the South Asia regions have minimal additional capital requirements 
to achieve the target growth rates needed to halve poverty, reflecting the significant progress 
these regions have already made on MDG 1 over the last decade. However, the Latin America 
and Caribbean and the sub-Saharan Africa regions require significant amounts of additional 
capital to achieve enough growth to halve poverty. The amount of total additional resources OECD Development Centre Working Paper No.306 DEV/DOC(2011)14 © OECD 2011 
31 required at the global level is estimated in this paper to be significantly larger than the amounts 
estimated in previous studies, such as Devarajan et al. (2002). This is primarily because this paper 
calculates the financing gap for a broader sample of countries. In Devarajan et al. (ibid.), countries 
that are not on track to achieve the MDGs but for which increases in aid will not significantly 
impact growth rates – for instance, Colombia, Venezuela and Haiti – are explicitly excluded from 
calculations. The argument is that these countries include a number of countries that receive 
small amounts of aid relative to GDP and have relatively high average income or consumption 
but highly unequal distributions of incomes and thus a high number of poor. Table 3: The Total Additional Capital Requirement Needed to Achieve MDG 1

in the sample intentionally; the focus of this paper is on the total amount of resources needed, 
whether those resources come from aid or other sources of finrancing. Doing so also highlights a 
key result of the present exercise: those countries with the greatest growth financing needs are 
indeed those countries where increasing aid has the smallest effect on growth. Leaving in such 
countries drives up the cost of meeting MDG 1 and may go against the original spirit of MDGs 
that were meant to be met at the global level, however. Indeed, Colombia and Venezuela have 
neither the largest number of poor people in the world nor even the largest share of poor in their 
populations. These economies simply are some of the most unequal and have been historically 
some of the least responsive to investment and aid as captured by the long-term values of the 
incremental capital-output ratio estimated over the period 1990-2015. The role of inequality cannot be overstated in the explanation of the large financing gaps 
in Latin American countries. In addition to the lack of productivity of capital investment 
reflected in a high incremental capital-output ratio, these countries also face a very low growth 
elasticity of poverty reduction. This is because high inequality mutes the impact of growth on Revisiting MDG Cost Estimates from a Domestic Resource Mobilisation Perspective DEV/DOC(2011)14 32 
© OECD 2011 poverty reduction (Bourguignon, 2003). Taking Colombia as an example, out of USD 1 million 
growth in national income, on average only USD 8 800 goes to the poorest 10%, whereas 
USD 462 000 to the richest 10%. In other words, to get USD 8 800 to the poorest, the simple 
Harrod-Domar model used in this paper requires that USD 462 000 be granted to the richest 
through growth because it postulates distribution-neutral growth. Nonetheless, many of these countries have significantly high income per capita and could 
conceivably reduce poverty through redistribution. The needs in upper-middle-income countries 
and in much of Latin America stem less from the absolute needs of poor populations than they 
do from the inefficient market structure of those countries – captured by high incremental 
capital-output ratios and low savings rates and/or by high inequality, which is reflected by 
relatively high mean incomes but large numbers of poor people. Obviously, using fiscal policy to 
make growth more inclusive and combating poverty through public spending targeted at lower-
income groups may be more propitious than reducing poverty through increased growth in the 
current conditions prevailing in these countries. This possibility is considered in the following 
section, which looks at the cost of income transfers to the poor that could help achieve MDG 1 as 
part of a broader programme of service delivery. IV.2.The Cost of Development Service Provision 1. Income Transfers to the Poor to Fill the Poverty Gap The additional resources needed to increase average incomes enough to reduce poverty 
by the amount required to achieve MDG 1 are, in many cases, substantial. Of course, these 
calculations are highly troublesome, for a number of the reasons outlined above. Interestingly, 
contrary to the results of the growth exercise in Section A, the poverty gap calculation shows that 
the greatest absolute need of the poor – in terms of the amount by which their incomes are on 
average below the poverty line – is in sub-Saharan Africa and is spread more or less evenly 
between low-income and lower-middle-income countries. This transfer is calculated for the 35 countries that are not on track to achieve MDG 1 
according to the financing gap calculations above, where the distributional data and the IMF 
projections are available. As shown in Table 4, the total aggregate transfer to the poor required to 
achieve MDG 1 is estimated to be USD 9.8 billion at purchasing power parity terms (that is, 
USD 4.9 billion at market exchange rates). It is important to note, however, that these transfers 
are hypothesised to be perfectly targeted and do not include administration or transaction costs. 
Accordingly, they represent an extreme lower bound to the amount of additional resources 
required to achieve MDG 1. OECD Development Centre Working Paper No.306 DEV/DOC(2011)14 © OECD 2011

neutral growth that, in turn, spurs production of the other human development outcomes 
captured by the rest of the MDGs. In contrast, the poverty gap calculations approach poverty 
reduction in a more limited manner. Reaching MDG 1 through the targeted cash transfers 
implied by such calculations suggests individual transfers going to the poor people who are 
closest to the poverty line. These transfers would therefore go only to smallest number of people 
necessary to ensure that the headcount ratio is halved. All other things remaining equal, this type 
of transfer would actually increase inequality. Indeed, the poor as a group – i.e. those still poor 
after the transfer – would be on average more deeply poor – i.e. farther from the poverty line – 
than the poor as a group were before. Accordingly, this estimate is a lower bound on the order of 
magnitude of the costs of MDG 1 achievement, rather than a concrete proposal for MDG 1 
achievement through cash transfers. 2. Achieving Universal Primary Enrolment through Education Expenditure Under the hypothesis that government expenditure on education stays constant and all 
increases come from additional resources, amongst 90 countries 10 10. Amongst these 90 countries, there are 23 low-income countries, 33 lower-middle-income countries and 
33 upper-middle-income countries. Equatorial Guinea (High Income) is also included in the dataset. for which data is available, the 
baseline projection shows that as much as an additional USD 8.8 billion needs to be spent in 2015 
to achieve universal primary education. As shown in Table 5, upper-middle-income countries 
have the largest expenditure shortfall, USD 5.5 million, followed by lower-middle-income 
countries with USD 2.2 million. The region that requires the highest increase in spending Revisiting MDG Cost Estimates from a Domestic Resource Mobilisation Perspective DEV/DOC(2011)14 34 
© OECD 2011 compared to baseline expenditure is Latin America and Caribbean with USD 2.9 billion. This is 
predominantly due to the higher cost of primary education per student. Sub-Saharan Africa is 
the second costliest region in terms of achieving universal primary education, with an 
expenditure shortfall of USD 2.3 billion. The East Asia and Pacific region follows close behind, 
with a USD 1.3 billion shortfall. The sub-Saharan Africa and the Latin American and Caribbean 
regions together represent about 59% of all additional spending that would be required in 2015 
to achieve universal enrolment in primary school. Table 5: Additional Resources Needed to Achieve Universal Primary Education in 2015

preceding decade, the additional spending required in 2015 to achieve universal primary 
education is estimated to be USD 6.9 billion. This projection shows that a continuation of current 
efforts to increase NERs makes a significant difference to the cost of achieving universal primary 
enrolment with expenditure shortfall reduced by USD 1.9 billion in 2015. A wait-and-see attitude 
is not advisable, however, because there is no guarantee that NERs will keep rising at the same 
pace they have during the last decade without additional increases in educational investment. The underlying challenge is that substantial heterogeneity exists among countries within 
each region, so that regional averages do not portray well how much spending has to rise in 
individual countries within a region. Universal primary education may be within reach at the 
regional level even if it remains a distant prospect in individual countries. The required absolute 
change and rate of increase in spending on education in some countries can be very high, and OECD Development Centre Working Paper No.306 DEV/DOC(2011)14 © OECD 2011 
35 there is no reason to expect that countries from the region with higher budgets and/or closer to 
achieving universal primary enrolment would subsidise countries with smaller budgets 11 In addition, it is important to point out that these costs do not capture the economies of 
scale implicit in achieving universal primary enrolment. These results are conditioned by the 
assumption that the cost per student remains constant as NERs are raised towards 100%. 
However, it is reasonable to assume that required expenditure per student rises the closer a 
country gets to universal enrolment. Generally speaking, it should be more costly to raise the 
share of enrolled students when enrolment is close to universal than when few students are 
enrolled. For instance, providing schooling in remote areas is typically more challenging than it 
is in major urban centres. Along the same lines, the absolute cost of achieving universal primary 
education in Latin America and Caribbean is of the same order of magnitude as in sub-Saharan 
Africa despite a much smaller population of school age. This is because while Latin America and 
Caribbean is closer to achieving universal primary enrolment, the cost per student is much 
higher in Latin America and Caribbean than in sub-Saharan Africa. . 3. Expenditure Required to Achieve Health-related MDGs The total spending required to meet health-related MDGs is calculated based on the 
estimates from the World Health Organization (2010). According to these estimates, a little more 
than USD 60 per capita will be required by 2015 to achieve health-related MDGs. The level of 
expenditure per capita is assumed to rise linearly from its current level to USD 60 per capita by 
2015. This figure is multiplied by the projected size of the population. Table 6 below shows average total expenditure per capita by income group and by 
region. While assuming a constant cost per capita to meet all three health MDGs is a convenient 
and transparent simplifying assumption, a limitation of this section's calculations is that the cost 
of meeting health-related goals is likely to be underestimated in some countries. For instance, of 
all three goals, improvements in maternal health are those associated with the highest costs. 
Further, achieving a goal such as reducing infant mortality is bound to get more expensive the 
closer a country is to completing the goal. 11. Separate calculations show that, taken together, the countries with an education expenditure shortfall 
would need to increase spending on education by 7.4% in 2015 compared to baseline expenditures. On 
the face of it, such rate of increase sounds achievable. However, this kind of calculation implicitly 
assumes that spending on education can be funded at the global level and allocated to countries where 
it is needed to achieve universal primary enrolment. Indeed, at the regional level, the level of increase in 
spending required looks more challenging: sub-Saharan Africa requires the largest proportional 
increase, 22.3%, in the amount projected to be spent in 2015. The Middle East and North Africa comes 
next, with 8.2%. Revisiting MDG Cost Estimates from a Domestic Resource Mobilisation Perspective DEV/DOC(2011)14 36

number of countries, particularly in South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. Required additional 
expenditures are roughly equally split between low-income countries and lower-middle-income 
countries. Notably, lower-middle-income countries are where there have been significant 
increases in expenditure in recent years; this calls into question whether these expenditure 
increases can be sustained. This is all the more relevant as increased expenditures on health have 
not consistently been accompanied by improvement in health outcomes, challenging the 
relevance of the USD 60 per capita benchmark proposed by the WHO. OECD Development Centre Working Paper No.306 DEV/DOC(2011)14 © OECD 2011

corresponding upper-bound estimate for education, and the market exchange rate amount 
needed for the poverty transfer. As explained above, these three costs can be added and 
compared with the cost estimate derived from the  " financing gap "  calculations. As explained in Section IV.1, there is a strong argument against using the  " financing gap "  
calculation for middle-income countries, given the high levels of inequality and high capital-
output ratios observed in the middle-income countries that are not on track to achieve the MDGs. 
Development service delivery can be considered the more cost-effective way to achieve the goals 
in these middle-income countries. The USD 28.8 billion in additional health expenditure, the 
USD 7.7 billion in education expenditure and the USD 2.5 billion in income transfers can thus be 
added to obtain a total service delivery cost in middle-income countries amounting to 
USD 39 billion. A total of USD 59.1 billion is obtained in service delivery costs in low-and 
middle-income countries if the USD 39 billion figure for middle-income countries is augmented 
by the USD 20.1 billion needed in low-income countries that have no  " financing gap "  per se but 
that are falling behind on the other MDGs, primarily health-related goals. This USD 59.1 billion 
figure constitutes approximately half of the total cost, with the other half being the Revisiting MDG Cost Estimates from a Domestic Resource Mobilisation Perspective DEV/DOC(2011)14 38

scope for increased mobilisation of domestic resources compares with these amounts, and then 
Section IV.4 discusses in further detail the justification behind the particular choice of mixing 
between the two types of cost estimates made in this paper. IV.3. The Scope for Scaling-up Domestic Resource Mobilisation Figure 4 shows tax effort calculations for those countries that face a  " financing gap "  for 
which tax revenue data is available. More than half are already collecting more taxes than 
expected, but some countries can make sizeable gains. Some of these countries include some with 
significant financing gaps, such as Colombia and Democratic Republic of the Congo. Figure 4: Tax Effort in Countries facing a Financing Gap Source: Authors' calculations. For countries with tax efforts below unity, Figure 5 shows how much additional revenue 
could be raised and compares this amount to actual tax and other government revenues. 
Colombia, Guatemala and Paraguay could raise several billion USD of their needed resources by 
improving tax collection. Democratic Republic of the Congo could also raise a non-negligible 
sum of money by improving tax collection. Nonetheless, improved tax collection is unfortunately 
not a panacea for financing development. Indeed, many of the countries that have scope to 
improve revenue collection are already well on their way to achieving the MDGs. 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 1.2 1.4 1.6 1.8 Central Afr. Rep. Paraguay

39 Figure 5: Additional Potential Revenues vs. Actual Tax and Non-Tax Revenues Source: Authors' calculations. Table 8 presents results for 22 countries 12 The values shown in Table 8 correspond to more than USD 64 billion in potential tax 
revenue available in the developing world. As shown in Sections IV.1 and IV.2, the additional 
resources needed to achieve the MDGs could constitute approximately twice this amount. This 
raises the question as to whether and to what extent some emerging countries are in a position 
both to increase their tax revenues and to scale up their own contributions to development co-
operation and investment in other developing countries. Indeed, discussions among the 
development partners at the Fourth High-Level Forum on Aid Effectiveness in Busan, Korea, 
have highlighted the unique and growing importance of such South-South aid flows. 
Importantly, while attempts can be made to compare these flows to ODA from traditional 
partners, the discussions at Busan underscored the fact that the principles, commitments and 
actions agreed among development partners with respect to traditional ODA are only a reference 
for South-South partners on a voluntary basis. Therefore it is interesting to speculate the manner with tax effort below 1 and compares the level 
of domestic resources with ODA and FDI. Mexico is the country with the largest potential for an 
increase in domestic resources through improved tax collection. It is interesting to note that 
while Mexico still requires increases in educational spending to achieve the MDGs according to 
the calculations in Section IV.2, the magnitude of the needed expenditures is only in the 
hundreds of millions, while the potential tax resources that could be increased is on the order of 
tens of billions. Notably, the other countries with the largest potential – Russia and Kazakhstan--
are not struggling to achieve the MDGs. This said, Colombia – which is struggling more than 
Mexico – has the fourth largest potential to increase resources. In fact, the potential for increasing 
tax resources in Colombia is large enough to cover the poverty gap and the increased educational 
expenditures the country would require according to the calculations described in Section IV.2. 12. Iran, Bhutan, El Salvador, Thailand, Pakistan, Panama and Costa Rica are excluded because complete 
data was not available for these countries. 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 Guatemala

41 Table 9 furthermore shows that the vast difference in the scale of potential additional tax 
resources available between low-income and middle-income countries. While potential 
additional tax resources as a share of GDP are similar across the groups, the absolute potential 
amounts of additional tax resources differ greatly. Accordingly, it is not surprising that the scale 
of additional tax resources available in middle income countries can cover the cost of MDG-
related service needs calculated in the previous sections. This is not true of the size of potential 
additional tax resources in low-income countries, which in no case can cover the service related 
MDG costs nor the financing gap cost. It therefore does not appear likely that domestic resource 
mobilisation can make a significant contribution to filling the resource gap in the low-income 
countries with the largest relative needs. Table 9: Potential Tax Increases by Income Group Income Group

resources in low-income countries that have an MDG resource need, it must be noted that 
conclusions drawn above owe a lot to the simplified nature of the calculations in question. These 
results should only be interpreted as providing a first-cut of such calculations rather than the 
ultimate answer, particularly on a country-by-country basis. There may be additional scope for 
raising revenue in some countries, if the analysis was instead performed with detailed country-
level data. Finally, given that the MDGs have 2015 as their deadline, it is also important to note that 
raising additional revenue is a time-consuming task and can pose particular challenges to low-
income countries with limited administrative capacity. Determined efforts would need to be 
made to overcome the inherent difficulty of raising additional revenue in such a short time 
period, and given capacity constraints as well as governance issues. For example, if 
improvements in tax collection focus too much on natural resource rents, there is a risk that 
reversals in commodity prices might adversely affect revenue mobilisation and endanger 
progress on the MDGs. IV.4. Mixing cost estimates without double-counting Throughout this paper, two separate sets of MDG cost estimates have been entertained. 
The results presented in Section IV.1 are based on the premise that  " a rising tide lifts all boats "  
and that economic growth at a sufficiently high rate can spur development success, particularly 
in other human development outcomes captured by the MDGs. In contrast, the results presented 
Section IV.2 are founded on the simple argument that improving public expenditures on service 
delivery can lead to MDG achievement. In both cases, the link implicitly assumed between 
public expenditure and social outcomes is admittedly naïve and, thus the connection made Revisiting MDG Cost Estimates from a Domestic Resource Mobilisation Perspective DEV/DOC(2011)14 42 
© OECD 2011 between the cost estimated and the progress expected is tenuous at best. Nevertheless, this 
paper's estimates serve their limited purpose quite well: at a global level these calculations help 
to provide a useful starting point for understanding the level of resources needed from both 
domestic and external sources together to achieve the MDGs. The cost estimates for achieving the MDGs through development service delivery appear 
to be approximately on order of magnitude smaller than the estimates of the capital requirement 
to achieve the growth needed to meet the MDGs. The service delivery calculations in section IV.2 
lead to a global figure in the tens of USD billions, while the financing gap in Section IV.1 is 
calculated to be on the order of hundreds of USD billions. Yet, this apparent difference in annual 
amounts ignores the nature of the expenditures implied by the separate theoretical frameworks 
underlying the two different sets of cost estimates; this is why this paper opts to utilise the 
financing gap calculations for the low-income countries and to focus on the service delivery costs 
for middle-income countries. Indeed, the financing gap approach owes its intellectual heritage to the Harrod-Domar 
growth models underpinning the  " take-off "  and  " big push "  literature of the 1950s and 1960s. The 
stated aim of filling the gap in these models is to propel economies into a pattern of self-
sustaining growth in order to escape a poverty trap. As discussed in Sections II and III, aid may 
not be the ideal means by which this gap is filled. However, beyond thinking about development 
resources in terms of aid, these Harrod-Domar models – albeit simple – can be used to estimate 
the rough size of the temporary capital requirement needed to increase growth and achieve 
sufficiently high growth rates to help transform the structure of the economy into a self-
sustaining growth path. In contrast, the development service approach is premised on the notion that public 
expenditure is not vigorous enough to ensure that the poor stay out of poverty, that children are 
enrolled in primary schools, and that child mortality, maternal mortality and pandemic diseases 
are sufficiently kept in check. Taken at face value, this implies that the financing gap is 
constructed as a time-bound target meant to raise domestic income high enough to ensure self-
sustaining MDG achievement, while the service delivery costs are conceived in a way that 
requires the corresponding transfers to be maintained beyond the 2015 deadline to secure MDG 
achievement. In other words, a drop in development service expenditure is expected to be 
accompanied by a recurrence of poverty, declines in child enrolment, and resurgence of child 
mortality, maternal mortality and deadly disease that compromise progress made on the MDGs. The annual service delivery costs are naturally smaller than the annual financing gap in 
both low-income and middle-income countries. However, it is important to compare the total 
capital layout implied by the different theoretical frameworks that govern the separate cost 
estimates. Table 10 compares the total capital cost of filling the financing gap in the lead up to 
2015 with the total capital cost of increasing service delivery expenditures into perpetuity. The 
former is accomplished by simply summing the financing gap amounts over the six years 
between 2009 – the base year used for the calculations – and 2015. The latter requires discounting 
into perpetuity the recurring annual service delivery expenditure needed to achieve the MDGs 
given the theoretical framework adopted for these calculations. As shown in Table 10, the total 
capital layout needed to fill the financing gap in low-income countries, USD 372 billion, is a bit 
more than half the net present value of recurring development service expenditure in these OECD Development Centre Working Paper No.306 DEV/DOC(2011)14 © OECD 2011 
43 countries, USD 625 billion. In contrast, the discounted value of the recurring cash flows required 
to achieve the MDGs through development service delivery in the middle-income countries, 
USD 677 billion, is roughly half the financing gap in these countries, USD 1 308 billion. From this 
point of view, filling the financing gap is actually less costly in low-income countries, while 
achieving the MDGs through service delivery is less costly in middle-income countries. Table 10: Total Capital Layout Required (2009 USD billion) Total Capital Layout Low income

average of 6-month LIBOR in the US, 1980-2012 as documented in IMF (2011)), thus

incremental capital-output ratios and high levels of inequality make poverty reduction through 
investing in growth in most middle-income countries extremely costly, particularly in 
comparison with the annual expenditures required to deliver MDG achievement through service 
delivery. Moreover, as shown in Section IV.3, the scope for increasing domestic resource 
mobilisation is also much higher, although perhaps not sufficiently enough, in middle-income 
countries. Yet, if improved service delivery through increased resource mobilisation is the key to 
MDG achievement in the middle-income countries, the question remains as to where should the 
resources come from to fill the financing gap in low-income countries. IV.5. Filling the  " financing gap "  in low-income countries without relying solely on 
ODA The question of how to fill the financing gap in low-income countries is linked to the 
reason why previous MDG cost estimates have focused on the argument to scale-up aid flows 
over the past decade. In nominal dollar terms, the scaling-up of aid flows has been observed over 
the last decade, with aid flows essentially doubling between the early 2000s and the end of the 
decade. However, in real dollar terms and even more so as a share of Development Assistance 
Committee (DAC) member country GDP, this scaling-up has been less sizeable. There is thus a 
need to evaluate the implication that there should be a renewed focus on holding DAC member 
governments to deliver on the commitments made in Monterrey, at Gleneagles and in Accra, and 
most recently at Busan. That DAC member governments make good on the substantial commitments that they 
have made since the inception of the MDG framework is in fact a key criterion for reaching 
MDG 8, the goal of building a global partnership of development. However, the budget Revisiting MDG Cost Estimates from a Domestic Resource Mobilisation Perspective DEV/DOC(2011)14 44 
© OECD 2011 pressures on many DAC member governments are such that expecting ODA to remain constant 
in nominal terms is probably already an optimistic scenario. Further, in the spirit of the Accra 
Agenda for Action (2008) and its emphasis on ownership of development policies and on the 
importance of domestic resource mobilisation, this paper's stated aim is to look beyond scaled-
up ODA as a prerequisite for MDG achievement. There is therefore a need to assess potential 
sources of alternative development finance that can increase development investment in low-
income countries to the level of the financing gaps that characterise them. There is also a need to re-examine the rationale behind the often cited goal of increasing 
ODA flows to 0.7% of DAC member GDP. This target is often used as a measure of progress on 
MDG 8. However, the call to scale-up aid flows to this 0.7% level predates the MDG framework. 
Like the financing gap itself, this call has its origins in the simple Harrod-Domar model 
employed by development economists in the 1960s. This 0.7% target actually stems from back-of-
the-envelope calculations performed by Jan Tinbergen and Hollis Chenery in the context of the 
first  " development decade "  in the 1960s. Using a simple Harrod-Domar model, these economists 
asserted that total capital flows to the developing world ought to be around 1% of the developed 
world's GNI (Clemens and Moss, 2005; Vandemoortele, 2011). At the time of their calculations, 
private capital flows to developing countries constituted approximately 0.3% of the developed 
countries' GNI; therefore, they considered that the remaining 0.7% could be filled by public 
flows. Figure 6 shows that during the 1970s, again during the late 1990s, and again during the 
mid-2000s, private capital flows from DAC members to partners were substantially higher than 
this 0.3% and in fact exceeded the share of DAC member output that was transferred to 
development partners through concessionary flows. Figure 6: Concessionary and private capital flows from DAC member countries to 
development partners, 1970-2010 (% of DAC member current GDP) Source: Authors' calculations based on OECD-DAC. Figure 7 plots concessionary and private capital flows in real terms; it shows a clear rising 
in the magnitude of private capital flows to development partners over the last forty years. What 
Figures 6 and 7 also show, however, is the extreme volatility of these private capital flows to 0.0% 0.1% 0.2% 0.3% 0.4% 0.5% 0.6% 0.7% 0.8% 0.9% ODA, other official flows and net grants by private voluntary organisations Private capital flows OECD Development Centre Working Paper No.306 DEV/DOC(2011)14 © OECD 2011 
45 developing countries, particularly when compared to concessionary flows. Nonetheless, the 
order of magnitude and the trend of these private capital flows is such that the prospect of filling 
the financing gap in low-income countries at least partly through increased private capital flows 
is a real option. The high volatility of these flows needs to be addressed, however. If these 
private capital flows were to constitute a large share of development finance, their volatility 
would have to be properly managed so that it does not exacerbate macroeconomic instability in 
developing countries. Figure 7: Concessionary and Private Capital Flows 
from DAC Member Countries To Developing Countries, 1970-2010 (2008 USD billion) Source: Authors' calculations based on OECD-DAC. If private capital flows are to play a larger role in financing human development 
outcomes, governments must do more to encourage such flows and manage their volatility. 
Private flows are attracted by economic returns and are therefore sensitive to economic policies 
in the recipient countries as well as external conditions, such as commodity prices. These factors 
are not all within the control of the recipient countries. Given a shift in the composition of capital 
flows towards emerging partners, there is also a shift in the kinds of projects being financed. For 
instance, traditional donors tend to fund social infrastructure projects such as water and roads, 
which are of particular relevance for MDGs. In contrast, the 2011 edition of the African Economic 
Outlook has documented that emerging partners tend to focus on production oriented 
infrastructure such as power generation and railways. While FDI is likely to contribute to 
growth, it might not be directly linked to the attainment of the MDGs. Therefore countries 
interacting with emerging partners need to do their best to keep their development strategy 
focused on how FDI can best help finance human development outcomes. If private capital is a largely untapped source of MDG financing, should governments 
engage in borrowing on non-concessional terms to achieve the MDGs? While this may be 
acceptable in some situations, debt issues remain a potential area of concern. Concerns about 
institutional quality and absorptive capacity may also be equally valid for other ways of 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 400 450 500 Constant 2008 USD billion ODA

private capital may be no realistic substitute for official financing. Given the pressure on ODA 
budgets however, the shift in focus of financing of the MDGs towards domestic and private 
sources may be more demanding on the countries seeking to attain the MDGs. OECD Development Centre Working Paper No.306 DEV/DOC(2011)14 © OECD 2011 
47 V. CONCLUSIONS The scale of financing needed to achieve the MDGs is affordable at the global level, 
particularly if countries adopt a broad view of the types of resources that can help improve 
human development outcomes in countries that are falling behind on MDG progress. Official 
Development Assistance remains an important source for financing MDG achievement, 
particularly in low-income countries. DAC member countries therefore need to deliver on their 
outstanding commitments, particularly with respect to making aid more effective, so that it can 
help catalyse development success. Domestic resource mobilisation via increased tax revenues is 
the most sustainable and dependable source of funding towards MDG achievement, particularly 
in middle-income countries. Developing countries are making notable efforts to improve tax 
collection. They can achieve further progress in broadening their tax base, particularly in the 
taxation of resource rents, which have grown dramatically over the last decade. Private capital 
flows also represent a sizeable, and largely untapped, resource for MDG financing. More can be 
done to ensure that these flows are fully exploited to promoted MDG achievement, whether they 
come from traditional DAC members or from emerging partner countries. The purpose of this paper is to revisit the costing estimates that have shaped much of the 
discourse on the MDGs over the past decade. A fresh perspective on countries' capacity to raise 
additional development investment on their own is needed. The orders of magnitude of 
resources needed to achieve the MDGs in the developing world as a whole are compatible with 
the degree of financial resources available, both domestic and external. While this paper offers a 
specific figure for how much achieving the MDGs could cost, the aim is not to propose that 
development partners necessarily scramble to raise the corresponding amount of ODA. Rather, 
these estimates should be used for understanding the size of the problem that continues to face 
many countries, and indeed the world. Although it is not an insurmountably high amount, it is 
of an order of magnitude larger than the size of resources that can be raised from development 
co-operation alone, especially in current circumstances. The USD 120 billion of additional annual resources estimated to be needed to achieve the 
MDGs is divided between a USD 62.1 billion  " financing gap "  in 20 low-income countries and 
USD 59.2 billion of expenditure on the provision of development services in 79 other low-and 
middle-income countries. Some USD 64 billion in additional tax revenues could be raised 
through tax collection, primarily in middle-income countries. Unfortunately, however, the bulk 
of these additional resources would be raised in countries that are already on track for achieving 
the MDGs. Therefore, additional external resources are needed in a number of countries, 
particularly in the low-income category. While re-allocation of ODA towards these countries and 
making good on aid commitments can contribute to meeting these needs, the bulk of additional Revisiting MDG Cost Estimates from a Domestic Resource Mobilisation Perspective DEV/DOC(2011)14 48 
© OECD 2011 resources probably needs to come from elsewhere. Complementary sources of funding include 
emerging countries that have experienced success in scaling-up their own resources. A renewed 
and more systematic attempt to put private capital flows to work in the service of development 
in low-income countries is another complementary option. However, even with full financing of all the MDG cost, the MDGs will not necessarily be 
achieved. As pointed out in this paper, financing health and education expenditures is not 
identical to ensuring health and education outcomes. They require good policies in the form of 
strong public expenditure management at all levels of government, good implementation 
capacity, and a medium-term fiscal policy that would ensure the sustainability of the MDGs. 
While the availability of financing is clearly important, it is no panacea for realising the MDGs. This paper aims to appraise the limits to the costing frameworks that the development 
community can employ to gauge the scale of resources needed globally to achieve development 
goals. Like the wise men in the ancient parable, development economists who construct and use 
these global costing estimates must be cautious not to focus too much attention on what the 
individual estimates might imply for policy, but rather how the size of the estimates as a whole 
compares to the size of other resources available, beyond Official Development Assistance. MDG 
achievement corresponds to a large, but manageable cost for the world as a whole. However, 
expecting that this cost should be provided by official development assistance alone is akin to 
assuming that the elephant has a snake for its nose, rather than a trunk. As we approach the 2015 deadline of the MDGs, it is important to reflect that the time-
bound nature of the goals has helped galvanize global dialogue and action about development 
challenges. At the end of the day, however, concrete progress can only take the form of 
individual country-specific interventions. These interventions are something to which all global 
citizens, not just development agencies and concessional lenders, can contribute. Looking 
beyond 2015, it is important that this broader vision of development co-operation be maintained 
and to inform how the process of global target setting is undertaken and how the corresponding 
achievement is attained. OECD Development Centre Working Paper No.306 DEV/DOC(2011)14 © OECD 2011

© OECD 2011 ANNEX 1: CALCULATING THE FINANCING GAP The methods used by Devarajan et al. (2002) are adapted to calculate the financing gap, 
i.e. to estimate the additional resources needed to increase growth and thereby reduce income or 
consumption poverty headcount ratios by one-half of their 1990 levels in each country. A simple Harrod-Domar model defines the per capita growth rate, y, as a function of the 
savings rate, s, the incremental capital-output ratio, θ, and the population growth rate, p: 
í µí±¦ = 
í µí± 
í µí¼ 
− í µí± Saving (as a share of total output Y) is assumed to be entirely invested domestically and is 
augmented with foreign investment inflows, FDI, and aid inflows, ODA, plus any other 
additional resources (either external or domestic in origin). Thus, the above equation becomes: í µí±¦ = 
(í µí± í µí± + í µí±í µí°·í µí°´+µí°´+ í µí°¹í µí°·í µí°¼ + í µí°´í µí±í µí±í µí±í µí±¡í µí±í µí±í µí±í µí±í µí± í µí±í µí±í µí± í µí±í µí±¢í µí±í µí±í µí±í µí± ) 
í µí± 
 *  
1 
í µí¼ 
− í µí± Next, the savings rate, output, foreign investment inflows, aid, population growth and 
the incremental capital output ratio are taken as given. Thus, it is possible to calculate as a 
function of these variables the amount of additional resources and the incremental capital-output 
ratio--estimates for each country over a long period, as described below--needed to achieve a 
target growth rate: 
í µí°´í µí±í µí±í µí±í µí±¡í µí±í µí±í µí±í µí±í µí± í µí±í µí±í µí± í µí±í µí±¢í µí±í µí±í µí±í µí± = (í µí±¦ + í µí±)  *  í µí±  *  í µí¼ − í µí± í µí± + í µí±í µí°·í µí°´+µí°´+ í µí°¹í µí°·í µí°¼ The target growth rate is determined by the growth in consumption or income needed to 
achieve the mean consumption or income that gives a poverty headcount half of 1990 levels 
given the most recent Lorenz curve parameters, as spelled out in Section III: y = (μ 2015target /μ 2009 ) ( 1 6 
) The values for í µí¼ 2009 are extrapolated by adjusting the most recently available household 
survey data available in the PovcalNet database with the respective country's real GDP per OECD Development Centre Working Paper No.306 DEV/DOC(2011)14 © OECD 2011 
53 capita growth rates available from the World Bank WDI database. As shown by Datt (1998), any 
level of consumption or income per capita can be shown to be associated with a given poverty 
headcount, H, Lorenz curve parameters, π, and a poverty line, z. The parameters of the Lorenz 
curve are estimated for each country using PovcalNet's data on each decile's share of income or 
consumption available for 117 countries from the PovcalNet online database. For most countries, 
this database uses distributional data from surveys conducted during the mid to late 2000s. Two 
parameterisations of the Lorenz curve are tried, and the valid curve with the best fit is used. 
Then, the target mean consumption or income level, μ2015 target, is derived as a function of the 
estimated Lorenz curve parameters, πlatest, the headcount ratio and the poverty line, zUSD 1.25 / day 
(that is, USD 38 PPP per month), following Datt (1998): 
í µí¼ 2015 í µí±¡í µí±í µí±í µí±í µí±í µí±¡ = í µí±(í µí°» 2015 , í µí¼ í µí±í µí±í µí±¡í µí±í µí± í µí±¡ , í µí± § USD1.25 í µí±í µí±í µí±¦ ) The incremental capital output ratio, í µí¼, is then calculated. Total investment in constant 
local currency units as provided by the IMF World Economic Outlook database is summed over 
the period 1990-2015 and then divided by the difference between projected real GDP in 2016 less 
real GDP in the first available year over the 1990-2015 period: í µí¼ = 
∑ 
í µí°¼ í µí±¡ 2015 
í µí±¡=1990 í µí°ºí µí°·í µí± 2016 − í µí°ºí µí°·í µí± 1990 Because variations in í µí¼ can radically alter the results of the calculations, the longer period 
helps to smooth out atypical periods of extremely high or low investment. Revisiting MDG Cost Estimates from a Domestic Resource Mobilisation Perspective DEV/DOC(2011)14 54 
© OECD 2011 ANNEX 2: ESTIMATING TAX EFFORT The tax ratio τ is calculated as the share of GDP Y that goes to tax revenue T: 
í µí¼ = 
í µí± 
í µí± The tax ratio is then estimated as a function of the GNI per capita, agriculture share and 
trade openness, where trade openness is equal to the sum of exports, X, and imports, M, as a share 
of GDP, Y: í µí±¡í µí±í µí±í µí±í µí± í µí±í µí±í µí±í µí±í µí±í µí±í µí± í µí± =

í µí± The corresponding specification is thus estimated first by pooled OLS: 
log í µí¼ í µí± = í µí±¿ í µí± í µí¼· + í µí±¢ í µí± and then adapted to estimation by a fixed effects panel regression: 
log í µí¼ í µí±í µí±¡ = í µí±¿ í µí±í µí±¡ í µí¼· + í µí±¢ í µí± + í µí¼ í µí±í µí±¡ where X is the vector of explanatory variables: í µí±¿ = �

� Table A2 reports the point estimates. Both specifications show GNI per capita and trade 
openness to be strongly significant explanatory variables, with similar magnitudes and the 
expected signs. Agriculture as a share of GDP is only significant in the pooled OLS model, and 
the sign is positive—in line with some previous estimates (cf. Piancastelli, 2001) and likely 
reflecting the fact that high-income countries are included in the sample. OECD Development Centre Working Paper No.306 DEV/DOC(2011)14 © OECD 2011
