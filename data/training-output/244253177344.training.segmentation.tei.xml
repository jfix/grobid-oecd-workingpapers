			<body>ABSTRACT/RÉSUMÉ <lb/>The significance of Switzerland&apos;s enormous current-account surplus <lb/>Switzerland has had a long-standing surplus on its current account. But over the past 15 years that surplus <lb/>has surged to levels unmatched by nearly any other OECD country at any point. This paper looks at the <lb/>surplus from a balance of payments vantage point as well as from the optic of the excess of national saving <lb/>over domestic investment. It then seeks possible explanations for the uptrend and assesses whether it <lb/>results to any extent from market, institutional or policy failures that could call for reforms. A number of <lb/>important measurement issues are raised. But the key recommendation is that the authorities should <lb/>prepare for a possible sharp increase in the value of the Swiss franc if and when investors engaged in the <lb/> &quot; carry trade &quot; unwind their positions. To that end they should examine labour, capital and product markets <lb/>with a view to ensuring they are as flexible as possible and that factors are as mobile as possible, both <lb/>geographically and sectorally. This will allow any necessary adjustment to a higher exchange rate to be <lb/>smoothly accommodated. This Working Paper is largely extracted from the 2007 OECD Economic Survey <lb/>of Switzerland (www.oecd.org/eco/survey/switzerland). <lb/>JEL codes: E01, E21, E22, E44, E58, E65, F31, F32, O52 <lb/>Keywords: current account, carry trade, Switzerland, balance of payments <lb/>* * * * * <lb/>La signification du colossal excédent des paiements courants de la Suisse <lb/>La Suisse affiche depuis fort longtemps un excédent des paiements courants. Toutefois, au cours des <lb/>15 dernières années, cet excédent a atteint des niveaux quasiment sans précédent pour la zone OCDE. Dans <lb/>le présent document, nous examinons cet excédent tant sous l&apos;angle de la balance des paiements que dans <lb/>l&apos;optique de l&apos;excédent de l&apos;épargne nationale sur l&apos;investissement intérieur.

			<body>The significance of Switzerland&apos;s enormous current-account surplus <lb/>By <lb/>Peter Jarrett and Céline Letremy 1 <lb/>Recent developments in Switzerland&apos;s balance of payments <lb/>A traditionally sizeable external surplus has been on an uptrend since 1991 and has surged since 2002 <lb/>Switzerland has traditionally recorded a surplus on its current external account. Prior to the 1990s that <lb/>surplus showed no particular trend as a share of its GDP, averaging around 4%. However, beginning in <lb/>1991 it began what has been an almost uninterrupted ascent, culminating in the extraordinary figure of <lb/>15.1% of GDP in 2006 (Figure 1). 2 Indeed, this figure is unsurpassed in the history of OECD countries <lb/>with the exception of Norway, though only in 2006 (thanks to its substantial oil revenues). But Switzerland <lb/>has no significant natural resources. Its surplus should therefore be more amenable to analysis using the <lb/>economist&apos;s normal toolkit. The question to be faced here is what has caused this development and whether <lb/>the surplus is appropriate for Switzerland, or, if not, what market or policy failures might be operating, and <lb/>what should be done to remedy the situation. <lb/>Taking the normal balance of payments components of the current account, it is obvious that, even if <lb/>goods and especially non-factor services 3 have likewise been in gently rising surplus over the past <lb/>15 years, the main driver of the surging current-account surplus has been factor income and investment <lb/>income in particular. 4 Indeed, the CHF 57.3 billion balance on investment income in 2006 represented 80% <lb/>of the total surplus (Table 1); that outcome was exceeded only by those recorded by Japan and the <lb/>1. <lb/>The authors are, respectively, Head of Division in the Country Studies Branch of the OECD Economics <lb/>Department and Economist in the French Ministry of the Environment and formerly a consultant at the <lb/>OECD. This paper was originally produced for the OECD Economic Survey of Switzerland, published in <lb/>November 2007 under the responsibility of the Economic and Development Review Committee. The <lb/>authors are thankful to Val Koromzay, Andrew Dean, Andrés Fuentes and Claude Giorno for their helpful <lb/>comments, as well as to Françoise Correia and Mee-Lan Frank for excellent technical assistance. <lb/>2. <lb/>Preliminary data for the first three quarters of 2007 show the surplus rose to 17.5% of GDP, even though <lb/>net investment income fell: a shrinking deficit on current transfers as well as rising surpluses on both goods <lb/>and services (no doubt related to improved competitiveness) lie behind the increase. <lb/>3. <lb/>The 2006 surplus on non-factor services account of CHF 33.2 billion was led by net earnings of <lb/>CHF 13.1 billion on financial services, attributable to the strength of Swiss financial institutions, especially <lb/>the banks. <lb/>4. <lb/>Labour income is in deficit because of the heavy proportion of frontier workers among the work force and <lb/>the resulting cross-border salary payments. <lb/></body>

			<body>United Kingdom. Those receipts are first and foremost from direct investment, but with a substantial <lb/>presence of portfolio and other investment income receipts as well. Furthermore, even though of course <lb/>Switzerland&apos;s accounts follow international methodological norms, those guidelines lead to significant <lb/>distortions in its case 5 : profits earned abroad by Swiss-based multinational enterprises are attributed to <lb/>Switzerland, even if the ultimate owners of those firms are to a large extent resident abroad (think of the <lb/>many investors in, for example, Nestlé reside outside Switzerland). While it is not possible to be precise, <lb/>central bank calculations show that correction for this factor on the payments side of the ledger alone <lb/>would cut the current-account surplus by some 4¼ percentage points of GDP, leaving the true balance <lb/>in 2006 closer to 11% of GDP (SNB, 2007a, Table 9). The IMF estimates that it could be as much as <lb/>7 points of GDP (IMF, 2007). Of course these are gross figures, and the same distortion is in the data for <lb/>other countries and for Swiss portfolio holders of shares in foreign multinationals. Indeed, using figures <lb/>provided in the annual SNB report on the 2006 balance of payments, 6 the corresponding correction on the <lb/>receipts side would probably be nearly 1½ percentage points of GDP, leaving the net adjustment at less <lb/>than 3 percentage points of GDP and the adjusted current account at around 12½ per cent of GDP. <lb/>On the financial account the numerous large Swiss multinational enterprises manage to earn <lb/>significant profits, leading to outsized net outflows of direct investment; in 2006, this was offset to some <lb/>extent by inward direct investment in Switzerland. 7 Otherwise portfolio flows in both debt and equity form <lb/>go predominantly abroad; they dwarf their counterpart flows into Switzerland. This is consistent with a <lb/>portfolio diversification explanation of these capital flows: as elsewhere, home bias (unexploited <lb/>diversification potential) has been decreasing steadily but is believed not to have been entirely eliminated. <lb/>The other items on the financial account represent mainly corporate and commercial account borrowing <lb/>and lending activities. In 2006 they were primarily increases in liabilities of Swiss banks and non-financial <lb/>enterprises to foreign banks. Finally, the accumulation of reserve assets has often been another counterpart <lb/>of the current-account surplus, but in 2006 they were largely unchanged. This conforms to the pattern of <lb/>the evolution of the franc: under semi-constant upward pressure in most of the post-Bretton Woods era, its <lb/>uptrend seems to have come to an end several years ago, together with the steady rise in what has become <lb/>known as the &quot; carry trade &quot; , discussed further below. Against the euro its value was falling from early 2003 <lb/>until late 2007, cumulatively by nearly 8% on an effective basis. <lb/>5. <lb/>Another similar distortion comes through net direct investment income earned by foreign controlled <lb/>finance and holding companies: they earn income from foreign subsidiaries and pay it to foreign parents, <lb/>with what has turned out to be a small but increasing impact on Switzerland&apos;s aggregate current account – <lb/>an average of CHF 3 billion from 2000 to 2004, but nearly CHF 14 billion in 2005. <lb/>6. <lb/>Such figures comprise the fact that the ratio of Swiss portfolio investment in foreign shares to foreign <lb/>investment in Swiss shares (CHF 747 billion) is one-third; that foreign companies have a higher dividend <lb/>payout ratio than Swiss companies (assumed here to be one-half, rather than one-third); and that the <lb/>proportion of earnings of Swiss companies that are attributable to foreign shareholders is CHF 19.5 billion. <lb/>7. <lb/>Indeed, the net outflow of direct investment reversed toward the end of 2006, as Swiss movements of <lb/>equity capital abroad slowed more than the corresponding shrinkage in foreign flows into Switzerland. <lb/>ECO/WKP(2008)2 <lb/></body>

While <lb/>in the early 1990s both aggregates were falling in relation to GDP, the national saving rate began to rise <lb/>around the middle of the 1990s, reaching around 35% of GDP by 2000 (Figure 2), although this figure <lb/>might be overestimated due to the share foreigners hold in Swiss multinationals. The investment share <lb/>showed no such uptrend, with the result that the current account surged. Following a brief interruption in <lb/>2001-02, when the saving ratio fell, the investment share too began to shrink in 2002, and the difference <lb/>between the two resumed its rise. It is as yet unknown which component lies behind the most recent jump <lb/>in the surplus, as no savings/investment data are as yet available for 2006. <lb/></body>

Split of the saving surplus in the Swiss economy <lb/>As a percentage of total net saving <lb/>Source: Federal Statistical Office and OECD, Annual National Accounts database. <lb/>That increase in saving is largely attributable to financial corporations and, more recently, government <lb/>Taking a closer look by economic agents (Figure 3), it is households that have traditionally <lb/>contributed the largest share of the excess of saving over investment, although their share has been <lb/>shrinking in recent years. This is partly because of the well developed and mature pension system: <lb/>second-pillar pension savings are around half of household financial wealth. 8 Government incurred a <lb/>saving shortfall for most of the 1990s, then ran a series of surpluses before returning to deficit in 2003-04; <lb/>while outcomes thereafter are not definitive, it seems highly likely that general government saving returned <lb/>8. <lb/>Total pension fund assets and life insurance investments were already over 150% of GDP in 2004, the <lb/>highest ratio in the OECD. The Federal Office of Social Security sets some ceilings on the share of pension <lb/>fund assets that can be invested offshore. For the system as a whole that share is currently around one half <lb/>and rising. <lb/></body>

			<body>to the black in 2005-06. At the same time, government investment has been dropping steadily relative to <lb/>GDP since the early 1990s, with a cumulative decline of around 1¼ percentage points of GDP (about a <lb/>third of its level in 1991). Not surprisingly, corporations&apos; outcomes have been highly correlated with the <lb/>business cycle, although mainly for the non-financial component. For their part, financial corporations <lb/>have made a larger absolute contribution to the excess than their non-financial counterparts throughout the <lb/>past decade. Indeed, in recent years they have overtaken households 9 and thereby taken the top position in <lb/>terms of responsibility for the savings surplus. 10 Most of the action lies on the saving side of the ledger: <lb/>corporations have been raising the share of their income saved since the last recession (as they have done <lb/>in most OECD countries), as manifest in surging profitability. Combined with fairly steady investment <lb/>rates, the result has been a declining share of corporate saving that is invested, especially in net terms. <lb/>Firms have preferred to distribute dividends or to strengthen their balance sheets by paying down debt. In <lb/>so doing they may have made themselves attractive targets for future foreign takeovers, particularly by <lb/>private equity firms. <lb/>Because Switzerland has run such persistent surpluses on its current account, offset by capital <lb/>outflows, it has accumulated a huge net international investment position (CHF 668.7 billion or 131.7% of <lb/>GDP at Q3 2007, the highest ratio to GDP in the OECD). 11 For that matter it has extremely large positions <lb/>on both gross assets 12 and liabilities by OECD standards, surpassed as a share of GDP only by Ireland <lb/>(Figure 4). These positions generate the significant investment income flows described above. According <lb/>to the Swiss National Bank (SNB), which compiles the balance of payments and the investment position <lb/>statistics, the largest share of gross assets is held in the form of loans and other foreign assets (37%), <lb/>followed by portfolio investment (36%), direct investment (21%), derivatives and structured products (4%) <lb/>and finally reserve assets (3%). As to liabilities, nearly one half are bank and other company loans. Once <lb/>the net position is calculated, Switzerland finds itself mainly holding positions in direct investment (65%) <lb/>and portfolio investment (26%). However, the latter is an unbalanced mix comprising debt securities <lb/>(82%), partly offset by a negative position in equity securities (-57%). A breakdown by currency 13 shows <lb/>that a plurality of assets is held in US dollar form, followed fairly closely by those in euros. A majority of <lb/>liabilities is held in Swiss francs, with both dollars and euros well behind. Finally, only a limited <lb/>disaggregation by institutional sector is available, but it shows that over 15% of the net foreign assets <lb/>belong to Swiss banks, just slightly more than what is owned by the SNB. Noteworthy is the steady <lb/>increase in the government&apos;s net foreign liability position in recent years: it rose from around <lb/>CHF 10 billion at end-2001 to CHF 53 billion at end-2006, despite the improvement in the fiscal balance. <lb/>9. <lb/>Part of the reason for weakness in household saving in recent years is the decline in mandatory saving <lb/>whose share of households&apos; gross disposable income fell from over 10% in most of the 1990s to around 7% <lb/>in 2002-04. Voluntary saving took up the slack in 2000-01, keeping the aggregate rate near 16% but has <lb/>likewise fallen back since then, leaving the total rate around 14%. <lb/>10. <lb/>The institutional shares in 2004 were: 44% for financial corporations, 34% for households, 29% for <lb/>non-financial corporations and -7% for general government. <lb/>11. <lb/>Such a large net asset position is nothing new for Switzerland: SNB officials believe it to have been around <lb/>100% of GDP also before World War I. <lb/>12. <lb/>Assets of non-residents managed by banks in Switzerland are of course not included in its net international <lb/>investment position. However, if non-Swiss high net-worth individuals move their economic centre of <lb/>interest to Switzerland (as many have done to take advantage of attractive tax regimes), then their assets <lb/>would, in principle, be considered as Swiss. Nevertheless, the SNB believes that such cases do not play a <lb/>significant role in the evolution of the net foreign asset position, even if they could contribute to its level. <lb/>13. <lb/>The share of foreign-currency assets rose from 62% in 1985 to 87% in 2005 and then edged back to 82% in <lb/>2006, while the share of liabilities in foreign currencies fell in the first decade and then rebounded to 45% <lb/>in 2005 before falling back to 42% in 2006 (SNB, 2007a and 2007b). <lb/>ECO/WKP(2008)2 <lb/></body>

The discrepancy amounts <lb/>to more than CHF 350 billion or about CHF 50 billion per year. Starting two years later, as the <lb/>SNB (2007b) does, leaves a stock-flow discrepancy averaging over CHF 60 billion per year. For example, <lb/>14. <lb/>This was sufficiently puzzling that the SNB decided to include a special section in their annual publication <lb/>on the international investment position dealing with the divergence – see SNB (2007b, pp. 11-13). <lb/></body>

			<body>in 2006 alone, when the financial account recorded an outflow of CHF 91 billion and the current account a <lb/>surplus of CHF 72 billion the SNB shows that the net investment position rose by only CHF 3 billion. <lb/>A number of possible explanations come to mind: <lb/> Valuation changes. Changing exchange rates clearly prevent the change in the stocks from <lb/>equalling the flows. Since most assets are in foreign currency and most liabilities in francs, it is <lb/>clear that if the franc appreciates the value of Swiss holdings will suffer the consequences. From <lb/>1999 to 2006 an increase of the exchange rate was indeed observed. According to the <lb/>SNB (2007b), such exchange-rate losses have been worth an average of CHF 28 billion since <lb/>2002. Secondly, and this may be the major explanation for the outcomes in 2005 and 2006, there <lb/>are valuation gains and losses on foreign holdings of equity in Switzerland and on Swiss holdings <lb/>of equity abroad. In a longer-term perspective, according to Stoffels and Tille (2007), such <lb/>valuation effects can explain only a part (around 30%) of the discrepancy on the net position <lb/>(with 23% and 7% attributable to exchange rates and asset prices fluctuations, respectively). With <lb/>direct investment at estimated market values (and not at book values as in international <lb/>investment position statistics), their calculations show that valuation effects are somewhat more <lb/>successful, accounting for almost exactly half of the total to be explained. For its part, the <lb/>SNB (2007b) attributes more than CHF 20 billion per year to such capital losses (about one-third <lb/>of the total). <lb/> Measurement problems. One obvious distortion is that official Swiss data are calculated using <lb/>only book-value estimates for foreign direct investment. However, Stoffels and Tille (2007) <lb/>attempt an approximation to a market-value adjustment and find that the correction would go the <lb/>wrong way: the net position would actually worsen by 33.8% of 2005 GDP, rather than the small <lb/>improvement in the official data. 15 Other methodological questions arise from the SNB&apos;s periodic <lb/>improvements to their procedures. For example, the survey used to estimate direct investment <lb/>positions was broadened in 2004, resulting in a CHF 11.3 billion reduction in net foreign assets <lb/>(some 2.5 % of 2005 GDP), without any corresponding change in the financial flows (Stoffels <lb/>and Tille, 2007, footnote 24). 16 Overall, SNB (2007b) argued that once valuation changes are <lb/>properly accounted for, only CHF 12 billion per year of non-identified changes remain (less than <lb/>a quarter of the total). Similarly, the flow data might have missed certain items, such as the <lb/>repayment of principal on foreign bonds at maturity. This would be consistent with the sizeable <lb/>positive errors and omissions in the balance of payments (an excess of net financial outflows over <lb/>the current-account surplus, abstracting from capital transfers). <lb/>Taking the valuation effects year by year it appears that exchange-rate changes played a fairly <lb/>important role in 2001-04 and 2006, but franc depreciation in 2005 goes in the wrong direction. Broad <lb/>indexes of asset prices point to underperformance for Swiss investors abroad relative to foreigners in <lb/>15. <lb/>The Stoffels and Tille approach was to adjust assets and liabilities for valuation changes using broad share <lb/>price indexes. For direct investment holdings by foreign investors the Swiss share price index was <lb/>appropriately used. However, they used share price indexes of relevant destination countries for Swiss <lb/>direct investments abroad, this during a period (1999-2005) when the latter fell while the former rose. It is <lb/>debatable whether such indexes would have been an unbiased depiction of the underlying value of those <lb/>holdings. It might even be argued that Swiss share prices might have been a better indicator of such price <lb/>movements. <lb/>16. <lb/>Since 1999, several other significant statistical revisions affecting Switzerland&apos;s international investment <lb/>position have taken place. Also, sometimes funds are moved in and out of the country without <lb/>corresponding financial flows; this too could help explain some of the discrepancy. <lb/></body>

			<body>Switzerland mainly in 2000, 2005 and 2006. Notice, however, that prior to 1998 the financial flows on <lb/>some holdings were essentially computed as the change in positions (Stoffels and Tille, 2007). <lb/>The next question to be considered arising from this disconnect is what are the implications for the <lb/>returns that the nation is earning. These returns comprise the straightforward yields, as measured in the <lb/>investment income accounts, plus the valuation changes. Stoffels and Tille (2007) show that, taking the <lb/>six years 2000 to 2005, yields alone were higher on Swiss assets than on its liabilities by more than a full <lb/>percentage point, 17 much as it has been for the United States (Jarrett, 2005). However, once just measured <lb/>valuation gains and losses are brought into the picture, their estimate of the gap becomes -0.8 percentage <lb/>point. Hence, if these figures are to be believed, Swiss investors who placed money abroad for portfolio <lb/>diversification and rate-of-return considerations fared much worse than foreign investors who bet on the <lb/>Swiss market, even though the latter heavily reflects returns in the already mature and capital-intensive <lb/>Swiss economy <lb/>What could be causing this huge surplus? <lb/>Since the current-account surplus is such a long-standing feature of the Swiss external accounts, <lb/>whatever is causing it cannot be entirely a recent phenomenon. But until the last 15 years or so it averaged <lb/>less than 4% of GDP, a figure that is frequently seen in many other OECD countries. It is truly the upsurge <lb/>since the early 1990s that is unusual and demanding of interpretation. As seen above, the nation&apos;s saving <lb/>rate increased from 1992 to 2000, then plunged before rebounding. But it is – at some 36% of GDP in <lb/>2005 – amongst the highest in the OECD (along with Norway and Korea), some three times as high as <lb/>those near the bottom of the scale (though the official Swiss figure is probably biased up by the <lb/>aforementioned measurement error). To what might this be attributed? Unlike Norway, whose current <lb/>income level is undoubtedly in excess of long-term levels thanks to its oil revenues, it would not normally <lb/>make sense to seek a &quot; permanent income &quot; view of the surplus. Theoretically, differential demographics <lb/>could help to explain some of the gap, but the evidence is fairly clear that the speed of future ageing <lb/>pressures is no more rapid in Switzerland than elsewhere in the OECD, arguably less so (OECD, 2006a). <lb/>There are some more promising lines of reasoning, however. First, it is well known that Switzerland <lb/>has a well developed system of mandatory second-pillar retirement saving. Such saving represents half of <lb/>overall household saving and about 15% of gross national saving, though its share was much greater in the <lb/>1990s. These pension funds (along with life insurance investments) held assets worth more than 150% of <lb/>GDP already in 2004, the highest GDP share in the OECD. Around 44% of those assets were held abroad <lb/>at that point, the majority of which in foreign currencies. There is no need as yet to disburse the earnings <lb/>on these holdings, and it would be difficult to find attractive investment opportunities for them on domestic <lb/>markets. Second, there is a multiplicative component to the first, as the corresponding tax burden is shifted <lb/>forward in time: the typical regime in Switzerland for taxing retirement saving is EET (i.e. contributions, <lb/>accrued returns and ultimate pension payments are exempt, exempt and taxable, respectively), which is <lb/>generous but not unusual (and this generosity might not have much effect on national saving, <lb/>17. <lb/>For the most recent five years SNB figures show that Swiss investors earned average annual returns of 4% <lb/>on their foreign assets, but only 2.5% once direct investment (9.9%) is excluded. <lb/></body>

But even an <lb/>unremarkable regime may be unusual when combined with a large mandatory component. Furthermore, <lb/>pension savings are not subject to estate duties (OECD, 1999, Box 1). And because there is no capital gains <lb/>tax on portfolio investment by households and pension funds, 19 saving is treated more generously than in <lb/>countries having such a tax. Third, since most foreign assets are denominated in foreign currencies, whose <lb/>emitters have traditionally had higher interest rates than Switzerland (in order to compensate investors for <lb/>their higher average inflation rates), and, conversely, most liabilities are in Swiss francs, part of the net <lb/>inflow of interest income (and the higher national saving that is its counterpart) is merely what amounts to <lb/>a return of capital to Swiss lenders. According to unpublished central-bank estimates, this could be as <lb/>much as CHF 20 billion per year (4.4% of GDP, around one quarter of the total current-account surplus). <lb/>On the other hand, however, when the saving does not involve foreign assets, it is to expected real <lb/>domestic interest rates and returns that saving responds. While ex ante rates are difficult to observe, ex post <lb/>real rates in Switzerland have traditionally been low by OECD standards, but that gap, at least for <lb/>long-term government bonds, fell sharply about a decade ago, and local rates are now virtually <lb/>indistinguishable from the OECD average when measured – even if crudely – using only a single period&apos;s <lb/>inflation rate (Figure 5). 20 Hence, perhaps there has been some increase in relative incentives to save, <lb/>18. <lb/>The force of this argument may be less in the Swiss case, since its strong budget-balance rules have <lb/>arguably restrained any resulting public dis-saving. <lb/>19. <lb/>Capital gains by households are hardly ever taxable when money is put into shares of companies listed on <lb/>the stock exchange, as these companies may be considered as ever lasting. The situation becomes much <lb/>more complicated in all other circumstances. In any case, all cantons have capital gains taxes on real estate. <lb/>20. <lb/>There is a growing literature that has looked at the question of international equalisation of real rates of <lb/>return on financial assets. It shows that such returns are indeed equalised for equities but not for <lb/>fixed-income instruments nor deposits: those denominated in Swiss francs have earned significantly lower <lb/>returns, even in the long run (Kugler and Weder, 2003). This violation of real interest-rate parity is found <lb/>to be due to a failure of uncovered interest rate parity even in the long run, rather than to deviations from <lb/>purchasing power parity: the Swiss franc does not appreciate enough to offset the short-term interest rate <lb/>differential. This is unique among major currencies (Kugler and Weder, 2005), even if other creditor <lb/>countries also experience some degree of home bias. Global investors seem willing to pay a premium for <lb/>possibly three reasons: first, because there has been less price-level uncertainty for Swiss assets, because <lb/>the monetary authorities have kept inflation so low; second, because Swiss franc assets seem to provide <lb/>unique diversification benefits (Kugler and Weder, 2004); and, third, so as to avoid the effects of very rare <lb/></body>

			<body>resulting from a reduced willingness of foreigners to hold Swiss assets at lower expected real rates of <lb/>return. Finally, saving can include a precautionary motive, in which case it should respond positively to <lb/>income volatility. An admittedly imperfect proxy for that would be the volatility of real GDP growth. <lb/>Using the standard deviation of real growth (Figure 6), it can be seen that Switzerland&apos;s economy is less <lb/>volatile than the average but that its advantage has been diminishing steadily and has effectively <lb/>disappeared during the past year or two. Even that measure is not uniquely identified, however, as the <lb/>standard deviation suffers from a scaling problem: using the coefficient of variation instead, Switzerland&apos;s <lb/>volatility has in fact been mostly greater than in the average OECD country. <lb/>In a longer-term perspective, the modest level of Switzerland&apos;s investment rate also looks worthy of <lb/>interest: the investment share of GDP fell sharply during the early-1990s recession (by about 8 percentage <lb/>points of GDP), remained fairly steady during the subsequent upswing and then declined again in the most <lb/>recent downturn, reaching a level little more than 20% of GDP. The average OECD country followed a <lb/>similar pattern, but its declines were far more modest and the rebounds sharper. Thus, Switzerland shifted <lb/>from being a higher-than-average investor to a sub-par investor initially in 1999 and then more <lb/>emphatically from 2003. By 2004-05 its shortfall from the simple average of OECD countries was more <lb/>than a full percentage point of GDP, a switch of 6 percentage points since 1990. <lb/>Figure 6. Volatility in real GDP growth <lb/>Four quarterly growth <lb/>1. <lb/>The standard deviation divided by the mean. <lb/>Source: OECD. <lb/>catastrophic events (such as a war) that they perceive would have an asymmetric impact on Swiss assets <lb/>because of the nation&apos;s long-standing neutrality. Concretely, if such a shock were to transpire, the Swiss <lb/>franc would be expected to appreciate, perhaps sharply. Another explanation – that the premium is <lb/>attributable to Swiss banking secrecy – is less convincing, since the return anomaly is also present in Swiss <lb/>franc Euro-deposits, which are beyond the reach of Swiss law. Finally, if the explanation were to lie with <lb/>real structural factors such as higher capital intensity with decreasing marginal returns or productivity <lb/>differences between the tradeables and non-tradeables sectors (Balassa-Samuelson-type effects), it would <lb/>be purchasing power parity that would fail to hold, since the real exchange-rate appreciation would be <lb/>sufficient to explain the failure of uncovered interest parity. In any case, what has not yet been researched <lb/>is to what extent the lower-returns phenomenon still holds: the data used by the cited authors to establish it <lb/>covered the period 1980 to 2003, but the &quot; carry trade &quot; really got underway only at the very end of the <lb/>sample period; the franc was falling from 2003 to 2007; and there was a steady shorting of the franc in <lb/>futures markets as from 2005 (see footnote 26 below). The time since the last major global disruption <lb/>continues to lengthen, and investors surely attribute an ever-declining probability of any recurrence. <lb/></body>

			<body>In many quarters in Switzerland it is believed that the low investment rate is explained by the <lb/>country&apos;s maturity and income level: it is argued that the prospective returns on capital are likely to be <lb/>lower in Switzerland than in many other parts of the world because the existing capital stock is already <lb/>high in relation to output levels. However, the evidence linking investment rates and income levels is <lb/>moderate, though Switzerland does not appear to be an outlier. 21 Also, while official statistical agencies <lb/>make different methodological assumptions to generate aggregate national capital stock series, 22 and hence <lb/>substantial caution in making international comparisons is called for, it can be seen that indeed capital <lb/>intensity seems rather high in Switzerland. 23 The question that remains is why a mature economy cannot <lb/>exploit its central location and well educated labour force, along with well developed financial markets to <lb/>sustain fairly high rates of investment. Low investment at home may be attributable more to a lack of <lb/>effective competition (in economists&apos; terms: &quot; the quiet life &quot; for incumbents, who try to reduce supply so as <lb/>to raise prices) – which may or may not be linked to weak or even negative capital productivity growth – <lb/>and poor prospects for new entrants in existing industries (network industries in particular), as well as in <lb/>innovative sunrise sectors (Alesina et al., 2003; OECD, 2006b). However, it may also be explained in part <lb/>by: i) a reduction in risk premia abroad, owing primarily to successful disinflation, that has led to some <lb/>diversion of global capital flows away from Switzerland; and ii) the high price level, which encourages <lb/>servicing the Swiss market by exports from abroad rather than inward direct investment, thus limiting <lb/>gross fixed capital formation. <lb/>Another approach in trying to explain the enormity of the surplus is to look at its components and of <lb/>absorption in particular. As seen above, the growing size of Switzerland&apos;s current-account surplus is only <lb/>to a small extent attributable to its goods and non-factor services accounts, on which surpluses have grown <lb/>due to slower Swiss GDP growth than in major trading partners as well as a trend improvement in Swiss <lb/>competitiveness. Export performance was very strong until 1985, but thereafter it weakened steadily. In <lb/>effect the gains in competitiveness due to the steadily lower rate of inflation were offset by increases in the <lb/>Swiss franc&apos;s exchange rate. The franc appreciated at an average rate of some 4% per year from 1970 <lb/>to 2003, but most of that was offset by the favourable CPI inflation differential, leaving an average annual <lb/>real rise of some 1¼ per cent. However, beginning around 2002-03 the trend appreciation came to an end, <lb/>and the deterioration in export performance did likewise a year or two later. 24 Following the franc&apos;s peak in <lb/>early 2003 it fell cumulatively by around 8% in nominal effective terms and by 12% in real (CPI) effective <lb/>terms until its trough in late 2007; since then it has recovered a good bit of that fall. The result is that there <lb/>were then claims that the franc was somewhat undervalued: the IMF (2007), for example, stated that it may <lb/>have been up to 20% undervalued, even if its equilibrium may have fallen because it may no longer be <lb/>seen to the same extent as a safe-haven currency and it clearly is little used any more as an official reserve <lb/>currency. 25 <lb/>21. <lb/>Regressing the investment/GDP ratio in current prices on per capita GDP in purchasing-power parities <lb/>across the 30 OECD Member countries for the average values from 2000 to 2005 in either linear or <lb/>log-linear form results in a marginally significant negative coefficient on per capita output with a t-ratio of <lb/>close to 2 and a very small positive residual for Switzerland. Reverse causality may bias the coefficient <lb/>estimate towards zero. <lb/>22. <lb/>It would be even more dubious to try to compare ex ante rates of return to capital across countries. <lb/>23. <lb/>An additional reason for caution here, however, is that the OECD has shifted away from the use of capital <lb/>stock series in its modelling exercises in favour of a capital-services approach (Beffy et al., 2006). But no <lb/>such data existed for Switzerland until very recently. <lb/>24. <lb/>In fact, preliminary data for recent quarters show a steady improvement in export performance and in the <lb/>trade balance: in 2007 it reached CHF 13.9 billion, 76% higher than the 2005 outcome. <lb/>25. <lb/>Recent work at the BIS (Cairns et al., 2007) shows that the franc remains the currency of choice (along <lb/>with the euro) when volatility increases. Nevertheless, BIS figures show the franc&apos;s share of global reserve <lb/>holdings had already fallen to negligible levels by the mid-1990s (Wooldridge, 2006). <lb/></body>

			<body>The &quot; carry trade &quot; is the label given to the transactions that involve (often leveraged) borrowing of <lb/>low-yielding currencies like the franc and more particularly the yen in favour of assets denominated in <lb/>high-return currencies such as the New Zealand dollar but also those from emerging markets. Of course, <lb/>normally low-yielding currencies are expected to appreciate, else nobody would willingly hold them, but in <lb/>recent years various classes of investors have been willing to take on the currency risk and undertake such <lb/>trading without hedging. 26 Indeed, the common element between trading in the yen and the franc can be <lb/>demonstrated by looking at daily exchange-rate changes for the two monies: for the past five and a half <lb/>years these have become significantly positively correlated, whereas previously there had been no such <lb/>relationship (Figure 7). The result of the increase in carry trading is that the stock of outstanding bank <lb/>lending in francs to foreign non-bank private borrowers is estimated to have reached some $138 billion at <lb/>end-September 2006, up from a steady $35 to $40 billion during the decade ending in 1998. Of course risk <lb/>appetites do change, but even though most analysts have been predicting a return to form for the franc for <lb/>quite some time – in part because the SNB has been busily putting up its official rates – the temptation to <lb/>maintain the heretofore profitable strategy was sufficient to sustain it until late in 2007. And franc <lb/>weakness began to worry SNB senior officials who took note of its direct impact on Switzerland&apos;s import <lb/>prices and its indirect effect on tradeables prices more generally (McCormick, 2007). But with the <lb/>intensifying global financial turmoil of recent months, many investors seem to have unwound their bets <lb/>against the franc, and it has rebounded against the euro and surged against the dollar. <lb/>While in the yen&apos;s case, the purchased assets are to be found around the world, it seems that most of <lb/>the franc borrowing has ended up in mortgage and other private lending in Central and Eastern Europe, <lb/>especially in Austria, 27 Hungary, Croatia and Poland. Most of this has been undertaken by Austrian banks; <lb/>Swiss banks are believed to have limited direct exposure. But apparently franc-denominated lending has <lb/>even become popular in Denmark, with outstanding loans reaching DKR 20 billion (nearly 3 billion euros) <lb/>in 2006 (Bernstein, 2007). In any case, it could be argued that transactions involving borrowing by <lb/>residents of a high interest-rate country in a low-yielding currency like the franc to purchase domestic <lb/>assets are qualitatively different from leveraged activities by financial players typically involving <lb/>derivative contracts, if only because the investments are not likely to be unwound quickly (BIS, 2007). <lb/>26. <lb/>Indeed, some investors go so far as to short low-yielding currencies to speculate that the carry trade will <lb/>dominate longer-run fundamentals. Swiss franc futures contracts on the Chicago Mercantile <lb/>Exchange (CME) were showing a substantial net non-commercial short position outstanding in 2005-07. <lb/>Indeed, the magnitude of that net position reached a record level of nearly 80 000 contracts on <lb/>19 June 2007, which, at a value of CHF 125 000 per contract, implied a bet of nearly CHF 10 billion <lb/>against the franc. Higher CME short positions have tended to presage downward movements in the <lb/>currency against the dollar. <lb/>27. <lb/>Tzanninis (2005) points out that loans to Austrian households in foreign currencies have surged since the <lb/>mid-1990s, reaching nearly 30 billion euros (30% of outstanding loans) by early 2005. Nearly all of these <lb/>loans are in Swiss francs. Franc-denominated loans to all non-banks totalled more than 40 billion euros <lb/>already at that point. <lb/></body>

The yen and Swiss franc have moved together in the past five years¹ <lb/>1. <lb/>Correlation coefficient between daily exchange-rate changes of the dollar/yen and dollar/Swiss franc in a rolling <lb/>one-year window ending in the quarter in question. <lb/>Source: OECD. <lb/>The implications for public policy <lb/>To sum up to this point: Switzerland has an unusually large current-account surplus which, even <lb/>though it implies a possible disequilibrium, is clearly not something that elicits sustainability concerns, <lb/>since there is no limit to a nation&apos;s acquisition of net foreign assets. If there are indeed fundamental drivers <lb/>such as differences in rates of time preference between Swiss and foreigners, then policy-makers should <lb/>look no further. However, even though no evidence is available on this question, it would be unwise to rely <lb/>entirely on the existence of such differences. It is more likely that it is long-standing differences in Swiss <lb/>policy-settings and institutions that have created the favourable conditions for saving, if not the reluctance <lb/>in recent years to engage in investment. So long as these settings are deemed appropriate once carefully <lb/>examined, then there is no separate reason to change policy or to take specific measures to bring the <lb/>current surplus down. If it declines because policy improvements generate faster trend growth, which <lb/>stimulates both investment and imports, then that is all well and good. Yet it must be recognised that the <lb/>potential to achieve lasting changes in external balances through structural reforms is probably fairly <lb/>limited (Kennedy and Sløk, 2005). <lb/>One angle that justifies explicit thinking about the surplus is its role in determining the real exchange <lb/>rate. A higher surplus would normally lead to a stronger currency to ensure long-run balance of payments <lb/>equilibrium. But the carry trade has driven down the value of the franc, possibly to an unsustainable <lb/>level. 28 If at some point Swiss holders of its huge foreign assets decide to repatriate them at a rapid pace or <lb/>foreign investors choose quite suddenly to unwind their carry-trade positions – possibly because of a drop <lb/>in risk appetite and increase in volatility 29 or because the SNB moves more aggressively to raise interest <lb/>rates – then the franc exchange rate would appreciate and could even spike higher, as happened to the yen <lb/>and the franc in the second half of 1998 and has been hinted at in recent months. This might call for quick <lb/>28. <lb/>There has also probably been a reverse mechanism at work: by causing a depreciation, the carry trade has <lb/>no doubt led to an increase in the size of the surplus itself, through a rise in net exports of goods and <lb/>services associated with improved competitiveness and through higher net factor income. <lb/>29. <lb/>For a useful, detailed look at the current state of the carry trade see Nordvig (2007). He argues that reduced <lb/>global risk appetite could pose a challenge to carry-trading strategies, especially as the compensation for <lb/>currency risk looks to have diminished to very unattractive levels for investments in G10 currencies, <lb/>though not for those of emerging markets. <lb/></body>

			<body>action on the part of the monetary authorities to stabilise the economy, since such a shock would have <lb/>important deflationary consequences. But the implications for some sectors could be serious, even if <lb/>contractionary aggregate consequences were avoided. Blanchard (2007) has recently argued in a different <lb/>context that, after several years of depressed output, producers of non-tradeables might have permanently <lb/>lower productivity through hysteresis effects and might also lack the wherewithal (financial and other) to <lb/>expand in response to the price signals. That might be taken as a justification for some redirected <lb/>budgetary spending to non-tradeables sectors and to investment in particular. <lb/>Assuming the new, higher level of the franc was fairly rapidly seen as quasi-permanent, then the <lb/>resulting drop in the demand for exports and import-competing goods and services would lead to pressures <lb/>for restructuring. It is therefore crucial – so as to be as well prepared for such an outcome as possible – that <lb/>Swiss markets be flexible and that factors be mobile both geographically and sectorally. Fortunately, <lb/>available evidence points to a very high degree of economic resilience due to well developed and flexible <lb/>financial markets and a moderate degree of labour-and product-market regulation (Duval et al., 2007). <lb/>Specific policy implications are as follows: <lb/> In terms of labour markets, that implies: first, that employee protection rules and legislation be <lb/>designed – as is the case – with a view to assisting individuals and not protecting jobs; second, <lb/>that stamp duties on housing transactions not act as a barrier to the sale of a home that is <lb/>necessitated by a shift in the owner&apos;s employment; third, that cantonal occupational licensing <lb/>requirements be suppressed in favour of a mutual recognition/single passport approach; fourth, <lb/>that immigration be recognised as especially valuable, since immigrants are more mobile within <lb/>the country and admission is sensitive to the need for specific skills; and, finally, that added focus <lb/>be placed on training and general (as opposed to firm-specific) skills in this context of shifting <lb/>economic needs. <lb/> As to capital markets, policies should focus on encouraging financial-market participants to boost <lb/>their funding of start-ups and other youthful firms, since it is through such entities that <lb/>inter-sectoral shifts proceed the most smoothly. Similarly, bankruptcy customs and law should not <lb/>be designed so as to hold resources in sectors exposed to negative long-term structural shifts. 30 In <lb/>addition, tax and corporate governance rules should likewise not discourage exit or redeployment: <lb/>in that regard the classical treatment of dividends in the tax law probably acts to hold resources <lb/>within firms and thus, at the margin, within existing industries. Bringing in a ceiling on the tax <lb/>deductibility of second-pillar saving (to the lowest statutory rate) might help to treat saving in <lb/>low-risk assets in a less favourable fashion. But the temptation to use tax policy to directly <lb/>stimulate investment should be resisted, especially if the support were aimed squarely at housing, <lb/>where many OECD countries are overly generous. <lb/> In product markets it is crucial for firms to be able to enter new markets, and hence the <lb/>competition authorities must be vigilant to the creation or maintenance of artificial barriers to entry <lb/>by incumbents, which can significantly restrict investment (Alesina et al., 2003). In regulated <lb/>sectors, especially network industries, sectoral regulators must also keep a watchful eye. Policies <lb/>that hold output in a given sector, such as inheritance rules applied to farmers or the <lb/>aforementioned double taxation of dividends, are especially harmful. <lb/>30. <lb/>The authorities hope to reform the bankruptcy law during the next legislature. <lb/></body>
