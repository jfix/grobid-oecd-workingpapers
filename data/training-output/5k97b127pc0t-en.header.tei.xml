	<div type="abstract">ABSTRACT<lb/> State and local governments in OECD countries have access to a variety of fiscal resources.<lb/> Discretion over these resources varies considerably, and so does sub-central governments&apos; power to shape<lb/> public service delivery. The design of fiscal autonomy affects sub-central government&apos;s behaviour and<lb/> determines outcomes like public sector efficiency, equity in access to public services or the long term fiscal<lb/> stance. This paper provides data and interpretation on the fiscal resources of sub-central government in<lb/> OECD countries. It presents a set of fiscal autonomy indicators such as revenue and expenditure<lb/> decentralisation, tax autonomy, intergovernmental grants and the stringency of fiscal rules. In sum, the<lb/> statistics show that taxes are still the most significant revenue source for subcentral governments but that<lb/> only a part is under their effective control. Fiscal autonomy is further reduced by a high percentage of<lb/> earmarked grants. The design of fiscal federalism varies considerably across countries, and factor analysis<lb/> reveals almost no correlation between different fiscal autonomy indicators. Indeed, &quot; fiscal autonomy &quot;<lb/> appears to have several dimensions.<lb/> JEL Classification: H71, H74, H77<lb/></div>
