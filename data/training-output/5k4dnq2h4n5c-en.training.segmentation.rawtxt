official statisticians, worked at identifying the various data sources that could be utilised at national level to 
build registers of doctoral graduates or produce statistical data. The expert group also worked with the 
three intergovernmental organisations to develop the three components of the technical guidelines: a model 
survey questionnaire, methodological guidelines and a set of output tables for collecting data at 
international level. After a pilot in 2005, two large scale data collections were conducted in 2007 and 2010 in which 25 
countries participated each time and a rich set of data was made available and analysed. 1 Over the 2011-2012 bienium, the OECD activity on CDH has been partly sponsored by the European 
Union's Seventh Framework Programme as part of the broad OECD KNOWINNO project. This supported 
the development of the CDH database and indicators, the exploitation of CDH micro data and the revision 
of the present guidelines. In the context of the 2010 CDH data collection cycle, the OECD has attempted to encourage the use of 
microdata for purposes other than benchmark-type indicator construction and reporting, although 
participation in this strand of work was constrained to a limited number of countries. Co-ordinated 
microdata analysis can potentially secure policy relevant insights by discriminating between competing 
explanations for observed patterns of research demand and supply in a way that indicators cannot. With very limited exceptions, CDH microdata remain by and large inaccessible to a very large pool of 
potentially interested researchers. Countries should seriously consider the possibility of (a) anonymised 
data being made available in standard research microdata repositories; (b) encouraging data linking to 
other information such as bibliometrics data from within secure data enclaves; (c) encoding available 
information such as company names to identify industrial activity codes and other information which are 
currently missing from most surveys' digitised data. This working paper presents the third edition of the technical guidelines used in the framework of the 
CDH project. Numerous comments and interactions with the participating countries following the 2007 
and 2010 data collections have allowed adjustments to be made to the definitions used, wording of the 
survey questions, presentation of the output tables, data to be reported and other methodological aspects. In 
particular, this edition has benefitted from in-depth comments from the participants to the 2011-2012 EU 
FP7 funded KNOWINNO project and presents new ways to measure competencies and skills of doctorate 
holders through their knowledge, attributes and behaviours both at the time of their advanced research 
degree completion and in their current employment. This working paper is thus aimed at providing guidance to the countries that wish to participate in the 
next CDH data collection exercise. It is also expected that new experiences with the model survey and 
comparative analysis of the data, as they become available, will continue to shape the CDH guidelines in 
the future. 1.

INTRODUCTION Statistics on careers of doctorate holders (Statistics on CDH) are compiled with a view to measure the 
demographic, employment, international and intra-sectoral mobility, career and earnings characteristics of 
holders of advanced research qualifications at national and international level. In the present document, we 
use the term  " doctorate holders "  for persons with an advanced research qualification, in possession of an 
ISCED 1997 level 6 degree. These statistics aim to answer questions about international mobility, which is an important aspect of 
the labour of highly skilled workers and frequently referred to as brain drain, brain gain, or brain 
circulation. In addition, issues about the qualitative and quantitative match of the education of doctorate 
holders with the labour market are addressed. These statistics also deal with questions on how well the 
competencies of the highest educated are used by the society as well as with the attractiveness of different 
career paths for doctorate holders. Such questions are of interest at the worldwide level. Based on an output-harmonised approach, the tabulated data to be delivered by countries to 
international organisations may be compiled using different methodological approaches. Already existing 
national surveys can often be used, which sometimes may need to be complemented or extended. These 
guidelines therefore provide the general framework for national data production. On the one hand, the guidelines should help countries to improve and align their national survey 
methodologies. On the other hand, countries that are newly introducing CDH surveys will find directions 
on how to do this at national level. DSTI/DOC(2012)7 12 2. 
PURPOSE OF STATISTICS ON CDH 2.1 
Why doctorate holders? Doctorate holders are the most highly educated group, and as such considered to have a high potential 
to contribute to the advancement and diffusion of knowledge and technologies. They are often seen as key 
actors behind the creation of innovation and knowledge-based economic growth. CDH statistics mainly focus on doctorate holders, but the same type of statistics may of course be 
collected for other types of  " highly qualified people " . This could for example be the case in some 
developing countries where highly qualified non-doctorate holders may constitute a crucial part of the S&T 
workforce and thus a target group of policy interest. Some OECD countries have even started collecting 
similar information for university graduates below the doctoral level. 2.2 
Needs expressed by users The user needs for statistics on CDH were thoroughly discussed during a series of workshops between 
2003 and 2011. One of the aims of these workshops was to define links between research questions and data needs 
thus setting the objectives for the data collection of statistics on CDH. The policy questions of interest at 
the national and international level are summarised under the following four headings: @BULLET The role of doctorate holders in innovation and the knowledge economy Where do doctorate holders work as compared to other tertiary graduates? Do they follow research 
careers and in what sector and field? @BULLET Labour market supply and demand Do we train too many or too few doctorate holders? Are there mismatches in the labour market? 
Why do doctorate holders choose a research career in the public sector, or in the private sector or 
leave research? What is their perception of career opportunities and employment in the public 
versus the private sector? Do they earn more than the average citizen and which sectors of 
employment are the most profitable? @BULLET Education to work How long is the time of transition to employment or post doctoral experience? How related is the 
job to the doctoral degree? @BULLET Mobility How mobile are doctorate holders between sectors? When do doctorate holders leave research for 
a career in management? How big are the flows of doctorate holders between countries? How 
common is it for doctorate holders to reside in a country on a non-permanent basis? What are the 
reasons for doctorate holders to return to their country of origin? DSTI/DOC(2012)7 13 With CDH statistics, policy makers should get much better information to address these questions. 
Countries will be able to share information at the international level, having their expatriates covered in the 
doctoral population observed by other countries. 2.3 
The output harmonisation approach As national data compilation methods may be heterogeneous between countries, reflecting the 
diversity of national statistical systems, a harmonisation effort is conducted on the output of the CDH 
statistics together with a quality control. The aim is therefore to obtain high quality results through a harmonised list of variables and 
indicators, together with their related definitions. The methodological guidelines additionally provide 
guidance on the target population, sampling frames, sampling design, survey instruments etc. that should 
be adopted at the national level. 2.4 
Output tables and national methodology description The output tables to be compiled by countries consist of about 41 predefined tables available as Excel 
spreadsheets, to be compiled at national level only. A preliminary table is included to fill in metadata and country specificities, like reference year, data 
collection method, coverage issues, contact details for institution and person responsible for CDH 
statistics. The tables are organised in five broad groups, dealing with different aspects of doctorate holders. 
This set of tables is expected to evolve as the project develops. @BULLET Personal characteristics P1-P8 Break down the population of doctorate holders according to personal characteristics like age, sex, 
country of citizenship and country of birth. @BULLET Educational characteristics ED1-ED6 Information on the educational history of the doctorate holders: the population of doctorate holders 
is broken down by country of doctorate award, country of prior education, field of doctorate degree 
and source of funding during completion of doctorate. The compilation of average and median age 
and number of years to completion of the doctoral degree are also part of the tables, as well as 
information on the acquisition of certain competencies. @BULLET Labour force status and employment characteristics EMP1-EMP10/PERC1-PERC2 Employment characteristics of doctorate holders, such as employment status (situation in 
employment, type of contract, working time), employment in research, institutional sector, median 
and average gross annual earnings, job mobility, competencies. Data on doctorate holders' 
perception of work and satisfaction are also requested in this group of tables. @BULLET International mobility: Inward and outward IMOB1-IMOB4/OMOB1-OMOB2 (outward tables are 
optional) Tables on inward mobility collect information on the international mobile population of doctorate 
holders according to their previous country of residence, their reasons for moving into or returning 
to the country and the frequency and length of their mobility (either reported in number of years or 
in number of months). Tables on outward mobility present the population of doctorate holders 
broken down according to their intention and reasons to move out of the country in the next year. DSTI/DOC(2012)7 14 @BULLET Scientific output OUTP1-OUTP2. The scientific output of doctorate holders during the last three years in terms of total number of 
articles, books, patents, start-up companies and commercialisation of patents. For each output table, two columns are allocated to each variable, the first one to enter the data, the 
second one devoted to standard flags attached to selected data. Reporting countries are invited to 
use the flags where relevant in the columns next to the data when filling in the output tables. At the end of each separate table, space is also allocated to enter information on data sources and 
applied definitions and classifications. Where relevant, the variables from the questionnaire that 
were used should be reported. Countries are also asked to provide additional information on the 
statistical surveys and administrative data sources used in a separate document, the national 
methodology description (Annex 2). This metadata information together with the preliminary table 
information is critical to interpret the data in the tabulations. DSTI/DOC(2012)7 15 3. 
THE TARGET POPULATION 3.1 
Introduction The target population is a decisive element of the international comparability of CDH statistics. The 
survey frame and the statistics itself are often put together from different national sources and surveys, 
each with its own survey population. Different countries are at different stages of development of the CDH statistics as regards the full 
coverage of the target population. In a transitional phase where countries make efforts to fully implement 
the methodological guidelines, incomplete coverage of the target population is accepted. This is however at 
the expense of comparability of the data between countries. Care should be taken to limit incomplete 
coverage as the project evolves and national practices are harmonised. 3.2 
Definition of the target population The total target population of the CDH statistics consists of all individuals with an education at 
ISCED 1997 level 6. This global population of holders of advanced research qualifications is divided into 
national populations, which are considered the target populations of national surveys in each country. The 
national target populations consist of individuals that at the reference date are fulfilling the following 
criteria: @BULLET having an education at ISCED 1997 level 6 (doctorate) obtained anywhere in the world, and 
@BULLET being resident (permanent or non-permanent) within the national borders of the surveying country. With these definitions and the (theoretical) assumption that all countries are conducting the survey 
and using the same date of reference, the whole population of doctorate holders resident in all countries is 
covered without any overlaps. 3.3 
Reference year The recommended reference year is 2012. 3.4 
Reference day The recommended reference day, i.e. point in time to which the measured observation (e.g. length of 
stay in the reporting country) refers, is 1 December of the year before the year that the survey is conducted 
at national level. The recommended reference day therefore for the 2013 data collection is 1 December 
2012. In exceptional cases, the data compiling country is free to choose another reference date, but it 
should preferably be chosen as close to 1 December as possible, between 1 October and 31 December. DSTI/DOC(2012)7 16 3.5 
Reference periods For the sake of international comparability, it is recommended that countries collect data in a way that 
the requested reference periods are equal to calendar years and start or end as close to the reference date as 
possible. 3.6 
Statistical units The statistical unit is the single individual having a formal education at ISCED 1997 level 6 (awarded 
doctorate) and being resident (permanent or non-permanent) in the reporting country on the reference date. 3.7 
The age dimension Countries should only include doctorate holders with an age below 70 years (i.e. up to 69 years old) in 
the target population. Although many highly skilled people tend to work, and contribute to society with 
skills and knowledge at higher ages, one of the main aims of the CDH data collection is to look at the 
situation of doctorate holders in the labour force (i.e. before retirement). If countries want to study doctorate holders over 70, they should be sampled separately and not 
reported in the output tables. Countries should leave this category out of the figures reported as national 
totals. 3.8 
Active and inactive doctorate holders The national target population should include economically active doctorate holders as well as the 
economically inactive as long as they are below the age limit. DSTI/DOC(2012)7 17 3.9 
Structure of the target population The population of doctorate holders residing in the surveying (country X) is structured in four broad 
groups namely: Target population, residents in country X: A. Citizens of country X with a doctorate awarded within country X. 
B. Citizens of foreign countries with a doctorate awarded in country X. 
C. Citizens of country X with a doctorate awarded abroad. 
D. Citizens of foreign countries with a doctorate awarded abroad. Two additional groups of doctorate holders related to, but not belonging to the target population of 
country X, are defined as follows: Non-target population, residents outside country X: E. Citizens of country X with a doctorate awarded within country X who have left country X. 
F. Citizens of foreign countries with a doctorate awarded in country X who have left country X. In general, the sub-populations E and F are taken into consideration in the reporting countries where 
these doctorate holders are resident. For this reason and because of the general difficulties to trace these 
doctorate holders across borders, countries are not requested to report information on the doctorate holders, 
resident outside the national borders. COUNTRY X A. Nationals who 
have graduated in

Recent doctorate recipients A sub-population of particular interest are recent doctorate recipients. These are defined as the 
population of doctorate holders that have been awarded their doctoral during the last two years. Therefore, 
a recent doctorate recipient is a person who received his/her doctorate degree at any time between January 
201X-1 and December 201X, where 1 December 201X is the reference date for the survey. Indicators 
specifically related to this population are age at graduation, time to completion, source of funding, 
employment status and gross annual earnings. DSTI/DOC(2012)7 19 4. 
SURVEY METHODOLOGY 4.1 
Data collection at the national level Data compilation methods are expected to differ from one country to another as a consequence of the 
different types of data sources or registers available to identify and survey doctorate holders. Possible national data sources are surveys targeting university graduates, housing and population 
censuses, labour force surveys, migration statistics, R&D statistics, etc. Gaps between the data available 
and the data requested need to be identified and addressed. Existing surveys could be extended or new 
complementary surveys launched. Metadata on CDH statistics are collected in order to assess the quality of the tabulated data delivered. 4.2 
Sampling frames for surveys on doctorate holders In order to obtain the best possible coverage of the target population, statisticians may have to rely on 
several national sources to build their sampling frames since these sources are targeting different sub-
groups of the population of doctorate holders. Possible overlaps between sources should be identified and remedied. For this purpose, information 
that makes it possible to unambiguously identify the same individual in multiple sources like e.g. name, 
year of award and date of birth could be used. The establishment of a national register of doctorate holders, resident in the country, irrespectively of 
country of doctorate award, with a mechanism to update it systematically, is recommended for the 
elaboration of complete sampling frames. Some countries have already invested effort and resources in that 
direction. A list of possible sources for building sampling frames for CDH related surveys is presented below. 
More sources may be identified as the project evolves (when more national metadata become available). @BULLET National registers of education If a national register of education is available, this is one of the best possible sampling frames. The 
Swedish register of education, constantly updated with information on postgraduate exams from 
national universities and annually with information on the educational attainment of new 
immigrants, is an example of a source for a sampling frame that includes the entire target 
population. @BULLET National universities University information systems provide sources for sampling frames that usually consists of high-
quality administrative-based information on the educational characteristics of doctorate holders as 
well as on personal data, including addresses and phone numbers. These types of sources however 
are not sufficient to cover doctorates awarded many years ago or doctorates awarded abroad. These 
types of sources are for example used as sampling frame in the Canadian Survey of Earned DSTI/DOC(2012)7 20 Doctorates, the Danish survey PhDs in Natural Sciences and the Italian survey Employment of 
PhDs of the University of Rome. @BULLET Previously conducted surveys on doctorate holders This type of source can serve as a good basis to build the future sampling frame when 
supplemented with recently awarded doctorate holders and other subgroups of the target 
population not covered initially. The longitudinal panel Survey of Doctorate Recipients in the 
United States is for example based on a sample of the annually conducted Survey of Earned 
Doctorates. @BULLET International and national funding institutions Doctorate holders that have received scholarships during their studies might be identified and 
reached through the funding organisations. For example, the Portuguese foundation for Science 
and Technology is used to build a sampling frame in the survey PhDs in the labour market. @BULLET National libraries National libraries may be able to provide a list of theses of doctorates awarded within the country 
together with information like name, university, field of science, and award year. In order to use 
this list for the building up of the sampling frame, it probably needs to be complemented with 
contact information from other sources. Iceland uses the list of PhD dissertations available to the 
National and University Library in combination with other sources to compile the national register 
of doctorate holders (RANNIS database). @BULLET Alumni organisations Since membership is not compulsory, alumni organisations will not provide a complete list of all 
doctorate holders. Name and address registers can however hold recently updated information 
making it suitable for tracing of individual doctorates holders. Alumni databases were used as 
sampling frame in the German Brain Drain – Brain Gain Survey on International Job Careers. @BULLET Population and housing censuses One important source for building up a sampling frame is the housing and population census. This 
survey in principle covers the complete target population, but some limitations can be expected: 
e.g. low frequency of these surveys and, more importantly, the non-systematic separate 
identification of doctorate holders in some countries. The 2005 Belgian CDH survey has used the 
population and housing census as a sampling frame. @BULLET Central registers of foreign citizens If registers of foreign citizens are available, they should be used for building up the sampling 
frame for CDH surveys, in particular with regard to doctorate holders with foreign citizenship. 
This is only possible when the educational background of foreigners is registered, which is not 
always the case. In combination with population and housing censuses, register of foreigners could 
provide the link to population changes among foreign citizens (including doctorate holders) which 
occurred since the reference date of the census. DSTI/DOC(2012)7 21 @BULLET R&D statistics If an R&D data collection is conducted, information on citizenship, field of science, formal 
qualification and sector of employment might be available for doctorate holders that are employed 
in research positions. The OECD requests this information and so does the European Commission, 
where the concerned variables are included in the Commission regulation 753/2004 that applies to 
the EEA countries. @BULLET Employment/business register National employment and business registers are used for approaching doctorate holders through 
their employers. The registers comprise enterprises, organisations, institutions, etc., a first contact 
where it is envisaged to identify those which employ doctorate holders. In combination with other 
sources (e.g. university information systems), this approach works efficiently for tracking 
doctorate holders awarded abroad. However, it is not sufficient to capture unemployed and inactive 
doctorate holders. @BULLET Other surveys (LFS, EU-SILC, SBS, etc.) Other established surveys can be exploited in several ways for building the CDH sampling frame: 
identify doctorate holders, identify firms, institutions, etc. which employ doctorate holders, 
supplement administrative information (addresses, phone contacts, names, etc.) or other 
information related to CDH (e.g. LFS collects information on education level and employment 
status). 4.3 
Survey types Beside the extensive use of administrative sources (which is possible in some countries), different 
survey types could be considered when compiling information on educational history, mobility and careers 
of doctorate holders. It is recommended to use all possible available sources that allow filling in the 
information corresponding to the mandatory questions in the CDH model questionnaire. Described below 
are the three main types of existing surveys: graduate surveys, cohort surveys and cross-sectional 
retrospective surveys. These three survey types are ordered according to their degree of coverage of the target population. 
Cross-sectional surveys are the most efficient in terms of coverage but some specific advantages could also 
be identified in each of the other types. The three surveys should thus not be seen as mutually exclusive, 
but rather complementary. Countries could opt for one or for a combination of surveys that provides the 
most cost-efficient national data collection. The sampling frames and their qualities are of course of crucial importance for the quality of the 
results. The complementary coverage of the different sampling frames used in the different survey types 
needs to correspond to the CDH target population. 4.3.1 
Graduate surveys Graduate surveys are surveys that capture information at the time upon graduation. This type of 
survey is especially suitable for collecting information on the doctorate programme, the education history 
and conditions during the years of study. A graduate survey is also the appropriate means for obtaining 
information on post-graduation plans and could be the only point of contact with doctorate holders that 
plan to leave the country, including those that return to their country of origin. No information however 
can be gathered on long-time career developments and international mobility. DSTI/DOC(2012)7 22 A graduate survey should preferably be conducted regularly on all nationally awarded doctorate 
holders, including foreign citizens, as soon as possible after graduation. Information on educational history 
and the doctorate programme itself (e.g. source of funding and time to completion) is best obtained as soon 
after graduation as possible. Co-operation with the educational institutions should be sought to take 
advantage of their information systems and establish contact with the respondents. If the educational 
institutions could obtain survey results pertaining to their own graduates, their motivation to participate 
should be high. Records obtained through a graduate survey should be stored and used to build a register of nationally 
awarded doctorate holders, which will not cover doctorate holders awarded abroad or doctorate holders 
having graduated a long time ago, although the latter problem will diminish with the passage of time. Due 
to this limitation, graduation surveys should always be used in combination with other survey types. 
Besides being a useful source of information, such a register could also be used in the future to construct 
sampling frames for cohort and cross-sectional surveys. 4.3.2 
Cohort surveys Longitudinal cohort surveys have advantages in collecting up-to-date information about the training 
and working activities undertaken by doctorate holders, by following a homogeneous population over time. 
For instance, it can be assumed that individuals graduated in the same year will experience similar 
conditions of the labour market in approaching job searching. Such longitudinal surveys should be ideally 
carried out every two to three years. On the other hand, surveys on recent cohorts of doctorate holders can provide only limited 
information about long-time career developments and international mobility, which can be better 
investigated through a cross-sectional retrospective survey. A cohort survey could be conducted as a sample survey or a census. It should in principle include 
doctorates awarded from all national institutions, including foreign citizens, currently unemployed and 
inactive as well as doctorates entering the country having being awarded abroad. A cohort survey should 
be based on a sampling frame where year of graduation is available. When new cohorts are regularly introduced and surveyed in parallel to older ones the coverage with 
regard to the CDH target population will increase over time. 4.3.3 
Cross-sectional retrospective surveys A cross-sectional survey should cover doctorate holders from many different cohorts, awarded within 
the country and abroad. Through retrospective questions, the cross-sectional survey should provide a good 
picture of the career paths of doctorate holders at different stages of their career. The cross-sectional survey 
is thus the most appropriate tool if information on the entire target population is to be obtained through one 
single survey or a follow-up of other established surveys which sufficiently cover doctorate holders (e.g. 
LFS). In the latter case a sample or the total population of the identified doctorate holders will be surveyed 
for the CDH specific needs. Cross-sectional surveys have the potential to ensure complete coverage of the target population and 
moreover to collect CDH specific information. Countries should make strong efforts to assure the full 
coverage of all groups, including those that are more problematic to capture (doctorate holders awarded 
abroad, inactive doctorate holders, unemployed doctorate holders, etc.). DSTI/DOC(2012)7 23 The relevance of this type of survey should however be carefully assessed in terms of cost-
effectiveness, given that a survey for the needs of CDH needs to be established from scratch. Another 
drawback with these surveys that should also be considered is the risk of recall bias; countries should make 
an effort to minimize that risk. 4.4 
Stratification Cohort surveys and graduate surveys should, if they are carried out as sample surveys, be stratified 
according to at least two main criteria, graduating institution and sector of employment. For cross-sectional sample surveys, stratification is needed with regard to the structure of the target 
population and the original data sources used to build the sampling frames. In statistical surveys, the number of domains needed often determines the number of strata. However, 
for multipurpose statistics like the CDH statistics, the number of domains will often exceed the desirable 
number of strata. Since too high a number of strata could lead to a problem with too few observations in 
some strata, it is important to keep stratification at a reasonable level. The most obvious and significant stratification is to break down the population according to the 
sampling frames applied. As strata should be as homogenous as possible with respect to the principal 
variables analysed, further recommended breakdowns are according to the characteristics year of 
graduation, fields of science, and gender. 4.5 
Allocation and sampling The allocation of the sample on the strata may be in principle proportional to the stratum size. If the 
allocation ends up giving too small sample sizes in some strata, over-sampling may be considered. Over-
sampling might also be considered in strata where high levels of non-response could be expected. The total sample size should be chosen taking into account the detailed breakdowns in the output 
indicators template. The selection of the sample should be based on random sampling techniques, with 
known and equal selection probabilities being applied within each stratum. The random sampling 
techniques should be without replacement within each stratum. It is recommended that the total sample fraction (ratio of total sample size to total population size) 
exceeds 20%. Smaller fractions could be accepted as long as the variance of estimation is restricted to 
ensure accurate results. DSTI/DOC(2012)7 24 5. 
COLLECTION AND PROCESSING OF DATA 5.1 
Data collection methods When collecting CDH statistics, a mixed-mode data collection adapted to the possibilities available 
within each country could be considered. This includes the use of existing data, postal and Internet surveys, 
telephone interviews and personal interviews. Postal surveys are commonly used and have the advantage to be relatively inexpensive. Under some 
circumstances, the delivery agent also may bring back information on the new addresses of people who 
moved during the most recent past. Both postal and telephone reminders may be used to increase the 
response rate. Computer assisted telephone interviews (CATI) and personal interviews (CAPI) are techniques where 
interviewers play an active role in collecting information from respondents. Although quite costly, they 
could be justified by the higher rates of response that they normally achieve. CATI and CAPI techniques 
are especially useful in boosting the response rates of a postal survey. Many national practices exist where countries give the respondent the opportunity to fill in the 
questionnaire in an electronic version on the Internet. The use of questionnaires that can be accessed on-
line is recommended as an alternative to other means of collection after contact with the respondent has 
been established. In the special case of graduate surveys the relevant institutions should preferably be involved in the 
data collection. The institutions could considerably facilitate the data collection process by distributing and 
collecting the questionnaire together with their administrative requirements for graduations. 5.2 
The CDH survey questionnaire Since CDH statistics are based on an output-harmonised approach, statisticians may decide what 
survey instruments to use. However, a full model questionnaire is available, in an English version, with 
questions adapted to the output indicator templates and definitions. A CDH dedicated survey using this 
questionnaire is the best fitted instrument for providing the full range of CDH variables and should 
preferably be adapted by the participating countries. The questionnaire is divided into six different modules dealing with different aspects of the careers of 
doctorate holders: doctoral education (EDU), early career research positions (ECR), employment situation 
(EMP), international mobility (MOB), career related experience (CAR) and personal characteristics 
(PER). In order to facilitate answering the questionnaire for the respondents, an instruction manual has 
been developed as well. The model questionnaire is recommended for countries that are going to launch a self-standing CDH 
survey. In addition, countries that want to revise their existing national questionnaires are encouraged to 
align it by using the selection of questions presented in the model questionnaire. The first section of the 
core model questionnaire presents instructions for adaptation of the model questionnaire to national needs, DSTI/DOC(2012)7 25 pointing out necessary adaptations as well as options for the drafting of some questions. These instructions 
should be carefully followed when applying the core model questionnaire at the country level. 2 5.3 
Coding of data values The definitions and the breakdowns within the CDH output tabulation determine what classifications 
and nomenclatures are to be used. Complementary to the output tables, a list of the variables' definitions 
are available in the document Output indicators variables and definitions. 5.4 
Data editing Throughout the data processing cycle, there should be a systematic and sustained follow-up with 
respondents to make sure that the data provided is of good quality. Data quality checks have to be done 
both at micro-and macro-level, before the data are finally processed and disseminated. 2. 
The model questionnaire is available on CIRCA site of Eurostat and the OECD CDH electronic discussion 
group, and will soon be available on the UIS website as well. DSTI/DOC(2012)7 26 6. 
ESTIMATION OF RESULTS AND DATA QUALITY 6.1 
Response rates Doctorate holders who do not respond to the CDH survey questionnaire may not only differ from 
respondents in the characteristics measured, but non-response generally does not occur completely at 
random. Therefore, all efforts have to be made to minimise unit non-response. Nevertheless, survey 
budgets and potential non-response bias may influence the decisions made about the acceptable degree of 
non-response and its treatment. 6.2 
Unit non-response and non-response survey A non-response survey is recommended if the non-response rate, as an un-weighted percentage of all 
sampled doctorate holders, exceeds a certain limit (e.g. 30%). The aim of a non-response survey is to 
identify systematic biases about the groups of non-respondents. Therefore non-respondents should not be 
replaced in the sample by other doctorate holders from the survey population. If the results from the non-
response analysis indicate that there is a difference between respondents and non-respondents indicators, 
this information should be used when calculating the weighting factors. 6.3 
Imputation Item non-response should be kept at a minimum. Imputation should be the last option after every 
attempt is made to get the needed information from other data sources i.e. census data, administrative or 
register data or from the respondent. Item non-response imputations are recommended. Imputed values need to be flagged as for the non-
response analysis. The imputation methods to be used for handling missing values should be specified in 
the national methodology description. 6.4 
Weighting and calibration In order to produce estimates for the surveyed population as a total, the data collected from a sample 
survey have to be weighted. Even if the survey is a census survey, with total enumeration of the frame 
population, weighting is appropriate to compensate for non-response or over-coverage. The simplest weighting technique is to use the inverse of the sampling fractions of the sampling units, 
the inclusion probability, corrected for non-response. If a stratified sampling technique with different 
sampling fractions is used, weights have to be calculated individually for each stratum. If appropriate 
auxiliary information is available, it is recommended that estimates are built on models or calibration for 
better precision and reduced bias. If a non-response analysis is carried out (and the results indicate that there is a difference between 
respondents and non-respondents), then the results of the non-response analysis should also be used when 
calculating the final weighting factors. One approach is to divide each stratum into a number of response 
homogeneous groups with (assumed) equal response probabilities within groups. A second approach could 
be to use auxiliary information at the estimation stage for reducing the non-response bias. DSTI/DOC(2012)7 27 The methods that were mostly used in the previous CDH data collections were the Horvitz-Thompson 
estimator, the Huang Fuller method and the method of propensity score weighting. For the calculation of weights, there are various software packages that can be used, based on SAS 
macro commands. These include the following: @BULLET CLAN. This was developed by Statistics Sweden and is a suite of SAS-macro commands. @BULLET CALMAR (Calibration on Margins). This is another SAS macro developed by INSEE in France. @BULLET CALJACK. This is also a SAS macro developed by Statistics Canada. 6.5 
Over-coverage The extent of over-coverage could be difficult to estimate, but if over-coverage can be identified 
among respondents, this could have implications. If a non-negligible amount of over-coverage is present in 
the surveyed sample, the estimation weights have to be adjusted in order to reduce bias in the estimates. 6.6 
Under-coverage With the aid of suitable auxiliary information and calibration techniques, adequate estimators are 
obtained even when under-coverage is present in a survey. As it is difficult to recommend which auxiliary 
information to use, surveying countries will have to find their own auxiliary information to use. Another 
approach less advanced but maybe more practical, could be to not try to correct for under-coverage in the 
estimates, but discussing its occurrence and implication in the national methodology description. 
Numerical estimation of the not covered proportion of the target population and of its magnitude in the 
survey figures would very much facilitate the analysis of the results and comparison with data from other 
countries. DSTI/DOC(2012)7 28 7. 
DATA TRANSMISSION 7.1 
Data to be transmitted The aggregated (tabulated) statistics to be delivered to the OECD and the UNESCO Institute for 
Statistics are determined in close co-operation with the expert group on careers of doctorate holders. All 
variables and their breakdowns in the output tables are to be compiled at national level, following the 
definitions provided. For those countries which are undergoing a transitional phase to the full implementation of the CDH 
methodological guidelines, the reporting of the aggregated CDH statistics for only part of the CDH target 
population will be accepted. However, this has to be explicitly stated in the accompanying national 
metadata. Aggregated statistics have to be treated in accordance with the standard confidentiality rules at 
national level, before transmission to the international organisations. National authorities are requested to 
submit a file excluding confidential data, which indicates the cells suppressed for reasons of confidentiality 
protection. Countries are also requested not to change the Excel template of the output tables requested 
(i.e. standard names used, breakdowns, etc.) or the consistency checks inserted in the form of conditional 
formatting. Changing the template entails extra burden for data compilation, increases the risk of errors and 
complicates comparison between countries. Countries wishing to send revised data should submit a revised complete file instead of delivering 
only the revised figures. In addition to the tabulated aggregated statistics, national metadata are requested by the international 
organisations. These metadata should cover type of sources used, types and degree of under-coverage of 
the target population, national deviations from definitions or other key quality indicators such as non-
response rates, coefficient of variation, etc. A specific structure to be used in the metadata compilation will 
be distributed together with the indicator templates and will also be made available at the CIRCA site of 
Eurostat and the OECD CDH electronic discussion group. 7.2 
Transmission tools The CDH statistics are to be transmitted within an Excel file provided by the international 
organisations to the countries concerned. UIS, OECD and Eurostat determine a common delivery format scheme, including the name of Excel 
sheets, name of the submitted files, numbering of revisions, etc. to which countries should fully comply. The special metadata structure for CDH statistics should be used when reporting on survey 
methodology and data quality issues to the international organisations. 7.3 
Deadlines Countries are asked to return the CDH output tables 12 months after the end of the reference year at 
the latest. DSTI/DOC(2012)7 29 In addition: For more detailed information on the methodology of CDH statistics, please also consult the CIRCA 
site of Eurostat and the OECDCDH electronic discussion group, where useful background documents will 
be loaded on a regular basis. DSTI/DOC(2012)7 30 ANNEX 1: POSSIBLE DATA SOURCES FOR BUILDING SAMPLING FRAMES Institution

TO NATIONAL NEEDS The present questionnaire has been drafted in accordance with the definitions and methodological 
guidelines prepared in the framework of the Careers of Doctorate Holders (CDH) project. Please consult 
the accompanying manual comprising the definitions and other guidelines which should be followed in 
order to facilitate international comparison of the statistics provided by different countries. This questionnaire consists of six modules which concern the education of those with advanced research 
qualifications (module EDU), their early career research positions (module ECR), employment history 
(module EMP), international mobility (module MOB), career-related experience (module CAR) and 
personal characteristics (module PER). The present document proposes the following sequence for the 
modules: EDU-ECR-EMP-MOB-CAR-PER. However, countries are encouraged to organise the 
questionnaire according to their own needs and national policy priorities. Countries are also encouraged to 
share their national questionnaires with the other participating countries and the three international 
organisations. Remarks applicable to all modules Questions marked with ( * ) are essential to cover information for filling out the CDH output tables. When 
organising your national questionnaire, please make sure that ALL these questions are included. You are 
free to incorporate extra questions in order to reflect your national requirements. ONLY QUESTIONS MARKED WITH  *  ARE REQUIRED ELEMENTS FOR THE INTERNATIONAL 
SURVEY. ALL OTHER QUESTIONS ARE OPTIONAL AND DERIVE FROM PREVIOUS USAGE IN 
NATIONAL SURVEYS. Countries are therefore encouraged to give the mandatory questions priority, and to include only 
those optional questions for which there is a clear policy request. Please pay particular attention to adapting ALL filter questions (accompanied by SKIP or GO TO) with the 
actual order of modules chosen, even if the proposed order is adopted. <NEXT MODULE> should be 
substituted by the denomination of the next module in your national questionnaire design. Many questions require respondents to refer to a table provided in the instruction manual to identify the 
corresponding classification code. As there are several tables of classification codes provided in the 
manual, it is possible that respondents could use the wrong table and enter the wrong code in their survey. 
The accuracy and ease with which these questions are completed may be improved by including the 
relevant classification table within the questionnaire itself, particularly if the questionnaires will be 
administered electronically. If this is not possible, the table should be referred to by its exact and complete 
title given in the Instruction Manual provided to the respondents (e.g. Classification 1: Fields of Science 
and Technology). These questions could also ask for plain text instead of codes. Countries are free to 
adapt these in both ways. Please note that ALL elements in brackets <> should be replaced accordingly. In <201X>, <201X-1>, <201X-2>, <201X-9>, 201X should be substituted by the year of the survey, 201X-1 
with the previous year, and so on. <The country X> should be replaced by the name of your country. Section  " SCOPE AND PURPOSE "  This section should be complemented with some information on the particular objectives of the survey in 
the country. The phrase <Your response is voluntary and failure to provide some or all of the requested information will 
not in any way adversely affect you.> should only be included in those countries were response is 
voluntary. A note stating the mandatory character of the survey should be included instead, if appropriate. <20 minutes> is the estimated time to complete the questionnaire if no other questions are added. 
However, countries are encouraged to estimate the time needed in each case, and give the right value in 
this section. DSTI/DOC(2012)7 37 Module EDU Question EDU.1 could be adapted to the national context. The state or province could be removed if 
considered not relevant. In question EDU.4 <advanced research qualification work/thesis/dissertation> should be adapted to the 
national context according to the national education system in your country. The items given in this 
question could also be adapted to the national context if considered unclear in its current version. In question EDU.5 <Industrial interface/working with industry> should be replaced by the type of relations 
between academia and industry prevalent in your country. Items in question EDU.11 should be adapted to the institutional structures funding advanced research 
qualification studies in the country, while ensuring correspondence with the classification presented, also 
used in the output tabulations ED5, EMP3 and EMP7. The following classification is more detailed than the 
one proposed and could also be applied if appropriate: A. 1.

Unknown Module ECR The purpose of this module is to gather data on the particular working conditions of those who are on 
temporary or short-term contracts, often called 'post-doctorates' which are typically held shortly after 
completing an advanced research qualification, but before holding a regular full time career path job. Module EMP In question EMP.2 <gross annual earnings> should be replaced by the term relevant to your country. Questions EMP.3 and EMP.10 could be adapted to the national context. The name of the employer, and 
the state or province could be removed if considered not relevant. In these questions,  " Occupation "  could 
alternatively be replaced by the following. Using the OCCUPATIONS LIST (see Manual: Classification 2: Occupations ISCO-08), choose the code that BEST describes the 
work at this position. CODE If this option was chosen, the Manual should include  " Classification 2: ISCO-08 Occupations "  as below. 
With the current version, coding of ISCO occupations will have to be carried out by the national project 
team. In case ISCO-08 is not in yet place in the country, a correspondence table could be used from ISCO-
88 to ISCO-08, such as for example the one available on the ILO site. 3 3.

education system in your country. Question EMP.10 asks about the most recent previous position only. If a country wants to ask for more, or 
all, previous positions in the last 10 years, this has to be added to the questionnaire. Module CAR In question CAR.4 <three years> should be replaced by the number of years suitable for your national 
needs. Module PER Question PER.2: If the full date is asked in the national questionnaire, instead of only the year, the 
response box should be adapted according to the standard national date format. Question PER.3 could be adapted to the national context. The state or province could be removed if 
considered not relevant. Questions PER.4 and PER.6 could be adapted to national standards, since categories may vary. 
<marriage-like relationship> should be replaced by the expression commonly used in the national context. Instruction Manual The Instruction Manual also bears some sections that need to be adapted to national survey context. For 
example, <Introduction of institution carrying out the survey> is a place keeper for some information on the 
national institution carrying out the CDH survey. For any queries relating to the adaptation of this questionnaire, do not hesitate to contact the UNESCO 
Institute for Statistics by e-mail: uis.stsurvey@unesco.org or by fax: +1 -514 343 6872. SCOPE AND PURPOSE The international Survey on Careers of Doctorate Holders (CDH) is a joint project carried out by the 
UNESCO Institute for Statistics (UIS), the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development 
(OECD) and the Statistical Office of the European Commission (Eurostat). The present questionnaire is designed to collect the most recent statistics on educational history, work 
experience and international mobility of holders of advanced research qualifications. The main objectives 
of the questionnaire are: @BULLET To collect internationally comparable statistics on the careers of holders of advanced research 
qualifications. @BULLET To establish and analyse trends in the career paths and mobility of highly qualified people throughout 
the world. The improvement and harmonisation of data collection in a broad number of countries and its further 
analysis should enable policy makers, researchers and analysts to start the appropriate policies with 
regard to highly qualified people in order to ensure their career developments all over the world. Any information publicly released (such as statistical summaries) will be in a form that does not personally 
identify you. <Your response is voluntary and failure to provide some or all of the requested information will not in any 
way adversely affect you.> Actual time to complete the questionnaire may vary depending on your circumstances. On average, it will 
take about <20 minutes> to complete the questionnaire. Your assistance is essential to ensure that the results are meaningful. Your answers will be kept strictly 
confidential and used for statistical purposes only. DSTI/DOC(2012)7 40 Thank you for taking the time to complete this questionnaire. 
Directions for filling it out are provided in the accompanying 
manual. Because not all questions will apply to everyone, you may 
be asked to skip certain questions. @BULLET Please use an  " X "  when answering questions that require 
marking a box. 
@BULLET In order to get comparable data, we will be asking you to refer to 
1 December <201X>. 
@BULLET Follow all  " SKIP "  and  " GO TO "  instructions after marking a box. 
<The following two bullets should be removed if an electronic 
questionnaire is used>

@BULLET If you need to change an answer, please make sure that your old 
answer is either completely erased or clearly crossed out. Thanks again for your help; we really appreciate it. DSTI/DOC(2012)7 41 The term  " advanced research qualification "  (doctorate/doctoral) is understood in this survey as equivalent to

the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the UNESCO Institute for 
Statistics (UIS) and the Statistical Office of the European Commission (Eurostat). The project focuses on 
holders of advanced research qualifications (usually doctorate holders) who are considered to be crucial to 
the production, application and diffusion of knowledge. The present questionnaire is designed to collect the most recent statistics on educational history, work 
experience and international mobility of holders of advanced research qualifications throughout the world. 
The main objectives of the questionnaire are: @BULLET To build internationally comparable indicators on the careers of holders of advanced research 
qualifications. @BULLET To identify and analyse trends in the career paths and mobility of highly qualified people 
throughout the world. The improvement and harmonisation of data collection in a broad number of countries and its further 
analysis should enable policy makers, researchers and analysts to conduct the appropriate policies with 
regard to highly qualified people in order to ensure their career development all over the world. This instruction manual has been prepared in order to help respondents completing the questionnaire. 
It comprises the definitions and other guidelines that should be followed in order to facilitate international 
comparison of the statistics provided by different countries. The definitions and classification presented in this manual are based on different internationally 
recognised sources such as the Frascati Manual (OECD), International Labour Organization (ILO) 
Resolutions Concerning Economically Active Population, Employment, Unemployment and 
Underemployment Adopted by the 13th International Conference of Labour Statisticians (October 1982), 
National Science Foundation Survey of Doctorate Recipients, International Standard Classification of 
Education (ISCED-1997), International Standard Classification of Occupations (ISCO-08) and others (see 
sources related to the presented definitions). DSTI/DOC(2012)7 67 1. 
COVERAGE OF THE QUESTIONNAIRE The questionnaire is designed to collect data on all individuals who on the reference date fulfil the 
following criteria: @BULLET Have an education at ISCED 6 level 5 (see definition 1) obtained anywhere in the world; and @BULLET Are resident (permanent or non-permanent) within the national borders of the surveying country. Definition 1: ISCED 6 : Advanced research qualification ISCED LEVEL 6: SECOND STAGE OF TERTIARY EDUCATION (LEADING TO AN ADVANCED RESEARCH 
QUALIFICATION) Principal characteristics This level is reserved for tertiary programmes which lead to the award of an advanced research qualification. The 
programmes are therefore devoted to advanced study and original research and are not based on course-work only. Classification criteria For the definition of this level, the following criteria are relevant: Main criterion It typically requires the submission of a thesis or dissertation of publishable quality which is the product of 
original research and represents a significant contribution to knowledge. Subsidiary criterion It prepares graduates for faculty posts in institutions offering ISCED 5A programmes, as well as research 
posts in government, industry, etc. Includes also: The part concentrating on advanced research in those countries where students beginning tertiary education 
enrol directly for an advanced research programme. Source: UNESCO International Standard Classification of Education 1997 (ISCED-1997). 5. 
ISCED was revised in 2011, but its implementation is not expected before 2014. Therefore this 
questionnaire still uses ISCED 1997. The equivalent of ISCED 1997 level 6 will be ISCED 2011 level 8. DSTI/DOC(2012)7 68 2. 
INSTRUCTIONS FOR COMPLETING THE QUESTIONNAIRE Not all questions will apply to everyone. You may be asked to skip certain questions. @BULLET Please use an  " X "  when answering questions that require marking a box. @BULLET In order to obtain comparable data, we will be asking you to refer to your situation on 1 December <201X>. @BULLET Follow all  " SKIP "  and  " GO TO "  instructions after marking a box. <The following two bullets should be removed if an electronic questionnaire is used> @BULLET Either a pen or pencil may be used. @BULLET If you need to change an answer, please make sure that your old answer is either completely erased or clearly crossed out. The present questionnaire has been drafted in accordance with the definitions and methodological 
guidelines prepared in the framework of the CDH project in order to facilitate international comparison of 
the statistics provided by different countries. Please refer to the definitions in this Manual for further 
clarification. The questionnaire consists of the following modules: @BULLET EDU – Advanced research qualification education @BULLET ECR – Early career research positions @BULLET EMP – Employment situation @BULLET MOB – International mobility @BULLET CAR – Career-related experience @BULLET PER – Personal characteristics Your assistance is essential to ensure that the results are meaningful. Your answers will be kept 
strictly confidential and used for statistical purposes only. Any information publicly released (such as 
statistical summaries) will be in form that does not personally identify you. <Your response is voluntary and failure to provide some or all of the requested information will not in 
any way adversely affect you.> Actual time to complete the questionnaire may vary depending on your circumstances. On 
average, it will take about 20 minutes to complete the questionnaire. DSTI/DOC(2012)7 69 MODULE EDU – ADVANCED RESEARCH QUALIFICATION EDUCATION The education module aims to provide information on the educational history of holders of advanced 
research qualifications. This module will supply information on specific characteristics of holders of 
advanced research qualifications, such as date of award, field of science, sources of financial support, 
duration of advanced research qualification programme and country of previous degree. You will find below the relationship between the questions and related definitions and classifications. In order to respond to question EDU.2 which asks you to provide information on the field of science 
and technology corresponding to your advanced research qualification studies, please refer to

took you to complete your advanced research qualification during the period between when you started 
your advanced research qualification programme and when your advanced research qualification degree 
was granted, please subtract periods longer than one week taken off for reasons such as irrelevant 
temporary jobs to sustain funding throughout the advanced research qualification programme, or for 
personal, family or maternity/paternity leave reasons. However, time spent on study or work abroad 
relevant to your advanced research qualification programme should not be counted as  " taken off " . When 
answering this question, please make sure that you round the indicated number of months to whole months. Answering question EDU.10, which requires that you supply the country in which you received your 
previous university degree (at ISCED 7 level), please take into account definition 2. Definition 2: ISCED 1997 level 5: First stage of tertiary education (not leading directly to an advanced research 
qualification) ISCED 5 is composed of two different types of tertiary programmes, not leading directly to the award of an 
advanced research qualification (such as doctorates, which are at ISCED level 6): ISCED 5A programmes are tertiary programmes that are largely theoretically based and are intended to provide 
sufficient qualifications for gaining entry into advanced research programmes and professions with high skills 
requirements. They must satisfy a sufficient number of the following criteria: @BULLET 
A minimum cumulative theoretical duration (at tertiary level) of three years' full-time equivalent, although 
typically they are of four or more years. 
@BULLET 
Faculty with advanced research credentials. 
@BULLET 
May involve completion of a research project or thesis. 
@BULLET 
Provide the level of education required for entry into a profession with high skills requirements 
(theoretically based/research preparatory, such as history, philosophy, mathematics, etc., or giving 
access to professions with high skills requirements, e.g. medicine, dentistry, architecture, etc.) or an 
advanced research programme. This level typically includes programmes such as  " Bachelors " , as well as all the research programmes which are 
not part of a doctorate, such as any type of Master's degrees. ISCED 5B programmes are tertiary programmes typically shorter than those in 5A and focus on occupationally 
specific skills geared for entry into the labour market, although some theoretical foundations may be covered in the 
respective programme. The content of ISCED level 5B programmes is practically oriented/occupationally specific and 
is mainly designed for participants to acquire the practical skills and know-how needed for employment in a particular 
occupation or trade or class of occupations or trades -the successful completion of which usually provides the 
participants with a labour-market relevant qualification. Source: UNESCO International Standard Classification of Education 1997 (ISCED-1997). MODULE ECR – EARLY CAREER RESEARCH POSITIONS If you were in permanent employment, self-employed, unemployed or inactive on 1 December 
<201X>, please skip this module. This module addresses persons who were in a temporary research position on 1 December <201X> 
that satisfies most or all of the conditions in question ECR.2. Often, this type of position is referred to as a 
postdoc position. It is generally understood that a postdoc is a temporary position for holders of advanced 
research qualifications (i.e. after finalising their advanced research qualification studies) where the main 
activity is research, and the holder receives some kind of financial support. However, there are very 
different forms of postdoc positions worldwide. In order to assess the extent to which these positions have DSTI/DOC(2012)7 71 comparable characteristics, question ECR.2 lists a number of characteristics, which usually correspond to 
this type of position. Please indicate if each of these characteristics corresponds or not to the position you 
held on 1 December <201X> in question ECR.2, and provide the exact title of your position (in your own 
language) in question ECR.3. Please use the Fields of Science & Technology Classification (see Classification 1) to reply to 
question ECR.4. MODULE EMP – EMPLOYMENT SITUATION This module aims to furnish information on the career development of holders of advanced research 
qualifications. Information that should be provided is for example your employment status, your occupation, type of 
contract (temporary or permanent employment, part-time or full-time job) and combined annual salary (in 
national currency). This module includes a section on PAST EMPLOYMENT dealing with the retrospective career 
history of holders of advanced research qualifications, gathering information on work experience within 
the ten past years (including occupation, dates, years of experience, and reasons for leaving previous 
positions). In order to respond to question EMP.1 which asks you to provide information on your employment 
status on 1 December <201X>, please refer to definitions 3, 4 and 5. Definition 3: Employed The employed comprise all persons above a specified age who during a specified brief period, either one week or 
one day, were in the following categories: @BULLET At work: persons who during the reference period performed some work for a wage or salary, or persons who during the reference period performed some work for profit or family gain, in cash or in kind. @BULLET With a job but not at work: persons who, having already worked in their present job, were temporarily not at work during the reference period and had a formal attachment to their job. This formal attachment should be 
determined in the light of national circumstances, according to one or more of the following criteria: the 
continued receipt of wage or salary; an assurance of return to work following the end of the contingency, or 
an agreement as to the date of return; the elapsed duration of absence from the job which, wherever 
relevant, may be that duration for which workers can receive compensation benefits without obligations to 
accept other jobs. @BULLET With an enterprise but not at work: persons with an enterprise, which may be a business enterprise, a farm or a service undertaking, who were temporarily not at work during the reference period for any specific 
reason. Source: Adapted from International Labour Organization (ILO) Resolutions Concerning Economically Active Population, Employment, 
Unemployment and Underemployment Adopted by the 13th International Conference of Labour Statisticians, October 1982, para. 9. DSTI/DOC(2012)7 72 Definition 4: Unemployed The unemployed comprise all persons above a specified age who during the reference period were: @BULLET Without work, that is, were not in paid employment or self employment during the reference period. @BULLET Currently available for work, that is, were available for paid employment or self-employment during the reference period; and @BULLET Seeking work, that is, had taken specific steps to seek paid employment or self-employment. The specific steps may include registration at a public or private employment exchange; application to employers; 
checking at worksites, farms, factory gates, market or other assembly places; placing or answering 
newspaper advertisements; seeking assistance of friends or relatives; looking for land, building, machinery 
or equipment to establish own enterprise; arranging for financial resources; applying for permits and 
licences, etc. Source: International Labour Organization (ILO) Resolutions Concerning Economically Active Population, Employment, 
Unemployment and Underemployment Adopted by the 13th International Conference of Labour Statisticians, October 1982, para. 10. Definition 5: Inactive The "population not currently active", or, equivalently, persons not in the labour force, comprises all persons who 
were not employed or were unemployed and hence not currently active because of: (a) Attendance at educational institutions. (b) Engagement in household duties. (c) Retirement or old age, or (d) Other reasons such as infirmity or disablement, which may be specified. Source: International Labour Organization (ILO) Resolutions Concerning Economically Active Population, Employment, 
Unemployment and Underemployment Adopted by the 13th International Conference of Labour Statisticians, October 1982, para. 12. In order to answer question EMP.2 in which you are asked to provide data on your gross annual 
earnings for the reference year, please refer to definition 6 or adapt this question to your national needs. 
Please make sure that you indicate your salary in national currency. Definition 6: Gross annual earnings Gross annual earnings cover remuneration in cash and in kind paid during <201X> before any tax deductions 
and social-security contributions payable by wage earners and retained by the employer. Source: Eurostat. When answering questions EMP.3 and EMP.10 which ask you to provide information on sector of 
employment, occupation and type of position you held, you need to refer to definitions 7 to 11 (see 
following pages). When asked about your occupation in EMP.3 and EMP.10, please provide a detailed description, 
including any area of specialisation, for example:  " College professor-Electrical engineering " ,  " Research 
mathematician "  or  " Network engineer, communication hardware " . DSTI/DOC(2012)7 73 Note that question EMP.10 asks about your most recent previous position only, even if you changed 
job more than once in the past 10 years. You may not be in a position to answer questions EMP.4 and EMP.5 unless it was a specified 
condition of employment. If that's the case, please tick option 6: Unknown. Furthermore, in questions EMP.4 and EMP.5, the response category  " postdoc "  refers to the type of 
position as outlined under question ECR.2. Definition 7: Sector of employment The business enterprise sector includes: @BULLET All firms, organisations and institutions whose primary activity is the market production of goods or services (other than higher education) for sale to the general public at an economically significant price. @BULLET The private non-profit institutions mainly serving them. The government sector includes: @BULLET All departments, offices and other bodies which furnish, but normally do not sell to the community, those common services, other than higher education, which cannot otherwise be conveniently and economically 
provided, as well as those that administer the state and the economic and social policy of the community. 
(Public enterprises mainly engaged in market production and sale of goods and services are included in the 
business enterprise sector.) @BULLET Non-profit institutions controlled and mainly financed by government, not administered by the higher education sector. The higher education sector is composed of: @BULLET All universities, colleges of technology and other institutions providing tertiary education, whatever their source of finance or legal status. @BULLET It also includes all research institutes, experimental stations and clinics under the direct control of or administered by or associated with higher education institutions. The other education sector is composed of all institutions providing pre-primary, primary or secondary 
education, whatever their source of finance or legal status. The private non-profit sector includes: @BULLET Non-market, private non-profit institutions serving households (i.e. the general public). @BULLET Private individuals or households. The market activities of unincorporated enterprises owned by households, i.e. consultants undertaking projects 
for another unit at an economically significant price, should be included in the business enterprise sector in line with 
National Accounts conventions (unless the project is undertaken using staff and facilities in another sector, see below).

households, i.e. individuals financed by their own resources or by  " uneconomic "  grants. Furthermore, where grants and contracts are formally awarded to individuals who are primarily employed in 
another sector, such as grants made directly to a university professor, unless such persons undertake the activity 
concerned entirely on their own time and make no use of their employing unit's staff and facilities, they should be

to distinguish temporary mobility from permanent mobility, to identify the reasons for departure and return 
as well as to provide data on your intentions to move out of the country within the next year including the 
destination planned. Of note is that mobility prior to receiving the advanced research qualification is 
included as well, if the qualification was earned less than ten years before the survey date.

naturalisation, whether by declaration, option, marriage or other means according to the national legislation. A citizen is therefore a person with the legal nationality of a country. In case of dual or multiple citizenships, the person should be counted only once and reported as citizen if he 
holds the nationality of the reporting country and as non-citizen in any other case. Source: Recommendations for the 2000 censuses of population and housing in the Economic Commission for Europe (ECE) region

as, or different from, the place where he/she actually is at the time of the survey; or it may be his/her legal residence. Permanent or usual residence in the reporting country or in other countries should be counted according to the 
national legislations and no attempt is made to harmonise. Legislation concerning residence can vary widely between 
countries and countries are asked to complete the tables in the way they can apply the concept of "permanent or usual
