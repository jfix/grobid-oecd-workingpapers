			<body>How to Spend It: Sovereign Wealth <lb/>Funds and the Wealth of Nations <lb/>♦ <lb/>Development economics can explain both saving sources and motives that have led to the recent SWF <lb/>boom, thus helping avoid investment restrictions in OECD countries. <lb/>♦ <lb/>As the economics underlying funds from oil exporting countries are different from the economics of <lb/>East Asian funds, so are the appropriate policy answers. <lb/>by Helmut Reisen, Counsellor, OECD Development Centre <lb/>Sovereign wealth funds (SWF) are government controlled <lb/>investment vehicles that are stimulating protectionist <lb/>sentiments in some OECD countries. Their asset size <lb/>(more than $3 billion) and their owners (governments) <lb/>create fertile ground for conspiracy theories, such as fear <lb/>of industrial espionnage or geopolitical threats. The funds <lb/>with assets higher than $100 billion are either <lb/>from oil exporting countries or from East Asia <lb/>(Table 1). <lb/>In fact, development economics point to four <lb/>major motives for countries to run such funds: <lb/>1) Foreign exchange reserves – mostly held <lb/>in US treasury bonds – have grown <lb/>excessively large: interest rate and <lb/>currency risk militate in favour of portfolio <lb/>diversification and central banks cannot <lb/>control monetary aggregates anymore. <lb/>2) Reducing resource dependence through <lb/>vertical and horizontal sector <lb/>diversification. <lb/>3) Responding to expected demographic <lb/>pressures, while smoothing consumption <lb/>levels of future generations when <lb/>resources are exhausted. <lb/>4) Raising production efficiency as a future <lb/>driver of growth. <lb/>The largest funds are either financed from <lb/>export receipts earned from a non-renewable <lb/>resource; or they result from very high <lb/>corporate or household saving rates and <lb/>saving surpluses. <lb/>Table 1.

Funds can also be helpful for <lb/>stabilising notoriously volatile raw material prices. The law <lb/>of diminishing returns forces oil exporters to invest a large <lb/>share of the savings abroad 1 . <lb/>Oil exporters would be forced to disregard both the <lb/>Hotelling and the Hartwick rules, if SWFs could not invest <lb/>in OECD countries. The Hotelling rule warns that lowering <lb/>the returns on investment from oil receipts, by preventing <lb/>investments by SWFs from oil-rich countries, would lead <lb/>to less oil supply and higher oil prices. <lb/>In oil-rich countries, this would lead to more intense waste <lb/>and corruption today and lower consumption tomorrow, <lb/>possibly with harsh geostrategic implications. In Where Is <lb/>the Wealth of Nations? the World Bank has calculated that <lb/>many resource-abundant economies do not follow the <lb/>Hartwick rule; they have negative &quot; genuine &quot; savings rates <lb/>and become poorer each year. This highlights the important <lb/>policy question of what resource rich economies can do to <lb/>avoid the resource curse. A fund can help, in that oil receipts <lb/>are eventually transformed into other forms of wealth. <lb/>In contrast to oil-rich countries, SWFs from East Asia are <lb/>financed through transfers from foreign exchange reserves. <lb/>For a decade, China has been providing &quot; cheap savings &quot; <lb/>to the United States as it extended supplier credits to pay <lb/>for the &quot; cheap goods &quot; the country used to export, holding <lb/>the accumulating reserves mostly in low-coupon US <lb/>treasury bonds. Now, with reserves at almost $1.5 trillion, <lb/>currency and interest risk was deemed excessive and <lb/>monetary control is lost due to exhausted sterilisation <lb/>capacity. Observing the Guidotti Rule 2 of covering all foreign <lb/>short-term debt plus three months of imports would require <lb/>China to hold $500 billion in reserves, roughly a third of <lb/>what it actually holds. These excess reserves plus future <lb/>saving surpluses represent the funding potential for China&apos;s <lb/>sovereign wealth funds. <lb/>To be sure, rapidly ageing populations and limited <lb/>immigration suggest the need for high savings to sustain <lb/>consumption levels in the future. When savings become <lb/>excessive and capital returns drop below the growth rate, <lb/>however, tax-financed pensions achieve that goal better than <lb/>fully-funded pensions. Mandatory savings and excessive <lb/>capital accumulation have resulted in &quot; dynamic inefficiency &quot; <lb/>in both China and Singapore, as shown by recent empirical <lb/>research. While in most OECD countries growth is driven by <lb/>productivity gains, it is rather factor accumulation that <lb/>explains growth in East Asia. In countries with &quot; dynamic <lb/>inefficiency &quot; , so much capital has been accumulated that <lb/>investment spending tends to exceed capital income; <lb/>investment is draining resources from the economy rather <lb/>than augmenting future consumption possibilities. <lb/>Next to shifting out of excessive reserves and saving for <lb/>future generations and old age, economic diversification <lb/>and efficiency gains are major economic motives for <lb/>establishing SWFs. The United Arab Emirates are using <lb/>their fund for rapid diversification of their economies away <lb/>from oil towards tourism, aerospace and finance. Such a <lb/>diversification motive is as legitimate as the desire to raise <lb/>the efficiency of their economy through acquiring stakes in <lb/>leading global companies. The perspective of raising <lb/>efficiency in funds allocation may well explain the recent <lb/>rush by SWFs to take stakes in US financial intermediaries <lb/>battered by the subprime lending crisis. <lb/>From the perspective of development economics, then, <lb/>there is little need for conspiracy theories to explain what <lb/>drives the funding and motivation of sovereign wealth funds. <lb/>Development economics thus can help the OECD in its <lb/>mandate to identify best practices for member countries <lb/>that receive foreign government-controlled investment. <lb/>1. <lb/>For an overview of the concepts underlying resource economics <lb/>see Avendano, R., H. Reisen and J. Santiso (2008), &quot; The Macro <lb/>Management of Asian Driver Related Commodity Induced Booms &quot; , <lb/>OECD Development Centre Working Paper (forthcoming). <lb/>2. <lb/>Reserves allow countries to smooth domestic absorption in <lb/>response to sudden stops in capital inflows. Popular rules of thumb <lb/>for policymakers have been linked to the current account, such as <lb/>maintaining reserves equivalent to three months of imports, or to the <lb/>capital account, notably the Guidotti rule of full coverage of total <lb/>short-term external debt. </body>
