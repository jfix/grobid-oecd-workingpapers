			<p>This paper presents an overview and analysis of the policy development at the EU level regarding<lb/> external labour migration (ELM). It reviews the shift in ELM policy at the EU level by examining<lb/> documents and debates. It looks at the treatment of ELM, setting out from the Amsterdam Treaty and then<lb/> follows the development up to the present, paying close attention to the evolving rational for increasing<lb/> ELM. The difference between the horizontal approach and the sectoral approach is explained. The major<lb/> ELM Directives under the sectoral approach are presented and discussed in terms of how they were<lb/> negotiated and how they fit into the overall ELM policy strategy.

			<figure>THE EUROPEAN UNION&apos;S EXTERNAL LABOUR MIGRATION POLICY; RATIONALE,<lb/> OBJECTIVES, APPROACHES AND RESULTS, 1999-2014<lb/> The Background<lb/></figure>

			<p>1.<lb/> The EU&apos;s declared need for third country labour migrants is not just any type of need. According<lb/> to most estimates put forward by the EU (but also by the UN and other organizations) the figures range in<lb/> the tens of millions for the coming five decades. In its 2005 &apos;Policy Plan on Legal Migration&apos;, the<lb/> European Commission (2005a: 4) warns that unless the EU manages to increase labour immigration the<lb/> EU&apos;s working age population is expected to contract by some 52 million by 2050. Furthermore, as is<lb/> underscored in the Commission&apos;s &apos;2012 Ageing Report&apos;, looking only to 2020, the EU would need a net<lb/> migration of 25 million in order to keep the working-age population stable at current level. This means that<lb/> the Union would have to net an additional 11 million migrants to the already projected 14 million (EC<lb/> <ref type="biblio">[European Commission]</ref> 2012a: 51–6). This provided, economic growth and migration growth have<lb/> become two sides of the same coin in the EU&apos;s economic and political ambitions. This was made clear<lb/> already in the Lisbon <ref type="biblio">Strategy (2000-2010</ref>) and now constitutes one of the cornerstones of &apos;Europe 2020&apos;,<lb/> the EU&apos;s current ten-year plan for growth (EC 2010a: 18; EC 2011a: 4). From the perspective of the<lb/> Commission, a large-scale increase in labour migration has become so urgent that the then Home Affairs<lb/> Commissioner referred to it as a matter of &apos;our economic survival&apos; (<ref type="biblio">Malmström 2010</ref>).<lb/> 2.<lb/> The ways in which the EU goes about this urgent undertaking is the topic of this paper. It focuses<lb/> on the Commission&apos;s current approach to external labour migration (ELM), its overarching rationale, core<lb/> objectives and the practical ways and means by which Brussels seeks to build common EU policy in the<lb/> area, often against the wishes of intransigent governments in the Council. Consequently, a substantial part<lb/> of this paper will be devoted to the EU directives relating to ELM that have been adopted so far,<lb/> accounting for their content as well as analysing how they correspond to the Commission&apos;s objectives.<lb/></p>

			<head>3.<lb/></head>

			<p>Before saying anything further about the more contemporary developments, however, it is<lb/> important to take note of the relatively recent nature of the Commission&apos;s current position as a strong<lb/> advocate of ELM, which thus differs from the quite consistent and continuous policy approach that the<lb/> Commission, since at least the early 1980s, has taken to the three other major areas of migration policy, i.e.<lb/> asylum, border security/&apos;illegal migration&apos; and free movement for EU citizens. From the early 1970s to the<lb/> late 1990s, and in sharp contrast to today, the Commission instead championed an official line of policy<lb/> that advised against labour migration to the EU from non-OECD countries. In its &apos;comprehensive<lb/> approach&apos; to migration, presented in 1994 (and originally drafted in 1991), the Commission advocated a<lb/> three-pronged strategy, calling for: (1) &apos;Taking action on migration pressure&apos;; (2) &apos;Controlling migration<lb/> flows&apos;; and (3) &apos;Strengthening integration policies for the benefit of legal immigrants&apos; (EC 1994: 11).<lb/> 4.<lb/> Deemed the only &apos;realistic&apos; option at the time, this (what is now referred to as) &apos;zero migration&apos;<lb/> policy also served as an important public relations tool from the mid-1980s and onwards, promising EU<lb/> citizens that the transformations brought about by the Single Market would not lead to an increase in<lb/> external migration (<ref type="biblio">Hansen &amp; Hager 2012</ref>). In an information booklet from 1996, for instance, addressing<lb/> the &apos;European citizen&apos;, Brussels took care to note that many &apos;are concerned about immigration <ref type="biblio">[…]</ref>,<lb/> thinking that this could increase once internal border controls have been fully swept away&apos;. The question<lb/> that many EU citizens were asking, according to the Commission, could thus be phrased as follows: &apos;Will<lb/> the eventual dismantling of all internal borders lead to an increase in levels of immigration to my country,<lb/> both from inside and outside the Community?&apos; To this the Commission could give a reassuring answer:<lb/> &apos;No, it should not. The fundamental point about dismantling the Community&apos;s internal borders is that this<lb/> process must be accompanied by the synchronized tightening of all external borders&apos; (EC 1996: 13–15).<lb/> 5.<lb/> By the turn of the millennium this, by now, habitual policy picture was to be significantly<lb/> revised. To be sure, the revision did not affect the pursuit of border security, which would continue<lb/> unabated. But it did involve a remarkable reversal of the EU&apos;s stance on ELM. All of a sudden, Brussels<lb/> would start issuing statements such as the following: &apos;The Commission considers that the zero immigration<lb/> mentioned in past Community discussion of immigration was never realistic and never really justified&apos;;<lb/> and &apos;it is clear from an analysis of the economic and demographic context of the Union and of the<lb/> countries of origin, that there is a growing recognition that the &quot; zero &quot; immigration policies of the</p>

			<table>past<lb/> 30 years<lb/> are<lb/> no<lb/> longer<lb/> appropriate&apos;<lb/> (EC 1999:<lb/> 2;<lb/> 2000:<lb/> 3).<lb/> The Role of Amsterdam and Tampere<lb/> 6.<lb/> This policy shift on ELM formed part of the larger conversion of EU migration policy brought<lb/> about by the Amsterdam Treaty in 1997 (ratified in 1999) 1 and the Tampere European Council in 1999, the<lb/> latter marking the first European Council ever devoted to Justice and Home Affairs (and thus to migration<lb/> issues). 2<lb/> 7.<lb/> Amsterdam&apos;s treaty changes and the bold objectives contained in the multiannual<lb/> Tampere Programme (1999–2004, resulting from the Tampere European Council) expanded the scope for<lb/> EU harmonization and supranational provisions with regard to migration policy. Ever since, as seen in the<lb/> number of directives and other legislation and policy initiatives, this scope has been consistently expanded<lb/> through Tampere&apos;s successor multi-annual programmes, i.e. the Hague (2004–2009) and Stockholm<lb/> Programmes (2009–2014), the European Pact on immigration and asylum, 3 and, most crucially, through<lb/> 1<lb/></table>

			<p>The Amsterdam Treaty marked a historical shift toward a significantly augmented role for the EU and the<lb/> supranational level in migration policy. With the overarching aim of developing the European Union as an<lb/> &apos;area of freedom, security and justice&apos;, Amsterdam laid down the broad outlines for a future EU policy on<lb/> migration and asylum. Upon ratification, the groundwork for such a policy was to be built incrementally<lb/> over a period of five years (1999–2004). Some of these changes were spelled out in Article 61 under<lb/> Amsterdam&apos;s new Title IV (&apos;Visas, asylum, immigration and other policies related to free movement of<lb/> persons&apos;, Articles 61–69):<lb/></p>

			<p>In order to establish progressively an area of freedom, security and justice, the Council shall adopt: (a)<lb/> within a period of five years after the entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam, measures aimed at<lb/> ensuring the free movement of persons <ref type="biblio">[…]</ref> in conjunction with directly related flanking measures with<lb/> respect to external border controls, asylum and immigration <ref type="biblio">[…]</ref> (b) other measures in the fields of<lb/> asylum, immigration and safeguarding the rights of nationals of third countries.<lb/> Further, Article 62 specified that measures should be adopted granting certain limited intra-EU mobility<lb/> rights to &apos;nationals of third countries&apos;. In addition, Article 63 outlined a series of measures on asylum and<lb/> immigration, calling for the adoption (within a period of five years) of a set &apos;minimum standards&apos; in the<lb/> area of asylum as well as &apos;measures on immigration policy within the following areas: (a) conditions of<lb/> entry and residence, and standards on procedures for the issue by Member States of long term visas and<lb/> residence permits, including those for the purpose of family reunion, (b) illegal immigration and illegal<lb/> residence, including repatriation of illegal residents&apos;; and &apos;measures defining the rights and conditions<lb/> under which nationals of third countries who are legally resident in a Member State may reside in other<lb/> Member States.&apos; As part of this reshuffling, Amsterdam also incorporated the Schengen acquis into the<lb/> treaty framework. As seen, and unlike its predecessor, Amsterdam did not confine itself to immigration and<lb/> asylum proper, but also introduced into the treaty explicit wordings concerning the Union&apos;s resident third-<lb/>country nationals (TCNs). Moreover, the treaty enacted an article to better equip the Union in its fight<lb/> against racism and other forms of discrimination. Owing to British, Irish, and Danish opposition, and in<lb/> order not to derail the negotiations, it became necessary to allow these countries to opt out of these new<lb/> provisions. Such opt-out, but also opt-in, agreements had to be codified in a series of complex protocols<lb/> (<ref type="biblio">see Hailbronner 1998; Hedemann-Robinson 1999</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<head>2<lb/></head>

			<p>At the Tampere European Council in 1999, under the heading &apos;A Common EU Asylum and Migration<lb/> Policy&apos;, the Council decided that &apos;a common European asylum system&apos; gradually should be put into<lb/> operation. Tampere also established that a major focus of the EU&apos;s efforts should be on the &apos;more efficient<lb/> management of migration flows at all their stages&apos;, on more effective external border controls and on<lb/> combating illegal immigration. In addition, Tampere declared that &apos;a more vigorous integration policy<lb/> should aim at granting&apos; third-country nationals &apos;rights and obligations comparable to those of EU citizens&apos;<lb/> (<ref type="biblio">European Council 1999</ref>).<lb/> the Lisbon Treaty (ratified in 2009), the latter making the Community method of decision and law making<lb/> applicable also to ELM. 4 As the Treaty&apos;s Title I on &apos;Common Provisions&apos; (Art. 3) stipulates:<lb/></p>

			<p>The Union shall offer its citizens an area of freedom, security and justice without internal frontiers, in<lb/> which the free movement of persons is ensured in conjunction with appropriate measures with respect<lb/> to external border controls, asylum, immigration and the prevention and combating of crime.<lb/> 8.<lb/> In the new Title V, Chapter 2, moreover, the Lisbon Treaty widens Amsterdam&apos;s rather limited<lb/> latitude for immigration policy (as distinct from policies on asylum and illegal immigration) by explicating,<lb/> in Article 79, that &apos;The Union shall develop a common immigration policy&apos; and that this should aim at<lb/> &apos;ensuring, at all stages, the efficient management of migration flows, fair treatment of third-country<lb/> nationals residing legally in Member States, and the prevention of, and enhanced measures to combat,<lb/> illegal immigration and trafficking in human beings&apos;. While the terms &apos;labour immigration&apos; or &apos;legal<lb/> immigration&apos; are not explicitly spelled out in the Treaty, the references to &apos;common immigration policy&apos;<lb/> &apos;management of migration flows&apos; and &apos;fair treatment of third-country nationals residing legally in Member<lb/> States&apos; are nonetheless proof of ELM&apos;s conditional recognition as a common policy area. Such recognition<lb/> is also provided by way of emphasizing conditionality, such as in Article 79 and its stipulation: &apos;This<lb/> Article shall not affect the right of Member States to determine volumes of admission of third-country<lb/> nationals coming from third countries to their territory in order to seek work, whether employed or self-<lb/>employed.&apos; In emphasizing the conditionality of a &apos;common immigration policy&apos; the Treaty is also<lb/> acknowledging that such a policy does, in fact, include ELM, which is contained in the formulation &apos;in<lb/> order to seek work&apos;.<lb/> 9.<lb/> However, looking at the policy development over the past fifteen years since Amsterdam and<lb/> Tampere, the achievements with regard to ELM have been both meagre and fragmented. As such, ELM<lb/> has clearly taken a backseat to the far more prioritized and interrelated areas of &apos;illegal migration&apos;, border<lb/> security, asylum, visa, return and readmission. 5<lb/> 4<lb/></p>

			<p>The Community method refers foremost to qualified majority voting in the Council and EP co-decision<lb/> powers. The Lisbon Treaty also expanded the Court of Justice&apos;s say in EU immigration law by, inter alia,<lb/> giving the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights binding legal status as well as providing for the accession of<lb/> the EU to the European Convention of Human Rights (see e.g. Douglas-Scott 2011).<lb/></p>

			<head>5<lb/></head>

			<p>It needs mention here that the EU also has sought to gain influence in the area of migrant integration<lb/> policy, based, initially, on the Amsterdam Treaty&apos;s implicit authorization; on Tampere&apos;s declaration &apos;that a<lb/> more vigorous integration policy should aim at granting&apos; TCNs &apos;rights and obligations comparable to those<lb/> of EU citizens&apos; (EC 2001a: 2); the Hague and Stockholm Programmes&apos; as well as Europe 2020&apos;s further<lb/> affirmations; and, finally, the Lisbon Treaty&apos;s (first ever) explicit mention of migrant integration as having<lb/> a legal basis (albeit a very weak one). As stated in Lisbon&apos;s Article 79. 4: &apos;The European Parliament and<lb/> the Council, acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure, may establish measures to<lb/> provide incentives and support for the action of Member States with a view to promoting the integration of<lb/> third-country nationals residing legally in their territories, excluding any harmonisation of the laws and<lb/> regulations of the Member States.&apos; Apart from non-binding declarations, the adoption of integration<lb/> principles and agreement on the Commission&apos;s role in monitoring and assisting the member states in<lb/> integration matters (e.g. the &apos;Common basic principles for immigrant integration policy in the European<lb/> Union&apos; <ref type="biblio">[see Council EU 2004a; 2004b: 19–20; EC 2005c]</ref>, and the subsequent &apos;European Agenda for the<lb/> Integration of Third-Country Nationals&apos; <ref type="biblio">[EC 2011d]</ref>), this policy has not gone beyond supranational<lb/> measures relating to various types of mobility for resident TCNs within the Union. However, since such<lb/> integration measures, when being the subject of concrete legislative measures – as seen in several of the<lb/> directives dealt with in this paper – primarily are framed in terms of labour mobility and less as integration,<lb/> this paper will group such measures as forming part of EU labour migration and mobility policy rather than<lb/> EU migrant integration policy.<lb/></p>

			<p>The caption of Chapter 2 under Lisbon&apos;s Title V, which reads &apos;Policies on border checks, asylum and<lb/> immigration&apos;, thus serves as an accurate description of the ranking of policy preference within the Council.<lb/></p>

			<head>The Commission&apos;s Rationale and Objectives for Increasing ELM<lb/></head>

			<p>10.<lb/> In this context meagre results of course relate to the Commission&apos;s objectives. But what are these<lb/> more precisely, and how should we construe them in more analytical terms?<lb/> 11.<lb/> As already seen, medium and long-term demographic projections constitute the foundation for<lb/> the Commission&apos;s outlook. They have been used consistently throughout as justification of Brussels&apos;<lb/> stance and to drive home the point that ELM is above all structurally determined and, as such, should not<lb/> be allowed to be compromised by immediate business cycle and unemployment concerns, but rather needs<lb/> to be seen as an increasingly urgent necessity in order to sustain growth, competitiveness and social<lb/> welfare in the EU. Instead of the member states going it alone, devising between themselves inconsistent<lb/> responses (or few responses at all) at odds with the overall functioning of EU, the Commission approaches<lb/> these demographically induced migration challenges as calling for common, coordinated and increasingly<lb/> harmonized policies.<lb/> 12.<lb/> From the demographic projections, giving at hand a rapidly aging Union, the Commission then<lb/> derives in more detail the short, medium and the long-term labour demand with regard to skills required,<lb/> sectoral assessments and overall structural changes in the labour market. Important to keep in mind is that<lb/> the Commission does not foresee ELM as the sole solution to the demographic deficit. However, what is<lb/> interesting is that the Commission is leaning more and more in this direction. For some time, as reflected in<lb/> the Commission&apos;s (2005a: 5) &apos;Policy Plan on Legal Migration&apos; from 2005, the official view was that<lb/> &apos;Immigration does not provide in itself a long-term solution to falling birth rates and an ageing population,<lb/> but it is one of the available tools within a broader policy mix.&apos; Since then, however, and as seen in<lb/> numerous statements and documents, not least in the Commission&apos;s earlier cited &apos;2012 Ageing Report&apos;,<lb/> ELM is more and more deemed as, if not the only remedy, certainly the most important one, equipped with<lb/> fairly detailed estimates of the required volumes of migrants and the serious consequences from failure to<lb/> act in accordance.<lb/> 13.<lb/> This tendency is reflected too in Brussels&apos; increasingly alarmist and frustrated calls for member<lb/> state cooperation on ELM, or as put by the then Home Affairs Commissioner Cecilia Malmström: &apos;When I<lb/> meet ministers responsible for labour policies, they almost all speak of the need for immigrant workers—<lb/> and it&apos;s true, we need hundreds of thousands, millions in the long term. But when the ministers go and<lb/> speak in front of their national publics, this message is not to be heard at all.&apos; (quoted in <ref type="biblio">Barber 2011)<lb/></ref> 14.<lb/> Besides expanding ELM as such, the Commission also aims to increase the admission of<lb/> students, researchers and other categories of TCNs more indirectly related to the labour market; this in<lb/> order to cope with a severe shortage of researchers, in particular, and to facilitate these groups&apos; future<lb/> labour market participation and contributions to innovation and entrepreneurship, in general.<lb/> 15.<lb/> Integral to the goal of increasing ELM is also the goal of increasing the internal mobility of third<lb/> country labour in the EU. This requires that both long-term resident and newly arrived third country<lb/> nationals (TCNs) are provided with free movement rights that are more in line with those of EU citizens.<lb/> For the Commission this is crucial in order to optimize the allocation of labour and to ensure greater<lb/> flexibility on the EU&apos;s labour market.<lb/></p>

			<figure>16.<lb/> The rationale and goals relating to ELM are embedded in the &apos;overarching framework of the<lb/> EU External Migration Policy&apos; (EC 2011b: 5), entitled the Global Approach to Migration and Mobility<lb/> (GAMM), first adopted in 2005 and renewed in 2011, now with a more marked ELM profile. 6</figure>

			<p>Here, &apos;all<lb/> relevant aspects of migration&apos; are accounted for and brought together into a &apos;comprehensive&apos;, &apos;coherent&apos;<lb/> and &apos;balanced&apos; framework for the purpose of managing migration and mobility to the benefit of both the<lb/> EU and the sending countries (EC 2011b; 2014d). As one of GAMM&apos;s thematic priorities has it:<lb/></p>

			<p>Good governance of migration and mobility of third countries nationals can create value on a daily<lb/> basis for the development of millions of people, increase the EU&apos;s competitiveness and enrich<lb/> European societies. This makes the Global Approach a core strategic interest of the EU and its<lb/> Member States. With an increasingly global labour market for the highly skilled, there is already<lb/> strong competition for talent. (EC 2011b: 5)<lb/> 17.<lb/> GAMM thus explains how to construe the links between ELM and all the other prioritized areas<lb/> of EU migration policy (i.e. asylum, &apos;illegal&apos; migration, border security and visa policy); but it also<lb/> underscores ELM&apos;s close alignment with EU foreign and development policy. As such, GAMM contains<lb/> and seeks to develop in concert everything from supranational legislation and instruments with a firm<lb/> treaty basis, on the one side, to more loosely defined policy proposals and agreements, unbinding<lb/> declarations and future plans and visions, on the other.<lb/> 18.<lb/> Apart from the work that has gone into specific ELM directives, GAMM reveals the persistent<lb/> work that the Commission also has invested in furthering the cause of ELM in a number of EU policy<lb/> processes, collaborations, formalized partnerships, dialogues and negotiations with single third countries,<lb/> groups of countries, regional and other international organizations. Alongside measure to create<lb/> cooperation with third countries on &apos;illegal&apos; immigration, border security, readmission and refugee<lb/> reception, much effort is thus also devoted to make these compatible with the opening of new and<lb/> development-enhancing channels for legal labour migration to the EU (EC 2011g).<lb/> 19.<lb/> In the wake of the upheavals in North Africa and the war in Libya, EU migration policy activity<lb/> targeting North Africa has grown exponentially. According to the Commission, the crises and<lb/> transformations taking place in North Africa have accentuated the need for improved migration<lb/> management in the Mediterranean area, so as to facilitate, within the GAMM framework, legal migration<lb/> for North Africans in need of work and to help the EU meet key labour demands and amend its<lb/> demographic problems. In order to set in train such a mutually beneficial dynamic the Commission<lb/> proposed, in March 2011, to develop &apos;a partnership on migration, mobility and security with the Southern<lb/> Mediterranean countries&apos; (EC 2011c). The focus here is to promote circular labour migration to the EU,<lb/> built on &apos;real&apos; and &apos;clearly identified labour demands&apos;, that will &apos;help to meet the need for highly skilled<lb/> workers in the expanding sectors of the EU&apos;s economy but also help fill many jobs requiring a mix of<lb/> lower skills&apos; (EC 2011c: 7, 9). The Commission has stepped up these efforts further following the refugee<lb/> catastrophe at Lampedusa, which gave rise to the Task Force Mediterranean, calling for safe legal<lb/> migration channels to the EU (EC 2013d).<lb/> 20.<lb/> Within various bilateral frameworks sorting under GAMM, such as the European Neighbourhood<lb/> Policy, the EU-Africa Strategic Partnership on Migration, Mobility and Employment and other<lb/> partnerships and agreements with third countries, 7 policies are enacted and developed to facilitate ELM,<lb/> mostly focusing on so-called circular migration, &apos;i.e. migrants coming to the EU for short periods and<lb/> going back to a third country after the end of the contract.&apos; (EC 2014b; see also EC 2007c; 2011b). 8<lb/> Among the most important concrete policy instruments in this context are the (bilateral and unbinding)<lb/> Mobility Partnerships—focusing on effective, secure and flexible management of movement between the<lb/> EU and third countries— that the EU (to date) has signed with seven third countries, 9 as well as the<lb/> Common Agendas on Migration and Mobility (EC 2011c).<lb/> 21.<lb/> Yet, when speaking of compatibility between policies on &apos;illegal&apos; immigration, border security<lb/> and readmission, on the one side, and ELM, on the other, this should not be understood as a symmetric<lb/> relationship; rather, it is a highly asymmetrical one where the latter is to be made compatible with the<lb/> former. This could also be expressed as the golden rule of security-comes-first in EU migration policy, a<lb/> rule that has been criticised from within the European Parliament and by numerous NGOs and scholars<lb/> since the supranational level first tried to gain a say over external migration policy in the mid-1980s (see<lb/> <ref type="biblio">Hansen &amp; Hager 2012; European Parliament 1990</ref>). It should also be mentioned that many analysts<lb/> assumed that the Commission&apos;s new affirmative position on ELM at the turn of the new millennium would<lb/> (logically) induce a toning down of the strong emphasis on migration security. These hopes, however,<lb/> where soon frustrated by Brussels&apos; decision to make sure that its repeal of &apos;zero immigration&apos; was<lb/> combined with a renewed pledge to EU citizens of strengthening migration security even further. This was<lb/> visible early on, such as in 2002 when the Commission (2002: 8) pointed to the merits of &apos;forced return of<lb/> illegal residents&apos;, arguing that this could &apos;help to ensure public acceptance for more openness towards new<lb/> legal immigrants against the background of more open admission policies particularly for labour migrants.&apos;<lb/> 22.<lb/> Security, then, as in border security, policy to combat &apos;illegal&apos; migration and the plethora of other<lb/> migration control instruments developed within the EU framework, serves as the primary rationale and<lb/> objective that both practically and principally over determines ELM in all its forms, although it is less<lb/> emphasized in migration policy involving the highly qualified and high-skilled. 10 As the Commission<lb/> (2011a: 7) has emphasized on numerous occasions in recent years, the EU must &apos;ensure that the need for<lb/> enhanced mobility does not undermine the security of the Union&apos;s external borders&apos;; and therefore &apos;The<lb/> control of the EU&apos;s external border must be continuously improved to respond to new migration and<lb/> security challenges.&apos; &apos;Citizens&apos;, moreover, &apos;need to feel reassured that external border controls are working<lb/> properly&apos;, and authorities thus need to demonstrate that &apos;<ref type="biblio">[p]</ref>reventing irregular migration and maintaining<lb/> public security are compatible with the objective of increased mobility&apos; (EC 2011a: 7, 11). Or, in a third<lb/> formulation: &apos;Without well-functioning border controls, lower levels of irregular migration and an<lb/> effective return policy, it will not be possible for the EU to offer more opportunities for legal migration and<lb/> mobility. The legitimacy of any policy framework relies on this.&apos; (EC 2011b: 5, italics in original; see also<lb/> EC 2014a: 2; Council EU 2012) In its contribution to the UN High-level Dialogue on International<lb/> Migration and Development in 2013, finally, the Commission (2013a: 4) makes sure to stress that &apos;In the<lb/> absence of effective governance, the costs of migration may be significant, and can include social tensions<lb/> with host populations—often exploited by populist forces—and pressure on scarce resources. Uncontrolled<lb/> migration may also aggravate security threats&apos;.<lb/></p>

			<p>For in-depth accounts on circular migration as it relates to EU policy, see the contributions in<lb/> <ref type="biblio">Triandafyllidou</ref> (2013); Cassarion (2008); Venturini (2008); Feldman (2012); Carrera &amp; Hernández<lb/> iSagrera (2009).<lb/> 9<lb/> These are Moldova, Cape Verde, Georgia, Armenia, Morocco, Azerbaijan and Tunisia.<lb/> 10<lb/> As indicated in the EU&apos;s &apos;Key messages&apos; to the UN High Level Dialogue on International Migration and<lb/> Development: &apos;All states should review existing barriers to human mobility, with a view to remove barriers<lb/> which are not justified from a security point of view and are unnecessarily hindering economic<lb/> competitiveness and regional integration&apos; (EC 2013a: 11).<lb/></figure>

			<p>23.<lb/> It is crucial to keep in mind, therefore, that whereas migration security constitutes a key objective<lb/> in and of itself, ELM is always made conditional on security. To the extent that the Commission is<lb/> determined to create a productive dynamic between the security oriented prevention of illegal immigration,<lb/> on the one side, and the growth and competitiveness oriented aspiration for a large-scale increase in ELM,<lb/> on the other, this dynamic needs to be construed as being founded on an asymmetrical relation.<lb/></p>

			<head>The Commission&apos;s Approach<lb/></head>

			<p>24.<lb/> Before turning to the actual legislation that have been achieved up to this point, something should<lb/> be said too about how the Commission has gone about its task of initiating legislation and getting<lb/> directives adopted on ELM.<lb/> 25.<lb/> Put simply, the Commission has been pursuing two approaches or strategies. The one launched<lb/> initially, referred to as the horizontal approach, sought to create a broad general common framework for<lb/> the admission, residence conditions and the rights granted to any TCNs engaging in paid work and self-<lb/>employed economic activities. The first major directive proposal on ELM, presented by the Commission in<lb/> 2001 and drawing on Tampere&apos;s mandate, strove for a high level of harmonisation, simplicity,<lb/> transparency and as little differentiation as possible amongst third country workers—hence the horizontal<lb/> approach. Basically, TCNs admitted for work in the EU should be treated as one single category and there<lb/> was also explicit mention of a &apos;pathway&apos; to permanent residence for those admitted. To be sure, member<lb/> states were to retain &apos;the right to limit admission&apos; as well as being provided with other forms of discretion;<lb/> and the principle of preference of the domestic labour market&apos;s workers over TCNs was also to apply (EC<lb/></p>

			<figure>2001b).<lb/> 26.<lb/> While the directive proposal was given a favourable response by the European Parliament and the<lb/> European Economic and Social Committee (EESC), the Council would have none of it; the proposal was,<lb/> as Peers (2009: 410) puts it, &apos;dead on arrival in the Council&apos;. 11<lb/> 27.<lb/> But although the horizontal approach had been effectively blocked, this did not prevent the<lb/> Commission from forwarding new directive proposals. But in the process the Commission&apos;s strategy was<lb/> to change, something that was made official in its 2005 &apos;Policy Plan on Legal Migration&apos; (EC 2005a). The<lb/> Plan, which was drawn up at the request of the Hague European Council (in 2004), was preceded by the<lb/> Commission&apos;s &apos;Green Paper on an EU Approach to Managing Economic Migration&apos; (EC 2005b</figure>

			<p>), which<lb/> presented a set of options for the future development of ELM as well as initiating a public consultation<lb/> process on this very matter. In the Green Paper the foiled horizontal approach was still presented as one of<lb/> the options. However, since it was prefaced with the Commission&apos;s acknowledgement of having<lb/> considered the member states&apos; reservations it was clear that it was no longer a viable option, but merely<lb/> included for the purpose of reaffirming the Commission&apos;s preferred approach. In order to break the<lb/> deadlock with the Council over ELM, the Commission went on to present a sectoral approach as its second<lb/> main option, and it did so on the merit of having already presented, in 2002 and 2004 respectively, two<lb/> separate sectoral directives for the entry and residence of third country students and researchers (as<lb/> discussed below).<lb/> 28.<lb/> In the public consultation process on the Green Paper, several of the stakeholders expressed<lb/> scepticism toward the sectoral approach, cautioning that it would create a differential and fragmented<lb/> policy picture whereby rules and rights would apply differently and unequally to different categories of<lb/> TCNs. While the European Parliament&apos;s (2005: point 26) resolution advised against a sectoral legislation,<lb/> the EESC (2005: 4) went further, stating that &apos;<ref type="biblio">[i]</ref>f the European Council were to opt for a sectoral approach<lb/> (geared towards highly skilled migrants), it would be discriminatory in nature.&apos;<lb/> 29.<lb/> Such objections notwithstanding, the Policy Plan on Legal Migration confirmed the sectoral<lb/> approach as the Commission&apos;s new strategy, one it, in actuality, had already embarked on in the student<lb/> and researchers directives. More specifically the Policy Plan outlined a roadmap for the next four years,<lb/> specifying that the Commission&apos;s priority would be to table five directives in all, four of which were to<lb/> address sector specific categories of migrants (highly skilled, seasonal, intra-corporate transferees and<lb/> remunerated trainees, as attended to below). In addition to this there would also be a proposal for a<lb/> framework directive (or single permit) defining basic rights for labour migrants (EC 2005a).<lb/> 30.<lb/> In what follows these and other directives (9 in total) 12 relating to ELM are discussed, focusing<lb/> both on their specific content and goals, as well as how they measure up to the Commission&apos;s more general<lb/> and overarching rationale and objectives.<lb/></p>

			<head>The Directives<lb/> The Long-Term Residence Directive<lb/></head>

			<figure>31.<lb/> As already noted, the Commission proposed directives relating to ELM prior the 2005 Policy<lb/> Plan; and although the failed horizontal proposal from 2001 counts as the first substantial one, important<lb/> ELM components were also included in the even earlier directive proposal (March 2001, EC 2001a)<lb/> concerning the status of third country nationals who are long-term residents, which was adopted in<lb/> November 2003. The Directive (Dir. 2003/109/EC) 13 establishes the conditions under which a member<lb/> state confers (and revokes) long-term resident status and accompanying rights to legally resident TCNs. 14<lb/></figure>

			<p>Most importantly for the purposes here, the directive also lays down the rules concerning the rights of<lb/> residence for TCNs in member states other than the one that has granted them long-term resident status.<lb/> 32.<lb/> As stipulated in the directive, the status of long-term resident should be given to applying TCNs<lb/> &apos;who have resided legally and continuously&apos; in a member state for five years. Other key requirements<lb/> specify that TCNs must demonstrate &apos;stable and regular resources&apos; that are adequate to support themselves<lb/> and their family dependants, &apos;without recourse to the social assistance system of the Member State<lb/> concerned&apos;; that they have sickness insurance; and that they abide by national integration obligations<lb/> where such apply.<lb/> 33.<lb/> While this directive does not speak directly to the Commission&apos;s objective of increasing ELM—it<lb/> exclusively addresses the conditions for TCNs already residing in the EU—it aligns very well with<lb/> Brussels long-standing goal of closing the rights and labour mobility gap between member state nationals,<lb/> or EU citizens, and legally resident TCNs. This goal has been on the Commission&apos;s agenda since the early<lb/> 1970s, as seen in these strong wordings from 1974:<lb/> 12<lb/></p>

			<p>With one exception, all of the directives discussed here have been adopted; the ones on seasonal migration<lb/> and ICTs are still awaiting transposition. The one exception concerns a directive incorporating remunerated<lb/> trainees; this category is currently incorporated in a directive proposal, still under negotiation, &apos;on the<lb/> conditions of entry and residence of third-country nationals for the purposes of research, studies, pupil<lb/> exchange, remunerated and unremunerated training, voluntary service and au pairing&apos; (EC 2013b).<lb/></p>

			<figure>13<lb/> Council Directive 2003/109/EC of 25November 2003 concerning the status of third-country nationals who<lb/> are long-term residents. The UK, Ireland and Denmark do not take part in this directive.<lb/> 14<lb/> As of 2013, according to Eurostat, TCNs made up 4 per cent of the EU&apos;s population (or 20.4 million) (EC<lb/> 2014b: 3).<lb/> <ref type="biblio">[T]</ref>he legal situation of migrant workers coming from third countries depends on the status accorded<lb/> to them by the host country. <ref type="biblio">[…]</ref> The result is that migrant workers from third countries are generally<lb/> treated less favourably than workers coming from the Member States, and the situation of these third<lb/> country migrants varies considerably from one country to another. <ref type="biblio">[T]</ref>he social conditions of the<lb/> migrant do indeed give cause for serious concern—especially in the case of third country migrants,<lb/> who have no Community protection and rely solely on often restrictive national legislation <ref type="biblio">[…]</ref> For<lb/> this reason solutions in common must be found, not only to the problems of Community migrants but<lb/> also for those from third countries. These solutions must take account of the migrant workers&apos; needs<lb/> and their rightful place in a society to whose prosperity and well-being they contribute. As the migrant<lb/> population increases, and they remain longer in the Community, so their interests in the affluent<lb/> society around them increases and their sense of exclusion from it can become more acute (EC 1976<lb/> <ref type="biblio">[1974]</ref>: 14, 12).<lb/> 34.<lb/> Thirty years later the Commission&apos;s perseverance can be said to have borne some fruit in the<lb/> long-term resident directive (LTR), which was made possible by the Amsterdam Treaty&apos;s Article 63, the<lb/> Tampere European Council and the Tampere Programme&apos;s commitment to &apos;safeguarding the rights of third<lb/> country nationals&apos;.<lb/></p>

			<head>35.<lb/></head>

			<p>The pledge to improve the lot of the EU&apos;s legal and permanently settled TCNs was clearly one of<lb/> the boldest declarations made in Tampere and, as such, it is asserted in the preambles to all but one of the<lb/> directives discussed in this paper; in most of them, moreover, &apos;the protection of the rights of third-country<lb/> nationals&apos; appears in the preamble&apos;s first recital. By stating that &apos;a more vigorous integration policy should<lb/> aim at granting them <ref type="biblio">[TCNs]</ref> rights and obligations comparable to those of EU citizens&apos;, the Council<lb/> opened up for a revision of the legal restraints built into the EU citizenship that was instituted by the<lb/> Maastricht Treaty. It must be emphasized, though, that neither Amsterdam nor the declarations in Tampere<lb/> indicated that permanently settled TCNs were about to become naturalized EU citizens any time soon, or,<lb/> for that matter, that long-term residence was about to replace nationality as the determining principle of EU<lb/> citizenship (<ref type="biblio">Kostakopoulou 2002: 452</ref>). This provided, the strategy adopted by the Commission since then,<lb/> and as clearly reflected in the LTR directive, has rather been geared toward making the most of Tampere&apos;s<lb/> pledge to grant rights to TCNs that are &apos;comparable to those of EU citizens&apos;.<lb/> 36.<lb/> To improve TCNs&apos; intra-EU mobility rights is of course crucial to this strategy. &apos;A genuine area<lb/> of freedom, security and justice&apos;, the Commission (EC 2001a: 8) affirmed in the LTR directive proposal in<lb/> 2001, &apos;is unthinkable without a degree of mobility for third-country nationals residing there legally, and<lb/> particularly for those residing on a long-term basis&apos;. With the adoption of the LTR directive, then, the<lb/> Commission gained (somewhat of) a hearing for its repeated calls for facilitating TCNs&apos; intra-EU mobility<lb/> and residence.<lb/> 37.<lb/> The Commission&apos;s attempt to expand the scope of free movement to also incorporate TCNs must<lb/> be understood in the context of its perpetual mission to stimulate labour mobility within the EU area. In the<lb/> LTR directive proposal the Commission contended that to continue barring legally resident TCNs from the<lb/> free movement provisions runs counter to &apos;the demands of an employment market that is in a process of<lb/> far-reaching change, where greater flexibility is needed&apos; (EC 2001a: 8):<lb/></p>

			<p>The evolution of the employment market in the Union is highlighting employment shortages in certain<lb/> sectors of the economy. Third-country nationals who are long-term residents may be ready and willing<lb/> to relocate either in order to put their vocational skills to work in another Member State or to escape<lb/> unemployment in the Member State where they reside. The mobility of long-term residents can thus<lb/> make for better utilisation of employment reserves available in different Member States (EC 2001a:8).<lb/> 38.<lb/> It is in this larger context that the objectives of the LTR directive (and subsequent directives that<lb/> similarly seek to facilitate TCNs&apos; intra-EU mobility) need to be situated; or as stated in the LTR directive&apos;s<lb/> preamble: &apos;It could also constitute a major factor of mobility, notably on the Union&apos;s employment market.&apos;<lb/> Permanently settled TCNs constitute an untapped labour reserve that, once unhampered by the EU&apos;s<lb/> internal borders, could help remedy recurrent labour shortages in growth industries and other labour market<lb/> distortions across the Union. Moreover, since TCNs suffer disproportionately from unemployment, the<lb/> Commission seems to presume they should be more prone (given their weaker bargaining position) to<lb/> intra-EU labour mobility than are member state nationals. As such, the LTR directive does, in fact,<lb/> indirectly promote the goal of increasing ELM, both by providing for mobility within the EU that could<lb/> increase third country labour flows to some member states (that might suffer comparatively more from<lb/> labour shortages and demographic imbalances) and by enabling onward movement of third country labour<lb/> migrants from member states with more open ELM policies (and thus higher inflows) to members with<lb/> more restrictive policies; in the latter case the directive would have a positive impact on absolute numbers.<lb/> 39.<lb/> Yet, it needs emphasizing that the mobility rights offered to TCNs by the LTR directive are<lb/> nowhere near those contained in EU citizenship provisions; also, the directive was a far cry from the<lb/> Commission&apos;s original proposal for such a directive (as tabled in 2001), which aimed to provide TCNs<lb/> with more rights. As with all the directives covered in this paper, moreover, the LTR directive is fraught<lb/> with exceptions and red-tape, and with regard to rights and equal treatment for the long-term resident<lb/> TCNs numerous disparities prevail, both as concern the situation in the granting member state and the<lb/> conditions applying to a long-term resident who wishes to move to another member state. In the latter case,<lb/> just to point to one of many derogations, non-granting member states are allowed to &apos;limit the total number<lb/> of persons entitled to be granted right of residency&apos; (Art 14: 4), a derogation highlighting member states&apos;<lb/> refusal give a blank cheque to TCNs&apos; intra-EU movement. Reflecting the fragmented and stratified scope,<lb/> which in turn results from the failure of adopting a more horizontal approach (as discussed above), the<lb/> directive exempts no less than six categories of TCNs from its provisions. In 2011 the Commission<lb/> managed to have the directive amended in order &apos;to extend its scope to beneficiaries of international<lb/> protection&apos; (Dir. 2011/51/EU), 15 a category who is now also eligible for long-term resident status.<lb/></p>

			<head>The Student and Researchers Directives<lb/></head>

			<p>40.<lb/> Adopted a year after the LTR directive, the so-called Student Directive (Dir. 2004/114/EC) 16 also<lb/> deserves mention here. As with the former this directive is neither explicitly tied to the goal of increasing<lb/> and facilitating ELM; in fact, it is explicitly dissociated from &apos;the labour-market situation in the host<lb/> country&apos;. Yet, since it concerns itself with (treaty and Tampere) provisions directly pertaining to the<lb/> &apos;approximation&apos; of the member states&apos; rules on admission and residence of TCNs as well the improvement<lb/> of TCNs&apos; situation in the EU, it is clearly worth consideration in the wider ELM context. Not the least due<lb/> to the obvious fact that third country students who have their foot inside the door very well might be<lb/> recruited for work in the EU at a later stage.<lb/> 41.<lb/> Setting out from the broad objectives of championing the EU as an educational &apos;world centre of<lb/> excellence&apos; and promoting third country student mobility to the EU, the immediate purpose of the directive<lb/> is to create a common legal framework defining the conditions and procedural rules for admission of TCNs<lb/> to the EU &apos;for a period exceeding three months for the purpose of studies, pupil exchange, unremunerated<lb/> training or voluntary service&apos;. Whereas the directive &apos;shall apply&apos; to TCNs who apply for purposes of study<lb/></p>

			<figure>15<lb/> Directive 2011/51/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 May 2011 amending Council<lb/> Directive 2003/109/EC to extend its scope to beneficiaries of international protection.<lb/> 16<lb/> Council Directive 2004/114/EC, of 13 December 2004, on the conditions of admission of third-country<lb/> nationals, for the purposes of studies, pupil exchange, unremunerated training or voluntary service. The<lb/> UK, Ireland and Denmark do not take part in this directive.<lb/></figure>

			<p>(i.e. higher education), member states &apos;may also decide&apos; to have the other activities fall within the<lb/> directive&apos;s scope. As part the wider focus on mobility, the directive stipulates that students who apply to<lb/> conduct a part of their studies at a higher education establishment in a member state other than the one they<lb/> were first admitted to &apos;shall be admitted&apos; to that member state in due course and pending certain<lb/> conditions. Equally relevant in this context, and notwithstanding the preamble&apos;s explication that the<lb/> directive&apos;s migration provisions are not conditioned by &apos;the labour-market situation in the host country&apos;, is<lb/> the fact that &apos;students shall be entitled to be employed and may be entitled to exercise self-employed<lb/> economic activity&apos; (Art. 17). To be sure, however, member states are allowed to impose a number of<lb/> restrictions in this area.<lb/></p>

			<figure>42.<lb/> Closely related to the Student Directive, the so-called Researchers Directive (Dir. 2005/71/EC) 17<lb/> was adopted in October 2005. Aiming to attract third country researchers to the EU and forming an integral<lb/> part of the creation of a European Research Area and the Lisbon Strategy&apos;s goal of turning the EU into &apos;the<lb/> most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world by 2010&apos;, this directive was also<lb/> launched for the more particular purpose of contributing to the target (set in 2003) of having an additional<lb/> 700 000 researchers working in the Union by 2010 (via a goal of earmarking 3% of GDP for investment in<lb/> research).<lb/></figure>

			<p>43.<lb/> Conditional on a hosting agreement with a research organization, the directive establishes the<lb/> (simplified) admission terms for researchers from third countries who are to carry out research in a<lb/> member state for more than three months. The researchers are granted rights comparable to those of<lb/> member state nationals in a number of areas (much in line with the LTR directive), but in contrast to<lb/> students and doctoral students (under the Student directive) they are afforded more favourable intra-EU<lb/> mobility rights and they are afforded both family reunification and EU mobility for family members<lb/> (neither of these apply to students). As Chou (2012: 1062) notes, moreover, and contrary to future ELM<lb/> directives (e.g. the Blue Card directive), the principle of Community preference, or labour market test,<lb/> does not apply to the directive.<lb/> 44.<lb/> Although third country researchers, as by definition, always will involve relatively few people,<lb/> this directive nonetheless answers directly to the Commission&apos;s goal of increasing ELM, at least in the<lb/> high-skilled category; this too, since it exclusively addresses third country nationals (and their family<lb/> members) who will migrate to the EU, as opposed to TCNs who are already EU residents. Together with<lb/> the student directive it is also of some principal and symbolic importance since it conforms to the<lb/> Commission&apos;s long-standing goal, dating to the Single Market relaunch in the early 1980s (<ref type="biblio">Geddes 2000:<lb/> 70</ref>), of supranational harmonization of migrant admission policies.<lb/> 45.<lb/> Both of these directives should have been transposed into national law in 2007; however, more<lb/> than half of the members failed to do so, prompting the Commission to issue infringements proceedings. In<lb/> the subsequent reports on the application of the directives, both of which were published in 2011, the<lb/> Commission voiced its dissatisfaction with the performance of the directives (EC 2011e; 2011f). Among<lb/> other things, the Commission drew attention to the dismally low number of third country researchers that<lb/> had been admitted under the researchers directive.<lb/> 46.<lb/> In the spring of 2013, therefore, the Commission decided to table a proposal to amend both<lb/> directives and merge them into one directive, calling for improvements and additions regarding a number<lb/> of key components, such as admission procedures, rights, intra-EU mobility, number of binding rules and<lb/> overall coherence. Most of all, the Commission (2013b) intends to make the directives more compatible<lb/> with the Europe 2020 Strategy and the EU&apos;s Global Approach to Migration and Mobility (GAMM), 18<lb/> highlighting the ever-increasing importance of attracting talented third country students and researchers to<lb/> the EU. The directive proposal also sounds the alarm over the EU&apos;s alleged &apos;innovation emergency&apos; vis-à-<lb/>vis the US and Japan, its shrinking working age population and structural demographic and economic<lb/> challenges that risk to grow worse unless the EU manages to compete successfully for global talent:<lb/> &apos;Thousands of the best researchers and innovators have moved to countries where conditions are more<lb/> favourable&apos; (EC 2013b: 2).<lb/> 47.<lb/> The proposal is also much more explicit than the two original directives in its emphasis on the<lb/> labour migration aspect: &apos;One of the key elements of this proposal would be to better tap into the potential<lb/> of students and researchers upon finalizing their studies/research. They constitute a future pool of highly<lb/> skilled workers as they speak the language and are integrated in the host society.&apos; (EC 2013b: 8) The<lb/> amended directive thus intends to provide students with more possibilities to work while studying as well<lb/> as giving both students and researchers the right, upon completion of their studies/research, to stay for an<lb/> additional 12 months in order to seek work and to start a business. As in the case of the amended LTR<lb/> directive above, the proposal adds new categories of TCNs to be covered by the directive&apos;s admission<lb/> conditions. These are labour migrants admitted to work as au pairs and remunerated trainees, 19 thus again<lb/> evincing the directive&apos;s ELM focus. In addition to this the amended directive proposes to extend and<lb/> improve the intra-EU mobility and labour market access terms for family members of third country<lb/> researchers; and it facilitates mobility for students and researchers.<lb/></p>

			<head>The Blue Card and Single Permit Directives<lb/></head>

			<p>48.<lb/> The Blue Card Directive (Dir. 2009/50/EC), 20 which was adopted in May 2009 to attract highly<lb/> qualified labour migrants to the EU, is arguably the EU&apos;s most publicly well-known labour migration<lb/> directive to date, immediately acquiring a flagship status due to the fact that the Commission finally could<lb/> point to an instrument with a potential (at least ostensibly) to involve fairly large number of new labour<lb/> migrants. Indeed, when the European Parliament, in the autumn of 2008, overwhelmingly approved the<lb/> Commission&apos;s Blue Card proposal, the then EU Home Affairs Commissioner, Jacques Barrot, translated<lb/> the Parliament&apos;s approval as clearly indicating &apos;that Europeans are open to immigration flows and that we<lb/> are welcoming to nationals from outside Europe&apos; (quoted in <ref type="biblio">Goldirova 2008</ref>).<lb/> 49.<lb/> Building on the Amsterdam Treaty and the Hague Programme&apos;s provisions and tailored to amend<lb/> projected labour and skills shortages and to the Lisbon Strategy, the directive lays down the terms of entry,<lb/> residence and intra-EU mobility for highly qualified third country workers and their families. As with the<lb/> LTR and researchers directives it stipulates socio-economic rights in a number of areas as well as a set of<lb/> labour rights, in accordance with the goal of approximating the rights of TCNs with those of member state<lb/> nationals. The directive explicitly seeks to encourage circular migration between countries of origin and<lb/> the EU, but it also provides a path to long-term resident status in the EU, in keeping with the rules of the<lb/> LTR directive.<lb/></p>

			<head>18<lb/></head>

			<p>As part of GAMM, the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP) and the bilateral Mobility Partnerships<lb/> signed with a growing number of non-EU countries are specifically mentioned as means by which the EU<lb/> could increase its intake of researchers and students.<lb/> 50.<lb/> While the directive is promoted for its rights provisions and commitment to making the EU most<lb/> attractive destination for highly qualified migrants, it also contains numerous complicated requirements<lb/> and restrictions as well as many discretionary and derogative powers for the member states, the latter, of<lb/> course, a sine qua non for making the adoption of the directive possible in the first place. Due to this, as<lb/> many scholars have pointed out, the directive&apos;s facilitating impact on the harmonization of the different<lb/> member states&apos; admission systems, which made up one of the Commission&apos;s main rationales for the Blue<lb/> Card in its original directive proposal (EC 2007b: 3), can only be meagre at best. 21 As Eisele (2013: 2) puts<lb/> it, by failing to phase out the 28 different national systems for qualified third country workers, as originally<lb/> intended, the Blue Card directive can best be likened to &apos;an upgraded national residence and work permit&apos;.<lb/> 51.<lb/> Many limitations also apply to intra-EU mobility, another of Brussels&apos; key motivations for<lb/> launching the Blue Card proposal. 22 As Article 18 has it, before a Blue Card holder and his/her family<lb/> &apos;may move to&apos; another member state, the card holder must have resided at least 18 months in the first<lb/> member state. Yet as the &apos;may&apos; clause indicates (and the directive contains many of these), even then their<lb/> intra-EU mobility is not guaranteed, since the directive specifies that &apos;Member states may continue to<lb/> apply volumes of admission as referred to in Article 6&apos;. As Article 6 establishes, restating the treaty&apos;s<lb/> Article 79, this directive &apos;shall not affect the right of a Member State to determine the volume of admission<lb/> of third-country nationals entering its territory for the purposes of highly qualified employment.&apos; This is of<lb/> course the most crucial impediment to making due on the Commission&apos;s main objective of stimulating a<lb/> large increase in ELM; at the same time this was made clear by the Commission already when it presented<lb/> its proposal in 2007, the press release stating that the directive &apos;does not create a right of admission; and is<lb/> demand-driven, i.e. based on a work contract. Member States will therefore maintain control on which<lb/> type—and on how many—highly qualified workers will enter their labour markets&apos; (EC 2007a: 2; see also<lb/> EC 2007b: 7). In effect, this means that member states retain the option of not issuing any Blue Cards at<lb/> all, thus defeating the purpose of the directive. In a nutshell, this illustrates just how contentious the issue<lb/> of EU harmonization of ELM is in the EU, with member states showing little interest in ceding control,<lb/> particularly when it comes to the key matters of admission, access to labour markets and volumes of labour<lb/> migrants.<lb/> 52.<lb/> In its &apos;5th Annual Report on Immigration and Asylum (2013)&apos;, published in May 2014, the<lb/> Commission (2014b: 13) takes note of the low number of Blue Cards being issued so far: 3644 in total for<lb/> 2012, of which Germany stood for 2584. As a tentative explanation, the Commission, in its implementation<lb/> report from May 2104, points to the already operating and competing national systems for high-skilled<lb/> migration, defective transposition of the directive, &apos;the low level of coherence, the limited set of rights and<lb/> barriers to intra-EU mobility&apos; as well as to poor information (EC 2014c: 10).<lb/></p>

			<figure>53.<lb/> In this context mention should also be made of the Single Permit Directive, or the Framework<lb/> directive (Dir. 2011/98/EU), 23 which was launched alongside the Blue Card directive proposal in 2007 (EC<lb/> 2007d). Of the directives dealt with here, this was the first to be adopted under the Lisbon Treaty and thus<lb/> 21<lb/> For more on the limited scope and impact of the Blue Card, see e.g. the contributions in Grütters and Strik<lb/> (eds, 2013); Cerna (2014); Gümüs (2010); Peers (2009).<lb/> 22<lb/> As stated by the Commission (2007: 6) in the directive proposal: &apos;Intra-EU mobility would be a strong<lb/> incentive for third-country highly qualified workers to enter the EU labour market, and could play a<lb/> primary role in relieving the labour shortages in certain areas/sectors.&apos;<lb/> 23<lb/> Directive 2011/98/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 December 2011 on a single<lb/> application procedure for a single permit for third-country nationals to reside and work in the territory of a<lb/> Member State and on a common set of rights for third-country workers legally residing in a Member State.<lb/> The UK, Ireland and Denmark do not take part in this directive.<lb/></figure>

			<p>in accordance with the Community method and its full parliamentary co-decision powers. 24 Since the<lb/> proposal was met with much objection from member states in the Council and also subject to ample<lb/> disagreement within the Parliament—which at first (in 2010), and in part due to the directive&apos;s sectoral<lb/> approach, voted to reject the proposal—and, subsequently, between the Council and the Parliament, a<lb/> significantly altered directive was only adopted in December 2011, after more than four years of protracted<lb/> negotiations.<lb/> 54.<lb/> With reference to the Lisbon Treaty&apos;s Article 79(2) and the objectives of the Tampere European<lb/> Council and the Stockholm Programme, the directive lays down &apos;a single application procedure for issuing<lb/> a single permit for third-country nationals to reside for the purpose of work in the territory of a member<lb/> state&apos;; and it establishes &apos;a common set of rights of third-country workers legally residing in a Member<lb/> State, irrespective of the purposes for which they were initially admitted&apos; (Art. 1). Explicitly steering clear<lb/> of any bearing upon &apos;the admission, including the volumes of admission, of third country nationals for the<lb/> purposes of work&apos;, the directive&apos;s first subject matter relates exclusively to provisions whereby TCNs (or<lb/> their employers) enter into a single application procedure that, in turn, should a member state grant<lb/> admission, results in a &apos;combined title&apos; covering both residence and work permits &apos;within a single<lb/> administrative act&apos;.<lb/> 55.<lb/> The aim is thus to contribute to procedural simplification, greater efficiency and harmonization of<lb/> national rules, something that is said to facilitate control of migration and the legality of migrants&apos; stay in<lb/> the EU. As to the second subject matter, regarding rights, this reiterates Tampere&apos;s, but also the Stockholm<lb/> Programme&apos;s, pledge to ensure fair treatment of TCNs and rights that are comparable with member state<lb/> nationals. In the preamble the objective of &apos;narrowing&apos; the so-called &apos;rights gap between citizens of the<lb/> Union and third-country nationals legally working in a Member State&apos; is elaborated in some detail. The<lb/> directive establishes that third country workers who have been granted single permits will enjoy a set of<lb/> equal treatment rights comparable to those of EU citizens (Art. 12; e.g. working conditions, freedom of<lb/> association, branches of social security and tax benefits), yet not on a par with those afforded under the<lb/> Blue Card and LTR directives. In essence, and as stated in the preamble, the rights under the single permit<lb/> directive are specifically, although not exclusively, intended for third country workers &apos;who are not yet<lb/> long-term residents&apos; (recital 19) and thus not eligible for the LTR directive&apos;s provisions. As also stated in<lb/> the preamble, and provided &apos;the absence of horizontal legislation&apos;, this is done in order &apos;to developing<lb/> further a coherent immigration policy and narrowing the rights gap&apos; between TCNs and EU citizens.<lb/> 56.<lb/> These ambitions notwithstanding, the single permit directive may be the most conspicuous<lb/> illustration so far of the disjointing effects stemming from &apos;the absence of horizontal legislation&apos;. To begin<lb/> with, the directive lists no less than 12 categories of TCNs to whom the directive &apos;shall not apply&apos; (Article<lb/> 3); some of these, but far from all, are covered by more favourable terms in previous directives. As<lb/> numerous scholarly accounts point out, moreover, member states managed to not only reduce the scope<lb/> and binding force of the directive; they also procured ample room to manoeuvre within what was left in the<lb/> directive, including significant latitude for interpretation, national law involvement and restrictions of<lb/> rights for TCNs (<ref type="biblio">Brinkmann 2012; Groenendijk 2013; Peers 2012a</ref>). As Brinkmann&apos;s (2012: 365–6)<lb/> detailed study concludes, then, the directive can have &apos;only a limited harmonising effect&apos; (see also<lb/> <ref type="biblio">Pascouau &amp; McLoughlin 2012</ref>). The transposition date for the single permit directive was set for 25<lb/> December 2013. Yet, as the Commission noted in its Annual Report (2014b: 14), by the end of 2013 only 8<lb/> members had complied, prompting the Commission to open infringements proceedings.<lb/> 24<lb/> Initially, the directive had its legal basis in the old Article 63, when the Community method did not apply,<lb/> but since it had not been adopted when the Lisbon Treaty (and the full scope of the Community method)<lb/> entered into force in December 2009, its legal basis was changed to Article 79.<lb/></figure>

			<head>The Seasonal Workers Directive<lb/></head>

			<p>57.<lb/> After nearly four years of negotiations, the Seasonal Workers Directive (Dir. 2014/36/EU) 25 was<lb/> adopted in February 2014. It specifies the terms of entry, stay and rights of TCNs who apply to be<lb/> employed as seasonal labour in the EU for a maximum stay of between five to nine months within a 12-<lb/>month period. Although the directive leaves decisions about volumes of seasonal labour to be admitted<lb/> exclusively in the hands of member states, this, together with the Blue Card, is the only directive to date<lb/> that at least nominally aligns with the Commission&apos;s goal of significantly increasing the admission of third<lb/> country labour migrants to the EU. Industries employing seasonal migrant labour (tourism, agriculture and<lb/> horticulture are mentioned in the directive but member states are entitled to define additional ones) are by<lb/> nature labour intensive, since cost can be kept at a minimum, and they have an obvious growth potential<lb/> given the pull of high unemployment of unskilled labour in countries close to the EU.<lb/> 58.<lb/> As a partial solution to the problem of high unemployment in North African countries and<lb/> elsewhere, the Commission has, within the framework of GAMM (as discussed above), made repeated<lb/> calls for a better migration management in the Mediterranean and for more legal migration channels to the<lb/> EU. The directive fits with this objective by being the first one to be promoted in terms of circular<lb/> migration and by being specifically designed to support development and prevent &apos;illegal immigration&apos; and<lb/> employers&apos; exploitation of TCNs through a set of &apos;fair and transparent rules for admission and stay&apos;. In<lb/> turn, these are intended to work legalizing on work in industries heavily staffed by undocumented<lb/> migrants. As part of this, the directive puts much emphasis on &apos;safeguards to prevent overstaying or<lb/> temporary stay from becoming permanent&apos; (see also the Commission&apos;s directive proposal, EC 2010b); and,<lb/> as such, it is also adapted to the previously adopted Employers Sanctions Directive. 26 As the European<lb/> Parliament&apos;s (2014) press release highlighted upon the passing of the directive, the rules established &apos;aim<lb/> both to end exploitation and to prevent temporary stays becoming permanent&apos;.<lb/> 59.<lb/> Aside from the treaty competence under Article 79(2), the directive, as outlined in the extensive<lb/> preamble, is based on a number of EU migration policy aims and commitments, including the Hague<lb/> Programme&apos;s call for measures to meet &apos;fluctuating demands for migrant labour&apos;; the European Council&apos;s<lb/> (of December 2006) request to examine measures to stimulate temporary migration; the European Pact on<lb/> Immigration&apos;s goal (agreed in 2008) of &apos;proper management of migration flows&apos; in cooperation with third<lb/> countries; and, not the least, the Stockholm Programme&apos;s recognition of the importance of ELM in<lb/> responding to demographic challenges and labour shortages and hence ELM&apos;s &apos;important contribution to<lb/> the Union&apos;s economic development and performance in the long term&apos;.<lb/> 60.<lb/> While taking note of &apos;fair treatment&apos; of TCNs and while granting a set of minimum basic rights<lb/> to seasonal workers (encompassing e.g. equal treatment in the areas of working conditions, terms of<lb/> employment, working hours, pay and dismissal, minimum working age, health and safety requirements,<lb/> freedom of association and the right to strike), the directive&apos;s rights provisions also differ significantly<lb/> from most of the other EU directives relating to ELM. For instance, and due to member states&apos; preferences,<lb/> the directive does not provide for intra-EU mobility, something that facilitated the adoption process<lb/> (<ref type="biblio">Lazarowicz 2014</ref>: 1). In addition, it does not grant family reunification and it limits equal treatment in a<lb/> number of areas, restraints that NGOs lobbied against during the negotiation period (see e.g. Joint NGO<lb/> 25<lb/> Directive 2014/36/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 February 2014 on the<lb/> conditions of entry and stay of third-country nationals for the purpose of employment as seasonal workers.<lb/> The UK, Ireland and Denmark do not take part in this directive.<lb/></figure>

			<p>Statement 2011). This is obviously due to the temporary nature of seasonal work (see EC 2013c) but<lb/> nevertheless underscores the stratifying effects of the sectoral approach to ELM.<lb/> 61.<lb/> For the same reason, and also in contrast to other ELM directives, there is no mention of migrant<lb/> &apos;integration&apos; in this directive. The absence of an integration endorsement can also be construed as<lb/> contingent on the fact that the migrant labour addressed in this directive will enter highly segregated labour<lb/> markets that, as the Commission has underscored time and again, face a permanent and growing &apos;structural<lb/> need for low-skilled and low-qualified workers&apos; that cannot be satisfied by &apos;EU national workers, primarily<lb/> owing to the fact that these workers consider seasonal work unattractive&apos; (EC 2010b: 2–3). If this explains<lb/> the non-appearance of references to migrant integration in the directive, their absence as well as the<lb/> Commission&apos;s sanction of segregated labour markets nonetheless contradict sharply with the<lb/> Commission&apos;s overall emphasis on the crucial importance of migrants&apos; successful integration into EU host<lb/> societies. As the Commission (2005a: 4) has stated on numerous occasions: &apos;Admission of economic<lb/> immigrants is inseparable from measures on integration&apos;.<lb/> 62.<lb/> As with the other directives discussed here, finally, due mainly to Council resistance this<lb/> directive also fails to meet the harmonization goals set up initially. Many of the administrative components<lb/> related to admission, for instance, are to be kept within the purview of the member states, and the directive<lb/> allows for a number of different admission terms, partly to avoid conflict with the Schengen acquis. In<lb/> addition, and yet again in conformity with the other directives, the directive excludes a number of<lb/> categories of third country nationals and it leaves much discretion to member states (see further <ref type="biblio">Delaney<lb/> 2013; Jonjić &amp; Mavrodi 2012; Monar 2013</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<head>The ICT Directive<lb/></head>

			<p>63.<lb/> After some very difficult negotiations, lasting for four years, the Parliament and Council finally<lb/> adopted the intra-corporate transferees directive (Dir. 2014/66/EU), laying down the terms of entry,<lb/> residence and rights of third country managers, specialists and trainee employees who apply to be admitted<lb/> as part of an intra-corporate transfer. 27 By facilitating the entry and stay of ICTs (defined as temporary<lb/> workers), 28 the EU is to benefit from the added competence, skills, knowledge and innovation capacity that<lb/> these migrants bring. In turn, this is to spur investment and benefit the knowledge-based economy. Besides<lb/> treaty provisions authorizing a common migration policy, the ICT directive thus draws on the Europe 2020<lb/> strategy and its aims to have innovation and knowledge contribute more to economic growth. Once<lb/> transposed (November 2016), the Commission expects the directive to apply to some 15–20 000 new ICTs<lb/> annually.<lb/> 64.<lb/> The most contentious aspects of the proposal revolved around rights for the ICTs, in general, and<lb/> intra-EU mobility rights, in particular. The Council insisted that ICTs should be placed on a par with<lb/> posted workers, whereas the Parliament argued for equal treatment along similar lines as member state<lb/> nationals (Monar 2013; Kostakopoulou, Acosta Arcarazo and Munk 2014: 144; Peers 2012b). However, as<lb/> Peers (2012b: 105) has it, the Council and Parliament positions were &apos;not radically far apart&apos; and in the end<lb/> a compromise was finally struck. Here, and in accordance with the Council&apos;s position, it was agreed that<lb/> &apos;Intra-corporate transferees should benefit from at least the same terms and conditions of employment as<lb/> posted workers whose employer is established on the territory of the Union&apos; (<ref type="biblio">Article 15</ref>). At the same time,<lb/> the Parliament managed to incorporate the right to equal treatment into many of areas (<ref type="biblio">Brieskova 2014</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<figure>27<lb/> Directive 2014/66/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 May 2014 on the conditions of<lb/> entry and residence of third-country nationals in the framework of an intra-corporate transfer. The UK,<lb/> Ireland and Denmark do not take part in this directive.<lb/> 28<lb/> The maximum duration of stay is limited to three years for managers and experts and one year for trainee<lb/> employees.<lb/></figure>

			<p>65.<lb/> During the negotiations the European Trade Union Confederation (ETUC) argued that the rights<lb/> framework for ICTs should be modelled on the Seasonal Workers Directive, not on posted workers; this to<lb/> safeguard workers&apos; protection and to prevent further fragmentation of the EU&apos;s labour market. As a result<lb/> of the Council carrying the day on this issue, the directive&apos;s list of rights turned out to be quite short,<lb/> including no more than three items. On the other hand, and in contrast to seasonal workers, ICTs were<lb/> granted family reunification, although not to the same extent as the Parliament had wanted and as applies<lb/> to third country workers in other directives. Also in contrast to seasonal workers, ICTs and their families<lb/> were given intra-EU mobility rights. However, this came with many strings attached as the Council<lb/> prevailed over the Parliament&apos;s request for less member state discretion in this area. Together with<lb/> numerous other derogations, highly complex rules and much leeway for the member states, this diminishes<lb/> the directive&apos;s harmonisation effect.<lb/></p>

			<head>CONCLUSION<lb/> 66.<lb/></head>

			<p>Judged by the European Commission&apos;s yardstick of what needs to be done in order to enable a<lb/> large-scale increase of ELM, the EU policies and legislation enacted over the past 15 years are nothing<lb/> short of disappointing; and the first to acknowledge this is the Commission itself. As the then Home<lb/> Affairs Commissioner put it in an interview in 2013, when referring to the necessity of stimulating labour<lb/> migration: &apos;But it is politically impossible to attain in today&apos;s Europe&apos; (quoted in Larsson 2013).<lb/> Malmström is here foremost referring to the Commission&apos;s most favoured approach, namely the horizontal<lb/> one of broad, supranational and thus harmonized rules, with as little differentiation as possible. But as<lb/> shown in this paper, with the horizontal approach effectively discarded already in 2001, the Commission<lb/> has instead spent the last decade pursuing a piecemeal sectoral approach that it never trusted in the first<lb/> place. And given the great amount of discretion that the member states have managed to secure in each and<lb/> every directive adopted so far, such lack of confidence is only natural; it is borne out of the experience of<lb/> seeing each sectoral directive not even fulfilling its primary objective of generating a fair amount of<lb/> harmonization in the targeted sector. As seen too, the sectoral approach has also compromised many of the<lb/> Commission&apos;s original objectives, not least concerning transparency, rights and equal treatment of TCNs.<lb/> 67.<lb/> However, measured by another, less technocratic and more realistic, standard, the development<lb/> accounted for here may well appear as both less disappointing and less irrational. Less disappointing<lb/> because, given the political and economic realities on the ground, the likelihood of erecting an ELM<lb/> regime even modestly resembling the one advocated by the Commission has always been slim at best.<lb/> Moreover, what was very difficult to achieve with 15 members has not become easier with 28 members, all<lb/> with highly diverse labour needs, unemployment levels, industrial structures, welfare regimes, positions in<lb/> the business cycle and political leanings. Even if the member states were all in agreement with Brussels&apos;<lb/> goal of a massively increasing ELM, which many of them are in principle, these factors would still<lb/> constitute a significant obstacle to getting agreement on supranational harmonization. In addition, several<lb/> member states have invested quite some efforts in getting their own ELM policies up and running (as<lb/> acknowledged by the Commission in its assessment of the Blue Card directive) and so have little<lb/> inclination to scrap these for EU policies that may be less sensitive to national interests. To illustrate a bit<lb/> further, recent Eurostat figures may be instructive. They show that EU member states &apos;issued around 2,36<lb/> million first residence permits to third country nationals in 2013&apos;, a 12 per cent increase as compared to<lb/> 2012. Of these residence permits, 23 per cent were specifically issued for employment purposes.<lb/> Somewhat contrary to what the &apos;demographic deficit&apos; debate often gives at hand, these figures show that<lb/> &apos;legal&apos; third country immigration to the EU is far from insignificant. Yet when this data are disaggregated<lb/> to the member state level it is also possible to discern a highly varied picture, both number-wise and<lb/> proportionally speaking, with, for instance, six member states accounting for about 80 per cent of the total<lb/> issuing of new residence permits to TCNs (<ref type="biblio">Eurostat 2014</ref>). This thus reflects country specific preferences<lb/> that, together with the current crisis, high unemployment and a range of other factors, speak to the fact that<lb/> as long as enough member states feel they have more to gain from staying in control of ELM, they will<lb/> only allow for so much common EU policy and legislation.<lb/> 68.<lb/> While this should be quite straightforward and while the Commission seems to concede the<lb/> reality of political obstacles, the bigger demographic-economic picture should still, according to the<lb/> Commission, trump political differences and have governments come to their senses and embrace ELM for<lb/> what it truly is: an economic survival strategy for the EU. This differs from how the Commission reasoned<lb/> 15 years ago, when ELM was considered as just one important component in a broader policy mix to offset<lb/> future demographic imbalances. Today, however, ELM is increasingly put forth as the primary remedy for<lb/> the projected demographic decline. And as with all technocratic solutions or rationales also this one tends<lb/> to relegate uncertainties, opposition and reservations to the realm of irrationality and false consciousness.<lb/> The problem is though, that short of a full-fledged technocracy things such as demographic projections will<lb/> not be able to dictate policy, but rather have to coexist and compete with a multitude of other interest-<lb/>mediated projections and policy options. What can be fairly certain though, is that a failure to orchestrate a<lb/> large-scale ELM to the EU over the next 10–50 years will not necessarily spell catastrophe. To argue as<lb/> such would be to underestimate socio-political inventiveness, technological advances and human agency;<lb/> and it would also be to grossly overestimate the predictive power of demographic data. A host of<lb/> unforeseen events and dislocations always tend to modify and sometimes upset the particular future course<lb/> that seemed most likely at the outset.<lb/> 69.<lb/> The current crises in the EU can be seen as such unforeseen dislocations that few predicted; and<lb/> it has also transformed migration policies and migration patterns (some of them quite dramatic) in ways<lb/> few could have imagined prior to the crisis. Although the EU&apos;s current refugee crisis falls outside the scope<lb/> of this paper, it is should be mentioned that it has had a significant demographic impact in some member<lb/> states, most notably in Germany and Sweden, where it has also impacted positively on economic growth.<lb/></p>

			<figure>In addition, it has of course also ignited policy discussions over how refugees could help resolve current<lb/> and future labour shortages in the light of a declining working age population (see e.g. Hansen 2016; IMF<lb/> 2016; OECD 2015; Statistics Sweden 2016).<lb/></figure>

			<p>70.<lb/> Conversely, as of 2012, eleven member states, all of them severely affected by the economic<lb/> crisis, suffered from net emigration (Eurostat 2013a; 2013b). According to the EU&apos;s most recent &apos;Ageing<lb/> Report&apos; from 2015, this number has now risen to thirteen, a striking development given that some of these<lb/> countries were solid immigration countries before the crisis and expected to remain as such for the decades<lb/> to come. Meanwhile, some member states that have weathered the crisis better have experienced a<lb/> significant increase in labour immigration (e.g. Germany), much of it originating from other EU<lb/> countries. 29<lb/> 71.<lb/> Since emigration may provide short-term fiscal relief—as the population eligible for social and<lb/> unemployment benefits decreases—some governments obviously cannot afford the luxury of worrying too<lb/> much about it. But from the Commission&apos;s perspective this should be a very worrisome development,<lb/> spelling a worsening demographic decline in many member states while also accelerating demographic and<lb/> labour imbalances in the Union as a whole, imbalances that may be very hard to reverse given that they<lb/> mirror and are caused by the overall macroeconomic imbalances in the EU. The tendency, discerned in<lb/> some member states, where many young unemployed, and often skilled, also emigrate to non-EU countries<lb/> as a result of the crisis should be a cause of concern too. As with third country nationals leaving the EU<lb/> due to the crisis, it deprives the Union of both skilled labour and working age people and thus belies the<lb/> central objectives of the Commission&apos;s labour migration policy.<lb/></p>

			<head>72.<lb/></head>

			<p>In the wake of the crisis, several EU governments&apos; anti-immigration measures and rhetoric also<lb/> run counter to the Commission&apos;s line of policy. Such measures include steps to either stop completely or<lb/> curtail regular labour migration, further tightening of family migration, as well as social benefits and<lb/> access to residence permits and some governments have sought to make unemployed migrants on<lb/> temporary permits leave their countries.<lb/> 73.<lb/> This is yet another great obstacle to the Commission&apos;s ELM objectives, one that may explain<lb/> why member states do not put priority of increasing and harmonizing ELM at this point in time. Yet, the<lb/> crisis has not modified the Commission&apos;s stance. If anything it has rather served to reinforce the<lb/> technocratic rationale further, or as argued by the Commission in its &apos;3rd Annual Report on Immigration<lb/> and Asylum&apos;:<lb/></p>

			<p>At first sight, the EU&apos;s current economic challenges might make it difficult to understand the<lb/> necessity for legal migration and mobility channels. But it is necessary to bear in mind that, even with<lb/> the overall EU unemployment rate of around 10%, equating to 23.8 million citizens, and increasing to<lb/> 22.1% for youths (under 25), many Member States are already experiencing labour and skills<lb/> shortages in different sectors and for varying reasons. <ref type="biblio">[…]</ref> Economic migration thus remains an<lb/> important component part of efforts to address the challenges of labour shortages, notably in the<lb/> context of the EU&apos;s ageing population and an increasingly competitive international market for talent,<lb/> with other countries outside Europe also experiencing skills shortages. (EC 2012b: 4; see also<lb/> Malmström 2012)<lb/> 74.<lb/> When the Commission states that it &apos;might make it difficult to understand the necessity for legal<lb/> migration&apos; this illustrates quite well the conflict between a technocratic approach, drawing on seemingly<lb/> irrefutable facts about future problems and the necessary measures needed to resolve them, on the one side,<lb/> and a political approach, drawing on expedient political calculations, public opinion and constraints<lb/> imposed by the current political, economic and ideological leanings and realities on the ground.<lb/> 75.<lb/> It is no wild guess to assume that this conflict will continue to pervade EU policy on ELM.<lb/> Judging from the European Council meeting in June 2014 and its &apos;strategic guidelines for legislative and<lb/> operational planning for the coming years within the area of freedom, security and justice&apos; there are no<lb/> signs that the member states are ready to reconsider and allow for more EU influence over ELM (European<lb/> Council 2014). As for the Commission, however, its recent announcements may indicate a change of<lb/> course. Instead of new legislative initiatives the Commission has clarified that the focus from now on<lb/> should be on ensuring implementation and consolidation of existing legislation and frameworks (EC<lb/> 2014e). Many of the directives relating to ELM have just recently been transposed and some are still<lb/> pending transposition. In this sense their real impact have not been tested yet. Instead of asking for the<lb/> moon, then, the Commission&apos;s latest strategy may therefore be to focus its energies on making the most of<lb/> what it has already managed to achieve.</p>
