			<table>Education Indicators In Focus – 2012/03 (March) © OECD 2012<lb/> EDUCATION<lb/> INDICATORS<lb/> FOCUS<lb/> How are girls doing in school – and women doing<lb/> in employment – around the world?<lb/> Throughout the world, girls are outperforming boys in reading…<lb/></table>

			<head>… and women are in the majority among entrants to higher education.<lb/></head>

			<p>As the world marks the achievements of women this month, the progress of girls and young women in<lb/> education – and of women in employment – can&apos;t be denied. In recent years, the achievement gap between<lb/> boys and girls in school has narrowed in key subjects – so much that in some areas, the focus of concern is<lb/> now on the underachievement of boys. For example, on the 2009 PISA reading assessment, 15-year-old girls<lb/> outperformed boys in every OECD country, and on average by 39 points – the equivalent of one year of school.<lb/> On the 2009 PISA mathematics assessment, 15-year-old boys tend to perform slightly better than girls in most<lb/> countries, while in science, patterns of performance related to gender are less pronounced.<lb/></p>

			<figure>On the 2009 PISA reading assessment, girls outperformed boys in every country, and on average<lb/> by 39 score points – the equivalent of one year of schooling. By contrast, boys tend to outperform<lb/> girls in mathematics.<lb/> An estimated 66% of young women in OECD countries are expected to enter a university<lb/> programme during their lifetime, compared to 52% of young men.<lb/> Men are more likely than women to hold advanced research qualifications, and 74% of all graduates<lb/> in the fields of engineering, manufacturing and construction are men.<lb/> Higher (tertiary) education improves job prospects for both men and women, and the gender<lb/> gap in employment narrows at the highest levels of educational attainment.<lb/></figure>

			<p>The better girls and boys do in school, the more likely they are to continue in education. Between 2000 and<lb/> 2009, the likelihood that both young men and women will enter a university (tertiary-type A) programme<lb/> increased dramatically, from 47% to 59%. However, when these results are broken down by gender, it&apos;s<lb/> clear that women are driving these increases.</p>

			<figure>For instance, the proportion of women who are expected<lb/> to enter a university programme rose from 51% in 2000 to 66% in 2009, while the proportion of men<lb/> who are expected to enter these programmes rose from 42% in 2000 to 52% in 2009.<lb/> Across OECD countries, the proportion of women who hold a university-level qualification now<lb/> equals or exceeds that of men in 29 of the 32 countries for which data are comparable. On average,<lb/> 59% of all graduates who held a first university degree in 2009 are women; this proportion is<lb/> below 50% only in China, Japan, Korea and Turkey.<lb/> education data education evidence education policy education analysis education statistics<lb/> © OECD 2012 Education Indicators In Focus – 2012/03 (March)<lb/></figure>

			<p>At the same time, women remain under-represented at the very highest levels of education. In 2009, 54% of<lb/> advanced research qualifications such as doctorates were awarded to men, on average across OECD countries.<lb/> This pattern is visible in all countries except Brazil, Finland, Iceland, New Zealand, Poland, Portugal and the United<lb/> States, where women now earn the majority of advanced qualifications. In Japan and Korea, only about 30%<lb/> of advanced research qualifications are awarded to women.<lb/></p>

			<p>Moreover, some fields of study are still branded as &quot; masculine &quot; or &quot; feminine &quot; . In 2009, in every OECD country<lb/> except Japan and Turkey, more than 70% of higher education students in the field of education were women.<lb/> On average across OECD countries, 75% of the degrees awarded in the field of health and welfare also went<lb/> to women. By contrast, in most countries, fewer than 30% of all graduates in the fields of engineering,<lb/> manufacturing and construction were women.<lb/></p>

			<p>In a handful of countries, gender imbalances in some traditionally male-dominated fields of study<lb/> are beginning to shrink. For example, in the Czech Republic, Germany and the Slovak Republic, the<lb/> proportion of women graduating with science degrees grew by more than 10 percentage points between<lb/> 2000 and 2009. As a result, these countries are now closer to the OECD average of 40% – a figure that<lb/> has remained stable over the past decade. In 2000, the European Union announced a goal to increase<lb/> the number of university graduates in mathematics, science and technology by at least 15% by 2010, and to<lb/> reduce the gender imbalance in these subjects. So far, however, progress toward this goal has been marginal.<lb/> Overall, however, the strong progress of women in education is translating into positive outcomes in the labour<lb/> market. In 2009, an average of 79% of women with a higher education qualification were employed, compared<lb/> to 66% of women with an upper secondary qualification, and 46% of women without an upper secondary<lb/> qualification. Notably, women are still less likely than men to participate in the labour market – even when they<lb/> have the same qualifications – and are also more likely to work part-time.<lb/></p>

			<p>However, the gap in favour of men has shrunk in the decade since 2000, and is much less pronounced at<lb/> higher levels of education. For instance, the gender gap in employment narrowed from 25 percentage points<lb/> in 2000 to 21 percentage points in 2009 among those without an upper secondary qualification, and from<lb/> 19 percentage points in 2000 to 15 percentage points in 2009 among those with an upper secondary<lb/> qualification. And it&apos;s narrower still among those with a higher education qualification, decreasing from<lb/> 11 percentage points in 2000 to 9 percentage points in 2009.<lb/></p>

			<p>These figures can vary widely across countries: among people without an upper secondary qualification,<lb/> the gender gap in employment is less than 10 percentage points in Finland, Iceland and Norway,<lb/> but more than 40 percentage points in Chile, Mexico and Turkey. Among people with a higher education<lb/> qualification, the gender gap in employment tends to narrow significantly in all OECD countries except<lb/> Japan, Korea, Mexico and Turkey, where it exceeds 15 percentage points.<lb/></p>

			<head>… and so are recent initiatives that promote gender equality in employment.<lb/></head>

			<p>OECD countries are doing more to reduce gender gaps in employment, too. For example, in the Nordic countries,<lb/> Germany and Portugal, fathers can receive a parental leave entitlement and income support during the leave<lb/> period. In Iceland, Norway and Spain, some firms are required to have at least 40% of their boardroom seats<lb/> assigned to women, depending on the size of the company and the number of board members. Similar initiatives<lb/> have been introduced in Belgium, France, Italy and the Netherlands. Meanwhile, other companies, such as<lb/> Deutsche Telekom, have introduced voluntary quotas for women in management and family-friendly practices<lb/> such as flex-time and tele-working.<lb/></p>

			<p>All these initiatives are recent and still widely debated. They merit further analysis to understand their benefits<lb/> in terms of women&apos;s employment outcomes and company performance.<lb/></p>
