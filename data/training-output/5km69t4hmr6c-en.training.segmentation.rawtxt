work at the OECD on trade and innovation. The chemicals sector has a long history of innovation and is a 
large trading item. It covers very diverse sub-sectors. This paper analyses and compares different trade and 
innovation linkages in basic industrial chemicals, speciality and fine chemicals and consumer chemicals. This sector has also been a subject of successive rounds of multilateral trade negotiations, and partly 
as a consequence tariff rates have been reduced over time. Nonetheless remaining tariffs are still 
non-negligible and constitute impediments to trade. Export restrictive measures on raw material inputs are 
also being highlighted on the trade negotiating agenda. Moreover, the chemicals sector is heavily regulated 
for health and environmental reasons and further legislative initiatives have been pursued, whose practical 
impact on innovation remains to be seen. Intellectual property has played a very important role in 
technology diffusion in this sector, and infringement of intellectual property continues to be a major 
problem. ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This study has been prepared by Nobuo Kiriyama of the OECD Trade and Agriculture Directorate

occupies a large part of international trade and has continuously been the subject of multilateral trade 
negotiations. It is undergoing a major transformation with the rise of emerging economies and regulatory 
challenges. World trade in the chemicals sector more than trebled between 1995 and 2008, particularly just 
after 2001. While high income countries represent the majority of world trade, low and middle income 
countries are steadily gaining importance, and South-South trade has recorded higher growth rates than 
other income group pairs. Emerging economies, such as China, are now among the major traders in this 
sector. Three quarters of world trade in the chemicals sector is in intermediate goods, and consumer 
chemicals and pharmaceuticals make up the rest. Tariffs have been reduced substantially over the same 
period, but their elimination remains as a subject in the current multilateral negotiations. Different sub-segments of the industry, i.e. basic industrial chemicals, speciality and fine chemicals 
and consumer chemicals all have very diverse innovation characteristics. Basic industrial chemicals have 
limited opportunities to introduce new products and compete mainly on costs, whereas product innovation, 
responding to evolving customer needs transmitted through supply chains, is essential for speciality and 
fine chemicals. Process innovation is important for both of these sub-sectors to reduce costs, to improve 
sustainability (e.g. industrial biotechnology) or to pursue differentiation. For consumer chemicals 
introduction of new products and marketing approaches is the key. These different features of those sub-
segments offer diverse channels through which trade affects innovation in the chemicals sector. First, the 
transfer of advanced technologies, both as embodied in capital goods as well as through technology 
licensing, has been the key to the emergence of the chemicals industry as a global industry, and the 
specialised engineering firms (SEFs) have played a unique role, especially in basic industrial chemicals. 
Second, product innovation in speciality and fine chemicals contributes to innovation in downstream 
sectors, and trade serves as an essential conduit to transmit such innovations across borders. Thirdly, as a 
consequence of the wider availability of technologies across the globe, technology leaders in developed 
countries are under increasing competitive pressure from new competitors, which induces further 
innovation. Fourth, foreign contacts through exports can give suppliers innovative ideas. The increasing 
strength of emerging markets is a challenge but it also offers opportunities for innovation. Finally, joint 
ventures and cross border M&A also function as channels of technology transfer. The chemicals sector is heavily regulated both domestically and internationally, primarily for health, 
safety and environmental reasons. Under WTO rules, regulations may be considered legitimate if certain 
conditions are met. Many domestic regulations have been notified to the WTO according to the procedure 
provided in the TBT Agreement, and there have been over 1 600 notifications since 1995 in the chemicals 
sector. The impact of regulation on innovation can go either way; on one hand, regulation imposes extra 
cost and time burdens and diverts resources away from innovation, but on the other hand, environmental 
regulation can induce innovative activities and enhance energy efficiency. The actual impact of regulation 
on innovation is likely to be specific to the regulatory design and to the products and segments of the 
industry. The impact of recently introduced REACH legislation in the EU has been much discussed both in 
the legislative process within the EU and in international forums including the WTO. Beyond the EU, 
many major players in this sector have been pursuing regulatory initiatives to enhance data collection and TAD/TC/WP(2010)9/FINAL 6 to extend regulatory coverage to existing chemicals. Their practical impact remains to be seen, since they 
are still at an early stage of implementation or preparation. In relation to climate change issues, the 
chemicals sector is in a unique position as both a major sector in terms of energy use and CO2 emissions 
and as a major contributor to delivering solutions to combat climate change. Technological solutions to 
reduce reliance on fossil fuels by the chemicals sector are being sought, and chemical products are 
essential for greenhouse gas reduction in downstream industries. Further trade liberalisation can play an 
important role to accelerate the diffusion of products and technologies that contribute to climate change 
mitigation. Intellectual property has particular importance in the chemicals sector because of the relative ease of 
producing chemicals as soon as the necessary technologies are known. Throughout the history of the 
chemicals industry, both patents and trade secrets have been used extensively to protect intellectual 
property, the choice depending on the nature of the technology and company strategy. Patents have been 
instrumental in facilitating technology transfer by licensing. The practice of co-patenting is generally 
correlated with trade flows, indicating the possibility that collaborative efforts in innovation foster trade 
flows, or that trade flows and collaborative innovation are mutually reinforcing. Infringement of 
intellectual property continues to be a major problem resulting in large losses to the intellectual property 
holders. Many multinational companies operating in China have taken various measures to protect their 
intellectual property, over and above efforts to strengthen intellectual property rights enforcement by the 
Chinese government. In addition, counterfeiting of chemical products (e.g. fertilisers and pesticides), 
which is often difficult to detect, can have serious consequences for the environment, health and safety. During the recent financial crisis, the chemicals industry has been no exception in experiencing a 
decline in trade. Although it is considered that the initial fear of possible serious protectionist reactions has 
not materialised, chemicals and plastics are among the most affected industries by recently introduced 
trade-related measures. The recent developments underline the importance of the monitoring activities to 
ensure transparency and to seek an ambitious and balanced conclusion of the Doha Development Round. TAD/TC/WP(2010)9/FINAL 7 I. 
Introduction 1. Background and the purpose of the study 1. 
The Trade Committee's work on Trade and Innovation in 2007-2008 (OECD, 2008a) highlighted 
various linkages between trade and innovation, drawing on case studies of various sectors in countries at 
different levels of development. Building on this, a first sectoral study has been undertaken focusing on the 
information and communication technology (ICT) sector. 1 This second sectoral study focuses on the 
chemicals sector. 2. 
There are several reasons for the choice of this sector. First, the chemicals sector (HS Chapters 
28-39) occupies over 11% of the world trade, and it has been a specific subject of multilateral trade 
negotiations. Second, it has a long tradition of innovation as  " the first science-based industry " , and 
development and diffusion of technology has played an essential role in shaping the industry. Moreover, 
emerging economies and major regulatory issues relating particularly to health, safety and environment are 
changing the industry. Thus, there are unique issues to explore in the chemicals sector in relation to trade 
and innovation. 3. 
This paper is in five sections. The remainder of this section briefly introduces the concept of 
innovation and its contribution to trade, and discusses the scope of the chemicals sector covered in this 
paper. Section II reviews the evolution of trade and tariff profiles of the sector over the past ten years. 
Section III examines trade and innovation linkages focusing on three chemicals sub-sectors. Section IV 
discusses trade-related policy measures in the chemicals sector, and Section V concludes. 2. Trade and innovation: an overview i) Innovation 4. 
OECD (2005, p.46) ( " the Oslo Manual " ) 2 defines an innovation as the implementation of a new 
or significantly improved product (good or services), or process, a new marketing method, or a new 
organisational method in business practices, workplace organisation or external relations (. It is a 
continuous process that involves multiple aspects of firm activities. 5. 
Four types of innovations are distinguished: product innovations, process innovations, marketing 
innovations and organisational innovations. A product innovation is the introduction of a good or service 
that is new or significantly improved with respect to its characteristics or intended uses. A process 
innovation is the implementation of a new or significantly improved production or delivery method. A 
marketing innovation is the implementation of a new marketing method involving significant changes in 
product design or packaging, product placement, product promotion or pricing. An organisational 
innovation is the implementation of a new organisational method in the firm's business practices, 
workplace organisation or external relations. (Oslo Manual, pp.47-51) All innovations must contain a 
degree of novelty, which can be new to the firm, new to the market or new to the world (ibid, p.57). *This study is prepared with a contribution from Paul Wright, external consultant to this study. 1 .

TAD/TC/WP(2009)11/PART1/ANN and TAD/TC/WP(2009)11/PART2] 2 The Oslo manual presents guidelines for collecting data on the general process of innovation, the 
implementation of innovations, the factors that influence innovation activities, and the outcomes of 
innovation. (Oslo Manual, p.15) TAD/TC/WP(2010)9/FINAL 8 ii) Contribution of trade to innovation 6. 
Just as the concept of an innovation is multifaceted, the contribution of trade to innovation 
involves various channels. 3 As highlighted in OECD (2008a), technologies can move across borders 
through trade and investment as well as through licensing. Imports of capital goods are an important 
conduit for technology transfer as foreign-produced machinery often contains more technology than 
domestic machinery, especially in developing countries. Foreign direct investment also plays a key role in 
technology transfer and innovation. Multinational companies tend to innovate more than domestic 
companies, and there is also a growing recognition that internationalising production can be a way of 
gaining access to expertise and techniques that are complementary to a company's in-house assets. Second, 
imports and foreign direct investment both increase competition for domestic industries, which creates an 
incentive for firms to innovate in order to withstand competitive pressure. Empirical evidence suggests that, 
in high-technology industries, levels of innovation fall more rapidly when there is less competition. Third, 
globalisation of value chains, which itself is a type of innovation, may induce participating firms to 
improve efficiency in individual activities, to change their mix of activities, or to try to innovate by moving 
into another value chain (OECD (2008a), pp.14-42). 7. 
Openness to trade is, needless to say, not an instrument specifically designed to foster innovation, 
but it is one element of the framework conditions that affects broader aspects of the economy. As often 
emphasised, openness to trade (or more generally the right framework condition) on its own does not 
ensure innovation (or other desirable economic outcomes), 4 and given the increasingly central role of 
innovation in delivering a wide range of economic and social objectives, a  " whole-of-government "  
approach to policies for innovation is needed (OECD, 2010a). Nevertheless, as summarised above, 
openness to trade is an essential condition that facilitates, or enables, diffusion of technologies for a 
broader range of firms across the border to take up and innovate, and gives the right incentive for firms to 
innovate. This study examines how these channels work in the chemicals sector. 3. The scope of the chemicals sector and the nature of innovation 8. 
The chemicals sector comprises a series of diverse and inter-related sub-sectors covering a wide 
range of technologies and processes. The output of the industry is mostly used by other companies as 
inputs, but it also covers finished goods used by consumers. Chemical inputs are essential to many 
different industries, not only to the chemical industry itself, or to other manufacturing industries such as 
automotives, electronics and textiles, but also to agriculture and services. 5 In order to properly take into 
account the diversity of this sector, it is useful to introduce certain sub-groupings within the industry. For 
this purpose, this paper makes reference to  " basic industrial chemicals " ,  " speciality and fine chemicals " , 
 " consumer chemicals "  and  " pharmaceuticals "  as sub-sectors. 6 Basic industrial chemicals cover inorganic 
and organic chemicals as well as petrochemicals and fertilisers, which are typically produced on a large 
scale. Speciality and fine chemicals are medium to high value products and produced on a smaller scale. 3 See OECD (2008a), Tables 1 and 2. 4 Speeches by Pascal Lamy, Director General of the WTO,  " Facts and Fictions in International Trade 
Economics "  (12 April 2010, at the Paris School of Economics),  " Reconciling America with an open 
trading system "  (24 April 2009, in Washington, D.C.), 5 CEFIC (2009), p.8; ICCA (2005), p.4. In one estimate, 96% of manufactured goods have a direct nexus to 
the chemicals sector (Durbin, 2009). 6 HLG (2009) uses largely similar divisions: petrochemicals, basic inorganics and polymers; speciality 
chemicals; and consumer chemicals (pp.6-7). Thomson Reuters Business Classification divides Chemicals 
(under Basic Materials) into Commodity Chemicals, Agricultural Chemicals, Specialty Chemicals and 
Diversified Chemicals. See also Swift (1999), p.33; OECD (2001), p.10. TAD/TC/WP(2010)9/FINAL 9 They include paints and pigments, industrial gasses, sealants and adhesives and catalysts, but some organic 
chemicals and plastics can also belong to this category. Consumer chemicals are in general formulated 
products such as soap, detergents and cosmetics. Together (including pharmaceuticals) they nearly 
correspond to the coverage of the Chemicals Tariff Harmonization Agreement (CTHA) in the Uruguay 
Round. 9. 
It should be noted that the boundaries of the sub-sectors are fluid and not always clear-cut, and 
statistics are not necessarily suited to capturing these different segments (Swift (1999), p.33). Adding to 
this,  " chemicals "  in different studies may actually refer to a varying scope of products; in particular, 
pharmaceuticals are often, but not always, treated as a separate industry, and consumer chemicals are 
sometimes excluded, either explicitly or implicitly. 7 This paper does not specifically focus on 
pharmaceuticals in its analysis of trade and innovation linkage in Sections III and IV, since it is quite 
distinct in terms of both trade and innovation performances (see Section II and Section III.1) and may well 
merit a specific study in its own right. 8 II. 
Trade and tariffs in the chemicals sector 1. Evolution of trade 9 10. 
World trade in the chemicals sector (defined as HS Chapters 28 to 39 in this Section; 10 see 
Table 1 for descriptions) more than trebled between 1995 and 2008 (Figure 1). While high income 
countries (HICs) have the largest share in world trade, low and middle income countries (LMICs) have 
been steadily gaining market share during this period. Taking a closer look at the differences by sub-sector 
and by income group provides further insight. First, whereas the annual growth rates in chemicals 
(excluding pharmaceuticals) have been similar to those in total merchandise trade, the growth rates in 
pharmaceuticals (Chapter 30) have been quite different. 11 The growth in pharmaceuticals was notably 
higher in HICs, compared with other HS Chapters. In contrast, the growth in fertilisers (Chapter 31) was 
particularly higher in LMICs (Figure 2). Second, in terms of levels of trade, there is a high concentration 
on organic chemicals and plastics (HS Chapters 29 and 39; generally considered basic industrial 
chemicals), followed by pharmaceuticals, which together account for 70% of trade in chemicals (Figure 3). 
The composition of trade is different between the HICs and the LMICs, with trade in pharmaceuticals 
strongly concentrated in the former, with inorganic chemicals and fertilisers more concentrated in the latter 
group. 11. 
Trade in chemicals between LMICs (South-South trade) has been low but steadily increasing 
from 5% in 1995 to close to 10% in 2008; in turn, the share of trade between HICs, while still dominant, 
has gradually declined from over 70% to 60% during the same period (Figure 4). Trade between LMICs 
has recorded faster overall growth in the chemicals than other income group pairs during the period, with 
the notable exception of pharmaceuticals. Plastics and organic chemicals together account for 40-50% of 
increased growth after 2001 across different income group pairs, while pharmaceuticals was by far the 7 See e.g. Swift (1999), p.33 (explicitly excludes consumer products from the discussion); Thomson Reuters 
Business Classification (establishes Personal & Household Products separate from chemicals). 8 See e.g. OECD (2006). 9 See Appendix 1 for technical details of the data. 10 This coverage is in reference to the CTHA. However, it contains some headings covered by the Agreement 
on Agriculture thus not covered by the CTHA or current proposal on liberalisation of tariffs in chemicals 
sector in the Doha round. 11 WTO (2005a), pp.17-18 investigates into the possible reasons for sharp growth of trade in pharmaceutical 
sector, and it attributes to strong demand and industrial restructuring as a major factor. TAD/TC/WP(2010)9/FINAL 10 largest contributor to trade between HICs. Pharmaceuticals are also the largest trading item between HICs, 
while trade in fertilisers is mainly between LMICs. The largest trade item between the two income groups 
is plastics, followed by organic chemicals. 12. 
The largest traders are the EU (external trade as a group), Germany and the United States, 
followed by Belgium, France and China (Figure 5). Here again, significant acceleration of growth in the 
2000s can be seen across countries. The composition of exports varies considerably between countries; 
many OECD countries have high shares in pharmaceuticals (except Japan and Korea) alongside India, 
while many East Asian economies (Korea; Chinese Taipei and Hong Kong, China) are more specialised in 
plastics. 13. 
Classifying in terms of end use, intermediate goods (industry supplies and others) make up for 
three-quarters of trade (Figure 6). This concentration in intermediate goods is even higher for the LMICs. 
The most noticeable change between 2000 and 2007 was the increase in the share of pharmaceuticals, 
especially in the HICs. Despite a significant increase in the absolute value of trade in other types of 
chemicals, the shares of intermediate goods (except exports from the LMICs) and consumer chemicals 
(other than pharmaceuticals; e.g. perfume, cosmetics, soap and plastic articles) declined during this period. Table 1. HS chapters and descriptions 12 28. Inorganic chemicals; organic or inorganic compounds of precious metals, of rare-earth

Tariff rates have been coming down since the conclusion of the Uruguay Round (Figure 7(a)). 
The average MFN applied tariffs on chemicals by the original CTHA (Chemicals Tariff Harmonization 
Agreement) participants are about 2%, and non-participants have also reduced their rates from over 10% to 
single digits. This reduction is not necessarily due to the implementation of commitments under the WTO 
(Uruguay Round commitment or accession commitment) but includes unilateral tariff reduction, especially 
by non-CTHA participants. Therefore, despite a certain degree of convergence of tariff rates across 12 Although this structure does not precisely correspond to the sub-groupings used in this paper, CEFIC 
(2009), p.18, uses the following categorisation:  " basic inorganic "  (28, 31),  " petrochemicals (29), polymers 
(39, 54, 55),  " pharmaceuticals "  (30),  " specialty chemicals "  (32, 35, 38) and  " consumer chemicals "  (33, 34). TAD/TC/WP(2010)9/FINAL 11 countries, levels of WTO bound rates in non-participants are considerably higher than other groups (Figure 
7(b)). Tariff reduction has taken place across different HS Chapters, but tariff rates are generally lower for 
basic chemicals (Chapters 28-29) and higher for more highly processed chemical products (Chapters 33-36) 
(Figure 8). 13 This reflects the structure of CTHA, but it is also the case with non-participants. 15. 
An estimate of the amount of duties collected on imports shows that the largest amount is 
collected by non-CTHA participants, despite tariff reductions in recent years (Table 2). It also shows that 
the duty collection by original CTHA participants and new WTO members also remains substantial, due to 
large import value as well as to the remaining tariffs. It is worth noting, however, that whereas tariffs for 
CTHA participants are bound at levels close to applied tariffs, tariffs for non-CTHA participants are bound 
at much higher levels and can be raised by their policy decisions. 16. 
A breakdown into HS Chapters shows that plastics represent the largest share of duty collection, 
followed by organic chemicals. The share of pharmaceuticals is significantly higher in non-CTHA 
countries (Table 2). Table 2. Estimate of chemicals duty share (%) by HS chapter (2008) 14 By Group

25 13 Higher average tariff rates for Chapter 35 (in particular in CTHA group) reflect the existence of 
agricultural products in the Chapter, which are not covered by the CTHA. Remaining duties in Chapter 30 
reflect transposition in HS classifications. 14 The amount of duty is estimated as (weighted average effective applied tariffs for an HS Chapter in a 
country)x(corresponding import value). Where data are missing for 2008, data from closest available years 
are used. The amount of duties actually collected at the customs is not identical to this calculation because 
of application of rules of origin, special incentive schemes and other factors that are not reflected in duty 
rates in the database.  " Non-CTHA "  includes non-WTO members (Russia and Belarus).  " Other OECD "  
consists of Australia, Iceland, New Zealand and Turkey. TAD/TC/WP(2010)9/FINAL 12 Box 1. The Chemicals Sector and Multilateral Trade Negotiations The chemical sector has been featured during successive rounds of multilateral trade negotiations. During the 
Dillon Round (1960-61), European countries made their tariff reductions on organic chemicals conditional on the 
abolition of the American Selling Price system of valuation for customs purposes (ASP) by the United States, but no 
agreement was reached. In the Kennedy Round (1964-67), European countries made their offers on the entire 
chemicals sector (Chapters 28 to 39) conditional on the abolition of the ASP. Informal groups were established in five 
sectors, including chemicals, to deal with the sector specific problems (GATT, 1975a). The negotiations resulted in a 
formal plurilateral  " agreement "  on chemicals 
15 (WTO (2005b), para. 14). During the Tokyo Round (1973-79), the 
Negotiating Group  " Sectoral Approach "  was established and worked on various sectors including chemicals, 
16 but it 
produced no agreement on the sector on a plurilateral basis. The Uruguay Round (1986-94) produced several successful plurilateral sectoral negotiations, including the 
chemicals tariff harmonisation agreement (CTHA) and the tariff elimination ( " zero-for-zero "  agreement) in 
pharmaceuticals (WTO (2005b), para.27). Initially, contracting parties interested in particular sectors indicated those 
sectors in their tariff reduction proposals in 1990-91, which was followed by negotiations (Stewart et al. (1995), pp.414-
43). In July 1993, the United States, European Communities, Canada and Japan announced an agreement on 
necessary elements for a final agreement, which included a common list of sectors for tariff and non-tariff measure 
elimination (e.g. pharmaceuticals) and tariff harmonisation in chemical products (GATT, 1993). Under the CTHA it was 
agreed to harmonise and bind the tariff rates at 6.5% (HS Chapters 31-39 and 2916-2942), 5.5% (HS28 and 2903-14) 
and 0% (HS2901-2902 and HS30) with 5, 10 or 15 years of staging depending on the base tariff levels (WTO, 2006; 
WTO, 2005), except for products covered by the Agreement on Agriculture. This agreement initially had the following 
participants: Canada, Czech Republic, European Communities (12), Japan, Korea, Norway, Singapore, Slovak 
Republic, Switzerland and the United States (Hoda, 2002, p.30). Many more countries have since subscribed to the 
same or similar commitments in particular the recently acceded members to the WTO as a part of their accession 
commitments. On pharmaceuticals, it was agreed to eliminate tariffs on items in HS Chapter 30; items in HS headings 2936, 
2937, 2939, and 2941, with the exception of dihydrostreptomycin and salts, esters, and hydrates thereof; and other 
items including active ingredients which bear an international non-proprietary name (INN) from the World Health 
Organization, and certain additional products used for the production and manufacture of finished pharmaceuticals. 
The participants were Australia, Canada, Czech Republic, European Communities (12), Iceland, Japan, New Zealand, 
Norway, Singapore, Slovak Republic, Switzerland and the United States (GATT, 1994). There have been three rounds 
of reviews of the product coverage, which resulted in inclusion of additional products (WTO 1996, 1998, 2007). In the current Doha Development Agenda negotiations (2001-), proposals have been tabled for sectoral tariff 
elimination in the chemicals sector (Chapters 28-39) and for open access to enhanced healthcare (Chapter 30 as well 
as some items from other Chapters including Chapters 28, 29, 87 and 90) (WTO, 2008). 17 15 Agreement relating principally to Chemicals, Supplementary to the Geneva (1967) Protocol (GATT, 
L/2819, 17 July 1967). 16 For example, in the process of the work in the Group  " Sectoral Approach " , the United States proposed 
further studies on the chemicals, electronics, and heavy electrical equipment sectors (GATT, 1975b). 17 International Council of Chemical Associations (ICCA) has expressed its support for the initiative (ICCA, 
2001, 2005). TAD/TC/WP(2010)9/FINAL 13 III. 
Innovation in the chemicals sector and the role of trade 1. Innovation activities in the chemicals sector i) A short history of innovation in the chemicals sector 17. 
The chemical industry 18 has a long history of innovation. It started in the first half of the 
nineteenth century as mostly processing of inorganic chemical compounds taken from the earth into more 
useful products such as lime and soda ashes. The chemical industry was made  " the first science-based 
industry "  with the launch of organic chemistry in 1856 in Britain, in which inputs such as coal and oil are 
transformed into benzene, ethylene and so on. In particular the production of dyestuffs became the engine 
of growth until WWI, especially in Germany. The advent of polymer chemistry in Germany in the 1920s 
opened the door for the petrochemicals industry, developed initially in the United States, contributing to 
large scale production of a diverse range of polymer products such as synthetic fibres, plastics, adhesives 
and paints. A third stage of technological changes is taking place based on the advent of biosciences. 18. 
Basic production technologies were diffused geographically over the twentieth century, initially 
among the United States, Europe and Japan and subsequently in Asia and the Middle East. Competitive 
pressure has pushed the industry to restructure, especially in developed countries, moving away from a 
conglomerate structure with physically integrated assets and moving to the areas of core competence and 
product differentiation, often through divestment, mergers and acquisitions (M&As). Re-organisations of 
existing companies as well as the emergence of new entrants (SABIC, Sinopec) have made the top 10 
chemical companies list considerably different over the past 10 years (Table 3). 19 It is predicted that 
by 2015 there will be only four top-ten producers in developed countries (KPMG International (2010a), 
p.9). 19. 
The recent financial crisis has hit the sector in varying degrees depending on the fortunes of the 
downstream users, with the chemicals for automotive and construction industry being hit the hardest, and 
those for pharmaceuticals, food and personal care being hit the least. Nevertheless, the economic downturn 
has generally reinforced the need for further innovation in accordance with the key competitive advantage 
of the business segment. In doing so, wider range of collaboration across the boundary of the firms in 
various activities, including R&D, distribution and marketing, is being called for. In a larger context, the 
financial crisis is considered to accelerate the shift in the centre of gravity of the industry to the emerging 
economies, as companies with cost advantages and better financial positions in the aftermath of the 
financial crisis expand their businesses. 20 18 This and the following paragraphs draws on Landau and Arora (1999), Swift (1999) and Cesaroni et al.

12.9 Source: ICIS Chemical Business (2009) p.18, ICIS (2009). ii) Diversity of innovation in the chemicals sector 20. 
Various measures of innovation indicate that the chemical industry is among the most innovative 
industries. A study on innovation performance ranking of European industries put  " chemicals and chemical 
products "  in fourth place, after  " electrical and optical equipment " ,  " ICT "  and  " Computer services and 
related activities " , and just above  " motor vehicles, trailers and semi-trailers "  (Hollanders and Arundel 
(2005), p.14). It is similarly the case in the majority of the 15 European countries surveyed. The proportion 
of innovative firms is higher in chemicals than in manufacturing industry as a whole, both in terms of 
product and process innovation, and of organisational and marketing innovation. And this is consistently 
observed across different countries in this survey. 21 21. 
However, aggregated numbers for the  " chemicals sector "  mask the substantial diversity of its 
sub-sectors. The difference is particularly visible in R&D intensity for pharmaceuticals and the rest of the 
chemicals sector (Figure 9(a)), and as a result pharmaceuticals are often presented separately from the rest 
of the chemicals. 22 This gap has widened in many countries over the past 10 years, as the R&D intensity in 
pharmaceuticals went up while it dipped in the rest of the chemicals (Figure 9(b)). 22. 
Neither should the diversity among the rest of the chemicals sector be overlooked. Available data 
up to the 1990s show that R&D intensity tends to be higher in speciality and consumer chemicals than in 
basic industrial chemicals (Fleischer et al. (2000), p.85; Figure 10(a)). Moreover, R&D intensities in 
different sub-sectors have also been diverging over time. Deloitte (2009, p.9) reports that while the R&D 
intensity (R&D/revenues) for speciality chemicals remained in the range of 3.0-3.5% during 1998-2008, it 
has declined from over 2% to 0.5% for commodity chemicals during the same period. 23. 
The purpose of R&D spending is also very different in different sub-sectors. A study on 
European chemical firms in 1990s shows that only 30% of basic chemicals firms spend more than 75% on 
product innovation, while more than 60% of agrochemicals, paints and varnishes companies do so 21 See also Aschhoff et al. (2008), p.11 (innovation survey results in Germany) and Mercer (2004) (in UK). 22 See e.g. European Commission (2008), p.44. Given the different nature of pharmaceuticals, innovation in 
pharmaceuticals is not the primary focus of this study. Hollanders and Arundel (2005) also acknowledges 
that one factor behind the high ranking of  " chemicals and chemical products "  sector is presence of 
pharmaceuticals (p.30). However, data availability at disaggregate level often limits the possibility of 
separate analysis (see cf. Patel (2008), p.2). TAD/TC/WP(2010)9/FINAL 15 (Albach et al. (1996), p.44-47). On the other hand, a larger share of companies in basic chemicals spends 
heavily on process innovation than those in other sub-sectors (Figure 10(b)). 24. 
The contribution of new products to sales further illustrates such diversity. A survey of American 
chemical companies shows that, whereas new products contribute to 10% of the sales of basic chemicals, 
they contribute to 23% for speciality and fine chemicals (ACC, 2009). 25. 
Table 4 illustrates such diversity of focus in innovation in different sub-sectors. 23 Among the four 
major types of innovation, the emphasis has generally shifted over time from product innovation to process 
innovation in this industry (Hutcheson et al. (1996), p.21), but this shift best applies to basic industrial 
chemicals (Hutcheson et al. 1995). With limited scope for product innovation, their focus is on process 
innovation and organisational innovation to improve productivity and cost advantage. In contrast, product 
innovation is of primary importance in speciality and fine chemicals, where there is still scope for new 
products and molecules that can be protected by patents and as trade secrets, and as a result price 
competition is less intense compared with that facing trade in basic industrial chemicals. Process 
innovation also plays an important role. In consumer chemicals, renowned for marketing innovation, 
consumers' preference drives product innovation. The remainder of this section will examine the 
underlying industry characteristics of these differences. Table 4. Different foci of innovation in sub-sectors of chemicals industry Basic Industrial

x iii) Underlying Innovation Strategies in Different Segments 26. 
To better understand the different foci of innovation, it is useful to refer to the framework for 
structural analysis of industries proposed by Porter (1980, 1985) before turning to sub-sectors. 24 According 
to the framework, five basic competitive forces – entry, threat of substitution, bargaining power of buyers, 
bargaining power of suppliers, and rivalry among current competitors – define the state of competition in 
an industry (Porter (1980), p.3-4); in coping with these competitive forces, firms have two sources of 
competitive advantage, cost leadership and differentiation (ibid, pp.34-40). 27. 
In the case of basic industrial chemicals, major entry barriers are the initial capital requirements 
and the costs associated with technology, supply of raw materials and location. The source of competitive 
advantage is the cost of production because product differentiation is not likely to take place. For speciality 
and fine chemicals, major entry barriers are product differentiation (e.g. product differences and customer 
relations) and differentiation is the major source of competitive advantage. Consumer chemicals are closer 
to speciality and fine chemicals than basic industrial chemicals, but product differentiation (e.g. brand 
loyalty) is a particular entry barrier, and therefore differentiation is typically the key source of competitive 
advantage. 23 Burgess et al. (2002), Figure 2 gives broadly similar illustration. However, this table is only indicative and 
does not suggest that individual firms may not undertake other types of innovation. 24 The adaptation of Porter framework to the chemicals industry is drawn on Cesaroni et al. (2004), p.124; 
Frohwein and Hansjürgens (2004), pp.26-27. Government can influence many aspects of industry structure 
(Porter (1980), pp.28-29). TAD/TC/WP(2010)9/FINAL 16 28. 
In another related but different framework, Treacy and Wiersema (1993) set out three value 
disciplines, operational excellence, customer intimacy and product leadership, as paths for market 
leadership. Operational excellence means to provide customers with reliable products or services at 
competitive prices and delivered with minimal inconvenience; customer intimacy means segmenting and 
targeting markets and tailoring offerings to match the demands of those niches, thereby establishing 
customer loyalty; and product leadership means offering customers leading-edge products and services that 
enhance the customer's use of the product, rendering the competitors' product obsolete. Operational 
excellence is closely linked to cost leadership (as in basic industrial chemicals), while customer intimacy 
and product leadership can be seen as two possible means for product differentiation (as in speciality and 
fine chemicals and consumer chemicals), which are also reflected in the different foci of innovation in 
different sub-sectors. 29. 
This is inevitably a broad generalisation subject to exceptions and evolution over time. In 
particular, the question of where to find the source of competitive advantage, or the key value disciplines, 
is further accentuated in the economic conditions after the financial crisis (Hodges, 2009). 2. Subsectors i) Basic industrial chemicals (a) Industry characteristics 30. 
Basic industrial chemicals are essentially commoditised products with established specifications, 
including organic chemicals (mainly derived from petrochemicals) and inorganic chemicals as well as 
polymers such as polyethylene and polypropylene. They are produced and sold in large volumes and 
occupy a major part of sales value in the chemicals industry. 25 Opportunities to introduce fundamentally 
new products are limited, although variations of existing products can be introduced in response to market 
needs, thus process technology tends to be more important than product innovation. Production plant 
location is mainly driven by production cost and the supply of raw materials and markets. 31. 
Manufacturing takes place at large dedicated and capital intensive plants using highly specialised 
processes. Process choices need to be made based on the current and projected costs (e.g. future energy and 
regulatory costs) at the time of plant design, since fundamental process changes ex post are very expensive 
due to their high capital intensity and degree of specialisation, even if incremental investments are often 
made in order to keep up with developments in process technology as well as to ensure compliance with 
new regulatory requirements, to improve health and safety conditions at the plant, to eliminate impurities 
and to re-balance product composition. 32. 
High initial capital requirements are a major barrier to entry. On the other hand, the availability 
of key process technologies through licensing has substantially reduced the entry barrier. Available data in 
the 1980s (Figure 11(a)) show the prevalence of licensing in sectors with large scale production facilities 
and relatively homogeneous products (e.g. petrochemicals). In particular, licensing from specialised 
engineering firms ( " SEFs " ) has been particularly important for smaller chemical companies or 
 " non " -chemical companies, which do not have sufficient in-house technological capabilities (Figure 11(b)). 
SEFs originated in the United States in 1950s and further spread to Germany and other developed 
countries, 26 and they have played an essential role as technology suppliers in processes and plant design to 25 Sales share of European chemical industry (2007) by sub-sectors:  " base chemicals "  (45%),  " specialty 
chemicals "  (17%),  " consumer chemicals  " 11%) and  " pharmaceuticals "  (27%). (CEFIC (2009)) 26 The world market share of SEFs licenses (in total number of plants) in 1980-90 was: US (15.1%), West 
Germany (8.8%), UK (2.4%), Italy (1.6%), France and Japan (0.7% each). (Cesaroni et al. (2004), p.146.) TAD/TC/WP(2010)9/FINAL 17 Europe and Japan through to developing countries. Figure 13(b) also shows that not only SEFs but also 
chemical companies have been active as technology suppliers. 27 The availability of technology from these 
technology suppliers has been critical to the global emergence of chemical industry we see today. Box 2. The Functions of Chemical Engineering Companies The business of chemical engineering companies usually involve one or some of the following four categories: (i) Licensing of Process Technologies: Process technologies optimised for specific products are developed and 
licensed to users, especially in basic industrial chemicals. (ii) Licensing of equipment designs: Equipment optimised for a particular chemical process are designed and 
licensed to users, especially in basic industrial chemicals. The optimisation involves appropriate control of kinetics, 
thermodynamics and mass transfer processes and designed by using computer modelling. (iii) Supply of manufacturing equipment: This may involve equipment not dedicated to a particular chemical 
process but can be used in different processes (especially in speciality and fine chemicals). (iv) Supply of catalysts: Catalysts designed for a particular process are developed and supplied to users. 
Catalysts are an essential part of many chemical processes and have a finite useful life. Suppliers provide 
replacements and can improve them through R&D. (b) Technology transfer and entry of emerging economies 33. 
The trade and innovation linkage in basic industrial chemicals has been making a serious impact 
on the chemicals industry. The large scale transfer of technology from developed countries to emerging 
economies through SEFs and chemical companies as well as through joint ventures and M&As have 
helped emerging country players to innovate and enter into the global market; this has in turn created 
competitive pressure on developed country players to innovate further. 34. 
Many emerging economies have been actively promoting the chemical industry to exploit their 
cost advantage and proximity to raw materials (oil and coal) and to growing domestic and neighbouring 
markets. 28 For example, the Indian government has taken steps to improve the competitiveness of the 
chemical industry by abolishing industrial licensing to most of the chemical subsectors, approving FDIs up 
to 100 percent, reducing the list of reserved chemicals for the small-scale sector, and setting up integrated 
Petroleum, Chemicals and Petrochemicals Investment Regions (PCPIR) (Prahalathan (2007), p.50; KPMG 
International (2009b), pp.3-4). In China, petrochemicals is one of the industries in Plans for Promoting the 
10 Leading Industries, announced in January-February 2009, for which large projects are to be supported 
in a prioritised manner, with a target to increase the industry's value added to 1.75 trillion Yuan by 2011 
(Kwan, 2009). Chemical parks of various scales have been developed, large ones encompassing entire 27 At a first glance, active technology licensing by chemical companies looks puzzling, since this appears to 
be a sure way to increase the number of competitors. One explanation is that it was prompted by licensing 
by SEFs, since even if chemical producers do not license their technologies, SEFs will do so anyway (and 
they are under no pressure of potential competition), and it is better for chemical producers to license their 
technology and make some additional profit out of licensing. An alternative explanation is that such 
licensing by chemical companies may also be a part of their strategies, such as to impose a technology 
standard or to provide customers with secondary suppliers using the same technology (Cesaroni et al. 
(2004), p.148-49). See also Arora (1997), pp. 397-99; Arora and Fosfuri (1998), pp.10-14. 28 See cf. KPMG International (2010a), pp.8 and 10. TAD/TC/WP(2010)9/FINAL 18 value chains designed for global players and medium-sized ones developed for domestic investors (KPMG 
International (2009c), p.13; Table 5 below). 35. 
Large-scale investment plans in China and the Middle East announced around 2005 are now 
being made operational. It is estimated that new capacity in 2010 in the basic commodities category will 
comprise almost 8% of the existing global capacity, and nearly 80% of the new capacity in 2009-13 will be 
installed in China and Middle East (Deloitte (2009), p.7). 36. 
To enable emerging economy players to develop their production capacities, the availability of 
technologies through licensing from SEFs and chemical companies has played a key role. Chemical plant 
engineering companies offer a package comprising of core technology, engineering design and knowhow, 
and contract construction services (Arora (1997), p.396), and are active in developing large and efficient 
plants being built up in emerging economies (Gottwald, 2007). A study in India on basic chemical firms 
(inorganic, organic, dyes and pigments, polymers and rubbers) found that acquisition of technological 
capabilities (through investments on imported technology or in-house R&D) is important in determining 
export competitiveness. (Bhat and Narayanan, 2009) 37. 
The entry of emerging market players has exerted strong competitive pressure on chemical 
producers in developed countries (e.g. HLG (2009), p11). The chemicals sector in developed countries, 
especially in basic and intermediate petrochemicals, has already undergone extensive and continuous 
organisational changes and rationalisations during the last three decades as a measure to recover cost 
advantage, driven primarily by competition from new entrants and diminishing economic opportunities 
after the oil shocks in 1970s. Many companies have moved away from being diversified conglomerates to 
focus on their core competencies and have sought to reduce over capacities and to achieve scale economies 
and higher margins (Albach et al. (1996), pp. 35-47; Landau and Arora (1998), pp. 11-12; Chapman and 
Edmond (2000), pp. 755-760) 29 . 38. 
Alongside cost cutting measures such as implementation of lean manufacturing and extension of 
outsourcing, supply chain management is critical for the industry. Its supply chain extends from raw 
materials to finished products, and the supply chain management costs represent 8-10 percent of the 
turnover of chemical companies (KPMG International, 2009d). Facing increased complexity of globalised 
supply chains coupled with lower margins, several major chemical companies have launched innovative 
initiatives to optimise their supply chains and cut cost. 30 Information and communication technology is 
widely introduced to implement process innovation in order to better manage supply chains and 
distribution networks, improving efficiency and customer satisfaction (PwC (2010a), pp.2-3, KPMG 
International (2009d), pp. 11-12). Among the US chemical companies, electronic commerce is especially 
prevalent in basic chemicals, where products are more standardised. Electronic commerce makes up for 
23% of the sales in basic chemicals, whereas it is 10% in speciality chemicals (ACC, 2009). 39. 
Sustainability concerns, alongside cost considerations, are other drivers of process innovation. 
For example, the application of biotechnology to chemicals production (industrial biotechnology or  " white 
biotechnology "  that uses biologically derived catalysts for chemicals production in place of conventional 
ones and may also replace fossil resources with biomass as raw materials, is expected to make production 
processes more environmentally friendly (HLG (2009), p.11; OECD (2001a)). 31 OECD (2010) estimates 29 Deloitte (2009) shows that the commodity chemicals sector experienced sharper decline in gross margin in 
1998-2008 compared with specialty and integrated chemicals companies. See also Section IV.3, iii) infra. 30 KPMG International (2009d) cites examples of BASF, the Dow Chemical Company, Eastman Chemical 
Company and Sumitomo Chemical Co. Ltd. 31 See also Section IV.3, iii) infra. TAD/TC/WP(2010)9/FINAL 19 that, although products made by biotechnological processes currently account for only 1.5% in base 
chemicals (2007), much lower than other segments, this ratio will jump to 10% by 2017. Industrial 
biotechnology is at an early stage of its technological lifecycle: close collaboration between industry and 
academia has been playing an important role. 32 (c) Mergers and Acquisitions (M&A) 40. 
Acquisition and divestiture of businesses are also often a part of large cost cutting and/or 
repositioning strategies for chemical companies. 33 Some large chemical companies, such as ICI, have been 
broken up and/or merged with other companies. 32 OECD (2001a) pp.72 and 78 provides examples. 33 Largest recent examples include acquisition of ICI by AkzoNobel (Box 3) and Rohm and Haas by Dow 
Chemical in 2008. TAD/TC/WP(2010)9/FINAL 20 Box 3. Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI) ICI was founded in 1926 in Britain through a merger of smaller firms to become one of the dominant players in 
the world market in the pre-WWII period, together with IG Farben in Germany (founded in 1925) and DuPont in the 
United States. Operation of ICI for over 50 years focused on three linked large complexes in Teesside at Billingham, 
Wilton and North Tees, with a further large facility at Runcorn and other smaller plants around the world. However, ICI 
progressively withdrew from many of its businesses and employment in chemical industry in Teeside declined from 20 
000 to 11 000 between 1981 and 1998. The Wilton site, the largest single-company complex built by ICI in North East 
England, was transformed and now owned by SembCorp, a company providing engineering and facilities management 
services, hosting chemical companies including Croda International, Dow, DuPont, Huntsman, and Invista. When ICI 
was split to form Zeneca (merged with Astra of Sweden in 1999 to form Astra Zeneca) in 1993, ICI was expected to 
focus on commodity chemicals, yet this was soon reversed to re-focus on speciality chemicals (including businesses 
bought from Unilever) in order to cope with increasing competitive pressure, until it was finally acquired by AkzoNobel 
in 2008. Source: Landau and Arora (1998), p.9; Chapman and Edmond (2000), p.760, Burgess et al. (2002), p.204. 41. 
While the recent downturn has hit the levels of M&A activities, strategic investors have shown 
relative resilience compared with financial investors. In the peak year of 2007, financial investors 
accounted for 20% of the deal value, often involving private equity firms. In 2009, the deal value was a 
quarter of the peak year, and the share of financial investors declined to 13% (Figure 12). 34 This 
manifestation of tight credit constraints notwithstanding, it may well underestimate the level of activities 
by financial investors, since they participate in the bidding process and influence prices, even without 
resulting in acquisition, or they make the deals for minority shares instead of full acquisition. A large deal 
in 2008 involved acquisition of preferential shares convertible to a 10.4% stake in Dow Chemical. 
Moreover, some acquirers, strategic investors in themselves, are portfolio companies of private equity 
firms (financial investors) (PwC, 2009a). On the other hand, as the credit limits make it difficult for the 
chemical companies to find buyers of their depressed assets, restructuring is also being sought by other 
means, such as joint ventures, asset swapping and use of sovereign wealth funds (KPMG International 
(2009b), pp.7-10; Bjacek (2009); Baker (2009), p.31). 42. 
Emerging economies are entering centre stage in global M&A activities. The levels of M&A 
activities involving BRICs countries picked up around 2004, about the same time as their acquisition 
abroad started (Schneider et al. 2009). In particular, India has been active in outward investment 
activities 35 e.g. the acquisition by Tata Chemicals of Brunner Mond in 2006 and General Chemical 
Industrial in 2008, and a more recent bid by Reliance Industries to acquire LyondellBasell Industries in 
November 2009 (the latter had filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in January 2009). 36 Among the 
major motivations for outward investments are thought to be to gain access to knowhow or new markets 
(Schneider et al. (2009), p. 103). 37 The deals involving China have been mainly domestic, with the 34 Chemical sector is defined as chemicals and allied products defined by Thomson-Reuters business 
classification (commodity, agricultural, specialty and diversified chemicals). 35 KPMG International (2010a) notes that chemicals accounted for 48% of overseas investment (in value) by 
Indian firms in the last five years (p.11) 36 This bid was rejected in March 2010. See e.g. Joe Leahy (2010),  " Reliance pushes for Lyondell catalyst "  
the Financial Times, 20 January 2010;  " Lyondell rejects Reliance's $14.5bn bid "  the Financial Times, 8 
March 2010. 37 Tiwari and Herstatt (2009) found that, concerning direct investment from India to Germany, market-
seeking was the dominant investment motivation among IT firms, but technology seeking motivation was 
more important among automotive sector. See also Prahalathan (2007, p.54) for various initiatives of TAD/TC/WP(2010)9/FINAL 21 majority of cross border deals being inbound (i.e. foreign firms acquire Chinese businesses; PwC (2009b), 
p.8). Major Chinese companies have set up joint ventures with global players in China in wide range of 
products (Table 5; Engman et al. 2006, p.125). In one count, a majority of 10 000 chemical units in China 
are joint ventures (Prahalathan, 2007, p.32). However, outbound activities from China are expected to 
expand in near future (PwC (2009b), p.3; Shuqing (2009)). 43. 
This broad development is not over today but has been further intensified by the financial crisis. 
KPMG International (2009a) predicts that a massive expansion in bulk chemicals in the Middle East to 
2015 will make up to 20% of plants of the European petrochemical industry uncompetitive, and that while 
European and US companies concentrate on portfolio rationalisation and divestiture of distressed assets, 
cash rich Middle Eastern and Chinese players will move to acquire these assets to gain access to 
technology and the market over the next one to two years. 38 Table 5. Major Sino-foreign petrochemical joint ventures Joint Venture

A study by the Boston Consulting Group (BCG) estimates that this direct supply accounts for 90% of the global 
distribution, but that distribution through third parties has increased by 10% in 2006-08, higher than the growth rate of 
chemicals consumption. Industrial chemicals occupy about 60% of the third-party distribution, whereas specialty 
chemicals make up the remaining 40%. If the chemical products are very diverse in nature, so are their customers. 20-40% of chemicals are believed to 
be consumed by customers with annual consumption less than 100 000 euro, depending on the customer industry, 
and this ratio is much higher in China and Brazil (over 75%). Those smaller customers are at the same time 
contributors to profit margin for producers due to strong pressures on prices from larger customers. Handling the Indian firms for overseas expansion; The Economist (2010), Grow, grow, grow: What makes emergin-

outsourced to third-party distributors, aiming to improve cost efficiency by rationalising sales efforts or, in case of 
emerging markets, to overcome the insufficient sales volume for direct sales. The business model of chemical distributors is to source from multiple producers to ensure a broad offering; to 
take physical ownership of products, warehouse them and mix, blend and repackage them to meet the needs of 
customers; and to sell and physically transport goods to customers. It is distinguished from the business models of 
logistics-only companies and trading companies, which do not take ownership or offer key value added services such 
as mixing and blending. These services offered by chemical distributors enable customers to benefit from single 
sourcing, speed and flexibility of delivery. The BCG study suggests that there is still room for producers to rationalise their distribution, not only because the 
process of outsourcing is ongoing but also because many of the producers currently have a complex relationship with 
multiple distributors due to lack of coordination across business units and regions. It also notes that more acquisitive 
growth to form a global network will contribute to improve the value and competitiveness of a distribution business, and 
will meet the expectations of producers and customers better. During the past several years, M&As in chemical distribution, especially in Europe, has been driven by private 
equity investors, who were attracted by stable cash flows, limited financial risks and profitable exit prospects of this 
business. They are active in acquisition of other chemical distributors to seek synergy and to increase market value. 
The financial crisis also hit the distribution business and M&A activities, but the initial public offering (IPO) of Brenntag 
AG, the leading chemical distributor and owned by BC Partners Ltd, which raised 747.4 million euros in late March 
2010 is expected to raise the prospect of further flotation and consolidation. As the drive for cost efficiency persists on 
the side of producers, especially in basic industrial chemicals, relations between producers and distributors can 
become more important than ever before. 40 ii) Speciality and fine chemicals (a) Industry characteristics 44. 
Speciality and fine chemicals are, compared to basic industrial chemicals, higher value-added 
products produced on a smaller scale in more flexible plants using simpler chemicals as inputs. Examples 
include dyes, paints, sealants and adhesives as well as certain organic chemicals and petrochemicals (e.g. 
engineering plastics). The products are highly specialised and diverse, designed to perform a particular 
function to meet the needs of the market or customers, mainly in other industry segments. An essential 
aspect of the business, therefore, is to sell solutions to customers' problems (Swift (1999), p.35). Products 
are also formulated as services (known as chemical management services) instead of goods; e.g. selling 
water treatment services instead of selling chemical products for water treatment. 41 45. 
In response to increasing competitive pressure in basic industrial chemicals, many chemical 
companies have been turning to speciality and fine chemicals for their sources of profit where product 
differentiation rather than cost is the key source of competitive advantage (e.g. Burgess et al. (2002), 
p.200). This is especially the case with developed countries, but companies in China, India and Middle 
East are also seeking to move in this direction (KPMG International (2009b, 2009c), Baker (2009)). The 
relative flexibility of these production plants makes it easier to introduce new process steps or manufacture 
a wide range of products. 46. 
The diversity of speciality and fine chemicals is reflected in the impact of the recession since the 
last quarter of 2008. The chemicals used in automotives and construction were hardest hit (coatings, 40 BCG (2010); Fermont (2007); HLG (2009);  " The chemistry of private equity " , Chemistry World (February 
2008);  " The time is ripe "  ICIS.com (23 November 2009); Martin Arnold  " Brenntag listing raises 748m for 
BC Partners " , FT.com (29 March 2010). 41 See CIGT (2002), p.95 and Upstill (2006), p.21 for more illustrations and examples. TAD/TC/WP(2010)9/FINAL 23 adhesives, sealants), in contrast to those used for personal care, food and pharmaceuticals. But such 
conventional product segments still do not complete the picture. For example, a number of companies are 
finding their future in product innovation in environmentally friendly construction chemicals, which are, 
again, coatings, adhesives, sealants, but designed to be energy efficient, durable and less wasteful, and are 
actively investing in the development and commercialisation of those products. 42 (b) The role of product innovation 47. 
The crucial role of product innovation in speciality and fine chemicals can be seen in the higher 
proportion of revenues generated from new products than in industrial chemicals (see supra Section 
III.1.(i)). Product innovation in speciality and fine chemicals can serve various purposes. First, as these 
products are typically designed to achieve certain outcomes (e.g. dyeing fabrics, weeding particular plants), 
new products may be introduced to improve intended performance or to introduce more differentiated 
quality specifications (grades). Second, new chemicals may be introduced to meet new demands created by 
innovation in downstream markets. This is typically the case with new active pharmaceutical ingredients 
supplied to the pharmaceutical industry, but new molecules may be introduced in other sectors to meet new 
economic and social needs, such as the new demand for environmentally friendly products (e.g. fuel cells, 
organic LED). Third, new chemicals may also be introduced due to their improved performance in the 
process of production or use by reducing inputs or eliminating harmful constituents. Finally, new products 
may serve as substitutes for regulated chemicals. This may happen in response to prohibition of some 
chemicals (e.g. CFCs by the Montreal Protocol) or regulation of the way in which products are marketed 
and consumed (e.g. the treatment of effluent or disposal of waste). Trade often serves as a conduit for the 
fruits of innovation in the chemicals sector to improve performance and foster innovation in downstream 
sectors. Box 5. Contribution to GHG Emission Savings in Downstream Industries Speciality and fine chemicals can serve as an enabler of innovation for their users, beyond the boundary of the 
chemical industry. Contributing to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions is one such example. Speciality and fine chemicals are used for various emission saving technologies and products. A report by the 
International Council of Chemical Associations (ICCA (2009), p.11) identifies  " the biggest levers evaluated for 
emissions savings enabled by the chemical industry "  including: insulation materials for the construction industry, 
increased agricultural yields due to crop protection chemicals and fertilisers, new lighting technologies based on 
compact fluorescent lamps, plastic packaging, marine anti-fouling coatings, synthetic textiles, automotive plastics, low 
temperature detergents, increased engine efficiency, plastic piping. In aggregate, this ICCA report estimates that for 
every ton of carbon dioxide emitted by the chemical industry in 2005, it enabled 2.1 to 2.6 tons in savings via the 
products and technologies it provides to other industries or users. 42 ICIS.com (2009), Deliver the goods (23 November 2009); ICIS.com (2010), Green Build up (15 January 
2010). TAD/TC/WP(2010)9/FINAL 24 Box 6. Product Innovation in Response to Regulation and Environmental Concerns 43 AkzoNobel produces a range of chelating agents, which sequester metal ions in aqueous solutions, for 
household and industrial cleaning products such as detergent and soap. One of these products, NTA (nitrilotriacetic 
acid), has been coming under increased regulatory scrutiny in Europe and the United States due to its potential 
carcinogenic impacts. Since global household product manufacturers who use this do not wish to have multiple 
formulations in different markets, the product is likely to be phased out including from markets where it does not face 
regulation. An alternative product known as Dissolvine GL was developed in 2000. There was initially limited interest from 
customers to test and approve this product because it was more expensive than NTA, but the prospect of regulation 
boosted the interest in this product. There was also a potential environmental benefit that drove interest in it, as it can 
be used as a replacement for some phosphate/phosphonate compounds, which are also under scrutiny in the United 
States, Canada and France. Unlike NTA which is produced from fossil fuels, this alternative product is made using 
natural carbon sources from monosodium glutamate derived from food grade molasses, which means that 60% of the 
carbon atoms in the formulation are derived from sustainable sources and 40% from fossil fuels. 48. 
Trade not only serves as a channel of the fruits of product innovation, but it can also work to 
expand the sources of innovative ideas. A survey shows that customers and suppliers are among the most 
important sources of innovative ideas (after  " within the firm " ) (Eurostat, 2007), but in the chemicals sector 
38% of firms who introduced a new product answered that their customers were very important as a source 
of information for innovation (26% for overall sample). 44 This is particularly true with speciality and fine 
chemicals, where close customer relationships and servicing are important part of the business (Swift 
(1999), p.35). (c) Commoditisation, shift in market gravity and push for further innovation 49. 
Even in speciality and fine chemicals, products are often eventually commoditised, and it is 
recognised that this product and technology lifecycle is being shortened thus putting pressure on profits 
(Baker (2009), p.30; Jerrentrup (2009)), due in part to globalisation. Chinese companies are active in 
partnership with multinationals to gain access to advanced technologies, alongside in-house R&D (KPMG 
International (2009c), p.8). They are also pursuing outbound M&A in speciality and fine chemicals, the 
main motivation of which is considered to be gaining know-how. 45 Indian firms are also active in overseas 
investment in this segment. 46 A large supply of well qualified chemists and chemical engineers, including 
in emerging economies, together with the increased numbers of flexible chemical manufacturing facilities 
in the world means that there is increasing potential for successful products to be copied by competitors 
(Cesaroni et al. (2004), p.127). 50. 
For example, fine chemical firms who develop and manufacture timber treatment chemicals used 
to anticipate that it would take six years for them to be commoditised following the entry of low cost 43 Information taken from an interview with Alan Alex, Chelates EMEA, AkzoNobel Functional Chemicals, 
by Paul Wright, external consultant for this study, and AkzoNobel (2009)  " Cleaning up " , AkzoNobel 
Magazine Issue 3 (November 2009). 44 Patel (2008), p.66. This percentage is even higher in biotechnology, machinery, automotives and 
ICT/electronics, which recorded over 40%. 45 China National Bluestar Corporation took over the Silicone Division of Rhodia, a listed France based 
speciality chemical company, in October 2006 at 504 million USD. (Schneider et al. 2009). 46 For example, Kiri Dyes & Chemicals acquired Dy Star (Germany) for 70 million USD in March 2010 
(KPMG International (2010), pp.7 and 11). TAD/TC/WP(2010)9/FINAL 25 producers abroad. This period of time would give the innovator an opportunity to recoup its research and 
development costs. More recently, however, this period has shortened to eighteen months, and the returns 
on product innovation have accordingly fallen for some firms to the point where they can no longer rely on 
it as a source of competitive advantage. 51. 
Increased competition makes the case for further innovation even stronger. There has been a wide 
variation in the performance of speciality and fine chemicals companies during the past 10 years, and 
innovation to keep up with the market has been a key feature of the top performers (Deloitte (2009), p.16). 
An econometric analysis at country level (see Appendix 2) also lends some support to the concept that 
innovative capacity (the number of patent applications) is correlated with export and import patterns. 47 52. 
However, competition also has an effect of reducing the financial capability to finance R&D 
expenditure, and the time needed for R&D before commercial implementation is critical in the face of 
shortened product lifecycle. This necessity for cost and time savings has driven  " open innovation "  to gain 
currency (OECD (2008b), p.27): companies increasingly rely on outside innovation for new products and 
processes. De Wit et al. (2007) found that open innovation is particularly frequently observed in 
development of new technologies in new markets in various sectors albeit to varying degrees. 48 They also 
found that partners for innovation are influenced by the nature of the project: cooperation with universities 
and specialised institutes very often takes place in the development of new technologies, whereas the 
development of new markets with existing technologies takes place in cooperation with other companies. 53. 
For example, the development of organic semiconductor materials is being undertaken at an 
international level on various fronts involving large and small companies, often university spin-outs. 
Partners of cooperation can be within the industry or in other industries in order to seek synergy. 49 
Partnership with customers is another possibility, which can foster technological advantages while securing 
business relations. An econometric analysis (see Appendix 2) shows that cross border co-invention 50 has a 
positive impact on the bilateral trade flows. The causation inferred from the timing of patent application 
and trade flows appears to be working differently across sub-sectors, but practically, if collaborative 
activities leading up to patent application is taken into account, such collaborative activities may have 
implications in fostering trade relations. 54. 
As the centre of gravity of market shifts to emerging markets, investment in those growing 
markets has become an important part of business strategy, particularly in the speciality and fine chemicals 
segment (Baker, 2009; KPMG International, 2010b). Because of the specialised nature of this segment, 
proximity to customers is often considered imperative (KPMG (2005), p.31; KMPG International (2009c), 47 Exporters' patent application is generally positively correlated with trade flows, and importers' patent 
application is generally negatively correlated with trade flows, although their statistical significance varies 
depending on the sub-sector and the specification. 48 This study compares between food, polymers and equipment manufacturing sectors in terms of R&D 
collaborations. In all sectors collaboration is the highest for  " new market, new technology " , and it is the 
highest in equipment manufacturing and the lowest in polymers. 49 Süd-Chemie and Linde launched a pilot plant in May 2009 for the production of second generation 
bioethanol from cereal straw. It is expected that Süd-Chemie´s expertise biocatalysis and bioprocess 
engineering and Linde's experience in implementing chemical and biotechnological processes on a 
commercial scale will generate synergy (Jerrentrup (2009), p.5; Süd-Chemie (2009)). 50 It refers to the number of patents invented by a country with at least one inventor located in a foreign 
country (OECD (2009a), pp.127-28). TAD/TC/WP(2010)9/FINAL 26 p.12) and this relates not only to production but also extends to R&D functions. 51 This can necessitate 
organisational innovation in making investment decisions and managing extended supply chains. 51 See KPMG International (2010b), Table 2 for recent announcements by chemical companies to expand 
their operations in China. TAD/TC/WP(2010)9/FINAL 27 Box 7. Management of Global R&D Investment Decisions in Emerging Economies 52 AkzoNobel has multiple applications laboratories located in proximity to the customers, such as Houston (for oil 
field chemicals) and Australia, while retaining the central R&D function in Europe. It is intended to encourage customer 
oriented development of products and formulations and to ensure routes to the market, being assisted by their 
distributor and agent networks that identify end use markets and arrange product trials and approvals. Information on 
the development in those application laboratories are shared across the company through on-line internal forums and 
regular meetings so that interaction of ideas take place and ultimately achieve a higher success rate and wider 
adoption of successful ideas. Geographic segmentation changes with developments in economic reality. China and India are now being 
considered as separate regions. In order to make better investment decisions in these regions, the company employs 
a multi-site concept, i.e. locating many products on a single site in a concerted fashion instead of letting individual 
business units decide where to locate new investments. (d) Process innovation as a differentiation strategy 55. 
Whilst product innovation is of primary importance, process innovation is another important 
aspect of innovation in speciality and fine chemicals. It is typically a part of the differentiation strategy 
rather than for cost reduction purposes, for example by reducing lead-time, or enhancing agility, to better 
serve customers (Burgess (2002); Guisinger and Ghorashi (2004); Jerrentrup (2009), p.5). Introduction of 
new products is also often accompanied by the introduction of new processes. 56. 
Process itself can be a core competence of a chemical company. For example, pharmaceutical 
companies often invite competent chemical producers to supply samples of specific candidate 
pharmaceutical chemicals. Suppliers need to undertake high quality synthesis according to the process 
specified by the pharmaceutical company or by developing their own process, initially at a small scale but 
eventually it may turn into a larger scale production. Some companies have developed core competence in 
process technologies to meet such requirements. iii) Consumer chemicals (a) Industry characteristics 57. 
Consumer chemicals are usually formulated products such as personal care products or household 
products. These are differentiated from other segments in that they are marketed to consumers and 
customer influence is much greater. Consumer chemicals are often grouped together with food, drinks and 
tobacco as FMCG (fast moving consumer goods) or consumer packaged products, which is known as the 
birth place of brand management and renowned for marketing innovation (Crawford et al. 2007). Product 
innovation and underlying R&D capability is also indispensable to respond to diverse and often fluid 
consumer preference, and to maintain the power of the brand (Jones, 2005). Although consumer chemicals 
have generally weathered the recession better than others, product innovation that reinforces brand loyalty, 
such as in the field of natural personal care, will stimulate recovery, as the patterns of recovery from 
previous recessions attests. 53 52 Information taken from an interview with Alan Alex, Chelates EMEA, AkzoNobel Functional Chemicals, 
by Paul Wright, an external consultant for this study, and Baker (2009), p.31. 53 Gillian Morris (2010),  " Recession respite " , ICIC.com (14 April 2010). TAD/TC/WP(2010)9/FINAL 28 58. 
In addition to consumer chemicals marketed directly to consumers, many chemical companies 
produce chemical materials for a range of goods marketed to consumers, such as textiles and clothing 
(chemical fibres and dyes), footwear and car seats (polyurethane). They are typically not visible to 
consumers, but the materials are sometimes highlighted when the final goods are marketed. (b) Diversity of consumer preference and emerging markets 59. 
Although multinationals with well-known brands are active in this area, key success factors are 
in-depth knowledge of local market and the ability to adjust the products and marketing methods to local 
consumer preference and other market characteristics. They can be vastly different and at the same time 
changeable. One example is the sense of hygiene: when the practice of washing bodies with water was out 
of fashion in Europe, despite the wide-spread practice of bathing in ancient Roman times, perfumes came 
to the fore among aristocracy, until the practice revived thanks to development of modern germ theory and 
spread of new ideas brought by foreign trade (e.g.  " champu "  (shampoo) from India); the white soap bar 
was launched by an American entrepreneur in 1879, which later benefited from new marketing channels of 
radio and television ( " soap opera " ) starting in the 1930s. 54 60. 
More recently, social and environmental issues have become an important factor behind 
consumer preferences, and consumer chemical companies are finding market opportunities here. For 
example, life-cycle assessments of the energy consumption by Proctor & Gamble for its products found 
that 3% of electricity budgets in US households were on heating water for laundry (Nidumolu et al. (2009), 
p.8), which led to the launch of cold water detergents in 2005. Unilever considers it important to establish 
 " social missions "  for brands to grow (McKinsey & Co., 2009a). In the cosmetics industry, to stimulate 
sustainable production and consumption, the COSMOS-standard has been developed in Europe that 
defines minimum requirements and common definitions for organic and/or natural cosmetics. Consumers' 
attention can go beyond the narrow definition of consumer chemicals, due to the ubiquitous nature of 
chemical products, and extend to the chemical inputs used in ranges of products, such as polyurethane 
derived from vegetable used in car seats, biodegradable cosmetic packages, or soy inks. Well-informed, 
empowered consumers are a powerful ally in supporting and driving green growth (OECD (2010b), p.80). 61. 
Adding to these, breaking into consumer markets in emerging economies is increasingly an 
important challenge. 55 They are keener and leaner on prices, and their distribution and marketing channels 
tend to be very different from those of developed country markets, yet the consumers in emerging markets 
are increasingly vital sources of further growth, especially amid slower growth in developed countries. 56 62. 
For example, expanding the market into more remote areas in India was a challenge due to the 
lack of a retail network, advertising coverage and adequate roads and transport for Unilever despite its 75 
year history in India supplying food, personal care and home care products through a portfolio of 
international and local brands targeting consumers of different income levels. Hindustan Lever, Unilever's 
business in India, started  " Project Shakti "  ( " strength "  in Sanskrit) in 2000 by partnering with local 
women's self-help groups. Members of the groups are given training by the company to be entrepreneurs, 
and they borrow money from the groups to start businesses as distributors of Hindustan Lever products. By 
the end of 2004, there were over 13 000 Shakti women entrepreneurs covering 50 000 villages, selling to 
70 million consumers. (Unilever (a); Keys et al. 2009) Hindustan Lever is also developing a separate 54 The Economist (2009),  " The joy of dirt "  (17 December 2009). 55 See The Economist (2010),  " Easier said than done: Emerging-market consumers are hard to reach "  (15 
April 2010). 56 See also Figure 4(b) (showing growth rates higher for export from HICs to LMICs than for HICs to HICs 
in consumer chemicals (HS Chapters 33 and 34) in 2001-08). TAD/TC/WP(2010)9/FINAL 29 campaign to educate people to wash their hands with soap, called  " 'Swasthya Chetna "  (health awakening), 
as a marketing programme for its soap brand. By the end of 2007, the campaign had reached nearly 44 000 
villages and around 100 million people. (Unilever (b)) 63. 
Not only marketing innovation, but also product innovation is taking place to develop products 
that meets the specific needs of emerging markets. Proctor & Gamble started its business in China in 1988 
through a joint venture targeting consumers in wealthy coastal cities with its premium products. By 2001, 
this strategy reached its limits and it needed to expand to the  " mid-tier consumers "  to sustain growth and 
profitability, in direct competition with local companies with lower costs and better knowledge about the 
local consumers. In order to achieve the price levels affordable for these new consumers, which is vastly 
different from those of globally marketed products, P&G now designs products in China, controlling the 
costs to meet the required price levels. (Hexter and Woetzel, 2007, pp.6-7) 64. 
There is an early sign that product innovation and marketing efforts are contributing to the 
recovery of consumer products companies. Proctor & Gamble and Unilever both announced 7% increases 
in sales, and the introduction of new products and additional spending on marketing are considered to have 
boosted the sales, and strong sales growth in emerging markets has contributed to this overall 
performance. 57 65. 
In some cases, products developed for emerging markets are being re-introduced to developed 
country markets – labelled  " trickle-up "  innovation or  " reverse innovation "  to highlight the contrast to a 
traditional model where a product is developed in developed countries and eventually marketed in 
developing countries. The reported case that comes close to consumer chemicals is an over-the-counter 
medicine by Proctor & Gamble, initially developed for the Latin American market and eventually 
rebranded and marketed in the United States and European markets 58 , but otherwise reported cases are still 
limited. 59 Yet it has been argued that it is more a necessity than an option to compete effectively with 
emerging market competitors. Given the increasing economic weight of emerging economies and the 
increasing price-consciousness of consumers in developed countries, as well as tighter R&D budgets of 
MNEs, this can become one of the models of product innovation in consumer chemicals. IV. 
Trade-related measures 1. Tariffs 66. 
Even though the levels of tariffs have declined over the past ten years, there still remain non-
negligible levels of tariffs, especially in non-CTHA participants, that incur direct costs to traders and 
consequently consumers. Econometric analysis based on the gravity model (Appendix 2) shows that tariffs 
still have a negative impact on trade in chemicals. 67. 
In order to see how actual tariff levels are related to innovation considerations, we could test the 
following two possibilities. First, if countries value technology diffusion through imports (cf. Coe et al. 
2008), they may tend to set up relatively lower trade barriers for sectors with relatively less technological 57 Hannah Kuchler (2010),  " 'Innovation' paying off at Unilever " , FT.com, 29 April 2010; Jonathan Birchal, 
 " P&G sales surge on new products " , and  " Emerging markets fuel consumer goods groups " , FT.com, 29 
April 2010. 58 Jana, Reena (2009a),  " Innovation Trickles in a New Direction " , BusinessWeek 11 March 2009; Jana, 
Reena (2009b),  " P&G's Trickle-up Success: Sweet as Honey " , BusinessWeek 31 March 2009. 59 See Immelt et al. (2009) (health care devices by General Electric); Jana, note 58 (handsets by Nokia and 
dried noodles by Nestlé). TAD/TC/WP(2010)9/FINAL 30 capability than other domestic sectors. On the other hand, if countries emphasise infant industry protection, 
they may tend to set up relatively higher trade barriers for less competitive industries (cf. Krugman, 1987). 68. 
A simple investigation of correlation between relative tariff levels, relative export value (i.e. 
revealed comparative advantage) and relative R&D spending shows that there is no statistical evidence to 
support either of those hypotheses (see Appendix 3 for details). This may imply, as far as the chemical 
industry is concerned, that innovation considerations are not systematic determinants for tariff policy in 
most of the countries. Another possibility is that innovation considerations are actually systematic 
determinants for tariff policy but are working in different directions (either technology diffusion enhancing 
or infant industry protecting) across countries, which also prevent a systematic statistical relationship from 
emerging as a whole. Definitive conclusions cannot be drawn from the exercise here. 2. Export Restrictive Measures 69. 
While access to raw materials under fair and undistorted conditions is essential for a range of 
industries including chemicals, tight supply and demand conditions as well as various forms of government 
intervention aiming at restricting exports have been making it more challenging than before (European 
Commission (2008c), pp.4-5). 70. 
Disciplines on export restrictions are provided generally in GATT Article XI paragraph 1;  " No 
prohibitions or restrictions other than duties, taxes or other charges, whether made effective through quotas, 
import or export licences or other measures, shall be instituted or maintained by any contracting party on 
the importation of any product of the territory of any other contracting party or on the exportation or sale 
for export of any product destined for the territory of any other contracting party. "  60 This is, however, 
subject to an exception in the GATT Artile XI paragraph 2 and general exceptions under GATT Article 
XX, notably its chapeau and (g) ( " relating to the conservation of exhaustible natural resources if such 
measures are made effective in conjunction with restrictions on domestic production or consumption " ). 71. 
Whereas import duties are placed under the disciplines contained in the Schedules of Concession 
(GATT Article II), there is nothing that generally restricts export duties 61 in the current GATT provisions. 62 
It is worth noting, however, commitment by individual Members to limit export duties on specific tariff 
lines can be found either as a part of accession commitment, 63 or as a part of the Schedules of Concession, 
with respect to specific tariff lines, although the actual cases are very limited. MFN principle applies also 
to export duties (GATT Article I.1). 60 GATT Article VIII.3(a), 5 (Fees and Formalities connected with Importation and Exportation) and X.1 
(Publication and Administration of Trade Regulations) lay out procedural principles that apply to exports 
as well as imports. In addition, export taxes and export restrictions are listed as one of the  " Indicative List 
of Notifiable Measures "  in the  " Decision on Notification Procedures "  adopted at the end of the Uruguay 
Round negotiations, although it is accompanied by a note that states  " [t]his list does not alter existing 
notification requirements "  in the agreement.  " Decision on Notification Procedure on Quantitative 
Restrictions "  was adopted in 1996 (but not on export duties), and the notifications are regularly monitored, 
although the actual notifications made have been less than complete. See G/L/223/Rev.17 (15 March 2010) 
for the latest update. 61 Export duties and export taxes have been used interchangeably. See Kazeki (2005), pp. 178-79. 62 In some instances, export restrictions and prohibitions were replaced by export duties following the legal 
disputes at the WTO. See Kazeki (2005), p.212. 63 Examples are listed in Kazeki (2005), Table 5.4. TAD/TC/WP(2010)9/FINAL 31 72. 
While the export restrictive measures have thus been subject to a lesser extent of discipline 
compared with import measures under the GATT/WTO system, 64 it has in the past addressed this issue in 
the context of supply of raw materials, in particular oil, in the 1970s 65 and of voluntary export restraints in 
the 1980s 66 , and now it is drawing renewed attention in the context of supply of raw materials. The 
chemical industry has also voiced their concerns over recent moves by some governments to take export 
restrictive measures, such as export taxes on yellow phosphorus and export licenses or quotas on fluorspar 
and coke by China, thereby restricting supplies to other countries to, various raw materials (HLG (2009), 
p.33). When the raw material production is concentrated in a few countries (Table 6), export restrictive 
measures taken by a producing country can have a large impact on the global supply, and hence on the 
industries using the raw materials in question. 73. 
In the WTO, proposals to enhance transparency in export licensing and to establish of rules on 
transparency and predictability on export duties are pending in the Doha negotiations. 67 Export related 
measures on raw materials are also pending before the dispute settlement panel, which covers, in part, 
essential inputs to some segments of the chemicals industry and inorganic chemicals used in other 
industries. 68 74. 
While the stated policy objectives of export restrictive measures include environmental 
protection, promotion of domestic downstream industries, fiscal revenues and preservation of reserves, the 
actual economic impact of export restrictive measures and their effectiveness in achieving these objectives 
depends on various factors, such as supply and demand conditions, availability of alternative sources as 
well as the nature of the raw material in question and of the measure itself (Korinek and Kim (2009), 
pp.12-22). The trade policy review report on China prepared by the WTO Secretariat observed  " [a]lthough 
the authorities believe that export taxes could help conserve natural resources or protect the environment, 
their economic effectiveness in achieving those objectives is questionable. "  (WTO (2010a), para. 78) At 
the OECD workshop on raw materials held in October 2009, it was found that  " export restrictions create 
economic inefficiency by distorting resource allocation and can negatively affect the welfare of trade 
partners "  and  " [w]hile export restrictions are applied to achieve several policy objectives, there exist 
alternative policy options with different trade impacts "  (Kim, 2009). 69 Further studies are envisaged on this 
topic. 64 Despite this asymmetry between exports and imports, economic theory postulates that export tax in one 
sector amounts to import tax on the other (Lerner's symmetry theorem), which further implies that import 
tax in one sector amounts to export tax on the other. See Vousden (1990), pp.46-47. 65 The issue of export restrictions was negotiated in the Tokyo Round, but it only resulted in an understanding 
that the GATT export provisions should be reassessed in the near future. Jackson et al. (1995), p.947. 66 Japan – Trade in Semi-Conductors, Report of the Panel adopted on 4 May 1988 (L/6309 – BISD 35S/116);

The chemical sector is highly regulated for safety, health and environmental reasons and there 
has been significant evolution in the regulatory regime during the past few decades. When governments 
started to take regulatory actions on chemicals, they focused on specific industrial chemicals or pesticides 
which were known to pose important health or environmental problems, but by mid-1970s, comprehensive, 
forward-looking strategies were called for to identify and manage the potential risks of the hundreds of 
new chemicals and chemical products entering the global market every year. Somewhat later, the much 
greater number of chemicals and pesticides that were already on the market and whose potential risks had 
not been identified arose as a policy issue (OECD (2001b), p.76). The OECD has been active since 1971 in 
developing and co-ordinating chemical and pesticide related activities under its Chemicals Programme 
(OECD (2008c), p.383). There are a number of other international arrangements to control chemicals for 
various purposes. 70 76. 
The World Summit on Sustainable Development (WSSD) in 2002 called for chemicals to be 
produced and used in ways that minimise significant adverse impacts on human health and the 
environment ( " 2020 goal " ). Since then, many countries have taken steps to improve their chemicals 
regulation. Also, the Strategic Approach to International Chemicals Management (SAICM) was adopted as 
a policy framework to foster the sound management of chemicals in 2006. 77. 
Under the rules of the WTO, Members are generally able to take measures necessary to protect 
human, animal or plant life or health,  " [s]ubject to the requirement that such measures are not applied in a 
manner which would constitute a means of arbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination between countries 
where the same conditions prevail, or a disguised restriction on international trade "  (GATT Article XX, 
chapeau and (b)). More specifically, the Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade ( " TBT Agreement " ) 70 E.g. the Basel Convention (hazardous waste), the Montreal Protocol (CFCs) and the Rotterdam Convention 
(hazardous chemicals), Stockholm Convention (persistent organic pollutants), United Nations Convention 
Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (drug control) and the Chemical 
Weapons Convention (arms control). TAD/TC/WP(2010)9/FINAL 33 stipulates a set of rules to ensure that technical regulations and standards do not create unnecessary 
obstacles to international trade, while recognising the policy objectives of the protection of human, animal 
or plant life or health, of the environment (TBT Agreement, preamble). It lays out, among others, a 
notification procedure for technical regulations when a relevant international standard does not exist and if 
the technical regulation may have a significant effect on the trade (TBT Agreement, Article 2.9; Article 5.6 
for conformity assessment procedures). 78. 
According to the TBT Information Management System, database maintained by the WTO 
Secretariat, there have been over 1600 notifications under Article 2.9 and 140 notifications under Article 
5.6 for chemicals (HS Chapters 28-39) since the WTO came into being in 1995. 71 Almost half of them 
refer to human health, followed by environmental protection and labelling. The pattern is substantially 
different across different product groups;  " human health "  predominant in pharmaceuticals and cosmetics 
(Chapters 30 and 33), while both  " human health "  and  " environmental protection "  often appear 
miscellaneous chemicals (Chapter 38; often pesticides) as well as for organic and inorganic, fertilisers and 
paints (Chapters 28, 29, 31, 32). In contrast,  " labelling " ,  " safety " ,  " packaging "  and  " consumer protection "  
are more frequent for consumer chemicals. 71 See also the note for Table 4 for details. Similar study is done by Menezes and Antunes (2005). See WTO 
(2005a), pp.58-62, for various measurements of standardisation activities. TAD/TC/WP(2010)9/FINAL 34 Table 7. TBT Agreement article 2.9.2 Notifications by key words (HS chapters 28-39) HS

Chemicals have been extensively discussed in the meetings of WTO's Committee on Technical 
Barriers to Trade (TBT Committee). 72 Table 8 summarises the chemical-related  " specific trade concerns "  
raised in the Committee meetings in 2009. In addition to these, the trade related measures on chemicals in 
China (Regulations for Environmental Management on the First Import of Chemicals and the Import and 
Export of Toxic Chemicals) and its ongoing revision have been regularly raised in the context of Annual 
Transitional Review (TRM) of China's accession commitment. 73 TBT-related issues involving the 
chemicals have also being discussed in the DDA/NAMA negotiations, and two text proposals have been 
put on the table. 74 72 See e.g. WTO, Chemicals and toys main focus of members' trade concerns, 20 March 2008 <

2008 ii) Chemicals regulation and impact on innovation 80. 
The rules of the WTO are an instrument to balance the objectives of protecting health, safety and 
environment and trade liberalisation. 76 On the other hand, whether and to what extent environmental 
regulations and innovation interact with each other has been extensively debated and analysed. While 
empirical analysis on the chemical regulation has not been abundant (Mahdi (2002), p.9-16), the recent 
regulatory developments in the chemicals sector have drawn much attention. 75 Excerpt from WTO (2010b), pp.25-35. 76 Another instrument are the OECD Guiding Principles for Regulatory Quality and Performance (OECD 
2005b), as concerns to market openness. The impact of standards on trade flows depends on their specific 
types. WTO (2005b), pp.57-74 provides an overview. TAD/TC/WP(2010)9/FINAL 36 81. 
The chemicals regulations in OECD countries have typically been designed as follows: 
Governments collected data from chemical manufacturers to establish inventories of chemicals currently 
being produced, thereby establishing the distinction between  " existing "  (on the inventory) and  " new "  (not 
on the inventory) chemicals. Pre-market notification and registration/approval systems for industrial 
chemicals and pesticides are in place in most OECD countries, and submission of information is required 
for the authorities to assess the risks posed by the substance. This data requirement varies across countries. 
On the other hand, prior to the introduction of pre-market regulation, chemicals were allowed to be put on 
the market with very little or no information concerning their potential risks to human health and the 
environment (OECD (2001b), pp.76-78). Major policy questions have been raised regarding this regulatory 
scheme, such as the adequacy of risk assessment of new chemicals (data requirement from the businesses 
and allocation of responsibilities between the authorities and businesses) and how to ensure the safety of 
the existing chemicals (see e.g. European Commission (2001), p.6; USGAO (2007); USGAO (2009), 
pp.22-24). 82. 
In recent years, various initiatives have been introduced in many jurisdictions regarding 
chemicals regulations. Among them, the EU's REACH regulation, entered into force on 1 June 2007, has 
been widely expected to bring about a sea change in chemicals regulation in Europe and will also have 
global impact. It covers all substances, new and old, unless explicitly exempted, and introduces a 
registration scheme that requires manufacturers and importers to obtain relevant information (technical 
dossier or chemical safety report, depending on the quantity) on their substance as well as an authorisation 
system for substances of very high concern. Downstream users are also brought into the system and share 
certain responsibilities (European Commission (2007), pp.5-7). REACH has been a major issue of 
discussion at the WTO's TBT Committee. 77 Many non-EU WTO Members raised questions around, 
among others, the data generation requirements under REACH in relation to the obligations of non-
discrimination and of not creating unnecessary obstacles to international trade according to terms of the 
TBT Agreement. 83. 
Aside from the debate at the WTO, the REACH legislation has proven an important development 
for regulators in exploring the possible regulatory initiatives on the chemical substances. 78 There have been 
a number of regulatory initiatives in recent years, and following is some of such examples. 84. 
China has been preparing the amendment to its chemical control scheme under Measures on 
Environmental Management of New Chemical Substances, introduced in 2003. 79 The first draft released in 
May 2009 was updated in January 2010, and it is scheduled to be implemented starting October 2010. The 
amendment maintains the basic structure of the current law, which applies to  " new "  substances, and 
 " registration certificate "  of the new substance is required before manufacture or import of the substance. 
The revision, on the other hand, is to increase the data requirement and risk management obligations by the 
industry (Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer, 2009). Certain ecotoxicological testing needs to be completed at 
an accredited Chinese testing laboratory by using species within domestic China, and unlike the current 
law, only a Chinese-registered entity can perform a submission and will be considered the registrant of the 
substance (Bergeson & Campbell, P.C. 2010). 77 Motaal (2009), pp.649-657. It was notified to the TBT Committee in 2004 (G/TBT/N/EEC/52 (21 January 
2004)). 78 See USGAO (2007, 2009); Naiki (2010) (for impact on Japanese regulation); Park (2009) (for impact on 
regulation in China, Japan and Korea); and Heyvaert (2009) (on dynamics of globalisation of regulation). 79 It should be noted, however, that this  " Measures "  is not the only chemical regulation in China. See Park 
(2009), Table 1 and Figure 2 for an overview of the structure of Chinese chemical control system. TAD/TC/WP(2010)9/FINAL 37 85. 
Japan enacted an amendment to the Chemical Substances Control Law (Kashinho) in 2009 and 
the first phase of implementation started in April 2010 (its full implementation is scheduled in April 2011). 
It introduced an annual notification of production and import quantity of all chemical substances above 
threshold, and hazard information may be requested for substances of higher priority of risk assessment. 80 
In parallel, collection of safety information on the prioritised existing chemicals is ongoing under the 
 " Japan Challenge "  programme since 2005. 86. 
Canada launched the Chemicals Management Plan in December 2006, under which harmful 
chemicals were regulated immediately, and collection of information ( " challenge " ) on the properties and 
uses is ongoing for the approximately 200 substances of highest priority. The information will be used to 
decide the best approach to protect health and the environment (Government of Canada, 2009). 87. 
The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced Essential Principles for Reform of 
Chemicals Management Legislation in September 2009, setting out Administration goals to strengthen the 
chemicals regulation, which includes a requirement for manufacturers to provide sufficient hazard, 
exposure and use data on new and existing chemicals to determine their safety, and authority of EPA to set 
priorities for conducting safety reviews on existing chemicals. In parallel, it announced the Chemical 
Management Program which includes risk management on specific chemicals, collection of information to 
prioritise chemicals for review and give public access to information. 88. 
The consequence of the regulation was extensively discussed in the preparatory process of 
REACH since the concept was unveiled in 2001 (European Commission (2001)). KPMG (2005), 
commissioned by the European Commission and European industry groups, found that (a) critical 
substances are not likely to disappear because of REACH testing and registration costs, because suppliers 
are well aware of the impact of withdrawal of substances to the downstream users; (b) as product cost will 
increase because of registration requirement, especially for substances manufactured or imported in lower 
volumes, rationalisation of product portfolios may take place primarily on substances of less critical 
importance to customers and of less strategic importance within the portfolios; even a small percentage of 
withdrawal can give rise to much larger need for reformulation downstream; (c) companies studied do not 
plan to increase their R&D budget, and they will give priority to keeping existing substances and 
formulations on the market to avoid problems down the supply chain, so the scale of divergence of R&D 
budgets depends on the scope of rationalisation; there can also be some delay in the time-to-market as the 
R&D department will get involved in registration activities; and (d) the stress factors accumulate at SMEs. 89. 
The recent regulatory initiatives reviewed above generally point to (a) enhancement of data 
collection of chemical substances, although with considerable differences in scope and data requirements, 
and (b) extension of regulatory coverage to the existing chemicals. Their impact can be thought of in terms 
of both the  " rate "  of innovation and the  " direction "  of innovation (cf. Mahdi (2002), p.9). First, if new 
regulations involve additional cost and time burdens, they may have a negative effect on innovative 
activities (rate of innovation). Second, new regulations may give incentives toward safer and more 
environmentally friendly chemicals (direction of innovation). 90. 
First, the impact of additional cost and time on innovation is likely to be different for different 
sub-sectors. For industrial chemicals, as most of their products are in the  " existing "  category, if new 
chemical regulation is to require submission of data on all chemicals, this will mean additional cost which 
was not foreseen before, and because of the standardised nature of the products competing on prices, 
transferring additional cost onto prices could be difficult. On the other hand, because of their large scale 80 METI et al, (2009); See Naiki (2010) for a comparative analysis of Japanese chemicals regulation and 
REACH. TAD/TC/WP(2010)9/FINAL 38 production, the additional cost can be mitigated by the economies of scale (Frohwein and Hansjürgens 
(2004), pp.30-31). 91. 
In contrast, for speciality and fine chemicals, characterised by continuous product innovation, 
product differentiation and small scale production, if a new regulation incurs additional time and greater 
cost to registration and authorisation of new chemicals than before, this may delay or discourage the 
introduction of new chemicals. If the new regulation extends to existing chemicals, additional regulatory 
burden may result in rationalisation of portfolio of chemicals in the market, especially for low-volume or 
low-margin products. As a quick and flexible response to specific and low-volume customer needs is based 
on the availability of a large pool of differentiated chemical substances, if new regulation diminishes the 
existing and future chemical portfolio, it can adversely affect the competitiveness in this segment and can 
impair the prospect of further innovation. And this, unlike the one-off cost of registration, can leave a 
lasting effect. (Frohwein and Hansjürgens (2004), pp.31-32; Feldmeier and Kienert (2008)) The practical 
effect on innovation depends on the actual time and cost burden and to what extent such rationalisation 
takes place. 81 92. 
Second, regulatory tightening can encourage the innovative efforts toward safer products. 82 Such 
regulatory measures are not limited to outright restrictions of hazardous chemicals but can include various 
other types of measures. Koch and Ashford (2005, pp.43-44) reports the effects of the Massachusetts 
Toxics Use Reduction Act (TURA) passed in 1989, which introduced a requirement for firms to prepare a 
Toxics Use Reduction Plan to show how toxic chemicals are used and how they could be reduced. Out of 1 
000 facilities that took part in the reporting, 400 have quit using the reported chemicals, and the estimated 
cost savings by the firms by implementing safer alternative production process exceeded the estimated 
regulatory cost between 1990-97. 83 Access to information is another type of measure. Since the 
information collected by the regulatory authority contains useful information for the downstream 
businesses and consumers, such information is often made publicly accessible within the limits of 
protection of confidential business information. For example, exposure profiles of individual substances 
and their toxicity and inflammability gives the opportunity for the users of the substances to avoid the risks, 
by not using the substance or properly devising the risk management of the substance. This can, in turn, 
provide incentives for the manufacturers to search for safer alternatives (Koch and Ashford (2005), p.41). 84 93. 
Chemicals regulation should be designed to be non-market distorting to be efficient, innovation-
friendly and promote long-term solutions. 85 As pointed out in the Interim Report on the Green Growth 
Strategy by the OECD, the creation of unintended distortions or unnecessary administrative burdens 
impedes dynamic economic efficiency, and the competitive business environment supports the 
achievement of environmental goals in a cost effective way (OECD (2010b), pp.77-78). Practically, the 
impact of the recent development in the chemicals regulation needs some more time to observe, since they 
are still at an early stage of implementation or preparation. In the case of REACH, for example, 81 European Commission (2007, p.16) expects substances withdrawn because their continued production 
would not be profitable to be 1-2%. It also notes that as a result of the KPMG (2005) study cited above, 
registration costs for lower tonnage substances have been substantially reduced, largely through reducing 
the number of substances requiring any toxicology testing (ibid.). 82 Substitution of hazardous chemicals is stated as one of the key elements for REACH (European 
Commission (2001), p.8; European Commission (2009a), p.5). 83 In the case of REACH, authorisation is required for substances of very high concern, and application for 
authorisation need to include an analysis of possible substitutes, and if suitable alternatives are available 
then the application must also include a substitution plan. (European Commission (2007), p.13) 84 See also discussions on speciality and fine chemicals and consumer chemicals, supra Section III.2. 85 See cf. discussions on export restrictive measures (IV.2) and climate change, infra. TAD/TC/WP(2010)9/FINAL 39 registration of 30 000 substances is scheduled to take place in three stages over the first 11 years after entry 
into force (European Commission, 2007). It is therefore necessary to keep track of those developments in 
order to properly assess their full impact. 86 Box 8. A short review of the literature on the impact of environmental regulation on innovation Regulation has typically been seen as a source of concern in terms of competitiveness of industries, since it 
imposes extra cost and time burden and diverts resources away from innovation. However, Porter and van der Linde 
(1995, p.98) presented an entirely opposite view, arguing that  " properly designed environmental standards can trigger 
innovation that may partially or more than fully offset the costs of complying with them "  because  " reducing pollution is 
often coincident with improving the productivity with which resources are used "  drawing on examples to support this 
 " Porter hypothesis " . 87 The impact of environmental regulation on innovation has also been a subject of economic analyses 
(Jaffe et al. 2000, pp. 31, 65). There have been a substantial number of studies that suggests that more stringent 
environmental regulation or higher electricity prices induce innovative activities and enhance energy efficiency 
(Popp et al. 2009, pp.7-23); if not completely  " offset "  the compliance cost that Porter hypothesis alluded to. The impact 
of regulation can even go beyond the national border. One such example is car emissions regulations in the United 
States in 1970s, which prompted innovation by Japanese and German automotive industries (ibid. p.36). It is important 
to note that an empirical study on this question should be read in its specific context; all environmental regulations are 
not created equal, and their impact on industries 
88 and their responses are not the same. Academic debates aside, businesses have already been embracing environmental and social issues even 
without regulations and many of them recognise the business benefits 
89 (McKinsey & Co., 2009b, 2010; KPMG 
International, 2009b, pp.12-14), and better ways to integrate them as a driver of innovation and to link to corporate 
strategy are being explored (Porter and Kramer, 2006; Nidumolu et al. 2009). As business takes initiatives to improve its performance and governments act to address market failures, which 
includes both environmental (negative) externalities and of knowledge diffusion leading to innovation (positive 
externalities) 
90 by introducing regulation, the impact of regulation on innovation remains a valid area of research. From 
a policy standpoint, integrating both economic and environmental considerations in regulatory decision-making is a 
challenge, and it is a key feature of the green growth strategy that the OECD is developing (OECD (2010b), p.77). iii) Climate change 94. 
The climate change conference in Copenhagen in December 2009 produced the Copenhagen 
Accord, which includes the recognition that the increase in global temperature should be below 2 degrees 
Celsius, a collective commitment by developed countries to provide new and additional resources 
approaching USD 30 billion for the period 2010–12, and implementation and reporting of reduction and 
mitigation of emissions. As this is not considered a full agreement, the negotiation process is expected to 
continue toward the next conference in Mexico in 2010. On the other hand, the EU Emissions Trading 86 Pre-registration was due on 1 December 2008, and registration for the first batch of chemicals will be due 
on 30 November 2010. The final due date will be 31 May 2018. 87 See cf. Paul Krugman,  " An Affordable Truth " , the New York Times, 7 December 2009 (referring to an 
impact of cap-and-trade system for sulphur dioxide in the United States in 1990). 88 Jaffe et al. (1995), p.141, reports sectoral disaggregation of pollution abatement expenditures in the United 
States in 1992. 89 KPMG International (2009b) for chemical industry; McKinsey & Co. (2009b) for survey results, and The 
Economist,  " Size Matters "  (4 December 2009) for consumer electronics. 90 See Popp et al. (2009), pp.3-6 for fundamentals of economics of environment and technological change. TAD/TC/WP(2010)9/FINAL 40 Scheme (ETS) has been in effect since 2005 and is scheduled to be expanded in 2013. A trial 
implementation of an integrated domestic market for emissions trading started in Japan in October 2008. 
Introduction of cap-and-trade system is also a priority of the current US administration. 91 95. 
The chemical industry is in a unique position as both a major industry sector in terms of energy 
use and CO2 emissions and as a major contributor to deliver solutions to climate change (CEFIC (2008b); 
KPMG International (2009b), pp.12-14). The chemical industry uses minerals and fossil hydrocarbons 
(natural gas and oil) as raw materials which are transformed into more complex molecules and polymers. 
Nearly 60% of total energy products (coal, oil products, natural gas, electricity and renewables) are used as 
feedstock, and a little over 40% are used as fuel and power in the European chemical industry (CEFIC 
(2009), p.32). The short-term profitability of the industry is directly linked to fluctuations in raw material 
and energy prices, and in the long-run the sustainability of the current dependence upon non-renewable 
fossil fuels as raw materials is increasingly questioned. 96. 
Extensive studies are underway about the possible use of biomass as a new source of feedstock 
with a view to reducing the industry's reliance on fossil fuels. 92 One study (Patel et al. 2006) on the 
potential impact of use of biomass-derived feedstock to convert into organic bulk chemicals by means of 
White Biotechnology (by fermentation or enzymatic conversion) found that up to two thirds of the current 
non-renewable energy use for the production of the selected chemicals could be saved by 2050. Should this 
projection become reality, significant technological breakthroughs are required as well as favourable 
relative prices between fossil fuels and fermented sugar. 97. 
The demand for a more sustainable use of resources and mitigation of climate change impacts, 
alongside the competition from emerging economies, further adds to the importance of innovation (HLG 
(2009), p.11). 93 Policy measures such as the ETS will give incentives to the search for emission reducing 
technologies (OECD (2009b), pp.63-64). At the same time, technology policy to harness creation of 
environmental-friendly technologies 94 and an open trade policy to facilitate adoption of environmental-91  " And, yes, it means passing a comprehensive energy and climate bill with incentives that will finally make 
clean energy the profitable kind of energy in America. I am grateful to the House for passing such a bill 
last year. And this year I'm eager to help advance the bipartisan effort in the Senate. "  The State of the 
Union Address by President Obama, January 2010. 92 See e.g. European Commission (2008) (on biotechnology in Seventh Framework Programme of Research); 
SusChem (2008). 93 HLG (2009, p.25) pointed out the possibility of carbon leakage in chemicals sector should be taken into 
account under the ETS Directive. On the other hand, OECD (2009b, Chapter 3) estimated that, while 
insufficient participation in global carbon pricing policy can result in non-negligible carbon leakage (12% 
leakage rates in 2050), broader participation will render the size of leakage much smaller (1.7%). Di Maria 
and van der Werf (2008) further shows that induced technological change in energy saving technologies 
will offset or at least mitigate the effect of carbon leakage. See WTO and UNEP (2009), pp.98-110 for a 
survey of the issue and relevance to WTO rules. 94 Aghion et al. (2009) stresses that, in order to foster emergence of green innovation, climate change policy 
should combine a carbon price with high initial clean-innovation R&D subsidies, rather than relying solely 
on carbon price, given the current carbon market under the ETS where the carbon price is low, highly 
volatile and not predictable. Popp et al. (2009, pp.4-5) also argues, based on various studies, that 
environmental and technology policies work best in tandem. This is because while technology policy can 
help creation of new environmental-friendly technologies, environmental policy should be in place to 
encourage adoption of these technologies; on the other hand, it is suboptimal to raise emission tax above 
the level necessary to account for the environmental externality, and targeted technology policy should 
accomplish technology creation and spillovers. TAD/TC/WP(2010)9/FINAL 41 friendly products and technologies will also play essential roles. 95 For example, electric power plants in 
India have been using domestically produced coal because imports were virtually banned to protect the 
domestic industry, but emissions could have been reduced by using high quality imported coal (Khanna 
and Zilberman, 2001). Another study further found that access to technologies, facilitated by openness to 
international trade, further facilitates countries to adopt environmental regulation at lower levels of per 
capita income (Lovely and Popp, 2008). International effort, including trade liberalisation through WTO 
negotiations, can play an important role to accelerate the diffusion of climate change mitigation 
technologies (Newell (2008), pp.13-14). 96 4. Intellectual property i) The role of intellectual property in the chemicals industry 98. 
Intellectual property is an important resource generally and the availability of protection for this 
resource can help to spur innovation; this is also the case with the chemicals sector. 97 For example, in basic 
industrial chemicals, process technology is the key to cost leadership, and technology licensing has become 
a business in its own right. Protection of brands is important especially for consumer chemicals where it 
can contribute to brand loyalty and consumer protection. Various types of know-how (technical and 
commercial) gained through experience are also valuable resources that merit protection. 99. 
But the characteristics of the chemical sector make intellectual property all the more important 
because of the relative ease of producing many types of chemicals once the necessary technologies are 
known (Cesaroni et al. (2004), p.126). Therefore, firms seek to protect as intellectual property their 
knowledge concerning the composition and formulation of chemical products. 100. 
Technologies may be protected by patents or trade secrets, and both have been extensively used 
throughout the history of the chemical industry, whereby the choice may depend on the nature of the 
technology and the strategy in the specific situation. Some knowledge is relatively difficult to protect 
through patents, particularly if it is difficult to codify. In some cases, disclosure requirements under patent 
law may be seen as increasing the risk of imitation. A logical consequence of such considerations is for 
firms to patent the technology which can be clearly articulated, and keep the rest as secret (Arora (1997), 
p.393). In addition, development and defence of patents can be very resource intensive, which may 
contribute to the lower propensity of smaller firms to patent their innovations. 101. 
Nevertheless, patents play an important role in allowing the chemical industry to protect and 
utilise the innovation. For example, wide spread technology licensing by SEFs is facilitated by patents 
(Arora (1997), p.396). 98 Chemistry is one of the major areas of patented technology, representing 14% of 
world patent applications (Figure 13). Individual firms may hold thousands of patents. For example, in 
2008 DuPont alone filed over 1 900 US patent applications and was granted 495 patents; it currently holds 
more than 6 000 active U.S. patents (ACC). Overall, the majority of patent applications in chemistry (2007) 
take place in such areas as organic chemistry (4.7%), organic macromolecular compounds (2.4%) and 
biochemistry (3.0%). 95 WTO and UNEP (2009), pp.61-62. 96 See also Chairman's summary at the Seventh WTO Ministerial Conference (WT/MIN(09)/18, 2 December 
2009). 97 See c.f., CEFIC (2008a). 98 This is consistent with more general observation that stronger intellectual property rights have a positive 
effect on technology transfer via licensing. See Park and Lippoldt (2005). TAD/TC/WP(2010)9/FINAL 42 102. 
Three quarters of patent applications in chemicals are made by the United States, Japan and 
Germany. While these countries lead the field with respect to patents, in recent years new entrants, such as 
India, Korea and China, have gained weight especially in organic and fine chemistry. International R&D 
cooperation is gradually gaining ground in these areas, as the ratio of co-patenting (the patents with at least 
one foreign co-inventor) stood at around 12% and has been edging up since the 1990s (Figure 14). There 
are considerable variations in the pattern of co-invention across countries. In general, countries with larger 
number of patents are lower in their ratio of co-invention. Countries that tend to be relatively low in their 
tendency to co-invention include for example Japan, India and Korea; China is a contrasting example, with 
a large volume of patent applications, whereby almost half resulted from co-invention (Figure 15). 103. 
An econometric analysis (Appendix 2) shows that the number of patent applications has certain 
correlations with export and import patterns, and that co-patenting is positively related to bilateral trade. 
The dynamics between co-invention and trade flows appear to be different in different sub-segments, but it 
may imply in practice that collaborative efforts leading up to patent application may foster trade flows, or 
trade flows and collaborative innovation are mutually reinforcing and go hand-in-hand (especially in basic 
materials). 104. 
The high ratio of co-invention in China may be explained as a natural development, but it appears 
that it may also be driven by policy. In China, preferential tax treatment is provided to those who offer 
intellectual property, R&D capabilities or advanced technology (PwC (2008a), p.5). On the other hand, this 
is sometimes viewed as a requirement to establish a large scale R&D facility, that is a significant cost that 
comes with entry into China (PwC (2008a), p.12), which may inhibit inward investment. ii) Problems with protection and infringement 105. 
Since the TRIPS Agreement entered into force in 1995, developing countries have undertaken 
significant reforms in their intellectual property systems (Park and Lippoldt (2008), p.18). For example, 
patent protection for pharmaceuticals, food and chemical based products in India under the Patent Act of 
1970 was limited to process patents; product patents were not available for these sectors. As this allowed 
 " reverse engineering "  of drugs patented elsewhere, it effectively kept new drugs by multinationals out of 
the Indian market, and this in turn gave the indigenous pharmaceutical production an opportunity to take 
root (Prahalathan and Baruah (2007), p.47-51). The Patent Act of 2005 changed this domestic rule and 
extended the scope of product patent to those sectors to be in line with the TRIPS Agreement (ibid., 
p.64). 99 106. 
Despite these major improvements in statutory protection, implementation remains a source of 
concern. 100 One survey shows that intellectual property infringement is one of the major types of economic 
crime and it tends to result in big losses – over 30% of the relevant IP infringements imposed costs of more 
than 10 million USD on western European companies. In the chemicals industry, a typical incident of 
infringement happens when a business partner utilises technology obtained from another partner (e.g. 
through a joint venture) and often involves production processes and technologies (PwC (2008b), p.3). 107. 
In this respect, much attention has been directed to China (e.g. European Commission 2009b; US 
Department of Commerce, note 100). Despite efforts to strengthen its intellectual property rights 99 The Patent Act of 2005 contains an additional  " improved efficacy "  requirement for patentability of 
pharmaceuticals, which is being challenged by Novartis, following a patent rejection under this rule in 
2006. The case was appealed to the Supreme Court in 2009. See e.g. Bate (2007). 100 See e.g. US Department of Commerce, Protecting Your Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) in China: A 
Practical Guide for U.S. Companies 
<http://www.mac.doc.gov/China/Docs/businessguides/IntellectualPropertyRights.htm>. TAD/TC/WP(2010)9/FINAL 43 enforcement since its accession to the WTO in 2001 and as technology transfer becomes more important 
for domestic companies, multinational companies operating in China attach high importance to further 
improvement of intellectual property protection. One survey shows that those multinationals often 
purposefully exclude vital parts or designs from processes in China, or strive to maintain a marketing 
reputation to make it difficult to replicate and undercut, and thus protect their intellectual property. Such 
strategies have proven relatively effective. On the other hand, protection through recourse to patent and 
trademark law or non-disclosure agreements with key employees are often used, but the survery shows that 
their effectiveness does not necessarily match expectations (von Keller et al. (2005), pp.26-27). 108. 
In the chemicals industry as well, multinationals have found it necessary to actively defend their 
intellectual properties in China (KPMG International (2009c), p.15). Many foreign investors take such 
precautions as creating firewalls between different steps of the production process, or refrain from sharing 
key technologies in a joint venture (PwC (2008b), p.12). These additional efforts to protect intellectual 
properties mitigate some of the potentially positive effects of statutory strengthening (e.g. on technology 
transfer) and divert resources away from innovative activities. The impact is particularly serious for 
smaller firms. 109. 
Finally, counterfeiting of chemical products can have serious consequences (e.g. HLG (2009), 
p.15). For example, counterfeit fertilisers and pesticides have caused vast damage to the environment, and 
they are often difficult to distinguish from legitimate products even for experts. Cases have been reported 
of the destruction of harvests in large areas in China, Russia, Ukraine and Italy due to the use of counterfeit 
chemicals. There are also concerns for health and safety (OECD (2008d), pp.138 and 148; ECPA (2008)). 5. Recent developments 110. 
Since the financial crisis in late 2008, the chemicals industry has been no exception in 
experiencing a decline in trade (-24.6%, 2009Q2) 101 , although the rate of decline has been less than for the 
manufacturing sector as a whole (-29.9%). This sudden turn in economic fortune provoked fears of 
possible serious protectionist reactions, and against this background G20 leaders declared  " within the next 
12 months, we will refrain from raising new barriers to investment or to trade in goods and services, 
imposing new export restrictions, or implementing World Trade Organization (WTO) inconsistent 
measures to stimulate exports " . 102 This was reaffirmed at subsequent summits in London and Pittsburgh in 
2009. 111. 
Active monitoring activities of trade-related measures ensued, most notably at the WTO. It 
estimates that the value of total affected imports was 1% of the world trade (October 2008 – October 2009). 
WTO et al. (2010) notes  " [i]n the period since September 2009, there has been continued slippage towards 
more trade-restricting and distorting policies by many G20 members, although there has been a slight 
slowdown in the number of measures implemented more recently compared with the period immediately 
after the outbreak of the global crisis "  (p.20). In this general context, however, chemicals and plastics are 
among the industries most affected by recently introduced trade-related measures (Tables 9-10), 
comprising 8% of affected import value (other most affected industries include agricultural products, iron 
and steel, footwear, textiles and clothing, consumer electronics, and motor vehicles and parts). Out of 247 
anti-dumping initiations between October 2008 and October 2009, metals have been the most targeted 
goods followed by chemicals (58) and plastics (30). A similar pattern is observed with countervailing duty 
investigations: out of 28 investigations initiated in 2009, 12 covered metals followed by plastics (4) and 
chemicals (3). In terms of safeguard, among 27 initiations in 2009, chemicals (7) was the most affected 101 The information in this and the following paragraphs is taken from WTO (2009b), except otherwise noted. 102 Declaration: Summit on Financial Markets and World Economy, 15 November 2008, Washington. TAD/TC/WP(2010)9/FINAL 44 sector, followed by cement/glass/ceramics (6). It is worth noting also that this sectoral pattern of protection 
is broadly consistent with the historical pattern. 112. 
On export measures, WTO (2010c) observes  " an increasing trend in the use of export restrictions, 
affecting in particular food products and commodities " , while acknowledging that a few countries also 
took measures to reduce the coverage of previously implemented export restrictions (para.46). 103 113. 
These recent developments exemplify both values and limits to the existing multilateral trade 
disciplines. They have not stopped countries from taking these measures, but at the same time multilateral 
rules have shown resilience in this period of exceptional economic stress and maintained credibility as a 
multilateral  " insurance policy "  against the spread of protectionist reactions. This further underlines the 
importance of these monitoring activities to ensure transparency and to seek an ambitious and balanced 
conclusion of the Doha Development Round. 104 Table 9. Trade and trade-related measures in the chemicals sector (October 2008-October 2009) 105 Member

Conclusions 114. 
This study has highlighted the various linkages between trade and innovation in the chemicals 
sector. First, the transfer of advanced technologies, both as embodied in capital goods as well as through 
technology licensing, has been the key to the emergence of the chemicals industry as a global industry. In 
particular, the SEFs (specialised engineering firms) have played a unique role especially in basic industrial 
chemicals in technology spillovers, initially from the United States to Europe and to Japan and more 
recently to emerging economies. 115. 
Second, product innovation in the chemicals sector, especially in speciality and fine chemicals, 
contributes to innovation in downstream sectors, and trade serves as an essential conduit to transmit such 
innovations across borders. 116. 
Thirdly, as a consequence of wider availability of technologies across the globe, technology 
leaders in developed countries are under increasing competitive pressure from new competitors, which 
induces further innovation. The basic industrial chemicals sector has undergone continuous re-organisation 
with some companies now refocusing on speciality and fine chemicals. In speciality and fine chemicals, 
the product life cycle has been markedly shortened, and innovative capacity is an important factor in 
determining corporate performance in recent years. 117. 
Fourth, exports can also be important not just to exploit economies of scale, but foreign contacts 
can give suppliers innovative ideas, especially for speciality and fine chemicals and consumer chemicals. 
The increasing strength of emerging markets is a challenge but it is also offering opportunities for 
innovation. 118. 
Finally, joint ventures and cross border M&A also work as channels of technology transfer. 
China has been attracting foreign multinationals as partners in joint ventures in China, and Indian 
companies are active in acquiring chemical companies in the developed countries. At least part of the 
motivation is considered to be access to advanced technologies. 119. 
In terms of policy issues, this study has addressed tariff, regulation and intellectual property. 
Tariffs have declined substantially as a result of the Uruguay Round and autonomous tariff reductions, but 
remaining tariffs are still non-negligible and work as a trade impediment. Successful conclusion of the 
DDA negotiations is expected to play an important role in promoting trade liberalisation by bound tariff 
reduction. Export restrictive measures on raw materials are also an important concern in this sector, and 
proposals have been tabled to enhance transparency of these measures in the DDA negotiations. 120. 
The chemicals sector is a heavily regulated sector both domestically and internationally. Under 
WTO rules regulations may be considered legitimate if certain conditions are met. Many domestic 
regulations have been notified to the WTO according to the procedure provided in the TBT Agreement, 
and there have been over 1 600 notifications since 1995 in the chemicals sector. The impact of regulation 
on innovation can go either way, and it is likely to be specific to the regulatory design. Many major players 
in this sector have been pursuing regulatory initiatives to enhance data collection and to extend regulatory 
coverage to existing chemicals in recent years. Their practical impact remains to be seen, since they are 
still at an early stage of implementation or preparation. In relation to climate change issues, the chemicals 
sector is in a unique position as both a major sector in terms of energy use and CO2 emissions and as a 
major contributor to deliver solutions to climate change. 121. 
Intellectual property has particular importance in the chemicals sector because of the relative ease 
of producing chemicals as soon as the necessary technologies are known. Throughout the history of the 
chemicals industry, both patents and trade secrets have been used extensively depending on the nature of TAD/TC/WP(2010)9/FINAL 48 technology and strategy. Patents have been instrumental in facilitating technology transfer by licensing. 
The practice of co-patenting is generally correlated with trade flows, indicating the possibility that trade 
relations work as a precursor to more long term collaborative innovation. Infringement of intellectual 
property continues to be a major problem that tends to incur high amount of losses to the intellectual 
property holders. Many multinational companies operating in China have taken various measures to protect 
their intellectual property, despite efforts to strengthen intellectual property rights enforcement by Chinese 
government. 122. 
Finally, as acknowledged at the OECD Council at Ministerial Level in 2007, to strengthen 
innovation performance and its contribution to growth, a strategic and comprehensive cross-government 
policy approach is required, and openness to trade is an essential element of the framework conditions that 
are necessary to stimulate innovation. The OECD Innovation Strategy (OECD, 2010a) is an important 
contribution to policymaking on broader aspects of innovation policy. TAD/TC/WP(2010)9/FINAL 49 APPENDIX 1. TECHNICAL NOTES All data contained in the graphs are compiled by the Secretariat for the purpose of this study, except 
otherwise indicated with the graph. Details of the data compiled by the Secretariat are as follows. 1. Trade Data (1) All trade data are taken from the UN Comtrade in the World Integrated Trade Solution (WITS). 
Income groups are in accordance with the classification by the World Bank (2009), except that Chinese 
Taipei has been added to the high income group for the purpose of this study. (2) For Figures 1–5, data are based on HS1996, supplemented by individual country data based on 
HS1992 for the year 1995 as well as for after 1996 where data based on HS1996 are unavailable in the 
database. While this procedure minimises the bias due to idiosyncrasies in underlying data coverage for 
each year, there still remain other biases. First, data in the WITS based on HS1996 are sometimes 
transposed from raw data in HS2002 or HS2007, depending on the availability of raw data. Second, 
transpositions between HS1992 to HS1996 (e.g. some transfer from Chapter 15 to Chapters 29 and 38), 
which can affect trade values by HS Chapter, are disregarded in the calculation. Third, this procedure does 
not necessarily ensure complete coverage of countries in the underlying data. For 2008, for example, data 
for some larger players such as Saudi Arabia were not yet available at the time of data compilation. (3) Categorisation in Figure 6 is based on the Broad Economic Categories (BEC). In this 
classification system, majority of products under HS Chapters 28-39 are categorised into  " industrial 
supplies n.e.s. (2) " ,  " consumer goods n.e.s. (6) " , while some are  " food and beverages (1) "  and  " fuels and 
lubricants (3) "  which are referred to as  " others "  in Figure 8. All these except consumer goods are 
categorised as intermediate goods for the purpose of national accounts (see United Nations (2002), pp.5-6). 2. Tariff Data (1) All data are taken from the UNCTAD/TRAINS supplemented by the WTO/IDB, in order to 
maximise the underlying data coverage. (2)  " Simple average "  in Figures 7 and 8 means simple average of the simple average tariff rates for a 
product group across countries in a group.  " Weighted average "  in Figure 7 means weighted average (by 
import value) of weighted average tariff rates for a product group across countries in a group. (3)  " CTHA "  covers original participants to the agreement (Canada, EU (27), Japan, Korea, Norway, 
Singapore, Switzerland, United States),  " New WTO "  covers those acceded to the WTO after 1995 except 
LDCs, Tonga and new EU member states (Albania, Armenia, China, Croatia, Ecuador, FYR Macedonia, 
Georgia, Jordan, Kyrgyz Republic, Moldova, Mongolia, Oman, Panama, Saudi Arabia, Chinese Taipei, 
Ukraine, Vietnam),  " Non-CTHA "  covers those not considered as having participated to the CTHA and 
larger traders in chemicals (top 15 traders among non-participants in 2008, except Belarus and Russia due 
to insufficient data availability) (Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Egypt, India, Indonesia, Israel, Malaysia, 
Mexico, Philippines, South Africa, Thailand, Venezuela). These categorisations are made in reference to 
the 
information 
from 
the 
European 
Commission 
<http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/sectors/chemicals/competitiveness/international-activities/trade_en.htm > TAD/TC/WP(2010)9/FINAL 50 and USTR <http://www.ustr.gov/trade-topics/industry-manufacturing/industry-initiatives> websites. For 
Table 2,  " Other OECD "  consists of Australia, Iceland, New Zealand and Turkey. They are not original 
CHTA participants but are considered de facto in line with CHTA commitment (European Commission 
website above). 3. R&D Intensity, Patent (1) R&D expenditures, production values and patent data are taken from OECD STAN Database for 
Structural Analysis, the STAN R&D Expenditure in Industry (ISIC Rev. 3) ANBERD ed2009, and OECD 
Patent Database. (2) Patent data represent the number of patent applications under Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT). 
 " Chemistry "  in Figure 13 refers to technology areas C01-C14 in International Patent Classification (IPC), 
and  " Metallurgy "  refers to the rest of Section C. Although PCT applications facilitate international 
comparison of patent statistics, the period up to 2000 is a transition period that needs to be interpreted with 
care (OECD (2009a), p.66). (3) Technology classifications in Figures 14-15 are in reference to  " new concept of technology 
classification "  in Schmoch (2008), p.9. TAD/TC/WP(2010)9/FINAL 51 APPENDIX 2. TRADE PATTERNS AND CO-INVENTION a) The Model To test the impact of tariffs and patent application on trade flows, the estimation has been based on 
the gravity model with fixed effects after Anderson and van Wincoop (2003) adapted in Portugal-Perez 
et al. (2009). The specification here is: ln(import) ijt = ln(1 + tariff rates) ijt + ln(patent, importer) it + ln(patent, exporter) jt + ln(patent, co-
invention) ijt + D ij + x i + y j + (w t )+ e ijt For importer i, exporter j and year t, with fixed effects in the importer (x), exporter (y) and product (w) 
dimensions. D covers distance, common language dummy and contiguous (common border) dummy. The 
estimation is done with respect to three sub-sectors. Portugal-Perez et al. (2009) tested the impact of international standards and tariffs on trade flows with 
similar control variables, but patent applications may also be associated with trade flows. If patent 
applications represent export competitiveness, exporters' patent application should have positive signs, and 
if patent applications reflect absorptive capacity of foreign technology, importers' patent application 
should have positive signs. If cross-border co-invention (patent applications filed with foreign inventors) 
represents global collaborative networks which cover both technological exchanges and trade in goods, it 
should have a positive sign. Causation between co-invention and trade flows can further be tested by 
changing the timing of co-invention (one-year lag and one-year lead) in the estimation. (b) Data Variables

(a: p<0.01, b: 0.01<p<0.05, c: 0.05<p<0.10) (d) Observations Co-invention is significantly and positively correlated to trade flows. Co-invention with one-year lag 
is statistically significant only for basic materials chemistry, but not for others. Co-invention with one-year 
lead is statistically significant for organic chemistry and for basic materials chemistry, but not for 
macromolecular chemistry. In both  " lag "  and  " lead " , signs are invariably positive. Therefore it appears that 
this positive causation between the two is different in different sub-sectors: in organic chemistry bilateral 
trade relations foster bilateral co-invention; in macromolecular chemistry both relations are TAD/TC/WP(2010)9/FINAL 54 contemporaneous; and in basic materials chemistry they are mutually reinforcing. But in practice, when 
collaborative activities leading up to joint patent application is taken into account, such efforts may have a 
positive implication in fostering trade relations. The results point to strong relationship between cross border collaborative networks and trade flows 
within each technology areas, but it does not capture such relationship across different industrial segments. Exporters' patent application is generally positively correlated with trade flows, but statistically 
significant only for basic materials. Importers' patent application is generally negatively correlated with 
trade flows, but statistical significance varies (statistically significant when estimated with  " co-patent 
(lead) " ). Negative impact of tariffs is statistically significant 107 , and the signs of other control variables 
(distance, language and contiguity) are also as expected. The levels of coefficients vary considerably 
across different sub-sectors. (e) References OECD (2009), OECD Patent Statistics Manual, Chapters 5 and 7. Portugal-Perez, Alberto, José-Daniel Reyers and John S. Wilson,  " Beyond the Information Technology

0.030-0.098 for plastics and 0.021-0.059 for basic materials, or one percentage point increase in applied 
tariff is associated with 1.4-9.8 percent decrease in imports. TAD/TC/WP(2010)9/FINAL 55 APPENDIX 3. TRADE, TARIFFS AND R&D (a) The Setup To consider the relations between trade, tariff and R&D across countries, variables are all constructed 
in comparative terms: @BULLET EXPORT a = (x as /x a )/(X s /X) (i.e. revealed comparative advantage (RCA)) @BULLET IMPORT a =(m as /m a )(M s /M) @BULLET R&D a = (r as /r a )/(R s /R) @BULLET TARIFF a = (t as /t a )/(T s /T) X, M and R are OECD total of exports, imports and R&D spending, T is OECD average tariff, x a , m a 
and r a are exports, imports and R&D spending and t is the average tariff for country a, all with respect to 
year t (subscript suppressed above). Subscript s shows the industrial sector. With these variables, two types of estimation are carried out: (i) R&D and Trade

(a: p<0.01, b: 0.01<p<0.05, c: 0.05<p<0.10) (d) Observations (i) R&D and Trade R&D is positively associated with exports in all manufacturing sectors, both in the 1990s and 2000s. 
It was the case with chemicals, but it is not statistically significant in the 2000s. R&D is positively associated with imports in all manufacturing sectors in both periods, but the impact 
is much smaller than with exports. It was positively associated in chemicals in 1990s but not any longer in 
2000s. Other factors than R&D within the chemicals sector may have become more important for 
comparative advantage of the chemicals in 2000s. For example, introduction of the fruits of R&D 
generated by other industries and/or from abroad through technology licensing or imports of superior 
capital goods or intermediate goods, rather than domestic R&D within the sector, may have become more 
important. (ii) Trade, R&D and Protection R&D and exports are both negatively associated with tariff levels in all manufacturing sectors. In 
other words, comparative advantage and the underlying R&D capacity are associated with lower tariff 
levels. But if both of them are controlled, R&D tends to lose statistical significance. TAD/TC/WP(2010)9/FINAL 58 In chemicals in 1990s, the signs for R&D and exports were both positive, but they turned negative in 
the 2000s, but without statistical significance. Imports have no statistically significant association with tariff levels in all manufacturing sectors. 
Imports tended to have positive association with tariff levels in chemicals. Positive association between R&D and tariffs may imply a policy to compliment lesser R&D capacity 
by imports, and negative association may imply a policy to protect sectors with lesser R&D capacity. But 
from this simple test of association, clear evidence does not emerge in either direction. TAD/TC/WP(2010)9/FINAL 59 REFERENCES Aggarwal, Vinod K. and Simon J. Evenett (2009),  " Have Long-Established Patterns of Protectionism
