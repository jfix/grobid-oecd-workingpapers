	<div type="abstract">The OECD is a unique forum where the governments of 30 democracies work together to address the<lb/> economic, social and environmental challenges of globalisation. The OECD is also at the forefront of efforts<lb/> to understand and to help governments respond to new developments and concerns, such as corporate<lb/> governance, the information economy and the challenges of an ageing population. The Organisation<lb/> provides a setting where governments can compare policy experiences, seek answers to common<lb/> problems, identify good practice and work to co-ordinate domestic and international policies.<lb/> The OECD member countries are:</div>

	<p type="introduction">The Commission of the European Communities also takes part in the Centre&apos;s Governing Board.<lb/> The Development Centre, whose membership is open to both OECD and non-OECD countries, occupies<lb/> a unique place within the OECD and in the international community. Members finance the Centre and serve<lb/> on its Governing Board, which sets the biennial work programme and oversees its implementation.<lb/> The Centre links OECD members with developing and emerging economies and fosters debate and<lb/> discussion to seek creative policy solutions to emerging global issues and development challenges.<lb/> Participants in Centre events are invited in their personal capacity.<lb/> A small core of staff works with experts and institutions from the OECD and partner countries to fulfil<lb/> the Centre&apos;s work programme. The results are discussed in informal expert and policy dialogue meetings,<lb/> and are published in a range of high-quality products for the research and policy communities. The Centre&apos;s<lb/> Study Series presents in-depth analyses of major development issues. Policy Briefs and Policy Insights<lb/> summarise major conclusions for policy makers; Working Papers deal with the more technical aspects<lb/> of the Centre&apos;s work.<lb/> For an overview of the Centre&apos;s activities, please see www.oecd.org/dev<lb/> Also available in French under the title:<lb/> Fonds de matières premières : comment les améliorer ?<lb/> © OECD 2007<lb/> No reproduction, copy, transmission or translation of this publication may be made without written permission.<lb/> Applications should be sent to OECD Publishing rights@oecd.org or by fax 33 1 45 24 99 30.
