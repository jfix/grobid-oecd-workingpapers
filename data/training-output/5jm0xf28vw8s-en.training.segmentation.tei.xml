However, challenges in spending efficiency, study times, skills demand, inclusiveness <lb/>and quality remain. Also, learning outcomes could improve further. Moreover, few Norwegian universities rank <lb/>high in international comparisons on the basis of research-related and other indicators, and spending per student <lb/>or GDP is relatively high. Many small institutions, aiming to meet regional needs, do not reach critical mass in <lb/>staff and student numbers. Many students take considerable time to finish their studies despite financial <lb/>incentives, and students from lower income groups have low tertiary participation and completion rates despite <lb/>a strong focus on inclusiveness. Enrolments remain low in fields such as science and engineering, although they <lb/>have increased in recent years, and supply shortages in some professional areas indicate room for improvement. <lb/>Better incentives for both students and institutions to ensure timely completions, with a special emphasis on <lb/>disadvantaged students and labour market needs, a structure that paves the way for adequately sized institutions, <lb/>and effective governance are essential for higher quality education and research. Effective monitoring of the <lb/>outcomes is also vital. The government&apos;s comprehensive quality-enhancing agenda, with a focus on these fronts, <lb/>is welcome. <lb/>This working paper relates to the 2016 OECD Economic Survey of Norway <lb/>(www.oecd.org/eco/surveys/economic-survey-norway.htm). <lb/>JEL Classification: I22; I23; I28 <lb/>Keywords: Accreditation, completion, education, efficiency, funding, higher, incentives, institutions, <lb/>labour, mergers, quality, outcomes, responsiveness, reform, students, tertiary, support <lb/>****************************** <lb/>Relever les défis liés à l&apos;enseignement supérieur en Norvège <lb/>En Norvège, le système d&apos;enseignement supérieur, essentiellement public et sans frais de scolarité, <lb/>encourage la participation, et les taux de réussite y sont élevés. Toutefois, des difficultés subsistent en termes <lb/>d&apos;efficience des dépenses, de durée des études, de demande de compétences, d&apos;inclusivité et de qualité. De plus, <lb/>les retombées de l&apos;enseignement pourraient être encore améliorées. En outre, peu d&apos;universités norvégiennes <lb/>figurent dans le haut des classements internationaux établis à partir d&apos;indicateurs fondés sur les recherches ou <lb/>autres, et les dépenses par étudiant ou par rapport au PIB sont relativement élevées. Beaucoup d&apos;établissements <lb/>de taille modeste ayant vocation à répondre à des besoins régionaux n&apos;atteignent pas la masse critique en termes <lb/>d&apos;effectifs et de nombre d&apos;étudiants. Nombre d&apos;étudiants mettent énormément de temps à finir leurs études, <lb/>malgré les incitations financières, et les étudiants issus de groupes à faible revenu sont peu nombreux à <lb/>fréquenter l&apos;enseignement supérieur et leur taux de réussite est faible, malgré la priorité donnée à l&apos;inclusivité. <lb/>Même s&apos;ils ont augmenté au cours des dernières années, les effectifs restent faibles dans des domaines comme <lb/>la science et l&apos;ingénierie, et les pénuries d&apos;offre dans certains domaines professionnels sont le signe qu&apos;une <lb/>marge d&apos;amélioration existe. Pour améliorer la qualité de l&apos;enseignement et de la recherche, il est essentiel <lb/>d&apos;instaurer, en direction des étudiants comme des établissements, de meilleures incitations afin de garantir un <lb/>achèvement des cycles d&apos;études dans des délais convenables, en mettant tout particulièrement l&apos;accent sur les <lb/>étudiants défavorisés et les besoins du marché du travail, de mettre en place une structure propre à favoriser <lb/>l&apos;émergence d&apos;établissements ayant une taille adéquate et de prévoir une gouvernance efficace. Assurer un suivi <lb/>efficace des résultats est également indispensable. Le vaste programme d&apos;amélioration de la qualité adopté par <lb/>le gouvernement, qui met l&apos;accent sur tous ces points, est le bienvenu. <lb/>Ce Document de travail se rapporte à l&apos;Étude économique de l&apos;OCDE de la Norvège 2015 <lb/>(www.oecd.org/fr/eco/etudes/etude-economique-norvege.htm). <lb/>Classification JEL: I22; I23; I28 <lb/>Mots-clés: Accréditation, achèvement, éducation, efficience, finanement, plus élevé, incitations, <lb/>institutions, main-d&apos;oeuvre, fusions, qualité, résultats, réactivité, réforme, étudiants, tertiaire, soutien <lb/>ECO/WKP(2016)9 <lb/></front>

			<body>ADDRESSING THE CHALLENGES <lb/>IN HIGHER EDUCATION IN NORWAY <lb/>By Vassiliki Koustogeogopoulou 1 <lb/>Competitiveness in a high-income, high-cost country such as Norway requires a highly skilled and <lb/>adaptable labour force. Access to higher education is also an important avenue for greater inclusiveness <lb/>and wellbeing. High quality tertiary education is of major importance for both economic and social goals. <lb/>Best practice for tertiary education is difficult to define, as the socio-economic and educational structure <lb/>and traditions differ across countries. However, the key challenges for a well-functioning tertiary system <lb/>are broadly the same. The OECD report on Tertiary Education for the Knowledge Society highlights the <lb/>need for responsive institutional governance, an efficient use of public funds, an effective quality assurance <lb/>system, and for polices that promote quality and research excellence (Santiago et al., 2008). Equity in <lb/>tertiary education through equality of opportunities and improvements in participation of the least <lb/>represented groups add to these policy objectives. <lb/>Norway&apos;s tertiary education system is well-run overall, with a strong commitment to inclusiveness <lb/>and equity and an emphasis on quality. Students face low barriers to participation and attainment rates are <lb/>well above the OECD average. Moreover, research activity has risen rapidly. The system also matches <lb/>relatively well the demand and supply of tertiary graduates. At the same time, weaknesses in learning <lb/>outcomes (reported in some surveys), relatively low completion rates and long duration of studies, a fairly <lb/>dispersed structure, fewer internationally top-ranking universities than in Nordic peers, and the relatively <lb/>high costs of the system in terms of spending per student or share of GDP, point to potential efficiency and <lb/>quality issues. <lb/>The paper discusses these challenges, and lays out options for improvement. It is important to connect <lb/>closely investment in higher education with outcomes, ensuring high quality. An important challenge in <lb/>structural reform is to resolve tensions between quality (and efficiency) objectives and the maintenance of <lb/>a substantial network of regional tertiary-education providers, many of which are small scale. The analysis <lb/>focuses on issues pertaining to higher education only, given the difference in nature and the small size of <lb/>the still developing vocational sector. <lb/>1 Vassiliki Koustogeogopoulou is Economist on the Australia/Norway Desk in the Economics Department of OECD. This paper is <lb/>based on Chapter 1 of the 2016 OECD Economic Survey of Norway, published in January 2016 under the authority of the <lb/>Economic and Development Review Committee (EDRC). The author would like to thank Álvaro Pereira, Robert Ford, Piritta <lb/>Sorsa, Philip Hemmings and colleagues from the Education and other OECD Departments for valuable comments on earlier drafts. <lb/>The report also benefited from comments from the Norwegian authorities.

			<body>The Norwegian tertiary education system: Key features and challenges <lb/>A primarily public system with comparatively high spending <lb/>The Norwegian tertiary education system is predominately public; 96% of spending on educational <lb/>institutions comes from public sources compared to 70%, on average, across OECD countries (Figure 1, <lb/>Panel A; Box 1). This reflects a strong view that education should be accessible for all, in line with the <lb/> &quot; welfare society &quot; model characterising the Nordic countries (Ahola et al., 2014). There are no tuition fees <lb/>at public institutions (these cater for over 85% of all students) in Norway and a financial support system <lb/>for living expenses is available, where all students are eligible for assistance. Public provision also reflects <lb/>the emphasis on regional considerations. <lb/>Spending on tertiary education is comparatively high both in terms of annual expenditure per student <lb/>and as a share of GDP (Figure 1, Panels B and C). The difference in total public tertiary expenditure <lb/>vis-a-vis other countries is largely due to subsidies for living costs (scholarships and grants to <lb/>students/households and student loans), amounting to around 1% of GDP (well above the OECD average) <lb/>(Figure 1, Panel B). Norway spends in total, as a share of mainland GDP, almost twice the OECD average, <lb/>and somewhat more than the other Nordic countries (Figure 1, Panel B). Inclusion of the offshore sector <lb/>lowers Norway&apos;s total tertiary expenditure as a share of GDP, though it remains relatively high in <lb/>international comparison. <lb/>The structure of provision is fairly decentralised, creating inefficiencies and impairing quality <lb/>As of 2015, tertiary education in Norway was provided by 53 higher education institutions <lb/>(universities, specialised universities and university-colleges), owned or funded by the government <lb/>(Figure 2, Panel A) (Box 1), and over a hundred post-secondary/tertiary vocational institutions (fagskoler), <lb/>offering shorter (up to two years) vocational training courses. In January 2016 some mergers have reduced <lb/>the number of higher education institutions (see below). Universities and university-colleges are the two <lb/>largest parts of the system. The post-secondary/tertiary vocational sector is still limited with about 16 000 <lb/>students in 2013 (SSB, 2015a). <lb/>Higher education institutions are dispersed throughout the country and many of them are small. About <lb/>half of the 53 higher education institutions have less than 2000 students and around one-fifth of them less <lb/>than 250 (Figure 2, Panel B). This fairly decentralised institutional structure largely reflects Norway&apos;s <lb/>strong commitment to supporting regional economies. Indeed, tertiary education policy was traditionally <lb/>related closely to the broader policy objective of preserving the spatial distribution pattern of population <lb/>(NMER, 2005). The geographical diffusion of higher education institutions is aimed at increasing tertiary <lb/>participation in non-urban areas and reducing the &quot; brain drain &quot; towards the larger regions, such as Oslo <lb/>and Akershus, and also to alleviate the pressure on the traditional universities (OECD, 2009a). <lb/></body>

			<body>Box 1. Higher education in Norway: Main features <lb/>The higher education sector in Norway is governed by the Act for Universities and University-Colleges, which <lb/>since 2005, covers both public and private institutions (Reichert and Ekholm, 2009). The Ministry of Education and <lb/>Research has the overall responsibility for the sector, including funding (NOKUT, 2013a). Public (state) institutions do <lb/>not charge fees for students, apart from those students who are not on a programme that leads to a degree or a <lb/>vocational diploma, as for example is the case of continuing education courses. Private institutions can demand fees <lb/>from students for all types of education, even when they receive state funding; but the fees must be used to the benefit <lb/>of the students. Students in public and private institutions may apply for loans to cover the costs of living, and also that <lb/>of fees in the latter case. <lb/>The higher education sector principally consists of the following types of institutions: the universities (all of which <lb/>are state-owned), specialised universities (public or private) and the university-colleges (public or private). The <lb/>university-colleges were first formed in 1994 with the merger of 98 regional colleges into 26 new institutions. Since the <lb/>early 2000s the number of universities has doubled from 4 to 8 (NOKUT, 2013b). Three of the four new institutions are <lb/>the result of university-colleges have been upgraded to university status and are often referred to as the &quot; new <lb/>universities &quot; . <lb/>In terms of programmes provided, universities offer extended education in areas such as medicine and law and <lb/>other programmes at an undergraduate level or above, while the university-colleges provide mainly courses with <lb/>professional orientation such as teacher training, nursing, engineering, and social work. Overall, universities are more <lb/>research-oriented than the university-colleges, the latter traditionally concentrating more on teaching <lb/>(Hovdhaugen, 2013). However, as described in the main text this distinction is narrowing; several university-colleges <lb/>offer master&apos;s programmes and some also have the right to award doctoral degrees. <lb/>Admission to higher education is based on successful completion of upper secondary education with some <lb/>specified courses (leading to the Higher Education Entrance Qualification); some study fields have additional entrance <lb/>requirements (NOKUT, 2013a). Admission is based, in particular, on a mix of course grades and grades from exams <lb/>which are uniform across the country. Students who have completed upper secondary vocational training and two years <lb/>tertiary vocational education can also be admitted to higher education, conditional on meeting certain Norwegian-<lb/>language requirements. In addition, applicants who are 25 years old or more and do not fill the usual formal <lb/>requirements can be accepted for certain study programmes on an individual assessment based on formal and informal <lb/>skills. <lb/>Completed higher education courses are measured in credits ( &quot; studiepoeng &quot; ) that comply with European Credit <lb/>Transfer System Standard (ECTS). The full-time workload for one academic year is 60 credits (NOKUT, 2013a). <lb/>A comprehensive reform in higher education 2002, known as the &quot; Quality Reform &quot; , introduced a new degree <lb/>structure (3-year bachelor&apos;s degree, 2-year master&apos;s degree and 3-year doctoral degree), a grading system and a <lb/>quality assurance system in line with the Bologna process (NMER, 2007). The new degree structure was implemented <lb/>for most of the programmes (EC, 2015). The 2002 reform also introduced new teaching and evaluation methods. The <lb/>Norwegian Agency of Quality Assurance (NOKUT), in operation since the early 2000s, is currently responsible for <lb/>monitoring quality in the sector (see below). The Quality Reform&apos;s measures also included a new governance regime, <lb/>that provided increased independence for institutions, and a performance-based funding system in education and <lb/>research (see below) (PC, 2015). <lb/>Scale of operation plays an important role in the quality and efficiency of education, according to <lb/>OECD Tertiary Education for the Knowledge Society (Santiago et al., 2008). Although there is no optimal <lb/>size, an important challenge is to ensure that institutions are of a sufficient size to promote regional <lb/>development, and more generally, the quality of tertiary education system. Norway&apos;s many small academic <lb/>environments and scattered education programmes raise important issues in this regard. A recent White <lb/>Paper on the structure of higher education highlights a number of limitations (Government of Norway, <lb/>2015a). Some institutions, in particular, have difficulties in attracting both staff and students, resulting in <lb/>underutilisation of campus facilities and producing only few graduates and little research (Government of <lb/>Norway, 2015a; Myklebust, 2015). <lb/>ECO/WKP(2016)9 <lb/></body>

A minimum number of students for courses is often considered as a <lb/>prerequisite for helping cost-effectiveness, as well as for broader curriculums and better quality of <lb/>programmes and student services, although a simple causal relationship is difficult to establish <lb/>(OECD, 2009b; Vabø and Kårstein, 2014; Government of Norway, 2015a). The government considers <lb/>that, as a general rule, it is not appropriate that fewer than 20 students are enrolled in any given course. <lb/>Figure 3.

			<body>The White Paper on the structure of higher education concludes also that smaller institutions suffer <lb/>particularly from a lack of senior academic staff (i.e. professors, senior lecturers, professors and associate <lb/>professors) (Government of Norway, 2015a). Overall, around 46% of employees in the university-college <lb/>sector hold a doctoral degree, or have comparable academic qualification, on the basis of official data. This <lb/>is not necessarily a problem, what matters is whether the teaching and learning experiences are of high <lb/>quality. In this context, a national student survey of higher education (Studiebarometeret) reveals low <lb/>levels of satisfaction with regard to teachers&apos; feedback and individual counselling (Figure 4, Panel A) <lb/>-both of great importance to acquisition of skills and knowledge (Hamberg, et al., 2015). In addition, the <lb/>findings reveal relatively low scores in some critical areas which serve as proxies for learning outcomes, <lb/>such as indicators of experience with research and development of work and measures of innovative <lb/>thinking, suggesting scope for improvement (NOKUT, 2015) (Figure 4, Panel B). Moreover, the OECD&apos;s <lb/>Survey of Adult Skills (a product of the OECD Programme for the International Assessment of Adult <lb/>Competencies – PIAAC) shows that around 10% of 20-34 year old tertiary graduates in Norway attain only <lb/>low levels of literacy (level 2 or below) (Figure 5). While this finding may also reflect, among other things, <lb/>shortfalls at earlier stages of education, and Norway fares better in the PIAAC survey than the OECD <lb/>average (Figure 5), it is still worrying. <lb/>Figure 4.

Many of the evaluations highlight the importance of a &quot; critical mass &quot; in <lb/>research. This assessment is backed up by the Research Council of Norway (RCN) which also notes that <lb/>most of the successful research units in areas such as biology and medicine are typically large, and flags <lb/>concerns that the research landscape is &quot; far too often &quot; fragmented (RCN, 2011). Furthermore, international <lb/>evidence also points to links between research quality and the size of the research group (Kenna and <lb/>Berche, 2011a, 2011b). The &quot; critical mass &quot; (broadly defined as the minimum size for a research group to <lb/>be viable in the longer term) varies substantially across subject areas. Once the critical mass is achieved, a <lb/>research team has increased opportunities for intra-group interactions which, according to Kenna and <lb/>Berche (2011a, 2011b), is a key driver of group quality. There is also a higher value ( &quot; upper critical <lb/>mass &quot; ), also discipline dependent, beyond which the link between research quality and group size weakens <lb/>(or even disappears) (Kenna and Berche, 2011a, 2011b). <lb/>In addition, many institutions have limited ability to tap into external funding (Government of <lb/>Norway, 2015a). For example, only about 20% of Norwegian tenured faculty apply for funding from the <lb/>Research Council of Norway (Benner and Öquist, 2014). In general, Norwegian higher education <lb/>institutions are less successful than similar institutions in other Nordic countries in the competition for <lb/>funding from EU programmes (NMER, 2014). In addition, many institutions have a relatively low overall <lb/>participation in international network co-operations (Government of Norway, 2015a). Despite a rapid rise <lb/>in research activity over the past decade or so, Norway still ranks below the other Nordic countries in terms <lb/>of some key research indicators (see below). <lb/>Reforms underway to restructure the higher education sector (see below) aim to overcome these <lb/>difficulties, and improve quality, while maintaining accessibility throughout the country. <lb/>0 <lb/>5 <lb/>10 <lb/>15 <lb/>20 <lb/>25 <lb/>30 <lb/>35 <lb/>0 <lb/>5 <lb/>10 <lb/>15 <lb/>20 <lb/>25 <lb/>30 <lb/>35 <lb/></body>

			<body>A more integrated system has blurred distinction between institutions <lb/>Norway&apos;s tertiary education system is more &quot; integrated &quot; compared, for instance, to those in Denmark <lb/>and Finland (Ahola et al., 2014). There are few barriers to the recognition of credits and study programmes <lb/>between higher education institutions (universities and university-colleges), enabling students to combine <lb/>courses and institutions and transfer between them. It is also possible for students who have achieved a <lb/>two-year vocational tertiary education to automatically access higher education in academic tracks <lb/>(see Box 1). Integration of the two types of higher education institutions has been a policy goal over an <lb/>extended period (OECD, 2009a). This is reflected, for example, in the adoption in 1981 of a flexible credit <lb/>transfer system, entitling college graduates to further their education at the university level, and the <lb/>inclusion in mid-1990s of state university-colleges under the same act as universities (Act for Universities <lb/>and University-Colleges), providing a common framework for the organisation and governance of these <lb/>institutions (Kyvik, 2009). <lb/>Increased integration, however, has blurred the boundaries between universities and <lb/>university-colleges, raising concerns about the diversity, and potentially quality, of the sector <lb/>(OECD, 2012a). Common rules and regulation for the higher education sector, for instance, under the Act <lb/>for Universities and University-Colleges (Box 1), facilitated student mobility but also increased <lb/>standardisation across the two sub-sectors (Maassen, et al., 2011). University-college sector curricula had <lb/>to adapt to meet the formal requirements for transferability and recognition by the universities, weakening <lb/>the distinctive role of university-college sector as a more practically-oriented type of tertiary education <lb/>(OECD, 2012a). <lb/>The divide between universities and university-colleges has also become blurred following the <lb/>introduction of institutional accreditation in 2002 (under the &quot; Quality Reform &quot; in higher education, see <lb/>Box 1) which opened up the opportunity for university-colleges to acquire a university status. This has <lb/>resulted in an &quot; academic drift &quot; in the university-college sector, both in terms of programmes at a higher <lb/>level and of institutional hierarchy (NOKUT, 2013b). Four &quot; new &quot; universities have been established <lb/>between 2003 and 2012, three of which being the result of an upgrading in the status of university-colleges <lb/>(Box 1). At the same time, universities have started to offer professionally related courses, besides the <lb/>traditional academic programmes, in order to retain and attract more students (Maassen et al., 2011; <lb/>OECD, 2012a). <lb/>High levels of tertiary attainment in the population and rising research activity <lb/>Norway&apos;s predominately public and tuition-free tertiary education system has encouraged <lb/>participation, resulting in entry rates that are among the highest in OECD (Figure 6, Panel A). Graduation <lb/>rates are above the OECD average, although they still fall behind those in some neighbouring countries <lb/>(Figure 6, Panel B). Norway enjoys a comparatively high level of tertiary attainment. In total, over 40% of <lb/>adults aged 25-65 had completed this level of education in 2014, outperforming many other countries <lb/>(Figure 6, Panels C). This share is higher for younger adults (25-34 years) than their older counterparts <lb/>(55-64 years) and for women than men (Figure 6, Panels C and D). As one might expect, those with <lb/>tertiary education also have high skills: around 30% of tertiary-educated adults (25-64 year) perform at the <lb/>highest levels in literacy proficiency (Level 4 or 5) compared to less than 10% in the case of those with a <lb/>lower level of education (Figure 6, Panel E). <lb/>Developments in research activity are also encouraging. There was a steep rise in research production <lb/>(as measured by publication activity) since 2003, while the total number of research and development <lb/>(R&amp;D) staff in higher education increased by approximately 63% from 2003-2013 (Figure 6, Panel F). <lb/>ECO/WKP(2016)9 <lb/></body>

			<body>But relatively low degree completion rates and long time to completion <lb/>Internationally comparable data on completion rates indicate that Norway is below the OECD average <lb/>(Figure 7).

			<body>Non-completion and late completion of degrees can reflect various factors such as insufficient <lb/>academic preparation prior to enrolment, inadequate career guidance, and a slow study progression <lb/>(Hovdhaugen, 2012; OECD, 2014a; PC, 2015). In Norway&apos;s case, however, a key factor is that the cost of <lb/>trying and failing tertiary education is low because there are no tuition fees and jobs are easy to come by. <lb/>This generates high demand for tertiary education, but means little attention may be paid to completion <lb/>(and perhaps also to the vocational aspect of courses when choosing what to study). Hovdhaugen (2012) <lb/>identifies work commitments as the most common reason for dropping out from tertiary education in <lb/>Norway, which is indicative that the healthy job market is indeed a factor behind non-completion or slow <lb/>study progression. These outcomes are not necessarily negative as they can reflect students successfully <lb/>combining work and study. <lb/>In addition to student incentives, late completions may also reflect the high degree of flexibility of the <lb/>tertiary education sector as this allows for changes in the study programmes and facilitates taking breaks <lb/>( &quot; stop-outs &quot; ) in studies (NMER, 2005). Available data (Eurostudent IV) show, for instance, that more than <lb/>one in 10 students in Norway had an interruption of longer than one year during their studies, exceeding <lb/>the corresponding shares in other Nordic countries (Orr et al., 2011). A flexible system can have several <lb/>advantages, notably giving a student the opportunity to make another choice along the way and consider an <lb/>alternative study programme that is more in line with his/her interests. There are challenges to completion, <lb/>however, as students are more likely to drop out the longer they take to finish their studies <lb/>(Hovdhaugen, 2012). In Norway, students are typically somewhat older, not only when they graduate, but <lb/>also when they commence their studies. The latter arises because many young Norwegians take a period <lb/>off from study after they finish upper secondary school in order to travel or work, for example <lb/>(OECD, 2009a). Half of the Norwegian tertiary education students are aged 25 years and over. Older <lb/>students may take more time to complete their studies, as they usually organise them according to their <lb/>work schedule and financial constraints (Orr et al., 2011). <lb/>Some caveats on the completion figures are important to consider. Some of the students who have not <lb/>graduated may be still enrolled, or may have finished their education at a different institution than the one <lb/>they started at. This is especially the case in tertiary education systems with flexible structures as in the <lb/>Norwegian one, where transfers are common (Hovdhaugen, 2009, 2011, 2013). Still, non-completions <lb/>raise efficiency and quality concerns as they can represent a waste of financial and human resources <lb/>(Tremblay et al., 2012). The long time to completion heightens these concerns. Late completions are an <lb/>important factor for drop outs in Norway (Hovdhaugen, 2012). OECD estimates suggest large gains in <lb/>terms of graduation rates from an increase in Norway&apos;s completion rates to best international level <lb/>(Figure 9). <lb/>ECO/WKP(2016)9 <lb/></body>

While complete removal of these influences is practically impossible, disadvantages <lb/>and gaps generated by socio-economic background need to be eroded further. Data from Statistics Norway <lb/>suggest for instance that in 2014, 60% of 19-24 year olds with at least one parent having more than four <lb/>years of tertiary education entered tertiary education, compared to slightly over 16% among those whose <lb/>parents only have compulsory education (Figure 10, Panel A). This disparity has been declining over time, <lb/>especially for women, but is still very large (Figure 10, Panels A and B). International comparisons also <lb/>indicate relative large differences in tertiary participation according to parents&apos; educational attainment <lb/>(Figure 10, Panel C). The immigration status of students also appears to influence tertiary participation, <lb/>according to the data from Statistics Norway for the 19-24 year-old cohort, especially in the case of women <lb/>(Figure 10, Panel D). The difference in attendance rates between first generation immigrants and students <lb/>without an immigrant background stands for young women at over 20 percentage points, compared to <lb/>15 percentage points for young men. It is worth noting that second generation immigrants is the group with <lb/>the highest participation, and this applies for both genders. <lb/>0 <lb/>10 <lb/>20 <lb/>30 <lb/>40 <lb/>50 <lb/>60 <lb/>70 <lb/>80 <lb/>90 <lb/>100 <lb/>0 <lb/>10 <lb/>20 <lb/>30 <lb/>40 <lb/>50 <lb/>60 <lb/>70 <lb/>80 <lb/>90 <lb/>100 <lb/>POL <lb/>SWE <lb/>NZL <lb/>NOR <lb/>GBR <lb/>SVK <lb/>DNK <lb/>FIN <lb/>AUS <lb/>USA <lb/>ISR <lb/>PRT <lb/>NLD <lb/>HUN <lb/>OECD <lb/>CZE <lb/>AUT <lb/>JPN <lb/>DEU <lb/>ESP <lb/>MEX <lb/>TUR <lb/>% <lb/>Estimated graduation rates for a 91% level of completion rates <lb/>Graduation rates² <lb/>ECO/WKP(2016)9 <lb/></body>

			<body>Completion rates also differ according to students&apos; educational background, with students from well-<lb/>educated families performing comparatively well. Indicatively, of the new students in 2006 whose parents <lb/>were highly educated (more than four years of tertiary education), around 80% had completed their studies <lb/>after 8 years, against 45% of students whose parents only had compulsory education (Figure 10, Panel E). <lb/>Interesting this discrepancy has fallen in recent years for men but increased for women (Figure 10, <lb/>Panel F). A recent study further points to social differences with regard to the type of study, with students <lb/>from less educated families being more likely to attend professional three-year programmes rather than <lb/>longer ones (Hovdhaugen, 2013). To the extent that such programmes enable students from less educated <lb/>backgrounds to make a smooth transition into a good quality jobs and careers, however, this should not be <lb/>a concern. <lb/>Access and success in tertiary education can also be influenced by student&apos;s early schooling <lb/>(OECD, 2014a). Recent results from national tests indicate, for instance, that students whose parents do not <lb/>have tertiary education achieve lower average scores in both reading and mathematics compared to their <lb/>peers whose parents are highly educated (Figure 11). This highlights the importance of addressing <lb/>inequalities in learning opportunities at the earliest stages of schooling. <lb/>Figure 11.

			<body>Responsiveness of the system to future labour-market demand is a challenge <lb/>Overall, the supply of tertiary graduates in Norway has developed broadly in line with demand from <lb/>the labour market (Cappelen et al., 2013). However, supply shortages for some oil-related positions, in <lb/>particular engineers, have long been an issue (PC, 2015). Company survey data show, for example, that <lb/>in 2010 there was an unmet demand of about 9 500 workers with engineering and science degrees <lb/>(Cappelen et al., 2013). The problem has since been reduced by a supply response in terms of engineering <lb/>graduates (see discussion below). The current slowdown in oil investments has also lessened the scale of <lb/>supply shortages. If current trends continue, there may be a more balanced growth (and even a small <lb/>surplus) in the years to come between the demand and supply of engineers and people with backgrounds in <lb/>science, according to long term skills projections of the Statistics Norway (SSB, 2013, 2014) (Figure 12, <lb/>Panel A). <lb/>However, according to these projections, which should be interpreted with caution given their <lb/>sensitivity to changes in underlying assumptions, the supply of graduates in the fields of economics <lb/>and administration and social sciences and law is set to overshoot in the next decade or so <lb/>(Figure 12, Panels B and C), but to undershoot in some of the more &quot; practical &quot; courses, namely, teachers <lb/>and nurses (Figure 12, Panels D and E) (SSB, 2013, 2014). The long term skills projections also indicate a <lb/>shortage as well of workers with upper secondary vocational education, probably due to the low <lb/>completion rates, as discussed in previous Surveys (OECD, 2008a, 2014b) (Figure 12, Panel F). <lb/>There has been a promising upward trend in enrolment in STEM fields (science, technology, <lb/>engineering and maths), which are important for driving innovation (Figure 13, Panel A). A comparatively <lb/>strong labour market in recent years for those with quantitative skills in Norway, along with reforms to <lb/>boost STEM fields, partly explains this upward trend. Such reforms include an increase in higher education <lb/>places on maths, science and technology, a new framework for engineering education, and a write off of <lb/>teachers&apos; student loans if they have an advanced degree in subjects like maths (Government of Norway, <lb/>2015b). Despite this progress, more efforts may be needed to boost STEM enrolment as Norway is still <lb/>below the OECD average (Figure 13, Panel B). Demand for these skills is expected to increase in the years <lb/>ahead (OECD 2008a, 2014c). In addition, there are complications in using long-run projections for <lb/>assessment. Figure 12 (Panel A) suggests that, as a whole, there will be an excess supply of scientists and <lb/>engineers. However, this largely reflects assumptions in the projection about shrinkage of the oil sector and <lb/>corresponding fall in demand of oil-related STEM professions. At the same time, care is needed in <lb/>developing STEM-related policies. Disaggregated data show quite different labour market outcomes across <lb/>STEM disciplines, which vary over time (Figure 14). Also, signals from the data can be mixed. For <lb/>instance, recent business and graduate surveys reveal that employers claim for sizeable shortages in certain <lb/>skills, such as information and communication technology (ICT), even where there is a relatively high <lb/>unemployment rate among graduates in these fields (Figure 14). <lb/>ECO/WKP(2016)9 <lb/></body>

			<body>Addressing skills shortages, wherever they arise, is important for Norway&apos;s ability to be <lb/>internationally competitive. A weak response of skills development to labour-market demand can reflect a <lb/>number of interrelated factors. It may be the case, for example, as noted in the OECD Skills Strategy <lb/>Diagnostic Report for Norway (OECD, 2014c), that students&apos; attention to the job-market &quot; pay-off &quot; in <lb/>choosing courses is weakened because they do not have to fund their own studies, although the recent <lb/>increase in STEM provides some encouraging signs in this regard (OECD, 2014c). But other factors, such <lb/>as inadequate career services and/or weak market signals due to low unemployment and compressed wage <lb/>distribution in Norway, may also contribute. Beyond these possible reasons, however, it may also be the <lb/>case that the consumption-good aspect of tertiary education (enjoyment of study and learning) is a <lb/>comparatively big driver of tertiary education choices for Norwegian students compared with the <lb/>investment-good dimension. <lb/>International academic credentials are relatively low <lb/>Norway has fewer universities than its Nordic neighbours in a ranking of top universities on the basis <lb/>of research-related indicators and other indicators, such as the degree of internationalisation of higher <lb/>education institutions and their ability to transfer knowledge to, and attract funding from, the business <lb/>sector (Figure 15, Panels A to D). <lb/>Measures of research quality, such as the European Commission index of research excellence (which <lb/>covers the quality of scientific production as well as technological development) and average cited <lb/>publications, place Norway above EU average but still below its Nordic peers (Figure 15, Panel E). In <lb/>addition, high-impact research, as defined by the share of national publications in a field that are in the <lb/>field&apos;s 10% most cited publications globally, is relatively low compared to neighbouring countries <lb/>Figure 15, Panel E). Norway&apos;s research ranking is the result of multiple factors. A recent analysis of the <lb/>Norwegian university research environments by the Research Council Norway (RCN), for instance, <lb/>cites inward looking leadership, relatively few international recruitments, administrative barriers, the <lb/>extensive teaching tasks in faculties and the predominance of small research groups with limited external <lb/>funding among the factors that can be impeding high-impact research (Benner and Öquist, 2014). <lb/>The report further highlights the importance of a rigorous scientific quality control of sectoral projects. <lb/>ECO/WKP(2016)9 <lb/></body>

			<body>Promoting efficiency and quality in higher education <lb/>Plans to merge institutions are a positive step <lb/>The Norwegian authorities aim to deal with the quality challenges arising from the many small <lb/>academic environments and scattered education programmes. This is to be achieved by reforming the <lb/>structure of higher education institutions by merging a number of institutions and other measures such as <lb/>reforms in the funding system and stricter accreditation requirements (discussed further below). As of <lb/>January 2016, the total number of higher education institutions has been reduced from 53 to 42. Further <lb/>merging initiatives are under consideration (Government of Norway, 2015a). The first wave of merger <lb/>proposals was initiated by the institutions themselves, though with input and encouragement from the <lb/>government (which also ultimately approves the proposed mergers) in the form of assessment of the <lb/>strength of institutions using a range of quality criteria, including the number of applicants, completions <lb/>and publications. The government has signalled that institutions standing alone after a first round of <lb/>mergers could be reassessed and ultimately merged in a government-driven process. The process underway <lb/>mainly concerns university-colleges merging with universities or other university-colleges (Government of <lb/>Norway, 2015a). Overall, the merging process will result in a significant remapping and re-organisation of <lb/>the higher education sector, and in a reduced number of institutions. <lb/>These mergers echo previous developments in Norway and also in a number of other countries. For <lb/>instance, mergers have featured in tertiary education reform in the other Nordic countries as well as <lb/>Australia, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom (Kyvik and Stensaker, 2013) (Box 2). However, it <lb/>seems that there is not a definitive answer when it comes to the outcomes of mergers (Box 2). <lb/>Ensuring good conditions for successful mergers is important. Good outcomes in the merger process <lb/>will require, on the basis of the international experience, careful selection of partners, adequate and <lb/>sufficiently flexible financial support during the merging process, and an effective management and <lb/>leadership (Box 2). It is welcome, in this context, that the merging process currently underway in Norway <lb/>is based on concrete performance criteria, as described above. <lb/>The financial support to be provided to the merging institutions is also welcome. The upfront costs of <lb/>mergers, including those for upskilling staff and organisational changes, usually tend to be substantial, <lb/>while any financial benefits tend to be long term (Skodvin 2014; Finnegan, 2015). All the institutions <lb/>involved in the merging process are provided with additional support from the government. Sufficient <lb/>financial flexibility is very important given that the mergers differ in nature and size (Skodvin, 2014). <lb/>Closely monitoring the outcomes of the merging process is essential given mixed experiences <lb/>(Skodvin, 1999, 2014 and Box 2). To meet its objective, the reform should pave the wave for more <lb/>high-profile institutions with better access to research facilities and more efficient and better quality <lb/>tertiary education outcomes. More solid higher education institutions will be also better prepared to cater <lb/>for regional needs and development. <lb/></body>

			<body>Box 2. Mergers: International trends and experiences <lb/>Mergers among higher education institutions have been common in OECD countries in recent decades. Indeed, <lb/>Norway itself saw a significant wave of mergers in 1994, when 98 colleges that offered mainly professional <lb/>programmes (for example, teaching and nurse training and general engineering) were consolidated into 26 state <lb/>university-colleges (Kyvik and Stensaker, 2013). Furthermore, since the early 2000s university-colleges have opted <lb/>(voluntarily) for a university status that also involved mergers (NOKUT, 2013b). Other countries have also experienced <lb/>important merging processes. In Denmark, for instance, mergers in 2007 saw 13 government research institutions and <lb/>12 universities merged, respectively, into 3 government research institutions and 8 universities. Furthermore, in 2008, <lb/>the 22 Centres for Further Education were merged into 8 Regional University-Colleges (Amaral, 2009; Finnegan, <lb/>2015). In the Netherlands, reforms have seen mergers between research-intensive universities and universities of <lb/>applied science (Santiago, et al., 2008). In Finland, Aalto University was created in 2010 as a merger of three <lb/>universities and aimed to foster multi-disciplinary education and research in the fields of science, economics and art <lb/>and design. Australia and the United Kingdom have also used mergers in major restructuring efforts to build larger and <lb/>more comprehensive institutions (Santiago, et al., 2008). Furthermore, there has been a wide variety of international <lb/>collaborations and arrangements between universities across borders with the aim to strengthen performance and add <lb/>economies of scale in teaching and research. <lb/>Mergers vary in character. They can take place between institutions of a comparable or different size; and <lb/>between institutions with similar or complementary profiles and/or statuses (Pruvot et al., 2015). Governments used <lb/>(and still use) mergers for a variety of reasons, for instance, to address low efficiency and quality, and overcome <lb/>problems of institutional fragmentation (Harman and Harman, 2003). Institutions themselves also initiate mergers to <lb/>address financial problems or for more strategic reasons, such as to strengthen the institution&apos;s position at the national <lb/>and international context (Skodvin, 2014). <lb/>In general, according to Skodvin (2014), the merging process is expected to result in: &quot; administrative &quot; benefits <lb/>(for example, savings with regard to human resources due to economies of scale and a more professional and efficient <lb/>administration); &quot; economic &quot; benefits (save money); as well as, &quot; academic &quot; benefits, including eliminating duplicative <lb/>programmes, strengthening research and teaching, increasing academic collaboration/integration, and diversifying <lb/>academic profiles. Potentially, there are strong technical synergies to be gained from mergers derived, for example, <lb/>from the pooling of academic talent, greater staffing/and or financial resources and better access to scientific <lb/>equipment, which can help raise the quality of education and research (Government of Norway, 2015a; Pruvot et al., <lb/>2015). <lb/>However, evidence on the outcomes of mergers is unclear (Goreham, 2011). Empirical studies show that <lb/>experiences with mergers in Norway and several other countries are &quot; quite mixed &quot; , and this finding refers not only to <lb/>their intended economic and administrative benefits, but also intended improvements in the quality of higher education <lb/>and research (Skodvin 1999, 2014) – which is a central aim of the Norwegian reform. Overall, mergers are complex, <lb/>resource-intensive, and time consuming processes which require a number of pre-conditions to succeed. While there <lb/>is no single solution for all merger cases, cross-country experience could be helpful in this regard. <lb/>Some lessons learned from international experience <lb/>International experience suggests that the approach taken to process in institutional mergers has a significant <lb/>bearing on their success, in particular: <lb/>Planning and design <lb/> The motives and objectives of mergers need to be stated with clarity and be, generally, valid and accompanied <lb/>by a detailed planning of the process (Melin et al., 2013; Skodvin, 2014). Inter alia, this helps keep up reform <lb/>momentum. <lb/> Voluntary mergers generally work better than the compulsory ones, often initiated by external threats (for <lb/>example, those related to falling student demand and competition), or some degree of government incentive, <lb/>pressure, or direction (Harman and Harman, 2003). Ideally all institutions involved in merger negotiations <lb/>should have some gains from the process. <lb/> Where merging institutions have complementary missions and cultures, the chances for succeeding are far <lb/>greater (Skodvin, 2014). <lb/> Geographical proximity remains important despite advances in communication technology. International <lb/>experience suggests that most successful mergers took place between institutions which were physically not far <lb/>from each other, or in the same place (Skodvin, 1999). <lb/>(continued) <lb/></body>

			<body>Box 2-Mergers: International trends and experiences (cont.) <lb/>Effective implementation <lb/> Strong management and leadership are key for effective implementation of merger plans and help reducing <lb/>the uncertainty and stresses on staff and systems that accompany mergers (Skodvin, 2014). Key <lb/>management staff should be appointed at the early stage of the process to increase effectiveness (Melin <lb/>et al., 2013). <lb/> Involvement of the staff, and students, is of great importance for the merging process, helping to boost <lb/>internal support and willingness to co-operate (Melin et al., 2013). <lb/> Mergers work best if the participating institutions can move quickly (Harman and Harman, 2003). A certain <lb/>pace is essential to maintain momentum (Melin et al., 2013). <lb/>External funding <lb/> External financial support helps institutions strike merger deals and smooth merger processes. Transition <lb/>costs can be substantial, especially in areas such as harmonising pay and benefit systems, ICT-systems, <lb/>and upskilling of personnel (Skodvin, 1999, 2014; Finnegan, 2015). Financial flexibility and access to <lb/>adequate resources are of major importance during the merging process (Skodvin, 2014). <lb/>Enhancing the effectiveness of governance and leadership <lb/>A new system of institutional governance was introduced in 2003 as part of a wider reform on higher <lb/>education (the &quot; Quality Reform &quot; , see Box 1). The new system gave institutions more autonomy in internal <lb/>organisation and leadership. For instance, it gave greater leeway for providers to appoint management and <lb/>for external representatives on boards (Bleiklie, et al., 2011; Maassen et al., 2011). Institutions can now <lb/>choose between the traditional governance model of an elected rector (who automatically becomes chair of <lb/>the board, and is invariably an existing member of staff) and a model which combines an external chair <lb/>appointed by the Ministry of Education and Research and a rector (who has responsibility for both <lb/>academic and administrative matters) who is appointed by the board. Increased autonomy was <lb/>accompanied by a new funding system and stronger monitoring mechanisms through the establishment of a <lb/>national quality assurance agency (both discussed below). <lb/>Despite these efforts, the system of higher-education governance falls short of the mark on some <lb/>fronts. According to Norway&apos;s Productivity Commission, the system still does not adequately promote <lb/>quality improvement (PC, 2015). In particular, the Commission highlights an apparent inconsistency <lb/>between efforts by government to stimulate competition for students and research funding in tertiary <lb/>education, but meanwhile an absence of mechanisms to bring about closure of weak educational or <lb/>research programmes. There are also concerns about increased bureaucratisation; growth in administrative <lb/>positions has been rapid, typically outpacing increases in teaching and research positions (PC, 2015). <lb/>Potential reasons for this are increased reporting requirements, in tandem with enhanced institutional <lb/>autonomy under the Quality Reform (Box 1), the fast growth of the higher education system and an <lb/>increased scope for externally funded research (PC, 2015; Stensaker, 2015). <lb/>However, neither the governing bodies of educational institutions appear to have made, so far, <lb/>extensive use of the room for strategic manoeuvre offered to them under the Quality Reform, including the <lb/>right to choose a more managerialist internal governance structure. On the basis of available information, <lb/>only half of the institutions appear to have appointed rectors, so far. Still, there seems to be more deep <lb/>changes at lower levels, with the majority of the institutions having introduced appointed leadership at <lb/>faculty and department levels (Bleiklie, et al., 2011). <lb/></body>

			<page>28 <lb/></page>

			<body>The government believes that a management model that combines an external chairman and an <lb/>appointed rector assures the recruitment of the most qualified management team and advocates this as the <lb/>main model for higher education institutions. A proposition that changes the Act on Universities and <lb/>University-Colleges by making appointed leadership the main, but still optional, model for recruitment at <lb/>Norwegian higher education institutions is in the parliamentary process. This move goes into right <lb/>direction. A more managerialist governance structure helps institutions adjust and develop business in a <lb/>reorganised higher-education sector. Moreover, an appointed rather than elected leader may find it easier, <lb/>according to an OECD study, to implement important changes that cut across vested interest, though the <lb/>process of appointment is crucial to ensure leader&apos;s credibility within the institution (OECD, 2003). <lb/>International experience also highlights the importance of strong management and leadership for the <lb/>effective implementation of the merging process, and the need for key management staff to be appointed at <lb/>the early stage of the process (Box 2). Moreover, having a single chief executive, the rector, being <lb/>responsible for all matters (academic and administrative) within the institution, as is envisaged by the <lb/> &quot; preferred model &quot; , would strengthen management and accountability, according to the 2009 OECD Review <lb/>of Tertiary Education of Norway (OECD, 2009a). In light of the apparent advantages of this alternative <lb/>management model, the government should consider financial incentives for institutions that adopt it, <lb/>monitoring closely outcomes. <lb/>Fostering efficiency and quality through the funding system <lb/>Most of the revenue (around 80%) of Norwegian higher education institutions comes as a block grant <lb/>from the central government. Institutions also receive various forms of external funding, including from <lb/>the Norwegian Research Council, European Union and private projects and donations (Reichert and <lb/>Ekholm, 2009). Following reform in 2002, the government&apos;s block grant, in broad terms, comprises: <lb/>i) &quot; basic &quot; funding, based on specific priorities over time for the institutions; and ii) &quot; performance-based &quot; <lb/>funding (education and research incentives), determined by a number of indicators, such as study credit <lb/>points, student exchanges with foreign institutions and research publications (Box 3). At present, the basic <lb/>funding accounts for about two-thirds of the government financing and the performance-based funding the <lb/>remaining one third. <lb/>The funding model adopted in 2002 is better than previous arrangements on several fronts. There is <lb/>stronger focus on results rather than inputs and better transparency in the allocation of funds across <lb/>institutions (at least with regard to the performance-based allocations) (Santiago et al., 2008). The 2002 <lb/>reform also sought to enhance institutional autonomy and flexibility by making the board of each <lb/>institution responsible for the management and use of their total block grant. <lb/>However, the current funding scheme is criticised by some as rigid and static. A recent study by the <lb/>Research Council Norway notes, for instance, that universities flag concerns that room for manoeuvre is <lb/>limited as, at departmental level, funding is tied primarily to positions and only a fraction of university <lb/>researchers receive substantial funding in addition to this (Benner and Öquist, 2014). Moreover, a public <lb/>consultation on the findings of a recent report on the funding of higher education and research -conducted <lb/>by an expert group which was commissioned by the government in 2014 to review the system -showed <lb/>that a majority of university-colleges (and some universities) are in favour of reform to the &quot; basic &quot; <lb/>component of the funding model. Specifically, they favour the adoption of a formula-based approach using <lb/>a mapping of activities to costs (a view not shared by the government, as discussed below) (Expert <lb/>Group, 2015). Some institutions argued, for instance, that the current funding model is inflexible and <lb/>outdated, failing to adjust to the increased complexity and importance of goals of these institutions. In <lb/>addition, given the increased time devoted to research in the &quot; new &quot; universities, it is argued that the <lb/>amount designated for research in the basic component of the funding should be increased for these <lb/>universities, aligning it more closely to that for the older ones. At present, former university-colleges that <lb/>have received a university status are still funded in a broadly similar way as university-colleges (Reichert <lb/>and Ekholm, 2009). There are also questions about the transparency of the elements of the basic funding; <lb/></body>

			<body>for instance, the infrastructure portion is said to vary enormously across institutions. To an extent, this <lb/>reflects that the older universities generally own and manage their properties, while the &quot; new &quot; universities <lb/>and university-colleges rent their buildings. <lb/>As for the impact of the funding system on higher education outcomes, the expert group notes an <lb/>overall increase in production of study credits over the past 10 years (Expert Group, 2015). This, however, <lb/>is mainly due to an increase in the student numbers rather than an increase in their performance (i.e. a rise <lb/>in the number of credits per student per year). Around 35% of Norwegian students still do not finish their <lb/>degree within the expected time (Figure 8). It appears, therefore, that current incentives still make it <lb/>attractive for institutions to focus on producing credits rather than on course completion. <lb/>In terms of research, the expert group on funding concluded that the 2002 reform prompted an <lb/>increase in the number of scientific publications and doctoral candidates, but it did not bring about a major <lb/>increase in the quality of research (Expert Group, 2015). As mentioned earlier, inward looking <lb/>management practices or administrative barriers may provide some explanation (OECD, 2009a; Benner <lb/>and Öquist, 2014). The fixed-limit budget envelope for research incentives (unlike the open budget for <lb/>education incentives) under the current funding system (Box 3) may also impact on outcomes. The <lb/>Productivity Commission suggests political intervention in the allocation of research funds may be <lb/>diminishing the efficiency of resource allocation (PC, 2015). <lb/>Box 3. Funding arrangements for higher education institutions <lb/>Higher education institutions in Norway are funded directly by the Ministry of Education and Research. The funding <lb/>aims to cover most of the costs necessary for the running of the institutions. Following international trends, Norway <lb/>introduced a performance-based component to funding in the early 2000s and this basic structure has been retained <lb/>since then. A main goal of the 2002 reform was to increase student progression and improve quality (NMER, 2005). <lb/>The university funding system comprises a block grant with three components, which each vary from year to year and <lb/>differ in importance between institutions (Table 1), reflecting the division of labour between more research-based <lb/>universities and more teaching-based university-colleges (Reichert and Ekholm, 2009). Specifically: <lb/> The &quot; basic component &quot; , covers on average 70% of the total allocation and is based on the institution&apos;s historical <lb/>budget level. The allocated amount covers funding for core tasks education (including teaching), operation and <lb/>maintenance of premises, and research and innovation. One &quot; plus &quot; of this type of allocation is that it provides <lb/>stability and predictability (OECD, 2008b), however there are drawbacks too (see text). <lb/> The &quot; education component &quot; , covers on average 24% of the grant to institutions and is based on study credit <lb/>points (ECTS credits) obtained by students at the institutions and international mobility (student exchange). The <lb/>budget for education incentives is open-ended and aims to provide an incentive to universities and <lb/>university-colleges to offer education of high international quality. <lb/> The &quot; research component &quot; , covers on average around 6% of the grant to institutions and is granted on the basis <lb/>of the number of publications, PhD-graduates, ability to obtain funding from the EU research programmes, and <lb/>ability to obtain funding from the Research Council of Norway. Funding for research incentives is based on a <lb/>fixed-limit budget. <lb/>Table 1.

			<body>The expert group report also underscored the fact that the current funding system does not promote <lb/>differentiation in institutional profiles, as it provides similar incentives for all institutions (Expert Group, <lb/>2015; Hedda, 2015). However, the expert group concluded that concerns that the funding system prompts <lb/>excessive bias towards inexpensive courses at the expense of, for example, natural sciences, or that it <lb/>generates grade inflation were not well founded (however, the report does express concern about the <lb/>differences in grading practices between institutions). <lb/>In light of its assessment, the expert group recommended maintaining the basic structure of the <lb/>current financing structure, but with some new features and parametric adjustments (Expert Group, 2015). <lb/>In particular the group suggested, among others: <lb/> Introduction of a funding mechanism based on multi-year performance agreements ( &quot; contracts &quot; ) <lb/>between the Ministry of Education and Research and each higher education institution, aiming to <lb/>incentivise differentiation and quality improvement. The three main elements of such agreements <lb/>are the development of quality in education and research, the development of collaboration with <lb/>industry and society, and the development of institutional profiles (Hedda, 2015). The &quot; contracts &quot; <lb/>would be valid for 3-4 years and a portion (probably 5%) of the &quot; basic &quot; component of the block <lb/>grant to an institution would be linked to them. <lb/> Changes to the calculation of the performance-related component of funding: <lb/> On the education dimension, introduction of an indicator reflecting the number of graduates, <lb/>alongside the existing indicator of student credits (the latter would continue to be the most <lb/>important part of the performance-based funding). The report also recommends changes in <lb/>the field specific per credit bonus in favour of laboratory and equipment intensive fields. <lb/>Moreover, the expert group report suggests strengthening incentives for international <lb/>exchange of students (mobility indicator). <lb/> On the research side, the report notably suggests adjustments that increase incentives to <lb/>attract EU funding and for high-impact publications and publications based on national and <lb/>international co-operation. <lb/>The recommendations of the expert group, along with the outcomes of public consultation on the <lb/>report, have been examined by the government. The government is particularly supportive of a system of <lb/>multi-year performance agreements and will have a dialogue with the higher education institutions on the <lb/>design of such agreements. It will retain the two main components of the current funding model -the <lb/> &quot; basic &quot; and &quot; performance-based &quot; components -with plans to increase the latter over time (Government of <lb/>Norway, 2015a). On the other hand, no changes are envisaged in the &quot; basic &quot; component of the current <lb/>system, despite proposals by several institutions during the public consultation for a formula-based basic <lb/>funding that would allow for a mapping of current activities and their cost assessment (see above). In the <lb/>authorities&apos; view (which provides support to the expert group&apos;s recommendation) a formula-based structure <lb/>using national rates for various activities would not be appropriate to fund a diverse sector, as such rates <lb/>would have to reflect averages. Moreover, such structure could bear on institutions&apos; internal allocation of <lb/>funds to the extent that these average national rates were perceived as normative (Expert Group, 2015). <lb/>Steps towards a funding system that promotes more efficiency and quality in higher education and <lb/>research are welcome. Envisaged changes to the performance-based component of funding to strengthen <lb/>incentives in key areas such as study completion go in the right direction. The new indicator on graduates, <lb/>for example, proposed in the 2016 national budget, would be expected to reinforce current incentives for <lb/>completion in the system linked to credit-production indicator, but the impact would need to be monitored <lb/>and evaluated. Enhanced incentives for increasing international exchange of students, announced in the <lb/>2016 budget, are also welcome given the importance of mobility of highly educated individuals to <lb/>knowledge circulation (OECD, 2015). Norway still ranks relatively low in terms of the share of <lb/></body>

			<body>international students enrolled in tertiary education (Figure 16). The government also envisages <lb/>strengthening research incentives through changes in the calculation method of publication points <lb/>(rewarding to a larger extent national and international co-operation), an open-ended budget for the number <lb/>of doctoral graduates, and a new indicator for external funding -public and private – received by the higher <lb/>education institutions. Changes in incentives for study completion, aimed directly at higher education <lb/>students (rather than institutions), are also under consideration (see below). <lb/>Figure 16. International students in tertiary education <lb/>International student enrolment as a percentage of total tertiary enrolment¹ <lb/>1. <lb/>International students are those students who moved from their country of origin (defined as the country of prior education <lb/>or of usual residence) for the purpose of study. 2013 data. <lb/>Source: OECD (2015), Education at a Glance 2015, Table C4.1. <lb/>The funding system could also be used towards other aspects of higher-education policy. Funding <lb/>mechanisms could, for example, provide differentiated rewards to institutions for successful study <lb/>outcomes for particular groups of students, such as immigrants. This could help address social differences <lb/>in higher education, as noted by the 2009 OECD Tertiary Education Review of Norway (OECD, 2009a). <lb/>Differentiated rewards could also be considered for specific courses that provide skills closely linked to <lb/>labour market needs, such as certain subjects within the STEM disciplines, or nursing and teaching <lb/>qualifications, by assigning a greater weight in the student-credit completions and graduations for these <lb/>courses. This would make the system more responsive to changing needs. Building in graduate labour <lb/>market outcomes to providers&apos; funding formulae could also be considered. <lb/>The expert group&apos;s proposal for some funding to be allocated based on multi-annual performance <lb/>agreements ( &quot; contracts &quot; ) is a sound idea. If designed properly, such agreements have the potential to <lb/>provide incentives to institutions to strengthen their areas of comparative advantage, quality, and <lb/>interactions with business and community. These are difficult objectives to achieve through <lb/>performance-based indicators in a formula-based system that is identical for the entire sector <lb/>(Expert Group, 2015). <lb/>0 <lb/>5 <lb/>10 <lb/>15 <lb/>20 <lb/>25 <lb/>30 <lb/>35 <lb/>40 <lb/>45 <lb/>0 <lb/>5 <lb/>10 <lb/>15 <lb/>20 <lb/>25 <lb/>30 <lb/>35 <lb/>40 <lb/>45 <lb/>LUX <lb/>AUS <lb/>GBR <lb/>CHE <lb/>AUT <lb/>NZL <lb/>NLD <lb/>DNK <lb/>BEL <lb/>FRA <lb/>CAN <lb/>OECD <lb/>FIN <lb/>DEU <lb/>ISL <lb/>IRL <lb/>SWE <lb/>HUN <lb/>SVK <lb/>PRT <lb/>USA <lb/>NOR <lb/>JPN <lb/>EST <lb/>ESP <lb/>SVN <lb/>POL <lb/>CHL <lb/>MEX <lb/>% <lb/></body>

			<body>Experiences from countries, such as Austria, Germany Finland, and the Netherlands, that have used <lb/>performance agreements to principally establish or maintain a diversified higher education system, suggest <lb/>that these agreements can indeed work well (de Boer and Jongbloed, 2014). Benefits not only arise from <lb/>the agreements themselves, but also because the process of reaching agreement improves dialogue between <lb/>the government and institutions and can increase transparency and accountability of tertiary providers <lb/>(depending on the extent to which the negotiations and/or agreements are made public). However, success <lb/>is not guaranteed. For instance, in Germany performance agreements have been rather similar across <lb/>institutions and have not led to greater diversity and specialisation (de Boer and Jongbloed, 2014). Clear <lb/>targets for the institutions concerned, with rewards only upon the achievement of results, are one ingredient <lb/>to successful performance contracts. In addition, such agreements should not limit institutions&apos; academic <lb/>autonomy and flexibility through detailed requirements or increase administrative burdens (Expert Group, <lb/>2015). Engaging higher education institutions in the design of performance agreements, as envisaged by <lb/>the government, should help guard against this. <lb/>It would be also important, from cost-effectiveness and quality points of view, to introduce <lb/>mechanisms to ensure that weak study or research programmes are not renewed. Regular evaluations of the <lb/>funding system for higher education are essential in this regard. At present, however, there are no <lb/>sufficiently solid data on learning outcomes and quality improvements upon which to base such <lb/>evaluations, but steps towards to this end (discussed below) are underway. These are welcome and should <lb/>continue. <lb/>Improving students incentives for timely study completion <lb/>Relatively high subsidies (both explicit and implicit) to students taking tertiary education courses do <lb/>not appear to have encouraged timely study completion. In addition, they are costly to the taxpayer. One <lb/>way to see if this public spending is efficient is to examine the internal rate of return to education (Santiago <lb/>et al., 2008). The OECD provides estimates of both public and private monetary rates of return per <lb/>individual obtaining tertiary education using a net present value approach based on investment theory <lb/>(Cheung et al., 2012; OECD, 2014a). Ideally, the value of non-monetary social benefits, such as greater <lb/>overall life satisfaction, should be taken into account in the calculations, but these are difficult to quantify. <lb/>Based on the OECD calculations, the returns to tertiary education, both the public and private ones, are <lb/>lower in Norway than in most other countries, especially for men (Figure 17, Panels A and B). However, <lb/>private returns to tertiary education are still sizeable. <lb/>ECO/WKP(2016)9 <lb/></body>

A common justification for such fees is that individuals benefit financially from tertiary education <lb/>because it gives them access to better-paid jobs and so, in the interest of fairness, students ought to <lb/>contribute to the cost. Also, a suitably constructed system of tuition fees (accompanied by a scheme of <lb/>income-contingent repayment of loans to overcome concerns about access to tertiary education) could <lb/>improve efficiency and quality by encouraging timely completions and increasing students&apos; expectations <lb/>for value for money, while making them more receptive to market signals (OECD, 2014b, 2014c). In <lb/>addition, tuition charges can widen the sources of funding for institutions, and can provide incentives to <lb/>institutions to respond better to students&apos; and labour market&apos;s demands and provide higher quality <lb/>education (OECD, 2008a, 2009a, 2011). <lb/>0 <lb/>5 <lb/>10 <lb/>15 <lb/>20 <lb/>25 <lb/>30 <lb/>35 <lb/>0 <lb/>5 <lb/>10 <lb/>15 <lb/>20 <lb/>25 <lb/>30 <lb/>35 <lb/>POL <lb/>HUN <lb/>CZE <lb/>SVK <lb/>EST <lb/>PRT <lb/>SVN <lb/>CHL <lb/>USA <lb/>OECD <lb/>ISR <lb/>CAN <lb/>AUT <lb/>DEU <lb/>AUS <lb/>FIN <lb/>ITA <lb/>ESP <lb/>DNK <lb/>NOR <lb/>SWE <lb/>NZL <lb/>KOR <lb/>% <lb/>A.

			<body>There have been successful transitions to fee systems. However, there are pitfalls. Knowing that <lb/>students have comparatively easy access to loans and grants to pay tuition fees can prompt providers to <lb/>ramp up the supply of courses, with little regard for course quality, and this may require additional <lb/>mechanisms. The US Gainful Employment regulations, for example, aim to ensure that institutions improve <lb/>their outcomes for students, or risk losing access to federal student aid (U.S Department of Education, <lb/>2014). Also, tuition fees&apos; role in helping guide student choices can be weakened if (as is often the case) <lb/>institutions set fees at the same level across most of the courses they offer (typical exceptions being <lb/>medicine and performing arts) and, similarly, if there is little differentiation of fees across institutions. <lb/>A number of special factors militate against the introduction of tuition fees in the Norwegian context. <lb/>The relatively high degree of wage compression in Norway, as in other Nordic countries (Figure 18), can <lb/>reduce incentives to invest in higher education, justifying to an extent the large public subsidies to tertiary <lb/>education (OECD, 2010, 2014a). Also, the Nordic social welfare function places a high value on free and <lb/>inclusive education and on delinking support for young adults from their parents&apos; finances, which make the <lb/>introduction of tuition and targeting support based on parents&apos; income politically difficult. <lb/>However, there is room for policy initiatives regarding the loan-based support for students&apos; living <lb/>expenses. Indeed, adjustment to this support has already been used to encourage more timely completion of <lb/>studies. Changes made in the early 2000s included the introduction of a mechanism allowing up to 40% of <lb/>student loan to be converted into a grant subject to academic progress (Box 4). However, according to <lb/>experts this did not significantly reduce study delays (Opheim, 2011). This may reflect the fact that other <lb/>factors than financial incentives might weigh more on completions (such as the relative low participation <lb/>cost to tertiary education in the absence of tuition fees) and/or design issues of the financial incentives. For <lb/>example, the reform has increased the income threshold before the amount of grant is reduced, providing <lb/>incentives for work perhaps at the expense of study time (Opheim, 2011). A previous reform rewarding for <lb/>on-time completion (known as &quot; turbo &quot; reform) appeared to be more effective, although comparison of the <lb/>two incentive schemes is difficult. The reform provided for a reduction of around 10% of the total loan <lb/>amount for students who completed certain graduate programmes between 1990 and 1995 within a certain <lb/>timeframe. According to Gunnes et al. (2011), the turbo scheme resulted in an increase of about 10% in <lb/>students who graduated in stipulated time. The reform reduced delays of studies by 0.23 semesters per year <lb/>treated (Gunnes, et al., 2013). <lb/>Figure 18.

			<body>Box 4. Student financial support <lb/>Norwegian students (and under certain conditions, some foreign students) are entitled to financial support from <lb/>the State Education Loan Fund for a maximum of 10 months per year (which will increase gradually from 10 to 11 <lb/>months until 2020) and for a maximum of 8 years. The financial support amounted to NOK 97 850 (around EUR 10 <lb/>600, assuming an exchange rate of 9.2) in academic year 2014-15. The support is meant to cover costs of living, as <lb/>there are no tuition fees at public institutions. Students enrolled in private institutions may also apply for additional <lb/>loans to cover the costs of fees. Around 90% of students take up the loans (Opheim, 2011). <lb/>Key aspects of the student support system are as follows: <lb/> Students initially receive support as a loan but part of this loan can be converted into a grant (in effect the <lb/>loan is partially written off) conditional on: <lb/>a) Criteria relating to study progression (this dimension was introduced in the 2002 reform). As a main rule, <lb/>40% of loans are transformed to grants upon completion of semesters. Students are still entitled however <lb/>for government support for up to one year&apos;s delayed study progression (Opheim, 2011). <lb/>b) Student&apos;s income and assets (notably parental income does not play a role). Most notably there is an <lb/>income threshold beyond which the conversion to grant is reduced. <lb/>c) Whether students live with their parents or not; only students living away are eligible for the grants (those <lb/>living with parents are eligible for student loans only). This appears to be a powerful driver of student <lb/>choices, only around 10% of students are reported to be living with their parents. <lb/> Loans are interest-free and no repayment is required before the completion of studies. Loan repayments <lb/>are calculated on the basis of 20-years repayment on a flat-rate basis. <lb/>The government is currently considering the recommendations from the Productivity Commission <lb/>(PC, 2015) and the expert group on the higher education funding (Expert Group, 2015) regarding an <lb/>additional incentive to students for completion of all degrees (besides the incentives planned for higher <lb/>education institutions, as discussed above). Given the evidence, further experimentation with &quot; turbo &quot; type <lb/>incentives (see above) in student-loan support, aiming to improve study completion, certainly seems <lb/>worthwhile. Student support could also be better linked to study requirements with a differentiation of the <lb/>length of support, according to the standard duration of the courses. Other policy goals might also be <lb/>achieved (at least partially) through further tweaks to the loan-support system, perhaps along the lines <lb/>already in place that partially write off loans for students attending certain teacher training programs <lb/>(STEM and foreign languages) and for graduate doctors who work in the northern counties. Discounts on <lb/>loan repayment or grant conversions could be offered for students taking courses that are seen as having <lb/>particularly high returns to the general public, such as certain subjects within the STEM disciplines and <lb/>some professions where demand for graduates is likely to increase rapidly (long-term projections suggest <lb/>this may be the case for nurses, for example); though selecting which subjects to support needs careful <lb/>attention. Of course, the private return to education also depends strongly on wage prospects. In this <lb/>context, Norway&apos;s narrow wage distribution has some bearing on student choices. Needless to say, <lb/>uncertainties in the outcomes of reforming the financial incentives for students means any such changes <lb/>should be carefully monitored and evaluated. <lb/>To reduce delayed completions it may also be necessary to increase higher education admission <lb/>standards, which would make it more difficult for students with a low probability of completion to enter <lb/>the system (PC, 2015). As mentioned earlier, PIAAC data show that a relatively high share of 20-34 <lb/>year-old tertiary graduates has low literacy levels, although Norway fares better than the OECD average in <lb/>this regard (Figure 5). Plans by the government to strengthen admission requirements for applicants to <lb/>science studies and teacher training education in science, as well as to bachelor programmes in nursing and <lb/>journalist education are welcome in this regard, and should be implemented. A previous Economic Survey <lb/>(OECD, 2008a) identified insufficient competence at entry to tertiary education as another potential reason <lb/>behind the long duration of tertiary studies. <lb/></body>

			<body>Ensuring good communication and data to help prospective students make informed choices is <lb/>particularly important in Norway. Indeed, informing educational choices is one of the main skills <lb/>challenges according to the OECD Skills Strategy for Norway (OECD, 2014c). Easily accessible databases <lb/>to students on courses&apos; outcomes, in terms of career and income prospects, and professional career <lb/>guidance services, would facilitate more informed choices and contribute to higher completion rates. <lb/>Making good use of existing data on labour-market trends would also help. Career guidance and <lb/>counselling services are particularly important to address the information gap for students that come from <lb/>disadvantaged backgrounds as such students often underestimate the net benefits of tertiary education <lb/>(OECD, 2009a). A committee was appointed in 2015 by the government to investigate how the lifelong <lb/>career guidance can be strengthened. It is due to report in the course of 2016. <lb/>Monitoring quality in the tertiary education sector <lb/>Mechanisms that monitor outcomes and respond to poor performance are critical for improving the <lb/>quality of tertiary education. The establishment of the Norwegian Agency for Quality Assurance in <lb/>Education (NOKUT) in the early 2000s, and legal requirements for tertiary education providers to run <lb/>internal quality assurance systems (which are audited by NOKUT), had a positive impact on the <lb/> &quot; institutional quality culture &quot; , according to the 2009 Review of Tertiary Education (OECD, 2009a) <lb/>(Box 5). <lb/>A recent evaluation report concludes that NOKUT complies with the majority of European Standards <lb/>and Guidelines for quality assurance in higher education, but does highlight some areas for improvement <lb/>(NOKUT, 2013c). In particular, NOKUT was advised to further strengthen auditing, as at present the <lb/>design of audit process and criteria allow &quot; room for interpretation &quot; ; and, to introduce &quot; follow-ups of <lb/>recommendations &quot; in evaluation reports (NOKUT, 2013c). Also, the evaluation concluded that NOKUT&apos;s <lb/>current legal and regulatory framework hampers adjustments to the existing quality assurance framework, <lb/>and hence innovation. NOKUT has limited powers to alter the quality assurance framework without a <lb/>lengthy process of coordination with the Ministry of Education and Research and the need for an approval <lb/>from the government and parliament. Requirements that result in disproportionate time and resources spent <lb/>on the evaluation of small institutions, which cater only few students, compared to the large ones, are <lb/>indicative of these rigidities (NOKUT, 2013c), even though parliamentary procedures allow for enhanced <lb/>scrutiny of legislative instruments. <lb/>Moreover, the accreditation process was found to have an impact on the higher education landscape <lb/>(NOKUT, 2013c). This is reflected, according to the evaluation report, in the increased number of new <lb/>institutions in the sector and the university-colleges that acquired a university status through such process. <lb/>Since the early 2000s there was a doubling in the number of universities (from 4 in 2003 to 8 in 2012), and <lb/>more institutions have aspirations for university status (NOKUT, 2013b). In addition, new providers grew <lb/>fast, as did the number of new advanced programmes in university-colleges, with more than 100 master&apos;s <lb/>programmes and around 30 doctoral ones having been accredited by NOKUT in these institutions between <lb/>2003 and 2012 (NOKUT, 2013b). <lb/></body>

			<body>Box 5. Quality assurance mechanisms for tertiary education <lb/>The Norwegian Agency for Quality Assurance in Education (NOKUT) was established under the Quality <lb/>Reform in Higher education in 2002 and is funded fully by the state and regulated by the Ministry of Education and <lb/>Research (Campbell et al., 2015). The agency is responsible for the accreditation (of institutions and study <lb/>programmes) and quality assessment (audit of internal quality assurance systems) for higher education, as well as <lb/>tertiary vocational education. It also assesses foreign higher education institutions. Higher education institutions in <lb/>Norway also have a role in quality assurance as they are legally required to develop their own quality assurance <lb/>systems – audited by NOKUT. <lb/>Accreditation is based on ex ante evaluation with unlimited periods of validity: once granted to the institution <lb/>the accreditation lasts until explicitly revoked following an assessment (Campbell et al., 2015). There is a hierarchy <lb/>in accreditation of study programmes. Universities have a self-accrediting status, that is they can decide freely on <lb/>the study programmes to offer, at all levels, without the need to apply to NOKUT for accreditation, while accredited <lb/>university-colleges have to apply for the accreditation for programmes at master&apos;s and doctoral levels (apart from <lb/>specific cases) and specialised universities for programmes outside their field (again apart from specific cases). <lb/>Non-accredited university-colleges must apply to NOKUT for all study programmes (Reichert and Ekholm, 2009). <lb/>There is also an accreditation control process to protect against potential abuse of the granted powers. This is <lb/>carried out by NOKUT through two external quality assurance processes: ad hoc revisions of an institution or <lb/>programme that may result in a withdrawal of the previously granted accreditation, and cyclical audits of institutions&apos; <lb/>internal quality assurance systems, which are conducted every 6 years (the maximum). Institutions that fail to meet <lb/>such criteria in terms of internal quality assurance lose their right (if themselves are accrediting organisations) to <lb/>establish new study programmes, or to apply for accreditation of new study programmes (in the case of non-<lb/>accredited institutions) (Campbell et al., 2015). <lb/>Changing requirements for accreditation and the establishment of advanced research programmes <lb/>The government plans to tighten the requirements for an institution to apply for accreditation as a specialised <lb/>university and university and for creating programmes at master&apos;s and doctoral levels (Government of Norway, <lb/>2015a). Specifically, the plans include the following proposals: <lb/> To qualify as a specialised university, an institution must document an enrolment of at least 15 students per <lb/>doctoral programme over time. Institutions opting for a university status must document that at least two of <lb/>their doctoral programmes have an average graduation of 5 candidates per year over a 3-year period; while <lb/>those seeking to become a specialised university have to prove that the doctoral programme they offer has an <lb/>average graduation of 5 candidates per year over a 3-year period. <lb/> Accreditation to university status should continue to be subject to offering doctoral degree programmes in four <lb/>subjects, but in addition such programmes should also cover the institution&apos;s main areas of academic activities <lb/>and not only a part of them. In the case of application for accreditation as a specialised university, the <lb/>applicant institution must prove that the doctoral programme covers its main academic areas. <lb/>The government plans to initiate a process, in consultation with NOKUT and the Research Council of Norway, <lb/>to strengthen the requirements for the establishment of master&apos;s and doctoral programmes. Following the <lb/>transitional period, the Ministry will consider whether institutions that offer four master&apos;s programmes may be able to <lb/>self-accredit new master&apos;s programmes. <lb/>These developments raise questions about diversity. Taking stock of the dynamics in the Norwegian <lb/>tertiary education sector in recent years, NOKUT (2013b) concludes that the profile of programmes <lb/>broadened in each institution, increasing diversity within institutions, while institutional profiles became in <lb/>many ways more similar, reducing diversity between institutions. As discussed above, much of the reduced <lb/>inter-institutional diversity is the result of &quot; academic drift &quot; arising from new universities and university-<lb/>colleges moving into academic subject areas (and research areas) that have traditionally been the domain of <lb/>the older universities (though there has also been some movement in the opposite direction with traditional <lb/>universities branching into vocational courses). Large differences remain between the old universities, the <lb/>new universities and the university-colleges (Bakken and Storm, 2012); the portfolios of the new <lb/>universities continue to be dominated by traditional professional programmes, such as teaching and nursing <lb/>and relatively fewer students in master&apos;s degree programmes (NOKUT, 2013b). However, if this academic <lb/>drift continues in the future, institutional diversity needs to be closely monitored and safeguarded, <lb/></body>

			<body>especially regarding the educational opportunities with a more vocational orientation that might become <lb/>more academically demanding (NOKUT, 2013b). Moreover, there are concerns that such drift, while <lb/>providing academic development, can lead to the creation of too many small institutions offering master&apos;s <lb/>and doctoral programmes, with a potential adverse impact on quality. The merger process (see above) may <lb/>help reduce this risk. <lb/>The government plans to tighten the requirements for accreditation as a specialised university or a <lb/>university, making the upgrading of the status dependent on required minimum enrolments and graduations <lb/>in the institution&apos;s doctoral programme(s), and also on the extent that such programmes cover the key areas <lb/>of the institution&apos;s academic activities (Box 5). Tighter criteria for establishing master&apos;s-and doctoral-level <lb/>programmes are also envisaged, with the aim of increasing their scope and academic credentials <lb/>(Government of Norway, 2015a). In addition, NOKUT&apos;s supervision of existing educational programmes <lb/>will be strengthened. <lb/>The envisaged changes go in right direction. It is important that the accreditation process, giving the <lb/>opportunity to institutions to apply for a higher status, is based on comprehensive and clear criteria of <lb/>academic performance. Tighter criteria for the establishment of advanced research programmes will also <lb/>help quality. A close monitoring of the impact of the new conditions is important. <lb/>Beyond the current proposals, harmonisation of quality control of doctoral programmes across <lb/>institutions should also be on the agenda. The Research Council of Norway highlights, in this context, the <lb/>lack of guidance on the length of such programmes, as well as of the monitoring of completion rates <lb/>(RCN, 2011). To this end, the Council recommends the introduction of a national system to enforce and <lb/>maintain the quality of doctoral degrees. <lb/>Also, enhancements in performance indicators are essential for better monitoring quality <lb/>improvements in tertiary education. The requirement for the institutions to produce a yearly report and <lb/>provide data on completions and other performance indicators is welcome in this regard. The authorities <lb/>should expedite initiatives to improve information on learning outcomes. NOKUT is already conducting an <lb/>annual national student survey and experiments with national exams in selected courses, as well as <lb/>developing joint evaluations of research and educational activities in collaboration with the Research <lb/>Council of Norway. Plans also include an internet portal of quality indicators and a survey of employers&apos; <lb/>assessment of education quality (Government of Norway, 2015a). <lb/>While the moves currently underway to improve the quality of tertiary education certainly head in the <lb/>right direction, this is a policy area requiring ongoing campaigns and initiatives. In light of this it is <lb/>welcome that a White Paper on the quality of education is planned, with publication envisaged in <lb/>spring 2017. <lb/></body>

			<body>Recommendations on addressing the challenges in higher education <lb/>Ensure that the higher education system promotes efficiency and quality through successful mergers, effective <lb/>governance, well-designed financial incentives to institutions for student progress and effective monitoring <lb/>mechanisms. In particular: <lb/> Continue to promote mergers among higher education institutions. Ensure partner institutions are carefully <lb/>selected and provide adequate and sufficiently flexible financial support during the merging process. <lb/> Monitor closely the impact of the mergers on efficacy and quality in higher education and research. <lb/> As proposed by the government, encourage institutions to adopt a governance model that entails an <lb/>external chairman and an appointed rector. <lb/> Pursue plans to include the graduation rates in the formula for performance-based funding. <lb/> Consider introducing differentiated rewards to institutions via the funding system for particular groups of <lb/>students, such as immigrants, and for those courses that are linked closer to labour market needs. <lb/> Develop multi-annual performance agreements between the government and each higher education <lb/>institution. <lb/> Terminate funding for weak study or research programmes. <lb/> Tighten requirements for institutional accreditation and the establishment of master&apos;s-and doctoral-level <lb/>programmes. <lb/> Continue to improve data and dissemination via mechanisms such as the annual national student survey, <lb/>and the development of a portal of quality indicators. <lb/>As regards financial support for students: <lb/> Further target incentives and financial support to students who complete their courses on time. In particular, <lb/>consider an additional reward on the completion of degrees or linking the length of support to the standard <lb/>duration of courses. <lb/> Steer student choices, for instance, via loan discounts for subjects with high demand. <lb/></body>
