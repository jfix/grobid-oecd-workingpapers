			<body>ABSTRACT <lb/>Many countries invest considerable resources into promoting employment and the creation of jobs. At <lb/>the same time, policies and institutions still pay relatively little attention to the quality of jobs although job <lb/>quality has been found to be a major driver of employee wellbeing and may be an important factor for work <lb/>productivity. Eventually, job quality might also influence labour supply choices and lead to higher <lb/>employment. Providing robust evidence for the relationship between job quality and worker productivity <lb/>could make a strong case for labour market policies directed at the improvement of job quality. This paper <lb/>reviews existing evidence on the relationship between the quality of the work environment and individual <lb/>at-work productivity, defined as reduced productivity while at work, and assesses the effect of health on <lb/>this relationship. <lb/>After screening 2 319 studies from various fields and disciplines, including economics and medicine, <lb/>48 studies are reviewed. Strong evidence is found for a negative relationship between job stress or job strain <lb/>and individual at-work productivity and for a positive relationship between job rewards and productivity. <lb/>Moderate evidence is found for a negative relationship between work-family conflict and at-work <lb/>productivity and for a positive relationship between fairness at work and social support from co-workers <lb/>and productivity. Health influences the relationship between the quality of the work environment and <lb/>productivity. Specifically, the relationship is stronger for people in good health. <lb/>Job quality needs a more prominent place in labour market policy. More attention needs to be paid to <lb/>workers&apos; perceptions of the quality of their work environment and how policies and practices at both the <lb/>level of the worker and the work environment may influence this. Furthermore, as health-related factors <lb/>significantly influence the relationship between job quality and productivity, multidisciplinary approaches <lb/>are needed to support at-work productivity. <lb/></body>

			<body>RÉSUMÉ <lb/>De nombreux pays investissent des ressources considérables dans la promotion de l&apos;emploi et la <lb/>création d&apos;emplois. Les politiques et les institutions continuent en même temps à accorder relativement peu <lb/>d&apos;attention à la qualité des emplois, bien que celle-ci soit un facteur majeur du bien-être des employés et <lb/>peut-être un facteur important pour la productivité du travail. La qualité de l&apos;emploi pourrait finalement <lb/>influencer également les choix d&apos;offre de main-d&apos;oeuvre et conduire à un emploi supérieur. Fournir des <lb/>preuves solides sur la relation entre la qualité de l&apos;emploi et la productivité des travailleurs pourrait <lb/>constituer un argument de taille dans les politiques du marché du travail visant à améliorer la qualité de <lb/>l&apos;emploi. Cet article examine les résultats existants sur la relation entre la qualité de l&apos;environnement <lb/>professionnel et la productivité individuelle au travail, définie comme une productivité réduite et évalue <lb/>l&apos;effet de la santé sur cette relation. <lb/>Après avoir examiné 2 319 études dans divers domaines et disciplines, y compris l&apos;économie et la <lb/>médecine, 48 d&apos;entre elles ont été reconsidérées. Des preuves solides ont ainsi pu mettre en évidence une <lb/>relation négative entre stress ou tension au travail et productivité individuelle au travail, ainsi qu&apos;une <lb/>relation positive entre récompenses professionnelles et productivité. Un résultat modéré est mis en évidence <lb/>dans le cas d&apos;une relation négative entre conflit familiale et productivité au travail et dans le cas d&apos;une <lb/>relation positive entre équité au travail et soutien social des collègues et productivité. La santé influence la <lb/>relation entre la qualité de l&apos;environnement de professionnel et la productivité. Plus précisément, la relation <lb/>est plus forte pour les personnes en bonne santé. <lb/>La qualité de l&apos;emploi nécessite une place plus importante dans les politiques du marché du travail. <lb/>Il est nécessaire d&apos;accorder plus d&apos;attention à la perception qu&apos;ont les travailleurs de la qualité de leur <lb/>environnement professionnel et à la manière dont les politiques et pratiques, tant au niveau du travailleur <lb/>que de son environnement, peuvent influencer cette situation. De plus, du fait que les facteurs liés à la santé <lb/>influent de manière significative la relation entre qualité de l&apos;emploi et productivité, des approches <lb/>multidisciplinaires sont nécessaires pour soutenir la productivité au travail. <lb/></body>

			<body>INTRODUCTION <lb/>This paper links and contributes to two streams of recent OECD work: i) the work on Job Quality <lb/>which lead to the development of the OECD Job Quality Framework and ii) the work on Mental Health and <lb/>Work which culminated in the release of the Recommendation of the OECD Council on Integrated Mental <lb/>Health, Skills and Work Policy. <lb/>The OECD Job Quality Framework has underlined the importance of giving more prominence in <lb/>policy and practice to the quality of the jobs created in a country to promote job-rich economic <lb/>growth (Cazes, Hijzen and Saint-Martin, 2015). While countries are more focused on promoting the <lb/>quantity of jobs and labour force participation, the quality of a job has been found to be a major driver of <lb/>employee wellbeing and may be an important factor for sustainable work participation and work <lb/>productivity (Catalina-Romero et al., 2015; Milner, Butterworth, Bentley, Kavanagh <lb/>and LaMontagne, 2015; Stansfeld and Candy, 2006). <lb/>Following this, the OECD Job Quality Framework has provided a yardstick for assessing job quality, <lb/>which allows comparisons over time and across countries and socio-demographic groups. In the <lb/>Framework, job quality is assessed along three dimensions: earnings quality, labour market security and <lb/>quality of the work environment. There is ample evidence that these dimensions contribute to employee <lb/>wellbeing (Schaufeli and Taris, 2014; Stevenson and Wolfers, 2013; Green, 2011; Salvatori, 2010). <lb/>While employee wellbeing is an end in its own right, the OECD Job Quality Framework emphasises <lb/>the importance of assessing the impact of job quality on work productivity to provide further justification <lb/>for incorporating job quality in policy recommendations on labour market performance. Whereas the <lb/>dimensions of earnings quality and labour market security are quantitative in nature and can be more easily <lb/>related to work productivity and compared across contexts, the dimension of the quality of the work <lb/>environment captures many qualitative aspects of employment that are less easily translated in terms of <lb/>work productivity and less comparable. <lb/>The first goal of this paper is to review existing evidence on the relationship between the quality of <lb/>the work environment and work productivity. While productivity is a multidimensional construct and can <lb/>be operationalized in different ways – e.g. through annual working hours or output per hour worked or the <lb/>number of sick-leave days –, we chose to specifically focus on at-work productivity loss which refers to a <lb/>worker&apos;s reduced productivity, or performance, while at work. <lb/>Through the OECD Mental Health and Work review (OECD, 2012; OECD, 2015) it has become <lb/>evident that participating in work and being productive at work is far more challenging for people with <lb/>health problems compared to their peers without health problems, and even more so for people with mental <lb/>health problems. For example, 70% of people with mild-to-moderate mental health problems report to have <lb/>experienced reduced at-work productivity or performance compared to 30% of their peers without mental <lb/>health problems (OECD, 2012). An important question arising is whether and in what way the relationship <lb/>between the quality of the work environment and individual at-work productivity is influenced by health. <lb/>The relationship may differ depending on the workers&apos; health status or, workers&apos; health could explain the <lb/>relationship between the quality of the work environment and at-work productivity (in other words, a poor <lb/>work environment may lead to reduced health which in turn may reduce the worker&apos;s productivity). <lb/>A second goal of this paper is to assess the existing evidence on the effect of health on the relationship <lb/>between the quality of the work environment and at-work productivity. <lb/></body>

			<body>DEFINITIONS <lb/>The quality of the work environment, individual at-work productivity and also health can be measured <lb/>and construed in a number of ways. It is not assumed that the particular definitions used in this paper are <lb/>superior to alternative definitions, but it is important to be aware of the choice made to ensure clarity about <lb/>the focus of this paper, and its findings. <lb/>At-work productivity <lb/>In the field of Work and Health, at-work productivity is often seen as one particular aspect of overall <lb/>work productivity, in addition to absenteeism and work disability. Often, the focus is on assessing at-work <lb/>productivity loss due to health problems. Examples of definitions of at-work productivity loss used in the <lb/>literature include &apos;the inability to adequately perform one&apos;s work due to health problems,&apos; &apos;having gone to <lb/>work while hindered by health problems,&apos; or &apos;perceiving difficulties in meeting work demands given one&apos;s <lb/>(physical or mental) health.&apos; In this strand of literature, at-work productivity is usually assessed from the <lb/>perspective of the individual worker. <lb/>Different from that, the organisational psychology, human resource and business literature more <lb/>frequently interpret at-work productivity as performance at work, with no specific connection to people&apos;s <lb/>health status. Performance could be interpreted as an assessment of overall performance (or productivity), <lb/>but often it is also further divided into, for example, in-role performance, extra-role performance, task <lb/>performance, and others. While assessments by the individual worker are most common, in this field, <lb/>supervisor ratings or team performance ratings are also used. <lb/>For this paper, the decision was made to define at-work productivity as either: <lb/>1. <lb/>An assessment of the percentage of time or number of days one has (or has not) been productive <lb/>or functioning well while at work, which could include a specific connection to health <lb/>(i.e. problems with reduced productivity/functioning due to health problems); or <lb/>2. <lb/>An overall assessment of one&apos;s performance or productivity while at work. <lb/>This particular choice has two major limitations, or implications. First, the focus in this paper is on a <lb/>subjective assessment by the individual worker which may be quite remote from the &quot; economic concept &quot; of <lb/>productivity because workers have no ways of observing firm&apos;s value added. Secondly, absenteeism is not <lb/>included in this definition, i.e. the study only looks at performance or productivity of workers while at <lb/>work. In other words, the paper is looking at productivity per hour of work whereas, by narrowing the <lb/>analysis in this way, it omits any possible effects that a bad quality of the work environment might have on <lb/>lowering productivity per worker for a given level of hourly productivity (by increasing sick leave and <lb/>other absences from work). This effect could potentially be as large as the one considered in the paper. <lb/>Quality of the work environment <lb/>Two dominant theories on the quality of the work environment are the Effort-Reward Imbalance (ERI) <lb/>and the Job Demands-Resources (JD-R) models (Bakker and Demerouti, 2007; Siegrist, 1996). The ERI <lb/>model postulates reciprocity between effort, consisting of extrinsic job demands and intrinsic motivation to <lb/>meet these demands, and rewards, consisting of salary, esteem, security and career opportunities. It is <lb/>hypothesised that an imbalance between effort and rewards results in reduced worker wellbeing. The JD-R <lb/>model theorises an interaction between job demands and job resources, where job demands refer to physical, <lb/>psychological, social or organisational aspects that request effort or skills and job resources refer to physical, <lb/>psychological, social or organisational aspects that help in achieving goals, reduce job demands and/or <lb/>stimulate personal growth (Bakker and Demerouti, 2007). According to the JD-R model, job demands can <lb/></body>

			<note place="headnote">DELSA/ELSA/WD/SEM(2017)1 <lb/></note>

			<page>10 <lb/></page>

			<body>lead to reduced wellbeing and job resources to improved motivation. Adequate job resources may buffer the <lb/>negative relationship between job demands and wellbeing. This implies that (additional) job demands are <lb/>more problematic for workers if they do not have the job resources to cope with these demands. Similarly, <lb/>(additional) job demands may reduce the positive relationship between job resources and motivation. The <lb/>effort and reward concepts are also included in the JD-R model (as being part of demands and resources, <lb/>respectively), but the specific trade-off hypothesis is not postulated in the JD-R model. <lb/>Many empirical studies have tried to validate the JD-R and ERI models, and there is evidence showing <lb/>that the mechanisms described in these models are indeed related to worker wellbeing and motivation (e.g. <lb/>burn-out and organisational commitment). Additionally, there is evidence for a relationship with <lb/>absenteeism (Arnold B. Bakker &amp; Demerouti, 2007; Catalina-Romero et al., 2015; Milner et al., 2015). <lb/>However, less is known about studies that have looked at the balance of job demands and job resources and <lb/>at-work productivity. Lagerveld et al. (2010) reviewed studies on the association between work factors and <lb/>work functioning (which they defined as the productivity or performance of employees at work) and found <lb/>only one factor to be associated, namely the type of occupation. However, this finding was based on only <lb/>one study which was also cross-sectional in design. A more recent review by Miraglia and Johns (2016) <lb/>combined correlations found in different studies between work factors and presenteeism (defined as <lb/> &quot; attending work when ill &quot; ). This meta-analysis of correlations identified multiple work factors as strongly <lb/>correlated to presenteeism, including: role demands, workload, understaffing, working hours and physical <lb/>demands. However, the review only focused on presenteeism as an outcome, while at-work productivity <lb/>can be assessed in various other ways (for instance, an assessment of work performance or work <lb/>functioning). An overview of study results on the relationship between the quality of the work environment <lb/>and at-work productivity (as assessed in different ways) would add to the current literature. <lb/>In the OECD Job Quality Framework, quality of the work environment is defined largely along the <lb/>lines of the JD-R model. The OECD job strain index takes several components and dimensions of the <lb/>quality of the work environment into account, to identify the extent to which job demands exceed <lb/>job resources. There is no consensus on a minimal set of ingredients to measure the quality of the work <lb/>environment and, therefore, a minimal set of questions to be included in surveys that aim to examine <lb/>the quality of the work environment. The forthcoming OECD Guidelines on Measuring Quality of <lb/>the Working Environment will address conceptualisation and measurement issues. <lb/>In this paper, quality of the work environment is defined in the broader JD-R way of physical, <lb/>psychological, social or organisational job demands and job resources. This includes psychosocial work <lb/>factors such as psychological job demands, autonomy/job control, social support or job rewards, as well as <lb/>more contextual work factors like organisational size, type of contract or job type. Notably, the paper is <lb/>based on what factors and dimensions the studies reviewed have considered. Moreover, the terms quality of <lb/>the work environment and work factors (which are seen as an operationalization of the quality of the work <lb/>environment) are used interchangeably. <lb/>Health <lb/>Since 1948, the World Health Organisation defines health as &quot; a state of complete physical, mental and <lb/>social wellbeing and not merely the absence of disease of infirmity &quot; . This definition has been criticised in <lb/>the past decades, especially for using the word &apos;complete&apos; with respect to wellbeing. Probably, the <lb/>requirement of complete health would render the majority of the population unhealthy. Recently, Huber and <lb/>colleagues redefined health to a more dynamic concept of &apos;the ability to adapt and to self-manage, in the <lb/>face of social, mental and physical challenges in life&apos; (Huber et al., 2011). With this concept of health, <lb/>people with physical, mental or social challenges who are able and enabled to cope well with these <lb/>challenges are regarded as healthy. This positive and dynamic concept of health is still underused in <lb/>research, where health is often assessed through the absence or presence of physical and/or mental health <lb/></body>

			<body>problems, symptoms or disabilities. As this paper reviews the existing research literature, it defines health <lb/>in line with the common approach i.e. the presence or absence of physical and/or mental health problems, <lb/>symptoms or disabilities. <lb/>METHODS <lb/>Literature search <lb/>Scientific articles were searched in the following medical, psychological and economic literature <lb/>databases: PubMed, PsycInfo, Business Source Elite and Web of Science. The search strategy consisted of <lb/>search terms related to at-work productivity loss (e.g. presenteeism, job performance, work functioning) <lb/>combined with terms related to work factors (e.g. work conditions, work stressors, psychosocial factors). <lb/>No search terms on health were included as the primary goal was to identify research on the relationship <lb/>between quality of the work environment and at-work productivity, regardless of the effect of health on this <lb/>relationship. Including search terms related to health would restrict the number of studies that would be <lb/>identified. Also, no restrictions were used on study type or year of publication, and the search included <lb/>articles up until April 2016. The search string for each database can be found in the appendix. Additional <lb/>articles were searched through scanning the reference list of included studies. <lb/>Inclusion of studies <lb/>One author (IA) screened all titles and abstracts of articles that were found through the literature <lb/>search. In case of uncertainty of including or excluding an article the full text was retrieved, and if that <lb/>would not solve the uncertainty discussion took place with a second author (CP or FA). Inclusion criteria <lb/>for studies were: (1) empirical, quantitative data were presented on the relationship between work factors <lb/>and at-work productivity; (2) at-work productivity was quantitatively assessed at the individual level by <lb/>requesting (a) the percentage of time/number of days a worker has (not) been productive/functioning well at <lb/>work or (b) a worker&apos;s overall rating of his/her own performance/productivity/functioning at work; (3) the <lb/>included work factors had to represent the psychosocial quality of the work environment and could be <lb/>either (a) objective characteristics (e.g. contract hours, manual/non-manual work) or (b) psychosocial <lb/>characteristics (e.g. job demands, resources, workplace bullying); (4) the article should be written in <lb/>English, Dutch or German; and (5) the study should take place in a real-life workplace setting, e.g. not in a <lb/>simulated/laboratory setting. Articles using measures of work ability or specific aspects of job performance <lb/>(e.g. in-role, extra-role, task or contextual performance) were excluded, as these do not provide an <lb/>indication of the amount of time a worker is (not) functioning/being productive at work or an overall <lb/>performance score. Furthermore, reviews were excluded, but their reference lists were checked for <lb/>potentially relevant studies. <lb/>Data extraction <lb/>One author (IA) extracted data from the included studies on study type (cross-sectional, longitudinal), <lb/>study year, country, study goal, population type, population size, response rate, exposure variables <lb/>included, covariates controlled for, outcome variable, statistical method and study outcome (i.e. significant <lb/>relationships between work factors and at-work productivity in final models). <lb/>Data synthesis <lb/>In order to ensure a degree of homogeneity, additional inclusion and exclusion criteria were <lb/>formulated. Studies were only included if the relationship between work factors and at-work productivity <lb/>was investigated through multivariable analyses including more than one work factor and at least two <lb/>confounders, age and gender. Furthermore, the cut-off for significance in the multivariable model had to be <lb/>set at P&lt;.05. In case results were only presented for subgroups (e.g. age groups, occupational type) and <lb/></body>

			<note place="footnote">different outcomes were found across the subgroups, the study was excluded. Similarly, studies were <lb/>excluded when multiple, different instruments for assessing at-work productivity were used, or when only <lb/>scores on subscales of an instrument were reported. Finally, when different work factors were grouped <lb/>together to present a single factor, the study was also excluded. <lb/>Effect coefficients (e.g. betas, risk ratios, odds ratios) of the relationship between work factors and at-<lb/>work productivity were extracted from the final multivariable models (i.e. including all work factors and <lb/>confounders analysed in the study). No meta-analyses were performed because of the high degree of <lb/>heterogeneity between studies (e.g. different measures used for assessing work factors and at-work <lb/>productivity). Instead, the findings were summarised by (a) the number of times similar work factors were <lb/>assessed in different studies; (b) the number of times a statistically significant relationship with at-work <lb/>productivity was found at α&lt;.05; and (c) the direction of the relationship that was found. Comparable work <lb/>factors had to be assessed in at least three studies to be included in the quantitative synthesis. Moderate <lb/>evidence for a work factor was defined as 50-74% of the studies finding a significant effect in the same <lb/>direction, and strong evidence was defined as at least 75% of the studies finding a significant effect in the <lb/>same direction. In these definitions of moderate and strong evidence, no difference was made between <lb/>cross-sectional and longitudinal studies. However, results from longitudinal studies are described separately <lb/>in this paper for work factors for which strong or moderate evidence was found, and in case a longitudinal <lb/>study had found a significant relationship even though there was no strong or moderate evidence based on <lb/>the combination of studies. This was done as only longitudinal studies are able to provide insight into the <lb/>direction of relationships. <lb/>The second goal of the paper is to summarise the effect of health on the relationship between work <lb/>factors and at-work productivity. Therefore, data were abstracted from studies that looked at health in one <lb/>of three ways: (a) as mediator of the relationship between work factors and at-work productivity; (b) as <lb/>confounder of the relationship between work factors and at-work productivity; or (c) as moderator of the <lb/>relationship between work factors and at-work productivity. For the studies looking at mediation, <lb/>information was abstracted on the significant mediation paths that were found between work factors, health <lb/>and at-work productivity. For studies on confounding, the effect coefficients were compared of (a) the <lb/>relationship between a work factor and at-work productivity controlling for all other included work factors <lb/>and confounders except health; and (b) the relationship between a work factor and at-work productivity <lb/>controlling for all other included work factors and confounders including health. In case no information was <lb/>available on the separate confounding effect of health, authors were contacted to request this additional <lb/>information. For studies on moderation, information was abstracted on the difference in the relationship <lb/>between work factors and at-work productivity for people in good and bad health. <lb/></note>

Based on title and abstract screening, <lb/>2 249 studies were excluded, mostly because studies did not assess at-work productivity following the <lb/>inclusion criterion described above. Full-text reading of the 70 remaining studies resulted in a further <lb/>exclusion of 22 articles. Reasons for exclusion are presented in Figure 1. Thus, finally, 48 studies were <lb/>included in this paper. <lb/></body>

			<body>Characteristics of included studies <lb/>The main characteristics of the studies included in the analysis are summarised in Table 1. The <lb/>majority of the studies (79%) were published between 2010 and 2016 and conducted in various countries; <lb/>e.g. the US, Canada, Australia, Japan, Korea and several European countries. The number of participants <lb/>included in a study varied greatly, with the smallest study containing only 68 participants and the largest <lb/>study as many as 78 587 participants. Overall, 62% of the studies had more than 1 000 participants. In the <lb/>majority of studies, participants were recruited through one or several companies. Three studies used a <lb/>European survey and 13 studies recruited participants through national surveys or selected a nationally <lb/>representative sample. In eight studies, participants with a specific health problem were recruited; in three <lb/>studies this related to mental health problems and in five studies to physical health problems. <lb/>Table 1 also provides information on several methodological aspects of the included studies. Most <lb/>studies (77%) had a cross-sectional as opposed to a longitudinal design, which implies that drawing <lb/>conclusions on the direction of the relationship (i.e. the causality) between work factors and individual <lb/>at-work productivity remains difficult. Furthermore, 66% of the studies included four important <lb/>confounders, i.e. age, gender, health (either physical or mental) and educational level/skill level. Of the 31 <lb/>studies (66% of all included studies) that reported the response rate, 35% had a response rate below 50%. <lb/>Finally, the large majority of the studies (85%) had sufficient power for the analyses that were conducted. <lb/>Instruments to assess at-work productivity varied across studies. About half of the studies used one <lb/>self-report question on the number of days (mostly within a timeframe of 12 months) one had been at work <lb/>despite health problems, which is often referred to as &quot; presenteeism &quot; . Six studies assessed the percentage of <lb/>time people experienced difficulties with executing their work tasks due to health problems measured <lb/>through either the Work Role Functioning Questionnaire or the Work Limitations Questionnaire. There <lb/>were nine studies that assessed self-rated performance or productivity at work. Opposed to all other studies, <lb/>in these nine studies, no specific reference was made to the effect of health on at-work productivity. Table 2 <lb/>provides an overview of the different instruments to assess at-work productivity that were used, and <lb/>whether instruments specifically referred to health-related at-work productivity. <lb/></body>

			<body>Relationship between quality of the work environment and at-work productivity <lb/>Table 3 summarises the relationships that were identified in the included studies between work factors <lb/>and at-work productivity. Strong evidence 1 was found for a negative relationship between job stress and job <lb/>strain and at-work productivity and for a positive relationship between job rewards and productivity. <lb/>Moderate evidence 2 was found for a negative relationship between work-family conflict and at-work <lb/>productivity and for a positive relationship between fairness at work and social support from co-workers <lb/>and productivity. <lb/>Table 3 shows for each work factor the number of studies that had a longitudinal design and whether <lb/>these studies found a significant relationship between the work factor and individual at-work productivity: <lb/> For job strain, the only longitudinal study included in the analysis (study 16) showed that <lb/>presenteeism in 2004 was not explained by job strain in 2002. <lb/> The only longitudinal study on fairness at work (study 40) found a significant effect with at-work <lb/>productivity; participants scoring high on fairness (assessed as procedural justice) in 2009 and <lb/>2010 had significantly higher job performance scores in 2010 compared to participants scoring <lb/>low on fairness at both points in time. , <lb/> Two out of four longitudinal studies looking at &apos;social support from co-workers&apos; found a <lb/>significant relationship with at-work productivity. Low support from colleagues predicted reduced <lb/>work performance at 6 and 12 months follow-up (study 23); and co-worker support in 2008 was <lb/>positively related to job performance in 2009 (study 38). <lb/> For psychological job demands, only one out of five longitudinal studies included in the analysis <lb/>found a significant relationship with productivity; according to this study (study 30), job demands <lb/>at baseline increased the odds of presenteeism one year later and a change in job demands (from <lb/>baseline to 1-year follow-up) led to increased odds for presenteeism over time (from 1-year to 2-<lb/>year follow-up). However, this study did not control for at-work productivity at baseline (the four <lb/>studies that did not find an effect did control for this). <lb/> Similarly, of the six longitudinal studies that looked at the relationship between job control and at-<lb/>work productivity, four found no significant relationship between baseline job control and at-work <lb/>productivity at 2, 3, 6 or 12-month follow-up (study 1, study 3, study 23 and study 28). Again, <lb/>study 30 found a relationship (job control at baseline decreased the odds of presenteeism one year <lb/>later and a change in job control decreased the odds of presenteeism over time) and this finding <lb/>was confirmed by another study, which found that baseline job control predicted job performance <lb/>one year later (study 38). <lb/>For several work factors, different studies found results in the opposite direction. For example, for job <lb/>rewards four studies found a positive association with productivity and one study a negative association. <lb/>There might be obvious explanations for such seemingly conflicting findings. Positive work factors such as <lb/>job rewards, job control and good leadership may on the one hand contribute to employee wellbeing and as <lb/>such have a positive effect on productivity. On the other hand, a negative effect may be expected if people <lb/>experience health or other problems that interfere with their productivity, but try to keep going out of <lb/>loyalty for the good work conditions they experience. <lb/></body>

			<body>Similarly, increased worries on job insecurity could reduce productivity, but they could also stimulate <lb/>people to work harder to increase their chances of remaining in the organisation. Furthermore, in Table 3 <lb/>studies are combined that assess at-work productivity in different ways. About half of the studies assess at-<lb/>work productivity loss by requesting whether people had been at work while they should have stayed at <lb/>home because of health problems. High physical job demands may make it impossible to do one&apos;s work and <lb/>thus decrease the chances of turning up at work while experiencing health problems (i.e. this was classified <lb/>as a positive relationship with at-work productivity). On the other hand, in studies where self-assessed <lb/>performance was used as measure of at-work productivity, it would be more likely that physical demands <lb/>would lead to a lower assessment of performance (i.e. this was classified as a negative relationship with at-<lb/>work productivity).This is exactly what was found in the studies that included physical demands (and found <lb/>an effect) and thus explains the different direction of effects found for this work factor. <lb/>For a few work factors, no or only limited evidence was found for the relationship with at-work <lb/>productivity. This was especially for general job support and supervisor social support. This might seem <lb/>surprising given that research has shown that the supervisor-worker relationship can impact workers&apos; <lb/>wellbeing (Nielsen and Daniels, 2016; O&apos;Donnell, Berkman and Subramanian, 2012). Potentially, social <lb/>support measures do not capture the most relevant aspects of the supervisor-worker relationship for <lb/>productivity. For example, assessing whether a supervisor is overall &apos;concerned&apos;, &apos;helpful&apos; or &apos;encouraging&apos; <lb/>(as examples of items typically used to measure the supervisor-worker relationship) might be too general to <lb/>find a significant relationship with at-work productivity; it could be more informative to look in more detail at, <lb/>for example, whether a supervisor can be approached to discuss potential productivity problems without the <lb/>fear of being stigmatised and whether a supervisor is willing to change work conditions. The latter aspects are <lb/>rarely included in supervisor support scales. <lb/>Effect of health on the relationship between work factors and at-work productivity <lb/>There are three different ways in which the effect of health on the relationship between work factors <lb/>and at-work productivity are assessed (see Table 4): <lb/> First, five studies analysed whether the relationship between work factors and productivity was <lb/>explained by health, i.e. whether work factors are related to a decrease or increase in health which <lb/>in turn decreases or increases at-work productivity (also referred to as a mediation effect).For <lb/>example, low job control may deteriorate a worker&apos;s health, and that effect on health may, in turn, <lb/>reduce at-work productivity. <lb/> Second, eight studies provided information on whether the relationship between work factors and <lb/>productivity weakened or disappeared when controlling for the effect of health (i.e. taking health <lb/>as a confounder into account in the analysis). For example, a relationship between job strain and <lb/>at-work productivity might be (partly) due to the fact that people with job strain have poorer <lb/>health or that people with poor health experience higher job strain. While this seems similar to the <lb/>above mentioned mediation analyses, there is one important difference. With mediation analysis a <lb/>specific path is evaluated (in the six studies included it was the path: work factors influence health <lb/>and health influences productivity), while with confounding it is not investigated in what way <lb/>health &apos;interferes&apos; in the relationship, but only whether it does. In five studies, results on the <lb/>confounding effect of health were already included while in three cases the study authors <lb/>provided additional information to the authors of the present paper on results after controlling for <lb/>health (study number 19, 24 and 26). <lb/></body>

			<page>20 <lb/></page>

			<body> Third, there were two studies that investigated whether the effect of work factors on productivity <lb/>was different for people in good or bad health, often referred to as moderation analysis (in some <lb/>disciplines the terms interaction or effect-modification are more common). Specifically, studies <lb/>analysed the relationship between work factors and individual productivity separately for people <lb/>with bad and with good health. This allows identifying whether poor outcomes on work factors <lb/>are disadvantageous with regards to productivity to both people in bad and people in good health <lb/>or only to one of these groups. <lb/>Table 4. <lb/>Assessment of health in studies on mediation, confounding and moderation <lb/>Results of the mediation, confounding and moderation analyses are presented in Table 5. Due to the <lb/>limited number of studies, it remains difficult to draw firm conclusions for each individual work factor. For <lb/>most work factors, only one study was available. However, for job rewards, work-family imbalance and <lb/>workload two studies evaluated the mediation effect of health and both found an effect in the same <lb/>direction: poor work conditions are related to poorer health which in turn is related to decreased <lb/>productivity while at work, while good work conditions are related to good health which in turn leads to <lb/>increased productivity. Only for job strain and workplace bullying, a longitudinal study was found that <lb/>showed a significant mediation effect by health (study 34). This study found that baseline job strain and <lb/>workplace bullying were related to reduced job performance at one-year follow-up through increased <lb/>depression symptoms (from baseline to one-year follow-up): i.e. job strain and bullying resulted in <lb/>increased depression symptoms which in turn resulted in reduced job performance. <lb/>Study <lb/>Assessment of health <lb/>Arnold 2016 <lb/>General health status <lb/>Bubonya 2016 <lb/>Mental health assessed with the Mental Health Inventory 5 <lb/>Coutu 2015 <lb/>Psychological distressed assessed with the Psychological Distress Inventory <lb/>Demerouti 2008 <lb/>Burnout assessed with the Maslach Burnout Inventory <lb/> <lb/>Physical health assessed with five questions from the Swiss Health Survey on back pain, joint pain, <lb/>tiredness, sleeplessness and headache <lb/> <lb/>Emotional exhaustion assessed with one item &quot; feeling exhausted from work &quot; <lb/>Hansen 2008 <lb/>Health status was assessed by asking respondents whether they suffered from one or more diseases.

			<body>All eight studies providing information on the confounding effect of health found that health <lb/>influences the relationship between work factors and productivity. For most work factors (e.g. job demands, <lb/>job stress, rewards, work-family conflict) the relationship with productivity remained significant but the <lb/>relationship became weaker (i.e. attenuated) when including health in the equation. For a few factors the <lb/>relationship with productivity became stronger (e.g. effort, firm size, supervisory role, non-standard work <lb/>time, working hours) or lost significance completely (e.g. conflict and lack of recognition, cooperation with <lb/>colleagues, job strain, job support, workload). <lb/>Table 5. <lb/>Summary of mediation, confounding and moderation effects by health as reported in studies on <lb/>the relationships between work factors and at-work productivity <lb/>Work factors <lb/>No. of studies that <lb/>investigated <lb/>mediation a <lb/>No. of studies that <lb/>found an effect a <lb/>Pathway b <lb/>Community <lb/>1 <lb/>0 <lb/>-<lb/>Effort <lb/>1 <lb/>1 <lb/>Effort +  health - productivity -<lb/>Emotional labour <lb/>1 <lb/>1 <lb/>Emotional labour +  health - productivity -<lb/>Fairness <lb/>1 <lb/>0 <lb/>-<lb/>Job control <lb/>3 <lb/>1 <lb/>Control +  health +  productivity + <lb/>Job demands <lb/>2 (1) <lb/>0 <lb/>-<lb/>Job security <lb/>1 <lb/>0 <lb/>-<lb/>Job strain <lb/>1 (1) <lb/>1 (1) <lb/>Job strain +  health - productivity -<lb/>Organisational commitment <lb/>1 <lb/>0 <lb/>-<lb/>Pay, benefits &amp; job conditions <lb/>1 <lb/>1 <lb/>Conditions - health - productivity -<lb/>Job rewards <lb/>2 <lb/>2 <lb/>Rewards +  health +  productivity + <lb/>Resources &amp; communication <lb/>1 <lb/>0 <lb/>-<lb/>Supervisory style <lb/>1 <lb/>1 <lb/>Supervisory style +  health - productivity -<lb/>Values <lb/>1 <lb/>1 <lb/>Values +  health +  productivity + <lb/>Work-family imbalance <lb/>2 <lb/>2 <lb/>Imbalance +  health - productivity -<lb/>Workload <lb/>2 <lb/>2 <lb/>Workload +  health - productivity -<lb/>Workplace bullying <lb/>1 (1) <lb/>1 (1) <lb/>Bullying +  health - productivity -<lb/>Work relationships <lb/>1 <lb/>0 <lb/>-<lb/>Work factors <lb/>No. of studies that <lb/>investigated <lb/>confounding a <lb/>No. of studies that <lb/>found an effect a <lb/>Effect on relationship with productivity d <lb/></body>

For all work factors included in the two studies, the effect <lb/>of the work factor on productivity (be it positive or negative) was stronger for people in good health. Thus, <lb/>for example, increased job control was associated with a reduced risk of productivity loss, but this mattered <lb/>especially (study 33) or only (study 8) for people in good health. <lb/>Taking the latter finding into account, it could be expected that studies focusing on study populations <lb/>with specific health problems are less likely to find a relationship between work factors and at-work <lb/>productivity which in turn could have implications for the overall findings presented in this paper. Of the 43 <lb/>studies that provided the evidence for Table 3 eight studies included a study population with health <lb/>problems (see also Table 1). Three of the eight studies found no relationship between any of the included <lb/>work factors and productivity (study 11, study 14 and study 31). The other five studies found an effect for <lb/>only one or two out of the six to twelve work factors included. <lb/>DISCUSSION <lb/>This paper investigated the relationship between work factors and at-work productivity loss and the <lb/>effect of health on this relationship by reviewing research that has been conducted on this topic.

			<body>More consistency is needed in assessing at-work productivity <lb/>The relatively broad definition of at-work productivity (loss) allowed the inclusion of studies with <lb/>varying operationalisations. &apos;At-work productivity&apos; was defined as either (a) the amount of time a worker <lb/>was productive or able to function/perform well at work, or (b) the worker&apos;s rating of his/her own <lb/>performance/productivity/functioning at work. Among the 48 included studies, there were 14 different ways <lb/>in which at-work productivity (loss) was operationalized. This raises the question whether consensus is <lb/>needed on defining and assessing this outcome, especially when the aim is to design policies and identify <lb/>practices that influence worker productivity. <lb/>The majority of productivity instruments used in the studies tried to identify reduced at-work <lb/>productivity due to health problems specifically. Most frequently used was a single-item question on the <lb/>number of days one had gone to work despite health problems. Conceptually, there are two problems with <lb/>this single-item question when trying to capture at-work productivity. First, it implies that working while <lb/>experiencing health problems will result in productivity loss, or in other words that ill-health equals <lb/>inability to work. However, not all people experiencing health problems are unable to function or be <lb/>productive at work. As such, an item on working despite health problems could result in an overestimation <lb/>of productivity loss as going to work while experiencing health problems does not necessarily reduce <lb/>productivity. Second, the item implies that when one experiences ill-health, one should not go to work. In <lb/>several studies the item even included statements such as &apos;while you should have stayed at home&apos;. This <lb/>goes against scientific evidence that work is generally good for health (Dooley, Fielding and Levi, 1996; <lb/>Thomas, Benzeval and Stansfeld, 2005), and that it can be an important factor in a person&apos;s recovery <lb/>(OECD, 2012). Furthermore, many people with health problems emphasise that participating in work is <lb/>important to them (Saunders and Nedelec, 2014). Instead of asking people how many days they were at <lb/>work despite of health problems, an operationalization such as the one used in study 43 by Plaisier et al. <lb/>(2012), would be preferable. Here it was asked how many working days a respondent experienced <lb/>hindrance by health problems, followed by an assessment of the person&apos;s efficiency on these days. <lb/>Similarly, questionnaires like the Work Role Functioning Questionnaire and Work Limitations <lb/>Questionnaire result in an overall score representing the percentage of time one was not able to function <lb/>well at work specifically due to health problems (according to the respondent). Such multiple-item <lb/>questionnaires provide more detailed information on specific tasks for which people experienced work <lb/>functioning problems and can provide more direction for interventions by occupational health providers or <lb/>employment counsellors. <lb/>About one-third of the studies used a single-item instrument inquiring a worker&apos;s overall performance <lb/>or productivity at work, mostly on a scale from 0 to 10, regardless of health problems. These instruments <lb/>provide a straightforward assessment of one&apos;s self-perceived performance or productivity at work but no <lb/>information on what the specific productivity problems are and where interventions could focus on. <lb/>The use of different operationalisations and instruments to assess at-work productivity may influence the <lb/>relationships one finds between work factors and at-work productivity. In this regard, a study by Johns (2011) <lb/>which included different instruments to assess at-work productivity loss – a single item on presenteeism days <lb/>but also the multiple-item Work Limitations Questionnaire (WLQ) and the Stanford Presenteeism Scale (SPS) <lb/>– has provided interesting insights. While relationships between the work factors and the different outcome <lb/>measures were in the same direction, differences were found in their strength and statistical significance; for <lb/>instance, &apos;pay equity&apos; was significantly associated with the single item on presenteeism days but not with the <lb/>WLQ and SPS, while &apos;family and work conflict&apos; was significantly related to the WLQ and SPS but not to the <lb/>presenteeism item. Based on this one paper, however, it is difficult to provide strong explanations for these <lb/>different results, highlighting the need for more research to look into this. <lb/></body>

			<body>To conclude, when choosing an instrument to assess at-work productivity, it is important to take into <lb/>account what the goal of the analysis is. For example, when assessing how productive people are at work, a <lb/>single question about the number of days someone went to work despite health problems is not useful as it <lb/>does not provide information on whether the person was productive. Including an assessment of whether <lb/>one was also hindered by health problems and an estimation of the amount of hindrance would be essential. <lb/>When the goal is to measure how to influence productivity, multiple-item measures identifying which types <lb/>of work tasks are most problematic would be more informative. Consensus about the use of one particular <lb/>instrument is not essential, but using the same instrument when having a similar goal would improve <lb/>comparability across settings. <lb/>Quality of the work environment influences at-work productivity <lb/>A first conclusion that can be drawn from the largely cross-sectional studies reviewed in this paper is that <lb/>several work factors have shown to be related to productivity. There was strong evidence for a relationship <lb/>with job stress, job rewards and job strain and moderate evidence for a relationship with work-family conflict, <lb/>fairness at work and social support from co-workers. The limited number of longitudinal studies and the <lb/>differing results of these studies (i.e. some did and others did not find a longitudinal relationship between a <lb/>work factor and at-work productivity) did not allow clear conclusions on the causal pathways. As such, <lb/>separate look at these longitudinal studies did not change the overall conclusion that there is evidence that <lb/>several work factors are related to at-work productivity. Second, not for all work factors that have been <lb/>theoretically linked with worker productivity, following the dominant Job Demands Resources (JD-R) and <lb/>Effort Reward Imbalance (ERI) models, supportive evidence was found. For example, there was no clear <lb/>evidence for a unique relationship between job demands or job control (an important job resource in the JD-R <lb/>model) and at-work productivity, while this is being hypothesized in JD-R theory (Bakker and Demerouti, <lb/>2016). However, in line with JD-R theory, job strain, i.e. the combination of high job demands and low job <lb/>resources, did show a significant relationship with at-work productivity in several cross-sectional studies. <lb/>Another finding is that for general job support and supervisor support, most studies did not find any <lb/>relationship. This is surprising as qualitative studies (e.g. interviews with workers) have shown that the <lb/>supervisor-worker relationship is important for workers&apos; functioning at work, especially for people with health <lb/>problems (Hjarsbech, Nielsen, Andersen, Rugulies and Christensen, 2015; Andersen, Nielsen and Brinkmann <lb/>2012). The question arises whether other ways to assess this relationship are needed. <lb/>While more longitudinal research is needed to confirm a causal pathway between the work factors <lb/>reported in this paper and at-work productivity, an important implication for policy and practice is that <lb/>more attention is needed for the quality of work and the inherent interplay between the individual and its <lb/>work context. At this moment, country policies and worker support practices do not take this into account. <lb/>First, in many OECD countries, workplace policies primarily focus on physical unsafe and unhealthy work <lb/>conditions. The identification of psychosocial workplace risks from the perspective of the individual worker <lb/>(e.g. fairness of organisational policies and job stain) is rarely included in workplace legislation and where <lb/>it is, it generally plays a limited role in practice (OECD, 2015). However, this paper has shown that these <lb/>factors matter for productivity. Furthermore, there is a body of evidence showing the importance of such <lb/>factors for workers&apos; health (Bakker and Demerouti, 2016) (Schaufeli and Taris, 2014). Second, while <lb/>workplace policies are directed at the (physical) works environment, the available interventions for <lb/>improving worker wellbeing and productivity are often (narrowly) focused on the individual worker, for <lb/>example by trying to improve resilience, stress management or coping skills (Ebert et al., 2016; Jamieson <lb/>and Tuckey, 2016). Here, the interaction between the worker and its work environment is missing as well. <lb/>More attention is needed for how workers perceive the quality of their work environment and how policies <lb/>and practices at both the level of the worker and the work environment may positively influence this. <lb/></body>

			<body>When drawing conclusions on the relationship between the quality of the work environment and <lb/>productivity based on this paper, several limitations need to be taken into account. First, as mentioned, only <lb/>11 studies had a longitudinal design, which inhibits conclusions on a causal relationship between work <lb/>factors and at-work productivity. Also, the direction of causation sometimes remains unclear. For some <lb/>work factors a reversed causal pathway could be hypothesised. For example, one could imagine that <lb/>increased productivity may lead to increased job rewards just as well as increased job rewards could lead to <lb/>increased productivity. Furthermore, the designs of the longitudinal studies that were included had some <lb/>limitations. For example, most of these studies had quite a short follow-up period of one year. Also, <lb/>baseline assessments of at-work productivity were not always included, but this is essential to investigate <lb/>causal pathways between work factors and productivity. In a similar vein, work factors were often only <lb/>assessed at baseline, while these factors should be repeatedly measured as the experience of quality of the <lb/>work environment may fluctuate over time. <lb/>Second, studies used different instruments to assess productivity and the various work factors, include <lb/>different study populations and use different covariates in their analyses. This heterogeneity in studies <lb/>reduces comparability and may explain why for some work factors different studies found opposite results. <lb/>As discussed above, the study by Johns (2011) showed that relationships between work factors and at-work <lb/>productivity varied for different measures of at-work productivity. Other studies found that the relationship <lb/>between work factors and at-work productivity varies for different subgroups of participants, such as <lb/>workers differing in tenure or type of occupation, or for different countries (Claes, 2011; Jourdain and <lb/>Vézina, 2014; Jacobs et al. 2007). However, there were too few studies to derive meaningful conclusions <lb/>when splitting results further for, e.g., similar at-work productivity measures. This is why for this paper it <lb/>was chosen to combine the results of all studies and to evaluate whether some broad conclusions on the <lb/>relevance of the quality of the work environment for at-work productivity could be drawn. Third, several <lb/>work factors were investigated in only a few studies, including those for which strong evidence was found. <lb/>It is important to have these work factors included in future research, to evaluate whether their relevance for <lb/>at-work productivity also shows in other settings. <lb/>Work policies need to include a health perspective <lb/>All 14 studies that investigated the impact of health on the relationship between the quality of the work <lb/>environment and productivity showed that health indeed matters. Policies must reflect that finding: policies <lb/>aimed at improving the quality of the work environment so to improve worker productivity must also take <lb/>workers&apos; health into account. <lb/>Especially interesting are the comparable findings of the two studies looking at the moderating effect <lb/>of health on the relationship between work factors and at-work productivity. These studies show that the <lb/>relationship between positive work factors (e.g. job control) or negative work factors (e.g. job stress) and <lb/>productivity is strongest for people in good health. This is an important finding because it suggests that the <lb/>quality of the work environment matters for reasons that go beyond its negative effects on workers&apos; health. <lb/></body>

			<body>For some work factors, the relationship with productivity even ceases to exist for people in bad health. <lb/>The lack of a relationship between the quality of the work environment and productivity for people in bad <lb/>health has important implications for research and policy. If the relationship between work factors and <lb/>productivity is solely investigated within study populations dealing with health problems, chances of finding <lb/>significant associations may be smaller. Of the five studies included in this paper with study populations with <lb/>health problems, three studies found no effect for any of the work factors. This could one lead to conclude that <lb/>the quality of the work environment does not matter for productivity. But this would be incorrect, as studies in <lb/>this paper for general populations show a connection between several work factors and productivity. <lb/>Furthermore, research has shown that many people with health problems have difficulty in remaining <lb/>productive at work (Aronsson, Gustafsson and Dallner, 2000; OECD, 2012). Thus, good work conditions <lb/>alone seem insufficient for workers with health problems to ensure a productive working life. <lb/>However, many of the studies included in this paper show that health-related factors (e.g. chronic diseases, <lb/>general health, or mental distress) were also significantly related to at-work productivity, thereby confirming the <lb/>need for multidisciplinary approaches to support worker productivity. In line with this, work by the OECD on <lb/>Mental Health and Work has shown that workplace policies for people with mental health problems should not <lb/>only focus on improving the psychosocial quality of work, but also have a focus on keeping people in work and <lb/>helping them return to work quickly when they are ill. For both of these aims, integrated health and work support <lb/>is critical (OECD, 2015). Neither can underlying health issues remain unaddressed, nor can health professionals <lb/>ignore the underlying workplace issues. An adequate policy response should also include tackling stigma at the <lb/>workplace associated with health problems to ensure that people feel comfortable discussing potential support <lb/>measures that could help them remain productive at work. <lb/>Conclusion <lb/>To improve our understanding of the relationship between the quality of the work environment and at-<lb/>work productivity and to be able to use the findings to support people (with and without health problems) to <lb/>remain productive at work, several developments in research and policy are indicated. First, more longitudinal <lb/>studies that overcome the limitations addressed above are needed to improve the evidence base and to clarify <lb/>the causal relationship between various factors of the quality of the work environment, health and <lb/>productivity. Second, when studying productivity, researchers or policy makers need to be clear about what <lb/>they want to measure, e.g. overall productivity or performance or health-related productivity loss. If the goal is <lb/>to intervene on reduced productivity, a measurement instrument is needed that can indicate in which areas <lb/>productivity problems are experienced and picks up change over time. Thirdly, this paper provides direction <lb/>for the work factors that could be explored further in terms of their effect on productivity and interventions <lb/>addressing these factors that would improve productivity. Fourthly, attention should be paid to the interaction <lb/>between the individual and the workplace environment, especially for people with health problems who <lb/>appear to benefit less from a good quality work environment than people without health problems. For those <lb/>people, support measures addressing both workplace and health issues are essential. <lb/></body>
