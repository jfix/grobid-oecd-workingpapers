INDICATORS Jan van Steen* ABSTRACT This paper presents the outline and first results of an OECD project, undertaken under the auspices of 
the Working Party of National Experts on Science and Technology Indicators (NESTI), on the 
development and collection of internationally comparable indicators on public funding of R&D. Direct 
funding of R&D is one of the main policy instruments used by governments to support science and 
innovation in priority areas. As noted in the OECD Innovation Strategy, countries are restructuring and 
adapting their research-financing mechanisms, for example by creating new agencies in charge of 
allocating resources, making greater use of competitively awarded project funding and exploring how to tie 
funding more closely to specific objectives and missions, increasing the focus on the quality and relevance 
of institutions' research activities in pursuit of research excellence and economic and social impact. These 
changes highlight a gap in the range of available indicators to monitor how public funding of R&D is 
allocated. As a result, the NESTI project aims to propose a methodology for internationally comparable 
indicators on modes of public funding; collecting such indicators and assessing the feasibility of extending 
their scope by developing guidelines for the implementation of the methodology as part of the regular 
indicator activities of OECD and other organisations like Eurostat. Reflecting the evidence priorities highlighted above, this project has focused on drawing a distinction 
between institutional and project funding. This distinction has been applied to estimates of funding levels 
across sector of R&D performance, types of funding agencies and the orientation of the R&D from the 
funders' perspective. This paper presents the results of the data collection across 18 participating countries, demonstrating 
that it is possible to produce new policy relevant indicators on public funding of R&D in addition to those 
envisaged in the OECD Frascati Manual. The data collection initial findings highlight interesting 
differences across countries in terms of their approaches to funding R&D. But before conclusions can be 
drawn on the effectiveness of the different country funding profiles, further work is needed in order to 
increase the reliability and comparability of the different indicators. * The author wishes to thank Pierre Therrien and Fernando Galindo-Rueda for their valuable advice in producing this Working Paper. DSTI/DOC(2012)4 5 MODES DE FINANCEMENT PUBLIC DE LA R-D : 
VERS DES INDICATEURS COMPARABLES À L'ÉCHELLE INTERNATIONALE Jan van Steen* RÉSUMÉ Ce document présente les grandes lignes et les premiers résultats d'un projet de l'OCDE pour le 
développement et la collecte d'indicateurs comparables à l'échelle internationale sur le financement public 
de la R&D, réalisé sous l'égide du Groupe des Experts Nationaux sur les Indicateurs de la Science et de la 
Technologie (GENIST). Le financement direct de la R-D est l'un des principaux instruments utilisés par 
les pouvoirs publics pour soutenir la science et l'innovation dans les domaines prioritaires. Comme le 
prévoit la Stratégie de l'OCDE pour l'innovation, les pays opèrent une restructuration et un 
réaménagement de leurs mécanismes de financement de la recherche, par exemple en instituant de 
nouveaux organes chargés de l'allocation des ressources, en faisant davantage jouer la concurrence pour 
l'octroi de fonds aux projets de recherche, en cherchant les moyens d'établir un lien plus direct entre le 
financement et des objectifs et des missions spécifiques, en privilégiant davantage la qualité et la 
pertinence des activités de recherche des établissements, au regard de critères d'excellence et d'impact 
social et économique de la recherche. Ces évolutions ont mis en évidence l'insuffisance de la gamme 
d'indicateurs disponibles pour analyser la manière dont sont affectées les aides publiques à la recherche. 
Le projet du GENIST a par conséquent pour objet : de proposer une méthodologie pour le développement 
d'indicateurs comparables au niveau international sur les modalités de l'aide publique ; de collecter ces 
indicateurs ; d'évaluer dans quelle mesure on pourra intégrer d'autres pays ; et de mettre au point des 
lignes directrices pour l'application de cette méthodologie dans le cadre des activités régulières 
d'indicateurs de l'OCDE et d'autres organisations, comme Eurostat. Compte tenu de ces besoins prioritaires en matière de données, ce projet s'est axé sur l'établissement 
d'une distinction entre financement par établissement et financement par projets. Cette distinction a été 
appliquée aux estimations de niveaux de financement pour tous les secteurs d'exécution de la R&D, pour 
toutes les catégories d'organismes de financement et pour toutes orientations de la R&D du point de vue 
des bailleurs de fonds. Ce document présente les résultats de la campagne de collecte de données réalisée dans les dix-huit 
pays participants et montre qu'il est possible de produire certains indicateurs pertinents pour les politiques 
publiques sur le financement public de la R&D qui ne figurent pas dans le Manuel de Frascati. Les 
premières constatations issues de la collecte de données mettent en évidence d'intéressantes différences 
entre les pays dans leur approche du financement de la R&D. Mais avant de pouvoir tirer des conclusions 
sur l'efficacité des différents modèles nationaux de financement, il faut peaufiner les différents indicateurs 
de manière à améliorer leur fiabilité et leur comparabilité. * L'auteur remercie Pierre Therrien et Fernando Galindo-Rueda pour leurs précieux conseils pour l'élaboration de ce document de travail. DSTI/DOC(2012)4 6 MODES OF PUBLIC FUNDING OF R&D: TOWARDS INTERNATIONALLY COMPARABLE 
INDICATORS Introduction Within national R&D systems, government funding is an important source of finance for R&D. As 
Figure 1 shows, for most countries it is the second major source of funds and the main one for a small 
minority. The percentage of Gross Domestic Expenditure on R&D (GERD) financed by government 
ranges between 14 and 70%, with an average of 30 to 35%. Alongside other policies, the funding of private 
or public research is one of the main instruments a government can use to promote science and research. 
There are significant differences in the way governments fund and regulate their research organisations. 
For example: in some countries research organisations like higher education institutions have a large 
autonomy, while other countries are characterised by a relationship between the government as funder of 
R&D and R&D performing research organisations, which is regulated by performance contracts. Figure 1. Government funded R&D as a percentage of total R&D (GERD), 2008 (or latest year) 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 Source: OECD Main Science and Technology Indicators, January 2012. The OECD Innovation Strategy (OECD, 2010a) has shown that countries are restructuring and 
adapting their research-financing mechanisms, for example by creating new agencies in charge of 
allocating resources, making greater user of competitively awarded project funding and exploring how to 
tie funding more closely to specific objectives and missions, increasing the focus on the quality and 
relevance of institutions' research activities in pursuit of research excellence and economic and social 
impact. These changes highlight a gap in the range of available indicators to monitor how public funding 
of R&D is allocated. DSTI/DOC(2012)4 7 In the framework of the OECD Frascati Manual (OECD, 2002), funding of R&D by the government 
is measured is two ways: a) by asking performers of R&D across different sectors (business enterprises, 
higher education, research institutes and private non profit) to specify the sources of funds – and 
government in particular – for in-house (intramural) expenditures on R&D; and b) by adopting a funder 
perspective collecting data on government budget appropriations or outlays for R&D (GBAORD). The 
latter thus involves the analysis of government budgets and complementary sources. Countries follow both 
approaches and data under both formats are covered in the Frascati Manual (OECD, 2002) and have been 
collected for a large number of years by OECD and EUROSTAT. The funder-based data are mainly 
classified by socio-economic objectives (SEO) according to the so-called NABS-classification 
(Nomenclature for the Analysis and Comparison of Scientific Programmes and Budgets). GBAORD 
data and their collection are described in Chapter 8 of the Frascati Manual (OECD, 2002). Because of the 
different perspectives of data collection, the two data sets provide different types of policy-relevant 
information. At the moment, only a limited number of statistics and indicators on public funding are available, 
principally government-funded R&D in the different sectors of performance and government R&D budgets 
classified by socio-economic objectives. There is a widespread perception that the available indicators on 
public funding do not align with the discussions and issues in actual science policy and the characteristics 
of the science systems in the different countries (Lepori et al., 2007a). Lepori (2006) argues that the R&D 
statistical data have  " …. limitations due to the lack of categories and classifications that would be needed 
for policy analysis " . According to his vision, the design of the R&D statistical system is  " …focusing on 
input rather than on fluxes and producing national aggregates rather than data on sectors or on individual 
organizations " . In addition, the use of GBAORD data is not as common as that of performer based data 
collected for the purposes of producing indicators of intramural expenditures, and international 
comparisons are somewhat infrequent. No information is collected on funding agencies and instruments. 
Because of the limited number of policy studies on the public funding of R&D, researchers within the EU 
Policies for Research and Innovation in the Move towards the European Research Area (PRIME) Network 
of Excellence on research and innovation policy undertook an international study on the public funding of 
R&D projects and their cross-country comparability. The results of this study have been published in a 
number 
of 
country 
reports 
and 
scientific 
articles, 
available 
on 
www.enid-
europe.org/PRIME/project_funding.html. At the 2008 Working Party of National Experts on Science and Technology Indicators (NESTI) 
meeting, countries agreed to start an exploratory pilot project on developing indicators of public funding of 
R&D, drawing on the findings of the EU PRIME Network. A number of countries were willing and able to 
participate in the project led by the Netherlands. 1 The general aim of the project was briefly formulated as 
follows:  " to collect data on modes of public funding " . Modes of public funding refer to the different ways 
public funding is allocated in the R&D system to beneficiaries, the organisations responsible for funding 
decisions and the instruments used. The project was initially envisaged with three specific aims: a) to propose a methodology for 
internationally comparable indicators on public funding modes; b) to collect such indicators; c) to broaden 
the scope of the project beyond the scope of the participating countries, to develop guidelines for the 
implementation of the methodology on a larger scale and on a permanent basis as part of the regular 
indicator activities of the international organisations OECD and EUROSTAT. It should eventually lead to 
a revision of the Frascati Manual. The present paper focuses on the first two aims. This document is structured as follows. Firstly, the rationale for new indicators and the conceptual 
framework are set out. The description of the data collection process then gives way to the analysis of the 
various indicators collected on public funding modes. It is important to note that the reported indicators are 
experimental and, as a result, international comparability is still limited. The paper concludes with a DSTI/DOC(2012)4 8 summary review of the key issues encountered in collecting and comparing the data, leading to a final set 
of recommendations for follow-up work. Annex 1 provides an overview of the definitions adopted 
throughout the project, while Annex 2 sets out the indicators collected from participating countries. Annex 
3 summarises the metadata collected from countries, highlighting some of the differences regarding data 
availability and potential comparability. Modelling public funding of R&D through new indicators The existing indicators on public funding of R&D have a long tradition, particularly those providing a 
breakdown of budget allocations across different socio-economic objectives (SEO), although by focusing 
on direct funding they do not capture the full range of funding instruments, excluding for example R&D 
tax incentives – which are the object of separate regular collection by NESTI – and other indirect 
mechanisms. Because governments on average are the second main funder of R&D in the different 
countries of the OECD with an average of 28% of total R&D, budget allocations across dimensions other 
than explicit socioeconomic objectives can have major impact on the way the national research systems are 
organised and ultimately on their performance. Governmental research and science policy has evolved over 
the years, reflecting debates on key policy issues such as the balance between institutional and project 
funding and the balance between competitive versus non-competitive funding. While public R&D funding 
is one of the major instruments for steering the research system, many OECD countries introduced reforms 
of their funding system to respond to new societal demands and challenges (Maass, 2003). New funding 
schemes and instruments were developed and implemented, such as performance-based and competitive 
funding programmes, the promotion of co-operation with the private sector, new centres of excellence, new 
foundations and new problem-oriented research programmes. Throughout this project, a simplified model of public R&D funding flows has been used (Figure 1). 
The model has three different layers. The indicators developed relate to these different levels. a) The government or state level with its institutional funding of R&D, to business enterprises, higher 
education institutions or research institutes and project funding via a number of intermediary 
organisations. These funding modes or general institutional funds refer to so-called block funds 
that are allocated to research performing institutions with generally no strings attached on the one 
hand (institutional funding) and funding based on grants from some kind of competitive funding 
on the other (project funding). These funding modes also include the flow of funds going abroad, 
either to performing organisations or international bodies that distribute those funds. b) An intermediary level of organisations tasked with redistributing and allocating the R&D funds to 
the final beneficiaries. These organisations typically have some degree of operational 
independence even if they may be formally part of governments. This level includes the 
international funding agencies too. This includes national funding and international funding 
agencies. c) The level with organisations performing R&D, which can be grouped into four R&D sectors of 
performance (business enterprises, higher education, government and private non-profit) alongside 
organisations and institutes and (research) organisations abroad. The latter category also includes 
extra-territorial organisations with activities located within the funding country (for a description 
of these sectors, see the OECD Frascati Manual (OECD, 2002) sections 3.4 through to 3.7). DSTI/DOC(2012)4 9 Figure 1. An overall funding model Source: Based on Lepori et. al. (2007b) The key new classification for data collection on government R&D funding introduced in this project 
is based on the distinction between institutional funding and project funding. In the PRIME project, the 
concept of project funding was defined as:  " money attributed to a group or an individual to perform a R&D 
activity limited in scope, budget and time, normally on the basis of the submission of a project proposal 
describing the research activities to be done "  (Lepori et al., 2007b). It is important to highlight that the 
concept of project funding does not primarily rely on funds being allocated on competition between 
researchers or research groups, which is based on the submission of a research proposal. The main criteria 
to distinguish between project 2 and institutional funding instruments are as follows: @BULLET The aim of the funding instrument (from the perspective of the funding authority), rather than the 
effective use of funds for R&D activities. @BULLET The existence of an agency tasked with selecting the project(s) to be funded and allocating the 
money to R&D performing beneficiaries. The agency can have a variety of forms such as a unit 
within a ministry, or arms-length bodies such as research council or regional authorities. In contrast, institutional funding can be defined as the funding of institutions with no direct 
selection of projects or programmes to be performed. Under this type of funding, it is the receiving 
institution that has discretion over the R&D projects that are to be performed, not the funding organisation. This project has considered classifications of funders and performers 3 which are consistent with the 
Frascati Manual. A first distinction has been made between national and international funders and 
performers. Government National funding agencies Higher education sector Government sector Business enterprise sector Internal

project has introduced a classification covering a range of different funding agencies. These 
include research and higher education ministries, other ministries, independent agencies and 
regional authorities. @BULLET Destination of the funding: national versus international performers. Within the former, business 
enterprises, higher education, government and private non profit are considered. Table 1. Overview of public funding modes by key dimensions GBAORD National public funding

national and international funding and national and international performers. The different indicators to be 
collected can be related to the different cells of the table. Box 1 presents some examples of the different

In the case of ESA, the membership fee is treated as project funding, since ESA redistributes this in the form of 
project funding, based on agreed  " retour "  principles, and in this sense differs from the membership fee of the EU.

It would 
encompass contributions from international organisations to national performers on an institutional basis. DSTI/DOC(2012)4 12 In addition to the distinction between project and institutional funding and the national versus 
international dimension, this project has also introduced a new classification for the type of government 
instruments funding R&D. This  " instrument type "  classification is based on the primary purpose or 
objective pursued by Government in providing funding, on the basis of the likely use of the knowledge 
supported by the funds. This classification is described in Box 2. Box 2. Examples of other funding taxonomies – instrument types @BULLET Academic instruments The primary purpose of these instruments is the advancement of knowledge for the general 
benefit of society. Funding can be provided by different funding agencies, such as contributions 
from an independent or arms-length agency, e.g. project funding from a research council funding 
research programmes or projects based on bottom-up proposals from researchers, except research 
oriented programmes with clear politics aims. But it can be funding from other agencies too. @BULLET Policy instruments The primary purpose of these instruments is the contribution of commissioned research from 
ministries or an independent or arms-length agencies' funding programmes to inform and support 
policy decisions or to fund programmes for knowledge generation within priority policy areas. @BULLET Innovation instruments The primary purpose of these instruments is the contribution to the innovative capacity of 
enterprises through R&D. Contributions from ministries of economic affairs or innovation agencies 
to business R&D programmes typically feature under this category. Data collection and data sources used Different indicators were developed in the project which are related to the different cells or funding 
modes of the table. The questionnaire which was used for the data collection at the end of 2009 was based 
on the following five indicators on public funding: 1. National public funding by funding type and destination (national and international performers); 
related to funding modes (1), (2), (3) and (4). 2. National public funding to national performers by funding type and sector of performance; 
related to funding modes (1)and (2). 3. Public project funding to national performers by funding agency; related to funding 
modes (1)and (5). 4. National public project funding to national performers by instrument; related to funding mode 
(1). 5. International funding to national performers by sector of performance; related to funding modes 
(5)and (6). In order to construct the indicators, data were collected from countries participating in the project on a 
voluntary basis. Data were requested for three years: 2000, 2005 and 2008 (or nearest year) as set out in 
Annex 2, using the definitions provided in Annex 1. Based on a common format and pre-defined questions, 
countries were also asked to provide metadata on the data collection: information on some characteristics 
of the data source, examples of institutional funding and funding agencies and methodological problems 
encountered. The results are summarised in Annex 3. DSTI/DOC(2012)4 13 As can be seen from the country metadata, the national GBAORD data collection is the main data 
source in all countries, with budget items as the basic unit of analysis in most cases. These basic units were 
classified according to the different variables within the questionnaire. In a number of cases the 
classification was done on the basis of relevant complementary documents or information from external 
experts. In some cases, the statistical agencies had to send information requests to experts in ministries or 
other research funding bodies in order to obtain the relevant budget information for the classification. The indicators of public funding modes: relevance, definitions used and descriptive analysis This section presents the five indicators, describing in some detail on a one by one basis their 
relevance, the definitions used, the resulting data and emerging results. Indicator 1: National public funding by funding type and destination (national or international 
performers) The indicator focuses on total GBAORD within a country. It includes national and international 
performers funding, which can be either project funding or institutional funding. This indicator relates to 
the funding modes (1), (2), (3) and (4) of Table 1. Relevance The indicator is oriented to national public policies on research funding. It characterises the 
organisation of national public funding, the distribution over different funding categories and the relative 
contribution of institutional funding vis à vis project-based funding. This indicator can be used in principle 
for snapshot cross-country comparisons. If longitudinal data are available, it can be used to show shifts in 
the composition of national public funding, such as a shift from institutional funding to project funding. Definitions used National public funding comprises national public project funding and national public institutional 
funding. The latter can be divided into institutional funding to the higher education sector – via the 
estimated portion of General University Fund (GUF) devoted to R&D – and institutional funding to other 
public organisations or private companies. Project funding has no further sub-classification. Data and results Full data on this indicator are available for 17 countries, and partial information is available for one 
additional country. Figure 3 shows the distribution of total national funding by all different funding modes 
and destinations, national as well as international. Total national funding equals GBAORD for all 
countries. Table 2 and Figure 4 focus on the funding to national performers. Table 2 shows the development of 
the share of project funding for 2000, 2005 and 2008 and Figure 4 focuses on the share of GUF in total 
institutional funding to national performers. DSTI/DOC(2012)4 14 Figure 3. National public funding by funding type, 2008 As a percentage of total funding 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 NZL KOR BEL FIN IRL AUS CZE NOR SVK ISR CAN DEU POL AUT NLD DNK CHE SWE National project funding

of national public institutional funding to national performers Source: OECD, based on experimental data collection from the NESTI project on public R&D funding, September 2010. Main findings @BULLET Public R&D funding schemes vary widely between countries. Countries such as Switzerland, 
Denmark, the Netherlands, Austria and Poland rely mainly on institutional funding (at a level of 
around 70%), while Ireland, Belgium, and New Zealand devote more than 50% of public funding 
to project funding. @BULLET In the period 2000-2008 there seems to be a relative stability between modes of public R&D 
funding for most countries (at least for the countries with data for more than one year). 
Exceptions are Australia and Austria where the share of project funding increases sharply. But 
when one looks at the range of countries for which data were collected as part of the PRIME 
project on public project funding 4 the long-term trend of public R&D funding seems to show an 
increase in project funding at the expense of institutional funding (Lepori et. al. (2007b)). The 
data for the countries participating both in the PRIME project and in the OECD project (Austria, 
Norway, Switzerland, the Netherlands) show that all countries experienced a considerable 
increase in the share of project funding over the period 1970-2002. In Figure 5, longitudinal data 
for Australia and the Netherlands shows a sharp increase in the share of project funding for 
Australia after 2000. The project share for the Netherlands increases between 1975 and 1990 and 
remained broadly stable since after an initial decline in the early 1990s. @BULLET In half of the countries institutional funding of universities (GUF) takes up an important part of 
total institutional funding, with a share above 50%, even up to 94% in Denmark. In the other 
countries GUF plays a more modest role. However, the data should be treated with some caution, 
because as is well known, not all countries can identify GUF separately (e.g. Korea) and the 
methods applied can also differ. @BULLET National public funding to international research organizations seems to be a minor component of 
national public R&D funding (usually less than 5%) except for Switzerland and Belgium, which 
devote more than 10% of their public R&D funding to such international organizations. DSTI/DOC(2012)4 16 @BULLET Although international project funding from abroad is an important funding source in a number 
of countries (> 10% of total R&D in a country) and should be considered when dealing with 
funding issues, this indicator excludes international funding in terms of funding from abroad. The 
indicator is restricted to national public funding sources of R&D. Funding from abroad is 
considered in indicators 3 and 5. Figure 2. Figure 5. National public project funding to national performers

the Rathenau Institute based on data from the Dutch Ministry of Education, Culture and Science. Indicator 2: National public funding to national performers by funding type and sector of performance This indicator focuses on GBAORD funding to national performers. It follows the taxonomy adopted 
for indicator 1 (funding type) but disaggregated further by the R&D sector of performance. This indicator 
relates to the funding modes (1) and (2). Relevance The indicator is intended to illustrate how governments support different types of national R&D 
performers through different mechanisms, highlighting for example the extent to which support for higher 
education is mainly institutional or project-focused, compared with other sectors Definitions used National public project funding to national performers and national public institutional funding to 
national performers. The national sector of performance is defined according to the Frascati Manual 
definitions: business enterprise sector, higher education sector, government sector and private non profit 
sector. DSTI/DOC(2012)4 17 Data and results Data on this indicator are available for 15 countries. Figure 6 shows the allocation of national public 
funds to national performers separately for both project and institutional funding. This indicator excludes 
international public funding (funds from abroad). This funding is considered in indicators 3 and 5. The 
indicator also excludes national funding to international organisations and other funding of R&D abroad. 5 
It is therefore restricted to national public funding sources of R&D. Main findings @BULLET The higher education sector is the main destination of institutional funding (mostly through GUF 
funding). In nine countries this sector accounts for more than half of institutional funds. 
However, there are also a number of countries with a substantial share of institutional funding 
allocated to the government sector: Korea, Czech Republic, Belgium, Poland and Australia 
allocate more than 50% of their institutional funds to this sector. The cases of institutional 
funding to the business enterprise sector are rare, but exist in the Czech Republic, Israel and 
Austria. In these countries the share of institutional funding in the business enterprise sector 
ranges between 1% and 6%. In four other countries the share is 1%, while in the rest there is no 
institutional funding to businesses. The exact nature of this funding should be further 
investigated. @BULLET The sector of destination of project funding is more diversified. However, the public sector 
(broadly defined in this case as the combination of higher education and government) has the 
largest share in the majority of countries, with the exception of Austria (where the share of 
businesses is 63%). However, in quite a number of countries (ten) the share of business 
enterprises is significant (20% or more). @BULLET Data for this indicator should be treated with caution, because the allocation of budget items to 
one of the sectors is not always clear, and some budget items can have multiple performers, in the 
public as well as in the private sector. DSTI/DOC(2012)4 18 Figure 6. National public funding to national performers by funding type and sector of performance (%), 2008 Total funding 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 Higher education

funding that is less than 50%. @BULLET These results should also be interpreted with some caution, particularly in the Canadian case 
where all government performance was – due to lack of better data – allocated to institutional 
funding. DSTI/DOC(2012)4 20 Indicator 3: Public project funding to national performers by funding agency (source of funding) This indicator focuses on the part of GBAORD funding dedicated to national performers through 
project funding. This indicator also includes project funding from abroad (international public project 
funding to national performers). This indicator relates to funding modes (1) and (5) of Table 1. Relevance This indicator facilitates a better understanding of the decision-making process regarding the 
allocation of R&D funding at a project level. This type of information can be used in principle to inform 
further work on funding models within a country's innovation policy mix, the analysis of shifts in the locus 
of decision-making over time and comparisons between countries' organisation of research funding and its 
overall effectiveness. Definitions used Funding agencies, which are defined as agencies which allocate project funding, have been divided 
into four general categories: a) National government organisations with policy and funding responsibilities, such as research, 
higher education or other ministries. b) Sub-national authorities, such as states, regions or (significant) local authorities. c) Independent agencies or agencies at arms-length, such as research councils or innovation 
agencies. The following criteria were defined as possible criteria to identify these agencies: 
having a well-defined budget (separated from the general state budget); a performance contract 
with the state; the right to take the final decision on the projects; strategic autonomy in the 
repartition of the budget between fields and activities. d) Supra-national and international agencies, such as the European Commission. Data and results Data on this indicator are available for 15 countries. Figure 8 displays results on the various agencies 
that are responsible for the allocation of R&D project funding. The main distinction is between ministries 
and independent agencies. For reasons of international comparability the figure is limited to national 
funding agencies funding national performers only. Comparable data on funding from international sources 
is not available for all countries and therefore excluded. These funding flows from abroad are not part of 
GBAORD. The indicator also excludes national public funding to international organisations and other 
funding of R&D going abroad and excludes national public institutional funding to national performers. Regarding the international funding flows, the availability and usefulness of other data sources could 
be examined, such as the Annual Activity Reports of the EU (Directorate General for Research) in the case 
of European countries. DSTI/DOC(2012)4 21 Figure 8. National public project funding to national performers by funding agency, 2008 As a percentage of funding 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 FIN NZL CHE BEL NLD CAN NOR AUT AUS CZE POL DEU DNK KOR ISR Research ministry

providing a breakdown by type of instrument as defined earlier, i.e. according to the main orientation 
(type) of the instrument. The indicator focuses on project funding only and excludes institutional funding. 
The reason is that institutional funding can also have different orientations, but that's not the purpose of 
giving institutional funding. It gives the receiving organisation freedom to perform R&D according to its 
own mission and profile. The data collection also excludes funding from abroad. This indicator relates to 
the funding mode (1). Relevance The government policies on public project funding, implemented via research programmes, can have 
different orientations: academically oriented, policy oriented or innovation oriented. The main interest is to 
identify what is the weight of the different orientations within each country, and whether there are 
significant differences across countries. Definitions used Academic instruments; policy support instruments; innovation instruments; and national public 
project funding to national performers. Data and results Data on this indicator are available for ten countries. Several countries reported having problems in 
allocating the budgets to one of the instrument types. Data for this indicator for reporting countries should 
therefore be treated with caution and interpreted as global estimates, because of the subjective element in 
the allocation decision. Figure 9 shows the allocation of national public project funding to national 
performers by three types of instruments. This indicator is restricted to national public funding sources of 
R&D. Funding to international performers is excluded. Funding from international agencies is not included 
in this indicator. Figure 9. National public project funding to national performers by type of instrument As a percentage of funding 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 CHE

with care (see next section for more details). The primary purpose of the instrument is the leading 
principle when categorising the funding (see Section 8.7.1 of the Frascati Manual). These should 
be considered as broad definitions which need to be further tested and improved by the 
participating countries. Indicator 5: International funding to national performers by sector of performance This indicator focuses on the funding from abroad and the sector where the R&D is performed. It 
relates to funding mode (5). Relevance Internationalisation, globalisation and international funding flows are also becoming more important 
within the public funding domain. For example, trans-national co-operation and trans-national funding 
flows are important elements of co-operation within the European Research Area (ERA). Public policies to 
promote such cooperation have become an important feature of the European landscape, both at the 
European Union level as well as at national level. In order to improve policies for the ERA, it is important 
to know what amount of public budget involves trans-national flows in both outward and inward 
directions. A first distinction concerning outward flows can be made between trans-national funding to 
international research organisations with dedicated R&D facilities (such as CERN, EMBL and ESO) and 
other trans-national flows (for example based on bilateral agreements and development co-operation). 
Other types of information relevant for understanding trans-national co-operation include the identity of 
the organisations involved and the type of programmes in place. International collaboration mechanisms 
involving state funding also apply to varying degrees of importance to other non-European countries. Another type of trans-national flow (inward) concerns project funding from international agencies to 
national performers, which is of increasing importance for national R&D performance. Findings @BULLET The data collection already showed that it is difficult for countries to collect these data. It was 
discussed and accepted to drop this indicator and to limit the data collection to GBAORD data 
only. 
@BULLET Because data collection for this indicator was difficult in the context of this project, it is 
suggested not to incorporate data collection on these funding flows in the project, but to design 
separate projects on the issue of international funding flows. The results are of course 
complementary. Data collection and methodological issues This section provides a general description of the way the different countries have collected the data 
for their country, with further details available in Annex 3. For all countries participating in the project, the 
national GBAORD database was the main source of data. However, in a number of cases, additional 
information from administrative documents or from direct requests to other organisations was needed to 
allocate the budget items properly to the different classifications as the national GBAORD database did not 
contain all the necessary information. DSTI/DOC(2012)4 25 Throughout this phase of the project, a number of methodological issues and issues on definitions 
were identified that require further clarification. Examples are the distinction between project and 
institutional funding, the classification of funding by sector of performance, the classification of funding 
agencies and the definition of instrument types. Work needs to be done to improve definitions and 
classifications as well as to provide examples of  " difficult "  cases. Information should be collected in order 
to see how the participating countries dealt with them. Although the questionnaire contained a number of 
definitions and examples to assist participating countries in identifying different funding modes and 
variables, some definitions were still found to be unclear, particularly for independent agencies and type of 
instruments. The next paragraphs describe some of the priorities for further work to be done on definitions 
and methodology. The distinction between project and institutional funding The distinction between project and institutional funding is one of the main significant contributions 
of this project. Until now, the separation has not been part of the regular data collection of GBAORD. At 
first sight, it seemed not to be too difficult for the participating countries to classify the GBAORD data 
according to these two funding modes. In most cases, the required information was already included in the 
data source. In some cases information from staff responsible for specific budget items or additional 
background information was needed to make the necessary distinction. However, discussions with the 
participating countries led to the conclusion that we need to specify the characteristics of institutional 
funding, especially delineating the border with project funding. This relates to the question of the specific 
locus of decision making about the funding into projects. Is it the government, the intermediary 
organisations or the performing units? The classification of funding by sector of performance The experience with this indicator appears to be mixed. While some countries encountered no 
methodological problems, others reported allocation problems in specific cases: @BULLET The main issue arises when funding goes to multiple sectors or a network of researchers: to 
which sector should the funding be allocated when the performers are located in multiple 
sectors? 6 Should the funding be apportioned to the relevant sectors? @BULLET Blurred borders between different sectors make it difficult to allocate some of the funding and the 
sector of performance is not always easy to determine. For instance: -Distinguishing between non-for profit, business and higher education sector. -The legal status of an institution receiving public funding may not necessarily be a good 
descriptor of an institution's actual role, as in the case of institutes under ministerial control 
but primarily providing services business enterprises. Should such an institute be classified 
to the government sector or the business enterprise sector? DSTI/DOC(2012)4 26 @BULLET Some countries raised the problem of allocating funds for intramural R&D performed within 
government. 7 For example, Canada allocated all government intramural R&D to institutional 
funding, because it was not possible to provide a satisfactory breakdown by type of funding. This 
resulted in no project funding being identified as having been performed by the government 
sector in Canada. For the next wave, clearer guidelines should be issued. In most of these cases, external information (administrative documents; annual reports of 
organisations in the private sector; etc.) would be needed to better allocate funding to the right sector of 
performance. The classification of project funding by funding agency In general, participating countries did not encounter major methodological difficulties (and most 
countries gave examples of independent agencies in their country). However, the classification of project 
funding by type of funding agency could be supported by clearer guidelines and definitions. It could be the 
case that some of the large differences between countries can be explained by classification issues. For the 
next wave of data collection, this issue will need to be addressed, for example by adding additional criteria 
such as the existence of some kind of legal status, performance contracts, control mechanisms and the 
location of the ultimate decision-making responsibility. It's also important to collect additional information 
on independent agencies. The classification of project funding by instrument type Several countries faced issues with definition and budget allocation by instrument type. Subjective 
judgments had to be used in combination with different assumptions. @BULLET The proposed definitions were not detailed enough to make a clear distinction between instrument 
type. For the next wave, this issue will need to be addressed. 
@BULLET As in the case of the present GBAORD data collection, projects should be classified according to 
the primary objective of the funding (see also Chapter 8.7 of the Frascati Manual). 
@BULLET One way forward, although still a global way of classifying, would be to use the NABS 
classification for defining categories. Items with the NABS-code  " industrial production "  could be 
treated as innovation instruments, the items with the code  " advancement of knowledge "  could be 
treated as academic instruments and the other as policy or thematic instruments. Another solution 
would be to look from the perspective of the funding agency: research council (= academic), 
innovation agency (= innovation), ministry of industry (= innovation), ministry of research 
(= academic), other ministries (= policy or thematic), but this could be a too simple solution. Conclusions The NESTI project on modes of public funding of R&D was initiated with three general aims:  " a) to 
propose a methodology for internationally comparable indicators on public funding modes; b) to collect 
such indicators; c) to broaden the scope of the project beyond the scope of the participating countries, to 
develop guidelines for the implementation of the methodology on a larger scale and on a permanent basis 
as part of the regular indicator activities of the international organisations OECD and EUROSTAT. "  The 
findings of this project could be used in a future revision of the GBAORD section of the OECD Frascati 
Manual. From the results of this phase of the project, it is possible to draw a number of conclusions on the 
adequateness of GBAORD as data source, the comparability of the new data and the results obtained so 
far. DSTI/DOC(2012)4 27 National GBAORD data can be used as a useful and potential source for data collection Seventeen out of the eighteen participating countries were able to build indicators by funding type 
(institutional vs. project funding). Fifteen countries reported data concerning project funding agencies and 
funding mode by sector of performance, and ten countries could report data on project funding by type of 
instrument. In this –experimental– phase of the project, a large number of OECD countries participated. For a full 
implementation of the data collection, participation and data from more countries would need to be 
secured. The next project phase seeks to involve more countries in order to make a broader use of 
GBAORD data, in full awareness that some countries articulated problems with adapting their data into the 
new classifications. Finally, the main advantage of this methodology is the use of existing data, which can, in some cases, 
be relatively easily complemented with additional, relatively easy-to-access information. Complementary qualitative data is required to interpret results Collecting quantitative data on public funding is not sufficient to enable their interpretation. Based on 
the data collected it is difficult to assess the reasons behind the differences between countries. For 
example, it is not clear how the large differences between countries with regard to the share of project 
funding should be interpreted alongside qualitative information on funding policies of R&D, on funding 
systems, funding agencies, funding mechanisms and funding practices as both a test of and complement to 
the new quantitative indicators on funding patterns. A basic level of international comparability appears to be attainable Participating countries were sufficiently confident about the reliability of their data for it be published 
and presented subject to the adequate health warnings. The publication  " Measuring innovation: A new 
perspective "  (OECD, 2010b) made use of the results of the exercise and published two figures based on 
these GBAORD-based indicators: one with government budgets by national sector of performance 
(indicator 3) and the other government funded R&D in higher education by type of funding (also 
indicator 3). The exercise has so far revealed the potential of using existing data on public funding for the 
development and construction of a number of policy relevant indicators on public funding. The results 
should however still be treated as preliminary. Improvements are likely to follow as the methodology is 
tested across a large number of countries and the resulting data are analysed alongside qualitative and other 
complementary data sources. DSTI/DOC(2012)4 28 NOTES 1.

2. 
The notion of project can be interpreted in a broader sense to encompass research programmes, since a 
programme can also have the same characteristics as a project (limited in scope, budget and time), only the 
scale is usually larger, 
3. 
There is a subtle distinction between performers and beneficiaries of funding. Beneficiaries of public funding 
may in some cases outsource some of the R&D to third parties that may belong to a different sector, for 
example in the case of business beneficiaries that procure R&D services from higher education or public 
research institutes. The adoption of a funding perspective implies that in the majority of cases it is only 
possible to identify the beneficiary, as opposed to the final performer. 
4. 
Because the data collection in the PRIME project differed from the OECD data collection, the data are not 
readily comparable. 
5. 
Funding of international performers is not included because GBAORD data do not provide the information on 
the sector of performance. 
6. 
The issue of project funding involving different actors (therefore different sectors of performance) was 
discussed at the last working group meeting (November 2009). The general consensus was that it had so far 
only affected a small share of overall funding and does not appear to pose a major problem at present. 
However, it was strongly felt that this type of funding will gain in importance over time as policies 
increasingly focus on fostering collaborations and will therefore need to be taken into account in future 
discussions.

Total national public funding (1+2+3+4) is defined as the total of national budgets funded by the 
government (state, federal, provincial) as measured by GBAORD or other data sources on public funding. 
It is the sum of National public funding to national performers and national public funding to 
international performers. Total public funding to national projects (1+5) is defined as the sum of national and international public 
budgets in a given country, attributed to a group or an individual to perform a R&D activity limited in 
scope, budget and time, normally on the basis of the submission of a project proposal describing the 
research activities to be done. It is the sum of national public funding and international public funding to 
national projects. National public funding to national performers (1+2) is defined as the sum of national public funding to 
national projects and national public funding to national research institutions. Total international public funding = International public funding to national projects and national 
research institutions (5+6) is defined as the R&D flows from public international organisations abroad to 
a specific country. (European and international agencies: international organisations, including the 
European Commission). FUNDING TYPES 1. National public funding to national projects is defined as the total of national budgets in a 
given country, attributed to a group or an individual to perform a R&D activity limited in

more or less freedom to define the research activities to be performed (also called block 
funding). A distinction is made between general university funds and other institutional 
funds. Funded by public national sources. 3. National public funding to international projects is defined as the part of GBAORD or

research organisations. DSTI/DOC(2012)4 31 5. International public funding to national projects is defined as the total of international 
public budgets in a given country, attributed to a group or an individual to perform a R&D 
activity limited in scope, budget and time, normally on the basis of the submission of a 
project proposal describing the research activities to be done. Funded by public international 
sources. This is not included within the scope of GBAORD data. 6. National public funding to national sector of performance is defined as the sum of national 
public funding to national projects and national public funding to national research 
institutions broken down by institutional sector beneficiary. SOURCE OF FUNDING National funding agencies: agencies which are directly part of the national state administration, such as 
ministries, offices and similar bodies. A subdivision could be the distinction between the research and 
higher education ministry and other (sectoral) ministries, such as a ministry of economic affairs or 
agriculture. Independent agencies: agencies enjoying strong autonomy in respect to the state in their management and 
decision-making process, such as research councils, or innovation agencies. Regional authorities: agencies that are part of the regional and local state administration. European and international agencies: international organisations, including the European Commission SECTOR OF PERFORMANCE Business enterprise sector: see OECD Frascati Manual 2002, Chapter 3.4. The sector is composed of: @BULLET All firms, organisations and institutions whose primary activity is the market production of goods 
or services (other than higher education) for sale to the general public at an economically 
significant price and, @BULLET The private non-profit institutions mainly serving them. Higher education sector: see OECD Frascati Manual 2002, Chapter 3.7. The sector is composed of: @BULLET All universities, colleges of technology and other institutions of post-secondary education, 
whatever their source of finance or legal status. @BULLET All research institutes, experimental stations and clinics operating under the direct control of or 
administered by or associated with higher education institutions. DSTI/DOC(2012)4 32 Government sector: see OECD Frascati Manual 2002, Chapter 3.5. The sector is composed of: @BULLET All departments, offices and other bodies which furnish, but normally do not sell to the 
community, those common services, other than higher education, which cannot otherwise be 
conveniently and economically provided, as well as those that administer the state and the 
economic and social policy of the community. (Public enterprises are included in the business 
enterprise sector). @BULLET Non public institutes controlled and mainly financed by government, but not administered by the 
higher education sector. Private non profit sector: see OECD Frascati Manual 2002, Chapter 3.6. The sector is composed of: @BULLET Non-market, private non-profit institutions serving households (i.e. the general public). @BULLET Private individuals or households. INSTRUMENTS Academic instruments are instruments whose main aim is to promote basic research and scientific 
production (for example scientific publications and PhDs). The main allocation criterion is scientific 
reputation, beneficiaries are higher education institutions or academically oriented research institutes 
(usually peer-reviewed). The projects or programmes are primarily investigator-driven and serve an 
academic goal. Policy or thematic instruments are instruments oriented towards the solution of political, social or 
economic urgent problems; innovation and economic developments might be an aim, but not so directly as 
the category of innovation instrument. The projects of programmes are primarily policy driven and serve a 
policy goal. Innovation instruments are instruments directly oriented towards economic innovation, such as product 
innovation, process innovation, public-private knowledge transfer and the creation of clusters. The projects 
or programmes are primarily innovation-driven and serve a goal towards the innovative performance of a 
country. DSTI/DOC(2012)4 33 ANNEX 2: INDICATORS FOR TABULATION Table A1.1. National public funding (GBAORD) by funding mode and destination (national or

Data source 
GBAORD. Provisional for the most recent budget year (2009-10), but final for earlier years. No 
other data sources. 
Distinction 
project/ 
institutional Based on the stated programme objectives. For institutional funding, the criteria are that the funding 
is provided as a block funding to a unit that has been established as an independent legal entity 
through an Act of Parliament (Federal or State) or established through a formal legal process and the 
entity is free to allocate the funding to different priorities according to its governance procedures. 
This is mostly the case for the publicly funded research agencies and the university sector. The 
exception is where the independent agency, which has been established by an Act of Parliament, is 
charged with distributing the appropriated monies to external parties to support research of limited 
scope and duration e.g. research councils. In this instance, the entire amount is classed as Project. 
For project funding, the criteria are that the scope and duration of the funding are limited, 
irrespective of characteristic of recipient. 
Problems 
No major difficulties in collecting the data 
Main 
independent 
funding 
agencies The two main independent funding agencies are the: Australian Research Council and the National 
Health and Medical Research Council Problems / 
issues There may be other state agencies, but the main ones are listed in the table Performers 
by 
institutional 
sector Sectoral attribution is by destination or recipient of the funding. The two problems encountered are 
where there are multiple sectors involved or where it is not clear which institutional sector a recipient 
should be assigned to (e.g. legal structure versus function). While some entities may be incorporated 
under the Corporations Act (2001), it may depend on other legal arrangements regarding their 
classification for tax purposes as well as the proportion of private versus public funding. The other 
relevant legislation is the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act (1997). These factors may 
complicate the allocation. Agencies have been asked to prorate the appropriations by institutional 
sector where funding recipients belong to multiple sectors following the recommendations of the 
Frascati Manual as closely as possible. Where agencies are able to identify the percentage 
distributions, these are applied in the distribution. Where the breakdown is not available, roughly 
equal proportions are applied. 
Projects by 
type of 
instruments The definition of the instrument types is somewhat difficult to interpret. Funding intentions 
corresponding to the 'Academic Instrument' could be more easily identified but distributions 
according to instrument types were based on assumptions i.e. funding intentions had to be translated 
into their equivalents in terms of 'instruments'. The test for the 'Innovation Instrument' is whether 
the programme objectives satisfy the Oslo Manual definition of innovation. 
Austria 
Data source 
GBAORD. Final for 2000 and 2005, provisional for 2009 (i.e. the latest available year). 
Distinction 
project/ 
institutional No distinction is made between the two  " funding modes "  in Annex T. Many budget items can be 
categorized relatively easily (as they are easily identifiable), some budget items need closer 
investigation by studying further background documents containing more details. 
Problems 
The distinction is for some items difficult without additional background information. National 
research funding agencies are considered as project funding. Data do not necessarily relate to the 
funds these agencies provide yearly (autonomy). DSTI/DOC(2012)4 37 Main 
independent 
funding 
agencies For the moment two main independent agencies are identified:  " Research Promotion Agency "  (FFG) 
which mainly funds business R&D and the  " Science Funds "  (FWF), which mainly funds R&D in the 
higher education sector. The  " Klima-und Energiefonds "  plays (up to now) a small role. Problems / 
issues No major problems (difference between GBAORD outlays and actual outlays of institutions). Performers 
by 
institutional 
sector Similar problems as the distinction between  " institutional funding "  and  " project funding "  occur. For 
many budget items the recipients can be categorised very easily, for others it is difficult. Additional 
information sources are used to estimate the distribution of certain items to the various sectors of 
performance. 
Projects by 
type of 
instruments Budgetary items would have to be labelled similarly to the methodology used for Table 1. However, 
there is not enough information available for the various budget items to make an attribution of 
reasonable quality. 
Belgium 
Data source 
GBAORD. The GBAORD data are collected on a yearly basis, at the level of budget items related 
with the decentralised STI competences of the communities, the regions and the federal state 
data are provided for 2008 on the basis of the final budget, except for the data of the Federal 
authority (on the basis of the provisional 2008 budget). Provisional 
Distinction 
project/ 
institutional The GBAORD data in Belgium are classified not only according to the NABS classification, but also 
to a functional and institutional destination classification (CFS/STAT-nomenclature) of the budget 
items. This CFS/STAT-nomenclature is helpful in making the distinction between project funding 
and institutional funding. 
Problems 
No significant methodological problems encountered.

Problems / 
issues No significant methodological problems encountered. Performers 
by 
institutional 
sector Problems occur especially when trying to detail project funding. The destination of project funding to 
the different sectors is not always clear because of a combination of different sectors involved. Only 
when a project register should be made, this could solve the problems. So, for the moment a rough 
distinction is made of those budget items with multiple destinations. 
Flemish government: for many funds (about 50 of a total of 175) of the Flemish GBAORD, the 
sectors of performance are only known in the course of the budget year. For the Flemish government, 
the expenditure analysis was consulted to find out which sectors executed the projects. 
Projects by 
type of 
instruments A best-guess approach was applied. The difficulty between policy instruments and innovation 
instruments is not always clear. Better definitions seem to be necessary (because of an overlap in the 
definitions). Innovation instruments are in principal not part of GBAORD. ESA and Airbus are 
typical examples of being both innovative instruments and policy or thematic instruments. 
Flemish Government: no major problems encountered, because the existing explanatory notes of the 
different funds give the answer. Although in some cases consultation of the expenditure analysis was 
necessary. 
Canada 
Data source 
GBAORD. Data is for the central government only (information of provincial and municipal 
government is excluded). Canada GBAORD as published by the OECD is also for central 
government only. Final data for 2000 and 2005; Provisional data for 2008 (in particular the GUF for 
2008 is an approximation based on 2007) DSTI/DOC(2012)4 38 Distinction 
project/ 
institutional Distinction made on different assumptions (based on which department/ministry/agency provided the 
funds and to whom (performers)). 
Project funding comes mainly from six departments or agencies (three research councils provide 
funding to academics on a research project proposal basis; one agency provides infrastructure funds 
to higher education institution on a research project proposal basis; and two departments provides 
R&D funds to business on research project proposal basis). 
Institutional funding comes mainly from government funding in-house R&D and GUF. For 
government funding in-house R&D, it is not possible to get a better breakdown 
Problems 
In Canada, government R&D funding is decentralized. More than 40 different departments/agencies 
are reporting R&D funding. It was not possible to ask each department to provide a list/breakdown of 
project vs. institutional funding. However, assumption was made depending on who (which 
department) provided the funds, and to whom (performer). In general, funding in higher education 
(from research councils) and in business sector is allocated through R&D research project (project-
based funding). 
For intramural R&D, it was not possible to provide a satisfactory breakdown. All in-house R&D was 
then allocated to institutional funding. 
For other performers (private non profit; other performers) total funding is small and was allocated to 
institutional funding. 
Main 
independent 
funding 
agencies There are three main research councils (independent agency providing funds to higher-education 
sector) and one agency providing R&D infrastructure fund to higher-education sector: 
-Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada 
-Canadian Institutes of Health Research 
-Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada 
-Canada Foundation for Innovation (R&D infrastructure fund) 
These four agencies provide around 95% of all government direct funding (excluding GUF) to higher 
education sector, and almost all of that funding is distributed by project-funding. 
Problems / 
issues 
Performers 
by 
institutional 
sector The main problem is for in-house government R&D where all funding was allocated to institutional 
funding. There is no central S&T ministry in Canada that would provide R&D funding to different 
ministries. Each ministry is responsible of his own R&D and from a total budget they will decide 
how much to spend in R&D to fulfil their mission. No more information is available. This is why it 
was decided to allocate all the in-house R&D as institutional. 
Projects by

policy instruments for Higher Education and in-house R&D. Switzerland

The national public funding to the EU Framework Programme is classified under institutional 
funding and also under programmes (project funding). We know exactly the total figure but the 
distinction between the institutional part of funding and the project part of funding is not satisfactory. 
Since year 2009 the system of public supporting has been changed by updated legal act. One part of 
institutional funding (significant one – specific research at universities) is reclassified as the project 
funding.
