			<head>ABSTRACT/RESUMÉ<lb/> Promoting competition to strengthen economic growth in Belgium<lb/></head>

			<p>Prices for many goods and services in Belgium are higher than in other countries, reflecting generally weak<lb/> competitive pressures. The government has recently introduced several reforms to strengthen the competition policy<lb/> framework. Nevertheless, to reap the full benefits of competitive markets, past reforms should be complemented with<lb/> a number of further measures. The powers of the Competition Authority can still be enhanced. Its effective degree of<lb/> independence, substantially improved in the recent reform, and its accountability should be monitored in order to<lb/> assess whether further measures in this direction are needed. In the retail sector competition-restricting regulations<lb/> still protect existing companies against new entry and inhibit the diffusion of new business models and technologies.<lb/> The reform efforts in the network sectors remain patchy. In the energy and telecommunication sectors the main issues<lb/> are the dominant positions of the incumbents and the failure of network sector regulators to introduce a level playing<lb/> field in order to allow new entry and expansion of competitors. In other sectors, such as postal services and rail<lb/> transport, major steps towards liberalisation are still to come. Overall, sectoral regulators will need more<lb/> independence and powers in order to tackle uncompetitive behaviour of the incumbents, while better communication<lb/> between the regulatory authorities is necessary. These steps should help to secure the necessary basis for bringing<lb/> productivity growth in line with best performance.<lb/> This Working Paper relates to the 2009 OECD Economic Survey of Belgium<lb/> (www.oecd.org/eco/surveys/belgium).<lb/></p>

			<head>PROMOTING COMPETITION TO STRENGTHEN ECONOMIC GROWTH IN BELGIUM<lb/> by Tomasz Koźluk 1<lb/></head>

			<p>1.<lb/> The Belgian government is putting a greater emphasis on competition as a productivity<lb/> enhancing tool and has implemented a number of reforms in this area. The government is now promoting<lb/> competition with the objective of increasing consumer welfare, preserving purchasing power and<lb/> encouraging entrepreneurship through facilitating new entry (Stratégie <ref type="biblio">de Lisbonne, 2008</ref>, Accord du<lb/> Gouvernement, Plan de Relance). However, there remains substantial scope to increase competitive<lb/> pressures in order to boost potential growth of the economy and benefit consumers. The authorities have<lb/> identified retail trade, food, energy and telecommunication as priority sectors in this respect. The retail<lb/> sector regulation is more pervasive than in most OECD countries, protecting existing shops from<lb/> competitive pressures as the entry of innovative business models and the diffusion of new technologies are<lb/> inhibited. At the same time, the liberalisation of network sectors has been slower than elsewhere in the<lb/> OECD while concentration is high and the effective functioning of regulators has proven difficult to<lb/> achieve. As a result, prices are often higher than in other countries pointing to the need for reducing the<lb/> barriers to entry and assuring a more level playing field. The paper starts with a general review of the<lb/> competition framework. Then, the inherently competitive retail trade sector is analysed. Subsequently, the<lb/> difficulties of introducing competition in the incumbent-dominated network sectors are considered. The<lb/> paper concludes with a set of policy recommendations.<lb/></p>

			<head>More competition to benefit productivity, employment and consumer welfare<lb/></head>

			<p>2.<lb/> Over the past ten years, productivity and employment growth have remained somewhat slower<lb/> relative to many other OECD countries (<ref type="table">Table 1</ref>). At the same time progress in opening markets to<lb/> competition has not been as fast as in the leading countries and the amount of restrictions to competition<lb/> remains above the OECD best practice (<ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>, Panel A and <ref type="biblio">Wölfl et al., 2009</ref>). A growing body of<lb/> empirical literature points to the existence of a positive link between competition and productivity growth<lb/> on the one hand (<ref type="biblio">Nicoletti and Scarpetta, 2003, Conway et al., 2006</ref>) and between competition and<lb/> employment on the other hand (<ref type="biblio">Bassanini and Duval, 2006</ref>), suggesting that insufficient competition policy<lb/> enforcement may have lowered economic growth in Belgium. Furthermore, it appears that the Belgian<lb/> consumer may be paying a high price for the lack of well-functioning, competitive markets (<ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>). 2<lb/> The final prices of many retail goods appear somewhat higher than the euro area average while prices in<lb/> network sectors also tend to be on the high side, motivating the review of competition-inhibiting regulation<lb/> in Belgium.<lb/></p>

				<formula>3.<lb/></formula>

			<p>The competition policy framework has notably improved over the past several years as<lb/> legislation was adapted to EU standards (Box 1). The merger review threshold was raised, freeing up<lb/> resources to deal with the cases of price fixing and abuse of dominant position. The reform also included<lb/> changes in the institutional structure of the competition bodies. The Competition Authority is a so-called<lb/> dual authority, consisting of the Directorate General of the Ministry of Economy (the investigative body)<lb/> and the Competition Council (the administrative tribunal). The latter includes the Council (a court) and the<lb/> College of Competition Prosecutors (the investigative and prosecuting body). Further reforms included<lb/> putting in place a leniency programme and putting an end to the immunity from fines granted to<lb/> associations of undertakings and professionals under the previous law. The reforms have started to yield<lb/> visible results: cartel infringements have been found, the leniency programme has begun to work and cartel<lb/> participants have been fined. Nevertheless, as the improvements to the framework are rather recent, it will<lb/> take some time for the full effect on competition to be felt, however there still seems room for refining of<lb/> the setup.<lb/></p>

The new competition and law enforcement framework<lb/> The competition framework was reformed in 2006 after the Court of Audit (Cour des Comptes) had found that the<lb/> previous setup produced little enforcement and that procedures took too long. The competition authorities were tied<lb/> down in mandatory merger reviews with few resources for other competition matters. Out of nearly 200 matters<lb/> between 1993 and 2005</table>

			<p>, barely a third resulted in a decision, and only one resulted in a fine. Most investigations were<lb/> taking more than 2 years to complete, excluding cases that expired instead of having a formal closure decision. In<lb/> matters other than interim measures and mergers from 1997-2001, the Council reached only one decision per year<lb/> and the average time for cartel infringement proceedings was over six years. The Court of Audit found that the<lb/> principle reasons for this state of affairs were, in addition to the resource requirements of the mandatory merger<lb/> reviews, poor organization and the lack of support for a coherent policy of protecting competition to promote economic<lb/> efficiency. The new competition law tracks the EU legislation based on the prohibition of anti competitive restrictive<lb/> agreements and abuses of dominant positions and gives a legal basis for leniency. In addition, the latest<lb/> EU substantive standard for mergers, which is based on the concept of a &quot; substantial impediment to effective<lb/> competition, &quot; rather than solely a &quot; dominance &quot; test, is incorporated in the law. The reform did not introduce changes to<lb/> the fines which can be imposed by the Authority, which can be as high as 10% of annual turnover. Staff at the<lb/> Competition Authority is about 70 person years, which is the same as Switzerland, but less than in the Netherlands<lb/> and the Nordic Countries.<lb/></p>

			<p>The 2006 reforms also modified the institutional structure. The Belgian Competition Authority is not a single<lb/> integrated agency but a so-called &quot; dual authority &quot; . It has two principal parts, the Competition Council and the<lb/> Directorate General for Competition. The Council includes the general assembly of the Council (in a narrow sense),<lb/> which is the decision making body for competition enforcement. The law authorises six full time and six part-time<lb/> members (councillors), who are appointed by the government for six-year, renewable terms. The College of<lb/> Competition Prosecutors (with a statutory maximum of ten members) is attached to the Council. The competition<lb/> prosecutors initiate and direct investigations and present enforcement matters to the Council and rely upon the staff of<lb/> the Directorate General for Competition for investigative and other support. There is therefore institutional separation<lb/> between the investigation, prosecution and decision making powers within the authority. Unlike in some other<lb/> countries, the Competition Authority is not responsible for consumer protection, which is the responsibility of the<lb/> Directorate General for Market Regulation under the same ministry. There is also an advisory Commission for<lb/> Competition in the Central Council for the Economy.<lb/></p>

			<p>Merger review procedures require advance notification and approval for transactions that involve a total turnover<lb/> in Belgium of over EUR 100 million (and at least two of the undertakings concerned have turnover in Belgium<lb/> exceeding EUR 40 million). These thresholds are more than twice the limits in the pre-reform procedures, inducing a<lb/> substantial reduction in merger reviews. The competition authority is not fully independent in this area as the<lb/> government can override a Council decision rejecting a merger allowing it to go forward &quot; for reasons of general interest<lb/> which outweigh the risk of competition. &quot; It may also overrun any conditions imposed on the merger by the Competition<lb/> Council. In particular, the Council of Ministers may consider matters of national security, international competitiveness,<lb/> employment and consumer interests. This provision has not been used to date. The leniency programme was updated<lb/> in October 2007 to make it consistent with now standard European practices, so a cartel member may be fully or partly<lb/> exempted from sanctions for bringing the cartel to the attention of the enforcement authority, bringing in evidence the<lb/> authority did not have, or admitting participation.<lb/> In the first full year under the new competition regime (2007), the Council reached three cartel infringements<lb/> decisions and considered six applications for leniency. In the second year, the number of decisions on cartel<lb/> infringements rose to five and six applications for leniency were considered. The first cartel fine (of slightly below<lb/> EUR 500 000) ever imposed under Belgian law was in early 2008 in a case that started with a leniency application.<lb/> The relatively small fine reflects that the cartel ended in 2002 and the smallness of the market. A recent decision<lb/> illustrates the importance of the recent changes to the statute. In July 2008, the Council ruled against a trade<lb/> association &quot; ethical &quot; rule setting minimum fees (for interior designers), but could not impose a fine because the law in<lb/> effect during the period of the violation, from 2002 to 2005, did not authorise fines against an association. Other small<lb/> fines have been issued to trade associations to signal that co-ordination dampening price competition will no longer be<lb/> acceptable.<lb/> The Competition Council may end up with important functions in regulatory matters. As is usual elsewhere, it<lb/> already acts in co-operation with sector regulators. Under the competition law, the Competition Council may also be<lb/> empowered to decide appeals from decisions of sectoral regulators. This function will depend upon enactment of<lb/> corresponding authorizations in the sector regulatory laws. The Directorate General has engaged in policy advocacy<lb/> by issuing reports or opinions on taxicab regulation, real estate and interlocking directorates.<lb/></p>

			<p>4.<lb/> Although the independence of the Competition Authority has been strengthened (it is now<lb/> financed through a separate line in the government&apos;s budget), the investigative part of the Authority<lb/> continues to be a Directorate General inside the Ministry of Economy. The Directorate&apos;s resources remain<lb/> largely determined by the federal government and a number of supporting costs (location, information and<lb/> communication technology, etc.) are provided by the Ministry outside the budget line. Thus, the<lb/> Competition Authority applies the centralised hiring procedures of the civil service and it remains<lb/> physically located in the Ministry&apos;s building. Furthermore, the large backlog of old cases has led to<lb/> problems in meeting legal deadlines and has forced the College of Prosecutors to prioritise cases. This has<lb/> been done based on criteria, the origin of which have not been made sufficiently clear to the wider public,<lb/> and may lead to accusations that political priorities affect the ranking of cases. Therefore, the situation<lb/> should be monitored, in particular regarding the authority&apos;s degree of independence and accountability. If<lb/> necessary, a potential improvement would entail giving the authority a status of a fully independent agency<lb/> with a complete budget decided by the parliament and granted full freedom in hiring. In terms of<lb/> improving the authority&apos;s perceived independence, physically moving out of the Ministry building and<lb/> enhancing the transparency of the selection of the prioritisation criteria may be considered. Despite the<lb/> reinforcements made in the past years, there are still signs the Competition Authority may be in need of<lb/> additional resources. The current staffing may be reconsidered as it appears on the low side when<lb/> compared with other small economies such as the Netherlands and the Nordic countries (<ref type="biblio">Høj, 2007</ref>), and it<lb/> has not proved sufficient for dealing with the large amount of old cases and court appeals against its<lb/> decisions and for assuming a more proactive role.<lb/> ECO/WKP(2009)77<lb/> 5.<lb/> There is a need for strong signalling of the Competition Authority&apos;s determination to enforce<lb/> competition law. The fines imposed up to date have not been particularly high. However, in the future the<lb/> Competition Authority will inevitably be dealing with larger cases in crucial sectors and the use of high<lb/> fines will be desirable in order to signal the tough stance against infringements and to deter future<lb/> uncompetitive practices. High fines will also increase the incentives to apply for leniency thereby<lb/> facilitating the policing of cartels. Deterrence would be enhanced by introducing criminal sanctions such as<lb/> prison sentences for hard-core cartel infringements. To enhance the Authority&apos;s effectiveness, clear and<lb/> efficient communication procedures (in particular regarding confidential information) between the<lb/> Authority and the sectoral regulators are essential. Finally, plans to establish the Council as the sole<lb/> institution for appeal against sectoral regulator decisions are commendable. This is the case in many<lb/> OECD countries, as the Council is well placed to rule on competition cases in the network sectors. If this is<lb/> to increase the speed with which cases are settled it may imply the Council will need additional resources.<lb/> 6.<lb/> The notable progress in the reform of the Competition Authority does not appear to be coupled<lb/> with comparable developments in the regulation of the network sectors (see the sections below). In order to<lb/> fulfil the government&apos;s goal of stimulating economic activity and improving consumer welfare through the<lb/> strengthening of competition in Belgian markets, a determined approach to competition policy needs to be<lb/> implemented and enforced at all levels of regulation (SPF <ref type="biblio">Economie, 2008</ref>). The government has recently<lb/> created a price observatory which will aim at increasing the price transparency in the market, but care<lb/> should be taken in order not to further complicate the regulatory structure and to minimise the risk of this<lb/> authority becoming a price setter.<lb/></p>

			<head>Competition in retail distribution is burdened by heavy regulation<lb/></head>

			<p>7.<lb/> The retail sector in Belgium is characterised by a relatively large number of small shops<lb/> (<ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>), a structure that may have a number of advantages in terms of accessibility. However, at the<lb/> same time, the employment share of the sector is below the average of the OECD countries (<ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>,<lb/> Panel A) pointing to a relatively large scope for jobs creation. Moreover, productivity in the sector has<lb/> been growing slower than in most OECD countries (<ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>, Panel B and <ref type="biblio">Biatour and Kegels, 2008</ref>). 3<lb/> Finally, the price levels of many of the goods associated with retail distribution are notably higher than in<lb/> other euro area countries (<ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>). At the same time, the sector is much more regulated than in most other<lb/> OECD countries, especially in the areas of protection of existing firms, specific regulation of large outlets<lb/> and shop opening hours (<ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>, Panel B). This regulation shields existing shops from competitive<lb/> pressures which in many cases leads to the protection of local monopolies (<ref type="biblio">Høj et al. 1995</ref> provides<lb/> evidence on the relation between regulation, prices and size of shops). Therefore, deregulation of retail<lb/> distribution can be expected to boost productivity. This conclusion is backed by the results of OECD<lb/> simulations, which show that Belgium is among the countries with the highest potential gains from the<lb/> liberalisation of the retail sector (Box 2). Hence, as retail trade is an inherently competitive sector, scaling<lb/> back the regulation should benefit consumer welfare. A number of studies have shown that lowering entry<lb/> barriers can increase the efficiency of retail trade leading both to lower prices (<ref type="biblio">Pilat, 1997</ref>, Haffner and<lb/> van <ref type="biblio">Bergeijk, 1997</ref>) and higher employment (<ref type="biblio">Bertrand and Kramarz, 2002; CPB, 1995; Creusen<lb/> et al, 2006</ref>). The scope for the increase in employment in the sector should not be overlooked in the<lb/> Belgian context, given the fact that these are likely to be jobs for low skilled workers and for flexible<lb/> part-time workers, such as females returning to the labour market.<lb/></p>

			<head>8.<lb/></head>

			<p>Box 3 provides a detailed overview of the main restrictions to competition in the Belgian retail<lb/> sector, which generally protect existing shops, in particular those of smaller size, from the entry of new<lb/> innovative business models. The prohibition of sales below costs prevents retailers from easily selling<lb/> unwanted stocks, increasing the risk for new entrants. The ban on announcements of price reductions<lb/> before sales periods ( &quot; the black-out period &quot; ) reduces consumers access to information on prices, while the<lb/> prohibition of tied sales (better known in Belgium as &quot; joint-sales &quot; ) inhibits the diffusion of innovative<lb/> products or new technology (in April 2009 the European Court of Justice declared this law as incompatible<lb/> with European legislation). The government is currently working on the modification of most of the above<lb/> regulation. The changes proposed so far do not appear substantial. As the Competition Authority should<lb/> deal with the abuse of dominant position, the restrictions on prices and assortment should be scrapped<lb/> altogether. In order to improve consumer welfare, providing consumers with the possibility of shopping<lb/> outside standard hours and the retailers with flexibility to better meet consumer demand, the shop opening<lb/> hour regulation, which is among the more restrictive in the OECD, should be abandoned. Finally, zoning<lb/> regulation for large outlets, which was reformed in 2005 resulting in a faster decision making process,<lb/> should be restricted to issues of urban planning, transport and safety (in line with the recent<lb/> recommendation from the Ministry of Economy, SPF <ref type="biblio">Economie, 2008</ref>). This would allow market forces,<lb/> rather than a nation-wide committee with a strong representation of existing retailers or the local<lb/> municipality, to decide on the consumers&apos; benefits arising from a new retail outlet.<lb/></p>

			<head>Box 2. Anti-competitive regulation and labour productivity – OECD simulations<lb/></head>

			<p>OECD calculations report that aligning sectoral regulation (in retail trade, electricity and gas and professional<lb/> services) with international best practice would boost labour productivity in the entire economy by nearly 16% over the<lb/> next decade. Reforms in the retail sector only, could raise productivity by almost 12% if regulation was brought in line<lb/> with OECD best practice. Similarly, for reforms in the energy sector, productivity is calculated to increase by 3.5%,<lb/> which is well above the average of the countries analysed (<ref type="table">Table 2</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<p>This type of regulation limits retailers&apos; flexibility and reduces their ability to get rid of unwanted stock, thereby constituting<lb/> an implicit deterrent to entry and reducing consumer welfare. Moreover, the definitions of costs and minimum margins are<lb/> cumbersome and the verification problematic, especially for start-ups with no history of costs.<lb/></p>

			<head> Tied sales of products are prohibited.<lb/></head>

			<p>This regulation aims at disallowing the cross-subsidising of products (or products and services), to enhance<lb/> transparency. It protects smaller retailers who may have less scope to offer products tied together and has notably increased<lb/> the complexity of retail regulation. Many exceptions have been granted, for example for the sale of an ensemble (e.g. frames<lb/> with lenses) or for the sale of a product together with its packing. As the notion of an ensemble is unclear a priori, the law<lb/> increases uncertainty for new products and hampers the diffusion of new technology.<lb/></p>

			<head>Regulation of opening hours<lb/></head>

			<p> Shops may be open on weekdays between 5h and 20h, on Fridays (and days preceding holidays) till 21h. They<lb/> have to be closed for one period of 24 hours a week (by default Sundays, though any day of the week can be<lb/> chosen as long as it is kept the same for at least six months.) The law allows for an additional opening during<lb/> 6 Sundays a year.<lb/></p>

			<p> Exemptions include: small shops linked to gas stations, night shops (under 150m2, selling groceries and hygienic<lb/> materials may be open 18h-7h) and shops in designated tourist areas.<lb/>  The law foresees fines, shop closure and prison penalties for infringement and is enforced by state officials.<lb/></p>

			<p>Restrictions on shop opening hours protect existing retailers, in particular small night shops, against new innovative<lb/> business models. Such regulation also limits the retailers&apos; ability to adjust to changes in consumer demand and hurts<lb/> consumer welfare by reducing the ability to choose when to do shopping. In Belgium, such regulation is aimed at enhancing<lb/> workers&apos; welfare despite its potential employment-reducing effects.<lb/></p>

			<head>Regulation of large outlets<lb/></head>

			<p> The location decision is based on the evaluation of four types of possible effects: i) spatial effect (urban planning,<lb/> access and road safety); ii) on consumer interests (product range and prices); iii) on employment (gross and in<lb/> existing commerce); and iv) on the balance between small, medium and large commerce.<lb/></p>

			<head></head>

			<figure>Decisions for shops between 400-1000m 2 of surface are taken by the municipality, while for shops above 1000m 2<lb/> the National Economic and Social Committee for Retail has to be consulted. In case of surfaces above 2000m 2 the<lb/> neighbouring municipalities have to be consulted.<lb/>  The Economic and Social Committee is composed of representatives of ministries, regions, consumer<lb/> associations, labour organisations, independent retailers and SME&apos;s and integrated commerce.<lb/>  The decision must be made and communicated within a maximum of 75 days and can be appealed against to the<lb/> Inter-ministerial Committee for Retail (Comité Interministériel pour la Distribution). Silence is consent.<lb/></figure>

			<p>Zoning regulation may be desirable due to issues of urban planning, traffic congestion and security, but is often used to<lb/> protect existing retailers against new entrants. As emphasised in OECD (2008), the evaluation of consumer interests should<lb/> be left to the consumers themselves, who will ultimately decide whether the new business serves them better than the<lb/> existing ones through their shopping choices.<lb/></p>

			<head>Other regulation<lb/></head>

			<p> Further strict regulations concern advertising, specific retail sectors (e.g. pharmaceuticals) and sales at the home<lb/> of the customer.<lb/></p>

			<head>Regulators</head>

			<figure>in network industries are faced with dominant positions of incumbents<lb/> 9.<lb/> The liberalisation in the network sectors remains limited. The degree of opening is patchy and the<lb/> diversity of regulatory structures complicates regulation (Box 4). There exists no uniform definition of<lb/> regulatory bodies. The role of network sector regulation and the lack of coordination between the sectoral<lb/> regulators and the Competition Authority have been identified as the most serious issues of the design of<lb/> the Belgian system (SPF Economie, <ref type="biblio">2008</ref>). Another important issue concerns the unusually wide scope of<lb/> universal services which poses a barrier to entry and the expansion of competitors, while benefiting the<lb/> incumbents due to problematic schemes for financing. The universal service obligations (USOs) are<lb/> summarised in Box 5 and their effect on competition is discussed below.<lb/></p>

			<head>Box 4. Regulation of network sectors<lb/></head>

			<p>The regulation of network sectors in Belgium differs substantially across the individual sectors. In general, the<lb/> Competition Authority deals with the cases of the abuse of dominant position and cartel pricing in competitive sectors<lb/> and the competitive segments of the network sectors. Non-discriminatory third party access to monopoly segments is<lb/> the competence of sectoral regulators which have various structures and varying degrees of independence from the<lb/> executive and different sources of financing. The network sector regulators are usually also in charge of issuing market<lb/> entry licenses, assuring universal services and having some advisory tasks as regards sector strategies.<lb/></p>

			<p>The energy sectors (electricity and gas) are regulated by a single federal authority, the Commission for Electricity<lb/> and Gas Regulation (known by its French and Flemish abbreviation CREG), and three regional authorities. The federal<lb/> regulatory tasks concern mainly the approval of transmission and distribution tariffs (in both gas and electricity) and<lb/> advising the government in the other segments of the markets. In the electricity market, its regulatory powers are<lb/> limited to transmission and distribution networks above a certain threshold (70kV).<lb/> The federal authority&apos;s independence seems in line with OECD best practice: CREG has its own budget which is<lb/> funded through a surcharge on customer utility bills securing it from potential political intervention, although the<lb/> management remains nominated by the government. On the other hand, regional regulators are responsible for<lb/> appointing distribution network operators in gas and distribution grid operators in electricity, issuing retail supply<lb/> licenses, ensuring the implementation of universal service obligations and advising the regional governments. The<lb/> independence of the regional regulatory authorities from the sub-national levels of government does not seem as well<lb/> assured as in the case of the federal regulator.<lb/></p>

			<p>In principle, sub-national level regulators may be better prepared to deal with regional regulatory tasks as they<lb/> may be better prepared to deal with issues of local distribution and supply as well as consumer needs due to their local<lb/> knowledge and relative proximity to the final market. However such a structure may cause problems of regulatory<lb/> powers (overlap of powers, lack of regulatory coverage of certain segments, lack of economies of scale) and<lb/> coordination (both of the objectives and of enforcement decisions). This structure may lead to lengthy communication<lb/> procedures and increase bureaucracy. Three regulatory environments are an additional entry cost for competitors and<lb/> this structure has been frequently criticised (<ref type="biblio">IEA, 2006</ref>). One of the effects of the set-up was the different progress in<lb/> the legal opening of the electricity market for consumer choice, which was functional in</p>

			<figure>Flanders in 2003, while taking<lb/> until 2007 in Wallonia and the Brussels-Capital region.<lb/></figure>

			<p>The telecommunication and postal sectors are regulated by the Belgian Institute for Postal Services and<lb/> Telecommunication (BIPT). The regulator&apos;s independence was strengthened in 2003, formerly being part of the<lb/> Ministry which executed ownership powers in the incumbent. Financing is assured mainly through licensing fees.<lb/> Despite the improvement, some controversies about the issue of independence remain: the members of the Council<lb/> (decision making body), including the head, are nominated and can be dismissed on the proposal of the executive.<lb/> There remains some uncertainty about the possibility of the government to overturn BIPT decisions and about the<lb/> political influence on the regulators priorities (<ref type="biblio">Platform, 2007</ref>). Contrary to the energy markets, the regulatory tasks are<lb/> concentrated in a federal body; however there seems to be pressure from the language-Community level regulators<lb/> (who have competencies over broadcasting content) to gain regulatory powers over infrastructure common to<lb/> broadcasting and telecommunication (e.g. internet). In 2006, these resulted in a cooperation agreement which laid<lb/> down the procedures for resolving disputes of joint competencies, causing some concern due to the increased scope<lb/> for bureaucratic consultation and leaving decision power over unresolved issues at the ministerial level, thereby<lb/> somewhat weakening the regulator. In November 2008, the federal government proposed measures to strengthen the<lb/> regulator: the procedure for imposing a fine is to become easier, and fines may become higher. BIPT is to acquire<lb/> more powers for intervention in the market. In the cases that occur, its defence before the Court of Appeal is to<lb/> become less elaborate.<lb/></p>

			<head>The energy sector: strong incumbents and high implicit barriers to entry<lb/></head>

			<table>Electricity<lb/> 10.<lb/> The liberalisation of the energy market essentially began in April 1999 with the transposition of<lb/> the first EU electricity and gas directives. The second EU directives were transposed in June 2005 while<lb/> the electricity market for households was fully legally opened on 1 st June 2003 in Flanders. Wallonia and<lb/> Brussels-Capital followed on 1 st January 2007</table>

			<p>when supplier choice was granted to all consumers. Despite<lb/> the liberalisation, electricity prices remained well above those in OECD countries with the most<lb/> competitive electricity markets (<ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref>). Moreover, energy prices have been found to contribute strongly<lb/> to the large positive inflation differential between Belgium and the euro area in late 2008. 4<lb/> 11.<lb/> Historically, all segments of the electricity market have been concentrated in the hands of Suez<lb/> and Gaz de France. Following their merger, the companies agreed with the European Commission to<lb/> reduce their involvement in certain segments (Box 6). However, most of the segments of the market are set<lb/> to remain highly concentrated in the hands of the merged company GDF-Suez. As now only legal<lb/> separation of the transmission operator and accounting separation of other segments are required, the<lb/> government&apos;s efforts to strengthen separation, including a favourable stance towards the introduction of<lb/> ownership separation of transmission network operators are commendable. Notably, the government has<lb/> taken steps to encourage auctioning off some of the incumbent&apos;s spare capacity which are yielding results<lb/> (for example in late 2008 the incumbent agreed to sell 10% of Belgian production capacity) and efforts to<lb/> introduce new players should therefore be continued. Nonetheless, a number of additional barriers to entry<lb/> should be removed in order to encourage new competitors as the sector remains burdened by more<lb/> competition-restricting regulation than international best practice (<ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref>, Panel A). The wholesale<lb/> exchange pool, established in 2006, has failed to play a significant role (in 2008, only about 13% of daily<lb/> electricity consumption was traded on the day-ahead market 5 ), despite that such a measure has proven<lb/> beneficial for competition in a number of OECD countries. The lack of liquidity and high prices on the<lb/> wholesale market have deterred entry in the supply market and therefore further efforts to increase<lb/> interconnection capacity is desirable to enhance competition. Moreover, although the retail electricity<lb/> prices are not regulated, most suppliers choose to use a variation of a cost indexation formula calculated by<lb/> the federal regulator (CREG), which was used historically to determine the regulated price before the<lb/> markets were liberalised. The publication of the components by CREG should be ceased, as they bring<lb/> little value added while posing the risk of the regulator acting as a price coordinator on the retail market.<lb/> As this formula is based, among others, on the Zeebrugge hub spot gas price and available nuclear plant<lb/> capacity, both of which can be strongly influenced by the incumbent companies, increased vertical<lb/> separation in the market should ensure this is not the case. The transmission and distribution tariffs are<lb/> accompanied by high uncertainty, undermining potential new business models of new entrants. Switching<lb/> to multi-annual tariffs for transmission (in <ref type="biblio">2008</ref>) and distribution (in 2009) are significant steps towards a<lb/> more stable environment, however the legal uncertainty related to the details of the introduction of such<lb/> 4.<lb/> The favourable development in 2007 has been due to a transmission and distribution tariff decrease<lb/> imposed by the federal regulator, which was later annulled by the court on the grounds of the regulator<lb/> exceeding its competencies. The decreases of electricity (and gas) prices in 2007 relative to other countries<lb/> have been reversed as a result of the tariff increase ranging from below 10% in Wallonia (where they<lb/> remain the highest) to almost 50% in Flanders (where they still remain the lowest). This caused final<lb/> energy prices to increase sharply. The 22% inflation (year-on-year) of Belgian energy prices in<lb/></p>

			<table>September 2008, is estimated to have been only 13% if not for the change in distribution tariffs, and<lb/> below 8% (in line with Euro area average) if additionally capacity was kept at 2007 levels. Of the<lb/> 1.8 percentage point differential in headline inflation between Belgium and the euro area (September 2008)<lb/> 1.2 percentage points can be explained by gas and electricity price increases (NBB, 2008).<lb/> 5.<lb/> Monthly variation can be considerable, e.g. in May 2008 the traded volumes reached a third of Belgian<lb/> demand.<lb/> legislation has, so far, undermined its effect. Another example of the uncertainty surrounding tariffs was<lb/> when the lowering of tariffs by CREG led to an appeal against its decisions and its subsequent annulment<lb/> in 2008. This resulted in a number of suggestions that the regulator needs additional tariff-setting powers in<lb/> the distribution segments (NBB, 2008).<lb/></table>

			<p>12.<lb/> Another potentially important deterrent to entry is the complicated regulatory structure (Box4)<lb/> which effectively divides Belgium into three separate energy markets, thereby increasing entrants&apos; (fixed)<lb/> costs. The federal regulator seems sufficiently independent and equipped to regulate the areas within its<lb/> competence. In April 2008, the government increased the investigative powers of its officials and thus<lb/> improved the toolset of the federal regulator. However, the set-up of the regional regulators does not seem<lb/> as well developed. Firstly, their independence does not seem as well secured, as they are financed directly<lb/> by regional government budgets, while the senior staff is appointed by the regional government, and their<lb/> objectives are not necessarily in line with each other nor with those of the federal body. Secondly, although<lb/> regional regulators in downstream segments may, in principle, be better equipped to fulfil their tasks, being<lb/> closer to the final consumer, such a structure risks unnecessary bureaucratic delays in communication and<lb/> the loss of economies of scale, in particular in the Belgian context where divided regulators are dealing<lb/> with a very concentrated market. In addition, there is a risk that regional regulators may be more prone to<lb/> regulatory capture, in particular given their weak independence from the governments and the strong<lb/> involvement of municipalities in distribution networks. 6 Therefore the regulatory structure should be<lb/> revisited and the regulatory tasks should be concentrated in one authority. As a second best, strong<lb/> independence and sufficient powers of the regional regulators need to be secured, while the current<lb/> voluntary dialogue forum should be replaced by a binding co-operation and co-ordination framework<lb/> between regulators of all levels is necessary and to align their priorities. Finally, universal service<lb/> obligations appear overly broad and may deter entry due to a higher cost of adapting to the regional<lb/> specificities (Box5). In order for them not to constitute a barrier to new competitors, regional authorities<lb/> wishing to conduct additional social policy based on energy provision, should purchase energy within their<lb/> own budget or use transfer policies instead of the regulated tariffs.<lb/></p>

			<head>Gas<lb/></head>

			<p>13.<lb/> Gas is imported mainly through the Zeebrugge hub and LNG terminal. Roughly one half of the<lb/> households use gas for heating and cooking and the role of gas in the generation of electricity, is set to<lb/> increase significantly over the coming two decades (IEA, 2006). A number of issues concerning the gas<lb/> sector are also common to the electricity sector, and thus have already been discussed in the previous<lb/> section. The sector was liberalised in a similar time frame as the electricity sector. Gas prices were<lb/> generally near the EU average until 2007, but as in electricity the subsequent fall was due to a regulatory<lb/> lowering of tariffs, which were annulled in 2008 (<ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref>).<lb/> 14.<lb/> The main regulatory problems in the gas market concern high implicit barriers to new entry and<lb/> the resulting strong position of the incumbent, while explicit entry barriers are low (<ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref>, Panel B). The<lb/> gas market is highly concentrated (GDF and Suez) and the commitments accompanying the merger of the<lb/> two companies are unlikely to improve the situation (Box 6). As a result, the transmission network<lb/> capacity has been, to a large extent, unavailable to new entrants as it was contracted out for very long time<lb/> periods. Measures to resolve this situation have been imposed by the Commission in late 2007 (EC, 2007a<lb/> and 2007b) however it will take time to evaluate whether they are sufficient. Moreover, installing a well<lb/> functioning wholesale pool for natural gas, which has proved to benefit competition in a number of OECD<lb/> countries, is recommended. 7 Given the strong position of GDF-Suez in various segments of both the gas<lb/> and electricity markets, regulatory efforts should be increased to ensure that the legal interdiction of<lb/> cross-subsidisation within the same company, both between the different segments of the gas market as<lb/> well as between gas and electricity products, is respected. As in electricity, the law currently requires legal<lb/> separation of the transmission and distribution segments and accounts separation of the other segments.<lb/> The introduction of mandatory vertical ownership separation between different segments or of<lb/> strengthening the existing formal separation, in line with the government&apos;s proposals, would be a desirable<lb/> step. In this light, the government should continue its efforts to make sure that the main market players do<lb/> not have a blocking minority participation in the ownership structure of the Zeebrugge hub and the LNG<lb/> terminal. This should be done with the goal of assuring non-discriminatory third party access to the<lb/> terminals and to transmission capacity from the terminals, which has proven a serious problem in the past.<lb/> The Ministry of Energy is currently working on this issue, as part of the new Code of Conduct on third<lb/> party access to the gas network.<lb/> 6.<lb/> The municipalities have a legal monopoly in electricity distribution, and nearly all of them transferred the<lb/> distribution to inter-municipal companies (intercommunales). The income from the energy-related<lb/> activities constitutes an important figure in the municipal budgets reaching 10% of the revenues.<lb/> 7.<lb/> Although APX Zee (a within-day and day-ahead gas trading platform) already exists, its role is negligible<lb/> with a total of 33 transactions done in the whole of 2008, of which 11 since February.<lb/></p>

			<head>Box 5. Universal services in energy, telecoms and post<lb/></head>

			<p>Universal service obligations (USOs) are intended to assure the universal access to a designated service at a specified quality<lb/> and an affordable price. In practice however, they may serve as a barrier to deter new entrants, securing of an incumbent&apos;s position or<lb/> a subsidy for the latter. In general each World Trade Organisation member has the right to set the desired scope of USO. The specific<lb/> rules for EU member states are set out in the Universal Service Directive (for telecoms) and in the Postal Directive. In general USO&apos;s,<lb/> if constituting a cost to the supplier, must be compensated for with profits made in other markets. They can be financed directly from<lb/> the government budget (through the acquisition of a service), from a fund to which market participants contribute (e.g. pay or play<lb/> fund) or through a designated segment of the market (e.g. through the reserved area in postal services, through distribution tariffs in<lb/> distribution).<lb/> In Belgium no uniform approach to universal services exists. While provisions for auctioning off some of the services to the<lb/> provider with best offers exist, other services are imposed on all operators. The scope of universal service tends to be unusually<lb/> broad in all sectors while differing across regions (<ref type="table">Table 3</ref>).<lb/></p>

Universal service obligations in Belgium<lb/> By network sector<lb/> Sector<lb/> USO<lb/> Energy (electricity<lb/> and gas)<lb/> <lb/> Social tariffs for low income households.<lb/> <lb/> Free annual electricity quota for all Flemish households.<lb/> <lb/> Arrangements for households unable to pay bills.<lb/> <lb/> A fixed deduction for gas, electricity and fuel for each household.<lb/></table>

There are no procedures for<lb/> tendering social tariffs as these are imposed on all providers and funded through a fund to<lb/> which all market participants contribute. There are no legal tools to assess that the<lb/> USO provision actually constitutes an unfair burden, which would justify the additional<lb/> financing.

The Commission<lb/> authorised the deal in November 2006, amid concerns regarding the large role of the new company in specific<lb/> markets. Before the deal, the two companies had strong positions in the Belgian energy markets, thus the merger<lb/> posed problems of further increasing the concentration of the already highly concentrated energy sector.

			<head>The performance of the telecommunication sector over the past decade has been disappointing<lb/></head>

			<p>15.<lb/> Productivity growth in the telecommunication sector was well below that in most other OECD<lb/> countries (<ref type="table">Table 1</ref>) and consumers were often forced to pay higher prices than in neighbouring countries<lb/> and the introduction of new technologies was lagging. Although explicit barriers to entry do not seem to be<lb/> a problem in most segments of the market (<ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref>, Panel C), one of the most visible issues is the high<lb/> concentration of the sector.<lb/></p>

			<head>Fixed telephony<lb/></head>

			<p>16.<lb/> Following the liberalisation of telecommunications on 1 st January 1998, new entrants have not<lb/> been able to gain a strong position in some of the key segments of the market, which remained<lb/> concentrated in the hands of the majority state-owned incumbent Belgacom. Belgian broadband offers<lb/> remain on the expensive side in comparison to other OECD countries (<ref type="figure">Figure 7</ref>). Moreover, a particular<lb/> feature of the Belgian broadband is that practically all offers have monthly download quotas (bit-caps)<lb/> which tend to be lower than in other countries. This further raises the price of internet usage as exceeding<lb/> the quota entails an additional cost. 8 Furthermore, the Belgian consumer does not have access to top<lb/> technology (e.g. fibre-to-the-home) and the advertised speeds remain well below the fastest offers in<lb/> leading OECD countries (<ref type="figure">Figure 8</ref>). As a result, broadband penetration, among the highest in the OECD<lb/> in 2002, has since been growing slowly and is lower than in many countries (though still above average).<lb/> Finally, the Belgian consumer pays an excessive price for triple-play offers (broadband, TV and telephone)<lb/> while the offers are of inferior quality (<ref type="table">Table 5</ref> shows a comparison with France, where the regulator has<lb/> been particularly active in the telecom market).<lb/> 17.<lb/> Broadband is provided mainly through DSL lines and to a smaller, but still internationally high,<lb/> extent via cable. Local loop unbundling (LLU) of cable networks is technically infeasible and due to the<lb/> high concentration in the cable sector, this technology has failed to put sufficient competitive pressure on<lb/> the incumbent&apos;s DSL offer. In DSL itself, the main alternatives to the incumbent&apos;s offer are provided via<lb/> bitstream (renting capacity from the incumbent and reselling it) which is incapable of challenging the<lb/> incumbent&apos;s position as it does not allow for sufficient differentiation of products (e.g. providing television<lb/> over internet). Overall, the level of local loop unbundling of DSL lines is very low when compared with<lb/> OECD countries with a liberalised market, despite a comparable regulated price of provision. 9 Until 2007<lb/> this was largely a consequence of high (regulated) prices of unbundling, which have since been lowered to<lb/> internationally low levels (EC, 2008a). Nevertheless the latter development has failed to benefit the final<lb/> consumer. Part of the explanation is historical and the effects of lower tariffs should eventually be felt.<lb/> However, many costs related to unbundling remain high (e.g. collocation, installation and de-installation)<lb/> increasing the cost of entry. Secondly, for a number of years, the incumbent has failed to comply with<lb/> 8.<lb/> Caps generally prevail in countries where geography limits the connection to the rest of the world<lb/> (e.g. located on islands) and in principle Belgium&apos;s location does not explain the prevalence of caps.<lb/></p>

			<table>In 2008 only four OECD countries had 100% of offers with caps (Australia, New Zealand, Canada and<lb/> Belgium) while Iceland and Ireland had a domination of offers with caps (OECD broadband portal). The<lb/> average level of caps in Belgium was the second lowest in the OECD, of a range comparable with only<lb/> New Zealand (on average 20GB in 2008, but being as low as 250 MB in the low-end offers). Belgian<lb/> bit-caps are reached relatively fast, compared to the advertised maximum download speed and may impose<lb/> a higher de facto charge for high users. In mid-2008 one challenging provider started offering uncapped<lb/> downloads, but has since been followed by only one competitor (in December 2008).<lb/> 9.<lb/> By January 2008, out of over 1.6 million DSL lines, less than 40 000, that is 2.5% of the total, were fully<lb/> unbundled. In contrast, 18% of lines are unbundled on average in the EU 27, 31% in Germany, 23% in<lb/> France and 10% in the Netherlands.

			<p>requirements concerning the timing and quality of provisioning and servicing of lines, and the regulator<lb/> has failed to enforce these obligations. 10 Furthermore, the incumbent has appealed against almost all of<lb/> BIPT&apos;s decisions and cases get held up in the Court of Appeal or in some cases at the Competition Council<lb/> for a relatively long time given the dynamic nature of the sector. In the end BIPT&apos;s decisions were often<lb/> annulled on formal grounds, increasing uncertainty for new entrance (<ref type="biblio">Platform, 2007</ref>). Such developments<lb/> create an implicit barrier for new entrants, who face high uncertainty regarding the quality of services<lb/> provided by the incumbent, and therefore potential problems with assuring a high quality of the end<lb/> product.<lb/></p>

			<p>10.<lb/> The regulator generally has refrained from fining Belgacom. As regards local loop unbundling, by<lb/> July 2006 BIPT registered numerous complaints from the alternative operators about Belgacom not<lb/> meeting legal deadlines for line installation and service works. Instead of adopting a tough stance on the<lb/> violations BIPT effectively doubled legal time limits for Belgacom. This decision had an adverse impact<lb/> on consumer welfare instead of forcing the incumbent to devote additional resources to LLU and servicing.<lb/> The penalties for exceeding the maximum timeline were revised, detaching them from the monthly rental<lb/> fee, however they have been capped at relatively low levels. Since then the timing schedules are to be<lb/> reduced gradually, however despite recent improvements, Belgacom still seems to have problems fulfilling<lb/> them, but uses inevitable deviations from the forecasts on LLU which the competitors are obliged to<lb/> provide in order to avoid fines. Similarly, Belgacom&apos;s competitors give details on the problems BIPT has<lb/> experienced in forcing Belgacom to include ADSL2+ in to its reference offer for bit stream (despite<lb/> persistent refusal to fulfil BIPT&apos;s request no fine was issued). Only recently (<ref type="biblio">July 2008</ref>) a EUR 3 million<lb/> was issued for failing to comply with BIPT&apos;s decision on mobile phone charges.<lb/></p>

			<p>18.<lb/> The regulatory and legal framework was earlier criticised for lacking a consistent and systematic<lb/> approach and giving the impression of improvisation (<ref type="biblio">Dehousse and Zgajewski, 2003</ref>). The regulator&apos;s<lb/> powers still seem somewhat weaker when compared with the OECD best practice. Firstly, what is rather<lb/> unusual, dispute settlement is outside its competencies and is carried out by the Competition Council.<lb/> Second, the regulator appears to have fewer tools available to enforce its decisions than for<lb/> example regulators in Finland, Sweden and Spain (ECTA, 2008). BIPT is unable to impose periodic<lb/> penalties to ensure compliance, to suspend an introduction of an offer until the ex ante obligations are<lb/> fulfilled and is tied up by a strict confidentiality law. 11 Moreover, although BIPT&apos;s independence was<lb/> improved in 2003, there are indications it may still need strengthening in particular given the controlling<lb/> share of the state in the incumbent (Box 4). As a consequence, Belgacom is a significant contributor to the<lb/> federal budget, which leads to a potential conflict of interest: the state is a regulator in charge of promoting<lb/> competition and the state benefits from the incumbent&apos;s profits. Therefore, the privatisation of Belgacom<lb/> would further clarify the incentives to empower the sectoral regulator. In the past years, a number of<lb/> sources have accused the regulator of being under political influence (<ref type="biblio">Platform, 2007, ECTA, 2008,<lb/> Test-Achats, 2007, 2008</ref>) and of neglecting the enforcement of local loop unbundling (<ref type="biblio">Platform, 2007</ref>).<lb/> Each of these issues should be reviewed and addressed, so that the regulator can take an active part in<lb/> promoting competition on the telecom market in order to bring telecommunication productivity growth<lb/> more in line with other OECD countries and to allow consumers to benefit from lower prices and better<lb/> offers. This should be done primarily through a tough stance on the incumbent&apos;s violations, including a<lb/> determined use of fines in order to lower implicit entry costs and encourage LLU. Furthermore, any<lb/> pressures to dilute the regulatory powers, for example due to the overlaps of competencies with the<lb/> Community-level broadcast content regulators, should be strongly resisted. Notably, the government is<lb/> preparing a reform which should improve the powers of the regulator (Box 4).<lb/> 19.<lb/> Another important issue is the imposition of social tariffs on all the operators in fixed line<lb/> telephony and their funding (Box 5). The implementation of the social tariffs has raised numerous<lb/> problems, including the problems of competitors&apos; access to the database which would allow the<lb/> verification of eligibility (<ref type="biblio">Platform, 2007</ref>) which now seems to have been solved. Moreover the<lb/> compensation mechanism seems not to be in line with the EU&apos;s Universal Service Directive as there are no<lb/> legal instruments to establish whether provision of social tariffs constitutes an unfair burden. Due to the<lb/> larger share of those benefiting from social tariffs among Belgacom&apos;s clients, the fund risks being an<lb/> effective subsidy to the incumbent. If the government is determined to pursue the social tariff element of<lb/> universal service, it should consider periodically auctioning off the service in a competitive bid, or at the<lb/> least obliging the regulator to conduct investigations whether this service constitutes an unfair burden,<lb/> equipping it with the necessary legal tools. Last but not least, there could be concerns for the future<lb/> development of competition in the market if Belgacom upgrades its network using VDSL, since this<lb/> technology increases the cost of unbundling for new entrants. Therefore the regulator needs to examine<lb/> how to ensure competition with this technology (steps in this direction would include assuring access to<lb/> passive infrastructure and backhaul facilities). It is also desirable to encourage the development of<lb/> fibre-to-the-home (FTTH) technology.<lb/></p>

			<head>Mobile telephony<lb/></head>

			<p>20.<lb/> Mobile call charges in Belgium tend to be on the expensive side: low-usage charges appear close<lb/> to the OECD average, despite an internationally high number of virtual operators (MVNO&apos;s) and resellers<lb/> targeting this market, while high-usage prices are among the most expensive (<ref type="figure">Figure 9</ref>). Mobile phone<lb/> penetration is among the lowest in the EU, showing little signs of catching up. The market is divided<lb/> 11.<lb/> For example, the decision whether data passed on to BIPT is confidential or not is left to its author. No<lb/> motivation must be given, and the regulator cannot challenge this decision, thus the use of obtained data<lb/> may be</p>

			<table>limited.<lb/> between three network operators, including the dominant player Proximus, which is owned by the fixed<lb/> telephony incumbent, Belgacom. 12 The numerous resellers and MVNO&apos;s (above 25), contrary to other<lb/> countries, have failed to gain a significant market share and to bring down the price of mobile calls (the<lb/> combined market share remained below 1% by 2008, EC, 2008a). Mobile termination charges, despite<lb/> being lowered in 2008, remain well above those in competitive markets like the United Kingdom, Sweden<lb/> and Finland. Moreover, in 2008 the College of Competition Prosecutors has found evidence of the abuse of<lb/> dominant position by Belgacom Mobile (in the period 2002-2005) and the case is currently pending before<lb/> the Council (the complaint was filed in 2005). The incumbent&apos;s appeals against the lowering of termination<lb/> charges lead to lengthy legal procedures in the Court of Appeal and significantly increase uncertainty for<lb/> resellers.<lb/></table>

Prices for mobile phone calls tend to be high<lb/> Total price in USD, February 2008<lb/> 1.<lb/> The OECD basket of mobile telephone charges (high usage) includes subscription and usage (1680 minutes of voice calls, 660<lb/> SMS messages and 12 MMS, distributed between peak and off-peak hours and based on an average call duration) over a one-<lb/>year period. Calling patterns were all determined through extensive discussions with carriers across the OECD.<lb/> 2.<lb/> The OECD basket of mobile telephone charges (low usage) includes subscription and usage ((360 minutes of voice calls, 396<lb/> SMS messages and 8 MMS.<lb/> Source: OECD, Communications Outlook database.<lb/></figure>

			<p>21.<lb/> The regulator should focus on lowering mobile termination rates to meet the levels in the most<lb/> competitive markets. In order to assure that the business models of the resellers are not undermined by<lb/> uncertainty related to the incumbent challenging the regulator&apos;s decisions, the court cases should be<lb/> speeded up in order to assure that they better match the dynamic nature of the sector. This should be<lb/> achieved through appointing the Competition Council as the institution of appeal against all decision of the<lb/> regulator, which may possibly require increasing the</p>

			<table>Council&apos;s resources. In order for the reduction of<lb/> 12.<lb/> The three market players are Proximus (owned by Belgian fixed-line incumbent Belgacom) with 45-49%<lb/> of the market according to different estimates, Mobistar (owned by the French incumbent France Telecom)<lb/> with 31-34% of the market and BASE (owned by the Dutch incumbent KPN) with the remaining share of<lb/> around 20%.<lb/> mobile termination rates to benefit the final consumer, sufficient competitive pressure on retail and<lb/> wholesale prices must be assured. A desirable step in this direction, already under consideration by the<lb/> government is the introduction of the fourth network license. To facilitate the expansion of resellers and<lb/> the potential new operator, the long length of service contracts should be reduced by limiting their<lb/> maximum duration. The process for number portability should be streamlined to reduce the time taken to<lb/> port a number. As for the social tariffs, the benefits of the extension to mobile phones are disputable<lb/> (EC<ref type="biblio">, 2006</ref>). As in fixed telephony, if the government considers social tariffs desirable, it should consider<lb/> periodically auctioning off the service in a competitive bid and pay for it directly from the budget.<lb/></p>

			<head>Liberalisation in postal services and rail transport in lagging<lb/></head>

			<p>22.<lb/> The liberalisation of both the rail transport and postal services market is proceeding slowly, in<lb/> line with the requirements of the European Commission. The latter stipulates the eventual full opening of<lb/> both markets to competition: rail transport by January 2010 and postal services by January 2011. In the<lb/> postal services sector, while competition seems to be well in place in the courier services, it is practically<lb/> non-existent in the addressed letter segment (van der <ref type="biblio">Lijn et al., 2008</ref>). As a consequence, despite the<lb/> favourable characteristics of a relatively evenly spread, dense population, Belgian consumers suffer from<lb/> higher prices, in particular for letters, and from a poorer quality of services that in most neighbour<lb/> countries (Deutsche Post, 2008 and EC, 2008b). The sectoral regulator has, according to some sources,<lb/> been perceived as inactive in the field of postal services (<ref type="biblio">Baeke, 2008</ref>). Indeed the quality criteria agreed<lb/> with the State have not been met by the incumbent, but no sanctions were issued. Although the situation is<lb/> expected to improve as new sorting centres have been put in place, sanctions for the violation of preset<lb/> quality standards should be significant and automatic, leading to stronger incentives to improve the quality<lb/> of services. Moreover, new entry may be deterred by a number of additional Belgium-specific regulations.<lb/> These include a VAT exemption on certain services provided by the incumbent and a particularly broad<lb/> range of universal service obligations (Box 5). The former distorts the market, biasing the incumbent<lb/> towards servicing the residential market and the competitors towards the business market while the<lb/> broadness of USO&apos;s leads to a high cost of provision. 13 This may result in the subsidisation of the<lb/> incumbent who, even in a fully liberalised market, will remain the only player with sufficient infrastructure<lb/> to provide the broad USO&apos;s. Thus it would be desirable that each of the services currently included in the<lb/> USO bundle, if deemed indispensable by the government, to be separately auctioned off according to best<lb/> offer. Until then, the pricing should fully take into account the benefits of brand display.<lb/> 23.<lb/> As concerns rail transport, virtually no steps have been taken towards opening the passenger<lb/> transport market to competition. The freight market is legally open for international connections since<lb/> January 2006 and one year later for national connections, but remains strongly dominated by the<lb/> state-owned incumbent. The publicly owned incumbent consists of the monopolist passenger transport<lb/> service provider, the dominant freight service provider and the infrastructure operator. The passenger and<lb/> freight segments have separate accounts while the infrastructure operator is required to be legally separated<lb/> from the service providers. However, this separation is incomplete due to overlaps in terms of high level<lb/> personnel. The sectoral regulator, which remains an agency within the Ministry of Transport, is in need of<lb/> strengthening and more independence in order to assure non-discriminatory third party access to tracks,<lb/> slots and marshalling facilities. Moreover at the moment, passenger connections are negotiated between the<lb/> infrastructure operator, the monopoly service provider and the state which has a monopsonistic position.<lb/> 13.<lb/> The lack of VAT on postal services provided by La Poste in the area subject to USO gives an advantage to<lb/> the incumbent towards customers unable to reclaim their VAT (mainly households) and a disadvantage<lb/> towards other customers. Households, pay the nominal price on which the incumbent does not pay VAT.<lb/> Business customers also pay the nominal price but they can reclaim the VAT from the competitors&apos; price<lb/> while not from the incumbent&apos;s price. Moreover, as the incumbent uses inputs subject to VAT, it cannot<lb/> reclaim the tax when offering a service not subject to value added taxation.<lb/> Once the market is liberalised lower levels of governments should be empowered to purchase desired<lb/> services (as for example in Germany) to introduce a more market-based provision of services.<lb/> Strengthening the regulator, finalising the legal separation and changes in the service acquisition<lb/> framework are recommended along with the swift full opening up to competition. Finally, successful<lb/> introduction of competition in the rail sector would also be facilitated by a uniform, market-oriented<lb/> approach to universal service across the network sectors in order to guarantee a level playing field and to<lb/> avoid entry barriers to new competitors.<lb/></p>

			<head>Conclusion<lb/> 24.<lb/></head>

			<p>Recent reforms of competition policy enforcement and the favourable stance of the government<lb/> towards more competition constitute undeniable progress towards more competitive domestic markets.<lb/> However, this may not suffice to bring productivity in certain sectors, such as retail distribution,<lb/> telecommunication and energy, in line with that of the leading OECD countries. In order to reap the full<lb/> benefits of liberalisation in terms of higher productivity and employment growth as well as competitive<lb/> prices, further steps need to be taken. Overall, the system of regulation as a whole may need<lb/> reconsideration in order to be aimed at a clearly defined, efficient role of each regulatory authority and at<lb/> securing effective cooperation between the authorities. A number of additional policy measures which<lb/> should be taken in order to assure that Belgian consumers benefit from competition on the market are<lb/> summarised in Box 7 below.<lb/></p>

			<head>Box 7. Policy recommendations to enhance competition<lb/> The Competition Authority needs further strengthening<lb/></head>

			<p> The effective independence and the accountability of the Competition Authority should be monitored, in<lb/> order to assess whether further strengthening in these areas is necessary. Resources may need to be<lb/> reviewed and eventually increased to levels observed in other small economies with a proactive competition<lb/> enforcement stance.<lb/>  In order to avoid foregoing or postponing important cases and to allow the Competition Authority to adopt a<lb/> more proactive role in analysing the market, its resources should be increased. The Competition Council<lb/> should be established as the institution of appeal against all the decisions of the sectoral regulators.<lb/>  In order to improve deterrence, the law should provide for criminal sanctions for hard-core cartel<lb/> infringements. High fines should not be avoided as they deter anticompetitive practices and increase the<lb/> attractiveness of applying for leniency. Confidentiality rules should be reviewed and possibly loosened with<lb/> a goal of facilitating the cooperation of the Authority with network sector regulators.<lb/></p>

			<head>Competition-burdening regulation in retail distribution should be abolished<lb/></head>

			<p> In order to benefit from the competitive nature of the retail sector, with the goal of creating employment,<lb/> improving purchasing power and bringing productivity in line with other OECD countries, the competition<lb/> inhibiting regulation should be scrapped (e.g. restrictions on sales below cost, opening hours and tied sales,<lb/> black-out periods). Zoning laws for large outlets should be restricted to evaluating spatial effects (urban<lb/> planning, access, safety) in order to assure they do not protect existing retailers against new competition.<lb/></p>

			<head>Sectoral regulation needs to focus on implicit barriers to new entry<lb/></head>

			<p> To improve the effectiveness of regulatory action in the energy sectors, the complicated regulatory structure<lb/> should be reconsidered. Reforming the setup to establish a single, independent nationwide regulator with<lb/> competencies including the areas of distribution and supply of gas and electricity in order to deal with the<lb/> local monopolies, should reduce the bureaucratic procedures and the burdens for new entrants.<lb/> Alternatively the binding co-operation procedures between the regulatory bodies should be introduced in<lb/> order to align the objectives of regional regulators, increase the efficiency of communication procedures.<lb/> Independence of the regional regulators from the governments should be assured.<lb/>  In order to facilitate new entry, ownership separation between different segments of the electricity and gas<lb/> markets should be considered. For the same reason, regulatory efforts should be strengthen to ensure that<lb/> the ban on cross-subsidisation between electricity and gas markets is enforced.<lb/></p>

			<p> New entry should be promoted by improving the role of the wholesale exchange and reconsidering the<lb/> universal service obligations (USOs) and their variation across regions. If sub-federal governments wish to<lb/> implement additional social policies they should finance it from their own budget rather than through<lb/> distribution tariffs.<lb/>  In the electricity sector further efforts should be made to increase interconnection capacity, encourage new<lb/> entry and continue auctioning off of the incumbent&apos;s production capacity.<lb/>  An anonymous wholesale pool for gas should be developed in order to facilitate new entry. Assuring strong<lb/> vertical separation, between the Zeebrugge gas hub and the LNG terminal on the one hand, and the<lb/> dominant players in the energy market on the other is strongly advised in order to assure third party access.<lb/> The effectiveness of recent measures to reduce long contract lengths in the gas wholesale market should<lb/> be evaluated and if necessary new measures should be adopted.<lb/></p>

			<head>The telecommunication regulator needs to toughen its stance against incumbent&apos;s violations<lb/></head>

			<p> The regulator should be given the ability to introduce periodic penalties and to block the introduction of<lb/> offers if ex ante conditions are not fulfilled. Furthermore, the regulators independence may need explicit<lb/> strengthening while the government should proceed with the privatization of the incumbent.<lb/></p>

			<head> In fixed telephony</head>

			<p>the regulator should increase efforts to encourage local loop unbundling (LLU) through<lb/> strengthening its stance on the incumbents violations in the areas of deadlines for LLU provision, service<lb/> level agreements, collocation and the quality of services provided. Fines for the incumbent&apos;s violations<lb/> should be used more widely and preferably be automatic. The regulator should strongly promote<lb/> competition in new generation networks.<lb/>  In order to avoid inefficient complication of the regulatory structure and the dilution of powers, any pressure<lb/> from Community-level broadcasting regulators to gain power to regulate transmission infrastructure should<lb/> be strongly opposed.<lb/></p>

			<head> In mobile telephony</head>

			<p>the regulator should increase efforts to lower the mobile termination charges and to<lb/> decrease the uncertainty surrounding its decisions through a better preparation to defend them in court.<lb/></p>

			<p> The fourth network operator should be introduced as soon as possible. Maximum contract duration should<lb/> be reduced in order to increase flexibility and facilitate entry. USOs should be funded from the government<lb/> budget via competitive tendering.<lb/></p>

			<figure>Faster opening up of the other network sectors is essential<lb/>  Competition should be introduced in all segments of postal services. Efforts to decrease entry barriers<lb/> should be increased: the scope of USOs should be reconsidered and the clause on additional fund for USO<lb/> financing should be eliminated. Again USO&apos;s (each service individually) should be financed directly from the<lb/> budget through competitive tenders.<lb/>  Faster opening up of the rail transport sector should be accompanied with strengthening the independence<lb/> and powers of the regulator.<lb/> ECO/WKP(2009)77</figure>
