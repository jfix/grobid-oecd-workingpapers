C.<lb/> Major policy objectives<lb/> 14.<lb/> The major policy objectives of export restrictions are:<lb/> •<lb/> Fiscal receipts or revenue purposes (export duties).<lb/> o Export duties may be seen as a reliable source of revenue, particularly in LDCs. 9 The<lb/> relative ease of implementing tax regulations through customs may make this an attractive<lb/> option for governments. Especially when international price is high, applying high tax<lb/> rates is sometimes used to address equity issues.<lb/> o This source of revenue is becoming less important for many countries. Although TPR<lb/> reports do not provide consistent data for all countries, the share of export duties in<lb/> government revenue is falling in several countries. In Ghana, the share of export duties in<lb/> total government revenue decreased from 11.4% (1998) to 2.3% (2005). In Thailand, the<lb/> contribution of export taxes to government revenue was only 0.3% of total tax revenue in<lb/> 2005/06. The Philippine authorities also indicated that revenue from export taxes was<lb/> minimal.<lb/> o The exception is Argentina. Between 2002 and 2005, income from export duties<lb/> represented 9.9% of total public revenue. Following the peso devaluation in 2002, all<lb/> Argentine exports were again made subject to export duties. Since 2002, successive<lb/> resolutions have altered export tax rates, with increases on a significant number of<lb/> products. As of mid-2006, the applicable duties were 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 and 45% on the<lb/> f.o.b. value, depending on the products in question. However, during the TPR Q&amp;A in<lb/> 2007, several Members questioned the necessity of this high tax rates considering change<lb/> of the economic situation during the last five years.<lb/> •<lb/> To protect and promote downstream processing industries by providing domestic industries with<lb/> cheap raw materials and inputs.</table>
