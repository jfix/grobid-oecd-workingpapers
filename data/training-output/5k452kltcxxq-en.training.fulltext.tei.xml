			<head>ABSTRACT/RÉSUMÉ<lb/> Challenges to sustain Poland&apos;s growth model<lb/></head>

			<p>Notwithstanding a very strong economic performance over the past decade or so, Poland&apos;s per capita<lb/> income is substantially lower in comparison with the United States and per capita income growth will be<lb/> sharply slowing down over the coming decades under the scenario of gradual policy changes mostly<lb/> because of population ageing. Bold structural reforms are needed to boost labour productivity and labour<lb/> resource utilisation. This paper argues that in order to increase labour resource utilisation, policy action<lb/> should focus on raising the effective retirement age, encourage childbearing and lower high unemployment<lb/> rates for young people and the unskilled via increased and more efficient active labour market policies.<lb/> Labour productivity could be boosted via rendering the tax system more growth friendly, reducing product<lb/> market regulation (including heavy government involvement in the economy, high administrative costs of<lb/> running and starting businesses and increasing competition in uncompetitive segments of the economy).<lb/> Investing in human capital and encouraging innovation are also essential for long-term productivity<lb/> growth.<lb/></p>

			<head>Past growth performance has been strong<lb/></head>

			<p>Poland has recorded robust GDP growth since the beginning of the transition process and a strong<lb/> resilience during the global crisis, which led to pronounced gains in the standards of living. The average<lb/> annual growth rate in GDP per capita reached 4.0% between 2000 and 2011, against 1.8% for the OECD<lb/> average, and was higher than in other Central and Eastern European countries (<ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>). Between 2000<lb/> and 2011, rises in labour productivity fed the catch-up process mainly owing to advances in multi-factor<lb/> productivity, whose contribution to per capita income growth was more than 3 percentage points. The<lb/> liberalisation of the domestic economy coupled with greater knowledge and technology transfers from<lb/> abroad led to major improvements in labour efficiency. However, despite significant increases in the<lb/> capital stock, capital intensity subtracted 0.5 percentage point from annual growth in GDP per capita. This<lb/> was similar to the Slovak Republic but in contrast with a positive contribution recorded in Estonia,<lb/> Hungary and Slovenia. Poland&apos;s growth model benefitted comparatively less from foreign direct<lb/> investment inflows and from a business climate and regulations less conducive to greater investments.<lb/> Human capital contributed positively to growth by almost 0.5 percentage point, more than for other<lb/> regional peers. This reflects Poland&apos;s progress in educational attainment and the quality of its secondary<lb/> education as confirmed by good PISA (Programme for International Student Assessment) scores, in<lb/> particular in mathematics and science. Finally, steady decreases in the unemployment rate underpinned<lb/> employment rises and growth, notably driven by better training of the unemployed, a higher share of<lb/> workers with better qualifications and less labour market mismatch (<ref type="biblio">Kierzenkowski et al., 2008</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<figure>But there is a long way to go to close the per capita income gap to the most advanced OECD nations<lb/></figure>

			<p>Despite a strong performance over the recent past, per capita income is almost 90% lower than in the<lb/> United States, and this gap is mainly explained by a shortfall in labour productivity (<ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>). 2 Even<lb/> though overall labour resource utilisation is not significantly lagging, its breakdown shows that average<lb/> annual hours worked are high and the activity rate is low. The combination of low labour market<lb/> participation and high unemployment results in a low employment rate. The participation rate of the<lb/> working-age population (15 to 64 years) in Poland is among the lowest in Europe: around 65% against<lb/> rates close or even beyond 80% in the Nordic countries. The major explanation is reduced activity of older<lb/> workers, low-skilled workers and women. <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref> shows that only every second individual between<lb/></p>

			<p>the age of 50 to 6 years is active against four out of five in Iceland and Sweden. Even more striking is the<lb/> fact that fewer than one-third of those with low educational attainment participates in the labour market,<lb/> which compares with nearly 80% in Iceland and 70% in Switzerland. Female participation is also low in a<lb/> European context, even though the absolute level of 60% is less striking.<lb/></p>

			<p>These low participation rates are a heritage of transition from central planning to a market economy:<lb/> the collapse of heavy industry after the start of the economic transformation left behind a mass of<lb/> low-skilled middle-aged men and women, who did not have the ability to update their human capital.<lb/> Disability and early retirement pension schemes offered them an escape route to withdraw from the labour<lb/> market. OECD data indicate that the effective retirement age in Poland is among the lowest in the OECD,<lb/> especially for women, and that the gap between the effective and the official retirement age is substantial.<lb/> In addition, public spending on incapacity benefits amounted to almost 3% of GDP in 2007, above the<lb/> OECD average, but close to figures of fellow transition countries, indicating the large number of<lb/> individuals involved.<lb/></p>

			<head>Population ageing is a major challenge for growth<lb/></head>

			<p>Recent OECD long-term projections suggest that Poland&apos;s growth model will face major challenges<lb/> as the population ages owing to declines in fertility and overall gains in longevity (<ref type="biblio">Johansson et al., 2012</ref>).<lb/> These projections indicate that per capita income growth will be among the lowest over the decades to<lb/> come (<ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>). The share of the working-age population (15-64) in the total, currently above 70%, is<lb/> projected to drop to below 55% by 2060. In parallel, the old-age dependency ratio measuring the share of<lb/> the population older than 65 to working-age population (15-64) is expected to jump from around 20% in<lb/></p>

At unchanged policies, these developments<lb/> should lead to one of the largest declines in labour force participation in the OECD over the next 50 years,<lb/> by more than 10 percentage points among the population older than 15 years. They would only be slightly<lb/> contained by gradual structural reforms in the baseline scenario, notably built under the assumption of<lb/> further trend expansion in educational attainment, an indexation of the legal pensionable age to life<lb/> expectancy and a convergence of comparatively stringent product market regulations to the average<lb/> regulatory stance observed in the OECD. As a result, population ageing will be a major drag on trend<lb/> growth, which should be mainly driven by efficiency improvements and, to a much smaller extent,<lb/> improvements in human capital. More precisely, Poland&apos;s growth in GDP per capita is projected to fall in<lb/> the baseline scenario from 4.4% between 1995 and 2011 to 2.6% over the next 20 years and to only 1.4%<lb/> between 2030 and 2060. The catching-up should be slow: the gap in GDP per capita vis-à-vis the<lb/> United States would shrink by about 20 percentage points over the next 50 years but still be as high as 70%<lb/> in 2060.<lb/></table>

			<head>Policy measures are needed to sustain Poland&apos;s high economic growth<lb/></head>

			<p>Bold policies are needed to counteract the adverse effects of population ageing as we saw that per<lb/> capita income growth will be sharply slowing down in Poland over the coming decades under the scenario<lb/> of gradual policy changes. To head off such daunting developments, policymakers have to act more<lb/> forcefully to boost labour productivity and labour resource utilisation.<lb/></p>

			<head>Increasing labour resource utilisation<lb/></head>

			<p>Poland&apos;s population ageing is projected to be one of the most pronounced in the OECD, and an<lb/> increasing dependency ratio will reduce labour utilisation. Let us start by looking at ways how policies<lb/> could counteract such developments in Poland.<lb/></p>

			<p>The first avenue for policy action is to keep people longer at work by increasing the effective<lb/> retirement age. Poland implemented, in a very well thought out manner, a comprehensive pension system<lb/> reform in 1999: the first pillar based on notional accounts, and the accompanying fully-funded second<lb/> pillar, both ensuring actuarial neutrality. Such a system offers people the choice to work longer and receive<lb/></p>

			<p>higher pension benefits or to retire earlier but at the expense of a lower pension. Because the calculation of<lb/> pension benefits is related, in an automatic fashion, to life expectancy, longer lives would mean that people<lb/> would need to work longer to get decent old-age pensions. Nevertheless, the legal retirement age serves as<lb/> an important social benchmark and influences people&apos;s retirement decisions. Also, people may be short<lb/> sighted and realise that they should have worked longer only when they receive the pension benefits.<lb/> Hence, it is important for the government to increase the legal retirement age in line with or even beyond<lb/> gains in life expectancy and to improve the population&apos;s financial education so that people understand they<lb/> should work longer (OECD, 2012). The 2012 pension reform raised the legal retirement age to 67 both for<lb/> men (from 65) and women (from 62) – even though some potentially generous early retirement<lb/> possibilities were opened up to mitigate this increase (OECD, 2013). This reform was welcome but<lb/> additional policy steps are needed to reduce the negative impact of declining labour utilisation on growth.<lb/> But people will be able to work longer only if they age in a healthy manner. In order to improve the<lb/> relatively poor health status of the Polish population (which can be partly explained by the country&apos;s level<lb/> of economic development), OECD (2012) recommended among other things that the authorities:<lb/> i) improve access to health care, ii) enhance hospital management, iii) carefully design new private health<lb/> insurance and iv) develop a long-term-care strategy.<lb/></p>

			<p>Policymakers could further increase participation rates by effectively closing channels of early<lb/> retirement. In particular, the government should continue to further align, following the 2012 pension<lb/> reform, the generous early retirement schemes of members of the uniformed services and eliminate those<lb/> for judges and miners (<ref type="biblio">OECD, 2013</ref>). An important driver of the low female activity rate at older ages are<lb/> generous survivors&apos; pension benefits. Women do not need to have a full career to benefit from an old-age<lb/> pension, especially if their partners pass away earlier (which is likely given men&apos;s lower life expectancy).<lb/> According to the OECD&apos;s social expenditure database, spending on survivors&apos; benefits accounted for 2%<lb/> of GDP in 2007, well above the OECD average of 1%. The costs of survivors&apos; benefits should be<lb/> internalised either via higher contribution rates imposed on the primary earner or through a lower pension<lb/> benefit if the pension is to be passed on to the survivor partner. Internalising these costs would incentivise<lb/> women to work longer. Female labour market participation is also limited by the fact that in 2008 the<lb/> length of the post-maternity parental leave in Poland was almost three years and the highest in the entire<lb/> OECD. This keeps mothers too long away from the labour market, especially in the case of consecutive<lb/> childbearing, and thus permanently lowers female participation.<lb/> The dependency ratio will rise not only because people will live longer but also because Poland&apos;s<lb/> fertility rate is about 1.4, well below the level needed to stabilise the population. Low fertility rates will<lb/> determine the size of the working-age population for the coming decades. Yet, looking further ahead,<lb/> policymakers should start to consider how to encourage childbearing. Empirical studies find that family<lb/> policies that diminish the cost of raising children via a combination of financial and non-financial<lb/> incentives, have a significant effect on fertility rates in the OECD (D&apos;<ref type="biblio">Addio and Mira D&apos;Ercole, 2005;<lb/> Luci and Thévenon, 2012</ref>). In Poland, financial incentives are not particularly generous. Also, the<lb/> insufficient number of places in pre-school childcare makes it difficult to reconcile family life with work<lb/> and discourages childbearing. But the insufficient provision of pre-school childcare also contributes to the<lb/> low female participation rate as the opportunity cost of staying at home is low especially for low-income<lb/> women. Therefore, the government would be well advised to come up with a coherent family policy<lb/> framework and in particular to develop pre-school childcare infrastructure (OECD, 2013).<lb/> Persistently high unemployment rates are also an important factor of subdued labour utilisation. The<lb/> unemployment rate is high for young people and the unskilled. Active labour market policies, including<lb/> activation and retraining, are essential to get back people into jobs. Poland clearly has a deficit in this area.<lb/> The taxation of labour income can also act as a drag on the demand for and the supply of labour. The cuts<lb/> in personal income taxes and social security contributions decided in 2008 lowered the tax wedge relative<lb/> to the OECD average but were partly offset by a rise in the disability pension contributions and the<lb/> nominal freeze of the personal income tax schedule. In fact, the OECD has for a long time advocated<lb/> changing the tax mix by shifting taxes from labour (and capital) to those that penalise growth less: green<lb/> taxes and property taxes.<lb/></p>

			<head>Boosting labour productivity<lb/></head>

			<p>The government should consider reforming the tax system also because shifting the tax burden to less<lb/> harmful taxes would spur productivity gains via capital deepening (more investment). Eliminating many<lb/> tax expenditures and ensuring more neutrality across different asset classes would also contribute to a<lb/> better allocation of productive resources and reduce administrative and tax-compliance costs. The<lb/> preferential tax treatment and the generous health insurance system for farmers (KRUS) lead to resource<lb/> misallocation and inefficiencies in the agricultural sector. Insufficient supply of private housing rentals in<lb/> urban areas impedes workers&apos; geographical mobility and thus efficient resource reallocation.<lb/></p>

			<p>Another important aspect policymakers need to look into in Poland is product market regulation.<lb/> Despite successive privatisation programmes launched in 2008, the State still plays an important role in the<lb/> economy. There is indeed no economic reason why the government should be involved in potentially<lb/> competitive segments of network industries, the financial sector, airport operators, and the mining and<lb/> chemical industries. Less government involvement would improve allocative efficiency and thus boost<lb/> productivity. But indirect government interference via complicated regulations also puts an unnecessary<lb/> burden on doing business. According to government estimates, the costs of regulation for businesses<lb/> amounts to 5% of GDP per year. Against this background, the authorities launched a programme to cut red<lb/> tape and to simplify legislation governing the economy. Yet, according to the World Bank&apos;s Doing<lb/> Business 2012 report, it takes a month to set up a business and almost a year to obtain construction permits,<lb/> and it is very complicated to pay taxes (OECD, 2012). The government is aware of these difficulties but it<lb/> should push ahead more firmly in these areas. It is welcome that it intends to liberalise a large number of<lb/> professional services.<lb/> Competition in mining, electricity, gas and telecommunications is unsatisfactory. Beyond government<lb/> disengagement from these sectors, an improved overall regulatory framework would enforce more<lb/> competition (including in broadband internet), which in turn could help spur productivity. Financial<lb/> deepening, essential for better access to credit, could be promoted via a consolidation of the fragmented<lb/> landscape of co-operative banks and an improved legal framework for the use of collateral (OECD, 2012).<lb/> Network infrastructures are still not very well developed. Despite considerable efforts to expand the<lb/> motorway and highway networks, to a large extent financed by EU funds, there is scope to improve the<lb/> road network. Similarly, the railway network needs to be upgraded further. The World Bank&apos;s Doing<lb/> Business 2012 argues that it is not easy for firms to get connected to the electricity network. This is partly<lb/> so because of the poor state of the distribution network, which critically needs investment. Because of the<lb/> relative underdevelopment of these networks, additional investment would most likely improve<lb/> productivity.<lb/> Upgrading human capital is crucial for long-term productivity growth. Skill mismatches remain<lb/> significant in the Polish economy, despite rising educational attainment. Against this background, the<lb/> government recently announced that more emphasis will be put on hard sciences in tertiary education. The<lb/> primary and secondary educational system has gained strength over time, reflected in improved PISA<lb/> scores. The 2011 tertiary education reform aims to develop vocational education. Further improvement<lb/> could be achieved by enhancing the adult training system and encouraging lifelong learning, increasing a<lb/> feedback loop between the education system and the economy&apos;s needs.
