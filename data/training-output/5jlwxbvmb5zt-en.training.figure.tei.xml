            <figDesc>Despite this restriction, a coherent picture arises in the investigated literature (see overview in<lb/> the extended version of this paper): When non-mobile students are used as a reference group, studying<lb/> abroad exerts an effect with respect to the chosen location of graduates&apos; labour market entry.<lb/> 87.<lb/> For a short-to medium-term perspective (one to seven years after graduation), Parey and<lb/> Waldinger (2011) and Di Pietro (2012) reported – whilst accounting for potential endogeneity of the<lb/> decision to study abroad – that Erasmus participation increases likelihood of starting the working career<lb/> abroad by 12 to 24 percentage points. Wiers-Jenssen (2008) presented smaller values, between 2 and 4<lb/> percentage points, which come close to the OLS-benchmark values of the first two publications.<lb/> Oosterbeek and Webbink (2011) provided evidence that studying abroad also affects high achieving<lb/> students, with a stay abroad lowering the likelihood of starting working life in the country of origin by 30<lb/> percentage points.</figDesc>

            <figDesc>110.<lb/> Within their analysis of locational and work place choice of Dutch graduates, Venhorst et al.<lb/> (2010) examined possible determinants of staying in peripheral regions of the Netherlands. They indicated<lb/> that students born outside of Europe were in general much more likely to leave these regions for work<lb/> abroad than to stay. This effect was even more pronounced for students from other European countries.<lb/> 24<lb/> If the distance between the home country&apos;s capital and the closest US gateway increased by 1000 miles, the<lb/> stay rate increased by 3.4 percentage points. The distance was likely to capture monetary and psychological<lb/> migration costs, thus staying would be a strategy to avoid the costs of re-migration to the country of origin.<lb/> 25<lb/> Rosenzweig (2006) calculated a stock depreciation rate, using asan unadjusted numerator students with an<lb/> F-1 visa who adjusted their status within a seven month period in 2003, rather than twelve months. In the<lb/> model specification, GDP in the source country is excluded &quot; as financing cost should not be a<lb/> significant factor for the decision to return &quot; . Rosenzwieg&apos;s model of returning behaviour includes<lb/> university ranking variables. In a subsequent version Rosenzweig (2008) accounts for average GDP growth<lb/> but not the possible impact of overall wealth of a source country.</figDesc>

Overall results insinuate a weak preference for the<lb/> two-part specifications.<lb/> 145.<lb/> For all three different stay rates to be investigated, some common results can be derived from<lb/> the GCI specification: bilateral time-invariant factors play a predominant role. If destination and source<lb/> country share a common official language the stay rate is between 3.7 and 6.3 percentage points higher for<lb/> students from such a country of origin. The effect of colonial ties after 1945 is similarly pronounced but<lb/> less frequently significant. The impact of distance is also non-negligible. If the distance between capitals<lb/> was to increase by one percent beyond 1000 kilometres 37 observed stay rates decline on average by 0.61 to<lb/> 0.84 percentage points.<lb/> 35<lb/> Alternative specifications including lagged differences have been tested. These yielded neither substantial<lb/> changes in other variables estimated coefficients nor in additional robust insights into the dynamic<lb/> influence of GDP per capita or unemployment differentials.<lb/> 36<lb/> The stock of migrants is based on the OECD&apos;s DIOC database 2010 and has been restricted to those being<lb/> at least 35 years old. The restriction has been adopted to limit the likelihood that the derived share of<lb/> migrants includes also internationally mobile students whose numbers are actually an integral part of the<lb/> stay rate to be explained.<lb/> 37<lb/> Average marginal effects &apos;dy/ex&apos; have the interpretation of semi-elasticities. Since marginal effects are not<lb/> constant, but depending on the reference distance, reported results referring to a specific value deliver a<lb/> more precise picture. Alternative specifications accounted for non-linearities as well. The quadratic<lb/> distance showed up to be insignificant.</figDesc>

Bijward and Wang (2013) provided evidence that<lb/> some individuals opt to stay in the country with higher unemployment rates. On the other hand, Vasiljeva<lb/> (2014) identified in her analysis no significant effect of unemployment differentials.</figDesc>

            <figDesc>).<lb/> 151.<lb/> Furthermore, the diaspora effect seems to be robust across almost all specifications. If the share<lb/> of migrants from a specific country of origin increases from 0.1 to 0.101 percent 39 , observed stay rates tend<lb/> to be higher by 0.95 to 2.8 percentage points.<lb/> 152.<lb/> Average WGI score differentials have been constructed in accordance with the 90 percent<lb/> confidence intervals from Kaufmann et al. (2010) 40 . The aspect of &apos;government effectiveness&apos; bears across<lb/> all types of stay rates and model specifications significant explanatory power: if a destination country<lb/> scores on average always significantly above a country of origin, stay rates are between 4.8 and 8.7<lb/> percentage points higher; if the country of origin performs better in this regard, stay rates are typically 10<lb/> to 11.4 percent smaller. All six specifications thus point to the fact that international graduates have a<lb/> certain preference to settle in the country which has more effective government and better public services.<lb/> 153.<lb/> Similarly, if a source country scores on average better in the domain of &apos;voice and<lb/> accountability&apos;, the average staying likelihood decreases by 13.6 to 16.1 percentage points 41 .<lb/> 39<lb/> Respective shares have a mean of 0.04 percent and a maximum of 10 percent. The chosen reference value<lb/> of 0.1 percent was already in the highest decile.<lb/> 40<lb/> &apos;DC&gt;OC&apos; indicates that the average score difference for the years 2010 to 2012 was always positive whilst<lb/> the 90% confidence intervals of both countries&apos; scores were always non-overlapping. This implies that the<lb/> resulting difference is in fact significant. The reference category for the WGI differential indicator consists<lb/> of those observations which displayed in at least one year an insignificant score differential. Based on the<lb/> indicators distribution it can be concluded that country-pairs in the reference group displayed a comparably<lb/> high degree of similarity in the specific domain.<lb/> 41<lb/> The positive marginal effect for SR 1A highlights the issue associated with much smaller sample size and a<lb/> reduced set of involved countries.</figDesc>

High-skilled workers are identified based on the ISCO-08 classification. 177.<lb/> Figure 11 depicts the changes between 2002 and 2010 in hourly average real wages of high-<lb/>skilled employees for three different sectorial aggregates. The sample has been restricted to those below 30<lb/> years of age to represent the entry ages after university graduation.<lb/> 178.<lb/> In almost all EU member states which acceded in the 2004 enlargement, average real wages<lb/> surged. This can be attributed to a large extent to a catching-up process, since in 2010 the average hourly<lb/> wages are still clearly below the wages in the old EU member states.<lb/> 179.<lb/> Most of the older EU member states experienced moderate real wage increases for young<lb/> professionals. However, some of them welcomed high-skilled labour market entrants with decreasing real<lb/> wages, with the United Kingdom leading the way. Here, &quot; each cohort of graduates since the financial crisis<lb/> is earning less than the one before &quot; . &quot; New graduates who earned £15,000 or more in 2011-12 – enough to<lb/> start repaying their loans – were paid on average 12 per cent less in real terms than graduates at the same<lb/> stage of their careers in 2007-08 &quot; (Financial Times, 2013).<lb/> 180.<lb/> For the EU as a whole, the picture looks similar: across all high-skilled occupations, real wages<lb/> declined between 2002 and 2010 by 6.9 to 34.3 percent. This is not exclusively a result to the financial<lb/> crisis: between 2002 and 2006 young professionals employed in the field of &apos;Education; human health and<lb/> social work activities; arts, entertainment and recreation; other service activities&apos; benefitted from a real<lb/> average wage growth of 4.4 percent – while young high-skilled workers in the remaining eight groups<lb/> experienced a decline of average real wages of 1.5 to 17.4 percent.</figDesc>
