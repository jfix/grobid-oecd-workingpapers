Cross-country evidence from firm level data <lb/>This paper exploits longitudinal data on firm performance and patenting activity for 23 OECD countries <lb/>over the period 2003-2010 to explore the extent to which changes in the patent stock are associated with <lb/>flows of capital and labour to patenting firms. While the finding that patenting is associated with real <lb/>changes in economic activity at the firm level is in line with recent literature, new empirical evidence <lb/>presented suggests that the impact of patenting on firm size is likely to be causal. Moreover, these data <lb/>reveal important differences across OECD countries in the extent to which innovative firms can attract the <lb/>complementary tangible resources that are required to implement and commercialise new ideas. In turn, the <lb/>contribution of framework policies to explaining the observed cross-country differences in the magnitude <lb/>of these flows is explored. While further research is required to establish causality, the results are <lb/>consistent with the idea that well-functioning product, labour and capital markets; efficient judicial systems <lb/>and bankruptcy laws that do not overly penalise failure can raise the returns to innovative activity. The <lb/>paper also investigates the heterogeneous impacts of policies and finds that young firms – which are more <lb/>likely to experiment with disruptive technologies and rely on external financing to implement and <lb/>commercialise their ideas – disproportionately benefit from reforms to labour markets and more developed <lb/>markets for credit and seed and early stage finance. <lb/>JEL classification codes: O30, O31, O33, O34, L25 <lb/>Keywords: Innovation, patents, reallocation, firm growth. <lb/>*********************** <lb/>Les ressources convergent-elles vers les entreprises brevetantes ?

CROSS-COUNTRY EVIDENCE FROM <lb/>FIRM-LEVEL DATA <lb/>By <lb/>Dan Andrews, Chiara Criscuolo and Carlo Menon 1 <lb/></front>

			<body>1. <lb/>Introduction <lb/>1. <lb/>While innovation-based growth – underpinned by investments in knowledge-based capital <lb/>(KBC) – is central to raising long-term living standards, there are important differences across OECD <lb/>countries in investments in KBC and innovative capacity, which carry important implications for aggregate <lb/>productivity performance (OECD 2010; Andrews and Criscuolo, 2013). One possible explanation for these <lb/>patterns at the aggregate level is that the returns to innovation vary across OECD countries, which provide <lb/>firms in some countries with a greater incentive to innovate. The returns to innovation are partly influenced <lb/>by the ease with which innovative firms can attract sufficient tangible resources to underpin the <lb/>implementation and commercialisation of new ideas, which will in turn reflect the ability of national <lb/>economies to reallocate scarce resources toward the most innovative firms over time. In this context, <lb/>adjustment frictions preventing the (re)allocation of resources towards their most productive use can <lb/>significantly affect aggregate innovation and productivity outcomes (Bartelsman et al., 2013). 2 Given the <lb/>potential for public policy to affect resource flows (Andrews and Cingano, 2014; Bravo-Biosca et al., <lb/>2013), this paper explores the extent to which public policies shape the ability of innovative firms to attract <lb/>capital and labour. <lb/>2. <lb/>This paper draws on an emerging literature from the United States, which utilises firm level <lb/>longitudinal data on firms&apos; patenting activity and performance to examine what happens when firms patent. <lb/>While patenting is an imperfect measure of innovation, these studies show that patenting tends to be <lb/>1 <lb/>Corresponding authors are: Dan Andrews (Dan.Andrews@oecd.org) from the OECD Economics <lb/>Department <lb/>and <lb/>Chiara <lb/>Criscuolo <lb/>(Chiara.Criscuolo@oecd.org) <lb/>and <lb/>Carlo <lb/>Menon <lb/>(Carlo.Menon@oecd.org) from the OECD Science, Technology and Industry Directorate. The authors are <lb/>indebted to Hélène Dernis for her advice with the HAN patent dataset; Peter Gal and Alexandros Ragoussis <lb/>for help with the ORBIS database; Stuart Graham and Nicolas van Zeebroeck for useful advice on the <lb/>litigation data; and to Evrard van Zuylen for answering to all our enquiries on the same data. The authors <lb/>would also like to thank Eric Bartelsman, Antoine Dechezleprêtre, Stuart Graham, Bronwyn Hall, Nick <lb/>Johnstone, Giuseppe Nicoletti, Mariagrazia Squicciarini, Jean-Luc Schneider and participants to the CAED <lb/>2013 conference in Atlanta and to the PSDM 2013 conference in Rio de Janeiro for helpful comments on <lb/>the paper and Ines Gomez Palacio for excellent editorial support. The views expressed in the paper are <lb/>those of the authors and do not reflect those of the OECD and its member countries. <lb/>2 <lb/>For example, see Restuccia and Rogerson, (2008) and Hsieh and Klenow (2009). <lb/>ECO/WKP(2014)23 <lb/>6 <lb/>associated with important economic changes within firms (Balasubramanian and Sivadasan, 2011) and <lb/>demonstrate strong patterns of reallocation towards patenting firms and away from firms that do not <lb/>innovate (Kogan et al., 2012). Despite the emergence of this literature, there is very little cross-country <lb/>evidence on patterns of reallocation towards innovative firms. Accordingly, following the approach used <lb/>by Balasubramanian and Sivadasan (2011) for the United States, this paper looks at 23 OECD countries <lb/>over the period 2002-2010 using matched PATSTAT-ORBIS data, with a view to highlight cross-country <lb/>differences in reallocation and innovation patterns. 3 To the best of the authors&apos; knowledge, this paper is the <lb/>first to explore cross-country differences in the extent to which resources flow to patenting firms. <lb/>3. <lb/>Using this approach, it is possible to replicate a key message from the US studies: namely, that <lb/>patenting is associated with real changes in economic activity at the firm level. For the average firm in the <lb/>sample, the baseline estimates imply that a 10% increase in the firm patent stock is associated with a 1% <lb/>increase in employment and a 1.3% increase in the capital stock. Moreover, instrumental variables <lb/>estimation – which exploits data on patent litigation within technological fields to instrument patenting – <lb/>suggests that the impact of patenting on firm size is likely to be causal, which is a significant contribution <lb/>to this literature given that existing studies have ignored biases arising from the endogeneity of patenting <lb/>activity. Beyond the direct positive effects of a firm&apos;s own patents, firms will also indirectly benefit from <lb/>patenting of other firms in the same conglomerate, since firm performance measures also respond to the <lb/>patents held by other affiliates within the same group, highlighting the importance of knowledge flows <lb/>within broad organisational structures. Finally, while the baseline results suggest that patenting has a small <lb/>or insignificant impact on productivity – consistent with the US literature – additional analysis suggests <lb/>that the impact of patenting on productivity is realised with a lag. This is consistent with the idea that firms <lb/>typically need to undergo organisational restructuring and attract complementary tangible resources before <lb/>they can fully realise the benefits of new ideas (David and Wright, 2003). <lb/>4. <lb/>The analysis also reveals some interesting cross-country patterns, which seem to suggest that <lb/>some countries are more successful than others at reallocating tangible resources to innovative firms. For <lb/>example, the extent to which labour flows to patenting firms in the United States is estimated to be more <lb/>than twice as large as in Italy, and these differences become four-to-five-fold when looking at capital. <lb/>These differences, in turn, motivate an analysis of the role of public policies in shaping the observed <lb/>cross-country differences in resource flows to patenting firms – another key novelty of the paper. While <lb/>further work is required to establish causality – and with the caveat related to the limitations of patenting <lb/>as a measure of innovation – the results are consistent with the idea that well-functioning product, labour <lb/>and capital markets, efficient judicial systems and bankruptcy laws that do not overly penalise failure can <lb/>raise the expected returns to investing in KBC. These benefits are partly realised through stronger <lb/>competitive pressures and more efficient reallocation, which make it easier for successful firms to <lb/>implement and commercialise new ideas and, by lowering the costs of failure, encourage firms to <lb/>experiment with uncertain growth opportunities. <lb/>5. <lb/>More specifically, the results of the econometric analysis provide support for the following policy <lb/>conclusions: <lb/>• Stringent employment protection legislation (EPL) is associated with lower resource flows to <lb/>patenting firms, reflecting the idea that stringent EPL raises the cost of reallocating resources. <lb/>The estimated effect of EPL is economically large: a policy reform that reduced the stringency of <lb/>EPL from the highest observed level (Portugal) to the average level (Norway) is estimated to<lb/></body>

			<body>ECO/WKP(2014)23 <lb/>7 <lb/>more than double the extent to which labour flows to patenting firms. Additional analysis <lb/>suggests that the burden of stringent EPL falls disproportionately on young firms, which is <lb/>consistent with existing studies showing that stringent EPL reduces the scope for experimentation <lb/>with uncertain technologies. <lb/>• Cumbersome product market regulations (PMR) are negatively associated with employment <lb/>flows to patenting firms, which may reflect the tendency for such regulations to prolong the <lb/>existence of inefficient firms in the market and to raise the cost structure of inputs that are <lb/>required by innovative firms to underpin their expansion. The estimates imply that the <lb/>responsiveness of firm employment to increases in the patent stock would more than double if the <lb/>stringency of PMR was reduced from the highest observed level (Poland) to the sample mean <lb/>value (Belgium). Similarly, more stringent barriers to trade and investment reduce the ability of <lb/>patenting firms to attract capital: all else equal, reducing barriers to trade and investment from the <lb/>most stringent setting (Slovak Republic) to sample average (Japan) is associated with a 70% <lb/>increase in the extent to which capital flows to patenting firms.<lb/>• Bankruptcy legislation that does not excessively penalise business failure can promote the flow <lb/>of resources to more innovative firms by reducing entrepreneurs&apos; expectations that they will be <lb/>heavily penalised in case of failure and thus encouraging them to experiment with risky <lb/>high-return high-failure type technologies. For instance, reducing the cost of bankruptcy <lb/>procedures from the sample maximum (Italy) to the mean value (France) would be associated <lb/>with a 30% increase in the capital flow to patenting firms.<lb/>• In countries with more efficient judicial systems, capital and labour flow more readily to <lb/>patenting firms, consistent with research showing that easier contract enforcement makes it less <lb/>costly to hire the skilled workers necessary to underpin firm growth. All else equal, a policy <lb/>reform that improved the civil justice system in the least efficient country (Czech Republic) to <lb/>the average efficiency in the sample (Switzerland) would be associated with a 50% increase in <lb/>the extent to which capital flows to patenting firms.<lb/>• Resource flows to patenting firms tend to be stronger in countries with more developed financial <lb/>markets, and this effect is particularly important for young firms. Thus, financial systems play an <lb/>important role in helping credit-constrained firms to implement and commercialise new ideas, <lb/>raising the returns to innovation. Similarly, resources flow more freely to young patenting firms <lb/>in countries with more developed markets for seed and early stage venture capital. This suggests <lb/>that seed and early stage venture capital plays an important role for ensuring the growth of young <lb/>patenting firms and the development of radical innovations. For example, all else equal, <lb/>increasing access to early stage venture capital from the lowest level (Greece) to the sample <lb/>average (Belgium) implies that capital flows to patenting firms would be around one-third higher <lb/>than otherwise.<lb/>6. <lb/>The paper proceeds as follows. The next section places our study in the context of the existing <lb/>literature and discusses the channels through which public policies may influence resource flows to <lb/>innovative firms. Section 3 describes the underlying firm level data used in the analysis and presents some <lb/>preliminary evidence on key economic differences between patenting and non-patenting firms. In <lb/>Section 4, the empirical methodology utilised to estimate resource flows to patenting firms is outlined, as <lb/>well as the approach to identify the impact of public policies on resource flows. Section 5 discusses the <lb/>empirical results and highlights: i) that patenting is likely to cause real changes in economic activity at the <lb/>firm level, both at the intensive and extensive margins; ii) some interesting cross-country differences in the <lb/>extent to which resources flow to patenting firms; iii) that public policies can shape resource flows to <lb/>innovative firms; iv) that these policy effects are stronger in sectors more exposed to the policies; and v) <lb/>ECO/WKP(2014)23 <lb/>8 <lb/>that the burden of some policies fall disproportionately on young firms, which are shown to be key agents <lb/>in the introduction of radical innovations. In Section 6, some robustness tests are performed, while <lb/>Section 7 offers some concluding thoughts. <lb/>2. <lb/>Innovation, resource reallocation and growth <lb/>7. <lb/>Cross-country differences in aggregate-level productivity outcomes are increasingly being linked <lb/>to the widespread asymmetry and heterogeneity in firm performance within sectors (Bartelsman et al., <lb/>2013; Hsieh and Klenow, 2009). The distribution of firm productivity is typically not clustered around the <lb/>mean (as would be the case with a normal distribution) but is instead characterised by many below-average <lb/>performers and a smaller number of star performers. Moreover, the degree of heterogeneity is striking: <lb/>even within narrowly defined industries in the United States, firms at the 90th percentile of the TFP <lb/>distribution are twice as productive as firms at the 10th percentile (Syverson, 2004). 4 These findings <lb/>suggest that the focus on average outcomes is misleading and thus heterogeneous firm models are <lb/>becoming the main analytical workhouse and empirical research is increasingly focusing on the star <lb/>performers which disproportionately drive productivity and job growth (Haltiwanger, 2013; Criscuolo et <lb/>al., 2014). <lb/>8. <lb/>Given the tendency for highly productive firms to coexist with low productivity firms within <lb/>narrowly-defined sectors, the recent literature has focused on resource misallocation as a potential <lb/>explanation for why some countries are more productive than others (Bartelsman et al., 2013; Hsieh and <lb/>Klenow, 2009). A key observation is that in well-functioning economies, a firm&apos;s relative position in the <lb/>productivity and size distributions is positively correlated, which means that on average relatively more <lb/>productive firms should be larger (e.g. static allocative efficiency; see Olley and Pakes, 1996). Research on <lb/>firm dynamics reveals large cross-country differences in the efficiency of resource allocation, which <lb/>suggests that some economies are more successful at channelling resources to highly productive firms than <lb/>others. For example, in the United States, manufacturing sector labour productivity is 50% higher due to <lb/>the actual allocation of employment across firms, compared to a hypothetical situation where labour is <lb/>uniformly allocated across firms, irrespective of their productivity (Bartelsman et al., 2013). While a <lb/>similar pattern holds for some countries of Northern Europe such as Sweden, it turns out that static <lb/>allocative efficiency is considerably lower in other OECD economies, particularly those of Southern <lb/>Europe (Andrews and Cingano, 2014). <lb/>9. <lb/>While there are likely to be many reasons why some countries are more successful than others at <lb/>channelling resources to the most productive firms, static allocative efficiency can only be achieved if <lb/>there is dynamic allocative efficiency that occurs when resources move towards more productive firms at <lb/>the expense of less productive firms over time (Haltiwanger, 2011). Accordingly, the following section <lb/>discusses empirical evidence on dynamic resource reallocation with a special reference to resource flows to <lb/>patenting firms – the central issue explored in this paper. <lb/>2.1 <lb/>A healthy economy reallocates resources to their most productive use <lb/>10. <lb/>The pace of reallocation of inputs and outputs is generally high in OECD countries: on average, <lb/>about 15-20% of all firms and more than 20% of jobs are created or destroyed each year. 5 This is not to say <lb/>4 <lb/>The same is true with respect to the firm size distribution, with many small firms co-existing with a smaller <lb/>number of very large firms (Bartelsman et al., 2013). <lb/>5 <lb/>Over the first-half of the 1990s, firm turnover rates (entry plus exit rates) in OECD countries were in the <lb/>range of 15 to more than 20% in the business sector (see Bartelsman, Haltiwanger and Scarpetta 2004). <lb/>Meanwhile, average annual gross job reallocation – the sum of job creation and job destruction between t– <lb/>ECO/WKP(2014)23 <lb/>9 <lb/>that resource reallocation is always desirable – shifting resources also entails costs for firms, workers and <lb/>governments – and excessive reallocation is no more desirable than the persistent trapping of resources in <lb/>inefficient activities. Nevertheless, continuous reallocation is a key feature of well-functioning market <lb/>economies and aggregate productivity will be improved if resources are reallocated away from less <lb/>productive to more productive businesses and activities over time. The key mechanisms through which this <lb/>process occurs are firm turnover (i.e. entry and exit), shifts in resources across incumbent firms and <lb/>resource reallocation within firms. <lb/>11. <lb/>Empirical evidence suggests that, over time, resources tend to be reallocated toward more <lb/>productive activities. Most existing studies tend to focus on labour. For instance, while the leading <lb/>cross-country study finds that within-firm improvements in performance account for the majority of <lb/>aggregate labour productivity growth over a five-year window, the contribution from firm entry and exit is <lb/>estimated to reach at least 20% in some OECD countries (the estimates are higher for emerging countries), <lb/>while that from reallocation of labour across existing enterprises is generally small, but positive <lb/>(Bartelsman et al., 2004; OECD, 2003). 6 Within-countries studies show the importance of reallocation <lb/>through entry, exit and market share gains by more productive firms via market selection. For example, <lb/>Disney et al., (2003) show that for the United Kingdom this reallocation accounts for more than 80% of <lb/>aggregate total factor productivity growth in the manufacturing sector, while decompositions of labour <lb/>productivity for the Canadian economy as a whole and the United States retail sector yield similar <lb/>conclusions. 7 There is also considerable heterogeneity across firms in their ability to use capital <lb/>productively and existing studies show that capital – as measured by acquisitions of property, plant and <lb/>equipment – also tends to flow from less productive firms to more productive firms (Eisfeldt and Rampini, <lb/>2006; Jovanovic and Rousseau, 2002). <lb/>12. <lb/>Recent evidence suggests that resources flow towards firms that patent at the expense of non-<lb/>patenting firms. Studies exploiting firm level longitudinal data from the United States suggest that <lb/>patenting – also a proxy for innovation – tends to be associated with important changes within firms, e.g., <lb/>increases in firm size, scope, and skill and capital intensity observed after firms patent (see <lb/>Balasubramanian and Sivadasan, 2011). With respect to the intensive margin (i.e. differences amongst <lb/>patenting firms), a 10% increase in patent stock is associated with about a 1.5% increase in value added, a <lb/>1.7% increase in capital stock, and a 1.4% increase in employment over the sample period 1975 to 1997. <lb/>The impact of patenting on total factor productivity (TFP), however, tends to be small or insignificant. This <lb/>may reflect the possibility that new ideas – as proxied by increases in the patent stock – take a longer time <lb/>to affect productivity, since firms typically need to undertake organisational restructuring (Bloom and Van <lb/>Reenen, 2010; David and Wright, 2003; Pozzi and Schivardi, 2012) and attract complementary tangible <lb/>resources in order to implement and commercialise new ideas (Andrews and Criscuolo, 2013). 8 <lb/>1 and t – was about 22% of dependent employment in the business sector between 1997 and 2004 (see <lb/>OECD, 2009a) <lb/>6 <lb/>These estimates are likely to understate the contribution of reallocation since the direct contribution of net <lb/>entry is reinforced by an indirect effect whereby incumbents raise their own productivity to maintain <lb/>market share in the face of strong entry pressures (see Aghion, et al., 2007). And, the contribution from <lb/>reallocation – particularly net entry – tends to increase when the analysis is conducted over longer time <lb/>horizons (Foster et al., 2001; Bartelsman et al., 2004). <lb/>7 <lb/>Baldwin and Gu (2006) for Canada find that this reallocation accounts for about 70% of aggregate labour <lb/>productivity growth. Foster et al. (2006) find that entry and exit explain almost all labour productivity <lb/>growth of the US retail sector. <lb/>8 <lb/>This lagged response of TFP may also reflect the fact that the patent stock is based on the year of <lb/>application as opposed to the year in which the patent is ultimately granted. <lb/>ECO/WKP(2014)23 <lb/>10 <lb/>13. <lb/>Since the model controls for industry specific year fixed effects, these elasticities provide an <lb/>estimate of the extent to which patenting is associated with higher activity at the firm level, relative to the <lb/>average firm in the sector in a particular year, and are thus informative from a reallocation perspective. <lb/>Balasubramanian and Sivadasan (2011) also explore the extensive margin by analysing how firms&apos; <lb/>economic characteristics change when they switch status from being a non-patentee to a patentee. Using an <lb/>event study and a matching estimator, they find that first-time patentees record significant growth along a <lb/>range of firm economic indicators relative to a control group of non-patenting firms that displayed similar <lb/>pre-treatment characteristics. <lb/>14. <lb/>Looking at all factors of production, Kogan et al., (2012) find strong patterns of reallocation <lb/>towards innovating firms (the extent of which is determined by the stock market response to news about <lb/>patents), and away from firms that do not innovate as proxied by patenting activity. For instance, an <lb/>increase in patenting by a firm from the 50th to the 90th percentile of the innovation distribution increases <lb/>a firm&apos;s physical capital investment rate by 0.4-0.9 percentage points, which is economically significant <lb/>given the sample median firm investment rate of 10% (see column 1 from Table below). Moreover, for <lb/>firms that do not innovate, a one standard deviation increase in the level of innovation by a firm&apos;s <lb/>competitor triggers a decline of 1.2-1.6 percentage points in that firm&apos;s investment rate. Innovation also <lb/>triggers similar patterns of reallocation for both labour and financial capital (columns 2 and 3), and similar <lb/>patterns have also been identified using data for Denmark (Lentz and Mortensen 2008). <lb/>Table 1. Innovation and reallocation in the United States <lb/>Notes: To estimate the economic magnitude of firm-level technological innovations, Kogan et al., (2012) use stock market responses <lb/>to news about patents over the period 1926-2007. Net capital inflows are calculated as: debt issuance plus equity issuance minus <lb/>payout (and are normalised by assets). <lb/>Source: Kogan et al., (2012). <lb/>15. <lb/>Before proceeding, it is important to note that while the results from both aforementioned studies <lb/>demonstrate the important relationship between patenting and firm size, the authors are careful not to <lb/>attach a causal interpretation to their findings. One specific concern is that increases in – latent or explicit – <lb/>demand for certain products might spur growth in both patenting and firm size in some firms but not <lb/>others. 9 As discussed in Section 4.1.3, there are also likely to be other sources of endogeneity and to the <lb/>best of our knowledge, few – if any – papers in the literature control for such biases. Accordingly, a key <lb/>contribution of this paper is to present instrumental variables estimates of the impact of patenting on firm <lb/>size. <lb/></body>

			<note place="footnote">9 <lb/>The demand-pull channel for innovation was first proposed by Schmookler (1966) and is part of some <lb/>models of endogenous technological change (for example, Acemoglu &amp; Linn 2004). <lb/></note>

			<body>ECO/WKP(2014)23 <lb/>11 <lb/>2.2 <lb/>The links between reallocation and innovation <lb/>16. <lb/>Despite the emergence of this US literature, cross-country evidence on the extent to which <lb/>patenting firms can attract labour and capital is scarce. More systematic cross-country evidence on <lb/>resource flows to innovative firms is clearly desirable, particularly in light of the close links between <lb/>investments in knowledge-based capital (KBC) and innovation and reallocation mechanisms (see Andrews <lb/>and Criscuolo, 2013). <lb/>17. <lb/>Recent research demonstrates the growing importance of KBC as a potential source of <lb/>productivity gains, and the contribution of efficient resource allocation to this process. Indeed, the non-<lb/>rivalrous nature of knowledge means that the initial cost incurred in developing new ideas – typically <lb/>through R&amp;D – does not get re-incurred as the latter are combined with other inputs in the production of <lb/>goods or services. This gives rise to increasing returns to scale – the important property that makes ideas <lb/>and knowledge an engine of growth (Jones, 2005). Realising this growth potential, however, depends on <lb/>the ability to reallocate labour and capital to their most productive use. <lb/>18. <lb/>Andrews and de Serres (2012) explore these ideas from the perspective of an intangible-based <lb/>start-up firm, where profitability depends not only on technological success but crucially on the ability to <lb/>leverage the fixed cost of investments in intangibles – which are subject to strong returns to scale – through <lb/>increases in the scale of production (Bartelsman and Groot, 2004). The ability to rapidly reallocate tangible <lb/>resources, such as labour and physical capital, in order to capture the value of the investment before <lb/>imitation by followers is therefore crucial for such firms. Likewise, in the event of technological failure, it <lb/>is vital that firms experimenting with innovative activities can rapidly scale down operations to facilitate <lb/>exit and thereby release resources that can be used by other firms. 10 <lb/>19. <lb/>In fact, it is increasingly being recognised that the growth potential of innovative firms is <lb/>inversely related to the amount of resources that are absorbed by other less productive firms. In a <lb/>heterogeneous firm model calibrated to US data, Acemoglu et al., (2013) show that policy intervention <lb/>such as R&amp;D tax subsidies are only truly effective when policy-makers can encourage the exit of &quot; low-<lb/>type &quot; incumbent firms, in order to free-up R&amp;D resources (i.e. skilled labour) for innovative &quot; high-type &quot; <lb/>incumbents and entrants. This reflects the idea that low-type firms – despite their lack of innovativeness – <lb/>still employ skilled labour to cover the fixed costs of operation, such as management and back-office <lb/>operations. One implication is that a R&amp;D subsidy will be fully capitalised into the high skilled wage rate – <lb/>without a concomitant rise in innovation output (as suggested by Goolsbee, 1998) – unless the effective <lb/>supply of high skilled labour can rise to meet additional demand via the downsizing and/or exit of &quot; low-<lb/>type &quot; firms. <lb/>20. <lb/>Finally, the ability to rapidly redeploy tangible resources not only influences the returns to <lb/>innovation but also the type of strategy firms employ to boost their own productivity, which will be shaped <lb/>by their perceptions of the expected costs of implementing and commercialising new ideas and the ability <lb/>to capitalise on the expected benefits. If the costs of reallocation are deemed to be too high, entrepreneurs <lb/>may have to focus on incremental innovations, rather than experiment with disruptive technologies, <lb/>because it will be more difficult to realise the benefits of risky technologies when successful and contain <lb/>losses when unsuccessful (Bartelsman, 2004). In turn, some entrepreneurs might decide not to even enter <lb/>the market as it might not be profitable or sustainable to enter with just an incremental innovation (Shane, <lb/>2001; Bhide, 2000). Hence, the extent of specialisation in sectors that rely more on reallocation – such as <lb/>10 <lb/>This process is also necessary to provide the entrepreneur with sufficient space in order to experiment with <lb/>alternative ideas. Indeed, this is consistent with anecdotal evidence that suggests that the most successful <lb/>entrepreneurs have experienced some form of business failure in the past. <lb/>ECO/WKP(2014)23 <lb/>12 <lb/>more innovative or ICT-intensive sectors – may vary across countries (Bartelsman et al., 2010), partly as a <lb/>result of the efficiency of reallocation mechanisms. In sum, efficient reallocation mechanisms are likely to <lb/>be particularly important for patenting firms to the extent that they shape the returns to innovation but also <lb/>determine the feasibility of various innovation strategies. <lb/>2.3 <lb/>Public policy and resource flows to innovative firms <lb/>21. <lb/>Emerging empirical evidence suggests that public policies can have important effects on the <lb/>efficiency of resource allocation (Arnold et al., 2011; Bartelsman et al., 2013; Andrews and Cingano, <lb/>2014; Bravo-Biosca et al., 2013). Andrews and Cingano (2014) construct estimates of static allocative <lb/>efficiency at the industry level for a large sample of OECD countries, and show that more stringent <lb/>regulations affecting product and labour markets and bankruptcy laws that excessively penalise business <lb/>failure are associated with less efficient resource allocation. Similarly, Bravo-Biosca et al., (2013) show <lb/>that these policy settings as well as less developed financial markets tend to be associated with a less <lb/>dynamic distribution of firm employment in a small sample of OECD countries, while Aghion et al., <lb/>(2007) highlight the importance of financial development for post-entry employment growth. These <lb/>papers, however, are unable to address the question of how policies shape the growth prospects of the most <lb/>innovative firms, since they aggregate firm level data to the sectoral level. <lb/>22. <lb/>With this background in mind, the strength of the link between resource flows to patenting firms <lb/>and relevant policy and institutional factors is explored, with a specific focus on: <lb/></body>

			<note place="footnote">• Product market regulations (PMR): cumbersome PMR might raise the cost structure of inputs <lb/>and/or lower the quality of inputs that are required by innovative firms to underpin their <lb/>expansion (Arnold et al., 2011). 11 More broadly, if regulations restrict the extent of competition <lb/>through higher barriers to entry, there is likely to be less pressure on incumbent firms to allocate <lb/>resources efficiently. Finally, PMR that create barriers to trade and investment may make it more <lb/>difficult for patenting firms to attract capital.<lb/>• Employment protection legislation (EPL): more stringent EPL may hinder the reallocation of <lb/>workers across firms, thus making it more difficult for patenting firms to attract resources. By <lb/>raising exit costs, strict EPL may also make firms less willing to rapidly scale-up production to <lb/>capitalise on an idea which has uncertain returns (Bartelsman et al., 2010). Given their stage of <lb/>development this implies that young firms may be particularly sensitive to stringent EPL, and this <lb/>effect will be reinforced if such regulations impose a fixed cost on firms and younger firms have <lb/>fewer resources to absorb such costs.<lb/>• Bankruptcy legislation: by increasing the costs associated with firm exit, bankruptcy laws that <lb/>overly penalise failure may make entrepreneurs less willing to rapidly scale up production and <lb/>result in valuable resources being trapped in inefficient firms, thereby making it more difficult for <lb/>innovative firms to attract resources. 12 On the other hand, tighter bankruptcy laws imply a <lb/>stronger guarantee for creditors, which may improve the supply of credit, thereby implying a <lb/>theoretically ambiguous impact of bankruptcy laws on resource flows.<lb/>11 <lb/>For example, cumbersome PMR could raise the cost of reallocating resources through land-use regulations <lb/>and overly cumbersome permitting processes, which may raise the costs of expanding production (e.g. <lb/>opening new factories etc.). <lb/>12 <lb/>This effect will be reinforced if tight bankruptcy laws hamper entrepreneurship (by posing a greater burden <lb/>on firms in the event of failure) and result in less firm entry than otherwise, therefore implying less <lb/>competitive pressure on incumbents. <lb/></note>

			<body>ECO/WKP(2014)23 <lb/>13 <lb/>• Judicial efficiency: Legal systems that clearly assign and protect property rights and robust public <lb/>institutions that provide a strong rule of law and contain corruption can support efficient resource <lb/>allocation (Haltiwanger, 2011) and raise the returns to innovation.<lb/>• Financial market development: a range of studies demonstrate the importance of financial <lb/>markets for the efficiency of reallocation and innovative firms more generally (Aghion et al., <lb/> 2005). For example, deeper financial systems can underpin the post-entry growth of successful <lb/>firms (Aghion et al., 2007) and are associated with a more dynamic distribution of firm growth <lb/>(i.e. more growing and shrinking firms and fewer static firms) in industries that are highly <lb/>dependent on external financing (Bravo-Biosca et al., 2012).<lb/>• Seed and early stage venture capital: A key barrier to the growth of many KBC-based start-up <lb/>firms is the inability to obtain external finance, due to difficulties in collateralising KBC. In some <lb/>countries, the financing gap of young entrepreneurial firms is partly bridged by highly-<lb/>specialised financial intermediaries such as venture capitalists or business angels, who address <lb/>informational asymmetries by intensively scrutinising firms before providing capital and <lb/>monitoring them afterwards (Hall and Lerner, 2009).<lb/>3. <lb/>Data <lb/>3.1 <lb/>Firm level data <lb/>23. <lb/>The empirical analysis is based on two large micro level databases. The first one is the EPO <lb/>Worldwide Patent Statistics Database (PATSTAT), containing detailed information on patent applications <lb/>for over 80 patent offices. The second one is the firm-level commercial database ORBIS, developed by <lb/>Bureau Van Dijk. This paper benefits from valuable additional elaboration on both datasets. These are the <lb/>HAN database, providing a sophisticated matching of patent applicants in PATSTAT with companies in <lb/>ORBIS based on string similarity; and the harmonised firm level dataset based on ORBIS, developed by <lb/>Gal (2013) and Gonnard and Ragoussis (2013). <lb/>24. <lb/>While patenting activity – as a proxy for innovation – carries the advantage of being relatively <lb/>easy to measure and comparable across countries, it entails only a specific component of firms&apos; innovation <lb/>activity. Firms also employ a range of different strategies to manage and protect their intellectual assets, <lb/>either as an alternative or as a complement to formal intellectual property (IP) rights. These include <lb/>secrecy, confidentiality agreements, lead-time, complexity of design, the incorporation of specialist know-<lb/>how and open source methods (OECD, 2011). However, reliable data on these alternative IP strategies and <lb/>related assets at the firm level are unavailable. At the same time, while patents sometimes are filed for or <lb/>acquired for strategic reasons that are unrelated to technological innovation, restricting the empirical <lb/>analysis to companies with 20 employees or more minimises the risk that so-called &quot; patent trolls &quot; (Bessen <lb/>et al., 2011) are included in the sample. <lb/>25. <lb/>Furthermore, there is now large and consolidated evidence supporting the role of patent statistics <lb/>as a meaningful indicator of innovative activity at the firm level (see Nagaoka et al., 2010, and Hall and <lb/>Harhoff, 2012, for recent surveys). Since Pakes and Griliches (1980), a number of papers proved the <lb/>existence of a robust correlation between R&amp;D activity and patenting (see Griliches, 1990, for a survey). <lb/>More recently, survey evidence shows that 55% of new products are patented in Japan while the <lb/>corresponding figure for the United States is 60% (Goto and Nagata, 1997). Accordingly, this paper <lb/>focuses on patents to proxy the innovative capacity of the firm, but the above caveats should be kept in <lb/>mind when interpreting the policy conclusions arising from the analysis. <lb/>ECO/WKP(2014)23 <lb/>14 <lb/>26. <lb/>Other firm-level variables come from the ORBIS database. Along with many advantages, this <lb/>commercial dataset also carries a number of caveats. First, there is evidence that ORBIS is not necessarily <lb/>representative of the underlying business population within a country, and that coverage varies over <lb/>countries and time without any clear patterns (see Bravo-Biosca et al., 2012). This in turn introduces an <lb/>important selection bias in our estimates. The required assumption for our estimates to hold is that <lb/>patenting intensity does not affect the probability of being selected into the sample, conditional on firm <lb/>fixed effects and on the wide set of sector*year*country fixed effects included in the main regressions. In <lb/>other words, this requires that companies that change their patent stock to a similar extent are equally <lb/>likely to be, or not to be, included in the sample, within the same country, sector, and year. There is not a <lb/>direct way to test this assumption, but it appears reasonably plausible, since other factors that are <lb/>controlled for in the analysis – e.g. age – are more likely to explain selection. <lb/>27. <lb/>Secondly, when looking at the matched ORBIS-PATSTAT database, the sophistication and <lb/>accuracy of the matching technique might not be sufficient to rule out the possibility of some measurement <lb/>error in the patent stock variable assigned to ORBIS firms (e.g. as the probabilistic matching may lead to <lb/>some &quot; false negative &quot; or &quot; false positive &quot; patent assignments). To the extent that these errors are <lb/>uncorrelated with firm performance, the matching errors lead to random measurement error, attenuating <lb/>estimates of the effect of patenting on firm performance toward zero. <lb/>28. <lb/>The resulting dataset is a large cross-country firm-level dataset covering 23 countries. <lb/>Information on firms&apos; accounts from ORBIS starts in 1998, but coverage increases significantly since <lb/>2003; the analysis therefore starts in that year, as pre-2002 information is likely to be affected by a stronger <lb/>selection bias (see Table B1 for country coverage). Patent information was retrieved since the year 1980, <lb/>which allows us to build the firms&apos; patent history over the longer time period. For the analysis, the sample <lb/>is restricted to companies with 20 or more employees at the start of the sample, if they are reported already, <lb/>or at the time they appear for the first time. This is preferable to using average employment over the period <lb/>as the latter criterion may lead to selection issues and amplify the impact of successful entrants. <lb/>29. <lb/>In order to avoid double counting, balance sheet information from ORBIS is restricted to <lb/>unconsolidated accounts; for a detailed description of consolidation and related issues in ORBIS see Gal <lb/>(2013) and Gonnard and Ragoussis (2013). However, it is worth noting that many patent applications are <lb/>filed at the group level and are officially assigned to the headquarter company, which implies that they <lb/>may be excluded from the analysis, given that consolidated accounts are dropped. Thus, it becomes <lb/>important to also account for patents at the level of the group. While ownership information is only <lb/>partially reported in ORBIS, many of the missing links can be logically inferred from reported links (for <lb/>example, if the ownership link of firm C with firm A is missing, this could be inferred if we know that firm <lb/>A owns firm B, and that firm B owns firm C). Appendix A describes the methodology used to develop an <lb/>ad-hoc algorithm which iteratively exploits available information to reconstruct the ownership tree of each <lb/>company. In this way, it was possible to create a group identifier linking companies belonging to the same <lb/>group and to calculate the group-level patent stock. <lb/>30. <lb/>The measure of patent stock is based on the number of (eventually granted) patent applications to <lb/>the three main patent offices: the USTPO, the EPO, and the WIPO. Robustness tests were performed such <lb/>as including patents from other important national patent offices for which reliable information is available <lb/>(i.e. the British, Canadian, German, French, and Japanese patent offices). The year of reference is the <lb/>application year. The patent stock is calculated as the cumulative sum of the depreciated yearly patent <lb/>count since 1980. The depreciation rate is the one most frequently used in the literature, equal to 15% per <lb/>year (Hall et al., 2005). Different patent applications, however, can arise from the same &quot; inventive steps &quot; , <lb/>as companies may seek protection for the same ideas in many countries by filing the same patent at several <lb/>patent offices. All patent applications referring to the same &quot; priority &quot; patent are defined as a &quot; patent <lb/>family &quot; . In order to take this issue into account, the company-level patent stock is also estimated based on <lb/>ECO/WKP(2014)23 <lb/>15 <lb/>the count of distinct patent families, rather than distinct patents; the International Patent Documentation <lb/>Centre (INPADOC) family definition has been adopted. <lb/>3.2 <lb/>Preliminary evidence <lb/>31. <lb/>This section presents some descriptive statistics drawn from our dataset. All in all, figures tend to <lb/>confirm three key stylised facts that have emerged from the literature: i) only a small percentage of firms <lb/>patent; ii) these firms are often concentrated in a few key sectors; and iii) on average, patenting firms are <lb/>very different with respect to their non-patenting counterparts, especially in terms of size, but also <lb/>productivity. It is worth stressing that these aggregate statistics are only suggestive and should be <lb/>interpreted with caution, as they might be prone to selection bias (see discussion in section 3.1 on the <lb/>limitations of ORBIS) and because the sample excludes firms with less than 20 employees. Finally, the <lb/>descriptive statistics in this section are limited to countries for which a significant number of patenting <lb/>firms over the 2003-2010 period is reported in the dataset, which corresponds to a total of around <lb/>2.8 million firms across 13 countries. <lb/>32. <lb/>The left panel of Figure 1 reports the share of firms that own at least one patent in 2009 by <lb/>country. While the share of firms that patent is close to or above 20% in United States and Germany, this <lb/>figure is around 5% for most other countries in Figure 1. The right panel reports the corresponding statistic <lb/>by (NACE Rev. 1.1) 2-digit sectors. The graph shows that there is also large heterogeneity across sectors, <lb/>with manufacturing of chemicals – including pharmaceuticals – (NACE 24), machinery and equipment <lb/>(NACE 29), and electrical and optical (NACE 30-33) showing as expected the largest patenting rates, all <lb/>reporting a share of patenting firms of around 20%. Another stylised fact is that industries in <lb/>manufacturing generally show a much higher patenting rate than in the service sector. <lb/>Figure 1. Share of firms that patent by country and by 2-digit sector <lb/>Selected OECD countries <lb/>Panel A: Country <lb/>Panel B: Industry <lb/>Note: the sample is limited to companies and that have at least 20 employees in 2003 or at the time of their first appearance in the <lb/>dataset and to countries for which at least 500 firms applied for a patent over the 2003-2010 period. <lb/>Source: PATSTAT, OECD HAN Database, and OECD ORBIS. <lb/>33. <lb/>Table 2 reports some summary statistics comparing the group of patenting firms with non-<lb/>patentees. Patentees are systematically larger than non-patentees, irrespectively of the indicator used which <lb/>is consistent with existing research from the United States (Balasubramanian and Sivadasan, 2011): on <lb/>average, comparing the simple means of the size variables (columns 1 and 4), turnover is larger by a factor <lb/>ECO/WKP(2014)23 <lb/>16 <lb/>of 4; capital stock by a factor of 5; and employment by a factor of roughly 3. 13 Not surprisingly, patenting <lb/>firms are also more capital intensive and show a higher level of labour productivity than non-patentees. 14 <lb/>Table 2. Mean firm characteristics: patentees versus non-patentees <lb/>Selected OECD countries, 2003-2010 <lb/>Notes: The sample is limited to firms that are observed at least once in the ORBIS database between 2003 and 2010 and that have at <lb/>least 20 employees in 2003 or at the time of their first appearance in the dataset. Patentees are defined as companies that have had <lb/>at least one patent granted from the USTPO, the EPO, the WIPO, or other important national patent offices for which reliable <lb/>information is available (i.e. the British, Canadian, German, French, and Japanese patent offices). *** denotes statistical significance <lb/>at the 1% level. <lb/>4. <lb/>Empirical methodology <lb/>4.1 <lb/>Patent stock and firm size <lb/>34. <lb/>To understand whether these cross-sectional differences between patenting and non-patenting <lb/>firms reflect self-selection on pre-existing differences, the longitudinal structure of the database is <lb/>exploited to explore how changes in firms&apos; patenting status over time are associated with changes in firms&apos; <lb/>characteristics. <lb/>4.1.1 <lb/>The baseline model <lb/>35. <lb/>Following Balasubramanian and Sivadasan (2011), the within-firm elasticity of firm <lb/>characteristics (e.g. employment, capital, etc.) with respect to changes – or more specifically, deviations <lb/>from firm-average – in the patent stock is estimated, based on the following fixed effects regression <lb/>specification: <lb/>isct <lb/>sct <lb/>i <lb/>isct <lb/>isct <lb/>PatS <lb/>Y <lb/>ε <lb/>µ <lb/>η <lb/>β <lb/>+ <lb/>+ <lb/>+ <lb/>= <lb/>) <lb/>ln( <lb/>ln <lb/>1 <lb/>[1] <lb/>13 <lb/>These variables are logarithms of the original values, and hence the factor, say, for employment is <lb/>computed as e1.034 = 2.8. <lb/>14 <lb/>Note that 4,524 observations with zero real capital stock are excluded from the fixed assets statistics. The <lb/>real capital stock is calculated using the perpetual inventory method. See Gal (2013) for detail. <lb/>ECO/WKP(2014)23 <lb/>17 <lb/>where Y is the economic characteristic (employment, capital, turnover) for firm i, in sector s, in country c <lb/>at time t and PatS is the depreciated patent stock. The specification also includes firm fixed effects and <lb/>industry*country*year fixed effects. As a robustness test and to explore longer run impacts, we also <lb/>estimated equation (1) in long difference form – i.e., on a cross-sectional dataset formed by the 2009-2003 <lb/>difference of all variables. <lb/>36. <lb/>Since the log-log specification would exclude all firms that have zero patents, in order to include <lb/>in the sample observations with PatS equal to zero, the standard technique of taking the logarithm of <lb/>1+PatS is applied; this implies that we cannot strictly interpret the estimated coefficients as elasticities. <lb/>Since this may introduce a non-negligible bias, additional robustness tests show that the sign and the <lb/>magnitude of the results do not change when firms with no patents are excluded (see Table B2, Panel A). <lb/>The inclusion of zeros also implies that the estimated coefficient from equation [1] is a joint estimate of the <lb/>extensive (i.e. what happens to firms when they switch from non-patentee to patentee status) and intensive <lb/>(i.e. differences amongst patenting firms) margin and thus motivates an exploration of the extensive <lb/>margin through an event study methodology, as outlined in Section 4.1.2. <lb/>37. <lb/>Two different PatS variables are included in the regression in turn – patent applications to <lb/>national offices and applications to the three most important patent offices (EPO, USTPO, and <lb/>WIPO/PCT) but the results are not particularly sensitive to this choice. The latter group of patents is <lb/>defined as &quot; regional &quot; patents. Only applications which are eventually granted are considered. The <lb/>coefficient β is the estimated sensitivity of firm characteristics (e.g. employment) to the patent stock. <lb/>Although technically β does not correspond to the elasticity due to the transformation described above, the <lb/>size of the coefficient can be approximately interpreted as such. If β&gt;0, increases in the stock of patents are <lb/>associated with increases in firm employment, relative to the country-industry-year average. While this <lb/>provides an indicator of the extent to which resources flow to more innovative firms, the estimated effect <lb/>will also reflect other factors, including the quality of the underlying idea that is patented and the <lb/>characteristics of the national patenting system. Finally, in Section 5.1.1, we introduce another measure of <lb/>patent stock based on the patent portfolio of the group the company belongs to, since firms belonging to <lb/>the same group may access the patent stock – and the knowledge base – of other affiliated firms <lb/>4.1.2 <lb/>The extensive margin <lb/>38. <lb/>As a complement to the baseline results, a propensity score matching exercise aimed at exploring <lb/>the extensive margin effect of patenting – i.e. what happens to firms when they switch from non-patentee <lb/>to patentee status – is also performed in Section 5.1.2. The analysis is limited to the 4308 firms that apply <lb/>for a patent for the first time in the middle years of the database, i.e. 2005 and 2006, in order to balance the <lb/>pre-and post-treatment observation years. <lb/>39. <lb/>Following Balasubramanian and Sivadasan (2011), every patentee is matched with the &quot; most <lb/>similar &quot; non-patentee, which results in a sample of 8616 firms (i.e. 4308 patenting firms and 4308 &quot; nearest <lb/>neighbour &quot; non-patenting firms). The &quot; nearest neighbour &quot; non-patentee is the firm with the closest &quot; patent <lb/>propensity &quot; score, that is, the probability of being a first-time patentee. 15 The propensity score is estimated <lb/>in the years the patenting firms apply for their first patent via a cross-sectional Probit regression of the <lb/>first-patent dummy on one-year lagged employment, capital, and turnover (as in equation 2a): <lb/>t <lb/>i <lb/>t <lb/>i <lb/>t <lb/>i <lb/>t <lb/>i <lb/>t <lb/>i <lb/>Turnover <lb/>Capital <lb/>Empl <lb/>patent <lb/>first <lb/></body>

			<body>[2b] <lb/>Where PatDummy is a binary variable equal to one for patenting firms, γ is a fixed effect for each matched <lb/>patentee/non patentee pair, and τ is a year fixed effect. The inclusion of the patentee/non patentee pair <lb/>fixed effect (γ) implies that the model only exploits variation between the two matched firms. Index is a set <lb/>of 9 dummy variables which are equal to one in the n th year before or after the patentee&apos;s patent is applied <lb/>for, with n=(-4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4). Note that n is equal to 0 in the year the patent is applied for. These <lb/>nine dummies take the same values for both patentees and non-patentees and control for time trends around <lb/>the year of first patenting. Finally, the first term on the right-hand side of the equation – i.e. the interaction <lb/>of the index dummies with the patentee dummy – are &quot; switched on &quot; only for patentees. Thus, β 1j – the <lb/>main coefficients of interest – allow for different trends in the outcome variables both before and after the <lb/>first patent is applied for. If, as it is the case in the estimates presented, the β 1j coefficients are significantly <lb/>different from zero only for non-negative n, i.e. only from the year of application onward, on&gt;0 this will <lb/>confirm that significant patentee/non-patentee differences emerge only after the first patent has been <lb/>applied for. <lb/>4.1.3 <lb/>Instrumental variables estimation <lb/>41. <lb/>The baseline econometric model outlined in Section 4.1.1 quantifies the within-firm sensitivity <lb/>of firm characteristics (e.g. employment, capital, etc.) with respect to changes – or more specifically, <lb/>deviations from firm-average – in the patent stock, conditional on a wide set of time variant country-<lb/>industry dummies. However, this approach does not necessarily provide a causal estimate of the effect of <lb/>patenting on firm size to the extent that the positive association might reflect the positive impact of <lb/>unobservable or omitted factors on both patenting and firm size. For example, firms that are endowed with <lb/>a more skilled workforce or have better management might patent more, and at the same time grow more <lb/>for reasons independent from their patenting activity. Moreover, a reverse causality channel can also be in <lb/>place: firms that manage to attract more resources for reasons which are unrelated to patenting might be <lb/>able to funnel some of these resources into their patenting activity. <lb/>42. <lb/>Controlling for these potential sources of endogeneity requires an instrumental variable that is <lb/>correlated with changes in firms&apos; patenting activity, but does not affect firm growth beyond its impact on <lb/>patenting. A potentially promising approach to instrument firms&apos; depreciated patent stock is to exploit <lb/>yearly data on patent litigation in different technology fields. The working hypothesis underlying this <lb/>approach is that the likelihood of patent litigation in the technological fields in which a firm specialises <lb/>may negatively influence the firm&apos;s propensity to patent, since it might proxy for the expected exposure of <lb/>a patent in that field to litigation and its associated costs. For an instrument to be valid, it has to be both <lb/>relevant and exogenous. <lb/>43. <lb/>In this case, the validity builds on the interplay between two factors: firms&apos; technological inertia <lb/>and the non-negligible time variation in litigation cases across different technologies. More specifically, <lb/>firms tend to exhibit a fair degree of inertia in their technological specialization. Even if the environment in <lb/>which they operate becomes significantly less profitable, it is generally not easy or cost-efficient to start <lb/>innovating and patenting in different technological fields. At the same time, both data (see Figure B1 in <lb/>Appendix B) and anecdotal evidence suggest that patent litigation has shown significantly different time <lb/>ECO/WKP(2014)23 <lb/>19 <lb/>patterns across technologies in the last decade, with some technological classes experiencing sudden bursts <lb/>in the number of litigation cases and others showing a more linear pattern. As a consequence of the <lb/>interaction of those two factors – the technological inertia and the significant time variation in litigation <lb/>across fields – some firms exogenously find their prospective patent portfolio potentially more exposed to <lb/>litigation risks, which in turn decreases their incentives to develop new patents. The exogeneity assumption <lb/>also requires that changes in litigation propensity do not affect changes in firm&apos;s employment and capital <lb/>through other channels conditional on country-year and industry-year dummies – an assumption that seems <lb/>plausible. <lb/>44. <lb/>Therefore, we develop a two-stage least square (2SLS) estimation strategy, where in the first <lb/>stage we regress the firm&apos;s patent stock on a firm-specific, time-variant measure of litigation propensity, <lb/>which is our instrumental variable. Operationally, the instrument for firm i at time t is defined as: <lb/>񮽙񮽙 񮽙񮽙 = ∑ ℎ * _____ 񮽙񮽙 <lb/>񮽙 <lb/>[3] <lb/>Where: <lb/>• share is the share of patents in each 4-digit IPC class k within the firm&apos;s patent portfolio applied <lb/>for before the start of the period of analysis. As most patents are allocated to more than one IPC <lb/>class, the share is calculated on patent fractional count, where each patent is weighted 1/N, where <lb/>N is the total number of IPC classes the patent is classified in. For those companies not patenting <lb/>before 2003 (around 10% of the sample), we build the IPC shares based on patents applied for in <lb/>the first year of the firm&apos;s patenting activity in which at least 3 different IPC classes appear in the <lb/>PATSTAT dataset.<lb/>• Litig_prop is the sum of all patents litigated in a given year, divided by the stock of patents <lb/>applied for in the same years. For example, if in year 2005 the data show that 20 patents have <lb/>been litigated, of which 10 have been applied for in 1995 and 10 in 2000, and the total number of <lb/>patents applied for in 1995 and 2000 is 50 and 100, respectively, the value of Litig_prop for the <lb/>year 2005 would be equal to 10/50+10/100=3/10.<lb/>45. <lb/>Litigation data are sourced from a commercial database created and maintained by Darts-IP. 16 To <lb/>the best of our knowledge, the dataset was first used and described by van Zeerbroeck and Graham (2011). <lb/>Figure B1 (see Appendix B) illustrates the time trends in litigations over the period 2003-2009 for the top <lb/>10% IPC 4-digit classes and clearly demonstrates that there is a significant variation over time in litigation <lb/>events within technological classes. <lb/>16 <lb/>The Darts-IP dataset covers judgments across different Court levels (first instance, appeal, Supreme Court), <lb/>based on manual collection in courts. As a consequence, the unit of observation is the court decision, not <lb/>the case filing; in some countries some cases may be dropped before reaching a judgement, so the number <lb/>of court decisions can be lower than the (unobserved) number of patent suit filings. According to the data <lb/>provider, the coverage is not universal: while in bigger countries like US, France and UK the coverage is <lb/>close to 100% of the decisions, in other countries it reaches the 70-80%, and increases over time. <lb/>ECO/WKP(2014)23 <lb/>20 <lb/>4.2 <lb/>Identifying the role of public policies <lb/>4.2.1 <lb/>The baseline model <lb/>46. <lb/>The role of policies in explaining the observed cross-country differences in the magnitude of <lb/>these flows is explored by introducing interaction terms between the firm-level patent stock and framework <lb/>policies (see equation 3). The quantitative indicators, sourced from the OECD and other agencies (see <lb/>Table 3 for a description), are used to proxy the stance of various framework policies. <lb/>isct <lb/>sct <lb/>i <lb/>j <lb/>ct <lb/>isct <lb/>j <lb/>j <lb/>isct <lb/>isct <lb/>P <lb/>PatS <lb/>PatS <lb/>Y <lb/>ε <lb/>µ <lb/>η <lb/>β <lb/>β <lb/>+ <lb/>+ <lb/>+ <lb/>+ <lb/>= <lb/>∑ <lb/>* <lb/>) <lb/>ln( <lb/>) <lb/>ln( <lb/>ln <lb/>2 <lb/>1 <lb/>[3] <lb/>where P refers to various framework policies (see Table 3), which are first included in the regression <lb/>separately. For ease of interpretation, each policy variable (i.e. P) is re-scaled to equal zero for the United <lb/>States (i.e. the US value has been subtracted from each observation of the policy variable) so that β 1 can be <lb/>interpreted as the US-specific estimated effect. All other terms are identical to those in the baseline <lb/>specification outlined in equation [1]. <lb/>47. <lb/>While equation [3] explores how policies shape the impact of changes in the patenting stock on <lb/>firm size for the average firm in the sample, there are reasons to suspect that the impact of policies may <lb/>vary with the characteristics of the firm. For example, regulations that impose a fixed cost on firms may <lb/>disproportionately affect young firms that typically have fewer resources to absorb such costs. Moreover, <lb/>to the extent that younger firms have a comparative advantage in radical innovations (see Henderson, <lb/>1993; Tushman and Anderson, 1986), evidence that policies have a disproportionate effect on younger <lb/>firms is likely to be of particular interest to policymakers. Thus, to explore the extent to which policies <lb/>have heterogeneous effects according to the firm&apos;s age, the following equation is estimated: <lb/>isct <lb/>sct <lb/>i <lb/>it <lb/>j <lb/>ct <lb/>isct <lb/>j <lb/>j <lb/>it <lb/>j <lb/>ct <lb/>isct <lb/>j <lb/>j <lb/>it <lb/>isct <lb/>it <lb/>isct <lb/>isct <lb/>Old <lb/>P <lb/>PatS <lb/>Yg <lb/>P <lb/>PatS <lb/>Old <lb/>PatS <lb/>Yg <lb/>PatS <lb/>Y <lb/>ε <lb/>µ <lb/>η <lb/>β <lb/>β <lb/>β <lb/>β <lb/>+ <lb/>+ <lb/>+ <lb/>+ <lb/>+ <lb/>+ <lb/>= <lb/>∑ <lb/>∑ <lb/>* <lb/>* <lb/>) <lb/>( <lb/>ln <lb/>* <lb/>* <lb/>) <lb/>( <lb/>ln <lb/>* <lb/>) <lb/>ln( <lb/>* <lb/>) <lb/>ln( <lb/>ln <lb/>4 <lb/>3 <lb/>2 <lb/>1 <lb/>[4] <lb/>where Yg it is a dummy variable equal to one if firm i is less than or equal to 5 years of age in 2006 (the <lb/>mid-point of the sample), and zero otherwise. Old it is a dummy variable equal to one if firm i is more than <lb/>5 years of age in 2006, and zero otherwise. The age of a firm is based on a firm&apos;s date of incorporation in <lb/>ORBIS. All other terms are identical to those in the baseline specification outlined in equation [3]. <lb/>4.2.2 <lb/>Differences in differences estimation <lb/>48. <lb/>To test the robustness of the baseline policy estimates, we explore whether the magnitude of the <lb/>impact of policies that shape the impact of patenting on firm size is stronger in sectors that are more likely <lb/>to be exposed to the policy at hand, due to their inherent technological characteristics. This approach, <lb/>popularised by Rajan and Zingales (1998), is based on the assumption that there exist industries that have <lb/>&apos;naturally&apos; high exposure to a given policy (i.e. the treatment group), and such industries – to the extent <lb/>that the policy is relevant to the outcome of interest – should be disproportionally more affected than other <lb/>industries (i.e. the control group). In other words, identification will be obtained comparing the differential <lb/>impact of patenting on firm characteristics (e.g. employment) between highly exposed industries and <lb/>marginally exposed industries in countries with different policy settings. While this approach does not <lb/>provide an estimate of the average effect of the policy of interest as in the baseline model (Section 4.2.1), it <lb/>nonetheless represents a useful robustness test to the core policy conclusions. <lb/>ECO/WKP(2014)23 <lb/>21 <lb/>Table 3.

The specification also controls for firm fixed effects and <lb/>sector, country and year fixed effects. The parameter of interest is δ 1 . For example, if P corresponds to <lb/>Employment Protection Legislation (EPL) and δ 1 &lt;0, then the adverse effect of stringent EPL on the <lb/>responsiveness of firm characteristics to patenting is stronger in more exposed sectors – such as those with <lb/>high job layoff rates – than less exposed sectors. <lb/>50. <lb/>Industry-level indexes of exposure are taken from the large literature exploiting a similar <lb/>framework to infer the relevance of country-level policies on a number of economic outcomes. The <lb/>exposure indexes are generally computed from US data to the extent that the United States is generally <lb/>perceived to be a low regulation (i.e. &quot; frictionless &quot; ) country. Accordingly, the United States is excluded <lb/>from the analysis. See Table 3 for details on the country-level policy variables of interest and the <lb/>corresponding industry-level exposure variables used in the difference-in-differences estimator. <lb/>4.3 <lb/>Identification concerns <lb/>51. <lb/>Before proceeding, a number of caveats should be kept in mind when interpreting the results. <lb/>First, the paper&apos;s primary aim is to highlight some potentially informative cross-country empirical <lb/>regularities using the estimation approach in Balasubramanian and Sivadasan (2011), but this approach <lb/>does not specifically address the issue of causality. While the instrumental variables estimator described in <lb/>Section 4.1.3 makes some progress on this front, the results (discussed in Section 5.1.3) only focus on the <lb/>link between patenting and firm size, and do not focus on how public policies might shape this <lb/>relationship. That said, an effort is made to reproduce the main policy conclusions using alternative <lb/>estimation frameworks – which might be less susceptible to endogeneity problems (such as differences-in-<lb/>differences estimation) – in order to improve the credibility of the policy recommendations, though further <lb/>work in this area is clearly required. <lb/>52. <lb/>Second, due to the nature of the underlying data, national borders are imposed on firms. For <lb/>example, a firm is assigned to each country in which an unconsolidated account is published, and different <lb/>accounts in different countries are treated as different firms. Although an alternative patent measure based <lb/>on patents at group level is utilised (as described above), the increasingly international dimension of many <lb/>businesses may still affect the results. For instance, countries with many multinational enterprises (MNEs) <lb/>may see most of the occupational gains from patenting to occur in production sites located abroad, and the <lb/>intensity of this effect may correlate negatively with the country&apos;s size and openness (assuming that small <lb/>open economies are more likely to offshore production). Since an exploration of the within-firm and <lb/>cross-country effect of patenting is beyond the scope of this paper, the effects studied in this paper are thus <lb/>bounded by national borders, although as discussed in Section 6, we do make an (albeit crude) attempt to <lb/>control for this issue. <lb/>53. <lb/>Third, the number of variables used to proxy a firm&apos;s inputs and output is limited, and patenting <lb/>may affect the firm&apos;s production structure along other unobserved dimensions (e.g. skill intensity, product <lb/>scope or the within-firm wage distribution). This issue is difficult to address given existing data sources <lb/>and thus the quantification of the extent to which firms adjust to the patent stock is limited to a set of <lb/>standard variables. <lb/>54. <lb/>Finally, the extent to which firms react to a change in patent stock may also depend on the quality <lb/>of the patent system and the level of enforcement of IP rights. The former source of heterogeneity should <lb/>not be a major concern, since the estimates are remarkably stable across specifications based on patents <lb/>filed at international or national patent offices, respectively. The latter source of country heterogeneity is <lb/>partly dealt with by the inclusion of measures of civil justice efficiency among the policy variables <lb/>analysed; however, some countries have specialised courts for IP disputes, whose efficiency may not be <lb/>correctly measured by the general civil justice indicators. <lb/>ECO/WKP(2014)23 <lb/>23 <lb/>5. <lb/>Empirical results <lb/>5.1 <lb/>Do resources flow to patenting firms? <lb/>5.1.1 <lb/>Baseline results <lb/>55. <lb/>The upper panel of Table 4 shows the estimated sensitivity of firm characteristics with respect to <lb/>the patent stock (based on a depreciated patent count). 17 The results show a statistically significant link <lb/>between patenting and firm size. For example, for the average firm in the sample, the estimates imply that <lb/>a 10% increase in the patent stock is associated with about a 1% increase in employment, a 1.3% increase <lb/>in the capital stock, a 0.3% increase in capital intensity, a 1.2% increase in turnover, and a 0.5% rise in <lb/>value-added. The association between patenting and productivity is small and positive, but not statistically <lb/>significant, which is broadly consistent with Balasubramanian and Sivadasan (2011). <lb/>Table 4.

Data on value added is less widely available than <lb/>turnover due to missing data on intermediate inputs; the lower coefficient for value-added compared to turnover largely reflects the <lb/>more limited sample. The TFP estimates are based on Wooldridge (2009) procedure with imputations based on industry averages for <lb/>missing data; see Gal (2013) for details. <lb/>56. <lb/>As a robustness check of the estimates, equation [1] was re-estimated solely for the United States <lb/>manufacturing sector and compared to the estimates in Balasubramanian and Sivadasan (2011). While <lb/>analysis in this paper is based on a lower quality data set and refers to a later time period than in the <lb/>17 <lb/>Given the wide set of fixed effects included and the sheer size of the dataset, regressions are incomputable <lb/>with a standard PC and traditional panel fixed-effect procedures. Therefore, estimates are obtained through <lb/>an algorithm for estimation of a linear regression model with two high dimensional fixed effects <lb/>implemented in STATA by Guimaraes and Portugal (2010). <lb/>ECO/WKP(2014)23 <lb/>24 <lb/>aforementioned study, it is reassuring that the results from this exercise were in the same ballpark to those <lb/>presented in Balasubramanian and Sivadasan (2011). 18 <lb/>57. <lb/>The lower panel of table 4 shows that the estimates are almost identical when an alternative <lb/>measure of the patent stock, based on the depreciated count of distinct patent families, is employed. A <lb/>patent family is a group of patents, granted by different patent offices, which share the same priority <lb/>application. 19 Patent families may be a better proxy for innovative ideas, as companies generally tend to <lb/>patent the same inventions to many distinct patent offices around the world. <lb/>58. <lb/>Table 5 shows the results from a long difference specification – i.e. just a cross-section of <lb/>2009-2003 differences. 20 Long differences might better pick up long-run effects to the extent that they are <lb/>less subject to measurement error than year-to-year differences or fixed effects specifications, but they may <lb/>also exacerbate selection bias since only surviving firms are included. While the coefficient estimates in <lb/>the first four columns of Table 5 for employment, capital, capital intensity and turnover are similar or <lb/>somewhat larger to the corresponding coefficients in Table 4, the coefficient on value added is two-to-three <lb/>times larger in the long difference specification relative to the baseline estimates. At the same time, the <lb/>coefficient on the patent stock in the TFP regression becomes statistically significant at conventional <lb/>levels. The estimates imply that – for the average firm in the sample – a 10% increase in the patent stock is <lb/>associated with a 2-2½% increase in TFP, depending on the specification (see Tables 5 and B3). This <lb/>effect is significant at the 5% level in the specification based on the sample for which data is available for <lb/>all firms (see Table B3). While these results should be interpreted with caution given the well-known <lb/>problems with estimating TFP at the firm-level (see Gal, 2013), they are nonetheless consistent with the <lb/>idea that the impact of new ideas on productivity may take some time to be realised, possibly reflecting the <lb/>need for organisational restructuring. <lb/>18 <lb/>These results are not presented for sake of brevity and are available from the authors on request. <lb/>19 <lb/>The classification of patent families is based on the INPADOC definition. <lb/>20 <lb/>The year 2009 (rather than the latest available year 2010) was chosen in order to maximise the number of <lb/>observations in the long differences equation. <lb/>ECO/WKP(2014)23 <lb/></body>

This is potentially important since firms belonging to the same group may access the <lb/>patent stock – and the knowledge base – of other affiliated firms. While the resulting ownership structure is <lb/>still likely to be incomplete due to the underlying data limitations, the results of this exercise show that <lb/>patents at the group level are indeed positively associated with firm performance, although the coefficients <lb/>of the firm&apos;s patent stock are not affected by the inclusion of the new variable. This result suggests that <lb/>within-group knowledge flows provide an additional source of comparative advantage for firms belonging <lb/>to a group. In fact, it is consistent with a large literature on multinational enterprises, which suggests that <lb/>blueprints and knowledge that are replicable at a low cost within the group constitute the key advantage for <lb/>these firms over and above the more intensive use of researchers and larger R&amp;D expenditure (Dunning, <lb/>1981; Markusen, 2004; Criscuolo et al., 2010). <lb/>ECO/WKP(2014)23 <lb/>26 <lb/>Table 6.

The TFP estimates are based on Wooldridge (2009) <lb/>procedure with imputations based on industry averages for missing data procedure; see Gal (2013) for details. <lb/>60. <lb/>Thus far, the results suggest that patenting is associated with real changes in economic activity at <lb/>the firm level across a sample of selected OECD countries. If the observed increases in size are indeed <lb/>linked to patenting, it is reasonable to expect a correlation between the magnitude of size increases and the <lb/>underlying quality of the patent. To test this idea, an interaction between the patent stock and citation-<lb/>based measures of the average quality of patents filed by the firm are added to equation [1]. These <lb/>measures include (see Squicciarini et al., 2010): i) &quot; Radicalness &quot; : the number of different International <lb/>Patent Classification (IPC) classes cited that are different from the one the patent belongs to (i.e. radical <lb/>patents are those who bring insights from different technologies); and ii) the number of citations to the <lb/>non-patent literature (NPL), which proxies for the closeness of patents to science. <lb/>61. <lb/>The results are outlined in Table 7 in a relatively smaller sample of countries since it was not <lb/>possible to construct patent quality measures for all countries (these estimates are based on EPO patents). <lb/>Relative to the baseline estimates that utilise a simple measure of patent counts, the results show that <lb/>increases in the radicalness-weighted patent stock is associated with larger increases in each firm <lb/>characteristic considered. These results correspond closely to the findings presented later in the paper, <lb/>which show that young firms are both more likely to file radical patents and demonstrate a higher <lb/>sensitivity of firm size to patenting than older firms (see Table 10, Panel A). At the same time, the <lb/>NPL-weighted patent stock is associated with a similar or marginally smaller impact on all size measures <lb/>except the capital to labour ratio. Overall, these results are consistent with the interpretation that size <lb/>changes accompanying patenting are related to innovation at the firm level. <lb/>ECO/WKP(2014)23 <lb/>27 <lb/>Table 7.

This model essentially estimates the extensive margin <lb/>of patenting, i.e., the change in firm performance associated with the switch from being a non-patentee to <lb/>being a patentee firm. It is important to acknowledge that the data requirements of this exercise are quite <lb/>stringent and as such, the sample size is much smaller than in the baseline analysis. 21 Partly for this reason, <lb/>the results from this exercise should be treated only as suggestive and interpreted with some caution. <lb/>63. <lb/>As explained in Section 4.1.2, the extensive margin is estimated by pairing each first time <lb/>patentee with an otherwise similar non patentee, and by comparing their performance before and after the <lb/>first patent has been filed for by the patentee. If significant differences emerge in the outcome variable <lb/>21 <lb/>The sample is limited to firms that appear at least 6 times between 2002 and 2009 and which belong to <lb/>countries with at least 100 observations. Among those, there are 784 first time patentees in the year 2005 or <lb/>2006. Each of them is matched to a similar non-patentee; the final sample therefore amounts to 1568 firms <lb/>observed over a maximum of 9 years. <lb/>ECO/WKP(2014)23 <lb/>28 <lb/>from the year in which the patent application is filed – but not in preceding years – this would suggest that <lb/>resources tend to flow to firms that patent for the first time (in addition to firms that already patent and <lb/>increase the size of their patent stock). <lb/>64. <lb/>The coefficients&apos; estimates are shown in Table B4 of Appendix B and are more intuitively <lb/>illustrated in Figure 2. The figure shows that, one year after the first patent, patentees have on average 5% <lb/>more employees and 10% more fixed capital than a non-patentee with similar inputs endowment over the <lb/>four previous years. Two years after the first patent, the difference is around 9% for employment, and 12% <lb/>for capital. These differences are statistically significant and increase over time, while in the years before <lb/>patenting, there a no significant differences in these outcome variables. Overall, these results provide <lb/>further support for the idea that the size changes accompanying patenting are related to innovation at the <lb/>firm level. <lb/>Figure 2.

The estimated coefficients are reported in Table B4. <lb/>5.1.3 <lb/>Instrumental variables estimation <lb/>65. <lb/>To check whether the link between patenting and firm size is causal, Table 8 presents the IV <lb/>estimates where the firm patent stock is instrumented by the litigation propensity indicator developed in <lb/>Section 4.1.3. The first stage regression output in Panel C shows a statistically significant relationship <lb/>between the &quot; technological field weighted &quot; exposure of firms to litigation risk and the firm patent stock, <lb/>thereby demonstrating the strength of the instrument. The IV estimates in Panel B confirm that there is a <lb/>statistically significant relationship between the patent stock and firm size. As discussed in Appendix C, <lb/>these results are robust to a falsification test (Panel D of Table 8), which suggests that the second stage <lb/>results are unlikely to be biased by a long-run firm specific trend that is correlated with both the <lb/>technological specialisation of the firm in the pre-sample period and its economic activity during the period <lb/>of analysis. While this suggests that the baseline relationship can be interpreted as causal, the magnitude of <lb/>the IV coefficients is larger than the OLS estimates shown in Panel A and the IV estimates are clearly less <lb/>precise as demonstrated by the size of the standard errors. Nevertheless, the significance of the IV <lb/>estimates is encouraging and future work will focus on further refining this approach. <lb/>ECO/WKP(2014)23 <lb/>29 <lb/>Table 8.

When identifying the impact of policies in Section 5.3, what generally <lb/>matters is how these relationships change over time at the firm level. <lb/>67. <lb/>With the above caveats in mind, Figure 3 uses these estimated coefficients for a selected set of <lb/>countries to calculate the association between a 10% change in the patent stock and the change in capital <lb/>and employment, for the average firm in our sample. While not all country-specific estimates are <lb/>statistically different from one another – that is, the standard errors are relatively wide in some cases – <lb/>some interesting cross-country differences nonetheless emerge when the focus in narrowed to the more <lb/>precisely estimated effects. For example, a 10% increase in the firm level patent stock is associated with <lb/>about a 3% rise in firm capital in Sweden and the United States; a 1½-2% increase in firm capital in the <lb/>UK, Japan and Germany; and a ½-¾ % rise in firm capital in Italy (Figure 3; Panel A). Similarly, the ease <lb/>with which patenting firms in the United States can attract labour is roughly twice as large as the average <lb/>OECD country (Figure 3; Panel B). <lb/>Figure 3. Cross-country differences in resource flows to patenting firms? <lb/>Change in firm inputs associated with a 10% change in patent stock; selected OECD countries (2003-2010) <lb/>A: Capital <lb/>B. Employment <lb/>Notes: The black dot shows the country-specific point estimate of eq. (1), while the grey bands denote the 90% confidence interval <lb/>(note that the confidence intervals vary across countries due to differences in the number of observations). The same estimates are <lb/>reported in Table B5 of Appendix B. The sample is restricted to countries in which at least 300 new patents are granted over the <lb/>sample period and/or the country-specific coefficients are statistically different from zero. <lb/>ECO/WKP(2014)23 <lb/>31 <lb/>68. <lb/>These patterns bear some resemblance to cross-country differences in post-entry employment <lb/>dynamics, which illustrate that young firms in the United States – and to a lesser extent, Sweden – exhibit <lb/> &quot; up-or-out &quot; dynamics (Haltiwanger et al., 2013; Criscuolo et al., 2014). That is, young firms either: <lb/>i) grow very rapidly; or ii) they fail and exit the market rather than remaining in business as low-<lb/>performing small firms, suggesting that market selection is very harsh and reallocation significant in such <lb/>environments. By contrast, the potential growth of firms in Southern European countries – particularly <lb/>Italy – is much lower, which tends to manifest itself in a high share of old and small firms, which tend to <lb/>be less innovative. From a policy perspective, this predominance of old and small firms raises the risk that <lb/>valuable resources (e.g. human and physical capital) are clogged up in undersized and inefficient firms, <lb/>which in turn makes it more difficult for high productivity firms to attract resources and grow (Acemoglu <lb/>et al., 2013), bearing on aggregate productivity developments.69. At the same time, a number of somewhat <lb/>surprising results emerge which may reflect the limitations of this analysis. For instance, the low sensitivity <lb/>of resources to patenting in countries such as Denmark and Finland (see Table B5) may reflect the fact that <lb/>firms in small open economies may expand abroad rather than domestically, but it is difficult to capture <lb/>this margin of adjustment with the available data. Additional analysis suggests that patenting has a larger <lb/>effect on average profitability and wages than firm size in these countries, but this cannot explain all of the <lb/>observed differences. <lb/>5.3 <lb/>Role of public policy <lb/>5.3.1 <lb/>Baseline results <lb/>70. <lb/>Table 9 summarises the estimation results of equation [3] for two dependent variables – <lb/>employment and capital – when one policy interaction is included at a time. As already mentioned, each <lb/>policy variable has been re-scaled to equal zero for the United States. Thus, the coefficient on PatS can be <lb/>interpreted as the US-specific effect, while the interaction term PatS*Policy provides an estimate of the <lb/>additional effect of an increase in the relevant policy index relative to the United States. <lb/>71. <lb/>Overall, while causality is difficult to establish, the results are consistent with the idea that well <lb/>designed framework policies can raise the expected returns to innovative activity, by making it easier for <lb/>patenting firms to attract the tangible resources required to implement and commercialise new ideas. <lb/>Focusing first on statistical significance, a number of results emerge: <lb/>• Less efficient judicial systems – as measured by a higher cost of enforcing contracts – are <lb/>associated with a lower responsiveness of firm employment and capital to patenting. This is <lb/>consistent with research showing that difficulties in enforcing contracts lower the returns to <lb/>innovation (Nunn, 2007) and make it more costly to hire the skilled workers necessary to <lb/>underpin firm growth (Bloom et. al., 2012).<lb/>• Bankruptcy regimes that more severely penalise failure – as measured by a higher cost to close a <lb/>business – are associated with a lower responsiveness of firm employment and capital to <lb/>patenting. This finding provides a dynamic perspective to existing research, which shows that <lb/>stringent bankruptcy regimes disproportionately lower static allocative efficiency in sectors with <lb/>naturally higher firm turnover rates where regulations affecting exit costs are most likely to bind <lb/>(Andrews and Cingano, 2014). More broadly, by lowering the returns to innovation, the adverse <lb/>effects of poorly designed bankruptcy regimes on the allocative efficiency could explain why less <lb/>debtor-friendly bankruptcy codes have been associated with lower intensity of patent creation, <lb/>patent citations and slower growth in countries relatively more specialised in innovative <lb/>industries (Acharya and Subramanian, 2009).<lb/>ECO/WKP(2014)23 <lb/></body>

This may reflect the tendency for such regulations to raise the cost <lb/>structure of inputs that are required by innovative firms to underpin their expansion (Bourlès et <lb/> al., 2013). Similarly, in less competitive environments, valuable resources (e.g. skilled labour) <lb/>may be more likely to be trapped in inefficient firms, making it more difficult for high potential <lb/>firms to expand.<lb/>• More stringent barriers to trade and investment are associated with a lower sensitivity of firm <lb/>capital to changes in the patent stock. This is in line with existing research that shows that across <lb/>OECD services sectors, higher restrictions on FDI are associated with lower static allocative <lb/>efficiency (Andrews and Cingano, 2014).<lb/>• More stringent employment protection legislation (EPL) is associated with a lower <lb/>responsiveness of firm employment and capital to patenting.

			<body>• The importance of finance to promoting the growth of patenting firms is affirmed by a number of <lb/>results, which is in line with a host of studies that highlight the importance of financial <lb/>development for firm growth (Aghion et al., 2007; Bravo-Biosca et al., 2013). For example:<lb/>− More developed markets for seed and early stage venture capital (VC) are positively <lb/>associated with resource flows (as measured by employment and capital) to patenting firms. <lb/>− The same is true for deeper stock markets with respect to firm employment and VC markets <lb/>at the expansion stage with respect to firm capital. 22 <lb/>72. <lb/>Table B6 explores the robustness of the baseline policy estimates in Table 9 to the inclusion of <lb/>selected multiple policy interaction terms. Given the computational burdens involved, we implement a <lb/>baseline specification that includes EPL and one product market regulation term (overall PMR for <lb/>employment and barriers to trade and investment for capital) and then an additional policy interaction at <lb/>time (these policies correspond to finance, bankruptcy and judicial inefficiency). While the baseline policy <lb/>results are qualitatively robust to the inclusion of multiple policy interaction terms, in a few instances some <lb/>coefficients become insignificant. This presumably reflects a multicollinearity issue, given the relatively <lb/>high correlation between some of the policy variables in our analysis. This is particularly the case for the <lb/>early stage finance term – strongly correlated with the two product market regulation variables (the <lb/>correlation coefficient between this variable and PMR and BTI is around 0.6) – which becomes <lb/>insignificant in the employment equation (Panel A, column 3) and in the capital equation (Panel B, <lb/>column 2). The same is true for the overall PMR interaction (Panel A, column 2), which loses statistical <lb/>significance when the stock market capitalisation interaction is included (the correlation between these two <lb/>variables is around 0.7). <lb/>73. <lb/>To provide a sense of the economic significance of these results, the policy experiments in <lb/>Figure 4 illustrates how the estimated flow of resources to patenting firms varies with different public <lb/>policy settings. Using the coefficients from Table 9, the figure shows the per cent change in employment <lb/>and capital associated with a 10% increase in the patent stock when the policy variable of interest is set <lb/>equal to the sample minimum, mean and maximum values respectively. For example, Panel A shows that <lb/>the sensitivity of firm employment to changes in the patent stock is more than three times larger when <lb/>PMR is relatively low (e.g. the United Kingdom), compared to when PMR is very stringent (e.g. in <lb/>Poland). To the extent that these relationships can be interpreted as causal, these examples of comparative <lb/>statics suggest that framework policies could significantly affect the extent to which patenting firms can <lb/>attract the tangible resources required to implement and commercialise new ideas. <lb/>22 <lb/>However, the impact of banking regulation on resource flows to patenting firms is unclear. <lb/>ECO/WKP(2014)23 <lb/>34 <lb/>Figure 4. Framework policies and resource flows to patenting firms, 2003-2010 <lb/>A: Change in firm employment associated with a 10% change in the patent stock <lb/>B: Change in firm capital associated with a 10% change in the patent stock <lb/>Note: The chart shows that the sensitivity of firm employment and capital to changes in the patent stock varies according to the policy <lb/>and institutional environment. To calculate the policy effects, coefficient estimates from Table 8 are combined with the average values <lb/>of the policy indicators for each country over the sample period. The labels &quot; Minimum &quot; ( &quot; Maximum) denotes the country with the <lb/>lowest (highest) average value for the given policy indicator over the sample period. <lb/>5.3.2 <lb/>Heterogeneous effects: policies and firm age <lb/>74. <lb/>Thus far, the estimated impact of framework policies on resource flows to patenting firms <lb/>pertains to the average firm in the sample. However, to the extent that the characteristics of firms vary <lb/>significantly, even within narrowly defined industries (Syverson 2011), policies that appear neutral in <lb/>design may have non-neutral impacts on firms because of the diversity of firms characteristics. For <lb/>example, firm age might be a particularly relevant characteristic to the extent that regulations that impose a <lb/>fixed cost on firms may disproportionately affect young firms that typically have fewer resources to absorb <lb/>such a cost. At the same time, emerging research highlights the importance of young firms for employment <lb/>creation (see Haltiwanger et al., 2013; Criscuolo et al., 2014) and facilitating the expansion of successful <lb/>innovative start-ups is particularly important for long-run growth. This is because firms that drive one <lb/>technological wave often fail to continue to do so in the subsequent one, as they tend to concentrate on <lb/>ECO/WKP(2014)23 <lb/>35 <lb/>incremental improvements (Benner and Tushman, 2002), and young firms possess a comparative <lb/>advantage in commercialising radical innovations (Henderson, 1993; Tushman and Anderson, 1986). 23 <lb/>Indeed, these ideas are borne out in Table B7, which documents a robust negative relationship between <lb/>firm age and the two indicators of the patent radicalness introduced in Table 7. The estimates in column 2 <lb/>imply that the number of citations to the non-patent literature (which proxies the closeness of patents to <lb/>science) could be expected to be about 16% higher for a relatively young firm aged 5 years compared to a <lb/>firm aged 30 years. <lb/>Table 10. The heterogeneous impact of framework policies on resource flows to patenting firms: young <lb/>versus old firms <lb/>One policy interaction included in each regression; using yearly variation <lb/>Notes: Robust standard errors clustered at country-industry level in parenthesis. The patent stock is calculated as the log(X+1) where <lb/>X is the cumulated number of granted patents since the 1980 depreciated at the rate 15% per year. Young firms are defined as firms <lb/>that are 5 years of age or less in 2006 – the midpoint of the sample. Firm and country-sector-year fixed effects are included in all <lb/>regressions. *** significant at 1%, ** significant at 5%, * significant at 10%. <lb/>75. <lb/>Accordingly, Table 10 explores the extent to which the estimated effects vary with the age of the <lb/>firm (e.g. equation 4). The top left panel shows how the relationship between patenting and firm size varies <lb/>with the age of the firm. The estimates suggest that the sensitivity of firm size with respect to changes in <lb/>the patent stock is around twice as large for young firms than for older firms, and this difference is <lb/>statistically significant at the 5% level (as illustrated by the F-test). The remaining panels of Table 10 <lb/>explore whether the impact of selected policies on the sensitivity of firm size to patenting varies according <lb/>to the age of the firm. In most cases, the impact of policies does not vary with the age of the firm (and thus <lb/>not all policy variables are reported in the Table). However, young firms appear to be particularly sensitive <lb/>to EPL, with the positive effect of a one unit reduction in the OECD EPL Index (on the impact of patenting <lb/>on capital) being about three times larger for young firms than older firms (the F-test suggests that this <lb/>23 <lb/>The same is true for implementing innovations that appear relatively incremental from a technological <lb/>point of view but require fundamental organisational restructuring (Henderson and Clark, 1990). <lb/>ECO/WKP(2014)23 <lb/>36 <lb/>difference is statistically significant for capital but not employment). 24 This may reflect the idea that young <lb/>firms are more sensitive to rigidities in the reallocation process, given that they are more likely to <lb/>experiment with uncertain technologies (see Andrews and Criscuolo, 2013). The same is true with respect <lb/>to higher stock market capitalisation and, unsurprisingly, young firms are much more sensitive to the <lb/>availability of seed and early stage financing than older firms. <lb/>5.3.3 <lb/>Heterogeneous effects: differences-in-differences estimation <lb/>76. <lb/>If framework policies influence the ease with which innovative firms can attract tangible <lb/>resources, it is reasonable to expect that the impact of policies should be more evident in sectors that, a <lb/>priori, are likely to be more exposed to a given policy, owing to their technological characteristics for <lb/>example. Accordingly, Tables 11 and B8 present the differences-in-differences coefficient estimates for the <lb/>parameter δ 1 on the triple interaction term <lb/>j <lb/>s <lb/>j <lb/>ct <lb/>isct <lb/>E <lb/>P <lb/>PatS <lb/>* <lb/>* <lb/>) <lb/>ln( <lb/>in equation [5] for the firm employment <lb/>and capital stock regressions respectively. To the extent that this specification is particularly demanding <lb/>from a computational perspective, we limit the differences-in-differences estimation to focus on the subset <lb/>of policy interaction terms that are statistically significant in Table 9. Since we are interested in testing the <lb/>robustness of our baseline policy estimates, we focus on the sign and statistical significance of the <lb/>differences-in-differences coefficient estimates, as opposed to their economic magnitude (which are more <lb/>difficult to infer given that they measure indirect effects). <lb/>77. <lb/>This exercise confirms many of the baseline findings from Table 9, and provides some useful <lb/>insights into the channels through which our baseline policy effects may operate. For example: <lb/>• In sectors that are particularly dynamic and have more intense reallocation needs (i.e. those with <lb/>more firm entry, job layoffs and firm turnover rates), patenting firms can more easily attract <lb/>resources in environments where: i) EPL is less stringent (see Columns 1-2 of Tables 11 and B8); <lb/> ii) markets for seed and early stage venture capital are more developed (see Column 3 of Tables <lb/>11 and B8); iii) bankruptcy legislation is less punishing of business failure (see Columns 4-5 of <lb/>Tables 11 and B8); iv) judicial systems are more efficient (Column 6 of Table 11); and v) product <lb/>market regulations are less cumbersome (Column 7 of Table 11).<lb/>• In sectors more dependent on external financing, resource more readily flow to patenting firms in <lb/>environments where stock market capitalisation to GDP is higher (Column 8 of Table 11) and <lb/>bankruptcy legislation is less punishing of business failure (Columns 5 of Tables 11 and B8).<lb/>• Finally, in sectors with higher trade intensity, more stringent barriers to international trade and <lb/>investment are associated with a lower sensitivity of firm capital to patenting relative to other <lb/>sectors (Column 7 of Table B8).<lb/>24 <lb/>A one unit reduction in the EPL index (on regular contracts) roughly corresponds to the difference between <lb/>Switzerland and the United States in 2008. <lb/>ECO/WKP(2014)23 <lb/>37 <lb/>Table 11.

This is done in two <lb/>different ways:<lb/>− Estimating separately the coefficient on patent stock in two subsamples: only firms with a <lb/>positive patent stock (Table B2, Panel A), and firms patenting for the first time (Table B2, <lb/>Panel B). In the first case, the (always positive) patent stock can be expressed in simple <lb/>logarithmic form (without adding one) and the coefficients are estimates of the intensive <lb/>margin effect only. In the second case, the main dependent variable is a &quot; patentee &quot; dummy <lb/>equal to one if the patent stock is positive, and zero otherwise. The sample is limited to zero-<lb/>patent firms and to &quot; switchers &quot; , i.e., firms that change their status from non-patentee to <lb/>patentee over the sample period, while always-patentees are dropped. Results are broadly <lb/>consistent across the two samples, suggesting that the effect at the intensive and extensive <lb/>margin is comparable. <lb/>− Including a zero patent dummy to the baseline regressions. This method – already used in the <lb/>patent literature (Klette, 1996) – tests whether the estimates are robust to accounting for a <lb/>25 <lb/>Some of these results are not reported for sake of brevity, but are available from the authors upon request. <lb/>ECO/WKP(2014)23 <lb/>38 <lb/>potential heterogeneous effect at the intensive and extensive margin, respectively. The <lb/>estimates coefficients are very similar to those obtained from the baseline regressions. <lb/>• Controlling for some potentially confounding country factors that might be correlated with <lb/>policies. These include: (a) interactions between the Patent Stock and real GDP (in level and per <lb/>capita terms) to control for the possibility that small countries may be more likely to choose a <lb/>certain set of policies; and (b) interactions between the patent stock and outward FDI flows to <lb/>control for the possibility that in more globally oriented economies, firms might be more likely to <lb/>expand their operations offshore following a change in the patent stock. These results are <lb/>reported in Table B9, and most policy interactions retain their statistical significance.<lb/>• Using a measure of the patent stock that is not depreciated and restricting the sample to the set of <lb/>firms for which employment, capital, turnover, and valued added are all available.<lb/>• Controlling for firm-level R&amp;D expenditures: if the within-firm variation in R&amp;D expenditures is <lb/>positively correlated with changes in other inputs (namely employment and capital), then the <lb/>estimated (positive) relationship between these variables and patenting activity could be partly <lb/>spurious given the well-documented positive correlation between R&amp;D and patenting. <lb/>Unfortunately, R&amp;D data in ORBIS are very incomplete (data are only available for about 35 000 <lb/>firm*year observations) so is not possible to control for R&amp;D in the baseline specification. <lb/>Nevertheless, estimation performed on this limited sub-sample of firms indicates that while the <lb/>impact of R&amp;D expenditures is positive and statistically significant, the coefficient on the patent <lb/>variable is unaffected by either the sample reduction or the inclusion of the additional control.<lb/>7. <lb/>Conclusions <lb/>79. <lb/>This paper exploits a novel cross-country OECD database on firm performance and patenting <lb/>activity to explore what happens when firms patent. The results suggest that changes in patenting are <lb/>associated with real changes in economic activity at the firm level and new evidence is presented to <lb/>suggest that the link between patenting and firm size is causal. <lb/>80. <lb/>In turn, the paper highlights some interesting cross-country differences in patterns of reallocation <lb/>toward patenting firms. Important differences emerge in the ease with which patenting firms can attract the <lb/>tangible resources required to underpin the implementation and commercialisation of new ideas. Although <lb/>patenting is an imperfect measure of innovation, these results points to a more general assessment of the <lb/>role of national policies and framework condition in shaping the flow of resources to the most innovative <lb/>firms. For instance, one interpretation is that the returns to innovation vary across OECD countries and the <lb/>econometric analysis indicates that cross-country differences in the functioning of product, labour and <lb/>capital markets, in the efficiency of judicial systems and in the design of bankruptcy laws can provide <lb/>some explanation of why the expected returns from patenting activities may vary. The benefits of well-<lb/>designed policies in these areas are partly realised through stronger competitive pressures and more <lb/>efficient reallocation, which make it easier for successful firms to implement and commercialise new ideas <lb/>and, by lowering the costs of failure, encourage firms to experiment with uncertain growth opportunities. <lb/>81. <lb/>To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper to explore cross-country differences in <lb/>resource flows to patenting firms and further research on this issue is required. Indeed, a number of <lb/>avenues for future research emerge. First, the data underlying the current paper is based on matching <lb/>administrative data on patents and the commercial database ORBIS. As discussed this raises issues related <lb/>to sample representativeness and coverage, and it warrants some caution when interpreting some of the <lb/>results presented, e.g. on young firms. Therefore, one avenue for further research is to use information <lb/>ECO/WKP(2014)23 <lb/>39 <lb/>from matching patent data with business register data, which cover the whole population of businesses and <lb/>survey data based on stratified random samples from National Statistical Offices. <lb/>82. <lb/>Second, the paper currently considers only two specific characteristics of firms&apos; patent portfolio: <lb/>radicalness, defined as the number of different IPC classes cited, and closeness to science. Current OECD <lb/>research (Squicciarini et al., 2013) is developing additional indicators of novelty and radicalness as well as <lb/>other features of patents, such as scope and originality. <lb/>83. <lb/>Third, the data used in this analysis only allow an investigation of the growth of firms within <lb/>national boundaries. However, firms might grow and expand abroad, especially if they operate in small <lb/>open economies and if they can replicate their ideas at a low cost. As discussed in the previous section, the <lb/>relationship between patenting and firm size does not vary consistently with the extent of outward Foreign <lb/>Direct Investment (FDI) at the aggregate level, but clearly firm-level data on FDI is required to test this <lb/>hypothesis properly. <lb/>ECO/WKP(2014)23 <lb/></body>

			<body>APPENDIX A: A SIMPLE ALGORITHM TO DEFINE GROUPS IN ORBIS <lb/>1. <lb/>This note describes the procedure implemented to refine the information available in the OECD-<lb/>ORBIS (June 2011) dataset on firms&apos; ownership structure with the aim to create a group identifier. The <lb/>identifier allows to significantly refining the information of firms&apos; patenting, for several reasons. First, it is <lb/>plausible to assume that firms belonging to a group can also access the patent stock – and the relative <lb/>knowledge base – of other affiliated firms. Second, firms belonging to a group may be different from <lb/>singleton firms in their ability to attract resources; this may be particularly relevant in the case of <lb/>multinational groups. Third, identifying group patents may also limit the bias originating from the firm-<lb/>patent matching procedure. Such a matching is based on a probabilistic similarity score and whenever a <lb/>patent is matched with similar probability to two firms some disambiguation rules need to be applied. One <lb/>of these rules says that, in the case in which the disambiguation involves a headquarters and its affiliate, <lb/>the former becomes the owner of the patent. This may introduce a relevant bias if the analysis is based on <lb/>unconsolidated accounts (as it is the case in this paper). <lb/>2. <lb/>The ORBIS June 2011 dataset contains information on ownership; however, further elaboration <lb/>on this data is needed in order to obtain a meaningful, although approximate, group identifier for most <lb/>companies. This appendix describes the procedure which was developed for this purpose. <lb/>3. <lb/>ORBIS ownership information is organised in year-specific tables containing the following <lb/>columns: the identifier of the owned firm (BVD_ID), the identifier of the shareowner firm (SH_BVD_ID), <lb/>the kind of linkage (LINK_TYPE), the share of direct ownership (DIRECT), and the share of total <lb/>ownership (TOTAL). Individual owned companies can have more than a shareholder, and owned-<lb/>shareholder pairs can appear with different linkages and ownership shares. LINK_TYPE can take the <lb/>following values: GUO (global ultimate owner), DUO (domestic ultimate owner), ISH (intermediate <lb/>shareholder), and ACT (active). <lb/>4. <lb/>A first issue to address is that not all the owned companies are matched to a GUO; around 40% <lb/>are matched to an ISH. However, some of those ISHs are listed themselves as owned companies; this <lb/>implies that their ultimate owner is also the ultimate owner of the company they own. An example may <lb/>clarify the problem: A is owned by B, and B is an ISH, not a GUO. In the ownership table there are no <lb/>other owners of A listed companies. However, a few lines below, a record shows that B is owned by C, and <lb/>C is defined as a GUO (see table A1). It logically follows that C is also the GUO of A, and that A, B, C all <lb/>belong to the same group. It would therefore be useful to create a table like Table 2. <lb/>Table A1 – Original table example <lb/>BVD_ID SH_BVD_ID LINK_TYPE <lb/>A <lb/>B <lb/>ISH <lb/>B <lb/>C <lb/>GUO <lb/>Table A2 – Final desired output <lb/>BVD_ID GUO GROUP ID <lb/>A <lb/>C <lb/>1 <lb/>B <lb/>C <lb/>1 <lb/>C <lb/>1 <lb/>ECO/WKP(2014)23 <lb/>45 <lb/>5. <lb/>In this simple case, only one step is needed to find the ultimate owner for company A. However, <lb/>it could also be possible that the steps are more than one, because the owner of the first company is itself <lb/>owned by an intermediate shareholder, and so on. Furthermore, each company can have more than one <lb/>intermediate shareholder, thus different alternative paths may lead to different ultimate GUOs. As a <lb/>consequence, if the ownership structure is not simplified at every step, the web of links may growth <lb/>exponentially and the process may become unmanageable, also considering the sheer dimension of the <lb/>dataset, which makes the whole procedure very computing intensive. <lb/>6. <lb/>Therefore, the algorithm is based on three main assumptions aimed at simplifying the ownership <lb/>structure. These assumptions are necessary to keep the process manageable but they are not neutral, and <lb/>they should be customised according to the different scopes the grouping process. They could also be <lb/>related to the size of the dataset: smaller datasets allow weaker assumptions, are the need to reduce the <lb/>number of links by simplifying the ownership structure is less stringent. <lb/>7. <lb/>In the specific case of the group identifier developed for this paper, the assumptions are the <lb/>following: direct and total ownership conveys the same message; all the ownership links below a set <lb/>threshold (25%) of ownership rate, or with missing information, are considered to be irrelevant and are <lb/>therefore dropped; in the case of multiple ownership links defined as &quot; ultimate &quot; (i.e., where the owner is <lb/>either a DUO or a GUO), only the one with the highest share (direct or total) is kept. <lb/>8. <lb/>The algorithm is composed by three steps which are sequentially performed and are iteratively <lb/>repeated until all companies have a final GUO, i.e., a non-owned owner, listed. <lb/>– <lb/>The first step simplifies the ownership links, by performing the following operations: <lb/>a. All links where direct and total ownership shares are both below 25% are dropped. <lb/>b. If there are multiple BVD_ID – SH_BVD_ID combinations and one of these is a GUO link, <lb/>only the latter is kept. <lb/>c. If there are multiple BVD_ID – SH_BVD_ID combinations and none of these is a GUO link, <lb/>the one(s) with the highest total ownership share are kept. <lb/>d. If there are multiple owners for the same BVD_ID and one of these is a GUO link, only the <lb/>latter is kept. <lb/>– <lb/>The second step stores the BVD_ID which have a listed GUO already. <lb/>– <lb/>The third step joins the list of all companies which do not have a GUO yet with itself and with <lb/>the list of all companies with a GUO which have been previously stored. The number of times <lb/>each company is listed in the new joined table is equal to the number of owners of their owners: <lb/>i.e., if company A has N owners which in turn have K owners each, it appears in N*K rows in the <lb/>dataset. This step also updates the ownership shares (direct and total) with the product of the <lb/>share of the first linkage with the share of the second linkage. <lb/>– <lb/>The procedure then restarts from step one. <lb/>ECO/WKP(2014)23 <lb/>46 <lb/>APPENDIX B: ADDITIONAL EMPIRICAL TABLES AND CHARTS <lb/>Figure B1.

			<div type="annex">APPENDIX C: FALSIFICATION TEST FOR INSTRUMENTAL VARIABLES STRATEGY <lb/>1. <lb/>One potential challenge to the validity of the IV strategy is the presence of a possible long-run, <lb/>firm-specific trend that is correlated with both the technological specialisation of the firm in the pre-sample <lb/>period (before 2003) and with its economic activity during the period of analysis (post 2003). This in turn <lb/>would imply that the technology share weights used to build the instrumental variable and the output <lb/>variable in the second-stage regression are correlated, violating the exclusion restriction. We therefore <lb/>design a falsification test which, although not conclusive, may give an indication whether this could <lb/>actually be an issue in our data. The test involves regressing the endogenous variable on a placebo <lb/>instrumental variable. The latter is calculated as the interaction of the vector of a firm&apos;s technological <lb/>shares with a randomly sorted vector of litigation propensity by technological class; i.e., while in the real <lb/>IV each share is multiplied by the litigation propensity in the same technology, in the placebo IV the <lb/>technological classes do not (necessarily) match: <lb/>_ 񮽙񮽙 = ∑ ℎ * _____ 񮽙񮽙 <lb/>񮽙 <lb/>[4] <lb/>2. <lb/>If the unobserved firm-specific trend is driving some of the correlation between the patent stock <lb/>and the IV, then the placebo IV should turn out to be significant in the first-stage regressions. However, as <lb/>reported in Panel D of Table 8, this is never the case. <lb/>ECO/WKP(2014)23 <lb/>57 <lb/>WORKING PAPERS <lb/>The full series of Economics Department Working Papers can be consulted at www.oecd.org/eco/workingpapers <lb/>1126. <lb/>Macroprudential policy tools in Norway: Strengthening financial system resilience <lb/>(June 2014) by Yosuke Jin, Patrick Lenain and Paul O&apos;Brien <lb/>1125. <lb/>Strengthening competition in Poland <lb/>(June 2014) by Balász Égert and Antoine Goujard <lb/>1124. <lb/>Making the labour market work better in Poland <lb/>(June 2014) by Hervé Boulhol <lb/>1123. <lb/>Enhancing competition and the business environment in Hungary <lb/>(June 2014) by Alvaro Pina <lb/>1122. <lb/>Tackling labour mismatches and promoting mobility in Hungary <lb/>(June 2014) by Stéphane Sorbe <lb/>1121. <lb/>Local public finances and municipal reform in Finland <lb/>(June 2014) by Christophe André and Clara Garcia <lb/>1120. <lb/>The economic consequences of ageing: the case of Finland <lb/>(June 2014) by Christine de la Maisonneuve, Christophe André, Clara Garcia <lb/>and Vincent Koen <lb/>1119. <lb/>Making the most of skills in Denmark <lb/>(June 2014) by Stéphanie Jamet and Vincent Koen <lb/>1118. <lb/>Trade specialisation and policies to foster competition and innovation in Denmark <lb/>(June 2014) by Müge Adalet McGowan <lb/>1117. <lb/>Policies for making the Chilean labour market more inclusive <lb/>(June 2014) by Aida Caldera Sanchez <lb/>1116. <lb/>Spillover effects from exiting highly expansionary monetary policies <lb/>(May 2014) by Łukasz Rawdanowicz, Romain Bouis, Jérôme Brezillon, Ane Kathrine <lb/>Christensen and Kei-Ichiro Inaba <lb/>1115. <lb/>Economic policies and microeconomic stability: A literature review and some empirics <lb/>(April 2014) by Paula Garda and Volker Ziemann <lb/>1114. <lb/>How to improve Israel&apos;s health-care system <lb/>(April 2014) by Philip Hemmings <lb/>1113. <lb/>How to improve taxes and transfers in Israel <lb/>(April 2014) by Philip Hemmings <lb/>1112. <lb/>New evidence on the determinants of industrial specialisation <lb/>(April 2014) by Asa Johansson and Eduardo Olaberria <lb/>ECO/WKP(2014)23 <lb/>58 <lb/>1111. <lb/>Economic growth from the household perspective: GDP and income distribution developments <lb/>across OECD countries <lb/>(April 2014) by Orsetta Causa, Sonia Araujo, Agnès Cavaciuti, Nicolas Ruiz and Zuzana <lb/>Smidova <lb/>1110. <lb/>Would a growth slowdown in emerging markets spill over to high-income countries?
