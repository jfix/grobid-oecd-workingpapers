			<front>BOOSTING SOCIAL ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND SOCIAL ENTERPRISE CREATION IN THE <lb/>REPUBLIC OF SERBIA <lb/>REPORT FOR REPUBLIC OF SERBIA <lb/>This report has been prepared as part of the OECD LEED Programme &quot; Boosting Social <lb/>Entrepreneurship and Social Enterprise Creation &quot; . A team comprising members of the OECD LEED <lb/>Secretariat and an external expert visited Serbia in February/March 2012 for a study visit to examine <lb/>the role, both actual and potential, of social entrepreneurship, and the support which could be given to <lb/>social enterprise to boost its potential performance. This report is based significantly on the <lb/>preliminary report prepared by the local experts, the available statistics and on material gathered from <lb/>the study visit, as well as research conducted both prior to, and after, the study visit. <lb/>A report prepared by the Local Economic and Employment Development (LEED) Programme of <lb/>the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development in collaboration with the Social <lb/>Inclusion and Poverty Reduction Unit (SIPRU), Government of Serbia <lb/>October 2012 1 <lb/>1 After the conclusion of this report Laws on Social Enterprise, and on Public Procurement were proposed and <lb/>adopted, and thus are not analysed in the report. <lb/></front>

			<body>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY <lb/>The following analysis of what is needed to support social entrepreneurship in Serbia is based on a <lb/>fact-finding mission by the OECD team at the end of February 2012. The OECD team interviewed a wide <lb/>range of actors, including senior government officials, representatives from the new and established social <lb/>economy, representatives from the business community, academia and experts and the international donor <lb/>community; the mission also extended to examine the regional context through a visit to Novi Sad. The <lb/>policy analysis also draws on considerable and diverse international experience, not as a model for <lb/>implementation, but as a basis for comparison to critically assess the current policy framework in relation <lb/>to the current specificities of the Serbian context. The policy options and recommendations are offered as <lb/>a basis for debate and discussion with key stakeholders concerned with taking forward the development of <lb/>social enterprise and social entrepreneurship in Serbia. <lb/>Serbia: Economy and Society in Transition <lb/>Serbia has emerged from a turbulent period of its history and made important progress towards <lb/>democracy and a market economy. Unfortunately the global economic crisis has brought new problems of <lb/>stagnation, with high public and private debt. Numerous political, economic, and institutional reforms have <lb/>been carried out, but further structural reforms are required, including: administrative reforms, addressing <lb/>corruption in procurement, further privatisation, measures to strengthen small and medium sized <lb/>enterprises (SMEs) and the agricultural sector; these include better access to bank finance, and improving <lb/>the functioning of micro-finance – so that jobs can be created and entrepreneurship supported. This is <lb/>important because the employment rate is low, particularly amongst young people, and there are a variety <lb/>of groups facing social exclusion (including Roma, people with disabilities, refugees and internally <lb/>displaced people), together with considerable regional disparities. At the same time, there is a substantial <lb/>informal economy. Thus, entrepreneurship and work integration need to be more fully addressed. Visits by <lb/>the International Monetary Fund, and the programme of reforms leading to EU accession, will further <lb/>increase pressure for these reforms to be implemented. <lb/>The Contribution of Social Entrepreneurship <lb/>Despite some cultural barriers in Serbia, social entrepreneurship could make an important contribution <lb/>to many of these areas, as it has in many other countries in Europe, through work integration for <lb/>employment and social inclusion, through more socially cohesive welfare services, rural development and <lb/>through its contributions to civil society by building trust and social capital. The context for social <lb/>entrepreneurship has been considerably enhanced by a wide range of institutional reforms, but despite a <lb/>range of legislative reforms in Serbia, the only legally recognised form of social enterprise is the company <lb/>for the disabled, and each of the other legal structures relevant to social entrepreneurship (non-profits, <lb/>foundations, and co-operatives), face some difficulties. So far the opportunities for social entrepreneurship <lb/>have been rather limited, with some work integration initiatives and some welfare service provision, albeit <lb/>within a framework of rather limited access to public procurement markets. This provides clear indications <lb/>of the potential of social entrepreneurship, but in order to develop a more sustainable sector more needs to <lb/>be done if that potential is to be fulfilled. The emerging networks supporting social entrepreneurship, <lb/>though weak, are energetic and capable, and with some focused government support there is some <lb/>optimism for the future. <lb/></body>

			<page>9 <lb/></page>

			<body>Government support could most effectively target the following areas: pre-conditions, infrastructure, <lb/>governance in policy, finance, skills, and access to markets. <lb/>Pre-conditions <lb/>In terms of cultural pre-conditions, one of the legacies of the Yugoslav socialist period is a public <lb/>distrust of forms of social ownership (as emphasised by participants in the study visit), which has <lb/>hampered both the acceptance of recognition of new forms of social entrepreneurship, and the capacity <lb/>building of entrepreneurial forms of non-profit structures, as well as the reform of other existing social <lb/>enterprise, in particular co-operatives. The situation is further exacerbated by a public attitude of strong <lb/>dependence on the state alongside great distrust of it. Social entrepreneurship has great potential for <lb/>addressing social problems within continuing severe budgetary constraints whilst strengthening trust in <lb/>civil society, thereby overcoming this heritage of distrust and state dependency. <lb/>The attitudes of various institutions to social entrepreneurship could be improved. In general, banks <lb/>have a conservative and risk averse approach to all forms of SMEs, including social enterprise. Despite <lb/>some good practice there is considerable scope for improving the profile of social entrepreneurship in <lb/>corporate social responsibility programmes of financial services and other multinationals operating in <lb/>Serbia. This would include orienting the National Strategy for Development and Promotion of CSR in the <lb/>Republic of Serbia 2010-2015 much more strongly to social entrepreneurship. This could include a much <lb/>firmer emphasis on all larger enterprises adopting more favourable attitudes in their subcontracting <lb/>relationships both for public procurement and in other markets. <lb/>There is also scope for greater vertical and horizontal integration of public administration policy to <lb/>ensure that public services (including business support) and procurement practices operate in a fair and <lb/>even-handed way towards social enterprise. This could be strengthened through, for example, <lb/>communication/education about policy frameworks with local officials. <lb/>There are issues about developing an entrepreneurial and self-help culture (and linked to this, there is <lb/>some evidence that the bankruptcy laws are not conducive to taking entrepreneurial risks). Despite some <lb/>highly capable people associated with the emerging sector of social entrepreneurship, its support networks <lb/>are still weak, and would benefit from strengthening relationships with other key institutions such as <lb/>universities, research institutes, and the media. Similarly, while international donors have been important <lb/>in supporting the climate for social entrepreneurship, there is still scope for focusing their activities, whilst <lb/>EU programmes become available in Serbia&apos;s progress towards accession, and specific EU like the Social <lb/>Business Initiative and the European Platform against Poverty and Social Exclusion give strong support for <lb/>social entrepreneurship. In addition, the informal economy is large, particularly in certain sectors, and this <lb/>hampers prospects for developing social entrepreneurship. It is important to develop measures to address <lb/>this, including more effective regulation and monitoring systems. <lb/>Infrastructure <lb/>Currently the only legally recognised form of social enterprise is the company for the disabled. <lb/>However, it appears that their functioning could be better incentivised and regulated, and their financing <lb/>through the Budget Fund, although regulated by government, could be made more clearer. Co-operatives <lb/>suffer considerably from their socialist era heritage, and their long overdue reform through new legislation <lb/>(including for social co-operatives) has been continually delayed. Thus, the considerable potential for <lb/>social co-operatives that has been seen in many other European countries is not institutionally supported in <lb/>Serbia, and has to rely on ad hoc adaptations of existing co-operative legislation. NGOs/associations are <lb/>the other most prominent legal forms for social entrepreneurship in Europe, and are limited in their <lb/>potential in Serbia, due to the need to clarify the condition of &quot; relatedness &quot; (to purpose), and eliminate the <lb/></body>

			<page>10 <lb/></page>

			<body>restrictive conditions placed on allowable economic activity, in that it should be of &quot; small-scale &quot; . In these <lb/>circumstances foundations also appear to have some possibilities as a legal structure for social <lb/>entrepreneurship, but clarification is also required about how to specify &quot; related economic activity &quot; to <lb/>comply with the law, and the &quot; extent of economic activity &quot; allowable, given that it may only be a non-core <lb/>activity (Group 484, 2011). Thus, both of these structures may allow further development of social <lb/>entrepreneurship, provided guidance can be formulated on the implementation of policy. The limited <lb/>company legal structure is open to exploitation by opportunists, but model bye-laws 1 and a strictly <lb/>regulated social enterprise marque could allow some fruitful development of social entrepreneurship. <lb/>Social entrepreneurship typically links with policy via a variety of government bodies and ministries: <lb/>including the Ministry of Finance and Economy, which is responsible for entrepreneurship in general. The <lb/>Ministry of Labour, Employment and Social Policy is responsible for companies for the disabled, and for <lb/>the administration of the Budget Fund. These, and the National Employment Service and the Public Works <lb/>Programme 2 , are important for work integration. Also, this Ministry provides support for NGOs from the <lb/>administration of the Lottery Fund; Local Governments (with administrative support from the Centres for <lb/>Social Work) establish the framework for social entrepreneurship in community-based welfare services, <lb/>including procurement markets for new services. The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Water <lb/>Management, together with the Ministry of Finance and Economy is responsible for co-operative where <lb/>there is potential for combating rural deprivation through rural development, and agro-tourism, etc. Thus <lb/>for the reasons outlined above, it is important to have an inter-ministerial coordinative function for social <lb/>entrepreneurship – at this stage such a new function could be located in bodies such as the Social Inclusion <lb/>and Poverty Reduction Unit (SIPRU) and the Office for Co-operation with Civil Society (OCCS). There <lb/>are also various systems of business support for social entrepreneurship, including training programmes <lb/>and access to start-up loans and subsidies. However, it is not clear to social entrepreneurs as to whether <lb/>social enterprise have full access to the same system of support for SMEs (which in any case is not well <lb/>developed support), or whether there is sufficient start-up and capacity building support for the social <lb/>enterprise across the whole country. Frequently the tender system for different policy measures, while <lb/>important, needs to be complemented with more substantial support and capacity building if sustainability <lb/>is to be achieved. <lb/>International donors such as United National Development Programme, USAID, the International <lb/>Labour Organisation, the International Organisation for Migration, and the British Council, as well as <lb/>various national governments, and the EU, have all made important contributions to the emerging field of <lb/>social entrepreneurship. The UN Global Compact has helped focus corporate social responsibility activity, <lb/>where some of the banks have been prominent, but there is clearly potential for more support, whilst access <lb/>to new sources of EU funding emerges and develops. <lb/>The sector has a voice through a dynamic, albeit weak, Coalition for the Development of Social <lb/>Entrepreneurship, and also through a similar body: the Social Economy Network Serbia (SENS). Whilst <lb/>the organisations representing the traditional social economy remain rather separate, they also have the <lb/>potential to support the social enterprise sector alongside government actors. Thus, there is scope for <lb/>improving structures of governance to strengthen the emerging sector and link with and capacity build the <lb/>established social economy. <lb/>Governance in Policy <lb/>For social entrepreneurship policy to have a good fit with the needs of the emerging sector, there <lb/>needs to be a meaningful system of consultation and policy co-development, which is a system of policy <lb/>co-governance. The preconditions for this are vertically and horizontally integrated policy systems which <lb/>are transparent and effectively administered. As recognised in the Needs Assessment Document to support <lb/>the sustainable socio-economic development and European integration of the Republic of Serbia through <lb/></body>

			<page>11 <lb/></page>

			<body>international development assistance (Government of Republic of Serbia, 2011a) strategy for EU <lb/>accession, Serbia still has some progress to make in order to achieve this. SIPRU and OCCS are important <lb/>institutional innovations to help improve vertical and horizontal policy integration and these need to be <lb/>combined with improving the governance of the emerging sector and its links with the established social <lb/>economy. <lb/>Finance <lb/>Social entrepreneurship attempts to generate a spirit of self-help amongst disadvantaged individuals <lb/>and communities. By definition these are not well resourced communities, thus developing a portfolio of <lb/>appropriate resources is essential. In general the banking system for SMEs (including social enterprise) is <lb/>conservative and risk averse. In addition, micro-finance, which is so important for assisting the <lb/>disadvantaged, is severely constrained and over-regulated by international standards, due to its over-<lb/>dependence on the banks. Similarly credit unions, member-based financial co-operatives, are not allowed <lb/>in Serbia. On the other hand the Budget Fund, Public Works, and the Lottery Fund are all important in <lb/>providing complementary sources of funding to that of the banks; and there may be scope for improving <lb/>the access, orientation, and extent of these resources. The Development Fund is also relevant. EU <lb/>accession will also bring with it various EU programmes that will, to some extent, compensate for the <lb/>decline in support from international donors. But there is no substitute for a comprehensive framework <lb/>that supports the financial needs of social entrepreneurs during start-up, development and growth of their <lb/>social enterprises. <lb/>Skills <lb/>The following range of skills is required for the development of social entrepreneurship: <lb/> Skills for social inclusion (and other sector related skills – for example in community <lb/>development, and welfare services). This includes life skills, social skills, and work skills to <lb/>support entry into the labour market. This relies on some sources of funding and the work <lb/>programmes identified above, however skills development is generally under-emphasised in <lb/>Serbian labour market programmes. <lb/> Skills for entrepreneurship and management (marketing and finance, business planning and <lb/>development and also skills for growth and scaling). This is a key area for social entrepreneurs, <lb/>since business skills are crucial for sustainability, particularly for marketing and financial control. <lb/>In Serbia training provision in this area exists but not to a high level. Instead social entrepreneurs <lb/>rely on: accessing the support for SMEs and the self-employed; the support of international donor <lb/>organisations; and, the growing use of EU programmes. Although there has been some progress <lb/>in supporting entrepreneurship training, social entrepreneurship training could be more strongly <lb/>supported through the education and training system. <lb/> Skills for meeting regulatory and reporting requirements and negotiating with bureaucracies. <lb/>These higher-level skills are not generally seen as a high priority in Serbia until more state <lb/>contracting takes place and the micro-credit regime is liberalised. Such skills provision could <lb/>come from international donor organisations, although their supply of resources is declining. <lb/> Skills for the development of social enterprise (development workers): this aspect of skills <lb/>development is essential to achieve a sustainable and growing sector; it currently takes place <lb/>through informal learning in the networks of groups supporting social entrepreneurship; greater <lb/>emphasis on developing these skills will be required as the sector develops and moves towards <lb/>growth and sustainability. <lb/></body>

			<body>Access to Markets <lb/>Public procurement markets are potentially one of the most important for supporting the development <lb/>of social enterprise. However, this is unlikely to take place until the distinctive contribution of social <lb/>enterprise is more fully recognised, and social enterprise themselves have become more established and <lb/>sustainable. There are various ways in which this &quot; chicken and egg &quot; situation could develop. As noted <lb/>earlier, certain preconditions about establishing a better enabling framework for procurement via social <lb/>enterprise needs to be developed at municipal and other levels. The tendering system for projects offers <lb/>short-term service providing opportunities, but the challenge is to find better access to regular markets for <lb/>public service provision. There are some encouraging developments, for example Meals on Wheels in <lb/>Belgrade and the waste recycling initiatives. But an exploratory niche strategy for public service provision <lb/>of social enterprise could be the most fruitful future strategy (with regard to public procurement). In <lb/>addition, accessing diaspora funds as private sources of finance for welfare services may be an important <lb/>complementary source of funding. Similarly the markets for donations and legacies are relatively <lb/>undeveloped, but could have substantial potential. Corporate social responsibility markets could also be <lb/>addressed more professionally. <lb/>The development of social entrepreneurship in other markets may be more straightforward – <lb/>particularly for ethical goods and services and for environmental services – areas where the distinctive <lb/>values and structures of social enterprise provide clear advantages. <lb/>Policy Recommendations <lb/>The approach adopted here is a cautious one with the aim of establishing the emerging sector on a <lb/>sound foundation and gradually building its reputation as a distinctive social but entrepreneurial <lb/>innovation. Thus, many of the recommendations should be seen in the perspective of gradually building an <lb/>appropriate framework, alongside an emerging movement, with the development of new social enterprise <lb/>law being seen as a medium term objective. <lb/>The section on legislation explores the options in more depth, but to summarise: foundations seem to <lb/>have some potential, albeit with clarificatory guidance required on permissible &quot; related economic activity &quot; . <lb/>Such guidance has been used in countries, including Turkey and the United Kingdom (UK). In Turkey, <lb/>TUSEV, an advocacy organisation, following consulting with the relevant departments of the Ministry of <lb/>Finance and Ministry of Development reached the conclusion that best way to create a better legal <lb/>environment for social enterprises was not by new laws, but by regulating the existing framework through <lb/>circulars and communications made by Ministries. Whilst in the UK, the Charity Commission provides a <lb/>range of online guidance documents – which clarify the guidelines operated by officials as well as <lb/>providing valuable guidance on sometimes difficult legislative conditions for social entrepreneurs <lb/>(http://www.charity-commission.gov.uk/Charity_requirements_guidance/Charity_essentials/default.aspx). <lb/>A socially entrepreneurial culture could be developed by encouraging small-scale entrepreneurship by <lb/>associations, and co-operatives are also clearly relevant, particularly if they could be supported and linked <lb/>in a new distinctive network, with a well regulated social enterprise marquee. There may be scope for <lb/>using social enterprise model constitutions with the limited company form, though there are risks in the <lb/>medium term due to exploitation by opportunists. <lb/>The policy analysis and recommendations draw on considerable and diverse international experience, <lb/>not as a model for implementation, but as a basis for comparison to critically assess the current policy <lb/>framework in relation to the current specificities of the Serbian context. The policy options and <lb/>recommendations are offered as a basis for debate and discussion with key stakeholders concerned to take <lb/>forward the development of social enterprise and social entrepreneurship in Serbia. <lb/></body>

			<body>There are some underlying principles regarding developing appropriate frameworks for social <lb/>entrepreneurship. Firstly, that it is important to develop a level playing field with regard to other types of <lb/>organisations in the market, particularly SMEs. Secondly, that legal frameworks should be well adapted to <lb/>the distinctive needs of social enterprise, combining social and economic objectives, and it is important to <lb/>recognise that in many countries legislation has followed innovation over a number of years by social <lb/>entrepreneurs who have adapted existing legislation to their requirements. Thirdly, there should be a well <lb/>supported institutional and policy framework that matches well with the relevant types of legal forms of <lb/>social enterprise. Finally, in developing such policy frameworks, it is important that the public/social <lb/>benefit dimension of social enterprise is not only properly recognised, but also financially supported – as it <lb/>would be in the context of state funded benefits. <lb/>The policy recommendations follow the same thematic as above: Preconditions, Infrastructure, <lb/>Governance, Finance, Skills, and Access to Markets. Taken together these comprise a strategy for social <lb/>entrepreneurship, which requires a new coordinative function to be established to negotiate with relevant <lb/>government and sector bodies and ensure the strategy is supported and implemented; such a function <lb/>would need to operate at the inter-ministerial level and could be located in existing bodies such as SIPRU <lb/>or OCCS. <lb/>Recommendations to Improve Preconditions <lb/>Develop a public relations strategy for social entrepreneurship, which could include: <lb/> promoting models of good practices; <lb/> attracting public figures and celebrities to social entrepreneurship, including via corporate social <lb/>responsibility; <lb/> competitions for best social enterprise and best social entrepreneurs of the year; <lb/> the use of online media (Group 484&apos;s electronic &quot; Newsletter on Social Entrepreneurship &quot; : <lb/>http://www.grupa484.org.rs/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=406&amp;lang=english) <lb/>is one such example; <lb/> strengthening research/policy/media networking so that sympathetic journalists are properly <lb/>briefed; <lb/> raising the profile of social entrepreneurship in corporate social responsibility programmes; and, <lb/> a few sector strategies be developed as exemplars of effective social enterprise approaches to the <lb/>informal economy, for example, in recycling, homecare, childcare, local food markets. <lb/>Recommendations to Improve Infrastructure <lb/>Legal Frameworks <lb/> Foundations: <lb/> examine the potential of the foundation as a model for social entrepreneurship, especially the <lb/>issue around relatedness to mission – registered activity; <lb/></body>

			<page>14 <lb/></page>

			<body> clarify how to specify related economic activity in order to comply with the law, and the <lb/>extent of economic activity, given it may only be a non-core activity; <lb/> explore the extent to which Guidance Notes by registrars could be produced for public <lb/>official and social entrepreneurs; and, <lb/> allow flexibility in the choice of economic activities and potentially link the issue of mission <lb/>versus non-mission relatedness to different fiscal regimes. <lb/> NGOs/associations: <lb/> clarify the permissible limit of &quot; small-scale &quot; economic activity, such as through guidance <lb/>notes, to facilitate flexible and larger scale entrepreneurial activity; and, <lb/> encourage them to engage in entrepreneurial activity up to this limit; <lb/> consider inclusion of asset locks 3 for both NGOs/associations and foundations; <lb/> using company law develop model constitutions and bye-laws, but limit their access to public <lb/>funds; <lb/> develop a sector body to introduce and oversee a social enterprise marque renewable annually, <lb/>with quality checks (partly to guard against opportunism by limited companies); this might best <lb/>be undertaken by an independent member-based trade association. <lb/> Co-operatives: <lb/> press for resolution to the social/public property issue and the adoption of new draft <lb/>legislation on co-operatives and the inclusion of articles or separate law for social co-<lb/>operatives; <lb/> consideration could be given to ensuring these articles/laws are relevant to both work <lb/>integration and welfare service operatives, and that they function as non-profit organisations <lb/>and that they allow multi-stakeholder structures; <lb/> press for a change in the law allowing a reduction in the numbers required to form a co-<lb/>operative (to the same number as for associations (3) – to equalise the incentives for <lb/>formation in two comparable member-based organisations; and in line with recent legislative <lb/>trends: Italian social co-ops/enterprise, Finnish co-ops/social enterprise, Belgium co-<lb/>ops/social enterprise, Spain, France; but not Poland/Portugal (5 minimum); and <lb/> press for a change in the law to allow secondary co-operatives to be formed; <lb/> support the development of a network assisting new socially entrepreneurial co-operative <lb/>could also be provided. <lb/> as a medium-term goal, develop legislation for social enterprise (which develops a broad <lb/>inclusive definition of the field); and, <lb/> examine increased incentivised fiscal measures linked to each legal structure as a way of <lb/>improving the chances of sustainability. <lb/></body>

			<page>15 <lb/></page>

			<body>Recommendations to Improve Institutional Capabilities (Governmental, Donor Community) <lb/>Gradually reshape each of the relevant government programmes, by: <lb/> taking forward the proposals in this document with relevant local/national government and sector <lb/>stakeholders to establish a strategy for social entrepreneurship; <lb/> establishing a new social entrepreneurship coordinative function to negotiate with relevant <lb/>responsible bodies and ensure the strategy is supported and implemented; such a function would <lb/>need to operate at the inter-ministerial level and could be located in existing bodies such as <lb/>SIPRU or OCCS; <lb/> developing a work integration social enterprise strategy (with appropriate models and <lb/>mechanisms, and a protected budget) linked both to the National Employment Service, and to the <lb/>Public Works Programme, and other relevant programmes; <lb/> capacity building of NGOs for social enterprise activity financed by the Lottery Fund; <lb/> developing a social enterprise strategy for welfare service provision with Local Governments, <lb/>alongside developing a social clause niche/quota social enterprise in procurement contracts; <lb/> developing a coherent framework and strategy for integrating the diversity of support measures <lb/>and potential support; and, <lb/> co-ordinating donor communities (international and private sector) in a strategy to support social <lb/>entrepreneurship, and capacity building of NGOs towards social enterprise, through co-ordinated <lb/>action of relevant Sector Working Groups. <lb/>Recommendations to Improve the Institutionalisation of the New Social Enterprise Sector <lb/> for the emerging networks of social entrepreneurship, help develop governance structures that <lb/>give a prominent place to new social enterprise; and, <lb/> strengthen the relationship between the new and the established social enterprise sectors, for <lb/>example through a chamber of commerce type model. <lb/>Recommendations to Improve the Development of the Institutions of the Established Social Enterprise <lb/>Sector <lb/> develop the capacity of NGOs, particularly of medium and large NGOs, to generate income <lb/>streams and engage in welfare service provision and procurement contracts (such as the UK <lb/>Futurebuilders programme mentioned below); <lb/> explore the extent to which foundations could be a useful interim structure for social enterprise, <lb/>and, support medium and large foundations to develop brands and donation potential – possibly <lb/>through partnership with international charitable organisations; <lb/> build the entrepreneurial capacity of new co-operatives, such as through development bodies; and <lb/>federal structures (also to promote good practices in governance, etc.); and, <lb/></body>

			<page>16 <lb/></page>

			<body> with regard to companies for the disabled, address the issue of delayed payments and, at the same <lb/>time, undertake a review of their performance with regard to the effective integration of disabled <lb/>people into work. <lb/>Recommendations to Improve Business Support Infrastructure <lb/> ensure that social enterprises have full access to SME programmes of support at national and <lb/>local levels; <lb/> develop the capacity for &quot; braided &quot; 4 support of social enterprise, for example by developing a <lb/>network of social enterprise trainers; and, <lb/> make full use of available EU funding streams to establish projects for the development of social <lb/>enterprise (including training/education at various levels). <lb/>Recommendations to Improve Governance <lb/> develop good practice partnership projects between municipalities and social enterprise, such as <lb/>with EU funding for developing good practice in the use of social clauses for social <lb/>entrepreneurship in welfare provision; <lb/> consider support for the development of a social economy coalition that brings together NGOs, <lb/>foundations and co-operatives, initially at the municipal level through the development of <lb/>horizontal networks across these pillars of the social economy with EU programme funding; and, <lb/> improve vertical and horizontal policy integration for social entrepreneurship through briefing <lb/>documents and administrative guidelines; <lb/> capacity building, communication, education and training of relevant administrative officials <lb/>about relevant policy frameworks; and, <lb/> gradually develop a system of co-governance with municipal and regional bodies together with <lb/>social economy organisations. <lb/>Recommendations to Improve Finance <lb/>Design a comprehensive framework of financial institutions and instruments to support the different <lb/>phases of social enterprise development, including: <lb/> link activities/support from Budget and Lottery Funds enabling access for NGOs, social <lb/>enterprises and companies for the disabled; <lb/> measures to address the conservative attitude of banks, possibly through government-sponsored <lb/>loan guarantee systems; <lb/> promote legislation to establish a comprehensive framework for micro-finance, so that it does not <lb/>need to be channelled through the banks and is appropriately regulated in line with international <lb/>experience; <lb/> develop a comprehensive framework to support the financial needs of social entrepreneurs during <lb/>start-up, development and growth of social enterprise; <lb/></body>

			<page>17 <lb/></page>

			<body> design a system of grants for feasibility studies and the development of business plans, low cost <lb/>rents in incubators for the first 18 months of business development, loan guarantee systems, and <lb/>specialist financial institutions to act in a venture capitalist type role supporting growth of the <lb/>social enterprise; <lb/> consider programmes to support social entrepreneurs, such as funding through a foundation; <lb/>(with a possible endowment through international donor/CSR partnership); <lb/> consider the development of community development finance initiatives (supported through <lb/>fiscal measures); and, <lb/> examine asset transfer policies by municipalities and other public bodies to provide buildings for <lb/>low rent incubators. <lb/>Recommendations to Improve Skills <lb/> ensure that social entrepreneurs have full access to SME training and mentoring programmes; <lb/> ensure that SME related legislation and policy is inclusive of social enterprise; <lb/> explore the development of specialist training programmes specifically for social enterprise <lb/>needs; <lb/> examine the policy of picking winners, that is of identifying high growth social enterprise <lb/> &quot; gazelles &quot; ; <lb/> develop capacity building agreements between public bodies and social enterprise for medium <lb/>sized social enterprise; <lb/> examine the potential to develop scaling models such as social franchising; <lb/> explore project funding for skills aimed at meeting regulatory, reporting requirements, advocacy, <lb/>and negotiating with bureaucracy – such as through available EU programmes; and, <lb/> explore project funding for skills aimed at social enterprise development workers, for example <lb/>through available EU funding. <lb/>Recommendations to Improve Access to Markets <lb/> examining the potential of using the 2008 Law on Public Procurement (the new draft law <lb/>discussed in 2012 could enhance this possibility) as a framework for designing social clauses in <lb/>public procurement markets, by initiating some pilot projects in key areas such as homecare or <lb/>eldercare (for example, meals on wheels) <lb/> build partnerships with international organisations operating in ethical markets; <lb/> build capacity of large NGOs for acquisition of donations and legacies; <lb/> consider increasing tax breaks for donations; <lb/> consider give-as-you-earn charitable donation systems through payroll deductions; and, <lb/></body>

			<body>INTRODUCTION <lb/>This report initially provides a summary of the context for social entrepreneurship in Serbia, before <lb/>examining the institutional framework and policies for social entrepreneurship. It is structured thematically <lb/>drawing on extensive experience of the OECD LEED Programme which has identified six key themes: <lb/>preconditions, infrastructure including legal frameworks, governance policy, finance, skills, and access to <lb/>markets. A SWOT analysis completes this section of the report. There follow policy recommendations and <lb/>an action plan to provide a staged approach of recommended actions concerned with promoting and <lb/>developing an appropriate framework for social entrepreneurship in Serbia. <lb/>The focus of the study is on policy and institutional frameworks for supporting the development of <lb/>social entrepreneurship and social enterprise. Social entrepreneurship refers to the creation of social <lb/>enterprise, which is both the more socially oriented and the more entrepreneurial part of the social <lb/>economy – that sector of society operating between the private market led business operating in the market <lb/>and the state – comprising co-operatives, mutuals and associations (not-for-profit or voluntary <lb/>organisations) and foundations. <lb/>A significant feature of this study is that it draws extensively on a wide range of international <lb/>experiences as a comparator for critical analysis of the current policy framework and experiences. <lb/>However, this international experience should in no way be considered as providing models for <lb/>implementation, rather they are an inspiration for policy solutions that are uniquely adapted to the Serbian <lb/>context, and which are developed through appropriate consultation processes with a diverse range of <lb/>stakeholders. <lb/>The key challenges addressed in this study relate to the how social entrepreneurship can help address <lb/>some of the issues it faces as it comes out of a turbulent period of its history, and moves forward with <lb/>democratic and market reforms towards EU membership. <lb/>The recent of history in Serbia has been rather difficult – the break-up of the former Yugoslavia, and <lb/>ensuing conflicts, UN sanctions, and the end of the Milosevic regime in October 2000, followed by the <lb/>lifting of EU/US economic sanctions; and then further political adjustment as Montenegro became <lb/>independent in 2006. The war and international isolation led to an extended current economic crisis (with <lb/>hyperinflation during the 1990s) all of which posed considerable challenges to Serbian government policy, <lb/>but the country enjoyed a period of high growth during the first few years after sanctions ended (with GDP <lb/>growth averaging just over 6% p.a. from 2000-2008). However, the world economic crisis has had a major <lb/>impact, with a gradual process of recovery underway as the country, and its people, move towards full <lb/>membership of the European Union. <lb/>The report firstly analyses the current context in Serbia relevant to major issues of social inclusion, <lb/>employment, and the development of civil society; secondly, it highlights the distinctive contribution that <lb/>may be made by social entrepreneurship and social enterprise alongside classic measures for reinvigorating <lb/>the market and reconstructing the role of the state; and, thirdly it reviews the policy framework in order to <lb/>specify ways in which this could be made more conducive to vigorous development of social <lb/>entrepreneurship. International experience confirms that appropriate policies to stimulate the social <lb/>economy, can play an important role not only in providing a diverse ecosystem of organisations and actors, <lb/>but also in improving the performance of the other main pillars of policy: the state and the market. <lb/></body>

			<body>CHAPTER 1: CONTEXT <lb/>This Chapter briefly reviews historical and current perspectives on the socio-economic situation in <lb/>Serbia, the current landscape of social entrepreneurship, and its benefits, so that the thematic analysis of <lb/>the main part of the report can be contextualised. <lb/>Historical and Current Perspective <lb/>In the recent transitional phase of development during the last decade, Serbia has made important <lb/>steps towards democracy and the market economy, in terms of economic political and institutional reforms. <lb/>Prior to the recent economic crisis growth was good, but GDP declined by just under five per cent in the <lb/>two years after the 2008 crisis. Government expenditure is high and debt (both public and private) is a <lb/>concern, although Serbia&apos;s credit rating improved during this period. These factors conspired to bring about <lb/>a visit from the International Monetary Fund in early February 2012. With growth in 2012 anticipated to be <lb/>only half a percent, and with rising unemployment (22.4% in October, 2012, LFS), there is concern about <lb/>the fiscal deficit being higher than the target of a 2012 budget; particularly when public debt is projected to <lb/>be above 45% of GDP by the end of 2012. A return visit by the IMF is scheduled to discuss a <lb/>supplementary budget for fiscal consolidation and growth enhancing structural reforms (Economist <lb/>Intelligence Unit, 2012). <lb/>Government is structured as follows: National, Provincial, County, and Municipal or local self-<lb/>government levels. One important public administration reform is programme budgeting – in 2005, five <lb/>ministries began the pilot process of moving towards programme budgeting (which will be fully adopted <lb/>for the 2015 Budget process), as a way of improving policy analysis and strategic input into the budgeting <lb/>process, as well as improving non-financial performance information. <lb/>The service sector has grown substantially, particularly in the financial services sector. However, <lb/>there has been stagnation in the manufacturing sector; although foreign direct investment in manufacturing <lb/>has picked up more recently a key issue is that of raising quality standards, particularly for the export <lb/>markets. The agricultural sector is important in Serbia (around 20% of GDP), but it is weak and not very <lb/>competitive. Nevertheless, the World Bank (2006) regards it as having considerable potential as an engine <lb/>of growth in Serbia. <lb/>The privatisation programme has been extensive, particularly through foreign direct investment in <lb/>finance, transport, storage, communication, and manufacturing (EUR 12 billion between 2001 and 2009) <lb/>(Government of the Republic of Serbia European Integration Office, 2011). But according to the National <lb/>Programme for Integration of Serbia into the EU, further privatisation needs to be carried out, including <lb/>that of state and socially owned organisations (Government of the Republic of Serbia European Integration <lb/>Office, 2011). This might include state-owned tourist offices and most companies with socially owned <lb/>capital. <lb/>SME Policy <lb/>Serbia has made major improvements to its SME environment, and in the last decade has seen <lb/>substantial growth in the sector (OECD, 2011). However, this was based on excessive public and personal <lb/>consumption, with increasing differences in regional development evident, alongside a trend to de-<lb/></body>

			<page>22 <lb/></page>

			<body>industrialisation, and there has been a decline in jobs in the sector after the 2008 crisis. There are also still <lb/>some competition issues to be addressed, particularly where powerful companies dominate markets. It is <lb/>argued that future growth and policy needs to be more strategic, focusing on competitive and innovative <lb/>SME potential for growth (Hadzic and Pavlović, 2011). Moreover, the development of the sector also <lb/>relies on further improvements to its institutional environment: in the recent Global Competitiveness <lb/>Report (Word Economic Forum, 2011) Serbia ranks particularly low on the quality and efficiency of its <lb/>institutional environment, its macroeconomic environment, goods market efficiency, and business <lb/>sophistication. It ranks relatively highly on its higher education, health and primary education (with <lb/>relatively high rankings on the following subsidiary items: telephone lines, internet bandwidth, and time to <lb/>register a business). <lb/>Table 1. Companies by legal form <lb/>(30 September 2011) <lb/>General partnerships <lb/>2,727 <lb/>Limited partnerships <lb/>434 <lb/>Limited liability companies <lb/>101,407 <lb/>Joint-stock companies <lb/>2,549 <lb/>Sole proprietorships <lb/>219,859 <lb/>Co-operatives <lb/>2,588 <lb/>Civil associations <lb/>28,448 <lb/>Other (public companies, state institutions, justice administration, local self-governments, political <lb/>organisations, trade unions, tenants&apos; associations etc.) <lb/>32,446 <lb/>TOTAL <lb/>390,458 <lb/>Source: Classification Units in the Republic of Serbia, SORS, Communication No 312, dated 15 th November 2011. <lb/>The SME sector accounts for two-thirds of all employees and is skewed towards micro-enterprises. <lb/>Other important issues that need addressing are excessive red tape and an excessive administrative burden, <lb/>complex legislation, and a lack of enforcement of business regulation. SMEs also confront inadequate <lb/>access to financial resources and the lack of appropriate financial instruments – these result in low levels of <lb/>investment in innovation (Government of the Republic of Serbia European Integration Office, 2011). This <lb/>is despite measures by Ministry of Finance and Economy and the National Agency for Regional <lb/>Development to put in place a number of programs to strengthen SMEs. <lb/></body>

Of particular concern is youth unemployment and their <lb/>employment rate. The IMF estimates that the unemployment rate (15-64) will peak at 23.9% in 2012, <lb/>before declining to 21.5% in 2015 (International Monetary Fund, 2011); whilst for young people (15-24) <lb/>the optimistic projection is for the estimated rate of 37.4% (2012) to decline to 31.5% by 2015 <lb/>(Arandarenko, 2010). In addition long-term unemployment remained static during this recent decade, the <lb/>inactivity rate of 40.3% (2012) is amongst the highest in Europe 5 , and a substantial number of people still <lb/>operate within the informal sector (estimated to be about one third of the total employment). There is some <lb/>evidence, in manufacturing, that this paradox of good growth but declining employment may be due to the <lb/>working through of underemployment in many firms and the increased productivity of continuing <lb/>employed workers in increasingly competitive national and international markets. <lb/>The Serbian government has attempted to reform its labour markets through various measures to <lb/>improve labour market flexibility, including reducing social contributions to remove obstacles to new <lb/>employment, introducing active labour market programmes (ALMPs – which form only a minority of <lb/>expenditure), and providing support programmes for redundant workers. However, in a later measure <lb/>intended to conform more closely to EU labour market regimes, the Government also increased <lb/>substantially the level of redundancy payments and thus, to a certain extent, countered earlier measures to <lb/>increase labour flexibility. It should also be noted that there have been budgetary constraints on the flexible <lb/>labour market policies, thus for example the ALMP budget was only 0.110% of GDP in 2009, 0.128% in <lb/>2010, and 0.123% in 2011. <lb/></body>

			<page>24 <lb/></page>

			<body>The main elements of ALMPs are job-matching, counselling, and development of entrepreneurship <lb/>and employment programs (employment subsidies) – but training programmes are insufficiently developed <lb/>and targeted in the National Employment Service programme (Government of the Republic of Serbia, <lb/>2011). Funds for the Public Works Programme were doubled in 2009 to help address the crisis and led to <lb/>the employment of about 10,000 people. <lb/>Social Inclusion <lb/>During the growth period of the last decade, progress was made in rural and urban areas in combating <lb/>poverty – thus as a result of economic growth absolute poverty declined, but this was also due to poverty <lb/>reduction measures (although the Gini coefficient, a measure of inequality, typically of income <lb/>distribution, increased). The poverty reduction measures comprised social welfare cash benefits (with the <lb/>major ones means tested) and social welfare services. The Centres for Social Work are largely responsible <lb/>for implementing the social protection measures, identifying needs, and matching them with community-<lb/>based services. Over half the municipalities funded day care services for elderly homecare and/or <lb/>childcare; and there are a few non-profit providers, including the Red Cross and Caritas. Social inclusion <lb/>policy benefits from inter-ministerial co-ordination through the Social Inclusion and Poverty Reduction <lb/>Unit and this can bring an important value in terms of the coherence of policies to reduce social exclusion. <lb/>The current legislation clearly establishes a framework for a European style support system, where the <lb/>state is the major player, with only the limited development of a mixed economy of provision so far. <lb/>Figure 1. <lb/>Relative poverty in Serbia (2006-2009) <lb/>Source: Government of the Republic of Serbia (2011c) <lb/>Other issues relevant to social inclusion include policies for Roma, refugees and internally displaced <lb/>people, and disabled people. Based on the Serbian 2011 Census, there were 147,604 Roma in Serbia, but <lb/>estimates from NGOs and international organisations put the figure between 300,000 and 460,000, that is <lb/>around 5% of the population (Bodewig and Sethis (2005); Report of the OSCE-ODHIR Roundtable <lb/></body>

			<page>25 <lb/></page>

			<body>(2010)). There are substantial numbers of refugees (70,707), and around 228,215 internally displaced <lb/>people in Serbia (UNHCR, January 2012 http://www.unhcr.org/pages/49e48d9f6.html); many of these face <lb/>problems of housing and employment. The example of RISE in the UK (Box 1) highlights the potential of <lb/>the social economy in addressing such issues. <lb/></body>

			<note place="footnote">Box 1. RISE: UnLtd&apos;s Refugee Initiative for Social Entrepreneurs <lb/>UnLtd is a UK based charity which funds social entrepreneurs with small grants and various support measures. A <lb/>few years ago it gained EU funding through the European Refugee Fund Phase III, and with the support of the UK <lb/>Border Agency it established RISE, the Refugee Initiative for Social Entrepreneurs. This operated similarly to UnLtd&apos;s <lb/>other small grants/support programme, but it also channelled access to other financial support, such as Comic Relief <lb/>which is a national event-based charity with various target groups, including an emphasis on assisting women – such <lb/>as refugee and asylum seeking women. The overall aim of UnLtd&apos;s RISE programme was to move from project funding <lb/>to more sustainable economic initiatives through social entrepreneurship and to &quot; this programme aims to unleash and <lb/>encourage the potential of refugees as social entrepreneurs &quot; . RISE is no longer taking applications, but refugees can <lb/>access UnLtd&apos;s regular awards system. <lb/>Source : http://www.unltd.org.uk/template.php?ID=55 <lb/>As with other countries in the region there is a favourable framework supporting the employment of <lb/>people with disabilities. The law on professional rehabilitation and employment of persons with disabilities <lb/>obliges employers (with greater than 20 employees) to employ one person with a disability, and another for <lb/>every 50 employees (that is, two percent of employees). Those employers who do not comply with this <lb/>obligation, are required to contract with disability companies for products or services, or pay into a fund, <lb/>the Budget Fund, which may then be used for integration measures supporting people with disabilities. <lb/>Regional and urban/rural disparities are substantial, with Belgrade and the Vojvodina province being <lb/>most developed, whilst south and east Serbia suffer considerable underdevelopment. Rural areas have <lb/>much higher poverty rates than urban areas (twice the level in 2010, with 13.6% being below the absolute <lb/>poverty line in rural areas, compared to 5.7% in urban areas). <lb/>Serbia became a candidate country for EU accession in March 2012 ,and this has been a major driver <lb/>of the reform process. EU membership requires: the stability of institutions guaranteeing democracy, the <lb/>rule of law and human rights; the development of a functioning market economy; and, the ability to adhere <lb/>to the aims of political, economic and monetary union. Clearly the European Commission is satisfied with <lb/>the general trajectory of Serbia&apos;s programme for integration, but in a recent publication (European <lb/>Commission, 2011a) they noted a number of areas that need to be addressed including the following that <lb/>seem particularly relevant to social entrepreneurship: more consultation with the stakeholders in the <lb/>legislative process; ensuring that central government policy is implemented at local levels; addressing <lb/>issues of bias/corruption in public procurement; continued concern about refugees, Roma, and internally <lb/>displaced persons; and, economically, greater effort in addressing process issues, like removing red tape. <lb/>The Current Landscape of Social Entrepreneurship <lb/>This brief section gives an overview of the current landscape of social entrepreneurship. It focuses on <lb/>the state of traditional social economy sectors (non-governmental organisations – NGOs (civil associations, <lb/>civil society organisations), foundations and charitable trusts, co-operatives, companies for the disabled, <lb/>etc.), as well as emerging trends (quasi-social enterprise using company structures), and the development <lb/>of a new sector and networks. It goes on to examine the Serbian experience in this field. <lb/></note>

			<note place="footnote">The &quot; social economy &quot; has its roots in France, and may be seen both as a set of types of <lb/>organisations between private business in the market, and the state – these being as already mentioned: co-<lb/>operatives, mutuals, associations (non-profits), and foundations. The social economy may be seen as a <lb/>sector with a distinctive set of values both in its purpose and the way it operates, and so supporting <lb/>democracy, equality, and solidarity. This perspective has achieved high level recognition in the European <lb/>Union, with high level representation through &quot; Social Economy Europe &quot; the representative institution for <lb/>the social economy which promotes its policy interests at the EU level (European Commission: <lb/>http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/policies/sme/promoting-entrepreneurship/social-economy/index_en.htm). <lb/>The US perspective on the term &quot; social entrepreneurship &quot; has been strongly influenced by US <lb/>philanthropic organisations and networks and has been applied to a wide range of phenomenon from non-<lb/>profit and non-governmental organisation activities, to social innovation, and businesses with a social <lb/>purpose and it embraces business practices. <lb/>But in Europe it is more often seen as an entrepreneurial process that results in the creation of social <lb/>enterprise. The OECD refers to social entrepreneurship as entrepreneurship that &quot; aims to provide <lb/>innovative solutions to unsolved social problems […]. It often goes hand in hand with social innovation <lb/>processes &quot; (OECD, 2010). Social entrepreneurs link themselves to a wide spectrum of organisations that <lb/>have an entrepreneurial approach and whose overall primary mission is to tackle social problems (OECD, <lb/>2010). Non-governmental organisations are, as the name suggests, non-governmental, private organisations <lb/>which are not profit oriented, and whose activities are often developmental (as in third world <lb/>development), or concerned with advocacy, or service providing; but in many countries the term is used <lb/>interchangeably with non-profit organisation. <lb/>Social enterprise is defined by OECD LEED as follows: social enterprises are all private activities <lb/>conducted in the public interest, organised within the framework of an entrepreneurial strategy the key <lb/>objective of which is not maximisation of profits but fulfilment of certain economic and social objectives <lb/>and which has the ability to put forward innovative solutions to the problem of social exclusion and <lb/>unemployment (OECD, 1999). <lb/>The EMES European Research Network (www.emes.net) has developed a similar definition of social <lb/>enterprises which is an empirically grounded European approach and sees the development of social <lb/>enterprise as being a new social entrepreneurship dynamic within the social economy (Borzaga and <lb/>Defourny, 2001). The main reason of existence for a social enterprise is the continuous activity of <lb/>producing goods and/or selling services and they face a significant level of economic risk. Although they <lb/>can use volunteers an amount of paid work is required. Their explicit aim is to benefit the community, they <lb/>are often launched by a group of citizens and the distribution of the profits (which are called surplus) is <lb/>limited because the majority of the surplus is reinvested in the mission of the social enterprise. <lb/>More recently, the European Commission has defined social enterprise (equivalent to &quot; social <lb/>business &quot; ) as being &quot; an operator in the social economy whose main objective is to have a social impact <lb/>rather than make a profit for their owners or shareholders. It operates by providing goods and services for <lb/>the market in an entrepreneurial and innovative fashion and uses its profits primarily to achieve social <lb/>objectives. It is managed in an open and responsible manner and, in particular, involves employees, <lb/>consumers and stakeholders affected by its commercial activities &quot; . (European Commission, 2011b) <lb/>In this study, social enterprise is understood within the framework provided by the OECD LEED <lb/>definition and also incorporates elements of the EMES approach. However, it is recognised that there are <lb/>certain difficulties in locating traditional and new forms of &quot; social entrepreneurship &quot; in relation to <lb/>international terminologies, concepts and experiences. The &quot; socially owned &quot; enterprises of the socialist <lb/>era have been largely discredited, with the result that well regarded international experiences of social <lb/></note>

			<body>enterprise, social entrepreneurship, and the social economy, face considerable difficulties in establishing <lb/>their hard-won credentials in the mind&apos;s eye of many Serbs. The OECD research team heard that it was a <lb/>common Serbian view that they had done the &quot; social economy &quot; unsuccessfully, and consequently there <lb/>was a fear about returning to the past; that the social economy could be confused with passive social <lb/>support and active labour market programmes; and that old social enterprises, such as agricultural co-<lb/>operatives, are regarded as informally privatised. But it was also recognised that a clear definition of social <lb/>enterprise would help re-establish the value of the social entrepreneurship approach. <lb/>In this context it is worth mentioning that this is not unique to Serbia, but is a common issue in <lb/>many formerly socialist countries. However, this should not detract from the internationally recognised <lb/>contribution of social economy organisations. <lb/>Note that a wide variety of legal forms are used by social enterprises in Serbia; these will be placed <lb/>within the traditional typology of the social economy – CMAF (co-operatives, mutuals, associations, <lb/>foundations) – or related to other boundary categories. This report continues by examining how this <lb/>framework of social entrepreneurship/social economy can be applied to the Serbian context, using <lb/>terminology that seems most relevant to the Serbian situation – as background, it may be interesting to <lb/>review the work of the EMES Network in a study for UNDP which included an extensive case study on <lb/>Serbia (EMES, 2008). <lb/>Companies for the Disabled <lb/>These are the only officially recognised legal form of social enterprise in Serbia; they comprise about <lb/>40 companies for vocational rehabilitation and employment of people with disabilities. They employ 1700 <lb/>people and are supported through the Budget Fund. About half of these are majority state owned, and half <lb/>privately owned. At least 50% of employees should have disabilities, including 10% with severe <lb/>disabilities. During the study visits it was reported to the OECD team that there were some issues about <lb/>late payments for disabled people working in these companies; this appears to be due to a clause in the law <lb/>which refers to refunds rather than subsidies; this has the effect of inhibiting employment, as well as <lb/>creating ambiguities about eligibility for refunds for those that have been employed. However there could <lb/>also be issues about establishing a framework for monitoring and rewarding progress to sustainability. <lb/>Non-Profit Organisations/Associations/NGOs <lb/>The term NGO is the term most commonly encountered by the OECD team to describe different <lb/>forms of non-profit organisations, such as associations and civil society organisations. Associations are <lb/>documented in the statistics and comprise a diverse range of more than 15,000 organisations (registered <lb/>under the new law by August 2011), with a further 2000 in the process of registering (although originally <lb/>there were 28,500 in the statistics), including a large number of sports clubs, and others covering <lb/>humanitarian issues, community development, culture and arts, education and research, environment, and <lb/>religious organisations, etc. 6 <lb/>A survey of NGOs in Serbia in 2005 (Civic Initiatives, 2005) noted a number of problems, including: <lb/>a lack of state support and the withdrawal of international donors, but also inadequate co-operation with <lb/>the business community, barriers in the legal regulations, and insufficient co-operation with local <lb/>authorities, etc. More recently public trust was cited as an issue, with a call for: &quot; More transparent work, <lb/>including a clearer presentation of goals and activities, but also of financing and the way NGOs &apos;earn&apos; and <lb/>spend their money would certainly help improve their relations to the public &quot; (Bertelsmann Stiftung, <lb/>2011). <lb/></body>

			<page>28 <lb/></page>

			<body>The recent Law on Associations (adopted in 2009) has improved some of the issues, by establishing a <lb/>legislative framework closer to international standards and regional best practices, and this may lead to a <lb/>more accurate and up-to-date record of their activities, but it seems only a small proportion of these are <lb/>engaged in social entrepreneurial activities. A recent survey (Civil Initiatives in conjunction with Office for <lb/>Co-operation with Civil Society of the Government of Serbia, 2011) of &quot; civil society organisations &quot; &apos; <lb/>(based on the Register of Citizens Associations, which was established by the Law on Associations in <lb/>2009) used a different classification of activity and found over a quarter in the field of social services – <lb/>many of which are likely to be older associations of disadvantaged groups. Most of the organisations <lb/>surveyed are small with low levels of income mainly from donations and membership/service fees. <lb/>NGOs already have a presence in welfare provision, particularly in the field of children and youth <lb/>with disabilities – the Lottery Fund plays an important funding role. Despite the small size and weak <lb/>capacity, NGOs are developing further in welfare service provision (a field currently dominated by state <lb/>providers), albeit partly through the enthusiasm of international donors; however capacity building <lb/>measures would be required to increase the trust and confidence of municipalities to the point where they <lb/>are ready to contract with them. Donor project funding, and previously the use of the Social Innovation <lb/>Fund 7 are assisting this process of capacity building. Larger non-profit organisations, such as Caritas and <lb/>the Ecumenical Humanitarian Organisation, are also active in the field of welfare service provision, whilst <lb/>as yet the private sector appears limited to nursing homes for the elderly. <lb/>Similarly new integrated policies for these groups combining labour market measures with social <lb/>protection measures, currently through pilot programmes and project funding (from international donors, <lb/>and within the framework of the National Action Plan for Employment for 2012), are opening the field for <lb/>innovative NGO activity (e.g. the YEM project mentioned below) – particularly in recycling and waste <lb/>management. <lb/>Foundations and Charitable Trusts <lb/>This type of organisation has also benefited from the wave of legislative reforms recently enacted to <lb/>modernise civil society, and open some options for social entrepreneurship. The Law on Charitable Trusts <lb/>and Foundations was passed in 2010 and appropriately registered. Prior to this there were only about 50 <lb/>active charitable trusts, and currently there are around 90 foundations (active, registering, or adapting to <lb/>the new law). <lb/>Thus, this form of organisation has not proved so popular as a vehicle for social entrepreneurship in <lb/>Serbia. It remains to be seen whether the new legislation will herald increased use of this form, a trend <lb/>apparent in some Eastern European countries – for example in Poland, where they form about one quarter <lb/>of potential social enterprise, as &quot; this status is more convenient for commercially oriented organisations &quot; <lb/>(EMES, 2008); this includes the renowned Barka Foundation. <lb/>Co-operatives <lb/>Data from Satellite Accounts for Co-operative Economy in Serbia (2009) indicates that there was a <lb/>total of 2126 co-operatives, and 18 co-operative unions, and that there has been a general decline in <lb/>numbers of co-operatives, members and employees over a number of years prior to that. Co-operatives <lb/>(and co-operative unions) declined from 2337 in 2007 to 2140 in 2009 and the number of co-operative <lb/>members declined from 125551 in 2007 to 122192 in 2009. Most of these were agricultural co-operatives, <lb/>followed by youth and student co-operatives, followed by housing. <lb/>Co-operatives suffer from a poor reputation for a number of reasons. During the post-socialist period <lb/>many have lost or have been unable to re-establish active membership, and in the process ownership has <lb/></body>

			<page>29 <lb/></page>

			<body>fallen into the hands of a few members and directors – with the result that they operate like conventional <lb/>for-profit business, and thus may be ambiguously seen as pseudo-co-operatives. It was suggested during <lb/>the study visit, that this appears to have happened in the more established agricultural co-operatives, yet it <lb/>has not prevented substantial numbers of new co-operatives being formed, partly as a result of donor <lb/>support, but these suffer the problems of being in a developmental phase, being small with a lack of <lb/>capital. The youth and student co-operatives, which in effect are a job matching service which benefits <lb/>from tax advantages, seem to have suffered a similar fate, with young people more interested in getting <lb/>casual/short term work rather than regaining their membership rights. The third largest segment of the co-<lb/>operative sector, housing co-operatives, seem to have also been exploited by managers and building <lb/>companies to the detriment of members. On the other hand there are some positive signs which could be <lb/>built on – in their survey of 239 co-operatives, Simmons et al. (2009) report that two thirds of the co-<lb/>operatives in their sample thought themselves very democratic; and other indicators of member <lb/>involvement were reported – indeed in 60% of co-operatives, members felt the co-operative had helped <lb/>raise their incomes. But there are a number of barriers to improving their capacity – credit co-operatives <lb/>are illegal (being in a similar position to micro-finance), co-operative unions are not fully controlled by <lb/>member co-operatives, and secondary co-operatives are not allowed – so limiting the potential for co-<lb/>operatives moving up the value chain – a development which might also increase competition in food <lb/>processing, where high price hikes by a &quot; processed food oligopoly &quot; have been reported (EBRD, 2011). <lb/>Unlike other parts of the social economy, co-operatives have not enjoyed modernisation of their legal <lb/>framework. This is largely due to the lack of resolution of problems associated with the restitution of <lb/>socially owned assets to members, co-operatives, or the state. This is blocking acceptance of the proposed <lb/>new law on co-operatives which would allow the development of social co-operatives. Also with reforms <lb/>and better organisation, they could contribute much more to rural development in deprived areas, and <lb/>Serbian agricultural output (currently only 20% is produced for the market, compared to 80% for <lb/>subsistence). <lb/>Quasi-social enterprise using company structures <lb/>In many countries it is not unusual for the dominant business form (limited company) to be used also <lb/>for social entrepreneurship. This is particularly the case where the concept of social enterprise and social <lb/>entrepreneurship is not generally recognised or institutionalised. The privatisation law reinforced this <lb/>tendency by insisting that privatisations were required to transform into joint stock companies, even if their <lb/>social mission would be better adapted to some form of social enterprise – for example Rudo, a <lb/>manufacturer of orthopaedic appliances. Ambiguities and uncertainties about the choice of business form <lb/>were seen by the OECD team in interviews with social entrepreneurs relating to &quot; Green and Clean &quot; , a <lb/>commercial cleaning company established by two social economy organisations, which seems to be a <lb/>social enterprise. Such hybrid structures appear to be common where foundations or NGOs wholly owned <lb/>a trading subsidiary, thereby combining social mission with economic activity. <lb/>Emerging social enterprise (informal sector) <lb/>Social enterprises often play a role in moving informal sector workers into the formal economy. In <lb/>some cases this may involve enterprises that act as agencies for people who are self-employed and who <lb/>may or may not pay taxes (that is, they may in effect remain part of the informal sector). But this mixed <lb/>mode of operation seems more common in the conventional business sector, where for example an SME <lb/>may employ its cleaners from the informal sector, in effect employing them illegally. Thus, emerging <lb/>social enterprise attempting to operate by formally employing people may face this kind of unfair <lb/>competition – as reported to the OECD team with regard to &quot; Green and Clean &quot; social enterprise. Similarly <lb/>social enterprise could employ disadvantaged workers illegally or as self-employed workers, but choosing <lb/></body>

			<page>30 <lb/></page>

			<body>to employ them legal, may result in losing a competitive advantage – unless the illegal informal <lb/>employment is addressed (see Box 2). <lb/></body>

			<page>31 <lb/></page>

			<body>Box 2. Social Entrepreneurship for the informal sector <lb/>It is clear that in many countries there is a lot of entrepreneurship in the informal sector. The challenge for policy-<lb/>makers is to regulate this, to recognise such activity can generate essential income in disadvantaged communities, but <lb/>also to channel its dynamism towards the formal sector where it can be more easily supported. There are a number of <lb/>social entrepreneurship initiatives which have facilitated such developments: Local Exchange Trading Systems (LETS) <lb/>allow people to build up entrepreneurial activity by trading informally before they go formal. See: <lb/>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_exchange_trading_system. Other initiatives led by trade unions help provide <lb/>services to support self-employed workers such as health insurance schemes. <lb/>In Serbia, the project SWIFT (Sustainable Waste Management Initiative for a Healthier Tomorrow) illustrates an <lb/>innovative path for assisting disadvantaged Roma in the informal sector. It has received substantial international and <lb/>national support to develop a recycling centre and co-operative (at the end of 2010) to provide work and training for <lb/>disadvantaged workers, through recycling and waste management; and it is also linked with the Belgrade waste <lb/>management system. SWIFT&apos;s overall objective is to convert current informal waste &quot; scavenging &quot; into an effective <lb/>source of income; a secondary objective is to increase access of their workers from vulnerable populations and <lb/>communities to health, education and social services; and indirectly enable better access to public services and <lb/>integration in civil society in general. It has yet to achieve sustainability, but indicates the kind of innovation which is <lb/>needed to improve the position of disadvantaged informal sector workers. <lb/>Source : http://www.swift.rs/eng <lb/>Benefits of Social Entrepreneurship <lb/>This section emphasises the benefits of pursuing policies to support social entrepreneurship, such as <lb/>the way in which it builds on a self-help dynamic for jobs/services, develops social capital, helps <lb/>strengthen civil society, is an essential part of an inclusion strategy; and contributes to local economic <lb/>development, etc. <lb/>Social enterprises are considered to operate more flexibly than the public sector, and have a trust <lb/>advantage over for-profits (Spear, 2004); this is because their structure means they are not designed to <lb/>make private profit from addressing social problems, and they typically provide various externalities that <lb/>add social value to an economic exchange. These added values are due to their typical operating <lb/>characteristics: participative structures giving users and staff greater involvement (as well as supporting <lb/>active citizenship), multi-stakeholder structures providing more social cohesion, and proximity services <lb/>(locally based, close to users and the community). <lb/>The benefits of social entrepreneurship can also be seen in policy, where several policy themes <lb/>emphasise the value of social enterprise and social entrepreneurship: <lb/> Employment and economic competitiveness – social enterprises contribute to help build an <lb/>enterprise society in which small firms of all kinds thrive and reduce the persistent gap in growth <lb/>rates between regions. They are an important source of entrepreneurship and jobs, particularly <lb/>for more disadvantaged individuals and communities, where they help to develop a self-help <lb/>dynamic. <lb/> Social inclusion and social cohesion – social enterprises, through multi-stakeholder structures <lb/>and user involvement, help build social cohesion and provide a strong basis for self-help, <lb/>assisting both economic and social development of disadvantaged communities in urban and rural <lb/>areas. <lb/></body>

			<page>32 <lb/></page>

			<body> Social capital – social economy organisations build trust relations and civic engagement leading <lb/>to a more involved and active citizenship – this is because they are typically membership <lb/>organisations linking people together in democratic structures; and they often have multi-<lb/>stakeholder governance systems which help strengthen inter-group relations. It is widely <lb/>recognised that building trust makes the whole economy and society function better. <lb/> Service provision – social economy organisations improve the quality and efficiency of <lb/>(public/welfare) service delivery, through greater trust, proximity to users, and through their <lb/>social mission. <lb/>And there are two market rationales that recognise the benefits of social enterprise: <lb/> Service provision – social enterprise fill a gap in the market (addressing market failures) to meet <lb/>community needs or to add value to existing public service delivery. <lb/> Social enterprise combine social and economic dimensions and are thereby uniquely placed to <lb/>support the rise of new ethical markets; in fair trade and environmentally friendly goods and <lb/>services. <lb/>In terms of European policy debate, it is also recognised that social economy makes key contributions <lb/>to major policy themes: public services, general interest, social cohesion, and employment (e.g. Ciriec, <lb/>2007); and that it is central to certain values in welfare/health services that need to be preserved: values of <lb/>equality, solidarity, respect for human dignity, and the principles of accessibility, universal service, <lb/>continuity, proximity to service users (user involvement). Further emphasis on some of these themes was <lb/>seen in the EU Social Business Initiative, launched in October 2011. Three themes were emphasised: <lb/>encouraging responsible business through better corporate social responsibility, including more <lb/>transparency and accountability, and facilitating social entrepreneurship, particularly through social <lb/>investment; and cutting red tape for SMEs. The Social Business Initiative was launched because it was <lb/>argued that social business would contribute to EU2020 strategy, by developing inclusive growth (through <lb/>sustainable jobs, work integration, better quality of social and healthcare services), moving towards <lb/>sustainable growth (by reducing emissions and waste, and using natural resources and energy more <lb/>efficiently), and developing smart growth (through innovation and participatory internet use). See Annex 1 <lb/>for more details. <lb/>It is also important to locate policy for social enterprise within meta-narratives of policy discourse, <lb/>which locate their benefits in a wider framework. Thus for example in the UK, the Labour Government <lb/>under Tony Blair (1997-2007) pursued the so-called &quot; Third Way &quot; had a broad societal agenda aimed at <lb/>the renewal of social democracy, with an emphasis on social justice, but strongly emphasising the market; <lb/>it also provided legitimacy and laid the foundations for subsequent policy on social enterprise. <lb/>In Europe, social enterprises operate in a number of fields, and legislation has been used in a number <lb/>of countries to give recognition and support development of this emerging field: Work Integration Social <lb/>Enterprise (WISE) have become increasingly recognised in legislation as an area of social enterprise <lb/>effectiveness. However, social enterprises have also gained recognition in legislation in service provision: <lb/>proximity/community services, health/social services, and in recent Italian legislation, even more broadly <lb/>in social utility: which includes environmental/ecological activities, culture, heritage, social tourism, <lb/>research, and education. With regard to model legislation, the Italian social co-operatives have been a <lb/>model in many countries. These are classified as two types: type A for social services and type B for labour <lb/>market or work integration services; and the 2006 legislation for social enterprise is a model for a broader <lb/>range of services (aiming for social utility). <lb/></body>

			<page>33 <lb/></page>

			<body>However, it is clear that there is varying effectiveness of different legislations – with widely varying <lb/>numbers of registrations. The reasons appear to be: overly restrictive requirements or the new legislation <lb/>does not provide sufficient advantage compared to relevant existing legislation. Thus, for example, <lb/>relatively few have been formed in each of the following countries: Greece, France, Finland, and Sweden <lb/>(where the &quot; Firm with Limited Profit Distribution &quot; (2006) has attracted little interest). The most popular <lb/>structures are in Italy and the UK. In many countries it is still the case that most social enterprise use the <lb/>most flexible legal form available – for example: in Belgium, the non-profit (association sans but <lb/>lucrative, a.s.b.l.), and in Sweden, the co-operative. <lb/>Accordingly, when considering the need for new legislation for social enterprise it is important to <lb/>consider: fields of activities, its adaptability/flexibility, effectiveness of current legislation, regulatory <lb/>framework; and it is noteworthy that one rationale for legislation is to gain an increased recognition of <lb/>social enterprises as a &quot; brand &quot; . <lb/>Brief Summary <lb/>Serbia has emerged from a turbulent period of its history and made important progress towards <lb/>democracy and a market economy. Unfortunately the global economic crisis has brought new problems of <lb/>stagnation with high public and private debt and increasing unemployment. Numerous political, economic, <lb/>and institutional reforms have been carried out, but further structural reforms or required, including: <lb/>administrative reforms, addressing corruption in procurement, further privatisation, measures to strengthen <lb/>SMEs and the agricultural sector, which include better access to bank finance, and improving the <lb/>functioning of micro-finance -so that jobs can be created and entrepreneurship supported. This is <lb/>particularly important because the employment rate is low amongst young people, and there are a variety <lb/>of groups facing social exclusion (including Roma, people with disabilities, and refugees and internally <lb/>displaced people), together with considerable regional disparities; and there is a substantial informal <lb/>economy. Thus, entrepreneurship and work integration need to be more fully addressed. A return visit by <lb/>the IMF, and the programme of reforms leading to EU accession, will both increase pressure for these <lb/>reforms. <lb/>Despite some cultural barriers in Serbia, social entrepreneurship could make an important contribution <lb/>to many of these areas, as it has in many other countries in Europe – through work integration for <lb/>employment and social inclusion, through more socially cohesive welfare services, and through its <lb/>contributions to civil society by building trust and social capital. The context for social entrepreneurship <lb/>has been considerably enhanced through a wide range of institutional reforms, but despite legislative <lb/>reforms, each of the legal structures relevant to social entrepreneurship face some difficulties. So far the <lb/>opportunities for social entrepreneurship have been rather limited with some work integration initiatives <lb/>and some welfare service provision, albeit within a framework of rather limited access to public <lb/>procurement markets. This provides clear indications of the potential of social entrepreneurship, but in <lb/>order to develop a more sustainable sector more needs to be done if that potential is to be fulfilled. The <lb/>emerging networks supporting social entrepreneurship, though weak, are energetic and capable, and with <lb/>some focused government support there is some optimism for the future. <lb/></body>

			<body>CHAPTER 2: INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK AND POLICIES: PRE-CONDITIONS, <lb/>INFRASTRUCTURE AND GOVERNANCE <lb/>The next two chapters in this analysis are structured around six themes. This chapter addresses: <lb/>Preconditions, Infrastructure and Governance; whilst the following chapter addresses: Finance, Access to <lb/>Markets, and Skills. This chapter begins with an overall assessment of existing measures and policies and <lb/>their effectiveness, challenges, barriers, and issues for development before moving into the first three <lb/>themes: Pre-conditions, Infrastructure, and Governance. <lb/>The opening section of this report provided a brief overview of the main policy contexts relevant to <lb/>the development of social entrepreneurship in Serbia. The major policy areas which link with social <lb/>enterprise are: labour market policy, social inclusion policy, and welfare service policy. However, social <lb/>enterprise can make important contributions in other areas of the economy and society; in Serbia these <lb/>include agriculture, rural development and the environment. In addition, appropriate policy for social <lb/>enterprise needs to integrate with SME policy and as a result touches on financial services policy. <lb/>In general terms, Serbia has taken an impressive number of measures to establish a modern <lb/>framework for the development of social entrepreneurship. This applies particularly to laying the <lb/>foundations of that development through appropriate legislative measures, such as new laws for <lb/>foundations and associations. It has also made important strides in developing national institutions which <lb/>can co-ordinate policy and the development of the sector. However, the sector is still weak and emerging in <lb/>an environment which, if not hostile, is not particularly supportive. At the same time, the institutional <lb/>framework while quite well developed at the national level still needs to be fully integrated so that it is <lb/>visible and operational for social enterprise on the ground. Policy and institutions also need to be <lb/>developed strategically and operationally to support the start-up of new social enterprise and capacity <lb/>building of existing social enterprise, nationally. Given this picture, and the considerable progress made in <lb/>overcoming the challenges of a recent difficult past, it would be surprising if there were not a number of <lb/>policy gaps and barriers to development that remain to be addressed. These will be discussed in more depth <lb/>below. <lb/>Pre-conditions <lb/>As noted in the introduction, the post-war era of Yugoslav socialism has left some unfavourable <lb/>legacies in the form of public distrust of forms of social ownership 8 , with the result that new initiatives of <lb/>social entrepreneurship, social enterprise and the social economy which are so highly valued in other parts <lb/>of Europe and the world, are either misunderstood or distrusted at the current time in Serbia; and this <lb/>applies even more so to co-operatives. Changing the cultural dimension of social enterprise and social <lb/>entrepreneurship is a key challenge. <lb/>Another heritage of the Yugoslav era is a strong dependency on the state alongside strong distrust of <lb/>the state. Thus, there remains a strong belief among many people, including some met during the OECD <lb/>study visit, that when a social need has been articulated the next step is advocacy, persuasion, and <lb/>networking to get the state to provide. Indeed, the OECD team met in Novi Sad one potential social <lb/>entrepreneur with great drive and innovation who had established a project which transported people with <lb/>disabilities (to school, etc.), who vigorously proposed that the state should take this on as a regular service, <lb/>and equally vigorously rejected any thoughts that generating income from the project might facilitate that <lb/>development. <lb/>In the context of recovering from the economic crisis all over Europe, and the forthcoming visit of the <lb/>IMF, budgetary constraints are likely to continue for several years and these aspirations for better welfare <lb/></body>

			<page>35 <lb/></page>

			<body>services, labour market programmes, and social inclusion programmes will not be met without new <lb/>thinking about other strategies such as social entrepreneurship. Shifting this pattern of thinking towards <lb/>social entrepreneurship is clearly one challenge. <lb/>Developing an entrepreneurial culture has been an important theme in many countries since it was <lb/>recognised that growth, in particular job growth, relies strongly on the formation and development of small <lb/>and medium enterprises. Thus, entrepreneurship is an important theme in policy including through <lb/>education and training programmes (also in business schools), and through support measures for new <lb/>entrepreneurs. <lb/>The scale of the informal sector, currently over 30% of the economy (Bertelsmann Stiftung, 2011) and <lb/>apparently significantly higher in recent years, indicates that something entrepreneurial is happening. At <lb/>the same time, the skewing of SME activity towards micro-enterprise also reinforces the idea that the <lb/>challenge is firstly to support the formalisation of initiatives (bringing them into the formal economy), and <lb/>secondly in a parallel measure to support the strengthening of the micro-enterprises; identifying winners or <lb/> &quot; gazelles &quot; is also regarded as an important policy challenge. <lb/>The Global Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM) studies provide a useful international comparative <lb/>perspective on the level of entrepreneurship in Serbia. As Radojevich-Kelley (2011) reports: <lb/> &quot; a recent GEM report (2009) indicates that Serbia is highly necessity driven as far as <lb/>entrepreneurship and relies heavily on established business ownership rather than on early stage, <lb/>nascent entrepreneurial activities (Bosma and Levie, 2009). Over the past several years, Serbia <lb/>has seen a decline in the nascent entrepreneurship rate, new business ownership rates, early stage <lb/>entrepreneurship rates compared to other similar efficiency driven economies (Bosma and Levie, <lb/>2009). &quot; <lb/>This is clearly a concern, although Radojevich-Kelley (2011) later in the same article argues that the tide <lb/>has turned and entrepreneurship is gaining ground in Serbia in the belief that it leads to a better life. <lb/>Nonetheless, this climate is also likely to influence approaches to social entrepreneurship, and the <lb/>challenge is to change culture and attitudes both towards conventional entrepreneurship as well as to social <lb/>entrepreneurship. It is also important to recognise the importance of social entrepreneurship in addressing <lb/>socio-economic development, through different kinds of policy measures from start-up, from the informal <lb/>sector, and for growth. Arguments for developing policy for social entrepreneurship were recognised, for <lb/>example, by the British government at the time of the 2008 economic crisis when it awarded approximately <lb/>EUR 600 000 to the School for Social Entrepreneurs in order for it to build its capacity for training social <lb/>entrepreneurs (although the scale of this intervention may not be so relevant to the currently constrained <lb/>public budgets in Serbia). <lb/>Despite some impressive examples of social entrepreneurship, the OECD team encountered social <lb/>entrepreneurs who were not positive about their potential for development. This appeared to be partly due <lb/>to issues addressed in this chapter and the next (unfair competition with the informal sector, poor access to <lb/>procurement markets, etc.) but possibly also due to the need to establish realistic expectations of social <lb/>entrepreneurship in this time of economic crisis and budgetary restraint. <lb/>There are other cultural issues that appear more linked to fundamental views about trust and fairness <lb/>in society. In other words the extent to which success and achievement can be seen as the result of hard <lb/>work, knowledge and skill, or the result of preferential treatment and good connections. <lb/></body>

			<body>Attitudes of Institutions to Social Entrepreneurship <lb/>It is well documented that there are general issues about the banks&apos; relationship with SMEs in Serbia. <lb/>The situation is likely to be even more difficult for social enterprise, and it was stated to the OECD team <lb/>that legal recognition would help banks understand social enterprises better. There has been a large amount <lb/>of foreign direct investment into the financial services in the last decade, and the sector is now dominated <lb/>by international banks. It is notable that international banks can, through their corporate social <lb/>responsibility (CSR) programmes, be very supportive of social enterprise – as the example of Erste Bank in <lb/>Serbia demonstrates. <lb/>It was reported to the OECD team that multi-nationals operating in Serbia do not show the same level <lb/>of CSR generosity as in their headquarter country. This notwithstanding, there is some evidence of good <lb/>practices developing: the Global Compact Network in Serbia had 57 signatories (including 32 companies <lb/>and 17 NGOs) in 2010, with six working groups including one on CSR in banking and finance. Its current <lb/>focus appears rather limited: on financial education, and developing new products for the Serbian market <lb/>(green projects, charity donation savings scheme, affinity cards) and the working group for social inclusion <lb/>and persons with disabilities has developed partnerships between private sector and organisations for <lb/>people with disabilities. However, in a broad survey in 2006 (World Bank), financial services companies <lb/>(in Serbia and Montenegro) were the only ones that thought correcting social inequalities was a part of <lb/>CSR (and this was only supported by about 5% of the sample); nonetheless 83% had carried out social <lb/>projects in the previous three years, and about half of these were in partnership with NGOs. There are <lb/>some exemplary practices amongst international banks in Serbia: UniCredit Bank Serbia (third largest bank <lb/>in Serbia) and UniCredit Foundation support Group 484 and the social enterprise financing project <lb/> &quot; Financial and Technical Assistance for Sustainable Social Economy of Serbia &quot; . Crédit Agricole Serbia <lb/>has CSR projects supporting children&apos;s rights. But the shining example is Erste Bank which has a wide <lb/>range of projects supporting social entrepreneurship. The government strategy for taking CSR forward has <lb/>been established in the National Strategy on CSR 2010-2015, however its implementation is still in the <lb/>early phase, and it could be more closely oriented to social entrepreneurship, which is only mentioned once <lb/>in the draft document in relation to procurement supply chains (Working Group, 2010). <lb/>As the above examples of exemplary practices demonstrate the procurement supply chain strategy, <lb/>while important, is not the only one of relevance to social entrepreneurship. At the same time, the supply <lb/>chain opportunity refers more generally to relations between SMEs and large companies not just in <lb/>procurement, but in the overall economy. Here it appears that there are insufficient linkages which make <lb/>use of the capabilities of SMEs in sub-contracting supply chains. This reduces the potential of SMEs to <lb/>develop a stronger position in the economy. This is also likely to limit the potential social enterprise <lb/>contract with larger companies (e.g. &quot; Green and Clean &quot; for cleaning services), and may influence CSR <lb/>related contracting too. <lb/>As far as the attitude of public institutions, especially at local level, such as in relation to policies <lb/>related to procurement, two issues were reported to the OECD team. Firstly, although there may be a <lb/>national policy framework relevant to social entrepreneurial activity, local officials did not necessarily <lb/>know about it or know how it should be implemented. Secondly, if they did know about it they might not <lb/>be disposed to adopting and implementing the policy for various reasons which might be budgetary or <lb/>political; as one group interviewed stated &quot; politics is important for public procurement &quot; . This issue seems <lb/>partly to do with communication and integration of policy at all levels of government, and partly to do with <lb/>the fragmented nature of government in Serbia. <lb/>It is important also to develop the role of other institutions in creating a climate favourable to social <lb/>entrepreneurship. This applies particularly to the intellectual sphere of society: universities, research <lb/>institutes, and think tanks. The OECD team was impressed by the high calibre of many young people <lb/></body>

			<page>37 <lb/></page>

			<body>attracted to developing the social entrepreneurship sector; we also met some very well-informed academics <lb/>and consultants, and subsequent research has shown a significant amount of research on social <lb/>entrepreneurship in Serbia also taking place outside the country. These diverse actors in some cases are <lb/>networked but in others they are less integrated; thus, the potential for building and exploiting a knowledge <lb/>base for social entrepreneurship in Serbia could be improved, and thereby play a role in strengthening the <lb/>climate for social entrepreneurship. Developing good links with the media is another important area, where <lb/>international experience confirms that investment of time and effort has clearly paid off. <lb/>International donors also play an important role in shaping agendas and creating a climate for social <lb/>entrepreneurship. Several of these appear to have developed an impressive focus of activity around the <lb/>social enterprise/social entrepreneurship theme – including British Council, UNDP and USAID. Through <lb/>project funding, this has created a number of model social enterprises which have proved important in <lb/>raising the profile of the field. While there appears to be a downward trend in international donor support, <lb/>the roadmap towards EU accession clearly needs to emphasise the importance of social enterprise, the <lb/>social economy, and social entrepreneurship. <lb/>Informal Economy <lb/>The OECD team on a number of occasions encountered the view that the informal economy <lb/>frequently hampered the legitimate activities of social enterprise. This appears to be a theme which is also <lb/>relevant to the performance of SMEs, and continues to be an important concern for policymakers. Recent <lb/>research finds that the informal economy is most prominent in the following sectors: trade in goods and <lb/>services, building and construction, small-scale subcontracting services, household services, and <lb/>agriculture (Andrić and Mijović, 2010). Reforms on labour taxes and social security contributions in 2007 <lb/>may contribute to a reduction in the size of the informal sector – but exploitation of inadequate monitoring <lb/>systems by SMEs and larger enterprises may need firmer measures; similarly the apparent ease in &quot; gaining <lb/>access to a range of social benefits through the simple act of registering as unemployed with the <lb/>unemployment service, while actually working in the informal economy &quot; (Krstic and Sanfey, 2010) <lb/>remains an important issue to be addressed. The following case study (Box 3) shows how local <lb/>municipalities can create a framework for supporting the transition from exclusion in the informal sector, <lb/>to employment and access to services. <lb/></body>

			<body>Box 3. Capacity Building Informal Economy and Transitioning to Social Enterprise: ASMARE (Associação dos <lb/>Catadores de Papel, Papelão e Material Reaproveitável or the Association of Paper, Carton and Recyclable <lb/>Material Pickers) <lb/>ASMARE, in the city of Belo Horizonte (Brazil), originated in 1990 as an organised group of waste pickers, <lb/>although they had gained recognition in earlier years when they resisted official harassment with some support from <lb/>church based organisations especially the Pastoral de Rua. Waste pickers, mainly men, sort and scavenge urban <lb/>waste for re-useable material which they can sell or re-use. They came together initially to demand legal right to work <lb/>as waste pickers in the city and to have secure places to store materials. <lb/>ASMARE is now governed by a statute agreed with the city authority which sets out membership criteria and <lb/>some rules to govern its operation. A monthly membership fee gives pickers access to certain entitlements such as <lb/>use of public transport, access to childcare, and health insurance. They can also participate in regular meetings of the <lb/>organisation to discuss accounts, profit sharing and there are different committees which tackle various aspects of the <lb/>work. It has over time taken on additional programmes such as literacy, adult education, health, and childcare. It has <lb/>retained partnerships with church groups and expanded its network of connections over a 20 year period and <lb/>developed its organisational expertise (with assistance from Pastoral de Rua and others who provided technical <lb/>assistance). Nevertheless for some pickers this degree of formalisation has been too much and not all have joined <lb/>ASMARE (Carrasco, 2009). Estimates suggest that ASMARE has up to 380 members and collects about 450 tons of <lb/>waste each month including paper, cardboard, aluminium and plastics. ASMARE, is categorised in some reports as a <lb/>non-government organisation (WISER) although it shares more traits with a social enterprise which distributes profits <lb/>and elects its own leaders. <lb/>Source: C.Carrasco:/www.bestpractices-healthpromotion.com/attachments/File/best-<lb/>practices/Exemplary%20students%20papers/Christine_Carrasco_Assignment_1_resubmission_feedback.pdf and Wiser – the social <lb/>network for Sustainability: http://www.wiser.org/organization/view/d51f446923ebb86f0ece5f9433c917f5 <lb/>Infrastructure <lb/>This section examines legal frameworks, reviewing the current possibilities and assessing the <lb/>rationale for new legislation, it goes on to review institutional capabilities at different levels (government <lb/>departments, regions, municipalities), and it examines institutions for the social economy, including social <lb/>enterprises, as well as considering issues of representation and advocacy and the role of existing social <lb/>entrepreneurship coalitions and networks. Finally, it discusses business support structures relevant to the <lb/>SME and social entrepreneurship sectors. <lb/>Legal Frameworks <lb/>Currently social enterprises are formed using a variety of legal frameworks with varying strengths and <lb/>weaknesses. The section begins by briefly reviewing the relevant legislation: <lb/>Companies for the disabled <lb/>The Law on Professional Rehabilitation and Employment of Persons with Disabilities specifies the <lb/>term social enterprise as a separate subcategory and links it to addressing the needs of people with <lb/>disabilities. The implication of this is that a social enterprise provides services for people disabilities, and <lb/>should employ at least one person with a disability. At the same time, the law requires that at least five <lb/>people with disabilities should be employed and the proportion of employees with disabilities should be at <lb/>least 50% including 10% with special employment needs. However, the law as it relates to social enterprise <lb/>does not specify the proportion of income that should be allocated for the integration of people with <lb/>disabilities (nor whether wage subsidy is standard irrespective of degree of disability) and there appears to <lb/>be some need for clarity about precisely how the tax exemptions should apply (Group 484, 2011). <lb/>The system is self funding through the Budget Fund (which supports companies for disabled directly <lb/>and through funds transferred and implemented by the National Employment Service) but there appears to <lb/></body>

			<page>39 <lb/></page>

			<body>be a lack of clarity over the extent of any surplus, and policy over what it might be used for. Any surplus <lb/>might provide some potential for extending the model beyond disabled people to disadvantaged groups. <lb/>Furthermore, the functioning of the Lottery Fund provides a useful model for managing this fund to ensure <lb/>it is closer to target organisations, and more openly responsive through the competitive system of open <lb/>calls. <lb/>Co-operatives <lb/>The law on co-operatives dates from 1996 and was last modified in 2006. A draft proposal for a new <lb/>law was prepared in 2010, and a public consultation undertaken. This draft legislation included provision <lb/>for social co-operatives, however little progress has been made since public consultation, possibly due to <lb/>the issue of restitution of social property. Currently ten people are required to form a co-operative, but this <lb/>is likely to be reduced to five if the new legislation is passed. Co-operatives enjoy the same tax regime as <lb/>associations (10% corporation tax), which is the same as that for private business. Information provided in <lb/>English about the proposed new legislation on social co-operatives (article 11 in the draft law on co-<lb/>operatives) (Group 484, 2011) does not seem to specify that social co-operatives should be non-profit or <lb/>have limited distribution constraints and although it specifies that there should be a proportion of profits be <lb/>used for social purposes, the draft law currently does not seem to specify what proportion (such as 5% or <lb/>50% or 75%). Nor is there an asset lock. These features would be more consistent with legislation adopted <lb/>in other countries, such as the Italian law. Indeed, it is worth noting that internationally the co-operative <lb/>form has been frequently used or adapted for social enterprise, as in the case of Italy or Sweden with their <lb/>well-established social co-operative forms, which has been a model for legislation in a number of other <lb/>countries in Europe. <lb/>Associations/NGOs <lb/>These are democratic member-based structures. The new Law on Associations was passed in 2009. <lb/>One of the changes was to make registration easier, since associations no longer had to register with <lb/>ministries but with the Serbian Business Registers Agency. The law requires that a minimum of three <lb/>people are required to form an association. It specifies the goals of the association should be general <lb/>interest and not for profit. However, it does allow associations to engage in economic activity as an <lb/>additional activity provided it is related to the purpose of the organisation, and that it is &quot; small-scale &quot; and <lb/>limited to the extent necessary for the achievement of the purposes of the association (which is in fact an <lb/>ambiguous requirement). The law allows for associations to establish and own companies to undertake <lb/>commercial activities. There may need to be some clarification with regard to the condition of <lb/> &quot; relatedness &quot; (to purpose), and the condition of &quot; small-scale &quot; , since there are significant fines (EUR 500-<lb/>5000 for the Association, and EUR 50-500 for directors) where the boundary with regard to the above <lb/>conditions is overstepped. The law allows any profit to be used for the general interest specified in the <lb/>constitution of the organisation. Questions have been raised about the suitability of this structure to engage <lb/>in economic activity (Group 484, 2011): firstly because of access to bank funding (possibly due to banks <lb/>unfamiliarity with this form); and, secondly, with regard to scale of economic activity (relatedness seems <lb/>less of an issue), and the extent to which it can engage in tender procedures due to these economic activity <lb/>considerations. <lb/>Two recent developments are likely to strengthen the NGO sector: the new Law on Associations <lb/>(many existing active associations have re-registered under this law); and the establishment of an <lb/>institutional framework for co-operation with civil society through the Office for Co-operation with Civil <lb/>Society which was established in 2010, their early work involves developing a Strategy for Civil Society <lb/>Development. <lb/></body>

			<page>40 <lb/></page>

			<body>Foundations <lb/>These are non-profit NGOs and compared to associations this legal structure allows a much tighter <lb/>control by the founding members. The new Law on Endowments and Foundations became operational in <lb/>2011; with regard to economic activity, it may undertake this provided it is related to the goals of the <lb/>foundation, and that it is a non-core activity – but it needs to be a registered activity. A foundation may <lb/>establish and own a company that conducts economic activities; and, as with associations, there are <lb/>significant fines (EUR 3000 to EUR 6000) if the economic activity is not related to its goals, and it is not <lb/>specified in the register of activities. A crucial issue is how specific a statement of registered activities <lb/>needs to be (relief of poverty, for example, would allow a wide scope of entrepreneurial activities). It <lb/>appears that in comparison to associations, the condition of small-scale of economic activity does not apply <lb/>in the legislation and so it appears that foundations have some advantages over associations in engaging in <lb/>economic activities. In some other countries foundations are favoured by individual or a few social <lb/>entrepreneurs since they are not accountable to a wider membership, but this is a disadvantage for building <lb/>social enterprises strongly rooted in civil society. Although not currently seen as a model for social <lb/>enterprise in Serbia, in some other European countries, such as Poland (EMES, 2008), they are seen as <lb/>very relevant and useful, with well-established exemplary cases, such as the Barka Foundation. <lb/>However, neither associations nor foundations are without difficulties in operating flexibly as a social <lb/>enterprise. The co-operative structure is more favourable and flexible, but the requirement to have ten <lb/>founding members in Serbia limits its attractiveness as a start-up legal form, since many social <lb/>entrepreneurs would be likely to start with fewer numbers. Whilst the idea of sleeping partners (members) <lb/>may be one way around this, it hardly contributes to creating a democratic culture. <lb/>Limited liability company <lb/>The remaining alternative is the limited liability company form (d.o.o in Serbian), which is flexible <lb/>and well recognised; but it is neither member-based, nor non-profit (or profit limited). It may, however, be <lb/>possible to write model constitutions and bye-laws which approximate to these conditions. As noted above <lb/>there may be quasi-social enterprise that make use of company structures. <lb/>Institutional Capabilities <lb/>Governmental capabilities <lb/>There are different institutional capabilities at different levels: government departments, regions, <lb/>municipalities. Although there is no single governmental body representing the social economy, there are <lb/>a number of bodies and structures of representation. Thus, responsibilities for the co-operatives (and SMEs <lb/>and company policies) lie with the Ministry of Finance and Economy. Also, the Ministry Labour, <lb/>Employment and Social Policy is responsible for companies for the disabled, administration of the Budget <lb/>Fund, social services and people with disabilities, as well as support for NGOs and the administration of <lb/>the Lottery Fund. The Office for Co-operation with Civil Society was established in 2010 with the aim of <lb/>establishing the institutional framework for organised co-operation with the civil sector and providing a <lb/>communication channel between the government and the civil society. SIPRU, which was established in <lb/>2009, plays an essential policy co-ordinating role in the field of social inclusion and poverty reduction. <lb/>However, social enterprise typically cuts across a number of ministerial responsibilities. <lb/>Some of the policy measures relevant for the social economy are as follows: <lb/> the National Action Employment Plan, includes a training programme for social entrepreneurs, <lb/>and is implemented through National Employment Service measures for vulnerable groups; <lb/></body>

			<page>41 <lb/></page>

			<body> Budget Fund and support to people with disabilities; <lb/> Ministry of Finance and Economy programmes for SMEs and co-operatives; <lb/> Training held by National Agency for Regional Development and regional development <lb/>agencies; <lb/> Also, The Ministry of Labour, Employment and Social Policy uses the Lottery Fund for a support <lb/>programme for more than 500 NGOs supporting people with disabilities; priorities are jointly set <lb/>with the Serbian National Organisation of People with Disabilities; they fund at three levels: <lb/> 34 national umbrella organisations with 526 local branches that receive money for their <lb/>activities; <lb/> various associations receive funding annually based on previous year&apos;s performance; and, <lb/> funding for ad hoc projects (via monthly calls/tenders). <lb/>The lottery money has five funding areas: disability, youth and sport, the Red Cross, local <lb/>municipalities for social protection (receiving 19% each), and rare diseases (5%). <lb/>Other key areas of funding for social entrepreneurship are: the Public Works programme, various <lb/>active labour market programmes, local government which influences the commissioning of welfare <lb/>services, and calls by different ministries through the system of project based tenders. <lb/>Many of these support measures are temporary, and are best suited to support a start up activity to <lb/>explore if it can achieve viability through subsequent income generating strategies. <lb/>International donor community capabilities <lb/>Although a declining force, a number of international donors have been quite influential in supporting <lb/>and shaping the social entrepreneurship agenda, and may continue to be an important alternative source of <lb/>inspiration and resources. In principle their activities are linked though co-ordination agreements (the <lb/>Serbian EU Integration Office plays a major role; and there are other government bodies negotiating co-<lb/>ordination, including through Sector Working Groups) (Government of the Republic of Serbia European <lb/>Integration Office, 2011b), and they often operate through partnerships. However, donor agencies have <lb/>their own agenda, so the extent of co-ordination has limits. The following are some examples of <lb/>international bodies and their projects: the British Council, with a focus on skills and capacity building <lb/>currently engaged in training and development of social enterprise business plans – &quot; Think Social, Act <lb/>Business &quot; Programme; UNDP, which has had a focus on social entrepreneurship, especially co-operatives, <lb/>and gender equality issues; USAID, with its interest in micro-finance; EU funded pilot project on Satellite <lb/>Accounts for Co-operatives and Mutuals in Serbia; and, the Canadian Embassy, with a project advocating <lb/>social co-operatives. Several other major international bodies, including the International Labour <lb/>Organisation and the International Organisation for Migration are also involved in various ways with <lb/>projects relevant to social enterprise, including the YEM project, and many others through the work of the <lb/>European Movement in Serbia. The now completed YEM project (a UN joint programme for Youth, <lb/>Employment and Migrants); provides an interesting model led locally by the Ministry of Labor, <lb/>Employment and Social Policy, with several other ministries and government bodies involved. It focused <lb/>on youth employment and migrants, and included support for social entrepreneurship. As the OECD team <lb/>heard this led to capacity building of 12 social enterprise. <lb/></body>

			<page>42 <lb/></page>

			<body>Corporate and associated bodies <lb/>In addition, there are donors from the private sector: Erste bank with a well developed three year CSR <lb/>strategy; Foundation Ana and Vlade Divac (a successful basketball player&apos;s foundation supporting various <lb/>projects), UniCredit bank (with the project Financial and Technical Assistance for a Sustainable Social <lb/>Economy of Serbia) and with Consorzio Gino Mattarelli it also supported the implementation of the project <lb/> &quot; Forum of Social Enterprises &quot; ; the National Alliance for Local Economic Development (NALED -<lb/>http://www.naled-serbia.org/index.php?lang=english) with its &quot; Civil Society Sector Organisation for <lb/>Competitiveness &quot; programme and CSR certification developed with its partners – Smart Kolektiv and <lb/>Balkan Community Initiative Fund; as well as Global Compact Serbia which brings together a range of <lb/>CSR organisations and actions. With appropriate strategic engagement, such bodies could prove to be a <lb/>growing source of support for social entrepreneurship in Serbia. This could most effectively take place by <lb/>more strongly emphasising social entrepreneurship in the National Strategy on Corporate Social <lb/>Responsibility, and fully implementing it. <lb/>Bodies representing/developing the social enterprise sector <lb/>A number of NGOs are founding members of the Coalition for the Development of Social <lb/>Entrepreneurship; this informal network consists of a number of development organisations that tend to <lb/>rely on donor funding. They include: <lb/> Group 484 (focus on migrants, social services and social enterprise); <lb/> European Movement in Serbia (research and advocacy; support for social entrepreneurship; and <lb/>capacity building civil society); <lb/> Smart Kolektiv (CSR and socially responsible companies); <lb/> Balkan Community Initiative Fund (supports development of local organisations); and, <lb/> Initiative for Development and Co-operation (migrants and vulnerable groups); <lb/>The goals of the Coalition are to contribute to: <lb/> create an enabling environment for social entrepreneurship; <lb/> define the legal framework for the successful operation of social enterprises; <lb/> strengthen the capacity of existing &quot; social enterprises &quot; ; and, <lb/> raise awareness of key stakeholders about the potential and social importance of social <lb/>enterprises. <lb/>Another body with some members in common also supports the development of social enterprise: the <lb/>Social Economy Network Serbia (SENS) was set up in February 2011 at a meeting of social enterprises, <lb/>gathered together by Group 484. The network has 27 members who agreed to co-operate to improve <lb/>existing social enterprises, form a small internal market, and promote social entrepreneurship as an <lb/>innovative solution for the problems of poverty and social exclusion. Networks are also forming around <lb/></body>

			<page>43 <lb/></page>

			<body>particular areas of activity, for example the Green Initiative Network (involving 22 associations involved <lb/>with waste collection). <lb/>Although these bodies represent an energetic and dynamic face of the new emerging social enterprise <lb/>sector, they are also rather weak, and dependent on donor funding and support for their work and approach. <lb/>Currently, they are more concerned with advocacy to improve the framework for social entrepreneurship <lb/>and civil society. But in time they may also face questions of legitimacy, and to what extent their voice <lb/>represents this new emerging sector. That is: how accountable and representative are they? As the sector <lb/>grows there will also be issues of how to integrate the new social enterprises within the bodies representing <lb/>the established social economy, parts of which are being reconfigured in a new dynamic of social <lb/>entrepreneurship, largely through market relations. In other words, an important issue will be how to bring <lb/>together these new bodies with those representing the more established sectors of associations, <lb/>foundations, and co-operatives (as they face the challenge of being reformed). <lb/>Support bodies for traditional social economy <lb/>There are a number of bodies representing traditional parts of the social economy, these include: <lb/> NGO umbrella/support bodies such as: <lb/> Federation of NGOs in Serbia (FENS); <lb/> The Center for the Development of Non-profit Sector: this is a non-governmental, <lb/>independent, non-profit institution supporting the non-profit sector, by providing information <lb/>and documentation, communication, counselling, and education and research; <lb/> The Association of Charitable Trusts and Foundations; <lb/> 18 Co-operative Unions (The Center for the Development of the Non-Profit Sector, 2001; <lb/>Ševarlić et al. 2010), including regional federations of co-operatives, and the Co-operative <lb/>Alliance of Serbia. (Note that the Co-operative Union of Serbia is the national association of <lb/>agricultural co-operatives in Serbia.); and, <lb/> Association of Disability Companies (UIPS). <lb/>In Serbia, the general picture is one of an emerging sector of new social entrepreneurship, which also <lb/>has emerging development and representative structures. This new sector has some links, although not <lb/>particularly strong links with the traditional structures of the social economy. This may be contrasted with <lb/>some international experiences where social enterprise leadership structures try to build a broader base in <lb/>civil society with the traditional social economy (see Box 4). Creating a national body that integrates old <lb/>and new parts of the social economy will allow a system of co-governance of policy with the diverse state <lb/>ministries and agencies concerned with policy development. It will also allow capacity building at the <lb/>national level for support, self-regulation, and developing best practices. <lb/></body>

			<body>Box 4. Co-governance: The Standing Conference on the Social Economy (SKES) <lb/>The Standing Conference on the Social Economy (SKES) was an idea that arose from representatives of Polish <lb/>practitioner organisations taking part in the 2nd European Social Economy Conference held in Kraków in 2004. Its aim <lb/>was to establish a national forum in Poland to connect the various social economy organisations in a still emerging <lb/>network. A secretariat was provided by a foundation, FISE, to co-ordinate meetings. <lb/>SKES has two main aims. First, it aimed to open discussion and exchange between the variety of social economy <lb/>organisations (these included social enterprises, foundations and associations, co-operatives and mutual societies). <lb/>These had emerged since the fall of communism and the entry into the European Union in 2004. In some cases these <lb/>new organisations built on a thriving co-operative structure from the interwar years. Second, it aimed to come to <lb/>agreements about issues affecting the social economy in Poland. <lb/>In pursuit of these aims it has organised regular national meetings amongst its members, developed proposals <lb/>and collaborated with other actors including government bodies, and economic and research institutions such as the <lb/>Institute of Public Affairs. A notable achievement of SKES was to contribute to the development of the Polish Social <lb/>Economy Manifesto which was presented at the &quot; Solidarity Economy Conference &quot; in Gdańsk in June 2008. Developing <lb/>legal structures for social economy organisations and a support structure for practitioners have remained central <lb/>activities. Today, with the growing importance of the social economy in the public sphere SKES has identified <lb/>emerging challenges in relation to legislation and regulation; strategy and planning; support mechanisms; and the role <lb/>in public policy. Hence SKES is now working to develop a &quot; Pact for Social Economy &quot; to set out agreed roles and <lb/>obligations between the government and social economy organisations. <lb/>Source : http://www.bezrobocie.org.pl/x/428146 and http://www.undp.org.pl/eng/News/Polish-model-of-social-economy <lb/>Another international example provides an illustration of how the governance system of a <lb/>representative body for social entrepreneurship might be structured: in the UK, the Social Enterprise <lb/>Coalition (SEC) was formed in 2003, and aims to promote, develop and lobby for the social enterprise <lb/>sector. It is a member based organisation, and helps develop policy with government as well as <lb/>networking, and co-ordinating development activities. The governance of the Coalition is based on <lb/>different categories of members electing a small Board of 12 members alongside an elected Council of 46 <lb/>members that provides a forum for shaping policy. The Board comprises the chair (a social enterprise <lb/>practitioner), six members elected from the council (three of which should be practitioners), three members <lb/>selected through open advert (two of whom should be social enterprise practitioners), and two executive <lb/>directors (chief executive and finance director of the Coalition). The Council comprises 46 elected <lb/>members, including the Chair of the Board drawn from the 4 different categories of membership: 23 <lb/>members from social enterprises, 12 members from regional and national networks, 6 members from social <lb/>enterprise umbrella organisations, and 4 members from partner organisations. <lb/>Looking more broadly at international experience of the development of social enterprise, in the early <lb/>phase when there were relatively few social enterprises to exercise leadership in the sector, it is important <lb/>to bring together the major actors (network and umbrella organisations) in the social economy to ensure <lb/>coherence, influence and legitimacy – these included the co-operative sector (workers, consumers, <lb/>housing, etc.) and various strands of the voluntary or non-profit sector. As the sector develops the <lb/>relevance of small local umbrella bodies (like consorzi) grows – as in the following example (Box 5). <lb/></body>

It was formed in <lb/>1998 and is now the largest consortium of social enterprises in the Province of Florence; it comprises 40 organisations <lb/>which in total employ more than 1,500 people. It was established, under the Florence legal statute Article 5, with the <lb/>general goal of advancing the common interests of citizens in the town and to support social integration. In effect the <lb/>Consortium provides support, training, research, development, knowledge transfer, innovation, contracting, <lb/>communication and advocacy functions for, and with, its members as well as being able to co-design policy to some <lb/>extent with the public sector. However it has broader social roles as well which include: promoting co-operation <lb/>between co-operatives within Florence and also nationally; building the internal democracy of the organisation; and <lb/>encouraging moral values and social co-operation in society generally. Indeed, the National Law 381 passed in 1991, <lb/>recognises at a legislative level the role of social co-operatives in promoting the general interest of the community. <lb/>To remain flexible and close to the interests of the territory, in 2002 it adopted an enterprise organisational model <lb/>focused on specialisation. Since then, the Consortium offers its members a variety of services including assistance <lb/>with contract bidding and management, organisational development support, brand development, quality assurance <lb/>and social responsibility processes. The membership comprises nine type A co-operatives (which undertake <lb/>educational outreach and social services) seven type B co-operatives (which aim to integrate unemployed people back <lb/>into work) and two producer co-operatives. Co and So is well connected: it maintains close relations with trade unions, <lb/>associations and foundations, public authorities, religious organisations, universities and banks. It is governed by a <lb/>board of a dozen people; however there is an important internal democratic structure. <lb/>Because of the volume of work, the Consortium can help integrate members&apos; work across sectoral boundaries. In <lb/>this sense, a type B co-operative could gain employment opportunities for disadvantaged workers by providing entry <lb/>level work such as laundry cleaning services to a type A co-operative engaged in educational projects. The member <lb/>organisations contribute to the Consortium&apos;s budget, in recognition of the bargaining strength and services it provides <lb/>them. <lb/>The Co and So Florence is itself one member amongst 79 other networks, which together form a national <lb/>umbrella known as Consorzio Gino Mattarelli (CGM). This was founded in 1987 and now lays claim to being the largest <lb/>network of social enterprises in Italy. Its member organisations provide services across the country&apos;s regions, <lb/>provinces and communes. Over 700,000 families benefit from services CGM members provide either directly – or <lb/>indirectly in conjunction with local authorities. These services might include educational services, health care, <lb/>rehabilitation, social, educational or cultural activities. In view of its size and importance CGM has devised a <lb/>sophisticated democratic decision making structure which, from 2009, involved various layers including a participative <lb/>assembly, special group assemblies, special group committees as well as territorial groups. <lb/>Source : Co and So Firenze: http://www.coeso.org/index.html and CGM: http://www.consorziocgm.org/ <lb/>Business Support Structures Relevant to be SME and Social Entrepreneurship Sectors <lb/>In Serbia the main system of support for entrepreneurship in SMEs consists of the following elements: <lb/> financial support through start-up loans from the Serbian Development Fund, and subsidies from <lb/>the National Employment Service for self-employment or job creation; <lb/> training programmes administered by the National Agency for Regional Development with a <lb/>network of regional agencies and centres. There are various training programmes, including some <lb/>for three days, and a five day programme for young people, and there has been a pilot mentoring <lb/>programme; <lb/> the same agency also supports a schools programme for entrepreneurship; and, <lb/></body>

			<page>46 <lb/></page>

			<body> the National Employment Service also provides the largest training programme on starting a <lb/>business for over 13,000 unemployed people in their Business Centres. <lb/>It is not clear whether social enterprises have easy access to the same system of support as SMEs, <lb/>although there is access to financial support from the National Employment Service. As noted above, there <lb/>is a small ecology of donor-sponsored training and project funding which has undoubtedly contributed to <lb/>the development of some good examples of social enterprise. There are also various government funds, <lb/>such as the Budget Fund and Lottery Fund, which are generally used to support different types of social <lb/>entrepreneurship. The tender system associated with different policy measures to initiate support for <lb/>various projects has also been important for the development of social enterprise. However, if social <lb/>enterprise is not to be disadvantaged in relation to SME support for entrepreneurship, there needs to be a <lb/>similar level of training and mentoring for start-up social enterprise. Thus, opening the SME system <lb/>provision to social enterprise is an important step, but it may also be worthwhile to develop &quot; braided &quot; <lb/>support which recognises that social enterprises have some distinctive training requirements which demand <lb/>specialist support; combining access to state SME services with specialist social enterprise support services <lb/>may ensure a good geographical coverage of support. In addition, it should be noted that in some countries <lb/>specialist social enterprise development agencies have proved effective at regional and local levels, such as <lb/>in Brazil (Box 6). <lb/>Box 6. Business Support for Social Entrepreneurship in Brazil <lb/>Artemisia (São Paulo, Brazil) is a social business founded in 2003 by Potencia Ventures – an organisation <lb/>backed by entrepreneurs with interests in the US and developing economies. It aims to support the most promising <lb/>start-up social businesses. Social businesses are seen as organisations which combine a dual logic – operating a for-<lb/>profit core business which seeks both to tackle the social needs of the low income population and reduce poverty. <lb/>Artemisia supports initiatives which are seeking to help low income groups in any of three ways: offering job <lb/>opportunities; providing products or services which can help low income people (including housing, health, water); and, <lb/>delivering services which can help them progress economically (such as appropriate credit or technology). Artemisia <lb/>does this by offering a staged series of training programmes which focus in turn on aspects important for <lb/>entrepreneurship. It also offers a social business accelerator to those who have already engaged with previous training <lb/>and now want to tackle strategic challenges in their existing social business. At present Artemisia does not offer loans <lb/>or finance although it can provide links to partners who can do this. <lb/>Artemisia has a tight group of local partners in Brazil engaged in different fields including: an organisation which <lb/>can source risk capital; a hub where creative and professional people gather; private/public organisation interested in <lb/>developing entrepreneurs; research, education, training and consultancy agencies. It also has links with international <lb/>organisations interested in entrepreneurship such as Ashoka. Artemisia has 13 staff, including interns, as well as a <lb/>team of business network experts. <lb/>Source : Artemisia: http://www.artemisia.org.br/eng/artemisia.php <lb/>Governance in Policy <lb/>The report produced by Serbia&apos;s European Integration Office (2011a) on the Needs of Serbia for <lb/>International Assistance 2011-2013, identified four mid-term priorities: <lb/> enhance professional development and institutional capacity of civil service at all levels; <lb/> improve development and implementation of efficient public policies; <lb/> ensure the transparent and accountable functioning of public administration; and, <lb/></body>

			<page>47 <lb/></page>

			<body> re-engineer administrative processes through introduction of new IT solutions. <lb/>The first three of these were mentioned to the OECD study team, on several occasions, as issues <lb/>which hampered the development of social enterprise. Thus, local civil servants did not know about <lb/>national policy and how it applied, nor were budgets there to support the policy. It was reported to the <lb/>OECD team that local level capacity is weak, that communication and co-operation could be strengthened, <lb/>and that the role of regional development agencies remains unclear. In other words, there are issues around <lb/>vertical and horizontal policy integration. Furthermore, it was not clear that the implementation of policy <lb/>was always fair and above board. Horizontally, the establishment of SIPRU in 2009, and the Office for Co-<lb/>operation with Civil Society in 2010, are major steps in co-ordinating policy and channels of <lb/>communication for social entrepreneurship which typically faces considerable problems of &quot; silo &quot; thinking <lb/>and resource allocation from different ministries associated with the field. Some of these problems have <lb/>also been emphasised in other reports: <lb/>The role of the General Secretariat of the Government, however, is still essentially limited to <lb/>administrative rather than policy co-ordination. It does not have an independent capacity to <lb/>review policies and monitor the implementation of cabinet decisions. Ministries do not <lb/>sufficiently consult their draft bills with other ministries, which shifts co-ordination tasks to the <lb/>political level, overburdens cabinet meetings with essentially administrative work and contributes <lb/>to the production of low quality legislation (Bertelsmann Stiftung, 2009). <lb/>In Serbia, horizontally, this is exacerbated by difficulties in relation to different political parties <lb/>controlling different ministries (Pesic, 2007). However, a process of depoliticisation has been underway for <lb/>some years, and it is an important part of public administration reform leading up to EU accession. <lb/>(Government of the Republic of Serbia European Integration Office, 2011b) <lb/>Despite these difficulties, and the rather limited development of structures and networks representing <lb/>new social enterprise, the OECD team did note good linkages and a good level of understanding between <lb/>networks for new social enterprise and relevant government bodies. This can also be seen in documents <lb/>produced by the sector reviewing legislation for social entrepreneurship, and documents produced by <lb/>networks and conferences (Group 484, 2010) as inputs to sector strategy. There also appeared to be good <lb/>consultation practices with relevant networks of the new social enterprise sector. <lb/>This appeared to be less obvious with regard to parts of the traditional social economy. Thus, <lb/>representatives from the co-operatives met by the OECD team had long-standing grievances about the lack <lb/>of progress of the new law, whilst the companies for the disabled raised issues about delays and <lb/>ambiguities in payments for the employment of disabled people. <lb/>However, the representative bodies of new sector for social entrepreneurship are still very young and <lb/>small, and do not appear to have governance structures that would give them legitimacy within the whole <lb/>new sector. SIPRU currently plays an important role in linking with these emerging networks for the social <lb/>entrepreneurship field. But at some point, as the sector grows, it would be important to move to a <lb/>governance structure for the new sector that can be seen to be legitimately representative. Similarly, at <lb/>some point it would seem important to try to bring in new and traditional parts of the social economy <lb/>closer together in partnership or joint governance structures, so that a process of co-governance of policy <lb/>can be more broadly based. <lb/>Summary <lb/>In terms of cultural pre-conditions, there has been a heritage of distrust and state dependency, with <lb/>continuing emphasis on state provision at a time of severe budgetary constraints. There are also issues <lb/></body>

			<page>48 <lb/></page>

			<body>about developing an entrepreneurial and self-help culture and linked to this there was some evidence that <lb/>the bankruptcy laws are not conducive to taking entrepreneurial risks. There are continuing issues of <lb/>addressing corruption and lack of transparency; some relevant policy measures have been developed (albeit <lb/>some temporary and/or competitive), but not in sufficient scale, and as social enterprise typically cut across <lb/>different ministerial responsibilities, vertical and horizontal policy integration also is problematic – <lb/>requiring for example communication and education about policy frameworks to local officials. Some <lb/>business support may be available via SME programmes, but it is generally not adapted to the specific <lb/>needs of social enterprise. Research, policy and media networking could be enhanced. The profile of social <lb/>entrepreneurship in CSR programmes could be improved and relations strengthened in order improve large <lb/>firm contracting/CSR relations between SMEs and social enterprise. For social entrepreneurship to achieve <lb/>sustainability more effort is also required for building on donor project initiatives. It will also be important <lb/>to develop measures to address the size of the informal economy. Each of the potentially useable legal <lb/>structures relevant to social entrepreneurship have some difficulties of use, particularly regarding economic <lb/>activity in the non-profit sector. While overall policy governance is good for an emerging sector, it requires <lb/>considerable development to move social entrepreneurship to the next stage – both in terms of <lb/>representation by relevant civil society bodies, and in terms of a new coordinative inter-ministerial function <lb/>in government. <lb/></body>

			<body>CHAPTER 3: INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK AND POLICIES: FINANCE, SKILLS AND <lb/>ACCESS TO MARKETS <lb/>This Chapter continues with an examination of the three remaining themes: Finance, Skills, and <lb/>Access to Markets. <lb/>Finance <lb/>Finance for conventional business development is a central issue, but it is even more so for social <lb/>enterprise which face barriers in conventional financial markets, and face declining alternative sources <lb/>with the trend towards the withdrawal of international donors, until EU funding takes their place (and there <lb/>could be more than EUR 100 million to support social entrepreneurship through such programmes). <lb/>Finance for social entrepreneurship may be differentiated according to the source of funding, whether it is <lb/>from conventional sources in the private sector, from the state, or from social economy institutions. It may <lb/>also be differentiated according to what aspect or stage of entrepreneurship it is linked with: start-up, <lb/>consolidation, or growth/scaling. The classic sources of finance are: family and friends (and fools). Social <lb/>enterprises often arise in more deprived communities or where private sources of funding are not so <lb/>plentiful. This means that it is often important to have &quot; soft &quot; funding available to overcome this <lb/>disadvantage. Typically this involves grants and subsidies in the early stages of start-up, including for <lb/>business planning, feasibility studies, and subsidies during the first period to break even (18 months). <lb/>Banks <lb/>During the last decade international banks have taken a prominent position in Serbian financial <lb/>services. However, they are generally regarded as conservative and risk averse; to quote a recent <lb/>government report regarding the main development problems of SMEs: <lb/>unfavourable conditions for financing and inappropriate types and scope of financial support – <lb/>banks with expensive loan offer and short loan period are dominating. At the national and <lb/>regional level there is a lack of better developed micro-credit institutions as well as of other <lb/>financial instruments which serve real financial needs of SMEs and their economic strength <lb/>(Ministry of Finance and Economy, 2011). <lb/>This accords with views expressed to the OECD team, that social enterprises suffer additional barriers <lb/>due to banks unfamiliarity with the legal forms used by social enterprise (particularly that of civil society <lb/>organisations). Some banks are well oriented towards the needs of social enterprise, and the OECD team <lb/>met Erste Bank which has a good portfolio of activities oriented towards the sector, as does UniCredit <lb/>bank. However, it is not clear even with these banks where their corporate social responsibility activity <lb/>ends, and where their business banking begins. That is, although they are undoubtedly doing well, they <lb/>have also identified market failures. <lb/>Micro-finance <lb/>Another important issue linked to the banks, is that of micro-finance, which in Serbia suffers from an <lb/>inferior position in the financial services sector. Micro-finance is legally required to be conducted through <lb/>conventional banks, rather than directly with the client base. This leads to higher costs and greater numbers <lb/></body>

			<page>50 <lb/></page>

			<body>of transactions – bank charges mean that about half the micro-finance institutions interest income goes to <lb/>the bank. Micro-finance is particularly important for poorer people who are generally financially excluded <lb/>from the banking system, and so rely on alternative systems of credit, like micro-finance, to get themselves <lb/>out of poverty and become more entrepreneurial. According to a survey in the south of Serbia (Gies, 2010) <lb/>250,000 households would benefit from a micro-loan of about EUR 1000. This compares with the current <lb/>situation where only three micro-finance institutions operate (under the constrained circumstances <lb/>described above) with only 19 000 borrowers (Microfinance Working Group, 2011). Estimates indicate <lb/>that about three times that amount could be supplied through micro-finance investors. Several efforts to <lb/>change the situation (with international support) have failed due to the national banks fear of &quot; financial <lb/>sector instability &quot; . International experience indicates that established micro-finance institutions could meet <lb/>appropriate standards of transparency, liquidity, capital and governance. The Microfinance Working Group <lb/>for Serbia has drafted a law on micro-credit companies based on best practices, and has found expressed <lb/>interest from current and potential micro-finance investors in placing about EUR 50 million in Serbia if an <lb/>appropriate law is in place (Microfinance Working Group, 2011). <lb/></body>

			<note place="footnote">Measures to improve microcredit should be in-line with the EU Code of Good Conduct for <lb/>microcredit provision (http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/newsroom/cf/_getdocument.cfm?doc_id=6978) <lb/>Credit Unions and of Community Development Finance Initiatives <lb/>One alternative to micro-finance would be through credit unions, which are member-based financial <lb/>co-operatives. They have a sound record of assisting the financial needs of poor people in rural and urban <lb/>areas. At the moment they suffer from the same constraints as outlined above for micro-finance, but there <lb/>is considerable successful experience of establishing them in Eastern Europe with the assistance of <lb/>international credit union bodies – for example SKOK credit unions in Poland were successfully developed <lb/>with assistance from USAID, and donations from the US credit union associations, and the World Council <lb/>of Credit Unions (WOCCU). A development strategy which is available in many countries is for <lb/>agricultural co-operatives to be able to offer credit to their members, since they are particularly well placed <lb/>to make financial judgements about their members. Currently this is not allowed in Serbia. <lb/>Another option is of community development finance initiatives; these are organisations providing <lb/>credit and financial services for the purpose of supporting local community development (typically in <lb/>disadvantaged communities to overcome market failures in financial provision). They are inspired by the <lb/>US experience of community banks, and are usually centrally funded through various government <lb/>programmes. But they are structured as independent entities (NGOs), controlled by community <lb/>stakeholders; in the UK they lend mainly to micro-enterprise, small business and social enterprise <lb/>(http://www.cdfa.org.uk/). While government funding is the main source of finance for CDFIs, in the UK <lb/>almost EUR 100 million has been raised from private funding, through the Community Investment Tax <lb/>Relief (CITR) scheme which gives tax breaks to investors who invest in accredited CDFIs; the tax relief is <lb/>available to individuals and companies reducing their tax liability by up to five percent of the amount <lb/>invested per year, for up to five years. <lb/></note>

			<body>Box 7. Micro-Finance and Credit Unions: <lb/>Since 1976 when Mohammad Yunus founded the Grameen Bank to lend to the poor, microfinance has proved a <lb/>highly effective model for socio-economic development. (Yunus subsequently won the Nobel Prize for his work). <lb/>Grameen operates by lending mainly to groups of poor women who take responsibility for assisting each of their group <lb/>to meet repayments – leading to very good debt repayment ratios. Since then micro-finance has become a world-wide <lb/>tool for combating social and economic exclusion, in many countries all over the world. <lb/>Inicjatywa Mikro (IM) is a medium-size micro-finance institution providing loans to micro-entrepreneurs in <lb/>Southern Poland with the objective of enterprise job creation. Evaluation of its effectiveness showed: higher growth in <lb/>enterprise employment, sales and revenue. <lb/>Source: Manroth (2001) <lb/>Poland had traditional credit unions, these were effectively closed from the Second World War, until with the <lb/>assistance of the World Council of Credit Unions, they re-emerged when the rise of the Solidarity movement led to a <lb/>new government. The Polish credit union system – known as SKOK, is one of the fastest-growing and successful in <lb/>the world with 59 credit unions, assets of USD 4.8 billion, and with 2.2 million members, served through 1870 <lb/>branches. It now assists development in other countries, such as Belarus, Moldova and Ukraine. <lb/>Source: http://www.cuinsight.com/media/community/lessons_learned_from_polandandrsquos_credit_unions.html <lb/>Budget Fund <lb/>As noted above the Budget Fund draws its income from penalty payments by employers who do not <lb/>comply with the obligation to employ a certain proportion of people with disabilities. Since being <lb/>established this fund has acquired about EUR 35 million, which may be used in a variety of ways to <lb/>support the employment and vocational rehabilitation of people with disabilities: priorities are companies <lb/>for the disabled – refunds of their salaries and improving working process; finance for improving working <lb/>conditions of people with disabilities and production process are distributed according to calls for <lb/>proposals for assisting unemployed people with disabilities, improving working conditions, workplace <lb/>modifications, etc. In some cases this involves direct funding, in other cases transfers to other bodies like <lb/>the National Employment Service for them to conduct activities in support of people with disabilities. <lb/>There has been some criticism of the performance of vocational rehabilitation companies for the disabled, <lb/>and it would appear that this fund could be used in new and innovative ways – either to upgrade the <lb/>performance of the established vocational rehabilitation companies, or to explore whether other forms of <lb/>work integration social enterprise might innovatively address the employment and rehabilitation needs of <lb/>people with disabilities (e.g. WISEs). <lb/>Public Works Programme <lb/>These are a labour market measures providing employment subsidies to employers who take on <lb/>unemployed, disadvantaged people for short periods of time. They are available from the National <lb/>Employment Service on the basis of public tenders in order to carry out social, humanitarian, cultural and <lb/>other activities, maintenance and rehabilitation of public infrastructure, and maintenance and protection of <lb/>environment and nature. Approximately 6000 people took part in public works in 2011. Public works (with <lb/>funding typically for six months) represents an opportunity for social enterprise to gain finance for work <lb/>integration. <lb/></body>

			<body>Lottery Fund <lb/>The Law on Games of Chance (2004) has resulted in funds being raised for various social projects, <lb/>with (as noted above) five funding areas: disability, youth and sport, Red Cross, local municipalities (social <lb/>protection), and rare diseases. Since 2009 State Lottery of Serbia has been implementing the model of <lb/>engaging a non-profit organisation (Balkan Community Initiatives Fund – BCIF) for administration of its <lb/>funds devoted to supporting civil society initiatives. This model of co-operation ensures transparent and <lb/>accountable distribution of funds since it is done through open calls for proposals – in the last reported <lb/>open call (for Dobrota program) about 3.3 million dinars (EUR 28 000) was administered to nine projects. <lb/>This has also drawn on the lessons and practices of the Social Innovation Fund. <lb/>Lotteries can be a very important source of funding for good causes, and although dependent on <lb/>economic conditions, they are a growing market: revenue from gaming licences in Serbia for 2008 was <lb/>EUR 50 million, which was EUR 500 000 more than the previous year. There are different lottery models <lb/>(Hadzi-Miceva Evans, 2010) for generating and distributing funds for social purposes – one typology is <lb/>based on who decides how the funds are allocated: state distributed, distribution by another entity <lb/>(including non-profit organisations), by lottery operators, and distribution specified by law. In some <lb/>countries charities may use lotteries as fund-raising tools. The proportions going to good causes is variable <lb/>(for example, in the Czech Republic it varies between 6% and 20% of profits; in the UK it is 28%; whilst <lb/>in the Irish lottery it amounts to 32% – in 2011 it raised EUR 231.9 million (in the UK and Ireland the <lb/>lottery is operated under state licence by limited companies). An asset based model, based on the <lb/>endowment of a very large sum for social purposes, is outlined in the Box below. <lb/></body>

			<body>Box 8. The National Foundation for Civil Society Development, Croatia <lb/>The National Foundation for Civil Society Development (NFCSD) in Croatia was founded in 2003 with proceeds <lb/>from the Croatian lottery (founding assets were: HRK 2m (EUR 275 000) and by 2008 assets had reached HRK 46m <lb/>(EUR 6.3m), of which HRK 43m (EUR 5.9m) had come from games of chance). <lb/>Each year a governmental decree is issued which sets out the criteria for programmes to which 50% of the <lb/>process from games of chance are allocated. Of that 50%, 14.1% is allocated for the development of civil society with <lb/>the remainder distributed by ministries in areas including sport; social and humanitarian activities; meeting the needs of <lb/>people with disabilities; and, culture. <lb/>The NFCSD receives over 96% of the total funding allocated for the development of civil society and implements <lb/>activities as well as making grants. Multi-year institutional funding is also available. Associations, foundations, <lb/>institutions, local government units, and other organisations, in the areas of human rights, rule of law, non-institutional <lb/>education, environmental protection, and youth have all received funding. <lb/>A management body, appointed by the government and composed of members of the state administration, <lb/>local/regional government units, and organisations and experts in civil society, is responsible for the decision-making <lb/>processes. <lb/>Source : Hadzi-Miceva Evans (2010) <lb/>Development Fund <lb/>This is the main source of state funded credit for businesses and new business start-ups, including <lb/>small entrepreneurs and crafts shops. Besides its own funds which operate within budgetary constraints, it <lb/>also acts as a channel for funds from particular ministries; and works with National Agency for Regional <lb/>Development and regional development agencies supporting start-ups. It provides credit over a range of <lb/>periods at attractive interest rates; it also supports less-developed areas through for example credits for the <lb/>unemployed and micro-credits. Social enterprises can also apply for these programmes. <lb/>Social Innovation Fund <lb/>With joint financing from donors and the Republic of Serbia budget, the Social Innovation Fund was <lb/>established in 2003. It was based within the Ministry of Labour, Employment and Social Policy, but many <lb/>donors were also actively involved in various forms of assistance. During its life, the Social Innovation <lb/>Fund supported just under 300 projects in over 100 municipalities, from its accumulated funds of EUR 7 <lb/>million. Its main innovation was developing a funding mechanism (via tenders) to encourage a plurality of <lb/>service providers, with the aim of welfare service reform -reduce disadvantage and broadening choices for <lb/>service users. The aim was also use this project funding to help develop sustainable social services funded <lb/>by municipalities (Golicin and Ognjanov, 2010). The Social Innovation Fund has provided some <lb/>inspiration for the functioning of the Lottery Fund. There are some suggestions that it could be a model for <lb/>a new Social Inclusion Fund – rather like a national version of the European Social Fund – focusing on <lb/>beneficiaries, and governed by an inter-ministerial body. <lb/>The development of innovative forms of social finance is a key area in supporting social <lb/>entrepreneurship; and there is great potential for rethinking existing models in a particular country, by <lb/>drawing on international best practices. The discussion above about different lottery models reveals a wide <lb/>range of possibilities, and there follows another interesting example of social finance. <lb/></body>

			<body>Box 9. Innovative Funding Arrangements for Social Enterprises <lb/>Big Society Capital: a social investment bank. <lb/>This was established with government funding of GBP 400 million together with GBP 200 million from several of <lb/>the big banks in the UK. The government funding came from unclaimed assets – basically bank accounts that had <lb/>become dormant. It was only launched in 2012, so the range of products and services it offers is still under <lb/>development, but it aims to help develop the social investment market by providing finance in the form of loans, equity <lb/>and quasi-equity. It will not lend directly to social enterprise, rather through &quot; social investment financial intermediaries &quot; <lb/>which may be social banks, non-bank social investors, or support providing organisations. <lb/>Bridges Ventures: a commercial model with social mission <lb/>Bridges Ventures began its operation as a private sector company, but received 50% of its GBP 50million starting <lb/>capital coming from UK government. This support was due to Bridges social and environmental mission, which is <lb/>based on the idea that there are market failures in various aspects of conventional finance, for example in less <lb/>developed regions, and with less conventional enterprises, like social enterprise. It operates as a venture capital fund, <lb/>thus if it wants to grow its portfolio of investments it has to continue to raise finance from capital markets – it has <lb/>subsequently raised an additional GBP 75m for a second fund, and has invested GBP 55m in 36 companies across <lb/>both funds. It also has to exit from its investments after they have achieved sustainable growth. This philosophy of <lb/>attempting to use capital markets to support the development of social enterprises is more prominent in Anglo-Saxon <lb/>countries, and it is relatively new, so needs further evaluation, but Bridges appears to have achieved some real social <lb/>and economic successes: <lb/>For example SimplySwitch which promoted switching to renewable energy (subsequently sold to The Daily Mail <lb/>and General Trust plc) proved a very successful social and economic investment. It provided 80 jobs, the majority <lb/>being women and ethnic minorities, and 60% of these had been unemployed; the company has raised over GBP 0.5m <lb/>for charity partners. <lb/>Source : http://www.open.ac.uk/oubs/socialinvestmentseminars/p5_4.shtml <lb/>Potential Growth of EU Funding <lb/>With the path to EU accession by Serbia now approved, more finance should become available from <lb/>different EU funding streams, these include: <lb/>Instrument for Pre-Accession – IPA assistance has five themes: support for transition and institution <lb/>building, cross-border co-operation, regional development, human resource development, and rural <lb/>development. EU financial support under this instrument was around EUR 198 million for 2010, EUR 202 <lb/>million for 2011, EUR 202 million for 2012, rising to EUR 215million for 2013 (European Commission, <lb/>2012). <lb/>European Investment Bank – the EIB is the long-term lending bank of the EU, with these priorities: <lb/>cohesion and convergence; support for SMEs; environmental sustainability; implementation of innovation <lb/>2010 initiative; development of trans-European networks in transport and energy; and, sustainable <lb/>competitive and secure energy. Part of their programme of support includes (jointly with the European <lb/>Commission) JEREMIE which targets micro to medium-sized enterprises particularly financial support, for <lb/>start-ups, technology and innovation, microcredit, etc. The EIB operates in the Western Balkans, especially <lb/>through the Western Balkans Investment Framework. <lb/>European Bank for Reconstruction and Development – the EBRD aims at developing transitions to an open <lb/>democratic market economy, primarily focused on the private sector, aiming to fill gaps in the market for <lb/>finance; it is open to social enterprise projects. Similarly the Council of Europe Development Bank (CEB: <lb/></body>

			<page>55 <lb/></page>

This programme is open to candidate countries and Serbia has very good record in using <lb/>this programme. [Note that only intermediaries in EU-27 Member States are eligible to apply for support <lb/>under the European Progress Microfinance Facility.] <lb/>Lifelong learning – this includes Comenius for schools, Erasmus for higher education, Leonardo da Vinci <lb/>for vocational training, and Grundtvig for adult education; partnerships should be across several countries <lb/>and involve co-operation, networks, information exchange, and training; this has proved an important <lb/>source of funding for social economy organisations in the past, particularly Leonardo for development of <lb/>training programmes. The main programme for accession countries to access is the TEMPUS programme <lb/>which is specifically for modernising higher education in countries outside the EU including the Western <lb/>Balkans. But there are elements of the other programmes (such as Erasmus Mundus for example to develop <lb/>joint masters courses). These programmes could be basis for developing a range of educational and <lb/>training provision, for example a Slovenia business school developed a training course for social <lb/>entrepreneurs through Leonardo. <lb/>Competitiveness and Innovation Framework programme (CIP) – this is available for innovation in <lb/>enterprises, IT and energy; there are three sub programmes: entrepreneurship and innovation (including <lb/>access to finance, innovation and entrepreneurship culture); ICT support; and sustainable development <lb/>regarding energy. Projects should involve several partner countries, and social enterprises can apply, <lb/>although there appears to be a strong emphasis on science and technology rather than broader <lb/>conceptualisations of innovation. Serbia is already participating in the Entrepreneurship and Innovation <lb/>Programme (EIP), as well as the ICT Policy Support Programme (ICT-PSP). <lb/>European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) – this is a large programme aimed at improving <lb/>entrepreneurship, innovation and competitiveness of SMEs, and reduced regional disparities; it should be <lb/>available to social enterprise, but is currently only available to EU27. The Rural Development Fund – this <lb/>is aimed at improving competitiveness for farming and forestry, improving the environment, and <lb/>diversification of the rural economy; it also includes LEADER programme which can provide small-scale <lb/>grants to farmers and rural businesses and community organisations – thus should be readily accessible to <lb/>rural social enterprise. Not currently available to accession countries. <lb/>The European Social Fund – the ESF is well known as a source of funds for social economy aimed at <lb/>developing a skilled and adaptable workforce. But the EQUAL Community Initiative (funded by ESF and <lb/>Member States) could serve as a useful model since it supported innovative, transnational projects aimed at <lb/>tackling discrimination and disadvantage in the labour market, including a theme on &quot; inclusive <lb/>entrepreneurship &quot; , <lb/>for <lb/>an <lb/>evaluation, <lb/>see: <lb/>http://ec.europa.eu/employment_social/equal_consolidated/about/evaluation.html. Not currently available <lb/>to candidate countries. <lb/>Business Angels <lb/>These are individuals with funds and know-how who wish to invest in early-stage businesses to <lb/>support their growth. In Serbia, they may not be well developed since a recent government report on <lb/>SMEs found no evidence of them.

			<body>investment have been developed elsewhere, for example MyC4 in Denmark for investment in African <lb/>projects and SMEs. In a similar vein, some countries have engaged celebrities both in promoting social <lb/>enterprise, but also investing in the sector – one example is the UK chef, Jamie Oliver, and his group of <lb/> &quot; 15 &quot; restaurants for training disadvantaged people in the catering business. <lb/>There is no surprise in noting that the Serbian financial framework of SME and social enterprise <lb/>development is lacking in a number of important respects. This includes addressing the conservative <lb/>attitude of the banks and the fact that only banks can lend money and improving the possibilities for micro-<lb/>finance; a number of government funds could be reoriented toward social enterprise. The trend towards the <lb/>withdrawal of international donors is compensated, to a certain extent, with EU funds gradually being <lb/>opened up; but both these are oriented towards project funding, which valuable though it is, is no substitute <lb/>for a comprehensive framework that supports the financial needs of social entrepreneurs (and SME <lb/>entrepreneurs) during start-up development and growth of their social enterprises. <lb/>Skills <lb/>Skills development was mentioned on many occasions to the OECD team as a key issue for the <lb/>development of social entrepreneurship in Serbia. In this respect the social enterprise sector shares many <lb/>common features with the SME sector, since it is also recognised that lack of skills is a key problem in the <lb/>SME sector in Serbia. A recent report states the main development problems of SMEs include: <lb/>insufficient knowledge and skills of entrepreneurs and employees – lack of human resources of <lb/>certain skills, as well as insufficient management skills for solving strategic and operational <lb/>problems in order to maintain continuity in business [and] insufficient promotion of skills <lb/>development in companies – management skills, R&amp;D skills, and skills related to export through <lb/>appropriate training (Ministry of Finance and Economy and National Agency for Regional <lb/>Development, 2011). <lb/>It is important to differentiate between the different categories of skills required in relation to aspects <lb/>of social entrepreneurship: <lb/> skills for social inclusion (and other sector related skills – for example in community <lb/>development, and welfare services); <lb/> skills for entrepreneurship and management (marketing and finance in particular, and business <lb/>planning and development); these include skills for growth and scaling (capacity building); <lb/> skills for meeting regulatory, reporting requirements and negotiating with bureaucracies; and, <lb/> skills for the development of social enterprise (development workers). <lb/>Note that skills development includes building capacity of administrative officials through communication, <lb/>education, and training, which is discussed under the infrastructure theme. <lb/></body>

Capacity Building for Emerging Social Enterprise Networks: ESENSEE (Eco Social Economy Network <lb/>South and East Europe) <lb/>The ESENSEE project was launched at the start of 2011 with financial support from the European Union and a <lb/>project base in Croatia. It is a network consisting of organisations and networks in East Europe, as well as in southern <lb/>European countries, including Italy. Members of the network share a common aim of encouraging creative, <lb/>enterprising and responsible action towards sustainable development. The network is committed to the &quot; eco-social <lb/>economy &quot; and to developing the capacity of the civic sector in society. The working method entails co-operation and <lb/>exchange at local, national and European levels and it welcomes partnership with public, private and civic <lb/>organisations to further its work. <lb/>ESENSEE&apos;s focus includes: reducing employment and poverty, developing social entrepreneurship and eco <lb/>businesses, encouraging social enterprises and co-operatives, and fostering education on eco issues. It undertakes its <lb/>work mainly through networking and capacity building. These activities target civil society organisations and individual <lb/>entrepreneurs. In particular it is seeking the formation of co-operative clusters and pilot projects as well as the <lb/>establishment of a creative academy to train and develop future generations of social entrepreneurs. <lb/>The steering committee members include representatives from those working in areas concerned with: civil society <lb/>development, art and eco-social economy (Croatia), training and sustainable development (Macedonia), dignity of <lb/>disabled people (Kosovo), social entrepreneurship, creative design and development (Croatia), migrants and youth <lb/>(Serbia), European co-operatives (Italy). A Healthy City Initiative (Croatia) is also a partner in addition to one associate <lb/>(United Nations Development Programme). <lb/>Source : http://www.esensee.org/project.php?l=fr <lb/>Social Inclusion Skills <lb/>Skills development for disadvantaged people to gain social inclusion has to address a number of areas: <lb/>from life skills and social skills to work skills, including skills to support entry into the labour market <lb/>(CVs, job applications, interview practice, job searching, etc.) The OECD team visited a women&apos;s centre in <lb/>Novi Sad and heard about the project Iz Kruga (Out of Circle) to support women with disabilities; the <lb/>programme covered employment, health, legal rights, awareness/confidence and work skills and involved <lb/>individual and group work, as well as mentor support. A visit by the OECD team to the Milan Petrovic <lb/>School provided a highly impressive example of good practices for skills development amongst wide range <lb/>of age groups of people with disabilities, from very young to adult. It would be wonderful to imagine that <lb/>such provision could be replicated across Serbia, but given the budgetary constraints this is likely to remain <lb/>an aspirational example for many. <lb/>But social inclusion is just one of the areas of social enterprise operates within, and there are many <lb/>ways that need to be employed in order to address social inclusion. Thus, a large area of social inclusion <lb/>activity is associated with working with individuals on employability and integration into the labour <lb/>market. However, social inclusion also involves working with disadvantaged communities and here there is <lb/>a need for skill sets for community work and community development. Similarly, in welfare services there <lb/>are a specific skill sets associated with providing services to disabled, children, and elderly clients. There <lb/>are important quality standards that have to be met in welfare services. For specific sectors where social <lb/>enterprise have a strong current or potential presence, there is scope for skills development and training <lb/>programs. <lb/>In Serbia, training provision in this area relies to a large extent on current labour market policy for <lb/>people with disabilities where there is a regular level of provision; but for people with disadvantages <lb/>training provision relies on National Employment Service funding, and project-based funding via the <lb/>Public Works Programme. The new, 2011 Law on Social Protection has a training element for activation <lb/></body>

Elder Services by Social Enterprise: Sunderland Homecare Care Associates Ltd and the Sister <lb/>Organisation: CASA Ltd Social Franchise <lb/>Sunderland Homecare Care Associates (Sunderland, UK) began in its current form in 1994 but has roots in a <lb/>previous not-for-profit organisation, The Little Women Co-op, founded in 1976. It is an employee-owned social <lb/>enterprise which offers care services to elderly, disabled or mental health sufferers in their own home. The service <lb/>strives to deliver high quality support which respects the independence of individuals receiving care. It can help with <lb/>shopping, washing and bathing, preparing meals and household jobs. Students with disabilities at a local university <lb/>who need support can also use the service. It delivers contract to local authorities and can provide packages of <lb/>support through the Direct Payments and Individual Budgets provisions available to local councils as part of current UK <lb/>policy relating to people with care needs. <lb/>It had a turnover in 2011 of over GBP 3.5 million, and is owned by over 300 staff employed in the company. The <lb/>democratic ownership structure means the employees, who co-own the company, can vote for the managing board of <lb/>directors <lb/>Sunderland Homecare Care Associates is a sister organisation to the social franchise, Care and Share <lb/>Associates Ltd (CASA), a limited company formed in 2004 and based in Stanley, Durham (UK) which oversees a <lb/>group of six employee owned health and social care organisations around the north of England. CASA is built on the <lb/>Sunderland model and aims to deliver high quality care with fully trained staff. It seeks to work in close collaboration <lb/>with the public sector while competing strongly with the private sector for contracts to deliver care services. CASA is <lb/>managed by a six person board highly experienced in the care and health field. It works closely with the six franchise <lb/>organisations, has at least one person on each of their boards and owns 26% of the shares in each of them. The <lb/>remaining proportion of the shares is held in Employee Benefit Trusts. CASA, like Sunderland Care Homes and the six <lb/>franchises are all employee-owned businesses – the employees jointly own the business and there are no external <lb/>shareholders. CASA is backed financially by Bridges Ventures – a private investment firm owned by its directors and <lb/>the Bridges Charitable Trust – which has specialised in investments and advice to social and environmental <lb/>organisations for over 10 years. <lb/>Source: Sunderland Homecare Care Associates: http://www.sunderlandhomecare.co.uk/about.html <lb/>Care and Share Associates (franchise): http://www.casaltd.com/ <lb/>Lidija Mavra (2011) Growing social franchising, London, Social Enterprise UK: <lb/>http://www.socialenterprise.org.uk/uploads/files/2011/12/growing_social_enterprise_report1.pdf <lb/>Skills for Entrepreneurship and Management <lb/>It was frequently reported to the OECD team that there was a managerial skills deficit among social <lb/>enterprise and that marketing, financial, and management skills (training) were particularly important for <lb/>social enterprise. In relation to those organisations funded through the Lottery Fund the issue of skills <lb/>development to improve performance was emphasised. Many international donors also focused on skills <lb/>development, both in the above areas as well as skills for entrepreneurship, which is for starting a social <lb/>business. As one person commented &quot; poor business planning skills on the part of social entrepreneurs is <lb/>the key issue &quot; . An orientation to business may not come naturally to people who strongly want to address <lb/>social change and it is interesting that successful social enterprise often emphasise the crucial feature of <lb/>developing professional management e.g. by employing a business manager. <lb/>In the difficult context of raising finance for social enterprise, skills for business planning and fund-<lb/>raising are particularly important. Capacity building is required for business skills to achieve sustainable <lb/>social enterprise; as well as skills for growth and scaling. As someone commented to the OECD team: <lb/></body>

			<page>59 <lb/></page>

			<body> &quot; business skills, and lack thereof, marketing, budgeting are the main problems for social enterprise &quot; with <lb/>another comment, from an international donor organisation noting that: &quot; &apos;skills for social entrepreneurship&apos; <lb/>is a very important area of activity – and one with real impact potential. &quot; Skills for quality control are also <lb/>important, particularly in public contracting, and where the engagement of local people in the delivery of <lb/>municipal services is required. <lb/>There are also attitudinal problems to do with a lack of entrepreneurship spirit or culture which could <lb/>be addressed partly through training. It is noteworthy that in the SME sector human resource development <lb/>includes policies for lifelong entrepreneurial education – involving primary and secondary and vocational <lb/>schools, and universities, and this continues with support for associations of entrepreneurs. <lb/>It is also important to recognise that social enterprise need skills associated with the social dimension <lb/>of the operation. This includes understanding governance often in a multi-stakeholder context and strategic <lb/>skills for social/community and economic performance. But it also useful to remember that these skills set <lb/>should be distributed among key actors in the social enterprise. <lb/>In Serbia the provision in this area has three main strands of support: firstly the access of social <lb/>entrepreneurs to the support for SMEs and the self-employed, as noted above (in the section on <lb/>institutional capabilities); secondly, an important area of provision is that of international donor <lb/>organisations; and, thirdly, a growing use of EU programmes could also play an important and growing <lb/>role here. In addition, a parallel development of social entrepreneurship training could find a place at <lb/>several levels within the education and training system. Finally, one well established approach to <lb/>supporting skills development is through business incubators, as in the Box 12. <lb/></body>

			<page>60 <lb/></page>

			<body>Box 12. Incubators: Urban N.O.S.E (Network of Social Enterprises) <lb/>URBAN N.O.S.E (the URBAN Network of Social Enterprises) was funded as part of the URBACT II European <lb/>Union learning and exchange programme aimed at sustainable urban development. The URBAN N.O.S.E project <lb/>involved co-operation between social enterprises and their partners in nine European cities in order to exchange good <lb/>practices in relation to developing economic sustainability. A particular feature was to understand models of best <lb/>practice for incubators – tools, structures or institutional processes -which could support social enterprise development <lb/>in different country contexts. URBAN N.O.S.E was a two year project which produced its conclusions – drawn from <lb/>Cyprus, Finland, France, Greece, Italy, Portugal, Spain and the UK – in a report published in May 2011. <lb/>Some examples of social enterprise incubators discussed in depth include MCAE (Grenoble, France), an <lb/>association financed primarily from a mixture of public bodies which offers advice, diagnosis, training and start-up <lb/>loans to social enterprises – particularly those seeking to offer jobs to disadvantaged people. D.Y.E.K.O. (Koropi, <lb/>Greece) provides a virtual service and represents the first specialist incubator of social enterprise in Greece, where the <lb/>idea is not well known there. Its work with women social entrepreneurs has been positive although the target group <lb/>(unemployed people) may not always have access to suitable computers. A &quot; More than Profit &quot; network of social <lb/>enterprises (Brighton and Hove, UK) provides another model where a partnership between the public, private, and the <lb/>social economy sectors seeks to provide practical advice, training, networking and to develop supportive local policy <lb/>aimed at developing social enterprises. A &quot; House of Voluntary Service &quot; called CESVOP (Gela, Italy) provides a <lb/>physical location for social economy organisations linked to advice and consultancy. <lb/>The cross-networking of case studies and experiences and knowledge transfer about incubator structures across <lb/>nations was itself an important part of the project. The conclusions suggests that there are lessons for cities engaging <lb/>in setting up social enterprise incubators (for example, on governance, partners, promoting advice and financing <lb/>structures, and involving all sectors) as well as for decision makers (such as on creating a legal framework for <lb/>incubators, decentralised funding support, investment in local &apos;micro&apos; finance packages, and supporting both start-up <lb/>as well as spin-off enterprises). <lb/>Source: Urban N.O.S.E.: programme overview: <lb/>http://urbact.eu/en/projects/human-capital-entrepreneurship/urban-nose/our-project/ <lb/>http://urbact.eu/fileadmin/Projects/Urban_N_O_S_E_/outputs_media/Case_Studies_Compendium_Urban_N.O.S.E..pdf <lb/>Skills for Meeting Regulatory, Reporting Requirements and Negotiating with Bureaucracy <lb/>Clearly business skills and capacity building are vital for social enterprise. But since social enterprise <lb/>often have to operate simultaneously in a number of fields (product/service market, financial market, soft <lb/>money market), and negotiate some state support they often need the skills and capacity to deal with <lb/>bureaucracy and with reporting requirements. Social enterprises are often called on to assess the impact <lb/>and value of work done and report on it to stakeholders and the public, including triple bottom line <lb/>reporting. In discussions with the OECD team about the area of micro-credit, it was mentioned that <lb/>compliance with the law would require skills training to meet the standards. It is noteworthy that, as in the <lb/>SME sector, developing a quality approach and meeting quality standards is an important area that needs <lb/>addressing, and there are substantial regional disparities. <lb/>At the moment in Serbia this is not a high priority area until more state contracting takes place and the <lb/>micro-credit regime is liberalised; provision could come from international donor organisations, although <lb/>their supply of resources is declining. <lb/>Skills for the development of social enterprise (development workers) <lb/>When it comes to developing appropriate business support for social enterprise, building the <lb/>competencies of a network of trainers and development workers is just as important as developing skills <lb/></body>

			<body>within the social enterprise. Much of this currently takes place through informal learning in the networks of <lb/>groups supporting social entrepreneurship. <lb/>And if training social enterprise is to be accessed via the SME system of business support, then <lb/>consideration needs to be given to programmes for training these potential trainers. <lb/>Access to Markets <lb/>This section is focused largely on public procurement markets and the level of access by social <lb/>enterprise to projects in the tendering system, as well as more regular formal contracts for delivery of <lb/>public/welfare services. It also considers the extent of use of social clauses in procurement in Serbia and <lb/>internationally. Finally, it considers other relevant markets such as ethical consumer markets, markets for <lb/>donations and legacies, and the CSR market. <lb/>In relation to complying with EU guidelines 9 it is vital that public bodies carefully specify the criteria <lb/>for awarding a contract in the tender specification, in order to measure the social or public benefit which <lb/>the contract requires (BEST Procurement Development Partnership, 2007). <lb/>The European Commission&apos;s Buying Social: A Guide to Taking Account of Social Considerations in <lb/>Public Procurement provides guidelines on how public procurement can be used to meet social goals. <lb/>Whilst in general &quot; reserving &quot; public procurement contracts for specific organisational forms, such as social <lb/>enterprises, is not allowed, so securing a protected market for sheltered workshops employing disabled or <lb/>disadvantaged people would not be possible. However, it is possible to specify conditions like <lb/> &quot; employment of 30% disadvantaged &quot; and avoid conditions which act as impediments to social enterprise, <lb/>such as capital requirements, so that social enterprise have a good chance of demonstrating their ability to <lb/>win public procurement contracts. In Sweden, the Swedish Social Insurance Agency, has involved social <lb/>economy organisations, voluntary organisations and SMEs in their initial studies for procurement, and in <lb/>this way they have both helped orient social enterprise to this public market and facilitated the <lb/>identification of specific problems/hindrances they may face in preparing tender documents <lb/>(http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=IP/11/105). <lb/>At the same time, public procurement which specifically seeks to meet local social and economic <lb/>goals, such as integration and inclusion, quality employment, etc. can also benefit social enterprises who <lb/>are working with disadvantaged and vulnerable groups, such as through work integration activities. <lb/>Box 13. Social Clauses in Public Procurement: France <lb/>In France, there are some 250,000 public tenders with around two-thirds of them, worth EUR 115 billion, by local <lb/>authorities. In 2003 the French &quot; public markets code &quot; was amended, in line with EU requirements, in order to enhance <lb/>transparency and enable all firms to participate equally in tendering for contracts. Article 14 of the code focuses on <lb/>integration and employment issues: the code makes it possible for contracts to detail a process of integration, rather <lb/>than a specific type of enterprise. Authorities can decide on a percentage of disadvantage people who should be <lb/>employed by a contractor (although this should not be at a point where competition is not possible). For service <lb/>contracts, a figure of 40% would allow work integration social enterprises to participate. Furthermore, there is the <lb/>potential to use such percentages as a way of encouraging closer relationships between social enterprises and the <lb/>private sector. For example, a figure of 10% appears reasonable for works contracts and this could come from a <lb/>partnership between a conventional firm and a work integration social enterprise. <lb/></body>

			<body>Some general contextual factors were noted above in relation to this issue: for example governance <lb/>(vertical integration of policy at the local level), and communication/education about policy frameworks to <lb/>local officials; with the result that opportunities may be varied in different municipalities. Similarly, the <lb/>emerging mixed economy of welfare provision is currently dominated by state providers, with only a few <lb/>opportunities for social enterprise. The tendering system for projects generally offers opportunities for <lb/>short-term service provision, whereas the challenge is to find alternative sources for sustainable provision – <lb/>one option is protected markets, such as that used in Taiwan (Box 14). <lb/>Box 14. Use of Protected Markets (Taiwan) <lb/>An important model for social enterprise has been developed in Taiwan, where the government grants NPOs <lb/>(non-profit organisations) the right to operate in protected markets, by providing the space and facilities. <lb/>NPOs engage in commercial activities by means of outsourcing contracts such as, for instance, the coffee shop <lb/>of the Taipei and Kaohsiung government. Taipei government&apos;s Enjoy Coffee was formerly run by the Children Are Us <lb/>Foundation and subsequently by the Taipei Victory Centre for Enhancing the Potential of the Disabled People. The <lb/>Kaohsiung government&apos;s Smile Coffee is now operated by the Children Are Us Foundation. As well, the government <lb/>also periodically allocates public space to NPOs for their commercial undertakings. The best examples in this case are <lb/>the gasoline stations entrusted to NPOs by the Taipei government. The land was formerly controlled by the Labour <lb/>Bureau of Taipei and the gasoline stations were operated by China National Petroleum. With the aim to increase <lb/>employment opportunities for disabled people, China National Petroleum donated the facilities and the government <lb/>opened these to public bidding in 2002. Seven NPO welfare agencies submitted 11 working plans. In the end, it was <lb/>the Sunshine Social Welfare Foundation and the Syinlu Social Welfare Foundation that acquired rights to the gasoline <lb/>stations for three years. Eighty percent of the entire staff must be disabled. In the past, disabled people had to engage <lb/>in physical labour with low added-value jobs including cleaning, washing cars, transporting heavy loads, etc. &quot; <lb/>Source: Kuan and Wang (2009) <lb/>The 2008 2 Law on Public Procurement provides a framework for considering competitive bids in <lb/>public procurement markets; and it gives some priority to local providers in competition with foreign <lb/>providers. Article 8 opens the possibility for the public body to define additional conditions relating to <lb/>social and environmental criteria, but it seems this has not yet been explored, although it could offer some <lb/>priority to social enterprises (and the new draft law could enhance this possibility). It should be noted that <lb/>this should not privilege an organisational form, but rather it needs to recognise the qualities and <lb/>experience in delivering social/environmental performance and thus provide a procurement niche/quota for <lb/>social enterprises. Internationally, there is some experience of how to specify such social clauses to make <lb/>them readily accessible to social enterprises. <lb/></body>

			<note place="footnote">2 Note that a draft public procurement law was being discussed during 2012, which hopefully would address these <lb/>deficiencies in the 2008 law. <lb/></note>

			<body>Box 15. Niche Strategies in Public Procurement: Brisbane City Council Procurement Process <lb/>The public procurement policies of Brisbane City Council in Queensland, Australia, have given high priority to <lb/>developing social procurement clauses. This was consistent with its stated aspirations to build the local economy by <lb/>actively seeking service providers from the community and social enterprise sector. The policy also sought to increase <lb/>the Council&apos;s knowledge and database of information about local groups and to build social enterprises&apos; capacity to <lb/>improve their performance. Overall, the policy recognised the need to prioritise and support the sector to enable it to <lb/>realise its potential. <lb/>The Annual Procurement Policy and Contracting Plan for 2011/12 emphasised in the first of six overall objectives <lb/>for procurement &quot; a commitment to advancing the social needs and requirements of Brisbane communities to advance <lb/>the quality of life for all. &quot; This was followed up in detail in schedule (D) where &quot; social procurement objectives &quot; were set <lb/>out. This entailed a commitment to: (a) maintaining the existing size of council spend with social enterprises; (b) <lb/>increasing the number of social enterprise suppliers to the council; and, (c) working to increase the awareness of other <lb/>public and private sector organisations about contracting with social enterprises. A target was set whereby certain <lb/>services would be reserved purely for social enterprise contractors by conducting a &quot; social enterprise only procurement <lb/>exercise in which social enterprises compete to provide services &quot; . <lb/>In addition, the Council has taken steps to separate out some components of larger contracts so that there is <lb/>scope for smaller elements to be offered, by means of a special &quot; memorandum of understanding &quot; to social enterprises <lb/>which employ people disadvantaged in the labour market. Once established in this way these organisations can bid for <lb/>the contracts reserved for social enterprises. This offers a development ladder which, it is anticipated, could enable <lb/>social enterprises to gradually bid for larger contracts for the benefit of the local economy and disadvantaged groups. <lb/>Brisbane is a city with an estimated population of just under 1 080 000 people in 2011, the Council has had a <lb/>Community Engagement Policy since 2008 seeking high levels of public participation. It is governed by 27 elected <lb/>councillors and an elected mayor and had an annual budget of AUD 2.92 billion in 2011/12. <lb/></body>

But at least two interesting experiences were reported to the OECD team: the <lb/>elderly-focused service of Meals on Wheels in Belgrade, and the innovative waste recycling co-operative <lb/>SWIFT (using Roma employees) which has yet to achieve full sustainability. However, some risks <lb/>associated with a procurement regime with social clauses were also indicated: &quot; this is Serbia … the <lb/>likelihood of misuse of law is high, legal frameworks can be great, implementation is a different thing..! &quot; . <lb/>Some current Serbian social enterprises are operating in ethical consumer markets, for example Eco-<lb/>Bag. These markets depend on middle-class consumers, and thus are not subject to the difficulties outlined <lb/>above with regard to procurement markets. However, they have their own challenges; quality and design <lb/>are particularly important, as well as links with ethical and environmental movements which can assist <lb/>communication and distribution issues (as was the case in the early days of fair trade). Nonetheless this <lb/>segment of the market is potentially growing and social enterprises are uniquely well-suited to compete in <lb/>it. <lb/></note>

			<body>In many countries non-profit organisations, and social enterprise, are highly active in markets for <lb/>donations and legacies. In some cases this is facilitated through a sympathetic fiscal regime. In Serbia the <lb/>law gives certain exemptions on the payment of income tax for expenditures on health care, education, <lb/>science, humanitarian purposes, religious, environmental protection and sports: the amounts exempted is <lb/>3.5%. In addition value added tax is not payable on donated goods imported for humanitarian assistance. <lb/>Donations and legacies could be a substantial source of income for larger charities and social enterprise – <lb/>particularly those able to promote a brand. Systems of web based donations have proved very effective for <lb/>smaller and medium-sized charities. <lb/>Other Private Markets <lb/>Funds from diaspora Serbs are a potential source of income for SMEs and could be the basis for <lb/>funding welfare services for elderly family members. More generally the repatriation of diaspora funds to <lb/>family and own business interests has been an important driver of economic development, and social <lb/>entrepreneurship can play an important role in enhancing the possibilities for this (Box 16). <lb/>Box 16. Diaspora Involvement Through NGOs and Social Enterprises <lb/>With globalisation, there has been an increasing recognition of the importance of engaging with, and supporting, <lb/>the contribution of diasporas to their country of origin. In Africa for example in 2010 migrants sent home an estimated <lb/>UDS 40 billion in remittances. Such remittances might go to purchase of agricultural equipment, enhancing a domestic <lb/>property or investing in entrepreneurship or education. These remittances may be stable and even countercyclical – <lb/>with more finance being returned at difficult times. <lb/>Policy makers used to focus on the loss of skills, but now regard it as providing opportunities for developing trade <lb/>and investment projects and acquiring new knowledge. <lb/>Most contributions of a diaspora are financial – in the form of remittances, donations, bonds (appealing to a <lb/>sense of patriotism), and various forms of business investments (including venture capital). But knowledge networks <lb/>are also important, and so are international educational exchanges -note that a major spin-off of Asian students <lb/>studying business and technology in California has been new east-west patterns of entrepreneurship, leading in some <lb/>cases to the development of major international multi-nationals. <lb/>In Israel much of this activity is supported by NGOs (in home country and overseas), but the government <lb/>facilitates developments by approving and validating programmes. There have even been Israeli venture capital funds <lb/>set up for high-tech entrepreneurship, which have proved very successful. <lb/>Another NGO example is Afford-UK (Africa Foundation for Development) which is based in London, United <lb/>Kingdom, with a mission to support and promote the capacity of the African diaspora to contribute to development in <lb/>that continent. It was established in 1994 by Africans living in the UK and has a particular focus on the creation of <lb/>small, micro and medium sized enterprises to create employment for young people in central African states. Part of <lb/>their programme has included projects to support remittances for employment creation. <lb/>Source : http://www.remitplus.org/; http://www.afford-uk.org/index.php; Aikins et al. (2009). <lb/>Another relevant market is that for corporate social responsibility, either through the development of <lb/>projects or of social enterprise (see the earlier mention of the National Strategy for Development and <lb/>Promotion on Corporate Social Responsibility 2010-2015). This is an opportunity that social entrepreneurs <lb/>already recognise, but one where there is scope for influencing multinationals in local markets to take their <lb/>social responsibilities more seriously. Corporate social responsibility generally represents a market worth <lb/>targeting for social enterprise, with substantial evidence of successes internationally. For example the <lb/>Royal Bank of Scotland Group established and invested GBP 5 million into the RBSG Micro-finance <lb/>Fund, an independent charity, which has launched a GBP 5 million Community Business Loan Fund for <lb/></body>

			<body>social enterprises and community organisations, because such organisations often have difficulty accessing <lb/>business finance. <lb/>Summary <lb/>Sustainable social entrepreneurship requires good access to adequate financial resources adapted to <lb/>the needs of social enterprise both at start up and for growth. In Serbia conventional funds (banks) are <lb/>conservative and risk averse for SME funding, and more so for social enterprise. There are some <lb/>government funds available but generally they are limited, sometimes specific (such as to companies for <lb/>the disables), and temporary (based on competitive calls). A key area for assisting disadvantaged <lb/>individuals and communities is micro-finance and credit unions both of which face considerable problems <lb/>in Serbia currently. Development of social entrepreneurial skills is recognized as a key problem in Serbia; <lb/>there is some provision but it is insufficient and not properly tailored to the needs of social <lb/>entrepreneurship, for example through &quot; braided &quot; provision; EU funding will be a major resource in this <lb/>area, taking over from international donors who are already withdrawing. Finally, due to their values and <lb/>added value social enterprise could play an increasingly useful role in public service delivery. Currently <lb/>their access to public procurement markets is ad-hoc, temporary and partial. Social clauses could be used <lb/>to support a niche strategy which would give possibilities of sustainability and growth of social enterprise <lb/>public service providers. <lb/></body>

			<body>SWOT ANALYSIS OF SERBIAN SITUATION <lb/>Acknowledging the challenges which exist in Serbia with regard to the significant presence of an <lb/>informal economy, low levels of employment and high levels of long-term unemployment and youth <lb/>unemployment, the difficulties which disadvantaged groups, including Roma, people with disabilities, <lb/>refugees and internally displaced persons and the need for greater transparency and accountability, the <lb/>following provides an overview of the strengths and weaknesses, opportunities and threats relevant to the <lb/>development of social entrepreneurship in Serbia. <lb/>Strengths <lb/>Weaknesses <lb/> favourable framework supporting the employment of <lb/>people with disabilities; <lb/> EU accession recently approved, thereby opening <lb/>access to various programmes for financial support; <lb/> donor <lb/>strategies <lb/>firmly <lb/>supporting <lb/>social <lb/>entrepreneurship; <lb/> EU policy firmly supporting social enterprise and the <lb/>social economy; <lb/> capable and energetic new groups/networks <lb/>supporting social entrepreneurship (albeit emerging); <lb/> recent modernisation of legislation and policy <lb/>relevant to social entrepreneurship (associations, <lb/>foundations, etc). <lb/> various government bodies supportive of social <lb/>entrepreneurship; <lb/> some government funds accessible to social <lb/>enterprise; <lb/> some innovative and successful social enterprise <lb/>models <lb/> conservative attitude of the banks, and barriers to <lb/>micro-finance; <lb/> lack of comprehensive framework for financial and <lb/>support needs of social entrepreneurs during start-<lb/>up, development, and growth of their social <lb/>enterprises; <lb/> heritage of distrust and state dependency; <lb/> continuing emphasis on state provision at a time of <lb/>severe budgetary constraints; that is, it is difficult to <lb/>progress towards a mixed economy of public service <lb/>provision and thus there are limited opportunities for <lb/>procurement; <lb/> some evidence that the bankruptcy laws are not <lb/>conducive to taking entrepreneurial risks; <lb/> vertical integration policy and local officials not <lb/>always well informed about policy frameworks; <lb/> some negative attitudes to social enterprise, social <lb/>entrepreneurship and the social economy; <lb/> new social entrepreneurship network is not well <lb/>linked to traditional social enterprise sectors; <lb/> access to SME support structures not well developed <lb/> business/management skills deficit in new social <lb/>enterprises; <lb/> tenders and projects as main development path for <lb/>social entrepreneurs, which bring with it issues <lb/>around sustainability; <lb/> lack of a wider law on social entrepreneurship <lb/>(although this could soon be addressed with a <lb/>proposed law before parliament). <lb/> social/public property issue hampering reform of co-<lb/>operatives; and the approval of new co-operative law, <lb/>including that for social co-operatives (unless it <lb/>becomes a separate law); <lb/> performance and funding issues of disability <lb/>companies; and, <lb/> weak, although dynamic, NGO sector <lb/></body>

			<page>67 <lb/></page>

			<body>Opportunities <lb/>Threats <lb/> donations and legacies as a potential source of <lb/>income – e.g. for large socially entrepreneurial <lb/>charities/foundations; <lb/> diaspora relations and services (especially for <lb/>elderly); <lb/> CSR relations and improving large firm contracting; <lb/> improving the possibilities for micro-finance; <lb/> government funds could be reoriented toward social <lb/>enterprise; <lb/> EU funds gradually opening up (oriented to project <lb/>funding); <lb/> raising profile of social entrepreneurship in CSR <lb/>programmes; <lb/> strengthening research/policy/media networking; <lb/> building on donor project initiatives for sustainability; <lb/> social entrepreneurship role in addressing the size of <lb/>the informal economy; and, <lb/> niche/quota strategy for procurement could use social <lb/>clauses in current legislation; <lb/> new measures open to /opportunistic exploitation; <lb/>and consequent reputation risks; <lb/> trends towards withdrawal of international donors; <lb/> continuing <lb/>budgetary <lb/>constraints <lb/>limiting <lb/>opportunities; and, <lb/> sustainability risks for new social enterprises. <lb/>The SWOT analysis provides a useful way of briefly summarising the current situation, some of the <lb/>ways forward, and some of the issues. In this way it provides a useful point of reflection prior to policy <lb/>recommendations in the next chapter. <lb/></body>

			<page>68 <lb/></page>

			<body>CHAPTER 4: POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS <lb/>Given the concerns about the misuse of status and funds raised during the OECD visit, and given also <lb/>the need to clearly carve a space for social enterprises, we propose a cautious approach with the aim of <lb/>establishing the emerging sector on a sound foundation, and gradually building its reputation as a <lb/>distinctive social but entrepreneurial innovation. This means that many of the recommendations should <lb/>also be seen in this perspective: that of gradually building a framework, alongside an emerging movement <lb/>– keeping in mind the development of new social enterprise law being seen as a medium term objective. <lb/>The section on legislation explores the options in more depth, but to summarise: foundations seem to <lb/>have considerable potential (but clarificatory Guidance Notes by registrars would be needed), co-<lb/>operatives are clearly relevant, particularly if they could be supported and linked in a new distinctive <lb/>network; and there may be scope for using social enterprise model constitutions with the limited company <lb/>form, though there are risks in the medium term here. <lb/>There are some underlying principles regarding developing appropriate frameworks for social <lb/>entrepreneurship. Firstly, that it is important to develop a level playing field with regard to other types of <lb/>organisations in the market, particularly SMEs. Secondly, legal frameworks should be well adapted to the <lb/>distinctive needs of social enterprise, combining social and economic objectives – and it is important to <lb/>recognise that in many countries legislation has followed innovation over a number of years by social <lb/>entrepreneurs who have adapted existing legislation to their requirements; and, thirdly, there should be a <lb/>well supported institutional and policy framework that matches well with the relevant types of legal forms <lb/>of social enterprise. Finally, in developing such policy frameworks, it is important that the public/social <lb/>benefit dimension of social enterprise is not only properly recognised, but also financially supported – as it <lb/>would be in the context of state funded benefits. <lb/></body>

			<page>69 <lb/></page>

			<body>POLICY OPTIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS <lb/>The policy options and recommendations follow the same thematic structure as in Chapters 2 and 3: <lb/>Preconditions, Infrastructure, Governance, Finance, Skills, and Access to Markets. Taken together these <lb/>comprise a strategy for social entrepreneurship, which requires a new co-ordinative function to be <lb/>established to negotiate with relevant government and sector bodies and ensure the strategy is supported <lb/>and implemented; such a function would need to operate at the inter-ministerial level and could be located <lb/>in existing bodies such as SIPRU or OCCS. <lb/>The rationale for the policy options arises from the detailed analysis in the previous chapters. The <lb/>feasibility and desirability of policy options is considered as a basis for formulating recommendations, <lb/>which are specified at the end of each section. A key underlying theme in these policy recommendations is <lb/>that they should be integral with other relevant policy measures, rather than separate, for example <lb/>whenever policy for SMEs is developed, policy documents should be adapted to: &quot; SMEs and Social <lb/>Enterprises &quot; . <lb/>Recommendations to Improve Preconditions <lb/>Many of the issues discussed under this theme in an earlier section relates to generic issues across <lb/>many fields of policy. The EU accession process has a clear focus on addressing many of these issues <lb/>(Government of the Republic of Serbia European Integration Office, 2011a). However, some measures <lb/>specific to social entrepreneurship may also help improve the wider environment for social enterprises to <lb/>develop in. These include developing a public relations strategy for social entrepreneurship, which applies <lb/>as much to governments, at all levels, as to the general public. Such a strategy could include: <lb/> promoting models of good practices; <lb/> attracting public figures and celebrities to social entrepreneurship, including via corporate social <lb/>responsibility; <lb/> competitions for best social enterprise and best social entrepreneurs of the year; <lb/> the use of online media (Group 484&apos;s electronic Newsletter on Social Entrepreneurship, <lb/>http://www.grupa484.org.rs/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=406&amp;lang=english <lb/>is one such example); <lb/> strengthening research/policy/media networking so that sympathetic journalists are properly <lb/>briefed; and, <lb/> raising the profile of social entrepreneurship in corporate social responsibility programmes. <lb/>Other measures related to improving preconditions include the important issue of the boundary <lb/>between social enterprise and the informal economy and whether social enterprise can provide a pathway <lb/>to the formal economy. This might be linked to specific sector strategies for developing social enterprise; <lb/>and this could be complemented with a strategy that offers additional benefits (including accessing health <lb/>and welfare services) thereby provide greater incentives for people to move out of the informal economy. <lb/></body>

			<page>70 <lb/></page>

			<body>Accordingly, it is recommended that: <lb/> a few sector strategies be developed as exemplars of effective social enterprise approaches to the <lb/>informal economy, for example, in waste recycling, homecare, childcare, local food markets. <lb/>Recommendations to Improve Infrastructure <lb/>Legal frameworks <lb/>The first issue to address is the suitability of current frameworks to social entrepreneurship whilst the <lb/>development of new legislation for social enterprise should be a medium-term goal. In Europe social <lb/>enterprise generally use (social) co-operative structures or non-profit structures (usually associations but <lb/>sometimes foundations) depending on the flexibility of each form and different traditions in each country – <lb/>so Belgium generally uses non-profit forms while Italy and Sweden generally use (social) co-operative <lb/>structures. As noted previously, each of the currently available legal structures has some problems: the co-<lb/>operative structure is generally highly suitable except that it requires ten members for formation, and their <lb/>reputation is poor 10 ; the association form has issues around scale of operation and relatedness to mission <lb/>with penalties if these are not complied with; and the foundation has an issue around relatedness to its <lb/>mission or registered activity, although how tightly this needs to be specified could be examined, but it is <lb/>not so suitable for developing firm roots in civil society. Nonetheless, of these three legal structures <lb/>currently available the foundation appears more suitable for social entrepreneurship. The alternative is to <lb/>develop model constitutions and bye-laws using company law (see endnote 2), which might be supported <lb/>by a sector body and a badging system to develop a social enterprise marque; this might best be undertaken <lb/>by an independent, member-based trade association. This approach has risks since there may be potential <lb/>for opportunists to get social enterprise support and then change to a for-profit when the support ends. <lb/>Given these risks, company social enterprises should not receive public funds, but legally there would be <lb/>no barrier to them engaging in public contracts (as SMEs) <lb/>The final issue to address in relation to legislative frameworks for social enterprise is whether, having <lb/>developed legal structures that are non-profit or have limited profit distribution constraints so that they are <lb/>relatively unattractive for corrupt/opportunistic exploitation, these legal structures can be incentivised <lb/>through fiscal measures without attracting opportunistic entrepreneurs. The current tax break is low and <lb/>could be revised to make the structures not so much financially attractive as improving the chances of <lb/>sustainability. <lb/>Recommendations to improve the legal framework infrastructure are: <lb/> Foundations: <lb/> examine the potential of the foundation as a model for social entrepreneurship, especially the <lb/>issue around relatedness to mission – registered activity; <lb/> clarification is also required about how to specify related economic activity to comply with <lb/>the law, and extent of economic activity, given it may only be a non-core activity; <lb/> explore the extent to which Guidance Notes by registrars could be produced for public <lb/>official and social entrepreneurs; and, <lb/> allow flexibility in the choice of economic activities and potentially link the issue of mission <lb/>versus non-mission relatedness to different fiscal regimes. <lb/></body>

			<page>71 <lb/></page>

			<body> NGOs/associations: <lb/> clarify the permissible limit of &quot; small-scale &quot; economic activity, such as through Guidance <lb/>Notes, to facilitate flexible and larger scale entrepreneurial activity; and, <lb/> encourage them to engage in entrepreneurial activity up to this limit; <lb/> consider inclusion of asset locks for both NGOs/associations and foundations; <lb/> using limited company law develop model constitutions and bye-laws, but limit their access to <lb/>public funds; <lb/> develop a sector body to introduce and oversee a social enterprise marque renewable annually, <lb/>with quality checks (partly to guard against opportunism by limited companies); this might best <lb/>be undertaken by an independent member-based trade association. <lb/> Co-operatives: <lb/> press for resolution to the social/public property issue and the adoption of new draft <lb/>legislation on co-operatives and the inclusion of articles or separate law for social co-<lb/>operatives; <lb/> consideration could be given to ensuring these articles/law are relevant to both work <lb/>integration and welfare service operatives, and that they function as non-profit organisations <lb/>and that they allow multi-stakeholder structures; <lb/> press for a change in the law allowing a reduction in the numbers required to form a co-<lb/>operative (to the same number as for associations, that is. three people), to equalise the <lb/>incentives for formation in two comparable member-based organisations; and in line with <lb/>recent legislative trends: Italian social co-operatives/social enterprises, Finnish co-<lb/>operatives/social enterprises, Belgium co-operatives/social enterprises, Spain and France; but <lb/>not Poland/Portugal (five minimum); and, <lb/> press for a change in the law to allow secondary co-operatives to be formed; <lb/> support the development of a network assisting new socially entrepreneurial co-operatives <lb/>could also be provided. <lb/> as a medium-term goal, develop legislation for social enterprise; (which develops a broad <lb/>inclusive definition of the field); and, <lb/> examine increased incentivised fiscal measures linked to each legal structure as a way of <lb/>improving the chances of sustainability. <lb/>Institutional Capabilities (Governmental, Donor Community) <lb/>There are a number of useful policy measures that are currently relevant to the development of social <lb/>entrepreneurship and at the national level there is a recognition of the role of social enterprise could play, <lb/>although the work integration role is dominant, and the welfare service provision role could be better <lb/>established. However, it appears that although there is a growing trend in developing institutional <lb/>capabilities to support social enterprise, most of this is relatively small-scale. Nonetheless, it may be <lb/></body>

			<page>72 <lb/></page>

			<body>difficult to develop immediately a co-ordinated strategy across several ministries and programs, it may be <lb/>possible to gradually reshape each of the relevant programmes. Similarly, local government could make <lb/>important contributions to the development of social entrepreneurship. Accordingly, the gradual reshaping <lb/>of the relevant national/local government programmes could be done by: <lb/> taking forward the proposals in this document with relevant local/national government and sector <lb/>stakeholders to establish a strategy for social entrepreneurship; <lb/> establishing a new social entrepreneurship coordinative function to negotiate with relevant <lb/>responsible bodies and ensure the strategy is supported and implemented; such a function would <lb/>need to operate at the inter-ministerial level and could be located in existing bodies such as <lb/>SIPRU or OCCS; <lb/> developing a work integration social enterprise strategy (with appropriate models and <lb/>mechanisms, with protected budget) linked both to the National Employment Service, and to the <lb/>Public Works Programme; <lb/> capacity building of NGOs for social enterprise activity financed by the Lottery Fund; <lb/> developing a social enterprise strategy for welfare service provision with local government <lb/>alongside developing a social clause niche/quota social enterprise in procurement contracts; <lb/> developing a coherent framework and strategy for integrating the diversity of support measures <lb/>and potential support; and, <lb/> co-ordinating donor communities and corporate actors in a strategy to support social <lb/>entrepreneurship, and capacity building of NGOs towards social enterprise through co-ordinated <lb/>action of relevant Sector Working Groups. <lb/>Institutionalising the New Social Enterprise Sector <lb/>The emerging networks for social entrepreneurship have strengths and weaknesses: they are capable <lb/>and impressive, albeit very dependent on donor support. However, as the sector grows it will be important <lb/>to legitimise these networks by developing governance structures that give a prominent place to new social <lb/>enterprise. Alongside this development it will be important to strengthen the relationship between the new <lb/>and the established social enterprise sectors. <lb/> for the emerging networks of social entrepreneurship, help develop governance structures that <lb/>give a prominent place to new social enterprise; and, <lb/> strengthen the relationship between the new and the established social enterprise sectors, for <lb/>example through independent chamber of commerce type model. <lb/>Developing the Institutions of the Established Social Enterprise Sector <lb/>The issues associated with each of the component parts of the established social enterprise sector are <lb/>different. For example, new co-operatives are being formed, with the support of international donors. <lb/>These could make a substantial contribution to addressing rural/regional inequalities, as well as support the <lb/>development of social co-operative type initiatives. There may be scope for capacity building such <lb/>entrepreneurial activity (Ševarlić et al. 2010). This model could be adapted to social enterprise support. <lb/></body>

			<page>73 <lb/></page>

			<body>The following measures could improve their capacity and orientation towards social enterprise and social <lb/>entrepreneurship: <lb/> develop the capacity of NGOs, particularly of medium and large NGOs, to generate income <lb/>streams and engage in welfare service provision and procurement contracts (such as the UK <lb/>Futurebuilders programme mentioned below); <lb/> explore the extent to which foundations could be a useful interim structure for social enterprise, <lb/>and, support medium and large foundations to develop brands and donation potential – possibly <lb/>through partnership with international charitable organisations; <lb/> build the entrepreneurial capacity of new co-operatives, such as through development bodies, and <lb/>federal structures (also to promote good practices in governance, etc.); and, <lb/> with regard to companies for the disabled, address the issue of delayed payments and, at the <lb/>same time, undertake a review of their performance with regard to the effective integration of <lb/>disabled people into work. <lb/>Improve Business Support Infrastructure <lb/>It is important to ensure that social enterprise have full access to SME programmes of support. In fact, <lb/>as a principle of achieving equitable support with the SME sector, it is important to ensure that most <lb/>elements of policy and legislation referring to SME support are fully and explicitly inclusive of social <lb/>enterprise and their distinctive requirements. Develop the capacity for &quot; braided &quot; support of social <lb/>enterprise, for example by developing a network of social enterprise trainers. <lb/> ensure that social enterprises have full access to SME programmes of support at national and <lb/>local levels; <lb/> develop the capacity for &quot; braided &quot; support of social enterprise, for example by developing a <lb/>network of social enterprise trainers; and, <lb/> make full use of available EU funding streams to establish projects for the development of social <lb/>enterprise (including training/education at various levels). <lb/>Recommendations to Improve Governance <lb/>The issue of vertical integration of policy, including the development of well functioning and well-<lb/>informed public officials at the local level has been mentioned, and this clearly a generic issue, although <lb/>one that is likely to affect activities that are not so mainstream such as social enterprise and social <lb/>entrepreneurship. Serbia is not unique in this respect, and in many countries strategies to develop <lb/>recognition and legitimacy for social enterprise are necessary. Effective strategies have included <lb/>developing local examples of good practices through partnership projects between municipalities and <lb/>social enterprise. For example, one such project was EU funded for developing good practice in the use of <lb/>social clauses for social entrepreneurship in welfare provision. <lb/>Another important governance issue is strengthening the relationship with the social enterprise sector <lb/>and government at different levels. It is important to gradually develop a system of co-governance at all <lb/>levels, between national, municipal and regional bodies, and social economy organisations. This was <lb/>mentioned above with regard to the new social enterprise sector; but is equally important to develop this <lb/>capability with the established social economy sector. Thus, this might include support for the <lb/></body>

			<page>74 <lb/></page>

			<body>development of a social economy coalition that brings together the NGOs, foundations and co-operatives; <lb/>the development of horizontal networks across these pillars of the social economy may initially function <lb/>better at the municipal level around areas of common interest, and where networks of learning and good <lb/>practice might be supported by EU programme funding. As outlined above, it is important to have an inter-<lb/>ministerial co-ordinative function for social entrepreneurship which would play a key role in policy <lb/>governance in this area. <lb/> develop good practice partnership projects between municipalities and social enterprise, such as <lb/>with EU funding, for developing good practice in the use of social clauses for social <lb/>entrepreneurship in welfare provision; <lb/> consider support for the development of a social economy coalition that brings together NGOs, <lb/>foundations and co-operatives, initially at the municipal level through the development of <lb/>horizontal networks across these pillars of the social economy with EU programme funding; <lb/> improve vertical and horizontal policy integration for social entrepreneurship through <lb/>administrative guidelines; <lb/> capacity building, communication, education and training of relevant administrative officials <lb/>about relevant policy frameworks; and, <lb/> gradually develop a system of co-governance with municipal and regional bodies together with <lb/>social economy organisations. <lb/>Recommendations to Improve Finance <lb/>Finance is a central issue for social entrepreneurship, firstly because social enterprise needs to access <lb/>conventional sources of finance, and typically there are barriers there which need to be removed; secondly <lb/>because social enterprise generally support the most disadvantaged in society, some form of subsidy or <lb/>preferential financial arrangement is often required; and, thirdly, because the transition from project <lb/>funding for start-up to sustainable social enterprise requires careful design of a comprehensive framework <lb/>of financial institutions and instruments to support the different phases of social enterprise development. <lb/>This might include grants for feasibility studies and the development of business plans, low costs rose in <lb/>incubators for the first 18 months of business development, loan guarantee systems, and specialist financial <lb/>institutions to act in a venture capitalist type role supporting growth of the social enterprise. EU funds and <lb/>funding institutions will play an increasingly important role in this area. In addition, consideration could <lb/>be given to programmes to support social entrepreneurs, such as the business support grants of UnLtd 11 <lb/>(UK) which are funded through a foundation. <lb/>Access to an efficient and lower cost micro-finance system is a very important issue for social <lb/>enterprise, particularly when helping disadvantaged individuals and communities improve their lives <lb/>through economic activity. <lb/>Not all these measures need to be derived from state funds; the development of community/social <lb/>investment funds can be promoted through fiscal measures which might motivate corporations to donate <lb/>finance to specialist funds from their corporate social responsibility budgets. In addition asset transfer <lb/>policies by municipalities and other public bodies may provide buildings that can be used as low rent <lb/>incubators giving financial and developmental support to newly-formed social enterprise. <lb/>A comprehensive framework of financial institutions and instruments to support the different phases <lb/>of social enterprise development could be designed including: <lb/></body>

			<page>75 <lb/></page>

			<body> link activities/support from Budget and Lottery Funds enabling access for NGOs, social <lb/>enterprises and companies for the disabled; <lb/> the recently announced consultation on the establishment of a Social Inclusion Fund in the <lb/>Republic of Serbia could also play an important role by strategically coordinating national and <lb/>future EU funds for social inclusion; <lb/> measures to address the conservative attitude of banks, possibly through government-sponsored <lb/>loan guarantee systems; <lb/> promote legislation to establish a comprehensive framework for micro-finance, so that it does not <lb/>need to be channelled through the banks and is appropriately regulated in line with international <lb/>experience; <lb/> develop a comprehensive framework to support the financial needs of social entrepreneurs during <lb/>start-up, development and growth of social enterprise; <lb/> design a system of grants for feasibility studies and the development of business plans, low cost <lb/>rents in incubators for the first 18 months of business development, loan guarantee systems, and <lb/>specialist financial institutions to act in a venture capitalist type role supporting growth of the <lb/>social enterprise; <lb/> consider programmes to support social entrepreneurs, such as funding through a foundation; <lb/>(with a possible endowment through international donor/CSR partnership); <lb/> consider the development of credit unions community development finance initiatives (supported <lb/>through fiscal measures); and, <lb/> examine asset transfer policies by municipalities and other public bodies to provide buildings for <lb/>low rent incubators. <lb/>Recommendations to Improve Skills <lb/>Chapter 3 developed a typology of skills relevant for social entrepreneurship. It appears that the first <lb/>area of skills – skills for social inclusion – is relatively well-developed in Serbia, particularly in the area of <lb/>disability. But the skill sets associated with integrating disadvantaged people may need more support from <lb/>education and training institutions. Thus, vocational training institutions may be able to develop short <lb/>courses for social enterprises working in this area, and this may be an area where EU funding would be <lb/>appropriate, for example through Leonardo da Vinci funding – see for example the Leonardo funded <lb/>Ariadne project for training managers in the social economy (http://www.social-economy-training.eu/). <lb/>The second category, skills for entrepreneurship and management (marketing, finance in particular, <lb/>business planning and development), is the most important area. It would seem essential to ensure that <lb/>social entrepreneurs have full access to SME training and mentoring programs – particularly government <lb/>programs, but also CSR, and donor partnership programs. This requires ensuring associated legislation and <lb/>policy is inclusive of social enterprise, and that the training is customised to the distinctive needs of social <lb/>enterprise, and that this is communicated to the social entrepreneurs. <lb/>In addition to this, the distinctive features of social enterprise imply that specialist training <lb/>programmes would be required to cope with what is available from SME training facilities. If this is well-<lb/>designed it should become an integrated system of braided support. <lb/></body>

			<page>76 <lb/></page>

			<body>There is currently an emphasis in SME development on identifying &quot; gazelles &quot; <lb/>– those enterprises with high growth potential (10% per annum); a similar programme to that being <lb/>developed for SMEs could be designed for social enterprise. However, there is also extensive international <lb/>experience of capacity building agreements between public bodies and social enterprise; this has led to <lb/>well-developed capacity building programmes over a number of years, such as UK Futurebuilders – this <lb/>programme ran for eight years working with medium and large social enterprises to develop their <lb/>managerial capabilities in order to engage in public service contracts. There are other initiatives that go <lb/>beyond capacity building to develop skills for growth and scaling, and develop models such as social <lb/>franchising which may also be relevant in Serbia. <lb/>The third category of skills – skills for meeting regulatory, reporting requirements, advocacy, and <lb/>negotiating with bureaucracy – is clearly important, but might best be addressed through partnership <lb/>projects between public bodies and social enterprise development agents. The EU funded EQUAL <lb/>programme gave support to social procurement involving public bodies and social enterprise – some of the <lb/>useful documents from this programme are still relevant and available online, and could be useful to <lb/>explore. <lb/>The same applies to the final category of skills – skills for development of social enterprise – since <lb/>development workers within projects and networks and ministries/municipalities would benefit most from <lb/>developing networks amongst themselves so that they can become a community of practitioners, and share <lb/>understandings of best practices. Such a network is also likely to benefit from international exchanges and <lb/>partnerships through EU projects. Note that skills development includes building capacity of <lb/>administrative officials through communication, education, and training, which is discussed under the <lb/>infrastructure theme. <lb/>Recommendations: <lb/> ensure that social entrepreneurs are made aware of, and have full access to, SME training and <lb/>mentoring programmes that are properly tailored to their specific needs; particularly government <lb/>programs, but also CSR, and donor partnership programs; <lb/> ensure that SME related legislation and policy is inclusive of social enterprise; <lb/> explore the development specialist training programmes specifically for social enterprise needs; <lb/> examine the policy of picking winners, that is of identifying high growth social enterprise <lb/> &quot; gazelles &quot; ; <lb/> develop capacity building agreements between public bodies and social enterprise for medium <lb/>sized social enterprise; <lb/> examine the potential to develop scaling models such as social franchising; <lb/> explore project funding for skills aimed at meeting regulatory, reporting requirements, advocacy, <lb/>and negotiating with bureaucracy – such as through available EU programmes; and, <lb/> explore project funding for skills aimed at social enterprise development workers, for example <lb/>through available EU funding. <lb/></body>

			<body>Recommendations to Improve Access to Markets <lb/>This is a major strategic area in the development of social enterprise in Serbia. Having designed <lb/>appropriate legal, fiscal and policy frameworks for social entrepreneurship, the issue is whether public <lb/>service niche/quotas (protected markets) can be opened for social enterprise under social clause policies, <lb/>without attracting opportunists. The 2008 Law on Public Procurement has provided a framework for <lb/>designing such an arrangement of social clauses in public procurement markets, but it appears not to have <lb/>been explored (the new draft law could enhance this possibility, building on SIPRU&apos;s consultative <lb/>contribution). It would seem appropriate to initiate some pilot projects to explore this option on a small <lb/>scale in sectors relevant to current social enterprise activity such as homecare, or eldercare (for example, <lb/>meals on wheels). The other areas for the development of strategy and policy are in support of social <lb/>enterprise operating in ethical markets; improving access to donations and legacies; and strengthening CSR <lb/>relations. Measures might include: <lb/> examining the potential of using the 2008 Law on Public Procurement (the new draft law <lb/>discussed in 2012 could enhance this possibility) as a framework for designing social clauses in <lb/>public procurement markets, by initiating some pilot projects in key areas such as homecare or <lb/>eldercare (for example, Meals on Wheels); <lb/> building partnerships with international organisations operating in ethical markets; <lb/> building capacity of large NGOs for acquisition of donations and legacies; <lb/> considering increasing tax breaks for donations; <lb/> considering give-as-you-earn charitable donation systems through payroll deductions; and, <lb/> strengthening relationships between social enterprise and corporate social responsibility <lb/>institutions. <lb/></body>

			<body>CHAPTER 5: ACTION PLAN – A STAGED APPROACH OF DEVELOPMENTS FROM <lb/>FEASIBLE TO DESIRABLE <lb/>This chapter briefly outlines a staged approach of recommended actions for: short term, medium term, <lb/>and longer term. The logic of the timings is partly what is more important, but also that some <lb/>recommendations, though important take time, such as new legislation. <lb/>The action plan follows the same theme as the main study: Preconditions, Infrastructure, Governance, <lb/>Finance, Skills, and Access to Markets. Taken together these comprise a strategy for social <lb/>entrepreneurship, which requires a new co-ordinative function to be established to negotiate with <lb/>relevant government and sector bodies and ensure the strategy is supported and implemented; such a <lb/>function would need to operate at the inter-ministerial level and could be located in existing bodies such as <lb/>SIPRU (Social Inclusion and Poverty Reduction Unit) or OCCS (Office for Co-operation with Civil <lb/>Society). <lb/>The main priorities for the short, medium and long term action are: <lb/>Recommendations to Improve Preconditions <lb/>What <lb/>How <lb/>Who <lb/>Short to Medium-Term <lb/>Develop a public <lb/>relations strategy <lb/>for social <lb/>entrepreneurship, <lb/>which could include: <lb/> promoting models of good practices; <lb/> attracting public figures and celebrities to social <lb/>entrepreneurship, <lb/>including <lb/>via <lb/>corporate <lb/>social <lb/>responsibility; <lb/> competitions for best social enterprise and best social <lb/>entrepreneurs of the year; <lb/> the use of online media (Group 484&apos;s electronic <lb/> &quot; Newsletter on Social Entrepreneurship &quot; is one such <lb/>example); <lb/> strengthening research/policy/media networking so that <lb/>sympathetic journalists are properly briefed; and, <lb/> raising the profile of social entrepreneurship in corporate <lb/>social responsibility programmes. <lb/>SIPRU in collaboration with <lb/>the Coalition for the <lb/>Development of Social <lb/>Entrepreneurship <lb/> developing a few sector strategies as exemplars of <lb/>effective social enterprise approaches to the informal <lb/>economy, such as in recycling;. <lb/>Coalition <lb/>for <lb/>the <lb/>Development <lb/>of <lb/>Social <lb/>Entrepreneurship <lb/>with <lb/>sponsors, <lb/>such <lb/>as <lb/>international donors. <lb/></body>

			<body>GLOSSARY <lb/>Charity: An organisation, trust or foundation established to pursue philanthropic objectives and <lb/>providing some kind of public benefit. Charities are not owned by anyone, and are governed by trustees <lb/>who are required to pursue the purposes for which the charity was established. In many countries, charities <lb/>have certain tax privileges. <lb/>Civil society: Civil society may be defined as a space or arena between households and the state, <lb/>which affords possibilities of concerted action and social organisation. Thus, it encompasses all voluntary <lb/>associations of citizens, whether politically motivated or active or not (although the term carries an <lb/>implication of political consciousness and activity): business, labour, non-governmental organisations, <lb/>churches, special interest or purpose groups. These elements are the constituents of civil society, but none <lb/>can individually be representative of it. Business is often excluded, although the OECD does include it, <lb/>given that channels of communication between traditional organised business and labour and government <lb/>are generally well established. Most frequently the term is used interchangeably with &quot; NGOs &quot; where the <lb/>term &quot; NGO &quot; refers specifically to activist groups, although these are simply one category of civil society <lb/>as a whole. <lb/>Collective enterprise: A short-hand term for collectively owned enterprises: co-operatives, mutuals, <lb/>non-profit organisations and foundations. <lb/>Companies for the disabled: These are the only officially recognised legal form of social enterprise <lb/>in Serbia; they provide vocational rehabilitation and employment for people with disabilities. About half of <lb/>these are majority state owned, and half privately owned. The Law on Professional Rehabilitation and <lb/>Employment of Persons with Disabilities specifies the term social enterprise as a separate subcategory and <lb/>links it to addressing the needs of people with disabilities. The implication of this is that a social enterprise <lb/>provides services for people disabilities, and should employ at least one person with a disability. At the <lb/>same time, the Law requires that at least five people with disabilities should be employed and the <lb/>proportion of employees with disabilities should be at least 50% including 10% with special employment <lb/>needs. The law gives tax relief on profits proportionate to the numbers with disabilities (Article 46). <lb/>Co-operative: A co-operative is an association of persons united voluntarily to meet their common <lb/>economic, social and cultural needs and aspirations through a jointly-owned and democratically-controlled <lb/>enterprise. Examples of co-operatives in Europe can be traced back to the 19th century. The International <lb/>Labour Organisation has suggested that co-operatives should be based on the values of self-help, self-<lb/>responsibility, democracy, equality, equity, and solidarity and share the principles of: voluntary and open <lb/>membership; democratic member control; member economic participation; autonomy and independence; <lb/>education, training and information; co-operation among co-operatives; and, concern for the community, <lb/>which were identified by the International Co-operative Alliance in 1995. A co-operative includes one or <lb/>more kinds of users or stakeholders: 1) consumers who use the enterprise to acquire products or services <lb/>(such as a retail co-operative, housing, healthcare or day-care co-operatives); 2) producers (such as <lb/>independent entrepreneurs, artisans, or farmers) who use the enterprise to process and market the goods or <lb/>services they produce, or to buy products or services necessary to their professional activities; and, 3) <lb/>workers who use the enterprise to secure their employment and control their working conditions. Co-<lb/>operatives operate democratically (one person, one vote) through two bodies (general meeting of the <lb/></body>

			<page>87 <lb/></page>

			<body>members or delegates, and a board of directors, which is composed of members elected at a general <lb/>meeting). The delegate structure may be required to reflect the size of the organisation or the distance <lb/>covered by the co-operative. The co-operative&apos;s start-up capital usually comes from co-operative shares <lb/>purchased by members. Since 1980, special co-operatives, known as social co-operatives, have become <lb/>more widespread in OECD member countries. <lb/>Foundation(s): Foundations are philanthropic organisations, organised and operated primarily as a <lb/>permanent collection of endowed funds, the earnings of which are used for the long-term benefit of a <lb/>defined geographical community or non-profit sector activity. Foundations operate as grant-making <lb/>institutions, and also as providers of social, health and cultural services. They thus provide a significant <lb/>link between the private and non-profit sectors, acting as a recipient of private capital and a funder of non-<lb/>profit organisations. Foundations are tax-exempt; incorporated; not-for-profit; organisationally <lb/>autonomous; and, cannot be controlled directly or indirectly by government at any level, corporations, <lb/>associations and their members, or individuals. They occupy a unique and central place in the non-profit <lb/>sector and therefore the development of foundations will strongly affect the future of the sector as a whole. <lb/>Mutual organisations/societies: A mutual organisation is an organisation owned and managed by its <lb/>members and that serves the interests of its members. Mutual organisations can take the form of self-help <lb/>groups, friendly societies and co-operatives. Mutual organisations exclude shareholding as they bring <lb/>together members who seek to provide a shared service from which they all benefit. They are widely <lb/>represented in the insurance sector. <lb/>Non-governmental Organisation (NGO): An NGO is a legally constituted organisation with no direct <lb/>representation or participation by government. Even if many NGOs receive funding from government, they <lb/>retain their &quot; non-government &quot; identity because of their autonomy. Today, there are numerous national and <lb/>international NGOs with an increased role in poverty reduction, social inclusion, environmental protection, <lb/>social justice, to name a few. Many NGOs rely also on private contributions in the form of donations. <lb/>NGOs include many civil society organisations directly and/or indirectly. The work of NGOs has increased <lb/>substantially in the last two decades as has their fragility given their reliance on public funding in most <lb/>cases. Most NGOs are organisationally and legally equivalent to non-profit organisations (NPOs), although <lb/>a small minority may have not-just-for-profit corporate structures. <lb/>Non-profit sector: The best known definition, while not commonly shared, particularly in European <lb/>countries, is undoubtedly that supplied by the Johns Hopkins University (www.jhu.edu/~cnp/). According <lb/>to this definition, the sector includes organisations which are voluntary, formal, private, self-governing and <lb/>which do not distribute profits, such as hospitals, universities, social clubs, professional organisations, day-<lb/>care centres, environmental groups, family counselling agencies, sports clubs, job training centres, human <lb/>rights organisations, and others. In fact, entities belonging to the non-profit sector can vary from country to <lb/>country according to national history and tradition. The term non-profit, emanating from the USA, refers <lb/>mainly to the absence of profit distribution. This is substantially different to the European approach of <lb/> &quot; social economy &quot; , which includes co-operatives. However, this difference is less significant when <lb/>investigated through empirical research. Borzaga and Defourny (The Emergence of Social Enterprise, <lb/>2001, Routledge, London) argue that the distribution of profits is, in any case, limited by internal and <lb/>external regulations in co-operatives and mutual organisations in European countries. <lb/>Social economy: The term &quot; social economy &quot; first appeared at the beginning of the 19 th century in <lb/>France. It was, nevertheless, only at the beginning of the 20 th century that it began to be used to indicate <lb/>various entities aimed at improving collective working conditions and individual lives. This concept is now <lb/>also used by Anglo-Saxon countries to refer to the production of goods and services provided not solely by <lb/>the non-profit sector, but also, in some cases, by private enterprises with shareholder agreements that force <lb/>the majority of shareholders to agree to social objectives undertaken by the firm. Among the organisations <lb/></body>

			<page>88 <lb/></page>

			<body>belonging to the social economy, one can find associations, co-operatives, mutual organisations and <lb/>foundations. This type of economy is essentially regulated by the stakeholder principle, which stands in <lb/>stark contrast to the notion of shareholder capitalism. The &quot; social economy &quot; is a broader concept than the <lb/>non-profit sector, as it is less strictly bound to the non-distributional constraint, according to which <lb/>organisations cannot legally redistribute their surplus to their owners (see also &quot; third sector &quot; ). <lb/>Social enterprise: Social enterprise refers to an organisation form which has flourished in recent years <lb/>and for which various definitions exist. Alongside academic definitions, and those elaborated by <lb/>international organisations, which are built around general criteria, there are definitions used within <lb/>countries that are specific to the national understanding of the phenomenon of social enterprise. <lb/>Increasingly countries are developing formal legal definitions of social enterprise. Generally, this concept <lb/>refers to any private activity conducted in the public interest, organised with an entrepreneurial strategy <lb/>and whose main purpose is not the maximisation of profit, but the attainment of certain economic and <lb/>social goals, and which, through the production of goods and services, brings innovative solutions to <lb/>problems such as social exclusion and unemployment (see Social Enterprises, OECD, 1999). In this way, <lb/>social enterprises combine the entrepreneurial skills of the private sector with a strong social mission that <lb/>is characteristic of the social economy as a whole. Social enterprises are part of the thriving and growing <lb/>collection of organisations that exist between the private and public sectors. They come in a variety of <lb/>forms including employee owned businesses, credit unions, co-operatives, social co-operatives, <lb/>development trusts, social firms, intermediate labour market organisations, community businesses, or <lb/>charities&apos; trading arms. They mainly operate in two fields of activity: the training and integration into <lb/>employment of persons excluded from the labour market, and the delivery of personal and welfare <lb/>services. <lb/>Third sector: The concept of &quot; third sector &quot; is often used as a synonym to the non-profit sector and, <lb/>more recently, also to &quot; social economy &quot; , notably in the British literature. The term was chosen to reflect <lb/>the idea that the sector assembles these otherwise disjointed entities, and that it sits between the public and <lb/>private sectors and follows unique social goals and internal organisational rules. Its mode of financing is <lb/>mixed, as it can seek both private and public funding. The idea of establishing a distinct &quot; third sector &quot; has <lb/>given rise to many hefty debates, which have centred upon the danger of using the third sector as a residual <lb/>sphere or &quot; dumping ground &quot; for those individuals excluded from the private and public sectors. To avoid <lb/>the danger of social polarisation, the third sector should not merely be seen as an alternative route or <lb/>juxtaposition to the public and private sectors, but as an interactive and reflexive component of economy <lb/>and society. Others have argued that the boundaries of the third sector cannot be established with certainty, <lb/>and for this controversial reason the European Commission preferred the use of the term &quot; Third System &quot; . <lb/></body>

			<body>NOTES <lb/>1 <lb/>The UK&apos;s Community Interest Company legislation provides some indications of the kinds of measures <lb/>that might be incorporated into bye-laws to constrain opportunistic behavior – such as asset lock, dividend <lb/>caps, and an annual community interest report; <lb/>(see http://www.bis.gov.uk/cicregulator and http://www.cicassociation.org.uk/about/what-is-a-cic; however <lb/>bye-laws can be changed by a company, thus some form of continuing branding such as a social enterprise <lb/>marque <lb/>(brand) <lb/>could <lb/>help <lb/>to <lb/>reduce <lb/>the <lb/>risk <lb/>of <lb/>opportunistic <lb/>behavior <lb/>http://www.socialenterprisemark.org.uk/the-mark/get-the-<lb/>mark/?gclid=CK21oInm4bECFRGBfAodmzUAQA) <lb/>2 <lb/>This operates through the National Employment Service to provide employment for disadvantaged people <lb/>through public tenders to conduct activities in: social, humanitarian, cultural and other sectors, <lb/>maintenance and rehabilitation of public infrastructure, maintenance and protection of environment and <lb/>nature. <lb/>3 <lb/>An asset lock is used in the UK&apos;s Community Interest Company legislation, as well as in many European <lb/>Co-operative laws. An asset lock prevents profits from being distributed to its members or shareholders <lb/>other than in certain limited circumstances. It also means that all assets must be used for the community <lb/>purpose or, if they are sold, open market value must be obtained for them and the proceeds used for the <lb/>community purpose. In addition, if the CIC is wound up, its assets must be transferred to another, similarly <lb/>asset-locked body. <lb/>4 <lb/> &quot; Braided &quot; business support is based on the view that SME business support caters for the typical business <lb/>and the typical entrepreneur; and the need to recognise firstly that disadvantaged groups have special <lb/>support requirements, and social enterprise have distinctive features that need specialist advice – thus <lb/> &quot; braided &quot; support combines standard mainstream provision with specialist support (GHK et al., 2006). <lb/>5 <lb/>However, current research argues that the design of Serbia&apos;s employment tax and benefit system helps <lb/>explain this, by effectively excluding low wage and part-time workers: <lb/> &quot; The reason for the high tax wedge at lower wage levels in Serbia are the minimum social security <lb/>contributions that employees and employers have to pay. The minimum social security contribution is not <lb/>adjusted for hours actually worked, so also part-time workers are subject to it. Additionally, once a person <lb/>has a formal work on his record there is a sudden withdrawal of social assistance and family benefits. The <lb/>marginal effective tax shows that, at low wage levels (below 10 percent of average wage), every dinar <lb/>earned is subtracted from entitlements to social assistance. Hence, 100 percent of any additional dinar <lb/>earned is taxed away. Therefore, the so-called mini-jobs and midi-jobs (mainly part-time jobs) are not <lb/>economically viable for low-wage earners. This effectively excludes a substantial part of the Serbian <lb/>working-age population from formal employment and social security coverage &quot; (Randjelovic et al., 2012). <lb/>6 <lb/>The picture is complicated due to re-registrations under the new law; 28 448 associations were registered in <lb/>2011, about 15 000 of which were re-registering under the new law; there were about 8000 sports clubs, <lb/>and approximately 5000 are associations that are not autonomous. <lb/>7 <lb/>The Social Innovation Fund was based in the Ministry of Labour and Social Policy, with support from <lb/>UNDP, the EU, other governments and NGOs. From 2003 to 2009 EUR 6 million were invested in the <lb/>development of local social welfare services. <lb/></body>

			<body>8 <lb/>For example in January 2011 at a conference discussing draft legislation for co-operatives in Serbia, Ms. <lb/>Dragijana Radonjic Petrovic, State Secretary at the Ministry of Economy and Regional Development <lb/>stated: &quot; The main issue with the co-operatives is related to public property. We hope that the new law will <lb/>solve this issue. In addition to existing youth and agricultural cooperatives, new law will also introduce <lb/>social co-operatives. &quot; <lb/>(see: <lb/>http://www.undp.org.rs/index.cfm?event=public.newsDetails&amp;revid=47EDC346-956A-5522-<lb/>548E8EC321461E3F) <lb/>9 <lb/>New EU proposals for procurement which if approved will come into effect in 2014 will reduce the <lb/>transactions costs of tendering for SMEs (relevant also to social enterprise), and broaden the scope for <lb/>sheltered workshops for disabled and disadvantaged workers; <lb/>(see: http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/publicprocurement/modernising_rules/reform_proposals_en.htm) <lb/>10 <lb/>As reported to the OECD team on several occasions, and documented in the literature: &quot; This may reflect a <lb/>resistance to the idea of co-operatives, which are often identified as being part of the &apos;old regime&apos; in <lb/>Serbia. It may also reflect a low level of understanding of what genuine co-operatives can achieve (as <lb/>demonstrated widely throughout the world) &quot; (Simmons et al. 2010) and &quot; a bad image of cooperatives <lb/>inherited from socialist time, which prevents the establishment of new cooperatives. &quot; (EMES, 2008) <lb/>11 <lb/>UnLtd, the Foundation for Social Entrepreneurs, is a charity which was endowed with GBP 100 million <lb/>from UK lottery money in 2002. It uses the income from this endowment to fund awards to different types <lb/>of awards for projects and people with growth potential. <lb/></body>
