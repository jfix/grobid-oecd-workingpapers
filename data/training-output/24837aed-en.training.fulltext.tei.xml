			<table>ECO/WKP(2017)3<lb/> FOSTERING INCLUSIVE GROWTH IN MALAYSIA<lb/> By Stewart Nixon, Hidekatsu Asada and Vincent Koen 1<lb/></table>

			<head>Introduction<lb/></head>

			<p>Growth can be more inclusive by pursuing policies that enable improvements in a country&apos;s living<lb/> standards while sharing gains more equitably across the population. Inclusive growth incorporates a<lb/> focus on relative -not just absolute -income and wealth inequality, and on well-being, which depends<lb/> on both monetary and non-monetary conditions, such as access to quality education, employment,<lb/> housing and healthcare.<lb/> From a highly unequal society on attaining independence in 1957, Malaysia has substantially<lb/> reduced inequality and poverty through decades of strategic planning with stability and inclusiveness at<lb/> their core. The New Economic Policy (1971-90) sought growth with equity and national unity, tackling<lb/> poverty by creating jobs for all Malaysians irrespective of race while seeking to reduce ethnic<lb/> identification with particular economic activities. The National Development <ref type="biblio">Policy (1991-2000)<lb/></ref> continued to emphasise the need for growth while increasing the focus on human capital development and<lb/> the eradication of hard-core poverty. The National Vision <ref type="biblio">Policy (2001-2010</ref>) continued earlier<lb/> policies around the vision of becoming a fully developed nation by 2020, aiming to build a<lb/> competitive nation with an equitable, unified and resilient society. Most recently, the New Economic<lb/> Model (since 2010) set targets for achieving high income status, inclusiveness and sustainability, with<lb/> the Government and Economic Transformation Programmes and the 10th and 11th Malaysia plans<lb/> providing whole-of-government reform blueprints towards achieving this vision.<lb/> Making growth more inclusive is fundamental to Malaysia&apos;s efforts to become a high-income country,<lb/> with the &quot; people economy &quot; at the centre of its development vision. Having eradicated all but a few pockets<lb/> of absolute poverty through decades of strong economic growth, Malaysia&apos;s focus is shifting to the<lb/> challenges of relative poverty and sustainable improvements to individual and societal well-being.<lb/> Accordingly, the 11th Malaysia Plan prioritises policies that enhance well-being with a particular focus on<lb/> increasing the living standards of the bottom 40% of households by income (B40).<lb/> The following section provides an overview of the current state of inclusive growth in Malaysia. The<lb/> subsequent ones identify priority areas where further reforms would enhance well-being. This<lb/> p a p e r complements the productivity-boosting reforms, with many of these reforms also beneficial to<lb/> fostering inclusive growth (<ref type="biblio">Asada et al., 2016</ref>). Reforms that provide universal access to quality<lb/> education and skills training provide an obvious example, and so do reforms that enhance innovation,<lb/> competition and SMEs. Innovative businesses exhibit higher employment growth that benefits both high-<lb/>and low-skilled workers. A robust competition environment spurs innovation and facilitates the<lb/> entry and expansion of new businesses (<ref type="biblio">de Mello and Dutz, 2012</ref>). Openness to trade and investment and<lb/> strong competition policies can increase the availability of lower priced essential goods and services for<lb/> ECO/WKP</p>

			<table>(2017)3<lb/> lower-income households, such as food, clothing and telecommunications. In many respects<lb/> therefore, productivity and inclusiveness enhancing policies go hand-in-hand.<lb/> Poverty, income and wealth inequality<lb/> Malaysia&apos;s sustained rapid real GDP growth of 6.4% per annum from 1970 to 2015 reduced the<lb/> incidence of absolute poverty from 49.3% to 0.6% (World Bank, World Development Indicators).<lb/> Some challenges remain, with higher rates of absolute poverty in rural areas (1.6%), for children under<lb/> 15 (1.7%) and for particular ethnic groups (Orang Asli 34%; Bumiputera Sabah 20.2% and Bumiputera<lb/> Sarawak 7.3%)</table>

			<p>still a focus of poverty reduction efforts, with programmes providing food, financial<lb/> aid and skills training. Income inequality has gradually reduced from very high levels, with low-<lb/>income households and previously disadvantaged ethnic groups benefiting more than<lb/> proportionately. The income share of the top 20% of households compared to the B40 has declined<lb/> substantially over this period, at a faster rate than Malaysia&apos;s overall Gini coefficient for household<lb/> income (<ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<figure>Figure 1. Income inequality has declined<lb/> Source: Department of Statistics, Malaysia.<lb/></figure>

			<p>Malaysia remains very unequal in terms of wealth distribution. Estimates suggest that 53% of Malaysian<lb/> households had zero financial assets in 2009, with ethnic Malay median financial wealth of just one ringgit<lb/> (<ref type="biblio">Muhammed Abdul Khalid, 2014</ref>). These estimates also indicate that some 92% of household wealth was<lb/> concentrated in property, consistent with high rates of home ownership in Malaysia (76% of Malaysian<lb/> households owned their home in 2014).<lb/></p>

			<p>As absolute poverty in Malaysia has been reduced to low levels, relative poverty provides a<lb/> more important benchmark for poverty eradication. The relative income poverty rate (based on an<lb/> unadjusted 50% of median income) has come down to 15.6% in 2014 from 17.4% in 2007, which is<lb/> above the OECD average but below the level in a comparable country such as Turkey (<ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>.A).<lb/> Inequality is particularly stark along regional lines, with a near eightfold difference in income<lb/> inequality between the richest and poorest states (<ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>.B and <ref type="figure">Figure 18</ref> further down). Very small<lb/> (single-person) and large (six-person) households appear particularly vulnerable to relative poverty, with<lb/> education completion, urbanisation, broadband connectivity, and labour force participation<lb/> among the factors associated with regional differences in relative poverty (<ref type="biblio">Nixon, 2016</ref>).<lb/> Multidimensional indicators of inequality, such as healthcare, education and information availability, also<lb/> display ample regional variation.<lb/> The differences across space and groups in recent cost of living pressures also suggest the need to<lb/> focus not only on the rural poor in less developed states but also on urban low-income households. In 2015,<lb/> ECO/WKP(2017)3<lb/> inflation was almost two percentage points lower in relatively wealthy Kuala Lumpur than in poorer Sabah<lb/> and Labuan, while inflation for households in the lowest income quintile was up to 0.6% higher (BNM,<lb/> 2015). The absence of household income data for this period makes it difficult to determine if households<lb/> in areas of higher inflation have benefited from compensatory adjustments in income; however, differences<lb/> in local cost-of-living increases may be contributing to regional inequality.<lb/></p>

			<p>Note: In Panel A, the data for Malaysia is based on relative poverty before taxes and transfers, with the rate after taxes and<lb/> transfers assumed to be the same, consistent with the minimal redistributive effects of the tax and transfer system (see <ref type="figure">Figure 9<lb/></ref> below).<lb/> Source: OECD (2016), OECD Income Distribution Database, http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/data-00654-en; Department of<lb/> Statistics, Malaysia.<lb/></p>

			<head>Broader measures of inclusive growth and well-being<lb/></head>

			<p>The OECD Better Life Index provides an overall snapshot of living standards within a country as<lb/> a measure of the inclusiveness of growth. Malaysia scores well on some indicators, in particular<lb/> long-term unemployment (<ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>). However, the index illustrates Malaysia&apos;s relative weakness in<lb/> areas such as educational attainment and skills, as well as personal earnings. Improving education quality<lb/> and skills training is essential to raise lifetime earning potential and social mobility while promoting social<lb/> cohesion and well-being over the longer term. The index also highlights the need to further improve<lb/> healthcare to increase healthy life expectancy. Maintaining universal access to quality medical services,<lb/> ECO/WKP(2017)3<lb/> particularly in rural areas and for low-income urban residents, would help narrow the life-expectancy gap<lb/> with advanced countries.<lb/></p>

			<figure>Figure 3. Well-being indicators point to further opportunities to foster inclusive growth<lb/></figure>

			<p>1. Due to data availability, the indicators used in the OECD Better Life database are not necessarily identical with this exercise.<lb/> Therefore, the high and low-income OECD data does not always correspond to the data in the OECD Better Life database.<lb/> 2. In panel A, indicators are normalised to range between 10 (best) and 0 (worst) according to the following formula:</p>

			<table>(indicator value<lb/> – minimum value) / (maximum value -minimum value) x 10. In panel B, a simple ranking of the OECD countries is applied.<lb/> 3. OECD high/bottom income countries are countries belonging to the top/bottom 30% income of the OECD member countries.<lb/> Source: OECD (2016), Better Life Index (database), www.oecdbetterlifeindex.org; national sources; UNESCO, UIS. Stat database.<lb/> ECO/WKP(2017)3<lb/> 10<lb/> The World Economic Forum&apos;s Inclusive Growth and Development Report 2015 broadly confirms<lb/> the findings of the OECD Better Life Index (WEF<ref type="biblio">, 2015</ref>). Malaysia performs strongly compared with<lb/> other middle-income countries for its income level in areas such as the provision of basic services (food,<lb/> drinking water and electricity), home ownership, financial inclusion, employment, corruption perceptions<lb/> and the quality and access to healthcare. However, the report identifies several areas of poor performance<lb/> relative to other middle-income countries, in particular education outcomes, healthcare costs, labour<lb/> force participation (especially women and elderly persons), pollution and social welfare.<lb/> Malaysia has created its own well-being index drawing on indicators specific to its circumstances<lb/> and priorities (<ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>). The index captures aspects of inclusiveness similar to those embodied in the<lb/> OECD Better Life Index but uses different indicators to represent these, determined by data availability<lb/> rather than policy targets (see Annex 1 at the end of this paper). The index tracks improvements over time<lb/> rather than providing an internationally comparable frontier approach. It suggests that between 2000 and<lb/> 2014, most improvement has occurred in areas such as housing, transport, leisure, education, income and<lb/> distribution; while improvement has been more modest in areas such as health, environment and<lb/> family. The decline in index values for 2013 reflects short-lived dips in areas such as housing, culture and<lb/> social participation, but also more significant downward trends in working life, environment and family<lb/> life – with index values for the latter two having almost reverted back to the 2000 baseline.<lb/> Divergence between the evolution of economic and social well-being and GDP growth over the<lb/> period reflects the incorporation of indicators that can be weakly or even negatively correlated with<lb/> GDP. Examples include environmental variables such as air quality and waste generation, family<lb/> variables including the dependency ratio, household debt, divorce rates and reported crime, and economic<lb/> well-being measures such as average working hours and education attainment rates. Also, the index lacks<lb/> a reference point against which outcomes can be assessed. Assessing the evolution of the index against<lb/> domestic goals (such as expected index growth based on policy targets) and international benchmarks<lb/> would be beneficial. Increased timeliness and frequency of index reporting would also support Malaysia&apos;s<lb/> efforts to foster inclusive growth.<lb/> Nonetheless, Malaysia&apos;s continued use of both domestic and international indicators of well-being will<lb/> help develop reforms supporting inclusive growth. Since its introduction in 2013, the index has been used<lb/> to identify areas in need of reform and develop new policies. Examples of initiatives prompted by the<lb/> introduction of the index include the Smart Partnership Towards Sustainable Environment programme to<lb/> raise environmental awareness, the 1Malaysia Family First Movement (1MFF) and Smartstart to reinforce<lb/> family values and provide guidance for young families, and the Belia Mahir 1Malaysia programme<lb/> providing vocational courses to young Malaysians.<lb/></p>

			<head>A more inclusive labour market<lb/></head>

			<p>Malaysia has a strong record of full employment that has benefited social well-being and<lb/> inclusiveness. However, so far labour market deficiencies have prevented low unemployment from<lb/> delivering the expected higher returns to work and skilled employment opportunities befitting a<lb/> high-income economy.<lb/> Employee safety nets that are standard in many high-income countries are underdeveloped in<lb/> Malaysia, which has a new but incompletely enforced minimum wage, no employment insurance scheme,<lb/> a lack of industry-based skills training, and a low unionisation rate. This exerts a drag on the promotion<lb/> of inclusive and productive labour markets, hindering industrial transformation from labour-intensive low-<lb/>skilled activities toward a more high-skilled, high-productivity economy. High-skilled job creation has not<lb/> kept pace with tertiary graduation rates, contributing to outflows of skilled labour abroad. Addressing the<lb/> low participation rates of women, youth and old people in particular would increase inclusiveness and<lb/> productivity. Labour market reforms would raise returns to work, increase participation rates, and<lb/> facilitate the transformation to high-skilled and high-productivity activities.<lb/></p>

			<p>Active labour market policies can help harness the productive potential of the population and<lb/> contribute to economic growth, social cohesion and the sustainability of the social protection system.<lb/> To this end, the government needs to maintain the motivation of jobseekers to actively pursue<lb/> employment while also improving their employability and expanding their opportunities to be placed<lb/> and retained in appropriate jobs (OECD, 2015a).<lb/></p>

			<head>Addressing labour market imbalances that limit employee returns<lb/></head>

			<p>Returns to work remain comparatively low in Malaysia, as reflected in a much lower share of<lb/> employee compensation in GDP than in OECD countries (<ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref>.A). Slow growth of skilled job creation<lb/> is contributing to this (<ref type="figure">Figure</ref> 5.B). Low relative returns to labour limit the inclusiveness of labour<lb/> markets by discouraging participation and delivering excessive benefits to capital holders.<lb/> A minimum wage was introduced in 2013, applying to both Malaysian national and migrant<lb/> workers. In 2009, around 34% of private sector workers earned less than MYR 700 (USD 175) per month,<lb/> below the MYR 800 (USD 200) national poverty line income. The introduction of the minimum wage<lb/> was estimated to have increased the wages of roughly 3.2 million private sector workers, or approximately<lb/> 30% of the total workforce, though a systematic assessment of beneficiaries has not been carried out<lb/> post implementation (UNDP, 2013; BNM 2013). The decline in relative poverty between 2012 and 2014<lb/> may reflect a positive impact of the minimum wage (Figure 2.B). Rates are determined every two-<lb/>three years by a consultative council comprising government, employer association and union<lb/> representatives. As of 1 July 2016, the monthly rate was raised to MYR 1 000 (USD 250) for Peninsular<lb/> Malaysia and MYR 920 (USD 240) for the states of Sabah and Sarawak. The minimum for Peninsular<lb/> Malaysia stood at 57% of the median wage in 2014.<lb/> ECO/WKP(2017)3<lb/> 12<lb/> Figure 5. The wage share is relatively low and skilled job creation has lagged<lb/> 1. Skilled employment includes managers, professionals, technicians and associated professionals.<lb/></figure>

			<p>2. Semi-skilled employment includes clerical support workers, service and sales workers, skilled agricultural, forestry and fishery<lb/> workers, craft and related trades workers, and plant and machine-operators and assemblers.<lb/> 3. Low-skilled employment is for the remaining elementary occupations.<lb/></p>

			<p>However, enforcement seems to be uneven and the number of minimum wage beneficiaries<lb/> may be overestimated, with legislative loopholes being exploited to convert existing benefits into wages<lb/> and weak enforcement for undocumented migrant workers (MOHR, 2016; ILO, 2016).<lb/> The 11th Malaysia Plan includes a commitment to establish a National Wage Index, to be compiled<lb/> under the aegis of the Ministry of Human Resources, to serve as a guide for employers in determining<lb/> wage levels for employees. Indicative wage levels will be based on employee qualifications, skills and<lb/> productivity. The index will not reduce the flexibility of employers to set wages on the basis of market<lb/> demand and supply, but is meant to increase recognition among employers of the need to regularly adjust<lb/> wages to reflect the increased skills and experience of their employees. Implementation of the index<lb/> will require agreement between the government and employer and employee representatives on<lb/> methodology (through the National Wages Consultative Council).<lb/></p>

			<figure>Reforms have also sought to reduce labour market skills mismatches through increased tertiary<lb/> sector cooperation with industry and the creation of TalentCorp. Established in 2011 as an agency<lb/> under the Prime Minister&apos;s Department, TalentCorp co-ordinates labour market and skills-development<lb/> policies under the Talent Roadmap 2020. Policies aim to facilitate demand-driven, inclusive and productive<lb/> ECO/WKP(2017)3<lb/> 13<lb/></figure>

			<p>labour markets through reskilling programmes to reduce skills gaps, information and job-matching<lb/> services to reduce youth unemployment, initiatives to enhance female labour participation and the<lb/> attraction and retention of foreign talent, including Malaysians working abroad. Education sector reforms<lb/> to address supply-side constraints, such as the shortage of job-ready graduates, are necessary.<lb/> The introduction of an employment insurance scheme is also an ongoing reform priority and an<lb/> essential element of a well-functioning labour market. In OECD countries, such insurance schemes<lb/> encourage labour mobility and risk-taking, provide temporary income smoothing and facilitate job-<lb/>search and retraining to minimise time out of the workforce. They can also provide an incentive for<lb/> formalisation in countries where the informal sector remains significant. A proposed scheme is currently<lb/> being debated, with consensus among stakeholders yet to be reached (see below the section on<lb/> social protection).<lb/> The 11th Malaysia Plan incorporates planned revisions to labour legislation to address rigidities that<lb/> prevent more flexible working hours and make dismissal processes tedious and repetitive. This includes<lb/> allowing disputes on dismissals that cannot be resolved by conciliation to be referred automatically to<lb/> the industrial court for arbitration. The experience of OECD countries in the past decade demonstrates<lb/> the benefits of less rigid dismissal processes, which increase incentives to hire new workers and<lb/> enhance the overall flexibility of the labour market to appropriately reward productivity. Recent OECD<lb/> country experience also highlights the importance of accompanying reforms to provide adequate<lb/> employment insurance and effective re-employment services (OECD, 2013a).<lb/> Malaysia&apos;s low trade union membership rate at 9.4% in 2013 compared with an average of 17% for<lb/> OECD countries (ILO data) is also indicative of labour market imbalances that limit returns for workers.<lb/> Impediments to the formation of unions and their rights to influence remuneration and conditions<lb/> contribute to this, though implementation of the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement (TPPA) is expected to<lb/> require major improvements in this area. Indeed, TPPA signatories are required to ensure compliance with<lb/> the 1998 ILO Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work and its Follow-Up. The<lb/> principles and rights include the freedom of association in forming labour unions and collective<lb/> bargaining, and the elimination of employment discrimination. Alongside these expected changes, a modest<lb/> Trade Union Development Programme has been introduced to increase worker understanding of collective<lb/> bargaining and encourage union creation. These reforms will improve the balance between the<lb/> protection of employees and the promotion of a flexible labour market.<lb/></p>

			<head>Raising labour participation rates of women, youth and older people<lb/></head>

			<p>Another priority for creating a more inclusive labour market is to raise the labour participation<lb/> rates of women, youth and older people – groups which have ample room to contribute toward raising the<lb/> overall participation rate. Across OECD countries, the gender employment gap has narrowed, with increased<lb/> labour participation of women the result of rising education attainment and increased use of family-friendly<lb/> policies (OECD, 2015b). In Malaysia, participation rates for these groups remain relatively low compared<lb/> to other Southeast and East Asian countries and the OECD average (<ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref>.A and B).<lb/> The labour participation rate of women decreases with age from 25-29 years old in Malaysia,<lb/> displaying a single-peak curve. This contrasts with the M-shaped participation profile of countries such as<lb/> Japan and Korea, where participation rates rise anew after falling at the time of childbirth (Figure 6.C).<lb/> Prior to 2010, female labour participation rates remained stubbornly low at around 46%. Reforms since<lb/> then have contributed to it increasing to 54% in 2015, with the 11th Malaysia Plan targeting 59%<lb/> by 2020. The government is encouraging female labour participation by providing better labour market<lb/> information, improving access to jobs through the 1Malaysia Support for Housewives and Flexworklife<lb/> programmes, and supporting entrepreneurship among women through Women Entrepreneurial<lb/> Incubator (Azam Niaga) and 1Nita programmes. Women&apos;s participation also benefits from the<lb/> Figure 6 Labour participation rates are relatively low<lb/> ECO/WKP(2017)3<lb/> 14<lb/> Note: In panel B, data for Malaysia is 2015 and 2014 for all others.<lb/> Source: ILO, ILOStat database; OECD, Labour force statistics database, http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/lfs-lfs-data-en.<lb/></figure>

			<p>Career Comeback programme and Resourcing and Retention grants (which provide financial<lb/> incentives for employers to hire returning workers) and the flexWorkLife.my portal increasing<lb/> awareness of flexible working arrangements. To achieve the 59% target rate, the government will be<lb/> strengthening its family-friendly employment strategy, including better access and affordability to quality<lb/> ECO/WKP(2017)3<lb/> 15<lb/> childcare facilities and early childhood education. It will also be undertaking labour market reforms<lb/> promoting flexible working conditions, including flexible working hours and work-from-home options.<lb/> Such family-friendly strategies and labour market reforms have proven to be effective in OECD<lb/> countries. Providing life-long learning and reskilling opportunities would also facilitate women&apos;s return<lb/> to work. Malaysia&apos;s particular challenge is to raise the participation rate of middle-aged and older<lb/> women. Women of these generations have lower average levels of educational attainment, thus<lb/> programmes that provide re-skilling opportunities and hiring incentives for employers are necessary to<lb/> facilitate their re-entry.<lb/> Although the overall unemployment rate is low, at around 3% in recent years, unemployment<lb/> of youth aged 15-24 approached 11% in 2015, accounting for 61% of total unemployment. The share of<lb/> unemployed persons with tertiary degrees has risen steadily to close to 34% in 2015 (<ref type="figure">Figure 7</ref>.A).<lb/> Unemployed women with a tertiary degree have become one of the largest groups of unemployed (<ref type="figure">Figure<lb/> 7</ref>.B).<lb/></p>

			<figure>Figure 7. Youth unemployment<lb/> Source: Department of Statistics, Malaysia.<lb/></figure>

			<p>Higher unemployment rates among the highly-educated youth can largely be attributed to skill<lb/> mismatches and a lack of work experience. To achieve the 11th Malaysia Plan target for youth<lb/> unemployment of below 8% by 2020, the successful implementation of reforms to improve skills training,<lb/> ECO/WKP(2017)3<lb/> 16<lb/> job matching and the industry relevance of tertiary qualifications will be critical. The government also<lb/> offers a programme, Transit home, aimed at high-risk children and youth to improve their<lb/> employability including entrepreneurship, education and skills training as well as providing emotional<lb/> and psychological support to return into society.<lb/></p>

			<head>Stronger minimum wage enforcement and effective policies for migrant workers<lb/></head>

			<p>While the introduction of a minimum wage in 2013 has lifted wages for numerous low-paid workers,<lb/> many workers are not benefiting from increased legal protections. The informal sector (defined as firms<lb/> which are not registered with the authorities) accounted for 1.4 million workers or 11.5% of employment<lb/> in the non-agricultural sector in 2015, according to the Informal Sector Workforce Survey Report (DOS,<lb/> 2016).<lb/> Strengthening the enforcement of the minimum wage is essential to its ongoing effectiveness. As<lb/> regards employers, the promotion of business registration associated with the introduction of the Goods<lb/> and Services Tax (GST) in 2015 has encouraged the formalisation of firms that previously operated<lb/> in the shadow economy. Further formalisation can be promoted through outreach programmes to<lb/> raise awareness and regulatory reform to reduce the costs of business registration and licencing.<lb/> Complementary initiatives to increase spot checks and auditing of compliance with minimum wages<lb/> and other labour-related regulations would also assist. Stronger penalties for non-compliance may act as a<lb/> deterrent (the maximum penalty per worker is equivalent to less than one year of minimum wages).<lb/> Enforcement could also be strengthened through incentives and opportunities for workers to assist<lb/> government compliance activity. In the absence of a strong union presence in Malaysia, awareness of<lb/> and access to complaints procedures or government tip lines is not widespread among low-skilled, low-<lb/>income workers. Government regulators need to be proactive in raising awareness and engaging with<lb/> workers who otherwise may struggle to find them, in particular foreign workers, whose livelihood is<lb/> under the comprehensive power of their employer by virtue of Malaysia&apos;s employer-responsibility<lb/> system for the recruitment and care of foreign workers (although legal foreign workers are less likely to<lb/> experience mistreatment).<lb/></p>

			<p>More broadly Malaysia needs to rectify its approach to labour migration policies that for two<lb/> decades have focussed on immediate business needs rather than longer-term settlement. While business-<lb/>oriented temporary worker programmes provide flexibility as part of an overall immigration policy mix,<lb/> the sole focus on temporary workers should be revisited to reduce the business stranglehold on low-<lb/>skilled labour policy. This would encourage migrants to cooperate with government as legal<lb/> temporary workers and potential future permanent residents where consistent with long-term labour<lb/> market needs (ILO, 2016) (Box 1).<lb/></p>

			<head>Strengthening social protection<lb/></head>

			<p>Malaysia&apos;s success in alleviating poverty, a major target under the 1971 New Economic Policy, has been<lb/> achieved despite the absence of an integrated and comprehensive social protection system. Households<lb/> benefit from near-universal access to electricity, clean water, healthcare and transport, but income<lb/> support for disadvantaged persons (such as the unemployed, single parents, disabled and elderly)<lb/> remains ad hoc, insufficiently targeted and inadequate in providing basic living standards. Achieving<lb/> inclusive growth not only requires providing meaningful employment but protecting people who are unable<lb/> to work. For Malaysia to achieve its aspiration of becoming a high-income country, a key priority is to<lb/> develop a comprehensive social protection system that provides targeted and timely support to those in<lb/> need, while retaining strong incentives and facilitation mechanisms to maximise labour market<lb/> participation.<lb/></p>

			<figure>ECO/WKP(2017)3<lb/> Box 1. An immigration policy befitting a high-income inclusive country<lb/></figure>

			<p>The 11th Malaysia Plan includes a commitment to develop a comprehensive immigration and<lb/> employment policy for foreign workers – a reform that is essential for Malaysia to become a high-income and<lb/> inclusive society. Effective implementation of Malaysia&apos;s TPPA commitments and minimum wage laws also depends<lb/> on improving the rights of foreign workers. Promoting high value-added industries and Malaysia as an education<lb/> hub requires policies to attract and retain talented people, which are linked to broader immigration policies.<lb/> Like other middle-income economies, Malaysia seeks to attract or retain highly educated and skilled labour but<lb/> mainly attracts low-skilled immigrants and sees many educated Malaysians emigrate. Policies towards low-skilled<lb/> immigration are becoming increasingly restrictive as perceptions increase that it puts Malaysian workers at a<lb/> disadvantage, despite evidence to the contrary (<ref type="biblio">World Bank, 2015</ref>). The 11th Malaysia plan introduced the first-ever<lb/> cap on all foreign migrant workers at 15% of the total workforce by 2020. At the same time, a specialised agency<lb/> (TalentCorp) is tasked to attract skilled workers from overseas, utilising process streamlining and tax incentives to<lb/> lure expatriate Malaysians back home. Yet high and low skilled labour cannot be completely divorced from each other,<lb/> with the overall immigration environment a potential influence on skilled labour and business decision-making.<lb/> To attract high-skilled labour, TalentCorp helps match skilled migrants to employment opportunities, cuts<lb/> through red tape and provides one-stop services for skilled migrants living and working in Malaysia. Eligible skilled<lb/> migrants are provided with a range of benefits that provide stability and certainty, including a ten-year pass to live and work<lb/> in the country, flexibility to move from one employer to another, eligibility for their spouse to work, and a clearer path to<lb/> permanent residency for themselves and family members. Tax incentives are also provided but are likely to be little more<lb/> than sweeteners relative to these incentives. Immigration of high-skilled workers is low volume, uncontroversial and for<lb/> some industries benefits from mutual recognition of planned qualifications within ASEAN.<lb/></p>

			<p>In contrast, policies regarding low-skilled foreign workers are high volume and politically charged, resulting in<lb/> migration being more difficult to manage. Registered foreign workers accounted for 17% of total employment in 2014,<lb/> while the share is estimated to be 27% if undocumented foreign workers are taken into account. Indeed, 2.5 million<lb/> unregistered foreign workers applied for regularisation in 2011 (OECD, 2012a). A large portion of registered foreign<lb/> workers were engaged on a short-term basis in the manufacturing (36%), agriculture (23%) and construction (20%)<lb/> sectors, reflecting restrictions on employment in many services sectors. Approximately one-third of the agricultural,<lb/> manufacturing and construction workforce are migrants (ILO, 2016). Official planning documents, domestic<lb/> commentators and to some extent industry see an enduring reliance on informal low-cost and low-skilled foreign<lb/> workers as contributing to slower than desirable industrial upgrading and lower wage growth, though a causal link is<lb/> difficult to substantiate. As noted previously, policies to align domestic and foreign worker rights through minimum wages<lb/> and conditions are welcome but incompletely implemented and enforced (ILO, 2016). In addition to the 15% quota on migrant<lb/> workers, increasingly high levies on migrant workers have further sought to reduce incentives to hire these workers and<lb/> provide a financial barrier to prospective employers of migrants. The government attempted to drastically increase levies in<lb/> early 2016, but has reduced the size of the hike following protests from employers. Malaysia has also bolstered regulations<lb/> covering the employment and conditions of foreign workers, although the minimum wage does not apply to domestic<lb/> helpers, who are mostly foreign workers. It has set up a single-window system for employers to apply for worker permits<lb/> to encourage formalisation and has strengthened laws against the employers of undocumented foreign workers. However,<lb/> these measures do not appear to have been effective in managing migration patterns or community attitudes to foreign<lb/> workers.<lb/></p>

			<p>The limited effectiveness of existing measures is not surprising, as they fall short of a considered approach to<lb/> immigration policy underpinned by well-aligned incentives and penalties. Frequent policy changes provide little<lb/> certainty for prospective migrants or businesses and only serve to exacerbate challenges in facilitating cooperation<lb/> from either stakeholder. The absence of a clear path to permanent migration for low-skilled workers and a<lb/> compliance system overly dependent on business disempowers government and migrants and provides<lb/> opportunities for business exploitation. Further government commitments to introduce a strict liability concept,<lb/> whereby employers of foreign workers are fully responsible for migrant recruitment and welfare, may further<lb/> exacerbate these concerns and consolidate business dominance over immigration policy. Ineffective<lb/> management of community attitudes to immigration is also not endearing the cooperation of migrant and business<lb/> stakeholders. Malaysia should urgently fulfil its commitment to develop a comprehensive immigration and<lb/> employment policy for migrant workers to provide stability, certainty and coherence to immigration policy.<lb/></p>

			<head>ECO/WKP(2017)3<lb/> Malaysia&apos;s social protection expenditure is low for its development stage<lb/></head>

			<p>Malaysia&apos;s social protection expenditure is lower than in all Southeast Asian countries for which data<lb/> are available and than in all but a handful of countries in the Asia-Pacific region (ADB, 2015). Public<lb/> expenditure on social protection as a proportion of GDP typically rises in step with GDP per capita, as has<lb/> been the case for OECD countries. This has not been the case in Malaysia (<ref type="figure">Figure 8</ref>).<lb/> The low level of social protection expenditure is further reflected in the low redistributive<lb/> power of the tax-and-transfer system: pre and post-tax and transfer Gini coefficients for income barely<lb/> differ, like in Turkey (OECD, 2012b; <ref type="figure">Figure 9</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<p>Subsidies that artificially kept down fuel, food and transport prices were by far the largest transfer<lb/> to households prior to their substantial removal in 2014 (amounting to around MYR 24 billion or 4% of<lb/> nominal GDP in 2013). Pension payments to retired civil servants are now the largest transfer, benefiting<lb/> a small set of comparatively well-off households. Neither of these are a transfer that targets social<lb/> welfare to low-income households.<lb/></p>

			<figure>Figure 8. Social expenditure in Malaysia has not increased in step with GDP per capita<lb/> Source: OECD (2016), Social spending (indicator), http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/7497563b-en; ADB, Statistical Database<lb/> System.<lb/></figure>

			<p>A key priority is the introduction of an employment insurance scheme that integrates job-matching<lb/> services, reskilling and income smoothing to prevent a temporary setback from becoming an entrenched<lb/> disadvantage. The government has proposed an employer-and-employee-funded Employment Insurance<lb/> System based on the set-up in Japan and Korea, but the proposed funding model is opposed by the social<lb/> partners, pointing to the merits of considering financing it through general tax revenue, as in Australia. The<lb/> overall experience of OECD countries suggests that in practice, employer, employee and<lb/> government co-financing is often required. The proposed scheme would provide the unemployed with<lb/> allowances for job placement and retraining and early re-employment incentives. While suitable for<lb/> Malaysia&apos;s immediate need to improve support for the temporarily unemployed, a more<lb/> comprehensive scheme that also includes temporary income smoothing payments would further reduce<lb/> financial barriers to re-employment and overall income inequality. It would also encourage increased<lb/> productivity by providing a safety net for entrepreneurial risk-taking and labour mobility.<lb/></p>

			<head>Fragmentation of programmes and institutions results in poorly targeted support<lb/></head>

			<p>Social expenditure is highly fragmented, being provided through a multitude of small-scale, specific-<lb/>purpose programmes by a diverse range of ministries. The Ministry of Women, Family and<lb/> Community Development is the lead agency for social support programmes targeting extreme poverty<lb/> and workforce participation support for disabled persons and women. Social support for farmers,<lb/> subsidised diesel for fishermen and rice rations for poor families are provided by the Ministry of<lb/> Agriculture and Agro-based Industry, support programmes and incentives for poor students by the<lb/> Ministry of Education, medical support through the Ministry of Health and so on. The introduction of cash<lb/> payments for families under the BR1M (1Malaysia People&apos;s Aid) programme has added the Ministry of<lb/> Finance as an additional direct stakeholder in social expenditure. At the same time, the &quot; eKasih &quot; database<lb/> developed to improve the registration and targeting of social welfare recipients is maintained within the<lb/> Implementation Coordination Unit under the Prime Minister&apos;s Department. The implementation of the<lb/> proposed employment insurance scheme would add the Ministry of Human Resources to an<lb/> increasingly disjointed social protection system that is prohibitively difficult for potential recipients to<lb/> navigate.<lb/> Key pillars among the range of social support programmes are 1AZAM, the eKasih database and<lb/> BR1M. 1AZAM is a flagship programme focused on providing income-generating opportunities for<lb/> low-income households, reducing their reliance on government support. It typifies Malaysia&apos;s<lb/> employment-oriented approach to social welfare (which includes providing higher income support to<lb/> employed than unemployed disabled persons) and represents a successful example of inter-agency<lb/> collaboration to tackle pockets of poverty (particularly in rural areas). The eKasih database is a critical<lb/> enabler of social protection targeting, supporting the identification of impoverished households and<lb/> connecting them with assistance programmes. Continued efforts to improve the database will support<lb/> the effectiveness of social protection policy-making and programme implementation. Since 2012, the<lb/> BR1M programme has provided cash payments to lower-income households to ease cost-of-living<lb/> pressures. While increasing each year, the BR1M programme allocation of MYR 5.9 billion in 2016 is far<lb/> smaller, though better targeted, than the value of the discontinued fuel and food subsidies. Into its fifth<lb/> year, the BR1M programme remains ad hoc and irregular in its payment arrangements, providing little<lb/> financial certainty for low-income households while jarring with the employment emphasis of other<lb/> programmes. A more considered approach to BR1M and social protection programmes more broadly is<lb/></p>

			<figure>ECO/WKP(2017)3<lb/> 20<lb/> needed to improve the consistency of objectives, programme targeting and the overall impact on reducing<lb/> disadvantage.<lb/></figure>

			<p>Beyond government, civil society makes an important contribution to social expenditure in<lb/> Malaysia. As the size of this contribution increases, the effectiveness of Islamic institutions supporting<lb/> the collection and distribution of Zakat and collaboration with government will be critical to optimising<lb/> overall social expenditure (Box 2).<lb/></p>

			<head>Towards a comprehensive social safety net<lb/></head>

			<p>It is essential that Malaysia develop a comprehensive social protection and income transfer system<lb/> that provides targeted and timely support to those in need, while retaining strong incentives and facilitation<lb/> mechanisms to maximise labour market participation. This requires more than filling gaps with new and<lb/> often contradictory programmes, and calls for undertaking a comprehensive assessment of social protection<lb/> needs and optimal strategies to meet them.<lb/> Experience suggests there is no one-size-fits-all approach to social protection systems, which<lb/> need to be suited to country circumstances. However, a well-designed system would complement the<lb/> strong incentives to engage in productive employment that exist in Malaysia, while supporting<lb/> inclusiveness through income redistribution and employment facilitation mechanisms for low-income<lb/> households, unemployed, sick, disabled and elderly persons.<lb/></p>

			<head>Box 2. The contribution of Zakat to social expenditure in Malaysia<lb/></head>

			<p>One of the five fundamental obligations of Islam is that Muslims contribute a proportion of their income and wealth<lb/> to a compulsory charitable mechanism called Zakat, with funds redistributed to households as supplementary income<lb/> to alleviate poverty. Every Malaysian state has its own institution responsible for collecting Zakat and making<lb/> redistributions in accordance with its own Zakat poverty line, which is determined on a similar income basis to<lb/> government poverty lines.<lb/> The contribution of Zakat to social expenditure has increased significantly in recent years, in absolute terms<lb/> and in proportion to GDP (<ref type="figure">Figure 10</ref>). Importantly from the perspective of expenditure consistency and timeliness, the<lb/> growth in Zakat collections is not proportional to GDP but holds up well during times of economic turbulence, when it<lb/> is most needed. In 2013, Zakat represented over 20% of the level of government social spending excluding<lb/> health, making it a major contributor to Malaysia&apos;s overall social expenditure.<lb/></p>

			<figure>Figure 10. Zakat has been expanding rapidly<lb/> Note: Social expenditure in Panel B includes central government expenditure on social security and welfare and zakat expenditure.<lb/> Source: Department of Awqaf, Zakat and Hajj (JAWHAR); ADB (2016), Statistical Database System.<lb/> Recent growth in the size of collections has prompted additional research evaluating the effectiveness of Zakat as<lb/> a social expenditure mechanism (Johari et al., 2015). While effective in alleviating poverty by supplementing the<lb/> income of benefiting households by as much as 30%, studies have identified numerous ways to increase Zakat<lb/> collections, distributional targeting and the professionalism of institutional governance. Among priority areas for<lb/> ECO/WKP(2017)3<lb/> 21<lb/> improvement are delays in the distribution of funds, the need for modern collection methodologies (such as internet<lb/> banking) and disbursement for income-generation activities (rather than income supplements).<lb/></figure>

			<p>Greater collaboration between state-level Zakat centres, state and federal governments could further assist in<lb/> reducing duplication and the effective targeting of assistance to impoverished households. Localised Zakat<lb/> administration can help identify and address local needs but lacks the redistributive capacity of national<lb/> administration. Indeed, Zakat collections and therefore redistributions are significantly higher in wealthier states,<lb/> limiting the ability to target pockets of poverty in poorer states. The development of a national social<lb/> protection system should maximise complementarities between government expenditure and the increasingly<lb/> significant role of Zakat.<lb/></p>

			<p>Setting up such a system will require an initial scoping study to map existing programmes and<lb/> comprehensively identify the vulnerable in need of social protection, including an analysis of the<lb/> determinants of vulnerability and the needs of affected persons. The end goal is a single strategy<lb/> with implementation supported by clear institutional responsibilities and capacity, including in relation<lb/> to the ongoing monitoring and evaluation of system performance. Malaysia could utilise global best<lb/> practice toolkits such as the Inter Agency Social Protection Assessments toolkit (ISPA, 2016) and draw<lb/> lessons from the OECD Development Centre&apos;s work to develop social protection systems in the region<lb/> (OECD, 2016). ISPA provides a framework for countries to analyse the strengths and weaknesses of the<lb/> overall social protection system, including policies, programmes and administration. It provides a platform<lb/> for collaboration between government agencies to develop a common vision for social protection systems<lb/> and ensure a consistent, inter-agency approach to system development, implementation and evaluation.<lb/> A comprehensive social protection system would complement the implementation of other policy<lb/> priorities identified in this paper. For example, income smoothing for unemployed persons would be<lb/> conducive to formalisation of the labour force, allowing for improved targeting of employment facilitation<lb/> and retraining programmes, a broader income tax base, and increased innovation and entrepreneurship by<lb/> lowering the potential cost of risk-taking.<lb/></p>

			<head>A tax and transfer system that supports inclusive growth<lb/></head>

			<p>Malaysia&apos;s tax and transfer system can do more for inclusive growth, with overall tax collection and<lb/> redistribution both low by OECD and global standards. As Malaysia approaches high-income<lb/> country status and as its society ages, higher tax revenue will be needed to fund growing fiscal expenditure.<lb/> Low global oil prices together with an increasingly services sector and domestic demand driven<lb/> economy have prompted a prudent rebalancing of Malaysia&apos;s revenue base, but further reforms are needed to<lb/> improve medium-term fiscal sustainability. Reforms are needed to increase the overall tax base, improve the<lb/> balance of its composition and provide additional resources for programmes promoting inclusive growth.<lb/> The complexity of the interactions between the recent and the possible additional reforms points to the need<lb/> for an overall review of the tax base as part of a broader review of medium-term fiscal sustainability.<lb/></p>

			<head>Reversing the decline in revenue collection<lb/></head>

			<p>Low global oil prices have seen oil-related revenue decline substantially in recent years, with its<lb/> share in overall revenue estimated to have halved between 2014 and 2016, to under 15%. Declining oil-<lb/>related revenue is the latest contribution to a more concerning longer-term structural decline in the overall<lb/> tax base. From around 20% of GDP prior to the Asian Financial Crisis, tax revenue has fallen throughout<lb/> the 2000s to around 15% of GDP today (<ref type="figure">Figure 11</ref>). Tax revenue as a share of GDP is less than half the<lb/> 34% OECD average and trending downwards. This evolution contrasts with the experience of other<lb/> countries with rising income levels.<lb/></p>

			<figure>Faced with declining oil-related revenue, Malaysia has mainly acted on the spending side to achieve<lb/> fiscal consolidation. Nonetheless, some difficult tax reforms have been implemented to reduce the rate of<lb/> ECO/WKP(2017)3<lb/> 22<lb/> revenue decline, including the introduction of the GST in April 2015 as well as an increase in the top<lb/> marginal income tax rate from 25% to 28%. Intensifying popular concerns with rising cost-of-living<lb/> pressures have more recently reversed the momentum for tax reform, prompting an expansion of the number<lb/> of exempt or zero-rated GST items and a series of new income and corporate tax deductions.<lb/></figure>

			<p>Additional revenue is necessary to support medium-term fiscal sustainability and make room for<lb/> increased spending on social protection, healthcare, infrastructure and communications technology in<lb/> rural areas and green growth. Malaysia&apos;s recently adopted medium-term fiscal framework will need to<lb/> incorporate a sustainable revenue trajectory that appropriately funds reform priorities.<lb/></p>

			<figure>Figure 11. The share of tax revenue in GDP is low and declining<lb/> Source: OECD (2015a), Revenue Statistics in Asian Countries 2015: Trends in Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines,<lb/> http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/ 9789264234277-en (for the years 1990-2013); MOF (2015), Economic Report 2015-2016 (for the<lb/> years 2014-16).<lb/></figure>

			<head>Indirect taxes and the GST in perspective<lb/></head>

			<p>Indirect tax collections have declined over the past 25 years, with the revenue increase from the<lb/> recently-introduced GST providing only a partial offset. Sales tax revenue as a proportion of GDP is less<lb/> than half the early 1990s levels (<ref type="figure">Figure 11</ref>). Malaysia&apos;s opening to trade through the gradual reduction of<lb/> tariffs and duties provide a partial explanation. However, despite an increasing share of consumption<lb/> in GDP since the late 1990s, a combination of reduced tax rates and rising tax evasion has caused an<lb/> erosion of the indirect tax intake. Reversing this trend in the context of rising cost-of-living pressures will<lb/> be difficult but necessary.<lb/></p>

			<p>Consumption taxes are potentially quite important to the overall tax mix given the size of the<lb/> informal household sector, which includes an estimated 1.7 million undocumented foreign<lb/> workers, and to tax around 350 000 Malaysian residents commuting to work in Singapore.<lb/> Implementation of the GST has been more successful than anticipated, with a high rate of business<lb/> compliance boosting collections beyond original projections. Recent research on OECD countries also<lb/> indicates that greater use of simple, broad-based consumption taxes can be beneficial in reducing<lb/> compliance costs and distortions to consumption decisions arising from differential rate systems, while also<lb/> being proportional or slightly progressive when measured as a percentage of household expenditure<lb/> (OECD/Korea Institute of Public <ref type="biblio">Finance, 2014</ref>). In fact, there is ample scope for the GST to raise further<lb/> revenue. The initial rate of 6% is low by regional and broader international standards (<ref type="figure">Figure 12</ref>), while<lb/> increasingly extensive exemptions have reduced its effectiveness. For some zero-rated goods, the<lb/> introduction of the GST has actually resulted in a decline in the tax rate with the concurrent repeal<lb/> of the preceding sales tax. There is ample room for a gradual series of increases to bring</p>

			<figure>Malaysia&apos;s GST<lb/> rate into line with regional peers and OECD countries. Reducing the number of exempt or zero-rated<lb/> ECO/WKP(2017)3<lb/> 23<lb/> items and strengthening tax enforcement would help reduce tax leakage in the short term, while<lb/> consideration could be given to a gradual increase in the rate of the GST over the medium term.<lb/> Figure 12. The GST rate is low by international standards<lb/></figure>

			<head>A more progressive income tax system with a broader base<lb/></head>

			<p>Malaysia has traditionally sourced a large proportion of tax revenue from corporate income and<lb/> profits taxes, in particular through taxes on profitable state-owned oil companies (<ref type="figure">Figure 11</ref>).<lb/> Declining oil revenue in recent years has rendered this model unsustainable and highlighted the need to<lb/> diversify the tax base. Opportunities still exist to adjust corporate tax settings where these would<lb/> support broader industrial and environmental objectives.<lb/> Besides, Malaysia&apos;s income tax and transfer system does very little to enhance inclusiveness<lb/> through tax schedule progressivity or redistribution, as evidenced by almost identical before and after tax<lb/> and transfer Gini coefficients (<ref type="figure">Figure 9</ref>). A more progressive income tax schedule would complement the<lb/> development of a comprehensive social protection system in reducing income inequality.<lb/> Middle-income earners need to become taxpayers, with less than 10% of Malaysians over 15 years<lb/> old actually paying income tax. That personal income tax is only levied at a very high income threshold<lb/> compared to the average wage and the size of the informal sector are both part of the explanation. A<lb/> combination of higher tax rates and narrower tax bands throughout the schedule would raise the average<lb/> tax levied on middle and high-income earners, while exemptions or transfers could be used to protect<lb/> low-income households.<lb/></p>

			<p>The top marginal tax rate for very-high-income earners was recently raised to 28% but remains well<lb/> below top rates of between 45% and 55% in higher-income OECD countries (OECD Tax Database).<lb/></p>

			<figure>Combined with significant tax incentives for high-income returning expatriates – who may be eligible for a<lb/> flat 15% income tax rate for five years -income taxes levy too small a contribution from Malaysia&apos;s richest.<lb/> Raising the highest marginal tax rate further could contribute to raising average taxes on high-income<lb/> earners, while the generosity and effectiveness of tax incentives offered to encourage expatriates to<lb/> return should be reviewed in terms of costs and benefits.<lb/> Taxes on capital income as well as on capital gains, in particular in relation to property, contribute<lb/> little to the current tax base. The high proportion of home ownership, while in some ways supportive of<lb/> inclusive growth, suggests incentives to invest (including low tax rates) are skewing household investment<lb/> towards property. Even minor increases in taxes on capital income and gains from property could raise<lb/> ECO/WKP(2017)3<lb/> 24<lb/> significant revenue given the size of the potential base, while at the same time improving the progressivity<lb/> of the tax system. Property taxes are also underutilised, with ongoing taxes based on the value of the<lb/> property another possible means to achieve similar objectives. Additionally, with constitutional<lb/> responsibility for property taxes with state governments, reform in this area could support fiscal<lb/> decentralisation.<lb/></figure>

			<p>Malaysia also does not levy inheritance, estate or gift taxes. There is a clear case on distributional<lb/> grounds for taxing wealth transfers on death as a means of reducing long-run inequality, both by reducing<lb/> and dispersing wealth holdings and increasing equality of opportunity. Despite their merits, inheritance<lb/> taxes are underutilised globally, with low rates and numerous exemptions typical where they exist.<lb/> France and Belgium provide examples of successful systems, and yield fiscal revenue of around 0.5% of<lb/> GDP (<ref type="biblio">Brys et al., 2016</ref>). Inheritance taxes can be designed as a tax on the donor&apos;s estate or on the recipients,<lb/> with inheritance taxes on the recipient the most consistent with inclusive growth. Differentiated<lb/> rates could be applied depending on the relation between the donor and the recipient, with a minimum<lb/> amount of the inherited wealth typically exempt from tax. An accompanying gift tax is often utilised to<lb/> minimise avoidance of the inheritance tax through pre-death transfers, with appropriate exemptions<lb/> to prevent non-avoidance related gifts from bearing a tax burden (for example, for gifts made more than<lb/> five years before death). Introducing taxes on the transfer of wealth under these circumstances would<lb/> not only reinforce the tax base but promote tax progressivity and reduce wealth inequality (<ref type="biblio">Brys et al.,<lb/> 2016</ref>).<lb/> Malaysia is also working to address issues of international tax avoidance. Malaysia is participating in<lb/> regional network discussions under the OECD base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) project, with the<lb/> Malaysian Inland Revenue Board currently undertaking a review of tax legislation in light of the BEPS<lb/> project. A BEPS Action Committee has been established, with Malaysia prepared to revise tax<lb/> legislation in accordance with international standards to the extent such standards are applicable and<lb/> relevant to the Malaysian context.<lb/></p>

			<head>A more sustainable pension system that delivers higher retirement incomes<lb/></head>

			<p>Malaysia has a longstanding dual-track pension system consisting of a non-contributory<lb/> defined benefit scheme for public sector workers (the Malaysian Public Sector Pension Scheme) and a<lb/> defined contribution system for the private sector (the Employees Provident Fund scheme). The public<lb/> scheme is funded from consolidated tax revenue, while the Employees Provident Fund (EPF) is the<lb/> publicly-owned monopoly superannuation fund responsible for managing the contributions of private<lb/> sector and non-pensionable public sector employees (such as persons hired on a contractual basis). The<lb/> EPF is one of the world&apos;s largest pension funds with MYR 667 billion (approximately USD 171 billion or<lb/> 58% of GDP in 2015) in assets under management as of mid-2015 (EPF, 2016).<lb/> A particular challenge for inclusive growth in transitioning towards high-income country status<lb/> is balancing growth in consumption and investment today while provisioning for sustainable living<lb/> standards in the future. The rapidly ageing population is already beginning to test the effectiveness of<lb/> Malaysia&apos;s pension system: the burden of financing generous public sector pensions is increasingly<lb/> unsustainable and replacement rates for private sector retirees who otherwise receive little systematic<lb/> support through other social protection programmes are inadequate. Reforms to strengthen the fiscal<lb/> sustainability of the public scheme and increase the adequacy of retirement living standards under<lb/> the private scheme are increasingly necessary.<lb/></p>

			<head>A more sustainable approach for public service pensions<lb/></head>

			<p>Like a number of OECD countries, Malaysia has an increasingly unsustainable public sector pension<lb/> system that offers more generous retirement incomes than afforded to private sector workers. Workers<lb/> retiring after 30 or more years of service receive a guaranteed ongoing pension equal to 60% of their<lb/> ECO/WKP(2017)3<lb/> 25<lb/> final salary (excluding allowances), a lump-sum worth more than two years&apos; salary and free or subsidised<lb/> medical benefits for life. This implies a more-than-adequate effective replacement rate of around 80% of<lb/> final salary. Pensions are financed through general tax revenue – including the anticipated contribution<lb/> of Retirement Fund Incorporated established in 2007 to invest a portion of government funds set aside<lb/> for pensions – and employees do not explicitly contribute a portion of their salary to fund the scheme.<lb/></p>

			<p>With pension expenditure having tripled in the past ten years to reach MYR 18 billion in 2015 (1.6%<lb/> of GDP) and a long way from peaking due to the burgeoning civil service headcount (up to 1.6 million<lb/> in 2015 from 0.98 million in 2000), a more sustainable system is urgently needed. Moving new employees<lb/> into a defined contribution scheme would help limit future pension liabilities to existing and former<lb/> employees, with legacy benefits paid out of a fully-financed separate fund. For equity reasons, it would be<lb/> desirable to transfer the new employees into the existing defined contribution scheme for private<lb/> sector employees. A transparent transition period with a one-off wage increase would help maintain<lb/> the attractiveness of the public sector, compensating for the effective reduction in overall benefits. This in<lb/> turn necessitates creating a dual-track system for all existing employees; that is, maintaining existing<lb/> pension benefits based on salary net of contributions, while creating a defined contribution account,<lb/> the balance of which would be deducted from the lump-sum calculation under existing pension rules.<lb/> While the one-off wage increase would not affect disposable income and therefore would not be expected to<lb/> have a significant impact on consumption, the transition would involve an increase in upfront government<lb/> expenditure on pensions (through the commencement of explicit contributions) that should be assessed<lb/> against the expected gains from reducing future liabilities. Reforms for public employees should also be<lb/> complemented by concurrent reforms to increase the robustness of the defined contribution system<lb/> (discussed below).<lb/></p>

			<head>Raising the effective retirement age to account for rapid population ageing<lb/></head>

			<p>Pension system sustainability requires careful long-term planning in anticipation of expected<lb/> demographic trends. While Malaysia&apos;s population structure is relatively young at present, it can expect to<lb/> experience rapid ageing, with a projected doubling from 7% to 14% of the proportion of the population<lb/> aged over 65 in just 20 years (<ref type="biblio">World Bank, 2016</ref>) – by comparison it took the United Kingdom and the<lb/> United States 45 and 69 years respectively. On current trends, Malaysia could expect to reach aged nation<lb/> status (where the share of the population over 60 years old exceeds 15%) around 2030-35, with the next<lb/> 15-20 years critical to developing a sustainable pension and broader social protection system for<lb/> elderly persons.<lb/> As life expectancy continues to increase and an increasing proportion of the population spend<lb/> more time in higher education before entering the workforce, all else remaining equal, a decreasing<lb/> number of working years would be expected to fund a longer retirement. Malaysia will face something<lb/> similar to the experience of high-income OECD countries, where system sustainability and the adequacy<lb/> of replacement rates will come under substantial strain in the absence of forward planning.<lb/></p>

			<p>Malaysians can already expect a long retirement compared to residents of both OECD countries and<lb/> countries in the region (<ref type="figure">Figure 13</ref>). Despite being raised by five years in 2013, Malaysia&apos;s official<lb/> retirement age of 60 remains below the OECD average of 64 in 2014. Moreover, by not simultaneously<lb/> adjusting upward the withdrawal age for private sector workers under the EPF, the effective retirement<lb/> age remains at 55. Malaysia should consider an immediate alignment of the EPF withdrawal age with the<lb/> retirement age with transitional arrangements for current or imminent retirees, while developing a broader<lb/> strategy to progressively raise its official retirement age and the EPF withdrawal age in line with expected<lb/> changes in healthy life expectancy. Consultation between the EPF and its members on withdrawal age<lb/> increases indicates that changes will need be done cautiously and effectively communicated, as individual<lb/> awareness of retirement adequacy is low.<lb/></p>

			<figure>ECO/WKP(2017)3<lb/> 26<lb/> Figure 13. Malaysians can expect a lengthy retirement<lb/> Note: The data for OECD countries and China is for 2014, 2012 for all other countries.<lb/> Source: OECD (2013b), Pensions at a Glance Asia-Pacific 2013, http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/pension_asia-2013-en; OECD<lb/> (2015c), Pensions at a Glance 2015, http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/pension_glance-2015-en.<lb/></figure>

			<head>Options to improve replacement rates<lb/></head>

			<p>The net replacement rate for a Malaysian male of average income was 41% in 2012, while the net<lb/> replacement rate for a Malaysian male earning half the level of average income was 40.3% (OECD,<lb/> 2013b). By comparison, the OECD average for these indicators was 68.3% and 79.5% respectively in<lb/> 2014, with a replacement rate of around 70% of average income considered a reasonable benchmark for<lb/> pension system adequacy (OECD, 2015d) (<ref type="figure">Figure 14</ref>). EPF data indicates that 70% of 54-year old<lb/> members would not have enough savings to meet basic retirement needs if they retired at age 55, while<lb/> half of all retirees exhaust their savings in just five years. System immaturity is not an issue for<lb/> Malaysia&apos;s longstanding retirement system; it is the system settings that are delivering inadequate<lb/> retirement incomes, with B40 households especially vulnerable. Replacement rates under the private sector<lb/> scheme would not be expected to reach OECD levels in the absence of reforms.<lb/></p>

			<p>The generous provision permitting early withdrawals ahead of the official retirement age and for<lb/> certain current consumption activities (housing, education, medical and religious reasons), undermines a<lb/> system designed to provide for retirement income. Compared to lowering mandatory contribution rates<lb/> by 30% -equivalent to the share of contributions that can be withdrawn before age 55 –the system of early<lb/> withdrawals adds bureaucracy and limits consumption opportunities for low-income households<lb/> post-retirement. Tightening the system for early withdrawals would boost system integrity and ultimately<lb/> improve replacement rates.<lb/></p>

			<figure>ECO/WKP(2017)3<lb/> 27<lb/> Figure 14. Pension replacement rates are low<lb/> Note: The data are for 2012 for Malaysia and for 2014 for OECD countries. The source publications assume investment returns of 3.5%<lb/> per annum for Malaysia, whereas a 3% per annum return was assumed for OECD countries.<lb/> Source: OECD (2013b), Pensions at a Glance Asia-Pacific 2013, http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/pension_asia-2013-en; OECD (2015c),<lb/> Pensions at a Glance 2015, http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/pension_glance-2015-en.<lb/></figure>

			<p>Furthermore, replacement rates lack progressivity, implying that the pension system does relatively<lb/> little to boost the retirement incomes of low-income workers. The aforementioned reforms to improve<lb/> the progressivity of income distribution pre-and post-retirement would also contribute to Malaysian<lb/> replacement rates converging to OECD standards.<lb/> In addition, reliance on a single, publicly-owned fund for the investment of pension contributions<lb/> appears to be lowering replacement rates through lower average investment returns. As a public institution,<lb/> the EPF&apos;s mandate contains investment restrictions that limit its ability to maximise returns,<lb/> resulting in an investment strategy that is conservative by global standards (51% of total investment<lb/> is in fixed-income products including Malaysian Government Securities). Since 2013, tax exemptions have<lb/> been offered to encourage individuals to invest in Private Retirement Schemes outside of the EPF, but the<lb/> take-up rate has been low. Further efforts to open the pension market to competition from alternative<lb/> providers and to liberalise restrictions on EPF investment would improve replacement rates over the<lb/> long term.<lb/></p>

			<head>High contribution rates contribute to informality, low saving and reduced consumption growth<lb/></head>

			<p>Mandatory contributions to the EPF for the majority of private-sector workers ordinarily<lb/> amount to 23-24% of wages: an 11% employee contribution plus a 12-13% employer contribution. The<lb/> employee contribution was temporarily reduced to 8% until the end of 2017 as a 2016 Budget revision<lb/> measure to boost short-term growth, but employees can choose to opt out of the reduction.<lb/> Malaysia&apos;s usual mandatory contribution rate is above the OECD average of 20.3% in 2014 and<lb/> towards the upper end of pension contribution rates in the Asia-Pacific region. Malaysia&apos;s high<lb/> contribution rates are in part a product of its overall approach to taxes, transfers and social expenditure,<lb/> with the pension system required to do more heavy lifting than in many countries. Although there is no<lb/> single global standard rate, with the optimal contribution level depending on the particular<lb/> circumstances of the country, Malaysia&apos;s contribution rates are high for its income level. According to one<lb/> global pension system indicator, which compares the adequacy, sustainability and integrity of pension<lb/> systems, the top three ranked countries have rates of 13.4% (Denmark), 20.9% (Netherlands)<lb/> and 9.5% (Australia) (<ref type="biblio">Mercer and Australian Centre for Financial Studies, 2015</ref>).<lb/> At around 60%, Malaysia&apos;s low pension coverage rate as a proportion of its labour force indicates that<lb/> high contribution rates may be deterring the entrance of workers into the formal sector. Labour force<lb/> ECO/WKP(2017)3<lb/> 28<lb/> formalisation would improve the effectiveness of government policies including tax and social welfare,<lb/> with lower pension contribution rates for low-income workers one way to realign incentives to encourage<lb/> formalisation. As a benchmark for pension coverage, Malaysia could seek convergence with the OECD<lb/> average of around 86% in 2014.<lb/></p>

			<p>The low rate of household saving may also indicate that contribution rates are too high for the current<lb/> level of household income. Household saving averaged around 1.5% of disposable income in 2013 or<lb/> -5.8% if mandatory contribution rates are excluded, indicating that Malaysian households are<lb/> borrowing heavily against their deferred income. While EPF returns have exceeded average borrowing costs<lb/> since 2009, the cost of servicing these debts may ultimately exceed the returns on pension earnings.<lb/> Evaluating whether contribution rates are appropriate in balancing current and future consumption needs<lb/> should also form part of discussions on pension reform, subject to broader consideration of complementary<lb/> policies for social protection.<lb/></p>

			<head>Maintaining universal access to quality healthcare<lb/></head>

			<p>An accessible healthcare system that supports increasing healthy life expectancy is not only integral<lb/> to well-being and inclusiveness, but is a necessary condition for a productive labour force. Malaysia&apos;s<lb/> significant investment in public healthcare has complemented broader initiatives to alleviate poverty in<lb/> tackling premature mortality. This has contributed to life expectancy increasing from 64.6 years in 1966<lb/> to 74.7 in 2014. Although Malaysia&apos;s life expectancy is still below the OECD average, it performs as well<lb/> as the top 30% of OECD member countries in terms of the quality of self-reported health. Over the same<lb/> period, improved maternal and child healthcare has markedly reduced infant mortality per 1000 live births<lb/> from 75.5 to 6.6.<lb/> Malaysia provides universal healthcare through a heavily subsidised public system, supplemented by<lb/> private healthcare for people who can afford it. Public system patients pay a nominal sum for treatment,<lb/> while fees for private healthcare services are paid fully out-of-pocket by the patients themselves, their<lb/> employers, or insurance companies (PEMANDU, 2012). The public share of healthcare expenditure was<lb/> 55% in 2014, while the respective shares of private system patients&apos; out-of-pocket expenditure and<lb/> private insurance were 79% and 14% of private healthcare expenditure, as private health insurance markets<lb/> have low saturation.<lb/></p>

			<head>Addressing the increasing burden on the public system<lb/></head>

			<p>High out-of-pocket expenditure for healthcare – representing 35% of total healthcare expenditure as<lb/> of 2014 compared to an OECD average of 14% – is contributing to polarisation in the provision of<lb/> healthcare services by socio-economic status (<ref type="figure">Figure 15</ref>). Use of private services increases with<lb/> household income, while dependence on public services increases the poorer the household. This is<lb/> especially the case for inpatients, who require more intensive care, as opposed to outpatients, who require<lb/> mainly primary care. Access to highly-subsidised public healthcare ensures low incidences of catastrophic<lb/> and impoverishing expenditures or deferral of medical treatment for financial reasons; however, it is<lb/> resulting in an overburdening of the public health system.<lb/> Many medical specialists have been leaving the public system to take better remunerated<lb/> positions in the private system, creating shortages of critical staff. On one estimation, almost 70% of<lb/> medical specialists are in the private sector, but only 30% of complicated cases requiring specialists are<lb/> managed there (<ref type="biblio">Syed, 2014</ref>). This lopsided allocation of medical specialists has led to rising incidences<lb/> of overcrowding, long waiting times, delayed consultation and late admission for emergency cases (EPU,<lb/> 2015c). It also reduces the inclusiveness of healthcare as private facilities are typically located in<lb/> wealthier urban areas.<lb/></p>

			<figure>ECO/WKP(2017)3<lb/> 29<lb/> Figure 15. Poor households are more reliant on public-sector health care services<lb/> Source: WHO Global Health Expenditure (database); IHSR (2013), Malaysia Health Care Demand Analysis: Inequalities in Healthcare<lb/> Demand &amp; Simulation of Trends and Impact of Potential Changes in Healthcare Spending.<lb/></figure>

			<p>Malaysia has taken steps to ease the burden on the urban public health system and improve access to<lb/> quality healthcare for low-income urban residents. The operational hours of some public outpatient<lb/> clinics have been extended to increase access to primary care, catering to the irregular working hours of<lb/> the urban poor. The government has also introduced &quot; cluster hospitals &quot; arrangements whereby facilities in<lb/> the same geographical location pool resources to better manage patient flows. Retention packages have<lb/> been developed to increase compensation and allow for flexible working arrangements as an incentive<lb/> for medical doctors and specialists to remain in the public system.<lb/></p>

			<p>Limited access remains an impediment to equitable universal healthcare in some rural areas.<lb/> Inadequate transport infrastructure, low economies of scale and low incentives for professionals to work in<lb/> rural and remote villages are among the challenges to the establishment of urban-equivalent facilities in<lb/> remote areas. Nonetheless, mobile clinics in the form of &quot; flying doctors &quot; and vehicle, boat and bus<lb/> equivalents help provide services in these areas and connectivity to urban facilities. Malaysia<lb/> continues to plan for the appropriate infrastructure and technologies necessary to ensure the optimal and<lb/> equitable provision of health services in these communities.<lb/></p>

			<p>The private system also suffers from a shortage of qualified professionals, most acutely with<lb/> respect to qualified nurses. In contrast to the migration of doctors to the private system, many trained<lb/> nurses have shifted to public hospitals attracted by better compensation packages and training<lb/> opportunities. Private hospitals find it difficult to send their nurses for post-basic training due to a<lb/></p>

			<figure>ECO/WKP(2017)3<lb/> 30<lb/> shortage in training capacity (MPC<ref type="biblio">, 2015</ref>). Despite the shortage of nurses in the private sector, 8 000<lb/> nursing graduates mainly from private colleges remained unemployed in 2012 due to a lack of<lb/> necessary skills, in particular communication skills, and inadequate training. As most government<lb/> hospitals have their feeder colleges, they are unable to employ graduates from the private nursing<lb/> colleges. Most private hospitals prefer to hire graduates from public universities, who are perceived to have<lb/> the necessary academic and employability skills (<ref type="biblio">Nalini, 2014</ref>). To narrow skills and job mismatches, an<lb/> integrated and well-structured programme encompassing universities, the government, and public and<lb/> private medical institutions is required, as is a long-term view of skills training and a more flexible<lb/> regulatory framework including with respect to labour conditions. For this purpose, the government and<lb/> private colleges offer post-basic training course for private-sector nurses.<lb/></p>

			<head>Enhancing the sustainability of the healthcare system<lb/></head>

			<p>Malaysia&apos;s total expenditure on health amounted to 4% of GDP in 2014, below other Southeast<lb/> Asian countries and the OECD average (<ref type="figure">Figure 16A</ref>). However, healthcare spending has outpaced GDP<lb/> since 2000 and is expected to increase in line with rising living standards, technological development<lb/> and the acceleration of population ageing (<ref type="figure">Figure 16B</ref>). Research on OECD and BRIICS countries<lb/> has shown that while income and ageing effects account for a large share of rising health expenditure,<lb/> health policies and institutions can help contain costs and provide opportunities to increase efficiency<lb/> (OECD, 2013c).<lb/> Enhancing effectiveness and efficiency will be key to ensuring the longer-term sustainability of<lb/> the healthcare system. Strengthening preventive health provision through primary care would reduce<lb/> recourse to more costly hospital care. Achieving high-quality primary care is a key priority in nearly every<lb/> OECD country, given the increasing prevalence of chronic illnesses, quicker discharges from hospitals and<lb/> rising public expectations of seamless, co-ordinated care. Establishing an integrated primary care system<lb/> employing the &quot; family doctor &quot; concept, which provides multi-disciplinary services including risk factor<lb/> identification, risk intervention packages and clinical management of diseases, is one way to achieve this<lb/> goal. Further efficiency gains could be achieved by implementing domiciliary healthcare in a<lb/> community setting to cater to patients requiring long-term nursing care upon early discharge from<lb/> hospital.<lb/></p>

			<figure>Simplifying and streamlining the regulatory framework would also deliver efficiency gains.<lb/> Streamlining licence renewal and accreditation of medical institutions could reduce transaction costs<lb/> (EPU, 2015c; MPC, 2015). Allowing public-sector hospitals greater autonomy in the allocation of<lb/> resources would also increase efficiency gains and better adapt healthcare services to local conditions.<lb/> Consistent with the ambitions of the Ministry of Health&apos;s ICT Strategic Plan 2016-2020, increased use<lb/> of information and communications technology (ICT) systems would promote efficiency gains by<lb/> enabling televisual primary care consultations (tele-primary care) and integrating the management of<lb/> patients&apos; health-related information (lifetime health records). Utilising the existing National Registration<lb/> Identity Card (MyKad) system in implementing the lifetime health record system would deliver<lb/> efficiency gains by exploiting synergies. Reforming the financing structure to ensure sustainability of the<lb/> healthcare system has long been a government target (OECD, 2015e</figure>

			<p>). Attempts to introduce a<lb/> public healthcare insurance system have not met with agreement among stakeholders, despite intensive<lb/> debates regarding cost sharing and the impact on quality and access to the services (<ref type="biblio">Leng and Hong,<lb/> 2014</ref>). Irrespective of whether public healthcare insurance is utilised in the future, rising healthcare costs<lb/> accompanying population ageing will need to be accounted for in fiscal planning (<ref type="biblio">Lee, 2015</ref>). In principle,<lb/> private health insurance could make a greater contribution to managing rising healthcare costs, reducing<lb/> the burden on the public healthcare system and driving improvements in preventive care. In practice,<lb/> private health insurance is voluntary in Malaysia, with a low uptake so far resulting in a modest overall<lb/> contribution to health expenditure and high out-of-pocket expenses for private healthcare (<ref type="figure">Figure 17</ref>). Tax<lb/> relief for premiums have sought to raise the contribution of private health insurance with limited<lb/> success, but as household incomes continue to rise renewed efforts could have more success. The<lb/> scarcity of net taxpaying households suggests a levy, such as a surcharge on high-income individuals<lb/> who do not take out private health insurance, would have a stronger incentive effect than tax relief. High-<lb/>income households would thereby contribute to either private healthcare through insurance or to<lb/> government revenue to fund the public system. An expanded private insurance market may also help<lb/> promote preventive care, as insurance providers in countries such as the United States and Australia<lb/> encourage utilisation of free or subsidised preventive health services to reduce future expenses.<lb/></p>

			<head>Narrowing the regional development gap<lb/></head>

			<p>Malaysia&apos;s rapid and relatively inclusive development since independence has achieved<lb/> impressive reductions in overall inequality. However, despite lower regional inequality being a priority<lb/> of Malaysia&apos;s economic and social development strategy, regional differences remain large and have<lb/> been widening in recent years. In 2014, the per capita GDP of Malaysia&apos;s richest state was almost eight<lb/> times that of the poorest, having widened significantly since 2011 (<ref type="figure">Figure 18</ref>.A). More broadly, the<lb/> socio-economic development gap is substantial, most notably in terms of relative income inequality,<lb/> healthcare and access to information (<ref type="figure">Figure 18</ref>.B).<lb/> Regional inequality reflects the combination of historical, geographical and socio-economic<lb/> factors that have favoured the development of western Peninsular Malaysia. These richer states have<lb/> benefited from their location on global trade routes, with trade and investment facilitating the rapid<lb/> development of industry and commerce. Growth in eastern Peninsular Malaysia and the Borneo Island<lb/> states has relied more on primary industries, with slower development of infrastructure and human capital.<lb/> These states are dominated by mountainous terrain or dense tropical rainforests, with challenging<lb/> geography and low population density creating impediments to the efficient provision of public services.<lb/> Despite these challenges, Malaysia has achieved near universal supply of reliable electricity and water<lb/> supply and is making significant investments in improving transport and telecommunications<lb/> infrastructure, education and healthcare. Even so, more can be done to further reduce regional<lb/> differences.<lb/> The 9th Malaysia Plan (2006-10) created five regional economic corridors focused on attracting<lb/> additional investment and creating jobs in target industries based on regional comparative advantages.<lb/> Federal government financial incentives and streamlined regulatory approvals are offered to fast-track<lb/> private sector investment and infrastructure improvements. Between 2011 and 2014, the corridors have<lb/> attracted almost MYR 175 billion in investment and created 427 000 jobs (<ref type="table">Table 1</ref>). The 11th Malaysia<lb/> Plan increased the focus on programmes to raise skills training and entrepreneurship, while also improving<lb/> the targeting of support to the needs of each economic corridor. For example, in the East Coast Economic<lb/> Region, the entrepreneurship development programme is targeting women and youth to address<lb/> relatively high unemployment of these persons in the region. The Sabah Development Corridor programme<lb/> is providing skills training to upgrade agro-based industry and tourism with an aim to exploit rich natural<lb/> endowments. The Iskandar Economic Development Zone has utilised investment liberalisation to<lb/> develop target industries, becoming an emerging hub for sectors such as higher education and medical<lb/></p>

			<figure>ECO/WKP(2017)3<lb/> 33<lb/> tourism (attracting patients from neighbouring countries for high-quality, private sector care at<lb/> competitive prices).<lb/> Figure 18. Increasing development gaps between states<lb/> Source: Department of Statistics, Malaysia, and MRRD (2016), The 2014 Statistics Bulletin.<lb/></figure>

			<p>Recent policy priorities issues include raising rural well-being and stimulating economic<lb/> activities utilising land and natural resources. Initiatives are ongoing to develop rural infrastructure,<lb/> increasingly in collaboration with non-government organisations and private companies, and<lb/> government-linked corporations that provide financial contributions to these projects as contributions<lb/> to corporate social responsibility. Although income inequality and differences in access to public services<lb/> such as education, medical services and basic infrastructure between urban and rural areas have narrowed<lb/> since the 1970s (EPU, 2015d), targeted support to improve education and healthcare services are still<lb/> required as a basis for improving well-being. T argeted educational support for students from socio-<lb/>economically disadvantaged backgrounds, who are more numerous in rural areas, would invigorate<lb/> social mobility and enhance overall education outcomes.<lb/> As noted in the preceding section on healthcare, responding to the acceleration of ageing in rural<lb/> areas, improving access to quality medical care and strengthening preventive and primary care is also<lb/> necessary to improve well-being in rural communities. This could contribute to narrowing life expectancy<lb/> gaps vis-à-vis advanced economies.<lb/></p>

			<figure>To narrow the income gap, it is necessary to create a resilient economic structure in rural areas by<lb/> promoting rural economic activities and decent employment opportunities (EPU, 2015d). Only 8.9% of<lb/> the rural population attained tertiary education in 2015. The unemployment rate for rural women with a<lb/> tertiary degree was 7.4% in 2015, substantially higher than the 3.8% rate for their urban counterparts.<lb/> ECO/WKP(2017)3<lb/> 34<lb/></figure>

			<p>Encouraging agro-based processing activities and eco-tourism that utilise regional assets offers business<lb/> opportunities in rural areas. Enhancing connectivity such as road and broadband internet with urban<lb/> areas enlarges business opportunities for rural enterprises and should continue to be central to reducing<lb/> regional inequality. To realise the business potential fully the government needs to implement a<lb/> programme to support rural entrepreneurs through skills training, in particular for e-commerce, which<lb/> contributes to linking consumers directly with rural entrepreneurs.<lb/></p>

			<p>Innovation by rural SMEs will also be critical to boosting regional equality. The Inclusive<lb/> Innovation programme under the SME Masterplan aims to empower the B40 by promoting the<lb/> transformation of communities, including through technical financial and management support to<lb/> microenterprises in rural areas. Harnessing the innovation potential of rural entrepreneurs will help<lb/> create globally competitive SMEs from all parts of Malaysia and develop creative solutions to regional<lb/> development problems. Private sector initiatives such as iCube – which provides a dynamic co-working<lb/> space, financial and expert support for local young entrepreneurs in Kuching (Sarawak state) – also<lb/> play a critical role in maximising the growth potential of regions.<lb/></p>
