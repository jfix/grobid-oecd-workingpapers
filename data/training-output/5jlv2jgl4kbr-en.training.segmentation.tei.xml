			<front>ABSTRACT/RÉSUMÉ <lb/>Making public finances more growth and equity-friendly in the euro area <lb/>Across the euro area, the ability of public finances to support equitable growth has tended to deteriorate. Concerns <lb/>about high and rising public debt, together with market pressure in some cases, led to sharp fiscal consolidation in <lb/>2011-13, against the backdrop of a weak economic situation at the time, which is considered to have made the <lb/>recession deeper and longer. Consolidation has slowed down afterwards, but countries with fiscal space have made <lb/>limited use of the leeway allowed under EU fiscal rules to support euro area aggregate demand. The expenditure <lb/>composition has generally become less growth-friendly, with large cuts in public investment. On the revenue side, <lb/>already high taxes on labour have tended to increase further. Structural reforms with direct positive implications for <lb/>the composition or efficiency of public finances have stalled. <lb/>While most policy levers to improve public finances remain at the country level, European and national policies can <lb/>be mutually reinforcing in fiscal governance and public investment. To achieve a euro area fiscal stance that fosters <lb/>the recovery, countries with fiscal space under the Stability and Growth Pact rules should use budgetary support to <lb/>raise growth, and existing incentives and flexibility should be taken advantage of to pursue reforms of tax and <lb/>spending policies. At the national level, it is essential to further upgrade budgetary frameworks, including through the <lb/>adoption of expenditure rules and regular performance of spending reviews. To promote capital formation and make <lb/>it more effective, EU budget resources for investment should be deployed in a way to crowd in national public funds <lb/>and private financing, and foster greater investment productivity. At the national level, better coordination of <lb/>investment across levels of government and upgraded administrative capacity would increase investment efficiency. <lb/>This Working Paper relates to the 2016 OECD Economic Survey of the euro area <lb/>(www.oecd.org/eco/surveys/economic-survey-european-union-and-euro-area.htm) <lb/>JEL classification codes: E62, F45, H20, H50, H54, H61 <lb/>Keywords: euro area, fiscal consolidation, composition of public finances, Stability and Growth Pact, fiscal rules, fiscal councils, <lb/>European regional policy, Investment Plan for Europe, public investment <lb/>******** <lb/>Rendre les finances publiques plus favorables à la croissance et à l&apos;équité dans la zone euro <lb/></front>

			<body>Dans la zone euro, la capacité des finances publiques à soutenir la croissance équitable s&apos;est globalement détériorée. <lb/>Face aux inquiétudes suscitées par le niveau élevé et croissant de l&apos;endettement public, et parfois sous la pression <lb/>exercée par les marchés, les autorités des pays ont procédé à un effort d&apos;assainissement budgétaire massif en 2011-13 <lb/>dans un contexte de conjoncture économique défavorable, ce qui est généralement considéré comme ayant contribué à <lb/>intensifier et à prolonger la récession. Le processus d&apos;assainissement s&apos;est ensuite ralenti, mais les pays disposant <lb/>d&apos;une marge de manoeuvre budgétaire ont peu utilisé la souplesse autorisée par les règles budgétaires de l&apos;UE pour <lb/>stimuler la demande globale dans la zone euro. De manière générale, la composition des dépenses est devenue moins <lb/>favorable à la croissance du fait de coupes drastiques dans les investissements publics. Sur le plan des recettes, la <lb/>fiscalité du travail, déjà élevée, s&apos;est encore alourdie. Les réformes structurelles qui peuvent avoir des retombées <lb/>positives directes sur la composition ou l&apos;efficience des finances publiques ont marqué le pas. <lb/>Si la plupart des leviers d&apos;action permettant d&apos;améliorer les finances publiques restent situés au niveau des pays, les <lb/>politiques européennes et nationales peuvent se renforcer mutuellement dans les domaines de la gouvernance <lb/>budgétaire et de l&apos;investissement public. Pour faire en sorte que l&apos;orientation budgétaire de l&apos;ensemble de la zone euro <lb/>contribue à alimenter la reprise, les pays qui disposent d&apos;une marge de manoeuvre budgétaire au sens des règles du <lb/>Pacte de stabilité et de croissance devraient recourir à l&apos;appui budgétaire pour stimuler la croissance, et il faudra <lb/>mettre à profit les dispositifs d&apos;incitation existants et la souplesse prévue par les règles en vigueur pour poursuivre la <lb/>réforme des politiques fiscales et de dépenses. Au niveau national, il est essentiel de poursuivre l&apos;amélioration des <lb/>cadres budgétaires, y compris en adoptant des règles de dépenses et en procédant à des examens réguliers des <lb/>dépenses. Pour promouvoir la formation de capital et rendre celui-ci plus efficace, les ressources budgétaires de l&apos;UE <lb/>disponibles pour l&apos;investissement devraient être déployées de façon à créer un effet d&apos;attraction sur les fonds publics <lb/>et les financements privés nationaux et à rendre l&apos;investissement plus productif. À l&apos;échelon national, des <lb/>investissements mieux coordonnés entre les différents niveaux d&apos;administration et des capacités administratives <lb/>renforcées conféreraient aux investissements une efficience accrue. <lb/>Ce Document de travail se rapporte à l&apos;Étude économique de l&apos;OCDE de la Zone euro 2016 <lb/>(http://www.oecd.org/fr/economie/etude-economique-union-europeenne-et-zone-euro.htm) <lb/>Classification JEL: E62, F45, H20, H50, H54, H61 <lb/>Mots clef: Zone euro, assainissement budgétaire, composition des finances publiques, Pacte de Stabilité et de Croissance, règles <lb/>budgétaires, organismes budgétaires indépendants, politique régionale européenne, Plan d&apos;investissement pour l&apos;Europe, <lb/>investissement public <lb/>ECO/WKP(2016)40 <lb/></body>

			<body>MAKING PUBLIC FINANCES MORE GROWTH AND EQUITY-FRIENDLY IN THE EURO <lb/>AREA <lb/>By Álvaro Pina 1 <lb/>There is strong potential to improve growth and equity through better public finances <lb/>Public finances matter for growth and equity through multiple channels <lb/>Fiscal policies and instruments can help to achieve major socio-economic goals, such as providing <lb/>cyclical stabilisation, promoting long-term economic growth and addressing redistributive objectives. <lb/>Sustainability, cyclicality, and composition and efficiency of taxation and spending are crucial, <lb/>interconnected dimensions of public finances and affect growth and equity through a variety of channels. <lb/>Ensuring debt sustainability and smoothing cyclical fluctuations tend to be mutually reinforcing. High <lb/>levels of debt can hamper the ability to stabilise the economy (Fall and Fournier, 2015). In turn, deep <lb/>recessions can harm long-term growth and thus compound sustainability challenges through hysteresis <lb/>effects. Certain changes in the composition of expenditure, such as greater prioritisation of public <lb/>investment or education, or of revenue, such as shifting taxation from labour to consumption and property, <lb/>can also support growth (Johansson et al., 2008; Cournède et al., 2013). The same holds for reforms of a <lb/>more qualitative nature, such as broadening tax bases or greater efficiency in spending. <lb/>In advanced economies, reforms of the composition of public finances can lift gross domestic product <lb/>(GDP) per capita growth by close to 1 percentage point over 5 to 10 years (IMF, 2015a). Among OECD <lb/>countries, making the composition of expenditure converge to that of the best performers (for instance, by <lb/>increasing the share of public investment) could yield even larger growth payoffs (Fournier and Johansson, <lb/>2016). <lb/>Fiscal policy also affects income distribution. Effective cyclical stabilisation tends to decrease <lb/>inequality by reducing the risk of long-term unemployment. The tax-spending mix of consolidation <lb/>episodes also matters for inequality, with spending-based episodes generally more harmful than revenue-<lb/>based ones (Woo et al., 2013). This creates potential trade-offs between equity and other objectives, since <lb/>spending-based consolidations are often regarded as more favourable to long-term growth and more likely <lb/>to stabilise debt (Molnar, 2012). At a more disaggregated level, some changes in budget composition may <lb/>also pose growth-equity trade-offs, such as when shifting taxation from direct to indirect taxes, but others <lb/>are beneficial on both counts, such as when increasing the share of education in public spending (Fournier <lb/>and Johansson, 2016). Greater prioritisation of spending on health, childcare and active labour market <lb/>policies, accompanied by steps to preserve or enhance efficiency levels in those areas, is also likely to <lb/>benefit both growth and equity (Cournède et al., 2013; OECD, 2015a). <lb/></body>

			<body>Coordinated action by euro area countries, harnessing national and common institutions and policies, <lb/>is needed to make fiscal policy more supportive of inclusive growth. Countries with fiscal space within the <lb/>boundaries of the Stability and Growth Pact should take account of the positive spillover effects of <lb/>domestic fiscal expansion onto other Member States and contribute to aggregate demand in the euro area. <lb/>Member states should also further improve their budgetary frameworks, including by adopting expenditure <lb/>rules, conducting spending reviews and implementing the ensuing recommendations, and exploring the full <lb/>potential of independent fiscal institutions. This would support debt sustainability and cyclical stabilisation <lb/>objectives, and would also help the implementation of reforms in the composition and efficiency of <lb/>taxation and public spending. To tackle persistent investment weakness in Europe, these reforms should <lb/>include coordinated efforts to increase public investment and make it more efficient, and to create better <lb/>financial and regulatory conditions for private investment. <lb/>The crisis has taken a heavy toll on public finances <lb/>On several counts, euro area public finances worsened as a consequence of the global financial crisis. <lb/>The increase in public debt was substantial and broadly comparable to that in the United States (Figure 1), <lb/>largely due to the recession and to specific events, such as banking sector rescues (Eyraud and Wu, 2015). <lb/>Support to the financial sector has also implied sizeable levels of contingent liabilities. High actual and <lb/>contingent debt can weaken fiscal sustainability: it can notably trigger shifts in market sentiment, which <lb/>could make debt financing more difficult. High debt levels also tend to be associated with lower growth, <lb/>though no firm conclusions have been reached on the direction of causality in the empirical literature (e.g. <lb/>Panizza and Presbitero, 2014). <lb/>Figure 1.

All euro area <lb/>countries, including those which are usually considered to have a solid fiscal position, have undertaken <lb/>consolidation efforts, which in several cases were well above 1 percentage point of GDP per year <lb/>(Figure 3).

			<body>Even though delivered on a scale broadly comparable to plans, fiscal consolidation had a smaller-<lb/>than-expected payoff in terms of halting the debt build-up (Figure 4), largely because of weak growth. <lb/>Although estimates of the magnitude of spillovers vary across studies, fiscal consolidation in one country <lb/>can have a sizeable negative growth impact on others, especially in bad times (Goujard, 2013; Carnot and <lb/>Castro, 2015). As a result, the simultaneous fiscal adjustment across the euro area, including in core <lb/>countries, is considered to have made the recession deeper and longer (Baldwin et al., 2015). Within <lb/>individual countries, the impact of consolidation on output, which tends to be larger in downturns and for <lb/>spending cuts, may also have been underestimated, though the evidence is not fully conclusive (Blanchard <lb/>and Leigh, 2013; Pain et al., 2014). <lb/>Figure 4. Fiscal consolidation and debt dynamics: projections and outcomes <lb/>1 <lb/>Change in percentage points of GDP <lb/>2 <lb/>1. <lb/>Projections are taken from the Economic Outlook (EO) datasets available at the end of 2010 and 2012: projections for 2010-12 <lb/>(the difference between projected values for 2012 and 2010) are taken from EO No. 88 and projections for 2012-14 are from EO <lb/>No. 92. The source for outcomes is EO No. 99. <lb/>2. <lb/>Potential GDP for the underlying primary balance. <lb/>Source: OECD (2016), OECD Economic Outlook: Statistics and Projections (database). <lb/>Furthermore, shifts in expenditure composition have generally been detrimental to equity and longer-<lb/>term growth, especially in the countries carrying out the largest fiscal adjustments. Spending restraint has <lb/>fallen heavily on public investment (Figure 5), which in the countries hit hardest by the crisis was often <lb/>more than halved in nominal terms (Table 1), falling as a share of GDP to values below the euro area <lb/>average. In those countries, public consumption, including for education and health care purposes <lb/>(Table 1), was also substantially curbed. In contrast, pensions have tended to be spared. Though making <lb/>modest contributions to overall consolidation, social protection spending on family and children <lb/>(comprising cash transfers and in-kind services and benefits) has often taken deep cuts (again, mostly in <lb/>countries making the largest consolidation efforts). <lb/>Developments in revenue composition have been less harmful, but still a matter of concern. Often the <lb/>largest stream of revenue, social contributions have tended to account for a modest share of the adjustment, <lb/>especially in the countries worst hit by the crisis. This is welcome, given the potential negative impacts of <lb/>social contributions hikes on both growth and equity (Cournède et al., 2013). The brunt of revenue <lb/>increases has come from the two other largest items, consumption taxes (other than environmental ones) <lb/>and especially personal income taxes (Figure 5). Hikes in the latter can make income distribution less <lb/>unequal but tend to penalise employment and growth, especially when implemented through rate increases. <lb/>0 <lb/>2 <lb/>4 <lb/>6 <lb/>8 <lb/>10 <lb/>12 <lb/>0 <lb/>2 <lb/>4 <lb/>6 <lb/>8 <lb/>10 <lb/>12 <lb/>Outcome <lb/>Projections <lb/>Outcome <lb/>Projections <lb/>Gross public debt, Maastricht definition <lb/>Underlying government primary balance <lb/>2010-12 <lb/>2012-14 <lb/>ECO/WKP(2016)40 <lb/></body>

			<body>Labour tax wedges in euro area countries, already high in international comparison, have tended to rise <lb/>further (Figure 6). More recently, many euro area countries are planning or implementing labour tax <lb/>reductions, though measures could be more ambitious (European Commission, 2015a). Unlike on the <lb/>spending side, some positive developments have taken place as regards smaller revenue items, such as <lb/>property or green taxes (Table 1). Recurrent taxes on immovable property, which tend to be among the <lb/>least distortive forms of taxation, have often been substantially increased. In some countries, revenue from <lb/>environmental taxes has also outpaced total primary revenue. <lb/>Figure 5. Post-crisis fiscal consolidation episodes: contributions from revenue and expenditure <lb/>1 <lb/>Percentage points of potential GDP <lb/>1. <lb/>Fiscal consolidation episodes are the same as those in Figure 3. On both revenue and expenditure sides, increases or <lb/>decreases in cyclically-adjusted budget items do not always relate to discretionary policy measures. For instance, tax elasticities <lb/>can fluctuate for reasons not captured by the corrections performed for the economic cycle and for one-offs. <lb/>2. <lb/>Education, health, other wages and intermediate consumption. <lb/>3. <lb/>Other than environmental taxes. <lb/>Source: D.

			<body>Tax and benefit systems have generally mitigated the impact of rising inequality in market income <lb/>(European Commission, 2015b), but available data suggests that this was mainly due to social transfers. In <lb/>contrast, the redistributive role played by taxes somewhat decreased in several countries in recent <lb/>consolidation episodes (Figure 7). Further, low incomes have sometimes recorded the highest increases in <lb/>labour tax wedges (Figure 6). <lb/>Figure 7.

Action in response to country-specific recommendations, <lb/>addressed to countries in the context of the European Semester, has on average been relatively low, and <lb/>below-average in fiscal-structural policy areas (Deroose and Griesse, 2014). For instance, there has been <lb/>relatively limited progress in reducing taxes on labour and broadening tax bases. On the spending side, <lb/>reforms to strengthen public administration governance and to improve cost-effectiveness and performance <lb/>in key domains, such as education and health, have also tended to display below-average implementation. <lb/>Reforms at both European and national levels are needed <lb/>Most policy levers to make public finances more growth and equity-friendly remain essentially at the <lb/>country level, despite an important role for European policies in addressing cross-country implications. On <lb/>the spending side, examples include the organisation of education and healthcare, and the design of social <lb/>protection systems. On the revenue side, the prime national policy lever is the structure of taxation. <lb/>In other domains, European policies exert major impacts on public finances. National budgets, though <lb/>remaining in the remit of national governments and parliaments, need to comply with the requirements of <lb/>the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP). Likewise, national public investment strategies are subject to <lb/>European rules (e.g. those of European regional policy) and have the potential for synergies with policies <lb/>at the European Union (EU) level, such as the Investment Plan for Europe. This paper focusses on two <lb/>prime areas where European and national spheres interact and can be mutually-reinforcing: fiscal <lb/>governance and public investment policies. <lb/>0 <lb/>10 <lb/>20 <lb/>30 <lb/>40 <lb/>50 <lb/>60 <lb/>EST <lb/>NLD <lb/>ESP <lb/>ITA <lb/>PRT <lb/>SVK <lb/>LUX <lb/>GRC <lb/>FRA <lb/>DEU <lb/>AUT <lb/>BEL <lb/>SVN <lb/>FIN <lb/>IRL <lb/>A.

			<body>Fiscal governance matters for multiple dimensions of public finance overall performance. Especially <lb/>since the crisis, numerical fiscal rules have often been specified in a way to reconcile sustainability and <lb/>stabilisation (Schaechter et al., 2012). Other desirable features of fiscal governance, such as a multi-year <lb/>budget horizon and independent fiscal institutions, can enhance the effectiveness of numerical rules and <lb/>yield benefits for the composition and efficiency of public finances. For instance, better budget institutions <lb/>tend to lead to more growth-friendly fiscal consolidation (IMF, 2014a; Gonçalves and Pina, 2016), and <lb/>multi-year budget frameworks help optimise public procurement and, in particular, public investment <lb/>(OECD, 2015b; IMF, 2015b). <lb/>Public investment is one of the fiscal tools with the strongest impacts on growth, both in the short and <lb/>the long run, and impacts tend to increase with investment efficiency, in turn underpinned by good <lb/>governance (IMF, 2015b). Short-run multipliers often exceed unity, especially if an expansion in public <lb/>investment is coordinated across countries (OECD, 2015c). Due to increases in productive capacity, long-<lb/>run output gains tend to be even higher (Bom and Ligthart, 2014). A key feature behind them is the ability <lb/>of sound public investment projects to make the private sector more productive, and hence crowd-in <lb/>private investment. Increasing investment, both public and private, has particular urgency in Europe, where <lb/>capital formation is still well below pre-crisis levels. <lb/>Improving fiscal governance to promote inclusive growth <lb/>Reforming European fiscal rules <lb/>The SGP has since its inception a dual structure, with a corrective arm and a preventive arm. The first, <lb/>also called the Excessive Deficit Procedure (EDP), is based on ceilings for the nominal deficit and debt as <lb/>a ratio to GDP (3% and 60%, respectively). It has a stronger legal basis, since it is enshrined in the Treaty. <lb/>The preventive arm is based on the so-called Medium-Term Objective (MTO), which provides a medium-<lb/>term target for the structural budget balance of each country (i.e. the nominal balance netting out the <lb/>cyclical component and one-off and other temporary measures). <lb/>Some 2011-13 reforms make better allowance for the fiscal and economic situation of countries (e.g. <lb/>by further modulating the pace of fiscal adjustment as a function of economic conditions). At the same <lb/>time, SGP rules have become complex due to the proliferation of different numerical targets, procedures, <lb/>contingency provisions and compliance indicators across the two arms (OECD, 2014a; Eyraud and Wu, <lb/>2015). The SGP has nonetheless remained primarily focussed on individual national policies, with scope <lb/>for further consideration of their aggregate area-wide impacts. Furthermore, despite strengthened <lb/>enforcement provisions of the preventive arm, those of the EDP remain more visible. As a result, <lb/>policymakers often focus on the 3% of GDP deficit threshold, risking procyclical policy responses. With <lb/>Treaty changes unlikely in the coming years (Juncker et al., 2015; European Commission, 2015c), the <lb/>short-term challenge is to ensure a sound application of the current SGP rules. In particular, degrees of <lb/>freedom afforded by the rules should be used by countries with fiscal space to contribute to a more <lb/>supportive joint euro area fiscal stance. <lb/>The preventive arm: ensuring an appropriate area-wide fiscal stance <lb/>In setting the structural balance trajectory towards the medium-term objective (MTO), the preventive <lb/>arm contains some welcome flexibility, on which the Commission has recently provided detailed guidance <lb/>(European Commission, 2015d). The required annual fiscal adjustment depends on cyclical conditions, and <lb/>can sometimes be waived, such as when real GDP growth is negative. In some cases, there can be <lb/>temporary deviations from the MTO or the consolidation plan towards it to accommodate the short-term <lb/>fiscal costs of major structural reforms, including certain kinds of investment. These provisions minimise <lb/>the extent of pro-cyclical policies and may ease reform implementation (Beetsma and Debrun, 2004). Rule <lb/>enforcement allows for some margins of tolerance, since a deviation from the MTO or the path towards it <lb/></body>

			<note place="headnote">ECO/WKP(2016)40 <lb/></note>

			<page>13 <lb/></page>

			<body>is regarded as significant (giving rise to a warning to the country concerned and to subsequent enforcement <lb/>steps) only if it reaches at least 0.5% of GDP in one year, or 0.25% on average in two consecutive years. <lb/>With negative GDP growth, coupling the no adjustment requirement with possible leeway on <lb/>investment grounds and with the enforcement margin would allow some fiscal expansion, but care would <lb/>be needed to avoid stretching the margin and thus undermining the credibility of the rules. If medium-term <lb/>fiscal sustainability is preserved, countries may be allowed to temporarily deviate from the adjustment path <lb/>towards the MTO in periods of severe area-wide economic downturn. This provision, introduced in 2011 <lb/>following the coordinated expansion of 2008-09, has never been applied so far, and could offer a legal <lb/>basis for countercyclical policies were the euro area to fall back into recession. <lb/>As cyclical conditions improve and more countries leave the EDP, the need for fiscal adjustment <lb/>under the preventive arm will increase. In good times, rules should be strictly enforced to help create fiscal <lb/>space to deal with future downturns. Consolidation should have been done more vigorously in the years <lb/>before the global financial crisis (Eyraud and Wu, 2015), when the euro area aggregate fiscal stance was <lb/>essentially neutral (Figure 8; Carnot and Castro, 2015). In bad times, national fiscal policies should take <lb/>account of cross-country spillovers (Goujard, 2013) and, within SGP rules, contribute to supporting euro <lb/>area aggregate demand. <lb/>Figure 8.

Adopting structural reforms in tax and spending policies to make <lb/>public finances more growth-friendly and thus enhance long-term sustainability would be desirable in its <lb/>own right and would also ease exploitation of the flexibility provisions. In this vein, priorities should <lb/>include increasing public investment, especially on trans-European networks, and decreasing taxation on <lb/>low wages. <lb/>2004 <lb/>2005 <lb/>2006 <lb/>2007 <lb/>2008 <lb/>2009 <lb/>2010 <lb/>2011 <lb/>2012 <lb/>2013 <lb/>2014 <lb/>2015 <lb/>-1.5 <lb/>-1.0 <lb/>-0.5 <lb/>0.0 <lb/>0.5 <lb/>1.0 <lb/>1.5 <lb/>2.0 <lb/>-1.5 <lb/>-1.0 <lb/>-0.5 <lb/>0.0 <lb/>0.5 <lb/>1.0 <lb/>1.5 <lb/>2.0 <lb/>-4 <lb/>-3 <lb/>-2 <lb/>-1 <lb/>0 <lb/>1 <lb/>2 <lb/>3 <lb/>4 <lb/>Change in the underlying primary <lb/>balance (% points) <lb/>Output gap <lb/>ECO/WKP(2016)40 <lb/></body>

			<body>If the recovery weakens significantly and the risk of a new recession looms, more widespread <lb/>temporary fiscal expansion under the clause for severe area-wide economic downturns should be <lb/>considered. Countries where a temporary fiscal easing would not threaten debt sustainability would adopt <lb/>an expansionary stance, modulated according to fiscal space, while others would aim at a broadly neutral <lb/>policy stance. In line with its remit (European Commission, 2015e), the recently announced European <lb/>Fiscal Board would be well placed to advise on the applicability of the clause for severe downturns and, <lb/>more generally, on the appropriate area-wide fiscal stance and how it should translate into national fiscal <lb/>stances. A bleaker macroeconomic outlook would only increase the urgency of growth-enhancing reforms <lb/>in revenue and spending composition. <lb/>The corrective arm: avoiding excessive adjustment and strengthening incentives for reform <lb/>In the corrective arm, large adjustments induced by the debt reduction benchmark should be avoided. <lb/>The benchmark requires that the excess of the debt ratio over 60% of GDP be reduced at an average 1/20th <lb/>per year (assessed over three-year periods, and with transitional provisions for countries which were under <lb/>an EDP in November 2011). For highly indebted countries, these fiscal adjustments can be very large, far <lb/>exceeding preventive arm requirements. Italy, for instance, would have needed a cumulative structural <lb/>effort of around 3 per cent of GDP over 2013-15 (European Commission, 2015f), broadly similar to the <lb/>post-crisis effort (Figure 3), which would have threatened the recovery. <lb/>In the cases it has examined so far (Belgium and Italy), the Commission took account of expected <lb/>compliance with preventive arm requirements and expected implementation of ambitious structural <lb/>reforms, as well as of unfavourable economic conditions (especially low inflation), and decided not to open <lb/>an EDP (European Commission, 2015f, 2015g). A similar approach should be taken in forthcoming cases, <lb/>as other highly indebted countries leave the EDP and become subject to the debt reduction benchmark. In a <lb/>future SGP revision, the appropriate speed of adjustment towards the 60% of GDP debt threshold should <lb/>be reviewed (see below). <lb/>Compared to the preventive arm, flexibility under the corrective arm is far more limited. The <lb/>corrective arm requires an annual structural balance adjustment of at least 0.5% of GDP, regardless of <lb/>cyclical developments and structural reform implementation, and setting a deadline for eliminating the <lb/>excessive deficit. The adjustment requirement may imply pro-cyclical policies and is only consistent with <lb/>an ex ante deadline if output developments play out as forecast. Longer deadlines are the main provisions <lb/>for flexibility, and deadline extensions have been used intensively (Figure 9). Though often justified in <lb/>economic terms, extensions are still a second-best tool, as they potentially undermine the credibility of the <lb/>SGP. <lb/>Figure 9.

			<body>Under these constraints, it is important to strengthen incentives for reforms of spending and tax <lb/>policies and of national budget frameworks. Building on recent steps (European Commission, 2015d), the <lb/>Commission could make greater use of longer initial deadlines to provide incentives for major public <lb/>finance reforms. Deadline extensions could also be granted for this purpose, conditional on satisfactory <lb/>fiscal adjustment prior to that point. As envisaged, the reforms considered should go beyond those <lb/>introducing a multi-pillar pension system, which have in practice enjoyed a privileged treatment since the <lb/>2005 revision of the SGP (Eyraud and Wu, 2015). Greater emphasis should also be given to the quality of <lb/>national budgetary frameworks (an aspect already contemplated in current legislation) when taking EDP <lb/>steps. <lb/>Simplifying the assessment of fiscal effort <lb/>The concept of structural fiscal adjustment is a key tool for both the preventive and corrective arms, <lb/>but has become a source of complexity. As it is difficult to agree on a unique definition of &quot; structural &quot; , <lb/>alternative indicators to measure fiscal adjustment, aiming to complement the structural budget balance, <lb/>have proliferated. As a result, progress towards the MTO is also reviewed in the light of the so-called <lb/>expenditure benchmark, which sets a growth rate for a spending aggregate net of discretionary revenue <lb/>measures (see below). As for the EDP, the assessment of effective action resorts, in more complex cases, to <lb/>two different measures of adjusted fiscal effort, obtained through top-down and bottom-up approaches. <lb/>Moving towards a single indicator across both SGP arms would help reduce complexity and increase <lb/>transparency. Commendably, efforts to this end have recently been announced (European Commission, <lb/>2015c). <lb/>If well designed, a single indicator along the lines of the expenditure benchmark could have the <lb/>additional advantage of supporting national expenditure rules. The expenditure benchmark has some <lb/>welcome features: it preserves national discretion over the size of government (for instance, expenditure is <lb/>allowed to grow faster if accompanied by revenue-raising measures), and defines expenditure growth with <lb/>reference to potential rather than actual GDP, which avoids pro-cyclicality. However, it is based on a <lb/>complex spending aggregate, which nets out not only interest payments (a common exclusion) but also <lb/>some components of unemployment benefits, public investment and other government expenditure. By <lb/>comparison, countries like the Netherlands and Sweden, which were among the first to adopt expenditure <lb/>rules, use spending aggregates with less exclusions. A simpler expenditure benchmark would ease <lb/>medium-term expenditure programming at national level. <lb/>Avenues for medium-term SGP reform <lb/>Over the medium term, SGP rules should be improved along two main axes. First, to reduce <lb/>complexity and asymmetries in enforcement, the preventive and corrective arms could be more closely <lb/>aligned and possibly merged, giving rise to a single set of targets, procedures and indicators. Second, the <lb/>current multiplicity of numerical rules could be replaced by a single fiscal anchor underpinned by a single <lb/>operational rule (Andrle et al., 2015). The natural anchor is the public debt-to-GDP ratio in each country, <lb/>given its direct link to fiscal sustainability. The appropriate speed of debt reduction could take account of <lb/>cyclical conditions in each country (as is now the case for fiscal adjustment under the preventive arm) as <lb/>well as in the euro area as a whole. Countries would then specify their own operational rules (for instance, <lb/>deficit or expenditure rules) which should include a debt correction mechanism, thus reinforcing national <lb/>budget frameworks. These reforms would imply very substantial legislative changes, including to the <lb/>Treaty. The spring 2017 White Paper envisaged in the Five Presidents&apos; Report (Juncker et al., 2015) offers <lb/>an opportunity to start preparatory work. <lb/></body>

			<body>Reinforcing national budgetary frameworks <lb/>Budget frameworks at the national level play a key role in making public finances more supportive of <lb/>equitable growth and the procedures and institutions involved in preparing, approving and executing <lb/>budgets are highly country-specific. For instance, the effectiveness of numerical rules targeting broad <lb/>public finance aggregates hinges on their alignment with the medium-term strategic priorities of <lb/>government (OECD, 2015d), and is fostered by top-down budgeting, a multi-year horizon, and <lb/>performance-informed allocations and management at programme level. <lb/>The SGP reform of 2011-13 included several provisions to strengthen national fiscal frameworks. The <lb/>Six-Pack Directive on budgetary frameworks (2011) and the Two Pack and Fiscal Compact (2013) set <lb/>requirements in a broad range of areas, including numerical fiscal rules, independent fiscal institutions, <lb/>medium-term budgetary frameworks and budget reporting and transparency. Important strides have been <lb/>made in some areas, such as the coverage and timeliness of budget statistics and the creation of <lb/>independent fiscal institutions in virtually all euro area countries. However, overall budget reform activity <lb/>across the euro area since late 2011, as assessed by the OECD, has been generally modest (Figure 10). <lb/>Though further progress primarily depends on national governments and parliaments, European institutions <lb/>can foster reform by enforcing legal obligations, such as the correct transposition of relevant EU law, and <lb/>through peer-pressure and a greater weight given to the quality of national frameworks when applying SGP <lb/>rules. <lb/>Figure 10.

			<body>government or the public sector (Schaechter et al., 2012; Bova et al., 2015). Modest progress is also <lb/>apparent if one considers expenditure rules, for which there are no transposition requirements in the SGP: <lb/>in 2014, only five euro area countries had in place expenditure rules covering more than half of general <lb/>government finances, compared to four in 2010 (European Commission&apos;s Fiscal Governance database). <lb/>Expenditure rules strike a balance between sustainability and stabilisation objectives, especially when <lb/>supplemented with a correction mechanism that reacts to deviations of debt from its target (Andrle et al., <lb/>2015). Automatic stabilisers, mostly on the revenue side, are largely allowed to operate. Relative to a <lb/>structural balance rule, an expenditure rule is simpler, easier to communicate and less vulnerable to real-<lb/>time measurement error, since potential output is difficult to estimate in real time and estimates have been <lb/>subject to large ex post revisions. Last but not least, aggregate expenditure ceilings can provide a better <lb/>anchor to the determination of annual spending allocations, and thus facilitate reforms, which are discussed <lb/>next, to increase the efficiency of public spending at sectoral or programme level. Communication and <lb/>transparency of the spending rule is important to its credibility, and in this light monitoring of compliance <lb/>with the rule should be entrusted to an independent fiscal institution, as required by the SGP. <lb/>Spending reviews have the potential to yield important gains as regards the composition and <lb/>efficiency of government outlays. Through systematic scrutiny of baseline expenditure, prioritisation can <lb/>be improved and spending reductions, if needed, can be made more sustainable, notably through efficiency <lb/>gains (Robinson, 2014). Furthermore, when integrated into the regular process of budget preparation, <lb/>spending reviews can support adherence to aggregate spending ceilings, and foster the development of <lb/>performance-informed budgeting. Successful spending reviews are nonetheless a complex tool, requiring <lb/>cooperation between finance and spending ministries and sustained high-level political commitment for <lb/>recommendations to be translated into policy decisions. <lb/>These difficulties help explain why successful implementation of spending reviews remains limited. <lb/>Resort to this tool has rapidly increased in the wake of the global financial crisis, with about half of OECD <lb/>countries (and, within these, a similar proportion of euro area members) reporting some sort of spending <lb/>review in place in 2011 (OECD, 2011; Robinson, 2014). Nonetheless, publicly available information on <lb/>these reviews, notably on implementation of recommendations and ensuing savings, is fragmented and <lb/>heterogeneous, and independent monitoring remains relatively scarce (Vandierendonck, 2014), as does the <lb/>reviews&apos; integration into the regular budget process. Countries should conduct spending reviews on a <lb/>regular basis, ensuring a systematic link to budget preparation as well as independent monitoring of <lb/>ensuing results. Peer-review exercises, such as those organised by the European Commission in 2014 <lb/>(Vandierendonck, 2014), can be a valuable tool to promote the exchange of good practices. <lb/>Independent fiscal institutions should be given conditions to operate effectively <lb/>Euro area countries are required by the SGP to have independent fiscal institutions that monitor <lb/>compliance with fiscal rules, with a special emphasis on those enshrining the medium-term objective in <lb/>national legislation. Independent institutions should also prepare or assess the macroeconomic forecasts <lb/>used in annual and multi-year fiscal plans. These requirements are strongly reflected in the remit of <lb/>existing institutions (Figure 11), more than half of which started activity after 2011. <lb/></body>

For a detailed <lb/>description of other features see Box 1 in IMF Working Paper No. 14/58. <lb/>Source: OECD calculations based on X. Debrun and T.

Debrun et al., (2013), &quot; The Functions and Impact of Fiscal <lb/>Councils &quot; , IMF Policy Paper, 16 July, International Monetary Fund. <lb/>The tasks entrusted to national independent fiscal institutions could be usefully extended beyond those <lb/>mandated by the SGP. An example is the quantification of budgetary and economic impacts of measures <lb/>and reforms (costing of measures), as often done by similar institutions outside the EU (Figure 11). Like <lb/>rule monitoring and forecast production or assessment, carrying out cost estimates of measures is also <lb/>associated with lower primary deficits (Debrun and Kinda, 2014). Further, it would contribute to a more <lb/>informed debate on, and potentially better design of, structural reforms with direct budget implications, <lb/>thereby improving the composition and efficiency of public finances. <lb/>It is also essential that independent fiscal institutions be provided with conditions for a credible <lb/>fulfilment of their mandate, in terms of resources, access to information and the broader institutional <lb/>environment. Institutions in euro area countries tend to compare unfavourably in terms of having staff <lb/>commensurate to tasks (Figure 11), and staff needs would generally increase if institutions were tasked <lb/>with policy costing, as this requires sector and programme-specific expertise. Further, institutions in euro <lb/>area countries often lack strong safeguards on their budget, such as multiannual funding commitments, <lb/>which would further enhance the independence of those bodies (OECD, 2014b). Full and timely access to <lb/>relevant information should also be ensured. Though a legal obligation to share information essential for <lb/>the institutions&apos; activity is often in place, less than half of those institutions in EU countries enjoy full <lb/>access to non-public budgetary information (European Commission, 2014). Finally, relations between the <lb/>new advisory European Fiscal Board and national independent fiscal institutions should be organised in a <lb/>mutually-reinforcing way, as planned, thus avoiding to undermine the scope of action and credibility of the <lb/>latter. <lb/>0 <lb/>10 <lb/>20 <lb/>30 <lb/>40 <lb/>50 <lb/>60 <lb/>70 <lb/>80 <lb/>90 <lb/>100 <lb/>Safeguards on budget <lb/>Staff commensurate to tasks <lb/>Access to information <lb/>Costing of measures <lb/>Long-term sustainability analysis <lb/>Monitoring of fiscal rules <lb/>Macroeconomic forecasts² <lb/>Euro area <lb/>Non-European Union <lb/>Remit: inst. performing a given task <lb/>Resources: institutions possessing 3 <lb/>ECO/WKP(2016)40 <lb/></body>

			<body>Statistical information can be improved further <lb/>Further progress in public sector statistics would reinforce risk analysis and management, which is a <lb/>key input for assessing debt sustainability. High-quality budget reporting has been highlighted as an <lb/>important principle of fiscal governance (IMF, 2014a; OECD, 2015d). So has sound fiscal risk analysis <lb/>and management, which requires comprehensive information on public sector units and on contingent <lb/>liabilities. Since 2011, considerable progress has been made. Eurostat&apos;s auditing powers have been <lb/>strengthened and the coverage and timeliness of general government accounts improved, with monthly <lb/>cash-based or equivalent data now available (quarterly in the case of local government) and a more <lb/>transparent transition from cash-based to accrual (national accounts) data. As for general government <lb/>contingent liabilities and non-performing loans, annual reporting has been introduced, but further efforts <lb/>are needed to improve detail, timeliness (quarterly releases would be desirable) and coverage. Coverage <lb/>particularly needs to be improved in the case of liabilities of state-owned enterprises (SoEs), where data <lb/>limitations sometimes reflect a still incomplete delimitation of the public sector (formed by the general <lb/>government and SoEs), especially at the level of local government. It would also be helpful to have <lb/>complete accounts (and not just debt) for the public sector as a whole, which would require separate <lb/>identification of SoEs and private firms in national accounts. <lb/>Policies towards more effective public investment <lb/>Both European and national policy levers play a key role in ensuring enough and efficient spending <lb/>on public investment. The EU&apos;s own budget funds for investment and other growth-enhancing expenditure, <lb/>such as on education and active labour market programmes, stand at 0.5% of EU GDP. This amount is <lb/>arguably too low if account is taken of the potential for generating economies of scale and positive <lb/>externalities, for example from research and development (R&amp;D) or infrastructure. However, even these <lb/>limited resources can have a leveraged impact on the composition and efficiency of public finances if <lb/>deployed in a way to crowd in national public funds and private investment, and foster greater investment <lb/>productivity. At national level, better coordination of investment across levels of government and upgraded <lb/>administrative capacity would increase investment efficiency. <lb/>Making EU budget expenditure more growth-friendly <lb/>The structure of EU budget expenditure has become more growth-friendly over time, but there <lb/>remains large scope for improvement. Funds aimed at investment and growth currently account for close to <lb/>half of total EU-level spending (Figure 12, &quot; Smart and inclusive growth &quot; ). Among these, geographically-<lb/>allocated European regional policy has accounted for about one third of total spending since the turn of the <lb/>century. &quot; Competitiveness for growth and jobs &quot; programmes are directly managed at European level (there <lb/>are no country-specific allocations) and include the research and innovation Horizon 2020 and the <lb/>Connecting Europe Facility (targeted at trans-European networks). Their weight in the budget has roughly <lb/>doubled since the nineties but is still less than half the share of agricultural subsidies. Resource constraints <lb/>were well illustrated by the unfortunate need to partly fund the Investment Plan for Europe (discussed <lb/>below) with allocations taken from Horizon 2020 and the Connecting Europe Facility, streams of spending <lb/>that are also critical for boosting European growth potential. <lb/>ECO/WKP(2016)40 <lb/></body>

CAP: Common Agricultural Policy. <lb/>Source: European Commission (2014), European Union: Public Finance, 5th Edition. <lb/>In the short term, and in particular in the budget review foreseen for 2017, it is essential to preserve <lb/>investment and growth allocations in the face of pressures on other fronts, such as the refugee crisis. <lb/>Unlike spending allocated to countries, investment and R&amp;D programmes managed at EU level become <lb/>potential targets for savings. In the longer term, post-2020 financial frameworks should continue to <lb/>increase resources for growth-enhancing expenditure. This can be funded by either reallocation of <lb/>expenditure or an increase in the overall EU budget size, reversing the unprecedented reduction in real <lb/>terms agreed for 2014-20. <lb/>European regional policy: making the best of conditionality requirements <lb/>European regional policy can be a powerful tool to increase the quality of public finances in the less <lb/>prosperous EU countries, where receipts of European structural and investment funds reach <lb/>macroeconomic significance (Figure 13). Those funds can improve the composition of public spending, <lb/>since they are targeted to growth and equity-friendly investments, such as on transport and network <lb/>infrastructures, R&amp;D, education or active labour market policies. Furthermore, support to and compliance <lb/>with sound institutional frameworks will tend to enhance the efficiency of the expenditure concerned <lb/>(Rodriguez-Pose and Garcilazo, 2013). <lb/>To maximise the benefits, it is essential to ensure that EU funding adds to, rather than replaces, <lb/>national public spending (the so-called additionality). In the 2014-20 period, compliance with additionality <lb/>requires that countries achieve minimum levels of public investment. However, enforcement mechanisms <lb/>have been reinforced only gradually, and remain weak. Possible sanctions appear late in the process (not <lb/>before 2022 for the 2014-20 period) and are relatively light. For instance, if public investment falls short of <lb/>the levels required for compliance by 20%, only a modest 1.7% of the structural funds received for the less <lb/>developed regions of the country concerned may have to be given back. Furthermore, especially for euro <lb/>area countries, the compliance levels look often unambitious: they imply an increase in the share of <lb/>European funds in total public investment (Figure 14), and therefore a decline in the relative contribution <lb/>of national funds. <lb/>0 <lb/>5 <lb/>10 <lb/>15 <lb/>20 <lb/>25 <lb/>30 <lb/>35 <lb/>Security and citizenship <lb/>Global Europe <lb/>Administration <lb/>Other sustainable growth expenditure <lb/>Market-related expenditure and direct payments <lb/>Competitiveness for growth and jobs <lb/>Economic, social and territorial cohesion <lb/>Smart and <lb/>inclusive <lb/>growth <lb/>Sustainable <lb/>growth <lb/>(mainly CAP)¹ <lb/></body>

			<body>Current rules for additionality should be credibly enforced, starting with the 2018 mid-term <lb/>verification, where increasing the investment levels required could be considered. In future programming <lb/>periods, more ambitious levels should likewise be envisaged, and possible sanctions brought to an earlier <lb/>stage. Compliance indicators could also be improved further. For 2014-20, gross fixed capital formation of <lb/>general government, as defined in national accounts, has replaced previous ad hoc indicators, with gains in <lb/>terms of simplification and transparency. However, given that a significant part of expenditure supported <lb/>by structural funds is not classified as gross fixed capital formation of general government, a broader set of <lb/>indicators could be considered, while preserving the principle of relying on readily available, standardised <lb/>data. <lb/>To support institutional quality and investment efficiency, conditionality requirements have been <lb/>generally reinforced in the 2014-20 period. Numerous ex ante conditionalities need to be met before the <lb/>disbursement of funds, either of a general nature (such as compliance with public procurement rules) or of <lb/>a thematic one (such as the existence of national strategies in specific sectors). Further, macroeconomic <lb/>conditionality aims to reinforce consistency between European structural and investment funding and key <lb/>elements of EU economic governance. For instance, to better address country-specific recommendations, <lb/>the Commission may request countries to reprogramme structural and investment funds, and to propose a <lb/>suspension of payments in the absence of a satisfactory national response. Untested so far, this <lb/>conditionality could improve the alignment of funds with relevant structural reforms. However, as in the <lb/>case of ex ante conditionalities, preserving national ownership of reforms and other requirements is <lb/>essential. <lb/>In other cases, however, macroeconomic conditionality may be counterproductive. For example, the <lb/>Commission must propose a suspension of structural funds when the Council assesses that no effective <lb/>action has been taken to correct an excessive deficit. Though modulated in the light of economic and social <lb/>conditions, suspended amounts will be at least in the range of 0.25% to 0.5% of GDP (or 25% to 50% of <lb/>annual structural and investment funding if lower). This suspension will be lifted and re-budgeted as soon <lb/>as the Member State has adopted the necessary corrective action. Nevertheless, under fiscal stress, these <lb/>sanctions would likely worsen the composition of public expenditure by compounding downward <lb/>pressures on public investment and other growth-enhancing items, and should therefore in most cases be <lb/>avoided. <lb/>Leveraging private sector investment <lb/>Announced in November 2014, the Investment Plan for Europe aims at generating at least <lb/>EUR 315 billion (2.2% of 2015 EU GDP) of additional investment over three years, mainly from private <lb/>sources and with a focus on infrastructure, innovation and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). <lb/>The Plan&apos;s funding pillar, the European Fund for Strategic Investments (EFSI), allows the European <lb/>Investment Bank (EIB) Group to finance projects that would not have been supported otherwise. The EFSI <lb/>is endowed with a risk-absorbing capacity of EUR 21 billion: EUR 5 billion from EIB resources, and an <lb/>EU guarantee of EUR 16 billion. Decisions on the use of this guarantee to support specific projects are <lb/>made by an independent Investment Committee. No member state made financial contributions to the <lb/>EFSI, but several have already committed to provide co-financing to investments, mainly via national <lb/>promotional banks. It will be important to ensure that these commitments represent additional public <lb/>investment. Under certain conditions, national authorities will also be able to combine European structural <lb/>and investment funds with EFSI support to enhance risk-bearing capacity and thus the ability to attract <lb/>private sector financing (European Commission, 2016). <lb/>The Plan also comprises pillars of project promotion and technical assistance, and of structural <lb/>reforms. The European Investment Project Portal will advertise potential investment opportunities <lb/>submitted by public or private promoters, while the European Investment Advisory Hub, already <lb/></body>

			<body>operational, offers a single point of contact for technical assistance. Structural reforms to create an <lb/>investment-friendly environment are discussed in Strasky (2016). A case in point, essential to unlock <lb/>investment and complete the Single Market, is the reduction of regulatory heterogeneity across Europe. <lb/>The amount of EFSI-supported investment carried out so far has been small, providing negligible <lb/>short-run stimulus to activity. Project submission and approval has nonetheless been progressing in line <lb/>with the target in recent months, and about EUR 12.8 billion of EIB Group resources have already been <lb/>committed by mid-May 2016, which are expected to trigger total investment of around EUR 100 billion in <lb/>the coming years. <lb/>Given limited public resources, the medium-term success of the Plan will hinge on its ability to <lb/>leverage private investment, for which the EIB Group&apos;s lending behaviour and the quality of the projects <lb/>presented will be key. The EUR 315 billion investment target presupposes a multiplier of 15: the EFSI <lb/>guarantee should enable three times as much EIB Group funding, which will be used to finance an average <lb/>20% of investment projects (the remainder coming from additional investors, with a large role played by <lb/>the private sector). This requires selecting projects which are attractive for additional co-funding and (to <lb/>avoid crowding-out) which would not otherwise be carried out. Crowding in private investment on the <lb/>scale envisaged also requires that the EIB Group depart from its usual very prudent lending practices, <lb/>characterised by a choice of low-risk projects and negligible levels of non-performing loans (Claeys, <lb/>2015). This implies accepting projects with higher risk than in the past, and financing on average a lower <lb/>share of each (one-fifth, in line with the envisaged multiplier, rather than the traditional one-third to <lb/>one-half). <lb/>Improving public investment governance <lb/>At national level, stepping up efforts to coordinate investment among tiers of government is essential. <lb/>Across the OECD, sub-national governments account for about 60% of total public investment (Figure 15), <lb/>highlighting the need for vertical and horizontal coordination mechanisms (OECD, 2013; OECD, 2014c). <lb/>However, for reasons such as informational asymmetries, non-aligned objectives, poor capacity or <lb/>inadequate funding arrangements, effective coordination is difficult. Among 15 dimensions of institutional <lb/>quality for efficient public investment management, central-local coordination is the one where advanced <lb/>economies tend to fare worst (IMF, 2015b). In a recent survey on infrastructure investment, more than <lb/>three quarters of EU sub-national governments reported coordination challenges across the national and <lb/>subnational levels. Challenges in horizontal coordination across jurisdictions are also prominent in the <lb/>survey results (OECD and Committee of Regions, 2015). <lb/>ECO/WKP(2016)40 <lb/></body>

For the 2014-20 period, <lb/>EU regional policy has developed tools to promote coordination, such as integrated territorial investments, <lb/>which bring together different funding lines to implement an integrated strategy in a specific territory. <lb/>Delegation of management tasks to local and regional authorities is allowed, and, in some cases, even <lb/>mandatory. Better coordination among sub-national governments will also enhance their ability to promote <lb/>sound investment projects under the Investment Plan for Europe. <lb/>Public administration capacity is also essential for efficient investment, but is often inadequate, <lb/>especially at sub-national level and in particular in lagging regions. There is wide variation in the perceived <lb/>quality of sub-national governments across the EU, and within some countries (Charron et al., 2012). <lb/>Capacity challenges have been identified at various stages of the investment cycle, including long-term <lb/>strategic planning, the ability to involve the private sector (for instance through public-private <lb/>partnerships) and public procurement (OECD, 2013). Aware of these weaknesses, EU regional policy has <lb/>included the enhancement of administrative capacity among its ex ante conditionalities for the 2014-20 <lb/>period, with an accompanying increase in financial support for this purpose. A recent proposal for a <lb/>Structural Reform Support Programme (European Commission, 2015h) will also support capacity building, <lb/>namely through technical assistance. National authorities should prioritise actions to preserve and develop <lb/>administrative capacity at different levels of government in response to the main gaps detected and with a <lb/>special focus on the weakest regions. In times of fiscal restraint, these considerations should inform the <lb/>design of fiscal consolidation. <lb/>0 <lb/>10 <lb/>20 <lb/>30 <lb/>40 <lb/>50 <lb/>60 <lb/>70 <lb/>80 <lb/>90 <lb/>100 <lb/>0 <lb/>10 <lb/>20 <lb/>30 <lb/>40 <lb/>50 <lb/>60 <lb/>70 <lb/>80 <lb/>90 <lb/>100 <lb/>IRL <lb/>GRC SVK <lb/>EST LUX <lb/>NZL ISL <lb/>TUR <lb/>HUN GBR <lb/>PRT <lb/>NOR DNK <lb/>AUT SVN <lb/>POL CZE <lb/>SWE NLD KOR USA ISR FRA FIN ITA AUS CHE DEU ESP MEX JPN BEL CAN <lb/>Local <lb/>State³ <lb/></body>

			<body>Recommendations to make public finances more growth and equity-friendly <lb/>Improving fiscal governance and supporting the recovery <lb/>Key recommendations <lb/> <lb/>Countries with fiscal space should use budgetary support to raise growth. <lb/> <lb/>Ensure that the application of the debt reduction rule of the Stability and Growth Pact does not threaten <lb/>the recovery. <lb/> <lb/>Allow longer initial deadlines for correcting excessive deficits if countries implement major structural <lb/>reforms in spending and tax policies which enhance potential growth and long-term sustainability. <lb/> <lb/>Adopt national expenditure rules and conduct spending reviews linked to budget preparation. <lb/> <lb/>Ensure that national independent fiscal institutions have resources to fulfil their mandate. <lb/>Additional recommendations <lb/> <lb/>Include in the remit of national independent fiscal institutions estimating the costs of proposed policies. <lb/> <lb/>To reduce complexity, adopt a single indicator to measure structural fiscal adjustment under different <lb/>SGP rules and procedures. Ensure that the chosen indicator does not hamper medium-term expenditure <lb/>programming at national level. <lb/> <lb/>Further improve the coverage and timeliness of statistical data on general government contingent <lb/>liabilities, especially as regards state-owned enterprises. <lb/>Protecting public investment and increasing its efficiency <lb/>Key recommendations <lb/> <lb/>As intended in the Investment Plan for Europe, the European Investment Bank should finance higher-risk <lb/>projects that would not otherwise be carried out. <lb/> <lb/>Countries should increase targeted public support to investment while enhancing the framework <lb/>conditions for private investment. <lb/>Additional recommendations <lb/> <lb/>Preserve EU budget resources for investment and growth in the face of short-term pressures on other <lb/>fronts. In the future, continue to increase growth-enhancing expenditure in the EU budget, if possible by <lb/>granting higher resources to the European Union. <lb/> <lb/>Credibly enforce current rules to ensure that EU structural and investment funds add to, rather than <lb/>replace, national public spending. In the future, make the rules stricter through more ambitious target <lb/>levels of public investment and the possibility of earlier sanctions. <lb/> <lb/>Do not suspend EU structural and investment funds to a country under the Excessive Deficit Procedure, <lb/>as suspension would likely compound downward pressures on public investment. <lb/> <lb/>At national level, step up efforts to better coordinate investment among different levels of government <lb/>and upgrade the technical and strategic capacity of the public administration. <lb/></body>
