			<p>This paper presents the main features of China&apos;s sub-national public finance arrangements and<lb/> discusses past and potential changes that affect fiscal disparities across the country. China has a multi-<lb/>tiered government structure (Box 1) that shares overall national tax revenues through tax sharing and<lb/> transfers. The paper first outlines the distribution of revenue and expenditure by level of government. It<lb/> then discusses how transfers affect fiscal inequality. After considering the orientation of government policy<lb/> in service equalisation, the paper looks at the government&apos;s plans to improve sub-national finance.<lb/></p>

			<head>Box 1. China&apos;s administrative divisions<lb/></head>

			<p>The administrative structure of the People&apos;s Republic of China has four sub-national levels: provincial,<lb/> prefectural, county and township. The People&apos;s Assembly at each level reports to the assembly at the next higher level.<lb/> Finally, the provincial assembly reports to the national assembly. There is also an informal level of government below<lb/> the township level called the village level. In parallel to the government structure, there is a similar structure for the<lb/> Communist Party. The names of each level of government vary across the country.<lb/> The provincial level can be known as a province, an autonomous region or a municipality (these are generally<lb/> large cities under the direct control of the national assembly – the case for Beijing, Shanghai or Tianjin, or part of a<lb/> former larger province as in the case of Chongqing). In the rest of this paper, all provincial-level governments are<lb/> referred to as provinces.<lb/></p>

			<p>At the prefectural level, there are three types of government: prefectures, prefectural-level cities and sub-<lb/>provincial-level cities. The distinction between the first two depends on the level of urbanisation, while the latter<lb/> consists of a small group of cities that are able to bypass the provincial government and deal directly with national<lb/> government in certain areas. Municipalities do not have the prefectural level of government.<lb/></p>

			<p>At the county level, there are three types of institution: districts, county cities and counties which again can have<lb/> varying names across the country. Districts are urban areas of a prefectural-level city. Counties are generally rural<lb/> areas, though some have an urban character. County cities are counties that had an urban core of above a certain size<lb/> before 2000.<lb/> Finally, the township is lowest level of administration. In the urban areas of prefectural-level cities, this unit is<lb/> known as a sub-district. Elsewhere, it is known as a town or township depending on its size. There also exists a unit<lb/> below the township level known as a village in rural areas or neighbourhood in urban areas. They have no official<lb/> administrative role but serve as a channel of communication to the population.<lb/></p>

			<head>The structure of public finances across the country<lb/> Revenue<lb/></head>

			<p>The current tax system was put in place in 1994. A value-added tax (VAT) on goods replaced scores<lb/> of cascading indirect taxes. Income tax thresholds were lowered, leading a much larger proportion of<lb/> employees to pay income tax. This new system replaced &quot; tax farming &quot; , under which provincial<lb/> governments negotiated a payment to central government and could retain all remaining tax revenues.<lb/> The Chinese national government budget (which excludes social security funds) relies predominately<lb/> on indirect and company taxation for revenue. Within these two groups VAT dominates. It will become<lb/> even more dominant once the business tax (a sales tax on services) is rolled into the VAT. Moreover these<lb/> two sets of taxes have tended to grow much faster than national income. Company taxes, though, are more<lb/> sensitive to cyclical fluctuations than the VAT. By 2011, these three taxes accounted for close to 85% of<lb/> all national tax revenue (<ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>). Individual income tax, which has been in place for three decades,<lb/> provides limited revenue. The yield from personal income taxation is one-third the yield of corporate tax<lb/> and 10% of the yield of indirect taxation. When introduced in 1983, the threshold for payment of income<lb/> tax was set at 12 times average earnings. In 1999, it was lowered to slightly below average earnings. The<lb/> threshold was raised at the end of 2011 to 90% of average earnings.<lb/></p>

			<head>Tax assignment<lb/></head>

			<p>In China, local governments have no discretionary power to raise taxation, though they can lower<lb/> taxation by granting tax holidays for new investors. The central government sets the legislation governing<lb/> taxation and the rate of each tax. Local authorities have no autonomy in the area of taxation in only four<lb/> OECD countries (<ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>). In China the central government assigns various portions of taxes directly to<lb/> local governments. The precise share varies from tax to tax. Just under half of tax revenues are assigned<lb/> exclusively to either the central or the local governments: pure central government taxes relate to foreign<lb/> trade or excise taxes on tobacco, alcohol, petroleum products, cars and jewellery (known collectively as the<lb/> consumption tax); pure local government taxes cover services and property. The remaining portion of tax<lb/> revenue is shared between central and local governments and accounts for slightly more than half of total<lb/> tax revenue. Overall the share accrued to the central government is around 70% (</p>

			<p>The largest tax assigned to provincial governments is that on services, known as the business tax<lb/> (<ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>). This tax complements VAT which is only levied on goods. However, its existence is an<lb/> anomaly as all goods-specific (and hence cascading) taxes were abolished in 1994 and replaced by VAT on<lb/> goods. The government is committed to merging the business tax with VAT. The first pilot was undertaken<lb/> in Shanghai in 2011 and was widened in September 2012 to Beijing, Tianjin, Shenzhen and Xiamen, as<lb/> well as the provinces of Guangdong, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Fujian and Hubei (<ref type="biblio">Brys and Matthews,<lb/> 2013</ref>). In 2013, the business tax will be replaced by VAT in the following economic zones: Bohai, Yangtze<lb/> River Delta and Yangtze River, Pearl River Delta and the Straits economic zones.<lb/> The remaining taxes assigned to local governments are based mostly on the value or quantity of local<lb/> assets. Taxes on property have been particularly buoyant in the decade to 2011, rising by a compound<lb/> growth rate of 33% to approach 2% of GDP. In addition, property developers have to pay the business tax<lb/> of the value of their sales. This tax is estimated to raise a further 0.5% of GDP in revenue. It is, though,<lb/> more of tax on goods and services than a tax on property – even if investment goods are usually exempt<lb/> from such taxes. Since 2011, householders who sell an apartment within two years of purchase have to pay<lb/> the business tax. Overall, taxes levied on the use of property amount to 0.7% of GDP while taxes on the<lb/> sale of property raise around 1.2% of GDP (excluding the business tax).<lb/></p>

			<p>Each level of sub-national government shares their tax income with the levels of government below.<lb/> Provinces use various mechanisms: i) the sharing of specific taxes; ii) the assignment of specific taxes; iii)<lb/> the sharing of the increase in the yield from a base year; and iv) the assignment of an amount that depends<lb/> on a predetermined growth rate. On average, the largest share of all local taxes is taken by the prefectural<lb/> governments (<ref type="table">Table 2</ref>). This is true of all individual local taxes except the property and resource taxes,<lb/> which mainly accrue to county and township governments. There are considerable differences both across<lb/> and within provinces in the distribution of taxes to lower-level authorities.<lb/></p>

			<head>Other sources of revenue<lb/></head>

			<p>Sub-national governments have non-tax revenue from fees, levies, penalties and the profit from the<lb/> sale of land-use rights. Overall, non-tax sources of revenue represent slightly under half of their total<lb/> revenues, amounting to 2.2% of GDP (<ref type="table">Table 3</ref>). Sub-national governments have significant income from<lb/> the ownership of state-owned enterprises, in contrast to the central government. The total amount of non-<lb/>tax income (excluding asset sales) amounts to nearly 30% of their total revenue.<lb/> In the past, fees were major part of non-tax revenue. They were administered through off-budget<lb/> funds mainly to fund education and transport. Since 2012, all fees have been administered through the<lb/> budget but reliance on fees remains. Indeed, these fees are one of the three elements of local governments&apos;<lb/> fiscal autonomy. The other two are income from land sales that accrues to extra-budgetary funds and the<lb/> financing of infrastructure though infrastructure development companies (which are a reflection of the<lb/> balanced budget requirements for local authorities that is embedded in the Budget Law).<lb/> On top of the non-tax revenue, sub-national governments raise significant amounts from the sale of<lb/> land-use rights for periods of between 30 and 70 years. These stem from the government&apos;s ownership of all<lb/> urban land and its monopoly of the right to transform land from agricultural to construction use. In 2009,<lb/> the gross revenue from these sales amounted to some 4.2% of GDP, rising to over 7% in 2010 and 2011,<lb/> before falling to just over 5% of GDP in 2012. However, not all of the land sale revenues represent profit<lb/> for the government, as compensation needs to be paid. In addition the land is sold fully serviced. The cost<lb/> of installing the road, water, drainage, electricity and telecom networks has to be deducted from the gross<lb/> sales revenue. In 2009, these two cost elements absorbed half of gross sales revenue. The net revenue from<lb/> land sales is concentrated on the county and prefecture governments where the profit from land sales is<lb/> equivalent to some 14% of their total revenue. By contrast, when the property market was in its infancy in<lb/> 1999, net land sales revenues accounted for only 4.5% of revenue. These governments are constrained as to<lb/> the use that is made of such revenues: they can only be used to create new physical assets for the<lb/> government.<lb/></p>

			<p>The Constitution sets out the extent of the autonomy of sub-national governments and determines the<lb/> division of functions and powers between the central and local state organs. The division of powers is<lb/> guided by the principle of giving full scope to the initiative and enthusiasm of the local authorities under<lb/> the unified leadership of the central authorities.<lb/></p>

			<p>The people&apos;s congresses of provinces, and their respective standing committees, may adopt local<lb/> regulations. These must not contravene the Constitution, the law or the national administrative rules and<lb/> regulations. Local congresses must report such local regulations to the Standing Committee of the National<lb/> People&apos;s Congress for the record.<lb/></p>

			<p>The split of responsibilities is set out in the Constitution. Local governments at and above the county<lb/> level conduct administrative work concerning the economy, education, science, culture, public health,<lb/> physical culture, urban and rural development, finance, civil affairs, public security, ethnic affairs, judicial<lb/> administration and family planning in their respective administrative areas. They also appoint or remove<lb/> administrative functionaries.<lb/> Local governments at and above the county level also direct the work of their subordinate departments<lb/> and of lower level governments, and have the power to alter or annul inappropriate decisions of their<lb/> subordinate departments and of lower-level governments. At the same time, they have some autonomy<lb/> within the limits of their authority and implement the laws and policies of the state in light of the existing<lb/> local situation. This hierarchical structure limits the extent to which decentralisation leads to policies that<lb/> differ markedly across the country.<lb/> Indeed, a close look at local government expenditure decisions reveals a highly centralised system in<lb/> which local governments are effectively agents acting on behalf of the central government (OECD, 2006a).<lb/> The contrast between the nominal decentralisation of responsibilities and the high degree of centralisation<lb/> of actual authority is further accentuated by the lack of elections or other formal mechanisms for holding<lb/> local officials accountable to the citizens under their jurisdiction. Moreover, the performance of<lb/> government officials at lower levels is judged according to criteria set out by higher levels of government.<lb/> Thus, although comparisons of the share of spending by sub-national governments in total public spending<lb/> appear to show that China has amongst the most decentralised public sectors in the world, this is<lb/> misleading.<lb/></p>

			<p>Without being autonomous, sub-national bodies make outlays accounting for around four-fifths of all<lb/> government expenditure (<ref type="table">Table 4</ref>). The central government only spends one-fifth of total outlays. The<lb/> county level of government accounts for more than one-third of total spending and has the major share of<lb/> outlays, followed by the prefecture governments. Moreover, local government finances many public<lb/> infrastructure investment projects off-budget through local government financing platforms. Adding such<lb/> quasi-government spending, results in a further increases the share of sub-national spending.<lb/></p>

			<p>Although they account for only one-fifth of total sub-national public spending, provincial<lb/> governments are active in most types of outlays (<ref type="table">Table 5</ref>). A large part of provincial expenditure is<lb/> focussed on economic affairs (such outlays on various industries, science and technology and<lb/> transportation) which require a strategic focus (<ref type="biblio">Kamal-Chaoui et al., 2009</ref>). Nonetheless, provincial<lb/> governments allocate almost 60% of their spending to outlays that are mainly undertaken by lower levels<lb/> of government (education, health and the social safety net). Social security spending is also decentralised.<lb/> These types of expenditure assignments are generally central government functions, as social security<lb/> programmes generally entail risk pooling and redistribution in order to guard against economic shocks that<lb/> only affect one area and to ensure that poor neighbourhoods are not overburdened by social payments<lb/> (OECD, 2010).<lb/></p>

			<p>Over the past decade, the share of spending undertaken by local authorities has increased markedly<lb/> (<ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>). This reflected a major change in the orientation of public spending towards spending on public<lb/> services rather than economic services – in line with the conclusions of an OECD report on Chinese public<lb/> finances (OECD, 2006a). This re-orientation followed a seven-year period when the government restored<lb/> spending after its collapse during the first half of the 1990s. The increase in sub-national public spending<lb/> was particularly pronounced at the prefectural and county levels as these are the levels of government that<lb/> deliver services to people.<lb/> Higher-level government has the power to determine the expenditure responsibilities of the level<lb/> immediately below it: provinces determine the assignments of prefectures, prefectures the assignments of<lb/> districts, counties and county cities, and the latter two the assignments of townships (<ref type="biblio">Shen et al., 2012</ref>).<lb/> Consequently some have argued that higher-level governments have been increasingly devolving<lb/> assignments to lower local levels of government (<ref type="biblio">Kamal-Chaoui et al., 2009; Li et al., 2010</ref>). The devolved<lb/> categories include not only pre-determined sub-national responsibilities, such as urban maintenance and<lb/> construction, but also the incremental part of service provision for education and healthcare spending. In<lb/> reality, though, this downward movement of expenditure reflected a change in spending priorities towards<lb/> those services provided at the sub-national level (especially at the county level) that was approved in<lb/> budgets by the National People&apos;s Congress.<lb/></p>

			<head>Vertical balance between expenditure and revenue<lb/></head>

			<p>The gaps between fiscal resources (tax and non-tax, but excluding transfers) and expenditure depend<lb/> on the position of the authority in the vertical hierarchy of government (<ref type="table">Table 6</ref>). For sub-national<lb/> government as a whole, expenditure has grown much faster than fiscal resources. The gap between fiscal<lb/> resources and expenditure is particularly marked for rural counties, where fiscal revenue amounts to only<lb/> slightly more than one quarter of their expenditure. The gap is much lower for the more urban county cities<lb/> and falls yet again in the urban districts of prefectural level cities.<lb/></p>

			<head>Horizontal balance between regions<lb/></head>

			<p>Economic and fiscal inequality between regions is much higher in China than in most OECD<lb/> countries (<ref type="table">Table 7</ref>). The tax sharing arrangements do not incorporate any redistributive formula and so the<lb/> inequality of tax revenue per capita is very similar to the inequality of GDP per capita. Indeed, in China<lb/> there is no correlation between the average tax rate for each province and its level of development. There is<lb/> considerable variation in the average tax rate due to factors linked to the structure of the economy of each<lb/> province. An analysis of variance suggests that around 80% of the variation in tax revenues per capita is<lb/> due the variation of per capita GDP, rather than tax rates.<lb/></p>

			<p>The way in which the economic structure of a province interacts with the tax assignments is one<lb/> reason for the variation in tax rates. For corporate taxes, when companies operate across several provinces,<lb/> it is extremely difficult to allocate profit between provinces. An allocation using value added, employment<lb/> or assets would transform the tax into a tax on the factor used as a key for allocation rather than a tax on<lb/> profits. Consequently, the entire profit of a company is allocated to the province where the company has its<lb/> headquarters. As a result Beijing and Shanghai have particularly high revenues from this source. Equally,<lb/> the tax sharing agreement allocates all taxes on services to provinces. However, service activities are not<lb/> distributed equally across the nation and here Beijing and Shanghai benefit again. Hainan though gains<lb/> ECO/WKP(2013)22<lb/> from its large tourist industry (<ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref>). On the other hand, for value-added tax and other local taxes, there<lb/> is much less variation across provinces (<ref type="table">Table 8</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<head>Fiscal disparities within provinces<lb/></head>

			<p>Fiscal disparities are starker within than across provinces. Horizontal fiscal disparity measured by<lb/> Gini coefficient at the sub-provincial level is 0.53, well above the provincial level figure of 0.31 (Tables 7<lb/> and 9). The Theil index shows that 75% of the overall national disparity can be attributed to within-<lb/>province factors. In particular, fiscal disparity among counties or county cities is substantially higher than<lb/> across prefecture-level cities (PLCs) and urban districts. The levels of the inequality indices suggest that<lb/> the principal problem of differences in tax revenue per capita occur in county areas. This inequality is<lb/> related to the very different economic experience of counties across a province. As shown in <ref type="biblio">Herd et al.<lb/> (forthcoming)</ref>, there are many counties and county cities that are, in reality as urban as urban districts<lb/> according to the metrics of either population density or gross local product per capita.<lb/></p>

			<p>Note: The Theil index provides a way to measure the discrepancy between the structure of the distribution of income (or another<lb/> variable) across groups and the structure of the distribution of individuals across those same groups. The Theil inequality index<lb/> summarises the distribution of a variable by calculating sum of the logarithms of the quotient of value for a group and the average for<lb/> all groups weighted by the share of the group. For example, when all population groups have the same income share as their<lb/> population share then the Theil index is zero. In this case, the calculation assumes that prefectures spend all their revenue in their<lb/> urban districts rather than in counties.<lb/></p>

			<p>Within-province disparities in expenditure are also large, signalling limited service provision capacity<lb/> in some counties. Overall, the richest sub-provincial unit spends about 29 times as much per capita as the<lb/> poorest unit. The ratios between extremes are 13 times within PLCs, 15 times within county cities, and 26<lb/> times within counties (Ministry of Finance, 2011a). In particular, unlike PLCs and county cities, counties<lb/> with limited fiscal resources have less leeway to provide matching funds for additional spending mandates<lb/> requested from superior authorities. This could result in substandard service delivery, for instance in<lb/> renovating school facilities in poor rural areas (<ref type="biblio">Shen et al., 2012</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<head>Inter-governmental transfers<lb/> Tax sharing<lb/></head>

			<p>In China, almost half of national tax revenue is allocated to local governments through tax-sharing<lb/> agreements. Tax sharing can take several forms. Following <ref type="biblio">Blöchliger and Petzold (2010)</ref>, strict tax<lb/> sharing between government levels implies meeting four criteria simultaneously:<lb/></p>

			<p>• Individual proportionality: The revenue share of each sub-central government is strictly related to<lb/> tax revenue generated on its own territory.<lb/> • Risk sharing: the amount of revenue allocated to the sub-central level is strictly related to the<lb/> total tax intake.<lb/> • Un-conditionality: The sub-central government is free to use the allocated revenue.<lb/> • Formula stability: The revenue share between the central and the sub-central government is<lb/> predetermined in advance and not changed during the period of the agreement.<lb/> China is unusual in that its tax-sharing system follows the strict model outlined above, in contrast to nearly<lb/> all OECD countries (<ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref>). Despite having no authority to borrow, sub-national governments are fully<lb/> exposed to the risk of fluctuations in tax revenues from either a factor specific to one province or general<lb/> business cycle fluctuations. The exposure to volatility is particular large for their share of corporate income<lb/> tax. They are also free to allocate the cash in line with their spending priorities subject to the overall<lb/> priorities set by the National People&apos;s Congress. There is individual proportionality in allocating taxes,<lb/> which encourages local governments to boost economic activity in their jurisdiction.<lb/></p>

			<p>There is a well-defined formula for allocating different taxes, which has been slightly changed three<lb/> times since 1994. It has not been altered since 2003, when the central share in income taxes was raised<lb/> from 50 to 60%, the share of stamp duty on financial transactions rose from 50 to 97%, and the business<lb/> tax on the financial industry was assigned to the central government. Since the 1990s, the proportion of<lb/> total expenditure undertaken by sub-national government has risen considerably. The discrepancy between<lb/> a fixed revenue share and rising expenditure share has driven much of the growth in vertical fiscal<lb/> inequalities: by the time the system devised in 1994 was fully operational in 1999, the aggregate tax share<lb/> of sub-national government was 46% while their expenditure share was 69%; and by 2011, the tax share<lb/> had remained constant at 46% of total tax revenues, while the expenditure share had risen to 85%. A<lb/> mechanical calculation suggests that if the average tax share were raised to 62%, the gap between<lb/> expenditure and revenue would be lowered to the level observed in 1999. This would eliminate the gap<lb/> between revenue and expenditure for the aggregate of provincial, prefecture, urban districts and county<lb/> cities. The remaining fiscal gaps would be found almost exclusively at county level and would presumably<lb/> be concentrated in the poorest counties.<lb/></p>

			<head>Transfers<lb/></head>

			<p>One of the stated objectives of the 1994 tax reform was to recentralise decision-making and enable the<lb/> central government to better control policy implementation across the country. In order to accommodate a<lb/> strong increase in the share of expenditure in the areas covered by sub-national government not matched<lb/> by increased tax revenues, the government designed a new transfer system, which has three components:<lb/> • General transfers used to lower disparities in expenditure.<lb/> • Earmarked transfers used to subsidise local projects in certain areas subject to matching outlays<lb/> by local government.<lb/> • Compensation transfers designed to reduce the revenue loss accruing to some local governments<lb/> after the 1994 tax reform.<lb/></p>

			<p>Each of the three groups has a number of sub-components (<ref type="figure">Figure 7</ref>). Some of the grants under the general<lb/> transfer component resemble earmarked grants. However, they do not require matching funds. Moreover<lb/> they accrue to provinces according to their GDP per capita. The wage adjustment grant varies by a factor<lb/> of four between eastern and western provinces. The compulsory education grant is only paid to rural<lb/> counties and compensated for the abolition of the agricultural tax, previously used to fund education.<lb/></p>

			<p>Immediately after the 1994 tax reform, the predominant form of transfer was that which compensated<lb/> regions that had lost as a result of the tax reform. The formula was designed to ensure that the grant<lb/> component fell gradually relative to GDP. As local tax receipts failed to keep up with expenditure, the<lb/> share of general and earmarked transfers rose (<ref type="figure">Figure 8</ref>). By 2011, these forms of transfer dominated.<lb/> There are some 20 categories of over 100 different recurrent transfers classified as earmarked transfers<lb/> while there are 18 types of relatively fixed types of grants defined as general transfers. The main form of<lb/> general transfer is the equalisation transfer, accounting for 19% of total transfers in 2011. It aims to lower<lb/> spending inequality across the country (Box 2).<lb/></p>

			<head>Box 2. The design of the equalisation transfer<lb/></head>

			<p>The formula used to calculate this transfer is based on the gap between standard revenue capacity and standard<lb/> current expenditures. The former is estimated using the tax bases and standard tax rates, while the latter are<lb/> calculated based on different per capital spending for different categories of outlays for adjusted cost factors such as<lb/> altitude, population density, temperature, transport distance and the proportion of the population belonging to minority<lb/> groups. The categories of spending include administration services, public safety, education, urban maintenance,<lb/> healthcare, environmental protection and social assistance.<lb/></p>

			<p>The transfer amount is also adjusted for coefficients that take into account the size of the standard gap, the<lb/> actual gap, and the total amount allocated from central government revenue. Moreover, rewards in terms of additional<lb/> grants are given to provinces that achieve better fiscal equalisation results at sub-provincial levels (top five<lb/> performers).<lb/> Algebraically, the amount of the equalisation transfer for a province is given by:<lb/></p>

				<formula>񮽙񮽙 񮽙 = =<lb/> 񮽙񮽙 񮽙 − − 񮽙<lb/> −<lb/> 񮽙 񮽙 + Δ 񮽙 + + 񮽙<lb/></formula>

			<p>where:<lb/></p>

			<p>ETi = the equalisation transfer for province i<lb/> TET = total equalisation grant available in the budget year. The size is determined by the increase in the shared<lb/> income tax allotted to the central government, plus an extra amount allocated on an ad-hoc basis, subject to annual<lb/> funding availability.<lb/></p>

It is the sum of total standardised spending for 14 sectors. For each<lb/> sector, the standard national average standard expenditure per registered inhabitant is calculated. The national<lb/> average is then converted to a provincial average by adjusting for cost differences caused by the difference from the<lb/> national average of altitude, population density, temperature, transport distances, the number of civil servants, regional<lb/> wage differentials, number of students and the prevalence of minority groups. The cost factors vary according to the<lb/> spending category. Total standardised spending was calculated as the product of standardised spending per<lb/> registered inhabitant and the number of registered inhabitants (irrespective of where they actually live) during the<lb/> period 1995 to 2011. Since 2012, the population measure used is the registered population plus 15% of the difference<lb/> between the actual population and the registered population.<lb/> SRi = standard revenue of province i. For each type of tax, standard tax revenue is determined by multiplying the<lb/> standard tax base with the standard tax rate.<lb/> SE = total standard expenditure of the country.<lb/> SR = total standard revenue of the country.<lb/> σi = fiscal difficulty index of province i, calculated as the sum of spending on wages for civil servants, operating<lb/> expenses and payments for the basic livelihood allowance as a percentage to standard revenue.<lb/> ∆i = adjustment index of province i based on the difference between the change in the actual grant and the<lb/> baseline predicted amount.<lb/> REi = reward grant allotted to province i, if any (only to top five performers of fiscal equalisation results at sub-<lb/>provincial levels).<lb/> Originally only 18 provinces were eligible for equalisation transfers. This was widened to 25 in 2002 and has remained<lb/> constant since. Six provinces remain ineligible for such transfer: Beijing, Guangdong, Jiangsu, Shanghai, Tianjin and<lb/> Zhejiang.<lb/></p>

			<head>The grant system favours poorer areas<lb/></head>

			<p>The strong weight given to the transfers designed to help poorer areas has successfully boosted<lb/> incomes in these areas. One metric to assess the success is the extent to which transfers to different areas<lb/> when measured relative to that area&apos;s GDP fall as GDP per capita increases. Across provinces, this is<lb/> indeed the case (<ref type="figure">Figure 9</ref>). Broadly speaking a 10% decline in relative income (from 50% to 45% of<lb/> average income) is associated with an increase of transfers of 1.2 percentage points of GDP. Other factors<lb/> are also important in determining the extent of the transfer.<lb/></p>

			<figure>ECO/WKP(2013)22<lb/> Figure 9. Transfers to provinces and the level of development<lb/> 2009, Percentage of regional GDP, excluding Qinghai and Tibet<lb/> Source: OECD calculations and Ministry of Finance (2011a), 2009 Fiscal Statistics of Prefectures, Cities and Counties<lb/></figure>

			<p>The increasing importance of transfers for poorer areas is seen not just at the province level but also at<lb/> the county level. The bulk of counties receive transfers of less than 50% of their local GDP. Over the range<lb/> of transfers of zero to halve of local GDP (the bulk of all counties), there is a visible relationship between<lb/> the extent of the grant relative to local GDP and income levels (<ref type="figure">Figure 10</ref>, Panel A). However, once grants<lb/> account for more than halve of local GDP, reaching in a few cases over 200% of local GDP, other factors<lb/> become more important in determining grants. For these counties grants are not closely relative to local<lb/> GDP per capita (<ref type="figure">Figure 10</ref>, Panel B).<lb/> In practice, compensation grants have tended to reduce the extent of fiscal discrepancies over time.<lb/> While the major losers from the 1994 tax reform were higher income areas, which therefore initially<lb/> received more compensation, a 1% increase in per capita income is associated with only a ½ per cent<lb/> increase in compensation tax payments. Thus the compensation payment per unit of local GDP declines<lb/> with rising income. In any event, poorer regions are now more dependent on compensation grants than<lb/> richer ones are. At the level of the prefecture, for instance, the 50 prefectures with the lowest per capita<lb/> GDP are twice as dependent on this form of transfer as the 50 prefectures with the highest income.<lb/></p>

			<p>The total of all other transfers has a much stronger redistributive effect than the compensation transfer.<lb/> At both the prefecture and the county level, there is a negative relation between this type of transfer and<lb/> GDP per capita. The relationship is much stronger at the prefecture level than at the county level. In both<lb/> cases, however, the overall explanatory value of income per capita in determining the level of transfers is<lb/> low, indicating that there are many other variables that come into play when determining the scale of sub-<lb/>national transfers.<lb/></p>

			<p>At present, most weight is given to the registered population when determining the overall grant to a<lb/> province. If the outcome of the allocation is measured in terms of the transfer per registered inhabitant in<lb/> provinces, then there is no correlation between the income level of the province and the per capita grant<lb/> received by the province (<ref type="figure">Figure 11</ref>, panel A). To a first approximation, then, the average grant is the same<lb/> for each province on a per capita basis, with fluctuations according to the specific characteristics of the<lb/> province. However, just as a flat-rate per capita tax is regressive, a flat rate per capita transfer is<lb/> progressive, giving a higher increase in government revenue in poor provinces than in rich provinces. This<lb/> result, however, is due entirely to the high level of transfers per registered inhabitant that are received by<lb/> Beijing, Shanghai and Tianjin. Over the other 28 provinces and municipalities, there is a strong negative<lb/> relationship between per capita GDP and the total transfer per registered inhabitant (<ref type="figure">Figure 11</ref>, panel B).<lb/></p>

			<p>The method of calculating the equalisation grant was changed in 2012 to take the number of migrants<lb/> into account. The population used to calculate the per capita data was defined as the registered population<lb/> plus 15% of the difference between the actual and the registered population. This change will tend to<lb/> reduce the extent to which inter-provincial redistribution via transfers is correlated with income. However,<lb/> the equity of spending within provinces could be improved if provinces followed the same rules in making<lb/> their grants and higher transfers resulted in more spending on services for migrants.<lb/></p>

			<head>The use of earmarked transfers<lb/></head>

			<p>Intergovernmental transfers can serve several objectives (<ref type="biblio">Oates, 1999; Ahmad and Searle, 2005</ref>;<lb/> <ref type="biblio">Blöchliger and Vammalle, 2009; OECD/KIPF, 2012</ref>). Three goals stand out:<lb/> • Fiscal equalisation across jurisdictions for public service provision.<lb/> • Correction of negative and positive spillovers to induce the right amount of services.<lb/> • Provision of certain types and standards of services as determined by the central government.<lb/> Achieving these goals requires the combined use of &quot; unconditional grants &quot; (general transfers), and<lb/> &quot; conditional grants &quot; (earmarked transfers). The trade-off is complicated, with unconditional grants<lb/> providing more local autonomy but requiring local capacity and accountability, and conditional grants<lb/> giving the central government more control to meet its objectives (OECD, 2012 and Blöchliger and<lb/></p>

In practice, the share of unconditional versus conditional grants in China is well within<lb/> the (very wide) ranges observed in the OECD (Figures 12 and 13). This share has remained broadly stable<lb/> over the past decade.<lb/></p>

			<p>There are over 100 different types of earmarked grants, all of which are allocated on an ad hoc or<lb/> negotiated basis (Ministry of Finance, 2012b). Moreover, many of the grants are determined by individual<lb/> ministries and are not controlled by the Ministry of Finance. This undermines transparency relative to a<lb/> rule-based system. In particular, the system favours localities that lobby harder rather than those in greater<lb/> need. Furthermore, the centre lacks the monitoring mechanisms to ensure the effective use of these<lb/> earmarked resources, especially at sub-provincial levels (<ref type="biblio">Ahmad et al., 2004; Shen et al., 2012</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<head>The impact of the transfer system on fiscal inequality<lb/></head>

			<p>China&apos;s transfer policy has become markedly more redistributive over the past decade. By 2010, the<lb/> reduction in the inter-provincial inequality through transfers was larger in China than in the OECD area<lb/> (<ref type="table">Table 10</ref>). The correlation between transfers per capita and GDP per capita, which was positive in 2000,<lb/> had turned markedly negative by 2010. Despite the reduction in spending inequality, the fiscal disparity per<lb/> capita is high in China as compared with OECD countries. However, there is markedly less inequality in<lb/> fiscal spending than in GDP per capita.<lb/></p>

			<head>Revenue disparities within provinces have been reduced<lb/></head>

			<p>The large disparities within provinces have also been narrowed by intergovernmental transfers in<lb/> recent years. This finding contrasts with the general observation in the literature that the transfer system<lb/> had not reduced fiscal disparities at the sub-provincial level (<ref type="biblio">Liu and Shih, 2004; Tsui, 2005; Zhang and<lb/> Zheng, 2010</ref>). This is at least partly because few of these studies rest on recent data. By 2009, the overall<lb/> redistributive effects of the transfers at the prefecture and county/district levels had become quite strong.<lb/> For instance, transfers reduced the Theil index across all levels of sub-national government by 65% while<lb/> the Gini coefficient was reduced from 0.53 to 0.32 (<ref type="table">Table 11</ref>). The fall in national fiscal inequality has<lb/> been driven by a fall of within-province inequality at the county level.<lb/></p>

			<p>Nevertheless, disparities within provinces remain high. Despite the great efforts in reducing<lb/> disparities within provinces, the sub-provincial Gini coefficient remains at 0.32, much higher than the 0.18<lb/> at the provincial level (<ref type="table">Table 10</ref>). Across prefectures regional inequality is quite low. On the other hand,<lb/> they do not appear to have been as successful in reducing fiscal inequalities in the counties for which they<lb/> are responsible. One particular problem for county governments is that earmarked transfers often require<lb/> matching funds which may not be available at county level.<lb/></p>

			<p>The extent of fiscal equalisation within a province varies across provinces. High provincial income<lb/> levels are not associated with low intra-province inequalities, and vice versa (<ref type="figure">Figure 14</ref>). For instance, the<lb/> coastal provinces of Guangdong, Jiangsu and Shandong display high incomes and high inequality. Even so,<lb/> overall, between 2000 and 2010, there was a marked reduction in within-province inequality: the provinces<lb/> with the highest initial fiscal inequality registered the largest drops (<ref type="figure">Figure 15</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<head>Within provinces disparities in spending and service provision<lb/></head>

			<p>In many sectors, the delivery of public services largely depends on the number people employed in<lb/> particular service areas. The bulk of local public spending on education, healthcare and general public<lb/> services are salaries paid to civil servants, teachers, doctors and government administrative staff. Across<lb/> provinces, there is much less disparity in the number of government employees than in overall spending<lb/> (<ref type="figure">Figure 16</ref>, panel A). The dispersion in public spending within a province does not appear to be associated<lb/> with the level of income (<ref type="figure">Figure 16</ref>, Panel B). The dispersion of spending within a province does, however,<lb/> appear to be correlated with the dispersion of government employment (<ref type="figure">Figure 16</ref>, Panel C). However, the<lb/> dispersion of government employment within a province is extremely low – a Gini coefficient of around<lb/> 0.03 seems typical. This might indicate that basic services are being provided on an equal basis, certainly<lb/> on a much more equal basis than the expenditure data would suggest.<lb/></p>

			<p>Equalising basic public services across the country is a national strategic goal. It is now seen as one of<lb/> the fundamental goals for building a harmonious society through scientific development (<ref type="biblio">CCP, 2006</ref>). In<lb/> 2012, the government set out a five year plan for improving basic public services that would form the basis<lb/> for equalising basic public services for everyone by 2020 (<ref type="table">Table 12</ref>). Specifically, the plan stresses the<lb/> need to further reduce the impact of regional disparities on the provision of basic services in order to<lb/> equalise access to services whether the person lives in an urban or a rural area. The Plan sets the scope,<lb/> standard and mechanism to deliver such services in public education, labour and employment services,<lb/></p>

			<p>In particular, the Plan addresses the issue of migrants, echoing the national policy framework on promoting<lb/> sound urbanisation. The central government demands sub-national governments to improve public services<lb/> for migrants in the areas of education, pension, healthcare and housing. Moreover, the urbanisation<lb/> framework identifies the improvement of urban infrastructure as a priority, given the existing deficit in<lb/> provision (<ref type="biblio">Herd et al., forthcoming</ref>).<lb/> To achieve the service delivery target, the Plan calls for improving public finances by:<lb/></p>

			<p>• clearly defining intergovernmental assignments and spending responsibilities across government<lb/> tiers, and in particular assign pension and healthcare spending to provincial governments;<lb/> • improving the intergovernmental transfer system, by increasing the percentage of general<lb/> transfers and increasing the percentage of rules-based transfers and raising their amount<lb/> especially at sub-provincial levels;<lb/> • promoting a sound public finance supporting system, by allocating certain profits from SOEs to<lb/> service provision and improving the fiscal resources available to counties;<lb/> • prioritising spending on health and social protection rather than &quot; economic activities &quot; .<lb/> The government has highlighted the use of general transfers as means of increasing equality of access to<lb/> basic public services. This could involve, for example, grouping different earmarked project grants on<lb/> education together into a block general purpose grant allocated to education. Local government would<lb/> receive broad targets from higher governments rather than specific requirement to spend the money on<lb/> specific elements in education. The number of such general purpose transfers has increased in the past few<lb/> years and most involve some form of differentiation according to the relative income level of the province<lb/> or its geographic location. Another approach would be to increase the size of the general grants whose<lb/> most important element is funded by allocating the funds raised by the tax on personal incomes.<lb/></p>

			<head>Property taxation<lb/></head>

			<p>The introduction of taxation on residential property has been under consideration since 2003 as a<lb/> means of improving local tax revenue. China does have both property and land taxes but they do not apply<lb/> to residential real estate. The government has considered introducing a new residential property tax that<lb/> might be used either to raise local spending or to reduce the reliance of local governments on transfers<lb/> from higher levels of government. Most local governments in the OECD raise revenues from recurrent<lb/> taxation on residential property in their area. This form of taxation provides a linkage between the level of<lb/> local taxation and the provision of local services. It is a more common form of local taxation than local<lb/> income or sales taxes as property cannot be moved whereas the tax base for a sales tax or an income tax<lb/> can easily move. From the point of view of resource allocation, if the property tax can be levied<lb/> exclusively on land rather than on the building on the land, then such a tax is one of the least distortionary<lb/> taxes.<lb/> Five types of taxes are levied on property and land transactions in China (<ref type="table">Table 13</ref>). Using the OECD<lb/> classification of taxes, only two of these would be classified as property taxes as they are levied annually<lb/> and based on the ownership of property. Such taxes have not been levied on residential property since<lb/> 2007. Two of the other taxes are based on transactions either of property or land (but only when the land<lb/> changes use from agricultural to constructed land). In addition, there is a special capital gains tax that<lb/> applies only to land transactions. The tax on property transactions is one of the few taxes for which a<lb/> provincial government can set the rate (23 set the rate at 3%, six at 4% and two at 5%). In addition, if a<lb/> property in held for less than five years it is subject to the business tax at a rate of 5.5% on the sale of the<lb/> property.<lb/></p>

			<p>The recurrent property tax is levied only on commercial property. There are two formulae for<lb/> calculating the tax burden: one applies a rate of 1.2% to the original value of the property less a<lb/> depreciation deduction of between 10 and 30%; the other is based on 15% of the rent generated by the<lb/> property. The urban land-use tax is based on a flat rate per occupied square metre. These two taxes are of<lb/> much less importance to the government as a source of revenue than in the OECD area (<ref type="figure">Figure 17</ref>). A<lb/> number of OECD countries raise between 3% and 4% of GDP in recurrent property taxes. Only four<lb/> OECD countries raise less than in China, where such recurrent taxes amount to 0.5% of GDP (<ref type="table">Table 14</ref>).<lb/> The low yields are a reflection of the absence of taxation on residential real estate and of the fact that the<lb/> tax on urban land use is not based on market values.<lb/></p>

			<p>Two municipalities are piloting a recurrent tax on residential property. However, the design of these<lb/> pilots is very restrictive with nearly all property exempted from paying the tax. In the first full year of the<lb/> trial, the taxes raised only CNY 100 million and CNY 300 million in Chongqing and Shanghai respectively<lb/> (0.00001% and 0.000015% of Gross Regional Product in the areas concerned).<lb/> Besides the recurrent tax on property there are also taxes on property transactions. If the tax on land<lb/> appreciation is a regarded as a tax on property, then China raises 1.2% of GDP from property transactions<lb/> – four times the level in the OECD area. The yield is so high because property values are much higher<lb/> relative to incomes in China than in the OECD area, and because the number of transactions is high due to<lb/> the high rate of house construction. These factors more than offset the low level of second-hand property<lb/> transactions and the relatively low rate of the transactions tax. Overall, the sum of taxation on transactions<lb/> and usage in China (at 1.7%) of GDP is only slightly below the OECD average of 2.0% of GDP<lb/> (<ref type="figure">Figure 17</ref>). However, the structure is more economically damaging in that it hinders turnover in the<lb/> market, though the tax on land is economically efficient.<lb/> Introducing a nationwide residential property tax would exacerbate differences in fiscal revenue<lb/> across provinces. Past experience suggests that the tax rate would be uniform across the country. In this<lb/> case, the revenue for the property tax would mainly accrue to prefectural-level cities and their districts,<lb/> where the bulk of property is situated. Moreover, the level of property prices is highly correlated with the<lb/> level of per capita income (in 2011, a 1% increase in per capita GDP was associated with a 0.7% increase<lb/> in the average selling price of new property). Thus the property tax would accrue to the local authorities<lb/> that rely least on transfers from central and provincial governments.<lb/></p>

			<p>The government also faces a dilemma in considering the introduction of a residential property tax.<lb/> Potential property buyers will estimate the present value of future property taxes and reduce the price they<lb/> are willing to pay by this discounted value. In turn this will reduce the price of the land-use right. But local<lb/> governments own all land and rely on the sale of new land-use rights to finance urban infrastructure.<lb/> Local authorities would probably lose revenue by introducing a residential property tax, at least while<lb/> the expansion of urban areas continues. If property taxes were set at a level such that annual revenues rose<lb/> to the average level in the OECD area, then the property tax rate would need to be set at 1% of the market<lb/> value of properties as urban property values are equivalent to 1.25 times GDP. Assuming a real discount<lb/> rate of 4%, this would lower house prices by 25% and land prices by 50%, given the average share of land<lb/> in property prices. In 2012 the gross revenue from land sales amounted to just over 5% of GDP, so the fall<lb/> in revenue from land-use rights would likely outweigh the increase in receipts from the property tax.<lb/> Moreover, land-lease income accrues immediately to local governments&apos; revenue, while it takes time to<lb/> realise the anticipated level of property taxation in that tax rate and coverage could only be raised gradually<lb/> from the level set in the pilot cases. Given that urbanisation is far from complete, local authorities have an<lb/> interest to maintain the current system of land sales and no property tax at least until the process of<lb/> urbanisation is nearly complete. At that point land sales will be much less important as a source of revenue.<lb/> Over the longer term, property taxation would then represent a stable source of revenue – albeit one that<lb/> would mainly accrue to the governments of richer areas.<lb/></p>

			<head>Conclusion<lb/></head>

			<p>The main features of China&apos;s current sub-national finance arrangements date back to the 1994 tax<lb/> reform. China has a multi-level government structure that shares national tax revenues through a system of<lb/> tax sharing and transfers, and divides spending assignments and responsibilities. Local governments have<lb/> hardly any discretionary power to modify taxation and are effectively agents acting on behalf of the central<lb/> government in expenditure decisions, though they have some non-tax revenue from fees, levies and<lb/> penalties. They can spend the profit from the sale of land-use rights subject to restrictions set by the central<lb/> government. As the 1994 tax reform recentralised revenues and decision-making power, vertical gaps<lb/> between revenue and expenditure at sub-national levels have grown. In order to accommodate a strong<lb/> increase in the share of expenditure in the areas covered by sub-national government that has not been<lb/> matched by increased tax revenues, the central government has increased the scale of the transfer system.<lb/> Over the past decade, China&apos;s transfer policy has addressed the horizontal imbalances and become<lb/> markedly more redistributive. Nevertheless, fiscal disparities within provinces remain high and are much<lb/> greater than between regions in OECD countries. The extent of fiscal equalisation within provinces varies,<lb/> thus affecting the delivery of services. The government&apos;s plan to equalise service provision across the<lb/> country therefore calls for fine-tuning the intergovernmental transfer system and improving local revenue.<lb/> Some local governments are testing a residential property tax but not in a form that would substantially<lb/> raise tax revenue. A significant property tax would tend to lower the revenue from the sale of land-use<lb/> rights and would, in general, improve the fiscal position of those local governments that already have<lb/> strong budgets.</p>
