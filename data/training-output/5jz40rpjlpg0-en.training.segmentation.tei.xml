			<body>1 INTRODUCTION <lb/>France embarked on high-speed rail travel almost 40 years ago. 1 Today it carries more <lb/>passengers by far on its high-speed trains than any other European country. Regarded as <lb/>something of a niche activity initially, high-speed rail has become a national priority in <lb/>France as evidenced by its 1 900-km network of high-speed lines (LGV). The lines <lb/>currently under construction will bring this total to 2 600 by 2017. <lb/>The purpose of this paper is to set out the reasons for this success and, in particular, the <lb/>propitious environment in which it was achieved: an environment which certainly does <lb/>not prevail today. Having had the political courage to launch the first high-speed line in <lb/>Europe, France will no doubt soon have to summon the courage to say that its LGV <lb/>network is almost complete. However, this will be a difficult decision to take because <lb/>France nurtures a kind of &quot; TGV mania &quot; whereby all the regions and most of the large <lb/>conurbations feel that they must have a high-speed train (TGV) service. The <lb/>development of high-speed rail in France is a practical experience which has many <lb/>lessons to offer in terms of the relevance of high-speed rail travel. <lb/> In the first part of the paper, we will present the main phases and the principal <lb/>performance characteristics of the high-speed rail system in France. We will also <lb/>explain the need to distinguish between high-speed train (TGV) and high-speed <lb/>line (LGV). <lb/> In the second part of the paper, we shall see that it is more accurate to talk about <lb/>high-speed rail systems in the plural because there are other &quot; models &quot; in Europe <lb/>which differ from the one developed by France. High-speed rail is not just a <lb/>matter of technology; it also depends on the geography of the country, on the <lb/>country&apos;s institutions and on its ability to master the art of project assessments. <lb/> The assessment question is becoming increasingly important in France as the <lb/>network develops for the simple reason that the more the LGV network expands, <lb/>the more the profitability of new sections becomes questionable. This is the issue <lb/>being shown up by the statutory ex post assessments now taking place in France. <lb/>They will help us to answer a delicate question in the third part of this paper: In <lb/>terms of LGVs, how far is not too far? Which brings us back to the question of <lb/>what should be done with the traditional rail network. <lb/>(1) The main phases and principal performance characteristics of the high-<lb/>speed rail system in France <lb/>In order to understand the success of the high-speed rail system in France, we need to <lb/>start by comparing &quot; high-speed &quot; traffic in France and in other European countries. In <lb/>1 <lb/>The decision to build a high-speed line between Paris and Lyons was taken in September <lb/>1975. <lb/></body>

			<body>Yves Crozet — Discussion Paper 2013-26 — © OECD/ITF 2013 <lb/>2010, high-speed rail traffic amounted to 52 billion passenger-kilometres in France as <lb/>against 23 billion in Germany, 11 billion in Italy and Spain, 3 billion in Sweden and <lb/>1 billion in Belgium and Great Britain. This relative domination by France can be <lb/>explained by its long-held preference for high speed: a field in which France has played <lb/>the leading role in Europe on the basis of what we might call the &quot; Paris-Lyon model &quot; . <lb/>Figure 1. High Speed Rail Traffic in Europe, 2012 (billion passenger-km) <lb/>Source : Eurostat <lb/>(a) From LGV network to TGV services <lb/>France was the first European country to embark on the high-speed rail odyssey. <lb/>Approved in 1975, the first high-speed line, between Paris and Lyon (450 km), was <lb/>opened to traffic in September 1981. It now carries more than 150 trains a day at a <lb/>cruising speed of 320 km/h. The success of that line provided the basis for extending the <lb/>network. As Box 1 and Map 1 show, the LGV network developed in star fashion,2 <lb/>radiating out from Paris. It aims to link the capital to the main cities in order to enable <lb/>TGV users to travel out and return within the day as allowed by the Paris-Lyon model. <lb/>This idea of a &quot; Paris-Lyon model &quot; helps us to understand the choices that were made to <lb/>extend the network. Whether we are talking about the local French network or its <lb/>connections with neighbouring countries (Belgium, the United Kingdom, Germany, <lb/>Luxembourg or the Netherlands), the TGV does not aim to reduce journey times for <lb/>short-and middle-distance travellers; rather, it aims to attract long-distance interurban <lb/>mobility, in other words business and leisure travellers. <lb/>High-speed rail is not part of the universal rail system which is regarded in France as the <lb/>public system. The TGV is a commercial service aimed at users who can afford to pay. <lb/>Only about 10%-15% of the French population use the TGV on a regular basis. That <lb/>often-overlooked statistic explains why a TGV service cannot run profitably to all <lb/>destinations. SNCF (French National Railways Company), the state-owned company <lb/>which operates the TGV in France, often points out that, from its own point of view, it is <lb/>2 <lb/>The same logic was applied in the 19th century at the beginning of the railway age. In France, people <lb/>speak of the &quot; Legrand star &quot; after the name of the engineer who devised the layout of the first French rail <lb/>network. <lb/>0 <lb/>10 <lb/>20 <lb/>30 <lb/>40 <lb/>50 <lb/>60 <lb/>France Germany <lb/>Spain <lb/>Italy <lb/>Sweden Belgium <lb/>United <lb/>Kingdom <lb/></body>

			<body>5 <lb/>only the routes serving Paris that are financially viable. There is little potential traffic <lb/>between second-rank cities such as Lille and Lyon or Lyon and Nantes. There are direct <lb/>TGV services between those cities, but SNCF finances them through cross-subsidies from <lb/>profitable routes, those which serve Paris. <lb/>Box 1. The main dates of LGV network extensions in France <lb/>1981: opening of the Paris-Lyon line (serving the south-east). <lb/>1989: opening of the Paris-Tours line (serving the south-west and Brittany). <lb/>1993: opening of the Paris-Lille line (serving northern France, Brussels and London). <lb/>2001: opening of the Lyon-Marseille line (serving the Mediterranean). <lb/>2007: opening of the Paris-Est line (serving Lorraine, Alsace, Luxembourg and Germany). <lb/>2011: opening of the first section of the Rhin-Rhône line (first section not linked directly to Paris). <lb/>2011-2012: Launch of works on four new lines: Tours-Bordeaux (south-west), Bretagne-Pays de <lb/>Loire (west), extension of the TGV Est line as far as Strasbourg, Nîmes-Montpellier bypass. These <lb/>four lines will open in 2017. <lb/>2013: A ten-member ministerial commission comprising members of parliament and experts 3 <lb/>recommends delaying or abandoning several LGV projects. Only the Bordeaux-Toulouse line may <lb/>open before 2030. <lb/>Cross-subsidies between lines go a long way towards explaining the development of the <lb/>high-speed rail system in France. Thanks to those subsidies, it has been possible to <lb/>develop a TGV service even in towns that are located far from LGV lines. Because TGVs <lb/>can run on conventional lines (provided the lines are electrified), over 200 stations in <lb/>France are now served by TGVs. This can be seen from Map 1. TGVs run on an LGV for <lb/>part of their journey and on conventional line for the remaining, often long, section. <lb/>Thus, it is possible to travel from Marseille to Rennes, or from Marseille to Strasbourg, <lb/>and even to Frankfurt in Germany, without changing TGV. Traffic is only moderate on <lb/>these links compared to the Paris-Lyon route, but this helps to expand the TGV offer and <lb/>make it more accessible for customers. <lb/>3 <lb/>The author of this paper was one of the four experts. <lb/></body>

Due to this characteristic, <lb/>the technical progress offered by the TGV is entirely compatible with the former rail <lb/>infrastructure. Thus, investment in an LGV does not diminish the existing railway <lb/>heritage. Rather, it gives it a second lease of life, as demonstrated by the renovation of <lb/>stations and their pivotal role in cities such as Lyon, Lille, Strasbourg, Rennes, <lb/>Nantes, etc. <lb/>253 stations in <lb/>all, including 53 <lb/>abroad <lb/></body>

			<body>7 <lb/>There are therefore political reasons for the success of the TGV in France. For local <lb/>politicians, the arrival of the TGV has often been the springboard for launching extensive <lb/>city centre regeneration. There has often been extensive regional political lobbying for a <lb/>TGV service and the construction of new LGV lines meeting the Paris-Lyon standard, in <lb/>other words lines capable of carrying trains travelling at 320 km/h, or today even up to <lb/>350 km/h. In many peripheral French regions, politicians from different towns and with <lb/>differing political allegiances have come together to lobby for LGVs. This has led <lb/>government to subsidise the construction of commercially unprofitable lines. <lb/>(b) The commercial bases for success <lb/>In terms of viability, it is essential to distinguish between railway infrastructure and the <lb/>operation of trains. <lb/> In terms of infrastructure, there is virtually no viable line, with the possible <lb/>exception of the Paris-Lyon link. It is not possible to obtain precise information on <lb/>this point because the early years of LGV development marked a time when SNCF <lb/>was an integrated rail operator (that is, it managed the infrastructure and <lb/>operated the trains). During that period, the financing of new LGV lines was <lb/>achieved by increasing the debt of SNCF. That debt amounted to 180 billion <lb/>francs in 1997 (around EUR 27 billion), at the time when RFF (the infrastructure <lb/>manager, GI) was separated from SNCF (the rail operator). Two-thirds of that <lb/>debt was transferred to RFF. This corresponded to debt accumulating from <lb/>infrastructure investment, maintenance and renewal, including for high speed <lb/>lines. <lb/> Following the creation of RFF (Réseau Ferré de France), it is now possible to <lb/>pinpoint public infrastructure subsidies because they appear in the LGV financing <lb/>system. Thus, for the LGV Est line, which opened in 2007, the rail tolls levied by <lb/>RFF cover less than 40% of the full cost of the infrastructure (including financial <lb/>costs). The LGV has therefore been financed to the tune of 60% by subsidies <lb/>from central government, territorial authorities and, to a much lesser extent, <lb/>Luxembourg and the European Union. All the high speed lines currently under <lb/>construction or planned are in the same situation. They require a 50%-90% <lb/>injection of public funding in order to compensate for the fact that it is impossible <lb/>to finance these lines solely from rail tolls. Even though the tolls are regarded as <lb/>high in France (see Figure 2), they nonetheless represent a degree of <lb/>undercharging which enables the operator to offer tickets which are somewhat <lb/>cheaper, for the same service, than in other European countries because French <lb/>load factors are higher. <lb/></body>

Rail infrastructure use charges in Europe <lb/>Note: For each country, the two columns to the left indicate high speed train charges (IC PH and IC OP). <lb/>Source : Vidaud M. &amp; de Tilière G., 2010. <lb/> Although the LGVs themselves are not economically viable, the same cannot be <lb/>said of the TGVs which are viable for SNCF. As mentioned above, not all sections <lb/>are economically viable. More specifically, on the majority of sections, viability is <lb/>low or negative during off-peak hours. However, that is offset by often high <lb/>viability at peak times when trains are more frequent. This contrast between off-<lb/>peak and peak periods has been tackled globally by SNCF in order to turn the <lb/>constraint into a source of dynamism. <lb/>From the outset, SNCF has applied an effective and constantly updated yield <lb/>management principle. Ticket prices are geared not just to second-or first-class <lb/>travel and the distance travelled. They also vary depending on the destination <lb/>and the day and time of travel. By establishing a mandatory reservation system <lb/>for all TGV services, SNCF has gained a very accurate, real-time insight into the <lb/>demand for each destination and each train. The development of Internet <lb/>booking has reinforced this information. Today, when ticket sales start, three <lb/>months before a train is due to depart, the price may be relatively low (EUR 25 <lb/>for a second-class ticket between Paris and Lyon). The nearer the departure date <lb/>becomes, the more the price goes up (to as much as EUR 80 on peak days). <lb/>As a result, average train occupancy rates for TGVs are relatively high (nearly 70%), <lb/>and the capacity of TGV coach sets has gradually been increased from 350 to 400 <lb/>and then to 400 seats in eight coaches. This has been made possible by the <lb/>development of double-deck coaches. By eliminating the buffet car and by installing <lb/>second-class seats only, it is actually possible to have 600 seats per coach set. Since <lb/>trains can have two sets, it is not uncommon, at peak times, to see 1 000 people <lb/></body>

			<body>9 <lb/>getting off a single train. Then it is the stations which are at saturation point and in <lb/>need of enlargement works. <lb/>The TGV has thus become a core element of the French passenger mobility scene. In <lb/>2012, the TGV network carried 54 billion passenger-kilometres, more than four times <lb/>the number recorded for domestic air transport. Over the past 10 years, TGV traffic <lb/>has grown by 3.2% per year, whereas the figure for all passenger traffic has risen by <lb/>only 0.5% per year. This success can be explained, first, by speed gains. In terms of <lb/>its modal share of long-distance mobility, the TGV has earned a place in the sun, <lb/>between vehicle and air transport, because of its special characteristics. The average <lb/>door-to-door rail speed is hugely faster than road and often equal to or faster than <lb/>air. (P. Tzieropoulos 2010). <lb/>– Many TGVs terminate in old stations, at the heart of metropolitan areas where <lb/>employment and population is often densest. This is one of the reasons that <lb/>led businessmen to back the TGV. <lb/>– In addition, the TGV offers passengers a much higher degree of comfort and <lb/>enables them to make much better use of their time than the two competing <lb/>modes of transport, especially since security checks have increased the time <lb/>and annoyance involved in boarding aircraft. <lb/>– Frequency is often a decisive factor in favour of TGV travel. Between Paris and <lb/>Lyon, but also between Paris and Nantes, Rennes, Marseille, Lille and <lb/>Strasbourg, there are often more than 20 return journeys per day. This means <lb/>one train per hour during off-peak periods and one every half hour at peak <lb/>times. As it is easy to change a reservation, even on the platform, users have <lb/>greater flexibility in terms of managing their use of time. New information and <lb/>communication technologies and the computerisation of travel documents (e-<lb/>tickets) are improving still further the flexibility of timetable alteration <lb/>management. <lb/>(c) High-speed rail in Europe <lb/>The initial success of the TGV in France led other countries to extend their LGV network <lb/>and TGV offer. There are two different underlying logics behind this development. <lb/> The first, which can be seen on Map 2, consists of applying the &quot; Paris-Lyon <lb/>model &quot; to destinations outside French territory. This was the logic underlying the <lb/>construction of the Paris-Brussels and Paris-London links (the opening of the <lb/>Channel Tunnel dates from 1993, as does the Paris-Lille line). Following Brussels, <lb/>there are now extensions as far as Amsterdam (the new HSL Zuid line) in the <lb/>Netherlands and Cologne in Germany. Since 2007 and the opening of the LGV Est <lb/>line, it has also become possible to reach German cities such as Karlsruhe, <lb/>Stuttgart and Munich by direct TGV. It is worth noting that these lines have not <lb/>been developed as part of a competitive structure but in co-operation between <lb/>the national rail operators of France, Belgium, the United Kingdom, Germany and <lb/>the Netherlands. Thus the company Thalys, which serves Paris, Brussels, <lb/>Amsterdam and Cologne, is a subsidiary of various historic operators (SNCF, <lb/>SNCB, NS, etc.). The same applies to Eurostar, the company that serves London, <lb/>Brussels and Paris via the Channel Tunnel. <lb/> There is another form of high-speed rail development which can be seen in <lb/>Germany in particular, but also in the United Kingdom. This is shown by the <lb/></body>

These are, for the most part, old tracks which have been <lb/>upgraded to allow speeds of between 200 and 250 km/h. This is why it is <lb/>necessary to talk about high-speed rail systems in the plural. If one focuses too <lb/>closely on what has happened in France, there is a tendency to forget that LGV <lb/>does not necessarily mean a new line capable of carrying very high-speed trains <lb/>(320 or 350 km/h). The German scenario is interesting in that the TGV offer is <lb/>not linked directly to the existence of an LGV which is capable of carrying very <lb/>high-speed trains. This type of LGV does exist in Germany (red lines on the map) <lb/>but it is only part of the TGV offer (known as ICE in Germany). A large proportion <lb/>of the 23 billion passenger-kilometres registered for the German TGV system <lb/>relates to upgraded conventional lines. Unlike France, where investment in LGVs <lb/>has, for some time, gone hand in hand with delays in upgrading the classic <lb/>network, Germany has developed a more balanced and integrated approach to <lb/>the modernisation of its network. <lb/>Map 2. The high-speed rail system in Europe <lb/>Source: RFF. <lb/>When we come to examine southern Europe, we find that there is an extensive LGV <lb/>network in Italy and Spain which, to a certain extent, mirrors the &quot; Paris-Lyon model &quot; . <lb/> In Spain, the introduction of LGVs can be explained by the fact that the classic <lb/>Spanish network was not built to UIC gauge. Connecting the Spanish network to <lb/></body>

			<body>11 <lb/>the European network entailed adjusting to the UIC standard, and so Spain opted, <lb/>with the help of the European Union, to embark on the construction of an entirely <lb/>new LGV network. Like France, Spain first built lines between the capital (Madrid) <lb/>and the main conurbations such as Seville and Barcelona. However, Spanish <lb/>ambition does not stop there. Spain aims to create a whole new rail network <lb/>covering the entire territory, including links between medium-sized towns. The <lb/>Spanish LGV network is therefore the most extensive in Europe. It already <lb/>possesses 2 300 km of lines, and new LGVs are still under construction. The flip <lb/>side of this ambition is the high cost for users (tickets are relatively expensive) <lb/>and, in particular, for the regional authorities which have to subsidise the <lb/>infrastructure heavily. It is worth noting that a network which is 20% more <lb/>extensive than the French network carries only 20% of the TGV traffic that France <lb/>carries. <lb/> In Italy, the LGV network has also expanded rapidly in recent years. Today, it <lb/>links the main cities in the Italian peninsula, namely, from south to north, Naples, <lb/>Rome, Florence, Bologna and Milan. What distinguishes the Italian system is that <lb/>it opted throughout for competition between several rail operators over the same <lb/>section. This is a relatively rare case (Crozet, Nash &amp; Preston2012) of on-track <lb/>competition because competition in the rail sector is usually off-track. 4 On the <lb/>dorsal line running along the spine of Italy, traffic has increased rapidly because <lb/>TGVs offer a genuine alternative to air travel. <lb/>Relationships between the TGV and air transport are not governed by competition alone. <lb/>There is a strong complementarity between the high-speed rail system and the operation <lb/>of the major air hubs. One of the objectives of the White Paper on the Future of <lb/>Transport, published by the European Union in 2011, is to triple the length of the existing <lb/>European high-speed rail network by 2030. This ambition is linked to another objective, <lb/>that of reducing aviation greenhouse gas emissions. In this context, TGV traffic is <lb/>regarded as replacing air traffic for at least a proportion of intra-European journeys <lb/>(Adler N., Pels E. &amp; Nash C., 2010). This reasoning is based on the fact that when certain <lb/>LGVs opened, competing flights were considerably reduced, or even axed. Thus, there <lb/>are no longer any flights between Brussels and Paris (LGV Est) or between Strasbourg <lb/>and Paris (TGV Nord). Between London and Paris, Eurostar has maintained a higher <lb/>market share than air travel, and likewise between Paris and Marseille. Between Paris <lb/>and Lyon, rail traffic is ten times greater than air traffic. <lb/>The latter statistic is very revealing as regards the complementarity between high-speed <lb/>rail and air transport. There are direct trains linking Lyon (but also Lille and Strasbourg, <lb/>among others) to Charles de Gaulle Airport at Roissy, Paris. Travellers from these cities <lb/>are increasingly fed into the Air France hub by TGV. This is not an isolated case. As <lb/>Map 3 shows, several European airports have a high-speed rail terminal which provides <lb/>good intermodality between air and rail. This has even become a strategy of the major <lb/>air hubs such as Frankfurt (Germany) and Schiphol (Netherlands). Other airports intend <lb/>to develop such facilities, not just to link the airport to the city centre but with a view to <lb/>middle-and long-distance TGV links, as shown below. To a certain extent, therefore, <lb/>high-speed trains increase the attractiveness of air transport. Whereas there is <lb/>substitutability between high-speed rail and air traffic at domestic level, there is <lb/>complementarity in regard to international and, in particular, intercontinental flights. <lb/></body>

			<body>13 <lb/>(2) The TGV in France: the product of an environment and ex-ante <lb/>assessments <lb/>It is no accident that France was the first European country to develop the high-speed <lb/>train. In the early 1970s, there was a conducive institutional but also historical and <lb/>geographical environment. Against that background, ex ante socio-economic <lb/>assessments played a key role. <lb/>(a) Institutional and socio-technical background <lb/>Rail transport played a leading role in France, as in other European countries, at the <lb/>beginning of the 20th century. However, increased carriage of goods and passengers by <lb/>road later caused a secular drop in the market share of rail transport. To the extent that, <lb/>by the 1950s, rail seemed to be an out-dated mode of transport. The French rail network <lb/>gradually shrank from 40 000 km in 1900 to 30 000 km (its current size) in just a few <lb/>decades. In the 1960s, the mass transport mode of the future appeared to be the <lb/>aeroplane, but there was also a new technology being developed to the south of Paris by <lb/>an engineer by the name of Bertin: the aerotrain. This vehicle, which rested on an air <lb/>cushion, was propeller-driven. It ran on a concrete track and was capable of speeds <lb/>approaching 200 km/h. It was regarded by its promoters as the future, replacing the <lb/>fastest lines. <lb/>In the face of this innovation and with the backing of the public authorities, rail engineers <lb/>developed a competing product. Taking their inspiration from the progress achieved in <lb/>Japan with the Shinkansen, they embarked, both within SNCF and in undertakings such <lb/>as Alstom, on research aimed at outdoing the very high speeds so far achieved. These <lb/>engineers had to improve the power of electric traction units, aerodynamics and train <lb/>stability, the quality of rails, wheels and bogeys, breaking techniques, the ability of the <lb/>pantographs to receive high-speed energy and the resistance of the catenaries to high <lb/>speeds, etc. That research gave rise to new technologies and new patents which gave the <lb/>French industry a significant technological edge. High-speed rail does not fall out of the <lb/>sky; it results from a close connection between the railway industry, transport research <lb/>and entrepreneurial flair. In the majority of countries that have developed high-speed rail <lb/>systems (Spain, Italy, Korea, Germany, etc.), there has been that close link between <lb/>industry, research and rail operators. <lb/>In France, SNCF has obviously played a pivotal role, and its engineers were at the heart <lb/>of the collective learning process which led to the emergence of high-speed rail. The <lb/>latter came about in a context of integrated and monopolistic rail entrepreneurship. Many <lb/>people in France are still very much wedded to that view. Any country today wanting to <lb/>embark on a high-speed rail system should therefore ponder the socio-technological <lb/>context in which that decision is going to operate. Will technology be mostly imported? <lb/>Will implementation take place in a competitive environment or be based on competition <lb/>between operators? Will there be vertical integration or de-integration? <lb/>Another important element of this context is the political and institutional dimension. In <lb/>1975, France enjoyed stable political power and a central government with wide-ranging <lb/>powers compared to the territorial authorities, which were largely dependent on decisions <lb/>taken in Paris. Moreover, French law was not subject to &quot; common law &quot; , which ascribes <lb/>considerable powers to judges and courts, but was governed by a Napoleonic tradition <lb/>inherited from Roman law whereby power lies with the legislative and executive <lb/>authorities. In terms of LGVs, as well as motorways and airports, that means that there <lb/>is a &quot; declaration of public utility &quot; procedure under which it is perfectly legal to expropriate <lb/>from owners the land needed for the LGV. If we add a French tradition of generosity in <lb/></body>

With a population of a little over 63 million in an area of <lb/>550 000 km2, France has only 114 inhabitants per km2. This means that, outside the <lb/>major conurbations, there are vast tracts given over to agriculture and forests. Other <lb/>than at its extremities, the Paris-Lyon LGV does not cross any urban areas. This factor <lb/>reduced construction costs, as did the fact that there are no tunnels and few bridges on <lb/>that line. However, the principal geographical factor affecting the development of the <lb/>TGV in France is urbanisation. <lb/>The vast majority of French provincial conurbations are some distance from Paris but no <lb/>further than 800 km. That is the ideal distance for a TGV, in other words for customers <lb/>who wish to make the return journey on the same day. The 3-hour travel time threshold <lb/>is often presented as being the limit beyond which the relevance of high-speed rail travel <lb/>diminishes rapidly in comparison with air travel. The explanation is simple. With a travel <lb/>time of 2 or 3 hours, it is possible to make the return journey the same day and still do a <lb/>meaningful day&apos;s work at the other end. It means leaving home early and returning late, <lb/>but as long as it doesn&apos;t happen every day and the journey is comfortable, it is <lb/>acceptable. Beyond the 3-hour threshold, the aeroplane regains its relevance in relation <lb/>to the TGV (see Figure 3). <lb/>Box 2. Speed and time-saving <lb/>As shown in the works of Schafer (2009), economic growth goes hand in hand throughout the <lb/>world with increased mobility. There is kind of &quot; iron law &quot; of coupling (or positive elasticity) between <lb/>increased distance travelled and higher GDP (Crozet, 2009). However, since this increased mobility <lb/>occurs without a significant increase in travel time budgets, this means that the distance/GDP <lb/>elasticity is based on a speed/GDP elasticity. That can be explained by the fact that greater speed <lb/>provides access to new activities, which reflects the preference for variety. It is not surprising, <lb/>therefore, that mobility increases more or less in line with income because that mobility is the <lb/>enabling condition for the &quot; economics of variety &quot; (Gronau &amp; Hamermesh 2001). <lb/>Increased mobility is therefore a logical by-product of higher income. The demand for speed <lb/>reflects increasingly varied and intensive consumption. However, intensification in turn places <lb/>specific constraints on planned activities which are linked to the trend increase in the value of time. <lb/>When income increases more rapidly than the amount of time available, the scarcity of time also <lb/>increases which means that the time budget that we are prepared to devote to each activity is <lb/>potentially reduced. The key problem for individuals in the modern world is therefore the problem <lb/>of time management. <lb/>In a work which appeared in 1973, at the time when Club of Rome issues were being aired, Ivan <lb/>Illich developed the idea that there was an inverse relationship between energy consumption and <lb/>equity: as the demand for speed, and hence energy consumption, increased for the privileged <lb/>minority, so inequalities grew. His reasoning led him to the following conclusion: &quot; It is time to <lb/>recognise that, in the field of transport, there are speed thresholds which must not be exceeded. If <lb/>they are, not only will the physical environment continue to be ruined but the social fabric will <lb/>continue to be threatened by the proliferation of social divisions created in it and reinforced every <lb/>day as a result of the use of time by individuals. &quot; <lb/>Illich pinpointed a genuine problem but was making a similar error to those who, at the same time, <lb/>thought that we were under threat of poverty. As Illich said, there is a scarcity of time, but it is not <lb/>linked to the fact that it is necessary to work more in order to travel (see Annex 2 on the general <lb/>concept of speed) but, on the contrary, to the fact that, by working as much or less, one can travel <lb/></body>

			<body>15 <lb/>more. Thus it is the potential abundance of places, and hence of accessible goods and services, <lb/>that leads to a scarcity of time. A scarcity which is not absolute but related to our income. <lb/>How then should we allocate this rare resource – time – to the various activities? As Linder (1970) <lb/>predicted, we have reduced our average sleeping time and also the time spent on household <lb/>upkeep and on maintaining our possessions. We have so many possessions that we are unable to <lb/>devote much time to any of them. <lb/>Can we apply this reasoning to travel time? Because time is a scarce resource, couldn&apos;t we reduce <lb/>our mobility in order to gain time and increase the usefulness of our activities? This is the advice <lb/>given by all those who &quot; sing the praise of slowness &quot; : give time, give each activity the time to <lb/>develop and stop flitting between multiple successive activities. Even though this sounds like good <lb/>sense, we have to understand that activity is undermining the central thesis of the economy of <lb/>decreasing marginal utility. Which is no small matter, because the inverse reasoning would be <lb/>tantamount to taking the view that marginal utility increases or, at any rate, does not diminish as <lb/>the duration of an activity increases. Is that realistic when the standard of living is increasing? <lb/>What we are seeing today is not a reduction in travel times but a reduction in the average duration <lb/>of each of our activities accentuated by the increased speed of passage (whether physical or <lb/>virtual) from one activity to another. We do more things, and spend less time on each of them. <lb/>However, the time spent travelling does not decrease because maintaining it is the very pre-<lb/>condition for intensifying our programme of activities. <lb/>As shown in Figure 3 below, it is possible to compare directly the modal split between <lb/>high-speed rail and air between two cities by comparing the difference in journey time <lb/>between train and air. When the journey time is the same, train captures almost the <lb/>entire market. Once the journey time by rail exceeds the journey time by air by 1 to <lb/>2 hours, the market share drops to about 50% and decreases rapidly thereafter. <lb/>Figure 3.

			<body>Yves Crozet — Discussion Paper 2013-26 — © OECD/ITF 2013 <lb/>the two cities has decreased. However, it will be noted that there is some scattering on <lb/>both sides of the curve. Given the same difference in journey time as for Madrid-<lb/>Barcelona, the rail market share is significantly better for Paris-Marseille or Paris-London. <lb/>That means that there are other factors which militate in favour of one or other mode. It <lb/>may be a question of commercial policy, or the relative location of stations and airports, <lb/>or their links with urban transport. The average distance between the homes of travellers <lb/>and stations or airports also plays a key role. <lb/>Figure 3 also tells us that Germany is a special case. Population density is higher in <lb/>Germany than in France or Spain and cities are often medium-sized and not far distant <lb/>from one another. That has led to a high-speed rail model which is noticeably different <lb/>from the &quot; Paris-Lyon &quot; model. <lb/> France opted to build new lines, completely separate from the conventional <lb/>network, over long distances. This is a door-to-door logic between major centres <lb/>of population. When the TGV passes close to a medium-sized city, it avoids it. <lb/>Where necessary, a special station is built outside the town to provide access to <lb/>the high-speed system. There are many of these purpose-built out-of-town <lb/>stations in France (Le Creusot and Macon-Loché on the Paris-Lyon line; Valence, <lb/>Avignon and Aix on the Méditerranée line, Besançon, Belfort-Montbéliard on the <lb/>Rhin-Rhône line, etc.). To bring the LGV into the traditional station in a medium-<lb/>sized city would have increased the journey time between Paris and the <lb/>conurbation served, and the number of potential passengers in a medium-sized <lb/>city would be modest. The daily frequency of TGVs is closely linked to the size of <lb/>the conurbation. If there are fewer than 100 000 inhabitants, there are no more <lb/>than three trains a day in each direction. That can rise to five where there are <lb/>200 000 inhabitants. Only in excess of that number will there be ten or more <lb/>trains per day in each direction. <lb/> Germany, which has a totally different urban geography, made a different choice. <lb/>High-speed trains always run from traditional stations in the heart of cities. Since <lb/>those cities are not very far from one another, a maximum speed of 200 to <lb/>250 km/h is sufficient. Even though Germany has built a few long LGV sections, <lb/>the latter are more integrated into the conventional rail system because the high-<lb/>speed train makes frequent incursions into it in order to reach stations, following a <lb/>logic that might be described as &quot; cabotage &quot; . High-speed rail is therefore used <lb/>mostly for regional journeys of short and medium distance. Reservations are not <lb/>necessary. High-speed rail is more integrated into the overall rail offer. In <lb/>Germany, high-speed rail accounts for only one-third of all rail traffic (in <lb/>passenger-kilometres) as against 60% in France. <lb/>(c) Ex ante assessments, the key role of economic calculations <lb/>The development of high-speed rail in France also owes much to economic calculations <lb/>(de Rus G. and Nash C. 2007 &amp; 2009). Whilst French engineers have been able to <lb/>respond to the challenges of high speed, French economists 5 have managed to apply to <lb/>the TGV the work done by their predecessors on consumer surplus and its contribution to <lb/>the general interest. Consumer surplus is a key variable which is not taken on board by <lb/>national accounts.

			<body>17 <lb/>fail to take account of the utility that a customer derives from a given good or service. <lb/>Economic calculation seeks to remedy this shortcoming. It does so by applying a <lb/>rationale which takes account of the fact that the cost of transport is made up of two key <lb/>variables, the monetary cost and the journey time cost, which are a function of the <lb/>journey time and the value of time. <lb/>Because high-speed rail can reduce journey time, it may, if ticket prices do not rise <lb/>excessively, lead to a lower generalised transport cost. This represents an increased <lb/>surplus for users who used another mode of transport before the high-speed rail service <lb/>was introduced as well as an increased surplus for new users. <lb/>To illustrate this key role played by speed gains, here is the rationale that has allowed <lb/>France to make high-speed rail projects an economically credible proposition. It is a <lb/>question of calculating the traffic on the new line based on the modal split between rail <lb/>and air. This model combines a gravity model with a price-time model. <lb/> The gravity model states that the volume of traffic between two zones i and j <lb/>depends on the population in each of those zones, weighted by the generalised <lb/>cost of travel between i and j. Thus the volume of traffic can be expressed as <lb/>follows: <lb/>where: <lb/>P i and P j : respective population of the two geographical zones i and j, <lb/>Cg ij : generalised cost of the transport in question between zones i and j, <lb/>γ : elasticity of traffic to the generalised cost, <lb/>K : adjustment parameter. <lb/>The numerator contains the factors of attraction and the denominator the factors of <lb/>repulsion or resistance. High elasticity in this instance means high sensitivity to a rise (or <lb/>fall) in generalised cost and, in particular, the reduction in travel time afforded by higher <lb/>speeds. It is therefore necessary to take into account the speeds of the various <lb/>competing modes of transport, which is what the price-time model does. <lb/> The price-time model, for given elasticities for each mode, shows how a change in <lb/>relative speeds entails a change in market shares. This model is based on the <lb/>theory that a traveller&apos;s choice between two modes is made by reference to the <lb/>value that he places on his time and the transport cost and time characteristics of <lb/>each of those modes. Thus, user k chooses the mode whose generalised cost, <lb/>taking into account the value of his time h k , is lowest. For a modal split between <lb/>rail and air, the respective prices of rail and air are P F and P A ; T F and T A are the <lb/>journey times (including final legs), and the generalised costs for user k are <lb/>expressed as follows: <lb/>Cg k A = P A + h k T A <lb/>Cg k F = P F + h k T F <lb/> <lb/>ij <lb/>g <lb/>j <lb/>i <lb/>ij <lb/>C <lb/>P <lb/>P <lb/>K <lb/>T  <lb/></body>

On that basis, it is not <lb/>unreasonable to ask users, who benefit from real time savings, to contribute to the cost <lb/>of developing the network. This requires the levying of relatively high infrastructure <lb/>charges, aimed at reducing state subsidies to RFF, the infrastructure manager.

From net present value (VAN) to internal rate of return (TRI) <lb/>The net present value (VAN) of a project compares the investment made by an operator (Ij) and <lb/>the financial costs (F j ) to income (Rj) from which operating costs (Cj) are deducted. These <lb/>predictive values for each year of the life of a project are discounted values for the reference year, <lb/>obtained by applying discounting rate a. At the end of the period, the residual present value of the <lb/>infrastructure is added. The VAN can therefore be expressed as follows: <lb/>When calculating the VAN, amounts are in current coin. The VAN is a financial indicator which can <lb/>be used to compare different projects. The higher the VAN, the higher the sums generated by the <lb/>investment. From the financial VAN, we have to deduct the financial TRI (internal rate of return). <lb/>This is determined by the value of a (discounting rate) which cancels out the VAN. It is also <lb/>possible to calculate an economic TRI by not taking financial costs into account. <lb/>On this basis, it is also possible to calculate a socio-economic VAN, also known as discounted cash <lb/>flow (BNA) for which the formula is the following: <lb/>The BNA is the other facet of the VAN, but takes into account the interest for the community. Its <lb/>calculation is subject to the proviso that it is possible to estimate in monetary terms the various <lb/>external costs and benefits (A) of a public investment. Of the monetised benefits, time savings are <lb/>particularly important. It is worth noting that financial costs which represent a transfer between <lb/>members of the community are not taken into account. The calculation is made in constant money <lb/>of the discounting reference year. As with the financial VAN, the calculation of the socio-economic <lb/>VAN is accompanied by that of a socio-economic TRI, which is the value of the discounting <lb/>coefficient which cancels out the discounted cash flow <lb/>Table 1 provides a comparison, for the various LGVs, ordered by date of construction, <lb/>between the predictive economic TRI and the ex post result. It appears that ex post <lb/>economic viability is lower than predicted. However, with the exception of TGV Nord, the <lb/>differences are not great, and the economic viability achieved made it possible to cover <lb/>financial costs because the interest rates applied were lower than the economic TRI. It <lb/>will be noted that the return diminishes for the Rhône-Alpes and Méditerranée high-<lb/>speed lines to the point where it only just covers financial costs. <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/>r <lb/>n <lb/>r <lb/>p <lb/>r <lb/>n <lb/>n <lb/>t <lb/>t <lb/>j <lb/>t <lb/>t <lb/>j <lb/>t <lb/>t <lb/>t <lb/>j <lb/>j <lb/>j <lb/>j <lb/>j <lb/>a <lb/>K <lb/>a <lb/>F <lb/>C <lb/>R <lb/>I <lb/>VAN <lb/>) <lb/>1 <lb/>( <lb/>) <lb/>1 <lb/>( <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/>r <lb/>n <lb/>r <lb/>p <lb/>r <lb/>n <lb/>n <lb/>t <lb/>t <lb/>j <lb/>t <lb/>t <lb/>j <lb/>t <lb/>t <lb/>t <lb/>j <lb/>j <lb/>j <lb/>j <lb/>j <lb/>a <lb/>K <lb/>a <lb/>A <lb/>C <lb/>R <lb/>I <lb/>BNA <lb/>) <lb/>1 <lb/>( <lb/>) <lb/>1 <lb/>( <lb/></body>

			<body>23 <lb/>particular, has taken a very long time to pick up. Today, 20 years after the opening of <lb/>the Channel Tunnel, returns are achieving levels which are finally enabling Eurostar to <lb/>become a profit-making company. However, the journey has been a long one, and it has <lb/>been necessary to wait for the new line to be opened on the British side and also for <lb/>access to St Pancras Station. Ex post assessments after the first 25 years of TGV <lb/>operation in France have shown that the net increase in the collective surplus was <lb/>EUR 45.9 billion for line 1 (south-east), EUR 23.8 billion for the Atlantic line (south-west) <lb/>and EUR 4.9 billion for the northern line. In other words, a total of EUR 74.6 billion in <lb/>terms of constant 2005 money, earned to a very large extent as a result of time savings <lb/>for passengers. <lb/>(b) The key question of rail tolls <lb/>The extension of the LGV network in France made relatively little call on central funding <lb/>up until 2009. The extension was made possible through an ambitious policy of rail tolls <lb/>when SNCF separated from RFF. Just as SNCF has practised yield management at peak <lb/>times, so RFF has gradually raised the level of infrastructure charges, which operate a <lb/>space-time modulation taking into account the ability of the various TGVs to pay. <lb/>As Sanchez-Boras et al. pointed out (2010), there are several ways of determining the <lb/>level of rail tolls. As against the traditional method of marginal cost (CM), there is the full <lb/>cost method. The latter has been the aim of RFF in France between 1997 and 2013. For <lb/>LGVs, the infrastructure operator has to set tolls at a level which enables it to cover the <lb/>full cost of the line, less any public subsidies. In order to do so, RFF has applied a mark-<lb/>up method. Thus, RFF identifies a marginal cost to which it applies, by way of a binomial <lb/>tariff, a supplement which depends on the elasticity of demand, on the one hand (Oum &amp; <lb/>Tretheway 1988, Nilsson 1992)., and on the opportunity cost of public funds, on the <lb/>other. (See Annex 1 for a detailed presentation of &quot; Ramsey-Boiteux &quot; pricing.) <lb/>In the first place, RFF calculates, for a given rail line, the total revenue needed to cover <lb/>its investments. On that basis, it then calculates the tariff modulations which can be <lb/>applied by varying the tolls in time. Between peak and off-peak periods, elasticity of <lb/>demand is not uniform and it is possible to charge widely varying tolls. Logically, a study <lb/>of this policy throws up situations where demand is sufficiently sustained, and inelastic, <lb/>to allow the tolls charged to bring in more revenue than was originally aimed for. In that <lb/>case, a general equalisation is applied between the LGVs, and to a certain extent over <lb/>the rest of the network. An alternative choice could have been made. Profitable lines <lb/>could provide dividends for the owner of SNCF, the State (SNCF pays taxes on profits), <lb/>leaving the state to subsidise un-profitable lines. But the authorities preferred internal <lb/>balancing of accounts (péréquation). <lb/>It would appear that the principal objective of the State, which controls RFF, is to limit <lb/>public subsidies. This constraint is especially strong in that, despite a deep public finance <lb/>crisis, one which is common to most of Europe, there is a strong political will to develop <lb/>the network of high-speed lines (LGV). As a result, on the Paris-Lyon line, the busiest <lb/>section, tolls represent up to six times the marginal cost. Paradoxically, that is also the <lb/>most profitable line of SNCF, despite the high tolls (Crozet &amp; Chassagne 2013). On the <lb/>other hand, on less busy lines, the toll may be only equal to or double the marginal cost. <lb/>We see here another function of tolls, which is to send out a signal to users. Rail <lb/>companies need to take into account the fact that, in the busiest areas, rail corridors are <lb/>a rare resource which needs to be put to the best possible use. Tolls therefore act as a <lb/>productivity incentive. Where the pressure of demand is greatest, it is sensible for tolls to <lb/>rise because it is a way of regulating demand and adjusting the offer. Thus in 2008, <lb/></body>

For the moment, this <lb/>is affecting only international journeys. However, it is no secret that the long-term trend <lb/>is to open up all traffic to competition. Is this going to alter the deal for TGVs <lb/>significantly? This is by no means certain if we are to believe recent papers by J. Preston <lb/>(2009) and C. Nash (2009) who point out that, the higher the tolls, the less likely it is <lb/>that there will be competitors on an LGV line. To a certain extent, high tolls would protect <lb/>SNCF. If an undertaking has to pay tolls which represent between 30% and 40% of its <lb/>turnover, potential competitors know that this reduces the probability of their obtaining a <lb/>profit margin. <lb/>SNCF also points out that tolls have now reached a level which threatens the long-term <lb/>profitability of the TGV, especially since traffic, on a constant network, is increasing very <lb/>little. This is the logical outcome of the coupling between mobility and GDP. At the end of <lb/>2013, France&apos;s GDP has not regained its 2008 level. <lb/>Figure 8.

This scissor effect is indicative of <lb/>a dual phenomenon. <lb/> The increase in tolls is indicative of the State&apos;s intention to reduce subsidies to <lb/>SNCF and hence to require the TGV to act as a sort of cash cow for the rail <lb/>system. Annex 1 shows that this is not possible because the level of tolls cannot <lb/>rise above a certain threshold (Crozet 2010). <lb/> The stabilisation of traffic reminds us that the LGV network is reaching its optimal <lb/>size in France, especially since four lines are still under construction. <lb/></body>

			<body>(c) How far is not too far when extending the network? <lb/>Between now and 2017, the French LGV network is due to be extended considerably. At <lb/>the beginning of this decade, under pressure from local authorities and with the aim of <lb/>supporting the economic activity of French undertakings (construction and civil <lb/>engineering, rail construction, SNCF, etc.), the Government instructed RFF to launch new <lb/>LGV lines or new LGV sections. Table 3 summarises the principal characteristics of these <lb/>projects. <lb/>Table 3: Principal characteristics of the four lines under construction <lb/>EAST <lb/>BPL <lb/>CNM <lb/>SEA <lb/>Total <lb/>Total cost (million euros) <lb/>2 000 <lb/>3 300 <lb/>1 800 <lb/>7 800 <lb/>14 900 <lb/>Length (km) <lb/>106 <lb/>182 <lb/>80 <lb/>303 <lb/>671 <lb/>Cost/km (million euros) <lb/>18.9 <lb/>18.1 <lb/>22.5 <lb/>25.7 <lb/>22.2 <lb/>Paid by RFF (million euros) <lb/>520 <lb/>1 400 <lb/>0 <lb/>1 000 <lb/>2 920 <lb/>Paid by central gvnmt (million) <lb/>680 <lb/>950 <lb/>1 200 <lb/>1 500 <lb/>4 330 <lb/>Paid by local gvnmt (million) <lb/>640 <lb/>950 <lb/>600 <lb/>1 500 <lb/>3 690 <lb/>Paid by EU + Luxembourg <lb/>160 <lb/>0 <lb/>0 <lb/>0 <lb/>160 <lb/>Source: RFF. <lb/>The aim of the projects is to extend the network in order to reduce journey time to <lb/>Strasbourg (LGV Est), Bordeaux (Sud Europe Atlantique, SEA) and Brittany (Bretagne <lb/>Pays de Loire, BPL). The Nîmes-Montpellier bypass (CNM) does not save time in its <lb/>current configuration. It aims to resolve a capacity problem so that it will be possible, at <lb/>a later date, to connect with the Spanish network because the new tunnel between <lb/>France and Spain is already operational and there is an existing LGV line from the border <lb/>to Barcelona and beyond. <lb/>On reading the table, the extent of the financial constraints becomes apparent. The <lb/>additional 671 km of LGV cost nearly EUR 15 billion (EUR 22 million per km). This is a <lb/>sum that cannot be covered by rail tolls alone because increased traffic levels will not be <lb/>very significant. It was therefore necessary to provide an injection of public funds. <lb/>However, because central government could not, by itself, cover total subsidies of a little <lb/>over EUR 7 billion, the regional authorities were asked to come up with nearly half that <lb/>amount. The private sector was also involved: <lb/> Either in the form of a concession for the SEA. The company LISEA (a subsidiary <lb/>of Vinci) is to construct and operate LGV SEA for 50 years and to fund this by <lb/>means of tolls. However, even in the best-case scenario, these will cover less than <lb/>half the total cost, hence the need for public financing. <lb/> Or in the form of public-private partnership (PPP) contracts. In the case of the <lb/>Brittany-Loire Valley (BPL) line, it is the company Eiffage which is to construct and <lb/>maintain the line for 30 years in exchange for rent paid partly by the State and <lb/>partly by RFF. The same logic was applied to the CNM where the line is being <lb/>constructed and maintained by the Bouygues consortium. <lb/></body>

			<body>Yves Crozet — Discussion Paper 2013-26 — © OECD/ITF 2013 <lb/>The outcome of this rapid expansion of the size of the LGV network is that the financial <lb/>viability of the whole project is becoming increasingly fragile. The State and the regional <lb/>authorities have committed themselves for several years to expenditure which will <lb/>inevitably limit their future financing abilities. RFF has incurred a debt of EUR 3 billion in <lb/>order to contribute towards works which may well not bring in enough money in future <lb/>tolls to cover the debt. Finally, the private sector has taken a big risk, particularly in <lb/>relation to the SEA line, because with the current sluggish economic growth it is not at all <lb/>clear that traffic forecasts will materialise once the line opens. <lb/>It is not surprising, therefore, that in 2013 the French Government declared a slowdown <lb/>if not a halt to all new LGV works. After 2017, only the Bordeaux-Toulouse line might see <lb/>the light of day. The other lines for which local politicians lobbied so forcibly pose <lb/>formidable financing problems. <lb/> Construction costs are the first problem. Each of the projects, such as Lyon-Turin, <lb/>Marseille-Nice or Paris-Lyon via Clermont-Ferrand, incurs costs in excess of <lb/>EUR 15 billion if not EUR 20 billion for traffic which will not attain, sometimes by a <lb/>very large margin, the traffic on lines already open. Even taking into account the <lb/>time savings for users, the collective gain may, for the community, become a loss. <lb/> On the environmental front, we should not forget the pollution caused by the <lb/>construction of LGVs (Nilsson J.E. &amp; Pydokke R., 2009). A Bilan Carbone® <lb/>(carbon assessment) carried out by RFF on the eastern section of the Rhine-Rhône <lb/>high-speed line (opened to traffic at the end of 2011) showed that it would take <lb/>12 years of traffic to offset, through the lower CO 2 emissions associated with the <lb/>TGV, the emissions caused by the construction works. As an indication, 100 m 3 of <lb/>earth have to be moved for each metre of new line. To that, we have to add <lb/>emissions caused by the production and transport of concrete, steel, etc. <lb/>Furthermore, TGV unit emissions have been revised upwards, in particular to take <lb/>account of the fuel mix which supplies them with electricity. <lb/>Another difficulty arises with projected lines serving heavily urbanised areas. For LGV <lb/>projects from Paris towards Orleans or Rouen and for the Marseille-Nice project, there is <lb/>a great temptation to opt for a regional TGV, somewhat closer to the German model. This <lb/>would come at the risk of increasing the number of stations and hence journey time even <lb/>though the distances are not great. In addition to the cost of the infrastructure, there are <lb/>questions regarding optimal level of services and potential demand. In order to attract <lb/>passengers, will it be necessary to subsidise operation as well as infrastructure, as in the <lb/>case of regional trains? The risk here would be to provide everyday high-speed hyper-<lb/>mobility at an exorbitant financial cost (see Annex 2 on effective speed for social <lb/>purposes). <lb/>There are question marks surrounding the relevance of LGVs that aim to substitute rail <lb/>traffic for air traffic. Taking the development of the European high-speed network alone <lb/>as a basis (see Map 2), it will be possible in a few years&apos; time to travel by TGV from <lb/>London to Madrid, from Brussels to Barcelona or from Amsterdam to Geneva, etc. <lb/>However, such journeys fall outside the TGV zone of relevance because, even at high <lb/>speed, they exceed the 5 or 6 hours parameter, in some cases by a considerable margin. <lb/>In such cases, air travel remains entirely relevant, especially with the emergence of low <lb/>cost airlines which are now offering prices for those destinations that rail cannot match. <lb/>The origin-destination pairings for which the TGV is a genuine substitute for air travel <lb/>have been amply covered already in France, if we take into account operational LGVs and <lb/>those projects that are now at an advanced stage. Increasing constraints on air transport <lb/></body>

			<body>27 <lb/>might affect the rail-air split slightly. However, this effect will be limited, especially since <lb/>the boarding of TGVs may well become subject to security checks. <lb/>It is therefore perfectly legitimate to raise questions about the optimal size of the high-<lb/>speed network, both in France and in other European countries. This does not mean that <lb/>we have to bring everything to a halt and give up in despair, but rather than we should <lb/>entertain some doubts. How far is not too far? That is a question which applies to the <lb/>extension of the LGV network but also to other variables such as the level of tolls and the <lb/>type and extent of competition. <lb/>CONCLUSION <lb/>In the European rail landscape, France enjoys a privileged position. It made the choice to <lb/>build a vast LGV network. That choice resulted in greatly increased traffic, and the lines <lb/>under construction are pursuing the same objective. However, it that does not prevent us <lb/>questioning the content of those choices for the coming decades. It is necessary to take <lb/>stock so that developers can gear their projects to local needs and financial constraints. <lb/>The French dream must not turn into a nightmare through the proliferation of structurally <lb/>loss-making lines, following the Spanish &quot; model &quot; . <lb/>The French &quot; model &quot; , like the German &quot; model &quot; , teaches us a basic lesson: it is geography <lb/>not economics that is the crucial factor. The key element for a high-speed line is optimal <lb/>distance (between 400 and 1 000 km), sufficiently large centres of population to justify <lb/>15 to 20 return journeys per day and a customer base with the means to pay. The <lb/>success of the TGV in France is largely dependent on the fact that our geography makes <lb/>links such as Paris-Lyon, Paris-Nantes or Rennes, Paris-Marseille, etc. viable, even at the <lb/>cost of public funding for the construction stage. <lb/>We should not base this model on services which relate to everyday mobility. The TGV is <lb/>not there for the purpose of proliferating dormitory towns 100 or 150 km from Paris, <lb/>Lyon, Marseille or Bordeaux. Demand linked to everyday mobility must be satisfied by <lb/>everyday trains whose main feature is frequency. Rather than pursuing an obsession with <lb/>speed (see Annex 2), choices should be guided by considerations as to the type of <lb/>service that users require. Where two cities are 100 or 150 km apart, the appropriate <lb/>reaction is not to announce that high-speed rail will enable the journey to be completed <lb/>in 30 or 40 minutes. What matters is the number of users and the frequency of trains <lb/>that will allow the journey to be made in just over an hour. Basically, this can be done by <lb/>improving the existing network (renovation, signalling, command-and-control measures) <lb/>sometimes by replacing materials and not really by investing in rail hubs, stations and <lb/>other saturated zones. High speed has its place, but it should not be the default option. <lb/>There are a number of other ways of improving the rail offer. Before deciding which <lb/>option is best, we should take the time to study each situation on its own merits. <lb/></body>

			<body>31 <lb/>C: Marginal cost with two components, <lb/>Ci = infrastructure cost <lb/>Cs = Train service cost <lb/>If we combine C = Ci + CS with the equation (1), we obtain P = a + Cs and equation (2) <lb/>becomes <lb/>(a – Ci)/ (a + Cs) =  / (3) <lb/>so <lb/>a = (Ci +  / *Cs) / (1 - /)(4) <lb/>Therefore, it is interesting to observe the variations of the mark-up &quot; a &quot; in relation <lb/>with the various values of , , Ci and CS. Table 1 below summarises the result by taking <lb/>into account the official value of opportunity cost of public funds in France ( = 0,3) <lb/>which leads to  = 0.23. Columns of Table 3 combine various level of elasticity  with this <lb/>fixed value of . The lines show different combinations of Ci and Cs. We give the value of <lb/>100 to Ci, and then we suppose that Ci can be higher, equal or lower than Cs. The <lb/>impacts are very clear: the higher the elasticity and Ci/Cs ratio, the lower the value of <lb/> &quot; a &quot; . On the contrary, when elasticity and ratio Ci/Cs decline, &quot; a &quot; increases. The mark-up <lb/>is even equal to ten times Ci, but only if elasticity is very weak (0.3). <lb/>Table A: value of the mark-up &quot; a &quot; for Ci = 100 <lb/> = 0.23 <lb/> = 0.23 <lb/> = 0.23 <lb/> = 0.23 <lb/> = 0.23 <lb/> = 0.3 <lb/> = 0.5 <lb/> = 0.8 <lb/> = 1.3 <lb/> = 2 <lb/>/ = 0.76 <lb/>/ = 0.46 <lb/>/ = 0.28 <lb/>/ = 0.176 <lb/>/ = 0.115 <lb/>Ci/Cs = 1.5 <lb/>a = 625 <lb/>a = 241 <lb/>a = 164 <lb/>a = 135 <lb/>a = 121 <lb/>Ci/Cs= 1 <lb/>a = 733 <lb/>a = 270 <lb/>a = 177 <lb/>a = 142 <lb/>a = 126 <lb/>Ci/Cs = 0.5 <lb/>a = 1,050 <lb/>a = 355 <lb/>a = 216 <lb/>a = 164 <lb/>a = 138 <lb/>The actual pricing scheme of RFF is already close to the optimal situation. For Paris-Lyon, <lb/>the mark-up is close to 6, but for the other parts of the network, with a lower level of <lb/>traffic, and probably a higher elasticity, the implicit mark-up is close to 2 or 1.5. Finally <lb/>the total revenue of infrastructure charges for HST is not far from an optimal situation. <lb/>HSTs are not a &quot; cash cow &quot; . The present infrastructure charges are close to the optimal <lb/>pricing scheme. It would be efficient neither to reduce them nor to increase them <lb/>sharply. <lb/></body>

			<body>Yves Crozet — Discussion Paper 2013-26 — © OECD/ITF 2013 <lb/>ANNEX 2: EFFECTIVE SPEED AND EFFECTIVE SPEED FOR SOCIETY, ANOTHER <lb/>INDICATOR FOR DETERMINING THE CRITICAL ZONE FOR A TGV <lb/>The concept of effective speed (I. Illich, J. P. Dupuy) demands that, in order to know the <lb/>actual speed of a journey, it is necessary to take into account not only the journey time <lb/>but also the time spent working in order to obtain the money to fund the financial cost of <lb/>the journey. It is necessary to distinguish between three related concepts: <lb/> generalised cost, a concept developed in the 1960s by economists. Generalised <lb/>cost expresses in monetary terms the total cost of a journey (monetary cost plus <lb/>cost of time); <lb/> generalised time, indicates in hours or minutes the total time needed for the <lb/>journey, in other words the journey time itself plus the working time required in <lb/>order to obtain the necessary money; <lb/> effective speed (Tranter 2004), a concept which relates the distance of a <lb/>journey to the total time taken to make the journey and to obtain the necessary <lb/>money. <lb/>Let us focus on effective speed (Vg – vitesse généralisée) which can be defined as <lb/>follows: <lb/>Vg = 1/[(1/V) + (k/w)] <lb/>We find, first, that because we are dealing with speed we have a harmonic mean <lb/>involving both the physical journey speed (V) and the purchasing power of the hourly <lb/>wage (w) in terms of kilometres (k = cost per kilometre). On that basis, it will be realised <lb/>that effective speed cannot increase indefinitely). As V approaches infinity, effective <lb/>speed evolves in the k/w ratio. In order to increase effective speed, it is therefore <lb/>necessary either to reduce k or to increase w. Symmetrically, even with a very high V <lb/>value, effective speed can decrease if the cost per kilometre increases faster than the <lb/>hourly wage. <lb/>As I. Illich (1973) pointed out, it is true that, in some cases and for certain journeys, <lb/>effective speed decreases for the majority. This is what brought to a probably final close <lb/>the era of supersonic commercial aviation. In 2000, a Paris-New York return on Concorde <lb/>(average speed 2 000 km/h) cost around EUR 12 000 for 12 000 kilometres, in other <lb/>words EUR 1 per kilometre, which is expensive but not exorbitant. However, in terms of <lb/>effective speed, for a worker earning around EUR 6 net per hour, that calculation gives a <lb/>speed of about 6 km/h, not much faster than walking speed. <lb/>By contrast, at the same time for the same worker, the effective speed of a subsonic <lb/>flight to New York (average speed 800 km/h) which cost EUR 600 return (EUR 0.05 per <lb/>kilometre) was just over 100 km/h – a much faster speed than walking or cycling. This <lb/>situation is not the one that Illich sought to demonstrate, but it is one that explains the <lb/>success of air transport and its popularisation, even in this time of crisis. <lb/>Thus, by applying a strict definition of effective speed, we find that the concept has <lb/>evaded the aims of its creators. There are situations where even a person earning the <lb/>minimum wage can significantly increase the effective speed of some of his journeys. <lb/>Contrary to Illich&apos;s hypothesis, the evolution of the automobile, and also that of the TGV <lb/>and aeroplane, have allowed as many people as possible significantly to increase the <lb/>effective speed of their journeys. <lb/></body>

			<body>33 <lb/>Viewed from this angle, it is not surprising that demand from the community is strong, <lb/>yesterday for motorways, today for TGVs. The problem is that this demand entails <lb/>increasing costs for the community. Let us return to a quotation from I. Illich, &quot; Beyond a <lb/>critical (speed) threshold, the output of the industrial complex established to move <lb/>people costs a society more time than it saves. &quot; The concept of effective speed for <lb/>society enables us to take into account that collective dimension rather than just the <lb/>individual dimension of the cost of what he describes as the industrial complex. In order <lb/>to do this, we simply need to replace the value k in the definition of effective speed by a <lb/>value Ks which no longer represents the cost per kilometre for an individual but the cost <lb/>per kilometre for society. In this way, we get an indicator of &quot; effective speed for society &quot; <lb/>(Vgs) which can be expressed as follows: <lb/>Vgs = 1/[(1/V) + (Ks/w)] <lb/>By applying this formula to certain French TGV projects, we find that infrastructure costs <lb/>translate into a low effective social speed for the TGV. The value k of the cost per <lb/>kilometre of the TGV (EUR 0.15 per kilometre) is the cost borne by users. However, if it <lb/>is necessary to pay EUR 0.35 per passenger-kilometre in subsidies for infrastructure and <lb/>potential operation, the social cost per kilometre becomes EUR 0.50 per kilometre and <lb/>slightly more if we include external costs (noise, polluting emissions, etc.). In this case, <lb/>the effective speed for an individual earning an hourly wage of EUR 10 remains 50 km/h, <lb/>but the effective speed for society is only 23 km/h assuming an average hourly wage for <lb/>society as EUR 13 per hour. This value of 23 km/h should be compared with the potential <lb/>cost of a regional train or coach with the same destination. <lb/>Figure A shows the variation in the effective speed for society (SES, vertical axis) as a <lb/>function of the social cost per Km. We can see that for the same social cost per Km, the <lb/>high speed train is &quot; faster &quot; than all the other modes because of its physical speed. <lb/>However, once the social cost of high speed rail reaches 50 or 80 Euros cents a Km, <lb/>other modes including conventional rail, buses and even cars carrying only 2 people <lb/>become worth considering. <lb/>– A classic train carrying 50 passengers gives a social cost per passenger-kilometre <lb/>of EUR 0.40 6 . If its physical speed is 80 km/h, the effective speed for society, <lb/>assuming an hourly wage of EUR 13, is 23 km/h, as it would be for some high <lb/>speed rail projects that need large subsidies. The TER (regional express <lb/>transport), whilst subsidised, is therefore more economic for an identical yield, <lb/>despite a low occupancy rate. <lb/>– For a coach travelling at an average speed of 30 km/h, the social cost is around <lb/>EUR 0.10 (the direct cost for users being about EUR 0.07). Assuming an average <lb/>hourly wage of EUR 13 per hour, the effective social speed would be 24 km/h, but <lb/>36 km/h if it travels at 50 km/h. It is easy to understand why the motorway <lb/>coach offer developed, in France and also in Germany. <lb/>It is no accident that coach transport has been fully liberalised in Great Britain. Even <lb/>though it receives no subsidies, despite the external costs of road transport, the effective <lb/>social speed of coach travel is much faster than that of trains. It is on these bases, <lb/>therefore, that we should challenge the priorities of mobility policies by making a <lb/>comparison of effective social speeds. <lb/>6 <lb/>Only EUR 0.20 if there are 100 passengers and EUR 0.80 if there are only 25. For the TGV, <lb/>we have assumed a high rate of occupancy (85%), in the absence of which the effective <lb/>social speed is even lower and might fall to only 12 km/h where occupancy is 40%. <lb/>PERFORMANCE IN FRANCE: FROM APPRAISAL METHODOLOGIES TO EX-POST EVALUATION <lb/>34 <lb/>Yves Crozet — Discussion Paper 2013-26 — © OECD/ITF 2013 <lb/>0 <lb/>10 <lb/>20 <lb/>30 <lb/>40 <lb/>50 <lb/>60 <lb/>70 <lb/>0.00 <lb/>0.20 <lb/>0.40 <lb/>0.60 <lb/>0.80 <lb/>1.00 <lb/>Figure A : Social effective speed (SES) and social <lb/>cost/km <lb/>Vg TER 80km/h <lb/>Vg Autocar 30km/h <lb/>Vg VP 50Km/h <lb/>Vg VP 2 p. <lb/>Vg TGV 200km/h <lb/>SES regional train 80km/h <lb/>SES Bus 30 km/h <lb/>SES Car 50km/h <lb/>SES Car 50km/h 2 passengers <lb/>SES HS train 200km/h <lb/>International Transport Forum <lb/>2 rue André Pascal <lb/>75775 Paris Cedex 16 <lb/>itf.contact@oecd.org <lb/>www.internationaltransportforum.org </body>
