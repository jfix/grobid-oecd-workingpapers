			<body>LEARNING SUPPORT STAFF: A LITERATURE REVIEW <lb/>ABSTRACT <lb/>With learning support staff an increasing part of the school workforce that is assuming more and more <lb/>teaching related responsibilities, attention has grown as to how their skills and practices can have the <lb/>greatest impact on students. &quot; Learning support staff &quot; are defined as those school staff whose main function <lb/>is to assist the work of teachers. This paper reviews country approaches to the roles and responsibilities of <lb/>learning support staff. It discusses the different mechanisms through which learning support staff can have <lb/>an impact on teachers&apos; work and student achievement and reviews the related empirical evidence. While <lb/>the available research provides mixed evidence on the impact of learning support staff on student <lb/>achievement, it suggests that learning support staff may improve teaching and learning as long as adequate <lb/>strategies for their training, deployment and use are implemented. There are several ways through which <lb/>learning support staff may have a positive impact on student attainment. Students receive more <lb/>individualised help and attention from either the support staff or the teacher; and the learning environment <lb/>can be made more flexible possibly leading to increased engagement and inclusion of children in <lb/>classroom activities. Also, teachers receive specialist support and assistance with their administrative and <lb/>planning tasks, granting them more time for their core responsibilities. <lb/>RÉSUMÉ <lb/>Avec l&apos;importance croissante du personnel de soutien à l&apos;apprentissage dans les équipes éducatives <lb/>des établissements scolaires qui assume de plus en plus des responsabilités liées à l&apos;enseignement, plus <lb/>d&apos;attention est dirigée aux façons dont leur compétences et leur pratiques peuvent avoir le plus grand <lb/>impact sur l&apos;apprentissage des élèves. « Personnel de soutien à l&apos;apprentissage » est défini comme étant le <lb/>personnel scolaire dont la fonction principale est de soutenir le travail des enseignants. Ce papier examine <lb/>les approches des différents pays dans la définition des rôles et des responsabilités du personnel de soutien <lb/>à l&apos;apprentissage.

			<body>1. INTRODUCTION <lb/>This paper reviews the research literature on the role and impact of school staff whose main function <lb/>is to assist the work of teachers (learning support staff). Teaching staff are the most important <lb/>within-school resource input influencing student learning outcomes, and constitute the greatest proportion <lb/>of education expenditure. Hence, improving the efficiency of schooling depends to a large degree on the <lb/>ability of the school system to effectively manage teaching resources. As part of school staff, learning <lb/>support staff can have an important role in improving teaching effectiveness by supporting teachers and <lb/>providing children with additional support. <lb/>In the last two decades, there has been increasing attention by researchers and policymakers to <lb/>learning support staff and their potential contribution in driving up standards in schools. The perspective of <lb/>the paper is twofold: to analyse learning support staff as a resource in itself; and to analyse how learning <lb/>support staff affect teachers&apos; use of time and impact on student achievement. The paper describes <lb/>countries&apos; current approaches to the use of learning support staff, including the way their role and <lb/>responsibilities are defined. <lb/>The paper is structured as follows. In section 2, a definition of learning support staff is provided, and <lb/>their major roles and tasks are discussed. This also includes a discussion of the main trade-offs involved in <lb/>the use of the related school resources. Section 3 reviews the use of learning support staff across a number <lb/>of countries and analyses potential advantages and disadvantages of given approaches. Section 4 provides <lb/>an overview of the existing empirical evidence of the impact of learning support staff on student <lb/>achievement. Finally, in section 5, the main conclusions of the use of learning support staff are discussed. <lb/>EDU/WKP(2015)14 <lb/></body>

			<body>2. LEARNING SUPPORT STAFF: ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES <lb/>2.1. Definition <lb/>There are a variety of job titles associated with school staff whose main function is to assist the work <lb/>of teachers. These include &quot; learning support assistants &quot; , &quot; non-teaching assistants &quot; , &quot; classroom assistants &quot; , <lb/> &quot; learning support staff &quot; , &quot; teaching assistants &quot; , &quot; teacher aides &quot; and &quot; classroom support staff &quot; . This reflects <lb/>the diversity of training, functions, working conditions, contracts and pay associated with this group of <lb/>professionals. In many countries, these professionals have experienced an increase in their responsibilities <lb/>and tasks, from helping teachers with routine and non-teaching tasks to engage in pedagogical activities <lb/>with students (Groom, 2006). <lb/>This paper uses the term &quot; learning support staff &quot; (also referred to as simply &quot; support staff &quot; ), to <lb/>capture the real contribution that such staff make to both teaching and learning, providing support for <lb/>teachers and students, but also to the overall learning-related activities of schools. Support staff who help <lb/>the teacher in a range of teaching and non-teaching tasks and engage in the learning process through direct <lb/>interactions with students will therefore be considered. <lb/>The scope of the paper does not include the use of staff who have the exclusive function of supporting <lb/>the inclusion of students with disabilities in mainstream education (e.g. teachers for students with special <lb/>education needs). However, to the extent that some learning support staff may have, among others, a role <lb/>in supporting students with disabilities, this paper may make some references to special education needs. <lb/>2.2. The role and responsibilities of Learning Support Staff <lb/>Ambiguity exists regarding which roles and responsibilities should be carried out by teachers, and <lb/>which by learning support staff. In their literature review, Blatchford et al. (2002) identify numerous <lb/>studies that highlight difficulties in defining the boundaries between teaching and non-teaching roles. <lb/>Mortimore et al. (1992, cited in Blatchford et al., 2004) have also addressed this issue in relation to when it <lb/>is appropriate to consider support staff as &apos;substituting&apos; (i.e. developing routine tasks delegated to her/him) <lb/>or &apos;augmenting&apos; the teachers&apos; role (i.e. being involved in activities that enable the teacher to provide an <lb/>enhanced curriculum). <lb/>Recent studies identify an increasing blurring of these roles (e.g. Cajkler and Tennant, 2009; Cremin <lb/>et al., 2005). Support staff are no longer undertaking only routine and administrative tasks that enable <lb/>teachers to focus on their teaching tasks, but have a multifaceted role that engages them in instructional <lb/>activities and allows them to support all the students they interact with, even if their role is to work with <lb/>mainly one child. Moreover, they support children&apos;s inclusion and act as a link and mediator between <lb/>different stakeholders. <lb/>The needs of the students are the school leader&apos;s main concern when allocating learning support staff, <lb/>and classrooms can be organised in different ways according to such needs. In many schools, support staff <lb/>are used to support children with learning difficulties in the same class, so that these students can stay <lb/>integrated in the class rather than being separated by levels of attainment. In other schools, learning <lb/>support staff may be used to allow the teacher to spend more time with children with greater needs. <lb/>2.3. Trade-offs involved in the use of learning support staff <lb/>A frequently debated teacher policy issue is the trade-off between the average size of classes and the <lb/>average salary of teachers (assuming a given expenditure in salaries). Reduced class sizes potentially <lb/></body>

			<note place="headnote">EDU/WKP(2015)14 <lb/></note>

			<page>7 <lb/></page>

			<body>improve in-class interaction and teachers&apos; working conditions, but require a larger number of teachers to <lb/>whom lower individual salaries may have to be offered. On the other hand, larger class sizes give room for <lb/>higher teacher salaries, potentially attracting better individuals to schools, but at the potential cost of <lb/>weakening the quality of classroom interaction. The use of learning support staff as a support for those <lb/>teaching larger class sizes adds complexity to this trade-off. <lb/>Broadly speaking, further spending on schools can be used to either reduce student-teacher ratios (and <lb/>thereby employ more teachers and reduce average class size), or increase teachers&apos; average salaries, or <lb/>some combination of the two. An alternative strategy would be to focus additional spending on increasing <lb/>teachers&apos; average salaries and employing more support staff in schools. This would decrease student–adult <lb/>ratios in the classroom and thus form an alternative to reducing class sizes. This strategy would aim to both <lb/>make teaching more attractive and, through the greater use of support staff, enable teachers to focus more <lb/>on their specialist expertise. There could even be arguments for reconfiguring staffing in some schools so <lb/>that fewer teachers are employed, but they are paid substantially more and provided with much more <lb/>extensive support (OECD, 2005). <lb/>Different approaches to the use of learning support staff in the trade-off between the average size of <lb/>classes and the average salary of teachers may have different effects on educational outcomes. For <lb/>example, larger classes where teachers are paid more, have more preparation time and additional teaching <lb/>support, may be more effective than smaller classes where teachers are paid less and have no learning <lb/>support staff. <lb/>Furthermore, the use of learning support staff in this trade-off also relates to another variable: student <lb/>learning time. The amount of instruction in schools, but also the extent to which instruction time is <lb/>effectively used, determines the extent to which student learning objectives (or curriculum) can be covered. <lb/>Similar levels of curriculum coverage can be reached through different instruction time allocations. If the <lb/>use of learning support staff improves the effectiveness of instruction, policy makers can reduce the <lb/>quantity of instruction without jeopardising the curriculum coverage through an increase in the number of <lb/>learning support staff in schools. Likewise, a reduction in instruction time and increased learning support <lb/>staff may enable teachers to dedicate more time to planning, preparing instruction and assessing students. <lb/></body>

			<body>3. APPROACHES TO LEARNING SUPPORT STAFF IN OECD COUNTRIES <lb/>3.1. Use of learning support staff across OECD countries <lb/>In many countries, learning support staff have become a significant part of the education workforce. <lb/>In 2010, in the 12 OECD countries for which data are available, there were on average 7.3 teacher aides <lb/>and teaching/research assistants per 1000 students in primary, secondary and non-tertiary education <lb/>(see Figure 3.1), compared to an average of 74.5 teachers and academic staff per 1 000 students <lb/>(OECD, 2012). The United Kingdom and the United States have the highest average ratio of support staff, <lb/>with 15.5 teacher aides and teaching/research assistants per 1 000 students. These two countries have <lb/>experienced significant increases of learning support staff in recent years. The number of support staff in <lb/>schools more than doubled in the United Kingdom in ten years, from 134 000 in 1997 to 346 000 in 2009, <lb/>with teaching assistants representing 52% of this group (DfE, 2011). In the United States, the number of <lb/>support staff increased at an average rate of 48% during the 1990s (French, 2003). <lb/>Figure 3.1 Teaching staff across OECD countries (2010) <lb/>Teaching staff employed in primary, secondary and post-secondary non-tertiary education, per 1 000 students <lb/>Source: OECD (2012), Education at a Glance 2012: OECD Indicators, http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/eag-2012-en. <lb/>0 <lb/>20 <lb/>40 <lb/>60 <lb/>80 <lb/>100 <lb/>120 <lb/>United <lb/>States <lb/>United <lb/>Kingdom <lb/>Norway <lb/>Finland <lb/>Slovenia <lb/>Iceland <lb/>OECD <lb/>average <lb/>France <lb/>Chile <lb/>Italy <lb/>Czech <lb/>Republic <lb/>Slovak <lb/>Republic <lb/>Mexico <lb/>Teaching staff per 1000 <lb/>students <lb/>Teacher aides and teaching/ research assistants <lb/>Classroom teachers, academic staff &amp; other teachers <lb/></body>

			<body>Evidence from Australia, Finland, New Zealand, the United Kingdom and the United States, shows <lb/>that the growth in the use of support staff in these countries has been partly due to policies of inclusive <lb/>education (Takala, 2007; Bourke, 2009; Burton and Goodman, 2011; Ward, 2011). In these countries, the <lb/>deployment of support staff has been seen as the best strategy to create supportive and inclusive learning <lb/>environments, to ensure that all students, no matter what their needs are, receive adequate support that is <lb/>adapted to their difficulties and individual paces. <lb/>United Kingdom <lb/>In the United Kingdom, there are a wide variety of support staff roles, responsibilities and job titles. <lb/>Learning support staff receive the title of &apos;teaching assistant&apos; (TA), which also includes the &apos;higher level <lb/>teaching assistant&apos; (HLTA) role. Excluding special education support staff, other support staff titles include <lb/>&apos;minority ethnic pupil support staff&apos; (also referred to as &apos;bilingual support staff&apos;), &apos;student support staff&apos; <lb/>(includes learning mentors, education welfare officer, career advisors) and &apos;technicians&apos; (includes resource <lb/>teachers, music specialists, art technicians). <lb/>There are four grades of teaching assistant, from level one, for candidates without previous experience <lb/>as a TA, to HLTA. Once TAs are in post, they need to follow training and development (vocational <lb/>qualification, or equivalent) in order to progress up to HLTA. What is required of TAs at each level varies <lb/>between schools and local authorities, but as TAs progress up the scale their autonomy and responsibility <lb/>increase. Their tasks include getting the classroom ready for lessons, helping children who need extra <lb/>support to complete tasks, helping teachers to plan learning activities and complete records, supporting <lb/>teachers in managing class behaviour and supervising group activities, among others. Many schools <lb/>employ teaching assistants with particular specialisms, including literacy, numeracy, or bilingual TAs, <lb/>among others (UK Government, 2012). Qualification and experience requirements to become a TA are <lb/>determined by the Local Education Authority (LEA) and the individual school taking into account the <lb/>characteristics of the TA position that is offered. <lb/>Three requirements typically exist for candidates to be considered for a selection process: good <lb/>reading, writing and numeracy skills; to have taken, or be willing to take, the local authority-run induction <lb/>programme; and to have some experience of working with children of the relevant age. The induction <lb/>programmes for TAs, run by the LEA, are designed to inform them of the context in which they will be <lb/>working and the way they will be supporting teaching and learning. They seek to help TAs understand <lb/>their role and give them plenty of ideas about how to fulfil it effectively. Induction programmes include <lb/>training in areas such as literacy, mathematics, behaviour management, inclusion or ICT in teaching, <lb/>among others (UNISON, 2014). In terms of wages, full-time TAs&apos; earnings range from GBP 12 000 <lb/>to over GBP 17 000 a year, and for full-time HLTAs range between GBP 16 000 and GBP 21 000 a year, <lb/>depending on the LEA and the responsibilities of individual jobs (UK Government, 2012). <lb/>Prior to 2010, the UK government identified inclusion into mainstream school as the key to educating <lb/>students with behavioural, emotional and social difficulties and other educational needs. Consequently, a <lb/>number of policy changes were implemented to increase the rights for children with different attainment <lb/>levels to receive education in a mainstream school. The National Agreement for England and Wales on <lb/>&apos;Raising Standards and Tackling Workload&apos; was introduced in 2003, leading to an increase in the number <lb/>of learning support staff in England and Wales. The National Agreement addressed teachers&apos; workload <lb/>issues and established the basis to reform the training, qualifications and career opportunities for support <lb/>staff in England and Wales. <lb/>The Higher Level Teaching Assistants (HLTA) policy was introduced in 2007 to identify and <lb/>recognise support staff who meet the teaching assistant standards, with one aim being to provide smoother <lb/>progression for support staff wishing to become fully qualified teachers (OECD, 2014b). In order to get <lb/>EDU/WKP(2015)14 <lb/></body>

			<body>this status, learning support staff undergo a specific training and assessment programme. The HLTA&apos;s <lb/>roles consist of supporting teachers in class, acting as specialist assistants in specific subjects, supervising <lb/>other support staff and participating in lesson planning and learning material development (DfE, 2011). <lb/>HLTAs usually undertake more complex tasks and tend to work more independently than TAs, for <lb/>example they can lead a lesson in the absence of the teacher. There are four steps to reach HLTA status: <lb/>(i) if TAs have the support of their head teacher and line manager to access the training programme, they <lb/>can apply for LEA funding; (ii) once accepted, TAs start a training programme, which involves developing <lb/>the skills, knowledge and experience to the level required by the HLTA professional standards, tailored to <lb/>the candidates&apos; specific needs; (iii) after the training, candidates receive preparation for assessment, to <lb/>ensure full comprehension of the HLTA professional standards and the assessment tasks; and (iv) an <lb/>assessor visits the candidates&apos; school to verify whether they have met the standards (UNISON, 2014). <lb/>As noted previously, the number of support staff in schools has significantly increased in the <lb/>United Kingdom in the last fifteen years. Of all support staff, around 50% work in primary schools (with <lb/>70% being teaching assistants), and 30% in secondary schools. The student-teaching assistant ratio is 33.5 <lb/>in primary schools, and 80.1 in secondary schools. The same trend can be observed in spending on learning <lb/>support staff, which has doubled within a decade. In the course of 2008/9, schools spent on average <lb/>GBP 4.1 billion on learning support staff, and the amount was higher in schools with higher proportions of <lb/>disadvantaged students (DfE, 2011). As the number of TAs has increased, the role of these professionals <lb/>has experienced an important transformation, from that of classroom helpers assisting the teacher in <lb/>non-teaching tasks, to one directed to the whole teaching and learning process (Groom, 2006). <lb/>Figure 3.2 shows the relative growth in England of the number of teachers, teaching assistants and <lb/>students between 2000 and 2013. As it can be observed, despite the slight decrease in the number of <lb/>students during this period, the number of teaching assistants tripled (from 79 000 to 240 000, of which <lb/>about 14 000 were HLTAs), compared to an increase of 14% in the number of teachers (from 405 000 to <lb/>465 000) (Statistics UK, 2013). Consequently, the overall student-teaching staff ratio has fallen <lb/>dramatically. The change in the school workforce has resulted in increased school spending on teaching <lb/>assistants, which represented a cost of GBP 2.2 billion in 2010, within a total spending in schools of <lb/>GPB 35 billion, and compared to the GBP 19 billion spent on teachers (Audit Commission, 2011). <lb/>Since the introduction of the Classroom Assistants Initiative in 1998 in Scotland, classroom assistants <lb/>(as learning support staff are called in Scotland) have been highly valued by schools, teachers and parents. <lb/>The Classroom Assistant Initiative was launched by the Scottish Executive as a pilot programme in 1998 <lb/>and aimed to raise standards of attainment in Scottish schools. Over 4 000 classroom assistants were put in <lb/>place with the aim to reduce student-teacher ratios. In 2013 there were about 5 000 classroom assistants in <lb/>schools, almost 4 000 of them working in primary schools, and the student-adult ratio decreased to 15 in <lb/>primary schools and 17 in secondary schools (Scottish Government, 2013). <lb/>Wales has recently introduced the Improving Schools Plan (2012) and the Action Plan to Promote the <lb/>Role and Development of School Support Staff in Wales (2013), which advance the recognition of the <lb/>contribution of support staff in the Welsh school system and at the same time improve their preparation, <lb/>effectiveness and professional development (OECD, 2014b). The Action Plan seeks to: (i) introduce <lb/>minimum qualifications for support staff; (ii) provide professional development opportunities for support <lb/>staff; and (iii) include support staff in the performance management of schools. In Wales, support staff <lb/>make up 44% of school staff, and undertake roles within schools that vary depending on the school leader <lb/>and teachers, such as serving as a classroom assistant, teaching assistant, language assistant and <lb/>administrative staff (OECD, 2014b). <lb/>EDU/WKP(2015)14 <lb/></body>

In Australia, the states and <lb/>territories have the major responsibility for education, and there is no specific federal legislation that <lb/>mandates for the type of support that should be provided to students with special needs. Therefore, each <lb/>state and territory defines its own strategy regarding dedicated support for students with special needs. In <lb/>Australia, the latter include students with disabilities, learning difficulties, students who are gifted or <lb/>talented, as well as students who are socially disadvantaged or whose first language is not English <lb/>(Forlin, 2001, 2006). <lb/>In Australia, during the 1980s and 1990s, many special schools closed and the majority of students <lb/>with learning difficulties or learning disabilities were integrated into mainstream schools and received <lb/>additional support. A withdrawal model was the dominant approach during these years, and students with <lb/>learning difficulties or disabilities were withdrawn to a resource or remedial room for part of the school <lb/>day (Forlin, 2001). However, in the 1990s, this model was seen to have limitations, and concerns rose over <lb/>the appropriateness of the type of intervention provided. As a result, progress was made towards a more <lb/>50 <lb/>100 <lb/>150 <lb/>200 <lb/>250 <lb/>300 <lb/>350 <lb/>2000 <lb/>2001 <lb/>2002 <lb/>2003 <lb/>2004 <lb/>2005 <lb/>2006 <lb/>2007 <lb/>2008 <lb/>2009 <lb/>2010 <lb/>2011 <lb/>2012 <lb/>2013 <lb/>Relative growth <lb/>2000 = 100 <lb/>Teaching assistants <lb/>Teachers <lb/>Students <lb/>EDU/WKP(2015)14 <lb/></body>

			<body>inclusive approach based on a range of support options, where in addition to the withdrawing practice, <lb/>support teachers were required to collaborate with regular class teachers, and support was provided to <lb/>students with difficulties in the same class (Carroll et al., 2003; Forlin, 2006). <lb/>In Australia, differentiated support is provided by different personnel depending on children&apos;s needs. <lb/>Support in schools can be categorised into two main approaches: (i) support that is provided for students <lb/>with specific disabilities (e.g. intellectual, physical, autistic spectrum disorder, vision, hearing or <lb/>speech/language); and (ii) support that is available for students who have learning difficulties. Regarding <lb/>the latter, the different roles that exist in Australian schools are: Aboriginal and islander education officers <lb/>(AIEO), who assist and support teachers and Aboriginal students and act as a liaison between communities <lb/>and schools; education assistants, who support the teaching and learning of students (either with or without <lb/>specific learning requirements) by helping teachers to deliver education programmes and by encouraging <lb/>supportive and inclusive learning environments in primary schools; and ethnic assistants, who support the <lb/>specific English language needs of bilingual students (Australian Government, 2013). <lb/>In Queensland, support teachers are employed in all government schools to assist students with <lb/>learning difficulties, which is an umbrella concept that includes those students whose access to the <lb/>curriculum is limited due to any problem in one or more areas of literacy, numeracy and learning how to <lb/>learn (Education Queensland, 1997, 2013). These professionals receive the title of &apos;support teacher <lb/>(learning difficulties)&apos; (ST(LD)) and they are required to team-teach with the classroom teacher. ST(LD)s <lb/>undertake responsibilities such as: identifying the needs of students and collecting, monitoring and <lb/>reporting these data; coordinating support provision and writing educational plans for students with special <lb/>needs; assessing and teaching students with learning difficulties; and collaborative planning with <lb/>classroom teachers and other specialists (Bourke, 2010). <lb/>Furthermore, in Queensland, a whole-school approach is designed to cater for the learning needs of all <lb/>students, including: those in need of learning support; those who have educational support needs arising <lb/>from a disability; those who are gifted and talented; and those learning English as a second or additional <lb/>language or dialect (EAL/D); or a combination of these. This approach to supporting student learning <lb/>directs support to different levels of need in response to student achievement data. There are three layers <lb/>that represent a continuum of support for student learning, based on needs identified through ongoing <lb/>monitoring and assessment data. These are: differentiation, focused teaching, and intensive teaching <lb/>(Education Queensland, 2013). <lb/>New Zealand <lb/>Between 1995 and 2000, the Ministry of Education of New Zealand developed the Special Education <lb/>2000 initiative, with a focus on inclusiveness. As part of this initiative, the Resource Teacher: Learning and <lb/>Behaviour (RTLB) service was established in 1998/9, to provide a more consistent approach to catering for <lb/>students with additional learning and behavioural needs. The service was divided into clusters of schools <lb/>based on designated geographical areas to provide a shared service to the schools within given areas (New <lb/>Zealand Government, 2009). As a result, 500 special education teachers were reformed into RTLBs, and <lb/>another 250 positions were created to ensure a ratio of one RTLB to 750 students. A postgraduate <lb/>professional development program was created to prepare RTLBs (Thomson et al., 2003). <lb/>In 2004, an Education Review Office (ERO) report highlighted a need for more consistency in the <lb/>delivery of the RTLB service across New Zealand. This report found many positive examples of RTLB <lb/>practice, with 62.5% of the clusters able to provide evidence of the improvements the service had made to <lb/>student achievement. However, ERO expressed concern that 37.5% of the clusters could provide little or <lb/>no evidence the service had made a difference, and that only 20% of the clusters could provide evidence of <lb/>improvements in Māori student achievement. This report made some recommendations for improvement to <lb/></body>

			<body>the service and an RTLB Project Team was formed to develop the Resource Teacher: Learning and <lb/>Behaviour (RTLB) Policy and Toolkit (2007). This document provided schools with guidelines for the <lb/>management and accountability of the RTLB (New Zealand Government, 2009, 2012, 2014a). <lb/>In 2009, ERO reviewed the RTLB service again and found that over half of the clusters were not well <lb/>managed, with needs and priorities not identified or RTLBs not employed appropriately, not properly <lb/>supported or ineffectively monitored. In addition, ERO found some inconsistencies due to the large <lb/>number of clusters (approximately 200 by 2009). The ERO report recommended a review of the cluster <lb/>model to ensure a more effective delivery, management and allocation of resources (New Zealand <lb/>Government, 2009). As a result, a new RTLB cluster system started at the beginning of 2012, and clusters <lb/>were restructured and reduced from 200 to 40. Each of these 40 clusters was attached to a lead school <lb/>responsible for the governance and operation of the RTLB service for that cluster, and for appointing the <lb/>cluster manager and practice leader. The cluster managers have overall responsibility for the daily <lb/>management and coordination of the service across the cluster, and practice leaders are RTLBs with <lb/>additional responsibilities for professional supervision, performance reviews, and leading teams that focus <lb/>on specialist areas. Each cluster is now required to conduct a needs analysis to inform the cluster&apos;s future <lb/>practice and decision-making. Moreover, the cluster manager is responsible for annual reviews and <lb/>professional development of RTLBs. This professional development should be based on identified needs, <lb/>planned, led by credible facilitators, responsive to the cluster strategic plan and funded at cluster level <lb/>(New Zealand Government, 2014b). <lb/>In 2013, there were 900 RTLBs working with children experiencing learning or behaviour difficulties, <lb/>providing classroom teachers with special teaching strategies, introducing class or school-wide <lb/>programmes, or working directly with individual children or small groups of children. RTLBs work closely <lb/>with classroom teachers, the Ministry of Education, specialists and support staff, and are employed by and <lb/>based in schools. If a cluster of schools wants to establish an RTLB, the schools in the cluster must identify <lb/>which one will have the dedicated office/interview room, taking into account which one is the most <lb/>centrally located in the cluster, the largest and the one housing similar services. RTLBs work in primary, <lb/>intermediate, as well as secondary schools, and have a salary that can range from NZD 35 000 to <lb/>NZD 73 000 depending on the years of experience and qualifications (New Zealand Government, 2014b). <lb/>Some of the RTLB positions are dedicated to focus on the learning needs of Māori students. In these cases, <lb/>a Māori RTLB may work entirely with Māori immersion schools. Some are employed within a cluster and <lb/>others work across more than one cluster. Māori RTLBs&apos; allocation to clusters depends on the cluster <lb/>committee. This initiative recognises the high number of Māori students experiencing learning and <lb/>behaviour difficulties in regular schools (New Zealand Government, 2012, 2014a, 2014b). <lb/>For a teacher to become an RTLB, she/he must be a trained teacher with the full New Zealand teacher <lb/>registration and a current practising certificate. They must also; have either attained (or be in process of <lb/>attaining) the Postgraduate Diploma in Specialist Teaching (Learning and Behaviour), or attained this <lb/>qualification within the three years of starting work as an RTLB; have the academic prerequisites to enter <lb/>the mentioned Postgraduate Diploma; and have previous experience working with students with learning <lb/>and behaviour needs (New Zealand Government, 2014a). <lb/>All clusters are provided operational funding to run their cluster. This funding is calculated depending <lb/>on the cluster needs identified during the RTLB data gathering process, and is provided for: educational <lb/>support (e.g. assistance to students needing individual support); to release time for classroom teachers to <lb/>meet with RTLB; and for professional development for departments, syndicates or schools to enhance <lb/>skills in behaviour management or curriculum development (New Zealand Government, 2014b). <lb/></body>

			<body>The Nordic Approach <lb/>The Nordic countries (Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden) have developed a similar approach <lb/>for the use of learning support staff, based on the inclusion of diversity in comprehensive schools and the <lb/>right of all children, regardless of their needs, to individualised support. In Denmark, Finland and Norway, <lb/>support staff are not responsible for planning, undertaking or evaluating the actual teaching, and are used <lb/>as flexible, practical assistants for teachers, enabling them to focus on teaching. In these countries, learning <lb/>support staff also support children in a range of activities and tasks, and are used as a link in schools <lb/>between different stakeholders with the aim of improving personal relations between students, between <lb/>students and teachers, and between families and schools. <lb/>In Finland, the use of support staff (known as teaching assistants) has been increasing since the <lb/>introduction of this role in the 1980s. Previously, and since 1967, technical assistants were used in schools <lb/>(Takala, 2007). After the introduction of the Basic Education Act in 1998, every child has the right to <lb/>receive the support of qualified professionals in mainstream education schools. The support received by <lb/>comprehensive school students is classified into three approaches: general, intensified, and special support, <lb/>depending on the duration and extent of the support (Finnish National Board of Education, 2010). Every <lb/>child is entitled to general support. If general support is not enough, intensified support is provided, and if <lb/>intensified support is not sufficient, special support is given. Intensified support is provided to students <lb/>with special learning needs, and includes remedial teaching, part-time special education (for children with <lb/>speech disorders, reading or writing difficulties, learning difficulties in mathematics or foreign <lb/>languages, etc.), school assistant or interpretation services. The number of students receiving intensified <lb/>support amounted to 35 000 in 2013 (6.5% of all comprehensive school students), a 95% increase from <lb/>2011 (Official Statistics of Finland, 2013). <lb/>Teaching assistants can work with the same class, or with different teachers and different classes, and <lb/>their main goal is to help children during the learning process by teaching individual students, small groups <lb/>or the whole class in substitution of the teacher. Moreover, these professionals can monitor the progress of <lb/>more disadvantaged children and provide them with more individualised attention. Their tasks also include <lb/>assisting the teacher; managing children&apos;s behaviour; and planning and organising activities. Bilingual <lb/>assistants are also available for newly arrived immigrant students (Andersen, 2010; Takala and Uusitalo-<lb/>Malmivaara, 2012). The education requirements for a Teaching Assistant position in Finland consist of a <lb/>one-year Teaching Assistant vocational course. <lb/>In Denmark, learning support staff (also known as teaching assistants, TAs) have been introduced <lb/>recently, with influence from the Finnish approach. In 2009, the Danish Ministry of Education launched <lb/> &quot; The School Development Project &quot; . As a part of this project, between 2009 and 2012, approximately 125 <lb/>Danish primary schools (in 30 municipalities) were involved in pilot programmes using TAs in <lb/>comprehensive schools (from pre-school up to Year 10) with the aim of improving students&apos; learning and <lb/>social outcomes. The evaluation of the programme (Rambøll, 2011) showed a positive impact of the use of <lb/>TAs in primary schools, especially for disadvantaged students (the conclusions of the report are explored <lb/>in section 4.1.). The nationwide use of TAs in Denmark has, however, since been discontinued. But <lb/>smaller, locally financed programmes continue in a number of municipalities. <lb/>In Norway, learning support staff (known as assistants) are employed, among other things, to support <lb/>teachers with their instruction. According to the municipalities, an increase in student numbers and a desire <lb/>to give more individual attention to students are the main reasons for employing classroom assistants. In <lb/>2013-2014, there were 8 200 assistants (in full-time equivalents [FTE]) in primary and lower secondary <lb/>education, representing almost 13% of all FTE teachers and assistants. The number of assistants in <lb/>Norwegian schools has increased 25% since 2006/07 compared to a 6% increase in teacher numbers during <lb/>the same period. In pre-primary schools, the use of assistants is even more widespread and has been <lb/></body>

			<note place="headnote">EDU/WKP(2015)14 <lb/></note>

			<page>15 <lb/></page>

			<body>increasing steadily. In 2012, there were 37 719 assistants working in kindergartens (a 7% increase since <lb/>2008), while the number of teachers has decreased 4% during the same period (Norwegian Directorate for <lb/>Education and Training, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014). <lb/>Assistants in Norway don&apos;t usually possess formal teacher qualifications. A questionnaire (based on <lb/>responses from 96 school administrators and 174 assistants) about the assistants&apos; background and the tasks <lb/>they perform shows that the assistants&apos; highest completed education is usually upper secondary school, and <lb/>many have a qualification in &quot; health care, childhood and youth &quot; (Rambøll, 2010). Data from Statistics <lb/>Norway show that almost 20% of assistants in primary and lower secondary education, and 23.4% of <lb/>assistants in pre-primary education, have a trade certificate in Child Care and Youth Work (Norwegian <lb/>Directorate for Education and Training, 2013). The Rambøll survey shows that an assistant&apos;s main tasks <lb/>are to support teachers; assist students with practical, social, personal and educational support; and <lb/>occasionally take responsibility for instruction. According to the survey, 52% of assistants in primary and <lb/>lower secondary education stated that they help the teachers daily by supporting students with difficulties <lb/>in smaller groups, and 17% stated that they provide daily instruction in class without guidance from a <lb/>teacher. <lb/>In the Swedish education system, diversity is highlighted as an asset for teaching. According to the <lb/>Education Act, individualised extra support is provided to students at risk of not meeting attainment <lb/>standards. The National Curriculum for compulsory education establishes that this should be organised in a <lb/>way that individual solutions are possible for all students, so that students with difficulties of any type can <lb/>receive various forms of support (Swedish Government, 2011; OECD, 2011b). Yet, there are no clear <lb/>guidelines on how the support should be designed. As a result, municipalities and schools have a great deal <lb/>of freedom to design their own approach for supporting students with difficulties (Lindqvist, 2010). <lb/>Data on assistant numbers in Sweden is only available for pre-school education. However, <lb/>information exists regarding the number of students who received additional support. Around 40% of <lb/>students receive additional support at some point during their compulsory education (Emanuelsson and <lb/>Persson, 2003; Giota and Lundborg, 2007). One of the various forms of support available, to assist with the <lb/>growing immigrant population in Swedish schools, is language support. In the last decade, the number of <lb/>children with a mother tongue other than Swedish in pre-school has more than doubled from 40 000 in <lb/>2001 to 92 900 in 2011 (Swedish Government, 2013). As a result, 20% of children in pre-school have a <lb/>mother tongue other than Swedish. These students can receive instruction in their mother tongue in schools <lb/>by a teacher or an assistant if they cannot sufficiently follow the teaching in Swedish (Swedish <lb/>Government, 2011). In 2005, 14.5% of six-year-olds who attended the pre-school class had a first language <lb/>other than Swedish and, of these, 46.6% received a first language support (OECD, 2010). <lb/>3.2. Potential benefits of the use of learning support staff <lb/>A range of studies show a positive perception from different stakeholders regarding the work of <lb/>learning support staff. Parents, teachers and principals tend to value support staff&apos;s contribution in terms of <lb/>teaching effectiveness, classroom management, students&apos; learning outcomes and children&apos;s inclusion. <lb/>3.2.1. Benefits to student learning <lb/>Learning support staff&apos;s work can have a positive impact on student attainment through a range of <lb/>channels such as individual attention, behaviour management and children&apos;s inclusion. This section <lb/>presents an overview of the potential benefits learning support staff can bring to children&apos;s learning. <lb/>EDU/WKP(2015)14 <lb/></body>

			<body>Improved learning experience <lb/>Using learning support staff decreases student–adult ratios in the classroom and increases <lb/>individualised attention so that students receive more individual help and attention from either the support <lb/>staff or the teacher. This improves the learning experience for children, meaning that students&apos; learning <lb/>needs are more likely to be met, which is likely to lead to better achievement. This idea is supported by <lb/>Blatchford et al. (2002, 2004), who report positive teachers&apos; views about the contribution of support staff <lb/>to student achievement. Most teachers noted that support staff&apos;s work provides children with greater <lb/>opportunities for individualised attention, learning support and feedback. Learning support staff are skilled <lb/>professionals that spend a greater amount of one-to-one time with children, which enables them to adapt <lb/>their support and attention to children&apos;s real needs. <lb/>The use of support staff to enable smaller group sizes that are monitored by both the teacher and the <lb/>support staff allows children to be more engaged in classroom activities. In addition, groups can be <lb/>structured using different criteria, depending on the objective that is sought, i.e. students with learning or <lb/>behaviour difficulties can be grouped together in order to receive additional and specialised support from a <lb/>prepared professional, or can be separated and assigned to different groups with their peers, who can adopt <lb/>a teaching role with them, and contribute to their inclusion. <lb/>Classroom environment and behaviour management <lb/>Classroom climate is an important contributor to student achievement: the better the classroom <lb/>disciplinary climate, the more time spent on actual teaching and learning (Mortimore et al., 1988; Muijs <lb/>and Reynolds, 1999). In addition, evidence shows that a positive classroom climate is associated with both <lb/>cognitive and motivational outcomes, including improved academic performance, motivation, engagement, <lb/>school satisfaction, self-esteem and fewer disruptive behaviours (Baker, 1999; Patrick et al., 2011; Reyes <lb/>et al., 2012). The idea that a better classroom climate is associated with more time spent on teaching and <lb/>learning is supported by teachers&apos; perceptions as provided in the OECD Teaching and Learning <lb/>International Survey (TALIS) (OECD, 2009, 2014a), showing that classroom disciplinary climate 1 and <lb/>time spent on teaching and learning are positively related, with an average correlation of 0.5 among the <lb/>participating countries – ranging from 0.21 in Japan to 0.65 in Australia. In addition, TALIS separates the <lb/>variance for the index of classroom disciplinary climate in three components: teacher, school and country, <lb/>with the aim of understanding to what extent the variation in responses to this variable is accounted for at <lb/>each level. The variance accounted for at the school and at the country levels are minimal (7% and 8% <lb/>respectively), while the majority of the variance (84%) in classroom disciplinary climate responses lies <lb/>with the individual teacher (OECD, 2014a). In other words, the disciplinary climate depends mostly on the <lb/>practices put in place in the classroom itself, and to a lesser extent on the socialisation of the school or the <lb/>country within which a teacher resides. With this in mind, the work of learning support staff can contribute <lb/>to more productive, focused and relaxed environments, and more time on tasks due to assistance with <lb/>behaviour management and individual support. Cajkler and Tennant (2009) support this idea and point to <lb/>the fact that a more active interaction between the students and the teacher or support staff helps children <lb/>to better understand the task, which reduces the scope for children to cause behavioural problems, given <lb/>that they are more motivated and engaged with it. By contributing to increased time on task, defined as the <lb/>percentage of time spent on teaching and learning, learning support staff&apos;s work in the classroom provides <lb/>all students with a greater opportunity to learn. <lb/></body>

			<note place="footnote">1 To assess classroom disciplinary climate, TALIS asked teachers to indicate how strongly they agreed – on a four-<lb/>point scale ranging from &quot; strongly disagree &quot; to &quot; strongly agree &quot; – with the following statements about the <lb/>target class: (1) &quot; When the lesson begins, I have to wait quite a long time for students to quiet down &quot; ; (2) <lb/> &quot; Students in this class take care to create a pleasant learning atmosphere &quot; ; (3) &quot; I lose quite a lot of time <lb/>because of students interrupting the lesson &quot; ; and (4) &quot; There is much disruptive noise in this classroom. &quot; <lb/></note>

			<body>Cover for teacher absences <lb/>Schools lose significant productive time due to teacher absenteeism. An analysis made by the Audit <lb/>Commission for England (Audit Commission, 2011) found that teachers in English primary and secondary <lb/>schools were absent on average for 5.7 days annually, with an estimated cost of GBP 500 million yearly. In <lb/>the United States, 5.3% of teachers are absent on a given day, which represents a total cost of <lb/>USD 4 billion annually due to substitute teachers and associated administrative expenses (Miller, 2012). In <lb/>addition to this cost, the absence of a teacher has negative effects in terms of the quality and the continuity <lb/>of teaching, which may render difficult the coverage of the full curriculum and result in a poorer learning <lb/>experience for students. Research on teacher absenteeism (Varlas, 2001; Miller et al., 2008; Clotfelter et <lb/>al., 2007) shows that it reduces instructional intensity and creates discontinuities and disruptions to the <lb/>learning process. Moreover, schools usually hire low qualified substitutes who lack knowledge of students&apos; <lb/>levels and rhythms, which overall results in reduced student achievement that is even more noticeable for <lb/>disadvantaged students. Miller et al. (2008) estimate that each 10 days of teacher absences reduce students&apos; <lb/>mathematics achievement by 3.3% of a standard deviation: the equivalent to the difference between <lb/> &quot; having a novice teacher and an experienced one &quot; . <lb/>In this context, learning support staff can provide classroom cover in the absence of the main class <lb/>teacher, and contribute to a saving for the school in terms of covering expenses of hiring a substitute <lb/>teacher. Learning support staff are trained and qualified professionals who have a good knowledge of <lb/>students&apos; levels and the procedures and routines of the classroom, which enables them to provide an <lb/>effective instruction whenever the teacher is absent, ensuring the full provision of content and continuity of <lb/>teaching. <lb/>Children&apos;s inclusion <lb/>Learning support staff can contribute to children&apos;s inclusion and ensure that all children, regardless of <lb/>their situation (e.g. disability, language, family income, cultural background, gender or ethnic origin), can <lb/>participate and engage in the social and academic experience of schooling with equal opportunities <lb/>(Cajkler and Tennant, 2009; Ebersold, 2003; Thomas, 1997). According to Cremin et al. (2005), the use of <lb/>certain approaches to the deployment of these staff has appeared &quot; to systematise the allocation of teacher <lb/>and assistant time and attention to all children &quot; and to prevent children from experiencing both lack of <lb/>attention or oversaturation. <lb/>Countries such as Australia, Finland and the United Kingdom use bilingual assistants (also referred to <lb/>as &quot; minority ethnic pupil support staff &quot; or &quot; ethnic assistants &quot; ) to support the specific language needs of <lb/>bilingual students and students whose first language is not the language of instruction, as a way of <lb/>including migrant students and those from ethnic minorities. In addition, these professionals can act as a <lb/>liaison between the school and migrant and ethnic minority communities, and enhance families&apos; <lb/>participation in school activities. <lb/>A good example of this is a project launched in 2012 in Prague called &quot; Foreigners as Teaching <lb/>Assistants &quot; (META, 2013) which aimed to support the employment of foreigner long-term residents in <lb/>Prague with former pedagogical education as &quot; Teaching Assistants for Migrant Pupils &quot; . The programme <lb/>involved requalification courses, including pedagogical and Czech language courses, the creation of <lb/>teaching assistant positions and the creation of a job club to provide individual employment counselling to <lb/>the participants. As a result of the project, 29 immigrants were re-qualified as teaching assistants and 22 <lb/>were employed in primary schools. <lb/></body>

			<body>An alternative to grade repetition <lb/>In some countries, grade repetition is typically used as a strategy to respond to individual low <lb/>performance. Data from PISA shows that across OECD countries, an average of 12% of 15-year-olds <lb/>reported that they had repeated a grade at least once. In Japan and Norway, virtually no 15-year-old student <lb/>had repeated a grade, while in Belgium, France, Luxembourg, Portugal and Spain over 30% reported to <lb/>have repeated at least one grade either in primary or secondary school (see Figure 3.3). <lb/>Evidence shows that grade repetition is costly and ineffective in improving students&apos; performance: the <lb/>academic benefits are minimal and short-lasting, and there is an increased likelihood of not earning a <lb/>qualification or of only earning a lower secondary qualification. Requiring that students repeat grades <lb/>implies not only the direct expense of providing an additional year of education, but also an opportunity <lb/>cost for the individual and the society related to the delay of these students&apos; entry into the labour market. <lb/>The direct costs of grade repetition can amount to 10% or more of the annual national expenditure on <lb/>primary and secondary education in countries like Belgium and the Netherlands (see Figure 3.3) <lb/>(Schleicher, 2014). In addition to this, grade repetition increases the likelihood of school failure and <lb/>dropout, and affects significantly more disadvantaged students, which widens the achievement gap and <lb/>increases inequalities (OECD, 2011a, 2013). <lb/>Figure 3.3 Use of grade repetition and direct costs across OECD countries (2012) <lb/>Source: OECD (2013), PISA 2012 Results: What Makes Schools Successful (Volume IV): Resources, Policies and Practices, <lb/>http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/9789264201156-en. <lb/>The use of learning support staff to provide additional and continuous support to struggling students <lb/>has been shown to be a valid alternative to grade repetition in helping those students match their peers&apos; <lb/></body>

			<body>level of attainment. Supportive learning environments, consisting of monitoring learning progress and <lb/>detecting problems during the school year, can help students, especially those who are disadvantaged, to <lb/>improve their achievement, and prevent them from repeating a grade (Schleicher, 2014). Evidence shows <lb/>that for children receiving additional support, their progress is more marked when they are supported on <lb/>specific aspects of learning in particular subjects (Alborz et al., 2009). This supports the idea of <lb/>well-trained learning support staff pairing with teachers to support students, either individually or in <lb/>groups. Countries such as Denmark, Finland, Norway, Sweden and the United Kingdom, apply automatic <lb/>progression across the whole period of compulsory schooling and, rather than requiring students to repeat a <lb/>grade, continuous support is offered to students with learning difficulties. Box 3.1 provides details on the <lb/>Finnish approach. <lb/>Box 3.1 Individualised Support in Finland <lb/>In Finland, in 1970, a policy of automatic student promotion combined with early intervention was adopted, <lb/>and individualised learning and differential instruction have become the basic principles. Learning environments are <lb/>tailored in a way that all students can achieve their potential, and they are neither tracked nor streamed by ability. <lb/>Every child in Finland has the right to individualised support by trained professionals as part of mainstream <lb/>schooling and all teachers are trained in diagnosing students with learning difficulties and in adapting their teaching <lb/>to their students&apos; varying learning needs and styles. As a result, grade repetition is almost inexistent – less than 2% <lb/>of students who leave compulsory education at the age of 16 have repeated a grade. In fact, grade repetition is <lb/>only an option after the nine-year comprehensive school, when students are allowed to opt for an additional year to <lb/>consolidate their knowledge or make up their minds about future steps. <lb/>In upper secondary school there is no grade repetition because modules are used instead of grades, and <lb/>students build their own learning schedules from a menu of courses offered at their school. Therefore, the <lb/>programme is flexible and the courses selected can be completed at a different pace, depending on students&apos; <lb/>abilities and personal situations. Rather than repeating an entire grade, a student may repeat only those courses <lb/>that he or she did not pass. As a result, only 4% of students drop out during general upper secondary school, half <lb/>of whom move to vocational educational institutions. <lb/>Evidence suggests that the success of Finnish PISA results is partly due to the relative better score of the <lb/>lowest scoring students. The excellent relative performance in PISA results of the low-performer Finnish students in <lb/>all domains could be seen to support the Finnish policy of supportive education. In other words, this suggests that <lb/>Finnish schools are better at including disadvantaged students in the learning process. In Finland, Learning <lb/>Support Staff (called teaching assistants) assist the teacher and support students and, when a teacher is absent, <lb/>can also do substitute teaching. In addition, teaching assistants in Finland can follow the students with more <lb/>difficulties during their years in school, which allow them to acquire an in depth knowledge of these children and to <lb/>support them adequately. Finally, the 2007-2012 government plan for education and research underlined the <lb/>importance of taking the presence of immigrant students in schools into account and introducing measures that <lb/>enable these students both to succeed in the national educational system and to receive lessons in their mother <lb/>tongue, e.g. the employment of immigrant staff schools to support immigrant students in their own language. <lb/>Sources: Andersen, F.Ø. and G.

			<body>Workload reduction <lb/>Teachers are responsible for a range of tasks in addition to teaching, such as lesson preparation, <lb/>student assessment, in-service training and staff meetings, which are vital to ensure quality teaching. <lb/>According to TALIS, lower secondary teachers report spending the majority of their time teaching <lb/>(OECD, 2014a). As can be seen in Figure 3.4, lower secondary teachers report spending on average 19 <lb/>hours teaching per week (ranging from 15 hours in Norway to 27 hours in Chile). The other more common <lb/>activities of teachers are planning or preparing lessons (with 7 hours on average, ranging from 5 hours in <lb/>Finland, Israel, Italy, the Netherlands and Poland to 10 hours in Croatia); and marking students&apos; work <lb/>(average of 5 hours). Other activities such as participation in school management, communication with <lb/>parents and extracurricular activities take an average of two hours or less per week each. <lb/>Figure 3.4 Distribution of teachers&apos; working hours across activities <lb/>Average number of 60-minute classes lower secondary education teachers report having spent on the following <lb/>activities during the most recent complete calendar week <lb/>1 <lb/>1. A &quot;complete&quot; calendar week is one that was not shortened by breaks, public holidays, sick leave, etc. Also includes tasks that took <lb/>place during weekends, evenings or other off-classroom hours. <lb/>Source: OECD (2014a), TALIS 2013 Results: An International Perspective on Teaching and Learning, <lb/>http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/9789264196261-en. <lb/>Teachers&apos; working hours vary among countries, as well as the allocation of these hours between tasks. <lb/>In some countries, a large proportion of statutory working time is reported to be spent on teaching, and less <lb/>time is devoted to other tasks (for example in Chile, where teachers report spending 27 hours out of 29 <lb/>teaching). In some other countries, teachers report spending a large amount of hours teaching but also <lb/>dedicate significant time to other tasks, which results in a comparatively larger amount of working hours <lb/>than their counterparts in other OECD countries (for example, the United States, where teachers report <lb/>spending 26.8 hours teaching while working 44.8 hours per week).

			<body>Singapore, teachers report spending substantially more time on other tasks related to their job (40.2 and <lb/>38.0 hours per week, respectively) than they spend teaching (17.7 and 17.1 hours per week, respectively). <lb/>Learning support staff can be used in schools to reduce teachers&apos; workload, thus freeing time for <lb/>teachers to focus upon teaching tasks. By undertaking some routine duties and supporting teaching-related <lb/>tasks (e.g. prepare lessons and materials, monitor students&apos; progress, administrative tasks) as well as <lb/>teaching tasks (e.g. instruction to children in one-to-one, small-group or whole-class contexts), learning <lb/>support staff&apos;s work can enable teachers to concentrate on the tasks they are more skilled for or specialists <lb/>in, which contributes to a more effective use of human resources in schools, and to a reduction in the <lb/>amount of time dedicated to non-teaching tasks. In addition, teachers&apos; total working hours can be reduced <lb/>without affecting teaching effectiveness, preparation of lessons or students&apos; assessment. <lb/>More effective use of time <lb/>The presence of support staff can help teachers cope with disruptive student behaviour, which creates <lb/>a more productive atmosphere and allows the teacher to focus more on his or her teaching. The need for a <lb/>more effective use of time has been previously expressed by the OECD (2009) as a mechanism to ensure <lb/>that all students have an equivalent and maximum amount of learning opportunities. <lb/>TALIS 2013 results show that across countries with available data, in lower secondary education, <lb/>between 67% to almost 90% of time is spent on actual teaching and learning; between 5 and 12% of time is <lb/>spent on administrative tasks; and 9 to 20% of time is spent on keeping order in the classroom <lb/>(OECD, 2014a). Figure 3.5 shows that country averages for time on task are below 80% in Abu Dhabi <lb/>(United Arab Emirates), Alberta (Canada), Australia, Brazil, Chile, Flanders (Belgium), France, Iceland, <lb/>Israel, Italy, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, the Netherlands, Portugal, Singapore, Spain, and the United <lb/>States. Teachers in these countries also spend more time than the TALIS country average (12.7%) on <lb/>maintaining order in class (the exception is Abu Dhabi, with a percentage of 12.6%). In Chile, France, <lb/>Iceland, Portugal, the Netherlands, Malaysia, Singapore and Brazil, maintenance of order in class accounts <lb/>for more than 15% of lesson time, resulting in less time spent on teaching and learning. In these countries, <lb/>having two adults in the same class monitoring students&apos; behaviour could reduce time spent on <lb/>interruptions, which in turn would enable them (the teacher and the support staff) to be more effective in <lb/>their lesson delivery. Likewise, learning support staff can help teachers to cope with administrative tasks in <lb/>the classroom, which can account for a large proportion of time. Teachers in Brazil, Chile, Malaysia, <lb/>Mexico and Singapore spend on average more than 10% of lesson time on this kind of tasks, compared to <lb/>an average of 8% in TALIS participating countries. <lb/>EDU/WKP(2015)14 <lb/></body>

Approaches to the use of learning support staff in the classroom <lb/>Cremin et al. (2005) developed and tested three models for deployment of support staff in British <lb/>schools, namely: (i) Room management, in which staff working in the classroom undertake different roles, <lb/>depending on the needs of the class and the number of staff available, including the Individual helper, who <lb/>works with an individual or a group on a teaching activity for 5-15 minutes, the Activity manager, who <lb/>concentrates on the rest of the class, normally separated in small groups of 4-8 students, and the Mover <lb/>(where applicable), who move equipment and deal with interruptions in order to free the other group from <lb/>distraction; (ii) Zoning, a model that allocates teachers&apos; and support staff&apos;s roles according to the <lb/>classroom &quot; geography &quot; and assigns groups of students to each professional; and (iii) Reflective teamwork, <lb/>in which teachers and support staff discuss in depth their collaboration as a team, and develop it <lb/>accordingly. The three models were assessed focusing on two kinds of outcomes: (i) student engagement; <lb/>and (ii) teachers&apos; and support staff&apos;s perceptions of their own effectiveness when using the models. <lb/>According to the authors, room management was reported to encourage independence in all the <lb/>children and benefited those with additional learning needs, who weren&apos;t seen as the only ones receiving <lb/>additional support. Moreover, greater communication and collaboration in the planning enabled teachers <lb/>and support staff to complement each other. Overall, this model appeared to have the most significant <lb/>effect on increasing student engagement. However, it implies a large amount of time devoted to <lb/>preparation, and it is not clear that this would be available under normal circumstances. <lb/>Secondly, zoning was considered to empower support staff who felt that the model enabled their <lb/>support to be more effective. Teachers also felt that zoning was a natural way to organise the classroom as <lb/>0 <lb/>10 <lb/>20 <lb/>30 <lb/>40 <lb/>50 <lb/>60 <lb/>70 <lb/>Brazil <lb/>Japan Mexico Italy <lb/>Korea Croatia Chile Romania <lb/>Serbia Bulgaria <lb/>Portugal <lb/>Cyprus Spain <lb/>France <lb/>Israel <lb/>OECD <lb/>average <lb/>Estonia <lb/>Abu <lb/>Dhabi <lb/>(UAE) <lb/>Malaysia <lb/>Denmark <lb/>Slovak <lb/>Republic Sweden Iceland Poland Latvia Singapore Czech <lb/>Republic Finland Norway Netherlands United <lb/>States Australia Alberta <lb/>(Canada) England <lb/>(UK) Flanders <lb/>(Belgium) <lb/>Percentage of teachers <lb/>Teaching students with special needs <lb/>Student behaviour and classroom management <lb/>Teaching in a multicultural or multilingual setting <lb/></body>

			<page>24 <lb/></page>

			<body>it facilitated the monitoring of students&apos; work and behaviour. Moreover, the model was perceived to be <lb/>good for inclusion, as students with greater needs weren&apos;t separated into a different group. As a result, <lb/>students were more engaged, especially those with the lowest baseline engagement, and behaviour <lb/>improved. The use of these two models appeared to systematise the allocation of teacher and assistant time <lb/>and attention to all children, and to prevent them from receiving too little attention or from becoming <lb/>saturated with and dependent on support. <lb/>Finally, the reflective teamwork model, that forces support staff and teachers to give each other <lb/>quality communication time, resulted in an improvement in their effectiveness and relationship. The <lb/>authors concluded that a combination of the most effective elements of these three models could be used in <lb/>training teachers and support staff for a better use of teaching resources. <lb/>An alternative approach to these three models is co-teaching: a model that emphasises collaboration <lb/>and communication among all members of a team (usually a general teacher and a specialist/assistant) with <lb/>the purpose of jointly delivering instruction in a way that meets the needs of all students (Dieker, 2001; <lb/>Friend, 2008). This approach has its roots in special education, but is now used in all subjects and <lb/>throughout all levels of general education. It involves the collaboration between a main teacher and an <lb/>assistant specialised in a particular field (e.g. mathematics, science, reading, language, cultural mediator). <lb/>It is, for example, being used to support students who have English as a Second Language (ESL) in <lb/>the United States, and in English for Foreign Learners (EFL) environments, and has been considered <lb/>beneficial in terms of motivation, students&apos; participation and cross cultural understanding (Tajino, 2002; <lb/>Zehr, 2006; Haynes, 2007; Honigsfeld and Dove, 2008; Rahmanian and Haqshenas, 2012). <lb/>A possible categorisation of co-teaching is as follows: (i) One teach, one assist, in which one teacher <lb/>leads instruction while the other circulates and assists individual students; (ii) Station teaching, in which <lb/>students are divided in three groups and rotate from station to station, being taught by the teachers at two <lb/>stations and working independently at the third; (iii) Parallel teaching, in which each teacher instructs the <lb/>same content to half the class group with one aim being to foster instructional differentiation and increase <lb/>student participation; (iv) Alternative teaching, in which one teacher works with a large group and the <lb/>other works with a small group for remediation, enrichment, or assessment, among others; (v) Team <lb/>teaching (or Teaming), in which both teachers share the responsibility of teaching to the whole class; and <lb/>(vi) One teach, one observe, in which one teacher leads instruction while the other gathers data on specific <lb/>students or the whole class (Cook and Friend, 1995; Friend et al., 2010). <lb/>Other researchers have suggested different versions of co-teaching models which apply different <lb/>terminology to similar concepts. Haynes (2007) suggested six models of co-teaching between a general <lb/>education teacher and an ESL teacher. These models include (i) Teach and write, where one teacher <lb/>teaches while the other records the important points on a board; (ii) Station teaching (same as suggested <lb/>above); (iii) Parallel teaching; (iv) Alternative teaching; (v) Team teaching and (vi) Lead and support <lb/>(equivalent to One teach, one assist approach suggested above). Thus, variations can be introduced to this <lb/>approach, although co-planning, co-instructing and co-assessing are required for it to be considered co-<lb/>teaching. <lb/>A number of benefits of co-teaching have been suggested in the literature, including: an increased <lb/>understanding of all students&apos; needs, a more effective teaching and learning environment, a greater <lb/>exchange of knowledge and strategies between professionals, and decreased burnout for professionals <lb/>(Dieker, 2001; Dieker and Murawski, 2003). Murphy et al. (2004) analysed the effects of co-teaching in <lb/>primary school science classes by science specialist student teachers and main primary teachers on <lb/>children&apos;s attitudes, and found positive effects on students&apos; enjoyment in science classes, as well as fewer <lb/>age or gender differences in their attitudes to science than children who had not participated in the project. <lb/>Other studies have tried to address the effectiveness of co-teaching on students&apos; achievement, though many <lb/></body>

			<note place="headnote">EDU/WKP(2015)14 <lb/></note>

			<page>25 <lb/></page>

			<body>lack quantitative data. Murawski and Swanson (2001) conducted a meta-analysis of co-teaching research. <lb/>Out of 89 studies reviewed, they only identified 6 that provided sufficient quantitative information, all of <lb/>which were co-teaching experiments in the field of special education. While co-teaching was observed to <lb/>have positive effects, their analysis doesn&apos;t show a significant difference between co-teaching and regular <lb/>controlled classes. Some researchers state that this is because although co-teaching has big potential as a <lb/>strategy for improving students&apos; achievement, it is not easy to implement (Friend 2008), and the right <lb/>model has to be used (Abdallah, 2009). Many studies have tried to address the challenges facing the <lb/>successful implementation of co-teaching, including arranging instruction and planning time, introducing <lb/>creativity in instruction, building positive working relationships, clarifying roles, responsibilities and <lb/>philosophy of teaching, conducting evaluations, and ensuring administrative support (Dieker, 2001; <lb/>Honigsfeld and Dove, 2008; Friend, 2008). <lb/>In a recent study, Takala and Uusitalo-Malmivaara (2012) followed the development of co-teaching in <lb/>four schools in Helsinki during the TUPA (bonus for results) project. The TUPA project offered funding <lb/>for training courses for comprehensive schools in Helsinki to promote co-teaching: rewarding schools if at <lb/>least 5% of their lessons in general education were co-teaching lessons in the school year 2010-2011. The <lb/>results showed low levels of co-teaching (two-five lessons per week), which didn&apos;t change during the <lb/>follow-up study one year later. This suggests that monetary incentives are not enough to encourage co-<lb/>teaching. Lack of planning was the main reason for not undertaking this approach, or not doing so more <lb/>often. In addition, confusion existed regarding roles, possibly due to the lack of training to co-teach. <lb/>However, co-teaching was viewed positively by the practitioners, who identified issues such as <lb/>professional development, sharing with other professionals, higher well-being, more time for students from <lb/>teachers, and better quality of teaching or improved inclusion of diversity. <lb/>3.4. Implementation aspects <lb/>The extent to which the use of learning support staff in schools contributes to an improvement of <lb/>teaching and learning partly depends on the tasks and roles they undertake, as well as on the way they are <lb/>trained and deployed. This section presents implementation factors for the effective use of learning support <lb/>staff. <lb/>Deployment within schools and classrooms <lb/>The way learning support staff are deployed in schools can have a great impact on the effectiveness of <lb/>their work. In most cases, these professionals give in–class support to small groups of children who are low <lb/>performers or are having learning or behaviour difficulties. This leads to potential concerns as to the level <lb/>of preparation of support staff, i.e. if support staff are not adequately prepared, some students (those <lb/>working with support staff) may receive low quality attention and some others (those working with the <lb/>teacher) may receive high quality support. In some cases, though, teachers and learning support staff share <lb/>the responsibility of instruction, and allocate their roles according to students&apos; needs and their own areas of <lb/>expertise, for example, learning support staff can teach the whole class, while the teacher provides support <lb/>to students with learning difficulties. Thus, learning support staff deployment needs to ensure an effective <lb/>support for all students, whatever their needs are, in a range of different types of interaction (one-to-one, <lb/>small group or whole class attention). <lb/>Learning support staff usually work with various teachers, classes and groups, which can lead to <lb/>fragmented and inconsistent support, and may represent a challenge in terms of communication between <lb/>teachers and learning support staff. If learning support staff have to work with different teachers, less time <lb/>will be available for them to work as a team, and plan the class together, or engage in a reflection after the <lb/>session. Different studies (e.g. Moyles and Suschitzky, 1997; Cremin et al., 2005; Alborz et al., 2009; <lb/>Webster et al., 2013) signal this as a big obstacle for support staff to provide effective attention and <lb/></body>

			<page>26 <lb/></page>

			<body>teaching for students. Accordingly, the successful contribution of learning support staff in schools will <lb/>depend to a great extent on the quality of the partnership formed with teachers, and to ensure this, they <lb/>should have enough time allocated to work together before and after lessons. <lb/>Training <lb/>In order to provide support staff with the knowledge and preparation they need to face the different <lb/>challenges of their work, high quality specific training should be provided to them. Some studies <lb/>(e.g. Blatchford et al., 2004; Cajkler and Tennant, 2009) consider training beneficial for learning support <lb/>staff&apos;s skills and job satisfaction, as well as in raising knowledge and confidence, which can be expected to <lb/>have a positive impact on the quality of support that students receive. In addition, they indicate that in <lb/>order to prepare future support staff appropriately, training should be integrated into classroom practice <lb/>(e.g. through induction programmes) and should be based in team working approaches from early stages <lb/>(e.g. via shared training and induction for teachers and support staff). <lb/>As previously mentioned, in the United Kingdom, there are no nationally specified requirements for <lb/>becoming a teaching assistant (TA), and each local authority and school outlines their own specific <lb/>requirements. However, local authorities offer the opportunity for training and development once teaching <lb/>assistants are in post. There are two levels at which TAs can be awarded the National Vocational <lb/>Qualification (NVQ) for teaching assistants: Level 2 is designed to be suitable for teaching assistants who <lb/>may be new to the profession, and Level 3 is designed to be suitable for experienced teaching assistants. <lb/>To achieve level 2, TAs need to show that they meet seven units of competence, four of which are <lb/>mandatory, namely: (i) help with classroom resources and records; (ii) help with the care and support of <lb/>students; (iii) provide support for learning activities; and iv) provide effective support for colleagues. The <lb/>remaining three can be chosen from a list of five options including: support literacy and numeracy <lb/>activities in the classroom; contribute to the management of student behaviour; and support the use of ICT <lb/>in the classroom. To achieve level 3, TAs must show that they meet ten units of competence, four of which <lb/>are mandatory, namely: (i) contribute to the management of student behaviour; (ii) establish and maintain <lb/>relationships with individual students and groups; (iii) support students during learning activities; and <lb/>(iv) review and develop one-self professional practice. The remaining six are chosen from nineteen further <lb/>options, including: observe and report on student performance; promote students&apos; social and emotional <lb/>development; and liaise effectively with parents (TES, 2013). <lb/>In Norway, teaching assistants do not need a diploma. However, almost 20% of TAs in primary and <lb/>lower secondary education and 23.4% of TAs in pre-primary education have a trade certificate in Child <lb/>Care and Youth Work. Child care and youth work consists of three main subject areas, including <lb/>(i) health-promoting work, which is concerned with the relationship between physical and mental health <lb/>and activities for children and adolescents; (ii) communication and interaction, which deals with the <lb/>development of children and adolescents&apos; self-esteem and confidence; and (iii) practice of vocation, which <lb/>is concerned with the different types of educational activities for children and adolescents. In addition, all <lb/>apprentices must be competent in basic skills, meaning that they have to be able to express themselves <lb/>orally and in writing; be able to read and understand specialist literature and plans; be able to calculate, use <lb/>numbers and counting in educational activities; and be able to use digital tools for documentation and <lb/>presentations and to instruct children in the use of these tools (Norwegian Directorate for Education and <lb/>Training, 2008). <lb/>The education of assistants in Finland currently consists of 40 study weeks, one study week being <lb/>equivalent to 40 hours of work. Different vocational institutes offer this education, which usually lasts one <lb/>year. Other qualifications, such as practical nursing, are also considered acceptable as sufficient <lb/>educational background for an assistant. The core aims in the study programmes of all institutions offering <lb/>this education are: (i) to gain knowledge about the work environment of the assistant, including relevant <lb/></body>

			<note place="headnote">EDU/WKP(2015)14 <lb/></note>

			<page>27 <lb/></page>

			<body>laws and service systems in the society; (ii) to support human growth; (iii) to support functional ability; <lb/>iv) to guide learning. The education is linked to working life and students have a total of 12 weeks of <lb/>practice in the field, with the final examination being a skills test. This profession is regulated by the <lb/>National Board of Education (The Social and Health Institute in Helsinki, 2006; Finnish National Board of <lb/>Education, 2006). <lb/>Roles and responsibilities <lb/>It is typically the responsibility of the school management to ensure that the division of tasks and <lb/>functions between teachers and learning support staff is clear. A weak school management, unable to get <lb/>involved in clearly delineating staff&apos;s roles can lead to inconsistencies and variations in the way learning <lb/>support staff are used, as well as to task overlaps or mismatches. A clear definition of what are the <lb/>responsibilities of support staff and teachers in their work with students is key to improve teaching <lb/>effectiveness (Webster et al., 2013). The inclusion of these professionals in the staff team would enable <lb/>them to participate in whole school decision-making, as well as clarifying teachers and learning support <lb/>staff&apos;s roles. <lb/>Practices <lb/>Learning support staff may not always have the desired positive effect if care is not taken with the <lb/>practices used. According to research (Alborz et al., 2009; Blatchford et al., 2012; Webster et al., 2013), an <lb/>excessive use of practices such as withdrawing individual students from the class, working exclusively on <lb/>a one-to-one basis, or clustering the low-performing students in order to support their learning, may <lb/>actually create a barrier between those students that receive support and the rest of the class, and can have <lb/>a negative impact on their confidence and progress, as well as their ability to work independently. <lb/>In order to ensure the participation and engagement of all children in the class experience, learning <lb/>support staff should combine the support given to individual students with whole class work. Moreover, <lb/>these professionals should emphasise learning and understanding rather than task completion. With the <lb/>main objective being to promote students&apos; independence, learning support staff should avoid practices <lb/>consisting in providing answers and correcting mistakes, and instead give more time to students for <lb/>reflection and the enhancement of their participation in class. <lb/></body>

			<body>4. EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE ON THE IMPACT OF LEARNING SUPPORT STAFF <lb/>4.1. Learning support staff, student achievement and teachers&apos; work <lb/>There is not a great deal of empirical evidence on the impact of learning support staff on student <lb/>learning. This section explores the results from available studies: ranging from those indicating that the use <lb/>of learning support staff can negatively affect children&apos;s progress, to those presenting evidence that these <lb/>professionals can improve student learning. <lb/>A large-scale study (Gerber et al., 2001) examined data from Tennessee&apos;s Project STAR, a <lb/>longitudinal state-wide project in Tennessee (United States) designed to look at the effects of smaller class <lb/>sizes and the use of learning support staff from kindergarten to grade 3 of primary school. In Project <lb/>STAR, students entering kindergarten in autumn 1985, as well as teachers and teacher aides, 2 were <lb/>randomly assigned to one of three experimental interventions, namely: (i) a small class (13-17 students); <lb/>(ii) a regular class (22-26 students); and (iii) a regular class with a full-time teacher aide. Most students <lb/>remained in the same class throughout the four years, but teachers and teacher aides changed every year <lb/>(Gibbons and McNally, 2013, provide a good summary of the project). The full sample used by Gerber et <lb/>al. included more than 6 300 students in 79 schools across the state. Due to complexities with the sample <lb/>resulting from attrition problems (i.e. some students leaving the schools) and later accession to <lb/>experimental school programs (i.e. students moving to the treatment schools), which resulted in students <lb/>attending teacher aide classes (or small classes) for different lengths of time, the authors focused solely on <lb/>those students with particular patterns of participation (e.g. those who attended the same class throughout <lb/>the duration of the project) and used statistical controls to adjust for differential selectivity of students who <lb/>were more mobile. In addition, they controlled for gender, ethnicity, free meal eligibility and urbanity. <lb/>Overall, the results indicated that no significant differences in student achievement were found <lb/>between regular-size classes with or without teacher aides on any test in any grade. However, comparisons <lb/>between students in regular-size classes with teacher aides for between one and four years and those in <lb/>regular-size classes without teacher aides, or small classes, showed that students who had been in a <lb/>regular-size class with a teacher aide for 2 or 3 years scored higher in reading tests than their counterparts <lb/>in regular-size classes without support. On the other hand, students in regular-size classes with teacher <lb/>aides performed worse than those in small classes in all grades and on all tests. The authors suggested that <lb/>the lack of overall positive effects of teacher aides on student achievement could be solved through better <lb/>training and clearer roles for these staff, and stated that while the use of this kind of support may not have <lb/>an overall positive impact on learning, the deployment of these professionals to support specific students <lb/>might lead to higher achievement for those particular students, a question that their data did not allow to <lb/>investigate. <lb/>This question was later analysed by Muijs and Reynolds (2003), who studied the effect of using <lb/>trained learning support assistants to help students who were underachieving in mathematics, by using the <lb/>Numeracy Support Assistants (NSA) programme as a quasi-experimental design. The programme was <lb/>implemented as part of the Gatsby Mathematics Enhancement Programme Primary 3 project, and had the <lb/></body>

Later, with the primary aim being to help low <lb/></note>

			<body>primary objective to use more extensively trained learning support staff to support low achieving students <lb/>during and after mathematics lessons. It was conducted in 18 schools from two selected local education <lb/>authorities in the north east of England, starting in the summer term 2000. Students who were to be <lb/>targeted for support by the NSA were chosen by schools on the basis of test results and teacher judgement. <lb/>During the first phase of the project, NSAs were employed at key stage 1 (the first two years of primary <lb/>school in England, which comprises students between ages five and seven) to aid selected students during <lb/>mathematics lessons, by working with them both during the whole-class teaching segments and the <lb/>individual practice parts of lessons. NSAs had previously taken part in a variety of training activities as <lb/>part of the programme and were proposed roles such as: to observe and assess the group, providing <lb/>feedback for the teacher; to interact alongside the teacher; to take small groups in order to practise and <lb/>reinforce skills; to provide practical support; and to assess the children&apos;s progress. From the observation of <lb/>208 lessons, NSAs were identified to: (i) support students by encouraging them, reinforcing or practising <lb/>skills and helping them with the content of the activity in the beginning of the class (in some cases this was <lb/>made in a separate class); (ii) help a group of low achievers during the main delivery part of the lesson to <lb/>understand the content provided, as well as to provide the teacher with practical support by preparing or <lb/>distributing materials; and (iii) to support one group during group activities, by showing them how to solve <lb/>problems, or questioning and encouraging the group, while the teacher would be moving to support the <lb/>other groups. <lb/>The authors used a quasi-experimental design to examine the extent to which the use of NSAs was <lb/>effective in improving the achievement of low achievers at key stage 1. Low achieving children who had <lb/>received support were compared to those who had not, based on their score on a standardised mathematics <lb/>test 4 and controlling for a range of characteristics such as gender, social disadvantage (using free meal <lb/>eligibility as a proxy), special educational needs status and ethnicity. At the end of the school year, <lb/>students were re-tested using the same mathematics test. In addition, measures of whether or not the <lb/>student had received support from the NSA and the exact amount of time she/he had spent supporting the <lb/>student 5 were also collected. Finally, a multilevel modelling 6 was used to analyse the impact of the support <lb/>received, and teacher and school effectiveness were controlled for. <lb/>The results of the study do not provide much support for the use of learning support staff to improve <lb/>the achievement of low-performing students. Overall, no effect of being supported by a numeracy support <lb/>assistant was found. Likewise, adding the amount of time spent with the NSA did not have any significant <lb/>effect on progress in mathematics. However, there were some shortcomings to the study, for example: in <lb/>the comparison group, both students from ethnic minorities and with English as a second language were <lb/>over-represented, and although training and support were provided to NSAs during the programmes, these <lb/>might had not addressed their needs adequately, and no information about training quality was provided. <lb/>Furthermore, using eligibility for free meals as a proxy to measure social disadvantage can be argued to be <lb/>insufficient in measuring students&apos; socioeconomic status. Therefore, the two groups could possibly differ <lb/>in terms of social backgrounds in ways that could not be captured by the existing measures. <lb/>achievers in mathematics, the programme attempted to provide both training and an enhanced role for <lb/>learning support staff. <lb/>4 The test used was originally designed by the University of Leeds and contained an oral (&apos;mental maths&apos;) and a <lb/>written part. The written part consisted of open-ended questions, and students were required to show their <lb/>workings (which were marked). <lb/>5 NSA were required to fill in a form after every maths lesson with the names of the students they had worked with, <lb/>what subjects had been covered and how long they had worked with them. <lb/>6 Multilevel modelling is a technique used when the sample is clustered (in this case, in classrooms). It also allows to <lb/>look at how much of the differences in achievement between students can be explained by their individual <lb/>characteristics as opposed to classroom characteristics. <lb/>EDU/WKP(2015)14 <lb/></body>

The project was <lb/>implemented between 2003 and 2009 and was divided into two strands: strand 1, which included three <lb/>biennial large scale national questionnaire surveys of schools, teachers and support staff; and strand 2, <lb/></body>

			<note place="headnote">EDU/WKP(2015)14 <lb/></note>

			<page>31 <lb/></page>

			<body>which involved detailed analysis of the deployment and impact of support staff and qualitative analysis of <lb/>processes in schools connected to the deployment and impact of support staff. Given the large variety of <lb/>support staff roles in the United Kingdom (see Table 4.2), the DISS project developed a new classification <lb/>of support staff through the grouping of titles based on similarities in activities. Thus, a category was <lb/>created for TA equivalent titles, which includes Teaching Assistant, Higher Level Teaching Assistant, <lb/>Classroom Assistant, Learning Support Assistant (LSA), LSA for students with special educational needs <lb/>(SEN), Nursery nurse and Therapist. Nonetheless, Teaching Assistants make up nearly half of total school <lb/>support staff workforce (DfE, 2010). <lb/>The study found that TAs spent over half of their working hours directly supporting and interacting <lb/>with students. TAs&apos; interactions with students were predominantly at group level in primary education and <lb/>at individual level in secondary education, while teachers were mainly dedicated to lead the whole class <lb/>and move around the classroom. In terms of TA practice, they found that TAs were more focused on <lb/>completing tasks (e.g. encouraging students to complete written tasks, supplying answers and correcting <lb/>errors), while teachers were more focused on learning and understanding (e.g. explaining concepts, <lb/>encouraging students to think and checking understanding). <lb/>To analyse the impact of TAs&apos; work on teachers, teaching and student learning, the DISS project used <lb/>a teacher survey (4 091 responses from individual teachers), and systematic observations of students across <lb/>49 schools (more than 34 400 observations). To analyse the TA impact on student achievement, the main <lb/>student support survey was used, which measured the effects of TA support over a school year on students&apos; <lb/>Positive Approaches to Learning (PAL) (e.g. motivation, confidence) and academic progress. PAL <lb/>outcomes were based on teachers&apos; ratings on whether a student&apos;s PAL had improved, remained unchanged <lb/>or decreased. Academic progress outcomes were based on academic attainment at the start and at the end <lb/>of school year. <lb/></body>

			<note place="footnote">Overall, researchers found that TAs&apos; work had a positive impact on teachers and teaching. The use of <lb/>TAs was perceived by teachers to reduce stress and workload and improve their job satisfaction. Teacher <lb/>surveys showed that TAs had a positive impact in terms of increased teaching and curriculum coverage, <lb/>through bringing specialist help and removing administrative tasks, and increased time for planning <lb/>classes. Furthermore, systematic observations showed that TAs contributed to a better classroom <lb/>disciplinary climate, more individualised attention in primary education and more overall teaching in <lb/>secondary education, although it reduced student-teacher interactions. Teacher surveys and systematic <lb/>observations also showed that TAs had a positive impact on students&apos; learning and behaviour, particularly <lb/>in terms of improving students&apos; attitudes, behaviour and social skills, allowing individualisation and <lb/>differentiation of tasks, and increasing classroom engagement and interaction with adults. However, the <lb/>project didn&apos;t find positive effects of TAs&apos; work on students&apos; PAL and academic progress. Little evidence <lb/>was found that TA support improved student approaches to learning such as motivation, confidence, <lb/>independence or concentration. On the other hand, TA support was found to have a significant negative <lb/>effect on students&apos; academic progress across all year groups in the three core subjects (English, <lb/>mathematics and science). <lb/>The DISS study concluded that the impact of TAs on students is largely dependent on the decisions <lb/>made regarding how they are deployed and prepared, and their conditions of employment, and less due to <lb/>the individual characteristics of TAs and students. To support this, the authors developed the Wider <lb/>Pedagogical Role (WPR) model (see Figure 4.1), which conceptualises the key features and effects of TAs <lb/>and their work, and the relationships between them. They argue that there exists a complex network of <lb/>relationships between the different components of the WPR model, which ultimately explains a TA&apos;s <lb/>impact. For instance, regarding the conditions of employment component, the authors found that the lack <lb/>of planning and preparation time for teachers and TAs to plan and reflect is largely due to the TAs&apos; <lb/>statutory working hours, and the fact that some TAs are not paid to meet with teachers after school. This <lb/>EDU/WKP(2015)14 <lb/></note>

			<body>lack of time for teacher-TA communication is also part of the preparedness component and results in an <lb/>inadequate collaboration between teachers and TAs, with TAs often dedicating extra unpaid hours to plan <lb/>and reflect with teachers, or going into lessons unaware of the tasks that they will have to do. According to <lb/>the authors, &quot; TAs&apos; practice and the effects of the support they provide need to be seen in terms of the <lb/>decisions made about their deployment and preparedness, made by school leaders and teachers, which are <lb/>outside the control of TAs &quot; (Webster et al., 2011). <lb/>Figure 4.1 The deployment and impact of support staff wider pedagogical role model <lb/>Source: Blatchford, P. et al. (2012), The DISS Project: Background, Aims and Methodology, Institute of Education, University of <lb/>London. <lb/>In contrast to the research above, recent studies have found that learning support staff can be effective <lb/>at improving attainment when used to support specific students in small groups or through structured <lb/>interventions. Two recent randomised controlled trials conducted in England by the Education Endowment <lb/>EDU/WKP(2015)14 <lb/></body>

			<page>33 <lb/></page>

			<body>Foundation (EEF, 2014a, 2014b) found significant improvements in learning in literacy and numeracy due <lb/>to intervention programmes based on the use of learning support staff. The first trial was based on a <lb/>10-week programme (Switch-on Reading) for Year 7 students struggling in literacy (first year of secondary <lb/>school). This randomised controlled experiment consisted of 20-minute one-to-one reading sessions with a <lb/>TA and involved 308 students across 19 schools from one local authority in England. The results indicate <lb/>that the programme made a noticeable positive impact, on average, between three and five additional <lb/>months&apos; progress. The study suggests that the intervention can be an effective strategy for struggling and <lb/>disadvantaged readers, with an estimated cost of GBP 627 per student. 7 <lb/>The second study evaluated Catch Up Numeracy, a programme of one-to-one maths support for <lb/>students aged 6 to 11 (Years 2-6 of primary school), consisting of two sessions per week with TAs. 8 The <lb/>randomised controlled experiment involved 324 students in 54 schools from England and Wales, and three <lb/>groups were compared: one which continued with normal lessons, one which participated in the <lb/>programme and another one in which one-to-one support, without Catch Up Numeracy, was provided. The <lb/>study suggests that both Catch Up Numeracy and one-to-one intervention were found to significantly <lb/>increase learning. The effect size suggests that, on average, students struggling with numeracy and <lb/>receiving one-to-one support would make four additional months of progress over the year compared to <lb/>students who did not receive any support. However, there was little evidence that the Catch Up Numeracy <lb/>approach (with an effect size of three months&apos; additional progress) provided additional gains above those <lb/>from one-to-one intervention. <lb/>Also, several randomised controlled trials conducted in Denmark indicate that learning support staff <lb/>made a positive impact on student learning. As mentioned in Section 3.1, during the period 2009-2012, as <lb/>part of the &quot; School Development &quot; project of the Ministry of Education, approximately 125 Danish schools, <lb/>from 38 different municipalities, were involved in 44 pilot programmes using learning support staff <lb/>(referred to as teaching assistants, TAs) – in comprehensive schools with the primary aim of improving the <lb/>academic achievement of low performers and disadvantaged students. The evaluation of the two-year <lb/>Danish trials (Rambøll, 2011) was based on quantitative as well as qualitative data. Questionnaires were <lb/>distributed to school principals, teachers and TAs at the schools involved in the trials and time-series <lb/>studies with rating scales were carried out at the same schools to measure well-being as well as levels of <lb/>learning among the students. The Child Outcome Rating Scale 9 (CORS) was used to measure well-being <lb/>and learning among children. This measurement was combined with two derived instruments to form the <lb/>Learning Rating Scale 10 (LRS). The time-series studies were carried out in the form of a test at the schools <lb/>7 Estimates are based on a school delivering the programme to 24 students and training four teaching assistants. <lb/>8 It consists of two 15-minute sessions per week, delivered by TAs. The intervention separates numeracy into ten <lb/>elements, including counting verbally, counting objects, word problems and estimation. Students are <lb/>assessed on each component and instruction is targeted at those areas in which they require more need. <lb/></body>

			<note place="footnote">9 The Child Outcome Rating Scale (CORS) assesses four dimensions of children functioning considered to be valid <lb/>indicators of successful outcomes, transformed into a four-item visual analogue instrument. The four <lb/>dimensions are: (1) personal or symptom distress (measuring individual well-being); (2) interpersonal well-<lb/>being (measuring how well the children are getting along in relationships); (3) social role (measuring <lb/>satisfaction with school); and (4) overall well-being (Duncan et al., 2003). <lb/>10 The Learning Rating Scale (LRS) was developed specifically for the purpose of evaluating the Danish national two <lb/>year TA trials, in order to measure the connections between the psychological factors that promote <lb/>learning. The LRS measures four dimensions using a four-item visual analogue instrument. The four scales <lb/>are: (1) a learning gain scale (which measures the extent to which children feel they are learning); (2) a <lb/>social scale (that rates how well the children are getting along in school); (3) a method match scale <lb/>(measuring satisfaction with the way teachers teach); and (4) an expectation scale (which gauges how <lb/>much children experience is expected of them in school) (Nissen et al., 2014). <lb/></note>

			<body>in the first year of the pilot programme, and three successive tests during the second year. Finally, <lb/>qualitative case studies with interviews and observations of TA practice were also conducted during the <lb/>two-year trial period in eight municipalities. <lb/>The randomised experiments provided the participating schools with minimum requirements <lb/>regarding the recruitment and deployment of the teaching assistants. As a result, TAs used in schools <lb/>varied a great deal in their level of competencies (ranging from unskilled workers to trained social <lb/>educators and student teachers) and the way they were used. Regarding the TAs&apos; tasks, two main roles <lb/>were identified: (i) assist teachers in routine and practical tasks, thus enabling them to focus on teaching; <lb/>and (ii) improve interactions and relationships in school between students, students and teachers, and <lb/>families and schools (e.g. handling conflicts between students), in order to create the best possible <lb/>environment for learning. <lb/>The evaluation of the trials indicates a positive contribution of support staff to students&apos; well-being, <lb/>especially among the most disadvantaged students. The results suggest that disadvantaged students, who <lb/>tended to experience low levels of well-being in schools, were the ones who benefited the most from the <lb/>TAs&apos; work, with approximately 60% of the most disadvantaged students experiencing good levels of <lb/>well-being in the last measurement, compared to 1% in the first measurement. According to the evaluators, <lb/>this can be attributed to the fact that disadvantaged students were receiving the support they needed from <lb/>professionals that were working with them in different contexts and activities. On the other hand, and <lb/>probably due to some spill-over effects, in classrooms where well-being improved for disadvantaged <lb/>students, an improvement was registered in the learning environment for everyone in the classroom, <lb/>including the teacher. The TA&apos;s impact on students&apos; learning was not found to be strong, though. <lb/>Moreover, no evidence was found regarding the importance of the formal education of TAs. Practical <lb/>experience, personality and commitment seemed to be far more important. Finally, teachers&apos; responses to <lb/>the surveys suggested a positive impact of TAs&apos; work on teachers&apos; job satisfaction and overall teachers&apos; <lb/>work, primarily due to the fact that, thanks to the TAs&apos; support, they were able to focus more on teaching. <lb/></body>

			<note place="footnote">Another recent study (Andersen et al., 2014) presents the results of a large-scale randomised <lb/>controlled trial conducted in Denmark, and provides evidence of the positive impact learning support staff <lb/>can have on student achievement. The study analyses the effects on Year 6 11 students&apos; achievement of <lb/>three different approaches to the use of learning support staff in Denmark: (i) a co-teaching approach, <lb/>where an additional teacher peers with the classroom teacher in the whole teaching process; (ii) the use of <lb/>learning support staff (called resource teacher or teaching assistant), deployed to help the teacher and <lb/>support the weaker students; and (iii) the use of a professional tutor, or counsellor, who advises different <lb/>teachers in different schools. Of 68 municipalities (577 schools) that enrolled in the experiment, 18 were <lb/>selected on the basis of geographical spread, size of municipality, school sizes, etc. and were divided into <lb/>two groups. Twelve municipalities were selected to be treated with the co-teaching and the teaching <lb/>assistant approach; and the other six were selected to be treated with the counsellor approach. In a second <lb/>stage, the schools within each selected municipality were stratified according to the average national test <lb/>scores in Year 6 in 2012/13, and then randomly drawn to be selected for treatment. Those schools that <lb/>were not drawn in the lottery were used as control group. The selection resulted in 35 schools allocated to <lb/>the co-teaching approach, 35 schools to the teaching assistant approach, and 39 schools to the counsellor <lb/>approach. Of a total of 10 198 students selected, 4 923 were in the treatment group, and 5 275 were in the <lb/>control group. <lb/>For each approach, requirements were established. The co-teaching approach required schools to <lb/>deploy additional teachers for all Year 6 classes for at least 10.5 lessons of 45 minutes per week. In <lb/>addition, teachers were required to attend preparation courses. The schools received the equivalent of <lb/>11 In Denmark, Year 6 is the last year of primary education. <lb/></note>

			<body>approximately USD 26 000 per class. In the teaching assistant approach, schools were required to deploy <lb/>teaching assistants for all Year 6 classes for at least 14.5 lessons of 45 minutes per week. Teaching <lb/>assistants were also required to attend preparation courses, and the schools received also the equivalent to <lb/>USD 26 600 per class. Finally, municipalities receiving the counsellor treatment were required to employ a <lb/>counsellor for a half-time position to work with all the Year 6 classes of the schools in the municipality, <lb/>attending each class for 2.5 hours per week, on average. The municipalities received the equivalent of <lb/>USD 3 700 per Grade 6 class. In addition, there was a requirement for participating schools and <lb/>municipalities to dedicate the additional staff to the following focus areas: Danish language, mathematics, <lb/>and students&apos; well-being and inclusion. However, it was left to schools and municipalities to decide how <lb/>these staff should be managed and deployed to best meet the purpose of the project. <lb/>For the analysis, an extensive data base was used, including results in annual national tests, surveys <lb/>(pre-and post-treatment) among practitioners (school principals, teachers and support staff) and <lb/>municipalities, implementation and monitoring questionnaires, case studies and existing data from <lb/>Statistics Denmark, which includes information regarding socio-economic status, training, years of <lb/>experience, etc. for all the students, parents and staff involved in the study, and therefore enables a link to <lb/>be made with the information gathered by the study. <lb/>The data show that some of the additional staff were recruited from within the same school, but most <lb/>were hired from outside the school. Table 4.3 shows that most of the teachers and counsellors had a <lb/>teaching degree (83% and 69%, respectively), and only 29% of teaching assistants had a degree in <lb/>education. Teaching assistants were a heterogeneous group, with 16% being university graduates, 9% <lb/>studying a teaching degree and 46% with other backgrounds including artisan, teaching assistant, social <lb/>worker or high school graduate. Nonetheless, most teaching assistants were either trained/experienced <lb/>educators or student teachers. As can be seen in Table 4.3, counsellors were the most experienced staff, <lb/>with an average of 14 years of teaching experience prior to their then current job. They were followed by <lb/>teachers, with 6.5 years of experience on average. Finally, teaching assistants were the least experienced <lb/>staff, with only three years of teaching experience on average. 100% of counsellors had previous <lb/>experience as a teacher, while 86% of teachers and 46% of teaching assistants had teaching experience <lb/>prior to their then current job. <lb/>Table 4.3 Support staff characteristics in Danish selected schools <lb/>Type of staff <lb/>Background (%) <lb/>Teaching <lb/>Experience <lb/>(years) <lb/>Percentage of <lb/>staff with <lb/>teaching <lb/>experience <lb/>Teacher <lb/>University <lb/>degree <lb/>Teacher <lb/>Student <lb/>Others <lb/>Teacher <lb/>83 <lb/>17* <lb/>6.5 <lb/>86 <lb/>Counsellor <lb/>69 <lb/>31* <lb/>13.8 <lb/>100 <lb/>Teaching Assistant 29** <lb/>16 <lb/>9 <lb/>46*** <lb/>3.4 <lb/>46 <lb/>(*): Extension to teacher education (e.g. master degree); (**): Educator; (***): Includes background as teaching assistants or social <lb/>workers. <lb/>Source: Andersen, S.

To a lesser <lb/>extent, teaching assistants developed instructional tasks (e.g. instruction during teacher absence). Finally, <lb/>counsellors primarily developed an advising role in areas such as technical issues, interaction and <lb/>relationship aspects, and special education issues. The data show that most additional teachers and teaching <lb/>assistants participated in mathematics and/or Danish language lessons; with slightly more in Danish (three <lb/>hours per week, on average) than in maths (almost two hours). However, 17% of additional teachers and <lb/>32% of teaching assistants reported that they had participated in neither mathematics nor Danish lessons. <lb/>This suggests that additional teachers were devoted to fewer subjects, while teaching assistants participated <lb/>in several subjects, depending on students&apos; needs. Finally, data from surveys and case studies indicate that <lb/>teachers were satisfied with the support received in all three approaches. <lb/>Overall, the results indicate that all three approaches (co-teaching, teaching assistants and counsellors) <lb/>had positive effects on student reading achievement, measured as their progression in annual national test <lb/>results in the Danish language. However, the three approaches affected student achievement in different <lb/>ways. The co-teaching approach and the teaching assistant approach had an average positive effect on <lb/>reading achievement of 6% and 10% of a standard deviation, respectively, yet the difference between the <lb/>two approaches was not significant. No significant effect of the counsellor on student reading achievement <lb/>was found. For mathematics achievement, no significant effect was found from any of the approaches. <lb/>When examining different groups of students, teaching assistants and additional teachers were found to <lb/>positively affect girls&apos; reading achievement, whereas only teaching assistants were found to have a positive <lb/>effect on boys&apos; reading achievement. Furthermore, the teaching assistant approach was found to have the <lb/>greatest positive impact on reading achievement among those children with less educated parents (both <lb/>parents with, at most, ten years of schooling 12 ). In this case, teaching assistants enhanced student <lb/>achievement by 23% of a standard deviation, thus offsetting about half of the achievement difference <lb/>observed between students whose parents have no more than ten years of schooling and those children of <lb/>parents with more than lower secondary education. This may be explained by the fact that teaching <lb/>assistants were mainly dedicated to supporting low-performing students. Finally, the use of support staff <lb/>had a positive impact on achievement in classes with students with special needs. <lb/>4.2. Expenditure on learning support staff and student achievement <lb/>Recent research from England (Brown and Harris, 2010) assessed the relationship between increases <lb/>in expenditure on learning support staff (teaching assistants, TAs) 13 and changes in student attainment. <lb/>Data were collected from 83 public secondary schools in England 14 , including: school expenditure on staff <lb/>between 2005-2006 and 2008-2009; Full-time Equivalent 15 (FTE) numbers of staff and changes in them <lb/>12 In Denmark, compulsory education lasts 10 years. <lb/>13 Data was collected on teachers, teaching assistants, cover supervisors, librarians, technicians (e.g. ICT, Science, <lb/>Art, Music) and pastoral support staff (e.g. assistant house, behaviour support workers). <lb/>14 It should be noted that the average attainment of the selected schools was substantially above the national average. <lb/>15 Calculated as the total number of hours provided by staff divided by the standard number of hours required in a full <lb/>time contract (25 hours). <lb/>EDU/WKP(2015)14 <lb/></body>

			<body>between the same periods; and changes in student attainment 16 at Key Stage 4 (ages 14-16) over the same <lb/>period. No data were collected on the actual deployment of the staff. <lb/>Using regression analysis, the authors found a statistically significant relationship between increases <lb/>in expenditure on TAs between 2005 and 2008, and improved student attainment. For a 100% increase in <lb/>the expenditure on TAs, students attainment increased by 19%, explaining 3% of the variation between <lb/>schools (Rsq = .034). No significant relationship was found between increased expenditure on staff other <lb/>than TAs (including teachers) and improvements in student attainment. Moreover, the results indicated a <lb/>stronger and more reliable relationship between increases in the absolute number of TAs (FTE) between <lb/>2005 and 2008, and student attainment, with an increase in attainment of 37% for a 100% increase in the <lb/>absolute number of TAs. Finally, the results showed a significant relationship between the total number of <lb/>TAs in the school in 2005 and in 2008 with improvements in attainment. In addition, the relationship was <lb/>stronger in 2008 than in 2005, which can be due to the increased density and proportion of TAs in schools, <lb/>and a more effective deployment of these staff. This suggests that the larger the number of TAs in a school, <lb/>the stronger the relationship with increased attainment. The authors also assessed the impact of higher level <lb/>teaching assistants (HLTAs) on attainment, comparing the number of registered HLTAs and the number <lb/>achieving HLTA status between 2005 and 2008 in each school, to increases in attainment over this period. <lb/>However, no significant relationship was found. <lb/>Overall, the authors suggest that increasing the absolute number of TAs in schools is more effective <lb/>than increasing the expenditure on any other staff. However, due to the lack of information on TAs&apos; <lb/>deployment, the mechanism through which TA numbers improve student attainment is unclear. <lb/></body>

			<body>5. CONCLUSION <lb/>In the last two decades, learning support staff have become an essential part of the education <lb/>workforce in many countries, and countries like the United Kingdom and the United States have almost <lb/>doubled the average ratio of support staff to achieve a ratio of 15.5 teacher aides and teaching/research <lb/>assistants per 1000 students. <lb/>The existing literature shows that teachers generally value the contribution that learning support staff <lb/>make to teaching and learning. Learning support staff have a complementary role in regard to the teaching <lb/>process, but also substitute teachers in a set of non-teaching and routine tasks, such as taking on routine <lb/>teaching-related tasks (e.g. lesson preparation) to reduce teachers&apos; workload and allow them to focus on <lb/>teaching. The literature also indicates that the work of these staff can reduce pressure on the teacher in <lb/>relation to classroom management by helping the teacher cope with student misbehaviour, thus creating a <lb/>more productive classroom atmosphere. Furthermore, learning support staff can pair with teachers during <lb/>class in a complementary way, potentially providing the most effective teaching in every different context. <lb/>There are several ways through which learning support staff can have a positive impact on student <lb/>attainment. With an additional professional in class, students receive more individual help and attention <lb/>from either the support staff or the teacher. Therefore, students&apos; learning needs are more likely to be met, <lb/>which is likely to lead to greater achievement. In addition, the use of learning support staff enables a more <lb/>flexible learning environment, and groups of different size and characteristics can be created to better <lb/>respond to students&apos; needs and grant increased engagement and inclusion of children in classroom <lb/>activities. The use of learning support staff in schools can also contribute to a greater inclusion of <lb/>immigrant students and parents. Furthermore, learning support staff can cover teachers in their absence, <lb/>taking responsibility for classroom instruction, and thus maintain a high intensity of instruction and avoid <lb/>interruptions. Finally, the use of learning support staff can be an effective strategy to reduce grade <lb/>repetition, which is a costly and ineffective approach to address learning difficulties. <lb/>Research provides mixed evidence of the effect of learning support staff on student learning. No <lb/>significant differences in student achievement were found by a large-scale study examining data from <lb/>Tennessee&apos;s Project STAR between classes with or without learning support staff. Similarly, an English <lb/>study analysing the effect of trained learning support staff to help students underachieving in mathematics <lb/>using a quasi-experimental design didn&apos;t provide support for the use of learning support staff to improve <lb/>the achievement of low-performing students. The Deployment and Impact of Support Staff (DISS) project, <lb/>conducted in the United Kingdom, which analysed the impact of learning support staff on teachers, <lb/>teaching and student learning, behaviour and academic progress, also found very little evidence that <lb/>learning support staff contribute to improving student approaches to learning, such as motivation, <lb/>confidence, independence or concentration, and also found that these staff could have a negative effect on <lb/>student academic progress. <lb/>However, there is also evidence that, depending on the approach, learning support staff&apos;s work can <lb/>have a positive impact on student learning. Their support is perceived by teachers to reduce stress and <lb/>workload and improve their job satisfaction. Teachers also report that learning support staff positively <lb/>contribute in terms of increased teaching and curriculum coverage, through providing specialist help and <lb/>reducing administrative tasks, and granting the teacher more time for planning classes. Also, recent <lb/>research suggests that when used to support specific students and/or through structured interventions, <lb/>learning support staff can be effective at improving student attainment. Approaches such as one-to-one <lb/>interventions directed towards struggling students in the United Kingdom have been shown to positively <lb/>affect student learning. Similarly, randomised controlled trials conducted in Denmark suggests that the use <lb/></body>

			<page>39 <lb/></page>

			<body>of additional staff in classes, either in co-teaching settings or as support staff, benefits student learning and <lb/>well-being, especially for those students who have low levels of performance. Finally, a recent study from <lb/>the United Kingdom indicates that an increase in the absolute number of learning support staff in schools <lb/>improves student attainment, particularly among disadvantaged students, who tend to experience low <lb/>levels of well-being in schools and lower levels of attainment. Overall, these studies agree that learning <lb/>support staff can contribute to student learning and well-being through, among others, a better classroom <lb/>climate, individualised attention and increased overall teaching. <lb/>This literature review also noted the importance of implementation for the effective use of learning <lb/>support staff in schools. Learning support staff are often the professionals who support students with <lb/>difficulties and low levels of performance, and they are increasingly undertaking more and more <lb/>pedagogical responsibilities. In this context, training should provide these professionals with the adequate <lb/>skills and competences to be able to face these challenges effectively. In addition, the literature suggests <lb/>that this training should be based in team work approaches and integrated into classroom practice from an <lb/>early stage. If not managed effectively, the way learning support staff are used in schools can lead to <lb/>fragmented and inconsistent support. The school management should ensure a clear definition of <lb/>teachers/learning support staff&apos;s respective roles, and provide enough time for them to plan and prepare <lb/>classes and engage in reflection. The inclusion of learning support staff in the school&apos;s decision-making, as <lb/>well as in the delineation of teachers&apos; and learning support staff&apos;s roles, could be an effective strategy to <lb/>achieve this. In addition, learning support staff may not always have the desired positive effect if care is <lb/>not taken with the practices used, and their work can negatively affect their participation and engagement <lb/>in the class experience. Learning support should ensure the inclusion of all children in classroom practice, <lb/>combining a diversity of approaches and practices. <lb/>EDU/WKP(2015)14 <lb/></body>
