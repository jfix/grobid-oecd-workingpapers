			<p>1.<lb/> Against a background of increased pressure on public finances, the question of how to control<lb/> hospital spending, which is predominantly funded from public sources, is a major issue for OECD<lb/> countries. In 2011, hospital care accounted for 29% of all health spending, on average in OECD countries,<lb/> and for 2.6% of gross domestic product (GDP).

			<head>INTRODUCTION 1<lb/></head>

			<p>4.<lb/> The question of how to control hospital spending, which is mainly publicly funded, is a major<lb/> issue for OECD countries. In 2011, hospital care accounted, on average, for 29% of all health spending in<lb/> the OECD countries and 2.6% of gross domestic product (GDP). In two-thirds of the OECD countries,<lb/> over 90% of these costs are funded from public sources.<lb/> 5.<lb/> Payment systems are just one of the instruments available to private or public payers to regulate<lb/> the behaviour of health care providers and encourage certain structures to become more efficient and<lb/> productive. OECD countries introduced DRG-based hospital payment systems for different reasons,<lb/> including increase efficiency in the use of resources in hospitals, contain hospital costs, increase<lb/> transparency, reduce waiting times, support patient choices and/or improve the quality of care. The tool to<lb/> achieve these objectives is prospective tariffs per case depending on the diagnosis and procedures<lb/> performed and irrespective of the actual costs incurred. These DRG-based payments serve as financial<lb/> incentives to hospitals to reduce costs per patient and average length of stay thus improving technical<lb/> efficiency. But payment via DRG also encourages hospitals to treat more patients and increase hospital<lb/> activity when marginal revenue is above the marginal cost per patient. Whether expenditure in hospitals<lb/> increases or decreases depends on which of the two contrary effects dominate: increasing the number of<lb/> cases or decreasing the number of services per case (<ref type="biblio">Geissler et al. 2011</ref>).<lb/> 6.<lb/> In order to contain the inflation of hospital activity under DRG-based payment systems and to<lb/> incentivize hospitals to perform only strictly necessary procedures, some OECD countries have reduced<lb/> the rate of remuneration (tariff) by which DRG-based payments are made above a defined volume of<lb/> production. The main reason to justify this payment reduction, a mechanism known as &quot; tapering payment &quot; ,<lb/> is that -as in many alternative industries -economies of scale can be achieved in the production process of<lb/> hospital services. Economies of scale are achieved when the unit cost of production decreases when total<lb/> production increases. This concept is especially pertinent where production entails a significant level of<lb/> fixed costs. Whilst the nature of costs (fixed and variable) can vary over time, the structure of hospital<lb/> production has features which, in theory at least, justify the existence of economies of scale. Depreciation,<lb/> maintenance, and general logistics are fixed costs which are theoretically already fully taken into account<lb/> once a pre-defined level of production is attained. Above this threshold, reduced payments based on a<lb/> tapering scale then means that the hospital will only be reimbursed for the variable costs of the care it<lb/> delivers.<lb/> 7.<lb/> For a full picture of the challenges entailed in operating a tapering scale mechanism, this paper<lb/> begins with an overview of hospital services and hospital payment methods across OECD countries,<lb/> focusing more specifically on DRG-based payment systems, the framework within which tapering payment<lb/> can be made operational. Our study then sets out the economic arguments for introducing the tapering<lb/> scale, drawing on a review of the literature on economies of scale within the hospital sector. Thereafter,<lb/> four case studies from Germany, the US State of Maryland, the Czech Republic and Israel are presented to<lb/> give detailed insights into the different approaches of introducing this mechanism, the national context of<lb/> the implementation, and the impacts it has had on controlling hospital volumes.<lb/></p>

			<head>OVERVIEW OF HOSPITAL SECTOR AND PAYMENT METHODS IN OECD COUNTRIES<lb/></head>

			<p>8.<lb/> Against a background of increased pressure on public finances, the question of how to control<lb/> hospital spending is a major issue for policy makers in many OECD countries. Hospital care<lb/> 2 accounts for<lb/> 29% of total health spending on average across OECD countries. In some countries, such as France,<lb/> Greece and Austria, this share is more than a third.<lb/> 9.<lb/> When it comes to reining in hospital spending, the mechanisms by which hospitals are paid can<lb/> play a pivotal role as they provide different financial incentives for actors in this sector. In OECD<lb/> countries, four main types of payment system are used to remunerate hospitals: DRG-based payment,<lb/> prospective global budgets, line-item budgeting and fee-for-service/payment for activity (see Box 1 for<lb/> definitions). The first section below describes the main features of the hospital sector in OECD countries<lb/> and shows the diversity of the contexts within which the various hospital payment systems operate. The<lb/> next sections presents how hospital care is financed and how hospital services are paid for.<lb/></p>

			<table>The share of hospital care costs in total health spending is falling, but still accounts for 29% of<lb/> expenditure in OECD countries<lb/> 10.<lb/> The following brief overview of hospital spending seeks to put the use of DRG-based payment<lb/> and payment reductions based on a tapering scale in OECD countries into a financial context.<lb/> 11.<lb/> Spending on hospital care accounted, on average, for 2.6% of gross domestic product (GDP) in<lb/> OECD countries in 2011 (OECD Health Statistics, 2013) but differed widely across countries. The figure<lb/> was highest for France (4.2% of GDP), followed by Austria (3.6%) and Greece (3.4% of GDP). At the<lb/> other end of the scale, Chile devoted only 1% of its GDP to inpatient care.<lb/> 12.<lb/> In a similar way, per capita spending on hospital care ranged from USD PPP 209 to 1 660 in<lb/> 2011. It stood at USD PPP 1 482 in France which was about 50% above the OECD average of<lb/> USD PPP 973 (<ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>) but still somewhat below the top spenders Norway (1 660 USD PPP),<lb/> Switzerland (1 561 USD PPP) and Austria (1 530 USD PPP).<lb/></p>

			<figure>Figure 1: Per capita spending on hospital inpatient care in 2011 (or nearest year)<lb/> * Data for 2010<lb/> Source: OECD Health Statistics 2013<lb/></figure>

			<p>13.<lb/> Spending on hospital and outpatient care makes up a significant proportion of overall health<lb/> spending in OECD countries. In 2011, together they accounted for about 62% of current health spending,<lb/> on average (<ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>). A further 20% of health spending went on medical goods (mainly pharmaceuticals,<lb/> which were 17% of the total), 12% on long-term care and the remaining 6% on collective services, such as<lb/> public health programmes, preventive services and administration.<lb/></p>

Many countries have taken measures to<lb/> rein in public spending in this area: cutting staff numbers, reducing salaries paid to health professionals and<lb/> fees paid to health care providers, and increasing the patient&apos;s out-of-pocket share -all in an attempt to<lb/> ease the pressure on budgets (<ref type="biblio">Morgan and Astolfi, 2013</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<head>Hospital funding in OECD countries<lb/></head>

			<p>16.<lb/> The source of funding for hospitals differs between OECD countries and is intrinsically linked to<lb/> the structure of the health system. How a patient is protected against the cost of hospital care defines the<lb/> main financing block of a country&apos;s health system. The characteristics of basic health care coverage in<lb/> OECD countries are presented below, followed by an outline of the various hospital payment methods<lb/> used.<lb/></p>

			<head>Hospital costs are mainly financed by the public sector<lb/></head>

			<p>17.<lb/> In OECD countries, there are two major sources of funding, depending on the characteristics of<lb/> each country&apos;s system for covering health care costs (<ref type="table">Table 1</ref>). National health systems of the kind seen in<lb/> the United Kingdom, Portugal and Spain, and local health systems such as those in Finland and Sweden,<lb/> are funded mainly through taxation. Health insurance systems, on the other hand, are predominantly<lb/> funded out of employees&apos; and employers&apos; social insurance contributions and can be implemented by one or<lb/> multiple insurance funds. Most countries with multiple health insurers have a range of competing insurers,<lb/> that is, an individual can choose between different insurance funds (e.g. Czech Republic, Germany, Israel).<lb/> However, in some other countries with multiple insurers, such as France, Belgium, Austria and Japan,<lb/> affiliation to one insurance fund is automatic, depending, for example, on an individual&apos;s occupation.<lb/></p>

			<p>Although tax-funded and health insurance systems have differences in terms of access and<lb/> entitlement to health care goods and services, they share similarities in the way hospital costs are financed.<lb/> On average, across OECD countries, 88% of hospital costs were funded by the public sector in 2011. The<lb/> exception is the United States where private insurers meet 36% of hospital costs. This is due to the fact in<lb/> the US private insurers provide basic cover to 53% of the population. In most other OECD countries,<lb/> private insurance has a much more limited role, providing either complementary (e.g. France, Belgium,<lb/> Slovenia, Luxembourg) or supplementary coverage (e.g. Netherlands, Israel, Canada, Austria, Switzerland,<lb/> Finland) to their populations. As a result, private insurers finance only around 5% of hospital spending, on<lb/> average. Some hospital costs are also financed directly from patients: 6% on average across the OECD<lb/> compared to 20% of total spending on health (<ref type="biblio">OECD, 2013</ref>). This shows that public coverage for hospitals<lb/> costs in OECD countries is generally higher than for other health care goods or services<lb/> (e.g. pharmaceuticals).<lb/></p>

			<figure>Figure 4: Structure of hospital cost funding in 2011 (or nearest year)<lb/> Source: OECD Health Statistics 2013<lb/></figure>

			<p>19.<lb/> The financing structure of hospitals not only varies between countries but can also differ between<lb/> public and private hospitals within a country (<ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref>). This suggests that the nature of health care<lb/> provided by public and private hospitals may sometimes differ. In France, the funding of public and private<lb/> hospitals is similarly structured (90% covered by the public sector), which means that private hospitals are<lb/> reimbursed by health insurance funds for the care they deliver on the same basis as public hospitals. The<lb/> same holds for Finland. By contrast, in Spain, Portugal and Greece, the funding structures are quite<lb/> different, suggesting that treatments performed by private hospitals are not entirely covered by basic health<lb/> insurance. In Spain, for example, the public sector meets 100% of the costs of care provided in public<lb/> hospitals but only 66% of the costs of private hospital care.<lb/></p>

			<head>Trend towards DRG-based payment in health insurance systems<lb/></head>

			<p>20.<lb/> In 2012, the OECD conducted a survey of the institutional characteristics of its member<lb/> countries&apos; health systems 3 . This survey describes country-specific arrangements for covering the<lb/> population against health risks and financing health spending. It depicts the organisation of health care<lb/> delivery, focusing on the public/private mix of health care provision, provider payment schemes, user<lb/> choice and competition among providers, as well as the regulation of health care supply and prices. Finally,<lb/> it provides information on governance and resource allocation in health systems (decentralisation in<lb/> decision-making, nature of budget constraints and priority setting). Part of this survey was dedicated to the<lb/> modes of payment and the organisation of inpatient care.<lb/></p>

			<head>Box 1. Definition of main hospital payment systems<lb/> Global budget<lb/></head>

			<p>Total amount allocated prospectively to the hospital to fund its activities over the course of the year.<lb/> Generally, hospitals have some degree of autonomy in deciding how funds are used.<lb/></p>

			<head>Line-item budgeting<lb/></head>

			<p>Line-item budgeting follows the same principle as the global budget except that funds are allocated to<lb/> different cost items or services. The main difference between these two budgeting mechanisms is the hospital&apos;s<lb/> degree of freedom in allocating resources among its various activities.<lb/></p>

			<head>DRG-based payment<lb/></head>

			<p>In general, DRG-based payment (or payment per case) funds all the services and deliverables required<lb/> during a hospital stay in one single payment, with some exceptions for possible additional payments such as<lb/> expensive medication. In this payment system, patients are clustered into groups according to their diagnosis and<lb/> the procedures performed. The aim is to create patient groups that use a similar amount of resources in the<lb/> course of the treatment and thus reflect a similar cost for service provision. Hospitals receive an identical<lb/> payment (DRG tariff) for each patient within a DRG category, with possible adjustments (e.g. by regions, for<lb/> outliers, etc.). DRG tariffs are usually set on the basis of the national average costs of all the services included in<lb/> a DRG, calculated from a sample of hospitals. The payment a hospital receives is known prospectively and<lb/> irrespective of the length of stay and the actual costs incurred. In practice, DRG rates can be either defined as<lb/> relative weights, to be multiplied by a &quot; nominal point value &quot; to obtain a monetary value, or as a &quot; raw tariffs (see<lb/></p>

			<table>table below). Adjustments can be applied to DRG tariffs to allow, for example, for specific factors such as hospital<lb/> location, hospital status or patient characteristics.<lb/> Table: DRG weight approach<lb/> Source: adapted from Busse (2011)<lb/></table>

			<head>Fee-for-service payment<lb/></head>

			<p>In a fee-for-service payment scheme, hospitals are remunerated retrospectively for every service and<lb/> procedure performed in the course of the treatment of a patient.<lb/></p>

			<head>Per-diem payment<lb/></head>

			<p>In a per-diem payment regime hospitals are reimbursed retrospectively on the basis of the number of days<lb/> spent in hospital. They receive a fixed amount for each patient day. The daily rates may differ between different<lb/> specialties but also between different types of care (e.g. intensive care).<lb/> 21.<lb/> Countries with health insurance systems tend to use DRG-based payment systems as the main<lb/> method to finance hospital inpatient activity (<ref type="table">Table 2</ref>)<lb/> 4 : 70% of them have opted for DRG-based payments<lb/> to public hospitals (14 out of 20) while the remaining countries rather use prospective global budget<lb/> (Belgium, Luxembourg) or fee-for-service payment (Israel, Korea, Slovakia).<lb/></p>

			<p>treat more patients, increasing hospital activity when marginal revenue is above the<lb/> marginal cost per patient. In an attempt to limit spending growth which may be a consequence of the<lb/> introduction of DRG payment schemes, some OECD countries have reduced the DRG tariffs above a pre-<lb/>defined volume of production, using a mechanism known as tapering payment. As a result, hospitals are<lb/> paid less for a case once a certain level of hospital activity has been reached. The main reason given to<lb/> justify these reductions is that economies of scale can be achieved within the hospital production system.<lb/> Above a pre-defined level of hospital activity, the hospital is deemed to have covered all fixed costs and<lb/> consequently should be paid only for its variable costs. An analysis of the economic literature will<lb/> illuminate this debate on economies of scale within the hospital sector and enable us to judge the merits of<lb/> this reduction in tariffs above a defined threshold of activity.<lb/></p>

			<head>ECONOMIES OF SCALE IN HOSPITALS: A LITERATURE REVIEW<lb/></head>

			<p>26.<lb/> Economies of scale can be observed in the production process in many industries. It refers to the<lb/> situation where average unit costs decrease with an increase in output. The extent to which economies of<lb/> scale can be generated depends on the cost structure of the industry. In industries that produce goods or<lb/> services involving huge capital investments, the fixed costs per unit of production is high and an additional<lb/> unit is relatively cheaper to produce, since only variable costs need to be taken into account. Consequently,<lb/> the average cost of production per unit falls with each additional unit produced within certain limitations.<lb/> 27.<lb/> Two approaches have been followed when analysing the existence of economies of scale in the<lb/> hospital sector: an accounting and an economic approach. The accounting approach consists in analysing<lb/> the cost structure of the production of services. However, this static approach must be complemented by a<lb/> dynamic analysis to take account of the existence of semi-variable costs, those costs which increase in<lb/> steps. The economic approach is based on a literature review of published studies that analyse the<lb/> existence of economies of scale in hospitals.<lb/> 28.<lb/> While the accounting approach and most of the published literature suggest that there are<lb/> economies of scale in the hospital sector, there are also articles, in some cases of questionable<lb/> methodology, that have highlighted diseconomies of scale in hospitals.<lb/></p>

			<figure>Accounting approach: identification of the proportion of fixed costs in hospital care production<lb/></figure>

			<head>Static approach: for some procedures, fixed costs represent the majority of production costs<lb/></head>

			<p>29.<lb/> <ref type="biblio">Busse et al. (2008)</ref> analysed the cost structure of ten different types of treatment across nine<lb/> European countries. Five of these procedures are performed as inpatient care in hospitals, namely<lb/> appendectomy, normal childbirth, hip replacement, the treatment of stroke and of acute myocardial<lb/> infarction (<ref type="table">Table 4</ref>).<lb/></p>

(2007).<lb/></table>

			<head>30.<lb/></head>

			<p>To collect pertinent data, a sample of at least five representative health care providers were<lb/> identified in the participating countries for the different case types of selected procedures (that is, at least<lb/> five hospitals for inpatient care). For the inpatient procedures, data from &quot; acute care general hospitals &quot;<lb/> with 200 to 400 beds was analysed, assuming this reflects the way the service is currently organised.<lb/> However, this method of selecting hospitals does not guarantee that the results given below are<lb/> representative across the board. The methodology used ensures that the costs in the selected hospitals are<lb/> measured consistently and that the results are comparable to a certain extent across different countries; but<lb/> a study based on a larger sample within a single country could give different results.<lb/> 31.<lb/> The costs of the different procedures were divided into five items: cost of diagnosis, cost of<lb/> hospital staff (nurses, doctors), costs associated with the surgical procedure (surgeon, anaesthetist, etc.),<lb/> and costs of pharmaceuticals and, finally, general expenses. The vast majority of general expenses are<lb/> made up of fixed costs for care production<lb/> 5 . These are the costs associated with medical and non-medical<lb/> infrastructure (administration, water, electricity, laundry services, buildings maintenance, etc.) and<lb/> depreciation costs.<lb/> 32.<lb/> The proportion accounted for by general expenses in the total cost of the selected procedures (hip<lb/> replacement, acute myocardial infarction, appendectomy and normal childbirth) varies from 23% in France<lb/> in the case of infarction to 64% in the case of childbirth. The proportion of general expenses in France is<lb/> close to the average of the other countries, for hip replacement and myocardial infarction. For<lb/> appendectomy and childbirth, general expenses in France are 10 and 17 percentage points respectively<lb/> higher than the average of the nine countries analysed in the study.<lb/></p>

			<head>5<lb/></head>

			<p>General expenses include non-medical infrastructure such as administrative staff, cleaning, gardening,<lb/> technical staff, buildings maintenance, power, water, tax and insurance (where this is part of patient<lb/> services), rent, depreciation costs for equipment and buildings, and financing costs. They also cover certain<lb/> medical infrastructure expenses such as laundry, sterilisation, patient transport (to hospital), catering and<lb/> the time spent on administration by the medical and nursing staff.<lb/></p>

			<figure>Figure 6: Proportion accounted for by general expenses in four inpatient procedures in France and averaged<lb/> over nine OECD member countries<lb/> Source: Busse et al. (2007).<lb/></figure>

			<p>33.<lb/> The fact that general expenses are such a large proportion of the total cost of hospital care<lb/> supports the hypothesis that economies of scale are possible in the hospital sector. For DRG-based<lb/> payment systems, a calculation of the average production cost over a sample of different hospitals is often<lb/> used when setting DRG tariffs. Thus, the high proportion of general expenses in the production cost of care<lb/> could justify a tapering scale for the fees associated with each treatment, once general expenses have been<lb/> covered. However, this static accounting approach is challenged when the hospital production system is<lb/> analysed dynamically.<lb/></p>

			<head>Dynamic approach: semi-variable expenses must be taken into account when calculating the cost<lb/> structure of hospitals<lb/></head>

			<p>34.<lb/> While a static approach to hospital production costs allows for a distinction to be made between<lb/> fixed and variable costs, the dynamic accounting model takes into account a third type: semi-variable costs.<lb/> The amount spent on semi-variable expenses varies with the amount of activity, though it is not<lb/> proportional to it. Thus, as production grows, the associated costs of these expenses may, for example,<lb/> increase in steps. This in turn entails marginal costs which change in steps.<lb/> 35.<lb/> The existence of semi-variable costs for hospital care is, partially, attributable to regulations<lb/> which stipulate that hospital capacity will rise as a function of the volume of production of care. As a result<lb/> of these regulations, the fact that variable and semi-variable charges increase as activity increases may<lb/> question the theory of a decreasing average cost of production. As production increases, the hospital may<lb/> indeed initially see its average cost of production fall; but beyond a certain production level the hospital<lb/> must reinvest in new equipment or take on new staff, which has the effect of a jump in production costs.<lb/> Consequently, marginal-cost pricing above a certain level of activity should be adapted to take into account<lb/> these steps in the level of semi-variable costs.<lb/> 36.<lb/> While the accounting approach sheds light on the existence of economies of scale by identifying<lb/> fixed and variable costs in the care production system, an analysis of the economic approach with reference<lb/> to a review of the literature that analyses the production function in hospitals complements this analysis.<lb/></p>

			<figure>Literature review of the economic studies relating to the existence of economies of scale in hospitals<lb/> 37.<lb/> The empirical literature has considered economies of scale in hospitals from two different angles.<lb/> Much of the literature has analysed the relationship between the size of hospitals and the cost of care<lb/> provided, trying to identify the optimum size of hospitals. A second approach, covered by much less<lb/> literature, has attempted to establish the relationship between the level of activity of hospitals and the cost<lb/> of care production. Here, the underlying question is how production costs change when the quantity of care<lb/> provided increases. Literature covering the second approach is relevant to explore marginal costs for care<lb/> beyond a certain level of activity.<lb/></figure>

			<p>38.<lb/> A literature review identified nine published studies assessing the relationship between the cost<lb/> of production and the quantity produced within the hospital sector. The majority of these studies focus on<lb/> the Unites States. In these studies, elasticities in the cost of production with respect to the quantity<lb/> produced have been calculated which served as a tool to measure the extent of economies of scale.<lb/></p>

			<head>Theoretical model and econometric models<lb/></head>

			<p>39.<lb/> A theoretical analysis of the firm production function requires the adoption of an explicit<lb/> hypothesis of the state of equilibrium within the enterprises of each sample analysed. If the enterprises are<lb/> considered to be on a long-term path, that is to say if the level of utilisation of inputs minimises costs,<lb/> taking into account the level of production and the cost of production factors, then we may base the<lb/> evaluation on a long-term cost function, in which total costs are expressed as a function of the quantities of<lb/> different outputs and the cost of inputs. On the other hand, the enterprises may not be in a position to<lb/> change the production factors as a whole quickly in response to changes in the production level or the cost<lb/> of production factors. Where this is the case, enterprises in this sector will, in the short term, aim to utilise<lb/> optimum quantities of the variable inputs which can easily be adjusted (such as workforce and equipment),<lb/> taking into account the levels of fixed inputs, even if these are not optimal (such as capital costs). In this<lb/> case, evaluation is based on a short-term production function. The variable cost function is then defined<lb/> using as parameters the level of outputs, the cost of inputs and the overall figure for fixed costs (<ref type="biblio">Vita,<lb/> 1990</ref>).<lb/> 40.<lb/> Most of the studies (six out of nine) assess a short-term production function for hospitals, taking<lb/> the capital costs as fixed in their analysis. In order to evaluate the cost functions, the studies take two<lb/> principal production functions which are flexible and linear, and which do not require hypotheses to be<lb/> applied to the production structure, as is for example the case with Cobb-Douglas production functions or<lb/> CES (constant elasticity of substitution). In this way, the studies apply the generalised Leontief production<lb/> function and the translog production function<lb/> 6 .<lb/> 41.<lb/> The variable discussed (dependent variable) in the econometric analyses is primarily the total<lb/> variable cost, which groups together the cost of labour and the cost of pharmaceuticals and medical<lb/> equipment&apos;s use. In this case, the total operating costs represent the variable cost to be identified (<ref type="biblio">Li et al.,<lb/> 2001</ref>).<lb/> 42.<lb/> For the explanatory variables, in most of the studies, the outputs used to characterise the<lb/> production function are the number of patient-days in hospital per annum. Vita (1990) considers separately<lb/> two variables: the number of discharges or admissions and the average length of stay in hospital. These<lb/> two variables allow a consideration of the two ways by which a hospital may increase the number of days<lb/> of care provided. In parallel, so that the impact of the different outputs on production costs may be<lb/> measured with precision, some studies make a distinction between the different services within hospital<lb/> production. Thus, for example in the study by <ref type="biblio">Cowing and Holtmann (1983)</ref>, hospital production is divided<lb/> into five diagnostic categories: medical-surgical, maternity, paediatrics, emergency room and other.<lb/> 43.<lb/> The price of inputs corresponds to salaries but also when they are available the prices of<lb/> medicines and medical devices. Most of the studies (six out of nine) categorise the salaries by<lb/> qualification. For example, <ref type="biblio">Cohen et al. (2008)</ref> make a distinction between the salaries of medical staff for<lb/> seven different expense items within the scope of care production, such as surgery, radiology and the<lb/> salaries of administrative staff. However, some studies do not have sufficient data to calculate salary levels<lb/> by hospital and by service. In this case, some studies use of a global salary index for the region in which<lb/> the hospital operates (<ref type="biblio">Carey, 2000, and Menke, 1997</ref>).<lb/> 44.<lb/> So that the heterogeneous nature of hospitals can be taken into account, additional explanatory<lb/> variables are applied to all the econometric analyses. First, the legal status of the hospital allows for<lb/> differences in cost between public, private for-profit and private not-for-profit hospitals to be taken into<lb/> account. Inclusion of this variable in particular can potentially verify the hypothesis that private for-profit<lb/> hospitals will bring about greater efficiency of production and hence lower costs (<ref type="biblio">Carey, 2000</ref>). Second,<lb/> the hospital case mix enables to account for differences in the severity of cases treated by hospitals which<lb/> could have an impact in particular on the equipment at the hospital but also on the qualifications of medical<lb/> staff (<ref type="biblio">Li et al., 2001</ref>). Finally, other variables which may have an impact on production costs are included,<lb/> such as the geographical location of the hospital, the university hospital status or the Herfindahl index, in<lb/> order to measure the level of competition faced by the hospital.<lb/></p>

			<head>Data used in studies<lb/></head>

			<p>45.<lb/> Most of the studies use administrative data to evaluate the cost functions of the hospitals. Five<lb/> out of nine studies use data from the different US States departments of health. For example, <ref type="biblio">Li et al.<lb/> (2001)</ref> utilise the annual data submitted by hospitals to the Washington State Department of Health. This<lb/> data includes details on the financial situation of each hospital and its activity. The other three American<lb/> studies take survey data either for a particular state (State of California in the case of <ref type="biblio">Vita, 1990</ref>) or the<lb/> whole of the United States (<ref type="biblio">Carey, 2000, and Menke, 1997</ref>). The latter two studies refer to the annual<lb/> survey by the American Hospital Association as a basic data source, which is supplemented with additional<lb/> data. For example, Menke (1997) adds to this survey data from the Bureau of the Census to obtain salaries<lb/> broken down by region.<lb/> 46.<lb/> The data used suffers from certain limitations, which mean that caution is necessary when<lb/> generalising from the results presented. Most of the studies use panel data for periods of between four to<lb/> seven years. In particular, panel data allows the heterogeneous nature of hospitals to be taken properly into<lb/> account and thus to obtain more robust evaluations. However, three of the studies refer only to a single<lb/> year (<ref type="biblio">Cowing et al., 1983, Vita, 1990, and Menke, 1997</ref>), which means that instead of observing the<lb/> evolution of costs of each hospital when its activity increases, they observe differences in costs between<lb/> hospitals with different levels of activity. It is thus possible that a bias exists, if the hospitals with greater<lb/> activity are hospitals that are systematically more (or less) efficient. Moreover, six out of the nine studies<lb/> use data relating to periods before 1990. Finally, three studies relate to a very small number of institutions.<lb/> <ref type="biblio">Cohen et al. (2010)</ref> refer to 30 hospitals in the State of Connecticut, and Cohen et al. (2011) refer to<lb/> 17 hospitals in Washington State. Small sample sizes may question the robustness of the results and<lb/> caution is needed when drawing any general conclusions from the results.<lb/></figure>

			<head>Results<lb/> 47.<lb/> Most</head>

			<p>of the studies find that there are economies of scale in the hospital sector. More precisely,<lb/> five out of the nine studies analysing economies of scale conclude that, if a hospital increases its activity,<lb/> the total costs associated increases less than proportionally to the increase in activity. The elasticity varies<lb/> between 0.62 (<ref type="biblio">Li et al., 2001</ref>) and 0.86 (<ref type="biblio">Cowing et al., 1987</ref>), which means that a 1% increase in activity<lb/> induces an increase in costs by 0.62% to 0.86%, all other things being equal.<lb/></p>

			<figure>48.<lb/> Three studies conclude that there are diseconomies of scale: Vita (1990), Smet (2006) and Cohen<lb/> et al. (2010). In these studies, the measured elasticity is on average 1.56, which means that an increase in<lb/> hospital activity by 1% brings about an increase of 1.56% of costs in the hospitals studied. These studies,<lb/> in particular those of Smet (2007) and Cohen et al (2011), suffer from some limitations. First, in the study<lb/> by Smet (2007), data relating to input costs and in particular salaries are not available. Thus, the author<lb/> does not include in his analysis the differences in salaries between hospitals or their impact on costs. This<lb/> limitation may create a bias in the results. It may, in fact, be assumed that there is a correlation, expected to<lb/> be positive, between salaries and quantity produced (i.e. a link between better salaries and higher<lb/> productivity). If this is true, the study overestimated the impact of activity on costs. The main limitation of<lb/> the study by Cohen et al. (2010) is the small number of hospitals 30 hospitals), which affects the precision<lb/> of estimates and generalizability of results.<lb/> Box 2. Efficiency in the hospital sector, economies of scope and influence of hospitals&apos; status on costs<lb/> The studies presented for the analysis of economies of scale also shed some light on two important<lb/> problematic areas related to the efficiency of production in the hospital sector.<lb/> First, studies analysing economies of scale also present results on economies of scope in the hospital<lb/> sector. An enterprise can generate economies of scope if it reduces its production costs by widening its range of<lb/> products and services (joint production). Diversification of production may take two different forms: related<lb/> diversification and conglomerate diversification. Related diversification refers to the development of new activities<lb/> that share some characteristics with existing activities. The diversification may be vertical or horizontal.<lb/> Conglomerate diversification refers to the development of new activities which have no common ground with<lb/> existing activities. Only economies of scope from related diversification seem to be appropriate in the hospital<lb/> sector.<lb/></figure>

			<p>From the studies that were analysed to explore the existence of economies of scale, and some additional<lb/> grey literature we have identified eight studies that deal with economies of scope within the hospital sector. Most<lb/> of these studies analyse economies of scope between inpatient and outpatient care <ref type="biblio">[Menke (1997)</ref>, <ref type="biblio">Wang et al.<lb/> (2006), Kristensen et al. (2012), Marini et al. (2009), Cohen et al. (2008)]</ref>. Only three studies identify economies<lb/> of scope within a hospital. <ref type="biblio">Cowing and Holtmann (1983)</ref> demonstrate the existence of economies of scope<lb/> between paediatric services and other services, and diseconomies of scope between emergency room services<lb/> and other services. <ref type="biblio">Kittelsen et al. (2009)</ref> identify important economies of scope between surgical and medical<lb/> services but no significant relationship between scheduled care and emergency care. <ref type="biblio">Smet (2007)</ref>, albeit with the<lb/> limitations suffered by this study, highlights economies of scope between internal medicine and surgical care, and<lb/> surgical care and specialised treatments.<lb/></p>

			<p>The second point illuminated by these various studies on hospital costs relates to the efficiency of public,<lb/> private not-for-profit and private for-profit hospitals. The conclusions of the different studies presented here are<lb/> ambiguous. Private for-profit hospitals have lower costs than not-for-profit hospitals, with a difference of around<lb/> 15% according to Cowing and Holtmann (1983) and around 5% according to <ref type="biblio">Vita (1990). Carey (2000)</ref> finds no<lb/> difference in cost as a function of the legal status of the hospital. <ref type="biblio">Finally, Menke (1997)</ref> shows that, among<lb/> independent hospitals, private for-profit and not-for-profit hospitals have higher costs, by 28.7% and 10.7%<lb/> respectively, than public hospitals. Menke (1997) does not find any difference in the costs of private hospitals that<lb/> are part of a group and public hospitals.<lb/> 49.<lb/> The study by <ref type="biblio">Cohen et al. (2010)</ref> suffers from a different bias, caused by a limited quantity of<lb/> data, since the study refers only to 30 hospitals, which has an effect on the precision of the evaluations<lb/> made and on the ability to generalise from the results.<lb/> 50.<lb/> In conclusion, there is some empirical evidence of the existence of economies of scale in<lb/> hospitals but it is not unambiguous.<lb/></p>

			<head>EXPERIENCES OF TAPERING PAYMENT SCALES IN FOUR OECD COUNTRIES<lb/></head>

			<p>51.<lb/> Six OECD member countries have introduced tapering payment, based on the assumption that<lb/> economies of scale exist within hospitals. These six countries are Germany, USA (State of Maryland), the<lb/> Czech Republic, Israel, Australia and Hungary. In order to describe the mechanisms in as much detail as<lb/> possible, four case studies have been carried out, based on available data and in-depth discussions with<lb/> experts: Germany, USA (State of Maryland), the Czech Republic and Israel. The aim of these case studies<lb/> is to explain the context of the introduction of this policy, the objectives and the technical details of the<lb/> tapering mechanism, but also to identify the impact of tapering payment on hospital activity. This section<lb/> presents these case studies. For each country, it first provides some contextual background and then<lb/> describes the tapering mechanism and its impact on hospital spending and activity.<lb/></p>

			<head>Germany<lb/> Basic facts of health system<lb/></head>

			<p>52.<lb/> Germany is a country where social health insurance has traditionally played a huge role in health<lb/> care coverage. In total, around 89% of the population is insured by one of the 134 statutory health<lb/> insurance funds. These are mainly funded through social contributions of employers and employees. The<lb/> remaining 11% are covered by primary private health insurance. Private coverage can be chosen by<lb/> employees earning more than around EUR 4 500 per month, self-employed, and civil servants regardless of<lb/> their income. Unlike protection under the statutory health insurance scheme, private health care coverage is<lb/> subject to individual insurance policies based on risk-related insurance premiums.<lb/> 53.<lb/> All statutory health insurance funds basically cover the same basket of health care goods and<lb/> services with a few exceptions. Health care services financed by private insurers can be more generous<lb/> depending on the insurance contract. Some contracts include supplementary insurance components for<lb/> items that are not covered under the public insurance (e.g. access to a single room in a hospital or treatment<lb/> by heads of departments for inpatient care). For outpatient specialist care, some studies showed faster<lb/> access to health professionals for people with private insurance compared to those with public coverage<lb/> (e.g. <ref type="biblio">Roll et al., 2012</ref>).<lb/> 54.<lb/> A key feature of the German health system is the decisive role of joint self-government of payers<lb/> and providers in the organisation of the system. The main body of the joint self-government is the Federal<lb/> Joint Committee (G-BA) which plays a key role in defining the pharmaceutical products, medical devices<lb/> and diagnostic and therapeutic procedures included under public coverage. The guidelines issued by the G-<lb/>BA are legally binding to insurers and care providers alike, i.e. physicians and hospitals. Moreover, the G-<lb/>BA has important responsibilities for measuring the quality of hospital and outpatient services. Unlike in<lb/> NHS-type systems, the role of the government in the German health system is mainly restricted to defining<lb/> the regulatory framework of health care provision and supervision of the system.<lb/></p>

			<head>Hospitals<lb/></head>

			<figure>55.<lb/> The high number of beds is one of the defining features of the hospital sector in Germany. There<lb/> are 8.3 beds per 1 000 population, ranking Germany third among OECD countries. The average number of<lb/> beds in OECD countries is 4.9 per 1 000 population. There has been a 10% drop in bed capacity between<lb/> 2000 and 2011 in Germany compared to an average reduction of 5% in OECD countries.<lb/></figure>

			<p>56.<lb/> The majority of beds in Germany are provided by private hospitals (either for-profit or non-for-<lb/>profit) at 59%, compared to 27% on average in the OECD. 64% of all hospital beds are allocated to<lb/> curative care, 15% to psychiatric care and 21% to rehabilitative care.<lb/> 57.<lb/> The volume of hospital activity in Germany is well above most other OECD countries. The<lb/> number of discharges per 1 000 population in Germany is 55% higher than the OECD average (240<lb/> compared to 155). However, hospital spending as a share of total health expenditure in Germany is around<lb/> the OECD average (29%).<lb/> 58.<lb/> There is a clear separation in the provision of inpatient and outpatient health care in the German<lb/> health system. Apart from a few targeted activities (emergencies and complex treatments for cancer, rare<lb/> diseases, etc.), hospitals are legally not allowed to provide outpatient services.<lb/></p>

			<head>Hospital payments in Germany<lb/> Main features of DRG-based payment<lb/></head>

			<p>59.<lb/> Around 80% of all hospitals revenues stem from DRG payments (<ref type="biblio">Busse et al., 2011</ref>). The DRG<lb/> tariffs received by hospitals are calculated by multiplying relative weights with a base rate. The relative<lb/> weights are set nationwide; the base rates differ at a Länder-level.<lb/> 60.<lb/> Payment by DRG was gradually introduced into Germany from 2003 onwards. It applies to<lb/> public and private hospitals alike, whether profit-making or not, using the same DRG catalogue and<lb/> relative weights. There is also no difference in the use of DRGs between patients covered under public or<lb/> private insurance. Remuneration via DRGs applies to medical, surgical and obstetric treatments, including<lb/> day cases. Patients are classified into one DRG on the basis of a patient&apos;s diagnosis, the medical<lb/> procedures provided and patient characteristics (age, gender and new-born weight, length of stay, duration<lb/> of ventilation, reason for hospital discharge and type of admission). A new prospective payment for<lb/> inpatient psychiatric treatment (different per diem rates depending on patient characteristics and<lb/> procedures) is currently under development. Additional payments not incorporated in DRG tariffs are<lb/> made for the use of costly medications or medical devices and innovative treatments.<lb/> 61.<lb/> Depreciation is not included in the calculation of DRG-based payments because of the historic<lb/> split in hospital financing in Germany. Current expenses are financed by public and private insurers (now<lb/> mainly via DRG), whereas capital expenses are funded directly by the German Länder. Consequently, the<lb/> calculation of the cost of a treatment group does not take account for capital investment. However, in<lb/> practice, 50% of investments in hospitals are funded from sources other than the Länder (e.g. via credits or<lb/> from hospital&apos;s own income) (See Deutsches <ref type="biblio">Krankenhausinstitut, 2010</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<head>Relative weights<lb/></head>

			<p>62.<lb/> The DRG catalogue comprises 1196 groups in 2014. It is negotiated annually between the federal<lb/> hospital association (DKG) and the federal organisations of health insurance funds (GKV) and private<lb/> health insurance companies (PKV). The German Institute for the Hospital Remuneration System (Institut<lb/> für das Entgeltsystem im Krankenhaus – InEK) calculates the relative weight of each DRG item based on<lb/> cost-intensiveness of the resources used. For this calculation, InEK receives data from 253 hospitals (15%<lb/> of all general hospitals) to help draw up the scale. The weight for the benchmark treatment group is<lb/> 1 point. The weights for the other treatment groups are calculated with reference to the benchmark group.<lb/></p>

			<head>Base rate<lb/></head>

			<p>63.<lb/> The relevant base rate for the remuneration of hospitals is negotiated at Länder level, taking into<lb/> account a theoretical-base rate set at the federal level, as a point of reference.<lb/> 64.<lb/> At the federal level, the hospital association agrees annually with the organisations of statutory<lb/> health insurers and private insurers on a federal base rate taking into account calculations carried out by<lb/> InEK based on the past base rates in Länder, the effective case mix and total spending, as well as growth in<lb/> total salaries – reflecting the increase of available financial resources of health insurance funds – and an<lb/> index value reflecting changes for costs of staff and equipment in hospitals. The result of these negotiations<lb/> is the monetary value of the federal base rate.<lb/></p>

			<figure>65.<lb/> In the 16 Länder, regional associations of hospitals and insurers negotiate the regional base rates.<lb/> Factors to be taken into account in these negotiations include the projected development of costs, potential<lb/> efficiency savings, and the prospective change in number and severity of cases (case-mix). Having said<lb/> that, some restrictions in the Länder negotiations apply: Since 2014 Länder base rates must lie within a<lb/> band between +2.5% and -1.25% of the federal base rate 7 . Additionally, the annual increases in the base<lb/> rates at Länder level cannot exceed the increase of the federal base rate.<lb/> 66.<lb/> In most of the Länder (9 of the 16), the negotiations in 2014 resulted in a Länder base rate below<lb/> the minimum value of the band. Consequently, these Länder base rates had to be raised to reach this<lb/> threshold.<lb/></figure>

			<head>Hospital revenue budgets<lb/></head>

			<p>67.<lb/> The DRG-payment per case is in general defined by the relative weight of the DRG and the<lb/> Länder base rate but an important element affecting the final payment is related to the individual hospital<lb/> revenue budget. All hospitals need to negotiate case-mix-based target &quot; revenue budgets &quot; with insurers on<lb/> an annual basis. The negotiations involve all insurers that represent at least a 5% share of the hospital&apos;s<lb/> patients; other insurers must accept the results of the negotiation. The main outcome of these negotiations<lb/> is an agreed volume in terms of case-mix for each hospital for the calendar year. In combination with the<lb/> DRG relative weights, this defines the revenue budget. There are two situations related to the revenue<lb/> budgets -explained below -where hospitals do not receive the full DRG tariff for the treatment of the<lb/> patient but only a reduced rate.<lb/></p>

			<head>The tapering system<lb/></head>

			<figure>Technical considerations<lb/> 68.<lb/> In Germany two separate mechanisms exist to reduce the hospital tariffs per case within the DRG<lb/> framework. The first type of tapering rate is applied to additional negotiated hospital volumes; the second<lb/> is applied to all volume beyond the negotiated revenue budget, i.e. the non-negotiated volume.<lb/>  Any increase in activity volume (based on the case-mix) compared to year t-1 within the range of<lb/> negotiated volumes for year t is reimbursed at rate tapered by 25% (rate in force in 2013 and<lb/> 2014) 8 . This mechanism is known as the Mehrleistungsabschlag 9 or MLA.<lb/> 7<lb/> Exceptions apply to those Länder who have been historically above this band; their base rates are only<lb/> gradually reduced to finally reach the upper limit of the corridor.<lb/>  Hospitals have to pay back 65% of all revenue related to activity exceeding the negotiated<lb/> volume. This means hospitals can only keep 35% of these additional revenues. This mechanism<lb/> is known as the Mehrerlösausgleich 10 or MEA. As a counterbalance for the tapering rate, all<lb/> negotiated services which could not be delivered are paid by insurers at a rate of 20%.<lb/> 69.<lb/> An overview of the technical application of the two rates is displayed in Chart 1. For MLA, the<lb/> tapered rate changed continually between 2009 and 2014. In 2009 -the year of its introduction -the rate<lb/> was negotiated for each Land separately, averaging out at 24%. Tapering was abandoned for negotiated<lb/> volumes in 2010 but reintroduced in 2011 with a tapered rate of 30%. The rate was again negotiated in<lb/> 2012, and in 2013 and 2014 it was set at 25%. Moreover, the benchmark year for calculating additional<lb/> volumes in 2013 and 2014 was 2012.<lb/> 9<lb/> Literally &quot; reduction for increased services &quot; .<lb/> 10<lb/> Literally &quot; compensation for surplus &quot; .<lb/> DELSA/HEA/WD/HWP(2015)1<lb/> 34<lb/> Chart 1: Hospital payments in Germany<lb/> 70.<lb/> The first level of tapering (MLA) is applicable to all DRGs with some exceptions. In practical<lb/> terms, the monetary value of the MLA is only known after the negotiation of hospital volumes and the<lb/> MLA translates into a percentage reduction of all DRGs billed to insurers after the negotiated volume is<lb/> agreed on. Some negotiated additional services are exempt from this reduction, for example, in the case of<lb/> transplants, volume growth that is based on increases in hospital capacity, DRGs where material costs<lb/> account for more than two-thirds of the total cost, and in hardship cases.<lb/> 71.<lb/> The MEA applies to the non-negotiated volume; 65% of all revenues exceeding the revenue<lb/> budget which is based on the negotiated volume have to be reimbursed by hospitals. But some exceptions<lb/> also apply, for example, for additional revenues generated from treatment of severely injured patients; in<lb/> these cases, a 25% reduction is applied which means that hospitals can keep 75% of the additional<lb/> revenues.<lb/> Rationale for introduction<lb/> 72.<lb/> Tapering payment in Germany was introduced in 1985 in Germany, before DRG-based<lb/> payments, when hospitals were still paid through per-diem rates. During that period, payments for<lb/> additional treatments which resulted in revenues in excess of the negotiated budgeted revenue had to be<lb/> partially reimbursed by the hospital. The reduction was justified by economies of scale in hospital<lb/> production. This assumption, however, does not seem to have been based on empirical evidence at that<lb/> time. It was argued that fixed costs of hospitals were already completely covered with payments generated<lb/> within the negotiated hospital budget; payment for additional cases would therefore only have to reflect<lb/> variable costs. By the same reasoning, hospitals received partial payments for the non-generated cases that<lb/> fell short of the negotiated volumes. These compensations were introduced to give hospital managers some<lb/> financial security for partial coverage of their fixed costs in case of an unexpected shortfall in demand for<lb/> inpatient services. This mechanism was called &quot; flexible budgeting &quot; (Tuschen at al., 2005).<lb/> 73.<lb/> The principle concept of this tapering mechanism was maintained when hospital remuneration<lb/> moved towards DRG payments from 2003 on and is still applicable.<lb/> 74.<lb/> A second type of tapering – the MLA – was introduced in 2009 which is applied to all additional<lb/> negotiated hospital volume which is above the volume of the previous year. Although introduced later than<lb/> the tapering for non-negotiated revenue, it can technically be considered as the 1 st level of tapering.<lb/> Tapering rates and technical modalities of this 1 st level have been constantly changing since its<lb/> implementation. The aim of tapering for negotiated volumes has been subject to change since its<lb/> introduction in 2009. Whereas the initial objective was to limit growth in hospital expenditure 11 -in 2011<lb/> and 2012 the MLA was supposed to generate savings by 350 Mio EUR and 270 Mio EUR respectively -<lb/>controlling the increase in hospital volumes eventually became the objective in 2013 and 2014 12 .<lb/></figure>

			<head>Evaluation of effectiveness<lb/></head>

			<p>75.<lb/> It is difficult to assess the effectiveness of the mechanisms as the aim of their introduction<lb/> changed over time.<lb/> 76.<lb/> The MLA was first introduced to limit hospital spending growth and later to disincentivise<lb/> increases in hospital volume. While the MLA did reduce spending growth to some extent in the years after<lb/> its inception, the savings would only equate to around 0.5% of total hospital costs. For the years 2013 and<lb/> 2014 the savings generated via the MLA were redistributed to hospitals through an increase of the base<lb/> rate. Otherwise, this base rate would have decreased as a result of an increase in activity, penalising all<lb/> hospitals, including those with no or low activity increase.<lb/> 77.<lb/> <ref type="table">Table 6</ref> shows a slowdown in the annual growth of the case-mix-volume since the introduction of<lb/> MLA in 2009 which hospitals could put forward as a proof of the positive impact of the tapering<lb/> mechanism on the reduction in volume growth. The remaining increase in hospital activity would be<lb/> triggered by medical necessity. However, health insurers would argue that this growth is still above the<lb/> increase that would be expected purely based on the demographic development (<ref type="biblio">Augurzky, 2012</ref>). From<lb/> their point of view, hospitals still have an incentive to negotiate high additional volumes in their budgets<lb/> because the reduced rate of payment (25%) would only be applied for one year (two years in 2014) and<lb/> would be fully remunerated in the following year and would thus only be a weak deterrent for excessive<lb/> volume expansion.<lb/></p>

			<p>78.<lb/> The payment reduction of MEA for non-negotiated hospital volume is much harsher (65%) but it<lb/> does not seem to be applied at a grand scale. The tapering rate is considered high enough to discourage any<lb/> additional hospital activity beyond this point with the exception of emergency treatments. One of the<lb/> reasons for the limited application can be found in the delayed timeline of the negotiating process of the<lb/> hospital budgets. Although in theory, hospital budgets should be negotiated prospectively for a calendar<lb/> year, it is not unusual for them to begin in September of the current year. By this time, hospitals can<lb/> already project pretty accurately the hospital activity they will perform until December. The risk of<lb/> providing more than the negotiated volume -and thus having to pay the MEA-is therefore reduced. The<lb/> late hospital budget negotiations can partly be explained by delayed negotiations for the Länder base rate<lb/> which is a crucial element for the budget negotiation process.<lb/></p>

The study proposes to<lb/> link the MLA with quality measures. Moreover, MLA should be more targeted to specific conditions. For<lb/> emergency treatments, such as in case of heart failure, the MLA should not be applied. Consequently, it<lb/> would then focus more on those treatments for which the strict medical necessity seems sometimes to be<lb/> more controversial (e.g. such a knee and hip replacements). The study encourages further research on the<lb/> consequence of the MLA as its impact on hospital activity and quality is still unknown.<lb/></p>

			<figure>Maryland (United States) 13<lb/> Basic facts of health system<lb/> 80.<lb/> The United States is one of the few OECD countries where public coverage of health care costs is<lb/> relatively low. The majority of Americans have private insurance that either they or their employer have<lb/> taken out. In the State of Maryland in 2013, 73.6% of the population had this type of cover compared to<lb/> 64.2% in the United States as a whole. 14<lb/> 81.<lb/> The government manages the two principal public insurance schemes for low-income groups<lb/> (Medicaid and Medicare). Medicare is a federal programme for residents over 65 years of age, the disabled<lb/> and people with terminal-stage kidney disease. Medicaid, a state-based programme, covers people with<lb/> low incomes. In Maryland, 14.4% (compared to 15.6% for the United States as a whole) of the population<lb/> were insured by Medicare and 15.3% (17.3% for the US as a whole) by Medicaid. These programmes are<lb/> funded through taxation, but the beneficiaries are not covered automatically: they must sign up and, in<lb/> some circumstances, pay premiums.<lb/> 82.<lb/> A substantial proportion of the entire population of the US, estimated at around 14.5% in 2013,<lb/> had no health insurance; the figure for Maryland was 10.2% (Smith and Medalia, 2014). The Affordable<lb/> Care Act adopted in 2010 seeks to gradually extend health insurance coverage, which has been compulsory<lb/> for all citizens and legal residents since January 2014. From that date, anyone who does not have sickness<lb/> insurance may be subject to a fine. 15<lb/> 83.<lb/> Private insurance coverage is heavily concentrated in Maryland as the insurer Carefirst has 66%<lb/> of the &quot; individual cover &quot; market, 73% of the small business market 16 and 70% of the large business<lb/> market.<lb/> 84.<lb/> In 2009, the share of the gross domestic product of Maryland allocated to health expenditure<lb/> matched that of the United States, i.e. 15%. Annual growth in health expenditure in the State of Maryland<lb/> was equivalent to that of the whole of the United States between 1991 and 2009; for Maryland, the annual<lb/> growth was 6.6% compared to 6.5% for the United States as a whole.<lb/> 85.<lb/> In 2009, per capita health expenditure was 10% higher in Maryland than in the United States as a<lb/> whole (USD 7 492 compared to USD 6 815). Several possible explanations for this include higher care<lb/> costs and a larger population covered by health insurance than the United States average.<lb/> 13<lb/> Unless otherwise stated, the statistics used for Maryland and the United States have been taken from the<lb/> Kaiser Family Foundation database (http://kff.org/).<lb/></figure>

			<table>Hospitals<lb/> 86.<lb/> In 2009, hospital expenditure<lb/> 17 in Maryland matched that for the United States (37% and 36%<lb/> respectively), accounting for 5.5% of gross domestic product in the State of Maryland and the United<lb/> States.<lb/></table>

			<p>87.<lb/> Total per capita expenditure for hospital services is 12% higher in Maryland than for the whole<lb/> of the United States. The total cost of hospital treatment requiring at least one night as an inpatient is<lb/> USD 2 368 per day in Maryland compared to USD 1 960 in the United States (<ref type="figure">Figure 7</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<p>92.<lb/> The way hospitals are paid in the United States generally differs according to the different payers.<lb/> For Medicare this is typically DRG-based but along with a number of other states, Maryland obtained a<lb/> waiver which permitted them to implement an alternative payment system in its dealings with Medicare 23 .<lb/> The same year, in 1977, Maryland went a step further and implemented an all-payer model which means<lb/> that all insurance schemes have to apply the same payment system. Hospital tariffs are determined by the<lb/> Health Services Cost Review Commission (HSCRC) 24 for all hospitals and are not negotiated between<lb/> 23<lb/></p>

			<p>In the mid-70s, Medicare was keen to experiment with new forms of hospital payment. Maryland and a few<lb/> other States (New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts, West Virginia and Washington) applied for waivers<lb/> from the national Medicare and Medicaid system so that they could instead put in place their own state-<lb/>devised systems to cover the categories of population insured by Medicare and Medicaid. Maryland was<lb/> the first State to obtain that waiver in 1977.<lb/></p>

			<p>Since its establishment, the HSCRC has been thoroughly independent. From a legal point of view, it is<lb/> accountable to the state governor and not the US Secretary of Health. Consequently, the Health Department<lb/> has only a limited degree of administrative control over it (mainly linked to personnel). Additionally, the<lb/> HSCRC has economic independence because it is funded by a surcharge on the hospital tariffs paid by<lb/> insurers. Finally, it is governed by a board of seven delegates who must agree to sit on a voluntary basis.<lb/> The principal task of the HSCRC was to study and approve inpatient tariffs. In doing so, the HSCRC is<lb/> required to ensure that the total costs of all services provided by a hospital are reasonable, that the<lb/></p>

			<p>93.<lb/> The decisive factor for hospital payment is the approved revenue budget. The revenue budget is,<lb/> theoretically, the product of the pre-defined allowed total charges per case and the different cases<lb/> (classified in DRG). The allowed total charge per case is calculated by the HSCRC. To do this the HSCRC<lb/> sets a unit rate per cost item for each hospital. There are around 50 cost items per hospital. Examples of<lb/> cost items are intensive-care units, operating theatres, radiology, emergency departments, clinical<lb/> laboratories, etc.<lb/></p>

			<figure>94.<lb/> In order to set unit rates per cost item, the HSCRC collects detailed data on costs using an<lb/> accounting system that assesses costs based on activity and allocates direct and indirect costs to each<lb/> revenue item. Hospitals are required to supply data on costs if they want to be eligible for reimbursement<lb/> under Medicare. The data make it possible to calculate costs by day for each cost centre.<lb/> 95.<lb/> The unit rates are then adjusted to take account of the diversity of patients in each hospital<lb/> notably on the basis of the location of the hospital and the proportion of patients from each ethnic group.<lb/> They also take labour market differences into account. The allowed total charges per case (tariff) is the<lb/> sum of the product of the unit rates and the units used for each cost item involved in the treatment process<lb/> of one case. So tariffs for the Johns Hopkins Hospital, a teaching hospital based in Baltimore, Maryland,<lb/> are not the same as those for a rural hospital. There is also a fund to mutualise the costs of care provided to<lb/> uninsured patients. This fund reimburses hospitals for such treatment.<lb/></figure>

			<p>96.<lb/> The unit rates of inpatient activities in all hospitals are updated every year. The update factor is<lb/> dependent on several key elements. First, the HSCRC uses an indicator that reflects the rise in the costs of<lb/> factors of production published by Medicare, known as the market basket index. Then, the Commission<lb/> has discretion to increase the update factor in order to boost hospitals&apos; profitability, for example, to<lb/> encourage capital investment, or to reduce that factor in line with assumed productivity gains in the<lb/> hospital sector or to comply with the constraints associated with the Medicare waiver test. The update<lb/> factor is the same for all hospitals, although certain programmes can influence the final update factor that<lb/> the hospital will enjoy (<ref type="biblio">Murray, 2014</ref>). Consequently, the allowed total charges per case change every year<lb/> reflecting the change in the different unit rates.<lb/></p>

			<head>Hospital revenue budgets<lb/></head>

			<p>97.<lb/> As discussed, the decisive factor for hospital managers is the revenue budget defined by the total<lb/> number of cases (classified into DRG) and the allowed total charges per case based on the different unit<lb/> rates for the different cost centres. The unit rate system is very disaggregated, and the cost-centre approach<lb/> makes it similar to a fee-for-service system. When the HSCRC tried to constrain growth in hospital costs<lb/> by capping the update factor of the several unit rates, hospitals were able to increase their income by<lb/> increasing cost centre volume (more tests, longer inpatient stays, etc.).<lb/> 98.<lb/> The HSCRC retained the unit rate structure but it enforced a DRG 25 constraint on hospital<lb/> revenues. Each hospital has a target amount of revenue per DRG (allowed total charges) summed up for all<lb/> DRGs that it can earn during the course of a year. It charges tariffs for all patients but it has to monitor<lb/> hospital&apos;s overall receipts are reasonably in line with its total costs and that its tariffs are fairly distributed<lb/> across all hospital service purchasers.<lb/></p>

			<head>25<lb/></head>

			<p>Each hospital admission is grouped into one of 320 &quot; All Patient Refined Diagnosis Related Groups &quot; (APR-<lb/>DRGs) that classify patients into clinically cohesive categories based on their medical condition and the<lb/> severity of their illness. The 320 APR-DRGs are separated into four &quot; severity of illness &quot; levels.<lb/> how it is doing on average relative to these DRG constraints. It can do this in an aggregate way by<lb/> monitoring its overall case mix adjusted charge per case. If it is over the pre-established target case mix<lb/> adjusted charge per case established for it, it must lower its allowed total charges during the year to come<lb/> back into compliance. It does so because the HSCRC can assess very large penalties for over-charging.<lb/> 99.<lb/> Hospitals are not required to invoice by unit rate or by treatment episode at the rates set by the<lb/> HSCRC. For any care episode, a hospital can set its own tariffs to better reflect its actual use of resources<lb/> and production costs in a particular case. However, at the end of the year, the hospital is required to invoice<lb/> insurers for the total authorised budget equal to the product of the fixed charge per care episode and the<lb/> case mix. To do so, the hospital must offset any overbilling compared to HSCRC charges by invoicing for<lb/> a lower price over the year per cost centre or by lowering the resources used. The tolerance for change in<lb/> unit rates must be between ±5% of unit rates set by the HSCRC.<lb/></p>

			<head>Tapering payment or variable cost factor (VCF) in the State of Maryland<lb/> Technical considerations<lb/></head>

			<p>100.<lb/> Tapering payment was introduced alongside DRG-based payments in hospitals in 1977. There is<lb/> no difference in the way tapering is applied to the various types of inpatient services. At the same time,<lb/> hospital representatives are able to apply for exemptions especially if they open new operating theatres or<lb/> make new capital investments.<lb/> 101.<lb/> Although the conclusions from empirical assessments of hospitals&apos; cost structure to identify<lb/> economies of scale are somewhat unclear, the HSCRC was convinced that, in a large hospital, variable<lb/> costs could be as high as 50% or even 60%. Consequently, Maryland implemented a tapering payment<lb/> called variable cost factor (VCF). Any increase in activity beyond the revenue budgets is now billed at<lb/> 50% of the tariff in force for hospitals under this system. In addition to tapering, set at a rate of 50%, this<lb/> system imposes two further constraints on hospital volumes, namely the volume governor and the case-mix<lb/> governor. The former restricts growth in hospital volumes to 2% per year. The latter restricts growth in<lb/> hospital case mix in 2014 to 0.5%.<lb/> 102.<lb/> Over the year, hospitals must measure trends in volumes and the impact that tapering payment<lb/> might have on those trends in terms of their tariffs and final income. They must try to adjust their unit rates<lb/> or the intensity of services for a treatment during the year under way. Hospitals have an information<lb/> system to help them adjust their tariffs and to keep them, most of the time, close to the final tariffs once<lb/> tapering has been taken into account and, therefore, close to the authorised revenue. In the event of a<lb/> difference, the allowed total charges are adjusted downwards or upwards the following year.<lb/> 103.<lb/> From a dynamic point of view, where changes over time are concerned, revenue authorised for<lb/> year t+1 before tapering payment can be applied is defined in two ways:<lb/></p>

			<p> Where activity increases compared to the revenue authorised in t: the revenue authorised for<lb/> year t+1 equals the revenue authorised by the HSCRC in t plus the share of variable costs<lb/> engendered by the increase in activity. Thus, if a hospital had an authorised revenue of 100 in t<lb/> and records a revenue of 110 in t+1, then the authorised revenue for year t+1 equals 100 plus the<lb/> share of variable costs linked to the 10 points of supplementary revenue i.e. 6 where the VCF is<lb/> 60%.<lb/></p>

			<p> Where activity falls compared to the revenue authorised in t: the revenue authorised for year t+1<lb/> is equal to the receipts registered in t, plus the fixed costs engendered by the receipts that should<lb/> have been received in t. So, if a hospital had an authorised income of 100 in t and records a<lb/> revenue of 90, the revenue authorised for year t+1 is equal to 90 plus the share of fixed costs<lb/> linked to authorised revenue of 100 i.e. 4 where the VCF is 60%.<lb/></p>

			<head>Rationale behind the tapering system<lb/></head>

			<p>104.<lb/> The rationale behind the introduction of the variable cost factor (VCF) was to capture the<lb/> marginal revenue from rising hospital volumes.<lb/> 105.<lb/> From 1977, hospitals received only 50% of the tariff set by the HSRC for any incremental<lb/> increase in volumes above the activity cap. Tapering payment neutralised any incentive to increase<lb/> activity. However, tapering is not only a means of regulating volume growth. It can also protect hospitals<lb/> against dips in activity. If hospital volumes fell, the hospital received 50% of the amount of the drop in<lb/> volume so that it could cover its fixed costs.<lb/> 106.<lb/> In the early 1990s, the HSCRC gradually reduced regulation of hospital volumes through<lb/> tapering scales. So as to allow hospitals to generate greater revenue and increase their profitability,<lb/> tapering scales were abolished for certain hospitals (Johns Hopkins and University of Maryland, the two<lb/> major teaching hospitals) and were fixed at 15% for the rest. The 15% rate was determined so that<lb/> hospitals could generate greater receipts and thus increase their profitability. Additionally, the fall in the<lb/> rate was intended to allow hospitals to implement investment policies.<lb/></p>

			<figure>107.<lb/> Between 2001 and 2008, tapering payment was abolished with the hope that managed care could<lb/> help containing costs. A significant growth in volumes was observed in Maryland between 2001 and 2008.<lb/></figure>

			<p>In response to that increase, the tapering payment system was reintroduced with the scales again at the<lb/> levels they were in the 1980s.<lb/></p>

			<head>Evaluation of effectiveness<lb/></head>

			<p>108.<lb/> Firstly, hospitals have altered the way they manage their activities as a result of tapering so as to<lb/> remedy the unintended effects of self-employment by practitioners who are paid through a fee-for-service<lb/> mechanism. Indeed, physicians, especially surgeons, have a vested interest in increasing services because<lb/> their income is a function of the services they deliver. At the same time, hospitals must comply with the<lb/> constraints imposed by tapering. Thus hospitals have established teams responsible for risk management<lb/> within their hospitals to control self-employed practitioners&apos; activities. These controls cover, in particular,<lb/> the relevance of treatments delivered by health professionals and the average length of an inpatient stay.<lb/> 109.<lb/> Secondly, the rise in hospital volumes after the abolition of tapering in 2001 hints that tapering<lb/> has had an effect at least on hospital volume. <ref type="biblio">Kalman (2014)</ref> shows</p>

			<figure>a significant increase in the volume of<lb/> inpatient admissions, outpatient visits and operating costs following the abolition of tapering between 2001<lb/> and 2008. Once tapering was removed in 2001, admissions and outpatient consultations rose by 7.7% and<lb/> 17.1% respectively – a significant increase compared to the preceding years. The yearly rate of growth in<lb/> admissions rose significantly when tapering was abolished, from 0.8% between 1991 and 2001 to 2.4%<lb/> between 2001 and 2008. Similarly, hospital operating costs rose relatively sharply: the annual growth rate<lb/> for operating costs increased from 4.8% between 1991 and 2001 to 8.4% between 2001 and 2008. Costs<lb/> therefore grew more quickly than volumes. This study shows that hospitals react to changes in financial<lb/> incentives. Kalman&apos;s study (2014) concludes that tapering can act as a model to constrain growth both in<lb/> hospital volumes and in costs within the hospital sector.<lb/> 110.<lb/> However, the sharp growth in hospital volumes (admissions, readmissions, emergency visits,<lb/> outpatient care) over the period 2001 to 2008 led the HSCRC to introduce several plans to change the way<lb/> hospitals were paid in recent years. These included: progressive switch to global budgets for hospital<lb/> payment; reintroduction of the tapering system; and performance-based payments for hospitals.<lb/></figure>

			<p>111.<lb/> To date, 93% of hospitals are remunerated under a global budget system. The tapering payment<lb/> system therefore now applies only to 7% of hospitals. The fact that so few hospitals opted for tapering<lb/> payment over the global budget system can be explained by the very tight restrictions on hospital activities<lb/> for hospitals that choose tapering.<lb/> 112.<lb/> The reason behind the decision to promote the global budget system is that it seeks to exercise<lb/> stricter control over the growth in hospital volumes and thereby ensure that growth in hospital costs<lb/> matches growth in Maryland&apos;s wealth. In the past, growth in hospital costs have been 2 to 3 points higher<lb/> than growth in the State&apos;s wealth. This meant sharp growth in health expenditure as a share of GDP from<lb/> 7% in 1970 to 15% today. The HSCRC is attempting to rein in growth in per capita spending to match the<lb/> growth in GDP in Maryland over the past 10 years, namely 3.58%. That is now the cap on growth in the<lb/> hospital sector.<lb/></p>

			<head>Czech Republic<lb/> Basic facts of the health system<lb/></head>

			<p>113.<lb/> Mandatory health insurance was introduced in 1991 in the Czech Republic (<ref type="biblio">Kinkorová et al.,<lb/> 2012</ref>). All permanent residents in the Czech Republic are entitled to health care coverage, while<lb/> non-permanent residents are also covered if they are working for a Czech employer (<ref type="biblio">Bryndová et al.,<lb/> 2009</ref>). Residents who are not in these two situations must take out private insurance to cover their care<lb/> costs. The benefit basket includes outpatient consultations, analyses and diagnoses, inpatient stays,<lb/> rehabilitation, transport and preventive care (<ref type="biblio">Kinkorová et al., 2012</ref>).<lb/> 114.<lb/> To receive these services, permanent residents must sign up with one of the seven social health<lb/> insurance funds. Residents are free to choose the insurer and may change insurer each year. In 2008,<lb/> however, only 2.1% of the insured population chose to change insurer because competition between the<lb/> various providers is poor (<ref type="biblio">Bryndová et al., 2009</ref>). Risk selection by insurers on contracts for basic services<lb/> is not permitted.<lb/> 115.<lb/> There are two sources of funding for social health insurance funds: social contributions from<lb/> employers and employees (76%) and state contributions for inactive insured persons (24%).<lb/></p>

			<head>Hospitals<lb/></head>

			<figure>116.<lb/> Hospital costs in the Czech Republic were lower than the OECD average in 2011 at 2.3% of GDP<lb/> compared to 2.6%. However, the volume of activity in the Czech Republic is 30% greater than the OECD<lb/> average in terms of numbers of admissions per 1 000 population.<lb/> 117.<lb/> Hospital services are funded principally by social security, which funds 94% of hospital costs,<lb/> while the general government funds 3%. Private insurance and direct payments from households each<lb/> account for 3% of funding for hospital costs. Private out-of-pocket expenditure in the Czech Republic is<lb/> defined by a co-payment of EUR 4 per day.<lb/> 118.<lb/> Hospital capacity in the Czech Republic is among the largest in the OECD countries. With<lb/> 6.8 beds per 1 000 population, the Czech Republic ranks seventh in the OECD and is above the OECD<lb/> average (4.9 beds per 1 000 population). However, the number of beds fell sharply between 2000 and 2011<lb/> in the Czech Republic (down by 10%), which compares with a 5% reduction on average across the OECD<lb/> over the same period.<lb/></figure>

			<p>119.<lb/> Public hospitals are the main suppliers, with 86% of beds, compared to an OECD average of<lb/> 73%. The central and regional governments own and manage most public hospitals. Except for cases of<lb/> emergency, a patient must choose a hospital that has a contract with his insurer. In practice, all insurance<lb/> funds have contracts with the main hospitals, and there are therefore few restrictions.<lb/> 120.<lb/> There is no explicit regulatory system in the Czech Republic governing how provision of hospital<lb/> services are organised. For government-owned public hospitals, however, the authorities control changes in<lb/> hospital bed capacity and investment in expensive technologies. There is also an intrinsic limitation for the<lb/> expansion of hospital capacity by the requirements for hospitals to have contracts with insurers. Insurers<lb/> therefore have the power to restrict unjustified capacity expansion.<lb/></p>

			<head>Hospital payments in the Czech Republic<lb/> Main features of the DRG payment system<lb/></head>

			<figure>121.<lb/> According to Ministry of Health estimates, 80% of hospital receipts for medical, surgical and<lb/> obstetric care come from DRG-based payments. The remaining 20% of hospitals&apos; revenue relate to other<lb/> activities and are subject to bilateral agreements between insurers and hospitals.<lb/> 122.<lb/> Until 2007, the principal means of payment for hospitals was a global budget system. In 2008,<lb/> some services were reimbursed through DRG-based payment but revenues for each hospital could differ by<lb/> only 1% (above or below) of the amount that would have been paid under the global budget. This range<lb/> was referred to as the &quot; risk corridor &quot; . Thus, initially, the expected hospital volumes were determined using<lb/> the historic volumes which were used to define the prospective global budgets (as was the case before<lb/> 2008). The total revenue based on DRG-based payments for the same volume of care was then calculated.<lb/> If this amount was outside the risk corridor then the hospital was paid by global budget.<lb/> 123.<lb/> Since 2009, activity-based payment (DRG) has been the predominant payment system for<lb/> hospital activity and the risk corridor no longer exists. It replaced the global budget and has been used<lb/> since that date (except for the year 2011 when global budget was re-introduced for one year). The<lb/> classification is based on International Refined-DRG and adjusted to fit Czech circumstances. There are<lb/> approximately 1 000 DRGs associated with relative cost weights. DRG weights include costs for<lb/> medications, medical devices and physicians&apos; salaries.<lb/></figure>

			<p>124.<lb/> Some hospital services are remunerated via alternative mechanisms such as fee-for-service or<lb/> specified budgets for certain rare diseases in some particular hospitals. Additionally, psychiatric care,<lb/> rehabilitation and some patient groups where cost variability is too high are excluded from DRG-based<lb/> payment. Psychiatric and rehabilitative care, for example, is paid on a fee-for-service basis.<lb/></p>

			<head>Hospitals reimbursement base rate<lb/></head>

			<p>125.<lb/> The DRG payments from insurers for the provision of inpatient services are determined by a<lb/> DRG weight multiplied by a base rate. Theoretically, hospitals and insurers are free to negotiate this base<lb/> rate but in practice, it is decided centrally. The Minister for Health sets out the base rate in an annual<lb/> decree published in December of the previous year.<lb/> 126.<lb/> The principal parameter in determining the base rate in the hospital sector is the projected ability<lb/> for health insurers to pay for hospital services via their revenues from social insurance contributions. There<lb/> is no single base rate for all hospitals, however. During the transition from the global budget to the DRG-<lb/>based system, hospital-specific base rates were defined to mitigate the effects of transition. These<lb/> &quot; individual &quot; base rates are converging towards a single base rate. Consequently, each year, the public<lb/> decree also sets out the rules on base rate convergence. The variation in hospital base rates has decreased in<lb/> recent years. In 2014, the convergence has been completed at the hospital level as each hospital applies a<lb/> single base rate to all insurers.<lb/></p>

			<head>The tapering payment system in the Czech Republic<lb/> Technical consideration<lb/></head>

			<p>127.<lb/> Almost all activities are subject to tapering payment beyond a pre-defined threshold. As<lb/> explained previously, a few activities were withdrawn from DRG-based payment because of the huge<lb/> variations in costs between cases within a single DRG. Such care, however, is also subject to tapering<lb/> payment, although the actual payment is calculated differently. There may be exceptions as a result of<lb/> bilateral agreements between insurers and hospitals, the details of which are difficult to access.<lb/></p>

			<figure>128.<lb/> The Ministry of Health determines the formula used to set the activity caps (expressed in terms of<lb/> case mix) above which tapering applies. Caps are set for each hospital-insurer pair. Thus, each hospital has<lb/> to consider separate activity caps for the billing of services to each individual insurer. It is not the total<lb/> volume produced by a hospital that is decisive for the application of tapering but the volume provided for<lb/> each insurer. The formula changes each year because the Ministry tries to ensure that the system is<lb/> financially balanced (see Annex 3 for a detailed description of the formula used in 2013).<lb/> 129.<lb/> The tapering payment mechanism can be broken down into two main steps:<lb/></figure>

			<p> Step 1: A cap is set centrally for growth in activity between t-2 and t, expressed in terms of the<lb/> ratio volume t /volume t-2 but also taking into account the change in the number of admissions so as<lb/> to control risks of upcoding. In 2011, the cap was set at 98% of the volume for the benchmark<lb/> year (representing a 2% fall in volumes). In 2012, the cap was set at 115% of the case mix for<lb/> 2010 (an increase of 15%). At the same time, a lower trigger threshold for tapering was set for<lb/> hospitals where activity, adjusted for case mix, was between 105% and 115% of that of the<lb/> preceding year but where the number of admissions had fallen. This mechanism sought to<lb/> discourage hospitals from &quot; upcoding &quot; their activities.<lb/></p>

			<figure> Step 2: Hospital revenue is defined for each contract between each individual hospital and each<lb/> insurer (i.e. more than 1 000 contracts), as follows:<lb/>  Hospital volumes in year t are estimated and compared to those for year t-2;<lb/>  This volume growth is benchmarked with the centrally set cap (115 in year 2012<lb/> 26 );<lb/>  The change in a hospital&apos;s &quot; regulated case mix &quot; (Vol t /Vol t-2 ) cannot be greater than the<lb/> centrally set cap (1.15 in year 2012). The regulated case mix is therefore equal to the<lb/> minimum of Vol t /Vol t-2 and 1.15.<lb/></figure>

			<p> The &quot; regulated case mix &quot; is then multiplied by the hospital&apos;s base rate to establish the<lb/> revenue that the insurer must pay the hospital.<lb/>  In 2012, two caps were in force: hospitals received only 50% of the tariff per case beyond the<lb/> first cap (105%) and were not paid at all for activities beyond the second cap (115%).<lb/> 130.<lb/> In practical terms, hospitals receive advances at the beginning of each month based on the<lb/> reimbursement levels for preceding years. The total amount paid by an insurer to a hospital is therefore<lb/> known only at the end of the period. Consequently, the amount of tapering is calculated ex post, and it<lb/> takes the form of reductions on future hospital activities billed to that insurer. In practice, at the end of the<lb/> year, an adjustment is made and, where necessary, hospitals repay the insurers over the next quarter<lb/> (between April and June). All calculations are made by insurers, but the hospital may raise an objection in<lb/> case of disagreement.<lb/></p>

			<head>Rationale of introduction<lb/></head>

			<p>131.<lb/> The tapering payment mechanism was introduced alongside DRG-based payment in 2009 to<lb/> prevent inflationary effects during the shift to DRG-based payment and to attenuate the impact of<lb/> transition. With the economic crisis and the need to control rising costs, the tapering system remained in<lb/> use after the transition period, except in 2011 when global budget was reintroduced for one year. However,<lb/> in 2014 the government decided to move back to hospital financing via prospective global budgeting.<lb/></p>

			<head>Evaluation of effectiveness<lb/></head>

			<p>132.<lb/> The impact of tapering on volume growth is not obvious (<ref type="figure">Figure 9</ref>)</p>

			<figure>. Between 2009 and 2010<lb/> when the tapering system was introduced –together with DRG payments-, the overall case mix for all care<lb/> remunerated on a DRG basis rose by nearly 15%. The Ministry of Health noted a slight fall in the case mix<lb/> 26<lb/> A single cap has been used to simplify matters.<lb/> in 2012 but did not link it to tapering. Indeed, in 2011, the Czech Republic reintroduced a global budget<lb/> before reverting to tapering in 2012.<lb/></figure>

			<p>133.<lb/> Actually, the tapering mechanism was not expected to contain volume growth in the long term.<lb/> As the case mix in year t was used as the benchmark for calculating the cap two years later, hospitals still<lb/> had a strategic interest in increasing their volumes. This may, in part, explain why the Czech Republic<lb/> reverted to the global budget in 2014.<lb/></p>

			<head>Israel<lb/> Basic facts of health system<lb/></head>

			<p>134.<lb/> Israel is a country where basic health coverage is provided via social health insurance. Since<lb/> 1995, all permanent residents of Israel have been entitled to access to the services listed under the National<lb/> Health Insurance (NHI) Act. This basket of care includes outpatient consultations, analyses and diagnoses,<lb/> inpatient and rehabilitative care (<ref type="biblio">Bowers, 2014</ref>). To receive these services, permanent residents are<lb/> required to sign up with one of the four Social Health Insurance funds (SHI funds). Risk selection of<lb/> clients for contracts that cover basic services is not permitted.<lb/> 135.<lb/> Revenues of SHI funds are generated from two sources: a payroll tax, set by law, and general<lb/> taxation. Insurers cannot adjust contributions in line with their financial situation. There are exemptions<lb/> and rate reductions for various groups of the population such as pensioners and recipients of replacement<lb/> income. All revenues are collected by the National Insurance Institute (NII) distributing them to the four<lb/> SHI funds.<lb/></p>

			<head>Hospitals<lb/></head>

			<table>136.<lb/> Hospital expenditure in Israel accounted for 1.9% of GDP in 2009, lower than the OECD average<lb/> (2.6% of GDP).<lb/> 137.<lb/> On average, 59% of expenditure on hospital services is funded by social security (the four<lb/> insurers), 33% by the State, 5% by corporations and 2% directly by households. These out-of-pocket<lb/> expenditures are not co-payments since acute hospital services are free at the point of delivery; they<lb/> include payments for services which are not included in the basic health care basket.<lb/> 138.<lb/> One of the features of hospital provision in Israel is the low number of beds. There are 3.3 beds<lb/> per 1 000 population, ranking Israel 19 th among OECD countries for this indicator. The average number of<lb/> beds in OECD countries is 4.9 per 1 000 population. The number of beds remained stable between 2000<lb/> and 2011 in Israel (+0.5%)</table>

			<p>, whereas it fell by 5% on average throughout the OECD. Only 58% of<lb/> hospitals beds are dedicated to curative care which is below the OECD average. However, at 198, the<lb/> number of hospital discharges per 1 000 population for Israel is 28% higher than the OECD average of<lb/> 155.<lb/> 139.<lb/> Most hospital beds in Israel are public: 85% of beds are in public hospitals compared to an<lb/> average of 73% in the OECD countries. The private hospitals are either managed by one of the four<lb/> principal insurers, forming part of a health maintenance organisation, or by private independent businesses.<lb/> The patient is free to choose the hospital he attends, although there are incentives to guide him in the form<lb/> of agreements between hospitals and health insurer.<lb/> 140.<lb/> The government has a strong influence on how hospital provision is organised and its main<lb/> features. It decides on the number of beds and the type of activities for which they are earmarked in both<lb/> public and private sectors. Similarly, investment in costly technologies such as medical imaging is<lb/> regulated by local governments for hospitals that enter into contracts with the four social health insurers.<lb/></p>

			<head>Hospital payments in Israel<lb/></head>

			<p>141.<lb/> Hospitals are financed either by activity-based payments or by a per diem. The activity-based<lb/> payment system is different from that commonly used in other OECD countries. In Israel, it refers to<lb/> procedures rather than to diagnoses. These payments were introduced in the 1990s to reduce waiting lists<lb/> for 30 relatively costly interventions. In 2009, the payments covered 150 interventions and accounted for<lb/> an average of around one-third of hospital revenues, with strong variations across hospitals. They currently<lb/> cover 240 procedures and account for 38% of care revenues in hospitals.<lb/></p>

			<head>142.<lb/> Per diem</head>

			<p>payments apply to most inpatient stays. They account for 35% of hospital budgets and<lb/> 62% of payments for inpatient care. Per diem payments are set according to speciality but also by type of<lb/> care (intensive, etc.). There are 46 different per diem hospital payments.<lb/> 143.<lb/> Hospital payments are regulated by law only for the public sector. Therefore, the tariffs for<lb/> procedure-based payments and per diem drawn up by the Ministry only apply in public hospitals. Most<lb/> private hospitals use these tariffs as well, although there is no legal requirement for them to do so. The<lb/> tariffs of the various services are updated twice a year by a committee including representatives of the<lb/> Ministries of Finance and Health, the insurers and hospitals. Tariffs must be revised without changing the<lb/> overall budget. Any increase in tariffs for a procedure or the introduction of a new service must therefore<lb/> be to the detriment of another procedure. The tariffs define the maximum amount that hospitals can invoice<lb/> for the provision of a service.<lb/></p>

			<head>The tapering payment system in Israel<lb/> Technical considerations<lb/></head>

			<p>144.<lb/> Tapering payments apply to payments made by public insurers to public hospitals. The scope of<lb/> tapering has been expanded since it was introduced. It originally applied only to activities at public<lb/> hospitals owned by the government, but, since 2008, tapering has been expanded to cover public hospitals<lb/> owned by health insurers. Expenditures covered under private insurance coverage are not considered at all<lb/> in this scheme.<lb/> 145.<lb/> Every year, the government determines parameters for the tapering system (budget caps and tariff<lb/> reductions) but these parameters only apply &quot; by default &quot; when no bilateral agreement has been signed<lb/> between a hospital and a SHI fund. The general rule is that payments for hospital activities are governed by<lb/> individual contracts between SHI funds and hospitals. The tapering system drawn up by the government<lb/> applies only to 10% of cases. However, the structure of the tapering system introduced by the government<lb/> strongly influences the structure of the individual contracts between hospitals and SHI funds.<lb/></p>

			<head>Default system in 2014: under the legal framework, tapering payment affects only 10% of activities<lb/></head>

			<p>146.<lb/> Tapering covers most activities paid through per diem or procedure-based payments, with some<lb/> exceptions (e.g. psychiatric care).<lb/> 147.<lb/> In practice, the following principles apply to each hospital and insurer in 2014. Contracts<lb/> between each hospital and insurer in 2012 determine the Gross Revenue Cap (GRC), or the total amount<lb/> billed for treatments at national tariffs, and the Net Revenue Cap (NRC), which equals the GRC minus<lb/> discounts agreed during negotiations between the insurer and the hospital. At the same time, adjustments<lb/> are allowed so as to take into account changes in prices in the hospital sector, demographic trends and bed<lb/> capacity<lb/> 27 . If the hospital exceeds the Gross Revenue Cap stated in the contract, then hospitals are<lb/> remunerated at a reduced rate.<lb/> 148.<lb/> Israel&apos;s tapering payment system employs several caps and tapering rates (<ref type="table">Table 8</ref>): for any<lb/> activities that exceed the hospital cap by up to +2%, insurers pay only 70% of the price negotiated the<lb/> previous year by hospitals and funds. They then pay 33% of the negotiated price for overshoots of between<lb/> 102% and 113% of the negotiated volume, and finally 65% of the negotiated price beyond 113%.<lb/> 149.<lb/> The 33% rate was apparently chosen to reflect the difference between a hospital&apos;s total charges<lb/> and its wage bill, which in Israel is close to 70%. From the hospitals&apos; point of view, it was necessary to set<lb/> a tapering rate that did not act as a disincentive for the delivery of care. From the insurers&apos; point of view,<lb/> the rate had to be low enough to increase their negotiating power.<lb/> 150.<lb/> The tapering mechanism also protects hospitals against any significant drop in volume of<lb/> activities (<ref type="table">Table 7</ref>). Regardless of its level of activity, a hospital is guaranteed to receive 95% of the Net<lb/> Revenue Cap. The hospital also receives 30% of the payments it would have received for undelivered<lb/> services representing 95%-100% of the Gross Revenue Cap, in other words for services up to the tapering<lb/> threshold (<ref type="table">Table 7</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<figure>27<lb/> The Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Finance first updates hospitals&apos; activity caps in 2012 in line<lb/> with two key parameters: the increase in the number of persons insured by the SHI funds, and the historic<lb/> payment patterns for hospitals (price and quantity) for each SHI funds. Projected changes in these<lb/> parameters are based on trends over the previous five years.<lb/></figure>

			<head>Tapering as part of negotiations between insurers and hospitals<lb/></head>

			<p>151.<lb/> Each time the government publishes a new tapering system (i.e. new activity thresholds and new<lb/> tariff reductions), hospitals begin negotiations with the main insurers. The government publishes<lb/> guidelines that take into account previous contracts between hospitals and SHI funds and define the<lb/> reductions that apply over and above specific volumes of hospital activity. Outside this legal framework,<lb/> SHI funds and hospitals can negotiate specific tariff reductions or reduced waiting times for their insurees.<lb/> Whilst hospitals and insurers are not required to take into account the default framework decreed by the<lb/> government, all contracts that are negotiated are required to comply with the minimum activity levels that<lb/> must be paid for by the insurer to the hospital. In 2014, therefore, an insurer that has a contract with a<lb/> hospital is required to pay at least 95% of the amount it paid to the hospital in 2012.<lb/> 152.<lb/> The system introduced by the government is the starting point for negotiating contracts between<lb/> insurers and hospitals. In practice, in the case of the SHI fund &quot; Clalit &quot; , a representative negotiates with<lb/> hospitals in each district. 28 Each district representative knows the budget per capita, adjusted for case<lb/> severity, that he is authorised to negotiate with all hospitals. The three principal parameters discussed<lb/> during negotiation are the global budget before discounts, discounts and, finally, quality of care including<lb/> waiting times. The representative and hospital negotiate on the basis of services delivered in the previous<lb/> year and take account of overall trends in volume estimated by the government. Epidemiological trends are<lb/> not taken into account during the negotiations.<lb/> 153.<lb/> The degree of tapering negotiated in bilateral contracts can be high. According to the Ministry of<lb/> Health, the difference between the prices set by the committee and the prices negotiated can be explained<lb/> by the fact that the prices set by the committee take into account variable and fixed costs of production.<lb/> 28<lb/> A district is an administrative division below central government and above municipalities.<lb/> During negotiations, SHI funds can negotiate discounts as a function of negotiated volumes by paying only<lb/> for variable costs.<lb/> 154.<lb/> The contracts concluded between SHI funds and hospitals set out two types of reduction. The<lb/> first is a system-wide reduction in the tariff for hospital services applicable to all activities. The second<lb/> applies above a specified level of activity (tapering). The average discount negotiated is 19.4%. This<lb/> discount can be (artificially) expressed according to three components: a system-wide reduction of 2%<lb/> applied on all hospitals, that takes account of the general increase in hospital volumes; a &quot; theoretical &quot;<lb/> reduction representing the reduction that the insurer would have received under the tapering system laid<lb/> down by the Government, which is on average 10%; and, finally, the reduction obtained by the insurer as<lb/> part of its negotiations with the hospital, on average 7.4%.<lb/> 155.<lb/> Some services are excluded from the tapering payment system. If a hospital wants to introduce a<lb/> new activity, then that activity is not taken into account during negotiations on the capping system.<lb/> Moreover, if a hospital wants to develop a particular activity, for example MRI scans, the SHI fund can<lb/> seek significant discounts in exchange for volume growth. If the SHI fund wants to offer a particular<lb/> quality of service to its insurers, such as reduction in waiting times for certain procedures, it may agree to<lb/> smaller reductions in exchange for better quality of service.<lb/> 156.<lb/> In practice, tapering is applied to charges in the current year. Using the monthly invoices sent by<lb/> the hospitals, the SHI funds decide whether the monthly demand for payments is in line with the expected<lb/> monthly payment given the cap set by the government or during negotiations. If the monthly invoice<lb/> exceeds the expected amount, the SHI funds subtract a proportion of the reduced tariff that was negotiated.<lb/> Each month, the SHI funds take account of previous payments to balance out this system of adjustments to<lb/> charges.<lb/></p>

			<head>Rationale of introduction<lb/></head>

			<p>157.<lb/> Tapering payment was introduced in 1994 at the same time as the Health Insurance Act that made<lb/> health coverage universal in Israel. Upon introduction, the aims of tapering were twofold: to constrain<lb/> growth in the use of hospital services and to reduce insurers&apos; expenditure on services above the cap. It was<lb/> intended to provide some protection to SHI funds which feared that provision of health insurance for the<lb/> whole population would lead to an explosion in health expenditure in general, and hospital costs in<lb/> particular.<lb/> 158.<lb/> Tapering payment has been in a state of continuous change since it was introduced. <ref type="biblio">Between<lb/> 1994 and 1997</ref>, the revenue cap above which tapering applied was an absolute maximum: the hospital<lb/> received no further payment at all once the cap had been reached. Between 1997 and 2005, SHI funds paid<lb/> only 50% of the charge for services above the cap. At the time, this rate was accepted as a reasonable<lb/> estimate of the variable proportion of hospital costs. However, insurers were suspected of concentrating<lb/> inpatient treatment for their insurees on just one hospital, so as to reduce the cost of services supplied. To<lb/> remedy this unintended effect, in 2005, the Government introduced an intermediate cap: for services<lb/> delivered between 102% and 113% of the cap, insurers paid only 33% of the cost. Insurers were therefore<lb/> given an incentive to spread their insurees across several hospitals.<lb/></p>

			<head>Summary of tapering experiences<lb/></head>

			<p>159.<lb/> In conclusion, the four case studies show that tapering payment is intended primarily to contain<lb/> the growth of hospital costs by imposing constraints on individual hospitals rather than the hospital sector<lb/> as a whole. Central authorities (ministries or independent agency) have a major say in setting the<lb/> parameters that govern tapering payments. In practice, where hospital payment is concerned, tapering is<lb/> essentially applied to the tariffs for the current year but is further adjusted by a process of reconciliation the<lb/> following year.<lb/> 160.<lb/> Tapering payment is justified by the existence of economies of scale, even if the empirical<lb/> evidence for such economies in the hospital sector is not used in setting either the thresholds or rates of<lb/> tapering payment. This goes some way to explaining the wide range of rates in place in the four countries<lb/> studied. In some cases, the rates have been used for policy objectives. For example, in Maryland, at some<lb/> point, a tapering rate of 15% was decided upon to allow hospitals to increase their profitability so as to<lb/> encourage investment.<lb/> 161.<lb/> Tapering payment does help to contain the growth of hospital costs, but there are very few<lb/> records of its impact on hospital volumes. Just one study in Maryland provided evidence of livelier growth<lb/> in activity between 2001 and 2008, a period when tapering was abolished. Given the moderate impact of<lb/> tapering payment on hospital activities, some countries are inclining towards a more rigorous system of<lb/> control over hospital activities such as a global budget (Czech Republic and Maryland).<lb/></p>

			<head>CONCLUSION<lb/> 162.<lb/></head>

			<p>In 2011, hospital care costs accounted for 29% of all health spending, on average, in OECD<lb/> countries and for 2.6% of gross domestic product (GDP). On average, hospital care costs in the OECD<lb/> countries continued to grow in 2010 and 2011, but at a markedly slower rate than in 2008 and 2009. Many<lb/> countries have taken measures to rein in public spending in this area: cutting the salaries paid to health<lb/> professionals, cutting staff numbers, reducing the fees paid to health care providers and increasing the<lb/> patient&apos;s out-of-pocket share, all in an attempt to ease the pressure on budgets (<ref type="biblio">Morgan and Astolfi, 2013</ref>).<lb/> 163.<lb/> In most OECD countries, spending on hospitals is funded mainly by the public sector. Whilst<lb/> health systems vary across the OECD countries, there are similarities in the way hospital costs are<lb/> financed. On average, across OECD countries, 88% of these costs were funded by the public sector in<lb/> 2011. One exception is the United States where private insurers meet 36% of hospital costs. This is due to<lb/> the fact that 53% of the US population are covered by private insurance. In most other OECD countries,<lb/> private insurance has a much more limited role providing only complementary or supplementary insurance<lb/> for their population. As a result, private insurers only finance about 5% of hospital spending across OECD<lb/> countries. Patients also contribute to the costs of hospital care, by 6% on average across the OECD.<lb/> 164.<lb/> Whereas global budgets are the predominant mode of payment for hospital services in tax-funded<lb/> national health systems, remuneration through DRGs is the main mode to pay hospital in countries with<lb/> social health insurance. Two-third of countries with a health insurance system have opted for DRG-based<lb/> payment or payment per case to public hospitals as the main mode of payment (14 out of 20) and three<lb/> others have chosen fee-for-service payment, which also ties the hospital&apos;s payment to the activity it<lb/> performs. 29 DRG-based hospital payment was introduced in OECD countries with different objectives,<lb/> such as: increase efficiency in the use of resources in hospitals, contain hospital costs, increase<lb/> transparency, reduce waiting times, better allocate resources between hospitals and/or improve the quality<lb/> of care.<lb/> 165.<lb/> To control the inflationary effects of DRG-based payment, some OECD countries have<lb/> introduced a tapering scale of rates for DRG-based payment above a defined volume of production. The<lb/> main reason given to justify this mechanism is that economies of scale can be achieved within the hospital<lb/> production system. Whilst the empirical evidence for such economies in the hospital sector is unclear, it is<lb/> generally recognised in these countries that, above a given level of production, fixed costs have been paid<lb/> for and hospitals can only be paid for variable costs. Tapering payments have been introduced in six<lb/> OECD countries: Germany, USA (State of Maryland), the Czech Republic, Israel, Australia and Hungary.<lb/> Detailed case studies have been conducted on four of these – Germany, Maryland, the Czech Republic and<lb/> Israel – to identify the main economic, institutional and technical issues entailed in introducing a tapering<lb/> scale mechanism.<lb/> 166.<lb/> The four case studies conclude that tapering payment is intended primarily to contain the growth<lb/> of hospital costs and is justified by the existence of economies of scale. But the circumstances surrounding<lb/> its introduction vary. In Maryland and initially in Germany, the main motivation is to capture the financial<lb/> 29<lb/></p>

			<p>Source: http://www.oecd.org/els/health-systems/characteristics.htm.<lb/> gains of the economies of scale realised. In Israel and the Czech Republic, it was introduced in response to<lb/> the fear that activity volumes might increase, as a result of generalised health insurance coverage (in Israel)<lb/> or of the introduction of DRG-based payment (in the Czech Republic). This is also true for Germany,<lb/> where the re-introduction of the second tapering mechanism in 2013 was intended to rein in activity<lb/> growth.<lb/> 167.<lb/> The levels of hospital activity above which tapering scale rates apply are set on the basis of data<lb/> for past years and projections of how demand will develop. In Germany and the State of Maryland, the<lb/> threshold at which tapering begins is the level of activity of the reference year (usually the previous year);<lb/> all activities above this level are paid at a reduced tariff. In the Czech Republic, a single annual formula<lb/> determines the threshold above which tapering applies to each hospital/insurance fund contract, set on the<lb/> basis of the change in activity between t-2 and t. In Israel, the thresholds for tapering are agreed every year<lb/> between each insurer and hospital. Thresholds are set in terms of the change in activity volume (case mix)<lb/> in most of the countries studied. Israel alone sets them on the basis of the hospital&apos;s gross revenue.<lb/> 168.<lb/> Central authorities (ministries or independent agency) have a major role in setting tapering scales,<lb/> or reductions on the full tariff, whether these are agreed by negotiation or imposed unilaterally. In 2009<lb/> and 2012, in Germany, the scale was negotiated in each Land by the regional hospital and insurance fund<lb/> associations; the scale was decreed by federal law for the years 2013 and 2014 and is applicable<lb/> nationwide. Scales are set by the Ministry of Health in the Czech Republic and by an independent<lb/> government agency in the State of Maryland. In Israel, tapering scales are set by the health and finance<lb/> ministries, but only 10% of contracts signed between insurers and hospitals apply them as they stand. For<lb/> 90% of contracts, rates and thresholds are renegotiated by the parties to the contract.<lb/> 169.<lb/> Tapering scales vary considerably from one country to another, and two countries apply different<lb/> rates for different bands of activity. Tapering scale rates, supposedly reflecting the proportion of fixed<lb/> costs in total hospital costs, stood between 25% and 67% in 2013 in the countries analysed. These rates<lb/> varied over time as a result of negotiation or to meet a number of policy objectives (encouraging<lb/> investment, for example). Currently, Maryland and the Czech Republic apply a reduction of 50%. In<lb/> Germany, a starting rate of 25% is applied to any activity above that of the reference year, and a second<lb/> rate of 65% applies to activity beyond a &quot; negotiated &quot; activity threshold. Since this negotiation is, in effect,<lb/> a projection of activity for the current year which is agreed by the contracting parties, the second threshold<lb/> is only rarely applied. In Israel, there are three set rates corresponding to three different activity thresholds<lb/> (30%, 67% and 35%). The second rate (67%) seeks to encourage insurers to spread their insurees over all<lb/> hospitals rather than concentrating all activity on just one hospital, to maximise the benefits of tapering<lb/> payment. All the countries acknowledge the existence of economies of scale in hospital production, but in<lb/> each country there is no national or scientific study justifying the rate applied or negotiated. The tapering<lb/> mechanism in Maryland is the most coherent in terms of economies of scale, because hospitals are paid the<lb/> fixed costs of every activity that is planned but not performed. In the most usual situation where the<lb/> hospital exceeds its activity ceiling, the hospital is paid only for its variable costs, and reassessment of the<lb/> ceiling the following year disregards this excess activity above the ceiling.<lb/> 170.<lb/> Tapering payment is applied uniformly to all hospital activities, but Germany and Maryland<lb/> make adjustments to allow for the impact of new activities. These adjustments are made in two ways.<lb/> Germany excludes certain treatments or services from tapering payment, for example, treatments where<lb/> equipment costs are more than two-thirds of the total cost of the procedure, or new activities entailed in<lb/> setting up a new service or a new operating theatre. In Maryland, hospitals are able to negotiate with the<lb/> government agency responsible for hospital charges and agree increases in the activity ceiling above which<lb/> tapering payment will apply after new activities are created.<lb/> 171.<lb/> Tapering is essentially applied to the remuneration rates for the current year but is further<lb/> adjusted by a process of reconciliation the following year. In Germany, Maryland and Israel, the estimated<lb/> effect of tapering is spread over all DRG tariffs for the current year, which are set annually (Germany) or<lb/> adjusted monthly (Israel). In Germany, an a posteriori reconciliation is carried out to take account of any<lb/> mismatch between activities planned and activities actually performed. Hospitals in Maryland have a<lb/> software which allows them to factor tapering payment and authorised income into their invoiced prices. In<lb/> the Czech Republic, by contrast, the amount of tapering is calculated ex post, and it takes the form of<lb/> reductions on future activities which the hospital invoices to each insurer.<lb/></p>

			<figure>172.<lb/> The impact of tapering payment on hospital activity is unclear. It does</figure>

			<p>, in principle, help to<lb/> contain the growth of hospital costs. In Germany, the tapering scale&apos;s starting band was assumed to<lb/> generate savings of 350 Mio EUR and 270 Mio EUR in 2011 and 2012 respectively (around 0.5% of total<lb/> spending) but it is important to note that annual case-mix increases seemed to have slowed down with the<lb/> introduction of the tapering mechanism. In Israel, the &quot; theoretical &quot; saving is put at 10% of total payments<lb/> to hospitals, but in fact higher savings are negotiated between insurers and hospitals. There is, however,<lb/> only one study that demonstrates the impact of this mechanism on hospital volumes. Maryland saw a more<lb/> dynamic pace of growth in activity from 2001 to 2008, a period when tapering was abolished. At the same<lb/> time, tapering seems to have had an effect on the organisation of hospitals in Maryland where hospitals<lb/> developed management tools which allowed them to monitor the activity of health practitioners (who are<lb/> independent). The introduction of tapering scale does not seem to reduce access of patients to hospitals<lb/> services. No stakeholder interviewed for this project (hospitals and insurers) believed that hospitals turn<lb/> away patients or defer certain treatments in order to avoid being paid at a lower tariff.<lb/> 173.<lb/> Given the moderate impact of tapering payment on hospital activities, some of the countries<lb/> studied are inclined to introduce more rigorous systems of control. The Czech Republic has reverted to a<lb/> global budget for 2014 in order to have tighter control over hospital spending. In Maryland, the majority of<lb/> hospitals will be paid through global budget in 2014, in an attempt to keep growth in total hospital<lb/> spending in line with growth in the State&apos;s wealth.<lb/></p>

			<figure>ANNEX 1: DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE FEATURES OF DRG-BASED PAYMENT<lb/> SYSTEMS IN OECD COUNTRIES<lb/></figure>

			<p>174.<lb/> DRG systems exist in nearly all OECD countries but they can serve different purposes. Whereas<lb/> they are used as method to pay for hospital activity in a number of countries they are used as a patient<lb/> classification system to define hospital budgets in others (<ref type="biblio">Geissler et al., 2011</ref>). For a more detailed<lb/> appraisal of the characteristics of DRG-based payment in the OECD countries, the following parameters<lb/> were analysed for each country: date when DRG-based payment was introduced, classification system<lb/> used, number of DRG hospital groups, and intervals at which the payment system is revised (Table A.1).<lb/></p>

Use of this patient classification system grew and<lb/> accelerated in OECD countries during the 2000s as information technology became more sophisticated.<lb/> Thirteen OECD countries adopted this system during the 2000s out of the 21 which now use it and for<lb/> which figures are available.<lb/> 176.<lb/> Three types of OECD countries can be distinguished by the way in which they went about<lb/> adopting DRG-based payment systems (<ref type="biblio">Busse et al., 2011</ref>). Some countries, like Spain, Portugal and<lb/> Ireland, imported a classification system from abroad. Spain and Portugal, for example, adopted the All-<lb/>Patient DRG system (AP-DRG) developed in the USA. Other countries such as Australia imported the US<lb/> system and used it as a starting point for developing their own DRG systems. Thus, Australia created the<lb/> Australian National DRG (AN-DRG) which served as a starting point for the German DRG (G-DRG)<lb/> system. Other countries opted to devise their patient classification systems as a collaborative effort. The<lb/> Nordic countries, for example, created a common NordDRG system that is further adjustable to country-<lb/>specific conditions. The United Kingdom, Austria, the Netherlands and France decided to develop their<lb/> own systems.<lb/> 177.<lb/> Within classifications, the number of homogeneous patient groups differ. There are 526 groups in<lb/> the patient classification system used by Poland, but there are about 2 500 groups in the French system.<lb/> That said, the difference between group numbers in certain countries does not de facto indicate a difference<lb/> in approach. In Australia, for example, there are some 700 groups as against about 2 500 in France. This<lb/> difference simply reflects a different way of dealing with the severity of the cases treated. In France,<lb/> severity level -measured by the patient&apos;s age or the existence of comorbidities-is taken into account in a<lb/> separate group. In Australia, severity, measured approximately in terms of length of stay, is reflected by<lb/> the application of different tariffs within one and the same group. Thus, the number of groups is lower in<lb/> Australia than in France, but this does not mean that Australia covers fewer severe conditions than France.<lb/> 178.<lb/> Regarding the scope of DRG-based payment, most OECD countries do not include training or<lb/> teaching activities in the calculation of DRG-based payments (Table A.2). Hospitals are usually<lb/> remunerated for these activities out of a global envelope. When DRG-based payment is used in hospitals of<lb/> different legal status, the same rule applies to all hospitals, except in the USA&apos;s Medicare programme<lb/> where teaching and training activities are not taken into account when calculating DRG-based payment in<lb/> private not-for-profit hospitals but are taken into account in private for-profit hospitals and public<lb/> hospitals.<lb/> 179.<lb/> A significant proportion of DRG-based payments include capital costs in the calculation of tariffs<lb/> (Netherlands, France, Switzerland, USA, Denmark, Finland, Italy, United Kingdom) irrespective of<lb/> whether of DRGs paid to public or private hospitals.<lb/> 180.<lb/> Most OECD countries which use DRG-based payment include doctors&apos; fees in their calculation<lb/> of cost-per-case tariffs (<ref type="table">Table A</ref>.3). In some countries they might be excluded depending on the<lb/> circumstances. In France, payments to doctors are included in the DRG-tariff calculated for public<lb/> hospitals but not in those billed to private for-profit hospitals where fees are invoiced separately. Germany<lb/> does not take into account the fees of specialists who are not hospital-based but are authorised to operate in<lb/> a hospital setting in the DRGs billed by hospitals. In this case, the hospital is paid for the patient&apos;s care<lb/> episode and the specialist can invoice the patient for the fees for his treatment.<lb/> 181.<lb/> In most OECD countries, DRG-based payment also stretches to cover day care costs. When it<lb/> comes to expensive drugs only eight of the 23 countries for which figures are available and which use<lb/> DRG-based payment as the main method of remunerating hospitals include them all in their DRG tariffs.<lb/> In the other countries, there are additional payments either for all expensive drugs or for specific drugs. In<lb/> Italy, for example, most of the regions authorise additional payments for anti-cancer drugs. Likewise, in<lb/> Sweden, some regions pay for some expensive drugs separately. The findings are similar for expensive<lb/> medical devices.<lb/></p>

			<figure>ANNEX 3: FORMULA FOR CALCULATING THE HOSPITAL&apos;S ACTIVITIES CAP AND<lb/> REVENUE IN THE CZECH REPUBLIC<lb/> For 2013, the following formula was used to calculate the activities cap for each insurer-hospital<lb/> pairing.<lb/> CAP REV 2013 = max {min [1.07 × CM red × ITC 2011 ; CM red × TC 2013 ]; CMred × ITC 2011 }<lb/> Where:<lb/> CM red = the regulated case mix for the hospital j and the insurer i is calculated as follows:<lb/> S = coefficient for the changes in the number of people insured by each insurer<lb/> CM = total volume (case mix)<lb/> N = number of cases<lb/> α = 0.2 (Cobb-Douglas function coefficient)<lb/> CM red = min {CM 2011 × 0.95 × S; CM 2013 ; (CM 2013 ) α × (1.05 × N 2013 × (CM 2011 /N 2011 )) (1-α) }<lb/></figure>

			<p>Assuming that no insured person has changed insurer, the formula implies that the case mix to<lb/> calculate the cap is no greater than 95% of the case mix for 2011.<lb/> This formula is easier to understand if the third term in the function is expressed in another form:<lb/></p>

				<formula>(</formula>

			<figure>CM 2013 ) α × (1.05 × N 2013 × (CM 2011 /N 2011 )) (1-α) = 1.05 (1-α) × N 2013 × (CM 2013 / N 2013 ) α × (CM 2011 /N 2011 ) (1-<lb/>α)<lb/> Transforming the third part of the function in this way means that the formula can be interpreted in<lb/> terms of growth in severity per case between 2011 and 2013, since (CM 2013 /N 2013 ) represents severity per<lb/> case in 2013.<lb/> Next, if severity per case increased by 5% between 2011 and 2013, then:<lb/> (CM 2011 / N 2011 )= (1/1.05) × (CM 2013 /N 2013 )<lb/></figure>

			<p>By incorporating this equality into the third term in the function Min, it is clear that:<lb/></p>

			<table>(CM 2013 ) α × (1.05 × N 2013 × (CM 2011 /N 2011 )) (1-α) = CM 2013<lb/></table>

			<p>Thus, where growth in severity per case is 5%, the formula becomes:<lb/></p>

			<figure>CM red = min {CM 2011 × 0.95 × S; CM 2013 }<lb/></figure>

			<p>By demonstrating this equality, we note therefore that 5% is a threshold above which the third term<lb/> plays a role in setting the reduced case mix. The decree not only achieves control over the rate of growth in<lb/> hospital volumes but also helps protect insurers from upcoding. A cap on average case mix per patient is<lb/> set by the Ministry of Health for each hospital. In 2013, an increase greater than 5% would be deemed too<lb/> high.<lb/></p>

			<p>To understand how this works, if severity per case rises by less than 5% then:<lb/></p>

			<figure>CM 2013 &lt; (CM 2013 ) α × (1.05 × N 2013 × (CM 2011 /N 2011 )) (1-α)<lb/></figure>

			<p>Thus, where growth in severity per case is less than 5%, the formula becomes:<lb/></p>

			<figure>CM red = min {CM 2011 × 0.95 × S; CM 2013 }<lb/> Similarly, where severity per case increases by more than 5%, then:<lb/> CM 2013 &gt; (CM 2013 ) α × (1.05 × N 2013 × (CM 2011 /N 2011 )) (1-α)<lb/></figure>

			<p>Thus, where growth in severity per case is greater than 5%, the formula becomes:<lb/></p>

			<figure>CM red = min {CM 2011 × 0.95 × S; (CM 2013 ) α × (1.05 × N 2013 × (CM 2011 /N 2011 )) (1-α) }<lb/></figure>

			<p>The intention in the latter case is to constrain any upcoding that may be performed simply to offset a<lb/> fall in the volume of care delivered. Thus, if the volume of care in 2013 is lower than in 2011, a hospital<lb/> that upcodes to offset that drop will be penalised. If the severity per case increases by more than 5%, then<lb/> the third term in the formula will be taken into account. The third term in the function MIN is an average<lb/> of the cases treated weighted by the severity of cases in 2013 and 2011.<lb/> Once the volume-based cap has been set, a revenue cap is calculated to ensure compliance with the<lb/> expenditure objective. In 2013, the formula for calculating the revenue cap was:<lb/> CAP REV 2013 = max {min <ref type="biblio">[</ref>1.07 × CM red × ITC 2011 ; CM red × TC 2013 ]; CM red × ITC 2011 }<lb/> Where<lb/> ITC 2011 = conversion rate for insurer i calculated as follows:<lb/> ITC 2011 = TR TOT2011 /CM TOT2011<lb/> Where TR TOT2011 = total reimbursement for the hospital in 2011 and CM TOT2011 = total volume for<lb/> 2011 (case mix)<lb/> And<lb/> TC 2013 = {(1-K) × [0.8 × ITC 2011 + 0.2 (∑ i=1 to n TC i ; 2011 × CM i ; 2011 /∑ i=1 to n CM i ; 2011 )] + (K × NTC)}<lb/> Where<lb/> K = coefficient set to ensure tariff convergence between insurers and hospitals; in 2013, it was 0.30<lb/> NTC = the national currency conversion rate (CZK 29 500)<lb/> And (∑ i=1 to n ITC i ; 2011 × CM i ; 2011 /∑ i=1 to n CM i ; 2011 ) represents the average point value in 2011 for a<lb/> hospital. The sum of payments received by the hospital is divided by all insurers (∑ i=1 to n ITC i ; 2011 × CM i ;<lb/> 2011 ) by the total case mix billed by the hospital (∑ i CM i ; 2011 ).<lb/> Thus, [0.8 × ITC 2011 + 0.2 (∑ i=1 to n TC i ; 2011 × CM i ; 2011 /∑ i=1 to n CM i ; 2011 )</figure>

			<p>] is a weighted average of the<lb/> rate of currency conversion or point value for insurer i in 2011 and the average currency conversion rate<lb/> for all insurers for that hospital.<lb/> TC 2013 therefore incorporates two convergence factors. A first conversion factor, namely the weighted<lb/> average of the point value paid by insurer i and the point value paid by all insurers. The second<lb/> convergence factor is linked to the presence of parameter K in this equation. Thus, TC 2013 is a weighted<lb/> average of the point value specific to one hospital and one insurer and the point value or currency<lb/> conversion rate at national level.<lb/> In the light of the various parameters outlined above, we can now understand the formula for<lb/> calculating revenue caps:<lb/></p>

			<table>CAP REV 2013 = max {min [1.07 × CM red × ITC 2011 ; CM red × TC 2013 ]; CM red × ITC 2011 }<lb/> First, let us explain min [1.07 × CM red × ITC 2011 ; CM red × TC 2013 ]</table>

			<p>. This formula implies that the<lb/> currency conversion rate in 2013 cannot be greater than 7% of the price paid by the insurer in 2011. Next,<lb/> by analysing the formula, we note that, in any event, the hospital&apos;s currency conversion rate cannot be less<lb/> than in 2011. It will be at least CM red × ITC 2011 .<lb/></p>
