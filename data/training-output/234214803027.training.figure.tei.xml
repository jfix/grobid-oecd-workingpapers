Labour adjustment costs can be interpreted as hiring and firing costs and price adjustment<lb/> costs as menu costs.

            <figDesc>Quadratic price adjustment costs reduce the elasticity of prices to current production costs and<lb/> introduce a forward-looking component into pricing decisions. Aggregate demand influences the current<lb/> level of output and employment because of the sluggish price adjustment. Both employment and price<lb/> adjustment costs generate gaps between actual output and the production level that would prevail under<lb/> perfectly flexible markets. 4 The marginal value of income<lb/> in equation (15) refers to intertemporal<lb/> optimisers only, because liquidity-constrained consumers do not own firms. Without adjustment costs,<lb/> , equation (15) reduces to<lb/> . The latter is the standard pricing rule<lb/> under monopolistic competition and flexible prices, when<lb/> are the marginal costs of production.</figDesc>

The elasticity of substitution between labour services<lb/> from Coenen et al. (2007) implies a 20% steady-state wage mark-up.
