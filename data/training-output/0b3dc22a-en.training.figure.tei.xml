            <figDesc>Climate change is projected to affect weather trends in Colombia. Based on historical weather data,<lb/> IDEAM has identified the following broad trends arising from climate change from this cycle (DNP, 2012;<lb/> IDEAM, 2012; IDEAM, 2015): rising temperatures, increased precipitation and shrinking glaciers. In the<lb/> future, temperatures are projected to continue increasing. Precipitation will decrease in the Caribbean and<lb/> Andean regions and increase in the central and northern Pacific region. One study suggests that the<lb/> likelihood of extreme El Niño events will increase in the future due to climate change (Cai et al, 2014).<lb/> Many studies have been conducted on the economic and social impacts of climate change in<lb/> Colombia, predominantly on an ad hoc basis. The most influential at the national level has been a joint<lb/> study on the Economic Impacts of Climate Change in Colombia (DNP-BID</figDesc>

            <figDesc>Senegal suffers from the effects of both two much and too little water. Droughts have been occurring<lb/> sporadically for several decades in Senegal, with eight severe droughts having occurred since 1977. The<lb/> drought in 2011 led to a decrease in grain production of 20% and groundnut production of 31%, exposing<lb/> around 800 000 people to food insecurity. Most of those affected depended on agriculture for their<lb/> subsistence. Droughts have been a key driver for migration from rural to urban areas (GFDRR, 2010). At<lb/> the same time, floods are a frequent occurrence in Senegal, and have affected around 400 000 to 600 000<lb/> people per year on average between 1980 and 2008 (GFDRR, 2014b). These floods are caused by heavy<lb/> rains making rivers overflow or accumulating on impermeable surfaces and causing damages in urban<lb/> areas such as Dakar and Kaolack. Storm surges also lead to salt-water intrusion into agricultural lands,<lb/> particularly in the Saloum Delta near the river Gambia.</figDesc>

            <figDesc>The Directorate of Environment and Classified Establishments has been supported since 2011 by the<lb/> National Committee for Climate Adaptation, a cross-ministerial consultative institution designed to raise<lb/> awareness about climate adaptation. Regional Adaptation Committees were created in 2012 with support<lb/> from UNDP to fulfil this role at the local level, in alignment with the government&apos;s desire to increase local<lb/> ownership of environmental issues. Communities acquired a major role in the implementation of<lb/> environmental policies and natural resource management, aided by the administrative reorganisation of<lb/> local communities according to eco-geographical zones in the 2014 Third Decentralisation Act<lb/> (MEDD</figDesc>

This fund is based within the environment ministry. The Ministry of Economics,<lb/> Finance and Planning and the CSE participate in the administration of the Fund (DCF, 2015; République<lb/> du Sénégal and UNDP, n.d). The fund is designed to take advantage of possible international partnerships<lb/> and funding agreements created by the Green Climate Fund. It also aims at improving the efficiency of<lb/> international aid in environmental programmes. The National Climate Fund raises around USD 60 million<lb/> per year (DCF, 2015).</figDesc>

These benefits include the protection of<lb/> nutritional intake and avoiding the need to sell productive assets.<lb/> ARC also mandates the preparation of an Implementation Plan prior to the disbursement of the<lb/> payout.
