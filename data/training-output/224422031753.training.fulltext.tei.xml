			<p>The purpose of this paper is to provide empirical analysis of the developments and determinants<lb/> of agricultural trade flows by determining whether the growth in agricultural trade has taken place at<lb/> the intensive or the extensive margin. This paper presents new work examining the evolution of agro-<lb/>food exports between 1996 and 2006 for 69 countries. The paper addresses the questions: have<lb/> agricultural exports during this period expanded more through the intensive margin (more exports of<lb/> established goods to traditional partners) or through the extensive margin (new trade flows in new<lb/> products and/or to new partners)? At the intensive margin, do richer countries export greater volumes,<lb/> or do they receive higher prices for their goods? At the extensive margin, are new trade flows the<lb/> result of an expanded variety of products or the result of exporting established products to more<lb/> destinations?<lb/></p>

			<p>Trade occurs because the parties that engage in the transaction find it beneficial. On the export<lb/> side, expanding markets enables the exploitation of comparative advantage, while firms can reduce<lb/> costs by increasing the scale of their production, improve productivity and increase producer surplus.<lb/> On the import side, welfare in enhanced through consumption of lower priced goods and through the<lb/> availability of a larger variety of goods. In this paper, the focus is on the export side of the ledger<lb/> although the reader should remember that the importer also benefits.<lb/></p>

			<p>Exports can grow as firms export more and/or at higher prices for the products they have been<lb/> producing to their existing partners (the intensive margin). Exports can also grow through market<lb/> development as firms export their existing products to new partners or through innovation, developing<lb/> new products and exporting them either to existing partners or to new markets (the extensive margin).<lb/> This study assesses the growth in agricultural trade from 1996 to 2006 and decomposes the<lb/> growth into the extensive and intensive margin. Three approaches are used on disaggregated<lb/> agricultural trade data for 69 exporting countries to determine the contribution of the margins to<lb/> growing agricultural exports. One is a cross sectional approach. This utilises a country&apos;s bilateral<lb/> export data at a given point in time and computes its intensive and extensive margin. This approach<lb/> allows one to answer the question: &quot; do richer countries export more agricultural products at the<lb/> intensive or extensive margin? &quot; In addition, the question of whether agricultural exports of richer<lb/> countries are higher quality can be ascertained.<lb/></p>

			<p>An alternative approach is more descriptive, using a country&apos;s bilateral export data to compare<lb/> performance in two points in time. By computing the change in exports between the two time periods<lb/> and decomposing that growth into the two margins, one can answer whether the growth in agricultural<lb/> exports for any exporter occurred mostly at the extensive or intensive margin. This abstracts from the<lb/> relative contribution of policy and other factors to that growth.<lb/></p>

			<p>The third approach used in the study is based on estimating a gravity-type equation to explain<lb/> bilateral exports. This approach explains bilateral trade flows by decomposing the total effect into the<lb/> extensive margin through explaining the change in trade flows from non-existing to positive flows and<lb/> the intensive margin by examining the change in flows that are positive throughout.<lb/> • From the cross section approach, the study finds that when agricultural value added (AVA)<lb/> is used to indicate a country&apos;s size or export potential, for every 10% increase in AVA,<lb/> agricultural exports (in 2006) increase by 5%. Most of the additional exports (53%) are at the<lb/> intensive margin, countries exporting more of the same set of products to existing partners.<lb/> But, when a country&apos;s GDP is used as a measure of its size or export potential, the results<lb/> suggest that richer countries export more agricultural products and they export more<lb/> products to more destinations, that is, they have a more diversified export basket with the<lb/> extensive margin accounting for 55% of their additional agricultural exports (in <ref type="biblio">2006</ref>). This<lb/> result may be due to the fact that more and more of agricultural exports are in processed<lb/> products that more closely resemble manufactured products. It also finds that firms in richer<lb/> countries export higher quality agricultural products obtaining an 18% price premium in<lb/> 2006.<lb/> • From the descriptive statistics, when the focus is on how agricultural exports have grown<lb/> over time, the study finds that the majority of the overall growth in agricultural exports for<lb/> all sampled countries was at the intensive margin, with firms selling more of their existing<lb/> goods to their existing partners. But, for 44 out of the 69 countries, the extensive margin<lb/> contributed more than 50% to the growth in agricultural export over the 1996 to 2006 period.<lb/> This implies that the extensive margin is important for many countries that are not among the<lb/> largest exporters. And, many of these exporting countries are developing countries<lb/> suggesting that they are diversifying their export basket.<lb/> • From the gravity-type approach, preliminary results from the study indicate that trade<lb/> frictions have a larger (absolute value) impact on trade flows than demand factors on both<lb/> margins. Additional agricultural exports are mostly generated by changes on the intensive<lb/> margin. Increasing trade flows at the extensive margin is difficult. Although this avenue of<lb/> export growth is statistically significant its contribution to the overall increase is small.<lb/> 1.<lb/> Thus, the importance of the extensive margin to growing agricultural exports depends on the<lb/> measure used. Nonetheless, all three methods indicate that the extensive margin contributes in various<lb/> degrees to the growing agricultural exports. This has implications on modelling trade reform. Models<lb/> that are not capturing this source of growth will underestimate the potential impacts from reform.<lb/> 2.<lb/> The preliminary results also highlight the importance of trade resistance or trade costs on the<lb/> existing trade flows and on the probability of forming new trading relationships. Although the analysis<lb/> abstracts from the many policy changes that occurred, it seems that there is a large pay-off to policies<lb/> that can reduce those frictions. In this analysis, distance was used to proxy these trading costs. Further<lb/> efforts to explicitly include trading costs such as tariffs, standards, informational costs, or<lb/> infrastructural impediments into the analysis may improve our understanding of their effects on trade<lb/> flows at the intensive and extensive margins. More detailed analysis at the individual product level<lb/> may also help illuminate the characteristics of those innovative products that develop (or not) into<lb/> major trade flows.<lb/></p>

			<head>EXTENSIVE MARGINS IN AGRICULTURAL TRADE<lb/> Introduction<lb/></head>

			<p>Trade occurs because the parties that engage in the transaction find it beneficial. On the export<lb/> side, expanding markets enables the exploitation of comparative advantage, while firms can reduce<lb/> costs by increasing the scale of their production, improve productivity and increase producer surplus.<lb/> On the import side, welfare is enhanced through consumption of lower priced goods and through the<lb/> availability of a larger variety of goods. In this paper, the focus is on the export side of the ledger<lb/> although the reader should remember that the importer also benefits. Firms that are engaged in<lb/> exporting tend to be larger, more productive and more efficient than firms in the same industry that do<lb/> not export. By exporting more, firms can become more productive and can realize economies of scale<lb/> through serving a larger market. But, there is information and other learning costs to exporting as<lb/> firms have to understand the various destination markets, tailor their products to satisfy local norms,<lb/> ship over greater distances, and overcome custom and other administrative costs. The benefits are<lb/> increased profitability for the firms and higher employment and other social benefits for the home<lb/> country. For the importing countries, additional availability and variety increase consumer welfare.<lb/> Exports can grow through increasing the volume of products, increasing their price (unit value),<lb/> or by exporting new products and developing new trading partners. Increasing exports through higher<lb/> volumes, at the intensive margin, can be an indication that a country is making the most of its<lb/> comparative advantage and firms in those industries are exploiting economies of scale and are<lb/> becoming more efficient. A potential downside is that overly relying on a fixed set of export goods<lb/> may lead to declining export prices from the expanded supply along with increased volatility from<lb/> exogenous shocks. In this light, a diversified export basket is presumed to minimize the variability of<lb/> export earnings while reducing the potential for declining terms of trade while encouraging<lb/> innovation. Creating new or higher quality products and developing new trading partners, can spur<lb/> productivity and economic growth. This distinction on how exports may grow has only recently<lb/> received attention in the literature. Most of the gravity-type of analyses estimating bilateral trade flows<lb/> have overlooked this distinction as estimates are based on data that only includes trade that is taking<lb/> place indistinguishable whether the data reflect trade in established products with existing partners<lb/> (the intensive margin) or trade in new products and/or to new partners (the extensive margin).<lb/> Comparative static and other non-gravity models used to assess effects of trade or other reforms also<lb/> abstract from the effects of policy reform on export variety.<lb/> Distinguishing whether export growth is predominantly at the intensive or extensive margin, in<lb/> addition to providing a better understanding of the dynamics of growth and insights into productivity<lb/> and innovation, can also provide richer analysis of the benefits or gains from trade liberalisation,<lb/> giving insights on gains that are missing from conventional models that abstract from this distinction.<lb/> For example, recent findings by <ref type="biblio">Feenstra and Kee (2007)</ref> indicate that Mexico and China have<lb/> expanded the varieties exported to the US following tariff reductions in the US. Similarly, <ref type="biblio">Debaere<lb/> and Moshashari (2005)</ref> for a wider set of countries also find that their export basket to the US<lb/> increased following lower US import tariffs. Furthermore, they report that countries differ in the<lb/> variety of goods they export and also in the range of countries with which they trade. Moreover, the<lb/> sets of countries and goods change over time and vary more than traditional models would indicate.<lb/> Whether trade grows at the intensive or extensive margin matters because the welfare<lb/> implications of policy reform can differ. Expanding exports at the intensive margin can drive down the<lb/> price of these goods on the world market, worsening a country&apos;s terms of trade. In CGE models such<lb/> as GTAP, these terms of trade effects are significant. If, on the other hand, additional exports are<lb/> generated through the extensive margin, adverse terms of trade effects may not materialize. Rather<lb/> than sliding down the demand curve for their goods, growing at the extensive margin implies<lb/> exporting more goods to more markets and an outward shift in demand. Models not incorporating the<lb/> extensive margin may underestimate the effects of trade reform. Included in this category are partial or<lb/> general equilibrium models that are based on the Armington assumption of product differentiation as<lb/> well as models that assume homogeneous products. Trade in many partial equilibrium models tends<lb/> not to be modelled explicitly (usually represented as the difference between demand and supply)<lb/> hence, abstracting from distinctions about product variety and trading partners, two means for trade at<lb/> the extensive margin.<lb/> Below, we examine the relative contribution of the intensive and extensive margin to the change<lb/> in agricultural exports of 69 major exporters. Have their agricultural exports expanded through<lb/> increases in the volume exported or through providing an expanded set of products to new trading<lb/> partners during 1996 to 2006? As discussed below, there are alternative approaches to analysing this<lb/> question. We employ several of them to provide a richer understanding of the relative contribution of<lb/> each margin to agricultural exports during this period. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to<lb/> look at the extensive and intensive margin of agricultural exports for such a large number of<lb/> agricultural exporters.<lb/></p>

			<p>The next section discusses the different approaches to analysing trade at the extensive and<lb/> intensive margin. This is followed by a description of the data used, a discussion of the main findings<lb/> while the last section provides some conclusions.<lb/></p>

			<head>How is the intensive and extensive margin measured?<lb/></head>

			<p>Among the recent trade literature focused on distinguishing the source of trade growth between<lb/> the extensive and intensive margins, researches have utilised different approaches to address the issue.<lb/> One approach has focussed on developing measures of the extensive or intensive margins and then<lb/> assessing how tariffs, other costs to exporting, or economic size, among others, affect this measure.<lb/> Examples include <ref type="biblio">Brendon and Newfarmer (2007)</ref>, Debaere and <ref type="biblio">Mostashari (2005)</ref>, Dennis and<lb/> Shepherd (2007), Feenstra and Kee (2007), and Hummels and Klenow (2002). Another more<lb/> descriptive approach compares a country&apos;s bilateral exports at two points in time to determine the<lb/> relative contribution of each margin to the country&apos;s export growth. Examples include Brendon and<lb/> Newfarmer(2007) and Amurgo-Pacheco and Pierola (2008). In another alternative, researchers, rather<lb/> than measuring the extensive or intensive margin explicitly, employ gravity-type equations but focus<lb/> on the appearance of new trading relationships. Examples include <ref type="biblio">Felbermayr and Kohler (2006)</ref>,<lb/> Helpman, Melitz and Rubinstein (2008), and Amurgo-Pacheco and Pierola (2008). All approaches<lb/> tend to use highly disaggregated trade data for the empirical implementation of their analysis.<lb/></p>

			<p>Researchers that have examined the intensive and extensive margin by explicitly measuring each<lb/> margin have used several different measures to calculate the extensive and intensive margin. One of<lb/> the simplest ways is to define the extensive margin as the simple count of the number of products that<lb/> a country exports, with the intensive margin as the average exports per product. This is an unweighted<lb/> measure, treating a product with exports valued at USD one thousand equal to a product with exports<lb/> valued at USD one million. This measure was used by Debaere and Mostashari (2005) and Dennis and<lb/> Shepherd (2007) in their analysis of the intensive and extensive margin for the US and EU<lb/> respectively. Another measure of the extensive margin treats exports of any product to each<lb/> destination as an observation. The extensive margin is the count of exports of each product and<lb/> market, while the intensive margin is the exports per product and market combination. This measure<lb/> also gives equal weight to &quot; small &quot; markets and products and &quot; large &quot; products and markets.<lb/> A more sophisticated measure of the extensive margin derived from consumers maximizing their<lb/> utility, was developed by Feenstra and Kee (2007). This measure was derived from a constant<lb/> elasticity of substitution (CES) aggregator function. Their margin is a relative measure and is<lb/> interpreted as the share of total imports of the products exported by any one country. They apply their<lb/> measure of &quot; variety &quot; or extensive margin using US import data at the HS-10 digit level for exports<lb/> from Mexico and China. They use US import data because it provides greater detail for measuring<lb/> varieties, but it is not internationally comparable. Hence, the other dimension of the extensive margin,<lb/> trade with new partners, is missing.<lb/> For this analysis, in the first part the extensive and intensive margins are measured explicitly and<lb/> we use simple regression analysis to decompose exports into the intensive and extensive margin. In<lb/> measuring the intensive and extensive margin, we follow the definition provided by Hummels and<lb/> Klenow (2002) henceforth HK. The methodology is based on incorporating new varieties into a<lb/> country&apos;s price and quantity index. The price index is effectively lowered when the set of goods<lb/> expand (HK). Of special interest is the extensive and quality margin. Exporters systematically selling<lb/> large quantities at high prices may be an indication that these exporters produce higher quality goods.<lb/> The methodology allows one to answer the question; do richer countries export more agricultural<lb/> products at the intensive or extensive margin, and do they export higher quality goods? It does not<lb/> identify the factors that generate these trade flows.<lb/> HK define the intensive margin for any exporting country j as,<lb/> where χ j = nominal exports of country j, χ Wis = world exports to country i in product category s, and<lb/> X jis = the set of products and markets where exports from country j are positive i.e., χ jis &gt; 0 where χ jis<lb/> are nominal exports of country j to country i in product category s. Essentially, the equation shows that<lb/> the intensive margin is an indication of the exporting country&apos;s share of world exports in those<lb/> products and markets in which it exports. Note that the information from a country&apos;s bilateral exports<lb/> are summarised into a single measure per exporter.<lb/></p>

			<p>The extensive margin for any exporting country j is defined as,<lb/> with χ W representing nominal world exports (from all countries to all countries). This is a measure of<lb/> the fraction of world exports that occur in those products and markets in which country j exports. This<lb/> definition is similar to that developed by Feenstra and Kee (2007). If a country concentrates all of its<lb/> exports in a small number of products in a few countries, all other things equal, it will have a higher<lb/> intensive margin and a lower extensive margin. If that country spreads its exports thinly over many<lb/> markets, it will have a lower intensive margin and a higher extensive margin. Note that this measure of<lb/> the extensive margin is a comparison of exports for countries at a point in time. This is a static<lb/> measure, summarising a country&apos;s bilateral exports at a point in time. It indicates the depth and<lb/> breadth of a country&apos;s export profile, but does not reflect the growth of that country&apos;s exports over<lb/> time.<lb/> The second and third approached differ from the one above by examining the growth of the<lb/> margins for a given country over time in contrast to a cross country comparison of the margins at a<lb/> given point in time. The second approach used in this study is more descriptive. After computing a<lb/> country&apos;s export growth between 1996 and 2006, trade flows are decomposed into those flows that are<lb/> persistent throughout the period, those that have expired or are no longer active and those trade flows<lb/> that are new at the end period but did not exist in the beginning. Thus, the growth is split into the<lb/> extensive and intensive margin providing an explicit measure of the relative contribution of each<lb/> margin to that country&apos;s growth. For this purpose, the intensive margin for any country j is defined as<lb/> the change in country j&apos;s exports of existing products (old products) to established trading partners<lb/> (old partners) minus the cessation of trade in old products (dead or expired products) to current<lb/> partners. The extensive margin for country j is defined as exports of products that country j had not<lb/> previously exported (new products) either to new partners (new products, new partners) or to existing<lb/> partners (new products, old partners) plus exports of existing products to new partners (old products,<lb/> new partners). Variations of this definition were used by Brenton and Newfarmer (2007) and Amurgo-<lb/><ref type="biblio">Pacheco and Pierola (2008)</ref>. This approach, unlike the others, identifies the countries with the largest<lb/> growth in agricultural exports during the time period and of that growth, how much is at the extensive<lb/> margin relative to the intensive margin. Additionally, countries are grouped into different categories to<lb/> discern group differences, if any.<lb/> The last approach used in this paper is based on research that examines the intensive and<lb/> extensive margin without measuring them explicitly. Rather, the issue is addressed more generally by<lb/> specifying a gravity-type equation to explain bilateral trade flows but within the context of a problem<lb/> of missing or censored data. The point of departure for the extensive margin is that there are trading<lb/> relationships that, for a variety of reasons are not materialised at one point in time, but which may or<lb/> may not materialise at a later stage. That is, zero trade in time period one may become positive in<lb/> period two. The extensive margin in this case is defined in terms of the zero trade flows becoming<lb/> positive while the intensive margin is in terms of trade that is positive throughout the period. In this<lb/> approach, bilateral trade flows are explained using a gravity-type equation with zero trade flows<lb/> explicitly in the data.</p>

			<table>Researchers that have employed this approach include Amurgo-Pacheco and<lb/> Pierola (2008), Felbermayr and Kohler (2006), and Helpman, Melitz and Rubinstein (2008). To assess<lb/> the intensive and extensive margin with this approach we utilise a Tobit and a Probit estimation<lb/> technique to estimate bilateral exports in the presence of zero trade.<lb/> Data<lb/> Bilateral agricultural exports 1 from 1996 to 2006 are from UN COMTRADE accessed through<lb/> the World Bank&apos;s World Trade Integrated Solution (WITS) system. The number of countries reporting<lb/> their exports varies. In 2006, exports from more than 130 economies were available through this<lb/> system when</table>

			<p>we downloaded the data. However, data for each of these countries is not available for all<lb/> of the variables of importance for the entire period of interest. And, since we are interested in bilateral<lb/> trade, the resulting database would have been too large for computational purposes. As it is, even with<lb/> the reduced sample size, we reached the computational limits of our software even though there are<lb/> countries with missing data for some variables in some years. Our dataset is based on 69 2 of those<lb/> exporting countries and uses their export data at the most detailed level possible that is internationally<lb/> compatible, trade at the HS-6 digit level during 1996 to 2006. 3 For any exporting country, the data<lb/> reports the value (in US dollars) and quantity of each product (at the HS-6 digit level) exported and for<lb/> each destination. The selected countries were chosen based on their importance in agricultural exports.<lb/> All countries with at least USD 2 billion in agricultural exports in 2006 were included. This criterion<lb/> identified 47 economies with agricultural exports above USD 2 billion, and these 47 countries<lb/> represented about 94% of world&apos;s total agricultural exports in 2006. Additional countries with<lb/> agricultural exports below USD 2 billion that were added to the sample included all remaining OECD<lb/> members (Finland, Iceland, Norway, and the Slovak Republic), and the remaining countries that are<lb/> candidates for accession to the OECD, (Estonia, Israel, and Slovenia. Chile and Russia are also<lb/> included as each had more than USD 2 billion in exports). Because we are interested in how<lb/> agricultural exports have evolved over time, by necessity, our sample will constitute the largest<lb/> players. To round out the sample, 8 additional lower middle income countries along with 8 low<lb/> income countries were chosen to provide a broad geographic representation and to reduce selection<lb/> bias in terms of income or of being a large agricultural exporting country. Most of the 16 additional<lb/> countries (that are not large agricultural exporters in an absolute sense), had a comparative advantage<lb/> in agriculture in the OECD study &quot; Patterns in Agriculture and Food <ref type="biblio">Trade: 1985-2004 &quot; (OECD 2007</ref>).<lb/> With the additional countries, the coverage of agricultural exports increased to 97% of world&apos;s total in<lb/> 2006 (complete listing of the economies in the sample is in Appendix <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>). The results presented<lb/> below based on this sample, therefore, can be considered representative. Because we calculate a price<lb/> and a quantity index for the analysis, export data with missing quantity units are dropped from the<lb/> sample. This has a relatively small impact on the overall data that were used. Depending on the year,<lb/> missing quantity units account for 1% to 3% of the total value of agricultural exports.<lb/> This bilateral export dataset is uni-directional. That is, it reports exports from country j to<lb/> importing country i in product category k with j i k indexing all exporters, their trading partners and<lb/> export basket. A reciprocal trade flow from i to j in product k may or may not exist for any i j k. That<lb/> is, there are possible trading relationships that have not materialised. In typical export data such as the<lb/> one we use, these data do not exist. And, until recently, most estimates of trading behaviour have<lb/> ignored these data. But, given our interest in the extensive and intensive margin, we cannot ignore<lb/> these &quot; missing &quot; data. The analysis of the growth in exports at the extensive margin based on a gravity-<lb/>type equation, depends on assessing how these non-existing trading relationships (the zeros) develop<lb/> 1<lb/></p>

			<p>Goods included in this category are products in HS Chapters 1-24 except fish and several other categories<lb/> in Chapter 29 to 53 as defined in the WTO.<lb/></p>

			<head>2<lb/></head>

			<p>In the early years of the analysis, Belgium and Luxembourg reported trade data as a single country.<lb/> For consistency, their data were aggregated in subsequent years.<lb/> into positive trade thus, growing at the extensive margin. Consequently, for this part of the analysis we<lb/> complete the initial database by generating the &quot; missing &quot; data. Because we are dealing with trade at<lb/> the HS-6 digit level, this greatly expands the dataset which reduces our ability to conduct some of the<lb/> estimations that are described below.<lb/> In addition to the export data, we collected data on each exporting country&apos;s GDP (measured in<lb/> current USD or in purchasing power parity exchange rates), each country&apos;s total labour force, its<lb/> agricultural labour force, its agricultural value added (AVA, measured in current USD or as a percent<lb/> of GDP), its fertilizer use, its arable land (measured as either as a percent of total area or hectares per<lb/> person), and its agricultural machinery. These data were obtained from the World Bank&apos;s World<lb/> Development Indicators except for agricultural labour force which were obtained from the FAO.<lb/> Unfortunately, data were not available for all countries and all variables in every year. Finally, data on<lb/> variables typically found in gravity models such as bilateral distance between country i and j, (one<lb/> measure of resistance to trade), as well as information on whether they share a common border<lb/> (contiguity), they have similar language, or shared colonial relationships were obtained from Centre<lb/> d&apos;Études Prospective et d&apos;Informations Internationals (CEPII).<lb/> Export data from COMTRADE are reported under different nomenclatures. The harmonised<lb/> system was chosen because it contains the most disaggregate product detail consistent across all<lb/> reporters. The original classification started in 1988. But, the system undergoes periodic updating,<lb/> changing product codes and description, probably to reflect changing product characteristics. This has<lb/> occurred in 1996, 2002, with the latest in 2007. Given the period of the analysis, <ref type="biblio">(1996-2006</ref>), the HS<lb/> 1996 nomenclature is the most appropriate providing a consistent set of data. However, many reporters<lb/> did not switch to the HS 1996 nomenclature until after 1996. Rather than comingling export data from<lb/> two different nomenclatures, 1996 export data are based on the HS 1988/92 nomenclature with<lb/> subsequent years based on HS 1996 nomenclature. 4 The changing nomenclature does not affect the<lb/> results when the intensive and extensive margins are calculated based on the HK methodology<lb/> (because they are based on cross sectional analysis). But, it does have implications for the results in<lb/> the later section which is based on changes over time.<lb/></p>

			<p>Another point to remember about the trade data and the extensive margin is that the classification<lb/> at the 6-digit level may still be too aggregate to pick-up new products or quality differences and the<lb/> reader should bear this in mind when interpreting the results. Many countries use a finer<lb/> disaggregation to characterise their exported goods. 5 Thus, there are products that are traded but are<lb/> not picked up at the 6-digit level because they fall in categories where some trade is taking place, and<lb/> as stated above, may be one of the reasons for the changing nomenclature. The newly traded goods<lb/> that are observed in our dataset are those that shift from an implicit zero to a positive number either<lb/> because it is a new product or because it has found a new destination. Thus, this level of<lb/> disaggregation, systematically underestimates the importance of the newly traded goods (Amurgo-<lb/>Pacheco and Pierola).<lb/></p>

			<head>4<lb/></head>

			<p>In some cases, countries made the switch even later. In order to maintain a consistent set of reporters<lb/> for the entire period, their export data were switched to the HS 1996 nomenclature when it became<lb/> available.<lb/></p>

			<head>Cross sectional results for the extensive and intensive margins<lb/> Results for all merchandise exports<lb/></head>

			<p>Trade analysts have observed and international trade theory confirms that, ceteris paribus, larger<lb/> economies trade more than smaller economies. But, this empirical result can be explained via different<lb/> trade theories. That is, trade theories differ as to how larger economies trade more. One set of theories<lb/> based on national product differentiation, postulate that larger economies trade larger volumes of a<lb/> given set of goods while another strand, based on monopolistic competition, postulates that larger<lb/> economies trade a larger number of goods than smaller economies (HK). The question is, do larger<lb/> economies trade more at the intensive margin (more of a given set of goods as for example national<lb/> product differentiation such as Armington), or at the extensive margin (more goods as under<lb/> monopolistic competition models)?<lb/></p>

			<p>HK address this question for overall trade using data from 1995. In this section we narrow down<lb/> the same question and focus on whether larger economies export more agricultural products at the<lb/> intensive or extensive margin. This section draws heavily on the HK methodology. HK utilize detailed<lb/> (HS-6 digit) UNCOMPTRADE data on exports to compute the margins in Equations 1 and 2 in 1995<lb/> for 110 exporters to 59 partners to answer this question for total merchandise trade. They verify the<lb/> robustness of their results using US trade data at the HS-10 digit level. Here we use their methodology<lb/> to decompose each country&apos;s exports into the product of the extensive and intensive margins in order<lb/> to answer the question: do countries that export more, ship larger volumes of their goods 6 (intensive<lb/> margin), or do they ship a larger set of goods to more markets (extensive market)? In addition, we<lb/> decompose the intensive margin into price and quantity components to evaluate whether more exports<lb/> correspond to more units, or higher priced units.<lb/></p>

			<p>In this section, utilising the definition of the intensive and extensive margin (equations 1 and 2),<lb/> we answer the question: by how much agricultural exports increase as a result of changes in economic<lb/> size, labour force or average productivity, and, of this, how much is at the extensive relative to the<lb/> intensive margin? Furthermore, following HK, we are able to distinguish how much of the growth in<lb/> the intensive margin for larger economies is due to changes in export prices relative to changes in the<lb/> quantity exported. Note that this is not an exercise to describe the factors that determine trade, rather<lb/> to discriminate how exports and margins differ between countries with different levels of income or<lb/> workers.<lb/></p>

			<p>In order to examine whether at the intensive margin larger economies export more as a result of<lb/> higher prices or higher quantities, following HK we calculate the Fisher ideal price, (FIEP j ) (and<lb/> quantity FIEQ j ) index for each exporter j with j = 1,2,..69. These are quality adjusted price and<lb/> quantity indexes. The essential idea is that a rise in the extensive margin is equivalent to a fall in price<lb/> (HK).<lb/></p>

				<formula>1/2<lb/> *<lb/> 1/2<lb/> 6<lb/></formula>

			<p>The terms &quot; goods &quot; and &quot; products &quot; are used interchangeably in the report and they refer to exported<lb/> items as described at the HS-6 digit level.<lb/></p>

			<p>where q jis is the quantity of exports of product s from country j to country i, p jis is the price of good s<lb/> exported from j to i measured by the unit value (= χ jis / q jis ), q wis is the quantity of world exports of<lb/> product s to country i and p wis is the price of good s in country i from all sources (=χ wis / q wis ). The<lb/> export price index summarises the extent to which an exporter&apos;s prices are high or low relative to other<lb/> prices in the same partner for the same product.<lb/></p>

			<p>A Fisher ideal quantity index can also be calculated analogously to the price index above, but<lb/> since the intensive margin is the product of the price index times the quantity index, one can compute<lb/> the implicit quantity index as,<lb/></p>

				<formula>4)<lb/> FIEQ j = IM j /FIEP j<lb/></formula>

			<p>where FIEQ j is the Fisher Ideal Export Quantity index for country j.<lb/></p>

			<p>Before presenting our results, we replicate HK <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> below as a basis for comparison. Each<lb/> row represents an estimated equation with overall exports, the intensive margin and the extensive<lb/> margin as the dependent variables. HK relate each margin for total merchandise trade to a country&apos;s<lb/> size, measured by its GDP as well as its components, workers and output per worker. HK used these<lb/> two specifications to estimate each equation using Ordinary Least Squares (OLS). In the first<lb/> specification, economic size (Y j ) measured by GDP based on purchasing power parities is regressed<lb/> against each of the dependent variables with the results given in column one. The second specification<lb/> includes two independent variables; output per worker (Y j /L j ) and the number of workers (L j ) are used<lb/> to explain the variation in each dependent variable. Their results are rather good for such a simple<lb/> model. GDP explains 77% of the variation of a country&apos;s overall exports with an elasticity close to<lb/> one suggesting that an economy twice the size exports twice as much. The variation of the intensive<lb/> and extensive margins is also rather well explained by GDP explaining more than 60% of the<lb/> variation. Because OLS is a linear estimator, the coefficients of the intensive and extensive margin<lb/> sum to the coefficient of overall exports and one can compute the relative contribution of each margin<lb/> to the total (this is given below the estimated coefficient of each margin). The estimated elasticities<lb/> suggest that countries that are twice as large export about one-third more at the intensive margin with<lb/> two-thirds occurring at the extensive margin. That is, of the additional exports of larger countries most<lb/> of it is through exporting more goods to more countries.<lb/></p>

			<p>Estimates from the second specification indicate that economies with twice the output per worker,<lb/> but with the same number of workers, export almost 150% more with almost three-fourths coming<lb/> from the extensive margin. Their results clearly demonstrate the importance of the extensive margin in<lb/> explaining the larger exports of bigger and more productive countries.<lb/></p>

			<head>Results for exports of agricultural products<lb/></head>

			<p>HK&apos;s analysis was based on data for 1995. For our analysis, we attempted to generalise their<lb/> methodology to take a dynamic view by examining the margins over the 11 year period 1996 to 2006.<lb/> We pooled the data into a panel for the 69 exporters from 1996 to 2006. Using the same specification<lb/> as HK but applying them to the agricultural sector, the dependant variables were: a) total agricultural<lb/> exports, b) intensive margin, and c) extensive margin as given in equations 1 and 2. The explanatory<lb/> variables were an economy&apos;s agricultural value added (AVA j ) measured in USD, and its components,<lb/> AVA divided by the size of its agricultural labour force (AVA j /AL j ), a measure of average<lb/> productivity, and the size of the economy&apos;s agricultural labour force (AL j ).<lb/> Unfortunately, the results for the pooled data were insignificant and are not reported. But, for<lb/> each of the 11 years, estimates based on the cross sectional data were undertaken and these results<lb/> were robust suggesting that the decomposition of exports into the margins is more appropriate for<lb/> cross sectional analysis. To avoid clutter, while giving a sense of whether the relationship between the<lb/> intensive and extensive margin has remained constant over time, results are presented for each of three<lb/> years, 1996, 2000, and 2005 or 2006 (depending on data availability). These give an indication of<lb/> whether there has been a change in the magnitude of the estimated parameters over time.<lb/></p>

The results for agricultural value added per<lb/> worker and agricultural labour force are for 2005 because data for agricultural labour force at the time<lb/> of the analysis were not available for 2006.<lb/></p>

			<p>Comparing our results for 1996 to those from HK for 1995 (<ref type="table">Table 1</ref>), one notices that our<lb/> specification explains a smaller proportion of the variation of exports and the margins. Although the<lb/> coefficient of AVA is positive and significant, AVA does a fairly poor job, explaining only 11% of the<lb/> variation in agricultural exports. In addition, the response of agricultural exports to changes in AVA<lb/> (the elasticity) is about a fourth the size reported in HK for GDP and all exports. This implies that a<lb/> country with twice the agricultural value added exports about 25% more agricultural products. In<lb/> contrast, HK find that a country with twice the GDP exported twice as much.<lb/></p>

			<p>Similarly, agricultural exports as a function of average agricultural labour productivity<lb/> (AVA/AL) and total agricultural labour force (AL) perform rather badly explaining only 10% of the<lb/> variation in agricultural exports in 1996. The results indicate that economies with twice the<lb/> agricultural output per worker (but with the same overall agricultural labour force) export 28% more<lb/> while those with twice the agricultural labour force (but with the same average productivity) export<lb/> 20% more. These elasticities are considerably lower from those reported in HK.<lb/></p>

			<figure>All variables are in natural logs. AVAj is agricultural value added for exporter j; ALj is total<lb/> agricultural labor force in exporter j. Percentages describe the contribution of each margin to the<lb/> overall export elasticity. Results for agricultural value added per worker are for 2005 because data<lb/> for agricultural labor force not available for 2006 at time of the analysis.<lb/></figure>

			<p>Turning our attention to the 1996 results for the extensive and intensive margins, it appears that<lb/> AVA or AVA/AL and AL are not highly correlated with the margins explaining a small part of the<lb/> variation. Furthermore, in each of the estimated equations, one of the explanatory variables is<lb/> statistically insignificant. Again, these results are in stark contrast to HK based on overall labour force<lb/> and output per worker. Concentrating on the results with AVA as the only explanatory variable (since<lb/> the other specification has insignificant parameters), they suggest that most (52%) of the additional<lb/> exporting done by economies with larger AVA occurs on the intensive margin (within each product-<lb/>market category) and 48% on the extensive margin (exporting more products to more countries).<lb/> Comparing this finding for agricultural exports with those in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> for all products, suggests that<lb/> large agricultural economies tend to focus on exporting more of the same goods to the same partners<lb/> in contrast to the pattern for exports in general.<lb/></p>

			<p>The rest of <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>			<figure>reports the results for the years 2000 and 2006(05). The results indicate that<lb/> the explanatory power of the exogenous variables has improved considerably over the interval. The<lb/> ability to explain the variation in agricultural exports and each of the two margins has improved<lb/> relative to 1996, and all of the parameters in each of the estimated equations are significant at the 1%<lb/> level in 2006. It also appears that economies with larger AVA and AL improved their ability to export<lb/> agricultural products as the elasticity for each variable more than doubled compared to their 1996<lb/> values. Thus, in 2006, economies with twice the AVA exported 53% more agricultural products.</figure>

			<p>More<lb/> than half of the additional exports occurred at the intensive margin (exporting more of the same goods<lb/> to the same partners) with 47% occurring at the extensive margin (exporting more goods to more<lb/> partners). Thus, economies with larger agricultural sector (as measured by AVA) and larger<lb/> agricultural labour force (columns 1 and 4 <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>) export more of their agricultural goods at the<lb/> intensive margin which is different from the results for overall exports which are dominated by<lb/> exporting at the extensive margin. Product innovation and developing new partners seems to be less<lb/> important to firms in countries with large AVA or AL. However, countries with high agricultural<lb/> output per worker (average productivity) seem to behave differently. Most (58%) of the additional<lb/> agricultural exports from countries with larger agricultural output per worker (but with the same<lb/> overall agricultural labour force) occurs at the extensive margin (exporting more products to more<lb/> markets). It seems that firms in these countries are more innovative, developing new products and<lb/> discovering more trading opportunities around the globe.<lb/> We attempted to expand the model by including additional sector specific variables such as<lb/> agricultural land supply (absolute as well as a share of the physical size of a country), arable land as a<lb/> share of agricultural land, fertilizer use, and the number of tractors as additional indicators of an<lb/> exporting country&apos;s ability to produce agricultural goods (and hence expand export supply). These<lb/> results are not reported because these variables proved to be insignificant in explaining agricultural<lb/> exports (and the margins).<lb/> Given the relatively poor performance of the estimated equations reported in <ref type="table">Table 2</ref> and<lb/> reflecting the fact that in recent years agricultural (as defined at the WTO) exports comprise products<lb/> that are further removed from the farm gate (processed and semi processed products), agricultural<lb/> specific variables may not (and the results above confirm) represent the best variables to explain<lb/> agricultural exports. Consequently, the equations were re-estimated using GDP and total labour force<lb/> as explanatory variables. The results are presented in <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<p>An exporting country&apos;s GDP seems to explain agricultural exports better than AVA as indicated<lb/> by much larger adjusted R 2 values in each of the three years. Furthermore, the estimated elasticity is<lb/> much larger and more stable over time. GDP is also a better explanatory variable with regard to the<lb/> intensive and extensive margin. Total labour force and output per unit of labour (columns 3 and 4) also<lb/> perform better than comparable estimations with agricultural labour force and agricultural output per<lb/> unit of agricultural labour. These results suggest that agricultural trade, as it&apos;s increasingly dominated<lb/> by processed products, is more like trade in manufactured products and is more dependent on general<lb/> economic variables rather than sector specific.<lb/> Focusing on the results with GDP as the explanatory variable (<ref type="table">Table 3</ref> column 1), the value of<lb/> agricultural exports for economies with twice the income is 70% more with the results from the<lb/> extensive and intensive margin indicating that most of the additional exports occur on the extensive<lb/> margin (more goods to more markets). This is interesting because it is similar to the results from HK<lb/> but directly opposite to the results presented in <ref type="table">Table 2</ref> and in the next sections. These results suggest<lb/> that firms exporting agricultural products from rich economies without necessarily large agricultural<lb/> value-added, behave similarly to firms exporting all other products. Or, it may be that agricultural<lb/> products are not primarily exported by agricultural firms. For example, New Zealand&apos;s agricultural<lb/> goods are highly traded contributing a substantial portion to New Zealand&apos;s overall export revenue.<lb/> But, firm-level data from New Zealand indicate that most of the agricultural products exported from<lb/> All variables are in natural logs.

			<p>Zealand are undertaken by firms that are in wholesaling or processing (Fabling and Sanderson<lb/> (2008).<lb/> It was mentioned above that there are alternative measures of the extensive margin. How do the<lb/> various measures illuminate the results? <ref type="table">Table 4</ref> reports the results of the various measures of the<lb/> extensive margin, for a three year interval 1996, 2000, and 2006. The first row for each year<lb/> reproduces the results for the extensive margin presented in <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>. This is the count of the<lb/> combination of exported goods and markets, weighted by their share in world agricultural trade from<lb/> equation 2. The second row for each year reports the results when the extensive margin is computed as<lb/> a simple count of the combination of exported goods and markets to which the exporter ships. In terms<lb/> of equation 2, this equals the number of products in X jis for which x jis is greater than zero. This gives<lb/> an equal weight to all exported goods and markets regardless of their size. The results indicate that<lb/> larger economies ship a higher number of products to more markets, and, comparing row 2 to row 1,<lb/> the number of products-markets rises faster with GDP than the trade-weighted equivalent measure.<lb/> This finding is robust across time and suggests that firms in larger economies are more likely to export<lb/> to &quot; small &quot; product-markets, a finding consistent with that from HK for all trade.<lb/></p>

			<p>The third row is based on calculations of the extensive margin based on products rather than<lb/> products and markets. In terms of equation 2, the decomposition based on the set X jis being replaced<lb/> by the set X js which is the set of products in category s in which x jis is positive for some importers.<lb/> This metric is based on the set of goods that firms in an economy export and not on the destination,<lb/> and is weighted by their importance in trade. That is, if two countries export the same number of<lb/> goods, they will have the same extensive margin in row 3, but if one of them exports to more markets,<lb/> it will have a higher extensive margin in row 1.<lb/></p>

			<p>The extensive margin defined in terms of products accounts for 13% of the greater volume of<lb/> exports of larger economies in 1996, dropping to 10% in 2006. Comparing the first and third rows<lb/> around 30% of the extensive margin comes from exporting more agricultural products, while 70%<lb/> comes from shipping a given set of goods to additional destinations. The last row for each year in<lb/> <ref type="table">Table 4</ref> defines the extensive margin in terms of a simple count of the number of goods exported (the<lb/> number of elements in X js ), giving an equal weight to all exported products regardless of their<lb/> importance in trade. The results show that a country with twice the GDP exports anywhere from 21%<lb/> to 19% more goods (depending on the year). Comparing rows three and four, the number of goods<lb/> exported (row 4) rise faster with GDP than the number of products weighted by their importance in<lb/> trade (row 3), indicating that larger economies are more likely to export goods with &quot; small &quot; market<lb/> share.<lb/></p>

			<p>The results for output per labor and total labour (columns 3 and 4) also reveal that the extensive<lb/> margin based on simple counts (whether of products and markets or only of products) rises faster than<lb/> their weighted counterparts suggesting that more productive countries for a given labour force, or<lb/> those with a larger labour force are more likely to export more products and to more product market<lb/> combinations that are relatively &quot; small &quot; .<lb/></p>

			<p>The results in <ref type="table">Table 4</ref> indicate that the definition of the extensive margin and which explanatory<lb/> variables are examined go a long way towards determining its relative contribution to agricultural<lb/> exports. It seems that extensive margins based on the definition that excludes the impact of trading<lb/> partners (whether or not the measure is weighted by exports) are lower. This indicates that for<lb/> agricultural exports, discovering new partners may have a larger impact on agricultural exports<lb/> relative to developing a new product, a finding that is consistent with the finding in the next section.<lb/> Turning our attention to the intensive margin, are the additional agricultural exports of larger<lb/> economies of higher quality (do firms from rich countries receive higher prices) or do they export<lb/> larger volumes? The intensive margin is broken into its price and quantity components and results are<lb/> reported in <ref type="table">Table 5</ref>. The results are not very satisfactory explaining very little of the variation in the<lb/> intensive margin suggesting that variables other than the price and quantity indexes are important in<lb/> explaining the intensive margin.

On the other<lb/> hand, the insignificance of the quantity component indicates that the export volumes for economies<lb/> that are more productive or have a larger labour force are no different from those of other countries.<lb/></p>

			<p>Subsequent to the drafting of this report, we discovered another article by Hummels and <ref type="biblio">Klenow<lb/> (2005)</ref> addressing the same question as their 2002 article but using a somewhat different methodology<lb/> to compute the margins and the price and quantity indexes. Although the estimated parameters were<lb/> somewhat different (the new methodology slightly lowered the share of the extensive margin), the<lb/> basic conclusion remained intact. Richer countries export more and most of their additional exports<lb/> are through the intensive margin. And, richer economies export higher volumes at somewhat higher<lb/> prices.<lb/> For completeness, we also employed HK&apos;s modified methodology to re-estimate the equations on<lb/> the data for 2006. Here we briefly summarise the results. 7 We find that the estimated parameters with<lb/> the modified methodology are somewhat different from those reported above, but they all remain<lb/> 7<lb/></p>

			<p>Complete results available upon request.<lb/> All variables are in natural logs. GDPj is gross domestic product for exporter j measured in<lb/> purchasing power parities. Lj is total labor force in exporter j. Percentages describe the contribution<lb/> of each margin to the overall export elasticity.<lb/> highly significant. The modified methodology reduces the contribution of the extensive margin on the<lb/> additional exports of larger economies. When size is measured by AVA, in 2006, the intensive margin<lb/> contributes 78% of the additional exports of larger agricultural economies (in contrast to 47% in <ref type="table">Table<lb/> 2</ref>). When GDP is the measure of economic size, the intensive margin contributes 56% of the additional<lb/> exports of richer countries (in contrast to 45% in <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>). The relative contribution of price and<lb/> quantity to the intensive margin also changes somewhat. With the modified methodology, richer<lb/> economies export 29% higher quantities (compared to 15%) at 5% higher prices (compared to 18%).<lb/> These results indicate that the methodology used to calculate the margins plays an important role in<lb/> determining their relative share to total exports. The modified methodology removed the ambiguity on<lb/> the relative contribution of the extensive margin based on whether size is measured by AVA or GDP<lb/> as in both cases, the intensive margin contributes the larger share. This result is more consistent with<lb/> those presented below. But regardless of the methodology used to generate the results, the extensive<lb/> margin is a source of export growth and should not be ignored.<lb/></p>

			<p>To summarize the results from this section, agricultural exports seem to respond to the same<lb/> general overall conditions in an economy as do exports from all other sectors. Agricultural sector<lb/> specific metrics do not seem to have the same explanatory power and the response of agricultural<lb/> exports to changes in those variables is smaller. The extensive margin for richer economies is mostly<lb/> from expanding the number of destinations rather than the number of products. This result is supported<lb/> by the findings in the next section and is similar to the findings in HK for all merchandize exports. It<lb/> also seems that after controlling for the level of the labour force, agricultural exports expand<lb/> considerably faster for the more productive economies, those with higher output per worker.<lb/> Looking at the three snapshots, <ref type="biblio">1996, 2000, and 2006, it seems</ref> that the importance of the<lb/> extensive margin for richer countries, although still comprising more than half of their larger exports,<lb/> has diminished with the intensive margin gaining importance. With the modified methodology from<lb/> HK(2005), the intensive margin contributes more than half of the additional exports of richer<lb/> countries. That is, richer economies are exporting more of the same products to their current partners,<lb/> a result which differs from total merchandise exports.<lb/> Finally, richer or more productive economies receive higher prices on the world market for the<lb/> agricultural products they export compared to other countries. The results from this analysis suggest<lb/> that in 2006, the export volume for countries with twice the income is 15% more (29% with the<lb/> modified methodology) than other countries and they receive prices that are 18% (5% with the<lb/> modified methodology) higher. The price premium is even more evident for the intensive margin of<lb/> countries that are more productive.<lb/></p>

			<p>Even though its importance may have diminished, the extensive margin is a source for growth for<lb/> agricultural exports. Richer or more productive economies have the breadth to offer most of the<lb/> agricultural products traded on the world markets, and the depth to reach most destinations. But firms,<lb/> not countries, trade. The results therefore indicate that firms from larger economies have the<lb/> wherewithal to develop new products and the distribution skills to get those products to most<lb/> destinations. These firms are relatively more efficient than firms selling the same products from other<lb/> countries to sell small consignments to markets that import relatively few goods in small volumes, and<lb/> they have the development skills to produce and market higher quality goods enabling them to extract<lb/> higher prices for their products.<lb/></p>

			<p>The results from this section may have implications on how to model agricultural trade. Models<lb/> that only focus on national product differentiation such as those based on Armington assumptions of<lb/> product differentiation do not include an extensive margin for export expansion and may understate<lb/> welfare gains from say additional liberalisation as they miss the gains from exports of new products to<lb/> new partners (HK). This is a dilemma of these types of models, how to move from zero to positive<lb/> trade.<lb/></p>

			<head>The extensive margin and its contribution to the growth of agricultural exports<lb/></head>

			<p>The results from the section above decomposed a country&apos;s share of world exports into an<lb/> intensive and extensive margin in an attempt to discern differences between rich and poor countries.<lb/> This enables one to examine whether the value of exports of larger economies is higher for each good<lb/> they export (the intensive margin), and within the intensive margin, whether the higher value is due to<lb/> more volume or higher prices or whether richer countries trade a larger set of goods with more<lb/> partners (the extensive margin). This provided an indication of an economy&apos;s relative export<lb/> performance at a given point in time. The approach is less well suited (as indicated by the poor results<lb/> with the panel data) to address questions of the contribution of the extensive margin to the growth in<lb/> agricultural exports over a given time interval.<lb/> In this section, using the same set of 69 exporting countries, we provide information on how<lb/> agricultural exports have changed over the 11-year period, segregating the change into the intensive<lb/> and extensive margin. Here, rather than computing an indicator variable we utilise each trading<lb/> relationship for each of the 69 exporters to compute the change in their agricultural exports from 1996<lb/> to 2006. This abstracts from the reasons for the change such as policy changes, supply shortfalls, or<lb/> population and income growth. In this section, the intensive margin is calculated by identifying the set<lb/> of commodities and partners that were exported at the beginning and ending periods and calculating<lb/> the change in the exported value. The extensive margin is calculated by identifying new products that<lb/> were exported at the end of the period which were not exported at the beginning regardless of whether<lb/> these new products were exported to totally new partners or to previously existing partners (new<lb/> products to new markets or to old markets), plus identifying old products (those that existed in the<lb/> beginning period) but are exported to new partners in the end. Decomposing the total growth in<lb/> exports requires an additional category, products that were exported at the beginning of the period but<lb/> are no longer exported. These disappearing or dead products are included in the intensive margin by<lb/> <ref type="biblio">Brenton and Newfarmer (2007)</ref>, whereas they seem to be included in the extensive margin by<lb/> Amurgo-Pacheco and <ref type="biblio">Pierola (2008)</ref>, and Felbermayr and Kohler (2006). Since our interest in the<lb/> extensive margin is the establishment of new trading relationships, we include the disappearing or<lb/> dead products in the intensive margin.<lb/></p>

			<p>When describing the data we explained why we had to use two different nomenclatures for the<lb/> export data and stated that it did not make a difference to the results reported above. However, the<lb/> results in this section are influenced by this choice since we are linking the products that were traded<lb/> in the beginning period with those traded in the later period. This concordance should not affect the<lb/> results on overall growth, but probably affects the results for the extensive and intensive margin. As a<lb/> reminder, we made the decision in order to have a longer time horizon for the most countries in the<lb/> database. Since all countries in the dataset were treated similarly, the hope is that whatever biases were<lb/> introduced by the decision, they were not systematic but random across the various reporters and thus<lb/> not biasing the results in any particular way. Nonetheless, as already mentioned, trade data at the 6-<lb/>digit level probably underestimate the extensive margin.<lb/></p>

			<figure>World agricultural exports increased 56% during the 1996 to 2006 period 8 , with 91% of the<lb/> growth accounted for by the 69 countries in the database. The country with the largest overall increase<lb/> in agricultural exports was Brazil whose exports increased by around USD 22 billion followed by<lb/> 8<lb/></figure>

			<p>This is based on total exports excluding exports with missing quantity units. Agricultural exports<lb/> including data with missing quantities grew slightly higher (57%).<lb/> Germany with an increase of close to USD 21 billion and Netherlands with an increase of some<lb/> USD 14 billion. Annex <ref type="table">Table 2</ref> contains the list of countries and the growth in their agricultural<lb/> exports listed in descending order of their overall increase. The table also shows the change in the<lb/> value of the various margins for each country. Notice that agricultural exports increased by<lb/> USD 10 billion or more for only seven countries, five of whom are OECD countries, while 26<lb/> countries saw their agricultural exports expand by less than USD 1 billion. The gross intensive margin<lb/> reports the results for trade flows for products and partners that existed in both time periods. Germany<lb/> and the Netherlands had the largest gain in exporting existing products to current partners. For several<lb/> countries however, this flow was negative. Expired products column shows the value of the trade<lb/> flows that existed in the beginning period but not at the end. The difference between gross and expired<lb/> products is the net intensive margin or the intensive margin reported here.<lb/> The results from section 1 showed a relationship between a country&apos;s output per worker and its<lb/> agricultural exports. <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref> below illustrates. This is a scatter diagram showing the change in a<lb/> country&apos;s agricultural exports between 1996 and 2006 mapped against output per worker (average<lb/> productivity) in 2006. This shows that many of the countries in the sample are bunched around values<lb/> with low average productivity and relatively small increases in agricultural exports while countries<lb/> with relatively strong expansion in exports tend to have high average productivity (Brazil seems to be<lb/> an outlier).<lb/> Figure 1.

Segregating the sample into the 29<lb/> OECD countries from the other 40, the OECD countries captured 65% of the additional exports<lb/> confirming earlier results that richer economies export more. It may also be illuminating to aggregate<lb/> countries into various groupings to discern commonalities and differences</table>

			<p>across the various income<lb/> or other groupings. One possible grouping is to examine whether the agricultural export sector of<lb/> current members of the OECD are similar to or different from the group of five countries that are on<lb/> track to become new members (the applicants or APPL) from those five countries with enhanced<lb/> engagement (EE) the six LDCs and the other developing countries. 10<lb/></p>

			<p>Agricultural exports for the five applicant countries increased by USD 5.7 billion (2.5% of the<lb/> total increase) while the five enhanced engagement countries expanded their agricultural exports by<lb/> USD 44.2 billion (19% of the total), the six LDCs expanded their exports by USD 0.6 billion (0.25%)<lb/> and the remaining countries expanded their exports by USD 29.6 billion (13% of the total) (<ref type="table">Table 6</ref>).<lb/> How is the change in agricultural exports divided between the intensive and extensive margins<lb/> and does it differ for countries in different groups? Overall, 52% of the growth in agricultural exports<lb/> is at the intensive margin meaning that the growth has occurred through increased trade in already<lb/> established relationships. Other researchers examining the growth in overall trade among the intensive<lb/> and extensive margin confirm that most of the growth is at the intensive margin (<ref type="biblio">Brenton and<lb/> Newfarmer (2007)</ref>, Helpman, Melitz and Rubinstein (2008), and Amurgo-Pacheco and <ref type="biblio">Pierola<lb/> (2008)</ref>). But the results also indicate that not an inconsequential 48% of the growth is at the extensive<lb/> margin, that is, as a result of new trading arrangements, either through new products to established<lb/> partners or new products to new partners or through established products to new partners.<lb/> This finding is consistent with some of the findings from the previous section (based on the<lb/> modified HK (2005) methodology or size based on AVA with the HK (2002) methodology) but<lb/> somewhat at odds with other findings from the first section where the results indicated that most of<lb/> the additional agricultural exports of richer (based on GDP) countries are through the extensive<lb/> margin. These two findings may not be contradictory however. The results in the first section are<lb/> based on the analysis of whether in a given year additional exports of large countries occur at the<lb/> extensive or intensive margin. The results from the first section indicate that larger economies have<lb/> larger extensive margins because they are more likely to export to &quot; smaller &quot; economies and in<lb/> &quot; smaller &quot; product categories. In this section, the analysis is based on the total growth in exports<lb/> between two points in time and then disentangled the contribution of each margin to the total. Exports<lb/> to &quot; smaller &quot; economies in &quot; smaller &quot; product categories are not likely to contribute to large increases in<lb/> exports since they are &quot; small &quot; . In both cases however, the results indicate that new trading<lb/> relationships are important as evidenced by the fact that they account for almost half of the growth in<lb/> agricultural exports.<lb/></p>

			<p>Interestingly, this average result differs considerably among the various countries (Annex<lb/> <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>). For many countries, the extensive margin contributes less than half of the growth in their<lb/> exports. In Mexico&apos;s case, the extensive margin contributed only 7% to the overall growth in exports,<lb/> probably because of Mexico&apos;s reliance on exporting to NAFTA partners, Canada and the US. At the<lb/> other extreme, the extensive margin was the only source for growth in many countries, contributing<lb/> more than 100% of the growth because the value of the trade of their existing trading relationships<lb/> declined, that is, the intensive margin was negative.<lb/> For the six LDCs, the growth of their agricultural exports over this time interval came exclusively<lb/> from the extensive margin (<ref type="table">Table 6</ref>). Trading new products to new partners added some<lb/> USD 1.1 billion in new export earnings. But, the intensive margin for the LDCs rather than adding to<lb/> their export growth, subtracted from it. For this group of countries, the growth at the intensive margin<lb/> was a negative USD .5 billion meaning that they sold half a billion less of their existing products to<lb/> their established partners. It seems that firms in these six LDCs have been able to diversify their<lb/> agricultural export basket offering more products to more partners.<lb/></p>

			<p>The extensive margin is also important to the countries that are applicants for OECD<lb/> membership, on average contributing almost 70% to their additional exports (<ref type="table">Table 6</ref>). Again, there is<lb/> large variation among the countries in this group (Annex <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>) with Israel on the one extreme with<lb/> all of its additional exports coming via the extensive margin, and Chile on the other extreme with only<lb/> 47% of her additional exports coming via the extensive margin. The 24 countries that do not belong to<lb/> any of the groupings also expanded most of their exports through the extensive margin, which is,<lb/> exporting new products to new partners and/or exporting old products to new partners. As shown in<lb/> <ref type="table">Table 6</ref>, on average, 65% of their additional exports were generated by the extensive margin. The data<lb/> suggest that the exporting firms in the larger developing and least developed countries are pursuing an<lb/> export diversification strategy, expanding their exports to new markets and enlarging their export<lb/> basket , that is, by the extensive margin.<lb/> In contrast, the extensive margin has contributed somewhat smaller portion to the growing<lb/> agricultural exports of the enhanced engagement countries. Half of their export growth occurred at the<lb/> extensive margin, trading more goods with more partners and half came through the intensive margin<lb/> exploiting existing trading relationships. For the OECD countries, the intensive margin is the most<lb/> important source of growth, accounting for 58% of the growth in agricultural exports. That is, OECD<lb/> countries were able to increase their exports by exploiting their established trading relationships, with<lb/> only 42% of their additional exports coming through exporting new goods to new partners.<lb/></p>

			<p>Perhaps this result is not surprising, given that enhanced engagement and OECD countries are<lb/> among the largest exporters of agricultural products, shipping to most destinations thereby exporting<lb/> most of the products to most of the countries already in 1996. The scope for further market<lb/> development is more limited for these countries. It may also be the case that many of the newer<lb/> trading relationships start out on a rather small scale as exporting firms gather market information and<lb/> expand sales slowly, thus, some of these new trading relationships may not be generating large<lb/> revenues.<lb/> Turning our attention to changes in the intensive margin, <ref type="table">Table 6</ref> distinguishes between gross<lb/> intensive margin (change in export value of same products to the same markets which can be positive<lb/> or negative) and expired (or dead) products (trading relationships that no longer exist in 2006) to<lb/> calculate the net intensive margin reported above. The results in <ref type="table">Table 6</ref> indicate that expired trading<lb/> relationships are important, subtracting a hefty sum from the total. The data indicate that strictly<lb/> looking at the value of trade in old products to old destinations (gross intensive margin in <ref type="table">Table 6</ref>)<lb/> they contributed some USD 182 billion to additional exports for the countries in the sample. But,<lb/> disappearing products and markets (the couplet of products and markets that expired after 1996) were<lb/> valued at more than USD 63 billion leading to the net intensive margin of USD 119 billion.<lb/></p>

			<p>The results confirm that the extensive margin is important, contributing substantially to the<lb/> overall additional agricultural exports of the countries in our sample. <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref> shows the distribution<lb/> of the extensive margin for the countries in our sample. It shows that the extensive margin for 19<lb/> countries (out of the 69) generated more than 90% of their additional exports, while it contributed<lb/> between 70% and 90% of the additional exports for an additional 10 countries. But, for 11 countries,<lb/> the contribution was less than 30% of the total.<lb/></p>

			<figure>Our results here differ from those of Brenton and Newfarmer (2007) and Amurgo-Pacheco and<lb/> Pierola (2008). Both of these reports find that the extensive margin is of lesser importance than the<lb/> intensive margin for developing countries. One reason for the differences may be the composition of<lb/> the sample countries (Brenton and Newfarmer include 99 developing countries). While there is<lb/> considerable overlap with the country coverage in this report with Amurgo-Pacheco and Pierola<lb/> (2008) (they examine 24 countries) it is not clear how or whether they account for expired trade in<lb/> their definition of the margins. As shown in the table above, excluding expired trade when calculating<lb/> the intensive margin greatly enhances the contribution of the intensive margin to the overall growth.<lb/> And, if trade that no longer exists is excluded from calculating either margin, summing the two<lb/> margins will overstate the total change in exports.<lb/></figure>

			<p>Since total growth is the sum of the extensive and intensive margin, the flip side is that the<lb/> intensive margin is of lesser importance in generating additional foreign earnings for a large number of<lb/> countries. Additional growth is not just the result of exporting more of the same set of goods to the<lb/> same set of countries. This finding has a positive connotation in terms of evaluating policy reform and<lb/> welfare enhancements from those reforms. The results suggest that countries with high extensive<lb/> margins may be less susceptible to declining terms of trade. They are less concerned with the<lb/> possibility of lower prices in order to expand their exports as their export basket contains new goods<lb/> or are destined to new markets. The implication is also that developing countries may be more<lb/> diversified than previously thought. But, it may also mean that there are challenges to develop models<lb/> that include the extensive margin when attempting to analyse the implications of policy reform.<lb/></p>

			<figure>Figure 2. Number of countries and the contribution of the extensive margin to the growth of their exports<lb/></figure>

			<p>As mentioned above, the extensive margin refers to establishing new trade flows through<lb/> developing new products and/or cultivating new trading partners or by expanding the trading<lb/> relationships with established partners. Within the extensive margin, which particular avenue has been<lb/> more successful in increasing a county&apos;s exports? We have decomposed the extensive margin into four<lb/> components to address this question. Type 1(NPND) extensive margin involves developing New<lb/> Products or lowering the trade costs of products that have not been exported previously and marketing<lb/> them to New Destinations. These are probably the most difficult trade flows for exporting firms in any<lb/> country to develop since they involve products and markets that are totally new and require upfront<lb/> investment to identify target consumers in unfamiliar markets. Type 2 (NPOD) extensive margin is<lb/> similar to Type 1 extensive margin, but the New Products are marketed to familiar destinations (Old<lb/> Destinations) in the sense that other exporting firms from the country of origin have exported Old<lb/> Products to these partners in the past. It&apos;s not clear a priori the difficulty of establishing these trade<lb/> flows. Although firms in the exporting country are familiar with the trading partners, the products are<lb/> new requiring a certain amount of investment in market development and identifying target<lb/> consumers. Type 3 (OPND) extensive margin involves extending the market reach of established<lb/> (Old) Products by exporting them to New Destinations. These trade flows are the flipside of Type 2<lb/> flows. In this case, firms are selling Old Products and presumably have experience in marketing them,<lb/> but they are targeting unfamiliar, New Destinations. Type 4 (EPTD) extensive margin is similar to the<lb/> intensive margin in that it involves exports of old products to old destinations (but in order to make the<lb/> distinction these trade flows at the extensive margin are referred to as Existing Products to Traditional<lb/> Destinations). The distinction is that the intensive margin refers to trade flows that exist in both time<lb/> periods, whereas for the extensive margin, these are new trade flows. The trade flows in this<lb/> classification are new because the product-partner combination did not exist in the past even though<lb/> the exporter shipped these products to other destinations, and the partners imported other goods from<lb/> this particular exporter.. Since firms in the exporting country are familiar with the importing market<lb/> and they have marketed the products in the past to other destinations, these trade flows may be easier<lb/> to establish. 11<lb/> <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref> reports the value of the extensive margin for all sampled countries from Appendix<lb/> <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>, and discriminates the contribution of each type of extensive margin to the total (Annex<lb/> <ref type="table">Table 3</ref> reports the contribution of each type of extensive margin to the overall total for each exporter).<lb/> This shows that overall growth in trade at the extensive margin totalled USD 110 billion. Of this, new<lb/> flows with exports of Existing Products to Traditional Destinations (Type 4 EPTD) was the most<lb/> important while the smallest contribution came from Type 1 (NPND) extensive margin which is<lb/> establishing totally new trading relationships in both the product space and the destination space.<lb/></p>

			<p>What is striking about <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref> is that developing new trading partners either by exporting old or<lb/> established products, and even more so through developing new products, seems to be very difficult.<lb/> Exports through these two nodes generate about 7% of the total extensive margin. Further inquiry is<lb/> needed to identify reasons for the small contribution to the extensive margin from developing new<lb/> partners. The results suggest that establishing a beachhead in a new destination is difficult, probably<lb/> requiring large initial investments in cultivating, promoting, and targeting consumers in an unfamiliar<lb/> environment. The results from Type 2 extensive margin indicates that the small contribution is not<lb/> related to problems in marketing new products because when they&apos;re offered to established partners,<lb/> they generate 41% of the extensive margin. And, new trade flows with traditional partners (Type 4)<lb/> which involves offering products that are new for that partner (expanding the variety of the export<lb/> basket) in established partners has the largest share. This implies that firms that have established<lb/> beachheads in other countries are able to utilise their knowledge of the local market to sell more<lb/> products whether or not those products are New. In contrast, the establishment of new trading<lb/> relationships with new destinations pose special challenges for firms. These results, coupled with the<lb/> results of exporting at the intensive margin seem to suggest that once firms from the country of origin<lb/> are in a market, they can more readily expand exports. In contrast, developing new partners imposes<lb/> greater challenges.<lb/> Finally, does the country of origin play a role as to which of the four nodes is the largest<lb/> contributor new trade flows? Rather than discussing the results for each country (which are available<lb/> in Annex <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>), results are provided for various country groupings, and are presented in <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<head>The extensive and intensive margins from gravity-type estimates<lb/></head>

			<p>The process generating the results above is very data intensive and requires lining up the data to<lb/> identify existing, expiring and new trading relationships, providing an overview on the relative<lb/> contribution of the margins to the overall growth in agricultural exports. The approach, however, does<lb/> not examine how or why the trading relationships evolve as they do, nor does it provide any<lb/> theoretical underpinnings. Why do firms export the set of products and why and how do they maintain<lb/> existing relationships and how do they develop their new trading partners? As Amurgo-Pacheco and<lb/> Pierola (2008) point out, the &quot; new-new &quot; trade theory attempts to answer this question.<lb/> Implicit in the analysis of the extensive margin as defined in the section above is that there are<lb/> zero trade flows that are ignored by the trade data as typically reported. That is, either because a<lb/> product has not yet been developed or because trade costs are high, potential trading relationships do<lb/> not materialise. 12 Once the product is developed or trading costs fall however, a previously non<lb/> existing relationship evolves with positive trade flows. Essentially the question is why do zero trading<lb/> relationships become positive? This is the crux of the question for those researchers examining the<lb/> extensive margin without explicitly measuring it. Thus, the trade data is in fact censored with<lb/> unobserved zero values. 13<lb/> Many of the researchers who try to correct the problem with zero trade, start with the theory of<lb/> the firm, postulating that firms will begin to export once they overcome the costs of entering foreign<lb/> markets. The formal model is not presented here, since it is well documented elsewhere. Interested<lb/> readers can consult the original Melitz (2003) article that lays out the framework or many other papers<lb/> that use the framework, including Helpman Melitz and Rubinstein (2008) or Amurgo-Pacheco and<lb/> Pierola (2008). One of the strengths of the framework is that although it is based on theory of the firm,<lb/> it does not require firm-level data for the empirical estimation. Since firm-level data across a large<lb/> spectrum of countries and time is not readily available, the ability to distil the information using the<lb/> more readily available trade data is a plus. The basic outcome of the formal model is to derive a<lb/> gravity-type equation. When estimating the equation, differences among researchers centres on what is<lb/> the better econometric technique to use while accounting for the zeros. They all conclude that OLS<lb/> estimates are not appropriate but differ on what method to use. Among the alternatives is the Poisson<lb/> Pseudo-Maximum-Likelihood, and the Tobit, (both of which handle truncated or censored data), non-<lb/>linear least squares, or two-step Heckman. This includes estimating a Probit function in the first step to<lb/> determine the probability of a zero trading relationship switching to non-zero while the second step<lb/> estimates the bilateral trade flow equation conditional on the probability in the first step.<lb/></p>

			<figure>We use the Tobit 14 estimation techniques to examine the intensive and extensive margins for<lb/> agricultural trade. The Tobit is one of the most common estimation techniques used to deal with<lb/> 12<lb/> This abstract from the fact that some of the zero trade flows in the data may not be reported or because<lb/> some zeros may be missing values.<lb/> 13<lb/> These researchers also tend to criticise conventional estimates of trade flows with the conventional<lb/> gravity equation because these tend to ignore zero trade flows leading to biased results. Since it&apos;s not<lb/> the purpose of this paper to review alternative specifications or methods for estimating gravity<lb/> equations, these are not discussed.<lb/> 14<lb/> The Poisson Pseudo-Maximum Likelihood (PPML) technique is another approach to estimating<lb/> models with censored data. Unlike the Tobit, the PPML generates consistent estimates in the presence<lb/> of heteroskedasticity (Armugo-Pacheco and Pierola 2008). Given our interest in the intensive and<lb/> extensive margins, we nevertheless employ the Tobit technique. Results from Armugo-Pacheco and<lb/> Pierola (2008) indicate this is not a serious problem.<lb/></figure>

			<p>censored data. Given our interest in the intensive and extensive margin, the Tobit model was chosen<lb/> because it gives flexibility to disentangle what happens at both margins at the same time that it takes<lb/> into account the censoring structure of the data. The advantage of explicitly accounting for the zero<lb/> trade with the Tobit is that it naturally decomposes trade into the intensive and extensive margin with<lb/> the intensive margin determined from the part of the distribution with positive trade and the extensive<lb/> margin determined when the zero switches to non-zero. We also estimate the model with the Probit to<lb/> estimate the effect of the explanatory variables on the probability of trading (i.e. switching from non-<lb/>trade (zero) to trade) as a robustness check.<lb/> It should be pointed out that the results here are preliminary. Initially the possibility to include<lb/> tariff and other policy information in the estimation was explored but it was not successful due to data<lb/> problems. Although we could identify applied tariffs when there was a trading relationship, this was<lb/> not possible when there was no trade. Additional data work is needed to identify the appropriate tariff<lb/> in such cases. Feenstra and Kee (2007), and Debaere and Mostashari (2005) were able to obtain the<lb/> necessary data because they did not deal with the problem of zero trade while Dennis and Sheperd<lb/> (2007) were able to obtain the necessary data because, even though they explicitly dealt with zero<lb/> trade, their dataset included exports from many countries but to only one destination, (the EU).<lb/> Nonetheless, we present the results as an indication of overall findings and for comparisons with the<lb/> findings above. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to apply this method to agricultural trade.<lb/> For this part of the analysis, we needed to generate a square data matrix, that is, each product<lb/> from each exporter has potential destination all trading partners. There are more than 200 trading<lb/> partners in any one year in the dataset. In order to make the dataset somewhat manageable, we restrict<lb/> the set of partners only to the 69 exporters. Nonetheless, the dataset contains some 35 million records<lb/> (98% of these are zeros) 15 and is so large, that it was not computationally feasible to pool the data into<lb/> a panel dataset to estimate the model over the 11 years. Rather, as was the case for Armugo-<ref type="biblio">Pacheco<lb/> and Pierola (2008)</ref> we resorted to estimating one equation for each exporter. But, because of<lb/> estimation problems we provide results for 53 exporters out of the sample of 69 countries (with 4 of<lb/> the 53 obtained by bootstrapping 16 ). For 16 exporters the Tobit maximum likelihood function did not<lb/> converge.<lb/></p>

			<head>Main findings<lb/></head>

			<p>The initial model took into account many of the gravity-type variables such as contiguity,<lb/> common language and colonial ties. All except the GDP and distance were insignificant in most cases<lb/> and therefore they were dropped in the final specification. Thus, for each exporter the estimated<lb/> equation was<lb/> 15<lb/></p>

			<p>The magnitude of the zeros in the dataset is an indication of potential trading opportunities that have<lb/> not materialised.<lb/></p>

			<head>16<lb/></head>

			<p>For these four countries (Brazil, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and South Africa), the model is<lb/> estimated 100 times using repeated random samples from five importing countries. Point estimates for<lb/> intensive and extensive margins are obtained as the means of the 100 replications, and the variation<lb/> around the mean is calculated as the standard deviation of the same replications.<lb/></p>

			<p>Where odit<lb/> V is the US dollar (current) value of agricultural exports from country o (origin)<lb/> to country d (destination) of product i (for each 6-digit category) in year t;<lb/> t<lb/> d<lb/> GDP is the GDP in<lb/> current US dollars of the destination country in year t;<lb/> od<lb/> DIST is the distance between country-o and<lb/> country-d, defined as the simple distance in kilometres between capitals; SD is a sector dummy (HS-2-<lb/>digit), to control for sector factors; CT is a country (importer) dummy (to capture all unobserved or not<lb/> included bilateral trade costs and factors) and TD a time dummy to control for time variations.<lb/></p>

			<p>As the equation indicates, conforming to the gravity-type specification requires converting the<lb/> variables into logarithms. This creates problems when the observation is zero. Therefore, as others<lb/> have done, for example Amurgo-Pacheco and <ref type="biblio">Pierola (2008)</ref>, we shift all trade values by one unit.<lb/> This changes the mean by one unit but does not affect the variance.<lb/> We estimated the model above using the Tobit technique in Stata. The estimated raw coefficients<lb/> from the Tobit do not have a particularly interesting economic meaning, because they are simply the<lb/> effect of the independent variable on the &quot; latent &quot; (unobservable) dependent variable. These results are<lb/> not reported. For interested readers they are available upon request. Our interest is in deriving from<lb/> these parameters the intensive and extensive margin. As reported in Berndt (1991) and in Amurgo-<lb/><ref type="biblio">Pacheco and Pierola (2008)</ref>, McDonald and Moffitt (1980) developed a formula to compute marginal<lb/> effects from the estimated latent variables which have an economic interpretation. Their equation is.<lb/></p>

			<p>For our purposes, the equation shows the total effect on agricultural exports due to a change in say the<lb/> importing country&apos;s GDP.<lb/></p>

			<p>The total effect is decomposed into two factors. The first part of the expression on the right hand<lb/> side represents the change in the value of expected or average exports for the goods already traded,<lb/> weighted by the probability that there is already positive trade (the intensive margin). The second part<lb/> of the expression is the change in the probability of exporting weighted by the expected value of the<lb/> products that are already traded (the extensive margin). The second part of the expression thus shows<lb/> the probability of exporting a more diversified basket of goods. The Stata software has a routine that<lb/> computes each of these marginal effects. The results are reported in Annex <ref type="table">Table 4.<lb/></ref> With a few exceptions, the coefficients are statistically significant (at the 99% confidence level)<lb/> and have the expected sign (the larger the GDP of the destination country the higher the level of trade<lb/> and the more diverse the export basket, while for partners that are further apart, trade between them is<lb/> lower and less diverse). The results also indicate that the marginal effects are higher for the intensive<lb/> margin than for extensive margin (see Annex <ref type="table">Table 4</ref>).<lb/> Comparing our results for agricultural trade to those reported in Amurgo-<ref type="biblio">Pacheco and Pierola<lb/> (2008)</ref> for all trade, it appears that the results are comparable for the set of countries that are common<lb/> to both studies. The estimated marginal effects at the intensive and extensive margin for GDP and<lb/> distance in both cases are reasonably close with the marginal effects of GDP and distance on total<lb/> trade somewhat higher (in absolute value) compared to their effect on agricultural trade. 17 And the<lb/> results from both studies suggest that the intensive margin is much bigger than the extensive margin in<lb/> almost all cases.<lb/> This result appears to contradict the results reported in Annex Table 2 and <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref> which show<lb/> that for many countries, the extensive margin is the larger contributor to the expanded agricultural<lb/> trade. This apparent contradiction may stem from the fact that the results above disaggregated the total<lb/> change in agricultural exports between the two periods into the intensive and extensive margin<lb/> whereas the estimated results from the export equation above show the effect of changes in the size of<lb/> the import market and distance on the intensive and extensive margin. Although consistent with some<lb/> of the findings from the first section above, the results in this section are not comparable to those<lb/> results because: 1) those estimates were based on total, not bilateral agricultural trade, 2) we were not<lb/> able to pool all the exporters together for these results, 3) the results in <ref type="table">Table 3</ref> are based on a different<lb/> definition of the extensive margin, and 4) the estimation ignored trade with zero values<lb/> As equation 6 above shows, the total effect on trade from a change in an exogenous variable, say<lb/> the partners GDP, is the sum of two effects (the intensive and extensive margin reported in Annex<lb/> <ref type="table">Table 4</ref>). For example, a doubling of the GDP of importing countries increases Argentina&apos;s exports by<lb/> 29%. Most of this increase is through Argentina exporting more of its existing agricultural products to<lb/> existing partners. Only 8% of the additional exports are in new goods and or to new partners.<lb/> Similarly, reducing transport or other trading frictions proxied by distance by 10% would increase<lb/> Argentina&apos;s exports by 5.5%. Again, most of this additional trade would be through Argentina<lb/> exporting more of the same set of goods to the same partners (the intensive margin). Only 7% of the<lb/> additional exports would be through the extensive margin. The results for the remaining countries in<lb/> Annex Table 4 can be interpreted similarly.<lb/></p>

			<p>Rather than discussing the results for each country individually, aggregated results for groups of<lb/> countries are discussed to highlight differences, if any, between OECD countries and others.<lb/> Unfortunately, because results for some of the applicant and LDC countries could not be estimated,<lb/> grouping the countries as in the previous section is not possible. Rather, we focus on the OECD<lb/> countries, those in the enhanced engagement group and the rest. The following table presents a<lb/> summary of the weighted (by the population) average marginal effect (similar results are obtained<lb/> when the average is weighted by the exporters GDP).<lb/></p>

			<figure>Table 7. Average marginal effects of a change in agricultural exports on the intensive and extensive<lb/> margin (from Tobit estimates)<lb/> Intensive Margin Extensive Margin Intensive Margin Extensive Margin<lb/> OECD<lb/> 0.231<lb/> 0.049<lb/> (0.450)<lb/> (0.081)<lb/> Enhanced<lb/> Engagement<lb/> 0.176<lb/> 0.024<lb/> (0.294)<lb/> (0.034)<lb/> Other<lb/> 0.082<lb/> 0.005<lb/> (0.292)<lb/> (0.008)<lb/> Partners GDP<lb/> Importer Distance<lb/></figure>

			<p>The results in <ref type="table">Table 7</ref> show that on average, the intensive margin is larger (absolute value),<lb/> contributing a larger percentage to the change of a country&apos;s exports in each group, and that trade<lb/> frictions (with distance as a proxy) between partners has a larger impact on trade than demand (with<lb/> GDP as a proxy). The marginal effects of both explanatory variables are larger for OECD members<lb/> compared to the other groupings. 18 For firms in the average OECD country, a doubling of the partner&apos;s<lb/> 18<lb/></p>

			<p>This finding is similar to the finding above that richer countries export more at both margins.<lb/> GDP leads to a 23% increase in additional exports of products that were already traded and a 5%<lb/> increase in the variety of the products exported whereas firms in the average enhanced engagement<lb/> country expand their &quot; old &quot; exports about 18% while expanding export varieties by 2%. The remaining<lb/> countries are on average even less responsive to changes in the income of their trading partner<lb/> expanding &quot; old &quot; exports by only 8% while exports in new products expand by barely 1%. It seems that<lb/> firms in OECD countries are on average better able to respond to changes in marketing opportunities<lb/> in export markets both by exporting more of the traditional products and by developing and offering<lb/> new products to their partners. And, their advantage is much more pronounced on the extensive<lb/> margin (offering new products) with an average marginal response more than double the response<lb/> from firms in other countries.<lb/> But, distance seems to have a bigger (in absolute value) affect on the exports from firms in<lb/> OECD countries. Firms in OECD countries tend to trade more intensively and offer a larger variety of<lb/> goods to partners that are closer. The further away a partner is located, the fewer the &quot; old &quot; exports and<lb/> the narrower the product range offered. In contrast, firms in enhanced engagement countries appear to<lb/> be less bothered by distance as indicated by smaller marginal effects reported in the table. The<lb/> marginal effect of distance on the intensive margin of agricultural exports is about equal for firms in<lb/> non-OECD economies. But for firms located in the &quot; Other &quot; group of countries, the negative effect of<lb/> distance is more than 3 times the positive effect of partners GDP.<lb/></p>

			<p>Interestingly, exporting firms, no matter where they are located, seem to be more affected by the<lb/> costs of getting products to the market, compared to factors that affect the demand for their product.<lb/> Turning our attention to the extensive margin, the results in Annex Table 4 (for the individual<lb/> countries) and <ref type="table">Table 7</ref> for the various groupings indicates that the effect is very small. And, in most<lb/> cases, distance is a larger detriment to expanding the variety of goods exported and the number of<lb/> trading partners. It appears that cost factors as proxied by distance have a larger effect on the<lb/> probability of converting a non-existing trade flow into a positive one than do demand factors as<lb/> proxied by GDP.<lb/> Finally, equation 5 was estimated using the Probit estimation technique in Stata. But, rather than<lb/> estimating the value of exports, in this case, the dependent variable is whether or not there is trade.<lb/> That is, the value of trade was converted into a zero one variable taking on the value of one when there<lb/> is trade for that particular trading partner for that HS-6 digit product. This focuses strictly on the<lb/> extensive margin as it gives the probability of a zero value switching to positive number (or not), i.e.<lb/> increase (or not) in diversification. There are more countries included in the results as convergence<lb/> was a lesser problem with the Probit. The results reported in Annex <ref type="table">Table 5</ref> confirm previous findings.<lb/> The probability that trade increases at the extensive margin, (a non existing trade flow materializing)<lb/> increases with the partners GDP and decreases with distance. The estimated marginal effects are of<lb/> similar magnitude and sign as the corresponding Tobit estimation. The marginal effects are mostly<lb/> statistically significant but the effects are rather small, again consistent with the Tobit results and as<lb/> was the case for the Tobit, the relative effect of distance is larger (in absolute value) than the income<lb/> effect.<lb/> For an easier comparison of the results with the Tobit estimation (<ref type="table">Table 7</ref>), <ref type="table">Table 8</ref> reports the<lb/> marginal effects (at the sample mean) of the Probit estimation, weighted (by the population) (similar<lb/> results when the average is weighted by the exporters GDP). Comparing the two tables the results of<lb/> changes in trade flows at the extensive margin are strikingly similar. Firms in OECD countries have a<lb/> greater probability of establishing new trading relationships (either through exporting new products<lb/> agricultural products to new or old markets, or through exporting old products to new markets),<lb/> compared to firms located in other countries. But, that probability is fairly small and it is even smaller<lb/> for firms in non-OECD economies.<lb/></p>

			<head>Summary and conclusions<lb/></head>

			<p>Trade occurs because the parties that engage in the transaction find it beneficial. On the import<lb/> side, welfare is enhanced through consumption of lower priced goods and through the availability of a<lb/> larger variety of goods. On the export side, expanding markets enables the exploitation of comparative<lb/> advantage, while firms can reduce costs by increasing the scale of their production and improve<lb/> productivity. Exports can grow as firms export more and/or at higher prices for the products they have<lb/> been producing to their existing partners (the intensive margin). Exports can also grow through market<lb/> development and by exporting existing set of products to new partners and through innovation and<lb/> exporting new products either to existing or to new partners (the extensive margin). Of course, exports<lb/> can also diminish as demand for certain products on world markets falls or the goods are replaced by<lb/> exports from more efficient competitors from other countries.<lb/></p>

			<p>In this paper the evolution of agricultural exports between 1996 and 2006 was examined to<lb/> ascertain the relative contribution of the extensive and intensive margin. The intensive and extensive<lb/> margins have been defined differently by various researches. In this exercise, several different<lb/> definitions have been used to ascertain the effects on trade in agricultural products.<lb/></p>

			<p>The extensive margin has contributed to growing agricultural exports, more for firms located in<lb/> OECD countries relative to those in other countries. Supply factors are important explanatory<lb/> variables to export expansion. But, agricultural specific variables such as agricultural value added, the<lb/> supply of farm labor, average agricultural labor productivity, and the capital intensity of agriculture<lb/> performed inferior to general economic variables such as GDP, total supply of labor and average labor<lb/> productivity. This may be a reflection of the time period examined and/or the countries chosen in our<lb/> sample, although most likely it is a reflection that more and more, agricultural trade is in products that<lb/> are further removed from the farm gate encompassing more value added and is undertaken by firms<lb/> that are removed from the agricultural sector. Recent evidence from New Zealand, a country with a<lb/> substantial share of agricultural goods in its total trade, indicates that this may the case as most of the<lb/> exports of agricultural goods are by firms outside of the agricultural sector. This may indicate that<lb/> agricultural trade is similar to trade in other products influenced by general economic conditions rather<lb/> than sector specific.<lb/> Using a particular definition of the intensive and extensive margin developed by <ref type="biblio">Hummels and<lb/> Klenow (2002)</ref>, which is a relative concept and depends on depth and breadth of an exporting<lb/> country&apos;s product offering and trading partners in a given year, the results suggest that richer<lb/> economies tend to have more diversified export bundles. In 2006, 55% of the additional exports of<lb/> richer (based on GDP) countries were through exporting more products to more partners. Firms in<lb/> larger economies have the capacity to sell to more markets that may not necessarily be very large<lb/> overall importers, and they can export more products that may not necessarily have very large value,<lb/> that is, they are able to export relatively small consignments to relatively &quot; small &quot; markets. The<lb/> extensive margin is an even larger contributor to overall exports for economies with a more productive<lb/> labour force. However the results from this part of the analysis also show that the importance of the<lb/> extensive margin in agricultural exports has declined over the time period examined. At the intensive<lb/> margin, the results indicate that not only is the volume of exports larger for richer economies but firms<lb/> are also able to obtain higher prices, suggesting that they&apos;re offering higher quality goods. Firms in<lb/> countries with higher average productivity or with larger labour force are also able to command higher<lb/> prices, but the volume exported is not necessarily higher. However, when an economy&apos;s size is<lb/> measured by its AVA, or when the margins are calculated by Hummels and Klenow&apos;s (2005) modified<lb/> methodology, the results indicate that it&apos;s the intensive margin that contributes the larger share of the<lb/> additional exports of larger economies.<lb/></p>

			<p>The descriptive portion of the analysis examined the growth in agricultural exports from 1996 to<lb/> 2006 without attributing the reasons for this growth. The findings indicate that for the countries in the<lb/> sample, more than one-half of the growth in their exports occurred through the intensive margin. But,<lb/> for many countries (44 out of 69) in the sample, the extensive margin accounts for more than half of<lb/> the growth in their exports over this time period. This indicates that the intensive margin was a larger<lb/> contributor to the growth of the exporting countries with large gains. Most of the countries growing at<lb/> the extensive margin are non-OECD countries, indicating that developing countries are diversifying<lb/> their agricultural export profile. Decomposition of the extensive margin indicates that the vast majority<lb/> of the new exports are from exporting to traditional destinations which implies that establishing<lb/> trading relationships with new destinations is costly. Only about 7% of the new exports are to new<lb/> destinations.<lb/> But, when the change in agricultural exports and the intensive and extensive margins were<lb/> analyzed by estimating a gravity-type equation while explicitly accounting for zero trade flows,<lb/> preliminary results suggest that factors affecting the cost of exporting (using distance as a proxy in our<lb/> case), have a bigger (absolute value) effect on bilateral export flows compared to factors that affect<lb/> demand (using importing country&apos;s GDP as a proxy). We also find that additional agricultural exports<lb/> are mostly generated by changes on the intensive margin, with the extensive margin providing a<lb/> statistically significant but economically smaller share. One should remember however that our<lb/> measure of the extensive margin probably understates its prevalence. Even though we use the most<lb/> disaggregate trade that is internationally consistent (HS-6), there are probably cases where trade in<lb/> new products is not picked up at the HS-6 digit level because they fall in categories where some trade<lb/> is taking place and are classified under existing categories.<lb/> Looking at the extensive margin, there are boundless trading opportunities waiting to be<lb/> exploited. For agricultural products, the number of dormant bilateral relationships dwarfs the number<lb/> of active ones. Although there may be good reasons for the dormant relationships many of which are<lb/> not explored in this study, policies that reduce trade frictions and expand global income can reduce<lb/> their prevalence.<lb/> The fact that the extensive margin is an important source of growing agricultural exports has<lb/> implications on modeling trade reform. Models that are not capturing this source of growth will<lb/> underestimate the potentialimpacts. For exporting countries, they may be less vulnerable to<lb/> deteriorating terms of trade if they&apos;re exporting &quot; new &quot; products or if they&apos;re exporting higher quality<lb/> products. For importing countries, the welfare gains from an enlarged basket of goods may be<lb/> understated.<lb/></p>

			<p>The preliminary results also highlight the importance of trade resistance or trade costs on the<lb/> existing trade flows and on the probability of forming new trading relationships. It seems that there is<lb/> a large payoff to policies that can reduce those frictions. In this analysis, distance was used to proxy<lb/> these trading costs. Further efforts to explicitly include trading costs, such as tariffs, standards,<lb/> information costs or infrastructural impediments into the analysis may improve our understanding of<lb/> their effects on trade flows at the intensive and extensive margins. More detailed analysis at the<lb/> individual product level may also help illuminate the characteristics of those innovative products that<lb/> develop (or not) into major trade flows.</p>
