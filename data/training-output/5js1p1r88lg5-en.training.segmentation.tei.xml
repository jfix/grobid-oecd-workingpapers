			<body>1 <lb/>Teaching in Focus – 2015/11 (May) ©OECD 2015 <lb/>Supporting new teachers <lb/>•  In many countries, less experienced teachers (those with less than five years&apos; teaching experience) are<lb/>more likely to work in challenging schools and less likely to report confidence in their teaching abilities <lb/>than more experienced teachers. <lb/>•  Most countries have activities in place aimed at preparing teachers for work, such as induction and<lb/>mentoring programmes. <lb/>•  Approximately 44% of teachers work in schools where principals report that all new teachers have access<lb/>to formal induction programmes; 76% work in schools with access to informal induction; and 22% work <lb/>in schools that only have programmes for teachers new to teaching. <lb/>•  Fewer teachers report participation in induction and mentoring programmes than principals report<lb/>the existence of such programmes. <lb/>Challenges facing new teachers <lb/>TALIS 2008 (OECD, 2012) illustrated many of the challenges facing new teachers, such as struggling to keep order <lb/>in the classroom. TALIS 2013 extends the understanding of new teachers&apos; working environments by examining how <lb/>new and more experienced teachers are allocated to challenging schools. Indeed, it could be expected that education <lb/>systems would try to make the most out of their human resources, by allocating their most experienced teachers <lb/>to the most challenging schools. Yet, the TALIS data suggests that the opposite can be observed. In most TALIS <lb/>countries, it is more likely that new (i.e. those with five years&apos; experience or less) rather than experienced teachers <lb/>will teach in schools where over 30% of students come from socially disadvantaged homes (Figure 1); where at least <lb/>10% of students have special needs; and where at least 10% are children whose first language is different than the <lb/>language of instruction. <lb/>What is TALIS? <lb/>TALIS (Teaching and Learning International Survey) is the first international survey examining teaching and learning <lb/>environments in schools. It asks teachers and school principals about their work, their schools and their classrooms. <lb/>This cross-country analysis helps countries identify others facing similar challenges and learn about their policies. <lb/>TALIS 2013 focused on lower secondary education teachers and their principals. It sampled 200 schools in more than <lb/>30 countries and 20 teachers in each school. <lb/>More information available at www.oecd.org/talis <lb/>TA LI S <lb/>TA LI S <lb/>T E AC HING in Focus <lb/>2015/11 (May) <lb/></body>

TALIS shows that teachers&apos; self-efficacy <lb/>generally increases over time. Although new teachers tend to be less confident in their teaching abilities than <lb/>their more experienced colleagues, they often face more challenging work environments. Experience takes time to <lb/>accumulate, but confidence can be boosted through participation in professional development, such as induction <lb/>programmes and mentoring. <lb/>Figure 1 • Difference between more experienced and new teachers teaching in schools <lb/>with at least 30% students coming from socially disadvantaged homes <lb/>Percentage of <lb/>teachers <lb/>working in more <lb/>challenging schools <lb/>% <lb/>Brazil <lb/>40 <lb/>Korea <lb/>8 <lb/>Croatia <lb/>7 <lb/>Netherlands <lb/>12 <lb/>Chile <lb/>55 <lb/>Latvia <lb/>18 <lb/>Mexico <lb/>44 <lb/>Portugal <lb/>48 <lb/>Italy <lb/>10 <lb/>Serbia <lb/>7 <lb/>France <lb/>45 <lb/>Bulgaria <lb/>24 <lb/>Abu Dhabi (United Arab Emirates) <lb/>11 <lb/>Slovak Republic <lb/>10 <lb/>Poland <lb/>18 <lb/>Malaysia <lb/>58 <lb/>Spain <lb/>14 <lb/>Average <lb/>20 <lb/>Australia <lb/>26 <lb/>Singapore <lb/>6 <lb/>Estonia <lb/>11 <lb/>Japan <lb/>6 <lb/>England (United Kingdom) <lb/>24 <lb/>Israel <lb/>46 <lb/>Romania <lb/>28 <lb/>Alberta (Canada) <lb/>20 <lb/>Sweden <lb/>10 <lb/>Flanders (Belgium) <lb/>16 <lb/>Difference in the proportion of teachers with more <lb/>than 5 years teaching experience who work in <lb/>more challenging schools and those who do not <lb/>-10 <lb/>-5 <lb/>0 <lb/>5 <lb/>10 <lb/>Note: Positive scores indicate a higher proportion of more experienced teachers in a challenging school. <lb/>Source: OECD, TALIS 2013 Database. <lb/>What this means in practice <lb/>What this means in practice <lb/>Teaching in Focus – 2015/11 (May) ©OECD 2015 3 <lb/>Teaching in Focus <lb/>New teachers can be supported through being paired with more experienced colleagues, often called mentors. <lb/>Across TALIS countries, approximately 75% of teachers work in schools where principals report the existence <lb/>of a mentoring programme. However, there are large differences between countries in terms of whether these <lb/>programmes are offered only to teachers who are new to teaching, to teachers new to the school, or to all teachers. <lb/>T A L I S <lb/>Figure 2 • Access to formal and informal induction programmes <lb/>Formal induction accessible for all new teachers to the school <lb/>Formal induction accessible only to teachers new to teaching <lb/>Access to informal induction activities (not part of an induction programme) for new teachers <lb/>Percentage of teachers whose school principal reported the existence of formal and informal induction programmes <lb/>0 <lb/>20 <lb/>20 <lb/>40 <lb/>60 <lb/>80 <lb/>100 <lb/>40 <lb/>60 <lb/>80 <lb/>100 <lb/>Portugal <lb/>Poland <lb/>Spain <lb/>Brazil <lb/>Mexico <lb/>Latvia <lb/>Czech Republic <lb/>Chile <lb/>Estonia <lb/>Romania <lb/>Finland <lb/>Iceland <lb/>Norway <lb/>Denmark <lb/>Sweden <lb/>Average <lb/>France <lb/>Abu Dhabi (United Arab Emirates) <lb/>Korea <lb/>Israel <lb/>Slovak Republic <lb/>Serbia <lb/>Alberta (Canada) <lb/>Bulgaria <lb/>Italy <lb/>Japan <lb/>Croatia <lb/>Netherlands <lb/>Flanders (Belgium) <lb/>Australia <lb/>Malaysia <lb/>England (United Kingdom) <lb/>Singapore <lb/>Source: OECD, TALIS 2013 Database. <lb/>Availability of support programmes for new teachers <lb/>Induction programmes are completed during a teacher&apos;s first regular teaching position and can be formal or informal <lb/>in nature (OECD, 2014a). These activities can help link pre-service teacher training to the reality of day-to-day work <lb/>in the classroom. <lb/>Access to induction programmes varies. As Figure 2 shows, 44% of teachers work in schools where principals report <lb/>that formal induction programmes are available for all new teachers; 22% work in schools where formal induction <lb/>programmes are only available for teachers new to teaching; and 76% of teachers work in schools that have informal <lb/>induction programmes. In Brazil, Mexico, Poland, Portugal and Spain, between 70% and 80% of teachers have no <lb/>access to formal induction programmes. In Japan and Mexico, about 60% of teachers have no access to informal <lb/>induction programmes. <lb/>Participation in support programmes for new teachers <lb/>In most TALIS countries, teachers report lower participation rates in induction programmes than principals report <lb/>access to these programmes. As Figure 3 shows, 70% of teachers with less than 3 years&apos; experience work in schools where <lb/>principals report access to induction programmes, however only about 50% report participating in such programmes. <lb/></body>

Education systems should review their policies for allocating teachers to <lb/>the more challenging schools, as well as invest in extending access to professional support for new teachers <lb/>through induction programmes and mentoring activities. Attention also needs to be paid to maximising the <lb/>participation in such programmes by eliminating barriers and creating incentives for participation. <lb/>T A L I S <lb/>This paper is published under the responsibility of the Secretary-General of the OECD.

However, even when taking this into account <lb/>the difference between access and participation is considerable in some countries. For example, in the Netherlands, <lb/>71% of all teachers work in schools with reported mentoring programmes, while only 17% report having a mentor. </body>
