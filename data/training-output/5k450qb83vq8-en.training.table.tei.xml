Broad arrows represent information flows, thin arrows represent unit flows.<lb/> 2. Annex I Parties not in Annex B to the Kyoto Protocol do not receive AAUs and do not have a registry<lb/> connected to the ITL. Malta (Annex I, not Annex B) and Cyprus (neither Annex I nor B) are nevertheless in the<lb/> EU ETS, and a clearing system is required to ensure that EUAs remain backed up by AAUs.<lb/> 3. In specific cases a Kyoto base year other than 1990 is used for certain Parties and for certain gases.<lb/> 4. Transactions of non-Kyoto units (eg VERs) are not tracked by the ITL and are not shown for simplicity. Box 2: What&apos;s in a name? Registries and transaction logs<lb/> The Oxford English Dictionary defines a registry as a place where registers or records are kept; an<lb/> official list or register. Under the UNFCCC, there are two main uses of the term registry: existing<lb/> GHG unit registries and the forthcoming registry for listing Nationally Appropriate Mitigation<lb/> Actions (NAMAs).<lb/> Unit registries: Under the Kyoto Protocol, the term registry usually refers to a database used to list<lb/> quantities of GHG units held by governments or entities. Each registry contains distinct accounts to<lb/> hold quantities of units, similar to bank accounts. One entity can hold multiple accounts in the same<lb/> registry. National registries are hosted by Annex I governments, whilst the CDM registry is hosted by<lb/> the UNFCCC.<lb/> Under regional emissions trading schemes such as the EU ETS, unit registries serve a similar purpose<lb/> for listing GHG units belonging to different entities. Currently EU ETS units are held in dedicated<lb/> accounts within national Kyoto registries, but after 2011 the ETS registries will exist separately.<lb/> Voluntary offset systems also operate registry systems with a similar account-based structure. These<lb/> are usually hosted by independent registry companies.<lb/> NAMA registry: The COP 16 decisions outline a registry for NAMAs. As currently described, this<lb/> would be very different to the existing Kyoto unit registries. It would not hold GHG units, but would<lb/> act as a service to facilitate matching funding with recipients. The COP 16 decision invites Parties to<lb/> submit information and the UNFCCC Secretariat to regularly update the registry, but modalities and<lb/> procedures have not yet been defined.</table>

            <table>Box 3: Potential double counting of CDM emissions reductions: the case of China<lb/> China&apos;s inscription to the Copenhagen Accord states that: &quot; China will endeavour to lower its carbon<lb/> dioxide emissions per unit of GDP by 40-45% by 2020 compared to the 2005 level, increase the share<lb/> of non-fossil fuels in primary energy consumption to around 15% by 2020 and increase forest<lb/> coverage by 40 million hectares and forest stock volume by 1.3 billion cubic meters by 2020 from the<lb/> 2005 levels. &quot;<lb/> This wording implies that the mitigation goal is for CO 2 only (rather than all GHGs or the Kyoto<lb/> Protocol gases), although this has not been confirmed by the Chinese government. The intensity<lb/> metric, calculated relative to economy-wide GDP, is based on a single year, 2005. Since 2005 China<lb/> has had a domestic goal to reduce energy intensity by 20-25% by 2010, described in the 2005-2010<lb/> &apos;11th Five Year Plan&apos;. It is not yet clear how the new emissions intensity goal will add to this existing<lb/> energy intensity initiative combined with the non-fossil fuel and forestry goals mentioned above<lb/> (Project Catalyst 2010).<lb/> The scope of the pledge could have implications on CDM projects in China. If the goal is clarified as<lb/> being only based on CO 2 , this will have a bearing on the possibility of CDM double counting. 33% of<lb/> expected CERs up to 2020 from China are from predominantly non-CO 2 sources (of projects already<lb/> in the CDM pipeline, including HFCs, N 2 O, coal mine methane and landfill gas) (UNEP Risoe 2011).<lb/> These </table>
 
            <figDesc>projects therefore would not be subject to double counting should the pledge cover only CO 2<lb/> (ignoring any other concerns over environmental integrity). Of the remaining CDM projects,<lb/> renewable energy projects cover c.47% of CERs expected to 2020. These have already faced<lb/> additionality challenges over tariff setting, particularly for wind and hydro projects. China&apos;s parallel<lb/> renewable energy target may add to this concern. The final 20% of CERs are expected from<lb/> predominantly (about 90% of remainder) fossil fuel switch and power generation using industrial<lb/> waste energy.</figDesc>

            <table>The Party may also issue RMUs into its national registry to account for net removals of anthropogenic<lb/> emissions sequestered by changes in forestry and land-use since 1990. The rules for this are complex<lb/> and stem from paragraphs 3 and 4 of Article 3 of the KP, which describe how Parties may decide to<lb/> account for direct human-induced land-use change in both forestry (paragraph 3) and other land-use<lb/> (paragraph 4). Each Party decides in advance whether to issue RMUs annually during the<lb/> commitment period or once at the start of the period. RMUs also have a serial number which also<lb/> includes a reference to the type of activity to which the RMU relates. RMUs issued cannot total more<lb/> than 1% of annual base year emissions (for the first CP).<lb/> Transfer of units under the Flexibility Mechanisms<lb/> The Kyoto Protocol allows for exchange of emissions units between Parties under three flexibility<lb/> mechanisms:<lb/> -International Emissions Trading (IET), comprising direct exchange of AAUs between national<lb/> registries;<lb/> -Joint Implementation (JI), exchange of Emission Reduction Units (ERUs) arising from<lb/> specific project-based emissions reductions within a Kyoto Annex B country; ERUs are<lb/> converted from existing AAUs so do not lead to any increase in allowance units within the<lb/> international system;<lb/> -Clean Development Mechanism (CDM), import of Certified Emission Reductions (CERs)<lb/> from specific project-based actions in Kyoto Parties that are not in Annex I; CERs are created<lb/> in addition to existing AAUs so represent an increase of allowance units in the international<lb/> system.<lb/> To be eligible to transfer units under the mechanisms, Parties must fulfil certain requirements (as<lb/> listed in Decision 11/CMP1). Each Party must ensure that it:-<lb/>-is a Party to the KP;<lb/> -has calculated and recorded an Assigned Amount;<lb/> -has in place national systems for emissions estimation, according to Art 5 paragraph 1 of KP;<lb/> -has a national registry as described below;<lb/> -has submitted its most recent required inventory, with quality assessment carried out on those<lb/> gases and sectors specified in Annex A of the KP; and<lb/> -submits all necessary additional information on assigned amounts required to calculate<lb/> additions and subtractions from the assigned amount (Article 3, mostly concerning LULUCF<lb/> emissions).<lb/> Transfers between national registries are under the responsibility of both Parties (13/CMP1). If a Party<lb/> authorises other legal entities to transfer or acquire units, such as occurs under the European<lb/> Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS) then the Party still remains responsible for fulfilling its KP<lb/> obligations.</table>

Therefore<lb/> trade of EUAs around Europe is in fact equivalent to trade of AAUs between private entities holding registry accounts in European Party Kyoto Protocol registries, and each of these transactions is<lb/> verified by the ITL in the normal way. The Community Independent Transaction Log (CITL), which<lb/> was set up to handle EU ETS trades before the Kyoto first Commitment Period began (and in fact due<lb/> to delays in the launch of the ITL, continued to be the principal trading hub until late 2008) is still<lb/> operational and acts as a back-up system to the ITL, double-checking EU-specific transactions. The<lb/> European registry system was described in detail in the &apos;Registries Regulation&apos; agreed in 2004 and<lb/> modified in 2008 and 2010 (European Commission, 2010). The EU registry system is set to change<lb/> substantially on 1 January 2012, as described below.<lb/> Up to 2012, Parties participating in the EU ETS use their Kyoto Protocol registry for accounting for<lb/> EUA units. The Registries Regulation instructs each Member State, having had its National<lb/> Allocation Plan approved by the Commission and entered into the CITL, to convert the equivalent<lb/> number of AAUs in the Party holding account into EUAs by adding an identifier to the serial number<lb/> of the AAU. These EUAs are then transferred by the national administrator into operator holding<lb/> accounts held in the national registry for all relevant installations. EUAs can then be traded between<lb/> operators, with any transfer between accounts verified and recorded by both the CITL and (since<lb/> October 2008) the ITL.<lb/> Operators can of course comply with annual EU ETS obligations by surrendering either EUAs<lb/> equivalent to their verified emissions, or a mixture of EUAs and CERs/ERUs with the latter<lb/> constituting no more than a maximum proportion of emissions as stipulated by each Member State.<lb/> To demonstrate compliance, operators request the administrator of the national registry of where the<lb/> installation is located to transfer a specified number of allowances from the operator&apos;s holding<lb/> account to the Party holding account in the same registry. For CERs/ERUs, the operator can request<lb/> that a specified number of credits be transferred to the Party retirement account directly. Prior to<lb/> 2010, CERs could be transferred to the Party holding account in the registry. However, after it<lb/> emerged in March 2010 that some EU Member States were reselling such CERs to non-European<lb/> buyers</table>

Whilst aviation operators can use both types of EUA for<lb/> compliance, regular stationary operators can ONLY use Type III allowances.</table>
