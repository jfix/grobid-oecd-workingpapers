			<body>INTERNATIONAL ENERGY AGENCY <lb/>The International Energy Agency (IEA), an autonomous agency, was established in <lb/>November 1974. Its mandate is two-fold: to promote energy security amongst its member <lb/>countries through collective response to physical disruptions in oil supply and to advise member <lb/>countries on sound energy policy. <lb/>The IEA carries out a comprehensive programme of energy co-operation among 28 advanced <lb/>economies, each of which is obliged to hold oil stocks equivalent to 90 days of its net imports. <lb/>The Agency aims to: <lb/>n Secure member countries&apos; access to reliable and ample supplies of all forms of energy; in particular, <lb/>through maintaining effective emergency response capabilities in case of oil supply disruptions. <lb/>n Promote sustainable energy policies that spur economic growth and environmental protection <lb/>in a global context – particularly in terms of reducing greenhouse-gas emissions that contribute <lb/>to climate change. <lb/>n Improve transparency of international markets through collection and analysis of <lb/>energy data. <lb/>n Support global collaboration on energy technology to secure future energy supplies <lb/>and mitigate their environmental impact, including through improved energy <lb/>efficiency and development and deployment of low-carbon technologies. <lb/>n Find solutions to global energy challenges through engagement <lb/>and dialogue with non-member countries, industry, <lb/>international organisations and other stakeholders. <lb/>IEA member countries: <lb/>Australia <lb/>Austria <lb/>Belgium <lb/>Canada <lb/>Czech Republic <lb/>Denmark <lb/>Finland <lb/>France <lb/>Germany <lb/>Greece <lb/>Hungary <lb/>Ireland <lb/>Italy <lb/>Japan <lb/>Korea (Republic of) <lb/>Luxembourg <lb/>Netherlands <lb/>New Zealand <lb/>Norway <lb/>Poland <lb/>Portugal <lb/>Slovak Republic <lb/>Spain <lb/>Sweden <lb/>Switzerland <lb/>Turkey <lb/>United Kingdom <lb/>United States <lb/>The European Commission <lb/>also participates in <lb/>the work of the IEA. <lb/>Please note that this publication <lb/>is subject to specific restrictions <lb/>that limit its use and distribution. <lb/>The terms and conditions are available <lb/>online at www.iea.org/about/copyright.asp <lb/></body>

			<body>Page | 9 <lb/>Executive summary <lb/>Brazil, China, India and South Africa have each worked to improve access to electricity services. <lb/>While many of the challenges faced by these countries are similar, the means of addressing them <lb/>varied in their application and effectiveness. On the basis of our analysis of these four country <lb/>profiles, we have determined the prerequisites to successful rural electrification policies. <lb/>1: Preconditions to successful rural electrification policies <lb/> Sound statistical data on populations&apos; geographical distribution and a clear description <lb/>of the electrification situation are essential if governments are to avoid the risk of <lb/>overlooking remote population groups and to facilitate the choice of end-use. <lb/> Sustained government support and long-term funding will guarantee a more effective <lb/>implementation of electrification objectives, and the elimination of any misuse of <lb/>electrification funds in favour of other objectives. <lb/> Dedicated institutional structures and independence from political agendas ensure that <lb/>funds are &quot; ring-fenced &quot; , efforts are durable and electrification objectives are not <lb/>interfered with according to politicians&apos; personal agendas. <lb/> The establishment of a strong market infrastructure to attract private investors ensures <lb/>the wider use of stand-alone systems in remote areas. <lb/> Related policies and/or regulations including energy efficiency policies should be <lb/>implemented alongside the electrification process to sustain long-term economic <lb/>development. <lb/> Connection costs should be eliminated or spread over time so as to minimise any <lb/>upfront hindrances to being connected, and electricity tariffs should be affordable but <lb/>not necessarily subsidised. <lb/> Effective metering, billing and payment recovery ensure the long-term viability of the <lb/>electricity supplier and therefore of the electrification process as a whole. <lb/> Full involvement of the rural communities in the electrification efforts throughout the <lb/>decision-making process increases their sense of ownership and brings support to <lb/>utilities&apos; efforts to encourage customers to use electricity wisely once they are <lb/>connected. <lb/>2: Stand-alone systems: conditions for successful rural <lb/>electrification efforts <lb/> Locally-produced and resource-specific technologies for electrification will reduce the <lb/>need to import systems and facilitate their use in any given region. <lb/> Good management and maintenance of the systems require adequate training, <lb/>assistance services and customer supply chains for their long-term use. <lb/> Sufficient long-term funding ensures long-term system maintenance. <lb/> Banning the idea that stand-alone systems provide &quot; second-class &quot; electricity gives <lb/>communities a sense of ownership of the system. <lb/></body>

			<body>3: Grid extension: conditions for successful rural <lb/>electrification efforts <lb/> Reduction of transmission and distribution losses keeps costs of electrification under <lb/>control. <lb/> Reduction of losses due to electricity theft ensures suppliers&apos; longer-term viability. <lb/> The use of low-cost technologies keeps costs of electrification under control. <lb/>4: Three rural electrification boosters <lb/> Social fairness can be one of the initial driving motivators in the first stages of <lb/>electrification. Indeed, economic development will follow sooner or later even when <lb/>productive end-uses are not the prime objective to electrification. <lb/> Minimising trial and error through benchmarking and exchanges with other countries <lb/>accelerate the electrification process. <lb/> Co-operation in the framework of IEA Implementing Agreements for exchanges on <lb/>technologies and support in policy formulation will spur the electrification process and <lb/>facilitate long-term collaboration with other countries on other policy and technology <lb/>issues of interest. <lb/></body>

			<body>Introduction <lb/>Since the G8 Gleneagles Summit in 2005, the International Energy Agency&apos;s (IEA) Networks of Expertise <lb/>in Energy Technology (NEET) Initiative 1 has sought to encourage further involvement of major emerging <lb/>economies in the IEA Technology Network comprising international energy technology and R&amp;D <lb/>collaborative programmes. Missions and workshops when feasible have been organised in the so-called <lb/> &quot; Plus-Five &quot; countries, namely Brazil, China, India, Mexico and South Africa. These outreach efforts have <lb/>been geared towards identifying areas of mutually desirable and potential future collaboration between <lb/>experts of these major emerging economies and the IEA Technology Network including the Committee <lb/>on Energy Research and Technology (CERT), Working Parties (WP) and Implementing Agreements (IA). 2 <lb/>Rural electrification has been singled out as a potential field for international collaborative activities within <lb/>the IEA framework. Policy makers, industries and R&amp;D institutions in the targeted economies have all <lb/>expressed interest in discussing with one another and with international experts, in exchanging their <lb/>experiences, lessons learned and continuing challenges in their efforts to bring energy services to the rural <lb/>world. In response to this interest, the IEA has begun exploring its role as facilitator of international <lb/>exchanges on energy technologies and policies for rural electrification in developing economies. <lb/>In May 2008, the IEA hosted a workshop on &quot; Sustainable Rural Energisation in Major Emerging <lb/>Economies &quot; , in collaboration with the Gesellschaft für Technische Zusammenarbeit (GTZ) and with <lb/>the support of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and the Renewable Energy <lb/>Policy Network for the 21 st Century (REN21). The goal of this workshop was to explore opportunities <lb/>for extending IEA&apos;s collaborative activities to better respond to the major emerging economies&apos; <lb/>interest in international collaboration on rural energisation. 3 Delegates from eleven emerging <lb/>economies, namely Bangladesh, Brazil, Chile, China, Egypt, India, Indonesia, Mexico, Morocco, <lb/>Pakistan and South Africa, met representatives from nine IEA Implementing Agreement (IA) <lb/>programmes and from interested government and international bodies. This was an opportunity for <lb/>IAs to display their collaborative activities and discuss with the country representatives on how to <lb/>join forces in carrying forward existing efforts. Specific goals were also to establish to what degree <lb/>the emerging economies are committed to such collaboration and to identify the preferred vehicle. <lb/>The key messages emerging from the workshop highlighted the importance of a constructive <lb/>dialogue and a &quot; made-to-measure &quot; , non-prescriptive approach. Participants also noted the need to <lb/>have the IEA as a focal point for information exchanges not only between the IEA countries and <lb/>emerging economies, but also among the latter. They noted that rural energy decision makers <lb/>required support in adapting policies to local conditions and that assistance was needed in <lb/>technology transfer and capacity building, both technical and policy-related. They encouraged <lb/>further work on policy benchmarking and invited the IEA to undertake a comparative analysis of the <lb/>effectiveness and efficiency of national and regional policies to accelerate rural energisation. <lb/></body>

			<body>Page | 12 <lb/>This paper directly stems from the conclusions of this workshop. It describes the rural electrification <lb/>policies adopted by the four major emerging economies, with a view to analysing the keys to the <lb/>successful implementation of such policies. 4 <lb/>Rural electrification: main challenges and issues <lb/>Roughly 22% of the world&apos;s population still does not have access to electricity. In 2008, this <lb/>represented 1.5 billion people, most of whom lived in remote areas often difficult to access and <lb/>therefore to connect to national or regional grids. The International Energy Agency estimates that <lb/>roughly 85% of the people without electricity live in rural areas in developing countries, mostly in <lb/>peri-urban or remote rural areas (IEA, 2009b). Today, most of these people are found in sub-<lb/>Saharan Africa and South Asia. The IEA predicts that in 2030, if no new policy to alleviate energy <lb/>poverty is introduced, 1.3 billion people (some 16% of the total world population) will still be denied <lb/>electricity most of whom in South Asia and Africa (IEA, 2009b). <lb/>Not all electrification policies target poor rural households. Some also target a mix of farms, big <lb/>villages and small towns all of which call for different technologies. In fact, rural electrification <lb/>policies are shaped according to the various energy needs, resources and target groups. Electrifying <lb/>the suburb of a major Indian city obviously poses problems that are different from those of a <lb/>remote village in China. As problems are far greater in rural areas than in urban settings (Barnes, <lb/>2007) we will focus our attention on electrification policies in favour of the world&apos;s rural poor. <lb/>General challenges faced by rural communities <lb/>Rural electrification is defined here as the process by which access to electricity is provided to households <lb/>or villages located in the isolated or remote areas of a country. Remote or rural regions lacking electricity <lb/>supply are often characterised by well identified challenges. They may lie at a reasonable distance from <lb/>national or regional electricity grids (remote villages in the Amazon), may be difficult to access (far from <lb/>urban centres with a difficult terrain such as large rivers or jungles), or may suffer harsh climatic conditions <lb/>that render electrification through grid extension a perilous task. Rural communities are also often highly <lb/>dispersed with a low population density and characterised by a low level of education, low load density <lb/>generally concentrated at evening peak hours, and low revenues. Adding to these challenges, the rural <lb/>poor without access to electricity either spend relatively large amounts of their scarce financial resources <lb/>on energy, or a disproportionate amount of time collecting firewood. <lb/>In light of these challenges, electricity provision to the world&apos;s rural poor calls for a committed and <lb/>long-term action plan. The benefits that electricity access brings to households and communities <lb/>are justified not only on social and economic grounds but also on grounds of equity objectives. <lb/>Social benefits of electrification <lb/>At the household level, electricity is mainly used for powering light bulbs, fans, television sets, <lb/>computers and phones (when available). For over 30 years the World Bank and other organisations <lb/>have studied the social benefits of electricity access and have noted that these benefits usually <lb/>derive from the longer days that powered light bulbs offer to the household. In addition, access to <lb/>information, communication and health care is facilitated by the powering of computers and <lb/></body>

When electricity is used for powering home appliances, household chores tend to become <lb/>less tedious; when it is used for lighting, the relative brightness of the light bulb as opposed to <lb/>candle light allows children to read or study in the later hours of the day, bringing obvious <lb/>education and leisure benefits (Barnes, 2007). Women and children benefit directly from these <lb/>improvements, but table or ceiling fans and television sets offer comfort during evening leisure <lb/>time, increasing the general welfare of all members of the household. <lb/>Economic benefits of electrification <lb/>Besides the social benefits, decision makers tend to give more importance to the economic impact <lb/>of access to electricity as an income-generating process. Electricity use is expected to lead to more <lb/>productive processes; the growth of businesses or farms using electricity will then increase demand <lb/>for electricity, leading to a virtuous growth cycle profitable to both electricity providers and rural <lb/>communities. Such economic growth is obviously an important achievement of any rural <lb/>electrification programme. Some experts (Barnes, 2007), however, warn that the necessary <lb/>conditions for such economic growth lie in the parallel or complementary development <lb/>programmes for the newly electrified communities. While electricity is indeed an important input to <lb/>rural businesses, farms or other small rural structures, adequate local conditions such as organised <lb/>rural markets and sufficient credit are necessary for such businesses to grow. Lack of such <lb/>complementary development programmes in these regions may hinder their economic growth. <lb/>Technologies commonly used in rural electrification policies <lb/>Socially, ethically and economically beneficial, the electrification of rural or remote areas is usually <lb/>high on the agenda of the leaders of major emerging economies, but the main problem to <lb/>overcome is the choice of the technology. <lb/>The choice of a specific energy technology for rural electrification naturally depends on the targeted <lb/>country and on whether it is a whole region, community, business, farm or household that is to benefit <lb/>from the process. But this is not the only concern. Issues of customer and load density, relative distance <lb/>to the national or regional grid, landscape, availability of natural resources such as wind, sun, water, <lb/>forests, economic and financial aspects, availability and maturity of any chosen technology, all these <lb/>factors influence the decision maker in his choice of the technology or technology mix. <lb/>The pool of potential energy technologies for rural electrification programmes is quite large and <lb/>each technology naturally varies in its generation technique, its costs, and in the quality of the <lb/>service it delivers. Depending in part on the degree of urbanisation of the targeted population, <lb/>energy technologies used in electrification programmes generally involve national or regional grid <lb/>extension, diesel generators, liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), disposable batteries, kerosene lamps, <lb/>renewable energies (including photovoltaic systems, wind energy, hydropower, and new wave <lb/>energy and hydrogen) or hybrid systems. <lb/>National or regional grid extension <lb/>When aiming to electrify a rural community, the first question is its distance from a grid. If grid <lb/>extension appears to be relatively easy (the region is near to the grid, flat landscape), is cost-<lb/>competitive with respect to other local autogenerators, and if the region&apos;s load density is <lb/>considered sufficient, then grid extension will usually be a preferred option. In India for instance, <lb/></body>

Grid extension was then the <lb/>final phase of a sequential rural electrification process and other local electrification technologies <lb/>were chosen in the meantime. In fact, once demand was built over the years by means of auto-<lb/>generation, and it became economically feasible to connect to the central grid, grid extension was <lb/>chosen as a final step. Recently, however, mentalities have been changing and governments as well <lb/>as rural communities are beginning to see stand-alone systems as long-term and reliable options for <lb/>power generation, rendering grid extension less of a mandatory long-term means of electrification. <lb/>Conventional systems <lb/>Diesel generators, LPG, disposable batteries, paraffin (or kerosene) and biomass technologies have <lb/>all been conventional means for dispersed populations to have access to electricity services. Today <lb/>however, sustainability considerations are encouraging developing economies to focus their efforts, <lb/>where possible, in deploying cleaner energy technologies such as renewable and more sustainable <lb/>bioenergy applications. But diesel generators remain an attractive technology in rural <lb/>electrification, mainly used in hybrid systems. <lb/>Renewable energy systems <lb/>Often considered the optimal means of bringing electricity to rural areas that cannot be connected <lb/>to the grid, renewable energies offer notable environmental advantages over conventional fossil <lb/>fuel technologies. The most widely used renewable energy technologies for rural electrification are <lb/>described below. <lb/>Photovoltaic (PV) power systems already provide electricity in developing countries to an estimated <lb/>minimum of 500 000 to 1 million rural households without access to the grid (International Finance <lb/>Corporation, 2007). Particularly attractive for countries with ample sunlight and whose rural electricity <lb/>grid is poorly developed, PV systems can provide electricity to relatively dispersed populations but also <lb/>to groups of houses or entire villages. The most common systems used in rural areas in developing <lb/>countries are solar home systems (SHS), which have the potential to power light bulbs and small <lb/>appliances such as televisions, radios or fans. Generally the capacity of the units used in rural households <lb/>ranges from 30 to 100 peak watts, but their size varies (Erickson &amp; Chapman, 1995). However, because <lb/>of the systems&apos; limited capacity, mechanisms are often needed to prevent excessive consumption by <lb/>users. Currently, there is a move towards solar-diesel hybrid-powered mini-grids. <lb/>Photo 1: School in South Africa powered by a photovoltaic system <lb/>Source: Courtesy of Bernard Mc Nelis, IEA PVPS. <lb/></body>

			<body>Wind energy has a very high potential for rural electrification thanks to its intrinsic characteristics. <lb/>Wind energy does not necessitate long-term centralised planning for its development as it is fast <lb/>and simple to install. In most rural settings, when several smaller wind turbines are installed rather <lb/>than a very large one, the grid can easily absorb wind generation. Successful examples of rural <lb/>electrification based on wind power are the Atlantic islands of Canary, Azores and Cape Verde, <lb/>where the high wind resource turns this renewable energy into among the most cost-effective <lb/>power plants to install and operate. <lb/>Small hydropower projects already provide electricity to millions of people throughout the world, <lb/>with the largest deployment being in China. These power plants can vary in size from less than <lb/>500 kW to about 10 MW and most are developed at the community level or for small industry. In <lb/>addition to electricity, they also provide mechanical energy for small businesses, drinking water and <lb/>irrigation through canals or pumps. While some small hydro plants use imported technology, there <lb/>is an increased reliance on local manufacture. This provides employment opportunities over and <lb/>above electricity to the communities. There remains a huge potential to increase the role of small <lb/>hydro in supplying electricity to small, rural populations. Mini-hydropower plants are however often <lb/>criticised for their inability to provide sufficient power to meet peak demand or for their excess <lb/>capacity during off-peak periods. In order to limit the financial burden due to such tensions, <lb/>consumers often have to either constrain their use of electricity during peak hours, or transfer their <lb/>demand on to off-peak hours. <lb/>Bioenergy already provides the main source of energy for heating and cooking for many millions of <lb/>people in rural communities. Where adequate sources of biomass raw materials are available – for <lb/>example from crop or forest residues – then these can also be used to generate electricity. This can <lb/>be done in conjunction with larger plants which also use energy to process crops (for example the <lb/>use of bagasse in sugar cane production). Alternatively smaller-scale systems based on biomass <lb/>combustion or small-scale gasification can be used to generate electricity for local use. Moreover, <lb/>biofuels such as non-edible straight vegetable oils (SVOs) produced from plants like Jatropha, can be <lb/>directly used for transport applications and decentralised power generation or converted to <lb/>biodiesel and blended with petro-diesel. <lb/>Photo 2: Transporting fuel wood in Brazil <lb/>Source: Courtesy J. Tustin, IEA Bioenergy IA. <lb/>Ocean energy could play a significant role in enabling sustainable energisation of rural coastal and <lb/>island regions of the developing countries by generating electricity, producing drinking water <lb/>through desalination, or food through aquaculture, and cooling. This would however require <lb/>appropriate policy instruments and real political will. Currently, project development activities are <lb/>at an early stage in China, India, and Indonesia for providing electricity to rural households by <lb/>harnessing energy from ocean waves and tidal currents. During 2007, Ponte di Archimede <lb/>International S.p.A. entered into three joint ventures with the People&apos;s Republic of China, Indonesia <lb/></body>

The Research and <lb/>Technology Ministries in the respective countries participated actively in the formation of these <lb/>ventures. The installation of tidal current projects of a similar size in remote villages is currently <lb/>being planned in China and the Philippines. A 2 MW tidal current plant is being considered by India <lb/>to bring electricity to a remote area near Sunderban in West Bengal. A low-temperature ocean <lb/>thermal desalination (LTTD) plant has been operating since 2005 at Kavaratti in Lakshadweep <lb/>islands in western India and that provides 100 m 3 per day of drinking water to a local community. <lb/>There are also significant opportunities to utilise wave and tidal current energy for sustainable <lb/>energisation of remote coastal areas in Mexico, Brazil and South Africa and activities are already <lb/>under way in these countries. <lb/>Hydrogen may well play a key role in distributed energy generation for which rural areas are prime <lb/>candidates. Hydrogen &quot;generators&quot; (small-scale portable power devices such as reformers and fuel <lb/>cells) may be substituted for the common diesel generators that are widely used. Hydrogen can also <lb/>be used as fuel to power backup devices (larger fuel cells) and to provide combined heat and power <lb/>(CHP). However, because it is innovative and new (at the demonstration and early market <lb/>introduction stages) the typical household in rural settings would not be appropriate for hydrogen <lb/>use. There are, however, some 400 stationary hydrogen demonstrations in the world. Unlike the <lb/>photovoltaic industry or solar water-heating and cooling and other alternative technology industries <lb/>which have started from scratch, hydrogen is already a large business with an infrastructure that <lb/>can kick-start production, storage, delivery or energy applications as the deployment process <lb/>continues. Hydrogen technologies may in the future bring innovation to the current supply of rural <lb/>electrification technologies. <lb/>Photo 3: Prince Edward Island (PEI) Wind-Hydrogen Village Project CanmetENERGY <lb/>Source: Natural Resources Canada. <lb/>Hybrid systems <lb/>Hybrid systems are basically a combination of two or more different but complementary energy <lb/>supply systems located on the same site. The advantage of hybrid systems is their ability to avoid <lb/>fluctuations in the system&apos;s energy supply, which is the main disadvantage of stand-alone <lb/>renewable energy technologies such as wind and PV. A hybrid system will provide a relatively <lb/>constant delivery of energy even when one of the supply devices of the system is unable to <lb/>generate power (lack of wind in the case of a windmill or of sunlight in the case of a PV). Often, <lb/>hybrid systems will be a combination of different renewable energy technologies, sometimes <lb/>coupled with diesel gen-sets. Typical hybrid systems are photovoltaic/wind systems, wind/diesel <lb/>systems, wind/photovoltaic/micro hydropower systems, or wind/small hydropower and so forth. <lb/></body>

			<body>Page | 17 <lb/>Typically, apart from local ambient conditions, economical and financial issues, the choice of which <lb/>energy technology or mix of technologies to use for rural electrification will depend on whether the <lb/>energy produced will be used for lighting or cooling purposes in a single household, or for <lb/>productive processes (irrigation pumping, water supplies, crop processing, refrigeration, etc.) of <lb/>businesses, agro-industries, small shops, and so on. <lb/>A focus on government policies for rural electrification <lb/>Most developing countries include rural electrification policies in their socio-political development <lb/>efforts. The existing economic inequalities between urban and rural populations and these <lb/>countries&apos; social equity objectives tend to be the main drivers to providing electricity access to <lb/>isolated populations. By doing this, governments of developing countries seek to improve the living <lb/>standards of their rural populations and help them economically in order to help level out <lb/>rural/urban disparities. Moreover, substantial upfront costs and long-term financial investments are <lb/>required to accelerate the pace of rural electrification. Such financial security depends on <lb/>government support. <lb/>Efficient implementation of rural electrification programmes often needs regulations and market <lb/>reforms, including market incentives through increased competition for private involvement and <lb/>above all government involvement. Moreover, technical standards and norms can lead to an <lb/>oversizing or costly infrastructure set-up for the electrification of rural households or villages, which <lb/>will increase connection costs and the price of electricity. A reassessment of these standards and <lb/>norms at the government level may prove necessary to alleviate the unnecessary additional <lb/>financial burden from the electrification effort in rural areas. <lb/>The following chapters will analyse countries where government-led rural electrification <lb/>programmes have been implemented. These countries are Brazil, China, India and South Africa. <lb/>Through benchmarking current achievements with previously set targets, we will infer the main <lb/>challenges faced by implementing bodies and how these have been addressed. The analysis of the <lb/>country chapters 5 bring forth the important issues that need to be considered and addressed for <lb/>the successful implementation of a rural electrification policy. <lb/></body>

			<note place="footnote">5 These four country chapters display the electrification efforts of Brazil, China, India and South Africa which <lb/>have achieved more than 65% electrification rate, through huge and running systems, albeit with difficulties. <lb/>These countries have been able to release substantive funds to finance rural electrification, and have relied <lb/>on companies which had sufficient know-how and expertise to achieve the plans. The situation is different <lb/>in sub-Saharan Africa where electrification is closer to 10% (with some exceptions such as Ghana or <lb/>Cameroon). Country reviews on some Sub-Saharan African or South Asian countries would bring greater <lb/>insights into the additional difficulties faced by countries with lower national capacity. <lb/></note>

			<body>1 Brazil <lb/>Since the 1988 Constitution, the federal government of Brazil has been assuming full responsibility <lb/>for the distribution of electricity as an essential public service. As a consequence of strong political <lb/>will and the release of sufficient funds, in 2009 Brazil reached an overall electrification rate of <lb/>97.8%. This rate was 99.5% in urban areas and 88 % in rural areas (IEA, 2009b). This has been <lb/>achieved largely through grid extension. Stand-alone systems may be more widely used in the <lb/>future. The country&apos;s energy sector, electrification efforts and remaining challenges are described <lb/>below. <lb/>1.1 Introduction and country description <lb/>Brazil is the fifth-largest country in the world, covering an area of 8.5 million km 2 , equal to about <lb/>half of the South American continent. It is limited to its east and north by the Atlantic Ocean, its <lb/>inland frontiers border with all Southern American countries except for Chile and Ecuador <lb/>(Wikipedia, 2009a). Brazil belongs to the so-called megadiverse countries, a group that <lb/>encompasses about 70% of the planet&apos;s biodiversity (WCMC, 1992). Particularly notable are its large <lb/>tropical Amazon and Atlantic coast rainforests as well as the large peatlands (the Pantanal) of the <lb/>midwest. Brazil also extends over semi-arid areas in the north-east (the Sertão) and vast plains in <lb/>the south. It has one of the world&apos;s most extensive river systems, including the Amazon and São <lb/>Francisco rivers. Most of the country lies between 200 and 800 metres in elevation. The weather is <lb/>mainly tropical (Wikipedia, 2009a). <lb/>Economic data <lb/>Over the past years, Brazil has enjoyed a period of stable economic growth with significant social <lb/>and environmental advances. While the country did not escape the global economic downturn in <lb/>2008, Brazil has been able to cope with the crisis by relying on sound macroeconomic policies, as <lb/>well as by expanding its social security net, infrastructure and housing investments (World Bank, <lb/>2009a). Real GDP in purchasing power parity (PPP) growth has averaged 4.5% over the 2000-2007 <lb/>period (OECD, 2009) before growth prospects dropped to 0.5% in 2009 because of the crisis (World <lb/>Bank, 2009a). GDP/PPP attained USD 1 833 billion in 2007 (OECD, 2009) but is highly concentrated <lb/>in a few regions: the three major economic states of the south-east (São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, and <lb/>Minas Gerais) account for over half (54.4%) of GDP (IBGE, 2007a). 6 Brazil&apos;s main foreign trade <lb/>partners include the European Union, the United States, Mercosur members, as well as China. <lb/>Population and economic profile <lb/>In 2000 Brazil undertook a census which reported a population close to 170 million inhabitants <lb/>(IBGE, 2002). By 2007 this number had increased to nearly 190 million people, an increase of about <lb/>20 million in only eight years. While the urban population has been constantly rising throughout <lb/>these years (from 142 million in 2001 to 160 million in 2006), the rural population has remained <lb/>relatively constant at 30 million inhabitants (IBGE, 2007b). 7 Estimations of population density show <lb/></body>

			<body>much lower indices in rural areas (6.3 inhabitants/km 2 ) 8 than in urban areas (between 33.1 and <lb/>36.8 inhabitants/km 2 ). 9 Of the total economically active population, the largest share works in <lb/>services (59.6%), followed by industry (28.0%) and agriculture (6.7%) (OECD, 2009). <lb/>There is no officially defined poverty line in Brazil; however, the concept of minimum wage is often <lb/>used in analyses. Accordingly, Silveira and Fernandes (2007) find that the number of indigent people <lb/>decreased from 12.4% in 2001 to about 7.6% in 2005, and the number of poor people from 28.7% <lb/>to 20.8%. 10 Brazil has thus already met the Millennium Development Goal of reducing substantially <lb/>the number of people living in poverty (World Bank, 2009a). Though poverty has been alleviated in <lb/>the past few years, extreme poverty still affects a large population, particularly in the country&apos;s <lb/>rural parts of the north-east (Presidency of the Republic, 2007; Silveira et al., 2007). Average rural <lb/>per-capita income is substantially lower than in urban areas: BRL 312 (USD 171) against BRL 689 <lb/>(USD 377.5) (IBGE, 2007b). Furthermore, rural regions also display less access to public services, <lb/>such as lack of clean water, sanitation, health services, education, and particularly electricity supply, <lb/>further highlighting the gravity of the rural poverty problem (Rosa et al., 2006). <lb/>Energy data <lb/>Brazil&apos; energy matrix is based on a comparatively high use of renewable energy, including large-<lb/>scale hydropower for electricity generation and biofuels for transport (IEA, 2006; EPE, 2008). In <lb/>2007, the country&apos;s overall energy consumption reached 216 million tonnes of oil equivalent <lb/>(Mtoe), with demand driven mainly by petroleum derivates (41.4%, particularly diesel oil and <lb/>gasoline), electricity (16.4%), and sugar cane bagasse (12.4%) (EPE, 2008). Owing to dramatically <lb/>increased production of petroleum, domestic dependence on oil imports has decreased sharply <lb/>over the past years (EPE, 2008; OECD, 2009). Brazil still imports considerable amounts of coal and, <lb/>to a lesser degree, electricity, the latter being obtained in particular from Argentina (EPE, 2008; <lb/>Costa et al., 2008). <lb/>Electricity generation <lb/>Overall domestic electricity supply increased by 5% between 2006 and 2007, reaching a total of <lb/>483.4 TWh (EPE, 2008). This makes Brazil the largest electricity market in South America (IEA, <lb/>2009c). Large hydroelectricity supplies 72.6% of all electricity, followed by thermoelectricity <lb/>generation (14.7%) (EPE, 2008). Installed electricity generating capacity is around 100 GW (EPE, <lb/>2008). It can be assumed that electricity consumption in rural areas is considerably lower than in <lb/>metropolitan areas. This holds particularly for the household sector where poverty levels are higher <lb/>and overall population is low. <lb/>Because of the strong reliance on large hydropower dams for electricity generation, most electric <lb/>energy today (98%) is supplied by the large regionally integrated grid transmission system (also <lb/>known as the Sistema Interligado Nacional, SIN) (ESMAP, 2005). Only in the remote areas of the <lb/>Amazon, which cover about 45% of the Brazilian territory but with only 3% of the national <lb/>population, grid electrification has been in part replaced by decentralised electricity supply <lb/>alternatives: mainly small diesel plants supply isolated villages and towns at a total nominal capacity <lb/>of only about 3 GW (Andrade, 2009a). The cost of electricity generation in these areas is high and <lb/>reaches USD 200/MWh (ESMAP, 2005). This is mainly due to the high costs of fuel and <lb/></body>

			<body>Smaller regions are sometimes covered by authorised rural electrification cooperatives (ESMAP, <lb/>2005). Institutionally, the Ministry of Mines and Energy (MME) oversees the whole power sector <lb/>and is responsible for policy setting. The Brazilian Electricity Regulatory Agency (ANEEL), operating <lb/>under the jurisdiction of the MME, regulates and controls the generation, transmission and <lb/>distribution of power in compliance with current legislation. Eletrobrás is a federally-owned holding <lb/>company for electricity assets, controlling a large part of electric power generation and transmission <lb/>systems mainly through six subsidiary companies, as well as some distribution capacity in the <lb/>Amazon area. The Empresa de Pesquisa Energética (EPE, or Energy Research Company) is <lb/>responsible for the development of integrated long-term planning of Brazil&apos;s power sector, thus <lb/>supporting MME&apos;s national energy policy and long-term planning. <lb/>Urban-rural electricity access <lb/>Access to electricity in rural areas has widened strongly throughout the past years. By 2007, <lb/>55.35 million out of a total 56.34 million permanent residences were connected to electric energy. <lb/>In 2009, the overall Brazilian electrification rate reached 97.8%. The rate is 99.5% in urban areas <lb/>and 88 % in rural areas, putting Brazil among the group of Latin American countries with near-<lb/>universal electricity access (IEA, 2009b). The Ministry of Mines and Energy expects that electricity <lb/>will be available in every single Brazilian household by 2010. A few years ago, only 73% of the rural <lb/>population had access to electricity and 12 million people in 2.5 million households were still <lb/>without electricity (ESMAP, 2005). <lb/>1.2 Institutional structures for rural electrification <lb/>The Brazilian Constitution of 1988 recognises the distribution of electricity as an essential public <lb/>service, for which the federal government is to assume full responsibility, either directly or through <lb/>designated concessions or permits (Goldemberg et al., 2004). 11 Up to the 1990s, rural electrification <lb/>policies were often implemented at the state level, using state treasury resources, and having the <lb/>programmes implemented by concessionaires controlled by state governments (ESMAP, 2005; <lb/>Instituto Acende Brasil, 2007a). Besides these activities, a number of international donors as well as <lb/>non-governmental organisations supported or implemented several non-sectoral and decentralised <lb/>electrification projects in Brazil, with institutional set-ups and responsibilities varying considerably <lb/>between the different programmes (see Goldemberg et al., 2004; ESMAP, 2005; Zerriffi, 2007). <lb/>1.2.1 Major electrification programmes <lb/>Two large federal-led rural electrification programmes – PRODEEM (Programa de Desenvolvimento <lb/>Energético de Estados e de Municípios, or Energy Development Programme of States and <lb/>Municipalities) and Luz no Campo (LnC, Light in the Countryside) – were established in 1994 and <lb/>2000 respectively, however without a clear target for reaching universal access in rural areas. <lb/>Because no specialised federal rural electrification agency existed, PRODEEM and LnC were co-<lb/>ordinated by different actors: LnC by Eletrobrás under coordination of the MME, and PRODEEM <lb/>directly by the MME. Both programmes also drew funding from different sources, the National <lb/>Treasury Funds in the case of PRODEEM, and Reserva Global de Reversão (Global Reversion <lb/>Reserve, or RGR) loans for utilities in the case of LnC (Goldemberg et al., 2004; ESMAP, 2005). The <lb/></body>

			<body>Page | 23 <lb/>RGR was implemented as early as 1971 and has been managed by Eletrobrás. About one-fourth of <lb/>the available RGR resources are set aside by law for low-income consumers in rural areas (ESMAP, <lb/>2005). There were no other significant federal rural electrification funds. <lb/>In 2003 the current rural electrification programme, Luz para Todos (Light for All, or LpT), which is <lb/>to give universal access in the country&apos;s rural areas by 2010, was formalised and implemented. The <lb/>programme is based on the obligation for service providers to universalise rural electricity access <lb/>(as set by the Brazilian Constitution), on substantial federal and state resources for the service <lb/>providers, and on low tariffs for low-income and rural consumers (Zerriffi, 2007; Poppe, 2009). <lb/>1.2.2 Institutional structure – implementation and funding <lb/>On 11 November 2003, LpT was inaugurated. LpT&apos;s original aim was universal access to electricity in <lb/>all rural areas of Brazil by 2008, keeping in mind the five-year deadline defended by ANEEL. In total <lb/>numbers, Lpt was to provide two million rural connections (MME, 2003; Eletrobrás and MME, 2009) <lb/>for free to yet unattended consumers, where each household would also receive an &quot; internal kit &quot; <lb/>containing several power plugs, lamps, and other necessary material (Eletrobrás and MME, 2009). <lb/>Because of the surge of new demands for rural electrification not identified when the programme <lb/>started and for other reasons, the original LpT deadline was postponed to 2010 (Eletrobrás and <lb/>MME, 2009). <lb/>With LpT, a new institutional structure for rural electrification emerged, in which the Regulatory Agency <lb/>ANEEL (established during the electricity sector restructuring process during the 1990s) and Eletrobrás <lb/>play pivotal roles. ANEEL is responsible for the authorisation of concessionaires and other service <lb/>providers (which generally occurs through bidding processes among interested actors) (ESMAP, 2005). <lb/>ANEEL also sets and verifies the annual electrification targets for LpT. Eletrobrás, on the other hand, <lb/>holds the operational secretariat of the programme. This includes carrying out the technical and <lb/>financial analyses of the connections to be installed by the service providers, the allocation of funds to <lb/>these actors, and the supervision of the installations. As with LnC, the MME co-ordinates the <lb/>development of the LpT programme and sets its general policies. Several decision and advisory councils <lb/>at federal and state levels support the institutional structure for rural electrification, dealing with various <lb/>issues such as the promotion of productive uses of energy in newly connected municipalities or the <lb/>setting-up of priority lists for rural electrification operations. These councils generally involve a great <lb/>variety of stakeholders which, depending on the level of the council (federal or state), may include <lb/>representatives from the MME, other ministries, Eletrobrás, ANEEL, local municipalities, unions, and the <lb/>service providers (Eletrobrás, 2008; Eletrobrás and MME, 2009). 12 <lb/>State governments support the federal government&apos;s LpT universalisation strategy by providing part <lb/>of the funds – in the form of grants to the service providers – to finance operations. These <lb/>contributions are on average in the order of 10% of total LpT investments (Instituto Acende Brasil, <lb/>2007a). The main funding sources, however, still come from the federal government: through RGR <lb/>grants and loans (at low interest rates) and grants from the newly implemented Conta de <lb/>Desenvolvimento Energético (Energy Development Account, or CDE) (Strazzi et al., 2008). RGR is <lb/>funded by annual levies on investments by concessionaires, while the CDE was implemented in <lb/>2002 specifically for creating a new instrument to finance the universalisation of rural electricity <lb/>access in Brazil. 13 CDE resources come from a variety of sources, including payments for the use of <lb/></body>

As connection costs within LpT are totally free for rural consumers, <lb/>in general any long-run costs occurring to the service providers (operation and management, <lb/>capital, and replacement costs) following electrification are to be covered by the service providers <lb/>themselves through electricity tariffs (ESMAP, 2005; Instituto Acende Brasil, 2007a). These tariffs <lb/>are subsidised for small consumption levels. More than a third of residential customers (35%) in <lb/>Brazil belong to the low consumer tariff sub-class. A total of 77% of the low-income consumers use <lb/>up to 80 kWh of electricity per month and 23% between 80 and 220 kWh. Low-income consumers <lb/>represent 43% of total consumers in the north, 62% in the north-east, 25% both in the south-east <lb/>and the south, and 29% in the midwest (Instituto Acende Brasil, 2007b). <lb/>Tariff increases due to LpT had been limited to 8% in 2005, so that concessionaires and other <lb/>service providers have limited possibilities to recover their operation and management costs in the <lb/>long run (Instituto Acende Brasil, 2007a). <lb/>1.3 Description of current electrification programmes and <lb/>objectives <lb/>Interestingly enough the creation of a programme aiming to provide universal access to electricity in <lb/>Brazil gained force exactly at a time when two federal-led rural electrification programmes (LnC and <lb/>PRODEEM) were still in their implementation phase. 15 Most centralised concessionaires did not have <lb/>clear univeralisation targets, and particularly privately run concessionaires (with tight budget <lb/>constraints) had little interest in promoting rural electrification because of the high costs of supplying <lb/>electricity services to low-consuming, remote and dispersed households, which would make cost <lb/>recovery of the investments extremely difficult (Goldemberg et al., 2004; Obermaier, 2005). <lb/>As they were unable to reach substantial progress regarding rural electrification, as early as 2000 the <lb/>authorities formed the idea of a universal electricity access programme that would supply electricity to <lb/>all rural properties in Brazil within a five-year period (Cortez and Rosillo-Calle, 2001; Poppe, 2002). <lb/>Particularly taken forward by ANEEL, the following discussions, involving a large variety of stakeholders <lb/>(including representatives from other ministries, MME, Eletrobrás, ANEEL, development banks, <lb/>associations of concessionaires, rural electrification co-operatives, renewable energy trade associations, <lb/>earlier power sector fund. In fact, financial contributions for the CDE remained at the same level compared <lb/>with its predecessor (Poppe, 2009). <lb/>14 Other important resources come from the fuel compensation account (CCC, or Conta de Consumo de <lb/>Combustíveis), which is a levy on all Brazilian electricity consumers. Today it primarily finances thermal <lb/>generation via diesel in the Amazon region (ESMAP, 2005). <lb/>15 Both programmes were criticised throughout their implementation: LnC financed grid electrification for <lb/>some 600 thousand households living near a grid all over Brazil over a period of three years, falling short of <lb/>the initial one million households target as well as in providing inexpensive electrification (Goldemberg et al., <lb/>2004; ESMAP, 2005). The PRODEEM programme provided mainly non-grid solar PV electrification to <lb/>community installations, health facilities and schools. Top-down management with little local stakeholder <lb/>involvement, lack of cost-recovery schemes, and lack of co-ordination with grid electrification plans severely <lb/>affected the results of PRODEEM (Goldemberg et al., 2004; ESMAP, 2005; Costa et al., 2008). <lb/></body>

The target groups for rural electrification <lb/>thus live mainly in the northern and north-eastern states of the country where electricity access at <lb/>the beginning of LpT was lowest in both nominal and relative numbers: in the north-east 1.1 million <lb/>rural households (34.4% of all rural households in the region), and in the north 447 thousand rural <lb/>households (59.7% of all rural households in that region) lacked access to electric energy. <lb/>Altogether, both regions thus accounted for more than 75% of the originally planned installations <lb/>within LpT (Obermaier, 2005; ESMAP, 2005); both rural regions are also those with higher poverty <lb/>rates and less access to other basic services (Rosa et al., 2006). <lb/>Table 1: LpT rural electricity connection timetable (number of households) <lb/>2004 <lb/>2005 <lb/>2006 <lb/>2007 <lb/>2008 <lb/>2009 <lb/>2010 <lb/>Planned installations <lb/>218 470 <lb/>496 630 <lb/>490 334 <lb/>356 050 <lb/>381 344 <lb/>510 197 <lb/>578 429 <lb/>Accumulated <lb/>planned installations <lb/>715 100 <lb/>1 205 434 <lb/>1 561 484 <lb/>1 942 828 <lb/>2 453 025 <lb/>3 031 454 <lb/>Actual installations <lb/>69 999 <lb/>378 046 <lb/>590 013 <lb/>397 877 <lb/>441 427 <lb/>Accumulated <lb/>installations <lb/>448 045 <lb/>1 038 058 <lb/>1 435 935 <lb/>1 877 362 <lb/>Annual deficit <lb/>-148 471 <lb/>-118 584 <lb/>99,679 <lb/>41,827 <lb/>60,083 <lb/>Accumulated deficit <lb/>-267,055 <lb/>-167,376 <lb/>-125,549 <lb/>-65,466 <lb/>Sources: ANEEL (2009), Ministry of Mines and Energy (2009a). <lb/>The timetable for LpT installations until 2010 and actual achievements are shown in Table 1. When <lb/>it started, the LpT programme had considerable difficulties in keeping up with the tight schedule set <lb/>by ANEEL: already by 2005 the deficit of electricity connections had reached nearly 270 thousand <lb/>households. Inexperience with LpT, political and administrative interferences, as well as supply <lb/>shortages of material and services including cables, posts, etc. caused by the explosion of demand <lb/>may explain part of these delays (Andrade, 2009b). In 2006, however, LpT&apos;s actual installations <lb/>surpassed planned installations, and thus led to a declining deficit. In 2008, LpT was about <lb/>65 thousand installations short of the original targets. Finally, the pace of electrification is estimated <lb/>to increase substantially until 2010, with 510 thousand new installations planned for 2009 and <lb/>578 thousand more for 2010, which is far above what had been realised the years before. These <lb/>planned connections correspond mainly to the newly identified rural electrification demand – the <lb/>original LpT target of two million installations had nearly been met in 2008 with 1.88 million <lb/>connections. <lb/></body>

			<note place="footnote">16 Initially ANEEL published a resolution by which universal access was to be attained by 2015. With the <lb/>implementation of LpT, however, this target was brought forward by seven years (2008 instead of the original <lb/>end date of 2015). <lb/></note>

			<body>At the beginning of LpT, Dilma Rousseff, Minister of the MME, defined LpT as &quot; a proposal to reduce <lb/>poverty and hunger, using electricity as a vector for development &quot; (MME, 2003, author&apos;s own <lb/>translation). This statement underlines that rural electrification is prioritised as a key objective of <lb/>Brazil&apos;s overall poverty alleviation strategy (ESMAP, 2005), particularly regarding social inclusion of <lb/>the rural poor (Goldemberg et al., 2004). While prior rural electrification initiatives had <lb/>concentrated mostly on increasing access to infrastructure, it was decreed that a universal access <lb/>strategy should also encompass electricity consumption so as to enable the beneficiaries to use <lb/>electricity as an instrument for economic and social development (Obermaier, 2005). Electricity use <lb/>for the rural poor is promoted essentially through lower tariffs for low-consumption classes, the <lb/>idea being that low consumption is correlated with low income (Zerriffi, 2007). 17 <lb/>1.3.2 Means of electrification under the LpT <lb/>In the operational manual of LpT, three technological options are listed to provide electricity to <lb/>rural households: i) extension of grid distribution lines, ii) decentralised generation in isolated grids, <lb/>and iii) individual systems. Despite these different possibilities for service providers, the Brazilian <lb/>electrification model is primarily based on extension of the grid (Reiche et al., 2006; Zerriffi, 2007; <lb/>Andrade, 2009b). At least during the first years of LpT, grid extensions have often been the least-<lb/>cost option for the utility (Zerriffi, 2007). Thus until 2009, 4.62 million posts, 883 thousand km of <lb/>cable, and 708 thousand transformers have been installed within the universalisation strategy <lb/>(MME, 2009b). <lb/>Large reliance on grid extension to attain universal rural access may not be economical in the future <lb/>as LpT is now expected to reach out to the marginally more remote and dispersed consumers away <lb/>from the existing distribution lines (Instituto Acende Brasil, 2007a; Andrade, 2009b). 18 Nevertheless, <lb/>according to MME, the remaining one million connections planned for 2009 and 2010 (see Table 1) <lb/>will still be realised largely through extensions of the grid. It should be noted that already under the <lb/>LnC phase, lack of incentives to provide low-cost connections and non-grid electrification had been <lb/>perceived (Goldemberg et al., 2004). Connection costs may reach USD 4 000 and more if population <lb/>density is low and consumers are dispersed. These costs are well above any international <lb/>benchmark, and electrification options other than grid extensions may provide much cheaper <lb/>alternatives in such cases (ESMAP, 2005; Reiche et al., 2006). <lb/>Renewable energy has been used very little in the beginning of LpT (Pertusier, 2004). Even by end of <lb/>2006, only around 3 100 solar home systems (SHS) had been installed under LpT, although it had <lb/>been estimated that for 17 500 localities – translating into some 130 000 systems – such systems <lb/>would be the most cost-effective option (IEA, 2009d). Decentralised renewable electrification <lb/>options, by either individual systems or mini-grids, could play a more relevant role during the 2009-<lb/>2010 period, particularly in the remote and isolated villages of the Amazon region. There are still <lb/>many rural isolated communities in the Amazon that cannot be assisted by the conventional <lb/></body>

			<note place="footnote">17 This is not always the case: a study on the impacts of rural electrification in the State of Bahia in the north-<lb/>east of Brazil finds that electricity consumption and income are not strongly correlated, neither on a per-<lb/>capita nor at household level, although families had received electricity three years earlier (Obermaier, 2009). <lb/>18 The options used to connect rural consumers are found in the contracts established between Eletrobràs <lb/>and the concessionaires or other service providers. Thus, information on the costs and technological choices <lb/>are not publicly available. <lb/></note>

			<body>system. 19 However, the use of expensive diesel generators in this region is still the norm (Andrade, <lb/>2009b). It is estimated that in the Amazon region 80% of the unattended communities have less <lb/>than 30 households (Amazonas Energia, 2009), and very few settlements have more than <lb/>100 inhabitants. Because of the distance from the main transmission and distribution lines, grid <lb/>extension for these communities is economically unviable. With the publication of the <lb/>February 2009 Manual de Projetos Especiais of the MME (a special projects manual that establishes <lb/>technical and financial criteria to be applied for electricity services through renewable energies), the <lb/>choice between which renewable energy technology to use, such as solar PV systems, wind and <lb/>hybrid power plants, thermal power plants powered by natural gas or biofuels, mini and micro-<lb/>hydro systems, and vegetable palm oil as a replacement for diesel imports will be done according to <lb/>local conditions (MME, 2009d). However, at the moment only 23 special projects are being analysed <lb/>by Eletrobrás, and there is a strong concern that diesel generators will continue to be used to attain <lb/>universalisation targets if current projects fail to go beyond their pilot testing phase. <lb/>1.4 Costs, incentives and tariffs <lb/>For the ambitious targets of LpT a significant budget was set up during its implementation phase. As the <lb/>LpT programme was a partnership between the federal government, the states and the concessionaires, <lb/>funding resources were to be divided among the various actors, with the federal government taking up the <lb/>largest share (71.5% of investments are covered by the federal government&apos;s power sector funds, 13% by <lb/>the states and 15.5% by the concessionaires). The federal government&apos;s power sector funds direct more <lb/>resources on loans to states with lower electrification rates and in greater need of investment, and fewer <lb/>to regions whose rates are much higher. Initially LpT total costs were estimated at BRL 7.6 billion <lb/>(USD 4.16 billion), with Energy Deelopment Accounts (CDE) and Global Reversion Reserve (RGR) funds <lb/>contributing BRL 5.3 (USD 2.9 billion) or around 75% to the overall budget, and the remainder being split in <lb/>equal shares between the states and the service providers (MME, 2003). According to the calculations <lb/>made at the time, investments were to be particularly high in the northern and north-eastern states of the <lb/>country: with BRL 1.73 billion (USD 0.94 billion) and BRL 2.64 billion (USD 1.44 billion) respectively, these <lb/>states would account for over two-thirds of the total planned investments (Loureiro de Azeredo, 2004). <lb/>When implementation of LpT began, however, overall costs soon increased significantly. By 2007, total <lb/>contracted rural electrification operations had already reached BRL 8.69 billion (USD 4.76 billion) (Instituto <lb/>Acende Brasil, 2007a), implying that the originally planned budget had already been overstepped even <lb/>though rural connections were still significantly behind schedule at that time (about a 125 thousand <lb/>connections short, see Table 1). Current MME estimates (MME, 2009c) show that the LpT budget has <lb/>further increased: the federal share is now at BRL 9.1 billion (USD 5 billion), with total investment costs <lb/>estimated at BRL 12.7 billion (USD 7 billion). Therefore, in only six years, estimated LpT costs have <lb/>increased by 67% over the original BRL 7.6 billion (USD 4.16 billion) initially projected. <lb/>Increased demand for connections in rural areas (one million connections more than initially identified) <lb/>may be responsible for a large share of the cost increases, but it is also likely that electrification costs <lb/>were simply underestimated from the start. The technical standards for rural electricity connections did <lb/></body>

Logistics are strongly affected by <lb/>the tropical climate, which leaves settlements and towns completely isolated from November to April during <lb/>the rainy season when rivers overflow and landscapes change completely (Andrade, 2009b). <lb/></note>

			<body>indeed change since LpT implementation in 2003 (compare Eletrobrás and MME, 2005 and 2009), but it <lb/>is unclear whether these changes had any significant impact on the overall programme costs. 20 <lb/>1.4.1 Framework conditions and business incentives <lb/>Eletrobrás, through the Eletrobrás&apos; Control system, is in charge of contract management and <lb/>supervision, from the establishment of the contracts to the transfer of funds. Eletrobrás uses its <lb/>own monitoring methodology, carrying out sample inspections on site. At the state level, a State <lb/>Managing Committee reviews and prioritises the needs of the communities, and monitors the <lb/>implementation of prioritised works. <lb/>To facilitate smooth implementation of the LpT, minimise misusage of funds, reduce the risk of disruption <lb/>of the work, and advance the disbursement by the concessionaires, financial transfers 21 in the case of grid <lb/>extension are conducted as described in Table 2. <lb/>Table 2: Timeline of funds release for grid extension works <lb/>Quota <lb/>Condition <lb/>Release of funds <lb/>(% of the contract) <lb/>Accumulated release <lb/>(%) <lb/>Initial release <lb/>After signing and complying with all legal <lb/>requirements <lb/>30 <lb/>30 <lb/>2 <lb/>nd release <lb/>With 10% of the physical progress reported by <lb/>Eletrobrás Board of Engineering and <lb/>corresponding financial verification <lb/>20 <lb/>50 <lb/>3 <lb/>rd release <lb/>With 30% of the physical progress reported by <lb/>Eletrobrás Board of Engineering and <lb/>corresponding financial verification <lb/>20 <lb/>70 <lb/>4 <lb/>th release <lb/>With 50% of the physical progress reported by <lb/>Eletrobrás Board of Engineering and <lb/>corresponding financial verification <lb/>20 <lb/>90 <lb/>Final release <lb/>Upon completion of the last physical inspection <lb/>by the Eletrobrás Board of Engineering and final <lb/>financial verification; may result in return of <lb/>resources to Eletrobrás <lb/>Up to 10 <lb/>Up to 100 <lb/>Source: Information provided by the MME. <lb/></body>

			<note place="footnote">20 Finally, it may be suggested that strong reliance on grid electrification (along with a virtual disregard of any other <lb/>supply technologies), as well as difficulties to electrify remote and isolated villages in the Amazon may have driven <lb/>costs upwards. No data are publicly available which could prove this assumption. To verify this, one would have to <lb/>analyse the contracts between Eletrobrás and the concessionaires. They are not publicly available. <lb/>21 Note: if there is a previous contract in force signed under the LpT mandate, the release of funds for the new <lb/>contracts will be subject to the following rules: <lb/>I -The initial release will only occur when the physical progress of the previous contract reaches at least 60%; <lb/>II -The 2nd release will occur only when the physical progress of the previous contract reaches at least 70%; and <lb/>III -The 3rd release will occur only with the credit closure of the previous contract. <lb/></note>

Total funds are released according to the <lb/>timeline presented in Table 3. <lb/>1.4.2 Customer tariffs <lb/>Beneficiaries of LpT usually pay discounted consumer tariffs owing to their low consumption level. <lb/>These so-called &quot; social tariffs &quot; are not linked to LpT, but available also to urban consumers. Those <lb/>who use up to 30 kWh per month pay only 35% of the regular residential tariff, while those <lb/>consuming between 31 kWh and 80 kWh per month pay the reduced tariff of 60% of the regular <lb/>residential tariff. Under certain circumstances a 10% discount can be obtained even by consumers <lb/>who use less than 140 kWh/month to 220 kWh/month (with the upper limit varying regionally), but <lb/>who must also prove that they have a low income. In the states of the north and the north-east 43% <lb/>and 62% of all consumers fall within the social tariff classes, which are the highest rates for all Brazil <lb/>(Instituto Acende Brasil, 2007b). It should be noted that these regions also display the highest <lb/>poverty indices and lowest access rates to a variety of public services. Although low income does <lb/>not always correlate with low consumption levels, recently connected households that live below or <lb/>near the poverty line rarely consume high amounts of electricity but rather around 30 to 40 kWh <lb/>per month (Obermaier, 2005 and 2009). <lb/>In 2007, the average electricity tariff in Brazil was BRL 252.91/MWh (USD 138.5/MWh), with <lb/>residential consumers paying BRL 293.59/MWh (USD 160.8/MWh) and industrial consumers paying <lb/>BRL 216.61/MWh (USD 118.7/MWh). <lb/>1.5 Country-specific challenges and how they were addressed <lb/>Management of the networks <lb/>The LpT programme was created from an already consolidated electricity sector structure, with <lb/>concessionaires having to abide by their system operation and maintenance obligations and to <lb/></body>

			<body>Page | 30 <lb/>follow the regulations in force. A concessionaire is therefore responsible for the management of the <lb/>installed networks, unless it has transferred its obligations to a permit-holder, for example. In the <lb/>case of isolated and remote communities in the Amazon (where costs are extremely high) <lb/>independent producers (that is without a concession) may become the main actors in supplying and <lb/>maintaining rural electricity services. The Special Projects Manual of the MME (MME, 2009d) sets <lb/>the technical, financial and management criteria for the use of renewable energy technologies in <lb/>electrification of isolated communities. <lb/>Means for future capacity expansion <lb/>The focus on household electrification under the LpT programme seems to have led sometimes to <lb/>an undersizing of capacity, including isolated diesel generators in the Amazon region and solar PV <lb/>systems (Zerriffi, 2007). However, no further commitments have been made by the Brazilian <lb/>government regarding future capacity expansion once universal electricity access has been reached. <lb/>Given the unfavourable economics of rural electrification, it can thus be expected that no further <lb/>efforts will be made in the near future to increase loads. If consumers desire better-quality supply, <lb/>they would have to contact their service providers directly. <lb/>Revenue collection <lb/>One of the challenges of the LpT programme is to bring electricity to remote and isolated areas, <lb/>such as in the north, where the programme has not achieved its goal. The current concern is that <lb/>concessionaires may have difficulties in collecting bills in systems that use renewable energies. For <lb/>this reason, the 2009 Special Projects Manual (MME, 2009d) encourages projects that include a <lb/>prepaid solution, whereby consumers pay in advance for the electricity they expect to use, and <lb/>within their financial capacity. Moreover, remote monitoring computer systems are being <lb/>connected to central systems for better supervision. <lb/>Involvement of the rural communities in the decision-making process <lb/>Under the LpT, rural dwellers themselves request the installation of electricity directly to the <lb/>concessionaires. These requests are then analysed and prioritised by State Management <lb/>Committees (CGE) according to the characteristics of the locality. To date, 26 Brazilian states have <lb/>State Management Committees, which are composed of members of the federal government, the <lb/>state government, the concessionaires and rural electrification co-operatives, regulatory agencies, <lb/>mayors and the civil society. These committees meet regularly to assess requests and prioritise <lb/>work. The involvement of the civil society is fundamental in the electrification process, as it <lb/>improves the planning and implementation process and gives communities a sense of ownership of <lb/>the electrification process. <lb/>Progress monitoring <lb/>As mentioned before, Eletrobrás uses its own monitoring methodology through on-site inspections. <lb/>At the state level, a State Managing Committee reviews and prioritises the needs of the targeted <lb/>communities, and monitors the implementation of the works. This monitoring is linked to the <lb/>release of funds for further works, and allows to follow-up the work of the concessionaires. <lb/>Implementation of other policies in parallel to the LpT <lb/>The Commissão Nacional de Universalização (National Universalisation Commission, CNU), which is <lb/>part of the LpT institutional structure and formed by Brazilian federal ministries, including the MME, <lb/>the Brazilian Development Bank (BNDES) and the Regulatory Agency ANEEL, establishes policies and <lb/>directives for electricity use to promote integrated rural development. The MME has also <lb/>established united action protocols with other ministries so as to facilitate the improvement or <lb/>even the creation of basic health and education services, water supply, and communication in the <lb/>communities, along with rural electrification.

			<body>programme and other recent activities such as a social housing project or the national biodiesel <lb/>programme are examples of policies designed for the same groups targeted by LpT, namely the <lb/>rural poor. Together, these activities may lead to a more sustainable rural economic development. <lb/>More direct actions under LpT include the construction of so-called Centros Comunitários de <lb/>Produção (CCP), community centres which are to promote a rational and efficient use of electricity <lb/>for productive purposes. Initially CCPs were to be installed throughout Brazil (MME, 2003) but the <lb/>total number is expected to be relatively low. For example, Eletrobrás has so far managed to <lb/>establish only three CCPs, none of which is located in remote and poor municipalities. The MME is <lb/>currently in the process of contracting specialists which are to work directly with CCPs, so that more <lb/>efforts in this regard can be expected. <lb/>In 2008, the federal government launched the Programa Territórios da Cidadania (Territories of <lb/>Citizenship Programme). This programme is a joint ministerial effort to promote economic growth <lb/>through territorial development to improve the quality of life of the people living in rural or poor <lb/>regions. The MME has joined other ministries in this effort currently implemented in 120 selected <lb/>territories and to be ended in 2010. <lb/>The LpT programme makes hardly any room for energy efficiency policies. There is only one <lb/>example in the current version of the LpT operational manual, which states that the complete kit to <lb/>be installed with the electricity connection will contain fluorescent lamps which are more efficient <lb/>(Eletrobrás and MME, 2009). Otherwise, no comprehensive approach seems to have been taken to <lb/>ensure efficient energy use by the new consumers. <lb/>Other country-specific challenges and how they were addressed <lb/>Several country-specific challenges regarding LpT rural electrification were identified: i) reaching <lb/>universal access by concessionaires that in some cases are in great financial difficulties, ii) finding <lb/>technological and organisational solutions for the Amazon region, and iii) ensuring long-term <lb/>sustainability of the programme once funds have run out. Most of these challenges had been <lb/>identified even before LpT was implemented. Given that they have not been addressed properly, <lb/>most problems remain (Poppe, 2009). <lb/>The concessionaires have access to the Energy Development Accounts (CDE) and Global Reversion <lb/>Reserve (RGR) funds as well as to state subsidies in order to finance installations for rural <lb/>consumers to receive free electricity access under LpT. According to the overall funding schemes, <lb/>fewer subsidies are granted to states with higher electrification rates and where electrification can <lb/>be achieved at lower cost, whereas states with low rural access and higher costs receive larger <lb/>federal subsidies. Such flexibility allows for relatively uniform tariffs throughout the country, so that <lb/>customers in remote places do not have to pay disproportionately high bills because they are <lb/>difficult to reach by the concessionaires or other service providers. <lb/>Combined with this, in some cases, a concessionaire may have many consumers with low <lb/>consumption levels to whom the so-called social tariffs apply. These discounted tariffs make cost <lb/>recovery extremely difficult even with LpT subsidies, particularly for utilities that in addition have <lb/>low rates of rural electricity access (ESMAP, 2005). In these cases, privately owned concessionaires <lb/>often charge their wealthier, urban consumers higher tariffs in order to cross-subsidise rural <lb/>consumers. Public concessionaires with softer budget constraints are usually allowed to show <lb/>losses, thus reducing the need to cross-subsidise (Zerriffi, 2007). However, as the current rural <lb/>electrification strategy could well lead to rapidly rising electricity tariffs, the tariff impact of LpT was <lb/>limited to 8%, which in turn strongly affected the concessionaires&apos; ability to proceed with rural <lb/>electrification. In case the tariff impact would rise above 8%, original universalisation schedules <lb/>would have to be postponed until the conditions within the concession area had improved, insofar <lb/></body>

			<body>as continued electrification could be undertaken without going beyond the 8% limit. In fact, since <lb/>2005 there have been twelve cases of concessionaires that had to interrupt their rural <lb/>electrification programmes before reaching universal access because of this restriction (Instituto <lb/>Acende Brasil, 2007a). <lb/>Furthermore, ensuring cost recovery under LpT poses problems. Service providers are likely to still <lb/>require subsidies even after LpT reaches its universalisation target. This is because costs for <lb/>operation and management, capital and replacement have to be incorporated into the calculations <lb/>by the service providers (Instituto Acende Brasil, 2007a). Where low consumption levels remain, <lb/>concessionaires are expected to face serious problems, especially if they are already in financial <lb/>difficulties. Finally, it should be noted that the current model also creates problems in case of a <lb/>greater use of distributed generation technologies. For example, independent producers <lb/>implementing mini-grids are unlikely to use cross-subsidisation mechanisms when the consumer <lb/>base is small, thus making it impossible for the producer to charge the social tariffs (Zerriffi, 2007). <lb/>Finally, the rural isolated communities, located for the most part in the Amazon region, will be <lb/>serviced through the guidelines of the Special Manual Projects. But since these guidelines have <lb/>been released at a very late stage (in 2009), only a few projects have yet been undertaken. <lb/>1.6 Rural electrification progress, assessment and conclusion <lb/>The Brazilian LpT rural electrification programme is now well known internationally because of its <lb/>ambitious targets and its success in carrying out the necessary investments and installations. In <lb/>Brazil, LpT was since its beginning considered as one of the few programmes with the potential to <lb/>significantly improve living conditions in rural Brazil (Loureiro de Azeredo, 2004). While operations <lb/>have been lagging behind the originally agreed universalisation plans, the current pace of LpT <lb/>installations is such that the 2010 deadline is within reach. In June 2009, the number of connections <lb/>had surpassed two million so that over ten million people have now benefited directly from LpT. <lb/>The original target (two million rural connections) established in 2003 has been met. However, <lb/>reaching universal access in the poorer and sparsely populated northern and north-eastern states <lb/>has proven to be a more difficult task (Instituto Acende Brasil, 2007; Poppe, 2009). It is estimated <lb/>that up to 2010 another million connections will be brought to the rural areas of Brazil, benefiting <lb/>to some five more million people (Presidency of the Republic, 2009). Considerable difficulties can be <lb/>expected for this last million connections, as grid electrification may no longer be a feasible option <lb/>for many communities, particularly in the Amazon region. According to the MME, grid extension will <lb/>continue to play a substantial role in connecting the remaining one million households within LpT. <lb/>Table 4 summarises the actual results of LpT including the latest data available for 2009. <lb/>Table 4: Rural electricity connections installed under LpT in Brazil and by region <lb/>(including information until May 2009) <lb/>North <lb/>North-east <lb/>Midwest <lb/>South-east <lb/>South <lb/>Brazil <lb/>Accumulated <lb/>installations <lb/>342 755 <lb/>995 665 <lb/>143 219 <lb/>357 009 <lb/>161 787 <lb/>2 000 435 <lb/>Number of <lb/>beneficiaries <lb/>1 713 775 <lb/>4 978 325 <lb/>716 095 <lb/>1 785 045 <lb/>808 935 <lb/>10 002 175 <lb/>Source: Ministry of Mines and Energy (2009a) for geographical regions; Presidency of the Republic (2009) for <lb/>Brazil.

			<note place="footnote">The postponement of the original 2008 deadline can be explained by several factors: the number of <lb/>rural households to benefit from electricity access was greatly underestimated; occasionally <lb/>administrative inexperience or interferences by various stakeholder levels; delays by service <lb/>providers because of their obligation to limit the tariff impact of LpT to 8%; higher costs and <lb/>sometimes depleted stocks for electrification material and services. Nevertheless, it should be <lb/>acknowledged that even with the postponement of the deadlines, LpT schedules are still <lb/>impressive, and missing the 2008 target should not have come as a total surprise. <lb/>While there is little doubt that LpT will succeed in providing universal access to electricity, it is <lb/>important to note that several obstacles need to be overcome not only regarding the current focus <lb/>on electricity access, but also regarding questions about the financial and economic long-term <lb/>sustainability of the programme. The twin policies of universal access (high costs) and low tariffs <lb/>(low revenues) for concessionaires lead to a very difficult situation even when accounting for the <lb/>subsidies the utilities receive (Zerriffi, 2007) as operation and management, capital and <lb/>replacement costs need to be covered by the service providers in the long run. 22 The dominance of <lb/>grid electrification − even when little productive use can be expected in the near future − is causing <lb/>this problem, further compromising the financial balance of the utilities. Promoting productive uses <lb/>of electricity in order to raise utilities&apos; revenues is thus vital to guarantee the long-term success of <lb/>the electrification installations once LpT comes to an end (Zerriffi, 2007). <lb/>Despite the efforts to promote such uses, the impacts of LpT so far seem to be much more on the <lb/>consumption side than on the production side. An ex post study on the benefits of LpT found that, <lb/>thanks to the programme, households find their living conditions significantly improved. <lb/>Furthermore, purchases of household appliances such as TVs, refrigerators and sound systems have <lb/>increased. Other positive impacts of LpT are better conditions to study, for longer hours during the <lb/>day and the evening, as well as increased work opportunities (MME, 2009). It is unclear whether <lb/>these perceived benefits will eventually result in, for example, higher family incomes. <lb/>22 This is the case for service providers that cannot show losses, particularly privately owned concessionaires. <lb/></note>

			<body>Page | 35 <lb/>2 China <lb/>China, with strong political will, extended its electricity grids and exploited the country&apos;s <lb/>hydropower and solar potential. China achieved an electrification rate of 99.4% in 2009, with rural <lb/>areas reaching 99% and urban areas 100% (IEA, 2009b). Over the last ten years, rural electrification <lb/>has slowed down because of nearly complete nationwide electrification. The emphasis is put on <lb/>modernisation, service and quality improvements, poverty alleviation and introduction of <lb/>innovative technology solutions for the remaining non-electrified remote areas in the vast western <lb/>regions of the country. China will now focus mainly on the use of decentralised power systems to <lb/>supply, by the end of 2020, most of the people who are still without electricity. <lb/>2.1 Introduction and country description <lb/>China, with a land area of 9.6 million square kilometres, is the world&apos;s third-largest country by <lb/>geographical extent. China, with 22 147 km of land boundaries, shares its borders with a total of <lb/>14 countries, namely, Afghanistan, Bhutan, Burma (Myanmar), India, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Laos, <lb/>Mongolia, Nepal, North Korea, Pakistan, Russia, Tajikistan and Vietnam. China is characterised by <lb/>three climatic zones: tropical, subtropical and temperate. <lb/>Economic data and investment <lb/>In 2008, China&apos;s economy grew by 9%, with a gross domestic product (GDP) of USD 4 400 billion <lb/>(bn). The primary sector amounted to USD 501.6 bn (11.3% of GDP), the secondary sector to <lb/>USD 2 138.4 bn (48.6% of GDP) and the tertiary sector to USD 1 764.4 bn (40.1% of GDP) (National <lb/>Bureau of Statistics China, 2009). If measured in purchasing power parity (PPP), China&apos;s GDP grew to <lb/>USD 7 903 bn in 2008, ranking second after the United States (World Bank, 2009b). <lb/>In China, foreign investment is generally driven by directives from the central government that sets <lb/>detailed rules for numerous parameters such as technology, location and investment size. China <lb/>proactively guides and encourages foreign investments in new and renewable energies, while <lb/>restricting investment in conventional coal-fired power plants. At present, procedures for approval <lb/>of foreign direct investment (FDI) projects are in accordance with the &quot; Regulation on Guiding the <lb/>Direction of Foreign Investment &quot; (February 2002, Decree of the State Council) and with the <lb/> &quot; Decision of the State Council on the Reform of Investment System &quot; , July 2004). <lb/>With respect to investment in energy structures, under &quot; The Directory of Industry for Foreign <lb/>Investment &quot; (revised in 2007), foreign investment is encouraged in &quot; the construction and operation <lb/>of hydropower stations, giving priority to electricity &quot; , and &quot; the construction and operation of new <lb/>energy power stations (including solar energy, wind energy, magnetic energy, geothermal energy, <lb/>tidal and wave energy, biomass energy, etc.) &quot; . Foreign investment is prohibited in &quot; the construction <lb/>and operation of coal-fired steam-condensing power plants with the stand-alone capacity of <lb/>300 000 kilowatts (kW) and below, the coal-fired dual units of steam-condensing and extracting, <lb/>heat and power co-generation plants with the stand-alone capacity of 100 000 kW and below, <lb/>outside the range of Tibet, Xinjiang, Hainan minor power grids &quot; . <lb/>Population and its economic profile <lb/>With a total population of 1 325 bn people in 2008 (World Bank, 2009c), China ranks first in the <lb/>world. Almost half of the population (45%) live in cities while 55 % live in rural areas. In the past, <lb/></body>

			<body>Page | 36 <lb/>subject to a strict local residence permit system, domestic migration from rural to urban areas was <lb/>nearly impossible. In recent years, rural to urban migration has been more prominent. In this <lb/>context, latest estimates suggest that China&apos;s urbanisation rate will increase by nearly 1% per year <lb/>during the next 15 to 20 years, which represents around 300 million people who will move from <lb/>rural areas into cities (China Daily, 2009). Today, China&apos;s average population density is <lb/>approximately 138 per km 2 (Wikipedia, 2009b), but with extreme variations in rural population <lb/>densities, ranging from less than one to more than 400 per km 2 . In stark contrast, the highest urban <lb/>population density per km 2 is 50 000 to 60 000 as in the case of central Beijing, Shanghai and <lb/>Chongqing (China Daily, 2009). <lb/>Of the total working population, 40.8% are employed in agriculture, 26.8 % in industry and 32.4% in <lb/>services (National Bureau of Statistics of China, 2008). With China&apos;s rapid economic development, <lb/>the income of Chinese residents has risen steadily. In 2008, the gross national income per capita per <lb/>atlas method amounted to USD 2 770 (global country ranking 130 out of 210 countries) and <lb/>accordingly purchasing power parity amounted to USD 6 020 (global country ranking 122 out of <lb/>210 countries) (World Bank, 2009d). <lb/>At the end of 2008, China&apos;s national employment amounted to 774.80 million people, of which <lb/>39.01% lived in urban areas. A total of 40.07 million people in rural areas lived below the poverty <lb/>level, 23 defined as CNY 1 196 24 (approximately USD 75) per capita per annum (National Bureau of <lb/>Statistics of China, 2009). <lb/>Electricity generation and consumption <lb/>In 2008, total electricity production amounted to 3.45 trillion kWh, an increase of 5.6% compared to <lb/>2007. Thermal power accounted for 81.2% of total production, with hydropower accounting for <lb/>16.5% and nuclear energy for 2%. Forecasts for 2009 suggest that total power consumption will <lb/>increase by 3.5%, to 3.56 trillion kWh. According to estimates by the Power Economic Research <lb/>Institute of the State Grid Corporation, national consumption of electricity is expected to reach <lb/>approximately 3.94 trillion kWh by 2015 and approximately 7.425 trillion kWh by 2020 (State Grid <lb/>Corp. Power Economic Research Institute, Jiang Liping, 2009). <lb/>Figure 2: China&apos;s national power generation structure (in %) in 2008 <lb/>Source: State Grid Corp. Power Economic Research Institute, Jiang Liping (2009). <lb/>In 2007, total electricity consumption amounted to 3.27 TWh, comprising of 58.8% urban <lb/>consumption and 41.2% rural consumption (NBS and NDRC, 2008). <lb/></body>

			<body>Installed capacity and energy consumption <lb/>By the end of 2008, China&apos;s total installed power generation capacity amounted to 793 GW, an <lb/>increase of 10.4% since 2007. In 2009, an additional 80 GW is expected to be installed, and by 2020 <lb/>total capacity should more than double, reaching 1 600 GW with thermal power accounting for 65% <lb/>(State Grid Corp. Power Economic Research Institute, Jiang Liping, 2009). Owing to its coal-<lb/>dominated energy supply structure, thermal power generation capacity accounts for more than <lb/>75% of total installed capacity and China ranks first worldwide in hard coal 25 production, producing <lb/>47.4 % of the world&apos;s total hard coal in 2008 (IEA, 2009c). <lb/>Figure 3: China&apos;s power generation capacity (in %) in 2008 <lb/>Source: State Grid Corp. Power Economic Research Institute, Jiang Liping (2009). <lb/>China&apos;s 2008 total energy consumption amounted to 1 995 million tonnes of oil equivalent (Mtoe) <lb/>with coal accounting for 70%. In 2008, total consumption amounted to 2.74 bn tonnes (a 3% <lb/>increase compared to 2007) of which approximately 40 Mt of coal had been imported. In the first <lb/>half of 2009, approximately 48.2 Mt were imported, an increase of 126.3 % (State Grid Corp. Power <lb/>Economic Research Institute, Jiang Liping, 2009). Total consumption of oil in 2008, mainly used in <lb/>the transport sector, amounted to 360 Mt with domestic production accounting for roughly half. <lb/>China, after the United States and Japan, is the third-largest oil importer in the world. Recent <lb/>estimates by the Energy Research Institute (ERI) of China suggest that by 2020, the oil consumption <lb/>may reach 620 Mt, of which approximately 60% will have to be imported. Although its share in total <lb/>energy consumption has increased over the years, natural gas only represented 3.63% of total <lb/>energy consumption in 2008. The government is seeking to increase that share to 10% by 2020 <lb/>(State Grid Corp. Power Economic Research Institute, Jiang Liping, 2009). <lb/>During the 11 th Five-Year Plan (2006-2010) the Chinese government plans to reduce energy use per <lb/>unit of GDP by 20%. In this context, a reduction of 1.79% was achieved in 2006, 4.04% in 2007 and <lb/>4.59 % in 2008 leading to a cumulative reduction of 10.4% (Energy Research Institute Han, Wenke <lb/>2009). Additional efforts will be needed to reach the 20% target. <lb/></body>

			<body>Figure 4: China&apos;s energy consumption structure (in %) in 2008 <lb/>Source: Energy Research Institute, Han, Wenke (2009). <lb/>Institutions involved in the power sector <lb/>Over the past 50 years, China&apos;s power management system has been in the process of continual <lb/>adjustment and changes. Before 1985, China centralised planning and management of the power <lb/>industry system, whereby the only decision-making body was the central government which was <lb/>directly responsible for production and allocation of resources. The system was managed through a <lb/>combination of central government and enterprises, and all investment and operation funds were <lb/>allocated by the State, while all the revenues were allocated to the Treasury. In 1985, the State <lb/>Council approved the &quot; Provisional Regulation on Encouragement of Fund-raising for Power Plants <lb/>and Implementation of Varied Prices &quot; , with the introduction of a new principle whereby the <lb/>enterprise now runs the power plant and the State manages the grid. Provinces were then also <lb/>allowed to manage power. The central government therefore gradually relaxed the regulation and <lb/>control on market access and pricing of the power industry, and at the same time delegated part of <lb/>the authority to local governments. Since then, the Chinese electricity market has shifted from <lb/>central planning to more private investment, competition and less regulation. Relevant policies are <lb/>therefore frequently adjusted and it is difficult to predict how far this liberalisation process will go <lb/>in the future. <lb/>Today, authority over the energy sector at the national level is distributed over a dozen of <lb/>governmental agencies of which the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) plays <lb/>the most important role. Such a wide distribution of responsibilities has impaired co-ordination, <lb/>formulation, implementation and enforcement of energy policies. In its latest attempt to create an <lb/>effective national energy institution, the government established the National Energy Commission <lb/>(NEC) and the National Energy Administration (NEA) in March 2008. The latter has a broad <lb/>mandate, which includes drafting energy plans and policies, negotiating with international energy <lb/>agencies, and approving foreign energy investments. A more detailed overview of NEA&apos;s individual <lb/>departments is shown in Table 5. <lb/>Despite being a formal establishment, the NEA lacks the authority to set energy prices, which has <lb/>remained with the NDRC. Although, the NEA submits suggestions concerning energy price <lb/>adjustments to the NDRC, it is the latter and ultimately the State Council whose approval is required <lb/>for any major energy price change. In China, the responsibility for electricity pricing rests with the <lb/>State Electricity Regulatory Commission (SERC), an independent regulator established under the <lb/>State Council in 2003. The SERC performs administrative and regulatory duties with regard to the <lb/>national electric power sector in accordance with prevailing laws and regulations. <lb/></body>

			<body>Page | 41 <lb/>China&apos;s current electrification status <lb/>Authority concerning rural electrification policy planning and financing is located at central and <lb/>provincial levels, but is also shared among different government institutions. Related responsibilities <lb/>may differ regionally and are usually difficult to locate in the relatively complex administrative system. <lb/>In 1996, with the introduction of the Electric Power Law, the State began to implement preferential <lb/>policies for rural electrification, giving major support for ethnic minority settlements, remote areas and <lb/>poverty stricken areas. Moreover, the central government promoted the development of water <lb/>resources in rural areas, building small and medium-sized hydropower stations to boost rural <lb/>electrification. The State encouraged and supported the use of solar energy, wind energy, geothermal <lb/>energy, biomass and other energy sources so as to increase the power supply in rural areas. In 1999, the <lb/>State Council approved the &quot; Notification on Accelerating the Reform of Rural Power Systems and <lb/>Enhancing Rural Power Management &quot; (the State Council Doc. No. 2 1999), which carried out a <lb/>comprehensive structural reform of the management of rural electrification which affected rural power <lb/>marketing, rural power prices, power grids, investment and management. The reform introduced, <lb/>among other things, a practice whereby rural and urban residents in one province would pay the same <lb/>price for electricity. In 2002, the State Council&apos;s &quot; Circular on Program of Power System Reform &quot; (the <lb/>State Council Doc. No.5 2002) introduced the practice of &quot; Separation of Power Plants from Grid, and <lb/>Bidding for Generation &quot; , and the State Power Corporation was split into the two power grid companies <lb/>and five power generation groups.

In 2006, a total of 11.5 million people were still lacking <lb/>electricity access (see Table 7), with wide variations among provinces. In late-2007, 11.5 million people <lb/>had still no access to electricity (March 2008, China Mid and Long-Term Renewable Energy Development <lb/>Plan by 2020, NDRC). Latest statistics from the National Energy Administration suggest that in 2008, <lb/>2 million rural households still lacked electricity in China, which represents some 9 to10 million people <lb/>(Tang, 2009). Through the deployment of decentralised power systems, the government aims to supply <lb/>10 million people with electricity by the end of 2020. The government however expects that beyond <lb/>2020 some Chinese households will still be lacking electricity. <lb/>2.2 Institutional structure for rural electrification <lb/>The institutional structure responsible for the Chinese electrification process underwent numerous <lb/>changes in the course of the last 50 years. Today, along with the realignment of formerly vertical <lb/>planning structures of the 1990s, rural electrification programmes and projects are hosted by <lb/>numerous entities, divided horizontally by administrative levels and vertically by topic. <lb/>2.2.1 Institutional structure – implementing agencies <lb/>At present, five major government institutions have different functions and responsibilities in the field of <lb/>rural electrification. In addition to the State Electricity Regulatory Commission (SERC), the State Grid <lb/>Corporation of China (SGCC), the Ministry of Water Resources (MWR), the Ministry of Agriculture (MOA) <lb/>and the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) are all considered to be influential in the <lb/>field of rural electrification. In general, the NDRC approves the rural electrification programmes <lb/>proposed by the National Energy Administration (NEA). The department for new and renewable energy <lb/>of the NEA deals with the bulk of planning related to rural electrification. Recently, the NDRC released <lb/>two guiding documents concerning rural electrification: China&apos;s Renewable Energy Development Plan <lb/>(2006-2010) released in March 2008, and China&apos;s Mid and Long-Term Renewable Energy Development <lb/>Plan until 2020, released in September 2007. <lb/>Regarding the actual electrification efforts, implementing actors differ according to whether <lb/>electrification is undertaken through grid extension or through decentralised systems. <lb/>In the case of decentralised electrification, actual implementation is being done through <lb/>competitive bidding procedures such as in the Township Programme or occasionally through single <lb/>source selection. Implementation agencies can be formerly government-owned companies, start-up <lb/>companies that were formerly government-owned enterprises, or private companies. In general, <lb/>ownership is very challenging to determine, as China is moving from 100% government-owned <lb/>enterprises to private ownership, and the various forms of ownership are often not entirely <lb/>transparent. In the case of rural electrification through grid extension, the State Grid Corporation of <lb/>China and the Chinese Southern Power Grid proceed to the actual implementation. <lb/>In the case of electrification through grid extension, implementation is undertaken by the grids themselves. <lb/>2.2.2 Institutional structure – funding <lb/>According to the regulation contained in &quot; Views on Accelerating the Reform of the Rural Power <lb/>System and Enhancing the Rural Power Management &quot; , the central government has primarily <lb/></body>

			<body>Page | 43 <lb/>increased investment for rural power grid construction and transformation through loans from the <lb/>Agricultural Bank of China. Apart from these loans, power companies are encouraged by the central <lb/>government to seek funding for their activities through normal loan procedures. Local governments <lb/>at all administrative levels are also required to increase their support for rural power grid <lb/>construction, and provincial power corporations can borrow funds from them as well. Nowadays <lb/>there is a wide variety of financing sources – government and private – available, through grants, <lb/>loans, direct investment and in-kind contributions (Yao &amp; Barnes, 2007). Government subsidies are <lb/>usually linked to development programmes that include the promotion of new technologies <lb/>(e.g. photovoltaic systems, small-scale wind turbines, biogas applications), electrification of areas <lb/>with unfavourable conditions or social measures such as poverty alleviation. <lb/>In 1987, a special interest-bearing loan for rural energy was created by the government. This loan <lb/>mainly supported large-scale biogas projects, solar thermal, and small-scale wind power <lb/>technologies. By 1996, the loan amounted to approximately CNY 0.12 bn (USD 17 million). The <lb/>interest on the enterprises&apos; loan was subsidised 50% by the commercial bank. This special loan <lb/>supported the promotion of the small-scale wind turbine industry and off-grid wind power. But <lb/>today, centrally planned rural electrification programmes using decentralised renewable energy <lb/>applications are entirely financed either by the central government or through a cost-sharing <lb/>scheme which features a financial contribution by the respective provincial government. The <lb/> &quot; Township Electrification Programme &quot; , which financially supported the construction of off-grid <lb/>renewable energy systems (hydropower, photovoltaic systems, wind) in eleven provinces over <lb/>2002-2005, featured a joint financing scheme. The level of social and economic development in <lb/>each of the eleven provinces determined the level of funding granted by the central government. In <lb/>Tibet, for example, the central government covered 100% of the cost incurred by electrification <lb/>efforts, whereas in Qinghai only 80% and in Sichuan only 50% of the costs were covered. Therefore, <lb/>financing commitment for renewable energies is ensured by the government. In addition, the <lb/>government will formulate and implement rural renewable energy tax policies and regulations that <lb/>encourage public and private investment in renewable energy service companies (RESCOs) and that <lb/>ensure extensive renewable energy applications in the vast rural areas of China. China will also <lb/>provide tax incentives on renewable energy technology development and utilisation, on technical <lb/>research and development and on equipment manufacturing (NDRC, 2008). <lb/>2.2.3 Institutional structure – recovery process <lb/>At present, China&apos;s rural power management system follows the principle of &quot; one county 26 one <lb/>power supply enterprise &quot; , ensuring the integrated power management at all administrative levels <lb/>within a county. Therefore, all dwellers in a county are supposed to pay the same price for <lb/>electricity. Power supply enterprises charge fees according to the household consumption recorded <lb/>by metering at the national ratified electricity price. Electricity metering devices are certified by the <lb/>government. Both are measures to unify and standardise the electricity management and supply <lb/>structures (metering, billing, price) and at the same time to improve the quality of the service <lb/>(reliability, electrical stability). <lb/></body>

			<body>Page | 44 <lb/>2.3 Description of current electrification programmes and <lb/>objectives <lb/>In China, the traditional approach to providing electricity to rural areas is mainly through grid <lb/>extension. However, the long transmission lines often result in a small load and huge line losses. At <lb/>present, most regions without electricity are located in western regions and islands in the eastern <lb/>coastal areas, far away from the grid. Most of these areas are rich in renewable energy resources <lb/>(hydropower, solar and wind energy) which can practically and economically provide electrification <lb/>to remote regions. In rural China, electricity is supplied through three channels: a county is <lb/>connected to a national grid, or is supplied through local dispatch, or is self-supplied. Following this <lb/>pattern, China implemented the &quot; Brightness Programme &quot; and the &quot; County Hydropower <lb/>Construction of National Rural Electrification &quot; , using small hydropower, wind and solar power <lb/>generation for the electrification of rural areas. <lb/>2.3.1 Historical rural electrification and expected end-use <lb/>Development of China&apos;s rural electrification can be divided into three main stages (Peng &amp; Pan, <lb/>2006). During the first stage (1949-1977), rural communities were the main investors in rural <lb/>electrification efforts; during the second stage (1978-1997) the central, provincial and local <lb/>governments all played fundamental roles; and during the third stage (since 1998) the central <lb/>government is the main investor. In 1997 the government noted that rural electricity supply <lb/>suffered from a number of problems. First of all, the rural grid was old, leading to unreliable and <lb/>unsafe electricity supply. Often the grid had been badly planned and built, leading to poor <lb/>electricity quality and supply disruptions. Large wire losses were pushing electricity tariffs to <lb/>extremes (Peng &amp; Pan, 2006). As a consequence, in 1988 the government launched a major reform <lb/>of the rural power management system, transformed and renovated the rural grids with a view to <lb/>unifying electricity prices for urban and rural dwellers within a same grid. Seven years of grid <lb/>reconstruction and transformation have cost USD 49.5 billion to the Chinese government. 27 The <lb/>provincial grid companies managed and operated the renovation of the rural grids, while the costs <lb/>of network improvement were amortised through the national electricity tariff. Thanks to these <lb/>efforts, the structure of rural power grids were improved and safe operation enhanced the <lb/>reliability (to 99.7%) and the quality of power supply. Moreover, losses due to transmission of high-<lb/>voltage grids dropped to 10%, while losses in low-voltage grids dropped by 30% to 45% compared <lb/>to 12% before the grid improvement. 28 This significantly reduced electricity prices in rural areas and <lb/>facilitated the levelling of electricity prices, leading to strong growth in the demand for electricity. <lb/>Over the last ten years, rural electrification has slowed down as a result of nearly universal <lb/>electrification (around 99%). At present, the emphasis is on modernisation, service and quality <lb/>improvements, poverty alleviation and introduction of new technologies (Yao &amp; Barnes, 2007) and <lb/>innovative solutions for the remaining non-electrified remote areas in the vast western regions of <lb/>China. Table 8 illustrates the characteristics of the five main periods of Chinese rural electrification. <lb/>27 Data provided by the Institute of Energy and Environmental Protection (IEEP), and the Chinese Academy of <lb/>Agricultural Engineering (CAEE) for this Information Paper. <lb/>28 Data provided by the IEEP. <lb/></body>

(2006); Yao &amp; Barnes (2007). <lb/>2.3.2 China&apos;s current rural electrification programmes and <lb/>achievements <lb/>Brightness Programme and Township Electrification Programme <lb/>In 1996, the then State Development Planning Commission (SDPC) (called National Development <lb/>and Reform Commission, NDRC, since 1996) launched the so-called &quot; Brightness Programme &quot; the <lb/>aim of which was to supply approximately 23 million people living in remote rural areas with <lb/>electricity services by means of decentralised energy systems based on renewable energy resources <lb/>such as hydropower, solar and wind by 2010. The goal was to provide 100 watts of capacity per <lb/>person. During a pilot phase (1999-2002) in Inner Mongolia, 5 500 hybrid PV/wind/battery <lb/>household systems; in Gansu 10 000 solar home systems (SHS); in Tibet 30 PV/battery village power <lb/>systems and 11 000 SHS were installed. According to estimations, approximately 50 000 persons <lb/>had been supplied with electricity. As part of the Brightness Programme, the so-called &quot; Township <lb/>Electrification Programme &quot; (2002-2005), with a total investment of CNY 4.7 bn (USD 0.69 bn) <lb/>consisting of special central and local government funds, was used to supply electricity to 989 rural <lb/>townships and villages throughout western China. By the end of this programme, 1.3 million people <lb/>had access to electricity by means of PV, PV/wind hybrid, and small hydropower stations <lb/>(NDRC, 2008). <lb/>In 2002 and 2005, 842 737 people were supplied with electricity through the Township Programme <lb/>(see Table 9). <lb/></body>

Moreover, water authorities are <lb/>responsible for building small hydropower stations to replace conventional energy sources for <lb/>cooking and heating, supplying 1.7 million rural households (around 6.77million people). The goal is <lb/>to ensure electricity access to at least 99.9% of China (Chen Lei, 2009). <lb/>By the end of 2008, 45 000 small hydropower stations were installed with a combined capacity of <lb/>51 GW, supplying electricity to 300 million people living in rural areas with hydropower sources. 31 In <lb/>this context, the electrification rate in rural hydropower areas increased from 40% in 1980 to <lb/>99.96% in 2008. In the course of the 10 th Five-Year Plan the central government spent CNY 115.5 bn <lb/>(USD 16.94 bn) to support the construction of 410 small hydropower stations with a total capacity <lb/>of 10.6 GW, or 30 MW per county (Chen Lei, 2009). <lb/>Power for All <lb/>The aim of the State Grid Corporation&apos;s &quot; Power for All &quot; programme is to reach 4.5 million people <lb/>(1.2 million households of the 1.5 million without electricity) in 26 provinces, autonomous regions and <lb/>municipalities by 2010. As can be seen in Table 10, at the end of 2007, out of a total of <lb/>498 235 administrative villages within the State Grid Corporation of China, only 1 694 administrative <lb/>villages were still without electricity, an electrification rate of 99.66%. Moreover, out of a total of <lb/>192 308 000 rural households within the State Grid Corporation&apos;s area, 250 000 households were <lb/>without electricity, an electrification rate of 99.87% of households. According to the State Grid <lb/>Corporation, almost every province has realised electrification through grid extensions except for the <lb/>sparsely populated north-western provinces of Tibet, Xinjiang and Qinghai (State Grid Corporation, <lb/>2008). <lb/></body>

Subsidies are conditional on the requirement of 20 years service life of the <lb/>installation. <lb/>Comparative Study on Rural Electrification Policies in Emerging Economies – © OECD/IEA 2010 <lb/>Page | 49 <lb/>2.3.3 Total achievements: all programmes taken together <lb/>Table 12 illustrates the distribution of the remaining un-electrified households/populations for each <lb/>province in early 2006. <lb/>Comparing Table 13 with Table 12, between December 2001 and early 2006, the number of non-<lb/>electrified households was reduced from over 7 million to close to 2.7 million by means of grid <lb/>extension, decentralised renewable energy systems, resettlements, etc. This means that more than <lb/>4 million households gained access to electricity in almost 6 years. <lb/>Table 12: Status of un-electrified households and population (early 2006) <lb/>No. Province <lb/>Households <lb/>Population <lb/>Province <lb/>Households <lb/>Population <lb/>1 <lb/>Yunnan <lb/>503 003 <lb/>2189361 <lb/>18 <lb/>Shanxi <lb/>12744 <lb/>50976 <lb/>2 <lb/>Sichuan <lb/>476 707 <lb/>1939150 <lb/>19 <lb/>Ningxia <lb/>12664 <lb/>49650 <lb/>3 <lb/>Tibet <lb/>212 431 <lb/>1 200 668 <lb/>20_1 <lb/>Liaoning <lb/>10 854 <lb/>33 403 <lb/>4 <lb/>Inner Mongolia <lb/>186 658 <lb/>746 632 <lb/>20_2 <lb/>Dalian City <lb/>9 821 <lb/>44 670 <lb/>5 <lb/>Guangxi <lb/>163 302 <lb/>727 892 <lb/>21 <lb/>Fujian <lb/>4 797 <lb/>20 901 <lb/>6 <lb/>Chongqing <lb/>153 699 <lb/>552 297 <lb/>22 <lb/>Hebei <lb/>2 800 <lb/>11 909 <lb/>7 <lb/>Gansu <lb/>123 936 <lb/>523 394 <lb/>23 <lb/>Hunan <lb/>31 074 <lb/>124 595 <lb/>8 <lb/>Henan <lb/>134 472 <lb/>505 372 <lb/>24 <lb/>Hainan <lb/>8 700 <lb/>35 000 <lb/>9 <lb/>Qinghai <lb/>89 488 <lb/>495 372 <lb/>25 <lb/>Jiangsu <lb/>10 <lb/>Shaanxi <lb/>126 838 <lb/>477 831 <lb/>26 <lb/>Anhui <lb/>11 <lb/>Guizhou <lb/>111 830 <lb/>466 350 <lb/>27 <lb/>Beijing <lb/>12 <lb/>Xinjiang <lb/>95 300 <lb/>415 700 <lb/>28 <lb/>Shanghai <lb/>13 <lb/>Hubei <lb/>72 947 <lb/>243 482 <lb/>29 <lb/>Tianjin <lb/>14 <lb/>Guangdong <lb/>47 938 <lb/>238 417 <lb/>30 <lb/>Jilin <lb/>15 <lb/>Jiangxi <lb/>45 854 <lb/>191 434 <lb/>31 <lb/>Zhejiang <lb/>17 <lb/>Xinjiang Military <lb/>23 234 <lb/>78 106 <lb/>33 <lb/>Total <lb/>2 695 681 <lb/>11 467 438 <lb/>Source: Center for Renewable Energy Development, JKD, Beijing (2006). <lb/></body>

From the point of view of end-users living in rural areas, electricity generated from <lb/>decentralised renewable energy systems was perceived as &quot; inferior &quot; and &quot; not always available &quot; and <lb/>therefore not the most favoured option. But recently, renewable energy technologies, both grid-<lb/>connected and stand-alone, were perceived as viable options for electricity production. This change <lb/>in perception is true for both the Chinese government and the Chinese population. <lb/>Today, the increasing difficulties to bring electricity to the remaining villages in the far west of the <lb/>country by grid extension, has led to questioning whether &quot; full grid coverage &quot; is economically <lb/>justified compared to using cheaper decentralised off-grid options. Because the last 11.5 million un-<lb/>electrified people are difficult to reach through grid extension, the government now aims to supply <lb/>electricity to 10 million people by the end of 2020 through the deployment of decentralised power <lb/>systems (China&apos;s Mid and Long-Term Renewable Energy Development Plan until 2020 released by <lb/>NDRC in March 2008). Providing electricity to populations in remote, off-grid areas is a clear <lb/>objective of the ongoing 11 th Five-year Renewable Energy Plan, primarily featuring the deployment <lb/>of clean and renewable energy in the following order of priority: small hydro, PV village systems, <lb/>PV/wind hybrid systems, small wind turbines, and solar home systems. In areas with strong <lb/>hydropower potential, small hydro projects will be developed as a priority, because of the lower <lb/>cost per kWh generated. In areas with no water resources, small solar PV stations, PV/wind hybrid <lb/>stations, small wind turbines, solar home systems will be installed to provide electricity to over <lb/>1 million households by the end of 2010. Target areas are Tibet, Qinghai, Inner Mongolia, Xinjiang, <lb/>Yunnan, Gansu, and others. Today, one-third of the total rural electricity consumption is supplied by <lb/>local small hydropower (Chen Lei, 2009). <lb/>Preference for locally made stand-alone technologies <lb/>In the late 1990s some equipment like small wind turbines, PV, SHS, had to be imported, because in <lb/>most cases these projects were part of bi-and/or multi-lateral technical co-operation. However, in <lb/>the course of the Brightness Programme, and notably the Township Electrification Programme from <lb/>April to July 2002, five nationwide public tenders were conducted to select system integrators 32 to <lb/>design, procure and install systems. Almost all equipment was domestically manufactured. Even in <lb/>projects financially supported by the German Bank for Reconstruction (Kreditanstalt für <lb/>Wiederaufbau, KfW), the equipment was locally produced except for the PV modules and inverters. <lb/>2.3.5 Description of expected end-use of electrification <lb/>In the framework of rural electrification through decentralised renewable energy systems, the <lb/>Chinese government considers supplying electricity only for lighting, TV and radio as means to <lb/>support both basic social and economic development goals. Productive use of electricity by <lb/>households, as in the case of the Township Electrification Programme, is prohibited because it is <lb/>rightly expected that electricity demand would soon exceed the capacity of the installed battery <lb/>system. Frequent replacements of battery banks would consequently cause higher costs for <lb/>operation and maintenance. In isolated cases, end-users have however purchased small processing <lb/></body>

			<body>equipment such as flour-grinding machines, oil seed pressing equipment, or even welding machines <lb/>to generate additional income. <lb/>The distribution of end-use appliances has considerably changed over time. Table 14 illustrates the <lb/>starkly different distribution of common household appliances between rural and urban households <lb/>and also reflects China&apos;s enormous economic development in the course of the last decades (Pan et <lb/>al., 2006). <lb/>Table 14: Electric appliances in rural and urban households (per 100 households) <lb/>1980 <lb/>1990 <lb/>2000 <lb/>2004 <lb/>Items <lb/>Rural <lb/>Urban <lb/>Rural <lb/>Urban <lb/>Rural <lb/>Urban <lb/>Rural <lb/>Urban <lb/>Washing machine <lb/>1.9 <lb/>48.3 <lb/>9.1 <lb/>78.4 <lb/>28.6 <lb/>90.5 <lb/>37.3 <lb/>95.9 <lb/>Refrigerator <lb/>0.1 <lb/>6.6 <lb/>1.2 <lb/>42.3 <lb/>12.3 <lb/>80.1 <lb/>17.8 <lb/>90.2 <lb/>Air conditioner <lb/>0 <lb/>0 <lb/>0 <lb/>1.1 <lb/>1.3 <lb/>30.8 <lb/>4.7 <lb/>69.8 <lb/>Source: Pan et al. (2006). <lb/>Recent statistics from the National Energy Administration suggest that in 2008, 99.2% of rural <lb/>households have colour television sets, 49.1% have washing machines, 30.2% have refrigerators and <lb/>9.8% have air-conditioners. This is a huge advance in rural households&apos; quality of life (Tang, 2009). <lb/>The government sees electrification in poverty-stricken rural areas through small hydropower as a <lb/>means to improve production, promote economic and social development, and increase the income <lb/>of rural dwellers through employment opportunities provided by growing industries (Chen Lei, <lb/>2009). Electricity generated through hydropower systems is therefore expected to raise rural <lb/>incomes and facilitate the social and economic development in rural areas. <lb/>2.4 Costs, incentives and tariffs <lb/>2.4.1 Costs <lb/>Rural grids <lb/>Since 1998, China has invested more than CNY 400 bn (USD 58.68 bn) in construction of power <lb/>plants in rural areas (Tang, 2009) of which USD 49.5 billion over the past seven years. 33 By the end <lb/>of 2005, the State Grid Corporation had invested over USD 27.89 billion in two phases of rural <lb/>power grid renovation (State Grid Corporation of China, 2009); USD 5.98 billion was invested in the <lb/>renovation of county power grids and USD 50.81 million in the renovation of the western power <lb/>grid; 20 % of these investments came from Treasury Bonds as capital, the remaining 80% from bank <lb/>loans. After the renovation of the rural grids, the depreciation cost and financial cost of the State <lb/>Grid Corporation have increased substantially. According to the &quot;Rural Grid Programme for the <lb/>Eleventh Five-Year Period by the State Grid Corporation&quot;, during the period covered by the plan, the <lb/>estimated investment in rural grids by the Corporation will be USD 16.57 billion, of which <lb/>USD 3.31 billion of capital, and USD 13.26 billion of bank loans. The average annual investment will <lb/>be USD 3.26 billion, of which USD 0.65 billion of capital, and USD 2.61 billion of bank loans. 34 <lb/></body>

			<body>Page | 53 <lb/>Brightness Programme/Township Programme <lb/>The national &quot; Township Programme &quot; , authorised by the State Council in 2001, was initiated in mid-<lb/>2002 with the goal to supply electricity to the remaining 1 065 administrative townships 35 in rural <lb/>western China. The programme has cost CNY 4.97 bn (USD 730 million) of which CNY 2 bn <lb/>(USD 293 million) came from the central government and the rest from provincial and township <lb/>governments. Through a competitive bidding procedure at the provincial level, the so-called system <lb/>integrators responsible for the installation, operation and maintenance for three years were <lb/>selected. Most systems were installed during the mid-2002 to 2004 period. In total, 989 power <lb/>stations were constructed of which 721 are PV and PV/wind hybrid systems with a total capacity of <lb/>15.53 MW and 146 small hydropower stations with a total capacity of 113 MW. <lb/>The subsidy needed to facilitate the operation of decentralised renewable energy systems, mainly <lb/>photovoltaic, amounted to a total of approximately CNY 20 million (USD 2.93 million), the average <lb/>subsidy being about CNY 2 900/kW of installed capacity in one year. <lb/>2.4.2 Framework conditions and business incentives <lb/>Historically, rural electrification through grid extension or decentralised renewable energy <lb/>applications in order to achieve nationwide electrification is the mandate of the government. This <lb/>mandate is reflected in previous and future Five-Year National Development Plans that outline <lb/>relevant rural electrification undertakings with their corresponding budget. <lb/>In late 2002, worldwide experience with PV and PV/wind hybrid systems in villages − seen from <lb/>institutional, social, economical, environmental and technical angles − was extremely limited. This <lb/>explains why the private sector did not engage in the implementation of the Township Electrification <lb/>Programme. The main actors remained government-affiliated institutions or semi-private entities such <lb/>as spin-off companies from former government institutions previously involved in rural electrification <lb/>projects and that had already gained experience. In this context, because certain criteria had to be <lb/>fulfilled to be selected as participant in the competitive bidding procedure, companies with a track <lb/>record were in an advantageous position compared to &quot; potential newcomers in the business &quot; . <lb/>Moreover, when selecting the so-called &quot; system integrators &quot; , these were considered responsible for the <lb/>construction, maintenance and operation of these decentralised village power systems for three years, <lb/>and contracts stipulating tasks, responsibilities and modes of payment were signed. Since all constructed <lb/>systems were off-grid, no public-private partnerships had to be arranged. As of today, although the <lb/>contracts came to an end, some system integrators still operate, maintain and organise the supply of <lb/>spare parts, and train local technicians for these off-grid systems. <lb/>2.5 Country-specific challenges and how they were addressed <lb/>China is currently facing challenges in its objective of 100% rural electrification. <lb/>Theft and vandalism <lb/>China has no official statistics regarding electricity losses due to theft or vandalism whether for rural <lb/>grids or stand-alone systems. However, theft and vandalism do occur and are perceived as <lb/>problems which require an urgent solution. In the absence of effective supervising mechanisms, <lb/></body>

			<note place="footnote">35 From an administrative point of view, once these remaining townships are electrified, China will have <lb/>attained 100% electrification of townships (excluding administrative villages, villages and natural villages <lb/>where the other 11 million people are living). <lb/></note>

			<body>damage and theft of equipment have become a serious concern in that they affect the operation of <lb/>power plants. There is a widely shared view that measures need to be taken during the system <lb/>construction itself. In the case of the Township Electrification Programme, in late 2006 stolen PV <lb/>modules were reported to the responsible Provincial Department of Reform and Development <lb/>Commission with a view to obtain funding for replacements. In some cases, PV modules have been <lb/>welded to the basic structure so as to create additional hindrances for potential thieves. By <lb/>comparison, privately owned local systems are under better control, especially solar home systems, <lb/>small-scale wind turbines and pico-hydropower stations, and are therefore less subject to theft and <lb/>vandalism. <lb/>Prohibitive operational costs <lb/>For decades, China&apos;s focus has been on securing power supply for urban and industrial use. As a <lb/>consequence, the gap in service supply between urban and rural areas has been growing. Rural <lb/>areas remained relatively under-developed, and growth in electricity use was slow, seasonal and <lb/>fluctuating over the day. Long transmission lines, coupled with low load density, have resulted in <lb/>high costs for rural power supply and little or no business revenues. Moreover, because of past <lb/>management practices of some county power suppliers, these were heavily indebted and the <lb/>majority of their workers were unskilled. These prohibitive operational costs have discouraged <lb/>potential investors. Centralised structures, rooted in history and politics, were preferred, resulting <lb/>in grid extensions to areas with high construction costs, transmission losses and maintenance <lb/>expenses, instead of opting for decentralised solutions. <lb/>However, with its goal to electrify an extra 10 million people by 2020 through the use of locally <lb/>available renewable energy resources, and the sharp fall of application costs for renewable energy <lb/>systems during the last decade, China is striving to become the world market leader for PV and <lb/>wind energy technology. The lower costs incurred by growing domestic demand will be a strong <lb/>economic incentive for greater industry involvement. <lb/>Low quality of rural electricians <lb/>Before the reconstruction of rural grids, the low level of electrification in rural areas required work <lb/>from only ordinary unskilled electricians. These were usually farmers whose main income came <lb/>from agriculture, but who worked part-time for electricity companies, even collecting the bills as <lb/>part of their tasks. However, with electrification spreading to rural areas, the technological <lb/>complexity of electricians&apos; work increased. The need for constantly improving electricity services <lb/>has expanded the rural electricity market. Rural electricians are now required to work full-time <lb/>while upgrading their skills. With relatively low wages and an often insecure revenue flow, no <lb/>medical insurance and no pensions, skilled electricians are difficult to find and very few residents in <lb/>economically developed villages want to become electricians. There is no suitable training available, <lb/>and most of the new local technicians/operators have not received any technical training and <lb/>therefore are unable to perform operation and maintenance (O&amp;M) tasks. The government is <lb/>therefore in the process of identifying mechanisms and institutions, preferably at provincial level, to <lb/>ensure that potential candidates benefit from a standardised training in operation and maintenance <lb/>tasks. <lb/>Operation and maintenance reliability for off-grid <lb/>Commercialisation by private-sector companies bears the risk that after-sale support is neglected <lb/>owing to low profitability. Moreover, with the rapid implementation of the programme, insufficient <lb/>consideration was given to user training, and only a minimum budget allocation for training <lb/>purposes was earmarked in the original budget. The most common perception in the past was that <lb/> &quot; electricity is a hands-on business &quot; where no special qualification was required. Today, with <lb/>increasing technical complexity, it is essential to train members of the villages/townships. However, <lb/></body>

			<body>here again, the lower level of education among the rural population makes it difficult to recruit <lb/>people with a basic knowledge of mechanical or electrical engineering, who would be ready to <lb/>follow the training courses provided by system integrators, project owners or the like. In general, <lb/>once off-grid applications have been installed, at least two inhabitants of these villages/townships <lb/>will be appointed by the village/township government to serve as rural technicians and to perform <lb/>basic operation and maintenance tasks such as cleaning PV modules, checking batteries, collecting <lb/>electricity fees, replacing fuses, fixing disconnected wires, and so on. <lb/>2.6 Rural electrification progress assessment and conclusion <lb/>China has made major efforts to restructure its energy system and provide electricity to its remote <lb/>areas. It has succeeded in tackling the problems of electrification by using different renewable <lb/>energy power systems, and abandoning grid extension efforts when these were not economical or <lb/>practical. During the electrification process, China has faced numerous challenges some of which <lb/>remain to be addressed. However, rural electrification in China is no doubt a success story that has <lb/>led to near-complete electrification of the most populated country of the world in a relatively short <lb/>period. Since this process started several decades ago, a distinction should be made between the <lb/>older and recent processes. <lb/>Keys to historical rural electrification success <lb/>Pragmatism overcame ideology, in the sense that although the central government had absolute <lb/>power and clear plans on how to electrify the country, it yielded administrative responsibility to <lb/>local levels in support of a different approach, more efficient and appropriate to the situation. The <lb/>price that had to be paid for the rapid initial electrification included inconsistent tariff structures, <lb/>administrative responsibility overlaps, low technical quality of installations and often small electrical <lb/>capacities that were suitable only for a limited range of applications. <lb/>Keys to recent rural electrification success <lb/>The recent and ongoing rural electrification activities are characterised by technically advanced <lb/>programmes to supply electricity to areas with difficult conditions. <lb/>Government commitment: Whether through grid extension or decentralised off-grid applications, <lb/>universal supply of electricity has been one of the government&apos;s objectives. As a socialist country, <lb/>China aims to give all its citizens the same basic living conditions, including access to electricity. As <lb/>with other rural electrification programmes, the government&apos;s commitment (through efficient <lb/>planning and sufficient long-term funding) has proven most fundamental to the electrification <lb/>success. <lb/>Technological flexibility: The &quot; last remaining un-electrified areas &quot; means areas that are &quot; hardest to <lb/>electrify &quot; , with the highest costs if inappropriate means are chosen. This situation was avoided by <lb/>choosing a wide array of technologies to prove their respective competitive advantages. The <lb/>Township Programme was among the first to use technologies such as PV hybrid systems on a large <lb/>scale. Moreover, the use of small hydropower plants in water-rich areas, as in the &quot; County <lb/>Hydropower Construction of National Rural Electrification &quot; , has brought resource-specific answers <lb/>to electrification concerns. <lb/>Sense of ownership: Areas with low population density require individual household systems where <lb/>operation, maintenance and ownership are in the same hands. In China, operation and <lb/>maintenance worked best if a strong sense of ownership was present as far as individual <lb/></body>

			<body>applications like pico hydropower, solar home systems and small-scale wind generators were <lb/>concerned. <lb/>Private-sector implementation entities: The competitive bidding procedure of the Township <lb/>Programme sought to minimise implementation costs. However, not all participants to the bidding <lb/>process were equally capable of performing the tasks, since formerly government-owned <lb/>companies had a competitive advantage in that they had acquired experience in rural <lb/>electrification. <lb/>Remaining challenges linked to grid extension <lb/>Complex administrative structures: Even though rural electricity supply now lies in the hands of <lb/>large power companies after a reform to unify the electricity system, strong county-and township-<lb/>level government influence on the management of small hydropower still prevails. There is an <lb/>overlap of responsibilities between the central, provincial and county government players in the <lb/>management of rural electrification and it is not always clear who is ultimately responsible for the <lb/>operation and management of rural electrification structures. This problem still needs to be <lb/>addressed to improve the fluidity and long-term viability of the electrification process. <lb/>Low level of rural power consumption: According to 2009 IEA calculations, China&apos;s total per-capita <lb/>electricity consumption had reached 2 328 kWh in 2007, a 14% increase since 2006. There remains <lb/>a strong urban-rural divide in electricity consumption. This shows that additional and significant <lb/>electrification efforts are needed and that economic development has not yet fully propelled rural <lb/>households to the levels of urban households. <lb/>Pricing: The Chinese pricing policy remains unclear. There is no market pricing mechanism for <lb/>electricity since prices are still set by the government. Power suppliers are therefore not assured <lb/>the necessary profits. This particularly affects the long-term investment security for investors in <lb/>county-level power systems. Rural power grids are unattractive to investors owing to these market <lb/>uncertainties. The example of the Yunnan Province demonstrated that rural end-users limited their <lb/>monthly electricity consumption to a level that makes it completely unattractive to the electricity <lb/>company to invest further in infrastructure and maintenance. <lb/>Lack of competition in the county: Supply companies targeting rural areas have always enjoyed a <lb/>monopolistic position. According to the Chinese &quot; one county one supplier &quot; policy, the supplier is to <lb/>provide the full range of services at a given price. Market access by other investors is difficult if not <lb/>impossible. This, along with rigid rules on production, supply and marketing of electricity, prevents <lb/>innovation, competition and reform. <lb/>Prohibitive maintenance costs and lack of funding: Rural grids incur major construction and <lb/>maintenance costs. Although there are maintenance fees, they are insufficient to cover the <lb/>expenses of the ever-increasing assets. Two-thirds of the fees collected through rural electricity <lb/>tariffs are used for building electricity generators, and the remaining third is insufficient for <lb/>acquiring maintenance equipment for grid renovation or development (Luo, 2007). These financial <lb/>burdens negatively impact business revenues. In addition, in the course of the energy sector reform <lb/>which began in 1998, some electricity facilities of the rural grids have been corroded, damaged, or <lb/>generally could not meet the demand, and thus needed either replacement or modification, again <lb/>incurring large expenses. The improvement of living standards and the economic development of <lb/>rural areas, a consequence of electrification, stimulate electricity demand, and put power supply <lb/>companies under permanent financial strain. Rural grids need constant renovation and <lb/>maintenance. <lb/></body>

			<body>Page | 57 <lb/>Main remaining challenges linked to the Brightness Programme/Township Programme <lb/>Use of unsuitable material: As a first step towards the ambitious objectives of the Brightness <lb/>Programme, a three-year pilot phase was launched in 1999 in three provinces. A survey conducted <lb/>by the Institute of Electrical Engineering (JKD) in Inner Mongolia in late 2003 (Chinese Academy of <lb/>Science, 2003) revealed that out of 5 240 PV/wind/battery hybrid systems for which statistics were <lb/>available, a total of 2 119 systems (40.4%) were malfunctioning. Problems with the inverters/charge <lb/>controllers accounted for 1 099 sets (20.9%) followed by 657 problems with batteries (12.5%) and <lb/>363 problems with wind turbines (6.9%). On-site investigations suggested that the bearings of wind <lb/>turbines were made out of unsuitable copper material. The main causes of the exceptionally high <lb/>proportion of malfunctioning charge controllers/inverters were poor technical design and the <lb/>utilisation of unsuitable material during assembly. Consequently, the malfunctioning charge <lb/>controller/inverter shortened the lifetime of 657 batteries. As a result, a general dissatisfaction <lb/>among end-users prevailed and led in many cases to the refusal to pay the final instalment for the <lb/>systems. Table 16 provides an overview of future costs to 2020. 36 <lb/>Unclear long-term operation and maintenance: When the Township Electrification Programme was <lb/>designed, government financial support was almost entirely earmarked for the procurement of <lb/>hardware. Through a competitive bidding system, system integrators were selected and according <lb/>to what the bidding documents stipulated, their responsibility merely included the design, <lb/>construction, operation and maintenance of the off-grid systems. However, this lasted only three <lb/>years. Today, more than six years after the Township Electrification Programme was initiated, a <lb/>number of pressing issues are still pending here and there, e.g. ownership (transfer from national to <lb/>provincial/township government), management (financial and contractual requirements for <lb/>Renewable Energy Service Companies, RESCOs), financial support (governmental subsidies to cover <lb/>expenses incurred for operation and maintenance (O&amp;M) during the 20 years of the system&apos;s life), <lb/>tariff setting (official guidelines to set a tariff to be paid by end-users and how the difference in <lb/>tariffs can be balanced through the provisions made in the Chinese Renewable Energy Law). <lb/>Moreover, ownership in most of the provinces has not been defined, so that many entities are <lb/>unwilling to take responsibility for operation and maintenance, causing problems in daily <lb/>management, bill collection, equipment replacements and repairs, etc. Different tariffs (there is no <lb/>single tariff for all townships), lead to insufficient revenues earmarked for O&amp;M. The collection of <lb/>one end-user tariff is not sufficient to cover all the costs incurred for O&amp;M, replacement of <lb/>components, repairs and the monthly salary of local technicians/operators. Thus, continued <lb/>financial support from the government is indispensable. <lb/>Long-term technical reliability: Many technologies used in the electrification programme have <lb/>never been applied on a large scale and some were even specifically developed for this programme. <lb/>This poses the question of long-term reliability of the technologies applied. <lb/>36 In the course of the survey involving 11 out of 13 system integrators, budget estimates were compiled <lb/>covering the potential lifetime of village power PV systems over the 2006-2020 period. In total, four cost <lb/>categories have been identified. <lb/>-Operation &amp; maintenance of PV systems (primarily maintenance and monthly salary of on-site local <lb/>operator); <lb/>-Cost to cover the technical support rendered by Renewable Energy Service Companies&apos; routine <lb/>inspection, labour, problem-solving, communication, management, reasonable profit; <lb/>-Cost to cover the replacement of equipment (twice battery replacement, major repair, other <lb/>electronic devices such as inverter, controller, mini-grid); <lb/>-Other cost (training and unforeseen expenses). <lb/></body>

			<body>Unclear financial mechanisms: Besides unclear mechanisms regarding the awarding and control of <lb/>subsidies, there is no model to calculate the real cost of subsidies in support of energy generated <lb/>from renewable sources. Growing energy demand at the local level is straining the entire system, <lb/>notably batteries which often require fast replacement. But who is to pay? The most pressing <lb/>matter is to find sufficient funding to ensure a long-term sustainable operation until 2020. In the <lb/>meantime, to support the long-term financial viability of rural electrification efforts, the central <lb/>government is nevertheless allocating subsidies earmarked for a number of previously implemented <lb/>off-grid electrification programmes, as Table 15 shows. <lb/>Table 15: Overview of subsidy allocations for off-grid systems (October 2007 to June 2008) <lb/>Province <lb/>Project <lb/>Installed <lb/>capacity (kW) <lb/>Subsidy (CNY) <lb/>Gansu <lb/>Township Electrification Programme <lb/>971 <lb/>2 913 000 <lb/>China-Japan Dunhuang Danya Project <lb/>200 <lb/>600 000 <lb/>China-Germany Financial Cooperation Programme <lb/>123 <lb/>371 100 <lb/>Qinghai <lb/>Township Electrification Programme <lb/>3943 <lb/>11 829 000 <lb/>Sanjiangyuan (Region of Three Rivers) Project <lb/>519.3 <lb/>1 558 125 <lb/>China-Germany Financial Cooperation Programme <lb/>366.4 <lb/>1 099 200 <lb/>Xinjiang <lb/>Wind Energy Co., China-Germany Wind Project Phase 1+2 <lb/>100.5 <lb/>301 500 <lb/>289.6 <lb/>858 800 <lb/>Yunnan <lb/>China-Germany Financial Cooperation Programme <lb/>100.5 <lb/>301 500 <lb/>China-Germany Technical Cooperation PV Power Programme <lb/>298.5 <lb/>529 199 <lb/>Total <lb/>6911.8 <lb/>20 361 424 <lb/>Source: EU-China (2009). <lb/>In conclusion, rural electrification efforts have slowed down during the last ten years as nationwide <lb/>electrification is nearly complete. China has achieved an electrification rate of 99.4%, with 99% in <lb/>rural areas and already 100% in urban settings, thanks to the government&apos;s aggressive measures <lb/>and strong political will. At present, the emphasis is shifting to modernisation, service and quality <lb/>improvements, poverty alleviation and the introduction of new energy technologies (Yao &amp; Barnes, <lb/>2007) and innovative solutions for the remote areas in the vast western regions of China that <lb/>remain without electricity. The Chinese government estimates that only 1.5 million people will still <lb/>be without in 2020. <lb/>Comparative Study on Rural Electrification Policies in Emerging Economies – © OECD/IEA 2010 <lb/>Table 16: Operation and maintenance costs (2006 – 2020) <lb/>Province <lb/>System <lb/>integrator <lb/>No. of <lb/>village <lb/>power PV <lb/>systems <lb/>Total power <lb/>capacity (kW) <lb/>Investment <lb/>(CNY) <lb/>Renewable Energy <lb/>Service Company <lb/>(RESCO) <lb/>Battery <lb/>replacement <lb/>(CNY) <lb/>Operation &amp; <lb/>maintenance <lb/>(CNY) <lb/>Others <lb/>(CNY) <lb/>Annual <lb/>(CNY) <lb/>Over 15 <lb/>years <lb/>(CNY) <lb/>Tibet <lb/>Beijing Corona <lb/>92 <lb/>1 764.6 <lb/>20 225.8 <lb/>204.4 <lb/>555.13 <lb/>254.7 <lb/>169.8 <lb/>1 <lb/>184.03 <lb/>17 760.45 <lb/>Huaguan Tibet <lb/>49 <lb/>860 <lb/>9 802 <lb/>29.4 <lb/>228.7 <lb/>73.5 <lb/>9.8 <lb/>341.4 <lb/>5 121 <lb/>Yunnan Tianda <lb/>--<lb/>--<lb/>--<lb/>--<lb/>--<lb/>--<lb/>--<lb/>--<lb/>--<lb/>Beijing JIKE <lb/>58 <lb/>1 255 <lb/>14 809 <lb/>68.71 <lb/>286.25 <lb/>177 <lb/>61.3 <lb/>593.26 <lb/>8 898.9 <lb/>Trina Solar <lb/>40 <lb/>715 <lb/>8 437 <lb/>62.95 <lb/>131.07 <lb/>30 <lb/>77.03 <lb/>301.05 <lb/>4 515.75 <lb/>Shanghai 811 <lb/>42 <lb/>1 035 <lb/>12 316.5 <lb/>135.92 <lb/>314.66 <lb/>102.15 <lb/>138.7 <lb/>691.43 <lb/>10 371.45 <lb/>Qinghai <lb/>112 <lb/>2 715 <lb/>27 964.5 <lb/>252.48 <lb/>729.25 <lb/>245.15 <lb/>55.83 <lb/>1 <lb/>282.71 <lb/>19 240.65 <lb/>Inner Mongolia <lb/>42 <lb/>752 <lb/>6 516.9 <lb/>20.06 <lb/>142.2 <lb/>27.43 <lb/>9.8 <lb/>199.49 <lb/>2 992.35 <lb/>Gansu <lb/>20 <lb/>995 <lb/>11 978 <lb/>61.1 <lb/>266 <lb/>68.48 <lb/>63.87 <lb/>459.45 <lb/>6 891.75 <lb/>Xinjiang <lb/>--<lb/>--<lb/>--<lb/>--<lb/>--<lb/>--<lb/>--<lb/>--<lb/>--<lb/>Sichuan (Yingli) <lb/>9 <lb/>242 <lb/>2 178 <lb/>7.62 <lb/>86.15 <lb/>13.18 <lb/>10.71 <lb/>117.66 <lb/>1 764.9 <lb/>Sichuan (SunPower) <lb/>17 <lb/>590.71 <lb/>5 316.4 <lb/>92.1 <lb/>121.33 <lb/>118.87 <lb/>71 <lb/>403.3 <lb/>6 049.5 <lb/>Shaanxi <lb/>9 <lb/>100 <lb/>1 105 <lb/>5.53 <lb/>40.08 <lb/>14.88 <lb/>3.49 <lb/>63.98 <lb/>84 566.4 <lb/>Total <lb/>490 <lb/>10 996.41 <lb/>120 649.1 <lb/>940.27 <lb/>2 900.82 <lb/>1 125.34 <lb/>671.33 <lb/>5 <lb/>637.76 <lb/>84 566.4 <lb/>Share (%) <lb/>100 <lb/>16.68 <lb/>51.45 <lb/>19.96 <lb/>11.91 <lb/>100 <lb/>70.1 <lb/>Source: UNDP China (2008). <lb/>Comparative Study on Rural Electrification Policies in Emerging Economies – © OECD/IEA 2010 <lb/>Page | 61 <lb/>3 India <lb/>With the largest rural population in the world, India is facing a huge electrification challenge. Today, <lb/>64.5% of India is electrified, with an electrification rate of 93.1% in urban settings but only 52.5% in <lb/>rural areas (IEA, 2009b). This has been achieved mainly through grid extension or small-scale <lb/>renewable energy systems. Strong political will and sufficient funds have, since the beginning of the <lb/>11 th Five-Year Plan, accelerated the speed of electrification. But India is currently faced with <lb/>insufficient electricity generating capacity, which is seriously hindering the implementation of <lb/>future rural electrification programmes and undermining their viability. India&apos;s energy sector, <lb/>electrification efforts and the remaining challenges are detailed below. <lb/>3.1 Introduction and country description <lb/>The Republic of India is the seventh-largest country in the world with respect to its geographical <lb/>area, covering 3.29 million square km and including 7 517 km of coastline. Its terrain ranges from an <lb/>elevated tableland in the south, to deserts in the west, the Himalayas Mountains in the north, and <lb/>flat to rolling plains along the Ganges River. <lb/>Political context <lb/>India is a federal State divided into 28 states and 7 union territories. Since 1947, the year of its <lb/>independence, it is the world&apos;s largest democracy. An elected president is the Head of State. <lb/>Executive power resides with the Prime Minister, while legislative power resides with the Upper <lb/>House (Rajya Sabha) and the Lower House (Lok Sabha). The 28 states have their own elected <lb/>governments, and the 7 union territories are governed by an administrator appointed by central <lb/>government (except for the territories of Delhi and Pondicherry). A governor for each state is <lb/>nominated by the president. The Indian Constitution defines the legislative and administrative <lb/>relationships between the central and state governments but some issues such as electricity and <lb/>economic and social planning are the joint responsibility of both central and state governments. <lb/>Depending on the issue addressed, policies and laws are either set at the central or state level but <lb/>central law always prevails if state and central laws are conflicting (IEA, 2007). <lb/>In the power sector, policy setting and implementation is divided between five ministries: the Ministry of <lb/>Power (MoP), the Ministry of Coal, the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas, the Ministry of New and <lb/>Renewable Energies (MNRE) and the Department of Atomic Energy, and government commissions and <lb/>agencies. The Bureau of Energy Efficiency (BEE) is a body under the MoP which co-ordinates energy <lb/>efficiency and energy conservation measures, and the Central Electricity Authority (CEA), under the MoP, <lb/>acts as an advisory body to the central government on matters of national electricity policy, and specifies <lb/>technical standards and norms for grid operation and maintenance among other issues. Under the MoP, <lb/>the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC) regulates central and interstate-level power-related <lb/>activities, while the State Electricity Regulatory Commissions (SERCs) work on state-level licensing, state-<lb/>level electricity tariffs and competitive issues. Among MNRE&apos;s main activities is the expansion of the use of <lb/>renewable energy technologies in remote rural areas. State governments also have considerable <lb/>responsibilities in the power sector as they are responsible for the implementation of national laws. They <lb/>can set their own laws and regulations to be applied on their territory. Because of this setting, the <lb/>implementation of power sector reforms differs in each state (IEA, 2007). <lb/></body>

			<body>Economic data <lb/>India&apos;s gross domestic product (GDP) in purchasing power parity (in billion USD 2000) attained <lb/>USD 4 024 billion in 2009 (IEA, 2009e). In 2007, services accounted for 52.8% of total GDP, industry <lb/>for 29.4% and agriculture for 17.8% (World Bank, 2008). The large share of services in total GDP is <lb/>remarkably high compared to most other developing economies. Average annual growth of GDP <lb/>has also been high, averaging at 6.9% over the 1997-2007 period, reaching 9.7% in 2006 and 9% in <lb/>2007. Over 2007-2011 the economy is expected to grow at an average of 8.5% (World Bank, 2008). <lb/>However, according to the World Bank, the 2008-2009 global financial crisis has caused India&apos;s <lb/>economic growth to weaken over that period compared to the previous three years. India&apos;s Ministry <lb/>of Finance expects the economy to grow by only 6.1% over 2008-2009 (Ministry of Finance, 2009). <lb/>Population and its economic profile <lb/>India is the second most populous country after China and the first most populous democracy with <lb/>a total population reaching an estimated 1 139 965 million in 2008, which is about 17% of the <lb/>world&apos;s population (World Bank, 2009d). According to the Central Intelligence Agency&apos;s World <lb/>Factbook for India, in 2003, 60% of the labour force worked in agriculture, 12% in industry and 28% <lb/>in services; the total unemployment rate across sectors in 2008 was 6.8% (CIA, 2009). India has the <lb/>largest rural population in the world with 828 million rural inhabitants. In 2008, 70.8% of India&apos;s <lb/>total population lived in rural areas, progressively migrating to urban areas at an annual rate of <lb/>2.3%, a rate which is below that of many other countries (UNPD, 2008). <lb/>Figure 7: GDP per capita per state <lb/>The boundaries and names shown and the designations used on maps included in this publication do not <lb/>imply official endorsement or acceptance by the IEA. <lb/>Source: IEA (2007). <lb/>According to recent World Bank estimations, the GDP per capita grew by 7.7% in 2007, and is <lb/>expected to grow by 7.2 % over 2007-2011 (World Bank, 2008). Over 1997-2007, GDP per capita <lb/></body>

			<body>grew by 5.3%. While such economic development has led to an average increase in the standards of <lb/>living, it has left the agricultural sector untouched, bypassing most of the rural poor. Therefore, <lb/>although India has enjoyed a growth of GDP per capita, poverty remains a challenge. Poverty is also <lb/>more concentrated in some states such as the eastern and north-eastern states as Figure 7 shows. <lb/>India has over 300 million poor people living below the &quot; poverty line &quot; as defined by the Planning <lb/>Commission. In March 2007, the Indian Planning Commission estimated that over the 2004-2005 <lb/>period, more than one-quarter of India&apos;s total population (27.5%) still lived below the poverty line <lb/>(BPL), with a distribution of 25.7% urban dwellers and 28.3% rural dwellers (Planning Commission, <lb/>Government of India, 2007) 37 as seen in Table 17. <lb/>Table 17: Number and percentage of people below the poverty line in India (1983-2004) <lb/>Years <lb/>Rural <lb/>Urban <lb/>Combined <lb/>in million <lb/>in percent <lb/>in million <lb/>in percent <lb/>in million <lb/>in percent <lb/>1983 <lb/>252 <lb/>45.7 <lb/>70 <lb/>40.8 <lb/>322 <lb/>44.5 <lb/>1993 <lb/>244 <lb/>37.3 <lb/>76 <lb/>32.3 <lb/>320 <lb/>36 <lb/>2004 <lb/>220 <lb/>28.3 <lb/>80 <lb/>25.7 <lb/>301 <lb/>27.5 <lb/>Source: Planning Commission -Government of India (2008). <lb/>The government of India is hoping that rapid economic growth, coupled with access by all to the <lb/>basic amenities − electricity access, health, education and clean water − will be the keys to levelling <lb/>the income disparity among the rural and urban populations (Planning Commission, 2006). But <lb/>strong economic growth alone does not bring such amenities to the rural poor. For this reason, the <lb/>Planning Commission has been working to establish solid infrastructures such as electricity <lb/>connections, telephone connections, roads, railways and irrigation so as to improve the productivity <lb/>of agricultural and rural industries (Planning Commission, 2006). <lb/>Rural – urban divide: unequal access to electricity <lb/>In 2005, a total of 412 million people in India had no access to electricity, with 380 million of them <lb/>(92% of total population) living in rural areas and 32 million in urban areas (IEA, 2007). According to <lb/>recent IEA estimates, India is today 64.5% electrified, with an urban electrification rate reaching <lb/>93.1% and a rural rate of only 52.5% (IEA, 2009b). <lb/>37 The definition of the poverty line is a major cause for international and internal debate. In India, its <lb/>definition has changed considerably over the years. Since 2006, the criterion used by the Planning <lb/>Commission is the monthly per capita consumption expenditure and is based on a caloric norm. Its definition <lb/>is used to identify individuals who are in need of government assistance and aid. The Planning Commission <lb/>considers that an individual is living below the poverty line if his or her monthly consumption expenditure is <lb/>below Indian rupees (INR) 356.35 in rural areas (around USD 7 or enough to purchase 2 400 calories of <lb/>nutrition) or below INR 538.60 in urban areas (around USD 10.5 or enough to purchase 2 100 calories of <lb/>nutrition). Under this criterion, 27.5% of the Indian population live below the poverty line. Because of major <lb/>debate over this definition, government committees have been asked to rethink the definition of the poverty <lb/>line. In 2007, the Arjun Sengupta Committee estimated that a total of 77% of the Indian population lived with <lb/>less than INR 20 (USD 0.4) a day, with 27.5% living under the poverty line, and some 50% living just slightly <lb/>above it. In June 2009, a committee chaired by the Supreme Court food commissioner N C Saxena, and <lb/>appointed by the Rural Development Ministry suggested a revision of the parameters defining a new poverty <lb/>line, under which 50% of the Indian population would live. Such numbers differ from International <lb/>estimations such as those of the Asian Development Bank estimating that 41.6% of the population live below <lb/>the poverty line of USD 1.25 (PPP) per day (Asian Development Bank, 2009). <lb/></body>

			<body>Page | 64 <lb/>Installed capacity <lb/>According to the Central Electricity Authority (CEA) of the Ministry of Power (MoP), on 31 July 2009, India&apos;s <lb/>total installed capacity had reached 151 073 megawatts (MW). Thermal power accounted for 60% of total <lb/>installed capacity with 96 794 MW, hydropower for 24.5% with 36 916 MW, nuclear power for 2.7% with <lb/>4 120 MW and renewable energies for 8.8 % with 13 242 MW (Central Electricity Authority, 2009a). <lb/>According to the Ministry of Power, at present 86.5% of India&apos;s total installed capacity is publicly <lb/>owned, either by the states or by the central government. A smaller share of generating capacity is <lb/>covered by independent power producers (IPP) and industrial auto-producers, which according to <lb/>the MoP operate 13.5 % 38 of all India&apos;s capacity (Table 18). State Electricity Boards own around 50% <lb/>of total installed capacity. Public companies owned by the central government, including the <lb/>National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC), the National Hydroelectric Power Corporation (NHPC) <lb/>and the Nuclear Power Corporation of India Ltd.

			<body>Electricity generation <lb/>Electricity consumption per capita is among the lowest in the world, equalling 543 KWh/capita (IEA, <lb/>2009e). Although India has considerably improved its generating capacity, it still has difficulty in <lb/>meeting demand and there are persistent power shortages which constrain India&apos;s economic <lb/>growth. With the development of the industrial and commercial sectors as well as the wider use of <lb/>electrical equipment, electricity demand keeps increasing. To meet this increasing demand, India <lb/>will have to make substantial investments in the electricity sector. The country expects to increase <lb/>its capacity by 78 700 MW over the 11th Five-Year Plan (2007-2012). For the long-term horizon, the <lb/>report on the Integrated Energy Policy has projected energy demand to the year 2031/32 <lb/>(Table 20). <lb/>Table 20: Projected electricity demand and supply to 2031/32 <lb/>Year <lb/>Projected <lb/>population <lb/>(in million) <lb/>TPCE (Mtoe) <lb/>Projected demand of electricity <lb/>Total energy <lb/>(TWh) <lb/>Peak demand <lb/>(GW) <lb/>Capacity required(GW) <lb/>2006/07 <lb/>1114 <lb/>389 <lb/>774 <lb/>109 <lb/>155 <lb/>2011/12 <lb/>1197 <lb/>521 <lb/>1167 <lb/>168 <lb/>233 <lb/>2016/17 <lb/>1275 <lb/>684 <lb/>1687 <lb/>250 <lb/>337 <lb/>2021/22 <lb/>1347 <lb/>898 <lb/>2438 <lb/>372 <lb/>488 <lb/>2026/27 <lb/>1411 <lb/>1166 <lb/>3423 <lb/>522 <lb/>685 <lb/>2031/32 <lb/>1468 <lb/>1514 <lb/>4806 <lb/>733 <lb/>960 <lb/>Source: Planning Commission (2005). <lb/>Transmission <lb/>Before 2006, the Indian power system was composed of five regional grids operating <lb/>independently, namely the Northern, Eastern, Western, Southern, and North-Eastern Grids. Each <lb/>one covered several states. Since August 2006, all these regional grids except for the Southern Grid <lb/>have been integrated and now operate together at the same frequency. They are now treated as if <lb/>they were one single grid called the NEWNE grid. The southern grid is planned to be synchronously <lb/>operated with the NEWNE grid towards the beginning of the 12 th Five-Year Plan (Central Electricity <lb/>Authority, 2008). Therefore, India still does not have a real unified grid and the intra-country <lb/>capacity needs to be strongly increased to meet the country&apos;s needs. <lb/>Distribution and electricity losses <lb/>Distribution is the weakest link of India&apos;s power supply chain as it faces substantial technical losses <lb/>(because of overloading of transformers and conductors, for instance) and commercial losses of <lb/>electricity (because of low metering efficiency, poor billing and collection, large-scale theft of <lb/>power) averaging 33.7% of total generation in 2006/07 with variations by state as illustrated in <lb/>Figure 8. These losses are among the highest in the world. They compare to some countries in sub-<lb/>Saharan Africa. They compromise the financial viability of the power sector, and discourage <lb/>investment (IEA, 2007). <lb/></body>

In 1997 a new definition was adopted whereby &quot; A village will be <lb/>deemed to be electrified if electricity is used in the inhabited locality within the revenue boundary <lb/>of the village for any purpose whatsoever &quot; . Under this definition, in March 2004 a total of 74% of <lb/>inhabited villages were considered electrified, whereas only 44% of the 138 million rural households <lb/>(60.2 million) used electricity as a source of lighting. However, according to this definition, if only <lb/>one light bulb was kept lit for a nightly hour in the centre of a village or one irrigation pump was <lb/>powered, the whole village was considered electrified. Realising this inadequacy and the statistical <lb/>bias that came with it, the government of India changed its definition for rural electrification in <lb/>March 2004. A village was considered electrified when the following criteria were satisfied: <lb/> &quot; The basic infrastructure (such as distribution transformer and/or distribution lines) is <lb/>made available in the inhabited locality within the revenue boundary of the village, <lb/>including available power supply on demand at at least one hamlet/Dalit Basti as <lb/>applicable, and any of the public places like schools, Panchayat Office (village council), <lb/>health centres, dispensaries, community centres etc.; and <lb/> The number of households electrified should be at least 10% of the total households in <lb/>the village. &quot; <lb/></body>

			<body>Page | 67 <lb/>As a consequence of this new definition for electrification, many villages that were previously <lb/>considered electrified fell by definition into the un-electrified category. <lb/>3.2.1 The Rajiv Gandhi Grameen Vidyutikaran Yojana (RGGVY) scheme <lb/>Targets of the RGGVY <lb/>In February 2005, a large-scale electrification effort, the Rajiv Gandhi Grameen Vidyutikaran Yojana <lb/>(RGGVY) scheme was launched by the MoP to speed up rural electrification under the &quot; Power for all <lb/>by 2012 &quot; initiative. The RGGVY is a major programme of grid extension and reinforcement of the <lb/>rural electricity infrastructure. &quot; By 2009/10 the RGGVY aims to electrify the 125 000 villages still <lb/>without electricity; to connect all the estimated 23.4 million un-electrified households below the <lb/>poverty line with a 90% subsidy on connecting costs granted by the Ministry of Power; and finally, <lb/>to augment the backbone network in all 462 000 electrified villages. The 54.6 million households <lb/>above the poverty line which are currently un-electrified are expected to obtain electricity <lb/>connection on their own without any subsidy&quot; (Planning Commission, 2005). 39 The RGVVY policy <lb/>therefore aims at: <lb/> &quot; Provision of electricity access to all households (including rural households) by year <lb/>2009 (which includes 23.4 million households living below the poverty line); <lb/> Quality and reliable power supply at reasonable rates; and <lb/> Minimum lifeline consumption of 1 kWh per household per day as a merit good by year <lb/>2012. &quot; (Ministry of Power, 2008) <lb/>However, the electrification programme as envisaged under RGGVY was too slow during the 10th <lb/>plan period. In January 2008, the RGGVY was further extended into the 11th plan period (2007-<lb/>2012) with the following new conditions for its better implementation: <lb/> States are to ensure a minimum of 6 to 8 hours of power supply; <lb/> States are to ensure quality and reliable power supply at reasonable rates; <lb/> The deployment of franchisees is mandatory for the management of rural distribution; <lb/> Introduction of the three-tier Quality Monitoring Mechanism to ensure quality of <lb/>materials and implementation; and <lb/> States are to notify their rural electrification plans to the Rural Electrification <lb/>Corporation (REC) 40 within six months. <lb/>Means of electrification in rural areas under the RGGVY <lb/>Under the RGGVY, projects would be financed for provision of the following systems: <lb/> A Rural Electricity Distribution Backbone (REDB) with 33/11 kV (or 66/11 kV) sub-station <lb/>of adequate capacity in every block where none exists; <lb/> Village Electrification Infrastructure (VEI) with provision of distribution transformer of <lb/>appropriate capacity in villages/habitations; and <lb/> Decentralised Distributed Generation (DDG) systems based on conventional sources <lb/>where grid supply is not feasible or cost-effective. <lb/></body>

			<note place="footnote">39 However, based on a review recently carried out by MoP, by the end of the 11 th FYP (on 31 March 2012), <lb/>the RGGVY should be able to electrify 100 000 villages and provide free connections to 17.5 million <lb/>households below the poverty line. <lb/>40 The REC is the nodal agency for the RGGVY. It is a wholly government-owned enterprise responsible for the <lb/>implementation of its rural electrification schemes. <lb/></note>

			<body>Under the RGGVY scheme, the first approach to village electrification will be through grid extension. Where <lb/>grid connection is either not feasible or not cost-effective, then stand-alone systems are considered which <lb/>can be powered by renewable energy sources or conventional sources, namely through DDG systems. All <lb/>infrastructures must be grid-compatible in order to ensure that when a village is ultimately connected to <lb/>the grid, prior investments are not lost. In DDG projects of the RGGVY, the renewable energy technologies <lb/>currently used are diesel generating sets powered by biofuels (non-edible vegetable oils), diesel generating <lb/>sets powered by producer gas generated through biomass gasification, solar photovoltaic, and small <lb/>hydropower plants. Other technologies, such as diesel generating sets powered by biogas (from animal <lb/>waste), wind hybrid systems or other hybrid systems, including any &quot; new &quot; technology, are currently not yet <lb/>popularly used for DDG in India, but may be used in the future. Moreover, although diesel is the easiest <lb/>form of decentralised power generation, the government of India encourages its use only for stand-by <lb/>options or in the case of temporary disruption of renewable energy supply. The general rule of thumb <lb/>supposes that the technology with the lowest marginal cost and which is considered the most appropriate <lb/>and effective technological option for the area will be chosen. <lb/>Achievements of the RGGVY <lb/>During the 10th plan, 235 projects sanctioned at an investment of INR 97.33 billion 41 (approximately <lb/>USD 2.43 billion) covered the electrification of 65 419 un-electrified villages and provision of free <lb/>electricity connections to 8.31 million BPL households (Ministry of Power, 2009a). At the end of the <lb/>10th plan period (31/03/2007), 38 525 villages were electrified and 672 000 BPL households had <lb/>been provided with electric connections (see Table 22). <lb/>After approving the continuation of RGGVY in the 11th plan, in September 2009, the MoP had sanctioned <lb/>332 projects for the period covering the electrification of 49 736 un-electrified villages, the intensive <lb/>electrification of 242 439 electrified villages and free electricity connections to 16.2 million BPL households <lb/>(see Table 21). During the 11th Five-Year Plan, focus has been on states that had a heavy backlog of un-<lb/>electrified villages and BPL households, as well as on special category states (such as north-eastern states, <lb/>Himachal, J &amp; K and Uttarakhand), border districts and districts led by left wing extremism. <lb/>In September 2009, a total of 567 projects had been sanctioned under the RGGVY, covering the <lb/>electrification of 118 499 villages, the intensive electrification of 354 375 already electrified villages <lb/>and the free electricity connections of 24.6 million BPL households at an estimated cost of <lb/>INR 262.56 billion (approximately USD 5.421 billion) as show in Table 21.

The Remote <lb/>Village Electrification programme (RVE) is responsible for electrifying un-electrified remote census <lb/>villages (with a population of less than 100 inhabitants 42 ) and remote un-electrified hamlets of <lb/>electrified census villages where grid connection is either not feasible or not economical (because <lb/>they are located in forests, hills, deserts or islands) and where DDG projects are not implemented <lb/>by the RGGVY of the MoP. The scope of the RVE is the provision of electricity for: <lb/> &quot; All un-electrified remote census villages by 2007; <lb/>42 The electrification of villages comprising more than 100 inhabitants will usually be undertaken by the <lb/>RGGVY scheme through its DDG (decentralised distribution and generation) projects. To avoid overlap of <lb/>efforts, close co-ordination between the RRGVY and the MNRE is ensured mainly through the Rural <lb/>Electrification Corporation. <lb/></body>

			<body>Page | 70 <lb/> All households of un-electrified remote census villages by 2012; and <lb/> All un-electrified remote hamlets of electrified census villages by 2012. &quot; (Ministry of <lb/>New and Renewable Energies, 2003-2004) <lb/>The RVE programme is implemented in the states by state-notified implementing agencies, which <lb/>receive 90% capital subsidy from the MNRE. A remote village or remote hamlet will be considered <lb/>electrified if at least 10% of the households are provided with lighting facility. Under the RVE <lb/>programme, the electrification process entails choosing the most adequate energy technologies <lb/>through the identification of locally available energy resources. However, in the case where these <lb/>solutions are proven unfeasible, and if the only means for electrification is through use of isolated <lb/>lighting systems (such as solar PV), these should be taken up. However, the remote villages <lb/>receiving them should not be declared electrified. In fact, where the population is scarce and <lb/>remote, there is often no other renewable energy option but the installation of solar photovoltaic <lb/>(SPV) home lighting systems. According to the MNRE, a total of 95%, a large share of remote census <lb/>villages are provided with solar photovoltaic home lighting systems. However, these villages are not <lb/>considered properly electrified until further solutions are implemented (Ministry of New and <lb/>Renewable Energies, 2007). <lb/>Means of electrification <lb/>Under the RVE programme, solar photovoltaic home lighting systems, small hydropower plants, <lb/>biomass gasification systems in conjunction with 100% producer gas engines or with dual-fuel <lb/>engines using non-edible vegetable oils, non-edible vegetable oil-based engines, biogas engines, <lb/>solar photovoltaic power plants are the most commonly used by the MNRE (Ministry of New and <lb/>Renewable Energies, 2007). However, the vast majority, 95%, of remote census villages taken up for <lb/>electrification under the programme are provided with SPV home lighting systems. <lb/>Many villagers in remote areas serviced under the RVE programme that are not recipients of grid-<lb/>distributed power feel discriminated against when they are provided with what they feel is &quot; second-<lb/>class electricity &quot; . Such complaints have been taken up by some political parties which have been <lb/>exerting pressure for grid power to reach their constituents, as opposed to stand-alone systems. As <lb/>a consequence, the list of villages to be electrified under the Remote Village Electrification (RVE) <lb/>scheme is being shortened each year. In any case, such electrification is still considered an interim <lb/>solution as, ultimately, the grid is expected to reach these regions. <lb/>Achievements of the RVE <lb/>The RVE programme of the MNRE covers remote un-electrified villages which are not covered under <lb/>the RGGVY. In March 2009, the cumulative sanctions under the RVE programme had reached <lb/>9 355 villages and hamlets of which 5 410 have been successfully electrified. At the end of the <lb/>11 th Plan, a total of 10 000 villages and hamlets should be covered. By March 2009, 2 600 villages <lb/>and hamlets had been electrified (Ministry of New and Renewable Energies, 2009). <lb/>Table 24: Physical progress of implementation of the RVE at end March 2009 <lb/>Cumulative sanctions since inception of RVE <lb/>Completed <lb/>Villages <lb/>7425 <lb/>4254 (57%) <lb/>Hamlets <lb/>1930 <lb/>1156 (60%) <lb/>Source: Ministry of New and Renewable Energies (2009). <lb/>Comparative Study on Rural Electrification Policies in Emerging Economies – © OECD/IEA 2010 <lb/>Page | 71 <lb/>3.2.3 The Jawaharlal Nehru National Solar Mission (JNNSM) <lb/>The Jawaharlal Nehru National Solar Mission was launched on 23 November 2009 in a statement to <lb/>Parliament by the Union Minister for New and Renewable Energies. This mission is part of the 2008 <lb/>Indian National Action Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC) which seeks to reduce India&apos;s future <lb/>reliance on non-renewable energy sources. Although the JNNSM has not been established to foster <lb/>rural electrification per se, it does mention the use of solar energy as a means for rural <lb/>electrification, thus helping the MNRE with its electrification goals. By the end of the 13th Five-Year <lb/>Plan, in 2022, the JNNSM should have led to an installed capacity of 20 000 MW and the <lb/>deployment of 20 million solar lighting systems in rural areas. <lb/>3.2.4 Description of the expected end-use of the electricity provided <lb/>under RGGVY and RVE <lb/>Before 2004, rural electrification efforts were geared towards the electrification of villages and the <lb/>energisation of irrigation pump sets. The main use of electricity in rural settings was for irrigation <lb/>which allowed for the optimisation of crop yields and consequently grain production self-<lb/>sufficiency. Previously suffering from food deficits, India became a food surplus country thanks to <lb/>rural electrification efforts geared towards the agricultural sector. But this major economic benefit <lb/>was captured mainly by already well-off farmers, leaving aside rural industries and trades which <lb/>were not targeted by the electrification process (Bhattacharyya, 2006). <lb/>Under the RGGVY and the RVE, villages should be provided with electricity not only for domestic <lb/>lighting, but also for productive end-uses, specifically targeting the development of economic <lb/>activities within a given rural area. Electrification is expected to reverse the downward trend in <lb/>agricultural growth which is plaguing rural India. Access to affordable and reliable electricity is <lb/>expected to meet the energy requirements of the agricultural sector by energising irrigation pump <lb/>sets as well as small and medium-sized industries, cold chains, health centres, schools, etc. Rural <lb/>households are expected to play an active role in the region&apos;s economic development, which should <lb/>lead to an increase in the revenue deriving from these activities. The final goal is the development <lb/>of productive activities which will generate funds to cover the costs incurred by power supply, <lb/>operation and maintenance of the systems. <lb/>Some states, such as Punjab and Tamil Nadu, have decided to provide free electricity to farmers to <lb/>support their agriculture. In these states, other categories of customers, such as the domestic and <lb/>industry sectors, have been burdened with heavy tax rates to support the deficits created by the <lb/>provision of free electricity to agricultural consumers. According to the Associated Chamber of <lb/>Commerce of India (Assocham), these losses reach each year around USD 400 000 (22 % of annual <lb/>sales of power) in Punjab and USD 235 000 (6% of annual sales of power) in Tamil Nadu (Assocham, <lb/>2008). As a consequence of this free power provision, utilities in these states have been unable to <lb/>supply reliable electricity to their industrial sector, thus reducing their competitiveness vis à vis <lb/>other states, as noted by the Assocham. In addition, controversies over the allocation of free power <lb/>to farmers have worsened because farmers are using their electric pump sets for other purposes <lb/>than irrigation. <lb/></body>

			<body>Page | 72 <lb/>3.3 Institutional structures for rural electrification <lb/>3.3.1 India&apos;s power sector reforms, and policy reforms to promote <lb/>electricity access <lb/>The government of India has reformed the institutional and regulatory framework of its power <lb/>sector. Reforms have ranged from unbundling of the State Electricity Boards (SEBs), increased <lb/>involvement of the private sector in generation, transmission and distribution, to freer setting of <lb/>electricity tariffs (Asian Development Bank, 2008). These reforms have led to furthering <lb/>electrification efforts in rural areas. The &quot; Power for All by 2012 &quot; initiative was launched by the <lb/>central government in 2001. The objectives of the programme are to ensure &quot; sufficient power to <lb/>achieve a GDP growth rate of 8%, reliable and quality power, optimum power costs, commercial <lb/>viability of the power industry as well as power for all &quot; (Ministry of Power, 2009c). The Electricity <lb/>Act of 2003 followed. It is currently the major piece of legislation covering generation, transmission <lb/>and distribution of electricity in India which compels utilities to supply electricity to all (including in <lb/>rural areas). Moreover, the National Electrification Policy (NEP) of 2005 (which states that the key <lb/>objective of the power sector is to supply electricity to all areas, including rural areas), the Rural <lb/>Electrification Policy of 2006 (provision of electricity to all households by 2009, quality and reliable <lb/>power at reasonable rates and minimum lifeline consumption of 1 kWh per household per day as a <lb/>merit good by 2012) and the National Tariff Policy of 2006, were all policies encouraging <lb/>electrification efforts in rural India. These policies have improved the financial and institutional <lb/>status of the state utilities, and of the state-level generation, transmission and distribution utilities. <lb/>They have widened the state governments&apos; scope of action in rural electrification efforts. As a result <lb/>of the power sector reform process, most state utilities have been unbundled and split into <lb/>separate entities for generation, transmission and distribution of power. <lb/>3.3.2 The central and state governments&apos; responsibilities in rural <lb/>electrification programmes <lb/>The launching of the RGGVY scheme in 2005 marked a turning point in India&apos;s rural electrification <lb/>efforts. In accord with the Electricity Act of 2003, the role of the central government became larger, <lb/>as both central and state governments took over joint responsibility for rural electrification. State <lb/>governments are now required to prepare rural electrification plans designed to assess in detail the <lb/>means by which electricity is to be delivered − i.e. through grid extension or stand-alone systems − <lb/>to the un-electrified households in their constituency. These plans also describe which available <lb/>technologies will be considered, how compliance with environmental norms will be met, as well as <lb/>more general information such as the number of un-electrified households in the target region and <lb/>their distance from the grid. These plans are then co-ordinated between state governments, state <lb/>utilities and other agencies by the Rural Electrification Corporation Limited (REC), a governmental <lb/>body under the Ministry of Power that acts as the nodal agency for the RGGVY. State governments <lb/>are also required to ensure revenue stability of their state utilities if electricity is provided at a tariff <lb/>below what is set by the State Electricity Regulatory Commissions, to supply electricity to rural and <lb/>urban households without interruption, to deploy franchisees and to appoint independent <lb/>franchisees for monitoring the work. At the central level, the MoP develops rural electrification <lb/>policies, monitors the programme&apos;s progress, sanctions projects and releases funds for project <lb/>implementation. <lb/></body>

			<body>3.3.3 Institutional structure – implementing agencies <lb/>Under the RGGVY, state governments through their State Power Utilities (SPUs) are responsible for <lb/>implementing the RGGVY in their territory. Central Public Sector Undertakings (PSUs) 43 can also <lb/>assist the states in carrying out rural electrification projects through project formulation, planning <lb/>and monitoring, and the provision of goods and services. The Rural Electrification Corporation (REC) <lb/>has therefore entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with some PSUs, namely NTPC, <lb/>Powergrid, NHPC and DVC to make available management expertise and capabilities to the states <lb/>that wish to work with them. The REC, as the nodal agency of the RGVVY, not only acts as a lending <lb/>agency, but also co-ordinates activities between the MoP and the MNRE, sets the framework for <lb/>project implementation and monitors and evaluates projects to ensure their timely <lb/>implementation. <lb/>Under the Remote Village Electrification programme, state nodal agencies are responsible for the <lb/>implementation of rural electrification projects. <lb/>3.3.4 Institutional structure – lending agencies <lb/>Under the RGGVY, the MoP grants 90% of the cost of rural electrification projects. States are <lb/>supposed to cover the remaining 10% of the cost either from their own funds or through loans from <lb/>the REC or other institutions. <lb/>The three main financial agencies in the power sector are the Rural Electrification Corporation Ltd. <lb/>(REC), the Power Finance Corporation (PFC) and the Indian Renewable Energy Development Agency <lb/>(IREDA). Only the REC is authorised to act as the nodal agency or lending agency for rural <lb/>electrification projects under RGGVY. IREDA supports a much wider range of projects in rural areas, <lb/>including minor-scale rural electrification schemes through renewable energy applications focusing <lb/>mainly on biomass and solar PV lighting systems. The PFC lends only to major generation and <lb/>transmission projects, but not to rural electrification programmes. <lb/>The Rural Electrification Corporation Ltd. was created in 1969 as a wholly government-owned <lb/>enterprise or nodal agency exclusively responsible for the implementation of rural electrification <lb/>schemes, through long-term financing and promotion of rural electrification projects in India. <lb/>Through the development of the power infrastructure in rural India, it has participated in the <lb/>development of the agricultural sector. Since its creation, the REC is India&apos;s main financing <lb/>institution for rural electrification and benefits from strong support from the government of India. <lb/>Today, although the REC continues to foster the development of rural electrification in India, it also <lb/>finances other segments of the power sector. The REC administers grants and provides loan <lb/>assistance to the State Electricity Boards/State Power Utilities for investment in rural electrification <lb/>schemes through its head office and 17 field offices. These field offices are essential to the work of <lb/>the REC as they collaborate with the state governments in which they are settled to help them <lb/>formulate various schemes and loan sanctions. On the basis of the proposals made by the states, <lb/>the REC divides responsibilities for electrification between the Ministry of Power and the Ministry of <lb/>New and Renewable Energies. In this respect, the REC decides which villages or hamlets will be <lb/>considered remote (where grid connection is either not feasible or not cost-effective) and therefore <lb/>which will be electrified through either the RGGVY or the Remote Village Renewable Energy <lb/>Programme (RVREP). <lb/></body>

			<body>Page | 74 <lb/>The Indian Renewable Energy Development Agency (IREDA) was established in 1987 under the <lb/>administrative control of the MNRE for the promotion of financial assistance in favour of renewable <lb/>energy and energy efficiency projects. One of the main objectives of IREDA is to act as a fund for the <lb/>financing and promotion of new and renewable energy sources and to assist in their rapid <lb/>commercialisation. In this respect, IREDA has found its role in providing financial support for the use <lb/>of renewable energies in the electrification of remote villages under the RVE programme of the <lb/>MNRE. <lb/>3.3.5 Institutional structure – monitoring and quality check <lb/>In order to keep up the pace of electrification, the MoP has asked the states to form state-level <lb/>Coordination Committees. These committees are required to meet regularly in order to resolve any <lb/>potential issue that could slow the pace of project development. States are also required to form <lb/>District Committees with representatives from various stakeholders, including elected members <lb/>and local communities. These District Committees help in the co-ordination and review of the <lb/>coverage of electrification within the district. The Ministry of Power has noted that where these <lb/>Committees were active and met regularly, progress in rural electrification projects had improved <lb/>(Press Information Bureau, 2009). <lb/>In addition, a milestone-based monitoring mechanism has been introduced to monitor the progress <lb/>of RGGVY projects from project sanction up to project completion. A web-based monitoring system <lb/>has also been introduced which works at village level. Through this monitoring system, <lb/>implementing agencies are supposed to provide all the data relating to activities carried out at <lb/>village level, the result of quality inspections, the state of fund utilisation, the state of village <lb/>electrification, etc. <lb/></body>

			<note place="footnote">3.3.6 Institutional structure – financial recovery process <lb/>Electricity connections are free for consumers below the poverty line (BPL). To facilitate recovery of <lb/>customer payments from those above the poverty line, the RGGVY has ordered the creation and <lb/>deployment of franchisees for the development/operation of &quot; a generation and distribution system <lb/>within an identified contiguous area for a prescribed duration and collect revenues directly from <lb/>rural consumers &quot; (Ministry of Power, 2009d). Such entities are meant to ensure stable revenue <lb/>flows and services to electricity consumers, by reducing commercial losses through facilitation of <lb/>efficient billing and revenue collection. All franchisees have common activities: they must purchase <lb/>bulk power, and ensure routine operation and maintenance of the distribution infrastructure. To <lb/>ensure the sustained efficiency of the franchisees, the RGGVY applies a process by which <lb/>franchisees are to be reviewed in case they fail to honour their contractual obligations with the <lb/>state government, such as, for instance, if they fail to collect the revenues from electricity <lb/>consumers, or fail to reimburse the cost of electricity. For this reason a termination clause is <lb/>included in the contractual obligations of the franchisee and the state government, if one or the <lb/>other fails to comply. Moreover, the Press Information Bureau (2009) noted that franchisees are <lb/>contributing to the employment of rural inhabitants. In August 2009, franchisees had been <lb/>established in a total of 99 643 villages. <lb/></note>

			<body>Page | 75 <lb/>3.4 Costs, incentives and tariffs <lb/>3.4.1 Costs of the RGGVY <lb/>The total costs of schemes under RGGVY have recently been estimated to reach USD 11.3 billion, <lb/>one-tenth of which is allocated to decentralised distributed generation (DDG). This includes projects <lb/>under both 10th and 11th Plans to be completed by March 2012. Total grants allocated by the <lb/>central government are expected to amount to USD 10.2 billion (INR 459 billion). 44 <lb/>Under the RGGVY scheme, 90% of the project costs is funded by the Ministry of Power. The state <lb/>governments fund the remaining 10% through either long-term loans from the REC or other <lb/>financial institutions, or out of their own budgets. However, government subsidies under the <lb/>RGGVY are expected to be allocated only once to finance the least-cost village electrification <lb/>projects. At the same time, rural households are expected to play an active role in the region&apos;s <lb/>economic development, which should lead to an increase in the revenue arising from productive <lb/>activities. The purpose is that the development of productive activities will generate enough <lb/>revenues to cover the costs incurred in power supply, operation and maintenance, and will also <lb/>ensure that no additional government money will be needed to fund the replacement in the future <lb/>of any part of the system. In the event the RGGVY scheme is not implemented in a satisfactory way, <lb/>capital subsidies will then be converted into interest-bearing loans as an incentive to correct the <lb/>implementation of the scheme. Up to 1% of the total subsidy will be allocated to research and <lb/>technology development, capacity building and, inter alia, the financing of pilot studies and <lb/>complementary projects under the rural electrification scheme. <lb/>For un-electrified households below the poverty line (BPL), electrification projects are 100% <lb/>financed by capital subsidies up to approximately USD 45 (INR 2 200) per rural household. Table 25 <lb/>shows the cost norms defined by the Ministry of Power for village electrification. <lb/>Table 25: Cost norms for village electrification <lb/>Electrification of un-electrified villages <lb/>Cost in INR <lb/>Cost in USD <lb/>a.

			<body>Financial Assistance (CFA) of the MNRE grants a subsidy covering up to 90% of the cost of the <lb/>project implementation, up to a predefined maximum of INR 18 000 (USD 360) per household <lb/>(Ministry of Power, 2008). In line with current practice under the RGGVY, the MNRE also offers a <lb/>100% capital subsidy for BPL household connections. <lb/>3.4.3 Framework conditions and business incentives <lb/>Lending agencies <lb/>To encourage banks and other lending institutions to consider rural electrification initiatives <lb/>favourably, the government of India has been working with the National Bank for Agriculture and <lb/>Rural Development (NABARD) and the Reserve Bank of India to facilitate norms, guidelines and <lb/>limits for capital costs. <lb/>Business incentives <lb/>The Electricity Act of 2003 has contributed to increase competition in the electricity sector. This act <lb/>has given private investors access to all power sector operations. As a consequence, state <lb/>governments encourage the private sector to invest in rural electrification projects. To do so, many <lb/>state governments have established administrative mechanisms to facilitate the process of approval <lb/>and clearance for the setting-up of small and medium-sized industries. Those specifically targeted <lb/>are industries that seek to use local resources for decentralised generation projects and stand-alone <lb/>systems. In this respect, a &quot; special enabling dispensation &quot; is considered for stand-alone systems of <lb/>up to 1 MW which use locally available resources and are based on proven cost-effective <lb/>technologies. Such projects will receive immediate approval for the following issues: <lb/> &quot; Change of land-use area as long as norms are satisfied; <lb/> Pollution clearance if the technology is proven to be within norms; <lb/> Safety clearances on the basis of self-certification conveyed to concerned authorities <lb/>(such certification making the developer fully liable for any infraction to safety <lb/>regulations). &quot; (Ministry of Power, 2005) <lb/>State governments are also responsible for setting up institutional arrangements for any <lb/>maintenance service or technical support for renewable energy systems. <lb/>After sales approach (spare parts, maintenance) <lb/>To make sure that an after sales approach is integrated in the design of the project before its <lb/>implementation, the RGGVY stipulates that any project seeking financial support must incorporate <lb/>plans for regular maintenance and upgrading. Moreover, the projects should demonstrate that <lb/>measures will be taken to minimise technical and commercial losses. <lb/>To ensure project sustainability under the RVE, annual maintenance contracts (AMC) with a <lb/>minimum 10-year duration warranty must include the replacement of parts or components such as <lb/>batteries, electronics, lamps, bulbs, etc. These AMCs guarantee efficient after-sales support. They <lb/>will be further detailed below. <lb/>3.4.4 Customer tariff setting <lb/>A major problem in India&apos;s electricity market is that electricity is often not paid for. Either electricity <lb/>is not billed for or when it is, it is not paid. Also, electricity theft is rampant, with annual losses <lb/>amounting to USD 4.5 billion, roughly 1.5% of GDP (World Bank, 2004). This loss of revenues <lb/></body>

			<body>amounts to a mass of implicit government subsidy, as noted in Electricity in India (IEA, 2002b), and <lb/>undermines the efficiency and long-term sustainability of the supply system, and in the long run <lb/>does not benefit electricity consumers. <lb/>Electricity tariffs are also a sensitive issue in India. Below poverty line households will be provided <lb/>with free electricity connections. By 2012 these electricity connections will be financed with <lb/>government capital up to INR 2 200 (approximately USD 45) per household in all rural habitations. <lb/>Those households above the poverty line will pay for their connection at prescribed connection <lb/>charges and no government subsidy will be released for this purpose. In the case of decentralised <lb/>systems, capital subsidies should not give rise to too many differences between the price that <lb/>remote villages powered by DDG systems will pay for electricity, and the price paid by villages <lb/>connected to the grid. But rural electricity tariffs are often lower than the average cost of electricity <lb/>supply, and state governments are responsible for making budgetary provisions for subsidised <lb/>electricity supply. <lb/>3.5 Country-specific challenges and how they were addressed <lb/>Franchisees and ownership <lb/>The creation of franchisees for the management of local power distribution in rural settings is a <lb/>requirement under the RGGVY. Because these structures reduce commercial losses through more <lb/>efficient billing and revenue collection, they ensure stable delivery of electricity. Franchisees can be <lb/>different legal entities, such as non-governmental organisations, co-operatives or individual <lb/>entrepreneurs. While their exact nature or structure may vary from one franchisee to another, they <lb/>all have common activities: they must purchase bulk power, and see to routine operation and <lb/>maintenance of the distribution infrastructure. Franchisees are granted a distribution licence <lb/>through a competitive bidding process. Those offering the cheapest bulk supply tariff will be <lb/>allowed to operate under a contract with the state governments. Franchisees are particularly <lb/>effective in the management of electricity provision and recovery as they are in close contact with <lb/>the targeted communities, and this has led to a stronger sense of ownership of the electrification <lb/>process. <lb/>Management and reduction of losses <lb/>Illegal hooking is still rampant in India, particularly in the rural villages, which are by definition <lb/>difficult to control. Through the 2003 Electricity Act, the Indian government made a fundamental <lb/>amendment to the Electricity Act of 1910, rendering theft of electricity a heavily penalised criminal <lb/>offence. Moreover, under the RGGVY, to prevent illegal hooking and so reduce commercial, <lb/>transmission and distribution losses, high-voltage distribution systems (HVDS) are being installed. <lb/>Through HVDS, the voltage profile is also improved and electricity supply is more reliable. <lb/>Franchisees also play an important role in reducing electricity theft, since they are responsible for <lb/>recovering payments and are in close contact with the targeted communities. <lb/>Corruption and mismanagement of funds have also been plaguing the system, which has caused the <lb/>RGGVY to progress unevenly in the states. To balance this, the release of funds by the REC under <lb/>the RGGVY scheme is now linked to the achievement of predetermined milestones, leading to more <lb/>control of the system. Also the electronic transfer of funds is used right up to the contractor level to <lb/>counter losses from fund mismanagement. <lb/>Participation of local communities for operation and maintenance <lb/>Under the Remote Village Electrification (RVE) programme of the Ministry of New and Renewable <lb/>Energies, effective operation, maintenance and sustainability of the projects is the responsibility of <lb/></body>

			<body>Page | 78 <lb/>the state governments. The participation of the local community is sought at the inception of the <lb/>project and efforts are made to ensure at least 15 years of operation and maintenance. To this end, <lb/>state governments aim to organise the training of local youth and to set up village committees. <lb/>However, as renewable energy systems develop rapidly, there is often an insufficient number of <lb/>trained workers who know how to maintain and operate systems such as, for instance, solar PV. A <lb/>more systematic approach to training would ensure better maintenance of the installed systems <lb/>(Baker and McKenzie, 2008). <lb/>Progress monitoring and maintenance <lb/>A Three-Tier Quality Monitoring Mechanism (TTQM) for the projects under the RGGVY has been put <lb/>in place (Ministry of Power, 2009e). For the first tier, a project implementing agency (PIA) works <lb/>with a third-party inspection agency to ascertain that all the materials used in the projects and <lb/>workmanship are conform to specifications. The REC is responsible for the second tier and will <lb/>inspect works and materials. It will also include quality checks of materials at the pre-shipment <lb/>stage. In the third tier, independent evaluators will be contracted by the Ministry of Power for <lb/>random evaluations (1% of villages) of the supply and construction of the projects. These <lb/>independent evaluators will report back to the REC or to the responsible supervisors in the second <lb/>tier, and the REC will make sure that the negative reports are followed up on. This monitoring <lb/>system has been set up to ensure that projects are properly implemented and to contribute to their <lb/>efficiency and long-term sustainability. <lb/>The RVE also encourages the setting-up of annual maintenance contracts (AMC) with a minimum <lb/>10-year warranty which includes the replacement of parts or components such as batteries, <lb/>electronics, lamps, bulbs, etc. to secure proper and sustained energy supply services. If some <lb/>projects are not covered by the 10-year AMC, sustainability is ensured through revenue collection <lb/>from electricity consumers, which should cover operational expenses. After the AMCs expire, <lb/>revenues could also be used to cover maintenance and repair expenses or replacement of spare <lb/>parts and defective components. <lb/>Availability and sufficiency of power supply <lb/>Under the RGGVY, state governments are responsible for providing adequate supply of electricity <lb/>with hours of supply being equal for rural and urban dwellers. States are responsible for ensuring <lb/>that at least 6 to 8 hours/day of electricity are supplied in rural areas. <lb/>Implementation of other policies <lb/>Energy efficiency clauses are one of the keys to the success of a rural electrification policy. The <lb/>government of India has made sure that productive processes are efficient or less energy-intensive <lb/>than standard ones. This applies particularly to the agricultural sector, which has been encouraged <lb/>to use economically viable irrigation pump sets and other energy-efficient farming equipment. <lb/>According to the Integrated Energy Policy (IEP), correct implementation of demand-side <lb/>management policies could save up to an estimated 15% of electricity consumption. The legal <lb/>framework for this IEP was provided by the Indian Energy Conservation Act 2001 the aim of which <lb/>was to accelerate energy efficiency in India. Since 2002, the Bureau of Energy Efficiency (BEE) has <lb/>been the governmental agency responsible for implementing the Energy Conservation Act. Some of <lb/>the major initiatives led by the BEE include: <lb/> Bachat Lamp Yojana: Promotion of energy-efficient and high-quality compact <lb/>fluorescent lamps (CFLs) to replace incandescent bulbs in households; <lb/> Standards &amp; Labelling Scheme: Targeting high energy end-use equipments and <lb/>appliances for minimum energy performance standards; <lb/></body>

The RGGVY <lb/>also planned to communicate massively through the media in rural areas in order to promote energy <lb/>efficiency, and sound management of the local electricity distribution system. <lb/>3.6 General challenges and conclusion <lb/>During the 10 th Plan, some basic problems hindered the successful implementation of rural <lb/>electrification programmes in India. First, India&apos;s rural distribution system is essentially low-density <lb/>with high technical and commercial losses leading to a high delivery cost. Therefore, utilities which <lb/>supplied power to rural areas usually considered such supply as commercially unviable, mainly <lb/>because of the high fixed and variable costs and &quot; unsustainable commercial arrangements &quot; <lb/>(Ministry of Power, 2005-2006). For this reason, utilities were generally not inclined to take up rural <lb/>electrification projects through funds arranged on a commercial loan basis, for fear of further <lb/>deterioration in their financial health. During the 10 th Five-Year Plan (FYP) there was only limited <lb/>financial outlay for the implementation of the RGGVY, and some cases of government corruption <lb/>and mismanagement of funds have plagued the system. Because of the lack of political will as well <lb/>as multi-institutional involvement and inadequate financial resources for the establishment of basic <lb/>transmission and distribution infrastructure in rural areas, resources were too scarce to allow for <lb/>the complete implementation of the RGGVY scheme during the 10 th Plan. <lb/>Implementation delays under the RGGVY have also been occurring at the state level. Some state <lb/>governments have been slow in awarding contracts owing to their lack of preparedness for <lb/>implementing projects on a turnkey basis; others have been slow in acquiring land for the 33/11 kV <lb/>sub-stations, others in providing authenticated lists of BPL households (in some states the number <lb/>of BPL households turned out to be greater than foreseen), and still others in providing necessary <lb/>forestry clearance. Sometimes, there was no monitoring because state-level committee meetings <lb/>had not been convened. Difficult terrain and floods in some states have added to the delay in <lb/>implementation of projects. Overall, there has been long-standing unavailability of sub-transmission <lb/>systems, of adequate quantities of material and equipment, particularly poles to be procured locally <lb/>in the project areas, and unavailability of adequately skilled manpower. Finally, franchisee systems <lb/>were slow to be put in place, which led to theft of materials and electricity as well as the non-<lb/>payment of bills in some states (Ministry of Power, 2009a). <lb/>With the 11 th Plan, there was strong political commitment to achieving the goal of 100% sustainable <lb/>village electrification. The apolitical implementation and monitoring of the projects has <lb/>strengthened the programme. But today, India is facing real constraints to widespread <lb/>electrification. India currently has insufficient electricity generating capacity, which is seriously <lb/>hindering the implementation of rural electrification programmes and undermining their viability. <lb/>Whether the targeted additional capacity of 78 700 MW over the 11 th Five-Year Plan will indeed be <lb/>reached and be sufficient to cover the needs for the full electrification of all villages and <lb/>45 Data reported by participating units in the National Energy Conservation Awards. <lb/></note>

			<body>households, remains to be seen. A minimum of 20 000 MW of power is estimated to be required to <lb/>meet the needs of the RGGVY alone (Vidyasagar, 2007). The productive use of electricity at the <lb/>household level would support load development and secure the viability of the electrification <lb/>efforts. Without a defined strategy for encouraging productive use of electricity at the household <lb/>level, the viability of the RGGVY scheme may be undermined. Moreover, the economic <lb/>sustainability of the electrification efforts is also undermined by the lack of systematic evaluation of <lb/>how operations&apos; costs can be recovered. Failure to assess the real potential for cost recovery may <lb/>lead to the need for-long term provision of government grants, way beyond the end of the <lb/>programme (Vidyasagar, 2007). Equally critical is the issue of the effective maintenance and proper <lb/>upgrading of the rural electricity infrastructure as well as its economic sustainability, which will <lb/>depend on the states and utilities&apos; long-term involvement. Finally, to reach the targets set under the <lb/>RGGVY in 2012, it is estimated that state utilities would have to &quot; gear up their effort by ten times &quot; <lb/>(Vidyasagar, 2007) and provide substantial financial commitment. <lb/>Comparative Study on Rural Electrification Policies in Emerging Economies – © OECD/IEA 2010 <lb/>Page | 81 <lb/>4 South Africa <lb/>Since 2000, the government of South Africa has been seeking to provide universal access to basic <lb/>services, including electricity. In 2009 South Africa achieved 75% electrification with 88% urban and <lb/>55% rural populations who gained access to electricity services (IEA, 2009b). South Africa&apos;s <lb/>electrification has been achieved mainly through grid extension. In the future, more renewable <lb/>sources may facilitate further electrification if barriers to their widespread use are overcome. South <lb/>Africa&apos;s energy sector, electrification efforts and remaining challenges are described below. <lb/>4.1 Introduction and country description <lb/>Rural electrification in South Africa is part and parcel of the transformation of South African society. <lb/>Since the first free election in 1994, all South African policies − including those of electricity <lb/>provision − contain an element of change. The objective is to eradicate historical inequalities based <lb/>on ethnicity. While a large proportion of poor people live in rural areas, there are also very many of <lb/>them in urban areas. The urban poor live predominantly in townships or in informal settlements. <lb/>During the Apartheid years, Black, Coloured and Asian people were not allowed to live in the same <lb/>areas as the white part of the population. Consequently each city, town and village had established <lb/>areas with good service delivery, and areas with poor or no service delivery. To date, there are still <lb/>areas without basic services such as water, sanitation and access to electricity. This chapter focuses <lb/>on the experience with electrification of the poor who live mainly, but far from exclusively, in the <lb/>rural areas. <lb/>Figure 9: Map of South Africa <lb/>The boundaries and names shown and the designations used on maps included in this publication do not <lb/>imply official endorsement or acceptance by the IEA. <lb/>Source: www.places.co.za. <lb/>The Republic of South Africa occupies the southern tip of Africa.

Although <lb/>South Africa is classified as semi-arid, there is considerable variation in climate as well as <lb/>topography. The climatic zones vary, from the extreme desert in the farthest north-west to the lush <lb/>subtropical climate in the east along the Mozambique border and the Indian Ocean. The terrain <lb/>consists of a vast interior plateau rimmed by rugged hills and narrow coastal plains. <lb/>GDP in purchasing power parity has shown a steady growth over the past years and is estimated to <lb/>be USD 495 billion in 2009 (International Monetary Fund, 2009). South Africa has one of the highest <lb/>rates of income inequality in the world. <lb/>The transformation of the society is based on the understanding that economic changes require <lb/>active strategic intervention from the State. This encompasses continued state ownership of <lb/>entities in the energy and transport sectors as well as acting as a catalyst towards the broader <lb/>development of the economy. The private sector is, however, expected to play an active and <lb/>integral role in the economy. Moreover, affirmative action policies such as the Broad-based Black <lb/>Economic Empowerment (BBBEE), which obliges companies to comply with a broad range of quotas <lb/>(ownership, management positions, general staff, etc.) for formally disadvantaged groups, are <lb/>furthering the transformation of the society. <lb/>According to the last census conducted in 2001, total population had then reached 44.8 million. By <lb/>end-2008 total population was estimated to have increased to over 48 million, including some <lb/>4 million immigrants mainly from other African countries (Statistics South Africa, 2009). This gives a <lb/>population density of 39 per km², which is low, ranking 170 th in the world. <lb/>Table 26: Mid-year 2007 population count estimate and ethnic distribution <lb/>Total number <lb/>% of the population <lb/>African <lb/>38 079 900 <lb/>79.6 <lb/>Coloured <lb/>46 <lb/>4 245 000 <lb/>8.9 <lb/>Asian <lb/>1 173 700 <lb/>2.5 <lb/>White <lb/>4 352 100 <lb/>9.1 <lb/>Total <lb/>47 850 700 <lb/>Source: Statistics South Africa (2008a). <lb/>South Africa is known for its diversity in cultures, languages and religious beliefs.

It <lb/>was renamed Department of Energy (DoE) after the general elections in April 2009 and the restructuring of <lb/>government departments. <lb/>Source: Department of Minerals and Energy (2006). <lb/>Most of South Africa&apos;s energy supply comes from coal (see Table 27). South Africa ranks fourth in <lb/>the world in the production of hard coal, and is the fifth-largest exporter of hard coal in the world <lb/>(IEA, 2008). In 2007, South Africa&apos;s electricity generation reached 266 Twh (IEA, 2009a). South Africa <lb/>has an installed capacity of 43 650 MW (Platts, 2008) which represents close to 34.5% of the African <lb/>continent&apos;s total installed capacity. Electricity is produced mainly from coal (94%). Eskom – the <lb/>national power utility – generates 97% of the electricity. Around 55% of the distribution is managed <lb/>by Eskom and 45% by the municipalities (National Energy Regulator South Africa, 2006a). Since <lb/>1994 no new generation capacity has been built. Because of strong economic growth, rapid <lb/>industrialisation and a massive electrification programme, Eskom&apos;s surplus capacity has been <lb/>reduced to below safe production levels. In January 2008, massive power outages occurred <lb/>nationwide. South Africa has since embarked on aggressive demand-side management (DSM), <lb/>energy efficiency, as well as planning new generating capacity programmes. South Africa has one of <lb/>the lowest electricity tariffs in the world with an average selling price at around USD 0.027 per kWh. <lb/>In 2000 the South African government declared that everybody should have access to basic <lb/>services, including electricity and water. Access to modern energy and water has become a social <lb/>right that must be addressed at national, provincial and municipality levels. The electrification rate <lb/>of South Africa is 75% in 2009. (Electrification is registered as electrification of households and not <lb/>as the number of people). But there is a great variation in the electrification rate between the <lb/>provinces, with Eastern Cape being mainly a rural area and having the lowest electrification rate <lb/>(60%) and Western Cape having the highest rate (86%) as shown in Table 28. <lb/></body>

Eskom held a state-<lb/>supported monopoly and would electrify an area upon instruction from the government or connect <lb/>a consumer if the consumer would pay. There was systematic neglect of full service delivery to the <lb/>Coloured, Black and Asian communities. In 1994, after the first free election was held, it was <lb/>estimated that approximately 6 million households (Department of Energy, 2009b) were without <lb/>electricity. The backlog in electrification was largely race-based and hence electrification became <lb/>part of the national priorities to redress the errors and inequalities of the past. <lb/>In 1994, Parliament approved a plan to ensure equal access to basic services for all South Africans. <lb/>The National Energy Regulator 47 was given the task to develop and oversee the implementation of <lb/>the Integrated National Electrification Programme (INEP). Eskom was tasked by NERSA to undertake <lb/>the implementation through the use of contractors as part of any other Eskom business. In 2001 it <lb/>was decided that the DoE would be responsible for the implementation and oversight of the <lb/>electrification programme. <lb/>Municipalities are now responsible for reticulation and distribution of electricity to households as <lb/>well as to small businesses. Eskom maintains direct supply of electricity to larger industries. In 2008, <lb/></body>

			<body>Page | 85 <lb/>Eskom generated approximately 97% of the electricity and distributed some 55% to end-consumers <lb/>while the rest was sold to the municipalities, that in turn distributed it to the end-consumers <lb/>(National Energy Regulator South Africa, 2006b). <lb/>In 2001 the DoE mandated that not only Eskom but also registered municipalities could receive <lb/>national funding to roll out the national electrification programme. DoE is responsible for <lb/>monitoring their actual performance and ensuring that corrective measures are taken in case of <lb/>poor or non-performance. Such poor or non-performance occurs in municipalities that are licensed <lb/>but not yet experienced in rolling out grid connections. For this reason, DoE has occasionally <lb/>provided one-off capacity building support to such municipalities. <lb/>The electrification programme benefits from a special allocation from National Treasury and not <lb/>funded through cross-subsidies. Once households are electrified, consumers are billed by the <lb/>municipalities. The main funding of the National Electrification Programme is through the National <lb/>Budget. External donor agencies, in particular the German KfW, support the electrification of <lb/>schools and clinics. Also NORAD, the Norwegian agency for development co-operation, provides <lb/>support in the form of capacity building, for example to monitor sale and management of <lb/>electricity, also at the municipal level. <lb/>In remote rural areas, where the lowest-capacity grid system cannot be supplied within the capital <lb/>expenditure limit and outside the 3-year grid electrification plan, provision is made for non-grid <lb/>electrification through solar home systems (SHS) (Department of Energy, 2009c). An amount <lb/>equivalent to the lower end of average electrification costs is fully subsidised by the government to <lb/>cover part of the capital costs of non-grid electrification. Rural end-users will purchase non-grid <lb/>electricity from the service provider who will, among other things, provide maintenance for the <lb/>SHS. Since these cannot meet the cooking/thermal needs of households, one of the requirements of <lb/>the DoE is that the suppliers of non-grid technologies augment their services by selling thermal fuels <lb/>such as paraffin and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG). The installation of SHS must be such that the <lb/>maximum densification of the installed base is achieved in a specific area. The service provider, who <lb/>holds a monopoly for servicing an area, must make sure that universal access is achieved in a village <lb/>identified as a non-grid area. In early 1999, the DoE issued a call for proposals for non-grid rural <lb/>electrification. Of the 28 responses received, six consortia were selected through an open bidding <lb/>process to participate in the first phase of a programme to provide non-grid electricity services to <lb/>identified areas. The six private companies are Summer Sun Trading (Pty) Ltd; Shine The Way cc; <lb/>ILITHA Cooperative; Electricité de France; Total Fina Elf Group; Nuon RAPS Utility (Pty) Ltd; Solar <lb/>Vision (Pty) Ltd, and a EUR 50 million support from KfW. <lb/>The electrification programme deadline has been moved from 2012 to 2014 by which time the <lb/>backlog in electrification should be completed. <lb/>4.3 Description of current electrification programmes and <lb/>objectives <lb/>The Integrated National Electrification Programme (INEP) consists of a grid-connection programme, <lb/>a non-grid programme, household connections, electrification of schools and of all registered <lb/>clinics. The main focus is the grid connection, and non-grid connection is only used if there are no <lb/>other feasible options to extend the grid within a foreseeable future. <lb/>Before 1994, South Africa only focused on electrification of urban areas. In 1993, some 30% of <lb/>households were electrified. Since 1994, there has been a fundamental shift towards electrifying all <lb/></body>

			<body>households, including those living in rural areas. The grid electrification rate has since then <lb/>increased from 30% in 1993 to 73% in March 2008 (Department of Minerals and Energy, 2008b), <lb/>that is 4.5 million more households (Table 29). The increase in coverage is the result of both <lb/>extending the grid to new communities such as rural areas and connecting the unconnected in <lb/>already electrified areas. The electrification rates vary depending on the complexities of grid <lb/>extension and population density, with the relatively higher-density areas having been electrified <lb/>first. <lb/>Table 29: National grid electrification of households by Eskom and municipalities 1994-2008 <lb/>1994/2001 2001/02 2002/03 2003/04 2004/05 2005/06 2006/07 2007/08 2008/09 <lb/>Number of <lb/>households <lb/>3 036 726 <lb/>338 572 <lb/>278 762 <lb/>312 187 <lb/>213 127 <lb/>241 703 <lb/>105 625 <lb/>221 439 <lb/>87 221 <lb/>Source: IEA analysis. <lb/>In 2009, 3.4 million households still remain to be electrified in South Africa (Mketsi, 2009) of which <lb/>about half (1.7 million) live in informal settlements. It is a priority of the South African government <lb/>that the problems faced by the 1.7 million households living in informal settlements be resolved by <lb/>their municipal councils, before electrification can be implemented. The areas must either be <lb/>formalised, or the households must move to other formalised human settlements before they can <lb/>benefit from the national electrification programme. This is because it is not cost-effective to <lb/>electrify an unstable dwelling that may be demolished or destroyed by any climatic occurrence. For <lb/>the 1.7 million households in formal settlements, a plan, including budget, is in place to ensure <lb/>connection before 2014. A major challenge in the household electrification programme is the actual <lb/>housing backlog, for which a special policy has been drawn up (Department of Energy, 2009d). <lb/>The INEP includes special plans for electrification of all clinics and all schools to catch up with all <lb/>remaining backlogs. Schools and clinics can be electrified by using funds from the INEP or through <lb/>donor funding. Adherence to all agreed technical standards is required, whether for grid or non-grid <lb/>connections. By 2007, full electrification of all registered health clinics in the country had been <lb/>successfully completed one year ahead of schedule. By 2007, 700 schools had been electrified but <lb/>the programme has been behind schedule, largely because of poor information abut the number of <lb/>schools to be dealt with in the smaller municipalities (Department of Energy, 2009b; Seshotlho, <lb/>2009). <lb/>Over the past years, the DoE has undertaken systematic monitoring of the INEP&apos;s socio-economic <lb/>impact (Department of Energy, 2009j). Monitoring is carried out among newly electrified <lb/>consumers. (In the longer run it will be interesting to undertake broader economic assessments to <lb/>locate possible long-term changes.) This monitoring exercise has revealed that the majority, 96%, of <lb/>electrified households use electricity for lighting and TV; 63% use electricity also for cooking; a large <lb/>proportion of the population, 34%, use electricity for heating. In comparison, the majority of un-<lb/>electrified households use candles for lighting, use wood or paraffin for cooking and wood for <lb/>heating (see following charts). <lb/></body>

The standard was <lb/>expanded to allow the use of SWER directly coupled to 33 kV three-phase systems with neutral <lb/>earthing compensator (NEC) earthing. SWER networks were seen as low-cost or cost-effective <lb/>solutions for the provision of network infrastructure in areas where consumption is low (domestic <lb/>and few other applications such as limited water pumping). Take-off points are very sparse and lines <lb/>feeding less than 200 kVA are typically about 100 kilometres long (Gendenhuys &amp; McLaren, 2007). <lb/>The South African government supports the principle that basic services should be available and <lb/>affordable to all. For this reason, to ensure that the poor benefit directly from electrification, they <lb/>are allocated a 20-amps connection free of charge. Furthermore, there is a 50 kWh free monthly <lb/>allocation implemented by the municipalities insofar as this is possible for the municipalities. The <lb/>50 kWh free basic electricity has been widely debated. While the free allocation is meant to support <lb/>the poor, the very poor might not yet be connected to the grid. And these very poor might live in <lb/>poor municipalities that cannot afford the roll-out of the free basic electricity. In addition, high <lb/>administrative costs are incurred in the application of &quot; means tests &quot; in order to verify eligibility for <lb/>free basic supply. To avoid these administrative costs, some municipalities have opted to apply free <lb/>basic allocation to all domestic consumers, with the unintended consequence that wealthy <lb/>consumers receive the free basic allocation if they happen to reside in one of those municipalities. <lb/>South Africa has one of the lowest electricity tariffs in the world, with an average selling price (as <lb/>illustrated below) at around USD 0.027 per kWh. Despite the tariff regime, there is argued and <lb/>documented energy poverty among both electrified and non-electrified consumers (Department of <lb/>Energy, 2009g).

As mentioned before, the incentive paid will never be more than <lb/>the actual cost of connection incurred by the farmer. A certain amount of the incentive will be <lb/>retained by the licensed entity to cover the administration costs incurred during the electrification <lb/>project for the farm dwelling houses. This amount may not be more than 10% of the total incentive <lb/>paid out. The incentive will cover the costs of the low-voltage reticulation costs, the service <lb/>connection, the meter (including a three-point plug and a light). The incentive will not cover any <lb/>internal wiring or electrical appliances. The payment of the incentive is subject to a minimum supply <lb/>size of 20 A being installed and a network built in accordance with relevant industry standards. This <lb/>incentive will not be given for the electrification of holiday cottages, dairies, sheds, water pumps, <lb/>churches and schools, etc. <lb/>The electrification of unproclaimed/informal areas (Department of Energy, 2009d) was sanctioned <lb/>by the Minister of Minerals and Energy in February 2005, as a strategy to catch up with backlog and <lb/>ensure &quot; Universal Access &quot; by 2012 (now 2014). As mentioned above, informal settlements need to <lb/>be formalised before they can be electrified. The policy stipulates that in order to be eligible for <lb/>electrification, informal settlements must be in close proximity to existing infrastructure and in a <lb/>position where electrification is practicable and not encumbered by any potential environmental, <lb/>geographical, health or safety hazard. Further, the settlement must be stable (i.e. there is no further <lb/>growth or relocation planned for the foreseeable future). The conditions also include that the <lb/>community supports the proposal and is willing to co-operate with the opening-up of access roads <lb/>where necessary, keep these access roads clear, supply and organise local labour where required, <lb/>and help prevent tampering with or reselling of electricity supplies. <lb/>4.4.3 Employment creation <lb/>The INEP contributes directly to job creation in local areas. Even if many of the jobs are temporary, <lb/>individuals have received some training and earned some income for up to several years. The DoE <lb/>has assessed that the INEP will have created an estimated 6 000 jobs in financial year 2008/09 <lb/>(compared to 3 100 jobs created in 2001/02) (Department of Energy, 2009i). The cumulated <lb/>number of jobs that have been created so far by the electrification programme has reached <lb/>32 995 (Department of Energy, 2009j). <lb/>4.5 Country-specific challenges and how they were addressed <lb/>South Africa&apos;s rural electrification challenges are those challenges associated with the <lb/>transformation of society to erase the inequalities from the past. <lb/>While articles on rural electrification often plead for special electricity provision for the poor, this <lb/>argument does not exist in the mainstream debate in South Africa. By declaring that all citizens <lb/>have an equal right to basic services such as clean water, electricity, access to schools and clinics, <lb/>the challenge there becomes an issue of delivery, not just allocation of funds. As South Africa has <lb/></div>

			<body>decided that basic services are to be provided by the government, the concern is on optimising and <lb/>providing long-term best economic solutions rather than short-term financial solutions. <lb/>Pricing <lb/>Sustainable implementation and possible adjustment of current tariff policies are open for <lb/>discussion. Eskom&apos;s average selling price was ZAR 0.26 (USD 0.034) in 1979, dropping to ZAR 0.17 <lb/>(USD 0.022) in 2005 (Molefe, 2008). These low tariffs are one of the causes of the current electricity <lb/>shortage across South Africa. 49 Because Eskom has sold electricity at ZAR 0.20 (USD 0.027)/kWh and <lb/>imported electricity from neighbouring countries at prices around ZAR 0.05 (USD 0.007), it has not <lb/>been financially feasible for South Africa − as it would not be for any country − to install new power <lb/>generation. In South Africa alone, the generation margin was only 4% in 2008, leading to endless <lb/>power cuts and systematic load shedding. It is now generally accepted that tariff changes are <lb/>needed on top of tariff increases. It is estimated that tariffs will double over a three-year period <lb/>with the first average 28% increase having already taken effect in 2008. The current debate includes <lb/>considerations on differential tariff increases to protect the poor, a &quot; home-light &quot; tariff for the low-<lb/>income sector, a similar tariff for small, micro and medium-sized enterprises (SMMEs), and time-of-<lb/>use tariffs. This debate is in line with South Africa&apos;s rural electrification agenda, as new power <lb/>generation will be necessary to service more households. <lb/>Employment <lb/>Employment is a major challenge in South Africa. The average official 50 unemployment figures are <lb/>above 20% (see Table 33), excluding the under-employed in the rural and urban areas or those who <lb/>are not registered in employment agencies. <lb/>Table 33: South African unemployment rates <lb/>March 2003 <lb/>March 2004 <lb/>March 2005 <lb/>March 2006 <lb/>March 2007 <lb/>Total in % <lb/>29.3 <lb/>26.4 <lb/>24.2 <lb/>23.1 <lb/>23.6 <lb/>Source: Statistics South Africa (2008b). <lb/>As indicated by the results of the 2009 Socio-Economic Survey undertaken by the Department of <lb/>Energy, the rural electrification programme has generated 32 995 jobs over the last eight years. <lb/>Payment for electricity is an issue for people who have no or very little income. Many cases of <lb/>domestic violence in newly electrified households have been amply documented. It is argued that <lb/>domestic trouble starts over priorities when resources are scarce (Habitat for Humanity, 2009). <lb/>However, the long-term effect of ensuring universal access to electricity should lead to general <lb/>opportunities for a broad-based economic development. Providing an area, including a rural area, <lb/>with modern energy can be seen as a tool to attract businesses that can generate jobs locally, for <lb/>example in tourism. There are many examples of increased tourism along the entire coastline of <lb/>South Africa. These jobs and facilities could not have been created without the provision of <lb/></body>

			<note place="footnote">49 Another major cause was South Africa&apos;s indecision on how to proceed with the privatisation of Eskom, <lb/>which has created much insecurity within Eskom and stalled its plans for capacity expansion. <lb/>50 The unofficial unemployment rate is closer to the international definition of unemployment since people <lb/>who have not been actively looking for a job within the last six months are also taken into account, while the <lb/>official rate disregards them. There are also wide variations between ethnic groups. In the second quarter of <lb/>2009, official statistics report 27.9% of Black/African unemployed, 19.5% of Coloured, 11.3 of Indians/Asians <lb/>and 4.6% of Whites were unemployed. <lb/></note>

			<body>electricity in the area. The impact on long-term economic development will be interesting to follow <lb/>and assess. <lb/>Capacity <lb/>Current generating capacity in Southern Africa is insufficient to meet the demand and the reserve <lb/>margin is below a safe 10% operating margin. In 2009, South Africa&apos;s maximum installed capacity <lb/>reached 36 208 MW. National plans are in place to expand the power supply, effectively doubling <lb/>installed generation to some 80 000 MW by 2025 with associated grid expansion and strengthening, <lb/>but the implementation of these plans is surprisingly slow. South Africa has not built a power plant <lb/>in over 20 years 51 and, in the meantime, the national expertise to plan, take decisions and manage <lb/>the complex implementation process has eroded. <lb/>Energy efficiency <lb/>The productive economy, including the building stock and residential appliances, was established in <lb/>an environment of low tariffs and abundant supply. The principle &quot; save power &quot; was virtually <lb/>unheard of until 2005 when South Africa launched its first national strategy for energy efficiency. <lb/>Despite this new strategy, it was not until 2008 − when severe blackouts hit the country − that <lb/>South African decision makers were able to win support for changes in the tariff regime and for the <lb/>creation of energy efficiency targets. The shortage of power is now so severe that nationally <lb/>mandated energy efficiency measures have been introduced. Large users of energy have been <lb/>instructed to save 10% power, and municipalities have also asked local customers to reduce <lb/>electricity consumption. There has been some confusion in the public debate in South Africa where <lb/>some argue that supplying electricity to the poor is the cause of the present shortage. However, this <lb/>is unlikely because of the relatively low consumption of poor households. Industry and urban <lb/>residents are the largest consumers and have been benefiting for a long time. National energy <lb/>efficiency efforts should be directed primarily to those who consume the most electricity and <lb/>whose potential for savings are the greatest. In an attempt to maximise and accelerate the <lb/>reduction of the housing backlog, energy efficiency has largely been overlooked in the design and <lb/>construction process. Principles are now established to correct these errors and ensure that all <lb/>houses, including the very small ones, comply with the best-practice energy efficiency standards. <lb/>South African standard SANS204 does prescribe maximum standards for energy consumption. <lb/>National departments and donor agencies are ready to support municipalities&apos; efforts to upgrade <lb/>the housing and building stock so as to prevent future negative impacts on climate change for <lb/>having neglected the construction industry. The DoE launched the appliance labelling programme <lb/>for energy efficiency in 2004 in accordance with the EU standards and labelling programme. <lb/>Unfortunately, there is no financial support to roll out the programme. This is regretful as South <lb/>Africa and the whole of Africa increasingly receive outdated appliances. The DoE will soon start an <lb/>industrial energy efficiency programme focusing on system optimisation with the support of the <lb/>United Nations Industrial and Development Organization (UNIDO), the Swiss State Secretariat for <lb/>Economic Affairs (SECO) and the UK Department for International Development (DFID). Finally, the <lb/>DoE is also in the process of signing an energy efficiency project for the building sector to improve <lb/>efficiency in the construction of buildings and houses, including the use of appliances. <lb/></body>

			<body>Page | 94 <lb/>Non-grid electrification programme <lb/>Off-grid electrification is carried out by private-sector service providers (concessionaires) who have <lb/>successfully tendered for concessions in designated areas. The non-grid electrification programme <lb/>which expected to install 300 000 solar home systems (SHS) in 1998 has not managed to reach its <lb/>objective. To date, only around 50 000 SHS have been installed and programmes are running in only <lb/>a couple of provinces. Lack of political will and government support has thwarted the process. Some <lb/>concessionaires have been providing maintenance for the systems, charging on a fee-for-service <lb/>basis, while others have not provided this service. Non-payment of bills has also been a cause for <lb/>concern in most concessionaires and lack of expected government capital subsidies has delayed <lb/>much of the work. Decision making concerning the definition of a non-grid area has also caused <lb/>delays and costs to the concessionaires. These difficulties have weakened the financial stability of <lb/>the concessionaires and delayed the installation process. <lb/>Renewable energy <lb/>Poor policy implementation and lack of clear financial and legal regimes have constrained the <lb/>development and introduction of new renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, modern <lb/>bioenergy, etc. Only in 2009 has renewable energy officially been accepted as &quot; real &quot; power and the <lb/>first national feed-in tariff scheme was established (National Energy Regulator South Africa, 2009). <lb/>South Africa has one of the best sun regimes in the world. Yet it has one of the lowest penetrations <lb/>of solar water heaters (SWH). Experience with non-grid electrification through solar heating systems <lb/>(SHS) has taught a lesson that solar panels are subject to theft and vandalism. Information <lb/>campaigns and community development programmes help reduce vandalism. <lb/>Poor perception of renewable energy <lb/>Further, there is a perception that solar energy is not &quot; real &quot; energy; and SHSs are viewed as a <lb/>temporary solution until the grid can be extended. Some municipalities have begun to install SWH <lb/>in an effort to prevent load shedding. These efforts are seen to contribute positively to securing <lb/>sufficient electricity on the grid and to change the perception that renewable energy is not &quot; real &quot; <lb/>electricity. <lb/>Electricity losses <lb/>Total electricity losses other than technical vary from between 10% and 15%, which includes system <lb/>losses and theft (Seshotlho, 2009; Madzhie, 2009). Bypassing of meters is frequent by tapping at the <lb/>supply points, and is generally well organised by groups of individuals &quot; assisting &quot; members of the <lb/>local community, usually for a nominal fee. Law enforcement is applied, but illegal reconnections <lb/>occur with minimum delay, often at the request of the households concerned. The reasons <lb/>variously cited are inability to pay for supply, or the &quot; entitlement &quot; to a basic right enshrined in the <lb/>Constitution. Cable theft is a national problem and there is no evidence to support that rural areas <lb/>or poor areas are more subject to cable theft than other areas (Seshotlho, 2009). Eskom runs <lb/>regular campaigns to report cable theft, and security patrols are used by both Eskom and <lb/>municipalities to detect and avert theft. Despite the national power generation shortage, a number <lb/>of municipalities use 24-hour street lighting as an early warning system of supply interruptions due <lb/>to cable fault or theft. <lb/>Prepaid electricity meters <lb/>Prepaid electricity meters form part of the installation for all new connections under the INEP <lb/>(Smuts, 2007). Initially, their introduction aimed at displacing &quot; conventional &quot; credit meters in order <lb/>to reduce the administrative costs associated with monthly readings and billings. Further, credit <lb/>meters were generally mounted on external walls of dwellings (in all residential areas), and <lb/>suspicion was widespread that supply was accessed by unauthorised users. Hence, prepaid meters, <lb/></body>

			<body>mounted inside dwellings, offered security while also affording the opportunity for consumers to <lb/>monitor the consumption of the appliances they use. These meters also reduced the problem of <lb/>non-payment. When selling prepaid electricity, the challenge of providing a convenient payment <lb/>point close to every home can easily be underestimated. In most instances, the change from credit <lb/>meters to prepaid meters was started with a focus on the installation of meters, but it was soon <lb/>found that the system only started to operate smoothly once the focus included the sales channel <lb/>as well. From an end-user&apos;s perspective, the real delivery process has much more to do with the <lb/>logistics of moving vouchers (sometimes called &quot; tokens &quot; or &quot; PINs &quot; ) from a computer where they are <lb/>generated, to the user&apos;s home and moving the cash from the user&apos;s pockets to the utility&apos;s bank <lb/>account. However, in the disadvantaged communities targeted by the INEP, few residents have <lb/>bank accounts. They receive their salaries in cash (often daily or weekly) and when they purchase <lb/>electricity they do frequent (once a week) small (about ZAR 30) transactions and pay in cash. In <lb/>most municipalities, this group forms the bulk of the clients. Since either a mechanism (such as an <lb/>unattended vending machine) or a person is needed to collect the cash during the transaction, this <lb/>also forms the most challenging part of the community to sell to. However, as long as there is cell <lb/>phone reception, cell phone vending has few boundaries and can reach informal settlements and <lb/>newly developed suburbs with very little infrastructure. <lb/>Implementation capacity <lb/>A major challenge in South Africa is lack of human technical capacity and accurate information from <lb/>the municipalities. The problem relates to all aspects of electricity markets: number of customers, <lb/>monitoring of losses, collection of revenue and also information about the number of schools and <lb/>their electrification status. This is a major reason why school electrification has not yet been <lb/>completed. Some municipalities have weak institutions and have constrained capacities to provide <lb/>basic information, thus failing to receive the necessary attention. In very special cases the DoE has <lb/>allocated funds to build up capacity to manage the electricity supply and collection of revenues. <lb/>4.6 Rural electrification progress assessment and conclusion <lb/>The South African national electrification programme has shown impressive results. The <lb/>electrification rate has increased from 30% in 1993 to 73% in 2008 (Department of Energy, 2008a). <lb/>Ambitious plans are in place to achieve full national access to modern energy, mainly through <lb/>provision of connection to the national grid by 2014. Policies and funds are also allocated to ensure <lb/>that areas or individual houses that cannot be connected to the grid can be serviced through <lb/>different means of modern energy applications such as solar PV. <lb/>The cost per connection in 2008 was on average around USD 1 000. The costs vary depending on <lb/>population density and terrain but the average cost is kept within the planned budgets. <lb/>The DoE is responsible for managing the INEP. The programme is carried out through grid <lb/>connections by Eskom and those municipalities that have been licensed to roll out electrification, <lb/>while non-grid electrification is provided by concessionaires. <lb/>The DoE monitors the implementation through field checks and similar direct follow-ups and <lb/>initiates corrective measures when results are not as planned. But there has been an <lb/>implementation deficit at the DoE because of insufficient capacity and poor co-ordination between <lb/>the non-grid component of INEP and the Renewable Energy Directorate, which is impeding the <lb/>efficiency of the Department. <lb/></body>

			<body>There are several reasons why completion of the national electrification programme has had to be <lb/>postponed from 2012 to 2014. <lb/>Household electrification − the main component of the INEP − is under pressure. A major challenge <lb/>in the household electrification programme is a severe housing backlog. It is estimated that around <lb/>1.7 million households (half the estimated total of non-electrified households in May 2009) live in <lb/>informal settlements. This means that their dwellings are built illegally and are not classified as <lb/> &quot; houses &quot; because of their unsatisfactory construction. Although households in these informal <lb/>settlements are entitled to equal access to electricity, it would not be cost-effective to electrify a <lb/>shack dwelling that may be demolished at any time or destroyed in the next rainstorm. Hence, it is a <lb/>key government priority that the issues around the 1.7 million households living in informal <lb/>settlements be addressed first (by their respective municipal councils): either the areas must be <lb/>formalised, or the inhabitants must be moved to other formalised human settlements before they <lb/>can be included in the INEP. The DoE&apos;s policy guideline addresses this matter, and a plan and its <lb/>budget are in place to enable connection before 2014 if the Department of Housing or the <lb/>municipality arrange for people to live in formalised housing. <lb/>A second challenge is the municipalities&apos; capacity to deliver and oversee delivery of quality <lb/>electrification. The DoE, which is also facing capacity deficits, seeks to monitor actual performance <lb/>and to make sure that corrective measures are taken in case of under-or non-performance. Under-<lb/>or non-performance occurs in those licensed municipalities whose officials are inexperienced in the <lb/>rolling-out of grid connections. Instead of contracting nationally well-established service providers <lb/>for the physical implementation of electrification schemes, municipality officials may succumb to <lb/>pressure by the local communities to support local contractors. The combination of local pressure, <lb/>weak technical know-how, and stretched municipal capacity in general leads to delays in the <lb/>implementation or in failure to meet quality criteria. Corrective measures are then required before <lb/>the DoE releases more funds. In order to accelerate implementation and quality delivery, the DoE <lb/>has established guidelines for all the stages of the electrification programme and occasionally <lb/>provides one-off capacity building support to weaker municipalities. In the case of non-grid <lb/>electrification, non-acceptance of renewable energy systems as a solution for the provision of <lb/>electricity is slowing down the electrification process. <lb/>Electrification of registered clinics has been successfully completed ahead of schedule. <lb/>Electrification of schools, however, is facing problems largely stemming from lack of information <lb/>about the number of schools and their electrification status. Some municipalities fail to report the <lb/>number of schools in their area or fail to provide accurate information on whether the schools are <lb/>electrified or not. It is clear that this poses a major constraint for the entities in charge of the <lb/>electrification of the as-yet un-electrified schools. The lack of proper information is indeed one of <lb/>the many capacity shortfalls at municipality level. Other capacity gaps are improper recording of <lb/>sales of electricity leading to sub-optimal income streams, and sub-optimal network maintenance. <lb/>Both the DoE and the National Energy Regulator (NERSA) recognise these challenges and, in very <lb/>special cases, the DoE has allocated funds to build up capacity to manage electricity supply and the <lb/>collection of revenues. <lb/>An important by-product of the INEP is the adoption of standard methodologies, coupled with a <lb/>greater awareness of technology options. The standards were established after broad stakeholder <lb/>consultations, including electricity utility practitioners, equipment suppliers, regulatory bodies and <lb/>end-user representatives. These standards are now widely used not only in South Africa but also <lb/>throughout the Southern African region. The INEP provides incentives for a range of new <lb/>technologies, including planning tools, to meet a variety of site-specific conditions during the roll-<lb/>out of the programme. <lb/></body>

			<page>Page | 97 <lb/></page>

			<body>In the case of South Africa&apos;s electrification programme the policy of &quot; inventing &quot; technologies <lb/>specifically for the poor has not been successful. If solar water heating had been used by the richer <lb/>households and in the cities, then the technology could have been extended to the poorer <lb/>communities. The rapid flow of information has determined electrification preferences of the <lb/>people. Cities have been electrified through grid extension. Renewable energy is publicly called <lb/> &quot; rural energy &quot; , and this has led to the negative image attached to all renewable energy applications. <lb/>The implementation of the DoE programme for renewable energy has been slow and the share of <lb/>renewable energy in power supply is still insignificant. In 2008, Eskom launched a programme to <lb/>subsidise solar water heating (SWH), but the subsidy level was too low and required massive <lb/>administration and control systems so that the programme has had little success. Since 2008 some <lb/>municipalities have introduced SWH as a way of avoiding load shedding by Eskom. In early 2009 <lb/>South Africa announced a feed-in tariff for grid-connected renewable energy. <lb/>Finally, the South African example confirms what some documentation has revealed: that rural <lb/>electrification in itself does not lead to economic growth or business development. Rural <lb/>electrification does not generate local jobs – except those jobs created for the implementation of <lb/>the electrification schemes. This was confirmed by the Socio-Economic Surveys undertaken by the <lb/>DoE. Rural economic development needs more than just household electrification. Constraints on <lb/>the availability of energy and its affordability affect economic development, especially in rural <lb/>areas. Modern energy services promote economic development by enhancing the productivity of <lb/>labour and capital. There are important development benefits to be gained from expanding access <lb/>to modern energy services. In order to achieve rural development objectives, however, there needs <lb/>to be an integrated approach to the provision of modern energy services and improved information <lb/>and telecommunication, education, health and transport services. The long-term effect on the <lb/>population of smoke-free kitchens, and the benefits of being able to read in the evening, watch <lb/>television, or charge a cell-phone will be interesting to follow. In the case of South Africa, the <lb/>national electrification plan is an integral part of a broader national development plan. Other <lb/>initiatives are in place to promote growth and job creation, such as through the development of <lb/>tourism. Electrifying a new area will open many doors to take advantage of the parallel government <lb/>initiatives to stimulate economic growth. These initiatives will have more success if they include <lb/>energy access in their overall objectives. <lb/>Comparative Study on Rural Electrification Policies in Emerging Economies – © OECD/IEA 2010 <lb/>Page | 99 <lb/>5 Conclusions and recommendations <lb/>The detailed country profiles for Brazil, China, India and South Africa shed light on the main issues <lb/>that arose as their governments shaped and implemented their rural electrification strategies. <lb/>These profiles have also served to show successful examples in overcoming major challenges. <lb/>The keys to the successful setting-up and implementation of rural electrification policies are drawn <lb/>from these profiles. Their aim is to encourage policy makers in developing countries who strive to <lb/>attain the same goals to take time during the electrification process to consider collaborating with <lb/>one another and within the various IEA energy technology Implementing Agreements or Working <lb/>Parties. <lb/>5.1 Preconditions to successful rural electrification measures <lb/>5.1.1 Sound statistical data to map out the populations&apos; geographical <lb/>distribution and electrification status <lb/>A prerequisite to any rural electrification policy is the collection of sound statistical data to map out <lb/>the electrification needs of a country. The shaping of the policy (including the choice of technologies <lb/>for electrification and deadlines) will greatly depend on the geographical distribution of the rural <lb/>population and of the existing grid, the density of this population and its level of electrification. <lb/>First, lack of information about the location of populations without access to electricity will cause <lb/>serious delays in the implementation of an electrification policy not to mention the risk of <lb/>overlooking small-scale infrastructures (isolated schools, health centres, etc.) or remote <lb/>communities unable to inform about their needs because of their geographical distance. Secondly, <lb/>the choice of the suitable technology for electrification can only be done efficiently when targets <lb/>are clearly defined, such as the expected use of electricity and particularly its productive use <lb/>5.1.2 Sustained government support and long-term commitment of <lb/>funds <lb/></body>

			<note place="footnote">All rural electrification policies detailed in this Information Paper have implied the full involvement <lb/>of the four countries&apos; central and local governments. The government support is essential to the <lb/>development of a successful rural electrification plan. India is a good example. In 2001, the central <lb/>government launched the &quot; Power for All by 2012 &quot; initiative, with all the electricity laws that <lb/>followed, paving the way for the effective implementation of rural electrification efforts in India, <lb/>after these efforts had slacked because of the State Electricity Boards&apos; financial problems. The <lb/>government of India, through laws and reforms which have shaped the country&apos;s institutional and <lb/>legal framework, and through the establishment of dedicated rural electrification institutions, has <lb/>opted for long-term planning, with centrally determined objectives and target years. Without firm <lb/>implementation policies and goals that can be enforced through legislation, the electrification <lb/>process will fall through. <lb/></note>

			<body>Page | 100 <lb/>A successful rural electrification programme needs long-term strategic planning and financial <lb/>resources for its implementation and for long-term maintenance and repairs. Before 2007, lack of <lb/>sufficient funds was the main reason for the slow implementation of rural electrification in India <lb/>during the 10 th Five-Year Plan. Moreover, if secure and dedicated funds are not available for the <lb/>longer term once the project is implemented, there will be financial losses and perhaps the de-<lb/>electrification of previously newly electrified villages. This has occurred in China, where &quot; system <lb/>integrators &quot; were responsible for the maintenance of their stand-alone systems for only three years <lb/>after installation. This resulted in some systems being abandoned because of lack of ownership and <lb/>funds for repairs and maintenance. Such funds need to be included in the electrification plan and <lb/>made available over a longer period, say 5 to 10 years after installation. Whether these funds are <lb/>provided through subsidies or through loans, governments should aim at the maximum level of <lb/>certainty concerning the long-term commitment. Available funds should be &quot; ring-fenced &quot; so that <lb/>there is no risk of having them misdirected to other government-led activities (GNESD, 2006). <lb/>5.1.3 Dedicated institutional structures and independence from political <lb/>agendas <lb/>The creation of transparent and dedicated institutions such as rural electrification agencies (or co-<lb/>ordinating agencies) and/or a rural electrification fund, largely autonomous and responsible for <lb/>implementing the country&apos;s rural electrification strategy, is strongly recommended (Barnes &amp; Foley, <lb/>2004). Such agencies ensure that funds are allocated directly to rural electrification and not <lb/>reallocated over time to various national priorities. Their apolitical nature should guarantee the <lb/>durability of efforts independently of any other political or social goal. They should also develop the <lb/>necessary standards and guidelines for the implementation of rural electrification programmes. For <lb/>example, the establishment of the Rural Electrification Board in India has proven to be an effective <lb/>means of furthering electrification efforts independently of political pressures. <lb/>In the same vein, it is also essential that rural electrification efforts remain independent from <lb/>politicians&apos; personal agendas. Not uncommon are cases where politicians, eager to gain their <lb/>constituents&apos; support for a renewed mandate, interfere with the electrification process. This has <lb/>occurred in Bangladesh, where one village, and no other, was provided with access to electricity for <lb/>the satisfaction of politicians&apos; agendas. The government of Bangladesh has also pledged to <lb/>construct new lines servicing areas in the constituencies (whose selection was not justified on <lb/>commercial grounds) of all Members of Parliament (Taniguchi &amp; Kaneko, 2009). The consequences <lb/>of such administrative corruption are well known, and hinder the development process. When <lb/>political pressures interfere with the distribution planning, they cause financial difficulties to the <lb/>utilities or distribution companies if they are forced to operate in a non-commercial manner or are <lb/>unable to cut the power supply to non-paying customers. For this reason, rural electrification <lb/>efforts should follow a predetermined, inviolable plan that involves a structured institutional <lb/>setting. An apolitical monitoring of how rural electrification progresses is recommended. This task <lb/>can be undertaken by independent institutions created or designated for that purpose. <lb/>5.1.4 Establishment of a strong market infrastructure to attract private <lb/>investors <lb/>Participation of the private sector is important when electrifying remote villages, particularly with <lb/>stand-alone systems. But for the private sector to participate, governments must ensure the <lb/></body>

			<body>Page | 101 <lb/>existence of a secure market infrastructure, as all electrification projects need to be viable in order <lb/>to be sustainable. And as the private sector&apos;s viability depends on profits, it will participate in the <lb/>electrification process only if money flows easily from customer to supplier. As a market in <lb/>transition, China has tried to encourage private-sector involvement in the electrification process of <lb/>rural areas through stand-alone systems (although the boundary between privately owned and <lb/>publicly owned enterprises is not always clear). In cases where revenues are too insecure to attract <lb/>the private sector, governments could grant subsidies to enterprises that wish to engage in rural <lb/>electrification programmes. Such policy however has had mixed results (Martinot et al., 2000) and <lb/>should only be a transitional incentive to encourage private engagement. <lb/>5.1.5 Related laws and/or regulations to be carried out alongside the <lb/>electrification process <lb/>First, measures including complementary economic development programmes, alongside the <lb/>provision of electricity in rural areas, should be introduced to foster business. These measures <lb/>should ensure that rural areas are governed by good rural markets and have access to credit <lb/>(Barnes, 2007). Without such complementary measures, business development initiated by the <lb/>electrification process is likely to slacken. Joint efforts with other ministries or development <lb/>agencies are therefore recommended to enhance the economic benefits of electrification, as Brazil <lb/>has done. Through its Territories of Citizenship Programme, a joint ministerial effort to promote <lb/>economic growth through territorial development, Brazil is in fact striving to improve the quality of <lb/>life of households in rural or poorer regions. <lb/>Secondly, in parallel to the electrification process, the implementation of energy efficiency policies <lb/>or measures is recommended. Energy efficiency measures such as the use of energy-saving <lb/>appliances, simple demand-side management measures, or energy conservation in buildings, <lb/>significantly reduce electricity demand. The Indian Bureau of Energy Efficiency (BEE) for example <lb/>has taken many energy conservation measures to control electricity consumption in parallel to the <lb/>country&apos;s electrification efforts. But this was not the case in South Africa, where energy efficiency <lb/>measures were launched only after the 2008 blackouts, during which it appeared that South Africa <lb/>could not meet its growing demand for electricity. In fact, during South Africa&apos;s electrification <lb/>efforts, energy efficiency measures were largely overlooked. The government, aware of the need <lb/>for energy efficiency measures, is now working to ensure that all houses comply with best-practice <lb/>energy efficiency standards. This late compliance, however, has had costs. <lb/>5.1.6 Electricity affordability <lb/>The issue of electricity affordability is recurrent in the context of rural electrification, as the target <lb/>groups are usually the rural poor. This said, rural households are usually very willing to pay for <lb/>access to energy services. When they do not have access to electricity, they often contribute much <lb/>of their time and revenue to buying or collecting energy sources for their day-to-day needs (Barnes, <lb/>2007). <lb/>The first hurdle is the connection. Initial payments for the connection are often high for the rural <lb/>poor. They may have enough to pay for the regular use of electricity but may not be able to afford <lb/>the connection fees. In such cases, any subsidised electricity is useless for them. When connections <lb/>are free of charge for the very poor, as in South Africa and India, this first problem is tackled. If <lb/></body>

			<page>Page | 102 <lb/></page>

			<body>funds are not available, spreading the connection costs over several years will enable larger <lb/>numbers of customers to be wired, while ensuring the costs are recovered over time by the utility. <lb/>The second hurdle is setting the tariff. There is no made-to-measure tariff and there is no good way <lb/>to set tariffs. Three points however need to be raised. First, there is a widespread belief that, to <lb/>benefit the rural poor, electricity needs to be sold at a very low price; facts often prove the <lb/>contrary. In reality, richer communities will benefit more than the poorer ones since they can afford <lb/>to buy electric appliances, which the very poor cannot. In addition, subsidies should be designed in <lb/>such a way that only the poorest segments of society benefit from them, and not the better-off <lb/>communities. Secondly, if the &quot; natural &quot; price is charged, the electricity supplier will be able to <lb/>effectively and sustainably supply electricity while making a profit that will ensure the sustainability <lb/>of the electrification process (Barnes &amp; Foley, 2004). Thirdly, rural households are often able to pay <lb/>for their electricity consumption. <lb/>Involving these communities in the tariff-setting process will secure better and more adequate tariff <lb/>systems. <lb/>5.1.7 Effective metering, billing and payment recovery <lb/>The effective recovery of customer payments allows electricity companies to supply reliable and <lb/>sustainable power. Lack of payment for electricity use not only weakens the financial stability of the <lb/>electricity provider (World Bank, 2000), but also discourages investors to join in on the rural <lb/>electrification efforts because of uncertain revenues. Adequate metering, billing and payment <lb/>recovery are fundamental to a sustainable electrification system. When meters do not function <lb/>correctly, are not properly read or billing is incorrect, then the customer&apos;s actual consumption will <lb/>not be paid for. Adding to these technical or organisational challenges is petty corruption at the <lb/>interface with customers, including bribes paid to or requested by meter readers. To tackle these <lb/>issues, measures such as the creation of franchisees (India), the part-time recruitment of farmers <lb/>for meter reading (China), or the use of prepaid meters (South Africa and Brazil) as well as stricter <lb/>management rules (such as random controls) all help to improve the recovery of customer <lb/>payment, a necessary condition for successful rural electrification efforts. <lb/>5.1.8 Full involvement of the rural community throughout the decision-<lb/>making process <lb/>Involving rural communities in the decision-making process has substantially contributed to the <lb/>effectiveness of these electrification programmes. One tends to believe that rural electrification is <lb/>the outcome of the sole efforts of governments (central, local or regional) and/or of international <lb/>development or funding agencies. But the involvement of rural communities in the process, <lb/>particularly their participation in decision-making committees, has added value to the planning <lb/>process and given the communities a sense of ownership of the process. Because of their intrinsic <lb/>characteristics, rural community workers have invaluable knowledge of their region&apos;s consumption <lb/>patterns, have authority to educate consumers in how to use electricity, can support the utilities in <lb/>encouraging customers to connect and in training in the use of energy efficiency measures, etc. <lb/>Both India and Brazil have taken this into account. India, acknowledging that most of the burden of <lb/>doing without electricity falls on women, has arranged for women to be represented in District <lb/>Committees, thereby helping in the co-ordination and control of electrification extensions within <lb/>their district. These committees also check the quality of power and consumer satisfaction, and <lb/></body>

			<body>promote energy efficiency measures. According to the government of India&apos;s statement, the <lb/> &quot; participation of women in meeting energy needs, especially electricity, is essential for effective, <lb/>efficient and sustainable implementation of rural electrification programs. &quot; Similarly, Brazil through <lb/>its Luz para Todos programme has ensured the involvement of rural communities in Management <lb/>Committees which work to prioritise activities within the electrification process. <lb/>5.2 Stand-alone systems: conditions for successful rural <lb/>electrification efforts <lb/>Different issues need to be addressed to secure the sustainability of the electrification process <lb/>through stand-alone systems. <lb/>5.2.1 Locally produced and resource-specific technologies for <lb/>electrification <lb/>If grid extension is not chosen to electrify a targeted region, then the choice of a stand-alone system <lb/>− whether small, mini or micro-hydro, PV systems, wind energy, hybrid systems, diesel generators, <lb/>etc. − will depend on many factors. No single technology is to be recommended. Aspects such as <lb/>the geographical dispersion of the local population, the community&apos;s estimated electricity needs <lb/>and ability to pay, availability of local resources, all factor into the decision-making process. Also, <lb/>long-term investment from the private sector depends on the climate profile of the territory; the <lb/>private sector will invest in the safest places as regards climate impacts and will favour climate <lb/>change-resilient regions. Therefore, decisions will be region-specific, resource-specific, technology-<lb/>specific (hydro plants in water-rich regions and PV systems in sunny regions, as is the case in China). <lb/>Rural electrification programmes will also favour locally-manufactured technologies to reduce <lb/>transportation or import costs. <lb/>5.2.2 Management and maintenance require adequate training, <lb/>guaranteed assistance structures and customer-supply chains <lb/>Once systems are installed and the electricity service is provided, it is important to make sure that <lb/>the rural communities – or the actors responsible – are sufficiently skilled to operate and maintain <lb/>the systems. Lack of any basic skills (including the ability to read the maintenance handbook) may <lb/>lead to the system being abandoned in case of malfunctioning. It is therefore essential that <lb/>adequate training be provided to the maintenance actor while the stand-alone system is being <lb/>installed. <lb/>Moreover, accessible guaranteed assistance structures in support of maintenance and repair should <lb/>be established at the outset of the electrification effort. It is recommended that the target <lb/>communities − or the responsible maintenance actors − be informed by the installer of how to <lb/>contact assistance structures. Without such assistance structures and guidelines, there is a risk that <lb/>the system be abandoned in the longer run. <lb/>Finally, just as clear assistance structures are a necessary condition for the sustainability of stand-<lb/>alone systems in remote areas, it is recommended that maintenance actors should be given clear <lb/></body>

			<page>Page | 104 <lb/></page>

			<body>guidelines as to where and how to obtain spare parts and maintenance materials. In addition, <lb/>governments should ensure that suppliers are committed to provide adequate after-sales services. <lb/>5.2.3 Sufficient long-term financing to ensure system maintenance <lb/>Financial provision should be made at the outset for the long-term maintenance of the systems. To <lb/>ensure projects&apos; sustainability, financial support (whether through loans, subsidies or other) should <lb/>be provided for the installation of stand-alone systems and long-term (5 to 10 year) annual <lb/>contracts for the maintenance and upgrading of the systems so as to prevent any system failure. In <lb/>addition, electricity supply can be partially directed towards the development of productive <lb/>activities to generate funds and so to cover the costs incurred by power supply, operation and <lb/>maintenance, particularly once the annual maintenance contract has come to an end. <lb/>5.2.4 Dealing with the misconception that stand-alone systems provide <lb/> &quot; second-class &quot; electricity <lb/>Electricity supplied through stand-alone systems is not to be regarded as &quot; second class &quot; provision, a <lb/>problem that is currently observed in South Africa. Appropriate information dissemination and good <lb/>performance of the stand-alone systems will do away with such issues as lack of ownership, and <lb/>long-term deterioration or abandonment of the systems will be avoided. Decision makers are to rely <lb/>on the members of the rural communities sitting in the various supporting committees to redress <lb/>this misconception within their communities. <lb/>5.3 Grid extension: conditions for successful rural <lb/>electrification efforts <lb/>5.3.1 Reducing transmission and distribution losses <lb/>Long transmission lines (when extending the grid to rural areas) are at risk of high transmission and <lb/>distribution (T&amp;D) losses. Line quality and the quality of transformers will also impact the efficiency <lb/>of T&amp;D. Regular maintenance and upgrading of power lines and transformers will significantly <lb/>reduce such losses. <lb/>5.3.2 Reducing losses from electricity theft <lb/>Electricity theft occurs through many different channels. Meters are tampered, or meter readers <lb/>are corrupt, billing is inadequate or non-existent, revenue is not collected or is not passed on to the <lb/>utility. Electricity theft can also take the form of illegal hookings (a small metal hook is slung to an <lb/>overhead power cable and then linked to a house through a cable) which are difficult to prevent or <lb/>control. All these losses add up and electricity companies are seriously weakened when their service <lb/>is not paid for. Although theft takes place just as often in urban centres as in rural areas, measures <lb/>to control and reduce electricity theft are more difficult to apply in rural areas. The introduction of <lb/>India&apos;s 2003 Electricity Act, a law in which theft is considered a criminal offence heavily penalised, <lb/>dissuades electricity thieves. Other means are the installation of high-voltage distribution systems <lb/></body>

			<body>Page | 105 <lb/>(HVDS) which are difficult to hook cables on to. In the case of stand-alone systems in China, PV <lb/>modules have in some instances been welded to the main structure to create additional hindrances <lb/>for potential thieves. In South Africa, Eskom, the national power utility, runs regular campaigns for <lb/>cable theft to be reported, and security patrols are used by both Eskom and municipalities to detect <lb/>and avert theft. <lb/>5.3.3 Use of low-cost technologies <lb/>Through the use of low-cost technologies such as single-wire earth return (SWER) as currently used <lb/>in South Africa for the electrification of rural households, costs of electrification remain controlled. <lb/>Other standards that allow for cost-effectiveness are the adequate location of transformers, which <lb/>could depend on current assessed and future electricity demand (GNESD, 2006). Such standards will <lb/>contribute to moderate electricity prices. <lb/>5.4 Three rural electrification boosters <lb/>5.4.1 Social fairness can be one of the initial driving motivators in the <lb/>first stages of electrification <lb/>A 2009 case study of Bangladesh showed that the total income gain following electrification <lb/>reached up to 30% (Khandker et al., 2009). But this was not the result of directing electricity to <lb/>productive end-uses. In fact electricity provision led to a significant improvement in total study time <lb/>for children in rural households coupled with an increase in the number of completed school years. <lb/>The income generated was shown to be sustainable over as long as 8 years. These encouraging <lb/>results are real incentives to target household electrification as a means of attaining social equity <lb/>which in the long run will lead to economic growth. Indeed, considering only the productive end-<lb/>uses of electricity as useful for development is obscuring the actual proven development capacity of <lb/>health services and education (Cabraal et al., 2005). This also may slow down the electrification <lb/>efforts. For this reason, social equity can be one of the initial driving motivators of electrification. <lb/>5.4.2 Minimising trial and error through benchmarking and exchange <lb/>with other countries <lb/>Though not all emerging economies face the same challenges when working to expand rural <lb/>electrification, many of the challenges are similar. Whether they live in Brazil, South Africa, China or <lb/>India, or any developing country, rural populations have the same main characteristics, namely they <lb/>are often dispersed, difficult to reach, have low electricity consumption needs and low capacity to <lb/>pay. In addition, countries face the same dual choice between grid extension and stand-alone <lb/>systems (whatever their size or energy source) and also the same questions regarding the means for <lb/>financing their electrification efforts (subsidies, loans, grants or other). Often institutional structures <lb/>or regulatory frameworks need to be introduced or strengthened to encourage investors or the <lb/>private sector to participate in the electrification scheme. Given the similarity of problems, it is <lb/>recommended that countries with active rural electrification policies benchmark their activities with <lb/>those of other countries at similar or more advanced stages. Such information exchange between <lb/></body>

			<page>Page | 106 <lb/></page>

			<body>countries with similar objectives should take place before and during the implementation of rural <lb/>electrification policies 52 to minimise trial and error. <lb/>5.4.3 Co-operation within IEA Implementing Agreements for exchange <lb/>on technologies and support on policy formulation <lb/>Finally, co-operation within the framework of the IEA Implementing Agreements (IA) will provide <lb/>support to countries seeking to develop their electrification policies. IAs are collaborative <lb/>programmes whose members 53 participate in some or all of the following activities: research <lb/>projects, programmes for information exchange, policy analysis, technology assessments, feasibility <lb/>studies, environmental impact studies, market analysis, and more. Benefits of collaborating with <lb/>other countries within these programmes are &quot; reduced cost and less duplication of work, greater <lb/>project scale, information sharing and networking, linkage between IEA member countries and non-<lb/>member countries of the IEA, linkage between research and industry, accelerated development and <lb/>deployment, harmonised technical standards, strengthened national RD&amp;D capabilities &quot; (IEA, 2007). <lb/>Members of these collaborative programmes are able to influence the direction of the work of the <lb/>IAs. It is thus recommended that countries wishing to engage in rural electrification efforts consider <lb/>participating in these IAs to learn from other countries and share their experience with other <lb/>country participants. 54 A list of the relevant IAs can be found in the proceedings of the 2008 <lb/>workshop on &quot; IEA Sustainable Rural Energisation in Major Emerging Economies &quot; <lb/>http://www.iea.org/textbase/work/workshopdetail.asp?WS_ID=379. <lb/></body>
