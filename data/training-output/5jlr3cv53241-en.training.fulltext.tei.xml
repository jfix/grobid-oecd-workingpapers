			<head>................................................................................ 33<lb/> BOOSTING INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE<lb/> By Andrés Fuentes Hutfilter, Andreas Kappeler, Dorothee Schneider and Giovanni Maria Semeraro 1<lb/> Policies to strengthen business and public investment can boost productivity and wellbeing<lb/></head>

			<p>1.<lb/> Business investment and public investment have weakened over time and this paper analyses<lb/> some driving forces. Investment is a key determinant of productivity, growth and well-being, but the<lb/> challenges in sustaining momentum have increased in recent years. Policies to eliminate barriers to the<lb/> development of knowledge-intensive services and the reallocation of resources would foster the transition<lb/> to a more dynamic economy. Stronger growth prospects in the Euro Area would also have benefits for<lb/> investment activity in Germany. As a key player in the Euro Area, Germany&apos;s support for collective action<lb/> to strengthen confidence in Euro Area growth is needed. Steps to identify and address public investment<lb/> priorities in Germany would also improve conditions for further business investment, and can make growth<lb/> more socially inclusive.<lb/></p>

			<head>Non-residential investment has weakened<lb/></head>

			<p>2.<lb/> The global financial and economic crisis depressed non-residential investment as it did in the<lb/> Euro Area or the United Kingdom (<ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>.). But in Germany, this has occurred despite a stronger<lb/> macroeconomic and financial recovery, high business profitability, strong balance sheets and higher rates<lb/> of capacity utilisation. Non-residential investment spending as a share of GDP is modest in international<lb/> comparison (<ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>.).<lb/> 3.<lb/> The share of business investment in value-added has fallen the most in business services, which<lb/> accounts for most of business investment (<ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>). German manufacturing firms have renewed their<lb/> capital stock more slowly than manufacturing firms in the UK and the US. This observation applies to a<lb/> broad range of subsectors (<ref type="biblio">Gornig and Schiersch, 2015</ref>).<lb/> 1.<lb/> Andrés Fuentes Hutfilter is a Senior Economist and Andreas Kappeler is an Economist in the Economics<lb/> Department of the OECD. Dorothee Schneider is Economist at the German Federal Ministry of Economic Affairs and<lb/> Energy and was seconded to the Economics Department of the OECD while preparing this paper.

			<p>4.<lb/> Lower spending on non-residential investment, in international comparison or over time, does not<lb/> necessarily imply less growth of the capital stock, as investment goods prices and depreciation rates of<lb/> installed capital may vary across countries and over time. In particular, prices for capital goods have fallen<lb/> markedly over the past 30 years. ICT investment has become more important and comprises hardware and<lb/> software that require frequent updating and replacement. In Germany, the contribution of the accumulation<lb/> of net non-residential fixed capital to productivity growth has diminished over the past 10 years (<ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>).<lb/> Among OECD economies, Germany is one of few where the growth contribution of non-residential<lb/> investment to productivity growth has been negative (OECD, 2015a). Non-residential construction capital<lb/> and information and communication (ICT) capital growth, notably in software and databases, have been<lb/> particularly weak in international comparison (<ref type="table">Table 1</ref>			<figure>.).<lb/> Figure 3.

			<p>5.<lb/> Weak non-residential investment could reflect substitution from traditional physical capital to<lb/> intangible forms of capital ( &quot; knowledge-based capital &quot; , KBC; Box 1). In many OECD countries,<lb/> investment in KBC has risen more strongly than investment in physical capital (<ref type="biblio">Andrews and<lb/> Criscuolo, 2013</ref>). While business expenditure in R&amp;D in Germany is relatively high compared to other<lb/> OECD countries, investment in KBC, which also includes spending on other intangible assets, is lower<lb/> than in leading high-income OECD economies and has grown little over time (<ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref>). Spending is low<lb/> on ICT-related KBC (software, databases), intellectual property, organisational capital and training.<lb/></p>

			<head>Box 1. Knowledge-based capital: Definition and measurement<lb/></head>

			<p>Knowledge-based capital (KBC) encompasses all assets that lack physical substance but, like physical capital,<lb/> generate economic benefits that can be retained by firms at least to some extent, for a period that exceeds one year<lb/> (OECD 2015h).<lb/> KBC is classified into the following three main categories, following <ref type="biblio">Corrado et al. (2009</ref>):<lb/></p>

			<p> Computerised information includes software and databases. This is already recorded as investment in the<lb/> national accounts as a part of gross fixed capital formation.<lb/></p>

			<p> Innovative property comprises research and development (R&amp;D) which is recorded in the national accounts<lb/> definition of investment, mineral exploration and artistic originals, new architectural and engineering designs<lb/> and new product development in financial services. Spending on the latter is estimated from the<lb/> compensation of high-skilled workers in the financial sector industry.<lb/></p>

			<p> Economic competencies comprise firms&apos; human and structural resources such as firm-specific training,<lb/> brand equity, and organisational capital. Investment in firm-specific human capital is estimated from firms&apos;<lb/> expenditure on training and education. Investment in brand equity is estimated from spending on advertising<lb/> and market research. Finally, organisational capital is estimated from managers&apos; compensation and the<lb/> gross output of the business and management consultancy industry. The estimation of organisational capital<lb/> involves particular uncertainty given that countries differ substantially in managers&apos; compensation systems<lb/> and the extent to which firms rely on external consultancy in their management decision.<lb/> Some KBC assets are included in the national accounts definition of investment, notably R&amp;D, software and<lb/> databases. Components of KBC that are not recorded in national accounts include investment in design, new financial<lb/> products, advertising, market research, training and organisational capital.<lb/> 6.<lb/> KBC is an important determinant of long-term productivity growth. It has been estimated to<lb/> account for one-fifth to one-third of labour productivity growth in the market sector of the US and EU<lb/> economies (<ref type="biblio">Andrews and Criscuolo, 2013, Corrado et al, 2013</ref>);.. Investment in knowledge capital boosts<lb/> productivity especially strongly in countries closer to the technology frontier, such as Germany. For<lb/> example, manufacturing firms that exhibit a higher level of software investment generate more patents per<lb/> R&amp;D dollar, and their investment in R&amp;D is more highly valued by equity markets (<ref type="biblio">Branstetter et al,<lb/> 2015</ref>). These also generate global productivity spillovers (<ref type="biblio">Dabla-Norris et al, 2015</ref>). Investment in several<lb/> KBC components, notably business processes or organizational structure ( &quot; organisational capital &quot; ), are<lb/> particularly important sources of productivity growth in many services (<ref type="biblio">Dabla-Norris et al, 2015</ref>).<lb/> Investments in KBC, notably in organisational capital also tend to boost the productivity of physical assets,<lb/> notably in ICT goods, thereby encouraging investment in such physical assets (<ref type="biblio">Andrews and Criscuolo,<lb/> 2013, Chen et al 2014, Bresnahan, Brynjolfsson and Hitt, 2002</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<head>Weaker demand is the main explanation of weaker business investment<lb/></head>

			<p>7.<lb/> Funding conditions are favourable for business investment. Indeed, profitability is historically<lb/> high. The retention of profits has resulted in continuously rising equity buffers (<ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref>). High levels of<lb/> retained profits are typically a strong boost to investment (<ref type="biblio">Schiantarelli, 1996</ref>). The outbreak of the Euro<lb/> Area sovereign debt crisis in 2010 turned Germany into a safe haven, driving long-term real interest rates<lb/> to historically low levels, below those in other Euro Area countries. The share of firms reporting<lb/> limitations in access to external funding remains historically low. The tax-induced cost of capital fell<lb/> significantly as corporate tax burdens were reduced in 2001 and 2008 (<ref type="biblio">Spengel et al, 2014</ref>). So it would<lb/> appear there&apos;s not a lack of funds, but rather a lack of appetite to commit these funds to investment<lb/> projects.<lb/></p>

			<p>8.<lb/> Weak demand growth can explain to a large extent why business investment has been weak<lb/> following the outbreak of the global financial and economic crisis, including in Germany (OECD, 2015a).<lb/> This weakness could have a lasting effect on the capital stock. Indeed, episodes of marked demand<lb/> weakness can have lasting effects on the capital stock when investment decisions are costly to reverse. For<lb/> example, firms may not reverse decisions to abandon markets after a period of weak demand (e.g. <ref type="biblio">Dixit,<lb/> 1992</ref>). Weak demand conditions in geographically close export markets, notably in the Euro Area, are<lb/> particularly important for domestic investment as these markets can best be served with domestic<lb/> production. This is confirmed by gravity models, which highlight the importance of geographic proximity<lb/> for trade (e.g. <ref type="biblio">Boulhol and de Serres, 2008</ref>). In addition, the long lasting reduction of economic activity in<lb/> European emerging markets weighs on investment intentions of German export oriented companies.<lb/> 9.<lb/> The shift in demand to more distant markets appears to have attracted investment by German<lb/> firms in these markets. According to a survey of German business leaders (<ref type="biblio">DIHK, 2015)</ref>, the share of<lb/> German industrial businesses intending to invest abroad has risen from 42 to 47% since 2008, especially in<lb/> East Asia and the United States, and they have raised the volume of their fixed investment abroad. Most<lb/> firms invest abroad to serve foreign demand better, and this share has increased considerably. According to<lb/> the same survey only 23% of firms invest abroad to benefit from lower costs. This share remains close to<lb/> historic lows. Weak investment in other Euro Area countries may also have weighed on investment in<lb/> Germany because of the geographic integration of value-added chains within the euro and the common<lb/> exploitation of the knowledge-based assets. Indeed, investment in multinational firms which integrated<lb/> through value-added chains makes investment across countries complementary to each other (OECD,<lb/> 2015a). Business investment has been particularly weak in Euro Area countries, including Germany, since<lb/> 2011, contrasting with the United States and European economies outside the Euro Area (<ref type="figure">Figure 7</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<figure>Figure 7. Business investment in euro area countries has grown little in recent years<lb/> 1.<lb/> Includes Denmark, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. They are weighted on the basis of investment spending in<lb/> 2011.<lb/></figure>

			<p>10.<lb/> Uncertainty exacerbates the impact of weak demand on investment. It gives agents an incentive<lb/> to postpone or cancel their investment decisions. In particular, new investment decisions will be the lower<lb/> the stronger the downside tail risks are (OECD, 2015e, <ref type="biblio">Dixit and Pindyck, 1994</ref>). A recently developed<lb/> news-based index of policy-induced uncertainty rose strongly between 2010 and 2012, especially in<lb/> European economies, including in Germany, with the eruption of the Euro Area debt crisis (<ref type="figure">Figure 8</ref>). This<lb/> suggests that Euro Area developments have been an important driver of increased uncertainty. Higher<lb/> uncertainty, as measured by this index, has been estimated to have lowered investment across OECD<lb/> countries (OECD, 2015a), even though the index does not provide a precise measure of uncertainty. A<lb/> substantial effect of policy uncertainty on investment has been estimated for Germany (Federal Ministry<lb/> for Economic Affairs and <ref type="biblio">Energy, 2013</ref>), even after controlling for the effect of general business<lb/> confidence. Policy uncertainty in Germany can explain the weakening of investment in 2012. However, the<lb/> German production of investment goods is used as a proxy for investment, which may also capture the<lb/> response of foreign investment on uncertainty. A study by the association of German cooperative banks<lb/> (<ref type="biblio">BVDR, 2013</ref>) concludes that the increase in uncertainty in 2011 lowered equipment investment in<lb/> Germany by 4-6%. Estimates by <ref type="biblio">Deutsche Bundesbank, 2016</ref>) suggest that uncertainty may have lowered<lb/> investment in Germany after the outbreak of the global financial and economic crisis in 2009 and after the<lb/> outbreak of the Euro Area debt crisis in 2012 and 2013. Since 2007, German non-financial businesses have<lb/> raised equity buffers, liquid financial assets and stocks, whereas they have reduced fixed assets and short-<lb/>term financial liabilities (<ref type="biblio">Hüther, 2014</ref>). This observed increase in liquidity raises flexibility and makes<lb/> companies more resistant to shocks as well as more independent from external financing.<lb/></p>

			<head>European-wide efforts to bolster growth would also strengthen investment in Germany<lb/></head>

			<p>11.<lb/> Policies that strengthen stability and growth prospects in the Euro Area would raise the<lb/> attractiveness of Germany as a location to invest. Germany should therefore continue to support efforts to<lb/> improve growth prospects in the Euro Area, notably steps to strengthen the single market and cross-border<lb/> infrastructure, and complete the banking union. These steps will strengthen long-term growth, reduce the<lb/> risk of financial crises, and strengthen crisis management. Contagion, triggered by capital outflows, played<lb/> a major role in propagating uncertainty within the Euro Area (<ref type="biblio">de Grauwe, 2013</ref>). To reduce the scope of<lb/> such contagion effects, currency areas have developed institutions which provide emergency liquidity<lb/> support. Germany will benefit from a further deepening of the banking union in the Euro Area through a<lb/> reduction in uncertainty, which will help to support demand, and in particular business investment.<lb/></p>

			<p>2.<lb/> Average of ten European newspapers from France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom.<lb/> Source: Economic Policy Uncertainty (www.policyuncertainty.com).<lb/> 12.<lb/> Weak demand growth cannot fully explain why investment spending is especially low in<lb/> Germany. Recent empirical research suggests that cross-country differences in cyclical positions, as well as<lb/> in structural features, including employment, demography and the sectoral structure, do not appear to<lb/> explain why investment in Germany is relatively low (DIW, HRI, 2014). These findings suggest that there<lb/> is scope for improved structural policies to boost investment in Germany. The following sections examine<lb/> several key areas.<lb/> 13.<lb/> Econometric and case study evidence indicates that the relative utilization of more-skilled<lb/> workers is positively correlated with capital intensity and the implementation of new technologies at the<lb/> firm and industry level. Such complementarity seems to be particularly marked for ICT investment and<lb/> with respect to cognitive and soft skills. Increased computer intensity is associated with increased<lb/> employment shares of managers, professionals and other highly educated workers (<ref type="biblio">Katz and Autor, 1999</ref>).<lb/> The supply of new skills through the entry of young workers to the labour market is diminishing as a result<lb/> of population ageing, making life-long learning a key instrument to improve skills. This is discussed in<lb/> OECD (2016).<lb/></p>

			<head>Removing barriers to competition strengthens investment<lb/></head>

			<p>14.<lb/> Relaxing product market regulation which harms competition or market entry stimulates business<lb/> investment and innovation and thereby productivity. More intense competition encourages the adoption of<lb/> improved management practices and related investment in KBC (notably organisational capital). Such<lb/> improvements raise the productivity of physical capital, notably in ICT, which encourages ICT investment.<lb/> The resulting productivity gains are substantial (<ref type="biblio">Bloom et al, 2012</ref>). Regulation restricting entry also<lb/> damps investment in physical capital (IWU, 2015; <ref type="biblio">Alesina et al., 2005; Nicoletti and Scarpetta, 2005</ref>).<lb/> While Germany has made much progress in reforming product market regulation in general over the past<lb/> 15 years, regulation in some services remains restrictive, especially the professional services and in some<lb/> network industries (<ref type="figure">Figure 9</ref>; see also the 2014 Economic Survey of Germany, OECD, 2014c). As argued<lb/> below, since these services are used as intermediate services, regulatory reform in these sectors has<lb/> important benefits for productivity and investment throughout the economy.<lb/></p>

			<figure>Figure 9. Product market regulation remains restrictive in professional services<lb/> Index scale from 0 to 6, from least to most restrictive<lb/> 1.<lb/> Average of all OECD countries excluding the United States.

			<head>Removing barriers to competition in the services<lb/></head>

			<p>15.<lb/> The potential for regulatory reform to raise productivity performance in the services is<lb/> particularly large. While most countries have experienced substantial productivity catch-up in agriculture<lb/> and manufacturing relative to the United States, productivity differences in most services across countries<lb/> have remained high. Productivity gaps in the services are also particularly large at the firm level,<lb/> suggesting that there is much scope to raise productivity through the diffusion of knowledge. Investment in<lb/> knowledge-based capital plays a key role in the diffusion process (OECD, 2015a). In Germany, the<lb/> productivity gap between manufacturing and services is particularly large (<ref type="figure">Figure 10</ref>). Productivity growth<lb/> over the past 15 years has been low, also in international comparison (Economic Survey of Germany 2014,<lb/> OECD, 2014a). Investment in non-tangibles (e.g., business processes, organizational structure) are<lb/> particularly important sources of productivity growth in many services (<ref type="biblio">Dabla-Norris et al, 2015</ref>). In<lb/> Germany in the weakness in KBC spending may be attributed to the services (<ref type="figure">Figure 11</ref>). In a study<lb/> comparing 7 European economies, the contribution of investment in KBC to services productivity growth<lb/> has been estimated to be substantially weaker in Germany than in the United Kingdom, The Netherlands,<lb/> France and Austria, outperforming only Spain and Italy (<ref type="biblio">Corrado et al, 2014</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<p>16.<lb/> Services contribute 70% to economy-wide value-added in Germany and are important<lb/> intermediate inputs to other sectors, including for manufacturing. The domestic services content of<lb/> economies&apos; gross exports has risen over time, underscoring the importance of open and efficient markets<lb/> for services for participation in global value-added chains. Global production networks rely on business<lb/> services to move goods and coordinate production along the value chain (<ref type="biblio">Gornig and Schiersch, 2015</ref>).The<lb/> purchases of intermediate services by industrial firms amount to about 12% of GDP. More productive and<lb/> innovative services raise productivity in downstream sectors. In export-oriented industries, the value of<lb/> services inputs relative to their value-added is particularly high. In chemicals (including pharmaceuticals),<lb/> for example, it amounts to 43% (IWU, 2015). Intermediate service inputs also facilitate the diffusion of<lb/> new technologies. Technology-intensive firms benefit the most from strengthening competition by<lb/> reforming the regulation of business services (OECD, 2015a).<lb/></p>

			<figure>Figure 11. Investment in knowledge-based capital is low in the services<lb/> Percentage of activity-specific value added, 2010<lb/> Source: INTAN-Invest (www.intan-invest.net).<lb/></figure>

			<p>17.<lb/> Professional services and network industry services play particularly important roles as<lb/> intermediate inputs. Close to 100% of the services produced by lawyers and notaries, building engineers<lb/> and architects in Germany are used in downstream sectors. In telecommunications, this share is 50%. The<lb/> purchases of legal services and services of building engineers and architects by manufacturing firms<lb/> amounted to close to 10% of their value added in 2010 (IWU, 2015). Past efforts to reduce barriers to<lb/> competition in the professional services regulation have had important benefits for value added the<lb/> economy as a whole (<ref type="biblio">IWU, 2015</ref>), in particular for manufacturing. Making regulation as competition-<lb/>friendly to one of the best-performing OECD country in this regard (the United Kingdom) suggests that<lb/> productivity throughout the German economy could rise by 2%, and in manufacturing, by 2.3% (<ref type="biblio">IWU,<lb/> 2015</ref>). These productivity gains would be facilitated by stronger investment, including in KBC.<lb/> 18.<lb/> Germany ranks 25 th of 33 countries in the OECD&apos;s index of regulation in the professional<lb/> services (see the 2014 Economic Survey, OECD, 2014a, for more detail). Some of the most protected<lb/> professional services also report among the highest shares of profits relative to turnover, well above the<lb/> economy-wide average (<ref type="biblio">IWU, 2015</ref>). This reflects entry barriers and conduct regulation. The 2014<lb/> Economic Survey (OECD, 2014c) contains an extensive analysis of regulation that is harmful to<lb/> competition and economic activity. In particular there are binding price regulations for notaries, architects<lb/> and building engineers and lawyers (for legal representation in court). Notaries benefit from particularly<lb/> extensive exclusivity rules. For example, notaries have the exclusive right for legal transactions involving<lb/> the creation of a new business. This includes in particular the founding agreement. Shareholder<lb/> requirements in some professional services require that the certified professionals themselves must be<lb/> majority owners in their businesses. Advertising is restricted in some professional services. The limitations<lb/> on shareholding and the restrictions on cooperation between different professions limit economies of scale<lb/> and scope, which are a key driver for investment in KBC.<lb/> 19.<lb/> More competition-friendly regulation of the network industries would also have important<lb/> benefits for productivity and investment throughout the economy. For telecommunications, the 2014<lb/> Survey pointed to the large potential for productivity gains in services and manufacturing that lies in<lb/> breaking up exclusive rights of issuing SIM cards, which remains restricted to holders of mobile telephony<lb/> spectrum. In postal services, incumbent and competitors need to be put on a level playing field with respect<lb/> to VAT. In railway services, the implementation of an EU directive will strengthen the incumbent&apos;s<lb/> incentives to reduce infrastructure costs and broadens the range of infrastructure on which the regulator can<lb/> determine access conditions. Nonetheless, limited investigative powers of the regulator, for example in<lb/> market surveillance, continue to limit scope to prevent discrimination of market entrants (OECD, 2014a).<lb/> Divesting government ownership in services which are subject to competition in all these industries would<lb/> also boost market entry.<lb/> 20.<lb/> In 41 crafts professions, including in the construction industry (painters, plasters, bricklayers,<lb/> scaffolders and installation of heating and cooling installations) and in some services (e.g. hairdressing)<lb/> self-employment is restricted to holders of tertiary level vocational degrees. Alternatively, workers in these<lb/> professions can open a business with a minimum work experience of six years, four of them in a managing<lb/> position, in addition to the vocational education degree at the upper secondary level required to exercise<lb/> the profession. These requirements raise entry barriers for self-employment. Self-regulation by sector-<lb/>specific business chambers, notably in the professional services and the crafts, also risks protecting<lb/> incumbents.<lb/></p>

			<head>Fostering the reallocation of resources strengthens productivity in investment in knowledge-based<lb/> capital<lb/></head>

			<p>The gains in value that can be obtained from KBC gives rise to increasing returns to scale which<lb/> makes KBC an engine of long-term growth. This is because the initial cost incurred in deploying KBC<lb/> does not increase as it is combined with increasing amounts of other inputs (labour, capital) in the<lb/> production of goods or services. The returns of KBC can best be exploited if other production inputs<lb/> (capital, labour) are reallocated to the most productive use. For example, KBC is significantly more<lb/> productive in sectors in which ICT capital is deployed intensively. Firms which invest in management (one<lb/> component of KBC) also tend to undertake more physical investment (<ref type="biblio">Andrews and Criscuolo, 2013, Chen<lb/> et al 2014</ref>). To exploit the potential of KBC, barriers to the reallocation of resources must be reduced. The<lb/> cross-country differences in KBC reflect the fact that some countries are more successful at reallocating<lb/> resources to underpin the growth of firms that invest in KBC (OECD, 2015a).<lb/></p>

			<head>Preventing incumbent bias in policy making<lb/></head>

			<p>21.<lb/> Policies to avoid that incumbents&apos; interests disproportionately affect the design of regulation can<lb/> also improve reallocation, thereby raising innovation and productivity. Germany has made significant<lb/> improvements to its regulatory policy system over the last years, introducing systematic ex-post evaluation<lb/> of regulations in 2013. Nonetheless, the capacity of the administration should focus more strongly on the<lb/> analysis of the economy-wide impacts of policies, rather than on sector-specific impacts. Germany could<lb/> benefit from an independent standing capacity to regularly undertake comprehensive in-depth reviews of<lb/> policy areas to inform large scale regulatory reforms (OECD, 2015j). In the Netherlands, for example, the<lb/> Bureau for Economic Policy Analysis conducts analysis of economy-wide impacts of regulation for the<lb/> government. In Australia, such analysis is conducted by the productivity commission.<lb/> 22.<lb/> Germany can also do more to raise transparency of lobbyists&apos; involvement in public decision<lb/> processes. Transparency in lobbying is important to avoid partial policy decisions by forcing policy-<lb/>makers to filter out self-interested arguments and allowing the public to take a well-informed view on<lb/> decision-making (OECD, 2014b).<lb/> 23.<lb/> Germany discloses the contributions of lobbying in parliamentary consultations and has moved<lb/> ahead of other OECD countries by creating a public list of associations representing interests vis-à-vis the<lb/> federal parliament (Bundestag) or the federal government that is kept by the President of the Bundestag.<lb/> This list allows stakeholders to easily access disclosed information on lobbying which also involves the<lb/> executive branch of government. However, unlike other OECD countries which have created a lobbying<lb/> register, the information it provides in Germany is limited. (OECD, 2014b, Transparency International,<lb/> 2015). Some information, such as the lobbyist&apos;s employer, the potential beneficiary of the lobbying<lb/> activity, the government action targeted by the lobbying (such as a legislative proposal), the government<lb/> department contacted by the lobbyist, government funding received or contributions made to political<lb/> campaigns, is not provided. Indeed, results from the OECD 2013 Survey on lobbying showed that<lb/> legislators and lobbyists across OECD countries consider such information to be important to raise<lb/> transparency (OECD, 2014b). Two proven transparency tools in Germany are the Freedom of Information<lb/> Act and the constitutional right of every single member of parliament to put questions to the government.<lb/> More information provided by the lobbying register could be an additional tool to strengthen transparency.<lb/> Steps could also be taken to improve access to information about views taken in advisory and expert<lb/> groups (<ref type="biblio">Transparency International, 2015</ref>). An online electronic filing system would reduce the<lb/> administrative burden that would result from such steps to improve transparency and public scrutiny<lb/> (OECD, 2014b).<lb/> 24.<lb/> Extensive government ownership in some business sectors risks hampering the reallocation of<lb/> resources to more productive sectors or firms. For instance, publicly owned commercial banks have a<lb/> market share of more than 40% in Germany. As the 2014 Economic Survey (OECD, 2014c) pointed out,<lb/> the regional Landesbanken, which are mostly owned by Länder governments, have had a poor track record<lb/> in the efficient allocation of credit, technical efficiency and vulnerability to solvency risk. They have<lb/> provided lending to support established industries in their respective regions, which in some cases has<lb/> added to financial risks and can slow the reallocation of resources to new more productive activities.<lb/> Progress with privatisation is slow, as Länder governments are planning to privatise only 1 of<lb/> 7 Landesbanken. Reflecting stricter risk management standards, governance has improved also in the<lb/> Landesbanken, but specific governance problems for the Landesbanken resulting from regional<lb/> government ownership are likely to remain (Economic Survey of Germany 2014, OECD 2014a). Further<lb/> privatisation would be welcome. Steps to further improve governance might be an alternative option.<lb/> Since the outbreak of the global financial crisis, the federal government has also kept a minority share in<lb/> one of the large private, commercial banks.<lb/> 25.<lb/> A regional government also owns just above 20% of one of the biggest car manufacturers.<lb/> Moreover, a specific law regarding Volkswagen stipulates that key business decisions require a majority of<lb/> at least 80%, which effectively gives veto power to the regional government. The federal government also<lb/> owns substantial shares in network industry incumbents, notably in telecommunications and postal<lb/> services. Privatising these shares would help remove perceptions of conflicts of interest between the<lb/> government&apos;s role as owner of these businesses and its role as the regulator of the relevant markets,<lb/> boosting market entry, competition and investment.<lb/></p>

			<head>Fostering mobility of workers<lb/></head>

			<p>26.<lb/> In several ways framework conditions are supportive for geographic mobility. A well-developed<lb/> private, rental housing market covering about 50% of households (one of the largest shares in the OECD)<lb/> supports worker mobility (<ref type="biblio">Dohmen, 2005</ref>). Rental regulation appears to strike a successful balance<lb/> between the protection of tenants, owners&apos; rights, and responsiveness to market developments, making<lb/> rented housing attractive for owners and tenants alike (<ref type="biblio">de Boer and Bitetti, 2014</ref>). Residential investment is<lb/> high (<ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref> above) and is generally responsive to changes in demand (<ref type="biblio">Andrews et al, 2011</ref>). In view of<lb/> particularly strong increase in the demand for housing in the context of the refugee inflow the government<lb/> is also planning to provide tax subsidies for investment in low-cost housing.<lb/> 27.<lb/> The government has recently decided to tighten rental regulation, to give powers to local<lb/> authorities to limit rent increases on newly rented housing in those geographic areas where rent increases<lb/> ECO/WKP(2016)50<lb/> 20<lb/> have been particularly large. This could in principle limit the supply of housing and thereby reduce<lb/> mobility to regions with attractive jobs and high housing demand. However, the impact is likely to be<lb/> small, provided the measures are applied to urban centers, where the supply is price-inelastic, and newly<lb/> built housing is exempt from the new rules. However, generally speaking, restrictive housing regulation<lb/> discourages mobility (OECD, 2015a).<lb/> 28.<lb/> High housing transaction costs raise the costs of mobility for owner-occupiers. In Germany, these<lb/> transaction costs amount to around 7% of the value, more than in most OECD countries (<ref type="biblio">Andrews et al,<lb/> 2011</ref>), impairing mobility for owner-occupiers. Housing transaction taxes account for more than half of<lb/> these costs. High costs of notary services further add to these transaction costs (see above).<lb/> 29.<lb/> Conditions are less favourable for worker mobility across jobs and firms. Stringent employment<lb/> protection legislation (EPL) is associated with lower rates of job reallocation (<ref type="biblio">Davis and Haltiwanger,<lb/> 2014</ref>). It raises the cost of business failure, making it less attractive for firms to experiment with uncertain<lb/> technologies. Seniority-based compensation for dismissal also affects voluntary job-to-job movements, as<lb/> a worker who moves to another firm loses cumulated compensation rights. Compensation for unfair<lb/> dismissal in Germany rises strongly with seniority, reaching 18 months of salary for a worker with<lb/> 20 years of tenure compared with an OECD average of 12 months. The notice period for workers with long<lb/> tenure is fairly long; for example, 7 months for workers with 20 years of tenure, compared with an OECD<lb/> average of 3 months. As argued in previous Economic Surveys (OECD, 2010a) legal costs associated to<lb/> employment protection legislation could be reduced by giving employers the right to choose between<lb/> paying a severance payment or paying a higher unfair dismissal compensation which would replace the<lb/> court route. The relatively strict stance of employment protection in Germany has a particularly strong<lb/> negative impact on productivity in those sectors in which worker turnover is high (<ref type="biblio">Andrews et al, 2015</ref>).<lb/> However, seniority-based employment protection may be part of an institutional framework which has<lb/> supported a cumulative innovation processes in manufacturing sectors (<ref type="biblio">Fuentes et al, 2004</ref>), in which<lb/> Germany has a long-standing comparative advantage and which have contributed to Germany&apos;s strong<lb/> export performance. The vocational education system, with its emphasis on on-the-job training and the<lb/> accumulation of firm-specific skills is part of this framework. Long-term relationships between employers<lb/> and workers support the accumulation of firm-specific skills. Reducing the legal costs associated to<lb/> employment protection would be one way to facilitate worker mobility without undermining the<lb/> institutional framework.<lb/></p>

			<head>Fostering the reallocation of capital across firms and improving framework conditions for start-ups<lb/></head>

			<p>30.<lb/> Successful innovative start-ups depend on the reallocation of resources, which is key to foster<lb/> KBC. Firms that drive one technological wave often fail to continue to do so in the subsequent one, as they<lb/> then tend to concentrate on incremental improvements, and young firms possess a comparative advantage<lb/> in commercialising radical innovations (OECD, 2015a).<lb/> 31.<lb/> Bankruptcy regulation, which limits the costs of firm closure and safeguards opportunities for a<lb/> fresh start, is an important instrument to ensure reallocation of resources (OECD, 2015a). Reform of<lb/> bankruptcy legislation, most recently in 2012, reduced the stay period after which bankrupt entrepreneurs<lb/> are cleared from remaining debt ( &quot; fresh start &quot; ) from 6 to 3 years, if they are able to pay at least 25% of<lb/> their outstanding liabilities, and to 5 years if they are able to reimburse the procedural costs. Bankruptcy<lb/> procedures are shorter and appear to be more efficient than in most OECD countries (OECD, 2013a).<lb/> Regulatory requirements for creating a new corporation have been lowered and one-stop shops have<lb/> reduced administrative costs. Accounting and statistical requirements on small businesses have been<lb/> lowered. However, restrictive regulation of notaries&apos; services still contributes to excessive costs for the<lb/> legal transactions required to create a new firm (see above).<lb/> 32.<lb/> Entrepreneurship still suffers from lacking simplification of administrative procedures<lb/> (<ref type="figure">Figure 12</ref>). The &quot; silence is consent &quot; principle is not generally applied in the issuance of licences. Stronger<lb/> development of e-governance could also help reduce administrative costs (see below). Entrepreneurs also<lb/> do not generally have access to low-cost public health insurance (OECD, 2014a), which may deter<lb/> entrepreneurship, especially when income risks are substantial. Entrepreneurs may have to pay relatively<lb/> high fees for private insurance, which are independent of their income level, and so may be difficult to pay<lb/> for when income drops.<lb/></p>

			<figure>Figure 12. Complexity of regulatory procedures contributes to barriers to entrepreneurship<lb/> Index scale from 0 to 6, from least to most restrictive, 2013<lb/> 1.<lb/> Average of all OECD countries excluding the United States.<lb/> Source: OECD (2015), OECD Product Market Regulation Database.<lb/></figure>

			<p>33.<lb/> Initial public offerings in stock markets are key instruments to make equity capital available to<lb/> start-up firms with strong growth potential. Across many OECD countries, initial public offerings have<lb/> declined, notably of small firms (<ref type="biblio">Isaksson and Çelik, 2013</ref>) and particularly so in Germany. This decline<lb/> started before the global financial crisis. It has occurred in the context of important changes in the<lb/> governance and operation of stock markets, which have become for-profit institutions, and the increasing<lb/> importance of high-frequency trading in generating profits for stock market operators. While the causes for<lb/> the decline in initial public offerings are not yet well-understood, declining spreads between bid and ask<lb/> stock prices for small firms have reduced profit margins for market making activities, which help channel<lb/> information about new firms in the stock market to market participants. Regulatory changes which have<lb/> reduced the interval at which stock prices have quoted ( &quot; tick size &quot; ) appear to have played a role in<lb/> reducing initial public offerings.<lb/></p>

			<head>Tax regulation hampers the reallocation of capital to most productive use<lb/></head>

			<p>34.<lb/> Inheritance tax exemptions with respect to family firms lock in capital in these firms, harming<lb/> reallocation. Moreover, managerial quality in these firms tends to be lower than in other firms. Reducing<lb/> such exemptions could therefore raise aggregate productivity and improve intergenerational social mobility<lb/> (<ref type="biblio">Andrews and Westmore, 2014</ref>). Inheritance tax exemptions could also create barriers for firm growth, as<lb/> capital raised through the stock market, for example, would not benefit from the exemptions. Growth of<lb/> small firms with high potential is a key driver of productivity growth (OECD, 2015a). Reforms to remove<lb/> these exemptions have been held back by concerns that this would raise firm liquidations. As<lb/> recommended in previous Economic Surveys steps to give more time for family-owned businesses to pay<lb/> inheritance tax liabilities and to treat the inheritance tax liability as subordinate debt in the balance sheet<lb/> can help deal with any liquidity problems that could result from capital market frictions (OECD, 2003,<lb/> 2014a). Removing inheritance tax exemptions would strengthen the inclusiveness of the German tax<lb/> system, in view of the strong concentration of wealth, as argued in the 2014 Economic Survey (OECD,<lb/> 2014c). The 2014 Survey also argued that the inheritance tax has particularly low economic efficiency and<lb/> administrative costs. The government and parliament are considering reform of inheritance taxation.<lb/> 35.<lb/> The tax treatment of venture capital and of workers in the venture capital industry is in some<lb/> respects less favourable than in other European countries (FISI, 2012). Venture capital is an important<lb/> instrument to finance growth of start-up firms. Much less venture capital is made available to entrepreneurs<lb/> in Germany than in leading OECD economies (OECD, 2015a). Tax provisions which reduce the carrying<lb/> forward of losses when a business is sold may be particularly harmful for the provision of venture capital,<lb/> as start-ups often generate losses in their early years and the sale of shares by venture capitalists to a<lb/> broader set of financial investors often serves to finance the growth of start-up firms. However, the<lb/> limitations to the carrying-forward of losses have been effective in limiting tax avoidance through base<lb/> evasion and profit shifting of multinational enterprises.<lb/> 36.<lb/> As in many OECD countries, taxation of business profits generates a bias towards debt financing<lb/> of investment because interest payments can be deducted from taxable profits. By contrast, dividends are<lb/> exempt from tax. This tax advantage for debt financing of businesses is reduced by several rules. Germany<lb/> limits the deductibility of interest from the corporate tax base to 30% of profits. However, amounts<lb/> exceeding these limits can be carried forward, so these limits are not usually binding and are mainly<lb/> targeted at reducing tax avoidance by multinational enterprises (German Council of Economic Experts,<lb/> 2015). Interest expenditure is included in the base of the local business tax (Gewerbesteuer) and capital<lb/> gains are subject to lower tax rates.<lb/> 37.<lb/> While equity buffers have risen strongly in the German non-financial business sector (see above)<lb/> debt bias in business profit taxation could be harmful for the financing investment in KBC in particular, as<lb/> typically physical assets can be used as collateral for loans, but not intangible assets. Debt bias may damp<lb/> firm creation, as newly created firms need equity. Overcoming this bias could therefore help firms with<lb/> growth potential to expand (OECD, 2015a). Introducing a tax allowance for the opportunity cost of equity<lb/> (ACE) could be one way of further reducing the tax bias in favour of debt-financed investment. Model<lb/> simulations presented by the German Council of Economic Experts suggest that a tax allowance for equity<lb/> could raise the capital stock by 5.5%, even if such an allowance were introduced in revenue-neutral terms<lb/> (Council of <ref type="biblio">Economic Experts, 2015</ref>). However, further research on the debt-equity bias itself and on the<lb/> effectiveness of an ACE in removing this bias is still needed. Several issues need to be addressed for<lb/> implementing an ACE tax system, including minimising tax revenue loss and evasion including through<lb/> base erosion and profit shifting of multinational firms or windfall profits (FSB, 2015).The empirical<lb/> evidence on the impact of the introduction of an ACE for corporations in Belgium is conflicting (<ref type="biblio">Princen,<lb/> 2012, aus dem Moore, 2014</ref>).<lb/> 38.<lb/> Reductions in the taxation of business profits along the lines discussed above would have costs in<lb/> terms of inclusiveness of the tax system and foregone tax revenue. These effects could be offset by<lb/> including households&apos; interest income, dividends and capital gains in the taxation of personal income. This<lb/> income is currently taxed at a flat tax rate, which is in most cases lower than the personal income tax rate.<lb/> Taxing such income at the household level at a higher rate would have little impact on investment, as<lb/> international capital mobility separates saving from investment decisions. Indeed the taxation of household<lb/> dividend income appears not to reduce investment. It also appears not to reduce the efficiency of<lb/> investment decisions. This evidence is robust (<ref type="biblio">Yagan, 2015</ref>). Improved international cooperation of tax<lb/> administrations also mitigates concern that the elimination of these tax exemptions could lead to tax<lb/> evasion through capital flight. Eliminating such exemptions strengthens the inclusiveness of tax systems<lb/> substantially, as such income concentrated in top income households (<ref type="biblio">Joumard et al, 2012</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<head>Improving the roll-out of high-speed broadband infrastructure<lb/></head>

			<p>39.<lb/> Fast broadband boosts productivity growth substantially (<ref type="biblio">Czernich et al, 2011</ref>). For example, a 10<lb/> percentage point increase in broadband penetration raised annual per capita GDP growth by 0.9–<lb/> 1.5 percentage points between 1995 and 2007 including through fostering investment to exploit<lb/> opportunities generated by the infrastructure, in particular, investment in ICT, such as software (<ref type="biblio">Egert et al,<lb/> 2009</ref>). High-speed internet is important for spurring internet-related services as well as for technological<lb/> advances in manufacturing, notably through machine-to-machine communication (OECD, 2014c).<lb/> Moreover, broadband access also improves ICT skills, and, because of the complementarity of skills and<lb/> fixed assets, investment in ICT capital (<ref type="biblio">Falck and Wiederhold, 2015</ref>).<lb/> 40.<lb/> In Germany wired broadband has been rolled out less than in leading OECD economies and<lb/> technologies which supply the fastest speeds, notably fibre ( &quot; fibre to the home &quot; , FTTH), have barely been<lb/> deployed (<ref type="figure">Figure 13</ref>). This reflects the decision of the incumbent operator not to invest in FTTH und<lb/> upgrade its existing copper network instead at much lower cost, but providing lower speeds than fibre.<lb/> Prices for high-speed fibre-based broadband services (100Mbit per second or more), are high according to<lb/> OECD statistics (OECD 2014c). There are scale economies in the deployment of high-speed fibre<lb/> networks (OECD, 2014c). This creates a case for providing government support for the roll-out these<lb/> networks.<lb/></p>

			<figure>ECO/WKP(2016)50<lb/> Figure 13. Rollout of broadband by type of technology<lb/> Fixed broadband subscriptions per 100 inhabitants, December 2014<lb/> 1.<lb/> Estimates for Israel, Switzerland and the United States. Preliminary data for Mexico.<lb/></figure>

			<head>Source: OECD (2015), OECD Science, Technology and Industry Scoreboard 2015: Innovation for growth and society.<lb/></head>

			<p>41.<lb/> The federal government plans to spend 2.7 billion Euros (0.1% of annual GDP) over three years<lb/> to subsidise broadband deployment in order to ensure broadband speeds of 50Mbit per second. These<lb/> subsidies are allocated through competitive tender. However, the federal government&apos;s support is not<lb/> targeted to the roll-out fibre networks, which ensures the highest speeds. The <ref type="biblio">Monopolkommission (2015)</ref>,<lb/> an independent expert body in charge of competition policy assessment, has voiced some concern that part<lb/> of the subsidies can be taken up by the incumbent operator to modernise its copper networks. The federal<lb/> government owns 32% of the incumbent operator, which may generate perceptions of conflicts of interest.<lb/> Such perceptions can hold back entry of alternative operators.<lb/> 42.<lb/> Since there are scale economies in the rollout of high-speed broadband development the costs of<lb/> rollout per user will be the lower the more users there are. More demand for high-speed internet services<lb/> can therefore reduce average costs, which can then further raise demand, setting in motion market<lb/> dynamics which are favourable for roll-out. To strengthen demand, the government can start intensifying<lb/> the use of electronic communications (see below). More effective competition policy for internet-based<lb/> services could also help. In particular, current merger control rules appear insufficiently adapted to<lb/> competition issues in digital markets. In particular, to determine whether mergers should be prevented to<lb/> safeguard completion, the competition authority investigates whether market share would exceed critical<lb/> thresholds based on past turnover data, which must be met for the competition authority to intervene.<lb/> However, such turnover data are ill-suited to capture the future potential of market dominance by internet<lb/> service providers. Broadening the criteria for the assessment of market dominance would help. For<lb/> example, the competition authority could include the value of merger transactions (<ref type="biblio">Monopolkommission,<lb/> 2015</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<figure>Raising public investment to strengthen inclusive growth<lb/> 43.<lb/> Government investment has been low in the past 10 years, often falling short of depreciation,<lb/> especially in municipalities, and declined markedly at the level of the municipalities in the first half of the<lb/> 2000s (Figure 14). As outlined below, higher public investment into fixed and human capital in selected<lb/> areas would have substantial returns in terms of inclusive economic growth.<lb/> ECO/WKP(2016)50<lb/> Figure 14. Net government investment has fallen, especially by local governments<lb/> Source: OECD (2015), OECD National Accounts Database.<lb/></figure>

			<p>44.<lb/> Population ageing is unlikely to damp government investment needs over time, despite the<lb/> expected decline in population (OECD, 2016). Demographic change and internal migration will have<lb/> vastly differing implications for the population and its age composition across regions. Adjusting public<lb/> infrastructure to population developments increases investment demand (<ref type="biblio">KfW, 2015</ref>). As the share of the<lb/> elderly increases, the public infrastructure needs to be adjusted accordingly. For example for investment<lb/> into age-appropriate infrastructure investment needs are estimated to amount to 1.8% of GDP (<ref type="biblio">Köller,<lb/> 2013</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<head>Investment in full-day care and education for children has high returns<lb/></head>

			<p>45.<lb/> Investments in childcare and early childhood education have long term benefits and support<lb/> inclusive growth. Gaps remain in the quantity and quality of supply (OECD 2014b). The enrolment in<lb/> childcare of children under the age of 3 increased strongly in recent years (<ref type="biblio">Federal Statistical Office, 2015</ref>;<lb/> Economic Survey of Germany 2014, OECD 2014c). Nonetheless, only 29% of children under the age of<lb/> 3 were enrolled in day care in 2013 compared to 50% or more for Denmark, the Netherlands or France.<lb/> Enrolment rates remain low in international comparison and access to full-day care is limited (<ref type="biblio">OECD,<lb/> 2014f; Kultusministerkonferenz, 2015</ref>). Also Kindergarten hours are often short or part-time and<lb/> enrolment rates are below the OECD average. The quality and quantity of early child care facilities varies<lb/> strongly across regions (the Länder; <ref type="biblio">Bock-Famulla et al., 2015</ref>). Day-care can not only improve labour<lb/> market participation of second earners, but can also improve educational outcomes and social skills of<lb/> children, especially for those with weak socio-economic background (<ref type="biblio">StEG, 2010</ref>). The federal<lb/> government decided to support municipalities with the expansion of childcare with one billion euro per<lb/> year between 2015 and 2017, following similar investment programmes between 2008 and 2014.<lb/> 46.<lb/> In 2014 only 53.3% of elementary schools offered full-day schooling, catering for 33.1% of all<lb/> primary school children (KMK 2015). In most full-day schools participation in afternoon is not mandatory<lb/> (KMK 2015). They are only required to open at minimum 3 days a week for seven hours. The afternoon<lb/> hours mostly consist of care, foregoing the educational benefits full-day schooling can provide<lb/> (<ref type="biblio">Autorengruppe Bildungsberichterstattung 2014; OECD, 2015</ref>). For only 6.0% of primary school children<lb/> attendance in the afternoon was mandatory in 2013 (KMK 2015). More time spent in formal teaching<lb/> improves education outcomes especially for students with weak socio-economic background (OECD,<lb/> 2015) and strengthens intergenerational upward mobility in terms of education and income.<lb/></p>

			<head>The quality of transport infrastructure is high but standards are at risk<lb/></head>

			<p>47.<lb/> The survey based indicator (LPI) of the World Bank ranks Germany as the country with the best<lb/> quality of trade and transport related infrastructure worldwide since 2010. In the same time period the (also<lb/> survey based) assessment of the World Economic Forum of overall transport infrastructure fell from rank<lb/> 2 to rank 8. Decreases in the rankings in all areas of transportation (roads, air, train, ship) contributed to<lb/> this (World Economic Forum</p>

			<figure>, 2015; International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / World<lb/> Bank, 2014). Maintenance standards of federal infrastructure have fallen somewhat over the past 20 years<lb/> (BMVI 2015). However, most transport infrastructure is the responsibility of subnational governments. At<lb/> the municipal level, in particular, infrastructure endowments are likely to have deteriorated more<lb/> substantially.<lb/> 48.<lb/> Additional annual investment needs to maintain transport infrastructure across all levels of<lb/> government are estimated to be between EUR 3.8 billion (Kunert and Link 2013) and EUR 7.2 billion<lb/> (Daehre-Kommission, 2012). The federal government has budgeted additional investment for federal<lb/> transport infrastructure of EUR 5 billion spread over four years (2014-2017). In 2015 the federal<lb/> government announced an additional &quot; future investment &quot; package of EUR 10 billion which includes<lb/> EUR 3.1 billion for transport infrastructure between 2016 and 2018. Additional funding for transport<lb/> infrastructure will come from the extension of the highway toll for heavy goods vehicles to a broader range<lb/> of roads and vehicles.<lb/></figure>

			<head>Investment gaps are increasing especially at the local level<lb/></head>

			<table>49.<lb/> Municipalities have reported cumulated investment needs of 132 to 156 billion euros (3-5% of<lb/> GDP; KFW<ref type="biblio">, 2015; BMWi 2015</ref>). The biggest needs are seen in transport infrastructure, schools and other<lb/> educational facilities. The three most important reasons for the investment gap reported by the<lb/> municipalities are insufficient funding, high maintenance needs, and high social spending (<ref type="biblio">Alm and<lb/> Zettelmeyer, 2015; BMWi, 2015</ref>). The municipalities play a substantial role in contributing to transport<lb/> infrastructure as well as in social transfer spending (Box 2.).<lb/></p>

			<head>Box 2. The role of municipalities in revenue and task sharing between federal levels<lb/></head>

			<p>The German federal system consists of broadly three government levels: central government, Länder and<lb/> municipalities. Länder and municipalities are closely interlinked. The Länder have a discretionary power to delegate a<lb/> range of tasks to their municipalities. Therefore the division of tasks between a Land and its municipalities varies<lb/> across Länder. Municipalities are generally responsible for child care and early childhood education. Länder and<lb/> municipalities share the responsibility for primary, first and secondary education while municipalities are mainly<lb/> responsible for administrative tasks, buildings and equipment. Municipalities perform a large part of public social<lb/> transfer spending notably in the context of social assistance, support for asylum seekers, which are regulated by<lb/> federal law, and assistance for youth. In the area of infrastructure municipalities are responsible for almost 80% of<lb/> German roads, for local public transport as well as sport and healthcare facilities and they are also responsible for<lb/> sewage and waste.<lb/> Municipalities have three sources of funding: taxes, allocated funds from the respective Land and fees.<lb/> Municipalities receive the local business tax (Gewerbesteuer) as well as the tax on land and buildings and they receive<lb/> a share the joint taxes, namely of income taxes (15% of total income tax revenues) and VAT (2% or total VAT<lb/> revenues). Each Land has its own system of redistributing funds among municipalities. The central government cannot<lb/> make transfers to the municipalities directly, except to cofinance capital spending. The central government and the<lb/> Länder can agree to increase the municipalities&apos; share of joint taxes (income tax or VAT). The federal government can<lb/> also agree to make transfers to the Länder which they pass on to municipalities.<lb/> Generally municipalities are only allowed to use loans for investments. Cash credits are allowed for short term<lb/> use only. Limits to the use of cash credits can be set by the Land.<lb/> 50.<lb/> Municipalities which invest less tend to be those with weak budgetary positions, are in relatively<lb/> poor regions, and have relatively high spending on social cash transfers, which are often mandated at the<lb/> federal level, but are largely the responsibility of municipalities (<ref type="biblio">Arnold et al, 2015a, 2015b</ref>). Since these<lb/> social cash transfers are means-tested, such spending is correlated with poverty risk. Fiscal federal<lb/> transfers broadly equalise tax revenues per capita across the Länder, and across municipalities within each<lb/> Land, but do not take into account differences in federally mandated social cash transfer spending. This<lb/> reduces budgetary space for investment spending in municipalities where such transfer spending is high.<lb/> The federally-mandated social cash transfers account for 55% of their social spending (<ref type="biblio">Statistisches<lb/> Bundesamt, 2015</ref>). One example for such transfers are housing benefits for the long-term unemployed. For<lb/> these, data are available across municipalities. As <ref type="figure">Figure 15</ref> shows, municipalities with high spending on<lb/> these transfers invest less. While municipalities in aggregate generated budget surpluses between 2012 and<lb/> 2014, the budgetary situation is diverse across the Länder (<ref type="biblio">Arnold et al. 2015b</ref>). The municipalities&apos; short-<lb/>term borrowing more than doubled between 2004 and 2013, although it remains low on aggregate (2% of<lb/> GDP, BMF 2014).<lb/></p>

			<figure>Figure 15. Municipalities with high social transfer spending invest less<lb/> Municipal spending per capita, 2013<lb/> Source: Arnold, F., et al. (2015a), &quot;Large and lasting regional disparities in municipal investments&quot;, DIW Economic Bulletin 2015,<lb/> Vol. 5, issue 42/43, pp. 568-576.<lb/></figure>

			<p>51.<lb/> The central government introduced a special fund in 2015 which supports financially weak<lb/> municipalities with EUR 3.5 billion between 2015 and 2018. It funds up to 90% of investment projects in<lb/> hospitals, noise protection, urban development, broadband infrastructure, energy efficiency, clean air and<lb/> modernization of education facilities. However, by linking transfers to outstanding debt, this scheme risks<lb/> harming incentives for sound budgetary policies.<lb/> 52.<lb/> The federal government has taken over some of the federally-mandated social transfer spending<lb/> from the municipalities in recent years to create budgetary leeway for higher municipal investment. It is<lb/> considering to take some further steps in this direction (<ref type="biblio">Bertelsmann Stiftung, 2015; BMWi, 2016</ref>). The<lb/> federal government also provides financial support structurally weak regions in Eastern Germany in the<lb/> context of its programme Improving the Regional Economic Structure (<ref type="biblio">Gemeinschaftsaufgabe<lb/> &quot;Verbesserung der regionalen Wirtschaftsstruktur&quot; -GRW)</ref>, which supports close-to-business investments.<lb/> The government is also considering to extend this programme to Germany as a whole starting in 2020<lb/> (<ref type="biblio">BMWi, 2016</ref>). The new system could be broadened to include more measures which serve the higher<lb/> demand for public investments in certain areas, such as transportation, child-care or education. The federal<lb/> government should provide more support for investment in municipalities where federally-mandated<lb/> spending on cash transfers is high. Alternatively federal government support for municipal investment<lb/> could be based on income and demographic indicators, which are correlated with higher social spending<lb/> needs, such as age composition or the share of the immigrant population.<lb/> 53.<lb/> The long-term benefits of local investment of Länder and municipalities in childcare, early<lb/> childhood education and full-day schooling are likely to accrue nation-wide, generating positive economic<lb/> externalities for other jurisdictions. Therefore there is a case for the federal government to play a role in<lb/> fostering the supply of such services, in particular by contributing to their funding. Constitutional rules<lb/> limit federal government funding for child care facilities to capital spending and prevent the federal<lb/> government co-funding for compulsory education services. Considering the long-term and nation-wide<lb/> benefits of investments into education, including investments beyond physical capital, there is a case for<lb/> reviewing these barriers. As proposed in the 2014 Economic Survey (OECD, 2014c), the central<lb/> government could finance vouchers which parents could use to pay for childcare in accredited childcare<lb/> facilities. Such vouchers would provide incentives for the service providers to meet parental demand, for<lb/> example, with respect to opening hours.<lb/> 54.<lb/> Tax autonomy gives subnational government levels leeway to fund investment projects desired<lb/> by the local population. Revenue decentralization also tends to improve GDP growth in lagging regions<lb/> (OECD, forthcoming). The Länder have no significant tax-setting powers. Municipalities can set local<lb/> business and real estate tax rates. However, the local business tax base is highly geographically mobile,<lb/> limiting the scope to raise tax rates. Moreover these revenues are highly cyclical and volatile. Real estate<lb/> tax revenues are held back by outdated valuations of real estate. In order to make room for more fiscal<lb/> autonomy, Länder should be allowed to levy a surcharge on the income tax (<ref type="biblio">OECD, 2006; BMF 2015</ref>). A<lb/> reform of the taxation on real estate, in which the tax base is determined according to market prices – as<lb/> proposed in the OECD Economic Surveys since 2006 (see especially OECD, 2010) – could improve the<lb/> financial leeway of municipalities.<lb/> 55.<lb/> More leeway could also be given to municipalities to set real estate tax rates to encourage<lb/> infrastructure deployment in an environmentally-friendly way. Depending on its design, tax on land and<lb/> buildings can influence urban sprawl which is a key issue on the German environmental policy agenda<lb/> (<ref type="biblio">European Environment Agency, 2015, BMUB, 2013</ref>). Therefore, a revised tax on land and buildings<lb/> should allow for leeway to set higher rates on land than on buildings, as this sets incentives to develop<lb/> relatively less land, and set higher rates for single-family houses compared to multi-family houses (<ref type="biblio">OECD,<lb/> 2014b; Brandt, 2014; Slack and Bird, 2014</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<head>Making public procurement more efficient<lb/></head>

			<p>56.<lb/> Well-designed public procurement is important for the efficient use of public money in public<lb/> investment projects. Using electronic means in procurement (e-procurement) promotes the diffusion of<lb/> innovation, investment in knowledge-based capital and investment in ICT, with spillovers throughout the<lb/> economy (<ref type="biblio">OECD, 2013b; OECD, 2015c; OECD, 2011</ref>). This is because governments can pull demand<lb/> through their procurement activities because of their large purchasing power. This can help reduce costs<lb/> where scale economies can be exploited, for example, in the use of electronic communication through<lb/> internet. The German public procurement legislation will be completely overhauled in 2016 in response to<lb/> three new EU directives on public procurement and concessions.<lb/></p>

			<head>Fostering e-procurement<lb/></head>

			<p>57.<lb/> Germany lags behind in the use of information and communication technologies in public<lb/> procurement (<ref type="figure">Figure 16</ref>). The central government&apos;s spending on ICT is one of the lowest among OECD<lb/> countries (OECD, 2013c). The new EU public procurement directives require all member governments to<lb/> start conducting procurement electronically from 2016. The government&apos;s plans to implement a<lb/> comprehensive e-procurement system (<ref type="biblio">Federal Government, 2015</ref>) and to promote the smart digital<lb/> interconnectedness of public services are welcome (Federal Ministry of Economic <ref type="biblio">Affairs and Energy,<lb/> 2015</ref>). These initiatives should also include measures to make sure that relevant infrastructure is provided.<lb/></p>

			<figure>Figure 16. Electronic procurement is scarcely used<lb/> Businesses using electronic procurement systems<lb/> Source: OECD (2015), Government at a Glance 2015.<lb/></figure>

			<p>58.<lb/> E-procurement raises the skill-requirements for procurement officials, including for ICT skills.<lb/> Concerns exist about a lack of ICT skills within procuring entities, especially at the local level. For<lb/> instance, civil servants are not trained for data analysis and re-use (<ref type="biblio">OECD, 2013b; OECD, 2015b;<lb/> Wegweiser, 2009</ref>). Incentives need to be designed for procurement officials to consider strategic goals in<lb/> their decision making, especially because they are operating in a risk-adverse culture. The impact of<lb/> procurement policies on strategic objectives, notably innovation, is not monitored (OECD, 2015b; OECD,<lb/> 2013b).<lb/></p>

			<head>Spreading best practices within Germanys federal structure<lb/></head>

			<p>59.<lb/> Germany&apos;s federal structure generates considerable diversity in the procurement and the<lb/> implementation of investment projects across municipalities. This yields valuable lessons about best<lb/> practices which need to be spread across all jurisdictions. The federal government should play an important<lb/> role in coordinating this learning process in view of the substantial innovation opportunities. At present, it<lb/> does not coordinate training for public procurement officials or establish policies for contracting<lb/> authorities, unlike in many other OECD countries (OECD, 2015b). There are also concerns that the<lb/> substantial decline in local public investment has resulted in a lack of expertise by municipalities to<lb/> implement complex infrastructure projects or sophisticated financing arrangements. The share of<lb/> government contracts acquired by SMEs is low, which argues for simplified administrative procedures<lb/> (OECD, 2013c).<lb/> 60.<lb/> Support for local governments in improving procurement and implementing investment should<lb/> be strengthened, as envisaged by the government. It should support municipalities in improving<lb/> procurement procedures and planning and realising complex investment projects (Academic Advisory<lb/> Board of the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and <ref type="biblio">Energy, 2015</ref>). The regional consultancy units<lb/> should be regarded as a two-way communication channel to spread best practices within Germany&apos;s<lb/> federal system. E-procurement can help to ensure a well-informed consultation process (see above).<lb/></p>

			<head>Reform of budgeting can help ensure priority investment projects are carried out<lb/></head>

			<p>61.<lb/> Effective budgeting procedures help identify costs and benefits of public investment projects,<lb/> helping to ensure appropriate budget allocation for investment and optimal choice of investment projects.<lb/> Regular reviews of expenditure are being introduced to support evidence-based priority-setting. The first<lb/> cycle of these spending reviews is about to finish in spring/summer 2016. This is welcome, but there is<lb/> scope for improvement (OECD, 2014d):<lb/></p>

			<p> The federal parliament focuses on micro-level management of budgetary allocations. The<lb/> parliament&apos;s role in monitoring the strategic orientation of budgeting and procurement<lb/> procedures should be strengthened, for instance by raising its analytical capacity. The<lb/> collaboration with independent research institutions could be expanded or an independent<lb/> parliamentary budget office, like recently established in Austria, be created.<lb/>  The use of performance information in budgeting processes is increasingly popular among OECD<lb/> countries to promote the efficient use of public resources and improve the accountability of the<lb/> government. In Germany such practices are used little. For instance, poor performance of<lb/> spending programmes is made public only selectively and rarely has negative budgetary<lb/> implications (OECD, 2013c). Several line ministries have started improving their evaluation<lb/> methodology.<lb/></p>

			<head>Involving the public more effectively<lb/></head>

			<p>62.<lb/> A key impediment for carrying out large-scale, complex public investment projects in Germany<lb/> is strong resistance of the local population, which makes it unattractive for local governments to even<lb/> contemplate such projects (<ref type="biblio">Bertelsmann Stiftung, 2012</ref>). Resistance at a late stage of the planning phase<lb/> can also result in higher costs, which can be avoided if the public is involved early in decision-making.<lb/> Complex infrastructure projects often yield important benefits for society as a whole, but can also generate<lb/> negative local externalities, for instance pollution or noise. Moderating such conflicts requires involvement<lb/> of the public in the planning and realisation of investment projects.<lb/> 63.<lb/> There is scope to involve the public more effectively in realising complex investment projects in<lb/> Germany (OECD, 2014b). Ninety-eight per cent of citizens want to be involved more in the planning of<lb/> infrastructure projects (<ref type="biblio">Bertelsmann Stiftung, 2015a</ref>). The recent advances in electronic media and<lb/> communication technologies offer much scope to improve the way public administrations, citizens and<lb/> civil society can interact. E-governance, if used as a two-way communication tool, can be particularly<lb/> useful in raising citizen participation (European Institute for Public <ref type="biblio">Participation, 2009; OECD, 2014b</ref>).<lb/> However, currently the German government uses advanced communication tools mainly to provide<lb/> information (OECD, 2013c). More efforts are needed to involve the public in planning and realising<lb/> investment projects, including through advanced communication tools. Such efforts would also result in an<lb/> improvement of civic engagement and public governance, which is one of the key OECD wellbeing<lb/> indicators, and the only one in which Germany scores below the OECD average (OECD, 2015o).<lb/></p>

			<head>Harnessing private funding for public infrastructure<lb/></head>

			<p>64.<lb/> Governments of OECD countries are increasingly considering Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs)<lb/> as a means to finance and raise the quality of infrastructure in light of increasing fiscal constraints (<ref type="biblio">Araujo<lb/> and Sutherland, 2010</ref>). PPP arrangements can improve efficiency, but only if based on a sound analysis of<lb/> their suitability and careful contract design (Box 3). Germany has so far engaged little in PPPs<lb/> (Partnerschaften Deutschland, 2015).<lb/> 65.<lb/> The central government&apos;s PPPs conform well with the OECD Principles on Public Governance of<lb/> PPPs (OECD, 2014d). There is scope to strengthen framework conditions for PPPs, especially at<lb/> subnational levels of government (OECD, 2014d; OECD 2010). Sub-national governments are not<lb/> required to disclose the long-term financial risks associated with particular PPP projects to the federal<lb/> government, even though they have to prove that every PPP project improves value for money compared to<lb/> other procurement methods so it is not merely used as an alternative to borrowing. Nonetheless, risks can<lb/> arise for example because the Länder can give minimum revenue guarantees to the private party, unlike the<lb/> federal government. Raising the transparency of the various risks associated with PPPs realised by<lb/> subnational levels of government may become increasingly important in the future as the debt brake could<lb/> make off-budget borrowing more attractive.<lb/> 66.<lb/> Some sector specific regulatory obstacles hold back PPPs. For instance, different municipal<lb/> funding rules apply for construction, maintenance and operation of investment projects in some areas,<lb/> including roads, hospitals and schools. This makes it more difficult to include all phases of infrastructure<lb/> projects in a single PPP contract. (<ref type="biblio">OECD, 2014c; OECD 2010</ref>). Sector specific regulation should be<lb/> reviewed to eliminate unnecessary barriers to PPPs.<lb/></p>

			<head>Box 3. Opportunities and challenges of PPPs<lb/></head>

			<p>Public-private partnerships (PPPs) typically constitute a specific agreement between a public entity and the<lb/> private sector for the provision and operation of a public service. PPPs typically are based on a long term, risk<lb/> sharing contract between public and private parties. The contract covers the bundling of design, construction,<lb/> operation and/or asset maintenance, together with a major component of private finance (<ref type="biblio">Kappeler, 2012</ref>).<lb/> PPPs can be a superior solution to traditional public procurement (<ref type="biblio">Araujo and Sutherland, 2010</ref>). Efficiency<lb/> gains arise from increased competition and innovation, more efficient risk allocations and access to private sector<lb/> skills and technology transfer. The bundling of procurement and operation provides incentives for the private<lb/> partner to account for life-cycle costs of the project more comprehensively. Also, the likelihood of cost overruns in<lb/> the construction phase is lower for PPPs than for traditional public procurement (Blanc-<ref type="biblio">Brude and Makovsek,<lb/> 2013</ref>).<lb/> However PPPs can increase costs and financial risks (<ref type="biblio">Araujo and Sutherland, 2010; Weichenrieder, 2014</ref>).<lb/> Whether efficiency gains are fully reaped depends, for instance, on the proper allocation of risks to the party<lb/> better equipped to deal with them. The option of contract-renegotiation needs to be carefully designed to allow<lb/> adjustments to changing external conditions, while avoiding bargaining power is abused once the infrastructure is<lb/> put in place (hold-up problem). The design of pricing policies is important to avoid overinvestment; and effective<lb/> performance monitoring is needed to ensure service quality and avoid under-investment. Rapid technological<lb/> change may make it more difficult to specify outputs or to quantify risks over the contract life-cycle. Moreover, the<lb/> temptation to use PPPs as a means to circumvent budgetary pressures can lead to large contingent liabilities<lb/> affecting long-term fiscal and macroeconomic sustainability and inter-generational equity.<lb/> 67.<lb/> Data on the performance of PPPs is limited. Sharing experience spreads best practices. It is<lb/> therefore welcome that a federal and some regional PPP advisory units have been put in place (OECD,<lb/> 2010b). These should cover all Länder. Germany should also promote the international exchange of<lb/> experience about PPPs. Harmonizing procedures within Germany&apos;s federal structure and among OECD<lb/> and EU countries can also help strengthen competition and lower costs.<lb/> 68.<lb/> Some OECD countries explore new instruments to facilitate public-private cooperation, for<lb/> instance, social impact investment in the US and the UK. Investors engage a contractual obligation to<lb/> improve a social outcome. If the social outcome reaches an agreed performance threshold, investors<lb/> receive a financial return. For this instrument to be successful, the social outcome needs to be measurable<lb/> (OECD, 2015d). Sharing experiences with other countries is essential should this comparatively new<lb/> instrument be considered.<lb/> 69.<lb/> Project bonds are another instrument increasingly used to raise private money to finance<lb/> infrastructure (Della Croce and <ref type="biblio">Gatti, 2014</ref>). They are issued by the private partner engaged in an<lb/> infrastructure project. Project bonds are attractive to institutional investors because they can more easily be<lb/> issued with long maturities, which match the long-term horizon of infrastructure projects. However, bond<lb/> investors need to be sufficiently informed about the risks involved. This is especially true if project bonds<lb/> are used to engage pension funds.<lb/></p>

			<head>User fees can raise the efficiency of infrastructure<lb/></head>

			<p>70.<lb/> Usage-dependent charges are powerful instruments to internalise emission and non-emission<lb/> costs of public infrastructure use (OECD, 2014c). Such charges contribute to an effective use of existing<lb/> infrastructure and reduce congestion if differentiated by location and time. Such congestion charges can<lb/> signal infrastructure needs, helping to direct investment in transport infrastructure to where it is most<lb/> needed. By reducing the net budgetary cost of the infrastructure investment, they can also help overcome<lb/> budgetary limitations in deploying needed infrastructure. Experience of other countries shows that user<lb/> charges are more easily accepted if infrastructure is provided in collaboration with private partners<lb/> (Academic Advisory Board of the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy, 2014).<lb/> 71.<lb/> Plans to establish an independent agency in charge of the federal road infrastructure investment,<lb/> which would raise revenues from road use charges, can be a useful step in this direction. This improves<lb/> and the long-term sustainability of road projects, (Academic Advisory Board of the Federal Ministry for<lb/> Economic <ref type="biblio">Affairs and Energy, 2015</ref>). Germany has extended usage-based charges for trucks to a broader<lb/> range of freight transport vehicles and federal long-distance roads. However, the planned user charge for<lb/> passenger cars is not usage-dependent. Germany should consider extending usage-based charges for<lb/> passenger cars. Such charges could also be differentiated by location and time. The required infrastructure<lb/> for usage-dependent charges is already in place to a large extent because of the existing digital toll system<lb/> to operate the usage-dependent charges for trucks.<lb/></p>
