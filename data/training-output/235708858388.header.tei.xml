	<div type="abstract">Abstract<lb/> This document provides a checklist on environmental issues for negotiators of regional trade<lb/> agreements (RTAs) in order to provide guidance to countries wishing to include environmental provisions<lb/> in RTAs. The checklist draws on countries&apos; experience of negotiating and implementing environmental<lb/> provisions of RTAs, which other countries may find useful when considering their own approaches to<lb/> environmental issues in RTAs.<lb/> The checklist is intended to provide a reference to assist discussion of environmental issues, when the<lb/> inclusion of environmental provisions is considered appropriate, before, during and after negotiation of<lb/> trade agreements. It is by no means prescriptive. As the number and variety of RTAs continues to increase,<lb/> the checklist should be viewed as a &apos;living document&apos; that could be modified and updated as countries gain<lb/> new experience.<lb/></div>
