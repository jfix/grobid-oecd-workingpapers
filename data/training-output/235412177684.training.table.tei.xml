            <table>support for the production of biofuels has been motivated<lb/> primarily by agricultural and energy policies with the aim of substituting<lb/> biofuels for imported oil and supporting farm incomes and agricultural sector<lb/> industries. More recently support for biofuels has become a core part of many<lb/> national policies for reducing transport sector CO 2 emissions. The relative<lb/> importance of each driver differs between governments.<lb/> Subsidies for biofuels are growing rapidly and are estimated to have reached<lb/> around USD 15 billion in 2007 for the OECD as a whole. Many Governments<lb/> have also imposed biofuel quotas for oil distributors. The European Union<lb/> requires Member States to take measures to ensure that biofuels account for<lb/> 2% of the demand for transport fuels, rising to 5.75% in 2010. The European<lb/> Commission proposes increasing the target to 10% by 2020 1 . The US<lb/> Government set a target of 4 billion gallons of ethanol for 2006, nearly 3% of<lb/> the gasoline market, and has proposed a target of 35 billion gallons of biofuels<lb/> production by 2017, which is expected to account for about 9% of transport<lb/> sector fuel consumption.</table>

            <table>is not common practice today and when degraded lands have<lb/> been converted to biofuel production, such as on some Conservation Reserve<lb/> Program lands in the United States, traditional crops such as maize have<lb/> usually been used, causing all of the problems discussed above. Alternatives have been proposed that would establish perennial crops to restore land<lb/> quality and sequester carbon in soils at the same time as producing biofuels,<lb/> using existing species such as prairie grasses or genetically modified biofuel<lb/> crops such as elephant grass (miscanthus). These approaches have not yet<lb/> been demonstrated and would produce biofuels on only a limited scale<lb/> because of the relatively low productivity of such land and feedstocks.</table>

            <table>Professor de Almeida&apos;s paper examines the performance of Brazilian ethanol<lb/> and biodiesel in detail, including energy and CO 2 balances, quantifying<lb/> subsidies and examining the direct and indirect environmental impacts of<lb/> producing biofuels. The discussions focused on ethanol, reflecting the relative<lb/> significance of ethanol and biodiesel in Brazil. The most comprehensive body of research on ethanol in Brazil, led by<lb/> Professor de Macedo, finds ethanol produced from sugar cane achieving 30%<lb/> to 80% greenhouse gas savings compared with gasoline, depending on the<lb/> efficiency of feedstock production and the operation of plants, with most<lb/> towards the upper end of performance. Professor Almeida&apos;s thorough review<lb/> of the literature confirms the superior performance of Brazilian ethanol<lb/> production, although the he was not able to assess all of the uncertainties<lb/> discussed above surrounding such estimates. The advantages for Brazilian<lb/> ethanol production are as follows:</table>

The scheme design must also be in<lb/> line with the proposals developed under the European Fuel Quality Directive.<lb/> The Netherlands has scheduled introduction of a reporting system in 2008,<lb/> similar to that adopted in the UK. Technical guidance is being developed (by<lb/> Ecofys) in alignment, as far as possible, with UK guidance.<lb/> The German government planned to introduce certification in June 2007.<lb/> Although introduction has been delayed in Germany, certification there is<lb/> expected to be compulsory without a long lead-in period of voluntary<lb/> reporting. Germany plans to organise workshops in Asia and South America<lb/> to build support for certification with local Non-Governmental Organisations<lb/> (NGOs) and local communities as well as governments and biofuel producers.</table>
