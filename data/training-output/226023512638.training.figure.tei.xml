(2005), on the other hand, adjusted the trade flows between China/Hong Kong and<lb/> other countries by taking into account the re-exports between China and Hong Kong. Their starting point is<lb/> to consider the value-added generated in Hong Kong when the re-exports occur. Different mark-up rates<lb/> are applied to different destination countries based on 1-digit SITC level according to the availability of<lb/> trade statistics for Chinese exports to Hong Kong and the Hong Kong re-exports of the same commodities.<lb/> That is, the mark-up of the value added is calculated by multiplying the mark-up rate to the value of<lb/> Chinese re-exports through Hong Kong to the destination countries. However, in order to avoid the<lb/> situation in which the Hong Kong re-export value added is higher than the import value from China as<lb/> reported in UN trade statistics, the value added of Hong Kong is re-defined as:<lb/> HK VA = Mark-up rate × min {UN country imports from China, China re-exports to UN country}<lb/> Note that the import statistics from China reported by the UN are at the 4-digit level of SITC. For<lb/> each country in the UN dataset, the value of imports from China is reduced by the calculated HK VA, while<lb/> the value of imports from Hong Kong is increased by the calculated HK VA.</figDesc>

Such information is more prevalent for import data. While some of these data<lb/> can be attributed to re-imports or re-exports of goods, according to the available country notes in ITCS,<lb/> this is not always the case – see latest documentation for OECD&apos;s Bilateral Trade Database (OECD, 2008)<lb/> for more details.<lb/> 13.<lb/> See http://comtrade.un.org/kb/article.aspx?id=10152.</figDesc>

            <figDesc>Of particular note are the variations of shares of unallocated trade for product across years within<lb/> countries. For example, in OECD&apos;s ITCS database, Australia has very high shares of exports not allocated<lb/> by product from 1990 to 2000 (14-19%) which drops to about 7% in 2005. Reasons for such variations can<lb/> include improvements in identifying transactions; changes in trading structures so that more or fewer<lb/> transactions in &quot; confidential trade &quot; are undertaken; or changes in the way such data are reported – from<lb/> providing data by partner but not by product to providing data by product but not by partner or vice versa.</figDesc>

            <figDesc>some years the OECD has produced the Bilateral Trade Database (BTD) for industrial analysis<lb/> which presents trade in goods according to economic activities, most recently using a classification based<lb/> on ISIC Rev.3. It is designed to be comparable with other data sets in OECD&apos;s &quot; STAN family &quot; including<lb/> OECD&apos;s I-O tables 17 . BTD is compiled from OECD&apos;s ITCS by using a standard conversion from the 1988<lb/> version of the Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System (HS 1988) to ISIC Rev.3 for all<lb/> countries 18 . Data recorded in later versions of HS (HS 1996, HS 2002) are converted to HS 1988<lb/> beforehand. The drawbacks of this standard approach include the following:</figDesc>
