DEV/DOC(2014)2 4 © OECD/CABRI 2014 ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This Working Paper builds on the analytical framework and questionnaire elaborated by 
Laura Recuero-Virto at the OECD Development Centre, in close collaboration with Nana 
Boateng of the Collaborative Africa Budget Reform Initiative (CABRI). Marie 
Castaing Gachassin, from the University of Paris 1 Panthéon-Sorbonne, analysed the results 
and drafted the paper in collaboration with Emilie Gay of the CABRI Secretariat. Also at the 
Development Centre, Sebastian Nieto Parra provided precious guidance throughout the 
project, which Gregory De Paepe helped bring to fruition. The authors wish to express their sincere gratitude to the budget officials from the following 
countries of the CABRI network who agreed to respond to the questionnaire: Benin, 
Botswana, Burundi, Cabo Verde, Cameroon, Chad, Democratic Republic of Congo, Djibouti, 
Gambia, Kenya, Lesotho, Madagascar, Mauritius, Morocco, Namibia, Niger, Rwanda, São 
Tomé and Príncipe, Sierra Leone, Republic of Sudan, Tunisia and Zimbabwe. OECD Development Centre Working Paper No.323 
DEV/DOC(2014)2 © OECD/CABRI 2014 5 PREFACE Better infrastructure is badly needed to improve the lives of African people and to 
strengthen the competitiveness of African economies. This has been documented, among others, 
in the successive editions of the African Economic Outlook, which the OECD Development 
Centre has published jointly with the African Development Bank since 2002. The extent of the 
challenge is also well recorded: to close the gap with other parts of the world and achieve 
national development targets on the continent, the World Bank estimates that $93 billion must be 
spent on infrastructure every year over a ten-year period. Can this challenge be met? There are some encouraging signs, such as the launching of 
the Programme for Infrastructure Development in Africa by the African Union Commission, the 
NEPAD Secretariat and the African Development Bank. In addition, higher growth, windfall 
revenues from natural resources and debt cancellations have increased the fiscal space for many 
African governments to invest in infrastructure. However, serious concerns remain. In particular 
the ambition of mobilising private investment on a significant scale, for instance in the form of 
public-private partnerships, has yet to materialise. Also while public investment budgets have 
increased in many countries, the capacity of national administrations to optimise the quality of 
public expenditure too often remains a constraint. The latter is the subject of this Working Paper. How do public authorities manage public 
spending on infrastructure in Africa? To what extent do budgetary processes and institutions 
hamper the continent's infrastructural development? To answer these questions, the 
Development Centre adapted the analytical framework it used to study similar issues in Latin 
America and joined forces with the Collaborative Africa Budget Reform Initiative (CABRI) to 
administer a questionnaire to its network of budget officials in African countries. The results are 
mixed: while the efficiency of public expenditure per se is assessed rather positively, 
infrastructure development too often suffers from inadequate medium-term planning. The 
evidence assembled here suggests that attention should be paid not only to mobilising funds but 
also to enhancing governments' capacity to spend them effectively on development. This paper was produced as part of the OECD Development Centre's work on fiscal 
policy in Africa. We hope it contributes to African governments' efforts, supported by CABRI, to 
increase the quality of public expenditure in infrastructure. Mario Pezzini

DEV/DOC(2014)2 6 © OECD/CABRI 2014 RESUMÉ Dans quelle mesure les processus budgétaires et les institutions entravent-elles le 
développement des infrastructures en Afrique ? Pour répondre à cette question, ce document 
analyse les réponses de responsables du budget à un questionnaire administrés dans 22 pays 
africains : Bénin, Botswana , Burundi, Cameroun , Cabo Verde, Tchad, République démocratique 
du Congo, Djibouti, Gambie, Kenya, Lesotho, Madagascar, Maurice, Maroc, Namibie, Niger, 
Rwanda, São Tomé et Príncipe, Sierra Leone, République du Soudan, la Tunisie et le Zimbabwe. Ses principales conclusions sont les suivantes : 1. La sélection des projets d'infrastructure pourrait être améliorée. En particulier, le 
processus d'évaluation a besoin d'une utilisation plus systématique d'analyses coûts-avantages 
et/ou coût-efficacité ; la sélection des projets n'est pas suffisamment fondée sur l'amélioration des 
indicateurs physiques ; la société civile n'est généralement pas consultée. 2. Les projets prioritaires sont généralement mis en oeuvre en premier et les différents 
niveaux de planification (national, sectoriel et local) se chevauchent souvent, même si les 
objectifs locaux sont moins prioritaires. 3. Les sources de financement de l'infrastructure sont nombreuses et variées, mais les fonds 
publics en représentent la majeure partie. La tendance à l'augmentation des montants dépensés au 
cours des dix dernières années est compatible avec le fonctionnement globalement positif de ce 
mode de financement. Le principal défi est maintenant de lutter contre la tendance à favoriser les 
nouveaux investissements au détriment des dépenses de fonctionnement et d'entretien. 4. En ce qui concerne la façon dont les gouvernements africains utilisent les fonds publics 
pour le financement des infrastructures, l'étude souligne que leur action est dans l'ensemble 
efficace, efficiente et conforme aux règles de la prudence budgétaire. 5. Malgré ces constats généralement positifs, certains problèmes spécifiques méritent plus 
d'attention afin d'améliorer la rentabilité des dépenses d'infrastructure. Dans la phase de 
planification, une utilisation prudente de l'évaluation économique, financière, sociale et 
environnementale permettrait d'assurer la faisabilité et l'opportunité des projets. Le manque 
d'entretien a des effets délétères sur l'efficacité des investissements. Il faut reconsidérer les 
objectifs politiques des dépenses d'infrastructure dans les phases de planification et de 
budgétisation, car ces phases sont génératrices d'inefficacités liées aux coûts cachés. Classification JEL: H54 O20 Mots-clés: Afrique, infrastructure, budgétisation et planification nationale, réformes de gestion

DEV/DOC(2014)2 © OECD/CABRI 2014 7 ABSTRACT To what extent do budgetary processes and institutions hamper infrastructural 
development in Africa? To answer that question, this report analyses the answers of budget 
officials to questionnaires administered in 22 African countries: Benin, Botswana, Burundi, 
Cameroon, Cabo Verde, Chad, Democratic Republic of Congo, Djibouti, Gambia, Kenya, 
Lesotho, Madagascar, Mauritius, Morocco, Namibia, Niger, Rwanda, São Tomé and Príncipe, 
Sierra Leone, Republic of Sudan, Tunisia and Zimbabwe. The main conclusions of the report are as follows: 1. The selection of infrastructure projects could be improved. In particular the appraisal 
process needs a more extensive use of Cost-Benefit and/or Cost-Effectiveness Analyses; the 
selection of projects is not sufficiently based on the improvements of physical indicators; civil 
society is generally not consulted. 2. Highest priority projects are implemented first and the different planning levels 
(national, sectorial, local) generally overlap even though local objectives are less of a priority. 3. The sources of finance infrastructure are various and numerous, but public funds 
represent the bulk of it. The growing trend in the amounts spent over the last ten years is 
consistent with the overall positive functioning of this mode of financing. The main challenge is 
now to circumvent the capital bias that tends to favour new investments over operation and 
maintenance expenditures. 4. Regarding how African governments use public funds for infrastructure financing, the 
survey underlines the fact that their action is overall effective, efficient and subject to the rules of 
fiscal prudence. 5. Despite the general optimistic situation described above, some specific aspects deserve 
more attention in order to generate more value for money in infrastructure spending. In the 
planning stage, a careful use of economic, financial, social and environmental appraisal would 
ensure the feasibility and the desirability of the projects. Inefficiencies related to the inadequate 
attention to maintenance require a change in political objectives for infrastructure spending at 
the planning and budgeting phases. There are inefficiencies related to hidden costs. JEL Classification:

DEV/DOC(2014)2 8 © OECD/CABRI 2014 I. INTRODUCTION For decades, the role of infrastructure in growth and development has been regularly 
emphasised in economic literature. One of the first justifications relates to the Big Push theory 
(Rosentein-Rodan, 1943, 1961): large amounts of investments are needed to embark on the path 
of economic development and in particular infrastructure investments. This question has gained 
renewed interest since the late 1980s when the productivity of public expenditure was 
questioned (Aschauer, 1989). Despite the debate on the magnitude of their effects (OECD, 2006), the variety of channels 
through which infrastructure affects growth is clearly identified. Infrastructure represents a 
direct input into production through the services it provides (transport, energy, and information 
technologies). Indirectly, it can also alter the composition of other inputs and play a role through 
economies of scale and scope (Bennathan et al., 2006; Straub, 2008). Infrastructure is also at the 
core of structural transformation of economies (UNCTAD, 2009; Lin, 2011). Empirical evidence tends to confirm that these mechanisms are actually at work in the 
infrastructure-growth relationship, even in Less Developed Countries (LDCs) (Estache and 
Garsous, 2010; Djiofack-Zebaze and Keck, 2006; Escribano, Guasch and Pena, 2009; Calderón, 
2009). The other beneficial aspect of infrastructure is its action as an anti-poverty tool. The 
provision of infrastructure services to the poor is crucial in order to ensure their connectivity 
with economic activities and additional productive opportunities (Estache, Foster and Wodon, 
2002). Isolation from economic centres created by a lack of infrastructure provision hampers the 
development of local markets (Deichmann, Shilpi and Vadkis, 2008; Mu and van de Walle, 2011). The beneficial expected impact of infrastructure is even stronger for poorer countries 
(Bennathan and Canning, 2000; Estache, 2010). Bridging infrastructure gaps is consequently a 
high priority for LDCs and in particular in Africa. 1 However, Africa's infrastructure networks increasingly lag behind those of other 
developing countries. The situation has not changed significantly since the 60s, despite an 
increasing trend in public investment in infrastructure since the 2000s (World Bank, 2010). 1. 
Since more than 34 of the 48 LDCs are African countries.

DEV/DOC(2014)2 © OECD/CABRI 2014 9 In this context, CABRI 2 and the OECD Development Centre have jointly undertaken 
research with the main objective of assessing whether budgetary processes and institutions in 
Africa are hampering (or not) infrastructural development. This question stems from the fact that 
descriptive evidence and the economic literature on growth and public infrastructure highlights 
the point that spending does not automatically translate into growth returns. The empirical 
relation between economic growth and performance or physical indicators for infrastructure is 
strong, whereas the relation between growth and public spending is relatively weak and in some 
cases not significant: the underlying interpretation refers to public infrastructure spending on 
governance and institutions (Jimenez, 1995; Sanchez-Robles, 1998). The way in which public authorities manage public spending on infrastructure through 
budget processes and institutions is known as the concept of Public Financial Management (PFM). 
This notion of governance in public spending can be summarised as the procedures, established 
by law or regulation, for the management of public monies through the budget process, which 
includes formulation, execution, reporting and analysis (Potter and Diamond, 1999, in Prakash 
and Cabezon, 2008; Lienert and Fainboim, 2010). Good public financial governance is achieved 
when these procedures result in responsive public services through public spending that is 
affordable, transparent and accountable, and which funds government priorities without 
wastage or corruption (CABRI, 2010d). PFM reforms in developing economies include interventions aiming at  " improving the 
comprehensiveness of budget operations, building better links between annual allocations, 
medium-term policy objectives and performance indicators, and computerising budget 
management and expenditure controls "  (de Renzio, Andrews and Mills, 2010). These initiatives 
typically cover the issues related to infrastructure financing in Africa. Good PFM is therefore key 
to ensuring infrastructure deployment, as the achievement of development objectives relies on an 
efficient and effective delivery of services and a sustainable quality/level of services (OECD, 
2011; Kioko et al., 2011). Good PFM can also help align different national agendas, one of the 
tremendous challenges hampering the realisation of the cross-border infrastructure programmes 
(World Economic Forum, 2014). The present report focuses on PFM in infrastructure and is based on data collected 
through questionnaires administered to budget officials in 22 African countries: 3 Benin, 
Botswana, Burundi, Cameroon, Cabo Verde, Chad, Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), 
Djibouti, Gambia, Kenya, Lesotho, Madagascar, Mauritius, Morocco, Namibia, Niger, Rwanda, 2. 
The Collaborative Africa Budget Reform Initiative (CABRI) is a professional network of senior budget 
officials in African Ministries of Finance and/or Planning. CABRI was officially launched on 14 May 
2008 in Maputo, Mozambique. On 3 December 2009, CABRI became a legal and independent 
membership based organisation. See Appendix 1 for more details. 3. 
The survey also includes Asian and Pacific countries: Afghanistan, Bhutan, East Timor, Samoa and 
Solomon Islands. A summary of the results for these countries is presented in Appendix 3. Public financial management in infrastructure in Africa 
DEV/DOC(2014)2 10 © OECD/CABRI 2014 São Tomé and Príncipe, Sierra Leone, Republic of Sudan, Tunisia and Zimbabwe. 4 Building on a 
survey conducted by the OECD Development Centre on Latin America (Nieto-Parra et al., 2013), 
this analysis attempts to identify the main bottlenecks hindering effective infrastructure service 
delivery throughout the policy-making process. In particular, the survey investigates the main modalities that characterise budgetary 
institutions, such as: @BULLET degree of flexibility; @BULLET transparency; @BULLET sustainability; @BULLET centralisation of decision, revenue collection and spending; @BULLET participation of legislature; @BULLET use of performance information/indicators. The report is organised as follows: a first section presents the role of planning and 
budgeting in infrastructure spending in Africa. It emphasises the importance of a careful and 
rigorous selection of projects, the parallel question of prioritisation, and the role of multi-year 
planning. Section II reviews the various financial sources of infrastructure spending in Africa, 
and their relative importance for the different infrastructure sectors, before covering the issue of 
under versus over-spending. Section III describes the institutional architecture of public funds 
used to finance infrastructure spending, with three segmentations for the origins of public funds: 
i) general, earmarked or off-budget funds; ii) central versus local budgets, iii) budget versus 
specialised institutions. Finally, Section IV investigates the way governments use public funds to 
finance infrastructure, and in particular whether the criteria of efficiency, fiscal prudence and 
effectiveness are met in Africa. 4. 
The survey may be subject to various sources of bias: stated (as opposed to revealed) preferences, 
country-specific preferences affecting cross-country comparability, dominance of certain types of 
infrastructure in policy-making processes. OECD Development Centre Working Paper No.323 
DEV/DOC(2014)2 © OECD/CABRI 2014 11 II. BUDGETING AND PLANNING OF INFRASTRUCTURE 
INVESTMENTS The policy making process for infrastructure consists of four phases: 5 1. planning and prioritisation; 2. execution; 3. operation and maintenance; 4. monitoring and evaluation. The first section of the report focuses on the planning and prioritisation stage. This stage 
encompasses the budgetary process that will decide the allocation of resources to specific 
priorities, 6 after the selection of projects. A first sub-section covers the process of selection with an emphasis on appraisal and the 
notion of value for money in infrastructure investments. The second sub-section presents the 
notion of prioritisation in infrastructure spending first in a general way and then by opposing 
regional/sectorial targets versus national objectives and development plans. In conclusion the 
third sub-section defines the role of multi-year budgeting and planning in infrastructure. II.1. Selection of projects The project planning phase is usually the most challenging (OECD, 2013). The 
effectiveness of infrastructure investment requires a careful selection of projects based on a 
rigorous appraisal. This complex and recurrent process aims at providing a comprehensive 
assessment of the investment (OECD, 2013). Appraisal should ideally cover several criteria to assess both the desirability of the 
infrastructure investment ( " Should it be done? " ) and its feasibility ( " Can it be done? " ). The set of 
criteria includes the technical, financial, economic, social, institutional, environmental and 
political aspects of the project (CABRI, 2010a). As such, appraisal represents both a useful toolkit 5. This definition is based on a survey conducted by the OECD Development Centre that attempts to 
identify the main bottlenecks hindering effective infrastructure service delivery throughout the policy-
making process (see OECD, 2013). 
6. This question of prioritisation is covered in sub-section I.2. (II.2) Public financial management in infrastructure in Africa 
DEV/DOC(2014)2 12 © OECD/CABRI 2014 and a challenge for decision makers due to the profusion of information needed to conduct a 
rigorous approach (CABRI, 2010a). Concretely, the appraisal process compares all costs and benefits related to an investment 
project. The typical tools are cost-benefit (CBA) and cost-effectiveness analyses (CEA), 
depending on the type of projects and the definition of costs and benefits. 7 While CBA is used to 
ascertain whether benefits exceed costs, CEA compares the relative expenditure (costs) and 
outcomes (effects) of two or more courses of action. The typical caveats and constraints related to 
such analyses concern the way of estimating the impact of risk (International Transport Forum, 
2011) and the choice of a measure for the project worth (CABRI, 2010a). The use of CBA and/or CEA in the design and monitoring of infrastructure projects is 
quite low among the African countries surveyed (question Q7B): only 11 countries out of 
22 report using these techniques. The selection of infrastructure projects seems not to be based on 
a careful and rigorous process of evaluation, and therefore needs improvement. The appraisal of infrastructure projects should also include the consultation of the 
Ministry of Finance in order to ensure the feasibility of the projects through their fiscal 
sustainability, before committing the government to any infrastructure plan. The data reports 
that more than 75% of the countries surveyed consult systematically the Ministries of Finance to 
ensure a realistic financing of infrastructure projects before committing the government 
(question Q5H). Another type of consultation could be considered during the formulating stage 
of policies and infrastructure plans. Major actors of society (civil society, private sector, industry, 
etc.) should be extensively consulted to ensure the desirability of the investments and their 
adequacy with society's needs and objectives. However, this type of consultation is less 
widespread among the sample. Of the countries surveyed, only 50% have policies based on 
extensive consultation with major actors from civil society, private sector and industry (question 
Q7F). This situation needs to be improved as public consultation is a major element which is 
becoming increasingly relevant for most African countries in order to avoid unforeseen delays in 
project implementation (CABRI, 2010c). The finality of appraisal is to ensure that the selected project will achieve value for 
money, by reviewing all the aspects already mentioned (economic, financial, environmental…). 
Box 1 below defines the concept of value for money which is actually essential to all investments 
decisions. The economy criteria can be assessed through CBA or CEA, which needs to be improved 
considering the low number of countries that report using these tools in their selection process. Regarding the criteria of efficiency in relation to selection of projects, the results are 
barely better. Eleven countries over the 22 in the sample have an objective of efficiency based on 
the  " the maximum improvement in any physical indicator per dollar spent "  (question Q7A). 7. 
CEA are preferred over CBA when it is not easy to measure cost and benefit in monetary terms directly, 
for instance in social infrastructure projects. OECD Development Centre Working Paper No.323 
DEV/DOC(2014)2 © OECD/CABRI 2014 13 Concerning effectiveness, Section IV will emphasise that the use of public funds to 
finance infrastructure is globally effective among the countries surveyed (see questions Q5). II.2 Prioritisation The prioritisation of projects 8 is part of the planning phase and forms the premise of the 
policy-making process in infrastructure. A better consistency of budget preparation/authorisation 
with development priorities could ensure higher outcomes (Dabla-Norris et al., 2011). The main 
constraint related to Prioritisation is that it is a fundamentally a political process (World Bank, 
1998). This reaffirms the need for a careful and rigorous selection and appraisal of infrastructure 
projects, consistent with the resource implications over the life of the policy. This will ensure that 
the prioritisation of infrastructure investments is actually based on objective and measurable 
benefits for the economy that match available resources. The data point to a reassuring situation. Of the countries surveyed, 82% report that the 
infrastructure projects which are implemented are those with higher priority (question Q5F). The prioritisation of projects also occurs by comparing and analysing the feasibility and 
the desirability of: @BULLET Regional and sectorial plans, 9 as opposed to @BULLET National and development plans 8. 
The survey will highlight another kind of prioritisation between current expenditures (operating and 
maintenance) and capital investments (new investments). 9. 
Regional means local plans, defined within a country. Sectorial plans refer to infrastructure priorities. Box 1. Value for money: Definition Value for money is an essential criterion to meet for any kind of investment. It is 
defined as the optimum combination of whole-life cost and quality (or fitness for purpose) to 
meet the user's requirement. It can be assessed using the criteria of economy, efficiency and 
effectiveness. Economy: Reducing the cost of resources used for an activity, with a regard for maintaining 
quality. Efficiency: Increasing output for a given input, or minimising input for a given output, with a 
regard for maintaining quality. Effectiveness: Successfully achieving the intended outcomes from an activity. Source: Jackson, P. (2012). Public financial management in infrastructure in Africa 
DEV/DOC(2014)2 14 © OECD/CABRI 2014 In this case, prioritisation refers more to a choice between levels of action. Table 1 below 
illustrates that there is no deep opposition between regional/sectorial priorities and national 
plans, and that generally the different levels of infrastructure plans overlap. Sectorial and national priorities are equally reported as key objectives by 19 countries. 
This result highlights an integrated vision of infrastructure spending at a macro level. On the 
contrary, local targets seem to be a lesser priority (with ten countries that quote them as key 
objectives), while the rationale for local infrastructure targets is that micro projects fit final users' 
needs better. According to Table 1 below, the overlapping of priorities is widespread as only six 
countries report a unique priority (either infrastructure or national) while ten countries report 
the three levels as key objectives when financing infrastructure; and six countries report that 
expenditures are closely connected to national and infrastructure priorities. Table 1. Prioritisation of infrastructure spending Q1G: What are the key objectives when financing infrastructure?

Democratic Republic of Congo, Djibouti, Rwanda II.3. Multi-year budgeting and planning The time horizon of public finances is more extended than the fiscal year in which the 
decisions are made (CABRI, 2008). This is typically the case for infrastructure projects the lifetime 
of which may lie between 1 or 2 years and 20 years. Budgeting infrastructure spending over 
several years is thus crucial to follow the life cycle of the project. But multi-year planning also 
requires ensuring the respect of fiscal discipline based on the yearly budget process and other 
medium-term resources while at the same time financing objectives defined on a longer time 
basis (World Bank, 1998; Le Houerou and Taliercio, 2002). Question Q5G of the present survey asks about the preparation of internal multi-annual 
investment plans in infrastructure from line ministries. It appears that this practice is dominant 
in Africa, with 14 out of 22 countries reporting that they have multi-year budgets. Quite 
reassuringly, only three among them do not implement verification on whether their 
infrastructure plans are compatible with Medium-term Expenditure Plans (see question Q5I). OECD Development Centre Working Paper No.323 
DEV/DOC(2014)2 © OECD/CABRI 2014 15 III. THE FINANCING OF AFRICAN INFRASTRUCTURE This second section describes how infrastructure projects are being financed in Africa. It 
first details the different financial sources for funding infrastructure. It then analyses the 
question of over versus under-spending in financing African infrastructure. III.1. The different sources of financing for infrastructure III.1.1. An overview of the different sources The sources of financing for infrastructure in Africa are various and numerous. As 
confirmed in the survey with 12 countries out of 22 considering that there are a high number of 
different fund sources for infrastructure (question Q7E). The traditional distinction opposes public to private financing. However, an additional 
distinction includes official development assistance (ODA)  " since infrastructure has been, and 
continues to be, a major business for development agencies "  (Estache, 2010). The Public Sector 
infrastructure spending represents budget and off-budget spending (including state-owned 
enterprises and extra budgetary funds). External sources or non-government financing refer to 
ODA and non-OECD financiers (China, India and the Arab states) that generally propose 
concessional funds subject to conditions and to private sector participation that has been 
dominated by public-private partnerships (PPP) over the last years. 10 Table 2 presents the respective shares of each source of financing for each infrastructure 
sector and by type of expenditure (Briceño-Garmendia, Smits and Foster, 2008). 11 Around two thirds of infrastructure spending in Africa is financed through the public 
sector. 12 A similar domination of public over external funding appears for all infrastructure 
sectors except ICT. The irrigation sector relies only on public funds to finance current and capital 
investments. 10. Concessions and privatisations are other means of private participation in infrastructure. 11. Their study includes the following countries: Benin, Cameroon, Cabo Verde, Chad, Côte d'Ivoire, 
Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya, Lesotho, Madagascar, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, Niger, Nigeria, 
Rwanda, Senegal, South Africa, Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia. 12. The Public sector finances 45% of total spending through operation and maintenance expenditures and 
an additional 20.8% through capital expenditures. Public financial management in infrastructure in Africa

Non-OECD financiers are China, India and the Arab states. 
The percentages are in terms of the total spending given in the last column. Among external sources, the participation of the private sector is the highest with 20.8% 
of total infrastructure spending, occurring in financing capital expenditures. The rest of capital 
expenditures are financed by ODA and non-OECD financiers with respectively 7.9% and 5.5% of 
total spending. The WSS sector exhibits a similar ranking of sources. ODA is the second source of 
financing transport capital expenditures, followed by non-OECD financiers ex-aequo with the 
private sector. In the power sector, non-OECD financiers are the second source of financing, 
followed by ODA and the private sector. It is noteworthy that current expenditures (operation and maintenance) taken as a whole 
are only funded through the public sector, while capital expenditures are dominated by external 
financing. Also notice that capital expenditures represent a larger share of total spending, 
illustrating the typical capital bias in infrastructure that favours new investments over the 
operating and maintenance expenditure. Here again, the pattern differs according to each 
infrastructure sector. For instance, the power and irrigation sector are not affected by the capital 
bias as their respective shares of operation and maintenance expenditures are both around 60%. 
On the contrary, the bias is even more marked for the ICT and the WSS sectors. III.1.2. Private participation: Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) The rationale for private-sector involvement in infrastructure covers four dimensions 
(OECD, 2013): @BULLET improving value for money in public service delivery, by delivering an equivalent 
quality of public services but at a lower cost; @BULLET sharing risk to ensure that the public and private sectors support the risks for which 
they are better suited; @BULLET introducing competitive pressures through tendering process; @BULLET bringing in additional funds with the access to equity markets. OECD Development Centre Working Paper No.323 
DEV/DOC(2014)2 © OECD/CABRI 2014 17 The degree of private financing for infrastructure projects and thus the final form of this 
participation depends on the level of risk transferred from the public to the private sector, the 
ownership of assets and the bundling of construction and operation (OECD, 2008; Engel et al., 
2009). At the end of the scope, with the higher exposure to risk, privatisation allows the private 
entity to buy an equity stake in the state-owned utility and receive the associated residual 
returns. Over recent years, the main form of private participation in financing infrastructure has 
been through public-private partnerships (PPPs). Box 2 below summarises a definition of PPPs 
(CABRI, 2010b). Box 2. Public-Private Partnerships (PPP) in infrastructure PPPs refer to arrangements in which the private sector supplies infrastructure assets 
and services that have traditionally been provided by the government. Although there is no clear-cut definition of a PPP, most definitions include three key 
characteristics: @BULLET private execution and financing of public investment; @BULLET an emphasis on both investment and service provision by the private sector; and @BULLET risk transfer from the government to the private sector. PPPs appear to be particularly well suited to providing economic infrastructure, 
primarily for three reasons: 1. sound projects that address clear bottlenecks in the road, railway, ports, power 
and other key sectors are likely to have high economic rates of return and, 
therefore, to be attractive to the private sector; 2. the private sector can be made responsible not only for construction but also for 
service provision; and 3. to the extent that these services are supplied directly to final users, charging is 
both feasible and, from an efficiency standpoint, desirable. Source: CABRI (2010b),  " Ensuring Value for Money in Infrastructure in Africa, Report 2, Financing Infrastructure 
Projects " . Public financial management in infrastructure in Africa 
DEV/DOC(2014)2 18 © OECD/CABRI 2014 Despite their growing use over the last two decades across developing countries in general 
and African countries in particular, there is still no consensus on whether or not PPPs in 
infrastructure are good or bad for developing countries (Mukhopadhyay, 2011; Patel & Bhattacharya, 
2010; Joasiah et al., 2010; Estache, 2006; Estache & Wren-Lewis, 2009 and 2010; Jerome, 2008). III.1.3. Other external sources The other sources of non-government financing of infrastructure concern project funding 
from development partners, through grants that mainly finance  " social "  infrastructure (hospitals, 
schools and water services); and concessional loans that fund  " economic "  infrastructure (CABRI, 
2010b). Leaving aside the traditional debate on aid effectiveness, financing of infrastructure 
projects by development agencies and partners (either multilateral or bilateral) may suffer from 
the same weaknesses as public funding. Aid would prove to be inefficient in tackling issues 
related to weak implementation and management capacity, non-transparent procurement 
practices and inadequate attention to maintenance and operations. Specific measures have been recommended by donors to improve project planning and 
execution during the construction phase. Lack of capacity in implementation and management is 
dealt with by providing technical assistance and administrative support in addition to financing. 
Donors also prefer to apply their own procedures rather than those of the beneficiary country. 
However, as seen in Table 2, current expenditures of operation and maintenance are financed 
exclusively through the public sector, leading to a deterioration of assets after the external 
sources of financing have delivered the infrastructure. III.2. Over versus under-spending The issues of under and over-spending in infrastructure are analysed in questions Q1A to 
Q1F. Under-spending concerns a situation in which spending is actually below the target 
indicated in the planning budget, while over-spending refers to an actual disbursement that is 
over the target. Out of the 22 surveyed countries, 15 report an under-spending in infrastructure. Among 
them, only three (DRC, Madagascar and São Tomé and Príncipe) do not have corresponding 
reforms already in place and/or in the pipeline, meaning that this specific issue is generally 
identified by governments and that there is a will to improve it. The questionnaire then asks respondents why there is under/over-spending in 
infrastructure projects. 13 Table 3 below synthesises the answers. The most quoted reason is the 
lack of resources, reported by six countries. 14 The second main reason is a lack of capacity in the 
earlier stages of infrastructure projects. Coupled together, they lead to a situation where 
improper objectives match inappropriate resources. Better design and project definitions are 13. Notice that even those that do not report one or the other issue can answer. 14. Rwanda is classified in this first reason but reports actually an issue on the predictability of resources 
from donors. OECD Development Centre Working Paper No.323 
DEV/DOC(2014)2 © OECD/CABRI 2014 19 therefore needed to state realistic targets, for instance through Cost-Benefit (BBA) and/or Cost-
Effectiveness Analyses (CEA). The first section showed that only 10 countries out of 22 use CBA 
and/or CEA to design and monitor their infrastructure projects (Q7B). Concerning the matching 
of targets with resources, question Q5E illustrates this is a critical issue as infrastructure projects 
are designed to match the available funds at the planning stage only in 10 of 22 countries. Table 3. The reasons for under-spending Q1B/C: Why do you think there is under-spending in infrastructure projects? Lack of resources DRC, Gambia, Madagascar, São Tomé and Príncipe, Sudan,

definition 
Benin, Cameroon, Kenya, Lesotho, Mauritius Lack of capacity in implementation 
Namibia, Burundi , Lesotho Legal issues and procurement 
Benin, Kenya, Mauritius, Niger In Sierra Leone, the issue of under-spending is related to the post-conflict situation that 
paid more attention to rebuilding social rather than economic infrastructure. But a shift in trend 
has been occurring since 2007 with a greater emphasis on roads, water and energy. Botswana, Cabo Verde, Morocco and Tunisia suffer from an over-spending in 
infrastructure. For Cabo Verde and Morocco, over-spending relates to past and on-going large 
infrastructure projects at the national level. In Botswana and Tunisia, over-spending stems from 
a lack of proper project planning and a correct evaluation of costs (to prevent overruns), and 
issues in legal and procurement frameworks that prolong the execution phase (with the corollary 
issues of exchange rate and inflation impact). These four countries already have reforms on-going or foreseen to avoid over-spending, 
highlighting the willingness of governments to tackle this issue. Djibouti and Sudan both report issues of under AND over-spending. For Sudan, the 
former is due to a lack of sufficient resources and the latter occurs in some projects due to a long 
period of implementation, price escalation of materials and other delays for security reasons. 
Chad and Kenya report that their infrastructures are affected by neither under or over-spending 
in infrastructures. Public financial management in infrastructure in Africa 
DEV/DOC(2014)2 20 © OECD/CABRI 2014 IV. INSTITUTIONAL ARCHITECTURE FOR FINANCING 
INFRASTRUCTURE As shown in Table 2, public sector financing represents the larger source of funds for 
infrastructure projects. This Section thus details the way in which governments use the different 
sources of public funds. The first sub-section presents the question of revenue mobilisation and 
the associated issue of managing deficits. IV.1. Revenue mobilisation and financing through deficit Revenue mobilisation is actually the first predictable and sustainable source of financing 
for development and creates budgetary space to finance priority expenditures (Banque de 
France, 2011). As already stated in Section I, infrastructure projects generally last more than the 
fiscal year in which the decisions are made, creating a need to manage the financing through 
deficit to prevent debt from accumulating. Question Q1G first investigates these notions of revenue mobilisation and their adequacy 
with targets, by asking whether closely linking expenditures to revenues is a key objective when 
financing infrastructure. Indeed, one of the main issues in financing infrastructure is the 
feasibility of the project that relies on the availability and mobilisation of funds. Ten countries 
out of the 22 surveyed report linking revenues to expenditures as a key objective, emphasising 
that the question of revenue mobilisation is not widely taken into account in Africa. However, as Section IV will review, other modalities of revenue mobilisation and the 
management of financing through deficits have better indicators in Africa, as summarised in 
Figure 1 below. OECD Development Centre Working Paper No.323 
DEV/DOC(2014)2 © OECD/CABRI 2014 21 Figure 1. Revenue mobilisation IV.2. The institutional architecture of public funds After reviewing the different potential sources of infrastructure financing in the previous 
sub-section, here we detail the ways in which public funds for infrastructure are used among the 
22 African countries of the survey. The survey only asks about public funds which are relevant in 
a framework where two thirds of infrastructure spending is financed through public funds. The survey investigates three axes of segmentation to distinguish between the origins of 
public funds. 1. general, earmarked and off-budget funds (questions Q2A to Q2F) 2. central versus local funds (questions Q3A to Q3F) 3. budget versus specialised institutions (questions Q4A to Q4F) IV.2.1 General, earmarked and off-budgets funds General funds are defined in the budget contrary to off-budget funds that are special 
funds owned by the government but are not part of the budget. Earmarked funds are attached to 
a requirement that devotes a source of revenue to a specific public expenditure. Figure 2 summarises the origins of public funds according to this distinction. All the 
countries in the survey finance infrastructure through general funds in whole or in part, but half 
of the countries have only this source of funds. The use of off-budget funds is the scarcer one 
(7 countries out of 22). The use of earmarked funds is widespread with ten countries reporting 
this source as a way to finance infrastructure. 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 22 Q5H Systmatic

DEV/DOC(2014)2 22 © OECD/CABRI 2014 Figure 2. Distribution between general, earmarked and off-budget funds All the surveyed countries report an increasing amount of financing through general 
funds over the last ten years. All the countries also describe as positive the functioning of this 
financing. Nonetheless, 15 countries report the existence of on-going or foreseen reforms to 
improve the financing through general funds. And all countries except two (Botswana and 
Niger) would also make proposals for reforms. This emphasises the fact that the increasing 
amounts of money provided by general funds are being given particular attention by 
governments in order to ensure the efficiency and effectiveness of expenditures. The question is whether the predominance of this source of funds is a positive 
characteristic or not. The African road sector is a typical example of the debate on whether or not 
funds should be earmarked to finance infrastructure spending. Proponents of earmarked funds 
claim that this scheme reduces bureaucracy (and corruption), leads to speedy completion of 
projects, and reduces construction costs (Beuran, Castaing and Rablland, 2013). Earmarked funds 
are also supposed to increase stability in the sector by preventing a reallocation of resources 
during the project process due to a recession episode for instance that could lead to a disruption 
in the execution of the infrastructure investment. As an illustration of the positive use of earmarked funds, a large number of countries 
(ten) also use them in addition to general funds to finance infrastructure spending. Among them, 
eight countries report an increasing trend in the amount of financing through this specific kind of 
fund over the last ten years. The same eight countries describe as positive the functioning of 
financing infrastructure through earmarked funds. Nevertheless, they still have ongoing and/or 
foreseen reforms to improve this source of financing. Lesotho and Sudan do not describe the functioning of earmarked funds as positive but 
they are also the only two countries without an increasing amount of financing through this 50% 18% 5% 27% General funds only General & Earmarked funds General & off-budget funds General & Earmarked & off-budget funds Botswana, Burundi, Cameroon, Chad, Djibouti, Madagascar, Mauritius,

DEV/DOC(2014)2 © OECD/CABRI 2014 23 specific source. 15 Only Sudan has on-going or foreseen reforms to improve the functioning of 
earmarked funds as a source of infrastructure financing. Namibia and Niger do not use earmarked funds to finance infrastructure but consider as 
positive the functioning of this source of financing. This belief is specifically illustrated in 
Namibia where reforms are ongoing and/or foreseen to improve the financing of infrastructure 
through earmarked funds. Off-budget funds are rarely used for infrastructure spending in Africa as only seven 
countries out of the 22 surveyed finance infrastructure through government funds not reported 
in the budget. Over the last ten years, the trend in the amount of financing infrastructure through 
off-budget funds has been increasing in four out of the seven countries. 16 Yet, only three of them 
(Morocco, Tunisia and Zimbabwe) describe as positive the functioning of off-budget 
infrastructure financing. Among the remaining four countries that use off-budget funds but 
consider its functioning as negative, only DRC has on-going and/or foreseen reforms to improve 
it. Among the other countries that do not actually finance infrastructure through off-budget 
funds, Cameroon, Djibouti and Namibia consider off-budget funds as positively functioning and 
also have reforms in the pipeline to improve this source of financing. Whatever the composition of the portfolio of fund sources, general funds are mainly used 
to finance new investments. Maintenance expenditures are financed through general funds in 
only six countries (Benin, Madagascar, Morocco, Rwanda, Sierra Leone and Zimbabwe), while 
current expenditures are even less quoted as a destination item for general funds (Burundi, 
Namibia and Sierra Leone). Similar patterns appear for earmarked funds even though the pre-eminence of new 
investments is less pronounced. Six countries out of the ten that use earmarked funds to finance 
infrastructure dedicate these funds to new investments. Rwanda also used earmarked funds to 
finance maintenance expenditures, as well as three other countries. 17 While Djibouti does not use 
earmarked funds to finance infrastructure, it would potentially dedicate them to financing 
maintenance. Namibia and São Tomé and Príncipe also would use earmarked funds to finance 
current expenditures. Among the seven countries that finance infrastructure through off-budget funds, new 
investments and maintenance are equally quoted as destination items. 18 Among the countries 
that actually use off-budgets funds for infrastructure, only Kenya dedicates this source of 
financing to current expenditures. However, if we include those countries that do not effectively 
rely on off-budget funds (but yet answer question Q2F), the distribution of funds between the 
different investments puts new investments and current expenditures on top: Cameroon and São 
Tomé and Príncipe would allocate off-budget funds to new investments and Djibouti and 
Namibia to current expenditures. 15. Lesotho reports a stable trend; Kenya and Rwanda a decreasing one. 16. Negative for Kenya and stable for Lesotho. 17. Lesotho does not report to what kind of expenditures it dedicates earmarked funds. 18. DRC and Morocco for new investments; Tunisia and Zimbabwe for maintenance; Rwanda for both. Public financial management in infrastructure in Africa 
DEV/DOC(2014)2 24 © OECD/CABRI 2014 The distribution of funds between the different types of infrastructure spending 
illustrates quite well the issue of a capital bias that disfavours operation expenditures in 
infrastructure against more  " visible "  investments .19 It emphasises the issue of a lack of resources 
for maintenance that hampers the good functioning and delivery of infrastructure services in 
Africa. Institutional reforms are needed to place more emphasis on current expenditures and 
maintenance rather than on new investments. IV.2.2 Central versus local funds The opposition between central and local funds rests upon the idea that local budgets 
may be more relevant to finance infrastructure projects as they peg more closely to local 
priorities. However, the lack of available resources at the local level may hamper the 
effectiveness of this source of financing (World Bank, 2010); and in particular in developing 
countries (Glaeser, 2013). Despite the expectation that decentralisation of public investments 
should deliver greater efficiency in the provision of public goods and services, empirical 
evidence points to difficulties in achieving this objective (de Mello, 2010). This is typically the 
case in Burundi where resource allocation to local budgets is too weak to finance decentralised 
infrastructure (question Q7L). Centralisation of decision-making powers during budget 
formulation can also be preferred to ensure fiscal discipline (CABRI, 2008). The great majority of the surveyed countries (12) finance their infrastructure spending 
through a mix between central and local budgets. The ten remaining countries use only central 
budgets as a source of funds for infrastructure investments. Over the last ten years, the trend in the amount of financing through central AND local 
budgets has been increasing in almost all countries. Decreasing and stable trends have concerned 
financing through local budgets only and happened in four countries: Botswana, Madagascar 
and Zimbabwe (decreasing), and Lesotho (stable). The functioning of each mode of financing is described as positive as a whole. Only 
Botswana, Madagascar and Zimbabwe report a negative functioning for local budgets that is 
consistent with the decreasing trend highlighted in the previous question. All countries except three 20 have on-going and foreseen reforms to improve financing 
through both central and local budgets. While considered as positively functioning globally, the 
two modes of financing may still be improved so as to reach the highest levels in effectiveness 
and efficiency in delivery infrastructure items. In 18 countries out of 22, central budget funds finance new investments. The exceptions 
are Namibia where central budgets finance current expenditures, Sierra Leone where central 19. This is an issue typical of the African infrastructure sector as will be showed in the following analyses 
of central versus local funds, and budget versus specialised institutions. 20. Madagascar and São Tomé and Príncipe have no reforms for the two modes of financing; Sierra Leone 
has reforms for financing through central budgets only. OECD Development Centre Working Paper No.323 
DEV/DOC(2014)2 © OECD/CABRI 2014 25 budgets finance maintenance, current expenditures and new investments and Zimbabwe where 
central funds are used to ensure maintenance needs. Note that Zimbabwe reports maintenance 
for both central and local budget use. Apart from Sierra Leone and Zimbabwe, maintenance is 
financed only through local budgets and in only four countries (Burundi, Kenya, Morocco and 
São Tomé and Príncipe). In the other countries that finance infrastructure through local budgets, 
new investments again constitute the bulk of expenditures. The capital bias against current and maintenance expenditures highlighted in the 
previous sub-section on the distinction between general funds versus earmarked and off-budget 
funds is confirmed here. IV.2.3. Budget versus specialised institutions The last opposition in funds source for infrastructure spending investigated in the survey 
concerns financing through: @BULLET Budget institutions such as the Ministries of Finance or Infrastructure as opposed to @BULLET Specialised institutions, defined in the survey as state-owned-company, regulatory 
agency, external board fund to the Ministry of Finance/Infrastructure. Djibouti, Morocco, Rwanda, Sierra Leone finance infrastructure spending through 
specialised institutions only. The rest of the countries all use budget institutions with a similar 
share between budget only (nine countries) and a budget-specialised institutions mix (nine 
countries). Table 4 below presents the distribution of countries according to each composition of 
fund sources. Table 4. Budget versus specialised institutions Q4A: Is infrastructure financed through budget institutions and/or specialised institutions? Budget institutions only

institutions. Out of 22 countries, 16 describe as positive the functioning of financing infrastructure 
through budget and specialised institutions. The three exceptions concern Djibouti and DRC for 
specialised institutions and Kenya for budget, consistent with the decreasing trend in the amount Public financial management in infrastructure in Africa 
DEV/DOC(2014)2 26 © OECD/CABRI 2014 to finance infrastructure for the last two. 21 Although Kenya has a negative functioning of 
financing infrastructure through specialised institutions, and is the only country without on— 
going or foreseen reforms to improve it, all the other countries, on the contrary, are undertaking 
such reforms or have these in the pipeline. Whatever the source of financing, new investments are once again the first destination 
items. Burundi and Kenya finance maintenance through specialised budgets, while Benin and 
Tunisia use budget institutions. Finally, Zimbabwe's budget and specialised institutions both 
finance maintenance. Namibia, Rwanda and Sierra Leone are the only countries to report the 
financing of current expenditures. Here again the capital bias that favours new investments against current and 
maintenance operations is emphasised. 21. DRC and Kenya appear regularly as exceptions in the report. Appendix 4 provides a specific summary 
of these countries' situations. OECD Development Centre Working Paper No.323 
DEV/DOC(2014)2 © OECD/CABRI 2014 27 V. ROLE OF GOVERNMENTS IN THE USE OF PUBLIC FUNDS This last section questions how the role of governments should be evaluated in the use of 
public funds for infrastructure financing. Three specific notions are under consideration for 
evaluation in the survey: 1. The effectiveness of governments in using public funds for infrastructure financing, 
which compares the actual achievements to the initial targets defined in the 
infrastructure projects. 2. Fiscal prudence which measures whether fiscal rules related to infrastructure 
financing are appropriate to support and achieve the project objectives without 
causing a fiscal crisis. 3. The efficiency of governments in using public funds for infrastructure financing, 
which compares the actual achievements to the initial resources, devoted to the 
infrastructure projects. V.1. Is public financing of infrastructure effective in Africa? As explained earlier, the notion of effectiveness measures the differences between the 
objectives targeted and the results actually achieved. The first way to achieve effectiveness is therefore to state credible, sustainable and 
quantifiable objectives in the first stages of the project. Defining precise and quantifiable targets 
provides tools and indicators to measure the degree of effectiveness of public funds. Measuring 
effectiveness then stems from monitoring the progress in the fulfilment of the objectives. In these respects, among the 22 surveyed countries, the use of public funds to finance 
infrastructure is globally effective. In 17 countries, the national infrastructure policy is 
formulated in terms of specific targets against which achievements in the use of funds can be 
measured (question Q5C). The monitoring of target achievements is quite widespread in Africa 
as 14 countries out of 22 in the survey report using this process (question Q5D). Moreover, the 
great majority of countries (with 18 out of 22) primarily implement the infrastructure projects 
with the highest priority, meaning that the most important targets are supposed to be achieved 
first (question Q5F). The effectiveness of governments in using public funds to finance infrastructure is also 
questioned through the existence of alternative means to achieve the same objectives. To some Public financial management in infrastructure in Africa 
DEV/DOC(2014)2 28 © OECD/CABRI 2014 extent, the effectiveness of this financing mode is weakened according to the answers to 
questions Q5A and Q5B. Only seven countries consider that funds for financing infrastructure 
based on public resources could not be available through other means (question Q5A) and 
16 countries think the same objectives could have been achieved through policy reforms 
(question Q5B). However, this last point is not a concrete re-assessment of public action in 
infrastructure: it emphasises the fact that governments may have other means at their disposal 
than direct funding to achieve infrastructure targets. Globally, governments of African countries have an effective use of public funds to 
finance infrastructure. Among them, Benin, Madagascar, Namibia, Niger, Rwanda and Sierra 
Leone perform the best while Kenya and Zimbabwe report no positive indicator of effectiveness 
as measured in the survey. V.2. Does public financing of infrastructure in Africa follow the rules of fiscal 
prudence? Fiscal prudence policies aim at maintaining proper balance between borrowing, 
expenditure and saving in order to support economic growth and achieve other social objectives 
in a sustainable way. Fiscal prudence is assessed through seven questions in the survey, classified in three 
larger modalities as presented in Table 5 below: Table 5. Fiscal prudence Fiscal Prudence modalities 
Questions 
Centralisation of revenue collection 
Q6D: Is all revenue collection in infra carried out by the same authority? Generalisation of rules 
Q6A: Are all the funds sources subject to the same fiscal discipline? Q6B: Are earmarked and off-budget funds allocation rules required to be 
as close as possible to those for budget funds? Q6E: Do national procurement laws apply to all infrastructure funds? Controls and monitoring 
Q6C: Is infrastructure spending subject to control to avoid quasi-fiscal 
deficit? 22 Q6F: Is infrastructure spending subject to audit? Q6G: Is infrastructure spending subject to ex-post reporting? The centralisation of revenue collection is dominant in the African countries of the survey 
with 15 countries out of 22 having all revenue collection carried out by the same authority. It is a 
first step towards ensuring fiscal prudence as in one snapshot, the authority in charge knows 
what the total available resources are. 22. Central bank imbalances between costs and revenues create deficits often not reflected in the budget. OECD Development Centre Working Paper No.323 
DEV/DOC(2014)2 © OECD/CABRI 2014 29 The second modality of fiscal prudence is the application of the same laws and fiscal 
discipline to all sources of funding. Here again, African countries apply fiscal prudence rules 
widely. Only three countries do not impose the same fiscal discipline on all the fund sources and 
only seven countries out of 22 do not require allocation rules for earmarked and off-budget funds 
as close as possible to those for budget funds. Finally, 18 countries out of 22 apply national 
procurement laws to all infrastructure funds. The last modality of fiscal prudence concerns the controls imposed on infrastructure 
spending. Also on this modality African countries globally report good practices. Indeed, 
infrastructure spending is subject to control to avoid quasi-fiscal deficit in 14 countries out of 22, 
to audit in 19 countries and to ex post reporting in 18 countries. Globally in Africa, the rules of fiscal prudence are well established but they could be 
improved in four countries: Chad, the Democratic Republic of Congo and São Tomé and Príncipe 
report only three modalities out of the seven considered and Kenya has none of them. The best 
practices are found in Djibouti, Gambia, Madagascar, Mauritius, Niger and Sudan with the seven 
modalities encountered and in Zimbabwe with six modalities. V.3. Is public financing of infrastructure efficient in Africa? The notion of efficiency in the use of public funds for infrastructure financing compares 
the results of the spending to the initial resources mobilised for the said infrastructure. The role of the government here is therefore to first provide adequate resources to achieve 
the infrastructure targets and to design the projects properly so as to ensure their efficiency. 
During the different phases of the project, the role of the government is also to gather 
information on whether and how the funds are actually used. This monitoring exercise is 
needed in order to adapt the subsequent spending to the resources still available and to ensure 
delivery of the highest priority items. Globally, governments of African countries are efficient in the use of public funds for 
infrastructure spending even if the funds spent for infrastructure are close to those collected in 
only five countries (question Q7I). This specific result confirms the alarming situation regarding 
the match between available resources and the definition of objectives in the planning stage 
illustrated in question Q5E: infrastructure projects are designed to match the available funds at 
the planning stage only in 10 out of 22. Other aspects of efficiency are however present in half or more of the surveyed countries. 
For instance, the monitoring of expenditures, information on available resources and the 
adaptation of the remaining resources to the core objectives are well established. It is relatively 
easy to track expenditures by category to identify cost overruns and/or issues in delivery for 16 
countries out of 22 (question Q7H). Half of the surveyed countries use accrual-based information 
to report investments expenditures (question Q7J). This method helps to improve effectiveness 
as it allows considering money as an expense even if it is not actually paid. Consequently, it 
prevents over-spending when using money not already paid but intended for another expense. Public financial management in infrastructure in Africa 
DEV/DOC(2014)2 30 © OECD/CABRI 2014 In 18 countries, even when funds are insufficient for the project, the highest priority items are 
included so as to meet the main objectives with the available resource (question Q7G). Seventeen countries integrate all public funds in infrastructure in the public finance system 
(question Q7C). This is a source of efficiency as it allows knowing in one snapshot what the total available 
resources are to direct funds to the achievement of infrastructure projects' targets. Gambia, Madagascar, Rwanda and Tunisia perform the best whereas Kenya has the worst 
measures here again. The survey also asked directly what the major sources of inefficiency were in the use of 
public funds for infrastructure spending (Q7K, see Table 6). Inattention to maintenance and the 
issue of hidden costs 23 were quite equally reported by respectively 17 and 16 countries. Failure to 
spend budgeted funds is quoted by 11 countries. Nine countries quote the three sources as major, 
while Sudan 24 and Tunisia do not report any of the three. Table 6. Sources of inefficiency Q7K: What are the major sources of inefficiency in infrastructure? Inattention to maintenance

Botswana, Benin, Burundi, Cameroon, Cabo Verde, Djibouti, Gambia, 
Kenya, Lesotho, Madagascar, Mauritius, Morocco, Namibia, Sierra 
Leone, Tunisia, Zimbabwe The issue of maintenance is long lasting and common to all infrastructure sectors in 
Africa. The legacy of underfunding maintenance is resulting in the need for rehabilitation of 
about 30% of a typical African country's infrastructure assets (World Bank, 2010). Although 
identified for a while, the issue of proper maintenance is crowded-out by a capital bias that 
favours new and visible investments. The issue of hidden costs requires improvements in different stages of the infrastructure 
plan. Under-pricing should be avoided thanks to more attention in the planning and design 
phases of the project, while under-collection and excessive technical losses relate to the execution 
stage of the project. 23. Hidden costs stand for: i) under-pricing where charging is below economic costs of the goods; 
ii) under-collection where bills are never sent or allowed to go unpaid; iii) excessive technical 
losses such as leaks, thefts). 24. In Sudan, the main issue is an insufficient availability of resources inherited from the post-conflict 
situation. OECD Development Centre Working Paper No.323 
DEV/DOC(2014)2 © OECD/CABRI 2014 31 VI. CONCLUSION Public financing of infrastructure accounts for two thirds of the total amount of 
infrastructure spending in Africa. Given the crucial role of infrastructure for economic 
development, growth and poverty reduction, the report used a qualitative survey implemented 
in 22 African countries to ask whether or not budgetary processes and institutions in Africa are 
hampering infrastructural development. The key findings of the report are the following: 1. The selection of projects could be improved. In particular the process of appraisal 
needs a more extensive use of Cost-Benefit and/or Cost-Effectiveness Analyses; the 
selection of projects is not sufficiently based on the improvements of physical 
indicators; civil society is generally not consulted. As highlighted in numerous reports and papers, the selection phase of an infrastructure 
project is crucial to ensure its viability. The selection of a project should ideally rely on a rigorous 
and careful appraisal of the investment that compares its specific attributes between costs and 
benefits. In the same vein, the selection should be based on objective measurements and 
objectives. The selection should also integrate a consultation of all the economic and social actors 
of the society in order to ensure the desirability of a project. These particular points still need to be improved in Africa according to the survey. Fewer 
than half of the countries surveyed report using Cost-Benefit Analysis and/or Cost-Effectiveness 
Analysis in their selection and design process of infrastructure projects. Only 50% of the 
surveyed countries select their infrastructure projects with a view to obtaining the maximum 
improvement in any physical indicator per dollar spent. Finally, the same low proportion of 
countries has an extensive consultation with civil society and the private sector to exchange 
about infrastructure policies. 2. Highest priority projects are implemented first and the different plan levels 
(national, sectorial, local) generally overlap even though local objectives are given 
less priority. The concept of prioritisation is widely understood as the great majority of the surveyed 
countries report implementing the highest priority projects first. Concerning prioritisation 
between different plan levels (national, sectorial, regional), the results show that there is no deep 
opposition between regional/sectorial priorities and national plans, and that they generally 
overlap. Yet the survey yet shows that local priorities are lagging behind, possibly due to a lack 
of resources at the decentralised level. Public financial management in infrastructure in Africa 
DEV/DOC(2014)2 32 © OECD/CABRI 2014 3. The sources of finance infrastructure are various and numerous, but public funds 
represent the bulk of it. The growing trend in the amounts spent over the last ten 
years is consistent with the overall positive functioning of this mode of financing. 
The main challenge is now to circumvent the capital bias that tends to favour new 
investments over operation and maintenance expenditures. Public funds are mostly from general and central funds and transit through budget 
institutions. They mainly finance new investments in the survey. This illustrates the typical 
capital bias issue that tends to disfavour operation and maintenance expenditures against more 
 " visible "  investments. Public sector financing in Africa is globally described as positively functioning, with a 
general increasing trend in the amounts spent over the last ten years. Nonetheless, there is a clear 
willingness to achieve even more efficient and effective financing of infrastructure through on-
going and/or foreseen reforms. 4. Regarding how African governments use public funds for infrastructure financing, 
the survey underlines the fact that their action is overall effective, efficient and 
subject to the rules of fiscal prudence. The majority of the countries surveyed show a close link between the initial infrastructure 
projects' objectives and the actual realisations, thanks to statements of credible and quantifiable 
targets and the monitoring of their achievement in national infrastructure policy. Effectiveness in infrastructure spending in Africa stems from three modalities according 
to the survey. First, the formulation of infrastructure policy in terms of specific targets against 
which achievements in the use of funds can be measured. Second, the monitoring of targets 
achievements. Third, the implementation of highest priority projects. Efficiency in infrastructure spending in Africa is related to the monitoring of 
expenditures, the control of information on available resources and the adaptation of the 
remaining resources to the core objectives Finally, fiscal prudence rules are found in the centralisation of revenue collection by the 
same authority, the application of the same fiscal rules to all the sources of funds and the use of 
controls and audits. 5. Despite the general optimistic situation described above, some specific aspects 
deserve more attention in order to achieve greater value for money in 
infrastructure spending. In the planning stage, a careful use of economic, financial, 
social and environmental appraisal would ensure the feasibility and the 
desirability of the projects. Inefficiencies related to the inadequate attention to 
maintenance require a change in political objectives for infrastructure spending at 
the planning and budgeting phases. OECD Development Centre Working Paper No.323 
DEV/DOC(2014)2 © OECD/CABRI 2014 33 As already emphasised, the selection and design stages of infrastructure projects deserve 
more attention so as to balance properly targets and resources. These stages are moreover 
essential in order to provide better estimates that will prevent under-pricing. In particular, 
developing the use of Cost-Benefit Analysis and/or Cost-Effectiveness Analysis is a crucial need. As inattention to maintenance is described as the major source of inefficiency in 
infrastructure spending, a greater emphasis on this specific expenditure is needed to circumvent 
the capital bias hampering all infrastructure sectors in Africa. The other major source of inefficiency is related to hidden cost issues and requires 
stronger capacities in the collection process and in controlling the execution/construction stages. Public financial management in infrastructure in Africa

DEV/DOC(2014)2 © OECD/CABRI 2014 37 APPENDIX 1: ABOUT CABRI The Collaborative Africa Budget Reform Initiative (CABRI) is a professional network of 
senior budget officials of African Ministries of finance and/or Planning. CABRI was officially 
launched on 14 May 2008 in Maputo, Mozambique. On 3 December 2009, CABRI became a legal 
and independent membership-based organisation. CABRI aims to promote efficient and effective management of public finances in Africa. 
Specifically, the network seeks to: @BULLET support senior budget officials in the management of public finance systems by 
developing appropriate approaches, procedures and practices; @BULLET advance the development of member states by building capacity and promoting 
training and research in the field of public finance management in particular from a 
practitioner's perspective; and @BULLET develop and promote common African positions on budget-related issues of interest 
to Africa. Public financial management in infrastructure in Africa 
DEV/DOC(2014)2 38 © OECD/CABRI 2014 APPENDIX 2: QUESTIONNAIRE OECD Development Centre Survey on 
PFM in Infrastructure (2011) The questionnaire should be completed by the Ministry of Finance. In addition, if necessary, the 
document can be complemented with input from other key ministries such as Infrastructure, Energy, 
Water and Sanitation, Transport and Telecommunications. Survey Respondent Country: Name: Title: Institution: Email: Telephone: Objectives of the questionnaire The aim of this OECD Development Centre-CABRI questionnaire is to have a better understanding of the 
role of budgetary institutions in infrastructure in Africa. The results will: i) be shared at the OECD 
Development Centre-Development Finance Network (DeFiNe) Global Forum on Development, taking 
place in Paris in 2011; ii) be shared at an interactive seminar during CABRI meetings in 2012; and iii) lead 
to a joint OECD Development Centre-CABRI publication. The survey is sent for completion to members 
of the OECD Development Centre Governing Board (Cabo Verde, Egypt, Mauritius, Morocco, Senegal, 
South Africa) and CABRI established partners on infrastructure (Rwanda, Mozambique). This work comes under the broader OECD Development Centre framework on the cross-regional analysis 
of public policies related to infrastructure and the interactions among major actors in the infrastructure 
policy-making process (PMP). It also extends the 2008 OECD/CABRI Budgetary Practices and Procedures 
Survey in African countries and the on-going work of CABRI on capacity building in Private-Public 
Partnership (PPP) units at Finance ministries in Africa. Problem statement CABRI, OECD, IMF and World Bank's work on budgetary practices and procedures across different 
regions in the world have highlighted their complex and heterogeneous role in fiscal consolidation. This 
work aims at extending that analytical framework by focusing on how institutions shape the infrastructure 
cycle's policy making process which is characterised by timelines that exceed both budgetary and political 
cycles. OECD Development Centre Working Paper No.323 
DEV/DOC(2014)2 © OECD/CABRI 2014 39 Budgetary institutions are often characterised by their degree of flexibility, transparency, centralisation, 
legislative participation, and use of performance information and sustainability. How does this budgetary 
setting relate to public investment in infrastructure which has been increasing in Africa since the 2000s? 
Key issues that deserve special attention are financing from general versus earmarked funds and off-
budgets funds, expenditure from central versus local budgets and the use of government departments, 
specialised agencies (for example, a regulatory agency or public utility). We also explore how the role of 
the government can be evaluated in the use of public funds for infrastructure financing in terms of 
effectiveness, fiscal prudence and efficiency. The questionnaire is organised as follows: Section 1. How should the role of government be organised in the use of public funds for 
infrastructure financing? 
Q1. Over-spending and under-spending in infrastructure 
Q2. General, earmarked versus off-budget funds 
Q3. Central versus local funds

Under versus Over-Spending Question 
Answer Q1A During the last 10 years has 
there 
been 
under/over-
spending in infrastructure? Under-spending Q1D Why do you think there is 
under-spending 
in 
infrastructure projects? This is answered mainly with reference to the water and sanitation 
sectors. The project design is usually overambitious with regard to 
timeframes and the management of infrastructure projects requires 
technically capacity for planning and managing large tenders, which is 
not usually available. Most large projects depend on external TA and so 
limited local capacity is developed. Q1F Are there reforms already in 
place or in the pipeline to 
avoid under-spending in 
infrastructure projects? Yes Public financial management in infrastructure in Africa

DEV/DOC(2014)2 © OECD/CABRI 2014 69 APPENDIX 4: FOCUS ON THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF CONGO 
AND KENYA Among the 22 countries surveyed, DRC and Kenya appears as regular exceptions through 
the different data sections. This appendix summarises their specificities. DRC Regarding the functioning of the system as a whole, DRC performs relatively bad as 
opposed to the other countries in the survey. Focusing on the role of governments in the use of 
public funds, public spending in infrastructure in DRC seems not neither effective nor efficient: 
the data report only 2 positive indicators for section 5 in the survey and none for section 7. A 
similar alarming situation appears for fiscal prudence with only 3 positive indicators. Other specificities for this country concern particular characteristic related to: @BULLET the absence or presence of reforms to circumvent respectively under-spending and 
the improvement of off-budgets' functioning, @BULLET the negative functioning of specialised institutions, associated with a decreasing 
trend in the amounts spent through these institutions. Kenya The situation of Kenya regarding how governments use of public funds to finance 
infrastructure is even worse than the DRC's results. Whether it concerns effectiveness, efficiency 
or the use of fiscal prudence, the country does not report any positive indicator. Here again, the country appears also as an exception on specific points of the survey: @BULLET There seems to be neither under nor over-spending @BULLET The functioning of budget institutions is considered as negative, and associated with 
a decreasing trend in the amounts spent through this source of financing. @BULLET The absence of reforms to improve the negative functioning of specialised institutions Public financial management in infrastructure in Africa
