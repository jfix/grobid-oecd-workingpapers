			<body>FOREWORD <lb/>A well-functioning policy making system is a key pillar of a transparent and effective democratic system. <lb/>It is also a crucial precondition for the country to make progress in the European integration (EI) process <lb/>as the capacity of national administrations to undertake the obligations linked with European Union (EU) <lb/>membership is a key criterion in the assessment of candidate preparedness. <lb/>Although there is no formal acquis in this area, previous experience and ongoing accession processes <lb/>demonstrates that the preparations for EU accession and membership need to be underpinned by policy <lb/>planning, development, co-ordination and implementation arrangements that: <lb/> <lb/>enable consistent policy planning and co-ordination of the Government activities, including <lb/>priority setting; <lb/> <lb/>create polices that are not deficient in substance, are consistent with one another, are <lb/>economically efficient and financially sustainable; <lb/> <lb/>include consultation with internal and external stakeholders; <lb/> <lb/>ensure that policies are properly implemented, communicated and monitored; <lb/> <lb/>support transposition and implementation of the acquis in all sectors; <lb/> <lb/>lay the foundations for operating effectively as an EU Member State. <lb/>The requirements for policy planning, development, co-ordination and implementation arrangements <lb/>and capacities need to be enhanced as a country progresses along the path to EI. Kosovo is at a crucial <lb/>stage of the EI process, with negotiations for the Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) started <lb/>in 2013 and formally concluded in July 2014. Entering into the SAA implementation process requires a <lb/>new arrangement for EI structures and transposition of the EU acquis, as well as more efficient policy <lb/>planning and decision making, and higher policy development and implementation capacities. <lb/>This review is the second in a series of SIGMA policy making reviews, looking into required policy making <lb/>arrangements and the capacities of Kosovo. Covering both the Government and the Assembly, the <lb/>review provides an in-depth analysis of the key aspects of Kosovo&apos;s public governance capacities in policy <lb/>making and co-ordination. On the basis of this analysis, the review suggests how policy making capacities <lb/>may be further enhanced. <lb/>Section one examines Kosovo&apos;s central co-ordination and horizontal planning systems in place, including <lb/>the arrangements for policy analysis and monitoring within line ministries and planning the co-ordination <lb/>of EI affairs. Section two concentrates on policy development procedures and capacities, including <lb/>interministerial consultation, policy analysis and meeting EI requirements. Section 3 analyses the legal <lb/>and institutional framework for parliamentary policy making and examines the Assembly&apos;s performance <lb/>in the exercise of central policy functions, including: legislation, budgeting, executive oversight and <lb/>control, and, as a cross-cutting function, the Assembly&apos;s responsibilities in the process of negotiating SAA <lb/>and the harmonisation of Kosovo&apos;s legal system with EU law. <lb/>This review draws on a range of materials and data collected in 2013, including national legislation, <lb/>central and sectoral planning documents, reports, international and national studies, working documents <lb/>and data collected during the preparation of the study as well as numerous interviews with practitioners <lb/>in the Kosovo administration. <lb/></body>

			<body>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY AND KEY RECOMMENDATIONS <lb/>Policy planning and co-ordination in the Government <lb/>The first part of the review analyses the functioning of the centre of government (CoG) in Kosovo. The <lb/>legal framework for policy planning and co-ordination is broadly in place and does not require any <lb/>substantial changes in the coming years. Key laws and the Government Rules of Procedure (RoP) <lb/>adopted in 2011 are in line with European values and practices, and are very ambitious compared with <lb/>the existing capacities of Kosovo&apos;s administration in terms of what is expected from the policy <lb/>co-ordination bodies and the ministries. The legal framework needed for embedding transposition of the <lb/>acquis into law drafting and policy making practices is in place. <lb/>The institutions fulfilling the functions of the CoG in Kosovo are the Office of the Prime Minister (OPM), <lb/>the Ministry of Finance (MoF) and the Ministry of European Integration (MEI). Overall, the roles of these <lb/>three organisations are well-established and responsibilities between them are clearly divided in most <lb/>cases. The OPM&apos;s adherence to relevant procedures has led to a stage of maturity, where they are <lb/>broadly followed by all stakeholders. Proper institutional set-up has been created both in the OPM and <lb/>the MEI, and the responsibilities inside the CoG institutions and the ministries are largely respected. <lb/>Therefore, the overall set-up and structure of the central co-ordinating institutions provide a good basic <lb/>level of preparedness for coping with the increasing workload derived from the EI process. <lb/>Central planning instruments, such as the Government Annual Work Plan (GAWP) and the Action Plan for <lb/>Stabilisation and Association Agreement (APSAA), are used and are partly consistent with each other and <lb/>with the Medium-Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF). The ability to plan ahead and include <lb/>implementation costs in forward planning within ministries is still weak. Backlogs due to overburdening <lb/>and unrealistic political expectations exist. Overall planning of the Government&apos;s work is of a rather <lb/>technical nature and different units&apos; efforts inside the CoG are often fragmented and lack co-operation. <lb/>The capacities of all structures to implement an ambitious legal framework are still limited. <lb/>Therefore, Kosovo should maintain the system&apos;s stability, avoiding major changes in the overall set-up <lb/>and procedures, instead focusing, in the next few years, on steps to strengthen and deepen the <lb/>functioning of the legal and administrative system already in place. <lb/>Key recommendations <lb/>1. <lb/>Increase the coherence of planning of the Government&apos;s work and decrease delivery backlogs <lb/>Short-term (1-3 years) <lb/> <lb/>Improve capacities (increase the number of available positions and provide training) of the <lb/>Strategic Planning Office (SPO) of the OPM in the following fields: policy analysis, prioritisation and <lb/>objective setting, development of strategies, and impact assessment. <lb/> <lb/>Translate the Declaration of Priorities (adopted by the Government in April 2014) into concrete <lb/>and coherent sectoral priority measures when preparing the GAWP 2015. <lb/> <lb/>The planning format and process to be streamlined by the MEI, as well as the reporting on various <lb/>EI processes, in particular SAA, visa liberalisation, implementation of the feasibility study priorities. <lb/></body>

			<page>8 <lb/></page>

			<body> <lb/>In co-operation with the SPO and the Government Co-ordination Secretariat (GCS) of the OPM, <lb/>under the co-ordination of the Steering Group for Strategic Planning (SGSP) and using the <lb/>Departments of European Integration and Policy Co-ordination (DEIPCs) in ministries, harmonise <lb/>the development of the GAWP 2015 as well as EI planning documents concerning process and <lb/>priorities 1 . <lb/> <lb/>Under the co-ordination of the SGSP, ensure that SAA negotiation commitments are integrated <lb/>into EI and domestic planning documents, in particular the GAWP and the MTEF. <lb/> <lb/>Firmly apply planning criteria to ensure the annual backlog carried into the coming year of <lb/>strategies to be adopted decreases considerably: <lb/>a) When preparing the four-year Government Programme for the new Government and the <lb/>GAWP Plan 2015, introduce a rule where only sectoral strategies can be included in the annual <lb/>plan of strategic documents. Exemptions from this rule should only be made in specific cases, <lb/>such as EI requirements for a more targeted strategy or other international and domestic <lb/>requirements; <lb/>b) Gradually move to only sectoral policy strategies being developed by ministries in order to <lb/>consolidate the strategic planning system. <lb/> <lb/>Gradually channel all key EI and national planning and policy co-ordination activities through the <lb/>DEIPCs. <lb/> <lb/>Under the co-ordination of the SGSP, harmonise (and, if possible, merge) reporting on the new <lb/>Government Programme and EI-related strategic plans. <lb/> <lb/>Gradually introduce gradually programme budget elements into the budgetary planning system <lb/>and strengthen both the overall and sectorial prioritisation of the MTEF. <lb/>Long-term (4-5 years) <lb/> <lb/>Gradually introduce performance indicators when reporting on key Government strategic <lb/>documents (EI, Declaration of Priorities and Government Programme). <lb/> <lb/>Incorporate overall and sectoral performance indicators in the Government Programme and the <lb/>GAWP during the next election cycle or change of coalition. <lb/> <lb/>Define monitoring of the implementation of sectorial strategies as a clear task for the SPO of the <lb/>OPM, launch a reporting system to the Government on the implementation of sectoral strategies <lb/>as an integrated part of the GAWP and introduce regular outcome based reporting on the <lb/>implementation of the MTEF. <lb/> <lb/>Merge sectoral strategies with ministries&apos; development strategies. <lb/>Policy development in the ministries <lb/>This part of the review analyses the policy development arrangements and capacities of Kosovo, <lb/>including planning for implementing EI activities and transposing the acquis. Similarly to policy planning <lb/>and co-ordination, the legal framework for policy development is in place and sets ambitious standards <lb/>for the CoG institutions and ministries. Capacities of all structures to implement the ambitious legal <lb/>framework are limited. <lb/></body>

			<note place="footnote">1 <lb/>Sources for the priorities should remain the same -for the GAWP, the main sources are the Government <lb/>Programme and the Declaration of Priorities; for the EI planning, the main sources are the SAA and visa <lb/>liberalisation processes. <lb/></note>

			<page>9 <lb/></page>

			<body>Procedures are followed by the ministries, but the whole process has a technical and formal nature. <lb/>Interministerial consultation processes and policy analysis are at the first stages of development, where <lb/>formal requirements are mostly met but the level of actual policy discussion is modest. The system of <lb/>concept papers has been launched which, if implemented rigorously, would be a remarkable <lb/>contribution to strengthening policy analysis. Initiatives of the involved CoG institutions (the Legal <lb/>Department and Government Co-ordination Department of the OPM and the Ministry of Finance) to <lb/>improve the system are not always well co-ordinated. <lb/>There is room to improve policy development structures and procedures in the ministries. Responsibility <lb/>for policy development is not clear and the share of staff in the departments dealing with policy <lb/>development is low. The acquis transposition process introduced requires tables of concordance. The <lb/>capacity of the ministries in law approximation is understandably low and should be increased gradually. <lb/>Ministries have generally launched co-ordinating structures to deal with EI co-ordination, strategic <lb/>planning and policy development. This is to be commended. However, these structures need to be <lb/>enhanced as these units&apos; capacity to deliver is hampered, mostly due to a lack of standing in one <lb/>ministry, a shortage of staff or lack of skills and expertise. However, some promising champions, such as <lb/>the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI), seem to be emerging already. <lb/>Key recommendations <lb/>1. <lb/>Increase the capacity of the CoG to co-ordinate and the ministries to develop <lb/>and implement policies <lb/>Short-term (1-3 years) <lb/> <lb/>Improve the quality of concept papers by increasing the capacities for quality control and provision <lb/>of day-to-day guidance of the CoG institutions responsible for policy and legal development and <lb/>fiscal analysis. <lb/> <lb/>Consider adjustments in the Government sessions to enable more active and timely involvement <lb/>of the Council of General Secretaries in the preparatory process. <lb/> <lb/>Strengthen the Council of General Secretaries&apos; role in the Government decision making process as <lb/>a main body for handling interministerial disputes, as well as discussing and deciding on horizontal <lb/>issues. <lb/> <lb/>Review how new principles introduced by the Government RoP in late 2011 have contributed to <lb/>improving the quality of policy discussions, and review how interministerial dialogue takes place <lb/>between ministries and the central government. Consider the results and implement any <lb/>necessary changes. <lb/> <lb/>Increase, through training and reallocation of staff, policy analysis capacities of the OPM&apos;s key <lb/>departments providing more comprehensive analytical advice to the Government and more active <lb/>steering of ministerial inputs. <lb/> <lb/>Define a coherent joint approach by CoG institutions to the improvement of policy development <lb/>instruments and capacities, such as financial impact assessments (FIAs), cost evaluations of new <lb/>policies, concept papers, etc. <lb/> <lb/>Strengthen the capability of line ministry staff to fully account for implementation issues and <lb/>potential financial impacts when developing policies, strategies and drafting legislation. <lb/> <lb/>Develop the capability of line ministries to properly integrate non-governmental organisations <lb/>(NGOs) and the public into the policy making process by providing written guidance and training <lb/>on consultation methods. <lb/></body>

			<page>10 <lb/></page>

			<body> <lb/>Launch a policy planning and strategy development capacity building programme for functional <lb/>and policy departments starting with DEIPCs, legal departments and key policy development <lb/>departments in the ministries mainly responsible for meeting requirements in the EI process, <lb/>namely MTI, Ministry of Internal Affairs (MIA), Ministry of Justice (MJ) and the Ministry of <lb/>Agriculture, Forestry and Rural Development (MAFRD). This programme can then be gradually <lb/>extended to policy departments in all ministries. <lb/> <lb/>Analyse the internal policy development processes of the ministries to more clearly define the <lb/>responsibilities of key departments and management levels in policy development. Find ways to <lb/>strengthen the policy development departments. <lb/>Long-term (4-5 years) <lb/> <lb/>Build on the fiscal impact assessment process and introduce a wider process of policy analysis that <lb/>evaluates a full range of costs and benefits and wider issues, such as potential environmental and <lb/>social impacts. <lb/> <lb/>Launch an ex-post evaluation of policy initiatives and laws to review whether, once implemented <lb/>they are achieving the original objectives. <lb/>2. <lb/>Root created mechanisms and develop capacities for effective transposition of the EU acquis <lb/>Short-term (1-3 years) <lb/> <lb/>Gradually enforce the adopted regulatory and normative acts which establish a framework for the <lb/>application of tables of concordance and clarify the division of labour of different departments and <lb/>authorities involved. <lb/> <lb/>Enhance the capacity of the ministries&apos; EI departments through staff evaluation, recruitment and <lb/>training to better implement the new SAA-related processes, and tasks related to the tables of <lb/>concordance. Ensure that all staff in EI departments have sufficient English skills and at least one <lb/>lawyer in key ministries has adequate knowledge of the relevant acquis. In allocating resources for <lb/>staff increases, prioritise those ministries that deal with a greater burden, such as the MTI, <lb/>Ministry of Environment and Spatial Planning (MESP), MIA foremost, and the MoF, Ministry of <lb/>Infrastructure (MI) and MAFRD secondly. <lb/> <lb/>Enhance the MEI&apos;s co-ordination capabilities through better political prioritisation of actions and <lb/>by giving priority to the SAA process and imposing stringent criteria for including new actions in <lb/>the framework planning documents. At the same time, allow ministries some flexibility in deciding <lb/>the timeframes for delivery of objectives. This would enable the MEI to lead the process in a more <lb/>systematic and targeted way and reduce backlogs. <lb/> <lb/>Review the functioning of the co-ordination system with a view to streamlining the reporting and <lb/>planning mechanisms in a more unified system and ensuring a smooth transition from SAA and <lb/>EPAP parallel structures to a unified co-ordination structure. <lb/> <lb/>Increase the budgetary planning capacities of the ministries and ensure that the procedures that <lb/>enhance forward budgetary planning (including concept papers and financial impact analyses) are <lb/>rigorously applied through all stages of the EI process. <lb/> <lb/>Strengthen the co-operation between the LO and the MEI and consider adopting the policy of <lb/>issuing joint legal opinions (at least for pivotal EI-related acts) to avoid giving conflicting signals to <lb/>ministries and ensure the homogeneity of legal oversight. <lb/>Long-term (4-5 years) <lb/> <lb/>Move towards a central single EI planning framework which would set clear and measurable <lb/>quantitative or qualitative targets to assess progress. <lb/></body>

			<page>11 <lb/></page>

			<body> <lb/>If the EI process progresses to a more advanced phase (i.e. accession negotiations), re-address the <lb/>issue of how to involve the majority of cabinet members in the substantial preparatory political <lb/>discussions. <lb/>Policy making in Parliament <lb/>The basic political and administrative structures of the Assembly are in place, in particular rules and <lb/>regulations, and processes at political and administrative levels to plan the Assembly&apos;s work and carry <lb/>out its main functions. However, the parliamentary policy making role in Kosovo is especially challenged <lb/>in at least two ways. <lb/>First, the legal system is still in the process of maturing, so that many aspects of economic and social life, <lb/>in particular, continue to await regulation through detailed parliamentary legislation. Between the end of <lb/>March 2011, at the beginning of the IVth Assembly, and June 2013, i.e. within a little more than two <lb/>years, the Assembly approved 164 laws, the majority of them being completely new laws rather than <lb/>amended legislation 2 . There are, accordingly, great pressures on the legislative capacity of the Assembly, <lb/>and there is a concomitant danger that other parliamentary business, notably oversight and control, may <lb/>become marginalised. <lb/>Second, there is, on the one hand, a strict institutional separation between the Government and the <lb/>Assembly, most visible in the constitutional provision that prohibits members of the Government to hold <lb/>an Assembly mandate. The emphasis on separation raises problems of effective executive-legislative <lb/>co-operation. On the other hand, in some important respects, notably when it comes to its own budget <lb/>and personnel, the Assembly is constrained by a lack of autonomy from the Government. <lb/>Regarding EU integration, the Standing Committee for EI has been given extensive responsibilities under <lb/>the Assembly&apos;s RoP, with a special focus on the review and supervision of &quot; the process of harmonisation <lb/>of laws enacted by the Assembly with the legislation of the EU &quot; . Nevertheless, there is no comprehensive <lb/>legal framework governing the powers and responsibilities of the Assembly in the EU integration process, <lb/>and the Committee&apos;s role is geared towards review and co-ordination rather than the introduction and <lb/>formulation of initiatives or detailed legislative scrutiny and amendment. <lb/>The IVth Assembly shows major improvements in parliamentary policy making capacity, whilst there is <lb/>awareness at both the political and administrative levels of the Assembly that further organisational <lb/>development is required. The options for change briefly highlighted in this section focus on major <lb/>organisational questions that affect both political and administrative structures and processes. <lb/>Key recommendations <lb/>1. <lb/>Increase capacity of the Assembly through improving functionality division of the Committees, <lb/>strengthening the legal framework and increasing its independence. <lb/>Short-term (1-3 years) <lb/> <lb/>Open meetings of the Presidency to a representative of the Government charged with handling <lb/>executive-legislative relations to improve the co-ordination of work between the Government and <lb/>the Assembly. Such a representative should not, have voting rights but should act as a source of <lb/>information, allow the Presidency to express concerns about the flow of legislative business <lb/>coming from the Government and act as an interlocutor when it comes to handling complaints <lb/>about unanswered parliamentary questions. <lb/></body>

			<body> <lb/>Review the functionality of the division of labour between the Committee for European <lb/>Integration and the Committee on Foreign Affairs and between the Committee for European <lb/>Integration and the Committee of Legislation. It is worth exploring a structure in which all political <lb/>aspects of integration are dealt with in a Committee for European and Foreign Affairs, whilst <lb/>questions of compliance and harmonisation are dealt with in a Committee for Legislation and <lb/>Harmonisation. <lb/> <lb/>Reconsider the legal status of Assembly personnel. It is not, at this stage, self-evident that there is <lb/>a need for a law regulating the civil service status of Assembly staff, but there is a strong a case for <lb/>supplementary regulations that do justice to the special conditions in the Assembly. <lb/> <lb/>Reconsider the legal framework governing Assembly personnel policy and the administration of its <lb/>budget to reduce dependency from the MoF and the Ministry of Public Administration (MPA) staff <lb/>recruitment and budgeting processes. <lb/> <lb/>Create a comprehensive legal framework that sets out how the Executive and the Assembly <lb/>co-operate in the area of EI. Such a framework needs to set out, in particular: <lb/>o the rights of the Assembly to information in EU-related matters and the informational duties <lb/>of the Executive (i.e. the types of information provided by the Executive, the timing of <lb/>information to be made available, the parliamentary procedures for processing the <lb/>information and the parliamentary rights for probing the information); <lb/>o the rights to discuss and adopt parliamentary positions on the matters concerned, such as <lb/>negotiation mandates; <lb/>o the obligations on the part of the Executive to take parliamentary positions into account; <lb/>o the rules and procedures for direct contacts between the Assembly and EU institutions. <lb/> <lb/>In line with evolving practices in EU Member States, consider introducing additional oversight and <lb/>control instruments that are principally geared to enhancing institutional and policy performance. <lb/>As concrete tools: <lb/>o Foresee regular performance reviews in new sectoral legislation, so that evaluation and <lb/>assessment are enshrined in legislation. <lb/>o Create additional instruments that allow Deputies to solicit information from the Government, <lb/>notably extended written questions to be answered by the Government or individual <lb/>ministries. <lb/>Long term (4-5 years) <lb/> <lb/>Analyse the consequences of the structural reform of the Assembly once the new structure has <lb/>had a chance to settle down, and its effects on the performance of the Assembly administration <lb/>can be assessed more systematically. <lb/> <lb/>Encourage flexibility in the allocation of staff resources across functions, not least in response to <lb/>the uneven flow of parliamentary business during the year. <lb/> <lb/>Since it might not be possible to increase the overall number of staff servicing committees, enable <lb/>the sharing of staff across them. The allocation of scarce staff resources must be driven by the <lb/>identification of the key political functions performed by the Assembly, i.e. it must be led by <lb/>demand. <lb/> <lb/>After analysing the impacts of conducted reforms and exhausting effects provided by flexibility <lb/>measures, move towards larger and more cohesive departments. <lb/></body>

			<body>1 <lb/>POLICY PLANNING AND CO-ORDINATION IN THE GOVERNMENT <lb/>1.1 <lb/>Legal framework <lb/>The main elements of the legal framework include: organic budget law 3 ; the Law on State <lb/>Administration 4 ; and the Regulation of Rules and Procedure of the Government 5 . The legal framework <lb/>specifies the responsibilities of the OPM, provides authority to assume these responsibilities, and creates <lb/>a framework for co-ordinating activities between key institutions at the centre of government, namely <lb/>the OPM, the MEI and the MoF. <lb/>The general EI-related legal framework consists of the Government Decision No. 6/121 of 22 April 2010, <lb/>Regulation No. 07/2010, and Regulation No. 32/2012, which established the MEI, created (and later <lb/>amended) its internal structures and adopted interministerial structures for the EI process. With its latest <lb/>EI-related decision, the Government has established the SAA negotiation structures. These acts empower <lb/>the MEI to lead the EI process by initiating and driving the planning process (including Instrument for <lb/>Pre-Accession [IPA] resources); monitoring the implementation activities (including the quality of <lb/>harmonisation of the acquis); and reporting on the progress made. Government Regulation No. 01/2011 <lb/>also established specialised EI departments (Departments for European Integration and Policy <lb/>Co-ordination – DEIPC) within all line ministries. <lb/>Analysis of main challenges <lb/>The legal framework is substantially complete and of generally high quality. It provides a good basis for <lb/>the management of all aspects of the policy process, including planning and monitoring, policy <lb/>development, policy co-ordination, and decision making. <lb/>The legal framework clearly defines and divides the responsibilities between the OPM, the MEI and the <lb/>MoF. In the SIGMA interviews conducted for the purpose of this review, all counterparts confirmed that <lb/>informal co-operation and information exchange among the three government bodies is smooth. <lb/>The legal framework provides a transparent mechanism for conducting EI processes and, in a rather <lb/>detailed manner, also defines all the specific tasks and obligations of the different parties involved. The <lb/>empowerment of the institutions that fulfil leading roles in the EI process (MEI in particular) fits well <lb/>within the overall and system of governance architecture in Kosovo. <lb/>1.2 <lb/>Planning the work of the Government <lb/>The legislative framework stipulates four central planning documents: the GAWP, the APSAA 6 , the MTEF <lb/>and Medium Term Declaration of Priorities (DP). Three of these (the APSAA, the MTEF and the DP) have <lb/>a medium-term planning dimension. <lb/>3 <lb/>Law on Public Financial Management and Accountability (17 December 2003). <lb/>4 <lb/>Law No.03/L – 189 on the State Administration of Kosovo (16 September 2010). <lb/>5 <lb/>Regulation on RoP of Kosovo, No. 09/2011. <lb/>6 <lb/>The APSAA replaced the EPAP in late 2012. <lb/></body>

			<body>According to Article 47 of the Government RoP, the Government approves by the end of December of <lb/>each year a Government Work Plan for the following calendar year. The plan is prepared in accordance <lb/>with the guidelines and instructions issued by the OPM and it is considered to be the principal planning <lb/>and implementation document of the Government. <lb/>The GAWP covers both legislative and non-legislative matters, as well as the preparation and <lb/>implementation of strategies. The legislative tasks and commitments for developing strategies are <lb/>summarised annually in separate annexes to the work plan. The GAWP includes a prioritisation <lb/>mechanism consisting of two sections: section A concentrates on activities needed for the <lb/>implementation of the strategic priorities, and section B encompasses all activities of ministries. <lb/>Regulations define mechanisms for ensuring coherence among central planning documents. Every item <lb/>foreseen under the GAWP has to make reference to other planning documents, such as the Government <lb/>Statement of Priorities, the Action Plan for the Implementation of the Economic Vision and the MTEF. <lb/>The RoP are in place to link policy planning with annual and medium-term financial planning, although <lb/>they are implemented with varying degrees of success, mainly through the strategic objectives. 7 <lb/>However, there are also requirements to link the GAWP to budget decisions and to include projected <lb/>costs. In addition, the RoP specify the responsibility of ministries to provide the calculation of public <lb/>revenues and expenditures for new initiatives. Fundamental to this is the requirement that the MoF <lb/>reviews and approves the fiscal analysis 8 . <lb/>Requirements exist for linking the GAWP with the EI process. The guidelines on the preparation of the <lb/>GAWP foresee a &apos;reference to EPAP/APSAA.&apos; Moreover, Article 48 of the RoP expects the GCS of the <lb/>OPM to co-ordinate the preparation of the GAWP with the MEI. <lb/>The RoP of the Government obliges the SPO and the GCS to issue general guidelines to enable better <lb/>planning and more detailed guidance of the methodology for the GAWP, including strategies and a <lb/>legislative programme 9 . Guidance materials are also provided by the MEI to support the preparation and <lb/>monitoring of the APSAA. <lb/>The reporting and monitoring system is embedded in the legal framework. Ministries have to transmit <lb/>data to the GCS quarterly for the purpose of monitoring the implementation of the GAWP, including data <lb/>on the extent to which each activity has been achieved, whether the deadline has been met, and an <lb/>assessment of any problems encountered in the implementation and recommendations for remedial <lb/>action. Any recommendations for amendments to the work plan can be submitted for approval to the <lb/>Government sessions. A similar process for monitoring the legislative programme is in place, with the LO <lb/>able to create a mechanism for its implementation 10 . Also, the GCS quarterly monitors implementation <lb/>of decisions of the Government. <lb/>7 <lb/>These obligations are specified in point 1.7/Article 10 of the Administrative Instruction for No. 02/2012 on <lb/>the procedures, criteria and methodology for the preparation and approval of strategy documents, and <lb/>plans for their implementation. <lb/>8 <lb/>Article 31 of the RoP of the Government. <lb/>9 <lb/>Administrative Instruction No. 02/2012 on the Procedures, Criteria and Methodology for the Preparation <lb/>and Approval of Strategy Documents and Plans for their Implementation; Manual on Drafting the Annual <lb/>Government Work Report of 11 November 2011; Manual for Preparation of Sectoral Strategies (June 2013). <lb/>10 <lb/>Regulation No. 01/2012 for the Board of Directors of the Legal Department, 29 February 2012.

			<body>Analysis of main challenges <lb/>Kosovo&apos;s legislation provides a solid framework for ensuring the coherence of the Government&apos;s central <lb/>planning documents and enabling linkages between the GAWP and the work plans needed for EI and the <lb/>budgetary process. The overall structure of the GAWP, including a section for priority activities and <lb/>annexed plans for legislation and strategies, enables efficient planning of the work of the Government. <lb/>1.2.1 <lb/>The Government decision making process <lb/>The Government&apos;s decision making procedures and requirements are defined mainly in the RoP, adopted <lb/>in late 2011. The RoP regulates in detail the process of preparing meetings of the Government (including <lb/>the responsibilities of various co-ordinating offices of the OPM and the MEI, the MJ and the MoF), as well <lb/>as the organisational aspects of the meetings. The RoP also regulates the decision making procedures of <lb/>the Government. Compared to the previous RoP, there is now a stronger emphasis on policy <lb/>development and policy analysis. <lb/>The RoP clearly specifies the documents that must be presented to support items on which the <lb/>Government must make a decision at Government meetings. In addition to the explanatory <lb/>memorandum, a concept paper (policy paper) should accompany a policy proposal or a draft law. A fiscal <lb/>impact assessment is also required, and it must adhere to the template provided by the MoF. <lb/>The requirement of a policy paper to be submitted for Government discussion prior to legal drafting for <lb/>all proposals, except those of a minor nature, is a new principle in the RoP of 2011. To allow the <lb/>Government to make informed decisions, ministries have to send policy analysis that includes the <lb/>consideration of different options and their consequences 11 . This policy analysis must be prepared in the <lb/>format of a concept paper. <lb/></body>

			<note place="footnote">In addition, Article 26 of the Law on Public Financial Management and Accountability (LPFMA) states that <lb/>whenever the Government considers a new law or an amendment to an existing law to be sent to the <lb/>Assembly, the Government shall first require the sponsoring ministry or body to submit to the <lb/>Government and the MoF a budgetary and economic impact statement that provides a detailed <lb/>assessment of the likely effects of the proposed legislation on the Kosovo budget and its economy. Also, <lb/>the sponsoring ministry shall prepare a report indicating the source or sources of funding, for such a <lb/>draft law will require the expenditure of public money in the fiscal year during which the law is adopted. <lb/>The Government has also adopted legal acts to establish the interministerial co-ordination mechanisms <lb/>for EI-related decision making. The first layer of these structures was set-up with a Government decision <lb/>in 2010, which established the Ministerial Council (sometimes referred to as committee) for the <lb/>Co-ordination of the European Integration Process (MCEI), chaired by the Prime Minister (PM). The main <lb/>task of the MCEI is to function as a political decision making forum where all the EI-related issues are <lb/>solved and agreed before their formal adoption by the Government 12 . The members of the council <lb/>include the Minister of the MEI (as Deputy Chair) and the Ministers of Finance and Economy, Public <lb/>Administration, Local Government Administration, Foreign Affairs, Internal Affairs and Justice. <lb/>Below the MCEI is the Working Committee for European Integration (WCEI), which is chaired by the <lb/>Minister of the MEI. The WCEI consists of representatives of all the ministries (and some Government <lb/>11 <lb/>Articles 28, 29 and 36 of the RoP of the Government. <lb/>12 <lb/>Among the MCEI&apos;s other tasks are to: co-ordinate the uniform state policy, as well as development and <lb/>implementation of the strategy of Kosovo for integration into the EU (including the EPAP); define the main <lb/>priority areas and deadlines for their enforcement; discuss the negotiating positions before their adoption <lb/>by the Government; ensure a well-planned and comprehensive process of approximation; co-ordinate the <lb/>development and activities related to the capacity building of the ministries; prepare the Government&apos;s <lb/>decisions on the use of EU and EI related bilateral assistance. <lb/></note>

			<page>16 <lb/></page>

			<body>bodies), and is responsible for preparing the work of the MCEI and running routine monitoring of the <lb/>implementation work. Under the working committee, the system relies on seven sectoral executive <lb/>committees, which consist of experts from ministries and are tasked with preparing the EPAP plans and <lb/>implementing the commitments taken. All three co-ordination forums – the MCEI, WCEI and executive <lb/>committees – were initially dedicated to the co-ordination of tasks deriving from Kosovo&apos;s aim to deepen <lb/>its integration with the EU. <lb/>With the launch of the stabilisation and association process, a new set of co-ordinating layers were <lb/>established in early 2013, such as the position of Chief Negotiator (ex officio MEI minister) and the <lb/>Negotiation Team at ministerial level to prepare negotiation positions and commitments. The decision <lb/>also established the post of Negotiating Team Secretary (Secretary-General of MEI) and created three <lb/>SAA Negotiation Working Groups to prepare and conduct negotiations at the technical level, two of <lb/>which (legal approximation and co-operation policies) are headed by MEI, and one (trade issues) by the <lb/>MTI. <lb/>Analysis of main challenges <lb/>A proper procedural framework for Government decision making and policy development has been <lb/>created by the OPM, the MEI and the MoF. The specific regulations – especially the Government RoP – <lb/>are highly sophisticated and hence establish an ambitious benchmark for the existing capacities of <lb/>Kosovo&apos;s administration in terms of what is expected from the CoG bodies and ministries. However, this <lb/>provides a good model to strive towards. <lb/>The procedural aspects of policy analysis and policy development still require attention, especially <lb/>concerning handling and steering policy analysis issues, in particular concept papers, at the CoG. <lb/>Responsibility for co-ordinating policy development and policy analysis is not precisely established in the <lb/>legislation. This has led to a situation where MoF deals with the financial issues of concept papers, and <lb/>the LO, the SPO and the GCS all are involved in processing and providing feedback on concept papers. <lb/>Responsibility for development of the system and guiding ministries is scattered. <lb/>The legal framework for EI is in place and is sufficient for a country which is in the phase of starting SAA <lb/>negotiations. As some key elements have been introduced only recently and there is no widespread <lb/>implementation practice, the legal framework might merit additional fine tuning after the SAA <lb/>negotiations have been finalised. For example, although the normative acts needed for embedding and <lb/>transposing the acquis into law drafting and policy making practices have been adopted, they have been <lb/>used in practice in only a few cases. <lb/>The crucial issue at the CoG level is to ensure the MEI&apos;s role in monitoring that the draft bills related to <lb/>the EU acquis conform with the general legal framework, which gives the tasks of legislative <lb/>co-ordination and oversight to the LO of the OPM. The RoP of the Government (Article 42) give the LO <lb/>quite a broad mandate not only in ensuring the overall co-ordination of legislative drafting of all draft <lb/>laws that the Government submits to the Assembly, but also in empowering the LO to ensure (through <lb/>instructions and assistance) that the drafts the ministries submit adhere to the overall legal framework of <lb/>Kosovo and follow the overall standards and quality of legislative drafting. <lb/>This means that the MEI and the OPM should work closely together to ensure full compatibility between <lb/>Kosovo&apos;s legal order and that of the EU. Although this co-operation already exists at the informal level <lb/>and the working relationship is described by both sides as &apos;cordial&apos;, further steps could be taken to <lb/>formalise this relationship at the procedural level. As the integration process advances, the transposition <lb/>effort will increasingly penetrate all policy fields and every facet of legal order. To ensure that the <lb/>transposing acts adhere to a single legal logic which takes into account the aims of the acquis, as well as <lb/>what is viable within Kosovo&apos;s own legal order, the two bodies could issue joint legal opinions to the <lb/>ministries on EI-related acts. This would also avoid having the two &apos;overseers&apos; issuing contradictory <lb/>opinions to line ministries. <lb/></body>

			<body>1.3 <lb/>Policy co-ordination and planning arrangements at the centre of the government (CoG) <lb/>1.3.1 <lb/>Coherence of the CoG <lb/>Overall policy co-ordination and planning issues are regulated in the RoP. Responsibilities and functions <lb/>of the CoG institutions are stipulated in regulations on internal organisations. The regulation for the OPM <lb/>manages the structure and mandate of each office within the OPM 13 . The regulations of the MEI and the <lb/>MoF also determine their competence on policy making issues. The MEI has the authority to co-ordinate <lb/>composition and implementation of strategic documents relevant for EI, handle daily EI-related <lb/>co-ordination issues, and check the compatibility of legislation with the EU acquis. The MoF has the <lb/>competence to lead medium-term and annual budgetary processes and reviews and approve the FIAs of <lb/>primary and secondary legislation and strategic documents. <lb/>Existing co-operation of CoG institutions was formalised in June 2012 with the creation of the SGSP 14 . <lb/>The group is led by the political adviser of the Prime Minister and assembles key officials from the OPM <lb/>(directors of three key departments), the MoF (directors of budget and macroeconomic departments), <lb/>the MEI (director of the EU assistance co-ordination department) and the MPA (director of public <lb/>administration reform co-ordination). The Group&apos;s functions include establishing coherence of key <lb/>Government strategic documents, taking into account the EI process priorities, harmonising budget and <lb/>policy planning, as well as ensuring realistic planning and streamlining of foreign aid with Government <lb/>priorities. Thus the SGSP is primarily co-ordinating planning issues. <lb/>The main co-ordination forums for daily policy issues at the CoG are handled through informal regular <lb/>meetings of the Deputy Prime Ministers (DPMs) and formal weekly meetings of State Secretaries. In <lb/>2013, the number of DPMs was extended from five to six 15 . The horizontal responsibilities of the DPMs <lb/>are legally fixed with the regulation on internal organisation of the OPM; the specific areas for which the <lb/>DPMs are responsible are established through the informal distribution of functions. The PM holds <lb/>meetings with the DPMs and the Secretary-General of the OPM twice a week. <lb/>At administrative level co-ordination is formalised. The responsibilities of the weekly meetings of General <lb/>Secretaries are set out clearly in the RoP 16 , covering consideration of items submitted to the Government <lb/>sessions, discussion on the agenda for Government sessions, follow-up to implementation of the <lb/>Government Annual Work Plan, and review of the EI process. The RoP also mandates the Council of <lb/>General Secretaries to solve conflicting and unresolved issues between ministries. <lb/>Analysis of main challenges <lb/>The institutional architecture for carrying out policy development, co-ordination and planning functions <lb/>at the CoG is in place. The CoG comprises multiple institutions but many are based within the Prime <lb/>Minister&apos;s Office, making co-ordination easier. There is clarity at the administrative level about the <lb/>respective roles of institutions and established procedures for co-operation and co-ordination among <lb/>them. <lb/>13 <lb/>A draft new regulation on internal systematisation of the OPM has been prepared, but was not yet approved <lb/>by the Government at the time of compiling this review. <lb/></body>

			<note place="footnote">14 <lb/>Government Decision No. 05/83 on the Establishment of the Steering Group for Strategic Planning (11 July <lb/>2012). <lb/>15 <lb/>According to the regulation on the organisational structure of the OPM, adopted by the Government in June <lb/>2013, a DPM shall be responsible for a special field of importance and high priority for the Government, but <lb/>may also co-ordinate a sphere of policies within the responsibility of few ministries. <lb/>16 <lb/>Chapter VIII of the RoP specifies the competences/responsibilities of the Council of General Secretaries. <lb/></note>

			<page>18 <lb/></page>

			<body>Co-ordination forums contribute to policy planning. The composition of the SGSP is adequate, and the <lb/>definition of its functions sufficient to ensure a harmonised and efficient strategic planning system. <lb/>However, additional efforts by all counterparts should be made to fully exploit the benefits of the SGSP <lb/>and assure its sustainable and effective functioning. Since its formal creation, the SGSP has met only <lb/>three times and has not been the joint decision making centre in relevant strategic planning processes. <lb/>The planning and implementation of key processes (EI, public administration reform (PAR), the review of <lb/>the legislative programme) are regular weekly items on the agenda of the Council of General Secretaries, <lb/>which creates a good basis for whole-of-government planning and enables discussions of key <lb/>implementation challenges. <lb/>Regular preparatory discussions of the Government session agenda items by the Council of General <lb/>Secretaries has the potential to efficiently address contentious issues of the ministries before the <lb/>sessions. However, developing the capacity and tradition of dealing with these issues effectively takes <lb/>time: analysis of minutes of the Council meetings demonstrates that the emphasis of discussions is <lb/>currently on providing an overview by the OPM of items included in the agenda. On very few occasions <lb/>were contentious issues actually raised by the ministries. <lb/>With six Deputy Prime Ministers, political-level co-ordination is a challenging task. However, clear, <lb/>informal mandates of the DPMs and informal working processes created for preparing decisions of the <lb/>Government, are meeting the challenge relatively well 17 . <lb/>1.3.2 <lb/>Structure of the OPM <lb/>The OPM has over 15 departments fulfilling functions set by government regulation on the internal <lb/>organisation of the OPM and in some cases (e.g. the Office of the Co-ordinator of the Strategy of the <lb/>North of Kosovo) by specific law. Also, the number of the central state administration bodies reporting to <lb/>the OPM was extended to six with the new regulation on internal organisation of the OPM 18 . The key <lb/>departments for policy making and co-ordination are the GCS, the SPO and the LO, but also the Public <lb/>Communication Office (PCO) is involved in the Government decision making process. Directors of these <lb/>departments are well connected to the relevant policy co-ordination forums (they all are members of the <lb/>Council of General Secretaries) and with the Prime Minister&apos;s advisers. The SPO has a direct <lb/>subordination to the Prime Minister, being at the same time accountable for administrative issues to the <lb/>General Secretary. Other key departments are accountable to the General Secretary. Each key <lb/>department runs its own co-ordination network in the ministries; these networks contribute, among <lb/>other things, to the preparation of Government sessions. Responsibilities of the key departments are <lb/>defined in the RoP. <lb/></body>

			<note place="footnote">17 <lb/>Before an item is included on the agenda of the Government session, it is sent to the responsible DPM and <lb/>the responsible adviser of the PM for approval and feedback.

They may discuss issues related to the forthcoming Government session, <lb/>although the focus of the meetings is wider. <lb/>Analysis of main challenges <lb/>Internal co-ordination within the central government works well. The system has reached the stage of <lb/>maturity where each department knows its responsibilities in fulfilling one of the core functions of the <lb/>OPM – planning the work of the Government and handling Government sessions – and is capable of <lb/>providing quality outcomes flexibly and within tight timeframes. The OPM has leverage in relation to the <lb/>ministries and has been able to set-up procedures which are followed by all stakeholders. <lb/>Remaining challenges are related to the rather fragmented and cumbersome structure of the OPM, <lb/>some grey areas between the key departments and the capacity of key structures to meet with high <lb/>quality all responsibilities established by the RoP. <lb/>The OPM comprises various departments with very different tasks, for example the Office for issues of <lb/>Categories Deriving from the Kosovo Liberation Army War. Agencies under its supervision also cover a <lb/>broad range of areas, for example the Veterinary and Food Agency. This is a legacy from the <lb/>pre-independence era, and it would be useful for Kosovo to continue the process of transferring some of <lb/>these functions to relevant ministries. <lb/>Supporting departments and key departments for policy co-ordination and government decision making <lb/>are accountable to the General Secretary, others to the Prime Minister&apos;s Cabinet. A high number of <lb/>rather small departments with a wide scope of functions requires substantial management from the PM <lb/>Cabinet staff and the General Secretary, and makes the design and implementation of coherent strategy <lb/>for the whole organisation, as well as daily management, challenging. <lb/>The number of staff in key departments is modest compared with the overall size of the OPM. According <lb/>to the draft regulation on internal organisation, the SPO has 5 positions, the GCS 12, the LO 11 and the <lb/>Communication Office 6, but not all of these are filled. Staffing issues are particularly challenging for the <lb/>SPO. This creates some capacity issues in fulfilling all the responsibilities envisioned by the RoP, in <lb/>particular in setting priorities, planning in substance the work of the Government and providing <lb/>analytical support to the PM and the Government. <lb/>As per normal practice, all main departments are involved in the key processes of the OPM: policy <lb/>planning and co-ordinating government decision making. Responsibilities established by the RoP do not <lb/></body>

			<page>21 <lb/></page>

			<body>exclude overlaps between departments, particularly concerning analytical tasks and handling materials <lb/>submitted to the Government sessions. In practice, however, no remarkable duplications exist due to the <lb/>limited capacity of departments. At the same time, the arrangement of each department looking at <lb/>submitted documents from its own perspective has led to some key processes having many contributors, <lb/>creating co-ordination challenges. A good example is concept papers where the formal responsibility of <lb/>the GCS for ensuring their overall quality could be supported by a much stronger co-ordination role in <lb/>practice, including commenting on substance, co-ordinating inputs and activities of the CoG actors, and <lb/>guiding ministries towards higher quality materials. <lb/>1.3.3 <lb/>The MEI and co-ordination structures for EI <lb/>Recent organisational changes, prompted by the new systematisation, have been introduced within the <lb/>MEI. These were steps in the right direction and, overall, the MEI&apos;s internal structures and development <lb/>plans accommodate the new challenges of the process 19 . In addition to the departments that lead the <lb/>planning, monitoring and co-ordination efforts of the EI process 20 , the MEI has a separate unit to oversee <lb/>the harmonisation effort (Department of EU law) as well as a new, separate unit for co-ordinating donor <lb/>assistance. It is important to note that the MEI has, since the start of 2013, introduced formal practices <lb/>to foster interdepartmental co-operation, especially between the EU law department and other <lb/>functional departments (including the department dealing with IPA). The EU law department now <lb/>participates in preparatory meetings when IPA assistance and SAA Action Plans are discussed and, in <lb/>return, the EU law department involves the functional departments in the formulation of its legal opinion <lb/>once the ministries submit draft EI-related laws. <lb/>As indicated above, with the launch of the SAA process, a second layer to the interministerial <lb/>co-ordination mechanisms was introduced with the establishment of the Negotiation Team and the <lb/>Working Groups for SAA negotiations. The Negotiation Team is chaired by the Minister for the MEI and <lb/>consists of ministers from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA), the MAFRD, the MoF, the MTI, the <lb/>Ministry of Economic Development (MED), and the MJ. <lb/>In addition to these co-ordination layers, the MEI also administered an EI Task Force, a broad forum <lb/>consisting of representatives from the administration, NGOs, academia and interest groups, brought <lb/>together to draft a new national EI strategy, which was adopted by the National EI Council on 7 October <lb/>2013. The strategy is a framework document which aims to solidify a broader national consensus around <lb/>EI goals, which could then facilitate compromises on important, specific EI-related reforms. It deals with <lb/>five topics: 1) effective governance, 2) the rule of law and the fight against organised crime, 3) economic <lb/>growth, 4) the enhanced involvement of stakeholders and 5) regional co-operation and development. It <lb/>does not address the operational side of EI, which is left to the GAWP and the SAA Action Plan. <lb/>As the Task Force was an ad hoc mechanism with the sole purpose of drafting the strategy, the MEI has <lb/>no plans to continue with it and therefore it will be abandoned. However, the National EI Council <lb/>convened by the President of Kosovo, which sees itself as a consensus-building platform and which <lb/>complements to some extent the Parliament&apos;s EU committee, will continue. Its secretariat consists of <lb/>two members from the President&apos;s Office and one member from the MEI. Its discussions normally <lb/>focussed on major specific policy areas or reforms (such as PAR), to discuss and assess progress and <lb/>problems involved. With the adoption of the national EI strategy, there are plans for the National Council <lb/>19 <lb/>The reform of organisational structures took into account analysis and recommendations made by the GIZ. <lb/>See Engelman, Andrej (May 2012), &quot; Strengthening of the European Integration Process and Structures &quot; ; <lb/>Support to the European Integration Process in Kosovo, Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale <lb/>Zusammenarbeit GmbH. <lb/></body>

The co-ordination system is <lb/>relatively well equipped to set enforceable deadlines and to monitor and report on the progress made. <lb/>However, the potential of interministerial co-ordination mechanisms is not fully exploited as both MCEI <lb/>and WCEI function mainly as reporting mechanisms on the progress of commitments and forums of <lb/>information exchange regarding the reasons for these problems and delays. This pattern is also followed <lb/>in the other interministerial forums established for more specific tasks. The assessment of interviewees <lb/>is that both administrative and political level forums give little input into policy or decision making <lb/>processes (for example, providing decision makers with real alternative policy choices, or solving <lb/></body>

			<page>24 <lb/></page>

			<body>technical-level disputes). There is some evidence which indicates that the situation is gradually changing <lb/>and these forums (Trade Council, WCEI) are more often used also as decision making and <lb/>problem-solving bodies. Feasibility study short-term and medium-term benchmarks and SAA <lb/>negotiations are a good trigger for more substantive discussions on problematic issues, which indicates <lb/>that when the EI agenda advances, the nature of the discussions changes and interministerial forums <lb/>have good potential to develop into interministerial decision making centres. <lb/>In terms of the functioning logic of the system, one can make a distinction between the interministerial <lb/>mechanisms adopted at the political, higher-administrative and expert levels. On the other hand, the <lb/>system is also divided between two functional work processes: the new SAA process and the old EPAP <lb/>and more general EI process. In this context, three issues can be outlined. <lb/>First, the coherency of the system is guaranteed mainly through the MEI, which functions as the central <lb/>co-ordinator between the different levels (expert to political) and two functional pillars (SAA and EPAP). <lb/>The fact that MEI&apos;s role has been strengthened should be commended. <lb/>Second, at the political level, the role of the Minister for European Integration is crucial to ensure the link <lb/>with the PM and the Cabinet. This gives the process the necessary political leadership and clout, which <lb/>are useful for prioritisation, as well as the appropriate arbitration tools to solve conflicts. In the future <lb/>development of the system, great care should be taken to maintain and strengthen both the institutional <lb/>and non-institutional linkages between the Minister for EI and Head of the Government. <lb/>Third, at the expert level, the fact that the SAA and EPAP structures are different for the expert groups, <lb/>with different chairs and slightly dissimilar (though to some extent overlapping) membership and <lb/>mandates (see Table 2), raises issues which should be closely followed after the SAA negotiations are <lb/>finished. Knowledge and know-how gained from SAA negotiations needs to be transferred to the <lb/>implementation side. <lb/>Table 2. Comparison of expert level committees and their mandates 21 <lb/>Sectorial executive committees (EPAP structure) <lb/>Negotiation Working Groups (SAA structure) <lb/>Governance (Chair: Secretary-General for MJ): <lb/>Institutions; Public Administration; Anti-corruption <lb/>Policies and Judiciary; Regional Co-operation; <lb/>Justice, Freedom and Safety. <lb/>Internal market (Chair: Secretary-General of MTI): <lb/>Free movement of goods; Free movement of <lb/>workers; Free movement of capital; The right to <lb/>establishment and freedom to provide services; <lb/>Intellectual and industrial rights; Competition <lb/>policies; Financial services; Consumer and health <lb/>protection; Public procurement. <lb/>Trade issues (Chair: Deputy Minister of MTI): <lb/>Free movement of goods (incl.

All policy co-ordination mechanisms <lb/>will develop their own working practices and co-operation dynamic, and abolishing ad hoc structures <lb/>once the original mandates are achieved may engender the loss of good practices and co-operation <lb/>methods which could be transferred to the management of other processes in a more permanent <lb/>framework (like the future accession process). <lb/>1.4 <lb/>Processes and implementation capacities <lb/>1.4.1 <lb/>Planning the work of the Government <lb/>There is a clear set of Government priorities (Statement of Priorities), approved by the Government each <lb/>year. The source of the priorities is the Government programme 2011-2014, Plan for implementation of <lb/>Economic Vision 2011-2014 (for economic area), sectorial and sub-sectorial strategies and political <lb/>decisions of the Government. The method of communicating priorities to the ministries is not regulated; <lb/>however, the process is being improved at a practical level each year. Priorities are developed through a <lb/>consultative process, whereby ministries propose priorities for their area of competence. However, the <lb/>final selection of priorities is done by the SGSP and is forwarded to the Government for a decision. <lb/>The preparation and approval of the Government&apos;s strategic priorities and work programme, and its link <lb/>to the budget, is co-ordinated by the OPM. The development of the Declaration of Priorities, which also <lb/>feeds into the MTEF, is co-ordinated by the SPO of the OPM. Part A of the GAWP is composed of the <lb/>Government priorities. <lb/></body>

			<page>26 <lb/></page>

			<body>Monitoring the implementation of the GAWP is co-ordinated by the GCS; ministries give a progress <lb/>report on a quarterly basis 22 . The information is consolidated into quarterly and annual <lb/>government-wide reports by the GCS and submitted to the Council of General Secretaries. The annual <lb/>report for the implementation of the annual work plan is published and distributed by the GCS during <lb/>the first quarter of the subsequent year. <lb/>Development and monitoring of key operational planning documents for the EI process is co-ordinated <lb/>by the MEI. Until 2012, the key document was the European Partnership Action Plan (EPAP); it was <lb/>replaced at the end of 2012 by the APSAA. The APSAA is targeted to timely implementation of <lb/>commitments derived from the EI process, where reforms needed for SAA are prioritised. Coherence <lb/>between the GAWP and the APSAA is sought by the administration: both documents are adopted by the <lb/>Government at the same time, but there are no formal mechanisms for streamlining the development <lb/>and reporting process. <lb/>The OPM and the MEI have the authority to require that ministries submit their plans in line with <lb/>priorities, and they can set the agenda for ministries. The system has formal mechanisms that require <lb/>prudent planning in terms of setting achievable deadlines, creating links with budgetary resources to <lb/>ensure implementation, and foreseeing and planning for other possible impacts. Both institutions have <lb/>produced detailed guidelines for ministries to simplify the planning and reporting process. <lb/>The MTEF is developed by the MoF; it is compiled for three years and is approved annually in April. It is a <lb/>clear statement of the Government&apos;s priorities as set out in the DP, followed by macroeconomic and <lb/>fiscal analyses, a sectoral expenditure analysis and individual fiches for budgetary operators, setting out <lb/>objectives and three-year expenditure ceilings. <lb/>Ministries compile various strategic documents; a list of strategies to be developed is annexed to the <lb/>GAWP. In February 2013, 59 strategic documents were in force. Of these, 44 can be considered <lb/>strategies and five have the characteristics of sectoral strategies, covering the policy field in full 23 . <lb/>Analysis of main challenges <lb/>Guiding the development of the Statement of Priorities and its application in the MTEF and GAWP <lb/>development processes was a challenge for the SPO of the OPM in 2012, mainly due to vacant positions. <lb/>The SPO was strengthened in 2013 with two additional staff. The process of developing the Statement of <lb/>Priorities has been changed in order to move from macro-level priorities to sectoral-level priorities and <lb/>to link priorities with the development of sectoral strategies and medium-term budgetary ceilings. The <lb/>stated efforts are steps in the right direction and will strengthen the priority-setting and implementation <lb/>capacities of the Government, including in the SAA process, and enable the more efficient use of scarce <lb/>resources. Analysis of the coherence of key strategic documents – the MTEF and the GAWP – <lb/>demonstrates that the situation improved in 2012, with both documents approved for the year 2013 and <lb/>beyond being more coherent compared with the documents adopted in the previous year. Their <lb/>structure and priority objectives follow the structure of the Programme of the Government and are <lb/>largely consistent. <lb/>However, in 2013, when developing the Declaration of Priorities 2014-2016 and MTEF for the same <lb/>period, co-operation of the OPM with the MoF deteriorated. Commitment of the MoF to contribute to <lb/>the development of the priorities to ensure alignment with the financial opportunities of the <lb/>Government remains a challenge. The SPO of the OPM and the MoF are still applying a somewhat <lb/>different approach to the Government priorities, leading to a modified version of priorities in the MTEF <lb/>22 <lb/>The GCS evaluates the quarterly reports on the following three criteria: 1) quality of reporting; 2) meeting of <lb/>implementation deadline; 3) level of implementation. <lb/>23 <lb/>A list of strategic documents in force is provided by the SPO of the OPM; concrete numbers are derived from <lb/>expert analysis of the stated list. <lb/></body>

			<page>27 <lb/></page>

			<body>compared with the Declaration of Priorities prepared by the SPO and approved by the Government. As <lb/>the guardian of financial resources, the MoF must accommodate the Government priorities within the <lb/>funding opportunities of the state, a consideration which is not fully taken into account during the <lb/>development of the priorities statement. Better co-operation is therefore needed between the MoF and <lb/>the OPM, and mechanisms need to be built into the planning process to frame the prioritisation exercise <lb/>within short and medium-term funding opportunities. <lb/>The planning of coherent sectoral measures in the MTEF, GAWP and APSAA has improved, but can <lb/>evolve further. Whilst remarkably improved, compared to 2012, the integration of EI priority measures <lb/>into other key strategic documents can be further enhanced. <lb/>This analysis demonstrates that the planning involved in the implementation of Government priorities <lb/>still varies between individual ministries, so overall planning quality depends on ministerial capacities. <lb/>The planning of work in policy areas that fall under several ministries is still challenging for the <lb/>administration. <lb/>Table 3.

When the difference was not more than one heading under each <lb/>priority area (in the case of sectoral sections, priority objectives and measures), documents were assessed as <lb/>largely consistent. When up to three headings differed, documents were considered partly consistent. When <lb/>the difference was greater, documents were considered slightly consistent or not at all. <lb/></body>

			<body>The analysis of 2012 working practices and the study of key strategic documents demonstrate that both <lb/>the OPM and the MEI have the capacity to guide the development process of the GAWP 2013 and the <lb/>APSAA respectively. The process for the development of these documents has been streamlined in terms <lb/>of timing. Both documents were adopted at the last Government session of 2012. Nevertheless, the <lb/>analysis of the documents and working practices demonstrates that prioritising the various obligations <lb/>remains a challenge, in the case of both EI-related processes and policy making in general. <lb/>The linkage between planning priorities and the budgetary process can be still improved, in particular at <lb/>the level of ministries. The MTEF 2013-2015 comprises narrative material regarding high-level <lb/>governmental priorities and strategic objectives, which are complemented by objectives and associated <lb/>resources at the level of individual ministries or budgetary operators (BOs). The BO-level material <lb/>includes an overview presentation of mission, context (current situation), objectives and activities, <lb/>together with an allocation of resources in aggregate terms to each activity. This descriptive material is <lb/>clearly and logically presented and has been significantly streamlined from the previous year&apos;s MTEF. <lb/>Each BO chapter also includes the more formal, tabular presentation of expenditure ceilings on a <lb/>functional rather than programmatic basis. Since the functional tables form the basis of the budget <lb/>appropriations, and of subsequent audit by the Office of the Auditor General, the programmatic <lb/>allocations are indicative rather than normative. <lb/>In principle, this process sets the foundation for a coherent strategy-driven approach to resource <lb/>allocation and is a basic, potentially useful &quot; presentational &quot; approach to performance-type budgeting, <lb/>with some elements of the more developed &quot; performance-informed &quot; approach. In practice, the <lb/>alignment between the objectives at the central government level and BO-level objectives is not <lb/>apparent, and there is little cross-referencing from the BO level back to the broader priorities. <lb/>Understandably, there is no visible linkage between these priorities and budget allocations. <lb/>Evidence obtained from interviews indicates that for some EI-related obligations, ministries feel <lb/>considerable pressure from the centre (MEI, OPM) towards more ambitious deadlines and feel bound to <lb/>accept those deadlines, which may be clearly undeliverable from the start. Comparative analyses of the <lb/>2012 EPAP with the 2013 APSAA indicates that, on average, 36% of primary legislation that was planned <lb/>for adoption in the EPAP was delayed and subsequently incorporated into the 2013 APSAA with renewed <lb/>deadlines. However, ministries that have more than an average number of primary law-drafting duties <lb/>are overburdened. They also tend to be the ministries with more postponed deadlines, such as the MI, <lb/>the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare (MLSW), the MAFRD, and the MESP (Figure 2). <lb/>At the same time, specific tasks within the EPAP and APSAA, as well as in the GAWP, are usually formed <lb/>bottom-up, with little scrutiny or prioritisation from the centre (although more with EI matters, due to <lb/>the European Commission&apos;s Progress Reports). The OPM and the MEI should, implement more stringent <lb/>criteria to focus on the most important tasks and scale the workload down to more manageable levels, <lb/>bearing in mind the limited resources (budgetary resources included) and the capacity in ministries. <lb/></body>

Backlog of EI-related primary acts (from 2012 to 2013 and beyond) <lb/>Sources: EPAP 2012; APSAA 2013; and expert analyses. <lb/>Monitoring of the implementation of key strategic documents is regular, has a quarterly rhythm and <lb/>provides an overview of the general implementation record of each ministry. The analysis of <lb/>implementation reports of the GAWP and EPAP demonstrates the technical nature of the GAWP <lb/>reporting 28 , which concentrates on taking stock of delivered items. The EPAP reporting also provides an <lb/>overview of implemented activities and does not go into the real implementation or achievement of <lb/>objectives. In the current stage of the system&apos;s maturity, this level of reporting is sufficient and meets <lb/>the general expectations of the European Commission and the Government, although it creates <lb/>additional administrative burdens with parallel reporting requirements from the OPM and the MEI. <lb/>For now, monitoring mechanisms do not distinguish between process implementation, such as the <lb/>amount of secondary legislation that has been enacted and achievement of intended outcome or for <lb/>example, the amount of road infrastructure built and poverty levels reduced. <lb/>Consolidation of the overall strategic planning system remains a challenge. The state of play of planning <lb/>sectorial policies is still fragmented, with a huge tendency for unrealistic planning and visible bottom-up <lb/>pressure leading to unrealistic plans that have not been prioritised.

			<body>1.4.2 <lb/>Government decision making <lb/>Principles for holding Government sessions are regulated in detail in the RoP. It establishes procedures <lb/>and requirements for submitted materials as well as consultation, and defines the roles of the relevant <lb/>OPM departments and other key stakeholders. Materials should be submitted to the OPM 15 days <lb/>before the Government session. The RoP also specifies the schedule and recipients for materials <lb/>distributed before and after the meetings, such as the agenda and minutes. The invitation, agenda and <lb/>materials for agenda items must be sent to the relevant units no later than three days before the <lb/>Government session. Draft minutes of the meetings are circulated three days after the session with the <lb/>feedback deadline of two days. The General Secretary provides a detailed overview of what was decided <lb/>in the Government session in the following week&apos;s Council of General Secretaries&apos; meeting. There is also <lb/>a formal procedure to enable the consideration of urgent issues at a Council of Ministers&apos; session 33 . <lb/>The Government Secretariat is authorised to return items submitted to the Government sessions to <lb/>ministries if the substance is problematic or other requirements are not fulfilled. For example, material <lb/>can be sent back to ministries if the proposal does not contain the opinion of the MoF, the MEI and the <lb/>LO, or if it is not in line with the GAWP and/or Government priorities. In practice, however, the GCS <lb/>resolves issues more informally. It usually consults the proposing ministry and requests additions or <lb/>clarification rather than sending documentation back. For example, no items were sent back to ministries <lb/>in the fourth quarter of 2012 34 . <lb/>EI issues and legislation needed for transposing the acquis follows the same procedure as all Government <lb/>agenda items. However, the MEI is responsible for providing an opinion on harmonisation with the <lb/>acquis. The LO of the OPM follows transposed norms in line with the Constitution and general legal <lb/>framework. Until recently, the MEI was responsible for checking that the proposed legislation does not <lb/>contradict with the acquis. The requirement to steer transposition of the acquis was introduced only in <lb/>2013. <lb/>Analysis of main challenges <lb/>The overall co-ordination cycle ensures the involvement of key stakeholders and enables inputs at both <lb/>the political and administrative levels as well as sufficient time for processing the dossiers for the OPM. <lb/>Interaction between the political level (the DPMs and advisers of the PM) and the administrative level <lb/>(General Secretary of the OPM and key directors) is active, and the roles of different levels are clear and <lb/>respected by the relevant actors in the process. Government sessions are regularly held on Wednesdays <lb/>and the agenda is set either on the Friday of the week before, or on the Monday after the PM and the <lb/>DPMs have met. The current timing of the Council of General Secretaries meeting, regularly held on <lb/>Tuesday mornings, reduces opportunities for the Council to be active in the preparatory process, and <lb/>restricts the channels available to the ministries for designing session agendas and holding discussions on <lb/>immediate, disputed issues. On Tuesdays, the agenda for the upcoming Government session is already <lb/>fixed and the discussion therefore mainly provides an overview (by the General Secretary) of what is <lb/>included in the agenda. <lb/>Co-ordination of session preparations happens routinely, and relevant rules and time periods are <lb/>generally well adhered to. The GCS has applied a flexible and communicative practice for solving issues <lb/>openly with the ministries and improving the quality of the dossier. Interviews revealed that 60% of the <lb/>items on the agenda are submitted through the normal procedure (15 days ahead), whereas 40% of <lb/>33 <lb/>Article 33 of the RoP specifies the cases; the reason for the use of the emergency procedure shall be clearly <lb/>reported to the Government and the Minister responsible for the proposal shall, immediately after the <lb/>Government&apos;s discussion of the proposal, ensure that the procedures required under this regulation are <lb/>complied with and reported to the Government as soon as practicable. <lb/></body>

			<note place="footnote">34 <lb/>According to the interviewed official at the GCS. <lb/></note>

			<page>34 <lb/></page>

			<body>items are included three to four days before the Government session takes place. Only 1% of agenda <lb/>items are added at the very last minute or through the urgency procedure described in the RoP. An <lb/>average of ten items per agenda is manageable for the OPM. <lb/>In a comparatively small administration with many issues on its agenda which require a rather rapid <lb/>response from the Government, the 15-day submission deadline is too restrictive for ministries, and is <lb/>therefore often not followed. An average of four items out of ten submitted three to four days before <lb/>the session suggests that this is indeed the case. As three to four days does not provide the OPM enough <lb/>time to handle the dossier according to normal working practices, a high volume of late submissions can <lb/>lead to overburdening of the OPM structures and decreasing the quality of their input. Sufficient time for <lb/>processing the materials is crucial: in addition to the basic technical checks, more time allows for <lb/>high-quality analytical input and deeper involvement with the substance of the materials. <lb/>The GCS has a main co-ordination role concerning Government decision making preparations and <lb/>monitoring its decisions. The LO and the SPO are contributing in their area of responsibility in relation to <lb/>legislation, and strategies and priority items, respectively. Both departments routinely provide input on <lb/>dossiers submitted by the ministries. These departments are also involved in the earlier stages of policy <lb/>development, guiding and advising ministries on preparing items to be approved by the Government, as <lb/>well as supporting initiation of relevant preparatory processes. <lb/>The LO is involved in the preparation of draft laws from the very initial phase. For example, the MTI has <lb/>created a working group for drafting an amendment to the Law on Consumers, of which a representative <lb/>of the LO is a member. If a ministry decides not to create a working group for drafting a law, the person <lb/>in charge within the ministry has to inform the LO of their progress monthly. Once the ministry approves <lb/>the first draft, the legal department sends it to the LO for comments. The final draft is sent once more to <lb/>the LO for its opinion. The SPO also participates in the strategy development process managed by <lb/>ministries. The prioritisation of issues takes into account the limited resources of the SPO, but active <lb/>support for the ministries in the preparatory stages is an opportunity for the OPM which could be better <lb/>exploited. It increases the quality of the materials submitted by the ministries and decreases the <lb/>workload of processing the files submitted to Government sessions. <lb/>In leading and co-ordinating EI-related decision making and policy development, the MEI has <lb/>under-exploited its existing tools available to incorporate EI commitments into national working <lb/>practices, to act as a watchdog and quality controller of the acquis transposition and give valuable <lb/>feedback to ministries on the matter. Evidence considered from only a few examples of randomly <lb/>selected and translated legal opinions prepared by the MEI showed that the analysed opinions <lb/>concentrate on formalities rather than on content. One ministry demonstrated the case by stressing that <lb/>it had to redraft and resubmit one quarter of all legislative acts in 2012, which had previously been given <lb/>the green light from the MEI via its legal opinions. It later emerged that these acts failed to transpose the <lb/>directives they were supposed to. Also, the MEI concentrated only on the text of the law itself, without <lb/>addressing possible problems in achieving the aims of the acquis. The MEI&apos;s capacity to give meaningful <lb/>feedback thus remains a challenge. The recent decision of the MEI to assign members of staff in the <lb/>relevant departments as contact points for each ministry, and to co-ordinate activities between the MEI <lb/>and relevant ministry therefore merits approval. <lb/>The MEI employed in 2013 four to five lawyers, and although the anticipated number of staff members is <lb/>seven, this will still not be enough to cope with the workload. It is also clear that the real expertise of the <lb/>sectoral acquis should be developed within the ministries. The MEI should focus not only on the <lb/>approximation of the text of law itself but also more on possible problems regarding delivery of the aims <lb/>of the acquis. As the EU itself will increasingly emphasise the need to achieve actual and measurable <lb/>progress in different policy fields (on commitments made by Kosovo), in order to proceed with the EI <lb/>process the MEI could also replicate this in national planning by putting more emphasis in the planning <lb/></body>

			<body>documents on achieving measurable progress of real outcomes on the ground. An outcome-based <lb/>approach is not anything new, and is already used by the MTI in defining their yearly priorities 35 . This <lb/>practice could be developed further by enhancing the MEI&apos;s capacity to lead this shift and provide <lb/>feedback to guide ministries should be planned. <lb/>In this respect, the decision of MEI to nominate members of its staff in relevant departments as <lb/>contact-points for each ministry, to serve as focal points for co-ordination activities between MEI and the <lb/>ministry, merits approval. The Government should focus in the coming years on strengthening the <lb/>capacities in the central co-ordination bodies (OMP, MEI, MoF). <lb/>35 <lb/>The booklet entited &quot; MTI priorities of 2013 &quot; not only sets desired qualitative aims and outcomes but also <lb/>tries to budget for and co-ordinate the use of different aid programmes for different tasks. <lb/></body>

			<body>2 <lb/>POLICY DEVELOPMENT IN MINISTRIES <lb/>2.1 <lb/>Legislative framework <lb/>The new policy development procedures and requirements ministries must follow were established in <lb/>the RoP adopted in 2011 and enforced at the beginning of 2012. Compared with the previous version, <lb/>the RoP introduced new elements for enhancing the use of policy analysis and changed the <lb/>interministerial consultation and co-operation principles used for policy development. <lb/>Since the beginning of 2012, the originating body of a draft policy proposal is obliged to send a policy <lb/>analysis or concept document for approval to the Government before drafting the legislative act. Within <lb/>a month of the approval of the policy analysis/concept paper, the responsible ministry should start <lb/>drafting the legislative acts in compliance with the deadlines set out in the approved GAWP 36 . <lb/>Concept papers usually precede new primary legislation or amendments to primary legislation, <lb/>important secondary legislation, and recommendations that have significant social, economic or other <lb/>impacts. Concept documents also precede proposals that have high implementation costs, or represent <lb/>important Government or ministry priorities 37 . <lb/>Interministerial consultation is required for all policy proposals, although there is no requirement to <lb/>consult all ministries, only the central state administration and those affected by the proposal. The <lb/>requirement to create inter-ministry working groups was in place from 2007 to 2011 but discontinued <lb/>under the current RoP 38 . It is too early to say whether and what impact this has had on the policy making <lb/>process. The process is summarised in Figure 4. <lb/>Ministries have 15 working days to comment on the proposal, although this deadline can be shortened if <lb/>the ministry needs a more timely response for reasons of genuine urgency outside its control, or <lb/>lengthened if a more thorough examination is required. 39 <lb/>Requirements for consultation are mandatory and ministries should consult relevant institutions in <lb/>advance of drafting concept papers, explanatory memorandum, draft laws or sub-legal acts, a strategic <lb/>plan of a ministry or a sectorial strategy for deliberation by the Government. Key government <lb/>stakeholders who must be consulted are well defined, and the RoP also covers the list of institutions <lb/>which should be consulted when defined criteria are met. The originating body is also obliged to consult <lb/>the public 40 . The RoP specifies which institution and stakeholders should be consulted and at which stage <lb/>of the proposal. <lb/>36 <lb/>Articles 28, 29 and 38 of the RoP. <lb/>37 <lb/>Article 29 of the RoP. <lb/>38 <lb/>Articles 38 to 41 of the RoP. <lb/>39 <lb/>Article 7 of the RoP. <lb/>40 <lb/>Articles 7 and 32 of the RoP mandate consultation. <lb/></body>

			<page>37 <lb/></page>

			<body>Figure 4. Stakeholders in the interministerial consultation process <lb/>Source: The RoP, interviews. <lb/>The RoP does not specify what methods of consultation should be used, but does make it clear that the <lb/>originating body is obliged to send the concept paper or draft law to the relevant institution for <lb/>consultation and, once the consultation is closed, detail the comments received from the other bodies <lb/>together with an indication of whether such comments were incorporated in the proposal and, if not, the <lb/>reasons why 41 . <lb/>Analysis of main challenges <lb/>Kosovo has made good progress in enhancing its approach to policy development, although the process <lb/>is still hampered by varying skills and capacities within the ministries and poor availability of data and <lb/>statistics. The RoP provides a sufficient policy development framework for the ministries, which follows <lb/>practices used in the EU and OECD countries. <lb/>41 <lb/>Article 7 of the RoP. <lb/></body>

			<page>38 <lb/></page>

			<body>Introducing the principle of using concept papers for policy analysis in the early phase of the policy <lb/>making process was a step in the right direction. The current RoP does not require ministries to establish <lb/>interministerial working groups for preparation of draft law/policy documents, so policy staff from other <lb/>ministries or the Government Secretariat may not be involved in the initial policy development phase. <lb/>However, ministries are still establishing internal working groups, where policy staff from other <lb/>ministries can be involved. This has been the case when policy papers were developed in 2012 by the <lb/>Ministry of Health (MH) and the Ministry of Culture, Youth and Sports (MCYS). The CoG is involved in the <lb/>prior consultation phase and when the ministries send the final draft to the GCS/LO. At these stages, <lb/>they are supposed to check the quality of the concept document or explanatory memorandum. The <lb/>newly introduced approach involves the risk of decreased policy consultations and may impact the <lb/>quality of legislation; however, it is too early yet to assess the functioning of the new system. <lb/>2.2 <lb/>Policy development arrangements and capacity in the ministries <lb/>2.2.1 <lb/>Policy development structures <lb/>The structure of the ministries and the responsibilities of management positions and departments are <lb/>outlined in each ministry&apos;s regulations on internal organisation and systematisation of positions. The <lb/>reorganisation of all ministries was taking place whilst this review was being conducted; this process is <lb/>co-ordinated by the MPA. As a general logic, all ministries should have a similar structure, composed of <lb/>policy departments, whose number and tasks are not centrally decided; functional departments, such as <lb/>the DEIPC and Legal Department (LD); and supporting departments, such as a Finance and General <lb/>Services Department, a Communication and Public Relations Division, a Public Procurement Division and <lb/>an Internal Audit Division. Each ministry is headed by the General Secretary, which has a small support <lb/>office. There is also the Cabinet of the Minister, consisting of Deputy Ministers, political advisers and <lb/>support staff. <lb/>The responsibilities of the two functional departments are determined through horizontal legislation. <lb/>The work of the legal departments is guided by several pieces of horizontal legislation, in particular by <lb/>the administrative instruction on organisation and scope of legal services of the Government of Kosovo 42 . <lb/>The creation of DEIPCs in all ministries was launched centrally in 2011. The authority and responsibilities <lb/>of these departments are established by regulation 01/2011, which details functions of DEIPCs for all <lb/>ministries except CoG institutions -the MEI, MoF and OPM -which have the flexibility to organise <lb/>themselves. These departments in the ministries are responsible for policy co-ordination and planning, <lb/>as well as co-ordinating EI issues. As a general rule, there are specific divisions within the DEIPC for <lb/>fulfilling those functions. <lb/>Whilst performing their tasks and duties, ministries tend to maintain regular co-operation with the OPM, <lb/>MEI, and the MoF. The guidance for the EI agenda to these departments comes from the MEI, and the <lb/>guidance for the strategic planning and identification of ministerial priorities comes from the SPO of the <lb/>OPM. Relations with the MoF are not formalised and/or institutionalised. <lb/>Analysis of main challenges <lb/>The reorganisation of the organisational structures of ministries creates the opportunity to establish <lb/>policy development roles within ministries more clearly, and integrate functional departments into <lb/></body>

			<note place="footnote">42 <lb/>Administrative instruction No. 13/2007 on &quot; Organisation and Scope of Legal Services of the Executive <lb/>Branch – Government of Kosovo &quot; sets the structure and functions of Legal Departments, which are <lb/>responsible for, among other things, drafting policies and legislative strategies, drafting primary and <lb/>secondary legislation and ensuring the compatibility of laws and other bylaws with the EU acquis. <lb/></note>

			<page>39 <lb/></page>

			<body>mainstream structures and working practices within each ministry. Similar organisational structures <lb/>should support interministerial co-operation and make administration more transparent. <lb/>However, analysis of the regulations on internal organisation and the systematisation of working <lb/>positions reveals that responsibilities for policy development are often not explicitly set out in the <lb/>regulations. As a general practice, in EU and OECD countries, policy development is a key function of the <lb/>administrative apparatus of the ministry, with responsibilities determined at a higher managerial level <lb/>and clear functions established for policy departments. In the case of Kosovo, the analysis of regulations <lb/>from five ministries approved by the Government up to April 2013, reveals a common pattern where a <lb/>triad – the LD, DEIPCs and line departments ─ are involved in policy development and drafting of <lb/>legislation, but it is not clear who takes the lead. In most cases, line departments ensure implementation <lb/>of policies, analyse situations and handle monitoring as well as data collection. A commonly used term <lb/>for responsibility over legislative processes is &quot; co-operation with the Legal Department in drafting <lb/>legislation. &quot; Terminology varies more in the developing of policies and strategies where, in some cases, <lb/>line departments are expected to draft policies and, in other cases, contribute to policy development. <lb/>Often, common terminology is not applied for all line departments at the same ministry; rather, each <lb/>department has its own interpretation of the roles. <lb/>According to regulations on the internal organisation of ministries, in cases where policy development <lb/>responsibility is clearly set, it is assigned to a department and its director, who fulfils this responsibility in <lb/>co-operation with other departments and with the Cabinet of the Minister. Higher administrative <lb/>managerial positions – the General Secretaries, for example – are not formally responsible for policy <lb/>development; however, they submit the dossier to the OPM for the Government sessions. Interviews in <lb/>sample ministries confirmed that policy development happens mainly at the level of the department and <lb/>has a rather technical nature. Final policy decisions are taken in the Cabinet of the Minister, which <lb/>processes all the files before they are sent out from the ministry. <lb/>The policy development capacity of the ministries remains a challenge due to staffing: policy <lb/>development departments still account for only a modest share of overall positions compared to <lb/>enforcement and administrative support functions. Figure 5 below illustrates the distribution of staff <lb/>across the four key functions within two line ministries 43 . <lb/>In OECD and EU countries, ministries have different types and functions, for example in some countries <lb/>the whole enforcement staff (e.g. tax inspectors or teachers) is ministry officials and belong to the <lb/>department of the ministry. Therefore, comparisons between the countries are hard to make. However, <lb/>some conclusions can be drawn when analysing ministries in a given country and comparing results with <lb/>the countries with similar administration set-up. <lb/>43 <lb/>The categorisation of staff is made according to four categories: 1) Policy; 2) Enforcement; 3) Functional <lb/>support, such as legal departments and co-ordination of EU affairs; 4) Administrative support staff. To <lb/>enable more precise analysis and to demonstrate that ministries have different type of tasks, one category <lb/>(enforcement) was added to the categories used by Kosovo authorities in the reorganisation process. This <lb/>approximate categorisation was undertaken by SIGMA, based on commonly recognised roles within <lb/>government administrations. The Secretary-General&apos;s Office and the Cabinet of the Minister are excluded <lb/>from the data set, as the aim was to compare staff numbers in key departments. <lb/></body>

Share of positions in different departments <lb/>MTI <lb/>MAFRD <lb/>Source: Data provided by MTI and MAFRD through questionnaire. <lb/>Although the cases of these two ministries do not provide a complete picture (in MAFRD enforcement <lb/>functions is understandably more relevant compared with the MTI), they allow indicative conclusions to <lb/>be drawn. When excluding the enforcement function, the share of administrative staff is more numerous <lb/>in both ministries compared with the number of staff in line departments. <lb/>Figure 6.

			<page>41 <lb/></page>

			<body>Analysing the allocation of positions in the Ministry of Local Government Administration 44 confirms these <lb/>conclusions. 31% of positions (41 in total) were allocated to policy development departments. Out of <lb/>those, around 40% deal directly with policy development issues and 60% concentrate more on <lb/>enforcement. The share of functional departments is 25% and administrative departments is 44%. Such a <lb/>distribution of resources impairs the capacity of the ministries to handle the policy development <lb/>workload and implement a high-quality process with proper policy analysis. <lb/>Ministries have generally launched structures to deal with EI co-ordination, strategic planning and policy <lb/>development. Departments for EI and Policy Co-ordination (with slight variations in precise title) exist in <lb/>all ministries. However, as the ministries were free to choose how best to arrange the new structure, <lb/>there are still three ministries which have other units with a similar mandate, which risks confusion and <lb/>duplication of functions. For example, the MIA has the department for co-ordination and the DEIPC, and <lb/>the MPA has the DEIPC and the department of PAR, whose scope is similar. <lb/>These departments are embryonic and suffering from some challenges. They are not fully staffed and are <lb/>not widely recognised within some ministries. For example, in Kosovo&apos;s 2013 Budget Law, only three <lb/>ministries (MTI, MoF and MJ) made note of a separate EI department; the other ministries have <lb/>submerged the department within the subheading &quot; central administration &quot; and the average staffing rate <lb/>at the end of 2012 was 78%. As the DEIPCs are relatively new and were set-up by a central order, it is not <lb/>surprising that the actual profile of the departments and their ability to fulfil these tasks varies <lb/>considerably. The actual capacities of all structures to implement ambitious goals are very limited. <lb/>Still, some promising bright spots such as the MTI seem to be emerging already. In the MTI, the EI <lb/>department has been able to partly fulfil the tasks of a policy co-ordination unit, leading the preparation <lb/>of horizontal strategies (merging the existing 11 into a single horizontal strategy) and co-ordinating the <lb/>preparation of the Ministry&apos;s annual plans (including budgetary plans). But in most cases they seem to <lb/>lack an actual presence within ministries&apos; policy making processes and thus have little impact on content. <lb/>The majority of EI departments in the ministries seem to function as post offices with little capacity and <lb/>limited expertise on substance. <lb/>In most cases, the EI departments are also not sufficiently staffed. Moreover, neither the actual nor <lb/>planned staff numbers adequately reflect the needs deriving from planned obligations a given ministry&apos;s <lb/>EI department must monitor and report on, or generally co-ordinate and give input into, as per the 2013 <lb/>SAA Action Plan. The analysis summarised in Figure 7 indicates that the EI departments in at least three <lb/>ministries, MTI, MESP and MIA, have larger workloads in comparison with obligations than those in other <lb/>ministries. <lb/>44 <lb/>Regulation No. 03/2013 on the Internal Organisation and Systematisation of Jobs in the MLGA. <lb/></body>

			<body>Figure 7. Obligations foreseen in the 2013 SAA Action Plan in comparison with staff numbers <lb/>Source: MEI, APSAA 2013. <lb/>The above chart is, of course, indicative and fails to present a comprehensive picture. For example, the <lb/>obligations for the MAFRD are probably higher in reality, as the Veterinary and Food Agency (curiously <lb/>formally under the PM&apos;s structure) has a number of obligations, including legislative and regulative, that <lb/>are not covered in the analyses, but involve the MAFRD at least indirectly. Nevertheless, it indicates <lb/>broad trends and gaps. In this regard, the MoF, MH and MI also have a considerable number of <lb/>obligations in comparison with staff members in their EI departments. It is important to note that the <lb/>picture does not change when the number of obligations is compared to the overall number of <lb/>employees in ministries&apos; central administrations, or those in the offices of ministers. If anything, the <lb/>contrasts between the &apos;overburdened&apos; and the rest become even sharper (Table 5). The need to <lb/>strengthen the staff capacities of the more overburdened ministries is clear. As any additional budgetary <lb/>allocations will be limited, the budgetary applications for additional staff recruitment in the more <lb/>burdened ministries should be a priority. Only once their essential needs are satisfied should the staff of <lb/>DEIPCs in the rest of the ministries be increased. <lb/>0 <lb/>1 <lb/>2 <lb/>3 <lb/>4 <lb/>5 <lb/>6 <lb/>7 <lb/>8 <lb/>9 <lb/>10 <lb/>0 <lb/>10 <lb/>20 <lb/>30 <lb/>40 <lb/>50 <lb/>60 <lb/>70 <lb/>80 <lb/>90 <lb/>100 <lb/>MTI <lb/>MESP <lb/>MIA <lb/>MF <lb/>MH <lb/>MI <lb/>OPM <lb/>MED <lb/>MAFRD <lb/>MLSW <lb/>MJ <lb/>MEST <lb/>MPA <lb/>MLGA <lb/>MFA <lb/>MEI <lb/>MCYS <lb/>MCR <lb/>MKSF <lb/>MD <lb/>Number <lb/>of <lb/>staff <lb/>in <lb/>European <lb/>Integration <lb/>(EI) departments <lb/>Number <lb/>of <lb/>obligations <lb/>planned <lb/>in <lb/>the <lb/>2013 <lb/>Action <lb/>Plan <lb/>on <lb/>SAA <lb/>Responsible ministry <lb/>Total number of <lb/>obligations <lb/>planned <lb/>Number of <lb/>legislative <lb/>obligations (laws, <lb/>regulations) <lb/>planned <lb/>Number of staff in <lb/>EI dep (actual) <lb/>Number of staff in <lb/>EI dep (planned) <lb/></body>

			<body>2.2.2 <lb/>Policy development processes <lb/>The policy development process as established by the RoP, and the main principles of policy <lb/>development and interministerial consultation, were already described in this review. Here it is analysed <lb/>how responsible stakeholders are implementing the principles and to what extent the process is <lb/>followed by the ministries. Special attention is given to the implementation of novelties introduced with <lb/>the new RoP, namely conducting policy analysis and holding interministerial consultations. <lb/>Policy analysis includes the consideration of different options and their consequences in order that the <lb/>Government can make adequately informed decisions. The extent and complexity of the analysis should <lb/>be proportionate to the importance of the issue, for example where it ranks in the Government&apos;s <lb/>strategic priorities. The policy analysis shall be conducted with the preparation of a concept paper or <lb/>explanatory memorandum and, in some cases, a fiscal analysis. Guidelines for conducting a FIA are <lb/>issued by the MoF and are annexed to the RoP. The annex covers both the process and format for fiscal <lb/>assessments. Whilst this review was conducted, the MoF was developing instructions for determining <lb/>the form, content and procedures and cost of new policy initiatives. Separate guidelines for preparing <lb/>policy papers are established by the OPM. <lb/>There are some requirements and mechanisms in place for planning implementation in the policy <lb/>development process, but these are not uniform. Not all materials submitted to the Government require <lb/>an implementation plan. For example for two key topics – the GAWP and legislation – there is no such <lb/>requirement. However, or strategic documents, details about implementation are required to be <lb/>submitted 45 . The FIA has a section which addresses implementation issues including guarantees, loans, <lb/>or other actual or contingent obligations on the Government. There is no requirement to conduct an <lb/>ex-post evaluation of implementation of Government policies. However, there are monitoring <lb/>arrangements in place to assess the implementation of the GAWP and other decisions of the <lb/>Government. <lb/>During the interministerial consultation process, the MoF, the OPM, the MEI and other relevant <lb/>institutions are consulted twice: on the first and on the final drafts. A ministry shall submit the final draft <lb/>of the law/proposal to the Secretariat 15 days before the Government meeting at which it is to be <lb/>discussed. This permits the Government Secretariat to verify that the materials are complete and can be <lb/>submitted to the Government meeting for approval. Relevant line ministries and other stakeholders are <lb/>consulted once, on the first official draft. <lb/>The consultation process with non-governmental stakeholders shall be conducted in accordance with the <lb/>Guidelines for Public Consultation Process 46 . They specify that the originating ministry shall publish the <lb/>substance of its proposal for public comment and shall specifically seek the comments of any <lb/>non-governmental organisation that would be affected substantially by the proposal. In conducting this <lb/>consultation, the originating body shall provide sufficient information in a publicly understandable form <lb/>to permit the public to comprehend the nature and consequences of the proposal. The originating body <lb/>also must publicly announce the beginning of the consultation and permit sufficient time for the public <lb/>and non-governmental organisations to consider the recommendations and offer a considered <lb/>response 47 . The results of such consultations shall be reported to the Government meeting or Ministerial <lb/>Committee as part of the concept document or explanatory memorandum. The Guidelines do not specify <lb/>a minimum or maximum period of time allowed for a Government response. <lb/>45 <lb/>Article 10 of administrative instruction 02/2012 on preparing Strategic Documents and Plans for their <lb/>Implementation. <lb/></body>

			<body>Concerning the internal processes of the ministries in submitting materials to the Government session, <lb/>the General Secretary of each ministry is designated to submit all required documentation to the <lb/>relevant part of the OPM. The legal department sends the first and final drafts to the General Secretary <lb/>and Cabinet of the Minister through the General Secretary. However, the materials for the proposed <lb/>laws are not always reviewed at the meeting of the General Secretary and the Directors of Department 48 . <lb/>Co-operation between key functional departments and line departments has an informal nature; there <lb/>are normally no formal internal procedures, and in each ministry the process depends on the leverage of <lb/>each department and traditional working practices. <lb/>The ministries have new challenges in the policy development process derived from the SAA <lb/>negotiations, and more widely from the intensified EI process. The legal framework for transposing the <lb/>acquis is in place. However, the capacity of the ministries to follow the requirements and successfully <lb/>fulfil the tasks required by the SAA process depends mainly on their ability to fully develop and make use <lb/>of the system of tables of concordance. Although some ministries have already made the first steps in <lb/>using this tool, the instrument is not yet fully functional and although the Parliament&apos;s RoP foresee that <lb/>all draft laws submitted by the Government will be accompanied by the tables, the executive does not <lb/>yet have the capacity to deliver on this. <lb/>Analysis of main challenges <lb/>The policy development structures in ministries are small, but they have proved to be effective and have <lb/>been used flexibly, notably through working groups, to mobilise resources for particular analytical or <lb/>preparatory work required prior to the elaboration of new policies. Interministerial and public <lb/>consultation works routinely, but is often partial and at a fairly late stage in the drafting process. <lb/>In total, 47 concept papers were submitted to the Government by 11 ministries in 2012. The largest <lb/>number of them was developed by the MIA and the MoF (7 each). A sample of 15 concept papers was <lb/>evaluated, which highlighted the varying quality of the analysis 49 . The examples analysed show that <lb/>ministries do tend to fulfil the requirements of a concept paper, but the level of detail within each of the <lb/>seven required sections, such as problem analysis and results of consultation with civil society, can be <lb/>variable 50 . The policy analysis in the concept papers tends to be fairly superficial, often without financial <lb/>analysis, or it is narrowly focussed on whether the proposal is affordable within the current budgetary <lb/>agreement rather than in terms of the systemic impact (e.g. whether the proposal would impose costs <lb/>on businesses). <lb/>There could be greater alignment between concept papers and key strategic planning documents and <lb/>budget management. The budgetary detail included in concept papers demonstrates an inconsistent <lb/>approach to conducting budgetary impact analyses, and the level of detail and rigour is varied. The <lb/>scheduling and handling of concept papers within the budgetary and policy making process has not yet <lb/>matured to the point where the papers can maximise their impact on decision making. Whilst some are <lb/></body>

			<note place="footnote">48 <lb/>The Director of the Legal Department should report about how the drafting process has taken place and, at <lb/>the cabinet level, one of the Advisers of the Minister is supposed to review the materials.

Compliance with the requirements for concept papers <lb/>Source: analysis of 15 concept documents submitted to the OPM by ministries in 2012. <lb/>The capability of ministries to plan ahead and to include implementation costs, as well as the capacity to <lb/>scrutinise draft proposals within the CoG remains challenging. The ministries claim they do not have the <lb/>capacity to carry out these tasks, as the requests are disproportionate to the number of assigned staff. <lb/>Moreover, the instrument of the concept paper is a new process for the GCS and line ministries and, as a <lb/>result, their capacities are limited. <lb/>Ministries have begun to follow new requirements for interministerial consultations, although <lb/>mechanisms and policy development deal more with process than content. Consultation input from <lb/>external organisations is virtually non-existent. Random examples of consulting non-governmental <lb/>stakeholders demonstrated good implementation of procedures, but feedback from them was very <lb/>limited. For example, a draft law on Geographical Indications was sent by the MTI to all relevant business <lb/>associations: no feedback was received from any of them. This is unfortunate, as consultation brings <lb/>many benefits, including a greater likelihood of the proposed changes working, as stakeholders have <lb/>been involved in the development of the solution from the outset and government processes become <lb/>more transparent and accountable to the public. This process enables both governments and citizens to <lb/>understand the costs and benefits of potential changes and to make informed decisions about legislation <lb/>that affects their lives. <lb/>The implementation of new principles for the transposition of the acquis, and using the tables of <lb/>concordance in policy development, are still in their early phases.

			<body>legislative drafting. As there has not been any systematic screening exercise, the ministries do not <lb/>appear to know which parts of EU legislation are relevant in different policy fields or where to find this <lb/>information. There also does not appear to be a database which could be used to organise and save the <lb/>relevant information which will be accumulated over time. This issue may be settled in a centralised <lb/>manner as the LO has plans to establish a database, which could also accommodate information <lb/>regarding transposition. <lb/>There is also some confusion within the ministries regarding the division of labour between the Legal <lb/>Departments and DEIPCs. The recently adopted Regulation on Legal Services should make the necessary <lb/>clarifications. According to it, the legal departments of line ministries will be responsible for the tables of <lb/>concordance ─ ensuring that they are accurate, formulated according to instructions, etc. ─ and <lb/>co-ordinating the work of transposition. In this context, the issue of co-operation between the DEIPCs <lb/>and legal departments of ministries merits some further clarification. It has happened that when <lb/>ministries have to respond to new demands (for example, requests to respond to European Commission <lb/>questions), DEIPCs are sometimes side-lined and issues are passed directly to legal departments or <lb/>operational/functional departments in the ministries. As DEIPCs are in charge of overall monitoring and <lb/>reporting of the EI process, they should be part of the discussion or at least be informed. In the course of <lb/>enacting the new procedures, ministries must strengthen the link between strategic planning and <lb/>monitoring of the EI process (both done by DEIPCs) and execution of transposition (co-ordinated by the <lb/>legal departments). <lb/>Second, practices in implementing normative standards of transposition are still limited. It is <lb/>commendable that the MEI (in co-operation with GIZ) has prepared a practical manual on how to fulfil <lb/>the tables, which should help the ministries to execute this new obligation; however, a prioritised <lb/>approach is needed both to launching new transpositions rules and providing capacity building to <lb/>ministries. <lb/>Third, due to the limited number of people in the ministries who have a good knowledge of English (or <lb/>any other EU official language), there is a lack of comprehension of the acquis (especially in the legal <lb/>departments). <lb/>Another crucial functional capacity which must be enhanced within the ministries in order to deliver the <lb/>implementation goals the SAA process envisions, is forward budgetary planning. For example, in the <lb/>2012 EPAP, the MESP had 14 laws to draft with a deadline of 2012, including the &quot; Law on Kosovo <lb/>waters &quot; , the &quot; Law on Nuclear Security and Protection from Radiation &quot; and &quot; Amending and <lb/>Supplementing the Law on Chemicals &quot; . The total financial impact of these 14 laws (which also included <lb/>waste management) was estimated at EUR 5 000 51 . The reason for such a small sum is that only the cost <lb/>of drafting the necessary bills (legal consultation, possible foreign expertise) was planned and thus linked <lb/>with the budget, but the actual implementation costs were not. Although costs are generally foreseen in <lb/>the second phase (after legislation has been promulgated and implementation measures are drafted), <lb/>the lack of foresight in the legislative phase has hampered the ministries&apos; ability to ensure proper funding <lb/>for implementation. Many interviewees pointed to foreign assistance as the main source of funding, <lb/>used by more enterprising ministries to ensure coverage of implementation costs for new legislation. <lb/>This system, however, is not sustainable. The proper use of concept papers could be one way of <lb/>enhancing forward planning in the ministries. <lb/>51 <lb/>EPAP 2012, page 85. <lb/></body>

			<body>3 <lb/>POLICY MAKING IN PARLIAMENT <lb/>This chapter examines the role of the Assembly of Kosovo in policy making. The review is prepared with a <lb/>number of assumptions about the role of parliaments in the policy process. First, parliaments have a <lb/>positive contribution to make throughout all stages of the policy cycle, including: agenda-setting, policy <lb/>formulation, decision-taking, implementation and evaluation, though the relative emphases vary. <lb/>Second, the orientation towards enhancing the quality of public action and public policy affects not only <lb/>the legislative process, but also other key functions, such as the budgetary process, parliamentary <lb/>oversight and control over the executive, and parliamentary involvement in EU integration. Third, whilst <lb/>the focus of this review is on the internal conditions shaping the impact of the Assembly on public policy <lb/>making, this contribution is decisively influenced by the quality of interinstitutional relationships, most <lb/>notably with the Government, but also with public sector institutions, civil society, and international <lb/>bodies. Finally, a policy-focused analysis needs to focus on both political and administrative structures <lb/>and procedures in Parliament. <lb/>The following analysis focuses on areas seen as critical to parliamentary policy making. Whilst the review <lb/>contains descriptive material, the emphasis is on highlighting potential bottlenecks within the <lb/>parliamentary policy process. It should be noted that some of the points highlighted have also been <lb/>raised in other documents, notably: the European Commission&apos;s Kosovo Analytical Report 2012, the <lb/>Commission&apos;s Feasibility Study for a Stabilisation and Association Agreement between the EU and <lb/>Kosovo 2012, the Joint Report to the European Parliament and the Council, on Kosovo&apos;s progress in <lb/>addressing issues set out in the Council Conclusions of December 2012 in view of a possible decision on <lb/>the opening of negotiations on the SAA of April 2013. <lb/>3.1 <lb/>Legal framework <lb/>The normative framework that regulates the policy related powers of the Assembly consists of a range of <lb/>sources, including, inter alia, the Constitution, notably its Chapter IV (Articles 63 to 82), and the RoP of <lb/>the Assembly, including several annexes. Some committees, such as the Committee for Budget and <lb/>Finance, have adopted additional RoP. A range of other laws also touch on individual aspects relevant to <lb/>the policy making powers and capacity of the Parliament, such as: the Law on the Financing of Political <lb/>Parties of 2010, amended and supplemented in 2011, which regulates, amongst other matters, the <lb/>provision of funds for parliamentary party groups; legal acts that contain the reporting requirements of <lb/>the public authorities and independent regulatory bodies to the Assembly; laws on financial <lb/>management and accountability, which spell out the powers of the Assembly in the different stages of <lb/>the budget process; and the Law on the Civil Service, which also applies to most Assembly staff. In sum, <lb/>there exists a fairly differentiated legal framework with a clear hierarchy of norms. Moreover, the <lb/>Assembly has adopted a number of &quot; manuals &quot; intended to set out the best procedural practices in a <lb/>number of areas, including: the organisation of work in committees; the holding of committee hearings; <lb/>the consultation of external experts in committees; and the exercise of the oversight and control <lb/>functions at the committee level. <lb/>Analysis of main challenges <lb/>Although Kosovo is still in the early stages of its path towards the EU, it is worth considering the early <lb/>adoption of a comprehensive legal framework that would set out the principles and practices governing <lb/>executive-legislative relations in matters pertaining to EU integration. The Assembly&apos;s RoP regulate the <lb/>powers of the Committee for European Integration, but they do not establish anything approaching a <lb/>comprehensive framework for the effective parliamentarisation of the integration process. In any case, it <lb/>is debatable what normative force the RoP possess vis-à-vis the Government and the President of <lb/>Kosovo. This is in contrast to some EU Member States, such as Germany, with its Law on Co-operation <lb/></body>

			<page>49 <lb/></page>

			<body>between the Federal Government and the German Bundestag in matters concerning the EU and the Law <lb/>on Responsibility for Integration, or Denmark, where the Parliament has agreed on a series of legally <lb/>binding reports with the Government on how to handle EU-related matters. <lb/>3.2 <lb/>Institutional framework <lb/>The key elements of the institutional framework include: the Assembly&apos;s Presidency, the parliamentary <lb/>party groups, the plenary, four parliamentary standing committees and nine functional committees, and <lb/>the administration of the Assembly. <lb/>3.2.1 <lb/>Assembly Presidency <lb/>The main political leadership structure is the Presidency, which consists of the President of the Assembly <lb/>and five Vice Presidents. It is charged with planning and steering the work of the Assembly. The agendas <lb/>of its meetings are publicly available and show that the Presidency is centrally concerned with arranging <lb/>the flow of work for the plenary sessions. For this purpose, it also holds regular meetings with the heads <lb/>of the parliamentary groups. <lb/>Analysis of main challenges <lb/>At least three points deserve highlighting. First, the President of the Assembly performs a political <lb/>function rather than a primarily ceremonial function, as in some European parliaments. The President <lb/>has his own cabinet, including a Chief of Cabinet, a senior political advisor, and advisers for information, <lb/>legal matters, protocol and international relations, and economic affairs. Members of the President&apos;s <lb/>cabinet are appointed by the President and do not belong to the civil service of the Assembly <lb/>administration. Second, the Presidency, as a whole, is regarded as a political body. Thus, the total of 30 <lb/>staff currently working for the Presidency – including chauffeurs – are not subject to the civil service <lb/>legislation that governs the employment of the administrative staff of the Assembly. Their employment <lb/>is tied to the term of office of the Presidency. Third, as will be discussed below, meetings of the <lb/>Presidency are not attended by a representative of the Government, although Article 16 of the RoP <lb/>allows for such participation without voting rights. <lb/>3.2.2 <lb/>Parliamentary party groups <lb/>As in any parliamentary system, the parliamentary party groups play a key role in structuring the work of <lb/>the Assembly. There are currently eight parliamentary groups, ranging in size from 6 to 34 members. <lb/>There are also six Deputies who do not belong to a group. Some of the groups contain members from <lb/>several political parties, i.e. political parties and party groups are not identical. <lb/>Analysis of main challenges <lb/>For a number of reasons, it is difficult for the groups to promote the professionalisation and <lb/>specialisation in the work of Deputies that is required to deal with the Assembly&apos;s complex tasks. Only <lb/>the members of the Presidency, the heads of parliamentary groups and chairpersons of committees have <lb/>their own offices at the seat of the Assembly, whereas other Deputies do not have access to dedicated <lb/>office facilities or assistants. The parliamentary party groups themselves employ some advisory staff, but <lb/>these serve primarily the leadership of the group. Six of the eight groups are small, with between 6 and <lb/>12 members; only the Democratic League of Kosovo and the Democratic Party of Kosovo have 27 and 34 <lb/>members respectively. In the case of groups consisting of members of several parties, cohesion is low. It <lb/>is also noteworthy that during the IVth Assembly, 17 elected Deputies have so far resigned their <lb/>positions (for a variety of reasons, including the incompatibility of a parliamentary mandate and the <lb/>Government office), adding further pressures to the policy making capacities of the groups. <lb/></body>

			<page>50 <lb/></page>

			<body>3.2.3 <lb/>Plenary and committees <lb/>The main working bodies of the Assembly include the plenary; four standing committees – the <lb/>Committees for Budget and Finance; Rights, Interests of Communities and Returns; Legislation; and EI. <lb/>There are also nine functional committees, dealing with: 1. Foreign Affairs; 2. Economic Development, <lb/>Infrastructure and Industries; 3. Internal Affairs, Security and Supervision of the Kosovo Security Force; 4. <lb/>Human Rights, Gender Equality, Missing Persons and Petitions; 5. Education, Culture, Youth, Sports, <lb/>Public Administration, Local Government and Media; 6. Health, Labour and Social Welfare; 7. Agriculture, <lb/>Forestry, Environment and Spatial Planning; 8. Oversight of the Kosovo Intelligence Agency, and 9. <lb/>Oversight of Public Finances. There is also a sub-committee of the Standing Committee for Legislation <lb/>dealing with mandates, immunities and the rules of the Assembly. Finally, as will be explained at greater <lb/>length below, Assembly committees regularly form working groups to deal with individual bills. Each <lb/>standing committee has a dedicated support staff of four members of the Assembly administration. The <lb/>functional committees are normally served by two staff each. The meetings of both committees and <lb/>working groups for the consideration of bills are invariably attended by committee staff. <lb/>Analysis of main challenges <lb/>An examination of the Assembly&apos;s workload underlines its character as a &quot; working parliament &quot; . As Figure <lb/>9 shows, there are weekly or biweekly plenary meetings during the two annual sessions and most <lb/>committees also meet at least once a week during that time. <lb/>Figure 9: Assembly workload 2011-2012 <lb/>Source: Activity reports of the Assembly of Kosovo, 2011 and 2012. <lb/>Figure 10 below indicates that the legislative workload of the Assembly is considerable. Legislation takes <lb/>up most of the time of the working groups, which consider bills in detail prior to their second reading, <lb/>and also makes up a large part of the agenda of committee meetings and sittings of the plenary. <lb/>Plenary meetings <lb/>Committee meetings <lb/>Working group meetings <lb/>2011 <lb/>44 <lb/>460 <lb/>297 <lb/>2012 <lb/>48 <lb/>563 <lb/>279 <lb/>0 <lb/>100 <lb/>200 <lb/>300 <lb/>400 <lb/>500 <lb/>600 <lb/></body>

			<body>Figure 10: Legislative output of the Assembly 2011-2012 <lb/>Source: Activity reports of the Assembly of Kosovo, 2011 and 2012. <lb/>The intensive schedule of meetings of the plenary, committees and working groups means that the <lb/>parliamentary support staff, notably the staff of the Division for Committee Support, devotes a large part <lb/>of their time preparing, attending and following up meetings during the two annual sessions of the <lb/>Assembly. As a consequence, time for other tasks, notably the detailed consideration of the reports of <lb/>independent agencies and reviews of the implementation of laws, is scarce. <lb/>3.2.4 <lb/>Assembly administration <lb/>The political structures are served by an Assembly administration, which is headed by the Secretary <lb/>General. At the end of 2012, the Assembly had filled 168 posts of 180 approved budgeted positions. Of <lb/>these, about two thirds, 109 staff, possessed a university level education; 96 were male, 72 female. The <lb/>recruitment plan of the Assembly for 2013 envisages the hiring of 11 new staff in total, including a Senior <lb/>Officer for Donor Co-ordination and Relations with Civil Society and two Senior Officers for Legislation in <lb/>the Department for Legal Standardisation and Harmonisation. As already noted, there are also 30 staff <lb/>working for the Presidency who operate outside the organisational structure of the main administration <lb/>(with the exception of two administrative assistants). A number of temporary interns also work at the <lb/>Assembly). <lb/>Analysis of main challenges <lb/>Several features of the Assembly administration merit further comment. First, it is notable that although <lb/>the overall staff number is not high, there is a considerable degree of organisational differentiation. <lb/>There is the Office of the Secretariat, the Department for Media and Public Relations, the Department <lb/>for Protocol and International Relations, and the Department for Procurement. There are also two main <lb/>General Departments – for Legal and Procedural Issues and for Administration – and nine departments <lb/>that report to them. Most of these departments are further divided into units. The organisational set-up <lb/>and associated job descriptions are based on acts of the Presidency. The current structure, with two <lb/>General Departments and nine departments is of recent origin. It was devised in the spring of 2012 and <lb/>became fully functional in the autumn of that year, and was accompanied by a rise in the number of <lb/>Draft laws processed <lb/>Draft laws adopted <lb/>Draft laws returned for <lb/>redrafting <lb/>2011 <lb/>94 <lb/>65 <lb/>2 <lb/>2012 <lb/>92 <lb/>69 <lb/>7 <lb/>0 <lb/>10 <lb/>20 <lb/>30 <lb/>40 <lb/>50 <lb/>60 <lb/>70 <lb/>80 <lb/>90 <lb/>100 <lb/></body>

			<body>positions of director in the administration. Participants in this process of organisational reform mention <lb/>several reasons for the growth in the number of departments: the desire to establish better direct <lb/>communication between the Secretary-General and staff, and the aim of improving responsibility in the <lb/>administration by increasing the number of managerial positions. <lb/>It is worth considering the allocation of staff across different functions. At present, the General <lb/>Department for Legal and Procedural Issues, with its four Departments for Plenary and Procedural Issues, <lb/>Parliamentary Committees, Standardisation and Legislative Harmonisation, and Research, Archive and <lb/>Library, employs merely a third of the overall Assembly staff. This means that direct support for the core <lb/>bodies and functions of the Assembly takes up a third of personnel capacity, whilst more indirect <lb/> &quot; backroom &quot; functions, such as procurement, IT, internal administration (budget and personnel), <lb/>transport, mail and supplies take up the remainder of resources. Considering the heavy emphasis on <lb/>legislative and oversight and control activities at the level of committees and working groups, the <lb/>number of officials servicing committees and working groups, 36 at present, is small. <lb/>There are also synergies in the work performed by the Committee for Legislation and its staff, on the one <lb/>hand, and the Unit for Legal Standardisation and Approximation, with three Senior Officers, on the other. <lb/>The Unit carries out an initial analysis of all bills prior to the first reading that focuses on the legal and <lb/>formal aspects of bills, their structure, approximation with EU legislation, and contains recommendations <lb/>regarding content, structure and legal-linguistic formulations, and remarks on the English and Serbian <lb/>versions. The Unit is also in charge of dealing with the finalisation of bills after the amendment process. <lb/>The Committee for Legislation also carries out a compliance assessment with domestic legislation, both <lb/>in its capacity as a standing committee, and as a functional committee during the committee stage of the <lb/>legislative process. <lb/>The Assembly administration does not, thus far, possess autonomy from the Government when it comes <lb/>to personnel policy and is subject to the same civil service legislation as the Government administration. <lb/>Prior to 2010, special regulations were in place that governed employment in the Assembly. More <lb/>critically, the ceiling of posts in the Assembly is set by the MoF, and recruitments require the prior <lb/>approval of the MPA. Thus, the start of recruitment procedures and the setting of grades and pay scales <lb/>can only happen with the Ministry&apos;s explicit authorisation. The dependency of the Assembly <lb/>administration on ministerial consent in matters of staffing is problematic. More generally, it is worth <lb/>recalling the comment in the 2012 Feasibility Study for a SAA between the EU and Kosovo that, &quot; The <lb/>financial and administrative independence of the Assembly from the Government needs to be <lb/>strengthened. This can be achieved through adopting legislation on the status of civil servants of the <lb/>Assembly. It is also important to ensure that the draft budget of the Assembly is modified by the <lb/>Government in consultation with the Assembly before the Government submits the budget proposal to <lb/>the Assembly for adoption &quot; . <lb/>3.3 <lb/>Key policy processes and instruments <lb/>3.3.1 <lb/>Managing parliamentary business and interinstitutional relationships <lb/>As noted above, the key responsibility for managing parliamentary business lies with the President of the <lb/>Assembly and the Presidency. One of their central tasks is to provide for effective timetabling of plenary <lb/>meetings during the two annual sessions, and to ensure that the time rules governing the legislative <lb/>process, the budgetary process and oversight and control procedures are adhered to. Timetabling of the <lb/>individual plenary sittings is done in consultation with the heads of parliamentary groups. The planning <lb/>of the work schedules of committees is decentralised. Committee chairpersons, working closely with <lb/>committee staff, are decisive in this respect. Both the Assembly, as a whole, and each committee adopt <lb/>an annual work plan. To a considerable extent, these work plans are reliant on the annual work plan of <lb/>the Government which, among other things, sets out the bills to be submitted during the course of the <lb/>year. For committees, a key question also to be decided is the allocation of committee time for oversight <lb/></body>

			<page>53 <lb/></page>

			<body>and control, notably the organisation of field visits, oversight hearings, the consideration of annual <lb/>reports from the ministries on the implementation of laws and the detailed scrutiny of the <lb/>implementation of individual laws. In 2011, the Assembly committees considered in depth the <lb/>implementation of 11 laws; in 2012 this dropped to 7 laws. <lb/>Analysis of main challenges <lb/>In the writing of this review, it was not possible to draw on data showing the percentage of the <lb/>Government&apos;s annual legislative programme that materialises in the form of bills submitted to the <lb/>Assembly. Nor was it possible to ascertain the percentage of the Government bills that had not <lb/>previously been announced in the legislative programme. Thus, it is difficult to gauge the reliability of the <lb/>legislative programme. The prevailing impression amongst interviewees was that the overall annual <lb/>legislative workload was predictably high. <lb/>However, problems of executive-legislative co-ordination affect the more detailed planning of <lb/>parliamentary activities. As noted earlier, there is no Government representative present at the <lb/>meetings of the Presidency, nor are there regular meetings at the level of the Secretary-General. There is <lb/>little co-ordination amongst the ministries when it comes to the timing of the submission of bills to the <lb/>Assembly. Thus, in 2011, 143 bills were expected to be submitted to the Assembly, but 49 were not <lb/>processed within the initially foreseen deadline. As a result, work flows for the standing committees, in <lb/>particular, can be very uneven. The lack of a key executive interlocutor, such as a Minister for Relations <lb/>with Parliament, creates problems when it comes to ensuring that parliamentary questions are answered <lb/>satisfactorily and on time. Thus, in 2012, out of the 160 parliamentary questions submitted for answering <lb/>by the Prime Minister and ministers, a quarter, 43, remained without reply. <lb/>3.3.2 <lb/>Legislation <lb/>The main rules governing the legislative process are contained in the Constitution and the Assembly&apos;s <lb/>RoP. These rules specify both the institutions involved and the processes to be followed. The rules are <lb/>clear and well understood by the legislators. The parliamentary legislative process normally encompasses <lb/>two readings. In cases where a bill does not receive the sufficient number of votes for its adoption in the <lb/>second reading, a third reading may take place upon the request of the sponsor of the bill. <lb/>As is customary in parliamentary systems, the legislative calendar is dominated by Government bills. In <lb/>2012, in addition to 15 bills carried over from 2011, the Assembly dealt with 70 Government bills, <lb/>compared to just 4 bills submitted by committees and 3 bills sponsored by Deputies. In 2012, 69 bills <lb/>became law. It is interesting that seven bills were returned to the Government for redrafting, up from <lb/>two bills in 2011. <lb/>Analysis of main challenges <lb/>The practice of parliamentary scrutiny of bills cannot be understood without reference to the state of the <lb/>legal system in Kosovo. It is generally recognised that many important elements of the legal system still <lb/>need to be put in place. Unlike in the legal systems of fully consolidated democracies, where law making <lb/>is often dominated by amendments to existing legislation, in Kosovo there is an emphasis on the <lb/>adoption of genuinely new laws. Moreover, the adoption of this legislation is often foreseen as the result <lb/>of international commitments entered into by the Government. This means that parliamentary influence <lb/>on both substantive legislative priorities and legislative timetables is severely constrained. <lb/>Parliamentary influence is further restricted by the fact that executive-legislative co-operation during the <lb/>pre-parliamentary stages of the legislative process seems largely absent. There is no tradition of <lb/>involving experts from the majority parliamentary groups informally in the drafting of bills by the <lb/>ministries. Thus, Deputies can only try to exert influence once a bill has been submitted to the Assembly. <lb/>Notwithstanding these systemic limitations to the impact of the Assembly on the content and timing of <lb/>legislation, the Assembly is certainly taking its legislative role seriously, and devotes a considerable part <lb/></body>

			<page>54 <lb/></page>

			<body>of its resources to the scrutiny of legislation. Bills are first considered by the relevant functional <lb/>committee and a &quot; vote in principle &quot; is then taken in the plenary on whether to proceed. If a decision is <lb/>taken to proceed in principle, the bill is then examined both by the relevant functional committee and <lb/>the relevant standing committees. The functional committee may take up to three months for the <lb/>consideration of a bill. Two standing committees – the Committee for Legislation and the Committee for <lb/>EI – also examine all bills, and the two other standing committees – for Budget and Finance, and for <lb/>Rights, Interests of Communities and Returns – will consider the bill if it falls into their sphere of <lb/>responsibilities. <lb/>Committees establish working groups of between three and five Deputies to examine bills and the <lb/>number of meetings of working groups is high (see Figure 9 above). These working group meetings are <lb/>usually attended by representatives of the ministry sponsoring the bill. Ministers typically attend the <lb/>committee meeting at which the recommendations of the working groups are discussed. During the <lb/>second reading of the bill, all amendments proposed are voted upon individually, including those of the <lb/>lead functional committee, other committees, parliamentary groups, the Government and the Deputies. <lb/>The fact that bills are invariably considered by more than one committee, and often by three or four, <lb/>combined with extensive opportunities for proposing amendments to Government bills, encourages <lb/>detailed legislative scrutiny. <lb/>The number of proposed amendments is considerable, with 1 254 in 2011 and 1 002 in 2012. Between <lb/>January and June 2013, a total of 781 amendments were proposed to 38 bills that were under <lb/>consideration. Of the amendments proposed, approximately 98% are approved. Final voting on <lb/>individual amendments and the bill as a whole takes place at the same plenary session. As a result, it can <lb/>be very difficult to deal with potential discrepancies or even contradictions between amendments. <lb/>The Assembly&apos;s RoP allows for consultation with those having affected interests and also permits the <lb/>engagement of external experts. Committee agendas are made public well in advance of committee <lb/>meetings. A manual to aid the use of external expertise in committees was produced in late 2011. <lb/>Committees conducted 68 public hearings in 2011. In 2012, this number dropped to 37. This decline <lb/>indicates time pressures in the legislative process, but also points to strains on the organisational <lb/>capacities of committees. Standing committees have an annual budget of EUR 10 000 each to pay <lb/>outside expert consultants. The equivalent figure in the case of functional committees is EUR 5 000 each. <lb/>At least as regards legislation intensive committees, these figures are low, so that committees have <lb/>repeatedly turned to external donors to finance expert advice. <lb/>The short period of time – only 10 days – available to the standing committees on Budget and Finance, <lb/>Legislation, Rights, Interests of Communities and Returns, and EI to consider amendments proposed by <lb/>functional committees is problematic. In cases where there is a high number of amendments proposed, <lb/>the standing committees find it difficult to carry out a proper assessment of the budgetary, legal and <lb/>integration related aspects of amendments. <lb/>3.3.3 <lb/>Budgeting <lb/>The main powers and responsibilities of the Assembly in matters relating to the state budget are laid <lb/>down at the level of the Constitution, the Law on Public Financial Management and Accountability and <lb/>the Assembly&apos;s RoP. It is useful here to distinguish between the annual procedures for the adoption of <lb/>the state budget, the consideration of the budgetary impact of bills, and the Assembly&apos;s role in oversight <lb/>and control regarding the execution of the budget. In line with the terms of reference of this review, the <lb/>focus is on the latter two issues. <lb/>Whilst ultimate parliamentary authority in matters relating to the budget and public finances rests in the <lb/>plenary, it is the Committee for Budget and Finance where most of the detailed work takes place. As a <lb/>standing committee, this committee considers all bills with budgetary implications. As a functional <lb/>committee, it reviews legislation relating to budgeting, finance and fiscal policy. The committee also <lb/></body>

			<page>55 <lb/></page>

			<body>considers the unaudited reports of the public agencies that report to it. There is a separate Committee <lb/>on Oversight of Public Finances that oversees the legality of public expenditure and works closely with <lb/>the Office of the Auditor General. <lb/>In considering legislation with budgetary implications as a standing committee, the Budget and Finance <lb/>Committee operates under the same time rules that apply to other standing committees in the <lb/>legislative process, i.e. it is asked to report on the bill within 10 days during the review stage for the <lb/>detailed consideration of bills prior to the second reading. If, during this stage, other committees suggest <lb/>amendments with budgetary implications, the Budget and Finance Committee is required to respond <lb/>within five days. If the Committee serves as a functional committee, it has 15 days for reaching a position <lb/>on the adoption or non-adoption of the bill in principle, and, after the conclusion of the first reading, two <lb/>months to present a report with recommendations to the plenary (the Committee may ask the Assembly <lb/>to grant up to one month&apos;s extension). <lb/>Analysis of main challenges <lb/>Like other committees, the Budget and Finance Committee establishes working groups for the <lb/>consideration of bills, with between three and five Deputies. Participants in the process criticise the <lb/>budgetary impact statements provided by the Government with draft bills as being at times incomplete <lb/>and superficial, so that the working groups have to perform their tasks within a very short time in the <lb/>case of standing committee matters, and on the basis of weak information. The working groups are <lb/>served by the administrative committee staff. Prior to the meetings, committee staff prepare preliminary <lb/>assessments on potentially problematic issues and, according to participants in the process, it is also <lb/>committee personnel who formulate the bulk of suggested amendments. In the past few years, the <lb/>committee administration benefitted from assistance by various international donors to upgrade its <lb/>capacities. <lb/>Regarding oversight and control, the Budget and Finance Committee plays a subsidiary role compared to <lb/>the Committee on Oversight of Public Finances. It receives the unaudited financial reports of agencies <lb/>and independent institutions. Committee staff provide preliminary analyses on this basis. It is not <lb/>unusual for reports to be returned to the institutions with the request for further information. <lb/>There are at least two issues worth highlighting when it comes to the Assembly&apos;s role in budget related <lb/>policy making. First, its capacity for the scrutiny of bills is critically dependent on the quality of the <lb/>budgetary and financial information accompanying bills that is provided by the Government. The Budget <lb/>and Finance Committee does not have at its disposal the personnel or financial resources to carry out <lb/>systematic assessments of budgetary impacts. It is, by necessity, largely confined to checking the quality <lb/>of the information furnished by the executive. <lb/>Second, as regards its oversight role, it is not clear whether the current practice of considering unaudited <lb/>reports, whilst the Committee on Oversight of Public Finances deals with audit reports, is optimal. <lb/>3.3.4 <lb/>Oversight and control <lb/>Compared to legislative work, the Assembly&apos;s activities in executive oversight and control are of a more <lb/>limited scale. The chief instruments available include: parliamentary questions, interpellations leading to <lb/>debates, examinations of the implementation of individual laws, and the consideration of reports from <lb/>executive bodies (for further details see Manual &quot; Oversight Function of Parliamentary Committees &quot; , <lb/>2012). The range of oversight and control instruments available is quite limited and no intensive use is <lb/>made of them (see Figure 11). <lb/>Analysis of main challenges <lb/>Parliamentary questions to the Prime Minister and ministers for oral answers during question time are <lb/>regulated in Article 45 of the RoP. They must be submitted in writing at least 48 hours in advance, are <lb/>then posed orally in no more than two minutes, and the answer must take no more than three minutes. <lb/></body>

			<page>56 <lb/></page>

			<body>A Deputy is not allowed more than two such questions per plenary session. It is evident from these <lb/>regulations that oral questions can do no more than raise very specific issues, rather than allow for a <lb/>systematic questioning of the Executive. There was a modest increase in the number of parliamentary <lb/>questions from 124 in 2011 to 160 in 2012. It is also possible to table questions for written answers <lb/>(Article 46, RoP), but this instrument is hardly ever used. <lb/>Motions of interpellation allow groups of at least six Deputies to request a debate on issues concerning <lb/>the work of the Government or an individual ministry. The RoP (Article 44) require the Prime Minister or <lb/>ministers to respond to the issues raised, and time is made available in the plenary to present the <lb/>proposers&apos; concern, for the executive to respond, and for other Deputies to join the debate. Although <lb/>the interpellation seems a suitable instrument for executive oversight, only four motions of <lb/>interpellations were debated in 2011 and 2012 each. <lb/>Figure 11: Scrutiny activities of the Assembly 2011-2012 <lb/>Source: Activity reports of the Assembly of Kosovo, 2011 and 2012. <lb/>In addition to the oversight and control mechanisms employed at the level of the plenary, committees <lb/>also play a role in holding the Executive to account. The terms of reference of parliamentary committees <lb/>establish that they oversee the application of legislation falling within their respective spheres of <lb/>competence. The Assembly has adopted a practice under Article 73 of the RoP whereby each committee <lb/>should, in principle, aim to carry out an examination of the implementation of at least one major law per <lb/>year. The relevant decisions are taken as part of the discussions held on the annual committee work <lb/>plans. In 2011, 11 such examinations were carried out, and 7 were conducted in 2012. The provision <lb/>applies to both standing committees and functional committees. Thus, for example, the Budget and <lb/>Finance Committee intends to carry out two reviews in 2013, one on the Public Procurement Law and <lb/>one on the Law on Fortune Games. <lb/>The Assembly receives regular reports from budgetary organisations and independent institutions that <lb/>operate within their sphere of competence. These reports are first discussed in committee and their <lb/>review in the plenary is opened by a presentation from a committee rapporteur. <lb/>0 <lb/>5 <lb/>10 <lb/>15 <lb/>20 <lb/>25 <lb/>30 <lb/>2010.8 2011 2011.2 2011.4 2011.6 2011.8 2012 2012.2 <lb/>0 <lb/>20 <lb/>40 <lb/>60 <lb/>80 <lb/>100 <lb/>120 <lb/>140 <lb/>160 <lb/>180 <lb/>2011 <lb/>2012 <lb/>Questions submitted <lb/>Reviews of annual reports and <lb/>audit reports <lb/>Law implementation reviews <lb/>Interpellations <lb/></body>

			<page>57 <lb/></page>

			<body>It is notable that the Assembly does not make use of the Investigative Committees, as provided for in <lb/>Article 71 of the RoP. Such committees can be established &quot; where the Assembly identifies an issue of <lb/>special importance &quot; and wishes &quot; to summon any official it deems necessary to testify in front of the <lb/>committee &quot; . <lb/>3.3.5 <lb/>EU integration <lb/>Parliamentary responsibility for matters relating to EI is concentrated in the standing Committee for <lb/>European Integration. It reviews and supervises the process of harmonisation of laws enacted by the <lb/>Assembly with the legislation of the EU. In practice, this means that all bills considered must be <lb/>submitted to the committee which assesses the compatibility of bills with the acquis. The committee is <lb/>also tasked with maintaining close working ties with the EU institutions, EU Member States and other <lb/>actors relevant to the furtherance of Kosovo&apos;s integration process, and for monitoring and supervising <lb/>the implementation of relevant agreements. The committee also deals with Kosovo&apos;s relationship with <lb/>the Council of Europe. In addition to the working plan of the Committee, the Assembly as a whole adopts <lb/>annual &quot; Parliamentary Action Plans for European Integration &quot; , as well as regular progress reports on the <lb/>implementation of these annual action plans. The Assembly receives six monthly reports from the <lb/>Government on integration related developments. <lb/>Analysis of main challenges <lb/>Whilst it is evident that the Assembly attaches central importance to EI in its workings, there are several <lb/>issues relating to the operation of the Committee for EI and interinstitutional relationships that merit <lb/>further scrutiny. First, under the RoP, the Committee, as a standing committee, is only given 10 days to <lb/>check for the compliance of bills with European legislation and agreements and the obligations arising <lb/>out of Council of Europe membership. Participants in the process criticise that the declarations of <lb/>compliance accompanying Government bills cannot always be relied upon and that no proper tables of <lb/>compliance are provided. In practice, the compatibility checks of bills – and also amendments introduced <lb/>during the legislative process – fall to two of the total of four committee staff. As a consequence, in an <lb/>area where attention to legislative details is essential, time pressures are especially severe. <lb/>Given the overall scarcity of resources in the Assembly, including legal expertise, it seems justified to look <lb/>again at the division of labour amongst the Committee for Legislation and the Committee for EI and their <lb/>respective personnel, as well as the Unit for Legal Harmonisation and Approximation. Both committees <lb/>and their staff engage primarily in the scrutiny of compliance, with domestic and European law <lb/>respectively, as does the Unit. There seems at least an obvious case for concentrating these legal checks <lb/>into a single body served by an enlarged administrative support structure that incorporates the above <lb/>Unit. <lb/>In addition, an artificial division appears to exist between the political responsibilities of the Committee <lb/>for European Integration, on the one hand, and the Committee on Foreign Affairs, on the other, given <lb/>the overriding importance of the European frameworks for co-operation in Kosovo&apos;s foreign relations. <lb/>This division at the level of the Assembly mirrors the organisational division between the Ministry of EI <lb/>and the MFA at the level of the Government. <lb/>As noted above, there is, as yet, no comprehensive legal framework governing the powers and <lb/>responsibilities of the Assembly in the EU integration process. In addition, the EI Committee&apos;s role is <lb/>principally geared towards review and co-ordination rather than the initiation and formulation of <lb/>political initiatives, and towards sustaining a critical dialogue with the Government and the President in <lb/>the integration process. In particular, at present, the EI Committee and the Assembly as a whole are <lb/>largely bystanders in the negotiations with the EU. Thus far, there has been no requirement for the <lb/>Assembly&apos;s approval of the mandates of SAA negotiations and no discussion of commitments taken by <lb/>the Government prior to their adoption. <lb/></body>
