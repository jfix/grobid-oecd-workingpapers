			<body>PISA <lb/>How are school systems adapting to <lb/>increasing numbers of immigrant students? <lb/>• On  average among OECD countries, the percentage of students with an immigrant<lb/>background grew by two percentage points between 2000 and 2009. <lb/>• Immigrant  students represent more than 5% of the student population in 13 OECD and<lb/>partner countries and economies that participated in PISA 2009. <lb/>• In  most countries, immigrant students lag behind native students in performance; in many<lb/>countries, the difference is considerable. However, Australia, Belgium, Canada, Germany, <lb/>New Zealand and Switzerland have been able to narrow, and in some cases close, this <lb/>performance gap. <lb/>in FOCus <lb/>11 <lb/>e d u c a t i o n p o l i c y e d u c a t i o n p o l i c y e d u c a t i o n p o l i c y e d u c a t i o n p o l i c y e d u c a t i o n p o l i c y e d u c a t i o n p o l i c y e d u c a t i o n p o l i c y <lb/>Whether in flight from conflict, with the hope of building a better life, or to <lb/>seize a social or economic opportunity, people have been crossing borders for <lb/>as long as there have been borders to cross. Modern means of transportation <lb/>and communication, the globalisation of the labour market, and the ageing of <lb/>populations in OECD countries will drive migration well into the next decades. <lb/>The key to maintaining social cohesion during these population movements <lb/>is to integrate immigrants and their families well into their adopted countries; <lb/>and education can be a powerful lever to achieve this. <lb/>Native students are those born in the country in which they <lb/>were assessed by PISA or who have at least one parent who <lb/>was born in that country. <lb/>Immigrant students are those with an immigrant background, <lb/>and they can be either first-generation (those who are <lb/>foreign-born and whose parents are also foreign-born) or <lb/>second-generation (those who were born in the country of <lb/>assessment but whose parents are foreign-born). <lb/>PISA in FOCus <lb/>PISA IN FOCUS 2011/11 (December) – © OECD 2011 <lb/></body>

			<body>Why do these numbers matter for education policy? <lb/>Because PisA results in 2000 and 2009 show that <lb/>although native students tend to outperform their <lb/>immigrant peers by an average of more than 40 score <lb/>points, some countries have been able to narrow <lb/>that gap considerably. For example, in Belgium <lb/>and switzerland, the performance gap narrowed <lb/>by nearly 40 score points during that period, even <lb/>though native students still outperform students with <lb/>an immigrant background by 68 score points in <lb/>Belgium and by 48 score points in switzerland. <lb/>And switzerland has been able to reduce the <lb/>performance gap despite the fact that the percentage <lb/>of students with an immigrant background rose <lb/>during the period. Germany, new Zealand and the <lb/>partner country Liechtenstein also show a narrowing <lb/>of the performance gap between these two groups <lb/>of students. <lb/>Countries are ranked in descending order of percentage of students with an immigrant background in 2009. <lb/>source: OECD, PISA 2009 Database. <lb/>Table V.4.4 (1 2 http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/888932382235). <lb/>Figure V.4.6 (1 2 http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/888932360005). <lb/>…but in some countries, the performance gap <lb/>is shrinking. <lb/>Based on information gathered from questionnaires <lb/>distributed with the PisA 2009 assessment, <lb/>the percentage of 15-year-old students with an <lb/>immigrant background grew by two percentage <lb/>points, on average, between 2000 and 2009 <lb/>among OECD countries with comparable data. <lb/>immigrant students now constitute more than <lb/>5% of the 15-year-old student populations in <lb/>13 OECD and partner countries and economies. <lb/>in ireland, new Zealand, spain, the united states, <lb/>and the partner countries Liechtenstein and the <lb/>Russian Federation, the percentage of students <lb/>with an immigrant background increased by five <lb/>percentage points or more over the past decade, <lb/>and these students now represent from 8% to 30% <lb/>of these countries&apos; student populations. in italy, <lb/>Greece and Canada, the percentage of students <lb/>with an immigrant background increased by three <lb/>to five percentage points over the same period. <lb/>nearly 25% of Canada&apos;s student population has <lb/>an immigrant background. <lb/>Percentage of students with an immigrant background in 2000 and 2009 <lb/>45 <lb/>40 <lb/>35 <lb/>30 <lb/>25 <lb/>20 <lb/>15 <lb/>10 <lb/>5 <lb/>0 <lb/>Percentage of students with <lb/>an immigrant background <lb/>Change in the percentage <lb/>of students with an <lb/>immigrant background <lb/>between 2000 and 2009 <lb/>Hong Kong-China <lb/>Liechtenstein <lb/>New Zealand <lb/>Canada <lb/>Switzerland <lb/>Australia <lb/>Israel <lb/>United States <lb/>Germany <lb/>Belgium <lb/>France <lb/>Russian Federation <lb/>Sweden <lb/>Spain <lb/>Greece <lb/>Denmark <lb/>Ireland <lb/>Norway <lb/>Italy <lb/>Portugal <lb/>Latvia <lb/>Argentina <lb/>Finland <lb/>Iceland <lb/>Czech Republic <lb/>Hungary <lb/>Mexico <lb/>Brazil <lb/>Albania <lb/>Bulgaria <lb/>Chile <lb/>Peru <lb/>Romania <lb/>Japan <lb/>Indonesia <lb/>Poland <lb/>– <lb/>+ <lb/>+ <lb/>+ <lb/>+ <lb/>o <lb/>– <lb/>+ <lb/>o <lb/>o <lb/>o <lb/>+ <lb/>o <lb/>+ <lb/>+ <lb/>+ <lb/>+ <lb/>+ <lb/>+ <lb/>+ <lb/>– <lb/>o <lb/>+ <lb/>+ <lb/>+ <lb/>o <lb/>– <lb/>+ <lb/>o <lb/>o <lb/>o <lb/>o <lb/>o <lb/>o <lb/>o <lb/>– <lb/>2009 higher than 2000 2009 lower than 2000 No statistically significant difference <lb/>+ <lb/>– <lb/>o <lb/>95% confidence level <lb/>2000 <lb/>2009 <lb/>The proportion of immigrant students <lb/>continues to grow… <lb/>PISA in FOCus <lb/>PISA IN FOCUS 2011/11 (December) – © OECD 2011 <lb/>note: score point differences that are statistically significant are shown in a darker tone. <lb/>Countries are ranked in ascending order of score point differences after accounting for <lb/>the economic, social and cultural status of students. <lb/>source: OECD, PISA 2009 Database. <lb/>Table ii.4.1 (1 2 http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/888932381418). <lb/>Figure ii.4.5 (1 2 http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/888932343608). <lb/>some school systems are successful at minimising <lb/>performance differences across students, regardless <lb/>of their immigrant backgrounds. For example, in <lb/>Australia, students with an immigrant background <lb/>perform better than native students. in Canada, <lb/>immigrant students performed as well as native <lb/>students in 2009, and they represent a large – and <lb/>growing – proportion of the student population. <lb/>Socio-economic background explains <lb/>only part of the performance gap. <lb/>What these trends tell us is that there are ways <lb/>that governments and schools can help students <lb/>from immigrant backgrounds to overcome <lb/>some of the disadvantages associated with <lb/>that background. Often, students with an <lb/>immigrant background are socio-economically <lb/>disadvantaged. On average across OECD <lb/>countries, the parents of these students are less <lb/>educated and work in lower-status occupations <lb/>than their native peers. in addition, these students <lb/>tend to have access to fewer educational and <lb/>material resources at home than their native peers. <lb/>so, for example, if the socio-economic status of <lb/>students in Luxembourg is taken into account, <lb/>the performance gap between immigrant and <lb/>native students there narrows from 52 to 19 score <lb/>points. On average across OECD countries, the <lb/>gap is reduced from 43 to 27 score points when <lb/>comparing students of similar socio-economic <lb/>status, regardless of whether they are from <lb/>immigrant backgrounds or are native to the <lb/>country in which they were tested. <lb/>But the fact that a performance gap equivalent <lb/>to well over half a school year persists, even <lb/>after accounting for socio-economic status, <lb/>implies that other factors also have an impact on <lb/>student performance. To some extent, these may <lb/>be related to where the students were born – <lb/>for example, whether they are second-<lb/>or first-generation immigrants – or whether, <lb/>when they&apos;re at home, they speak the same <lb/>language as that used in the PisA test. <lb/>% of students <lb/>in PISA 2009 <lb/>with an immigrant <lb/>background <lb/>(1st or 2nd generation) <lb/>0 <lb/>-40 <lb/>-80 <lb/>-120 <lb/>40 <lb/>80 <lb/>120 <lb/></body>

			<body>The bottom line: School systems can nurture immigrant students&apos; full social <lb/>and economic integration into their adopted country by identifying the <lb/>obstacles to high performance that are particular to immigrant students and <lb/>developing programmes that are tailored to meet these students&apos; needs. <lb/>Immigrant students and reading performance in 2000 and 2009 <lb/>120 <lb/>100 <lb/>80 <lb/>60 <lb/>40 <lb/>20 <lb/>0 <lb/>-20 <lb/>-40 <lb/>Score point difference <lb/>Change in the performance <lb/>difference between students <lb/>without and those with <lb/>an immigrant background <lb/>between 2000 and 2009 <lb/>Hungary <lb/>Australia <lb/>Israel <lb/>Hong Kong-China <lb/>Canada <lb/>Latvia <lb/>New Zealand <lb/>United States <lb/>Czech Republic <lb/>Russian Federation <lb/>Portugal <lb/>Ireland <lb/>Liechtenstein <lb/>Argentina <lb/>Switzerland <lb/>Norway <lb/>Germany <lb/>Greece <lb/>Spain <lb/>France <lb/>Denmark <lb/>Sweden <lb/>Belgium <lb/>Finland <lb/>Italy <lb/>Mexico <lb/>o <lb/>– <lb/>o <lb/>o <lb/>o <lb/>o <lb/>– <lb/>o <lb/>o <lb/>o <lb/>o <lb/>+ <lb/>– <lb/>o <lb/>– <lb/>o <lb/>– <lb/>o <lb/>o <lb/>o <lb/>o <lb/>o <lb/>– <lb/>o <lb/>+ <lb/>o <lb/>2009 higher than 2000 2009 lower than 2000 No statistically significant difference <lb/>+ <lb/>– <lb/>o <lb/>95% confidence level <lb/>2009 <lb/>2000 <lb/>Students WITHOUT <lb/>an immigrant background <lb/>perform better <lb/>Students WITH <lb/>an immigrant background <lb/>perform better <lb/>For more information <lb/>Contact Maciej Jakubowski (Maciej.Jakubowski@oecd.org) <lb/>See PISA 2009 Results: Overcoming Social Background: Equity in Learning Opportunities and Outcomes (Volume ii) and <lb/>PISA 2009 Results: Learning Trends: Changes in Student Performance Since 2000 (Volume V) <lb/>Coming next month <lb/>Are boys and girls ready for the digital age? <lb/>Visit <lb/>www.pisa.oecd.org <lb/>www.oecd.org/pisa/infocus <lb/>note: statistically significant score point differences are marked in a darker tone. <lb/>Countries are ranked in ascending order of the performance difference between students without and those with an immigrant background in 2009. <lb/>source: OECD, PISA 2009 Database. <lb/>Table V.4.4 (1 2 http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/888932382235). <lb/>Figure V.4.7 (1 2 http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/888932360005). <lb/>Yet given that the performance gap varies so widely across countries, even taking into account these other <lb/>characteristics, and given that in some countries the performance gap has changed markedly over time, <lb/>it is clear that public policy can make a difference.
