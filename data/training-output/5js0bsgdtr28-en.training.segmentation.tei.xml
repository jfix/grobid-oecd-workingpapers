			<body>1 <lb/>Education Indicators in Focus – June 2015 © OECD 2015 <lb/>education data education evidence education policy education analysis education statistics <lb/>IN <lb/>2015 (June) <lb/>EDUCATION <lb/>INDICATORS <lb/>FOCUS <lb/>32 <lb/>Educational opportunities have a very important impact on a person&apos;s life. Employment, earnings, well-being, health and <lb/>trust are all strongly related to education and skills. A lack of high-quality educational opportunities is the most important <lb/>way in which poverty, social inequality and exclusion are transmitted from one generation to another. For countries to <lb/>grow and progress in a sustainable way, educational opportunities should be distributed in an inclusive way. <lb/>The inclusiveness of educational systems can be assessed in two ways: first, by looking at the share of people with <lb/>low educational attainment or low skills and second, by looking at the size of the differences in attainment levels and <lb/>skills distributions. This briefing examines both measures, and tracks their evolution over time. <lb/>The share of those with low education is decreasing rapidly, but not at the same rate in all countries. <lb/>Are education and skills being distributed more inclusively? <lb/>Between 2000 and 2013 the share of 25-64 year-olds with tertiary education grew by 3.1% a <lb/>year on average across OECD countries, while the share of those without an upper secondary <lb/>education fell by 2.9%. <lb/>In 2013, more than 40% of adults still lacked an upper secondary education in five OECD countries. <lb/>Some countries increased their tertiary attainment rates faster than they reduced lower <lb/>educational attainment rates, while others (Poland, Luxembourg, Czech and Slovak Republics, <lb/>and Korea) realised similar tertiary attainment increases but also reduced their below upper <lb/>secondary attainment rates by the same amount. <lb/>In all countries the share of low-skilled adults is lower among younger age groups than among <lb/>older ones, but in some countries more than 20% of adults still have low literacy skills. <lb/>In all countries the distribution of literacy skills is skewed towards the bottom, with a greater <lb/>spread between the median and the bottom 10% than between the median and the top 10%. <lb/>Most analyses of educational attainment rates look at the increases in the share of people with tertiary education, and <lb/>over the past decades OECD countries have witnessed a remarkable growth of such highly educated people. Among <lb/>OECD countries with data for all years between 2000 and 2013, the number of people with tertiary education grew <lb/>by 3.1% on average per year. <lb/>But what has happened at the bottom of the educational ladder? Did educational expansion also decrease the share <lb/>of people with low levels of education in the population? Figure 1 shows that over the same period, the share of <lb/>25-64 year-olds without an upper secondary education decreased by 2.9% per year on average across OECD countries <lb/>with data for all years, slightly slower than the growth rate for tertiary attainment, but many countries reduced <lb/>low educational attainment rates much faster. The highest reduction rates can be found among countries that had <lb/>reduced the share of people without an upper secondary education to below the OECD average of 24% in 2013. <lb/>Unfortunately, in five countries, more than 40% of the population still have low educational attainment, and those <lb/>countries have not even reached the average reduction rate of 2.9% per year. <lb/>education data education evidence education policy education analysis education statistics <lb/></body>

			<body>EducAtion indicAtors IN focus <lb/>In some countries, educational attainment growth at the top has come at the expense of the bottom. <lb/>Figure 2 shows the average annual change in below upper secondary and tertiary attainment rates, and the difference <lb/>between them, for the period 2000-2013. Countries exhibit very different patterns of educational expansion. To the left we <lb/>find countries such as Sweden, Finland, Israel and Canada, which have seen rates of low educational attainment falling faster <lb/>than tertiary attainment rates have risen; to the right countries such as Portugal, Turkey, Denmark, Italy and Switzerland, <lb/>Turkey <lb/>Mexico <lb/>Portugal <lb/>Spain <lb/>Italy <lb/>United States <lb/>Germany <lb/>Norway <lb/>Hungary <lb/>Israel <lb/>Estonia <lb/>Poland <lb/>Luxembourg <lb/>Slovak <lb/>Republic <lb/>Denmark <lb/>Greece <lb/>Korea <lb/>Finland <lb/>Canada <lb/>Iceland <lb/>France <lb/>Belgium <lb/>OECD <lb/>Australia <lb/>Ireland <lb/>EU21 <lb/>United Kingdom <lb/>New Zealand <lb/>Netherlands <lb/>Slovenia <lb/>Sweden <lb/>Switzerland <lb/>Austria <lb/>Czech <lb/>Republic <lb/>0 <lb/>10 <lb/>20 <lb/>30 <lb/>40 <lb/>50 <lb/>60 <lb/>70 <lb/>Percentage of 25-64 year-olds with below upper secondary education <lb/>Figure 1.

Although there <lb/>is no measure over time, looking at the difference in the share of 25-34 year-olds and 55-64 year-olds with low skills <lb/>provides an estimate of the amount of progress made. However, in countries that have effective adult-learning systems <lb/>through which older adults can improve their skills, such as Norway and Sweden, actual progress over time may be <lb/>underestimated. Thus, this proxy should be interpreted with caution. All entities have seen the share of adults below <lb/>Level 2 on the literacy scale fall by this measure, but in the Slovak Republic, England and the United States only very <lb/>modest progress has been made. In contrast to the trend in educational attainment (see Figure 1), those entities <lb/>with high percentages of adults with low literacy skills have also demonstrated the highest relative decreases. <lb/>The share of adults with low literacy skills is also decreasing, but in some countries it remains at a high level. <lb/>Moving from educational attainment to skills, can we say anything about the inclusiveness of a country&apos;s skills distribution and <lb/>its evolution over time? The 2012 Survey of Adult Skills, a product of the OECD Programme for the International Assessment <lb/>of Adult Competencies (PIAAC), found that, on average across participating national and sub-national entities, 16.4% of <lb/>25-64 year-olds still have literacy skills below Level 2 although this average conceals wide variations between entities, as <lb/>Figure 3 (vertical axis) demonstrates. In Italy, Spain and France over 20% of adults do not reach Level 2 for literacy skills. <lb/>where tertiary attainment has grown faster than low attainment has fallen. Some countries have low annual rates of <lb/>change; others have gone through a much more rapid expansion in educational attainment. Compare for example <lb/>the cases of Turkey and Korea: both share a similar annual growth rate in tertiary attainment, but in Korea this has <lb/>been accompanied by a similar or even slightly higher fall in low education attainment rates, while in Turkey the <lb/>share of 25-64 year-olds without an upper secondary education diminished only slightly. <lb/>35 <lb/>30 <lb/>25 <lb/>20 <lb/>15 <lb/>10 <lb/>5 <lb/>0 <lb/>Percentage of 25-64 year-old adults with Level 1 or below on literacy scale <lb/>Figure 3.

It shows that, in all national and sub-national entities participating in the survey, the distance between <lb/>the median and the 10th percentile is greater than between the median and the 90th percentile. In all entities the <lb/>distribution is skewed towards the bottom. <lb/>In the Slovak and Czech Republics, Japan, and Korea the overall size of the skills distribution is relatively small, suggesting <lb/>a fairly inclusive distribution of literacy skills across the adult population.

Some entities, such as the Netherlands, <lb/>Denmark, Norway and Sweden, have a comparatively compact distribution overall but the skewness at <lb/>the bottom is high, indicating a wider dispersion at the bottom than at the top. <lb/>The bottom line: Not everyone has benefited from the increase in educational attainment and skills <lb/>in the population in recent years. The shares of adults with low educational attainment and low skills <lb/>remain significantly high, although the data suggest a fair amount of progress towards a more inclusive <lb/>distribution of education and skills. Differences between countries are very significant, however, and <lb/>some risk leaving parts of their population behind with enduring low levels of education and skills. <lb/>Photo credit: © Ghislain &amp; Marie David de Lossy / Cultura / Getty Images <lb/>This paper is published under the responsibility of the Secretary-General of the OECD.
