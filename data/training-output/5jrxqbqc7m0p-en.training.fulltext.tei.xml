			<table>TABLE OF CONTENTS<lb/> IMPROVING INFRASTRUCTURE IN THE UNITED KINGDOM<lb/> By Mauro Pisu, Barbara Pels and Novella Bottini 1<lb/> Protracted underinvestment has taken its toll on UK infrastructure<lb/></table>

			<head>Infrastructure is key for productivity and social welfare<lb/></head>

			<p>Infrastructure contributes to productivity, economic activity and people&apos;s well-being in different<lb/> ways. Infrastructure can raise the productivity of private and public sector inputs and the marginal rate of<lb/> return of private investment, increase the durability of private capital, the volume of international trade and<lb/> generate positive externalities (such as agglomeration effects) (<ref type="biblio">OECD, 2009; Agénor and<lb/> Moreno-Dodson, 2006; Yeaple and Golub, 2007; Sanchis-Guarner, 2013</ref>). Infrastructure is essential in<lb/> attracting foreign direct investment. For instance, a recent survey has found that transport infrastructure is<lb/> the second most important criterion for multinational firms when choosing where to invest, behind<lb/> workforce availability and skills (EY, 2014). Moreover, infrastructure is important for regional<lb/> development. The economic structure of the UK exhibits a wide dispersion in regional productivity and<lb/> activation levels, in particular between the South East, including London, and the rest of the country<lb/> (<ref type="biblio">Ahrend et al., 2014</ref>) (<ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>). Adequate infrastructure provision would be instrumental in lowering<lb/> regional disparities.<lb/></p>

			<p>Better integrating physical transport infrastructure plans with land-use and social policies can raise<lb/> well-being and social welfare, by reducing commuting times and contributing to green and inclusive<lb/> growth (OECD, 2014a,b). For instance, geographical and social segregation – and the ensuing crime –<lb/> often result from insufficient transport infrastructure. People with longer commuting time report<lb/> systematically lower subjective well-being (<ref type="biblio">Stutzer and Frey, 2008; ONS, 2014</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<head>The UK has been spending less in infrastructure compared to peers<lb/></head>

			<p>According to different measures, public spending in the UK infrastructure has been lower than in<lb/> other OECD countries. Since the 1980s, public investment has been lower than in the United States,<lb/> France, Canada and Switzerland (<ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>, Panel A). Rising private spending on infrastructure, following<lb/> the privatisation and liberalisation reforms started in the 1980s, has partly offset the decline in public<lb/> spending. However, cross-country comparable data on both public and private spending are not generally<lb/> available. Transport infrastructure spending data are an exception and they suggest that spending as a share<lb/> of gross domestic product (GDP) has declined from the mid-1990s and is now lower than in Canada,<lb/> France and Switzerland, although higher than in the United States (<ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>, Panel B). More generally, the<lb/> government has identified major infrastructure investment needs in the UK to 2020 and beyond amounting<lb/> to GBP 460 billion (around 25% of 2014 GDP). Of the GBP 330 billion for which the National<lb/> Infrastructure Plan provides details, two-thirds will be financed by the private sector and the remaining<lb/> share by the government and a mix of private and public sources (HMT, 2014a; HMT, 2014b).<lb/></p>

			<p>There are no comprehensive internationally comparable data on the quality of infrastructure based on<lb/> objective criteria (<ref type="biblio">Pisu et al., 2012</ref>). Survey data, asking users about the quality of infrastructure, ranks the<lb/> UK 27 th worldwide on overall perceived quality of infrastructure, in the middle of the ranking among<lb/> OECD counties (WEF, 2014a) (<ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>). According to another international survey of the quality of the<lb/> public transport (<ref type="biblio">PWC, 2014</ref>), London performs well among 30 world cities, after Singapore, Toronto,<lb/></p>

			<p>There is evidence that the privatisation and regulation of energy, telecommunications and water<lb/> sectors have led to increased efficiency and reduced real prices for customers (<ref type="biblio">Parker, 2004; Erbetta and<lb/> Cave, 2007</ref>). The UK&apos;s system of network regulation is sound as it combines low barriers to entry,<lb/> independent regulators and incentive-based price regulation. Network sectors – such as energy<lb/> transmission and distribution, water and railways – are structured around a model that incentivises private<lb/> operators to achieve productivity gains, with strict regulation enforced by an independent regulator. This<lb/> prevents the misuse of monopolistic power and reduces the time-inconsistency problem by making it more<lb/> difficult for governments to unilaterally revise previous agreements with a private company (Box 1). Roads<lb/> and flood defences feature minimal or no private sector participation and there is no sector regulator. Ports<lb/> have large private sector participation and do not have a sector regulator.<lb/></p>

			<head>Box 1. The framework of network regulation in the United Kingdom<lb/></head>

			<p>Economic regulation in network sectors in the United Kingdom aims to promote effective competition and, when<lb/> competition is not feasible, to protect end users interests by regulation. The key features of the framework are:<lb/></p>

			<p> Private ownership of network infrastructure operators to drive cost efficiency and service delivery<lb/> improvements.<lb/></p>

			<p> Sector-specific regulation with each regulated sector overseen by a separate regulator.<lb/></p>

			<p> Independent regulators, within a framework of duties and policies set by parliament and government.<lb/></p>

			<p> Price regulation in infrastructure sectors that are natural monopolies, such as the water system and electricity<lb/> distribution. Price regulation focuses on pricing policies, not on profits earned, to incentivise innovation and<lb/> efficiency. It usually involves price caps to what the regulated firm can charge the consumer.<lb/></p>

			<p>In practice, price regulation in the water, energy distribution, railways network and air transport sectors is<lb/> implemented using incentive-based regulation, based on a price cap and a regulatory asset base (RAB) model. The<lb/> RAB model aims to provide a credible commitment to investing companies about the recovery of their capital<lb/> investment. The RAB reflects the value of the assets necessary to carry out the required function. The private<lb/> company and the regulator negotiate a contract for a 5-8 years control period in most sectors. The contract stipulates<lb/> investment plans, required revenues and price caps. In most sectors, the UK uses the &quot; RPI-X price cap &quot; : annual prices<lb/> are allowed to grow with the Retail Price index (RPI), adjusted for &quot; X &quot; , which reflects expected efficiency gains agreed<lb/> by the regulator and regulated companies.<lb/></p>

			<p>The UK&apos;s network sectors have overall the least restrictive product market regulation and regulatory<lb/> management framework among OECD countries (<ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>). The degree of competition is the highest in the<lb/> energy sector, telecommunication (excluding postal services) and railways, although there is some scope<lb/> for improvement compared to best performers in the electricity and road sectors. The success of regulated<lb/> infrastructure sectors is due not only to the technical specification of the incentive-based regulation, but<lb/> also to the transparency and quality of regulatory decisions (<ref type="biblio">Stern, 2013</ref>).<lb/> The OECD Services Trade Restrictiveness Index (STRI) also reveals low services trade restrictions<lb/> (<ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref>). This measure includes domestic regulations – such as technical standards, regulatory<lb/> transparency and administrative requirements – as well as trade and investment barriers. The UK has<lb/> relatively low restrictions in the rail freight transport sector, maritime transport and in the telecom sector.<lb/> The STRIs for road freight transport and air transport are higher, although still below the OECD average.<lb/></p>

			<p>3.<lb/> The OECD indicators of regulatory management in network sectors measure regulatory management practices in six network<lb/> sectors, electricity, gas, telecom, railroad transport infrastructure, airports and ports. They are meant to complement the network<lb/> component of the product market regulation (PMR) indicator set, which measures the regulations that are imposed on network<lb/> sectors, by measures of the governance of the bodies that design, implement and enforce these regulations. The indicators<lb/> measure the de jure policy setting. Instances where laws or regulations are poorly implemented by authorities or where<lb/> authorities implement a policy (e.g. publish a report) without being obliged by law are thus do not captured.<lb/></p>

			<p>A strong policy framework is required to effectively build, maintain and manage the infrastructure<lb/> stock of a country. Strong institutional setting, leading to credible policy commitments, improves<lb/> infrastructure outcomes (<ref type="biblio">Esfahani and Ramirez, 2003; Andres et al., 2007; Henisz, 2002; Égert, 2009</ref>).<lb/> Despite the UK&apos;s sound network regulation framework, which provides strong incentives for efficiency<lb/> gains, policy uncertainty is one of the major risk factors that currently hamper private infrastructure<lb/> investment (NAO, 2013). This is partly attributable to insufficient long-term planning, which has made it<lb/> difficult to build a broad political consensus on contentious projects and resulted in delays in infrastructure<lb/> provision. The launch of the National Infrastructure Plan in 2010 and its regular updates since then<lb/> represent the first steps in the right direction towards providing a comprehensive view of the country&apos;s<lb/> infrastructure needs and how the government plans to meet them.<lb/></p>

			<head>The UK needs to further develop a comprehensive long-term infrastructure strategy<lb/></head>

			<p>Rising private sector participation since the 1980s in the absence of a coherent long-term<lb/> infrastructure strategy, while improving efficiency and making service quality more responsive to client<lb/> needs, may have led to sector fragmentation, impaired an across-sector view of infrastructure and, in some<lb/> cases, could have weakened accountability for investment to build sufficient long-term capacity<lb/> (<ref type="biblio">Armitt, 2013</ref>). The government&apos;s 2010 cost review (HMT, 2014c) highlighted that more certainty about<lb/> investment plans would allow private investors to develop the right skills, products and solutions to lower<lb/> the costs of infrastructure projects, which are higher than in other European countries.<lb/> Several examples illustrate existing long-term planning difficulties. A 2003 White Paper set out a<lb/> 30-year strategy that identified the need for additional runways in the South East. However, no progresses<lb/> followed the White Paper and, more recently, an Airports Commission has been created and is expected to<lb/> publish its final recommendation in 2015, a delay of 12 years since the issue was raised. Insufficient<lb/> investment in electricity generation by private-sector companies, which are not under the purview of the<lb/> energy regulator, has resulted in severe capacity constraints now manifest (see below). Moreover, recent<lb/> surveys have found that a number of firms considered but decided not to enter the retail energy market<lb/> because of the political uncertainties on the future course of energy policies (<ref type="biblio">Ofgem, 2014a, CBI, 2011a</ref>).<lb/> Also, a 2011 survey among British businesses found that the major impediments to infrastructure<lb/> investment in the UK were the absence of a clear overall government strategy, delays and costs in the<lb/> planning system, and regulatory burdens (CBI, 2011b).<lb/> The National Infrastructure Plan (NIP), launched in 2010, is the first welcome attempt by a UK<lb/> government to provide a broad vision of the infrastructure investment required to underpin UK&apos;s long-term<lb/> growth. The NIP has been regularly updated and lists major planned and potential infrastructure<lb/> investments in the UK to 2020 and beyond for about GBP 460 billion (around 25% of 2014 GDP)<lb/> (HMT, 2014a). The energy sector takes up the largest share of the planned investment, followed by<lb/> transport (<ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref>). Of about 550 planned projects and programmes from the fiscal year 2014-15 until<lb/> 2020-21 and beyond, 66% of financing is from the private sector, 21% is from the public sector and 14%<lb/> is from mixed (public-private) source.<lb/></p>

			<p>The NIP provides a comprehensive and useful list of ongoing and planned infrastructure projects but<lb/> the strategic component of the NIP could be further developed. There is growing consensus that the UK&apos;s<lb/> infrastructure strategy needs to be enhanced (WEF, 2014b; LSE Growth commission, 2013). Expanding<lb/> the long-term infrastructure strategy component of the National Infrastructure Plan would contribute to<lb/> raise the level of debate on infrastructure needs and policies, thus contributing to lower policy uncertainty.<lb/> Lower policy uncertainty would, in turn, be conducive to higher private infrastructure investment. Strategic<lb/> infrastructure planning requires a long-time horizon – 20-30 years or more – and incorporating projections<lb/> for all drivers of economic and social change (OECD, 2012a). The Netherlands provides an example of<lb/> coherent long-term infrastructure strategy based on a long-time horizon and considering wide policy<lb/> objectives (Box 2).<lb/></p>

			<head>Box 2. Long-term infrastructure planning in the Netherlands<lb/></head>

			<p>The Netherlands has a long tradition of long-term strategic infrastructure planning. The framework changed in<lb/> 2006, giving more powers to local authorities. Still, with regard to national projects and aims, the national government<lb/> develops an overarching long-term plan. Previously, a &quot; Key Planning Decision &quot; (Planologische Kern Beslissing) with a<lb/> time horizon of 20 years, defining potential projects in line with wider policy objectives, was developed and adopted by<lb/> parliament. In the new framework, the government adopts a general &quot; Structural Vision &quot; , which focuses on nationally<lb/> significant planning decisions and is discussed in parliament. In a second stage, the central government, together with<lb/> local authorities, agrees on regional agendas ( &quot; gebiedsagenda &quot; ), which describe the vision and potential projects for<lb/> the region in the medium term. In addition, a multi-year programme ( &quot; MIRT &quot; ) is developed, which includes a set of<lb/> specific fully-funded projects to implement the regional agendas. A set of decision-making procedures on stakeholder<lb/> involvement and decision making is laid out for the MIRT. The advantage of the Dutch system is that, in line with the<lb/> political tradition of the country, a political consensus is sought on the long-term infrastructure strategy and specific<lb/> projects.<lb/></p>

			<head>Road sector: Dealing with congestion and moving towards an independent regulator<lb/></head>

			<p>The perceived quality of the UK&apos;s road system is worse than in most OECD countries of similar size<lb/> and wealth (<ref type="figure">Figure 7</ref>, Panel A). During the past two decades, investment in UK roads has been<lb/> considerably below the level in Germany and France (<ref type="figure">Figure 7</ref>, Panels B and C). Commuting times are<lb/> relatively long, although they have improved at peak hours, and reported congestion is high (<ref type="figure">Figure 8</ref>,<lb/> Panels A, B and C). However, road accidents are among the lowest in the OECD (<ref type="figure">Figure 8</ref>, Panel D).<lb/></p>

			<p>The Highways Agency is responsible for the maintenance, improvement and operation of the strategic<lb/> road network, while local authorities are in charge of local roads. The recent decisions to transform the<lb/> Highways Agency into a publicly-owned corporation, make it more independent from the government, and<lb/> move from a one-to a five-year funding cycles are steps in the right direction. Annual budget cycles for<lb/> infrastructure result in unsatisfactory outcomes (OECD, 2012a). The recent changes will contribute to<lb/> reduce uncertainty around investment plans and lower the cost of investment by lengthening the<lb/> investment cycle.<lb/> A wider utilisation of toll roads and congestion charges would contribute to a more rational use of<lb/> road infrastructure, with the Highways Agency acting as a regulator. Currently, user charges are<lb/> underutilised in the UK road sector compared to many other European countries. There is only one toll<lb/> road (the M6 Toll) – plus a small number of bridges and tunnels where tolls are collected – and only<lb/> London and Durham (the latter for just one street) have congestion charges. The deployment of a user-paid<lb/> toll system for the busiest parts the road network, ideally with charges varying over time, would be in line<lb/> with the &quot; user pays &quot; principle for transport (EC, 2008). Importantly, it would contribute to a more rational<lb/> use of roads by pricing congestion and therefore smoothing peaks in road traffic. Equity issues arising from<lb/> an increased use of toll roads can be effectively dealt with targeted social policies.<lb/></p>

			<head>Railways: Sustaining modernisation efforts and revising the franchising framework<lb/></head>

			<p>The railway sector has been significantly modernised in the last 20 years and the perceived quality of<lb/> railroad infrastructure has continued to edge up (<ref type="figure">Figure 9</ref>, Panel A). This can be partly ascribed to<lb/> increased investment, which started in the late 1990s-early 2000s (<ref type="figure">Figure 9</ref>, Panel B). Since the late 1990s,<lb/> passenger journeys have more than doubled (<ref type="figure">Figure 9</ref>, Panel C). At the same time, overcrowding in some<lb/> of the busiest railway sections (London and South East) has remained frequent, in contrast to the<lb/> downward trend in the pre-privatisation period ending in 1994 (<ref type="figure">Figure 9</ref>, Panel D). Passenger traffic is<lb/> forecast to rise further by nearly 15% between 2013-14 and 2018-19 (DfT, 2012a). OECD estimates point<lb/> at still significant railway investment needs in the UK up to 2030, with a cumulative amount equivalent to<lb/> about 3.5% of today&apos;s GDP, but which are lower than for Italy, Japan and Germany and below the OECD<lb/> average (<ref type="figure">Figure 10</ref>, Panel A) (OECD, 2012a). Such investments will be needed to sustain strong<lb/> performance metrics of safety, customer satisfaction and punctuality (<ref type="figure">Figure 10</ref>, Panels B, C and D).<lb/> Network Rail plans to spend GBP 38 billion (2% of 2014 GDP) between 2014 and 2019.<lb/> The government privatised railways in 1994-95, but its support to the railway industry remains<lb/> significant as passenger traffic has been rising over time. In 2012-13, it amounted to about GBP 5 billion<lb/> against total railway industry expenditure (excluding government support) of more than GBP 12 billion<lb/> and total industry income about GBP 9 billion (ORR, 2014). Government support increased further in<lb/> 2013-14 to above GBP 5 billion, the third highest level ever recorded. The government&apos;s railway strategy<lb/> up to 2019 includes close to GBP 5 billion for infrastructure enhancements, including major projects such<lb/> as Thameslink and Crossrail in London, the Intercity Express Programme on the Great Western and East<lb/> Coast Main Lines and elements of the Northern Hub, the latter aimed at improving connectivity within the<lb/> North of England (HMT, 2013). Government financial support for such projects has increased every year<lb/> since 2009-10.<lb/></p>

			<p>The government should make sure that resources to fund a possible extension of the high-speed<lb/> network are not diverted from the maintenance and improvement of the regular network. The UK has a<lb/> small high-speed rail system compared to other European countries such as France, Germany, Spain and<lb/> Italy. Currently, there is only one line (HS1) connecting London with the channel tunnel and France. The<lb/> government has plans for a second high speed rail line (HS2) connecting London with Birmingham and, in<lb/> a second phase, with Manchester and Leeds. The project is costly (estimated at GBP 50 billion or nearly<lb/> 3% of GDP), but the Department for Transport has carried out a cost-benefit analysis which shows that<lb/> HS2 should offer value for money (<ref type="biblio">DfT, 2013</ref>). However, such evaluations are complex and HS2 could<lb/> also cause a spatial re-organisation of economic activity in the UK resulting in additional economic<lb/> benefits and costs, which cost-benefit analyses cannot capture as they focus on marginal changes<lb/> (<ref type="biblio">Rosewell and Venables, 2013; Crozet, 2013</ref>). For instance, HS2 could potentially result in GBP 8-15<lb/> billion in productivity gains for the British economy in 2037 (in 2013 prices), with up to half of this total<lb/> gain generated outside Greater London by the use of freed-up railways capacity to improve rail services on<lb/> the established network, particularly on long-distance routes (KPMG, 2013).<lb/></p>

			<p>Costs could be lowered by promoting more co-operation between train operating companies and<lb/> Network Rail and better aligning their incentives (<ref type="biblio">Brown, 2013; McNulty, 2011</ref>). The government could<lb/> increase standardisation of the rolling stock and seek a more effective procurement of it (<ref type="biblio">McNulty, 2011;<lb/> Brown, 2013</ref>). Recent reforms freeing the companies owning the rolling stock from the obligation of<lb/> offering leases at the same price and terms to each bidder for a railway franchise and for the full length of<lb/> the franchise goes in the right direction as this should allow bidders to negotiate better leasing deals<lb/> (<ref type="biblio">Brown, 2013</ref>). Reducing costs will free additional resources for investment and maintenance of the<lb/> railway system without the need of recurring to significant increases in rail fares, which have increased by<lb/> more than 50% since 2004 (ORR, 2014) and are already high by international standards (TUC, 2014).<lb/> Giving the responsibility of franchising to an agency at arms-length from the government could be<lb/> beneficial. Awarding franchises for passenger rail traffic is currently the responsibility of the Department<lb/> for Transport. But criticism of the franchise framework is widespread, as it has proved difficult to deliver<lb/> in terms of performance and costs to users and taxpayers. For instance, in 2012, the public tender for the<lb/> InterCity West Coast franchise was cancelled due to technical flaws (<ref type="biblio">Brown, 2013</ref>). A 2013 report by the<lb/> Transport Committee of the House of Commons was positive about the idea to move decisions on<lb/> franchise contracts to a body at arm&apos;s length from the government (<ref type="biblio">Transport Committee, 2013</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<head>Air transport: Tackling supply bottlenecks<lb/></head>

			<p>The UK has a dynamic and competitive air transport sector, but airport capacity in the South of<lb/> England is constrained. The UK has the biggest aviation market in Europe and the UK&apos;s main airports<lb/> operate their infrastructure more cost-efficiently than other countries – Heathrow is the busiest two-runway<lb/> airport in the world and Gatwick is the busiest single runway airport (<ref type="biblio">Airports Commission, 2013</ref>).<lb/> The regulatory framework of the air transport sector is of good quality and has ensured strong<lb/> competitive pressures among airports. The aviation regulator – the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) – is<lb/> recognised for its competence. One of its important remits includes the economic regulation of airports and<lb/> of air-navigation service providers by avoiding abuse of market power. The CAA assesses the market<lb/> power of all airports and if an airport passes the market-power threshold set by the Civil Aviation Act, the<lb/> CAA starts regulating it. Currently, Heathrow and Gatwick are regulated airports.<lb/> However, the combination of insufficient investment with rising levels of traffic has brought about<lb/> heavy congestion. Heathrow and Gatwick (along with Manchester) are among the most congested airports<lb/> in Europe (<ref type="figure">Figure 11</ref>). During the last decades, only two new runways, in Manchester Airport and London<lb/> City Airport, have been added (<ref type="biblio">Airports Commission, 2013</ref>). The quality of air transport infrastructure is<lb/> perceived to be weaker than in some other countries, such as Germany, France and the United States<lb/> (<ref type="figure">Figure 12</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<figure>The next government should take a swift and final decision to tackle airport congestion, carefully<lb/> considering the recommendation of the Airports Commission, and ensure to maintain strong competitive<lb/> pressures among airports. After years of debates and reports on if and how to expand airport capacity in the<lb/> South East, no final decision has yet been taken. The creation in 2012 of an independent Airports<lb/> Commission has promised to break the logjam. An interim report was published in 2013, shortlisting<lb/> two options: adding a runway at Heathrow Airport or one at Gatwick Airport. The Commission is expected<lb/> to make its final recommendation in the summer of 2015, after the general election.<lb/> ECO/WKP(2015)62<lb/> Figure 11.

			<head>Sea ports: Maintaining high competitive pressures and supporting offshore renewable energy sources<lb/></head>

			<p>Port activities have continued to expand, but further investments are needed to ensure adequate<lb/> capacity in the medium term. UK ports handle more than 500 million tonnes of freight per year, making it<lb/> the biggest port industry in Europe. Because of UK&apos;s geography, the sector is crucial to the UK economy,<lb/> as 95% of traded goods pass through ports. The perception of UK port infrastructure is relatively good, but<lb/> not as high as in best-performing OECD countries (<ref type="figure">Figure 13</ref>, Panel A). Investment in harbour<lb/> infrastructure has been stable as a share of GDP (<ref type="figure">Figure 13</ref>, Panel B) since the late 1990s.<lb/> However, recent data show increasing congestion at UK ports (<ref type="biblio">World Bank, 2014</ref>) and the<lb/> government plans to extend port capacity substantially in the next 20-30 years through private financing to<lb/> match the projected increase in freight traffic (HMT, 2013). Successive governments have encouraged<lb/> private participation in the port sector resulting in strong competition. Private sector operators manage<lb/> 15 out of the 20 largest ports by tonnage and around two-thirds of the UK&apos;s port traffic (DfT, 2012b).<lb/> Overall, competitive pressures among ports in the UK are high (OECD, 2011b).<lb/> Ports will be essential to the provision of construction and maintenance services of offshore energy<lb/> installations. Ports already play an important role in the energy sector via the imports and exports of energy<lb/> supplies, including oil, liquefied natural gas and biomass. Because of the government&apos;s renewables targets,<lb/> decisions on expanding the port sector will have to take into account the need to support the development<lb/> of offshore sources of renewable energy.<lb/></p>

			<p>New investment is needed for the water sector to manage the challenges of climate change adaptation,<lb/> population growth and rising environmental standards. Currently, the biggest investment project since<lb/> privatisation concerns the Thames Tideway Tunnel (known also as the &quot; super sewer &quot; ), which is a proposed<lb/> tunnel running mostly under the Thames and central London to provide storage and conveyance of sewage<lb/> and rainwater discharges that currently overflow into the river (<ref type="biblio">Ofwat, 2014</ref>).<lb/> The UK requires steady investment to manage flood risks, partly due to the effect of climate change<lb/> (<ref type="figure">Figure 15</ref>). Compared to other European Union (EU) countries, the UK has an intermediate exposure to<lb/> flooding of coastal regions partly attributable to rising sea levels (<ref type="biblio">EEA, 2006</ref>). The most recent progress<lb/> report of the Committee on Climate Change, an independent body advising the UK government on climate<lb/> change, finds that many flood defence schemes require greater funding to ensure stronger protection<lb/> (CCC, 2014). In December 2014, the government announced a six-year programme of capital flood<lb/> defence improvement works in England, with a commitment to ensure real average spending growth of<lb/> almost 10% per year to 2021. The Thames estuary, which includes London, faces increasing risk of tidal<lb/> floods over the next 100 years (EA, 2012). The Thames Estuary 2100 Plan lays out steps to avoid such<lb/> risks, by monitoring climate change impacts and carefully assessing future investment needs, which<lb/> include options to replace the existing Thames barrier before it reaches the end of its useful life (currently<lb/> estimated to be in about 60 years&apos; time).<lb/></p>

			<head>Energy sector: Addressing supply constraints and boosting competition<lb/></head>

			<p>The quality of the electricity supply in the UK is perceived to be high (<ref type="figure">Figure 16</ref>, Panel A), but major<lb/> strains in electricity-generation capacity have emerged over the recent years. The regulator, Ofgem (the<lb/> Office of Gas and Electricity Market), first highlighted concerns over electricity-generation capacity in<lb/> 2010 as old coal-and oil-fired plants were being phased out without sufficient new investment generation<lb/> capacity being planned. Action is being taken to strengthen energy production and spending on electricity<lb/> infrastructure has soared since 2010 (<ref type="figure">Figure 16</ref>, Panel B). Most of the old coal-and oil-fired plants have<lb/> already been closed and the rest will be shut down by 2015, and capacity constraints should decline<lb/> thereafter when new plants will become operational (<ref type="biblio">Ofgem, 2014b</ref>).<lb/> The current energy sector structure emerged from the liberalisation reforms of the 1990s. The UK<lb/> energy sector is divided into three areas: i) the wholesale market where generators, suppliers and large<lb/> customers buy and sell electricity; ii) transmission and distribution networks at national and regional<lb/> levels; and iii) the retail market, where energy suppliers sell to domestic and business customers. Ofgem<lb/> issues licences to operate in each of these three areas. Its strongest regulatory powers apply to transmission<lb/> networks for which it sets periodic price controls and approves companies&apos; investment plans. No price<lb/> controls apply to wholesale and retail markets, on the premise that strong competition and consumer choice<lb/> will contribute to keep electricity retail prices low and drive sufficient investment in generation capacity<lb/> (in the wholesale and retail sectors, Ofgem is mainly responsible for monitoring market developments and<lb/> investigating anti-competitive practices) (<ref type="biblio">IEA, 2012</ref>).<lb/> Notwithstanding the liberalisation reforms of the 1990s, the electricity and gas sectors remain highly<lb/> concentrated. They are dominated by six large vertically integrated companies, which are successors of the<lb/> former regional monopolies and still have a strong position in their respective regions (IEA, 2012). The<lb/> residential retail market share of these companies – in both the electricity and gas sectors – is about 95%.<lb/> In both sectors, the market share of small suppliers increased from about 1% in 2010 to about 5% in 2014,<lb/></p>

The wholesale electricity market is also highly concentrated, with the<lb/> six largest vertically integrated companied owning about 70% of the generation capacity (Ofgem, 2014a).<lb/></p>

			<p>Competition among electricity generators is low. In its 2008 Retail Market Probe and the subsequent<lb/> 2011 Retail Market Review, Ofgem found that a combination of factors, including tariff complexity,<lb/> vertical integration of the major suppliers and tacit collusion among them restrained competition in the<lb/> electricity sector. High market concentration in the wholesale electricity market has led to low liquidity of<lb/> forward contracts, resulting in low price transparency and blurring price signals pointing to the needs for<lb/> new investment in generation capacity (<ref type="biblio">Stoft, 2003; Roques et al. 2005; Ofgem 2014a</ref>). Moreover, low<lb/> liquidity of forward contracts in the wholesale electricity sector has impinged negatively on competition,<lb/> by restricting market entry and hindering the expansion of small electricity suppliers and independent<lb/> generators (<ref type="biblio">IEA, 2012; Ofgem 2014a</ref>). The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) is investigating the<lb/> supply and acquisition of energy in the UK and will publish the final report at the end 2015 (CMA, 2014).<lb/> In early 2014, Ofgem enacted reforms to increase liquidity in the wholesale electricity market,<lb/> especially of forward contracts. These reforms impose new market-making obligations on eight large<lb/> electricity-generating companies in the expectation of increasing the share of electricity that is<lb/> exchange-traded (instead of traded over the counter) so as to improve price transparency of and access to<lb/> forward contracts by independent suppliers and generators. The government and the regulator will need to<lb/> monitor closely the effect of this reform and, if needed, take additional steps to further increase price<lb/> transparency of forward contracts.<lb/></p>

			<p>There is also a need to quantify the benefits and costs of the consequences of vertical integration in<lb/> the UK&apos;s energy markets, which could be done by Ofgem. Vertical integration might reflect a rational<lb/> response to relatively high transaction costs associated with the operation in wholesale power markets and<lb/> results in efficiency gains for the firm (<ref type="biblio">Coase, 1937; Williamson 1979; Jaskow, 2008</ref>).

			<p>The Electricity Market Reform (EMR) programme is a groundbreaking attempt to reform the<lb/> electricity market and tackle capacity constraints on a durable basis, while promoting low-carbon energy<lb/> sources. Its main feature consists of two innovative schemes to increase competition, support needed<lb/> investment to expand capacity and promote the use of low-carbon energy sources in electricity generation<lb/> (Box 3). The mechanisms to achieve these objectives are: i) the Contract for Difference (CfD) between a<lb/> low carbon electricity generator and a government-owned company (the CfD Counterparty), with the latter<lb/> paying the former the difference between a fixed &apos;strike price&apos; and a market reference price (or, if the<lb/> market reference price is higher than the strike price, the generator will pay the difference back to the CfD<lb/> Counterparty); and ii) the Capacity Market, which will provide regular payments to generators for ensuring<lb/> a certain degree of spare capacity is available to use when needed. Among OECD EU countries, France is<lb/> introducing capacity mechanism to ensure adequacy of electricity supply over the long term (RTE, 2014)<lb/> whereas Finland, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal, Spain and Sweden have already implemented some form<lb/> of a capacity remuneration mechanism (ACER, 2013). Both schemes will involve payments to private<lb/> sector electricity generators that will be auctioned and financed through a levy on energy bills.<lb/></p>

			<figure>Box 3. Main elements of the Electricity Market Reform<lb/> The Electricity Market Reform introduces two key mechanisms to incentivize investment in energy<lb/> infrastructure:<lb/></figure>

			<p> The Contract for Difference (CfD): its main purpose is to stimulate investment in low-carbon energy capacity<lb/> by paying the difference between the &apos;strike price&apos; – a price for electricity reflecting the cost of investing in a<lb/> particular low-carbon technology – and the &apos;reference price&apos;– a measure of the market price for electricity in<lb/> the United Kingdom. The CfD is essentially a feed-in tariff system for the whole sector. The CfD will provide<lb/> greater certainty and stability of revenues to generators by lowering their exposure to volatile wholesale<lb/> prices and protect consumers and the budget when electricity prices are above the strike price by having<lb/> generators pay back the difference. The CfD will support different kinds of low-carbon generation<lb/> technologies, but the support will differ according to the degree of development of each technology and will<lb/> be temporary as the government plans to withdraw it as renewable technologies become competitive.<lb/>  The Capacity Market: its main purpose is to ensure a sufficient and reliable electricity generation capacity to<lb/> meet demand. The capacity market aims at increasing investment in electricity generation to replace older<lb/> power stations and get the best out of existing generation to provide necessary capacity for the intermittent<lb/> supply of low-carbon generation technologies.<lb/></p>

			<figure>The timetable for the implementation of the Electricity Market Reform is the following:<lb/>  2014-2017: CfD will run alongside the Renewables Obligation, which will be closed to new entrants from<lb/> 2017. Established renewable technologies will enter a competitive auction to set the strike prices, with an<lb/> administrative strike price acting as a ceiling for bids. The first capacity auction took place in December<lb/> 2014 for delivery of capacity from winter 2018–19.<lb/>  2018-2019: The Capacity Market starts to deliver capacity.<lb/>  2020s: Continued maturity of technologies and movement towards technology neutral auctions; additional<lb/> storage and interconnection, and well-functioning energy markets across the European Union, will play an<lb/> increasingly large role in managing supply and demand.<lb/>  Late 2020s and beyond: Technologies are mature enough and the carbon price is high and sustainable<lb/> enough to allow all generators to compete without intervention.<lb/> Source: DECC (2014b).<lb/> ECO/WKP(2015)62<lb/></figure>

			<p>The Electricity Market Reform is well thought out, but continued detailed assessment of the level of<lb/> public support available (as recently started in the 2014 Annual Energy Statement) as well as the<lb/> organisation of highly competitive auctions are needed to contain costs and risks to consumers and the<lb/> budget. Policies to support renewables, although desirable to accelerate the transition towards green<lb/> growth, can entail costs – for the Treasury, users or both – which in difficult economic periods might<lb/> undermine popular and political support for them. For instance, in Germany these costs are set to reach<lb/> about 0.8% of GDP in 2014, reflecting the gap between generous feed-in tariffs, which has boosted the use<lb/> of renewables, and market prices (OECD, 2014c). The government has estimated that the electricity market<lb/> reform could slow the increase in household electricity bills and result in yearly savings of about GBP 40<lb/> (or 6%) per household on average over the period 2014–2030 for meeting the same objectives without the<lb/> Electricity Market Reform (DECC, 2013a). To achieve these targets, the government will need to take<lb/> special care to hold highly competitive auctions for the CfD and the Capacity Market and establish a robust<lb/> reference price for the CfD, which reflects market fundamentals and cannot be manipulated. The first<lb/> round of Capacity Market auctions was concluded in January 2015.<lb/></p>

			<head>Digital infrastructure: More investment is needed to bridge the regional digital divide<lb/></head>

			<p>The UK&apos;s digital economy is well developed as the country offers one of the most conducive<lb/> environments for the development of information and communications technologies<lb/> (<ref type="biblio">Bilbao-Osorio et al., 2013</ref>). The UK has made progress in the rollout of high-speed services over recent<lb/> years, but it lags behind the best performing countries in the EU regarding the uptake of fast and ultrafast<lb/> fixed broadband, and the coverage of the latest (4G) mobile technology (<ref type="figure">Figure 17</ref>). However, the<lb/> proportion of fast fixed connection surged from 5% in 2011 to about 20% in 2014 and the average speed<lb/> has continued to increase (<ref type="biblio">Ofcom, 2014</ref>). The gap between advertised and effective broadband speeds is<lb/> larger in the UK than in the other EU countries, while the costs of access to broadband services are below<lb/> (above) the EU average for standard (superfast) broadband (EC, 2014a). There are indications that some<lb/> small businesses face difficulties in accessing fast broadband (<ref type="biblio">FSB, 2014; Ofcom, 2014</ref>).<lb/> The telecommunication market in the UK is highly competitive. The UK comes first on product<lb/> market regulation and among the best performers on regulatory management in the telecommunication<lb/> sector (<ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>). Operators are regulated by the Office of Communications (Ofcom), which also has<lb/> competition law power. Ofcom reported that the variation of the availability and quality of<lb/> telecommunications services across the UK is partly attributable to the largely market-led approach to<lb/> service provision (<ref type="biblio">Ofcom, 2013</ref>), in common with other OECD countries. Once the cost to the provider of<lb/> extending the infrastructure exceeds the revenues they generate, the provider no longer has an incentive to<lb/> extend the infrastructure. While Universal Service Obligation (USO) has virtually ensured universal access<lb/> to basic telecommunications, such as fixed telephony, the expansion of fast broadband coverage by the<lb/> private sector is more difficult to achieve.<lb/> International experience shows that market forces do not always lead to sufficient provision of<lb/> broadband services in all geographical areas of a country. For instance, empirical evidence for the<lb/> telecommunication sector suggests that allowing regulated access to incumbent&apos;s infrastructure, as a way<lb/> to increase retail competition, increases the quality of services – in terms of connection speed – but it may<lb/> also result in reduced investment, leading to lower broadband penetration (<ref type="biblio">Grajek and Roller, 2012;<lb/> Nardotto et al., 2013; Crandall et al., 2013</ref>). Competition helps drive down prices and increase quality and<lb/> variety of services, but the authorities also need to create the right incentives to promote the access to<lb/> modern digital services and raise penetration rates in rural areas, as extending telecommunication<lb/> infrastructure therein can be highly costly and deter private investment.<lb/></p>

			<p>In 2010, the government set the objective to provide the UK with the fastest broadband network in the<lb/> EU. This included a pledge to ensure access to broadband in rural areas even if it is not commercially<lb/> viable. The government has an ambitious goal of providing universal access to broadband by 2017, with a<lb/> minimum speed of 24 megabits per second (Mbps) in at least 95% of premises. The authorities are also<lb/> currently conducting a series of pilot projects to address the coverage for the remaining 5%. To achieve<lb/> these targets, the government will need to decrease the regional disparities in the availability of broadband,<lb/> which – in common with virtually every OECD country – are large, especially for fast broadband<lb/> (<ref type="table">Table 1</ref>). There is evidence that the gap in access to modern telecommunications services among local<lb/> authorities is slowly closing but the dispersion in penetration rate of fast broadband is still large<lb/> (<ref type="figure">Figure 18</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<p>The UK government should improve the competitive framework to award subsidies to expand<lb/> broadband services in rural areas. This will minimise the costs for the exchequer and accelerate the<lb/> achievement of the government&apos;s targets of providing universal access to broadband services. The<lb/> experience of Chile in awarding subsidies on a competitive basis is highly positive as it succeeded in<lb/> lowering the share of people without basic communications services from 15% in the mid-1900s to 1% in<lb/> 2002 (<ref type="biblio">Wellenius, 2002</ref>). Stronger government support to expand broadband access underpins the European<lb/> Commission&apos;s digital strategy, which allows for exceptional government subsidies for broadband rollout<lb/> (EC, 2013). The implementation of the government&apos;s rural broadband programme has been criticised as<lb/> only the historical incumbent (British Telecom, BT) has faced little competition or no competition during<lb/> the bidding process and won all contracts. The House of Commons Public Accounts Committee has argued<lb/> that the Department of Culture Media and Sport&apos;s procurement approach for the rural broadband<lb/> programme has resulted in too little competition among potential bidders (<ref type="biblio">HoC, 2014</ref>). This has in turn<lb/> resulted in a lack of transparency about the costs the sole supplier (BT) actually incurs in deploying<lb/> broadband services in rural areas and in lower-than-expected capital contribution by BT (<ref type="biblio">HoC, 2014</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<head>Infrastructure is key to move towards green growth<lb/> Shifting transport to environmentally friendly modes<lb/></head>

			<p>Passenger transport has increased considerably since the 1980s, mainly driven by a surge in the use of<lb/> cars, although it has stabilised more recently (<ref type="biblio">DfT, 2014a</ref>). In 2012, cars accounted for more than<lb/> two-thirds of total passenger transport, walking for close to a fifth, local buses for about 5%, and rail and<lb/> other transport modes (such as air travel, motorcycles and tram) accounted for less than 5% each. Domestic<lb/> freight transport increased steadily over the 1990s and until the mid-2000s, thereafter it flattened and<lb/> declined as a consequence of the economic crisis.<lb/></p>

			<figure>Transport accounts for a large share of total greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution, in particular<lb/> from road transport. In 2011, transport was responsible for almost 30% of UK greenhouse gas emissions,<lb/> compared to less than 20% in 1990. Road transport was the largest contributor to total transport emissions,<lb/> accounting for about two-thirds of transport greenhouse gas emissions, international aviation and shipping<lb/> -20<lb/> -10<lb/> 0<lb/> 10<lb/> 20<lb/> 30<lb/> 40<lb/> 50<lb/> 60<lb/> 70<lb/> -10<lb/> 0<lb/></figure>

In 2008, 80% and close to 40% of<lb/> particulate matter (PM) emissions in London and Manchester, respectively, originated from road transport<lb/> (Moore, 2012). Pollution generates large economic costs and negatively affects well-being<lb/> (OECD, 2014a). In the UK, the death rate form air pollution is around the OECD average. Although it<lb/> declined from 2005 to 2010, it is still significantly higher than in some other affluent OECD countries<lb/> (<ref type="figure">Figure 19</ref>). Surveys also reveal that in the UK almost half of the population considers exhaust fumes in<lb/> towns and cities as a major problem (DfT, 2014b).<lb/></p>

			<figure>Figure 19. Deaths from air pollution are about OECD average<lb/> Number of deaths per million capita<lb/> Source: OECD (2014), The Cost of Air Pollution: Health Impacts of Road Transport.<lb/></figure>

			<p>A comprehensive transport infrastructure strategy will need to ensure an adequate supply of<lb/> infrastructure and its efficient use, but also to shift transport towards more environmentally-friendly<lb/> modes, such as trains, buses and bicycles. In the UK, there is room to shift freight transport from roads to<lb/> railways, which would diminish the environmental impact of the transport system and would reduce road<lb/> congestion. Currently, the share of railway freight transport is slightly lower than in the other EU countries.<lb/> Several private rail freight companies operate in the market, which functions well as incumbents lost their<lb/> dominant position following the privatisation in the mid-1990s (OECD, 2013a). The government should<lb/> consider substantially increasing the freight grants managed by the Department of Transport through the<lb/> Mode Shift Revenue Support Scheme. These grants provide incentives to freight companies to transport<lb/> freight by rail (and water) instead of road. In the 2013-14 financial year, these grants accounted for slightly<lb/> above GBP 15 million out of more than GBP 5 billion of government support to the railway sector, thus<lb/> even doubling this amount would not have a large impact on the budget.<lb/></p>

			<head>Supporting renewable energy sources and increasing energy efficiency<lb/></head>

			<p>The UK relies on a large array of policies to increase energy efficiency and to promote the use of<lb/> renewable energy sources (DEEC, 2013a). These policies seem to be bearing fruit. From 2005 to 2011,<lb/> households&apos; electricity and gas consumption declined by respectively about 10% and 20% because of<lb/> energy efficiency improvements (DECC, 2013a). Greenhouse gas emission per unit of GDP almost halved<lb/> since 1990. This was mainly due to changes in the energy mix. Between 1990 and 2012, the share of coal<lb/> in total energy supply fell from close to 30% to 20%, from almost 40% to about 30% for oil, while gas<lb/> increased from nearly 25% to 35% (IEA, 2012). The share of renewable energy in total energy supply<lb/> increased from 1% in 1990 to 5% in 2012, still some way off the 15% target in 2020 as part of the EU<lb/> strategy on renewable energy. In electricity generation, the share of renewable energy sources increased<lb/> from less than 5% in 2005 to more than 10% in 2013 (<ref type="figure">Figure 20</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<p>Current targets to increase the share of renewables in the energy mix and reform the electricity sector<lb/> are worthwhile initiatives, but they will contribute to raise retail electricity prices (DECC, 2013a). Their<lb/> effects on energy bills, especially for poor households, will need to be closely monitored. In 2013, retail<lb/> gas and electricity prices for households were below the EU-28 average, while electricity prices for the<lb/> industry exceeded the OECD average (<ref type="figure">Figure 21</ref>). On average in 2013, energy and climate change policies<lb/> accounted for about 10% of households energy bills (DECC, 2013b). However, accounting for the effect of<lb/> the numerous energy saving policies now in place, the Department of Energy and Climate Change<lb/> estimated that in 2013 these policies yielded a 5% saving on the households&apos; energy bill.<lb/> Looking ahead, the government should consider simplifying the energy-efficiency policy framework<lb/> by moving towards a single carbon price applying to all economic activities, reducing compliance costs<lb/> and raising awareness across the population of the initiatives offering the highest value for money. The<lb/> many policies now in place often overlap, making the overall policy framework overly complex and likely<lb/> to result in different effective carbon prices in different parts of the economy.<lb/></p>

			<head>Attracting private financing for infrastructure spending<lb/></head>

			<p>The role of the public and private sector in financing and managing infrastructure has changed over<lb/> time (Box 4). The current environment, characterized by low government borrowing costs and low<lb/> inflation, presents a good opportunity to increase public infrastructure spending. Recent evidence from<lb/> advanced economies suggests that in the current macroeconomic situation public investment that is<lb/> financed by issuing debt has larger output effects than when it is financed by raising taxes or cutting other<lb/> spending (IMF, 2014).<lb/></p>

			<head>Box 4. The changing roles of the public and private sectors in infrastructure financing over time<lb/></head>

			<p>Across history, there have been different patterns of private and public involvement in infrastructure financing. In<lb/> the 1930s and 1940s, infrastructure investment was largely made by the private sector, frequently with implicit or<lb/> explicit subsidies or other forms of government support. The private sector then came to be widely regarded as taking<lb/> too short-term approach and, as its investment record was considered insufficient, large parts of infrastructure were<lb/> taken into public ownership in the 1960s and 1970s. However, the performance of public infrastructure – airports,<lb/> highways, waterways and public railways – was considered unsatisfactory owing to cost overrides, planning and<lb/> construction delays as well as safety problems, lack of innovation and technological advance (<ref type="biblio">Henckel and<lb/> McKibbin, 2010</ref>). To address some of these problems, in the late half of the 20th century, infrastructure investment<lb/> entered a new phase with privatization, new regulation models were introduced together with new ways of cooperation<lb/> under innovative legal frameworks for public-private partnerships (PPPs) (<ref type="biblio">Wagenvoort et al., 2010</ref>). The PPP was first<lb/> introduced in the United Kingdom (UK), but it was quickly adopted by other European Union countries that nowadays<lb/> account for a larger share of PPPs than the UK.<lb/> However, rising public spending on infrastructure would strain the government&apos;s fiscal consolidation<lb/> plan. Given this tension, the government can at best reprioritize public spending and otherwise devote<lb/> greater efforts to attract more private financing. The government is already shifting public spending<lb/> towards infrastructure as it plans to increase infrastructure spending by GBP 3 billion each year from<lb/> 2015-16, while adhering to its fiscal consolidation plan. This is a welcome move but unlikely to contribute<lb/> substantially to necessary spending on infrastructure, which, according to the National Infrastructure Plan<lb/> and the National Infrastructure Pipeline, would need to amount to more than GBP 460 billion to 2020 and<lb/> beyond (HMT, 2014a).<lb/> Attracting additional private capital in infrastructure will be key to financing the government&apos;s<lb/> infrastructure plan (<ref type="figure">Figure 22</ref>). Water infrastructure projects are expected to be wholly privately financed<lb/> and private finance should fund about 95% of investment in the energy sector. In transport, public<lb/> financing is projected to play instead an important role, providing slightly more than half of the total<lb/> spending.<lb/></p>

			<head>Unlocking private sector investment by proposing ready-to-finance projects<lb/></head>

			<p>Infrastructure projects are – in principle – attractive assets for private equity investors and debt<lb/> providers. They tend to offer stable returns, low volatility and hedge inflation. They also help to diversify<lb/></p>

			<figure>0<lb/> 20<lb/> 40<lb/> 60<lb/> 80<lb/> 100<lb/> Total<lb/> Digital<lb/> Energy<lb/> Flood<lb/> Research<lb/> Transport<lb/> Waste<lb/> Water<lb/> Private<lb/> Public/Private<lb/> Public<lb/> ECO/WKP(2015)62<lb/></figure>

			<p>portfolios as the correlation between infrastructure investment and other assets is low, especially for equity<lb/> capital (WEF, 2014b).<lb/> However, long-term institutional investors (such as pension funds and life insurers) still allocate only<lb/> a limited share of their resources on direct infrastructure investment (<ref type="figure">Figure 23</ref>). Also, they seem to prefer<lb/> the secondary market, as capital can be deployed quickly across a broader range of assets and the planning,<lb/> construction and start-up stages of projects involve high risks that investors prefer to avoid<lb/> (<ref type="biblio">Dewing et al., 2013</ref>). Globally, most of the investment of large pension funds is directed towards fixed<lb/> income and cash (around 60%), listed equity (nearly 30%) or other alternative investments (10 %) – of<lb/> which a tiny part, around 1%, goes to unlisted infrastructure investment (<ref type="biblio">Inderset and Della Croce, 2014;<lb/> Subacchi et al., 2014</ref>). Among long-term institutional investors, only pension funds in Canada and<lb/> Australia have a non-negligible share of their portfolio (around 5-6%) invested in domestic and foreign<lb/> infrastructure projects.<lb/></p>

			<figure>Figure 23. The share of alternative investment in asset allocation is low<lb/> Per cent of total asset allocation, 2014<lb/> Source: Mercer (2014), European Asset Allocation Survey.<lb/></figure>

			<p>The UK ranks 10 th among a set of developed and developing countries in terms of attractiveness for<lb/> private investment in infrastructure, although among OECD countries Canada, Sweden, Norway, the<lb/> United States and Australia all rank higher (<ref type="biblio">Arcadis, 2014</ref>). Recently, the involvement of UK institutional<lb/> investors in long-term infrastructure has risen, also beyond the domestic economy. For example, the BT<lb/> Pension Scheme has recently taken a 13% stake in Thames Water (the UK water supplier), while the<lb/> Universities Superannuation Scheme, together with a consortium, invested directly in ConnectEast (an<lb/> Australian road owner and operator) (FT, 2014a). However, further action is needed to match institutional<lb/> investors&apos; preferences with the UK&apos;s large infrastructure needs.<lb/></p>

			<p>While the National Infrastructure Plan and its regular updates are a step in the right direction, the<lb/> government should bolster ready-to-finance projects in the National Infrastructure Pipeline so as to attract<lb/> more private investors. Private investors are especially interested in ready-to-finance infrastructure projects<lb/> as the initial stages of projects – scoping, planning and consents – involve large additional risks. Between<lb/> 2013 and 2014, the share of infrastructure projects having reached the stage of &quot; Consents Approved &quot; (that<lb/> is before the construction stage) declined from 15% to less than 5%; those in the construction stage<lb/> increased from 45% to more than 60%; those in the &quot; Planning and Consents &quot; stage were stable at around<lb/> 10% (HMT, 2014b). The insufficient involvement of long-term equity investors is not due to shortage of<lb/> private capital. The combined assets of liability-constrained investors (such as pension funds and insurance<lb/> companies) and asset-based investors (such as sovereign wealth funds, endowments and family officers)<lb/> amount globally to USD 50 trillion (WEF, 2014b). A recent OECD (2013b) report for the G20 leaders<lb/> underlines that across OECD countries large amounts of equity capital have been allocated to infrastructure<lb/> asset class, but in fact they remain un-invested. This is because of a combination of factors, including high<lb/> returns thresholds for a given risk level because of perceived policy uncertainty. At the EU level, the<lb/> absence of ready-to-finance infrastructure projects have slow down the take up of recent initiatives to<lb/> attract private investors in infrastructure sectors, such as the Loan Guarantee Instrument for<lb/> Trans-European Transport Network Projects (Box 5).<lb/></p>

			<head>Box 5. Recent EU initiatives to attract private investment in infrastructure<lb/></head>

			<p>The Connecting Europe Facility (CEF) is aimed to be a catalyst for further private and public funding by giving<lb/> infrastructure projects credibility and lowering their risk profiles, thereby attracting investors. One of the CEF&apos;s key<lb/> elements is more systematic use of innovative financial instruments, such guaranteed loans, to provide a funding<lb/> alternative to traditional grants and fill financing gaps for strategic investments.<lb/></p>

			<p>The high levels of revenue risk in the early stages of public-private-partnership transport projects can cause<lb/> difficulties in attracting private sector funding. Indeed, one of the major hindrances of a large private involvement in<lb/> transport infrastructure is the concern that user-dependent revenue (tolls, fares etc.) may not reach medium-term<lb/> target. Therefore, the Loan Guarantee Instrument for Trans-European Transport (LGTT) has been introduced to<lb/> partially cover risks for network projects of common interest and to receive income from user-charges.<lb/></p>

			<p>The LGTT normally guarantees a maximum of 10% of senior debt (20% in exceptional instances) up to a<lb/> maximum of EUR 200 million per project. This support substantially enhances credit quality, thereby encouraging a<lb/> reduction of risk margins applied to senior project loans. This support is available for as much as 5 to 7 years after<lb/> project completion. The European Investment Bank and the European Commission have jointly contributed<lb/> EUR 1 billion in capital, which could support up to EUR 20 billion of senior loans. A recent evaluation of the LGTT<lb/> project (EC, 2014a) shows that while LGTT covers only the traffic risk, investors are looking for more general<lb/> instruments covering broader risks, such as construction and re-financing risks, as well as the traffic risk beyond the<lb/> first 5 to 7 years.<lb/></p>

			<head>Improving incentives for greenfield projects<lb/></head>

			<p>The National Infrastructure Plan focuses primarily on greenfield investment (investment in new<lb/> infrastructure), but private investors tend to prefer brownfield investment (investment in already existing<lb/> infrastructure). Greenfield projects are perceived as more risky owing to the lack of clarity in bidding<lb/> criteria, delays in the award of projects, pre-construction delays, and delays in financial approvals and<lb/> construction risks (OECD, 2012a). Among private investors, there is the perception that the UK<lb/> government should take more of the risk involved in new infrastructure projects. There is a feeling that<lb/> governments in continental European countries are willing to offer more security to investors than the UK<lb/> (FT, 2013).<lb/> The government could better target the use of the UK Guarantees Scheme by strengthening current<lb/> incentives for private investors supporting greenfield projects. The government introduced this scheme in<lb/> 2012 with the Infrastructure (Financial Assistance) Act to provide a sovereign-backed guarantee to<lb/> improve access to finance of projects. The government offers support for greenfield or projects in the<lb/> construction phase, but it can also do so for the acquisition, design, conversion, improvement, operation<lb/> and repair of infrastructure assets. The government has a wide discretion over how a guarantee is<lb/> structured and it is provided in return for a fee to be charged at market rates (<ref type="biblio">Allen &amp; Overy, 2013</ref>). Up to<lb/> GBP 40 billion in guarantees can be offered. By September 2014, the UK Guarantee Scheme was used for<lb/> six projects (four in the transport and two in the energy sector) for a total of GBP 1.5 billion.<lb/></p>

			<p>The government should also explore in depth the option of using capital recycling to finance<lb/> greenfield projects. Capital recycling involves reinvesting the revenues from the privatization of existing<lb/> brownfield assets, alongside private sector funds, into new greenfield projects. The 2014 update of the<lb/> National Infrastructure Plan mentions capital recycling as a possible financing option but does not provide<lb/> details on how and for which projects this option could be used. Australia is currently considering a more<lb/> intensive use of capital recycling (Office of the National Infrastructure <ref type="biblio">Coordinator, 2013</ref>). Its recent<lb/> experience in this area points to the need of effectively communicating how the funds will be used and<lb/> how a project would benefit the broad community.<lb/></p>

			<p>Better linking national and local planning systems through the long-term infrastructure strategy would<lb/> improve project implementation and avoid delays in greenfield project delivery. The UK infrastructure<lb/> investment and decision-making process has been historically highly centralised. At the same time, it has<lb/> suffered from the absence of a clear national strategy and planning process. This has contributed to slow<lb/> down project planning and implementation. The UK government is aware of this contradiction and has<lb/> taken step to improve the coherence between the national and local planning systems with the adoption of<lb/> the National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) and the Nationally Significant Infrastructure Projects<lb/> (<ref type="biblio">NSIPs)<lb/></ref> The NPPF, introduced in 2012, sets out the government&apos;s planning policies for England. The NPPF&apos;s<lb/> main features are significantly simplified national planning guidelines and decentralised procedures for<lb/> local authorities developing local plans (<ref type="biblio">Chesire et al., 2012</ref>). To date, about 80% of local authorities have<lb/> published a Local Plan (HMT, 2013). The government should make sure that project implementations are<lb/> not delayed by the absence of local plans and encourage local authorities who have not yet done so to<lb/> adopt a local plan.<lb/></p>

			<p>The NSIP framework institutes a separate planning procedure for large infrastructure projects. Since<lb/> its inception, several projects have been granted approval in this way, for example nuclear power plants<lb/> and wind farms. Such projects, which are subject to specific investment thresholds, do not need to obtain<lb/> separate consents including planning permissions, and their development depends on a final decision of<lb/> relevant secretary of state.<lb/></p>

			<head>Stimulating institutions that promote long-term infrastructure investment<lb/></head>

			<p>Public financial institutions dedicated to long-term investment can play a key role in the financing of<lb/> infrastructure. In some European countries, national development banks facilitate the provision of<lb/> long-term loans and crowd-in private finance. For instance, Kreditanstalt für Wiederaufbau (KfW) in<lb/> Germany provides low-interest, long-term loans (20-30 years) for infrastructure projects with fixed interest<lb/> rates and a maximum of three-to-five repayment-free startup years (<ref type="biblio">Weber and Alfen, 2010</ref>). In Italy,<lb/> Cassa Depositi e Prestiti (CDP) provides either direct financial support for key domestic infrastructure<lb/> projects through loans, or indirect support through investments in infrastructure funds. At the EU level, the<lb/> European Investment Bank raises funds on the capital markets and lends them on favourable terms<lb/> (<ref type="biblio">Subacchi et al., 2014</ref>).<lb/> The EU has started new initiatives to promote long-term investment in infrastructure and to<lb/> co-ordinate the activities of European national development banks so as to make them more effective in<lb/> supporting infrastructure investment (Box 6) (<ref type="biblio">Valla et al., 2014</ref>). In addition in late 2014, the European<lb/> Commission announced an Investment Pan for Europe (the so-called Juncker&apos;s plan) with the aim of<lb/> unlocking public and private investments of at least EUR 315 billion over three years (2015-17). To<lb/> achieve this target a new European Fund for Strategic Investments is being set up so as to provide risk<lb/> support for long-term investments and ensure increased access to risk financing for small and<lb/> medium-sized enterprises and mid-cap companies (EC, 2014c).The UK government should support these<lb/> initiatives at the European level as the UK along with other European countries should benefit from them.<lb/></p>

			<figure>Box 6. Recent EU initiatives to support long-term investment in infrastructure<lb/></figure>

			<p>Recently, European national development banks have joined forces with other leading financial institutions,<lb/> forming the Marguerite Fund. The Marguerite Fund is part of the new financial instruments introduced under the wider<lb/> &quot; Europe 2020 &quot; strategy. The Marguerite Fund is a pan-European equity fund that acts as a catalyst for key investments<lb/> in renewables, energy and transport. It combines a market-based principle of return to investors with the pursuit of<lb/> public policy objectives. Launched in 2010, with the backing of six major European financial institutions (namely the<lb/> European Investment Bank, Caisse des Dépôts et Consignations, Cassa Depositi e Prestiti, Instituto de Crédito Oficial,<lb/> Kreditanstalt für Wiederaufbau, PKO Bank Polski), it makes capital-intensive infrastructure investments. Together with<lb/> the European Commission and other institutional investors the fund has commitments of about EUR 700 million.<lb/> In 2013, the European Commission proposed the introduction of a new fund, the European Long-Term<lb/> Investment Fund (ELTIF), whose implementation is now discussed in the European Parliament. The ELTIF is designed<lb/> to channel investment from retail and institutional investors into companies and projects by offering an appropriate risk<lb/> and return profile. The ELTIF will offer investors the opportunity to make long-term investment into a mixture of<lb/> long-term assets (such as private equity and infrastructure) and transferable securities.<lb/></p>

			<p>In 2010, the UK established the Green Investment Bank (GIB) and the authorities should expand its<lb/> operation to emerging low-carbon technologies. The GIB is the first institution devoted to financing<lb/> infrastructure projects promoting green growth. With available government funding of slightly less than<lb/> GBP 4 billion by April 2015, the GIB is investing in innovative, environmentally-friendly areas for which<lb/> there is currently a lack of sufficient support from the market. This includes many infrastructure projects,<lb/> such as offshore wind generation, waste recycling, energy from waste, as well as biomass and energy<lb/> efficiency measures. Since starting operation, the GIB has made 22 transactions totaling about GDP 750<lb/> million, which have leveraged close to GBP 2 billion of total funding from private investors. In the absence<lb/> of a plan to establish a national infrastructure bank and given the ambitious government&apos;s targets to<lb/> transition towards a green growth model, the government should support – through grants and guarantees –<lb/> not yet commercially viable low-carbon technologies that have the prospect of becoming so, such as<lb/> carbon capture and storage, marine energy, and biofuels for transport.<lb/></p>

			<head>Supporting PPPs while transparently recording liabilities and assets arising from them<lb/></head>

			<p>The UK has a well-established system of public-private partnerships (PPPs) as it developed the<lb/> Private Finance Initiatives (PFI) framework in the 1990s. By the end of March 2014, almost 730 PFI<lb/> projects were financed through this route, with an aggregate capital value of slightly more than<lb/> GBP 55 billion. Infrastructure sectors (transport and waste) account for less than 25% of the total capital<lb/> costs of all PFI projects (<ref type="figure">Figure 24</ref>, Panel A). The yearly payment from the government to the private<lb/> partner for infrastructure PPP projects currently amounts to about 20% of the corresponding payment for<lb/> all PPP projects and it is poised to fall from the mid-2020s (<ref type="figure">Figure 24</ref>, Panel B).<lb/> The government should seek to increase the use of PFI as a way to manage the construction risks<lb/> more effectively and attract more private investors in infrastructure sectors. The likelihood of costs overrun<lb/> in the construction phase is lower for PFI than for traditional procurement methods (<ref type="biblio">Duffield, 2008;<lb/> Blanc-Brude and Makovsek, 2013</ref>). Using PFI in regulated infrastructure sectors for large new projects<lb/> would complement the gains in operational efficiencies that infrastructure-sector regulation generates with<lb/> well-managed construction risks (<ref type="biblio">Makovsek, 2015</ref>). The Tideway Tunnel presents a recent example in this<lb/> direction as the government guarantees the construction risks and the new infrastructure, when completed,<lb/> will be transferred to the regulated asset based of the regulated company owning it (Thames Water Utility).<lb/></p>

			<p>Private Finance 2 (PF2) was introduced in 2012 to replace the previous PFI model. This new scheme<lb/> aims at improving the value for money and transparency of PPP projects, including those for infrastructure.<lb/> An assessment of the previous system revealed lack of transparency and optimism bias in project<lb/> preparation (NAO, 2011). Also, there is a perception that private investors have made windfall profits,<lb/> causing concerns about the value for money of projects (HMT, 2012). One of the main innovations of PF2<lb/> is to involve the government as a minority public equity co-investor in new deals. This reform is likely to<lb/> better align the incentives of the public and private partners, although it also increases taxpayer exposure to<lb/> projects that fail. PF2 also provides stronger incentives to deliver projects on time and budget as, for<lb/> instance, payments to the successful private sector bidder will be made only when the operating asset is<lb/> delivered (HMT, 2012). Recent G20-OECD work on long-term investments in infrastructure suggests the<lb/> need to find a balance between public support to private investors and ensuing moral hazard from the<lb/> private sector (OECD, 2014d).<lb/> The government should make available to investors and the public comparable data about the<lb/> performance of PPP projects. The latest change in the PFI regime was partly motivated by lack of data and<lb/> transparency on the financial and operational performance of PPP projects (HMT, 2012). The government<lb/> has introduced some measures to improve data transparency, notably by requiring the private sector to<lb/> provide actual and expected equity return information for publication. An additional step forward would be<lb/> to make available to the public, quantitative assessments comparing the value for money offered by PPPs<lb/> relative to alternative procurement routes, consistent with the OECD Principles for Public Governance of<lb/> PPPs (OECD, 2014e). A recent joint collaboration between the University College of London and the<lb/> consultancy firm KPMG has produced two assessments of the performance of PPP projects in the<lb/> education and health sectors in the UK (<ref type="biblio">Edkins et al., 2011; Ive et al., 2010</ref>). In Australia, the University of<lb/> Melbourne PPP Benchmarking Study is another example of a study comparing the effectiveness of PPP in<lb/> terms of costs and delays with alternative procurement routes in Australia (<ref type="biblio">Duffield, 2008</ref>). Such<lb/> information would help to assess the risks hindering private participation in infrastructure (OECD, 2014f),<lb/> hence supporting a more informed decision-making process on the choice of procurement.<lb/></p>

			<p>The government should continue to transparently record assets and contingent liabilities arising from<lb/> PPPs in the Whole Government Accounts (WGA). In 2013, capital liabilities in the WGA related to all PFI<lb/> accounted for a tiny share of gross total liabilities (about 1%), being close to GBP 40 billion (out of which<lb/> GBP 5 billion was recorded in the National Accounts). If all PFI-related investment were undertaken<lb/> through conventional debt finance, public sector net debt would have been around 2 percentage points of<lb/> GDP higher than currently measured (OBR, 2014).<lb/></p>

			<head>Better pooling resources of institutional investors<lb/></head>

			<p>The government should support initiatives contributing to overcome the problems of investing in<lb/> infrastructure assets caused by the fragmentation of the UK pension system and the lack of necessary<lb/> expertise to evaluate infrastructure investments. The main reason why the UK pension funds have<lb/> historically invested relatively small amounts in infrastructure assets seems to be the lack of in-house<lb/> expertise to invest directly in such assets and a weak capacity to assess their risks. This is related to the<lb/> insufficient size of many institutional investors, which in itself is another impediment to long-term<lb/> infrastructure investment. The UK pension system is heavily fragmented. While there are GBP 1.5 trillion<lb/> in assets under management of the industry, these are unevenly distributed among 7 500 schemes. Of the<lb/> total, 1 000 schemes have assets below GBP 5 million and only 190 of them have more than GBP 1 billion<lb/> (OECD, 2014g). The development of specific skills is therefore essential for changing<lb/> investors&apos; investment habits and increasing participation in less liquid, longer-term assets (<ref type="biblio">Deau, 2011</ref>).<lb/> This must be accompanied by actions by governments and stakeholders to pool funds so as to reduce<lb/> fragmentation and improve information collection and financial education campaign (<ref type="biblio">Della<lb/> Croce et al. 2011</ref>).<lb/> To overcome these problems, the UK introduced in 2012 the Pensions Infrastructure Platform (PIP).<lb/> The PIP is a collaboration between the National Association of Pension Funds (NAPF) and the Pension<lb/> Protection Fund (PPF). Its aim is to explore options for pension funds to invest in UK infrastructure on<lb/> more favourable terms than are currently available through traditional fund managers (OECD, 2014g). The<lb/> PIP&apos;s design was modelled on Australia&apos;s IFM Investors, a fund manager owned by 30 Australian<lb/> non-profit pension funds to invest, inter alia, in infrastructure assets. Although the PIP is the result of an<lb/> agreement with the government, the scheme is entirely independent. The platform secured ten founding<lb/> investors but so far results have been below expectation as at October 2014 the fund has secured only<lb/> GBP 350 million, against an initial GBP 2 billion target, and is investing in the &quot; secondary market &quot; rather<lb/> greenfield projects (FT, 2014b).<lb/></p>

			<head>Promoting new financial instruments for long-term infrastructure investment<lb/></head>

			<p>Because of the dearth of appropriate financing vehicles, only the largest investors have the capacity to<lb/> directly fund infrastructure projects (Della <ref type="biblio">Croce and Yermo, 2013</ref>). Collective investment vehicles are<lb/> available, such as infrastructure funds, but because of high fees and extensive leverage these have become<lb/> less popular since the financial crisis.<lb/></p>

			<p>The large majority of infrastructure projects is debt-financed (the world average is around 85%) and<lb/> the commercial banks have been the key providers. During the crisis banks scaled back infrastructure<lb/> loans, raised interest rates and shifted assets to shorter maturities. Standard and Poor&apos;s has estimated that<lb/> between 2011 and 2012 the fall in project finance loans was in the range of 10-30%. More recently, banks<lb/> have been reporting stronger capacity to provide longer-term lending for infrastructure and the cost of<lb/> credit has fallen.<lb/> Developing project bonds (issued by one company or jointly by several companies) to finance specific<lb/> infrastructure projects could partly substitute for reduced bank finance. Project bonds are the main source<lb/> ECO/WKP(2015)62<lb/> of infrastructure finance other than bank debt and account for 10% of the global private debt funding<lb/> (<ref type="biblio">Inderset, 2013</ref>). These instruments service the borrowed capital through the project&apos;s revenue and have<lb/> several advantages for financial investors, including better identification of risks and a competitive rate of<lb/> return. Recent transactions for long-dated project bonds offered yields of between 5% and 6.5%. This is<lb/> higher than the 4-5% yields available on sovereign bonds with equivalent ratings. In the UK, infrastructure<lb/> bonds guaranteed by monoline insurance companies were relatively common in PPPs before the financial<lb/> crisis (EPEC, 2012). However, the demise of monoline insurance companies in the wake of the crisis has<lb/> reduced the attractiveness of project bonds among investors.<lb/> The UK government could work in partnership with national and European financial institutions to<lb/> support infrastructure project bonds by developing an insurance market for them. The EU is promoting a<lb/> more intensive use infrastructure bonds (Box 7). Moreover, the UK government could consider granting a<lb/> tax exemption or a reduced tax rate to raise incentives for the development of project bonds issued by<lb/> corporations. Such an intervention would have to be justified by positive externalities infrastructure<lb/> provides and the market failures in properly assessing the risk involved in long-term infrastructure projects.<lb/> The United States has successfully adopted this approach to develop a dynamic municipal bond market to<lb/> finance infrastructure projects while the Australian government offered tax reliefs on infrastructure bonds<lb/> in the 1990s, which however were later repealed (<ref type="biblio">Abelson, 2005</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<head>Box 7. The EU 2020 Project Bond Initiative<lb/></head>

			<p>The EU 2020 Project Bond Initiative, together with the Loan Guarantee for TEN Transport and the Marguerite<lb/> Fund, is part of the new financial instruments foreseen under the proposed &quot; Connecting Europe Facility &quot; (CEF), which<lb/> is part of the wider &quot; Europe 2020 &quot; strategy. The aim of the CEF is to provide a longer-term financial framework<lb/> ensuring that energy, transport and telecommunications projects are developed and implemented in a timely and<lb/> effective manner. The Project Bond initiative is designed to enable eligible infrastructure projects promoters, usually<lb/> public-private partnerships (PPP), to attract additional private finance from institutional investors such as insurance<lb/> companies and pension funds. This is planned to be achieved by providing credit enhancement to the infrastructure<lb/> promoters, whose debt will effectively be divided into two tranches, senior and subordinated.<lb/> The subordinated debt or Project Bond Credit Enhancement (PBCE) can take the form of a loan from the<lb/> European Investment Bank given to the promoter at the outset. It may also take the form of a contingent credit line<lb/> which can be drawn upon if the revenues generated by the project are not sufficient to ensure senior debt service. The<lb/> PBCE underwrites the senior debt and therefore improves its credit quality by allowing a rating uplift.<lb/> The Greater Gabbard bond issue (2013) was the first in the United Kingdom to use the European Investment<lb/> Bank&apos;s (EIB) credit enhancement initiative. The EIB provided a GBP 45 million guarantee of a total investment of<lb/> GBP 300 million, which helped to pull the rating of the issued bonds up by one notch to A3 by Moody&apos;s. UK-based fund<lb/> managers, mostly on behalf of institutional investors took nearly 80% of the bonds, while insurers and pension funds<lb/> took the remaining.<lb/></p>

			<figure>Box 8. Main policy recommendations to boost infrastructure provision<lb/> Strengthening infrastructure strategy and planning<lb/>  Continue to build on the progress made with the National Infrastructure Plan to further enhance long-term<lb/> infrastructure strategy and planning.<lb/>  Continue to encourage the development by local authorities of up-to-date local plans to make sure<lb/> infrastructure provision is not delayed.<lb/> Policies to ensure sound infrastructure in specific sectors<lb/>  Improve the use of roads by introducing user-paid tolls.<lb/>  Ensure the arms-length responsibility for awarding rail franchises.<lb/>  Take a final decision on how to tackle airport congestion in the South East, after carefully considering the<lb/> recommendation of the Airports Commission, while maintaining strong competitive pressures among<lb/> airports.<lb/>  Evaluate the interaction of the Electricity Market Reform with existing policies to promote renewable<lb/> energies.<lb/></figure>

			<p> Ensure competitive auctions are held to award subsidies for expanding access to digital services in rural<lb/> areas.<lb/></p>

			<head>Improving the financing of infrastructure<lb/></head>

			<p> Increase the number of ready-to-finance projects to attract private investors.<lb/>  Promote the financing of infrastructure by supporting the development of new financial market instruments,<lb/> such as project bonds, and consider granting tax reliefs if needed.<lb/>  Develop further the use of public-private partnerships (PPP) and public guarantees to attract private<lb/> investment into infrastructure and record the associated assets and liabilities in the government fiscal<lb/> accounts. Enhance the provision to investors and the public of comparable data about public guarantees<lb/> and the financial and operational performance of PPP projects.<lb/></p>

			<head></head>

			<figure>Strengthen the use of the UK Guarantee Scheme to support greenfield infrastructure projects. Explore in<lb/> depth the option of using capital recycling to finance greenfield projects and clarify for which projects it could<lb/> be used.<lb/>  Strengthen the Green Investment Bank and other targeted financial aids to further support the<lb/> implementation of not yet commercially viable low-carbon technologies that have the prospect of becoming<lb/> so in the foreseeable future.<lb/>  Support the Pension Infrastructure Platform to overcome the problems caused by the fragmentation of the<lb/> UK pension system and to develop private sector expertise in direct.<lb/> ECO/WKP(2015)62</figure>
