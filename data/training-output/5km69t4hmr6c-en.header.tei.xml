	<div type="abstract">ABSTRACT<lb/> This study analyses linkages between trade and innovation in the chemicals sector, building on past<lb/> work at the OECD on trade and innovation. The chemicals sector has a long history of innovation and is a<lb/> large trading item. It covers very diverse sub-sectors. This paper analyses and compares different trade and<lb/> innovation linkages in basic industrial chemicals, speciality and fine chemicals and consumer chemicals.<lb/> This sector has also been a subject of successive rounds of multilateral trade negotiations, and partly<lb/> as a consequence tariff rates have been reduced over time. Nonetheless remaining tariffs are still<lb/> non-negligible and constitute impediments to trade. Export restrictive measures on raw material inputs are<lb/> also being highlighted on the trade negotiating agenda. Moreover, the chemicals sector is heavily regulated<lb/> for health and environmental reasons and further legislative initiatives have been pursued, whose practical<lb/> impact on innovation remains to be seen. Intellectual property has played a very important role in<lb/> technology diffusion in this sector, and infringement of intellectual property continues to be a major<lb/> problem.<lb/></div>
