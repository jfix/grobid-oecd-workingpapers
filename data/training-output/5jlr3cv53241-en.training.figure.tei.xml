Maintenance standards of federal infrastructure have fallen somewhat over the past 20 years<lb/> (BMVI 2015). However, most transport infrastructure is the responsibility of subnational governments. At<lb/> the municipal level, in particular, infrastructure endowments are likely to have deteriorated more<lb/> substantially.<lb/> 48.<lb/> Additional annual investment needs to maintain transport infrastructure across all levels of<lb/> government are estimated to be between EUR 3.8 billion (Kunert and Link 2013) and EUR 7.2 billion<lb/> (Daehre-Kommission, 2012). The federal government has budgeted additional investment for federal<lb/> transport infrastructure of EUR 5 billion spread over four years (2014-2017). In 2015 the federal<lb/> government announced an additional &quot; future investment &quot; package of EUR 10 billion which includes<lb/> EUR 3.1 billion for transport infrastructure between 2016 and 2018. Additional funding for transport<lb/> infrastructure will come from the extension of the highway toll for heavy goods vehicles to a broader range<lb/> of roads and vehicles.</figDesc>
