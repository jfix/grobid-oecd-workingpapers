			<p>Environmental standards are understood to be sets of rules, guidelines or characteristics<lb/> for products or related processes and production methods with which compliance is not<lb/> legally mandated and, hence, voluntary. They have grown in importance in agriculture and<lb/> agri-food chains as food consumers and societies have expressed increased expectations<lb/> regarding the quality of food products and the environmental performance in their production.<lb/> In addition, food processors and retailers increasingly use standards and certification to ensure<lb/> required quality characteristics along the supply chain as well as for differentiating products<lb/> and segmenting food markets.<lb/> This study examines possible roles of public authorities in the area of environmental and<lb/> organic standards, with the ambition to answer three related questions:<lb/>  What objectives can be pursued by government interaction with environmental and<lb/> organic standards?<lb/>  What options are available to governments for taking a role in environmental and<lb/> organic standards?<lb/>  How can governments make use of environmental and organic standards for achieving<lb/> public policy objectives?<lb/></p>

			<p>This report is based on an extensive literature review, a number of case studies on specific<lb/> environmental and organic standards in different countries, and an OECD-wide survey on<lb/> organic agriculture standards. 1<lb/> A key role of governments in the area of environmental and organic standards is to ensure<lb/> the proper functioning of markets for both food and the certification of food. This in particular<lb/> includes the protection of consumers and the avoidance of excessive transaction costs:<lb/> Protecting consumers and preventing fraud and free-riding by competitors represent a key<lb/> rationale for public authorities for intervening with standards. This goal is pursued mainly<lb/> through the protection of trademarks and brands, the banning of fraudulent or misleading<lb/> claims, or the obligation of private companies to disclose certain information.<lb/> Reducing transaction costs and facilitating market access for all producers also represent<lb/> an important motivation for public intervention. This can be achieved by harmonising existing<lb/> standards, stimulating the creation of standards or developing a public standard.<lb/></p>

			<p>In addition, governments can make use of environmental and organic standards to<lb/> improve efficiency in the design, implementation and monitoring of public policies. This can<lb/> include building regulations on existing private standards; endorsing standards, stimulating<lb/> 1.<lb/> The present report is complemented by its Annexes, available from the OECD website at<lb/> <ref type="biblio">[</ref>www.oecd.org/tad/ntm/voluntary-environmental-standards-in-agriculture-2015-annexes.pdf]. In<lb/> addition to the full survey on organic agriculture standards (Annex 3) and details on the<lb/> individual case studies on environmental standards (Annex 4), it also provides a glossary of<lb/> terms (Annex 1</table>

			<p>) and more detailed information on standards and standard-related government<lb/> interventions (Annex 2).<lb/> the growth of the certified sector, or using standards as an option to comply with regulations;<lb/> and the recognition of private audits and certification for compliance to policy requirements.<lb/></p>

			<p>Costs to taxpayers can be reduced by relying on existing standards or their certification<lb/> systems. Benefits can also include the reduction of farmer transaction costs through reduced<lb/> public monitoring of compliance with policies and regulations. However, there is a potential<lb/> risk to lose control. To mitigate that, it is important to develop procedures to screen private<lb/> standards of the level required for general interest purpose, as well as to maintain mechanisms<lb/> to oversee operators and auditors.<lb/></p>

			<p>Concerning organic agriculture standards, which frequently are seen as a subset of<lb/> environment-related standards, countries have taken different approaches. The choices range<lb/> from largely allowing private standards to self-regulate the market for organic food products<lb/> with intervention mainly limited to exports of domestic produce, to the development of a<lb/> public standard on organic food products. In addition to ensuring well-functioning markets for<lb/> organic food by protecting consumers and facilitating trade, more active intervention by many<lb/> OECD governments also reflects the perceived environmental (and hence societal) benefits of<lb/> organic agriculture and frequently includes specific support provided to the producers of<lb/> certified organic food products.<lb/></p>

			<head>Introduction<lb/></head>

			<p>Voluntary environmental standards have grown in importance in agriculture and agri-food<lb/> chains. 2 Standards may offer opportunities and challenges for producers, companies, and<lb/> governments. For some farmers, they could facilitate access to lucrative markets and supply<lb/> chains, while for others, unable to meet the requirements, they could restrain market access.<lb/> From the perspective of the processors, traders and food retailers, standards and their related<lb/> labels offer opportunities such as quality assurance and product differentiation.<lb/></p>

			<p>There are two main reasons why governments may want to engage with voluntary<lb/> standards. The first reason is to improve the functioning of food markets, particularly by<lb/> protecting consumers from false and misleading claims. The second reason is to achieve other<lb/> public interest objectives by making use of standards in their policy-mix. For instance,<lb/> voluntary standards and their certification systems could reduce the cost to governments of<lb/> carrying out inspections.<lb/></p>

			<p>The present study aims at helping governments to improve their understanding of the<lb/> policy implications of voluntary environmental standards by documenting experiences across<lb/> OECD countries. The first chapter defines some key terms and motivates the choice of<lb/> voluntary environmental standards. Subsequently, it also provides an overview of different<lb/> standards in agriculture, as well as a brief description of their importance in OECD countries.<lb/> The remainder of the report is structured around the two policy questions regarding<lb/> voluntary standards.<lb/> Section 2, &quot; Regulating Standards, &quot; discusses the efficiency rationale for standards, and<lb/> outlines the different policy options for governments in this regard. The emphasis here is on<lb/> making markets work better by resolving information problems. These policy options are<lb/> illustrated using evidence on organic regulations from Member countries.<lb/> Section 3, &quot; Using Standards, &quot; discusses how governments can use standards to implement<lb/> policy objectives other than resolving information problems. The different possible<lb/> interactions are illustrated using selected case studies on environmental policies as well as<lb/> evidence on interactions between standards and policy objectives for organic agriculture in<lb/> Member countries. Section 4 presents conclusions of the study.<lb/> The analysis in this report is based on an extensive review of literature, a survey on<lb/> organic agriculture standards in the OECD and a number of case studies.<lb/></p>

			<p>Based on the framework for the analysis of government involvement with standards, the<lb/> Secretariat conducted an OECD wide survey on organic agriculture. The survey intends to<lb/> highlight the scope for government involvement in the definition, implementation, and<lb/> enforcement of organic standards, as well as the rationale for governmental support to the<lb/> organic certified supply chains to pursue policy interests. The survey covers three topics:<lb/> i) regulations on organic agriculture and foodstuffs, ii) public policies towards organic<lb/> agriculture and food markets, and iii) private organic standards (See the list of questions and<lb/> the full results of the survey in <ref type="biblio">Annex</ref> 3 3 ).<lb/> 2.<lb/> As explained further below, throughout this document the term &quot; standard &quot; is understood to<lb/> denote a set of rules, guidelines or characteristics for products or related processes and<lb/> production methods with which compliance is not legally mandated. As such, using the term<lb/> &quot; voluntary standard &quot; is redundant. However, the term is used differently by various authors. In<lb/> order to improve clarity, this report therefore accepts such redundancies at various places.<lb/> 3.<lb/> The Annexes are available for download from the OECD website at<lb/> www.oecd.org/tad/ntm/voluntary-environmental-standards-in-agriculture-2015-annexes.pdf.<lb/> In addition, eight case studies were undertaken in four countries: France, Korea, the<lb/> Netherlands, and Switzerland. The cases discussed provide insights on the key question<lb/> behind Section 3: how governments can make use of voluntary standards to achieve policy<lb/> objectives in a more cost-effective fashion. The full cases are available in country chapters in<lb/> Annex 4.<lb/></table>

			<head>1.<lb/> Environmental standards in agriculture<lb/></head>

			<p>Based on a literature review, this chapter defines key terms, motivates the choice of<lb/> voluntary environmental standards and provides a brief overview of standards related to<lb/> organic agriculture, quality assurance 4 and &apos;sustainable&apos; agriculture.<lb/></p>

			<head>Key definitions<lb/></head>

			<p>A few key concepts, which have been used frequently and differently in the literature, are<lb/> defined below. These include the terms &apos;voluntary&apos; versus &apos;mandatory&apos;, &apos;standards&apos; versus<lb/> &apos;technical regulations&apos;, and &apos;private&apos; versus &apos;public&apos;. The usual terms used in the context of<lb/> standardisation and certification are provided in a glossary (Annex 1) and the standardisation<lb/> process is discussed in more detail in Annex 2.<lb/></p>

			<head>Voluntary versus mandatory<lb/></head>

			<p>The definitions of the terms &apos;voluntary&apos; and &apos;mandatory&apos; correspond to their common<lb/> understanding, as referred to in dictionaries or other sources, for example in the academic<lb/> literature. More specifically, and following OECD (2011), the following definitions are used:<lb/>  Voluntary: without any legal obligation.<lb/>  Mandatory: required or commanded by authority; obligatory, compulsory.<lb/> <ref type="biblio">Henson (2004)</ref> suggests that all normative documents may be located along a continuum<lb/> characterised by the users&apos; freedom of choice regarding non-compliance. Accordingly, certain<lb/> voluntary standards could be analysed as de facto mandatory standards for market<lb/> participants, when particular sets of specifications gains sufficient market share such that they<lb/> acquire authority or influence. Indeed, historically, public authorities introduced regulations<lb/> and private entities applied voluntary standards. Over time, public authorities also developed<lb/> voluntary standards and private firms with market power have implemented standards that<lb/> became de facto mandatory for other market participants (<ref type="biblio">OECD, 2005</ref>). However, using the<lb/> terms in this &quot; continuous &quot; manner risks losing the clarity of the legal meaning of the words.<lb/> As used in this study, the word mandatory is related to legal binding force.<lb/></p>

			<head>Standards versus technical regulations<lb/></head>

			<p>An important distinction is that between standards and technical regulations. Following<lb/> the WTO Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT) Agreement, the following definitions are used:<lb/>  Standard: Document approved by a recognised body, that provides, for common and<lb/> repeated use, rules, guidelines or characteristics for products or related processes and<lb/> production methods, with which compliance is not mandatory. It may also include or<lb/> deal exclusively with terminology, symbols, packaging, marking or labelling<lb/> 4.<lb/> Quality assurance is the &quot; part of quality management focused on providing confidence that<lb/> quality requirements will be fulfilled &quot; (ISO, 2000). Farm assurance is the application of quality<lb/> assurance principles to pre farm gate operations.<lb/> requirements as they apply to a product, process or production method (WTO, 1995,<lb/> emphasis added).<lb/>  Technical regulation: A technical regulation is a document which lays down product<lb/> characteristics or their related processes and production methods, including the<lb/> applicable administrative provisions, with which compliance is mandatory. It may also<lb/> include or deal exclusively with terminology, symbols, packaging, marking or labelling<lb/> requirements as they apply to a product, process or production method (WTO, 1995,<lb/> emphasis added).<lb/> Following this definition, the two types of normative documents are very similar, possibly<lb/> exactly equal, in terms of contents, but different in the enforcement of requirements. Therefore<lb/> a standard may turn into a technical regulation if made mandatory. As regards to the<lb/> enforcement of the requirements, technical regulations are ultimately enforced by criminal or<lb/> administrative courts, whereas standards are enforced by public and private certifications<lb/> bodies (<ref type="biblio">Henson and Humphrey, 2010</ref>). Their content may originate in the private or public<lb/> sector, but what make regulations different from standards is their enforcement mechanisms.<lb/></p>

			<head>Private versus public<lb/></head>

			<p>The distinction between private and public standards relates to their ownership. The term<lb/> &quot; public standard &quot; defines standards established by governments or public agencies, while all<lb/> others are defined as private standards. Therefore, all technical requirements may be defined<lb/> according to two dimensions, ownership and enforcement (<ref type="table">Table 1</ref>).<lb/> Some standards could evolve as a method to facilitate compliance with related regulations<lb/> and some regulations could refer to standards as their technical requirements. Sometimes,<lb/> widespread standards may become incorporated in regulations. Moreover, governments, non-<lb/>profit organisations and private sectors have been indirectly involved in joint initiatives in<lb/> recent years, for example in the fisheries sector (OECD, 2011). In this way, public standards,<lb/> regulations and private standards operate in parallel, mutually influencing each other.<lb/> Finally, standards established by inter-governmental organisations are an important area<lb/> to look at. They are distinct from private standards because they originate from an agreement<lb/> between governments and they reflect public objectives rather than commercial ones. On the<lb/> other hand, they are also different from governmental standards because inter-governmental<lb/> organisations do not have the enforcing power of governments.<lb/></p>

			<p>The study focuses on voluntary environmental standards in agriculture, including but not<lb/> limited to organic agriculture 5 . Increasing consumer demands for food quality and production<lb/> sustainability are the main drivers of voluntary standards in agriculture. In addition, standards<lb/> and third-party certifications are an important feature of supply chain management, as they<lb/> allow flexibility in procurement while ensuring required quality characteristics along the<lb/> chain (OECD, 2006). Finally, for major agri-food processors and retailers, standards<lb/> contribute to protect brand equity and are part of their social responsibility commitments.<lb/> They allow to respond to new demands from the civil society (<ref type="biblio">Tallontire, 2007</ref>) and to attract<lb/> socially responsible investment (<ref type="biblio">Hartmann, 2011</ref>). Large buyers influence farmers and other<lb/> suppliers upstream in the food chain to adjust to their sustainability requirements. In the end,<lb/> the pressure for the uptake of environmental standards comes from several stakeholders, in<lb/> particular consumers, NGOs, shareholders and financial actors. Environmental standards<lb/> provide a good case to study the policy implications of standards for several reasons. First,<lb/> environmental attributes are increasingly demanded by food consumers (<ref type="biblio">Millock and Nauges,<lb/> 2013</ref>). However, these characteristics are difficult for consumers to assess, leading to possible<lb/> information asymmetry problems. In response, a large number of private voluntary<lb/> environmental standards have emerged alongside public regulations. Countries differ in the<lb/> relative importance of these private voluntary standards and public regulations.<lb/> A second reason for studying environmental standards is that most countries have explicit<lb/> environmental policy objectives. This creates possibilities for using standards as a tool to<lb/> implement policies. For instance, governments could use private standards as a cost-effective<lb/> instrument for promoting sustainable development in agriculture, reducing the negative<lb/> impacts of farming, making more efficient use of natural resources and delivering public<lb/> goods to the society.<lb/> This study pays specific attention to public policies regarding organic agriculture. Organic<lb/> agriculture was chosen for two reasons. First, unlike some other environmental standards<lb/> discussed in the study (e.g. Bonsucro, RSPO, Rainforest Alliance), organic agriculture<lb/> standards are relevant for domestic supply chains and they are important for trade with non-<lb/>OECD countries. Second, the concept of organic agriculture is relatively clearly delineated.<lb/> Unlike some concepts that may be meaningful for some members and not for others<lb/> (e.g. &apos;integrated production&apos;, &apos;conservation agriculture&apos;) or that may be interpreted in different<lb/> ways because of a lack of an agreed definition (e.g. &apos;good agricultural practices&apos;), organic<lb/> agriculture is a mode of production widely recognised within OECD countries (OECD, 2003).<lb/> Moreover, organic agriculture is defined in the FAO-WHO Codex Alimentarius Commission<lb/> (<ref type="biblio">CAC, 1999</ref>) and in several bilateral arrangements for equivalency between country-regulated<lb/> organic standards (e.g. Korea-US, US-Japan, EU-US, Canada-US, Canada-EU, EU-<lb/>Switzerland).<lb/> Governments may take different approaches on environmental standards. They may<lb/> regulate food labelling to avoid misleading or deceptive claims. They may support or promote<lb/> the use of standards through public procurement, subsidising compliance costs, fiscal<lb/> exemptions and other incentives. OECD (2013a) identified twenty-four observed roles of<lb/> governments, from public procurement to regulatory fulfilment, including &quot; soft-hand &quot;<lb/> interventions such as the funding of standardising bodies activities. For other governments,<lb/> voluntary standards remain a private sector matter unrelated to governmental intervention.<lb/></p>

			<head>5</head>

			<table>.<lb/> Note that for some stakeholders, like Canada, organic agriculture standards may not be seen as<lb/> environmental standards. Moreover, the survey of OECD governments shows that several<lb/> member countries are neutral about the environmental benefits of organic agriculture, for<lb/> example Australia and New Zealand (See Annex 3).<lb/></table>

			<p>Studying environmental standards can thus help to understand to what extent and for what<lb/> reasons governments are regulating voluntary standards, supporting the development of<lb/> standards, and eventually making use of existing standards to implement public policies and<lb/> efficiently pursue public interests.<lb/> As the approach of government towards environmental standards in agriculture will<lb/> depend on policy goals, it is not relevant to search for &quot; golden rules &quot; regarding OECD<lb/> countries&apos; involvement with standards. Moreover, the country-specific context matters, such<lb/> as the nature of existing voluntary standards, their stringency and their suitability for<lb/> achieving policy objectives, the level of trust between governmental bodies and the private<lb/> sector (<ref type="biblio">Garcia Martinez et al, 2007</ref>), legal tradition and administrative practices (<ref type="biblio">Humphrey,<lb/> 2012</ref>), as well as historical contingencies and path-dependence.<lb/></p>

			<head>Diversity of environmental standards<lb/></head>

			<p>Environmental standards may be defined as &quot; standards for materials, products and<lb/> production processes to ensure that negative impacts on the environment are minimal or kept<lb/> within certain limits &quot; (<ref type="biblio">Dankers, 2003</ref>). In agriculture as in other sectors, environmental<lb/> standards have different ambitions and promote various processes and production methods to<lb/> promote sustainability.<lb/> Environmentally-friendly practices in agriculture include soil conservation (e.g.,<lb/> conservation tillage, cover crops), water conservation (e.g., buffer areas to minimise non-<lb/>point source pollution), the prohibition of hazardous chemicals, integrated pest management,<lb/> nutrient management (e.g. manure application methods), waste recycling, and the<lb/> maintenance of agro-ecological infrastructures for biodiversity. Moreover, different holistic<lb/> approaches intend to integrate several individual practices into production systems, in order to<lb/> benefit from complementarities in the agro-ecological system, while achieving other<lb/> objectives, such as improvement in animal welfare. Among those, &apos;organic agriculture&apos;,<lb/> &apos;biodynamic agriculture&apos;, and &apos;integrated production&apos; have been heavily formalised into<lb/> voluntary standards.<lb/> Environmental standards may cover a wide spectrum of criteria or favour specific topics.<lb/> According to the last standard benchmark published in the State of Sustainability Initiatives<lb/> (SSI), the IFOAM organic standard has a comprehensive coverage in all areas of reporting<lb/> except one, greenhouse gas. Conversely, the Roundtable on Sustainable Biomaterials (RSB) 6<lb/> appears to be the most comprehensive standard for greenhouse gas reduction, but it is weaker<lb/> in other areas, e.g. the use of synthetic inputs and biodiversity. Fairtrade (FLO), a standard<lb/> developed initially to promote social equity, has incorporated several environmental<lb/> requirements, but its coverage of environmental issues remains &quot; average &quot; in most areas (SSI,<lb/> 2014). In addition to coverage, standards have different provisions and criteria to be fulfilled,<lb/> which make them difficult to benchmark in practice.<lb/></p>

			<p>There are different ways to classify environmental standards in agriculture, through their<lb/> channel (Business to Business, Business to Consumer), their product or geographical scope,<lb/> their communication content (when a label or any other information is involved, i.e. &apos;natural&apos;,<lb/> &apos;organic&apos;, &apos;sustainable&apos;), or even according to leadership in their development and promotion<lb/> (government, retailers, farmers, conservation NGOs, etc.) (<ref type="biblio">OECD, 2013a</ref>). For the sake of<lb/> convenience, the numerous product and production method standards related to environment<lb/> are grouped into three categories that reflect successive generations of initiatives: organic<lb/> agriculture standards, farm assurance standards, and commodity sustainability standards.<lb/> 6.<lb/> Previously known as the Roundtable on Sustainable Biofuels. The RSB expanded its scope in<lb/> 2013 to cover biomaterials.<lb/></p>

			<head>Organic agriculture standards<lb/></head>

			<p>Organic agriculture standards relate to processes and production methods based on the<lb/> principles of &quot; organic agriculture &quot; , defined by the FAO as &quot; a holistic production management<lb/> system which promotes and enhances agro-ecosystem health, including biodiversity,<lb/> biological cycles, and soil biological activity &quot; (See Glossary of organic agriculture, FAO,<lb/> 2009). Other definitions of organic agriculture (e.g. from IFAOM and several private standard<lb/> setters) include social and ethical issues, for example fair labour practices. Organic standards<lb/> are developed by a diversity of stakeholders, including farmer and consumer associations,<lb/> charities, certification bodies and governments. Organic standards aim at differentiating<lb/> products and segmenting markets, with environmental claims transmitted to households<lb/> through a food label.<lb/></p>

			<figure>The market for organic food and drinks was worth USD 63 billion in 2011. It has<lb/> expanded by 170% since 2002 (FiBL/IFOAM, 2013). Demand for organic products comes<lb/> mainly from North America and Europe, together with more than 90% of retail sales. The<lb/> United States, Germany and France are the three countries with the largest organic consumer<lb/> markets. Higher per capita consumption is found in Switzerland (USD 250 per capita per<lb/> year), Denmark (USD 226) and Luxembourg (USD 187).<lb/> In terms of production, estimates of agricultural land under organic production worldwide<lb/> in 2011, including land in-conversion, vary between 29.9 million (FAOSTAT) and<lb/> 37.2 million hectares (FiBL/IFOAM, 2013) (Table 2). According to the OECD Compendium<lb/> of Agri-environmental Indicators (OECD, 2013b), the OECD area represents 24.7 million ha<lb/> of agricultural land area under certified organic management in 2010. The OECD area<lb/> accounts for the majority of organic production and organic food consumption.<lb/> According to the FiBL/IFOAM survey, in 2013, 86 countries implemented regulations on<lb/> organic agriculture and foodstuffs, and 26 are in the process of drafting legislation. The<lb/> survey carried out by the Secretariat confirms that all OECD member countries have<lb/> implemented some official programme as regard to organic agriculture, although the approach<lb/> towards regulation differs from one country to another (See Annex 3). This is also the case of<lb/> most emerging economies: Argentina, Brazil, the People&apos;s Republic of China, India and<lb/> Indonesia. The Russian Federation and South Africa are in the process of drafting<lb/> legislation (FiBL/IFOAM, 2013).<lb/></figure>

			<p>Organic regulations generally require the use of a governmental standard to claim<lb/> &quot; organic &quot; , the standard being directly incorporated into the legislation (as in the European<lb/> Union) or referred to in the regulations (as in Canada). Compliance with the standard is only<lb/> mandatory if the producer chooses to label a product as organic (<ref type="biblio">Dankers, 2003</ref>). It is not<lb/> mandatory to farm. Moreover, for compound products, regulations require a minimal<lb/> percentage of organic ingredients.<lb/></p>

			<p>Private organic standards have been developed decades before governmental regulations,<lb/> and public standards are often originated from private standards. The Demeter biodynamic<lb/> label and the first standards have been introduced in Germany as early as 1928. The Soil<lb/> Association, a British charity founded in 1946 published its first standards in 1967. IFOAM, a<lb/> non-governmental organisation founded in 1972 published their basic standards in 1980<lb/> (<ref type="biblio">Dankers, 2003</ref>). Private standards are active in many OECD countries and are significant<lb/> (more than 20% of organic farms) in Austria, Ireland, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Sweden<lb/> and Switzerland. In most cases, they include more requirements than national regulations. For<lb/> example, in Member States of the European Union, they often emphasise the provenance of<lb/> materials and animals used in farm production. They also extend to non-agricultural activities<lb/> such as aquaculture, woodland and health and beauty products (<ref type="biblio">Gibbon, 2008</ref>).<lb/> As regards to organic food imported from developing countries, a trend is the double<lb/> certification as organic and compliant with the standard of Fairtrade International (FLO), for<lb/> example most of the fair-trade coffee sold in the United States is also organic. Private organic<lb/> standards have also directly incorporated fair-trade requirements in their criteria. In France,<lb/> the Bioéquitable label is based on organic rules and on Ecocert ESR, a fair-trade standard<lb/> developed by an organic certification body.<lb/></p>

			<head>Farm assurance standards<lb/></head>

			<p>Alongside the significant growth of organic farming, a new category of private standards<lb/> has expanded since the 1990s. Farm assurance standards are third-party accredited standards,<lb/> which are covering environmental as well as non-environmental criteria, mainly hygiene and<lb/> product traceability. Farm assurance standards are based on good agricultural practices (GAP)<lb/> and the application of Hazard Analysis at Critical Control Points (HACCP) to primary<lb/> production, for pre-farm gate operations. They are also referred as farm assurance schemes or<lb/> &quot; GAP standards &quot; .<lb/></p>

			<figure>GLOBALGAP is an initiative from the food industry, founded as EurepGAP in 1997 by<lb/> the Euro-Retailer Produce Working Group (EUREP). The association declares a substantial<lb/> number of certified producers worldwide: 123 115 in December 2012 (of which 75% in<lb/> Europe), up from around 35 000 in 2005 (FoodPLUS, 2012). Launched by the National<lb/> Farmers&apos; Union, Assured Food Standards (AFS) is the largest farm assurance standard in the<lb/> United Kingdom with about 78 000 certified farms; the &quot; Red Tractor &quot; certification covers<lb/> food safety, animal welfare and to a lesser extent environmental matters. More than 10 000<lb/> producers worldwide are certified under the Nurture scheme developed by UK retailer Tesco<lb/> (Cox, 2007). In France, there were 25 892 producers engaged in retailer Carrefour&apos;s Quality<lb/> Line certification by the end of 2011.<lb/></figure>

			<p>governance of the standard aiming at promoting dialog, best practices, transparency and<lb/> inclusiveness. Standard setting is organised through constituent groups or chambers, with a<lb/> number of seats for each category of stakeholder, e.g. farmers, processors, right-based NGOs,<lb/> environmental NGOs, smallholder farmer organisations, certification bodies. However, while<lb/> some authors argue that these initiatives are a democratic answer to sustainability challenges,<lb/> others point to asymmetries and privileged access of &quot; powerful &quot; stakeholders such as buyers<lb/> from the North (<ref type="biblio">Cheyns, 2011; Schouten et al., 2012</ref>).<lb/> The commodity sustainability standards are implemented in developing and emerging<lb/> countries, with regional dominance: Africa for UTZ and Rainforest Alliance, Africa and Latin<lb/> America for Fairtrade, Asia for RSPO, and South America for Bonsucro and RTRS (<ref type="table">Table 3</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<head>2.<lb/> Making markets work better: Policy options for interacting with voluntary standards<lb/></head>

			<p>For many product attributes, including environmental aspects, consumers are unable to<lb/> evaluate the claims made by producers either before or after consuming the product. The<lb/> existence of these so-called &quot; credence &quot; characteristics leads to an &quot; adverse selection &quot;<lb/> problem, where consumers distrust such claims and are unwilling to pay the premium which<lb/> would be necessary to compensate producers for the extra production costs. 7<lb/></p>

			<p>Given these information problems and market failures, an important policy question is to<lb/> what extent the provision of desirable attributes can be achieved using private initiatives, and<lb/> when public initiatives are useful or necessary. This chapter discusses the available policy<lb/> options. Throughout the chapter, reference is made to the results of a survey on organic<lb/> agriculture standards in the OECD (see Annex 3).<lb/> 7.<lb/> See Annex 2 for a more extensive discussion of how information problems affect the functioning<lb/> of markets and for an overview of private and public initiatives in addition to the standards-<lb/>related initiatives discussed in this chapter.<lb/></p>

			<head>Regulation of information provision<lb/></head>

			<p>An important distinction is whether a credence attribute is a &apos;good&apos; or a &apos;bad&apos;, i.e. an<lb/> attribute consumers desire in their product (e.g. fair trade) or an attribute consumers wish to<lb/> avoid (e.g. pesticides). In the absence of government initiatives, producers might falsely<lb/> advertise desirable credence attributes or neglect to inform consumers about undesirable<lb/> credence attributes of the product. The appropriate government policy depends on whether the<lb/> credence attributes are desirable or not. Governments want to induce private actors to give<lb/> accurate information about undesirable credence attributes, and prevent them from giving<lb/> false impressions about desirable credence attributes.<lb/></p>

			<head>Mandatory disclosure<lb/></head>

			<p>For credence attributes which are not desirable for the consumer (e.g. the presence of<lb/> pesticides), the producer has an incentive to withhold this information. To overcome this<lb/> problem, governments could mandate the disclosure of certain types of information (<ref type="biblio">Caswell<lb/> and Mojduszka, 1996</ref>). A well-known example is mandatory disclosure of nutritional<lb/> information (on calories, fats, proteins, etc.) in a standardised format.<lb/></p>

			<head>Regulating positive claims<lb/></head>

			<p>For desirable credence attributes, the government will often ban misleading or false<lb/> advertising. Consumer protection authorities regulate labelling claims and advertisement<lb/> under laws prohibiting unsubstantial and misleading claims (e.g. claims which could create<lb/> confusion among consumers) about product and process properties. The general principle is<lb/> enumerated in Codex Alimentarius: &quot; Food should not be described or presented in a manner<lb/> that is false, misleading or deceptive or is likely to create an erroneous impression regarding<lb/> its character in any respect &quot; (CAC, 1979).<lb/></p>

			<head>Protecting market integrity<lb/></head>

			<p>Another possible problem with private information provision is that such claims may have<lb/> negative spillover effects on other sellers. For instance, emphasizing that a product contains<lb/> no toxic ingredients may give the false impression that products from competing firms do<lb/> contain those toxic ingredients. Such a labelling strategy would give a competitive advantage<lb/> to one firm but it would undermine the confidence of the buyer in the market as a whole.<lb/></p>

			<p>For this reason, food claims are regulated not only to protect consumers, but also to avoid<lb/> such negative spillovers. For instance, most governments do not accept food safety claims<lb/> from commercial operators. Market differentiation based on food safety is considered both<lb/> illegitimate and inefficient since there is a risk of undermining the credibility of public<lb/> sanitary regulations and, by extension, of the whole food market. Likewise, Codex<lb/> Alimentarius formally discourages &quot; claims which could give rise to doubt about the safety of<lb/> similar food or which could arouse or exploit fear in the consumer &quot; (CAC, 1979). Health<lb/> claims are also regulated by several governments.<lb/></p>

			<p>Product differentiation based on environmental characteristics or performance has been<lb/> considered less sensitive by governments, but one may find a similar risk of eroding public<lb/> confidence in food from conventional agriculture. Moreover, the proliferation of &quot; green<lb/> washing &quot; (the practice of using environmental claims based on standards barely above<lb/> minimal legal requirements) may also confuse consumers and undermine the credibility of<lb/> existing standards.<lb/></p>

			<head>Labels and standards<lb/></head>

			<p>For some attributes, a ban on misleading advertising in turn leads to two related problems,<lb/> i.e. how certain descriptions or claims should be defined, and how these can be verified. A law<lb/> against misleading advertising does not by itself solve the problem that a concept like<lb/> &quot; organic &quot; can be defined differently by different sellers. Moreover, even with a clear<lb/> definition and a law prohibiting false advertising it might be difficult for buyers or<lb/> competitors to verify whether sellers violated the law or not. Hence, for some attributes,<lb/> regulation against false advertising is not sufficient.<lb/> One solution to this problem is the use of labels and standards. A third party (private or<lb/> public) can establish a set of requirements and verify that a seller satisfies the requirements.<lb/> The seller could then be awarded a label which can be displayed on the product. If the label is<lb/> accurate, this transforms the credence attribute into a &quot; search &quot; attribute, since buyers can<lb/> simply look for the label when buying the good (<ref type="biblio">Caswell and Mojduszka 1996</ref>). Standards<lb/> and labels may thus solve information problems to a large extent. The label communicates to<lb/> consumers that a product has the desired characteristics.<lb/></p>

			<p>The use of labels and standards involves a number of policy decisions (<ref type="biblio">Roe and Sheldon,<lb/> 2007</ref>). An important question is whether standard-setting and certification should happen<lb/> under the authority of a government agency or through a private firm. It is important to note<lb/> here that setting a standard and certifying that a certain seller satisfies the criteria are in<lb/> principle two separate activities which could be undertaken by separate bodies, whether<lb/> public or private. For instance, both the process of standard-setting and certifying could be<lb/> left to the public sector. The standard could also be defined by the government, with<lb/> certification by private bodies. Conversely, government agencies could certify private<lb/> standards, e.g. as USDA is increasingly asked to do (<ref type="biblio">Clayton and Preston, 2003</ref>).<lb/> Alternatively, a private company or organisation could define a certain standard, and the same<lb/> or another private body could certify that a seller satisfies the criteria of the standard.<lb/></p>

			<head>Public or private standards?<lb/></head>

			<p>For the case of organic food, the survey of OECD countries shows that all member<lb/> countries except New Zealand and Australia have public organic standards incorporated into<lb/> regulations. In New Zealand, there is no specific legal framework for products sold on the<lb/> domestic market, but the government administers a voluntary programme for exports. In<lb/> Australia, the organic legislation only applies to exported production, in reference to a<lb/> standard maintained by the industry.<lb/></p>

			<p>The survey confirms that market issues have been the main spur for developing public<lb/> organic standards embedded in regulations. The protection of consumers from false claims is<lb/> the most frequently quoted motivation for organic regulations.<lb/> A question which may arise is whether, in addition to a government-backed label, other<lb/> labels will be allowed as well. For instance, in the United States all organic food certification<lb/> is overseen by the USDA, and private firms may not establish alternative definitions.<lb/> According to the findings of the survey, private organic standards co-exist with public<lb/> standards in 23 OECD countries on the 33 surveyed. 8 Although reliable and comparable<lb/> statistics on the importance of private standards are not available for all countries, private<lb/> organic standards appear to be significant in Austria (60% of organic farms), Ireland (99%),<lb/> Luxembourg (58%), the Netherlands (27%), Sweden (79%) and Switzerland (95%).<lb/> 8.<lb/> The definition of private standards includes those developed by NGOs, private certifiers and<lb/> other for-profit companies, as well as those developed by officially recognised non-<lb/>governmental standardising bodies.<lb/></p>

			<p>Moreover, as there is no country-regulated standard for the domestic market in Australia and<lb/> New Zealand, all certified organic farmers producing for the domestic market are certified<lb/> according to private standards. 9<lb/></p>

			<head>Benefits and disadvantages of private relative to public standards<lb/></head>

			<p>As part of their answers to the survey, some member countries have pointed out the<lb/> benefits and drawbacks of having coexisting organic regulations and private organic standards<lb/> operating in the country.<lb/> A first benefit is the possibility of product differentiation. In most OECD countries,<lb/> private standards have to comply with the legal minimum set in regulations. This means that<lb/> there are opportunities for standards higher than the country-regulated standard. For example,<lb/> the private standards that operate in Ireland set higher requirements than Council Regulation<lb/> (EC) No. 834/2007. This higher standard provides an added extra and is attractive for export<lb/> of products to continental Europe. Moreover, private standards provide additional benefits in<lb/> the market due to the standard owner&apos;s stance on specific issues such as for example animal<lb/> welfare and bio-dynamic agriculture. Some private organic standards also certify the origin of<lb/> products (e.g. Slovenia, Switzerland), which is valued by domestic and foreign consumers.<lb/> With private standards, organic producers have access to different marketing channels<lb/> through which they can singularise their products.<lb/> A second benefit mentioned by respondents was that owners of private standards may<lb/> invest in building and maintaining strong brand value, which in turn increase confidence<lb/> amongst consumers. For example, in Sweden, KRAV has been very successful in marketing<lb/> organic products. With private standards, control may be more diverse and deeper, which<lb/> yields more trust in &apos;organic&apos; claims for consumers. Finally, private standards are perceived to<lb/> bring innovation in the organic sector. If there is a need from a governmental perspective,<lb/> some requirements of private standards may be implemented into organic regulations in<lb/> further stages. Indeed, national regulations have been influenced by private organic standards<lb/> in several OECD countries.<lb/></p>

			<p>The main drawback of private organic standards is the possibility of confusion amongst<lb/> consumers as to the dividing line between the standard and the country regulation. In the<lb/> European Union, where coexistence is allowed, it is not obvious if consumers are always<lb/> aware of the differences between the two. Moreover, certification bodies often propose their<lb/> own private standard; they are in competition with each other over what their respective<lb/> versions of the standards offer to producers.<lb/></p>

			<head>Certification<lb/></head>

			<p>In terms of certification according to organic regulations, 10 there is much more<lb/> heterogeneity among OECD members. 22 of the 33 OECD countries surveyed use private<lb/> 9.<lb/> Note that farmers producing organic products for the New Zealand or Australian domestic<lb/> market need not to be certified. However, as it is the case elsewhere, the legislation in place in<lb/> both these countries prevents market participants from making false claims on the marketed<lb/> food. Organic products sold on the New Zealand domestic market are sold subject to the Fair<lb/> Trading Act, which requires truth in labelling. Organic certification provides some assurance to<lb/> retailers and manufacturers that an organic claim complies with the provisions of the Fair<lb/> Trading Act. In Australia, according to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission,<lb/> organic claims must be properly made and businesses that make organic claims must be able to<lb/> substantiate those claims.<lb/> certifiers. Public control bodies are used in Denmark, Estonia and Finland, while both systems<lb/> co-exist in Korea, Japan, Poland, Spain and the United States. In addition, Norway and the<lb/> Netherlands have a system whereby a private certifier has a monopoly on certification, with a<lb/> formal agreement in place. Mexico traditionally relied on a participatory guarantee system,<lb/> whereby organic farmers are subject to the monitoring and review among peers, involving<lb/> organic consumers and technical consultants in regional networks; at the moment a process is<lb/> underway to recognise private certifiers.<lb/></p>

			<head>Benefits and disadvantages of private relative to public certification<lb/></head>

			<p>Among the mentioned benefits of using private certifiers is the choice offered to organic<lb/> producers. Competition between certifiers can promote better value for organic producers. It<lb/> forces certifiers to make their work as effective as possible.<lb/> Moreover, private certifiers&apos; personnel are dedicated organic specialists whose function is<lb/> to ensure conformity with organic farming and production standards. They have the expertise<lb/> to certify to organic standards. Private certifiers are more specialised than public control<lb/> bodies, which have to cover a wider range of standards. They can assure a higher efficiency<lb/> compared to public structures. For operators they provide fast inspection and certification<lb/> procedures and objectivity and less complicated administration than in governmental<lb/> administration.<lb/></p>

			<p>Private certifiers often work in close collaboration with organic operators, enabling<lb/> trusted and long-standing relationships to develop.<lb/> Regarding conformity assessment, the private certifier can check conformity concerning<lb/> other international trademarks and standards as well (See cases of the Netherlands and<lb/> Switzerland in Annex 4). As private certifiers often propose their own private standards, the<lb/> system allows for the coexistence of national regulations and private standards; the first<lb/> providing a minimum standard and the latter providing the opportunity for market<lb/> diversification of organic products.<lb/> Having private certifiers carry out conformity assessment allows for a &quot; user-pays &quot;<lb/> approach to organic certification. The financial burden on governments is lower than when<lb/> undertaking an inspection role. Some countries interviewed pointed to a lack of human<lb/> resources and budget to maintain a public control body, so that certification has to be<lb/> outsourced.<lb/></p>

			<p>In turn, according to the answers from several OECD member countries, the inspectors<lb/> from public bodies are regarded as independent and impartial by organic producers.<lb/> Certification fees of public bodies are generally lower than those of private certifiers. The<lb/> implementation of the standards is similar for all producers. With a government-managed<lb/> system, the credibility of organic claims to consumer is high.<lb/></p>

			<p>In countries where private and public bodies are coexisting, certification fees of private<lb/> certifiers are generally higher than that of public agencies. Some countries stated that organic<lb/> certification is expensive and certification costs are passed on to consumers, making organic<lb/> products less accessible to a wider part of the population. Moreover, high fees make it more<lb/> difficult to attract new organic producers in the system. In addition, certifiers may promote<lb/> their own private standard rather than simply offering the official certification scheme.<lb/></p>

			<figure>10.<lb/> In Australia, for compliance with the National Standard for Organic and Bio-Dynamic Produce<lb/> (Export Control Orders 2005), in New Zealand for compliance with the Official Organic<lb/> Assurance Programme (OOAP) for exports.<lb/></figure>

			<p>With private certifiers, it is difficult to ensure consistent delivery in conformity<lb/> assessment. It is not always possible to have agreed best-practice, as due to commercial<lb/> interests they are not always keen to agree to a standardised approach. Private control bodies<lb/> may have their own procedures that make it harder for producers to change the body swiftly.<lb/> When the number of certifiers becomes high, this results in major difficulties in supervision<lb/> for the Competent Authority responsible for the implementation of organic regulations.<lb/> As there is an economic pressure on private certifiers, competition can lead to dumping. If<lb/> no unified system of controls and sanctions is in place, there is a greater chance for fraud and<lb/> false certificates. In case a violation of standards is detected by a private certifier, operators<lb/> could put pressure on the private certifier threatening to move to a competitor.<lb/></p>

			<p>In some countries, consumers of organic food have less confidence in the inspection by<lb/> private bodies. Private certifiers may have less credibility internationally than government<lb/> authorities. Gaining market access to other countries may then be more difficult for private<lb/> certifiers.<lb/></p>

			<p>With a delegation of conformity assessment to the private sector, there is a potential loss<lb/> of control in the enforcement of regulations. However, the Competent Authority is<lb/> responsible for overseeing the operation and thus providing a guarantee to consumers. It is<lb/> also in charge of coordinating the control bodies to avoid disparities in procedures and<lb/> sanctions.<lb/></p>

			<head>Policy interactions with voluntary standards<lb/></head>

			<p>There are a number of problems which may arise if standard-setting and certification are<lb/> left to private organisations. These in turn create scope for government policies to improve<lb/> upon the market outcome.<lb/></p>

			<p>A first problem is the credibility of the private initiative, both in terms of the credibility of<lb/> the standard and of the certification procedures. A second problem with relying solely on<lb/> private initiatives is the risk of ending up with no standard at all, or by contrast with a wide<lb/> variety of incompatible standards leading to high transaction costs for market participants.<lb/> These shortcomings suggest a role for public initiatives. In particular, governments can<lb/> increase the credibility of private standards and labels; increase the credibility of third-party<lb/> certification; stimulate the creation of private standards; and foster market integration by<lb/> harmonising existing standards.<lb/></p>

			<head>Increasing the credibility of private labels and standards<lb/></head>

			<p>A first issue with private standards and labels is that such schemes will only be as credible<lb/> as the body setting the standard. A supplier may rely on a third-party organisation for<lb/> standard-setting but without oversight, there is no guarantee that this organisation will keep its<lb/> integrity. NGOs play an important role as &quot; gate-keeper &quot; , in the development, the rating and<lb/> the benchmarking of private standards.<lb/> As neutral third-parties, governments may play a similar role in providing credibility to<lb/> voluntary standards. Their involvement includes encouraging transparency in standard setting,<lb/> ensuring that the process is fair and inclusive, and representing the voice of citizens within<lb/> standardising committees (UNFSS, 2013). Governmental experts and scientists provide<lb/> guidance to build scientifically sound criteria in working groups.<lb/> Public investments in data and research can also play a role in supporting the<lb/> development and verification of private environmental standards. Improved scientific<lb/> knowledge on agricultural sustainability, science-based environmental indicators, data on the<lb/> state of agriculture and the environment, and the dissemination of such information, can help<lb/></p>

			<p>Another way by which governments may give credibility to industry initiatives is through<lb/> the official approval of private standards and certifications, with a governmental seal, by<lb/> reference to the private standards in public procurement guidelines, or with communication<lb/> campaigns to increase consumer awareness. Finally, the development of a public voluntary<lb/> standard (as often in the case of organic agriculture) can be analysed as a borderline case,<lb/> were national authorities are taking full responsibility for standard development and the<lb/> management of related information scheme, in order to grant the highest credibility to the<lb/> industry initiative.<lb/> Generally, interactions with private standards in OECD countries seem to be limited.<lb/> Only seven countries report to be involved to some extent: Australia, Germany, Hungary,<lb/> Ireland, New Zealand, Norway and Switzerland. Government officials may be invited to<lb/> comment on standard drafts and to provide guidance through round-table discussions or<lb/> similar meetings. They may also act as experts in standard-setting committees. In Hungary,<lb/> private organic standards have to be approved by the authorities. The main motivations for<lb/> interacting with private bodies are to make sure standard-setting is transparent, fair and<lb/> inclusive, and compatible with governmental objectives. Conversely, no OECD government is<lb/> funding the activity of private organic standardising bodies.<lb/> In Australia, the Australian Government is represented on the committee overseeing the<lb/> Australian Standard for Organic and Biodynamic Products (AS6000-2009) developed under<lb/> the auspices of Standards Australia, the main standardising body in the country. This standard<lb/> is available for use by private certifiers. 11<lb/></p>

			<p>In 2003 Standards New Zealand published a standard for organic production (NZS8410-<lb/>2003). The standard was developed in consultation with staff from NZFSA (New Zealand<lb/> Food Safety Authority), and from 23 other organisations with an interest in organics. The<lb/> standard sets out minimum requirements for the production, handling, processing and<lb/> labelling of organic products including plant and plant products, and animal and animal<lb/> products. This standard is used by a number of organisations as a reference document,<lb/> including the New Zealand Qualifications Authority and the Commerce Commission.<lb/></p>

			<head>Increasing the credibility of third-party certification<lb/></head>

			<p>An important question regarding third-party certification is the reliability of the certifier.<lb/> Without external control by accreditation bodies and standard owners, the reliability of third-<lb/>party certification may be doubted, as consumers are unable to verify the integrity of the<lb/> certifier or the thoroughness with which the certifier screens producers.<lb/> From the point of view of the certifier, four factors determine the optimal amount of<lb/> inspection to be carried out (<ref type="biblio">Jahn et al., 2005</ref>). Increasing the quality of inspections would<lb/> lead to greater direct costs (e.g. due to higher labour costs), together with a higher opportunity<lb/> cost of losing the producer as a client. On the other hand, reducing the quality of inspections<lb/> would increase the risk of a loss of reputation for the certifier, or of costs due to liability. This<lb/> suggests four ways of improving or guaranteeing the quality of third-party certification (<ref type="biblio">Jahn<lb/> et al., 2005</ref>).<lb/> First, alternative ways of organising inspections might reduce the direct costs of offering a<lb/> good quality of inspection. One way of reducing costs is to move towards a risk-based<lb/> inspection system. As shown by <ref type="biblio">Gambelli et al. (2014)</ref>, the risk of violating the requirements<lb/> of organic farming can be predicted by previous non-compliance, as well as by</p>

			<table>farm size and<lb/> 11.<lb/> It is a different standard than the National Standard for Organic and Bio-Dynamic Produce used<lb/> to certify production for export markets.<lb/> VOLUNTARY ENVIRONMENTAL AND ORGANIC STANDARDS IN AGRICULTURE: POLICY IMPLICATIONS – 21<lb/> OECD FOOD, AGRICULTURE AND FISHERIES PAPER N°86 © OECD 2015<lb/> complexity of operations. However, the data currently recorded by control bodies are<lb/> insufficient to implement an effective risk-based approach.<lb/></table>

			<p>Second, the risk of losing the producer as a client could be reduced in several ways. One<lb/> approach is to grant a monopoly to a single certification body, removing the possibility for<lb/> producers to engage in &quot; opinion shopping &quot; to select the most lenient certifier (<ref type="biblio">Lennox, 2000</ref>).<lb/> Another solution is to prohibit certifiers to take on clients representing a large share of their<lb/> revenues, to prevent the certifier from becoming too dependent upon a large client (who could<lb/> subsequently exert pressure). Other solutions are a forced rotation of certifiers or forced long-<lb/>term contracts.<lb/></p>

			<p>Third, increasing the potential reputation loss for certifiers would also improve the quality<lb/> of third-party certification. As <ref type="biblio">Jahn et al. (2005)</ref> note, at present buyers have only limited<lb/> information about the performance of certifiers. One solution might be to publish rankings<lb/> based on detected fraud by different certifiers.<lb/></p>

			<figure>Fourth, increasing liability costs for the certifier in case of fraud would provide another<lb/> way to guarantee the quality of third-party certification. Jahn et al. (2005) note that this can<lb/> happen by increasing the probability of fraud detection, increasing the probability of liability,<lb/> and increasing the costs or fines in case of liability.<lb/></figure>

			<p>In the countries where private certifiers are officially recognised as control bodies for<lb/> public organic standards, a system has been implemented for the surveillance of their<lb/> operations. The degree of comprehensiveness of this oversight varies from one country to<lb/> another.<lb/> In the European Union, according to Council Regulation (EC) 834/2007 it is mandatory<lb/> for the Competent Authorities to develop a programme of surveillance to supervise and<lb/> monitor control bodies, with office audits of control bodies and witness audits of certified<lb/> organic operators. Control bodies are submitted to a double control, from the Competent<lb/> Authority (audit once a year) and from the accreditation body (audit every 15 months). The<lb/> surveillance of control bodies is also mandatory for countries that have bilateral agreements<lb/> with the EU (<ref type="biblio">Sanders, 2014</ref>).<lb/> The authorities responsible for overseeing control bodies are generally the same as the<lb/> Competent Authority. Before being recognised by the authority, and regardless of whether<lb/> they provide conformity assessment to country-regulated organic standards only, or to other<lb/> agricultural standards as well, private certifiers have to show that they are competent and<lb/> reliable when they operate product certification. This is usually done through a formal<lb/> accreditation according to ISO/IEC Guide 65 (General requirements for bodies operating<lb/> product certification systems), EN 45011 (General Criteria for Certification Bodies Operating<lb/> Product Certification Systems) or equivalent.<lb/></p>

			<head>Stimulating the creation of private standards<lb/></head>

			<p>If the process of defining and implementing a standard is costly and complicated for<lb/> private operators, it may not get undertaken at all. There is thus a problem of &quot; collective<lb/> action &quot; in standard setting. While business operators share collective goals, they may disagree<lb/> on the way to proceed. There may be conflicting views on best practices, key criteria and<lb/> performance thresholds, which result in a lack of consensus and persistence of the status quo.<lb/> Moreover, even if they collectively benefit from a standard, businesses have little incentive<lb/> individually and face transaction costs in engaging in standard development.<lb/> A government may therefore act as an enabling institution that provides institutional<lb/> infrastructure and guidance, exerting pressure to push negotiations to reach solutions. It may<lb/> also act as an &quot; enforcing institution &quot; with the threat to develop a public standard, embedded in<lb/> law, to overcome the status quo. In doing so, governments influence the agenda of standard<lb/> setters (Ponte, 2014).<lb/> At least with regard to organic standards, such initiatives seem to be limited. In the survey<lb/> on organic regulations and policies, no examples of governments supporting private standard<lb/> setters in this way were identified.<lb/></p>

			<p>When relying solely on private actors to develop standards, the opposite problem may<lb/> also arise: a wide variety of different standards and labels may emerge in the market. While in<lb/> theory competition between standards could lead to the emergence of a limited number of<lb/> dominant labels in the market, this process might take time. The co-existence of similarly-<lb/>sounding standards can lead to confusion among buyers and to higher transaction costs for<lb/> suppliers who have to deal with a variety of requirements. Moreover, if different countries<lb/> implement different standards, this may hamper trade.<lb/> To avoid confusion among buyers, to reduce transaction costs for suppliers, and to<lb/> facilitate trade, the government may wish to reduce these transaction costs by harmonising the<lb/> standards used in the market. One way to do this is for the government to set its own standard.<lb/> However, there are several other possibilities. For instance, the government could select one<lb/> existing private standard as the official standard, subsidise or otherwise stimulate one private<lb/> standard but not others, or strongly encourage the harmonisation of private standards.<lb/></p>

			<figure>Standard harmonisation alleviates barriers to trade and facilitates market access for<lb/> producers. In the United States, in 1990, the US Congress passed the Organic Food Protection<lb/> Act to facilitate interstate commerce in organically produced food. The USDA National<lb/> Organic Program (NOP) standards published in 2002 had an explicit goal of removing<lb/> variation amongst different organic certifications and State laws on organic labelling<lb/> (Schewe, 2011). In the European Union, Council Regulation (EEC) 2092/91 has been<lb/> implemented to harmonise existing national standards and facilitate market integration. The<lb/> revision of the EU regulation in 2005-2007 aimed at strengthening the common framework,<lb/> after a proliferation of derogations and divergent Member States&apos; interpretation of rules<lb/> (<ref type="biblio">Gibbon, 2008</ref>). In the United States and the EU, harmonisation has been achieved through a<lb/> public standard. In Switzerland, the Federal government pushed local organic associations to<lb/> create a common private standard in the early 1980s, Bio Suisse, to improve market<lb/> transparency, increase the integrity of value chains, and protect Swiss consumers. A national<lb/> legislation has been introduced much later in 1997 (Annex 4).<lb/> For several countries, market issues have been the main spur of regulations. A better<lb/> integration of the domestic market and better access to foreign markets were cited by 9 out of<lb/> 14 countries (taking the EU as a single country) as a motivation for developing organic<lb/> regulation, making it the second most important reason (after consumer protection). In Iceland<lb/> and Switzerland, organic regulations have been strongly motivated by the prospects of trade<lb/> integration with the European Union (i.e. AEEA Agreement, EU-Switzerland bilateral<lb/> agreement).<lb/></p>

			<head>Potential drawbacks to government intervention<lb/></head>

			<p>Multiple coexisting standards may not necessarily be a sign of market dysfunction.<lb/> Instead, they may indicate a competitive market situation providing larger consumer choice.<lb/> In turn, government intervention to harmonize standards could hence result in reduced<lb/> consumer choice and a reduction in consumer welfare. The introduction of a governmental<lb/> standard next to existing private standards could erode the value of private investments in<lb/> market development, including investments by NGOs in setting and verifying standards.<lb/> Public standards may reduce private-sector incentives to invest in environmental<lb/> differentiation. In addition, adjusting governmental standards to changing consumer<lb/> preferences may be more difficult than amending private ones.<lb/></p>

			<head>3.<lb/> Using standards to achieve policy objectives<lb/></head>

			<p>As documented in the previous chapter, standards can be used to make markets work<lb/> better by solving information problems. In this chapter, the focus is on how standards can be<lb/> used to implement policy objectives other than those related to improving the functioning of<lb/> food markets. In particular, the goal of this chapter is to identify potential synergies between<lb/> public policies and voluntary standards, including their related certification system.<lb/> An example of synergy is when a governmental programme can be made more effective<lb/> by referring to existing voluntary standards, rather than developing a series of technical<lb/> criteria from scratch, or by relying on existing certification systems and private certifiers,<lb/> rather than creating a control authority. Another example of synergy is the use of private<lb/> certifiers to adapt on-site inspections in governmental checks, reducing simultaneously<lb/> administrative costs and farmer transaction costs.<lb/> The next section introduces different approaches to achieve policy objectives, and offers a<lb/> first discussion of possible interactions with voluntary standards. Subsequently, an overview<lb/> is given of the different stages of the policy process. Based on this overview, possibilities for<lb/> synergies are explored in regulatory design, policy implementation and monitoring of<lb/> compliance.<lb/></p>

			<p>Throughout, reference is made to existing literature, to the survey on organic agriculture<lb/> standards in the OECD (Annex 3) and to eight case studies undertaken in four countries:<lb/> France, Korea, the Netherlands, and Switzerland. The full cases are available as country<lb/> chapters in Annex 4.<lb/></p>

			<head>Options for public intervention<lb/></head>

			<p>To achieve policy objectives such as environmental policy goals, governments can use a<lb/> variety of approaches. These can be classified by the degree of government intervention they<lb/> imply (<ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>), ranging from no intervention to a command and control approach. For each<lb/> of these steps, possible interactions with voluntary standards can be identified.<lb/></p>

			<head>Self-regulation<lb/></head>

			<p>Governments can choose to rely on self-regulation such as voluntary industry codes of<lb/> practice. In the context of environmental objectives in agriculture, relevant examples include<lb/> farm assurance schemes and private quality assurance schemes developed by retailers.<lb/> Voluntary environmental standards can thus be part of &quot; self-regulation &quot; , the assumption being<lb/> here that they are contributing to the achievement of policy goals, without any intervention<lb/> from government (<ref type="biblio">Sinclair, 1997; Gunningham and Rees, 1997</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<head>Co-regulation<lb/></head>

			<p>An alternative approach is co-regulation. The term is used to describe public and private<lb/> sectors working together to achieve policy objectives at lower cost (<ref type="biblio">Eijlander, 2005</ref>). Co-<lb/>regulation is a &quot; hybrid &quot; policy instrument, in the sense that the overseeing of the process is<lb/> retained by government, while it allows considerable input from the industry in order to tailor<lb/> regulatory responses (<ref type="biblio">Sinclair, 1997</ref>). Initially focused on regulatory design, the concept has<lb/> been subsequently extended to the entire policy process, up to conformity assessment and<lb/> compliance enforcement (<ref type="biblio">Garcia-Martinez et al, 2013</ref>). Considerable emphasis has been put<lb/> on the endorsement of voluntary standards and codes of practice by public agencies.<lb/></p>

			<p>In its white paper on governance, the European Commission promotes a greater use of co-<lb/>regulation. According to the Commission, &quot; Co-regulation combines binding legislative and<lb/> regulatory action with actions taken by the actors most concerned, drawing on their practical<lb/> expertise. The result is wider ownership of the policies in question by involving those most<lb/> affected by implementing rules in their preparation and enforcement. This often achieves<lb/> better compliance, even where the detailed rules are non-binding &quot; (OJ, 2001). The white<lb/> paper further provides conditions for a co-regulatory approach, in particular that co-regulation<lb/> should serve the general interest, and that the participating organisations should be<lb/> &quot; representative &quot; , &quot; accountable &quot; and capable of following open procedures in formulating and<lb/> applying the agreed rules (OJ, 2001).<lb/> One area where co-regulation is becoming increasingly important is food safety. Several<lb/> national authorities have moved from traditional command and control towards a more<lb/> flexible approach, where private firms are developing their own &quot; internal rules and procedures<lb/> in order to fulfil the regulator&apos;s policy objectives &quot; (<ref type="biblio">Garcia Martinez et al., 2007</ref>). In the<lb/> United States, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and several state<lb/> environmental agencies, such as that of Massachusetts, have also introduced management-<lb/>based regulations: rather than mandating specific process requirements, the agencies are<lb/> expecting the regulated firms &quot; to produce plans that comply with general criteria designed to<lb/> promote the targeted social goal &quot; (<ref type="biblio">Coglianese and Lazer, 2003</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<head>The OECD report on Regulatory Policies in OECD Countries, From Interventionism to<lb/> Regulatory Governance</head>

			<p>(2002) provides an overview of benefits and drawbacks of co-<lb/>regulation. Potential benefits include greater levels of compliance, greater responsiveness and<lb/> lower overhead thanks to the involvement of the industry and interested parties. Possible<lb/> drawbacks are a higher risk of regulatory capture 12 , potentially anti-competitive activities and<lb/> the development of barriers to entry for outsiders (OECD, 2002).<lb/></p>

			<head>Information and education<lb/></head>

			<p>To achieve policy goals, policymakers may also use information and education. In the<lb/> context of environmental objectives, for instance, governments can use public education as<lb/> well as information and promotion campaigns in order to raise consumer awareness and<lb/> stimulate the demand for products with desirable environmental attributes. Other options<lb/> include collecting and publishing evidence to guide the public debate or a &quot; naming and<lb/> shaming &quot; approach to exert pressure to adopt best practices. Technical assistance and<lb/> extension services may also be included under this category. Voluntary standards can be used<lb/> in this approach by the endorsement of private labelling initiatives (e.g. for organic food).<lb/></p>

			<head>Incentive-based structures<lb/></head>

			<p>The fifth category of policy options are incentive-based structures. This includes using<lb/> rewards or taxes to stimulate desirable behaviour, as well as the use of market-based tools.<lb/></p>

			<figure>Examples of agri-environmental policies in this category include payments for land<lb/> retirement or for the adoption of environmentally-friendly practices. These can be a flat rate<lb/> payment per hectare of eligible land (e.g. agri-environment programs in the European Union,<lb/> Norway and Switzerland) or delivered through auctions (e.g. Conservation Reserve Program<lb/> in the United States, BushTender programme in Australia). Environmental taxes or charges<lb/> include e.g. input taxes levied on pesticides in Denmark, France, Italy, Norway and Sweden,<lb/> and the taxes on fertiliser applied in Italy, Sweden and some states of the United States.<lb/> Market-based tools include permit trading for carbon emissions, water quality (United States),<lb/> nutrients (Australia, Canada) and surplus phosphates from manure (The Netherlands) (OECD,<lb/> 2010).<lb/> 12.<lb/> A form of government failure, where vested interests from the private sector dominate over the<lb/> initial (societal) objectives of the regulatory agency.<lb/></figure>

			<head>According to the Inventory of policies addressing environmental issues in agriculture<lb/></head>

			<p>(<ref type="biblio">Vojtech, 2010</ref>), payments to farmers also include grants to cover investment in<lb/> environmentally-friendly facilities and equipment, such as the Environmental Quality<lb/> Incentives Program (EQIP) grants in the United States, the structural payment programmes<lb/> under Rural Development Regulation (RDP) in the EU, and several tax concession programs<lb/> in Japan, Australia and Canada.<lb/> Voluntary standards can play an important role in such incentive-based policies. In<lb/> particular, agri-environmental programs are generally compensating farmers for the adoption<lb/> of input-reducing practices (e.g. crop rotations, reduced fertiliser and pesticides application),<lb/> landscape and habitat measures, identified as being beneficial to the environment (<ref type="biblio">Uthes and<lb/> Matzdorf, 2013</ref>). The list of eligible practices is developed by governments, and controls are<lb/> based on compliance with the specifications. But those area payments may also be based on<lb/> compliance with existing certification schemes, which is the case for organic agriculture in<lb/> several OECD member countries.<lb/></p>

			<p>More broadly, there are opportunities for equivalence between government-designed<lb/> measures and existing certification schemes. In the European Union, under the new Common<lb/> Agricultural Policy, a &quot; green payment &quot; will represent 30% of the budget for direct payments<lb/> and be allocated to farmers on an annual basis, provided that they fulfil three<lb/> environmentally-friendly practices (crop diversification, maintenance of existing permanent<lb/> grassland, minimal proportion of ecological focus area). National and regional certification<lb/> schemes may be recognised as equivalent with greening if their requirements cover or exceed<lb/> the practices listed in the regulation (EC, 2013).<lb/></p>

			<head>Command and control<lb/></head>

			<p>Finally, governments can rely on direct command and control intervention. These include<lb/> the tools traditionally associated with government policy, such as direct regulation, public<lb/> enforcement and monitoring, and sanctions and penalties. Environmental regulations, for<lb/> instance, can be applied to the quality or quantity of marketed products (product regulations),<lb/> technologies or processes (process regulations), or environmental performance (performance<lb/> regulations) (<ref type="biblio">OECD, 2010</ref>). However, also in this case governments can rely on existing<lb/> standards to set the regulations.<lb/></p>

			<head>The policy process<lb/></head>

			<p>To allow a better understanding of the possible interactions between policies and<lb/> voluntary standards, this section discusses the different stages of the policy process, as shown<lb/> in <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>. The subsequent section then discusses at what stage in the policy process<lb/> synergies with voluntary standards are possible and highlights experiences from the eight case<lb/> studies conducted.<lb/></p>

			<head>Strategizing<lb/></head>

			<p>The policy process starts from strategizing. This stage includes the identification of policy<lb/> issues, a definition of what the government wants to achieve, the evaluation of past policies,<lb/> the setting of targets, and the establishment of the operational features of the policy set, taking<lb/> into account the potential negative side-effects (<ref type="biblio">Van Tongeren, 2008</ref>).This step includes<lb/> deciding among the options identified in the previous section, e.g. whether to rely on self-<lb/>regulation, co-regulation, command and control, and so on. In environmental policy, a policy<lb/> mix may include statutory rules and other direct command and control intervention, as well as<lb/> economic incentives such as tax and subsidies, tradable permits, and communicative<lb/> instruments.<lb/></p>

			<head>Organisational design<lb/></head>

			<p>Before implementing policies, a decision is made on the organisational form. Ideally this<lb/> stage includes a clear allocation of responsibilities within the executive branch of government,<lb/> the choice of the appropriate level of centralisation and decentralisation, a flow chart of the<lb/> different administrative sections and units, long-term planning and budgeting, indicators to<lb/> track the effective implementation of policies, and a mechanism to coordinate the action of<lb/> the bodies in charge of the policy. In some cases, it may be necessary to create a new office or<lb/> to restructure existing agencies.<lb/></p>

			<head>Regulatory design<lb/></head>

			<p>Regardless of whether the core policy tool is a command and control intervention or not,<lb/> regulatory design is part of the process. A solid regulatory base is required before the<lb/> implementation of any policy instrument. This includes market-based approaches such as<lb/> tradable permits, which need government regulation to create the institutional framework and<lb/> allocate initial property rights (<ref type="biblio">Van Tongeren, 2008</ref>). Drafting or renewing legislation,<lb/> enacting ministerial decrees, and updating the provisions of administrative law are part of this<lb/> stage. The Regulatory Authority responsible for preparing the regulations is usually a branch<lb/> of central or local government.<lb/></p>

			<head>Policy implementation<lb/></head>

			<p>Policies are then implemented by different public bodies under the oversight of one<lb/> competent Authority (in the simplest case) which may be a ministerial department, an<lb/> independent agency, or a local government responsible for policy implementation within its<lb/> constituency. This stage includes the implementation of an information system, financial<lb/> circuits and control procedures to check eligibility and compliance; the negotiation of public<lb/> service delegations and agreements; the identification of beneficiaries, the processing of<lb/> applications, the provision of payments and the collection of taxes and fees (OECD, 2007).<lb/> Communication and technical assistance are provided.<lb/></p>

			<head>Monitoring<lb/></head>

			<p>The monitoring step is composed of several ex-post checks for compliance by the Control<lb/> Authority (e.g. verification of documents, on-site inspection, product testing), as well as the<lb/> provision of discharge and clearing to regulated operators and programme participants.<lb/></p>

			<head>Enforcement<lb/></head>

			<p>Finally, the measures are enforced through administrative sanctions provided by the<lb/> Control Authority and the Competent Authority (e.g., reductions in payment, fines,<lb/> suspension of licence, plant closure) and eventually through legal sanctions in courts.<lb/></p>

			<head>Figure 2. Sequences and main actors in the policy process<lb/> Interactions in the policy process<lb/></head>

			<p>Interactions with voluntary standards will be concentrated mostly in three steps of the<lb/> policy process: regulatory design, policy implementation, and monitoring.<lb/> Strategizing and organisational design are considered as a prerogative of governments. It<lb/> should however be noted that the identification of needs and the choice of policy options<lb/> involves the consultation of concerned citizens and stakeholder groups (<ref type="biblio">Van Tongeren, 2008</ref>).<lb/> Likewise, the enforcement of regulations is ultimately the responsibility of the executive<lb/> and judiciary branches of government. Even when command and control is replaced by more<lb/> flexible voluntary industry schemes, there is still an overseeing of schemes by public control<lb/> authorities, to check that they fulfil the regulatory objectives (<ref type="biblio">Bonnaud and Coppalle, 2013</ref>).<lb/> In case of disputes with the administration, legal recourses are available. However, there are<lb/> some cases when policy enforcement may be backed by standards. In developing countries<lb/> lacking the resources to properly enforce their own regulations, voluntary standards may<lb/> implicitly increase compliance with national law and regulations, as this is a prerequisite for<lb/> certification (<ref type="biblio">Djama, 2011</ref>). In most cases, however, the role of voluntary standards in this<lb/> step of the policy process will be limited.<lb/></p>

			<head>Regulatory design<lb/></head>

			<p>The drafting of legislation is obviously a prerogative of governments. However,<lb/> governments may choose to &quot; outsource &quot; part of their regulatory prerogatives (<ref type="biblio">Djama, 2011</ref>).<lb/> For example, the Food Standards Agency (FSA), responsible for food safety and food hygiene<lb/> in the United Kingdom, has stimulated the generation of voluntary codes of good practice by<lb/> the profession, in particular the Assured Food Standards (AFS) launched by the National<lb/> Farmers&apos; Union. In Canada, comparable farm assurance standards have been actively<lb/> promoted by provincial governments, for example in Ontario (<ref type="biblio">Garcia-Martinez et al, 2007</ref>).<lb/> Conversely, government regulations and administrative law may incorporate private<lb/> standards or be influenced by those standards, as demonstrated by the case of</p>

			<head>Korea<lb/> Certified Organic in Korea.<lb/></head>

			<p>In 1993, the Korean Government decided to regulate organic labelling and advertisement<lb/> to protect consumers with the Agricultural Products Quality Control Act. At the same time, it<lb/> was decided to develop a regulated organic standard, setting out the minimum requirements to<lb/> be met by organic products, assisting farmers in the appropriate adoption of organic practices.<lb/> From 1996, the certification system additionally covered low-pesticide agricultural products,<lb/> and a labelling system for organic products, Korea Certified Organic, was introduced in the<lb/> same year. The organic regulation of Korea covers all the requirements for organic<lb/> agricultural products, feed and processed food, including production rules, processing,<lb/> labelling, control, inspection, certification and assessment of imported feed and foodstuff.<lb/> Unlike the experience of European countries, Korea did not have competent private actors<lb/> leading the establishment of environmental standards. As a result, the Korean Government<lb/> thus played a key role from the beginning.<lb/></p>

			<p>The case of Korea Certified Organic shows synergies in regulatory design between public<lb/> regulation and private standards. The Korean public regulation on organic agricultural<lb/> products is largely based on organic standards developed in other countries and by<lb/> international organisations, in particular the IFOAM standards published by the International<lb/> Federation of Organic Agriculture Movements, a non-governmental organisation 13 . Moreover,<lb/> rules on production, labelling and marketing of organic products are based on the guidelines<lb/> of Codex Alimentarius, of which Korea is a member.<lb/> Referring to existing standards allows for significant cost savings in the development of<lb/> domestic regulations. Other countries&apos; experiences from the development and operation of<lb/> regulations and standards can be built upon, which should reduce problems potentially arising<lb/> from inconsistencies in the regulations and with related institutions. In addition, the clear link<lb/> to existing standards helps to reduce potential trade frictions that arise from differences in<lb/> national regulations and the need for compliance with different requirements. Finally, the<lb/> introduction of a legal basis for the equivalency with foreign organic food regulations driven<lb/> by the linkage to international standards is likely to facilitate trade in organic food products.<lb/></p>

			<figure>In the case of the Korea Certified Organic, elements of the IFOAM standard have been<lb/> incorporated into national regulations in the mid-1990s. Since then, Korea&apos;s organic<lb/> regulations have been amended several times under the authority of the Ministry of<lb/> Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs, last time in 2014 in the context of the Act on<lb/> Environment-friendly Agriculture and Fisheries and Organic Food Management Support. The<lb/> content of regulations has therefore evolved independently from the IFOAM standard.<lb/> 13.<lb/> The IFOAM standards have also been influential in the development of other organic regulations<lb/> in other countries, as well as of private standards.<lb/></figure>

			<p>A different approach of using standards in regulatory design would be to make explicit<lb/> reference to a standard in the regulation, as a requirement for compliance. The costs of<lb/> regulatory design are minimised. In that case however, several drawbacks and risks should be<lb/> mentioned. There is no participation of government in the governance of standard setting, or<lb/> governmental overseeing of the standard content. If the private operators unilaterally decide to<lb/> change the elements of the private standard, they de facto impact the scope and stringency of<lb/> regulations.<lb/> While the case of Korea Certified Organic shows how private standards (in this case the<lb/> IFOAM organic standards) can be used as building blocks for public standards, the reverse<lb/> situation is also possible, i.e. where public standards serve as the basis for developing private<lb/> standards. This is illustrated by the case of SwissGAP standards in Switzerland (Box 1).<lb/></p>

			<head>Box 1. SwissGAP: Public standards as building blocks for private standards<lb/></head>

			<p>In the case of the SwissGAP standard in Switzerland, the requirements of a private standard are based on<lb/> criteria first set in a governmental programme.<lb/></p>

			<p>Switzerland imports a substantial share of its domestic consumption of fruits and vegetables. Around the year<lb/> 2000, sporadic problems with pesticide residues occurred on the European food markets, and Swiss retailers<lb/> wanted to protect themselves against any potential incident that could damage their reputation. In order to<lb/> guarantee safety to their consumers, retailers therefore requested third-party certifications from their foreign<lb/> suppliers, such as the EurepGAP standard developed in 1997 by North European retailers (renamed GLOBALGAP<lb/> in 2007). To provide the same quality assurance in local sourcing, retailers (in particular the market leaders COOP<lb/> and Migros) requested their Swiss suppliers to comply with EurepGAP or other equivalent third-party certification of<lb/> good agricultural practices. Swiss retailers and national producer associations engaged in a dialogue around<lb/> standardisation and the best ways for developing the required farm assurance schemes.<lb/> The resulting SwissGAP standard for the production of fruits, vegetables and potatoes, introduced in 2006,<lb/> builds simultaneously on the requirements of GLOBALGAP standards and on the Proof of Ecological Performance<lb/> (PEP), a set of environmentally-friendly practices developed by the Federal government as part of the Swiss<lb/> agricultural policy reform. In Switzerland, PEP are not part of mandatory environmental regulations but the<lb/> fulfilment of PEP is required to receive direct payments since 1999. Therefore, at the time of the development of<lb/> the SwissGAP standard, with PEP, the &quot; baseline &quot; level was set rather high in Switzerland, especially in comparison<lb/> with the checklist of GLOBALGAP standard, which is more focussed on hygiene and risk management than on<lb/> environment conservation, and which was developed by retailers to be suitable to all sourcing countries. SwissGAP<lb/> thus goes further than GLOBALGAP in terms of environmental requirements. Rather than developing these<lb/> environmental requirements from scratch, the professional bodies involved with SwissGAP built the normative base<lb/> on the PEP.<lb/></p>

			<head>Policy implementation<lb/></head>

			<p>As discussed earlier, the level of governmental intervention may range from &quot; doing<lb/> nothing &quot; to command and control approaches based on mandatory rules and sanctions, with<lb/> &quot; co-regulation &quot; lying in between. The latter includes the use of voluntary standards and codes<lb/> of practice. Likewise, the use of standards in the implementation of policies may be more or<lb/> less active, from only supporting standard-setting organisations (i.e. funding, guidance) to<lb/> making standards mandatory. Four of the case studies illustrate the continuum of government<lb/> intervention (<ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<figure>Figure 3. Continuum in the use of standards in cases<lb/></figure>

			<head>Endorsement of standards<lb/></head>

			<p>A first way in which governments can rely on voluntary standards to implement policies<lb/> is by endorsing existing standards.<lb/></p>

			<head>In the case of the Farm Environmental Certification in France,</head>

			<p>the government has<lb/> developed a common framework to level the playing field in environmental standards, with a<lb/> mechanism to officially recognise existing private standards. After a first wave of organic and<lb/> biodynamic standards developed in the 1970s, a second generation of farm standards on<lb/> environmentally-friendly agriculture were introduced in France in the 1990s. Taking up<lb/> concerns on the environmental sustainability of agriculture, often together with questions<lb/> related to food safety and quality, those standards were developed by retailers, producer<lb/> cooperatives and professional bodies.<lb/> A national certification (Certification environnementale des exploitations agricoles) was<lb/> initiated by the French Government as part of a wider effort to promote sustainable<lb/> production and consumption, and to strengthen the environmental dimension of public<lb/> policies. Developed and sponsored by the Ministry of Agriculture in close collaboration with<lb/> professional bodies and NGOs, it has been promulgated by decree in 2011. The creation of a<lb/> certification was driven by the objective to better communicate farmers&apos; efforts towards<lb/> sustainability, and simultaneously – for representatives of agri-food and retailing sector – to<lb/> address consumers&apos; demand for more environmentally-friendly food (<ref type="biblio">Meybeck and Pingault,<lb/> 2010</ref>).<lb/> The certification is organised around three progressive levels. Level one is the<lb/> introductory standard, with a farm self-assessment and the fulfilment of EU &quot; cross-<lb/>compliance &quot; (i.e. requirements to receive any direct payment within the Common Agricultural<lb/> Policy). Level two is an intermediary level that reflects compliance with a set of 16 different<lb/> criteria (e.g. biodiversity conservation, crop protection strategy, fertilisation, water<lb/> management) that have an effective impact on the environment and are designed to be<lb/> integrated into the farm&apos;s daily management. These criteria set goals for environmental<lb/> progress on the farm, provide guidelines for the rational use of inputs and limit accidental<lb/> leakage into habitats. Only the most stringent level (Level three) grants the label of &quot; High<lb/> Environmental Value &quot; to farmers compliant with the standard.<lb/> An interesting feature of the certification is that previously existing environmental<lb/> standards operating in France can be benchmarked and recognised as equivalent to Level two.<lb/> Farmers may be directly certified under Level two or be automatically recognised as certified<lb/> if they are in an existing recognised scheme. To be recognised as equivalent, voluntary<lb/> standards have to cover the 16 criteria of the Farm Environmental Certification. Requests for<lb/> equivalence recognition are sent for approval to an independent committee. Any standard-<lb/>owner can apply. Some of the most prominent private environmental standards have already<lb/> been successfully benchmarked. Between 2012 and early 2014, 21 voluntary standards were<lb/> recognised as equivalent to the level two of the certification.<lb/> The motivations for the recognition of existing standards were i) to enhance the<lb/> environmental efforts already undertaken by farmers; ii) to improve transparency across<lb/> existing standards; and iii) to promote the wider application of the new scheme, by defining it<lb/> as complementing rather than competing with existing initiatives by the private sector<lb/> (<ref type="biblio">Meybeck et al., 2010</ref>).<lb/> Moreover, compliance with recognised private standards is considered as a step towards<lb/> further improvement. In other words, rather than leaping to the &quot; High Environmental Value &quot;<lb/> (HVE) standard, farmers can take a more gradual approach, experimenting with the good<lb/> agricultural practices promoted by the private sector in their close professional environment to<lb/> first obtain Level two certification which can then serve as a starting point for further<lb/> improvements towards Level three.<lb/> In Canada, the Environmental Farm Plans scheme provides another example of standard<lb/> endorsement, the enrolment in this voluntary scheme being a condition to benefit from<lb/> various federal and provincial agri-environmental programmes. The Environmental Farm<lb/> Plans scheme began as a pilot project in seven counties across Ontario in 1993, under the<lb/> leadership of the Ontario Farm Environmental Coalition, with a strong &quot; bottom-up<lb/> dimension &quot; (<ref type="biblio">Robinson, 2006</ref>). The approach has been successfully taken up in other Canadian<lb/> provinces.<lb/> The Environmental Farm Plan is similar to an environmental management system,<lb/> although with a greater emphasis on technical assistance and extension. Within this scheme,<lb/> the incumbent farmer attend several workshops with peers, complete a self-assessment of its<lb/> farm activities and develop an action plan, to mitigate environmental risks in 23 different<lb/> areas of farm management. Producers have the option to get their action plan peer-reviewed<lb/> by a local committee, comprised of local farmers experienced with farm environmental issues.<lb/> In several other provinces, a certificate is granted by advisors from extension services. In any<lb/> case, confidentiality of farm self-assessment and action plans is guaranteed. After the<lb/> validation of the Environmental Farm Plan action plan, the farmer is eligible to apply for cost-<lb/>share funding to implement Best Management Practices, under the Farm Stewardship<lb/> Programs financed by Canada and provincial governments.<lb/></p>

			<p>In addition to being a prerequisite to access incentive programs, participation in the<lb/> Environmental Farm Plan may reduce the risk of legal liability for the violation of<lb/> environmental regulations, as it is generally considered as an indication of due diligence.<lb/> More broadly, as the action plans are also incorporating several legally-mandated practices<lb/> (e.g. nutrient management planning), they contribute to foster farmers compliance with law<lb/> (<ref type="biblio">Rajsic et al., 2012</ref>) 14 .<lb/></p>

			<p>Performance (PEP), which was largely based on the previous requirements for integrated<lb/> production (OECD, 2015).<lb/> In addition, there is a link between the IP-SUISSE standard and two other policy<lb/> measures. First, payments for extensive cereal and rapeseed farming ( &quot; extenso &quot; payments)<lb/> have been introduced in 1990 as part of the ecological direct payments. The support has been<lb/> extended in more recent programmes, including the current policy package for 2014-2017, as<lb/> part of the payments for production systems, which also includes the support to organic<lb/> farming. To be certified under the IP-SUISSE standard, producers of cereals and rapeseed<lb/> must follow the requirements of &quot; extenso &quot; production.<lb/> Second, biodiversity quality payments are payments targeted to specific farming practices<lb/> or biodiversity outcomes (OECD, 2015). IP-SUISSE is applying a credit point system for<lb/> biodiversity which allows scope for action according to farmers&apos; preferences while the<lb/> Federal government provides payments targeted to defined biodiversity services.<lb/> The IP-SUISSE case highlights the complementarity between governmental programs and<lb/> private standards, mutually strengthening each other in a dynamic fashion over the years.<lb/> With more than 20 000 farmers currently enrolled, the IP-SUISSE scheme indirectly<lb/> contributes to the achievement of the governmental objectives to promote an environmentally<lb/> friendly agriculture.<lb/></p>

			<head>Box 2. Support to certified organic agriculture in OECD countries<lb/></head>

			<p>From the results of the questionnaire to country officials, it may be put forward a &quot; modal &quot; approach of<lb/> government involvement with organic agriculture in the OECD.<lb/></p>

			<p>The central government is supporting the growth of the organic sector, through several policy measures,<lb/> which are generally put in coherence within a multi-year strategic plan. Among the 27 OECD countries that<lb/> support organic agriculture and food, the main motivation for policy is the environmental benefits associated<lb/> with organic agriculture. Response to consumer demand and the improvement in animal welfare are also<lb/> frequently quoted by governments. The positive impacts on employment and consumer health are driving<lb/> organic policies in about one-third of countries.<lb/></p>

			<p>The policy mix includes support to organic farmers, organic food channels and the provision of general<lb/> services. Direct area payments to producers are widespread: 52% of countries are providing payments for<lb/> conversion to organic agriculture and 58% payments for maintenance. Regarding other types of direct<lb/> financial support, the coverage of certification costs is relatively frequent (36%), as well as investment grants<lb/> to individual farmers (24%). Measures for improving human capital include advice and technical training<lb/> (48% of countries), vocational training (24%), and integration of courses on organic farming in curricular<lb/> (21%).<lb/> OECD governments are also supporting organic food channels. This is more frequently done through<lb/> the support to organic fairs (39%) and for organic food marketing initiatives (33%). Public procurement is not<lb/> widespread (18%) and only found in Europe (Denmark, France, Ireland, Italy, Norway, Switzerland).<lb/> Regarding collective services for organic agriculture and food, more than half of countries are supporting<lb/> research projects on organic agriculture and food (58%) and the provision of sector information (58%). They<lb/> are also frequently providing or funding information and collective promotion campaigns (39%).<lb/> Diverging from this modal approach, six OECD countries have taken a different more market-orientated<lb/> approach towards the development of organic sector. Australia, New Zealand, Chile, Israel, Mexico have not<lb/> implemented policy measures to support the growth of the organic sector. The Netherlands have repealed<lb/> the measures in place until 2013 and restricts action to the enforcement of EU organic regulations.<lb/> Likewise, the case of organic agriculture in France illustrates why and how<lb/> governments can make use of voluntary standards and certifications to achieve their policy<lb/> objectives. In the last decades, with co-funding from the European Union under CAP, and<lb/> through successive action plans, the French government has supported the growth of the<lb/> certified organic sector, considering it to positively contribute to environment preservation,<lb/> farm employment, and rural development.<lb/></p>

			<p>Since 1992, support for the conversion to organic farming has been provided to farmers<lb/> under the European Regulation 2078/92/EEC. Organic agriculture was then put high on the<lb/> political agenda with the first national Action Plan designed to promote organic agriculture<lb/> and the market for organic food in 1998. The Organic Agency (Agence Bio) was created in<lb/> 2001 to promote organic products and later on to manage funds for marketing projects.<lb/> Following the 1999 Agricultural Orientation Law, payments to organic farming were<lb/> incorporated into agri-environmental schemes.<lb/></p>

			<figure>The 2006 Agricultural Orientation Law established an income tax credit for organic<lb/> farmers. The support to organic agriculture was reinforced in 2007, with an ambitious<lb/> quantitative target of 6% of organically managed agricultural land by 2012 and 20% in 2020.<lb/> In support of these aims, a second Action Plan for organic agriculture was released in 2008<lb/> for the period going to 2012.<lb/></figure>

			<p>The environmentally-friendly dimension of organic production has recently been<lb/> emphasised by the incorporation of organic agriculture within the Agro-Ecological project, a<lb/> broader governmental project promoting green growth in French agriculture. The objectives<lb/> are not only to increase the proportion of organically managed land, but also to benefit from<lb/> best practices from organic farms that may have favourable spill-overs on conventional<lb/> agriculture, e.g. mechanical weeding, bio-control of pests, long crop rotations. A new five-<lb/>year Action Plan for organic agriculture was launched in spring 2013. The Action Plan is a<lb/> policy mix with several instruments aiming at stimulating supply (e.g. training, incentives for<lb/> conversion, improving the organisation of the domestic organic sector, especially in post-farm<lb/> gate operations) and demand (e.g. public awareness campaigns, 20% of organic food in<lb/> community catering), as well as encouraging research and development.<lb/></p>

			<p>The cross-country survey confirms that support to organic agriculture and organic food<lb/> markets are widespread in the OECD. The cross-country analysis shows that most of other<lb/> OECD governments are funding measures supporting the growth of the sector, the main<lb/> motivation being the environmental benefits associated with organically managed land<lb/> (Box 2).<lb/></p>

			<head>Standards as an option to comply with regulation<lb/></head>

			<p>A more direct use of voluntary standards to implement policy occurs when compliance<lb/> with a voluntary standard becomes an option to demonstrate compliance with regulation.</p>

			<figure>The<lb/> 2BSvs voluntary scheme for biofuels in the European Union is a good example of this.<lb/></figure>

			<p>Over the past decades, governments in OECD and emerging countries have increasingly<lb/> promoted the development of biofuels. Over time, however, and especially after the<lb/> agricultural price spikes in the late 2000s, concerns were expressed about the potential impact<lb/> of biofuels on food markets and biodiversity. At the same time, there was increasing concern<lb/> about the performance of first generation biofuels in reducing greenhouse gas emissions. In<lb/> Europe, growing criticism led several countries to launch national initiatives to regulate the<lb/> biofuel industry, followed by the European Union which eventually implemented regulations<lb/> for the production, trade and use of biofuels in member countries (<ref type="biblio">Moïsé and Steenblik, 2011;<lb/> Ponte, 2014</ref>).<lb/> The EU Directive 2009/28/EC on Renewable Energy (known as RED, Renewable Energy<lb/> Directive) sets out sustainability criteria for biofuels in Articles 17, 18 and 19. These criteria<lb/> are related to greenhouse gas savings, conservation of land with high biodiversity value, land<lb/> with high carbon stock, and fulfilment of agro-environmental practices for agricultural<lb/> production in the EU. The criteria apply to biofuels and bioliquids produced in the EU and to<lb/> imported products. Only certified &quot; sustainable &quot; biofuels are eligible for tax benefits or can be<lb/> used to satisfy biofuel use mandates.<lb/> According to RED, economic operators in the chain must show their Member States that<lb/> the criteria have been met, either: i) by providing the relevant national authority with data, in<lb/> compliance with requirements that the Member State has laid down (a &quot; national system &quot; );<lb/> ii) by using a &quot; voluntary scheme &quot; that the European Commission has recognised for the<lb/> purpose; iii) in accordance with the terms of a bilateral or multilateral agreement concluded<lb/> by the Union with third countries and which the European Commission has recognised for the<lb/> purpose.<lb/></p>

			<figure>Between July 2011 and January 2014, several voluntary schemes were recognised by the<lb/> European Commission, including the Biomass Biofuels Sustainability voluntary scheme<lb/> (2BSvs). The 2BSvs scheme was developed by a consortium of French producer associations<lb/> representing the bioethanol and biodiesel industries, from biomass to biofuels. Private<lb/> standards were developed to allow farmers, biomass collectors (e.g. feedstuff cooperatives<lb/> and traders) and other economic operators along the supply chain to demonstrate the<lb/> compliance of their product with the sustainability criteria of the RED and Fuel Quality<lb/> Directives. The scheme was approved by the European Commission on 19 July 2011. It<lb/> supports sustainability claims, with respect to the Directive, for biomass used as raw material<lb/> and biofuels processed from that biomass.<lb/></figure>

			<p>One advantage of voluntary schemes as an option compared to the two other compliance<lb/> options (using Member States&apos; national standards or according to the terms of an agreement<lb/> with third countries) is that they allow individual operators to choose the most appropriate and<lb/> cost-efficient standards amongst those available. At the moment, there are 15 approved<lb/> voluntary standards in the European Union, a number that is manageable for regulators and<lb/> economic operators, while allowing for some competition between the standards, avoiding<lb/> barriers to entry for operators.<lb/></p>

			<p>Other pragmatic reasons for opting for voluntary standards initiated by the industry<lb/> include the absence of standards from specialised standardising bodies (ISO, CEN) at the time<lb/> the regulatory decision was taken, and the advantage for the EU to establish a system open to<lb/> third countries, in order to avoid accusations of implementing hidden barriers to trade, with<lb/> too prescriptive technical regulations on sustainable biofuels. The system has been<lb/> intentionally designed to facilitate trade with non-EU countries. Feedstuff for biofuel from<lb/> third countries (e.g. sugar cane, soy, palm oil) can be imported through the voluntary schemes<lb/> developed by commodity initiatives associating traders, NGOs and producers from<lb/> developing countries. The most prominent of such schemes (RSB, Bonsucro, Round Table on<lb/> Responsible Soy, and Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil) have all been recognised by the<lb/> European Commission.<lb/> A limitation of voluntary schemes is that they are not fully compatible with each other,<lb/> due to extra requirements on environment and social accountability included in some of them.<lb/> For example, 2BSvs is very similar to the German scheme RedCert, but not to RSB EU RED,<lb/> a sub-standard of the Roundtable on Sustainable Biofuels. Moreover, there is no provision for<lb/> automatic equivalence between voluntary standards in the EU Directive. Standard owners<lb/> have to agree to mutual recognition or to unilaterally recognise a scheme as equivalent; for<lb/> example, ISCC EU was recognised as equivalent by 2BSvs in December 2011. However, this<lb/> probably does not impede sustainable biofuel trade at the end of the chain, because the<lb/> standards all respect the core RED criteria.<lb/> The 2BSvs case thus provides an illustration of complementarities between public and<lb/> private sectors in the implementation of regulatory requirements. The voluntary standard<lb/> option to comply with RED can be analysed as a move toward co-regulation in the sector of<lb/> biomass production. This approach is consistent with the promotion by the EU of a greater<lb/> use of co-regulatory mechanisms to achieve better policies and delivery. The use of voluntary<lb/> standards as an option for compliance creates flexibility and cost efficiency for producers,<lb/> while creating an open system that enables trade with non-EU countries.<lb/> A related example of how policymakers can rely on private standards to implement public<lb/> policy objectives concerns the case of liability rules. Although not widespread in<lb/> environmental policy (at least when dealing with farms), the approach has gained importance<lb/> in food safety policy. Operators in the food chain are subject to governmental food regulation<lb/> and inspections, but they are also regulated under general commercial, civil and criminal law.<lb/> Under liability rules, they could be sued for negligence or breach of warranty in the event of<lb/> consumer poisoning. In such cases, the implementation of internal standards may show that<lb/> all reasonable care has been exercised to avoid harm.<lb/></p>

			<p>In the United Kingdom, the 1990 Food Safety Act introduced a strict liability for food<lb/> businesses but also a &quot; due diligence &quot; clause. The objective is to encourage all concerned to<lb/> take proper responsibility for their products. In England and Wales, Crown courts may send<lb/> offenders to prison for up to two years or impose unlimited fines. With the obligation of<lb/> reasonable care, companies in consumer markets such as major retailers are prompted to<lb/> closely monitor their food suppliers. The British Retail Consortium (BRC) standards have<lb/> been developed by a working group of retailers and other stakeholders in response to the UK<lb/> Food Safety Act, to fulfil legal obligations and demonstrate due diligence (<ref type="biblio">Humphrey, 2012</ref>).<lb/> The incentive effect of limited liability rules should not be overestimated, however. For<lb/> consumers, foodborne diseases are difficult to trace back to individual food companies or<lb/> restaurants, so that consumers face high information costs. In countries where food safety is<lb/> covered by tort or contract law, they also face high transaction costs to engage in litigation<lb/> with firms and the compensation from courts is generally uncertain and low, except in the<lb/> case of severe injury or death (<ref type="biblio">Buzby and Frenzen, 1999</ref>). Nevertheless, the use of private<lb/> standards as a way of demonstrating &quot; due diligence &quot; provides another example of synergies<lb/> between voluntary standards and regulation.<lb/></p>

			<head>Mandatory standard<lb/></head>

			<p>A final possibility for public interaction with private standards is for governments to<lb/> make compliance with the private standard mandatory.<lb/> Again, food safety provides an example of this approach. As in industrial safety and<lb/> environmental protection (<ref type="biblio">Coglianese and Lazer, 2003</ref>), food safety has seen a major shift<lb/> from technology-based regulation to management-based regulation, as the prescriptive<lb/> mandatory rules of agencies enforced by regular on-site inspection are replaced by the<lb/> implementation of Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP) plans and firm<lb/> quality management systems (<ref type="biblio">Humphrey, 2012</ref>).<lb/> In the United States, mandatory HACCP plans have started in the meat and poultry<lb/> industries in 1996 to prevent pathogenic contamination and foodborne illness. HACCP was<lb/> made compulsory for the seafood industry in 1999 and selected fruit juice categories in 2001<lb/> (<ref type="biblio">Rouvière and Caswell, 2012</ref>). Today, the use of HACCP is mandated by the Food and Drug<lb/> Administration (FDA) for high-risk food products, e.g. low acid canned food, fruit juices and<lb/> shrimp (<ref type="biblio">Humphrey, 2012</ref>).<lb/> In the European Union, the Hygiene Package in force since 1 January 2006 as an<lb/> application of the EU General Food Law (Regulation (EC) No 178/2012) is putting primary<lb/> responsibility for food safety on the food business operator and requires operators to<lb/> implement HACCP procedures (Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 852/2004 on the hygiene of<lb/> foodstuffs). The regulation provides a list of criteria for HACCP plans but gives considerable<lb/> flexibility to individual operators in their implementation of control measures (<ref type="biblio">Bonnaud and<lb/> Coppalle, 2013; Garcia-Martinez et al., 2013</ref>). In addition, the European Union encourages<lb/> the development, dissemination and use of both national and Community Guides to Good<lb/> Practice, used on a voluntary basis by food business operators.<lb/></p>

			<head>Monitoring compliance<lb/></head>

			<p>In addition to the synergies in regulatory design and in policy implementation identified<lb/> above, interaction with private standards and private certification bodies may also allow<lb/> governments to monitor compliance at lower administrative costs.<lb/> In France, one of the authorities in charge of enforcing food law, the DGCCRF, has<lb/> negotiated self-monitoring agreements with a group of importers to control compliance in the<lb/> fresh produce import market. Importers in the town of Perpignan are engaged with the Board<lb/> of Importers, which negotiates with the DGCCRF and is responsible for guaranteeing the<lb/> importers&apos; commitment regarding their checks of the legally-mandated MRLs for pesticides.<lb/> The private scheme involves procedures based on HACCP, product sampling and multi-<lb/>residues testing (<ref type="biblio">Codron et al., 2007; Rouvière and Caswell, 2012</ref>).<lb/> In the United Kingdom, the Food Safety Agency sets the frequency of farm inspections<lb/> based on the membership in private farm assurance schemes, such as the widely diffused<lb/> AFS. The average inspection rating for compliance with EU food hygiene legislation is 2%<lb/> compared to 25% for farms not enrolled in a voluntary scheme. In dairy farming, the members<lb/> of the &apos;Red Tractor&apos; Assured Dairy Farm scheme also enjoy reduced hygiene inspection, with<lb/> one official inspection only every 10 years. As regards to the Industrial Emissions Directive<lb/> (previously named Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control Directive), the producers of<lb/> pig and poultry members of an assurance scheme have one inspection per year from their<lb/> certification body, rather than two inspections by the UK Environmental Agency. In the<lb/> Netherlands, food business operators that purchase their raw materials or ingredients from<lb/> suppliers enrolled in the RiskPlaza scheme created by an industry trade association are<lb/> exempted from being checked by the New food and consumer product safety authority<lb/> (nVWA) as regards to their HACCP obligations (<ref type="biblio">Garcia-Martinez et al., 2013</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<figure>Additional examples of synergies between public and private standards in monitoring<lb/> compliance are found in the case studies of Bio Suisse in Switzerland and the EKO Quality<lb/> Mark in the Netherlands. The two countries have implemented national organic rules in the<lb/> 1990s; the Netherlands in 1991 to fulfil Council Regulation (EEC) 2092/91, and Switzerland<lb/> in 1997 with the Federal Ordinance 910.18. In both countries, more stringent private organic<lb/> standards are coexisting with the public standard embedded in regulation.<lb/></figure>

			<p>In the early days of organic farming in Switzerland, organic labelling initiatives were<lb/> founded by farmer associations and other NGOs. In the late 1970s, more than 30 locally<lb/> organised organic associations coexisted, with different rules about organic practices. Claims<lb/> were often not supported by an independent and neutral conformity assessment. The<lb/> fragmentation across organisations and regions (Cantons), and the lack of credibility were<lb/> challenging the growth of the organic food sector in the Confederation. Moreover, at that<lb/> time, the Federal government was sceptical about the &quot; ökologisch &quot; and &quot; biologique &quot; claims,<lb/> which were to some degree considered to be misleading and not scientifically sound. Rather<lb/> than introducing a national legislation, the government pushed local organic associations to<lb/> create a common standard. The Association of Swiss Organic Agriculture Organisations (Bio<lb/> assesses post farm-gate operations. In consequence, SKAL oversees the entire organic food<lb/> chain in the Netherlands.<lb/></p>

			<p>Given that the EKO Quality Mark uses the same certification system and certifier, both<lb/> administrative costs and transaction costs for farmers related to on-site inspections are<lb/> reduced. In addition, the definition of the EKO requirements and its certification system as an<lb/> extension of the EU organic regulations implies the full marketability of organic products<lb/> bearing the &apos;Euro Leaf&apos; logo across the European Union, in line with the principles of the EU<lb/> common market.</p>
