Like fossil fuels, minerals are non-renewable. In general, their deposits in the Earth&apos;s<lb/> crust are also geographically clustered, making security of supply a potential risk. In many cases, the<lb/> exhaustion of economically competitive minerals deposits in industrialized countries has made supplies<lb/> increasingly dependent on the political stability of mineral-rich emerging economies. At the same time,<lb/> increasing demand from these emerging markets, new technologies that require large amounts of rare<lb/> minerals , low substitutability in applications and low rates of recycling have made economies more<lb/> vulnerable to potential supply disruptions. Consequently policy-makers in several OECD countries and<lb/> regions have developed reports that assess the vulnerability of their respective economies to disruptions in<lb/> the supply of minerals. A common aim of many of these studies is the identification of a list of so-called<lb/> &apos;critical minerals&apos;, defined as minerals for which the risk of disruptions in supply is relatively high and for<lb/> which supply disruptions will be associated with large economic impacts.<lb/> The purpose of this report is to perform for the first time an analysis of critical minerals for the OECD<lb/> countries as a whole. In addition, this is done not only today, as previous reports have done, but also in<lb/> 2030, in order to form an initial picture of how possible trends in economic development will affect which<lb/> minerals are critical in the long-run future. 51 different minerals are included in our analysis. Three<lb/> measures of mineral supply risk are used: substitutability, recycling rates and the concentration of<lb/> production in countries that are judged by international datasets to be relatively politically unstable.<lb/> Physical scarcity is not considered to be a source of supply risk, certainly in the short term. While the non-<lb/>renewable nature of minerals is an eventual constraint on what can be extracted, reserves are generally<lb/> large and market mechanisms work to alleviate the problem. Potential disruptions are instead perceived to<lb/> come from the nexus of production concentration and geopolitical risks. It is also rather unlikely that<lb/> physical scarcity will affect supply risk in the period up to 2030, but the report does allow for such a<lb/> scenario by introducing to the index of supply risk a measure of the number of years to forecast depletion<lb/> of reserves. Vulnerability to supply risk – i.e. the &apos;economic importance&apos; of a mineral – is more<lb/> challenging to estimate and there is no consensus among existing studies. This report looks at how each<lb/> mineral is used in different sectors, as well as how economically important these sectors are for the<lb/> economy.<lb/> The analysis identifies around 12 to 20 minerals or minerals groups, which are critical in the OECD<lb/> today. Minerals like the rare earth elements (heavy and light), germanium and natural graphite have a<lb/> particularly high supply risk, while minerals such as barytes, tungsten and vanadium are particularly<lb/> economically important. Looking out to 2030, a stronger role is assumed for the physical availability of<lb/> reserves in determining where production takes place, which results in increased supply risk for barytes,<lb/> borate, phosphate rock and molybdenum. Also, the economic development along a baseline scenario that<lb/> assumes continued reliance on fossil fuels for energy does not change significantly the pattern of economic<lb/> importance of the various minerals concerned. Future work should evaluate whether this also holds true for<lb/> a pathway towards green, low-carbon growth. Lastly the report shows what improvements in the<lb/> substitutability of minerals and in their recycling rates would be sufficient today and more importantly by<lb/> 2030 to mitigate supply risks and vulnerability to them. This could be a focus for public support for R&amp;D<lb/> in the OECD. The results are highly mineral-specific, with some minerals requiring huge increases in<lb/> substitutability and/or recycling from a low base, while others require only small improvements.<lb/></div>
