            <table>Dudley and Montmarquette (1976) build a structural model where aid enters in the utility function of the donor<lb/> country and test it in a cross section of developing countries for 1970 considering one donor at a time (hence, a<lb/> small number of observations). Most papers deal with reduced-form estimations, however. A good example with<lb/> multiple donors, recipients and years (1980-99) is Berthélemy and Tichit (2002).
