By April 2009, the website will provide 32 case studies of recently completed nursery, primary<lb/> and secondary school buildings in Scotland. The purpose is to highlight good practice and demonstrate<lb/> different approaches to school design issues to help inform local authorities and others involved in the<lb/> planning, briefing and design of school estate projects.<lb/> Dalry Primary is a unique project involving the close collaboration of artists, architects and the county&apos;s<lb/> council in designing and realising a new concept in primary school building. The whole school is<lb/> designed as a learning prototype, offering multiple opportunities to engage with different organisational<lb/> and teaching methods, utilising or modifying the facilities and spaces. It does not impose directions or<lb/> solutions, but offers them as options. &quot; The brain &quot;<lb/> PEB Exchange 2008/15 – ISSN 1609-7548 – © OECD 2008<lb/> Dalry Primary – An Innovative Scottish Case Study</p>
