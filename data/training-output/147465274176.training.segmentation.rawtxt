whether through international insourcing or international outsourcing – is transforming the way many 
companies do business. This paper looks at the expansion of international supply chains and the rise of 
China, the Czech Republic, India and the Philippines as exporters of BPS and ITS. It also analyses the 
nature of and factors behind this trade and identifies major business-and trade-related challenges arising. 
In this context it presents some of the labour market implications resulting from increasing trade between 
OECD and non-OECD economies. The analysis shows that the BPS and ITS sectors in the four emerging economies are very 
differently structured: Chinese and Czech companies are predominantly supplying their domestic markets 
while Indian and Philippine companies are focused mainly on supplying foreign markets. In terms of 
exports, they also supply different geographies: China is mainly exporting to Japan; the Czech Republic to 
the European Union; the Philippines to the United States; and India to the United States and UK. Several of 
the larger home-grown companies in the four countries are establishing significant presence in foreign 
markets, in particular in other emerging markets, to build capacity and leverage local comparative 
advantage. This highlights the fact that different geographies have different strengths and BPS and ITS-
related FDI between emerging economies is likely to expand rapidly in the future. All four countries are facing supply side constraints. The low supply of senior personnel with 
industry-relevant experience in China, the Czech Republic and the Philippines acts as a break on growth. 
Many companies are also struggling to manage high levels of staff attrition and salary inflation. Regulatory 
restrictions are relatively few but still affect some companies. In the ITS sector, temporary movement of 
personnel can pose a significant challenge for home-grown exporters. The issue is most relevant for the 
Indian ITS sector that is dependent on sending professionals for longer visits to client premises. Slow and 
unpredictable procedures for issuing business visas and work permits, and quota limitations for work 
permits, give rise to operational challenges. In the BPS sector, and to a lesser extent in the ITS sector, data 
privacy and security legislation can have a negative effect on international outsourcing. But new 
regulations have also created entirely new business opportunities, including the medical transcription 
sector. ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This study has been prepared by Michael Engman of the OECD Trade and Agriculture

traded between emerging markets and OECD countries. While trade in these services has recently 
expanded significantly, this has been from relatively modest absolute levels. China, the Czech Republic, 
India and the Philippines are leading emerging market exporters in this area. In 2005, their combined 
export revenue was an estimated US$ 8.7 billion for BPS and US$ 14.5 billion for ITS. This represented 
roughly 2-3 percent of worldwide BPS and ITS spending and OECD countries imported the great majority 
of these services. As part of OECD's ongoing work on Globalisation and Structural Adjustment, this paper 
analyses the expansion of international supply chains and the rise of China, the Czech Republic, India and 
the Philippines as exporters of BPS and ITS. It aims to provide a clearer picture of the nature of and factors 
behind new international supply chains in these sectors and identify major business-and trade-related 
challenges arising. In this context it presents some of the labour market implications resulting from 
increasing trade between OECD and non-OECD economies. The BPS and ITS sectors in the four countries enjoy access to stable ICT infrastructure and a 
highly educated and language proficient workforce, which allow them to serve foreign markets. They also 
benefit from a set of other enabling factors that facilitate their business. First, the countries have generally 
established zones with dedicated infrastructure and streamlined administration to overcome local 
weaknesses in the business environment. While broader liberalisation for input services and more effective 
business regulations would render such zones unnecessary and benefit the economy as a whole, these 
zones have removed most of the excessive regulatory burden that hold companies back and ensured access 
to necessary input services. Second, governments have ensured liberal rules for foreign direct investment (FDI), which has 
allowed foreign multinationals to establish captive units, or joint service centres, to provide BPS and ITS 
services to foreign markets. This has with time generated substantial transfers of technology and 
management practises. Finally, open markets for cross-border supply and few regulatory restrictions in 
client countries have made it possible for companies in emerging markets to deliver BPS and ITS to 
international markets. The findings in the country studies show that the BPS and ITS sectors in the four countries are 
very differently structured: while only 10-15 percent of BPS and ITS supply are exported in China and the 
Czech Republic, almost 80 percent of Indian and Philippine BPS and ITS are aimed for foreign markets. 
They also supply different geographies: China is mainly exporting to Japan and the East Asia region; the 
Czech Republic to EU countries; the Philippines to the United States; and India to the United States, UK, 
and to a lesser extent to other OECD markets. This highlights that language proximity is a decisive factor 
in the decision making process of where to source BPS and ITS. Trade in BPS and ITS is dominated by OECD-based multinationals but home-grown companies 
in non-OECD economies are rising in prominence. Czech and Philippine BPS and ITS exports are mainly 
provided by foreign multinationals. In China and India, BPS and ITS exports are provided rather more 
equally between home-grown and foreign-owned companies. India is leading the way among the emerging markets with a mature and internationally 
competitive ITS sector. The home-grown Indian ITS sector has managed to create a successful business TD/TC/WP(2007)2/FINAL 6 model based on a 'global delivery model', which makes use of a combination of cross-border supply and 
temporary labour migration. Several of the larger home-grown companies in the four countries are 
establishing significant presence in other markets, in particular in other emerging markets, to build 
capacity and leverage local comparative advantage. This highlights the fact that different geographies have 
different strengths and BPS and ITS-related FDI between emerging economies is likely to expand rapidly 
in the future. There are also indications that south-south trade is about to gain in influence in some niche 
markets. The market for internationally sourced BPS is young, fast growing and competition is more even 
between the four countries than for ITS. India is the largest supplier but the Philippines has become a 
strong contender for services in English, in particular for voice-based services. All four countries are likely 
to continue to expand their export-oriented BPS sectors in the future. Some trend-setting multinationals 
already use all four countries to deliver BPS to geographies where languages match. The four countries face increasing supply side constraints in their quest to provide BPS and ITS 
to international markets. Strong demand has resulted in high attrition rates and salary inflation that some 
companies struggle to manage. In the ITS sector, it also takes significant investment in training to make 
young professionals productive, which makes staff retention key. The availability of senior personnel with 
industry-relevant experience is low in China, the Czech Republic and the Philippines, which acts as a break 
on growth. Regulatory restrictions are relatively few but still affect some companies. In the ITS sector, 
temporary movement of personnel can pose a significant challenge for home-grown exporters. The issue is 
most relevant for the Indian ITS sector that is dependent on sending professionals for longer visits to client 
premises. Slow and unpredictable procedures for issuing business visas and work permits, and quota 
limitations for work permits, give rise to operational challenges for Indian companies. In the BPS sector, and to a lesser extent in the ITS sector, data privacy and security legislation 
can have a negative effect on international outsourcing. But new regulations have also created entirely new 
business opportunities, including the medical transcription sector. Data privacy and security regulations are 
not necessarily negative as long as they are non-discriminatory in nature. Technological solutions allow 
companies in most instances to comply with the rules and clients generally require their suppliers to live up 
to standards that are higher than existing legislation. The integration of large countries, like China and India, in the world economy creates huge 
opportunities for companies in the OECD area to access new markets. It also enables them to access new 
talent to perform tasks in vertically fragmented value chains, including for BPS and ITS. While most work 
tasks cannot be performed in remote places with a business model that is economically compelling and 
delivers adequate service quality, international competition gives rise to job insecurity for some workers 
that used to be cushioned from such pressures. This indicates that trade liberalisation needs to be 
accompanied by sound labour market policies that facilitate reallocation of workers to more productive 
employment and help their citizens reap the gains from trade. The ITS sector in high-income countries may face less adjustment pressure than some initially 
feared. The reasons are that international competition is only applied to certain types of services – such as 
application development and maintenance – and the annual growth in worldwide demand for ITS is 
expected to exceed new supply capacity from low-income countries for the foreseeable future. While 
absolute levels of employment is unlikely to drop in the ITS sector, OECD markets may well see a shift in 
the demand for some job occupations within the ITS sector as it recruits more highly skilled workers for 
the supply of higher value services. TD/TC/WP(2007)2/FINAL 7 INTRODUCTION 1. 
Business process services (BPS) and information technology services (ITS) are increasingly 
traded between emerging markets and OECD countries. While trade in these services has recently 
expanded significantly, this has been from relatively modest absolute levels. Worldwide spending on BPS 
and ITS was approximately US$ 836 billion in 2005 and the great majority of trade takes place between 
OECD countries. 1 Exports from the four countries studied in this paper – China, the Czech Republic, India 
and the Philippines – made up around 2-3 percent of worldwide BPS and ITS spending. These countries 
were all providing the necessary combination of stable ICT infrastructure, liberal rules for foreign direct 
investment (FDI) and a highly educated and language proficient workforce. Yet only in India and the 
Philippines have the BPS and ITS sectors become significant sources of export revenue and job creation. 
India is leading the way with approximately 60 percent of the offshore market for trade in BPS and ITS 
(Citigroup, 2005). 2. 
International sourcing of BPS and ITS offers significant labour-cost arbitrage and enables 
companies to offer their clients new, cheaper, more flexible, and often higher quality services. It may offer 
reduced time-to-market, facilitate access to foreign markets and create business opportunities to develop 
new products for niche markets. The use of external providers also allows companies to focus on what they 
do best, freeing up capital to be re-invested in R&D and more productive activities. Innovations in business 
practices and low productivity growth have worked as drivers in other instances. But international sourcing 
of BPS and ITS from distant countries is not a viable option for most companies. It takes considerable 
investment and effort for a company to manage the complex undertaking and most services remain non-
tradable. That said, trade in BPS and ITS will continue to grow in significance as international delivery 
models mature and more countries – on both the demand and supply side – enter the global markets for 
BPS and ITS. 3. 
This paper is one in a series of OECD studies on Globalisation and Structural Adjustment (GSA). 
The GSA project aims to deepen our understanding of the impact of globalisation in OECD and non-
OECD economies. It focuses in particular on the overall economic effects of globalisation, the impact of 
globalisation and innovation in the business support service sector, and the links between trade and labour 
market adjustment. 2 As part of the GSA project, this paper looks at the role of major emerging economies 
in providing BPS and ITS to OECD markets. It is first and foremost aimed at trade analysts and policy 
makers but it may just as well be of use for anyone interested in the debate on offshoring – especially since 
the analysis offers plenty of information that is not easily accessible. Objectives and scope 4. 
The objective of the paper is to examine the expansion of international supply chains involving 
BPS and ITS. In particular the analysis will focus on how emerging markets are integrated in the supply 
chains of companies operating in OECD countries. The countries that are studied in the paper have either 
developed competitive BPS/ITS export sectors or have the potential to do so in the future. The aim is to 
provide a clearer picture of the nature of and factors behind new international supply chains in these 
sectors. It also seeks to identify the major business-and trade-related challenges arising. In this context it 
presents some of the implications for labour markets resulting from increasing trade between OECD and 
non-OECD economies. 1 The estimate comes from the International Data Corporation (IDC) and is cited in Nasscom (2006). It is presented as 
an indication rather than exact value of the global market of BPS and ITS. 2 It follows up on OECD (2005a) Enhancing the Performance of the Service Sector and OECD (2005b) Trade and 
Structural Adjustment: Embracing Globalisation. TD/TC/WP(2007)2/FINAL 8 5. 
The scope of the paper is limited to international supply of BPS and ITS, frequently referred to 
as  " offshoring "  (see Figure 1). Offshoring covers both international insourcing and international 
outsourcing and involves mainly cross-border supply of services (GATS mode 1/2). 3 For ITS, service 
delivery may also be provided through cross-border supply in conjunction with temporary labour migration 
(GATS mode 4). The scope of the study is further narrowed down to focus on the flow of services from 
emerging markets to OECD countries. It should be noted, however, that OECD-based companies are some 
of the largest suppliers of BPS and ITS to emerging markets through commercial presence (GATS mode 3) 
and emerging market suppliers are increasingly establishing subsidiaries in OECD countries to supply 
services locally. 4 Figure 1. An illustration of sourcing LOCATION

The paper focuses on a fairly broad group of services that is referred to throughout the paper as 
business process services (BPS) and information technology services (ITS). A 'business process' is an 
 " event-driven end-to-end processing path that starts with a customer request and ends with a result for the 
customer " . 5 Consequently, a 'business process service' is a service that performs a business process 
activity either in full or in part. Customer interaction services, back office operations, and professional 
services such as human resource, finance and accounting services are examples of business process 
services. 'Information technology services' include activities such as IT consulting, system integration, 
custom application development, application maintenance and traditional IT outsourcing and hardware 
support. 6 The number of activities that can be classified as BPS and ITS is continuously growing due to 
technological progress and business innovation. Thus, an exhaustive list using a non-generic methodology 
would quickly become outdated. 7 3 There is no agreement among WTO members about whether electronic supply falls under GATS mode 1 or 2, hence 
the terminology modes 1/2 is used 4 See Table 3 and Annex K. 5 See Gartner's glossary: www.gartner.com/6_help/glossary/GlossaryB.jsp 6 See more in MGI (2005a). 7 This is one of the main reasons why there is no common definition used in the literature that is linked to registers 
such as the WTO (1991) Services Sectoral Classification list. Annex A presents an indicative list of some of the 
services that are outsourced. TD/TC/WP(2007)2/FINAL 9 Data and methodology 7. 
International trade statistics fail, to a large extent, to capture trade in BPS and ITS. Several 
reports have concluded that there is a substantial discrepancy between the BPS and ITS trade data captured 
in the IMF Balance of Payment (BOP) system and the data presented by some governments and industry 
associations. In the case of India, the discrepancy between data presented by IMF's BOP system and the 
Indian National Association of Software and Service Companies (Nasscom) exceeds 90 percent for most 
recent years. 8 8. 
Given the challenges related to definitions and availability of comprehensive data, the following 
analysis will make use of data provided by government officials, industry associations and market 
intelligence companies. This type of data is normally based on filed income statements and market surveys. 
Thus it is essential for the reader to keep in mind that some data are best available estimates and may not 
be perfectly comparable across countries. 9 9. 
The analysis is also based on information and data obtained from interviews with some 90 senior 
managers, government officials, industry experts and representatives of industry associations in China, the 
Czech Republic, India and the Philippines (Annex B presents a list of the interviewees). The interviews 
were conducted during 1-2 week long missions to the four countries between September 2005 and 
September 2006. Information obtained from the interviews has been backed up with data from the existing 
literature whenever possible. 10. 
The following paper is centred round country studies of the BPS and ITS sectors in China, the 
Czech Republic, India and the Philippines. Each country study presents market characteristics of the local 
BPS and ITS sectors with focus on trade aspects. They present distinguishing features of each country's 
BPS and ITS sectors to illustrate how the countries' BPS and ITS sectors are being integrated in 
international supply chains and the extent to which they are successful at targeting export markets. They 
also seek to identify the main business-and trade-related challenges facing companies and governments. 
The country studies are then followed by a section with the main findings and concluding remarks. It 
includes a discussion of some of the implications that workers and governments may face as a result of the 
increasing trade in BPS and ITS between emerging economies and OECD countries. 8 See e.g. GAO (2005) and OECD (2004a). 9 To facilitate the analysis of the business process services sector, data references of BPS may cover both ITeS (IT-
enabled services) and BPO (business process outsourcing) that are used interchangeably by different sources. TD/TC/WP(2007)2/FINAL 10 THE CHINESE BPS AND ITS SECTORS 11. 
The potential attractions of China as a provider of BPS and ITS to OECD-based clients are many. 
The Chinese economy has grown rapidly for many years and the domestic markets for BPS and ITS are 
boosted by the large and growing number of Chinese and foreign-owned multinationals that operate in 
China. There is abundant supply of university graduates, including software engineers, many of which are 
highly qualified and motivated. Labour costs are particularly low for junior-level professionals and it 
makes China an economically compelling location for provision of BPS and ITS. Geographic proximity 
and linguistic capabilities are attributes useful in serving clients in Japan, Korea, Chinese Taipei, Singapore 
and Hong Kong. In addition, the business environment is conducive in Chinese technology and software 
parks that provide streamlined administration, quality infrastructure and incentive packages to prospective 
new exporters. Yet given all these merits, China still remains a small player on the international market for 
other services than high-end R&D services and lower end BPS services. 12. 
A.T. Kearney's Global Services Location Index ranks China as the second most attractive 
geography for providing BPS and ITS (see Annex H). Labour is inexpensive and infrastructure costs low 
but taxes and regulatory costs are higher in China than in India and the Philippines. While China has a 
particularly large labour force in absolute terms, people with relevant experience and foreign language 
skills make it less suited to provide services to markets outside East Asia. And although China is regarded 
as having a relatively low country risk and decent infrastructure, it scores poorly for cultural adaptability 
and security of intellectual property. neoIT's ranking of emerging markets places China as the third most 
attractive offshore location for ITS but only ninth most attractive location for BPS (see Annex F-G). China 
has a slight advantage compared to India in terms of costs but it significantly lags its neighbour in terms of 
maturity of local BPS and ITS companies and in the availability of suitable manpower. Market characteristics 13. 
The BPS and ITS sectors in China are predominantly serving the domestic market. In 2000, the 
export share of total supply was 6 percent according to Tschang and Xue (2003). By 2006, this share was 
estimated to have increased to 10-15 percent. 10 Exports are equally generated by Chinese-owned 
companies and subsidiaries of foreign multinationals. However, foreign multinationals obtain more of the 
large private services contracts than their Chinese counterparts (IDC, 2006a) 11 . 14. 
While there is a scarcity of reliable BPS/ITS trade data in general, the Chinese market is 
particularly challenging to analyse due to the relative lack of transparency and availability of disaggregated 
data. Very few Chinese BPS or ITS companies are publicly listed. The following set of estimates provides 
an overview of those that are frequently presented: 10 For example Walter Fang from Neusoft Group estimates that 85 percent of services revenue stems from the 
domestic market while de Filippo et al. (2005) put the number at 90 percent. 11 The two largest ITS companies in China are the Chinese subsidiaries of IBM and Hewlett-Packard according to 
Analysys International. TD/TC/WP(2007)2/FINAL 11 ! Analysys International estimates that the Chinese  " software outsourcing market "  was worth 
US$8.7 billion in 2005 (OSW, 2005). ! According to the Chinese Ministry of Information Industry, software exports in 2005 totalled 
US$3.59 billion, up from US$ 2.80 billion in 2004 (MII, 2006). ! Government officials in the Ministry of Commerce put the export value of IT and IT-enabled 
services at US$ 3.6 billion in 2005 and US$ 960 million were related to exports of software 
programmes and applications. 12 ! According to IDC (2006a), exports of software development services reached US$ 933 million in 
2005, up from US$ 600 million in 2004 and US$ 400 million in 2003. 13 ! A.T. Kearney (2004) estimates that US$ 320 million worth of BPS would be internationally 
sourced from China in 2005, up from US$ 260 million in 2004. 15. 
Exports of BPS and ITS are mainly delivered to companies operating in China's eastern 
neighbours: the Asia-Pacific region imported more than three-fourths of these services in 2005. Japan 
captures roughly two-thirds of exports and a significant part of this business is generated by branches of 
OECD-based companies operating in Japan. European and North American markets represent around one-
fifth of Chinese exports. More specifically, Japanese companies are large consumers of software 
application and maintenance services while European and North American companies are major clients for 
testing services (IDC, 2006a). 16. 
Notwithstanding the publicised, forthcoming rivalry between China and India as offshore 
services suppliers, the former country has yet to develop into a major base for international sourcing of 
BPS and ITS. There are indications that China is becoming the destination of choice for the supply of 
certain BPS and ITS to companies operating in Japan and Korea. However, this is not the case for 
European and North American companies and many analysts believe this is unlikely to happen in the 
foreseeable future. 17. 
Nevertheless, China may excel in foreign niche markets, some of which may generate sizeable 
export revenue. It is currently a capable destination at the two ends of the services value chain: low-level 
data processing and testing work and high-level R&D. In the R&D area, China is already one of the main 
centres in the world but there is rather limited R&D investment in the Chinese BPS and ITS sectors. In 
between the low-end and high-end of the value chain, China has yet to realise its potential as a supplier to 
foreign markets despite the nascent industry's ambition and the Chinese government's explicit goal to 
develop a competitive domestic software industry. 18. 
There is great potential for a strengthened Sino-Japanese trade relation in the BPS and ITS area. 
For example, the five top Chinese BPS and ITS companies presented in Annex K are mainly focusing their 
activities to serve the Japanese market. The geographic proximity, Japanese language proficiency and 
demographic and economic forces are compelling and indicate that this relation is likely to develop further 
if the political and business environments remain stable. Increased investment in Japanese language 
capabilities would in particular increase business opportunities for Chinese BPS companies. 12 According to government officials in MOFCOM, total output covering supply for domestic consumption and 
exports of the Chinese software and IT services industry was US$ 48.4 billion in 2005. This figure must be used with 
care given that the world's top ten software companies had combined revenue of US$ 84 billion the same year 
(OECD, 2006b). 
13 This includes Chinese or non-Chinese companies delivering  " software development services "  to non-Chinese 
companies either directly or to their subsidiaries in China. TD/TC/WP(2007)2/FINAL 12 Fragmentation and ownership 19. 
While the future potential for China to become an offshore centre of choice is great, the current 
capabilities of the domestic industry and the market structure leave plenty of room for improvement. The 
BPS and ITS markets are highly fragmented with more than 13,000 SMEs employing some 900,000 
professionals vying for business. 14 No home-grown company has a market share over 3 percent and few 
companies are export-oriented – the competition is cutthroat. There are many reasons why the BPS and 
ITS markets are fragmented. 20. 
First, they are still in their infancy and foreign participation has only started to pick up over the 
last few years. Second, with low entry barriers, the markets are full of small and immature companies that 
tend to compete on price rather than quality; act opportunistically without attention to developing domain 
expertise; and not invest adequately in training and process controls. As a result, operating margins are low 
by international standards (7 percent according to de Filippo (2005)). China is also mainly exporting fairly 
low-value services related to data entry, modular software programming and testing and maintenance 
services. 21. 
Third, China is a large country with different IT champions in different provinces and regions. 
Local governments have significant equity holdings in local BPS and ITS companies and tend to favour 
these to external competitors. Market consolidation is also held back by local governments that are 
unwilling to lose control of the companies. This has slowed down the development of companies with 
country-wide presence. Estimates of the share of public ownership of the BPS and ITS sectors vary: 
Tschang and Xue (2003) have estimated the share of public ownership at about 30 percent, with another 10 
percent having mixed public-private owners, and Gartner puts the public ownership share at 70 percent 
(Ilett, 2006). Saxenian (2003) argues that 30 percent of the software companies in China are state-owned, 
27 percent are Sino-foreign joint ventures, 20 percent are collectively owned (university spin-offs), 17 
percent are private and 6 percent are foreign-owned. 22. 
Many ITS companies founded in the 1980s-1990s were established by university faculty and 
universities were often awarded a share of corporate equity. For other Chinese entrepreneurs, a mixed 
public-private ownership structure was simply necessary to setup and run a company: official assistance 
(through guanxi 15 ) is often essential in China to gain access to licenses, permits, financial resources and 
facilities. Public ownership also brings protection and favourable interpretation of regulations and 
enforcement of contracts. Another key benefit of a public-sector link is the perceived advantage in the 
competition for contracts from public institutions and state-owned enterprises. (Saxenian, 2003). The 
supply of software programming and IT services to sensitive industries such as defence and aerospace is 
predominantly provided by publicly controlled companies. 23. 
The fragmented markets for BPS and ITS have several disadvantages: without adequate scale it is 
difficult to attract multinational clients, which make up much of the market for internationally sourced BPS 
and ITS. The main reasons are that small service providers are less reliable due to their dependency on key 
personnel and limited financial resources. Technical capabilities and flexibility are also negatively affected 
due to their lack of capacity or breadth to absorb large projects and offer domain expertise. In addition, it 14 According to the Chinese Ministry of Information Industry (MII), there were 13,194 registered software companies 
by the end of 2005 (AI, 2006a). MOFCOM provided the number of professionals in the industry. 15 Guanxi is a central concept in Chinese society and describes, in part, a personal connection between two people in 
which one is able to prevail upon another to perform a favor or service, or be prevailed upon. The two people need 
not be of equal social status. Guanxi can also be a network of contacts, which an individual can call upon when 
something needs to be done, and through which he/she can exert influence on behalf of another (www.wikipedia.org). TD/TC/WP(2007)2/FINAL 13 negatively affects companies' ability to develop mature and efficient procedures for process and quality 
controls. 24. 
Several of the export-oriented Chinese BPS and ITS companies are start-ups by former 
employees of OECD-based multinationals. Many senior Chinese executives have also been recruited from 
abroad to the domestic industry. This situation is similar to the one in India, where many of the leading 
services companies were established by former employees of U.S. and British multinationals. The main 
difference, however, is that most of the successful Indian services companies were established in the late 
1980s and early 1990s while many of China's fast growing services companies were established in the late 
1990s and early 2000s. The Indian industry is thus enjoying a significant head start and the Chinese 
industry is trying to catch up the best it can. 16 25. 
Some of the fastest growing export-oriented Chinese ITS companies are today privately owned. 
Given the competitive pressures and low-margin work at the Chinese market, more and more companies 
are trying to establish business models that are effective in serving foreign markets. Entry barriers to serve 
OECD markets are significantly higher than for domestic supply but those companies that succeed – and 
there is a small number of Chinese BPS and ITS companies that have more than US$ 10 million in export 
revenue from OECD market (see Annex K) – operate in markets where there are fewer competitors and 
more profitable business opportunities. The role of the Chinese government in attracting foreign investment 26. 
The Chinese government supports the local BPS and ITS sectors and tries to entice foreign 
companies with tax and tariff incentives, subsidies and administrative convenience in its dedicated high-
tech parks. The Chinese government also actively encourages partnerships and joint ventures with foreign 
companies to assist in the development of Chinese ITS companies. The Chinese government is not only the 
regulator but also the largest client of BPS and ITS in China and the largest owner of local companies. This 
makes the Chinese BPS and ITS sectors stand out in a comparison with those in the Czech Republic, India 
and the Philippines where public ownership is almost non-existent and public procurement as a share of 
total demand is relatively low. 27. 
The Chinese government regards the software industry to be essential to economic progress and 
national security. The key government policy for the software industry was announced in June 2000 and 
published in State Council Document 18, also known as the  " Notice of Certain Policies to Promote the 
Software and Integrated Circuit Industry Development " , and later followed up by State Council Document 
47 in 2002. The policy document established preferential policies to promote the development of these two 
sectors and the policies for software companies include: 17 ! Value-added tax refunds for R&D and expanded production; ! Tax preferences for newly established companies; ! Fast-track approval of software companies seeking to raise capital on overseas stock markets; ! Exemption from tariffs and VAT for all imports of technology and equipment; ! Direct export rights for all software firms with more than US$ 1 million in revenue; ! Right to set salary levels and to grant bonuses to investors 16 Computerworld argued in 2003 that the Chinese ITS sector was 12 years behind the Indian one. The Economist put 
it at 5-10 years in 2006. 
17 See www.csia.org.cn/chinese_en/index/No18Document.html for the text and Saxenian (2003). TD/TC/WP(2007)2/FINAL 14 28. 
In addition to the above-mentioned incentives, State Council Document 18 also provided for a 
new layout of the software sector, which included a plan to fund and promote selected companies for the 
creation of national champions (the Chinese government has subsequently selected around 160 national 
companies). It also established a Committee covering 15 Ministries to establish an effective legal 
framework to protect patents, trademarks and copyrights; and to ensure enforcement of this legal 
framework. Another pillar of the strategic document covers government incentives for the development of 
human resources (more on this below). 29. 
Documents 18 and 47 were followed by an initiative by the Torch Centre – a division under the 
Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST) – in November 2003 and referred to as the China Offshore 
Software Engineering Project (COSEP). COSEP's goal is to provide services from China to overseas 
corporate clients. The Torch Center annually selects qualified software companies from regional software 
parks to participate in COSEP and the companies are trained under supervision of ExperExchange – an 
American BPS and ITS company – to obtain a quality certification (ChinaTechNews, 2003). This project 
was launched with the help of ExperExchange and it has provided some of the impetus behind the 
expansion of outsourcing activities, in particular those targeting Europe and North America (Simon, 2005). 30. 
Although the central and local governments provide the BPS and ITS industry with significant 
support, there are two areas where the industry would like to see further improvement to enhance the 
business environment and its international visibility. First, the Chinese BPS and ITS sectors lack an 
effective industry association to provide best practise indicators for benchmarking, comprehensive industry 
data, and promote them abroad to potential investors. This is a disadvantage vis-à-vis other emerging 
market competitors. As Nasscom in India, BPA/P in the Philippines and the Czech ICT Alliance, such an 
industry association could also aid the Chinese government in formulating common priorities for the policy 
environment. The China Software Industry Association (CSIA) is currently the nation-wide industry 
association but it focuses mainly on the domestic market for software and related services. Its activities are 
restricted by its limited mandate provided by the Chinese government. CSIA is perceived to be first and 
foremost accountable to the government rather than to the industry itself. 31. 
Second, there are currently ten government ministries with different responsibilities to address 
specific issues and challenges faced by the BPS and ITS sectors. The National Development and Reform 
Commission (NDRC) defines the overarching policies for ministries, the Ministry of Information industry 
(MII) focuses on industry policy, the Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM) promotes trade, the Ministry of 
Science and Technology (MOST) provide guidelines for R&D strategy, etc. Many local observers argue 
that the Chinese government could be more effective and facilitate the situation by introducing a more 
coherent long-term policy without conflicts of interest with regard to the responsibility of different 
government ministries. TD/TC/WP(2007)2/FINAL 15 Box 1. Dalian Software Park The Dalian Software Park (DLSP), established in 1999, is one of the fastest growing software parks in East Asia 
and a major gateway for Chinese exports of IT and IT-enabled services to Japan and Korea. It is also one of six 
 " national software export bases "  approved by the Chinese Government to export services. Due to Dalian's 
geographical proximity and historical links to neighbouring Japan and Korea, the region has a substantial Japanese 
and Korean speaking population, which can be employed to supply voice-based and non-voice-based business 
process services. It also hosts many universities and research institutes that provide plenty of graduates that form 
the backbone in the outsourcing sector. Exports have grown rapidly: after the first establishments of mostly domestic companies, Panasonic setup 
operations in 2001 as the first Japanese multinational and GE Capital International Services arrived the following 
year. In September 2006, 340 companies employed approximately 30,000 professionals in the DLSP and roughly 
40 percent of the companies were foreign-owned. Half of the companies supply BPS and ITS services to foreign 
clients mainly in East Asia and Japan captures some 80 percent of exports. Revenue is to a large extent made up of 
software application development (40 percent) and business process services (30 percent). Engineering services, 
embedded software and R&D make up much the rest. A joint venture between DLSP and a Singaporean company 
is currently investing to develop the park by adding 9 km² to the current 3 km², which will make it the largest 
software park in China. This project is to form an industrial arrangement enclosing a Software Development Zone, 
a Research & Development Zone, an Information Service Zone, an Education & Training Zone, and a Corporate 
Campus Zone, plus adjacent public services and housing. DLSP offers companies a set of preferential policies. Foreign companies that operate in the DLSP can enjoy 
preferential tax treatment during five years from the year the company starts making a profit: the taxes of the first 2 
years are exempted and taxes for the following 3 years are reduced by 50 percent. Moreover, as long as exports 
make up at least 70 percent of total production value, income tax is reduced from 33 percent to 10 percent and the 
maximum VAT from 17 percent to 0-3 percent. For software products, VAT and export tax are exempted. For 
technology exports, the sales tax and income tax are exempted. Companies that export software products for more 
than US$ 1 million can conduct trade operations without having to make use of a third party export/import agent. 
Furthermore, import tax and VAT are exempted for imported equipment used by software companies and for 
technology, including software, and the parts and spare parts imported together with the equipment (with some 
exceptions). Companies that employ graduates with Bachelor degrees or higher qualifications are further allowed to register 
their employees as permanent residents, who are exempted from paying the city environmental fee. The same goes 
for overseas Chinese that come and work in the DLSP. They receive long-term temporary residential cards and 
their children enjoy similar rights as locals for school and kindergarten services. Annual  " special funds "  are 
provided from state departments, the province and the city to DLSP-based companies in addition to support from 
risk capital companies. Companies and employees also enjoy preferential treatment in buying or renting office 
buildings in the park. Source: OECD (2006), www.dlsp.com.cn and discussions with representatives from the DLSP. Challenges to China's BPS and ITS sectors in supplying international markets 32. 
Chinese-owned and foreign-owned companies that supply BPS and ITS from China face a 
number of challenges. Most challenges in the BPS and ITS sectors are related to supply side constraints. 
The biggest challenge is to recruit and retain talent, in particular middle and senior managers of the calibre 
needed to serve foreign markets. Another type of challenge relates to maintaining operational efficiency – 
including systems for formal procedures, processes and quality control – and this paper only touches on 
some of the China-specific issues that companies face. Regulatory constraints affecting trade are relatively 
few and the sectors benefit from a rather open business environment. This is partly due to business models 
based on cross-border supply and openness to foreign direct investment. The following section looks at 
challenges that are repeatedly highlighted by corporate executives in China: TD/TC/WP(2007)2/FINAL 16 Supply-side constraints Recruitment and retention 33. 
The BPS and ITS sectors are highly labour, not capital, intensive and human capital is each 
company's key asset. Although China produces a large number of university graduates every year, 
recruitment is for most Chinese-based service companies the single largest challenge. The sheer size of the 
talent pool is often presented as a main strength but identifying, hiring, training, retraining and retaining 
talent are real challenges for companies. Most graduates and engineers are unsuited to work in an export-
oriented sector where effective communication and client interaction in many instances are essential. The 
competition to lure the best software engineers (for the ITS sector) and other university graduates with 
technical and business training (for the BPS sector) is tough. Foreign multinationals have an advantage 
since they can afford to pay a wage premium for top talent; they may have an attractive brand name and 
offer opportunities to work abroad and with new technology in exciting projects. Domestic companies 
generally pay less but offer a somewhat different value proposition to its employees. 34. 
At the junior level, recruitment is not yet a major issue in China even if it takes considerable 
investment in training before new employees become productive. At a more senior level, for project 
managers and middle managers, the situation is different. The relative infancy of the Chinese BPS and ITS 
sectors makes it naturally difficult to find management talent with mission critical experience and 
expertise. The situation is not aided by the structural gap left from the Cultural Revolution, which 
drastically reduced the education level of a generation of Chinese. 35. 
The scarcity of middle and top level talent has effectively put a brake on growth and led to rapid 
salary inflation for these professionals (the salary increases are much more modest for junior level 
professionals). Some Chinese companies try to tackle the situation by recruiting managers from abroad, in 
particular from the sizeable Chinese Diaspora. According to DeWoskin (2005), some 60 million Chinese 
live outside China and make up a large source of capital and technology and provide crucial business 
networks. 36. 
Several policy programmes have been implemented by the Chinese government to provide 
incentives for Chinese scholars based abroad to move to China. For example State Council Document 18 
established a fund, managed jointly by the State Bureau of Foreign Experts and Ministry of Education, to 
send software developers overseas for training. A.T. Kearney (2004) refers to survey results by Hewitt and 
Associates showing that two-thirds of companies employ numerous Chinese expatriates and roughly half 
of director-level positions and above are filled by Chinese expatriates. The lack of middle and senior 
managers also force many companies to nurture their young talent and fast-track them into management 
positions. 37. 
Labour attrition is another challenge. 18 With only six export-oriented services centres, 
competition is especially hard as more and more companies move to the same locations and vie for talent. 
In the BPS sector, attrition rates are high – especially for voice-based services – but even at 30 percent, 
levels are lower than in India and the Philippines, and significantly lower than in many OECD countries. 
The ITS sector also suffers from attrition but it is generally lower than in the BPS field. To tackle this 
situation companies increasingly focus their attention to enhance core HR policies, e.g. by designing clear 
career paths, investing in education and training, and creating more pleasant work environments. Many 
companies also move delivery centres to smaller towns outside traditional technology and software centres 
where wages are lower and opportunities for staff to jump to neighbouring competitors are fewer. More 18 High attrition rates coupled with the strong need for investment in training creates a catch 22 situation where the 
incentives for investment in training are lower the less an employee is likely to stay. TD/TC/WP(2007)2/FINAL 17 and more companies are also providing performance related bonuses and relaxation of ownership rules will 
allow more companies to offer equity to key personnel. Box 2. Chinese vs. Indian labour supply Leading educational indicators show that China is quite well placed to provide ample talent for its service industry. 
According to Deloitte Research (2006), there is more than twice as many Chinese 18-23 years-olds (15 percent of 
total) than Indians (7 percent) enrolled in higher education. Chinese secondary schools host almost half the number 
of pupils per teacher (18 pupils/teacher) than Indian secondary schools (34 pupils/teacher). China also spends more 
resources on R&D and has many more computer and internet users (see Annex J). For the supply of BPS and ITS in English, India has a strong advantage over China. Many Indians are bilingual (or 
trilingual) with English as a mother tongue while the great majority of Chinese have limited exposure to the 
English language. However, in a generation's time, this difference will become less pronounced since the Chinese 
government has decreed that all Chinese children must study English from the age of five. Language proficiency and international business acumen 38. 
The supply of BPS and ITS often involves intensive interaction and communication with 
corporate clients. BPS are also often provided through real-time communication. The ability of service 
professionals to properly identify the task, solve the problem, and communicate the solution is thus related 
to his/her communication skills, technical capabilities and business acumen. Chinese professionals have a 
natural advantage to foreigners when serving their domestic market. However, Chinese professionals face a 
serious challenge when it comes to serving foreign clients and customers. Most Chinese professionals have 
limited exposure to foreigners and foreign business environments. BPS and ITS companies seek to address 
these gaps by investing in soft skills like language proficiency, communication skills and cultural 
awareness. 39. 
China has a sizable population of Japanese and Korean speakers in its North-Eastern provinces. 
A growing number of foreign multinationals are supplying voice-based support services in Japanese and 
Korean to customers and clients in China's eastern neighbours (see Box 3). The language proficiency and 
cultural affinity to these countries aid the process of supplying non-voice based business process services 
and IT services. China is today the main, although nascent, offshore destination for cross-border delivery 
of BPS and ITS to Japan and Korea. 40. 
The language barrier is arguably the main reason why China has yet to develop into an offshore 
location of choice for the supply of BPS and ITS services to companies in Europe and North America. An 
exception is certain high-level software programming and R&D-related activities for which China's 
abundance of scientists and knowledge workers are particularly well suited. The situation is different for 
Indo-European language skills. While China's current generation of pupils learn English at elementary 
school, students that graduate from university today have, at best, limited knowledge of spoken English. 
Those that do learn English have few opportunities to practise their skills. Even at international master 
degree programmes at some of China's best universities, students can read in English but writing and 
verbal communication skills remain low. 41. 
But this is starting to change, and will continue to change, as more English-speaking students will 
graduate in the future and more Chinese students return with degrees and language skills from overseas. To 
serve foreign markets, companies will not only need to find talent with language skills but also invest 
heavily in training to enhance workers' understanding of language nuances and the importance of tone in 
customer interaction. This is particularly important for sales and marketing activities abroad. TD/TC/WP(2007)2/FINAL 18 Regulatory challenges 42. 
The regulatory challenges are related both to the domestic business environment and to the 
regulatory environment in client countries. In the major client countries Japan, Korea and the United 
States, there are currently few regulatory concerns for Chinese-based BPS and ITS companies. The 
Chinese ITS companies that deliver services with the help of a global delivery model that is partly 
dependent on temporary movement of professionals between home office and client office face the same 
type of restrictions that Indian companies face in Europe and North America (see Indian chapter for an 
extensive discussion). 19 These restrictions relate to the relatively unpredictable and time-consuming 
administration of business visas and work permits, which increase complexity and business risk. 43. 
So far, few Chinese companies send professionals to their client countries and the issue, while 
real, is thus limited to the companies that employ a global delivery model with a significant onsite 
component. And Chinese professionals do not face this type of challenge in their relation with Japan and 
Korea, which also capture most of Chinese services exports. Foreign multinationals operating in China can 
move employees on intra-corporate work permits which are easier to obtain and involve less discretion. 44. 
The view of OECD-based companies with regard to regulatory challenges in China is rather 
positive too, not least because the software and technology parks that host almost all foreign-owned 
companies provide a unique trade environment with streamlined administration, high standards of 
infrastructure and financial incentives. These software and technology parks are a relief since it is a rather 
time consuming and tedious process to establish a subsidiary in China and there are some other issues as 
well (see Annex C). Box 3. Indian companies are increasingly investing in China After much contemplation and evaluation, the Indian BPS and ITS sectors have decided to approach China as a 
business opportunity rather than a competitive threat. Leading Indian companies Satyam Computer Systems, TCS 
and Infosys Technologies all established branch offices in China in 2002-03. These companies employed some 
400-600 Chinese professionals in their development centres in China during the fall of 2006. However, towards the 
end of the decade, the companies expect to have increased their Chinese headcount tenfold. Much of the workforce 
will be used to serve clients in neighbouring Japan and Korea. China can be leveraged by foreign/Indian companies in three main ways. First, some companies are targeting the 
rapidly growing domestic market with local and foreign-owned multinationals. Some 80 percent of Fortune 500 
companies have operations in China. Competition is high but new niche markets such as engineering services are 
providing new growth opportunities. China's accession to the WTO and the liberalisation of the banking sector will 
put pressure on domestic banks to increase productivity and this is expected to increase the market for domestically 
sourced BPS and ITS. Second, China is the natural offshore base, or  " nearshore "  bridge, to serve clients in Japan, 
Korea and the Asia Pacific. Third, with time, companies will build up capabilities to use their Chinese branches to 
serve clients also outside North-East Asia. Source: OutsourcingWorld and Vandrevala (2006) 19 Companies often need to move their employees to the client premises to negotiate, familiarise, transfer information, 
oversee, implement and maintain solutions and software. TD/TC/WP(2007)2/FINAL 19 45. 
The Chinese court system is considered to be unpredictable and recourse to legal means 
expensive. Most contracts are signed directly in the client country so that potential disagreements can be 
settled according to the jurisprudence in the client country. Foreign companies normally hire consulting 
companies to establish their subsidiaries since this process can take considerable time and involve dealings 
with many public agencies. 46. 
According to China's Schedule of Specific Commitments related to GATS, for  " computer and 
related services " , China has no limitation on market access or national treatment for mode 1-3 supply of 
 " consultancy services related to the installation of computer hardware " ,  " data processing services " ,  " input 
preparation services " ,  " data processing and tabulation services " ,  " time sharing services "  and  " management 
consulting services " . Limitations to mode 4 are related to education and work experience levels. For 
 " software implementation services " ,  " systems and software consulting " ,  " systems analysis services " , 
 " systems design services " ,  " programming services "  and  " systems maintenance services " , market access is 
only allowed in the form of joint ventures (with foreign majority ownership permitted) (WTO, 2002). 
Foreign industry has previously called for these limitations to be removed (USITO, 2003). 47. 
However, unlike in many other services sectors (e.g. telecommunications) in China, the BPS and 
ITS companies consulted in this study did not consider ownership regulations to restrict their activities. 
Ownership plays much more of a crucial role in government procurement: foreign-owned companies find 
themselves at a disadvantage in the bidding process with government agencies and state-owned enterprises. 
Yet a similar situation holds for the other countries studied in this paper and Chinese–owned companies 
find themselves at a disadvantage when bidding for contracts overseas. 48. 
There are significant concerns about Intellectual Property Right (IPR) violations in China, 
including patent, trademark and copyright violations. Pirated versions of enterprise and consumer software 
are readily available at the black market. However, IP violations do not necessarily affect the BPS and ITS 
sectors and companies dealing with IPR take a fairly pragmatic approach to tackle the issue in China. Most 
software applications and even software solutions, when tailor-made for corporate clients, are difficult to 
pirate. IPR is in most instances not relevant to services provision in the sectors studied here. The view of 
industry experts is that the legal framework in China to a great extent is developed on this issue but 
enforcement is not necessarily as strong as it could be. 49. 
Foreign investors are somewhat less concerned following China's accession to the WTO, which 
protects them under the Agreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) 20 . 
State Council Document 18 also provides stiff penalties for piracy. The Chinese government has increased 
its effort in cracking down on IP violations in parallel with its own campaign to help foster domestic 
innovation – which itself is highly dependent on proper enforcement of IPR. Tackling IP concerns to some 
extent hinges on the business model that a foreign company adopts in China. The captive unit, joint venture 
and use of external provider have difference merits with regard to control and security (see more in A.T. 
Kearney, 2004). 50. 
One type of regulation that is particularly relevant in the BPS sector relates to data privacy and 
security. Few regulations act as barriers to trade and clients require the highest standards for data security 
and privacy to outsource fragments – or activities – of their value chains. Companies invest in 
infrastructure and the business processes required to work according to these standards in order to compete 
for business. Regulations may raise the entry barriers to suppliers but are generally applied in a non-
discriminatory manner (see Indian chapter for more on this issue). 20 WTO accession also opened China's telecommunications services market to foreign investment, cut tariffs under 
the Information Technology Agreement (ITA), banned technology transfer and local content requirements, and 
ensured national treatment for internal taxes (Rohlmeier at al., 2003). TD/TC/WP(2007)2/FINAL 20 THE CZECH BPS AND ITS SECTORS 51. 
The Czech Republic is regarded as one of the most attractive locations in Central and Eastern 
Europe for international supply of BPS and ITS. It is also one of the more attractive locations worldwide. 
The country has several merits as a base for the supply of BPS and ITS within Europe. Among the chief 
advantages are the country's geographic and cultural proximity to large markets in Western Europe, its 
well educated, language proficient and cost effective workforce, its traditionally strong domestic 
engineering industry and well developed infrastructure. Foreign services companies also serve the growing 
domestic market and foreign expatriates like Prague for its high quality of life. Since May 2004, the Czech 
Republic is a member of the EU, which facilitates movement of service personnel within the internal 
market, ensures harmonisation of domestic laws and regulations with those in other EU countries – 
including for data privacy and security – and provides unlimited access to the European market. 52. 
A.T. Kearney's Global Services Location Index ranks the Czech Republic as the 7 th most 
attractive geography for providing BPS and ITS (see Annex H). The country scores particularly highly for 
its business environment, with low country risk, well developed infrastructure and high cultural 
adaptability. It also does well in international comparisons of quality of education, language proficiency 
and staff attrition. The main weaknesses relate to the limited size of the young and technically trained 
workforce and the domestic industry's lack of experience of delivering BPS and ITS services abroad. 
Additionally, the labour cost structure is significantly higher than in many other emerging markets with 
comparable capabilities. Czech salaries in the BPS and ITS fields are 100-150 percent higher than in China 
and India, and 60-100 percent higher than in the Philippines (see Annex D). Labour cost is not the decisive 
factor for foreign investors in the Czech Republic. 53. 
EIU (2005) ranks the Czech Republic as Europe's most attractive  " offshoring environment "  and 
third among emerging markets after India and China. 21 The attractiveness stems from its relatively low 
labour costs, favourable regulatory environment and proximity – both culturally and historically – to 
Western European markets. The country's well-educated workforce distinguishes it from closely ranked 
Poland and Slovakia. In neoIT's Offshore Attractiveness Index for ITS, the Czech Republic ranks 6 th after 
countries like India and China that score higher for industry maturity but ahead of the Philippines (see 
Annexes F-G). For international supply of BPS, the Czech Republic ranks 7 th behind India and the 
Philippines but ahead of China. In both areas, Poland and Ireland rank somewhat higher than the Czech 
Republic and it highlights the fact that different countries have different comparative advantages within the 
diverse BPS and ITS sectors. Market characteristics 54. 
According to the IDC (2006b), total revenue in the Czech ITS sector was US$ 1.15 billion in 
2005 and the market has grown by roughly ten percent per year. Growth in external services expenditure is 
triggered by low but increasing domestic outsourcing, public procurement and new establishments of 21 The EIU evaluation model also shows that high-income countries like Canada, Singapore and Hong Kong are 
among the top seven most attractive  " offshoring environments "  due to their skilled workforces, quality infrastructure 
and regulatory environments. TD/TC/WP(2007)2/FINAL 21 shared services centres by foreign multinationals. The domestic market is increasingly attractive for both 
domestic and foreign suppliers. In 2005, hardware and software support and installation services made up 
28 percent of the market, systems integration 22 percent, customisation 23 percent and outsourcing 15 
percent. The finance sector (26 percent of the market), combined manufacturing sector (16 percent) and 
government sector (14 percent) were the major client sectors. 55. 
The ten largest ITS companies captured 38 percent of the market and seven of those – including 
the top six – are subsidiaries of foreign multinationals (see Annex K). A few big foreign companies 
dominate the government procurement market. Domestically-owned companies are strong in certain niche 
markets for the supply of IT services: e.g. Unicorn is market leader in custom application development; 
and AutoCont CZ and ČEZData are market leaders in network and desktop outsourcing. However, revenue 
is to a large extent generated by domestic clients rather than through exports. 56. 
So far, the home-grown Czech BPS and ITS sectors have neither amassed critical size nor 
developed significant presence in client countries. McKinsey (2006) argues that this fact is due to 
increasing business opportunities at home, regulations and inconsistencies in labour laws that complicate 
foreign expansion, and a relatively slow embrace of international sourcing by Central and Eastern 
European companies. The international supply of BPS and ITS that stems from the Czech Republic is 
mainly generated by a limited number of foreign multinationals, predominantly in the IT field, that provide 
services to their European clients from shared services centres. The Czech Republic is not a traditional 
offshoring destination where internationally insourced and outsourced services are delivered to clients in 
far away countries but rather a nearshoring destination where internationally insourced services are 
delivered to other European countries. 57. 
McKinsey (2006) estimates that the global market for offshore IT and business process services 
is worth around US$ 30 billion and Eastern Europe supplies less than one percent of this value. In 2004, 
the Czech Republic exported approximately US$ 60 million of ITS, up from US$ 26 million 22 in 2003 and 
US$ 40 million of BPS, up from US$ 15 million in 2003 (Vashistha et al., 2005; neoIT, 2004). These 
estimates indicate that the industry is growing from a fairly modest level and is still preoccupied with 
serving the domestic market. Like in China, the Czech BPS and ITS sectors are still relatively immature 
and trying to build capacity to serve a more international clientele in the future. 58. 
According to survey results from 2005, covering 52 out of a total of 150 companies that provide 
outsourced ITS in the Czech Republic, most companies reside in Prague with second tier cities like 
Ostrava, Plzen and Brno gaining in significance due to local access to graduates from technical universities 
and lower labour costs (70-80 percent of Prague salaries) (IT Outsourcing Center, 2005). Major export 
markets for the surveyed companies were neighbouring Germany, Austria and Slovakia. UK, Germany and 
Austria were the largest markets for BPS. Other client locations included Canada, USA and the Nordic 
countries. Nearshoring 59. 
Nearshoring is a process where a specific country is chosen to service countries within close 
geographic proximity due to its favourable combination of labour cost, access to talent, cultural proximity 
and other enabling factors. 23 The Czech Republic is becoming a nearshoring destination of choice for 
multinationals wishing to consolidate their back office and IT support in shared service centres serving 22 The estimate includes domestic ITS companies and multinationals with service delivery operations in the Czech 
Republic. 23 The Czech workforce is too costly and too limited in size to develop into an  " offshore "  destination servicing non-
European markets. TD/TC/WP(2007)2/FINAL 22 continental Europe. 24 Central and Eastern European countries are rising to the top of the list for 
multinationals seeking to reduce costs for BPS and ITS supply in Europe but unwilling to bear the risks 
associated with offshoring to Asia. 60. 
One of the main investors in the BPS and ITS field in the Czech Republic is DHL, which 
operates a large shared services centre in Prague to track transactions and handle billing for its European 
customers (see Box 4). IBM operates a 1,200 strong workforce in its Integrated Delivery Centre in Brno 
that is part of IBM's global delivery strategy and Accenture has 1,250 services professionals at its shared 
service centre in Prague providing business solutions in the areas of for example finance and accounting to 
European clients (IDC, 2006). Other examples of shared – or nearshoring – centres include ExxonMobil 
(shared financial and accounting service centre), Hewlett-Packard (EMEA regional headquarters), Icon 
Communication Centers (outsourcing contact centre), Lufthansa (data processing centre), Siemens (shared 
financial and accounting service centre), Symbol Technologies (shared servicing and financial service 
centre) and Tesco Stores (shared service centre for IT, finance and accounting). 25 61. 
Leading Indian BPS and ITS companies have also started to invest in development centres in 
Europe and in particular in Eastern Europe. The global delivery model that was pioneered by the Indian 
outsourcing industry is not optimal for many foreign clients and it is often easier and more effective to 
serve European clients from countries like the Czech Republic. Progeon, a subsidiary of Infosys 
Technologies, was the first Indian IT-related investment in the Czech Republic. The company has 100 
professionals providing IT support services from its Prague office and another 100 professionals providing 
BPS from its office in Brno. The company plans to increase its Czech workforce to 1,000 in the near 
future. 26 Box 4. Serving European clients from the Czech Republic Following the integration of DHL, Danzas and Deutsche Port Euro Express in April 2003, the new DHL, with 
headquarter in Bonn, decided to establish three global IT services centres to provide 24/7/365 IT support to its 
120,000 clients that send more than one billion parcels annually. Prague was chosen as the European centre, 
replacing smaller units in Switzerland and the UK, and other global IT services centres were located in Scottsdale 
and Kuala Lumpur. These Czech, U.S. and Malaysian centres are interconnected via a corporate 
telecommunications network and support DHL's mail, express and logistics businesses around the world. The Prague centre was fully operational by January 2005 and DHL plans to invest €500 million over five years in 
its Prague operations. By 2008, the Prague centre is likely to employ some 2,000 employees. According to DHL's 
CIO, the Czech Republic was chosen for its  " availability of skilled and flexible labour force, well established and 
reliable telecommunications networks, good air links as well as for the optimum incentives package offered by the 
Czech government " . DHL hopes the project will reduce its US$ 1 billion IT budget by 60 percent and the 
consolidation of support centres has already increased productivity by 20 percent. Source: Czech Focus (2005), EIU (2006) and McCue (2004). 62. 
The reason why the demand for nearshoring services is growing is that it is easier to service 
foreign clients from a closer geography. According to DiamondCluster (2005), client satisfaction has 
dropped recently for offshored services. Management complexity is a significant deterrent. Cultural 
proximity has a big impact on communication and large time-zone differences are a disadvantage for 24 Other common locations for shared services centres include Ireland, Hungary, Slovakia and Romania. 25 According to the www.czechinvest.org website. 26 According to CzechInvest. TD/TC/WP(2007)2/FINAL 23 certain types of services. For SMEs, nearshoring is often the only viable alternative to keeping operations 
at home due to management overhead costs and operational risks associated with offshoring. An added 
benefit of nearshore locations like the Czech Republic is also that sensitive data remain within a regulatory 
environment similar to the one of the client's home country. 63. 
The Czech Republic is vying for the same foreign business as other Eastern European countries 
like Hungary, Slovakia, Poland and Romania. So far, these countries have all managed to attract a fair 
share of international investment. The different markets have yet to clearly differentiate their service 
capabilities. These countries have similar strengths and weaknesses and government officials and 
companies compete for as large a share of investment as possible in the hope that foreign multinationals 
will establish service centres which in time will yield technological spillover effects and transfers of 
management know-how to the domestic industry. The role of the Czech government in attracting foreign investment 64. 
The Czech government provides investment incentives through the CzechInvest agency. 
CzechInvest has identified the BPS sector as one of its top priorities. According to Government Decree 
1238 of 10 December 2003, the Framework Programme for Support of Technology Centres and Centres of 
Business Support Services, foreign investors that establish headquarters, software development centres or 
expert solution centres and invest a minimum of €0.5 million, create a minimum of 15 new jobs sustained 
for five years, and export at least 50 percent of supply are eligible for support. For call centres, high-tech 
repair centres, shared services centres, the minimum investment is €1 million and the number of new jobs 
50. Companies are also required to finance a minimum of €0.25-0.5 million from their own equity 
(CzechInvest, 2006). The incentives consist of subsidy grants for: @BULLET business activities, with up to 50 percent of eligible business expenses (wage or capital 
expenditure on tangible and intangible assets) paid during the a maximum of ten years and up to 
the ceiling of state aid; and @BULLET training and re-training, with up to 35 percent (30 percent in Prague) of special training costs 
and 60 percent (55 percent in Prague) of general training costs paid during a period of 3-5 years 
and dependent on the number of jobs created. 27 The maximum training subsidy is CZK 100,000-
150,000 per employee. 65. 
The maximum ceilings for state aid during 2007-2013 period were not yet negotiated when this 
report was prepared. However, the maximum ceilings are likely to be reduced from 20-50 percent to 10-40 
percent depending on the region receiving the investment. Between June 2001 and 16 November 2006, 90 
companies had been approved by CzechInvest to receive financial support. In return, these companies have 
pledged to invest €492 million and create 14,872 jobs. A majority of the jobs are for university graduates. 
Figure 2-3 show the country of origin of the companies that established services centres in the Czech 
Republic and the jobs created by the various investments. Next to the ten percent of jobs created by Czech 
companies, the most labour-intensive investments were undertaken by EU-based companies (57 percent), 
U.S. companies (22 percent) and Indian companies (7 percent). 27 'Special training' refers to training by which employees gain project-specific knowledge and skills that cannot be 
easily transferred to other companies. 'General training' refers to training by which employees gain general 
knowledge and skills that is not project-specific. TD/TC/WP(2007)2/FINAL 24 66. 
The industry association the Czech ICT Alliance was founded under the auspices of CzechTrade 
in December 2005. Its role is to help enhance the international profile of the Czech ICT industry. 
Improving the visibility of the Czech BPS and ITS sectors is needed in an increasingly competitive 
international business environment and the Czech Republic has yet to differentiate itself from neighbouring 
countries. The main reason why government incentives are perceived as important in Central and Eastern 
Europe is that the country profiles are relatively similar. A more generous government funded programme 
can make the difference when foreign investors decide where to locate shared services centres in the 
region. The situation is different in China, India or the Philippines where country profiles differ 
significantly and cost structures are lower. 67. 
While the Czech government is supportive of the BPS and ITS sectors, there is much room for 
improvement in its procurement policy. Government procurement is dominated by a few large companies 
and several observers argue that the procurement process could be significantly more open and 
transparent. 28 Survey results provided by the World Bank (2006) show that the share of companies 
describing corruption as a problem for their operations and growth in the Czech Republic has drastically 
increased. Between 2002 and 2005, the share increased from 28 percent to 49 percent. This situation is a 
great deal worse than in Slovakia, Poland and Bulgaria where the development was the opposite. Challenges to the Czech BPS and ITS sectors in supplying international markets 68. 
The business challenges facing the Czech BPS and ITS sectors in their quest to serve 
international markets are to a large extent related to the operational issues that face any nascent industry 
that starts to target foreign markets. On the supply side, these challenges are related to recruiting 
technically adept professionals and experienced managers that master foreign languages, building domain 
expertise, boosting productivity and managing complexity in an increasingly international market place. 
On the demand side, the main challenges are to develop sales and marketing organisations abroad and in 28 Corruption and transparency concerns were raised in several of the interviews and IDC (2006b) refers to it as 
having a moderately negative impact on the market in the medium term future. Figure 2. Number of BPS/ITS investment

Source: CzechInvest TD/TC/WP(2007)2/FINAL 25 general increase the visibility of the Czech Republic as a location for BPS and ITS supply. While Czech 
exports of BPS and ITS still are relatively modest, the country has the potential to attract significant 
amounts of foreign business and the Czech government hopes that the BPS and ITS sectors will help 
reduce the economy's strong dependency on exports of manufactured goods (see Annex I). 69. 
A survey by the IT Outsourcing Center in 2005 highlighted two challenges affecting the Czech 
services sector. First, there is a scarcity of technical personnel: the number of university graduates is 
relatively low and some of the software engineers migrate abroad. Second, the cost effectiveness of the 
Czech BPS and ITS sectors is being diminished by salary inflation, taxation and high levels of 
bureaucracy. According to CzechInvest (2004) and the Czech Ministry of Informatics (2006), Czech BPS 
and ITS companies suffer from their inability to effectively market themselves abroad and tend to rely 
heavily on their technical competence. The industry would gain from a more German and English 
proficient workforce, a more developed service culture and improved IPR protection. The capital market 
for SMEs is also a concern: e.g. Cermak et al. (2006) argue that access to capital has increased following 
the privatisation of the Czech banking industry but SMEs still suffer from limited access to capital. These 
weaknesses put the Czech Republic in a challenging situation where high-value services are provided 
mainly by Western companies while companies in Eastern Europe are building capacity and increasingly 
compete on cost in the same foreign markets as the Czech industry. 70. 
The labour cost arbitrage is not likely to be sustained in the long term and future EU accession 
countries, Bulgaria and Romania, are expected to increase the competition especially on the lower end of 
the services value chain. Ukraine is also a potential low-cost location for BPS and ITS work and a future 
competing geography for the Czech industry. However, companies from China, India and the Philippines, 
which are studied in this report, are not competing directly for the same business as the Czech industry. 71. 
During the next decade, it is likely that some of the BPS and ITS work that is done in the Czech 
Republic will migrate eastwards due to labour cost differences. In the hardening competition with the 
Czech Republic's eastern neighbours, Hungary, Slovakia, Poland and Romania, and non-EU members 
Ukraine and Russia, the Czech sector will need to move up the value chain and find niche areas where it 
can be at the forefront in specific domains or areas of technical expertise. The Czech industry may gain 
from an increased participation by companies further east if it can develop a business model that leverages 
the capabilities in those countries. Czech companies may for example outsource or insource some of their 
work to those countries. To become a more attractive partner to international clients, the Czech industry 
will need to increasingly focus on process maturity and quality control (e.g. certification such as ISO and 
SEI CMMi) and develop effective sales and marketing channels abroad. Supply side constraints Recruitment and retention 72. 
The Czech education system – in particular its technological universities – is one of the country's 
inherent strengths and a decisive factor for potential new ITS establishments. 92 percent of Czechs in their 
twenties have completed higher secondary education (compared to an EU average of 69 percent) and 
around 30 percent of tertiary students enrol in science, engineering, manufacturing and construction 
programmes (see Annex J). This is higher than in many other emerging markets and according to OECD's 
Pisa study, the Czech Republic has the highest quality of maths and science education in Central and 
Eastern Europe (CzechInvest, 2005). The Czech Republic produces 14,000 university graduates in 
technical and scientific subjects each year (neoIT, 2004) and there are currently some 26,700 students in 
IT-related fields in the Czech Republic (CzechInvest, 2005). Estimates of the annual number of IT 
graduates vary: 2,000-3,000 graduates result from a narrow definition of an  " IT graduate "  and the number 
increases to 4,000 with a broader definition. TD/TC/WP(2007)2/FINAL 26 73. 
According to figures by Universitas, 60 percent of 18-29 year-olds speak some English and 52 
percent have studied German. 29 The proportion of Czechs that can speak English is set to increase since 95 
percent of secondary school students study English (neoIT, 2004). Russian is a common language among 
older generations. What is worrying to the BPS and ITS sectors, however, is that although total spending 
per pupil has increased by 15 percent in real terms since 1989, spending per university student has fallen 
by more than 40 percent in real terms and the rate of admission to tertiary education among university-age 
students is the third lowest in the OECD (EIU, 2006). The domestic workforce is also set to shrink in the 
future due to the extremely low birth rates experienced in the 1990s. As a result of this demographic shock, 
Czech universities will either need to reduce entrance requirements or enrol fewer students in the future. 
New policies to attract foreign labour may be necessary to help smooth expected labour shortages. 74. 
In 2006, the Czech BPS and ITS companies could still recruit manpower without too much of a 
problem – at least outside Prague. Most foreign establishments are located in Prague and tend to pay a 
significant wage premium compared to domestically-owned companies. Staff attrition is less of a problem 
in the Czech Republic than in the Asian countries studied in this report, in particular India. It does happen, 
however, that multinationals enter the Czech market and pledge to recruit hundreds of workers within a 
short period of time and this tends to create short-term fluctuations with regard to staff attrition and put 
upward pressure on salaries. 75. 
As in China, the Czech BPS and ITS sectors suffer from a shortage of experienced managers that 
are both customer focused and quality conscious (Economist, 2005). Managers with strong backgrounds in 
both domestic and foreign markets, at ease with the business acumen and communication standards 
expected by foreign clients, are equally in short supply. This situation is not helped by the general 
unwillingness of Czechs to move and work in new cities. It is also challenging for the ITS sector to find 
senior programmers with 5-7 years of work experience since such professionals tend to have management 
positions. Regulatory challenges 76. 
The Czech business environment has in many regards improved over the last years and corporate 
taxation is being trimmed in line with competition from other newly acceded EU members. Annex C 
shows that Czech regulatory and institutional efficiency affecting the business community is broadly on 
parity with the OECD average in the areas of investor protection, access to credit, paying taxes and 
employing workers. There is still a lot of room for improvement when it comes to the ease with which 
entrepreneurs can start a business, close a business and enforce contracts. The judicial system is 
particularly slow compared to the OECD average and also slower than in China and the Philippines. 77. 
Czech ITS companies do seldom employ a service delivery model based on the temporary 
movement of service personnel. The economics behind the global delivery model, which is based on 
service personnel migrating temporarily from the supplier to the client, is not feasible in the Czech 
business environment. Yet some key personnel need to be transferred abroad at times and this is made 
more difficult by the decision of some EU countries to phase in the freedom of movement in the European 
internal market over a number of years. However, this is a temporary restriction that only affects a limited 
number of ITS projects involving foreign clients. Most Czech professionals are working to serve the 
domestic market and those serving foreign markets are predominantly working for foreign companies that 
can move skilled personnel without problems. With regard to movement between the Czech Republic and 
non-EU countries in Eastern Europe, movement of high-skilled workers is less difficult that movement of 
low skilled workers. 29 Cited by CzechInvest (2006). TD/TC/WP(2007)2/FINAL 27 THE INDIAN BPS AND ITS SECTORS 78. 
India is the leading emerging market exporter of BPS and ITS to the OECD area. India's export-
oriented ITS sector started to gain momentum already in the middle of the 1990s and has grown rapidly 
since then. The success of the ITS sector is demonstrated by the fact that three Indian ITS companies 
ranked among the world's six most valuable ITS companies in 2006. 30 Each one of these Indian companies 
exported more services than the combined ITS sectors of China, the Czech Republic and the Philippines 
(see Table 3 and Annex K). 79. 
The Indian BPS sector is less mature than the ITS sector and started to reach scale only some 3-4 
years ago. It faces strong competition from other emerging markets such as the Philippines for services in 
English. Indian companies are increasingly investing in emerging markets with complementary language 
capabilities, including in China to serve East Asian markets, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Hungary to 
serve EU countries, and in the Philippines to serve American clients. In addition, some of the leading 
Indian companies are increasingly investing in supply capacity in other OECD markets. 80. 
India's strength lies in its large English proficient talent pool and its large sophisticated BPS and 
ITS companies. The BPS and ITS sectors are labour-intensive rather than capital-intensive and a highly 
skilled workforce with language and communication capabilities is paramount in serving foreign markets. 
Compared to other emerging markets that export BPS and ITS, India stands out with its more mature and 
experienced home-grown industry and the combination of size and quality of the relevant workforce. 
Inexpensive labour helps attract foreign business but Indian labour costs are not discernibly different from 
some other leading emerging markets such as China (see Annexes D and H). 81. 
The Indian business environment is the industry's main weakness. The over-burdened 
infrastructure lacks adequate investment and the country risk is perceived to be higher than in countries 
like China and the Czech Republic (neoIT, 2006). Fierce competition for the country's top talent has led to 
rapid salary inflation and high attrition rates. Indian culture also lends itself less well to serve far off 
markets than for example the Czech Republic and the Philippines with cultural proximity to the main 
export markets in Europe and the United States respectively. Market characteristics 82. 
During the 1990s, India's compound annual growth rate (CAGR) for services exports was 17 
percent – the highest growth rate among the world's top 15 services exporters (World Bank, 2004). 
According to Nasscom (2006), in the financial year ending March 2006, India exported BPS for US$ 6.3 
billion and ITS for US$ 13.2 billion. Custom application development and application management were 
the two dominant service categories (see Table 1). MGI (2005a) estimates that India accounts for 72 
percent of ITS originating from low-wage regions and as much as 88 percent of such imports in the UK. 30 Based on equity value, TCS, Infosys Technologies and Wipro Technologies were ranked on fourth, fifth and sixth 
place among global ITS companies (JP Morgan, 2006). TD/TC/WP(2007)2/FINAL 28 The industry is strongly dependent on foreign markets: the domestic market for BPS and ITS was worth 
around US$ 5.2 billion, or 21 percent of the total supply. 31 83. 
In terms of export markets, the United States is the single largest destination for Indian BPS and 
ITS: it captures two-thirds of exports and this share has remained stable over time. The UK is the second 
largest client country and absorbs 14 percent of Indian BPS and ITS exports (see Figure 4). The private 
sector in the UK sources marginally more BPS and ITS from India than the private sector in the United 
States if account is taken of the relative sizes of their economies. Indian companies have targeted other 
overseas markets for many years but these investments have generated limited returns. Japan and Germany 
are the third and fourth biggest export markets but none of them business exceeding US$ 500 million. In 
total, 84.3 percent of Indian BPS and ITS exports were captured by English-speaking countries in the year 
ending March 2005. 32 This figure would most likely be higher if American and British companies 
operating from other non-Anglophone countries were included. Table 1. Indian ITS exports (US$ bn)

The four largest Indian ITS companies – TCS, Infosys, Wipro and Satyam – had export revenues 
exceeding US$ 1 billion in the year ending March 2006. The top five companies generated 46 percent of 
Indian ITS exports and 4-5 percent of BPS exports. 33 Another ten home-grown companies supply one-
fourth of ITS exports and 4-5 percent of BPS. The thirty largest captive units of foreign multinationals 
supply 15 percent of ITS exports and the 150 largest captive units make up 50 percent of the Indian BPS 
market. This implies that India works predominantly as a centre for international outsourcing for ITS and 
both as a centre for international insourcing and international outsourcing in the BPS sector. 85. 
The Indian-owned BPS and ITS companies are increasingly establishing supply capacity in 
locations outside India, for e.g. through cross-border acquisitions, acquisitions of IT departments of clients 
and through greenfield investments. While Indian companies are going global, moving into both emerging 31 In addition to BPS and ITS, Indian companies exported an estimated US$ 3.9 billion worth of engineering services, 
R&D services and software products. 32 That is Australia, Canada, Singapore, UK and the United States. 33 www.nasscom.in/upload/5216/Indian_IT_Industry_Factsheet_2006.pdf. TD/TC/WP(2007)2/FINAL 29 markets and OECD markets, more and more OECD-based ICT multinationals are growing their presence 
in India. Annex L presents estimates of the workforces of leading ITS multinationals. In 2005, 
approximately 11 percent of the combined workforce of foreign multinationals presented in the annex was 
based in India. According to Nasscom (2006), this share is growing and expected to reach 14 percent by 
2007. Some companies, like Accenture and IBM Services, have roughly one fifth of their workforces in 
India. Other companies like Cap Gemini and EDS have relatively few Indian employees. 86. 
Total employment in the export-oriented Indian BPS and ITS sectors was estimated at 0.8 million 
in the fiscal year ending March 2006. The workforce was split equally between the BPS sector and the ITS 
sector. A total of 1.3 million workers were employed in the Indian BPS and ITS sectors (for both domestic 
and foreign supply) and the sectors serving foreign markets with software products, R&D and engineering 
services. These combined sectors sustain an estimated 3 million jobs through indirect and induced 
employment (Nasscom, 2006). The former kind of employment is projected from expenditure on 
telecommunications, power, construction, facility management, IT, transportation, catering and other 
services. The latter kind of employment is driven by consumption of employees on food, clothing, utilities, 
recreation, health and other services. Box 5. The global delivery model for IT services The global delivery model (GDM) for IT services makes use of a combination of cross-border supply and 
temporary labour migration and was pioneered by Indian companies in the 1980s and 1990s. During the early 
years, before international fibre networks and the Internet were common place, documents and audiotapes were 
flown to India for digitisation and transcription. Basic programming work was also conducted for foreign 
multinationals. With time, Indian companies started sending IT specialists to their clients' premises for software 
programming work. This practice reached a peak in the lead up to year 2000 when demand for IT professionals 
exceeded supply in many OECD countries. The rapid growth in ICT networks, reductions in communication costs, and technological progress made it 
possible to keep an increasing number of IT professionals back in India (offshore) working with the Indian team at 
the client site (onsite). The Indian professionals at the client site defined the project requirements, coordinated 
work, installed software, trained client staff and provided rapid-reaction maintenance services while team 
members in India provided technology tasks such as technical and database design, programming, testing, 
documentation and long-term maintenance services. This business model was economically compelling due to the 
labour cost arbitrage between IT professionals in the client country and those working in India. It was also a highly 
challenging process to manage that only the Indians came to fully master among the emerging markets players. Over time, the need to keep a sizeable Indian team at the client site has been reduced. Between 2000 and 2005, the 
industry-wide average proportion of onsite work dropped from 67 percent to 42 percent. The size of the ratio of 
offshore/onsite work component is directly proportionate to savings of labour costs but the same also holds for the 
complexity of managing the project. Hence the optimal offshore/onsite ratio varies from project to project. The GDM has grown increasingly complex and sophisticated with time. Today large Indian companies break 
pieces of work into logical components and distribute them to locations where they can be most cost-effectively 
performed. For example, a client engaging an Indian company in London may interact with the Indian company's 
sales team, which is permanently based in London, and during the project life cycle host a team of senior Indian IT 
specialists that coordinate and implement different IT components provided from Bangalore, Jaipur and Budapest. 
The Indian company may then provide maintenance services from its development centres in Belfast and Budapest 
and technical telephone support from Bangalore. Source: OECD (2006), Kumra and Sinha (2003), Nasscom (2006) and www.infosys.com. TD/TC/WP(2007)2/FINAL 30 Challenges to India's BPS and ITS sectors in supplying international markets 87. 
The Indian BPS and ITS sectors benefit from a strong industry association in Nasscom. It has 
helped enhance transparency in the industry; promote industry standards, best practises and foreign direct 
investment; and it has been particularly successful at selling the industry abroad. Nasscom (2006) has 
identified three pillars where the industry faces significant challenges: cyber security (piracy, privacy, data 
protection and IPR), human resources, and infrastructure (in particular airports, mass transport systems, 
roads and electricity). 88. 
In general, companies operating in India are also subject to excessive bureaucracy and 
regulations. The country scores poorly in several of the indicators provided by the World Bank's 
benchmarking exercise Doing Business (see Annex C). These include in particular indicators for starting a 
business (lengthy and tedious), closing a business (lengthy and with low recovery rates), taxation (highest 
tax rate) and labour market rigidity. Enforcing a contract is a nightmare: it takes on average some 1,420 
days, one of the world's worst records. As a result, legal contracts are signed in client countries and 
covered by the client country's jurisprudence. 89. 
To the benefit of the BPS and ITS sectors, the business environment is significantly improved in 
the Indian Software Technology Parks (STP) that were introduced in the early 1990s, and which is where 
export-oriented companies operate. The STPs have the same function as export processing zones. They 
provide tax exemptions, bridge gaps related to infrastructure, and offer a more conducive business 
environment. For foreign multinationals, most of the administrative burden is drastically cut in the STPs 
and many of the remaining issues can be solved by hiring external consulting companies. 90. 
The World Bank (2004) argues that India must address two critical challenges in order to sustain 
the dynamism of its service sector: externally, the problem of actual and potential protectionism; and 
domestically, the persistence of restrictions on trade and investment as well as weaknesses in its regulatory 
framework. To address the former problem, India will need to secure access to foreign markets. However, 
the most pressing challenges facing the BPS and ITS sectors companies today relate to supply side 
constraints. The following section reviews the concerns addressed by Indian companies and foreign 
multinationals with substantial operations in India. Supply side constraints Recruitment and retention 91. 
Most BPS and ITS companies in India struggle with recruitment and retention of professionals. 
The problem is not the number of graduates produced every year but rather their quality. While the share of 
graduates that are adequately trained for work in the export-oriented BPS and ITS sectors is higher than in 
a country like China, the relative size of the combined BPS and ITS workforces (around 0.8 million in 
March 2006) and the high growth of the industry have increased HR activities. Although there is no 
shortage of young professionals looking for employment, investment in screening and training is 
substantial and keeps rising in line with the high number of graduates that are recruited. Foreign 
multinationals tend to tackle these issues by paying a significant wage premium compared to Indian 
companies. 92. 
Retention is another challenge since most ITS talent is concentrated in centres such as Bangalore, 
Chennai, Delhi, Hyderabad and Mumbai. Staff attrition rates in the BPS sector may be lower than in most 
OECD countries, especially for voice-based services, but frequent job hopping reduces BPS companies' 
productivity and tends to fuel salary inflation. Dange et al (2005) estimates that every 5 percent of 
employee attrition reduces gross margins by up to 1.5 percent. However, India has an advantage compared TD/TC/WP(2007)2/FINAL 31 to the other countries studies in this paper since its BPS and ITS sectors pioneered the offshoring business 
and have the broadest and deepest pool of project managers and senior managers. Restrictions on temporary movement of ITS personnel 34 93. 
The global delivery model (GDM), used by most Indian companies to export ITS, is dependent 
on international transfers of senior personnel between home and foreign client offices (see Box 5). On 
average, approximately one-third of operational manpower in a typical Indian ITS company is situated at 
the client site throughout a project life cycle. But the allocation of personnel varies from company to 
company, project to project, and throughout the project life cycle. Many medium and large Indian 
companies have permanent staff employed in client country subsidiaries. These professionals typically 
manage client interaction, in particular related to sales and marketing activities, but some of the largest 
companies, like Infosys Technologies and TCS, maintain a growing number of operational staff as well. 
However, most operations such as software development are still carried out by professionals based in 
India or other emerging markets, including China, Eastern Europe and the Philippines. 94. 
The manpower located at client site has gradually dropped from more than two-thirds in the mid-
1990s to one-third today. This ratio of work at client site is likely to continue to edge downwards due to 
technological improvements and maturing GDMs. Yet there is a limit to the amount of work that can be 
carried out offshore: the economics of international outsourcing lies in maximising the amount of work 
carried out in cost-effective locations; and face-to-face client interaction is still paramount to achieve 
operational efficiency. The GDM employed by Indian companies will continue to be dependent on 
international transfers of managers and IT professionals in the foreseeable future. 95. 
The administrative process related to documentation for business visits to client countries can be 
a challenge for Indian ITS companies. Some of the issues related to administration and documentation are 
removed with time as trust is built in new client countries and authorities realise the value that visiting 
professionals provide. American and British authorities have long experience of handling Indian visa and 
work permit applications but this does not hold for many other OECD countries. There has been some 
improvement in the visa and work permit administration and there is scope for further improvement. 96. 
Rules concerning business visas and work permits are issues of national sovereignty. Each 
country designs the requirements and administrative procedure deemed necessary to provide business visas 
and work permits to foreign citizens consistent with national objectives. The following section presents 
some frequently raised concerns in this area in the Indian ITS sector. In general, while there are direct costs 
associated with the documentation and application process for movement of personnel, the concerns raised 
relate more often to the time and uncertainty involved. The direct costs are regarded as an additional 
overhead while time and uncertainty cause large indirect costs or even break deals. Business visas and work permit requirements 97. 
The process of obtaining a business visa is relatively straightforward in most of India's export 
markets. However, the discrepancy between countries can be significant: the process of obtaining a 
business visa can take anything from one to ten working days in India. Some companies report that they 
frequently obtain business visas with shorter valid times than they apply for. This adds complexity and 
uncertainty since companies may have to pay cancelling and rebooking fees for air tickets and hotels, and 
reschedule project plans and client meetings, etc. The visa holder may also need to return to India only to 
go through the application process again before finalising the business with the client. 34 OECD has published a number of studies on temporary movement of service providers. See e.g. OECD (2003a; 
2003b; 2004b). TD/TC/WP(2007)2/FINAL 32 98. 
The administrative process for work permits is more stringent than for business visas. Some 
countries make use of quota systems to control and manage the number of work permits that can be issued 
each year. Work permits are usually issued for visitors that do billable work or stay for more than three 
months. An advantage of the application process for work permits compared to the process for business 
visas is that there is less discretion in the administrative process and there are seldom issues concerning the 
duration of stay. 99. 
The current application procedure for work permits leaves the decision to the discretion of the 
official handling the application. In many countries, applicants need to submit documents in original 
copies, schedule an interview for which there may be 45-120 days of waiting time, and then convince the 
official during the interview that he/she has no intention to migrate on a permanent basis or overstay the 
approved duration of stay. This recurring issue is due to the fact that many countries do not differentiate 
the handling of applications for permanent migration and temporary movement of natural persons. The 
applicant who presents the requested documentation may also be asked to provide additional 
documentation at a later stage to verify the obligatory documentation. This process may involve rounds of 
translation and legalisation of documents. 100. 
For example, some records such as birth certificates and educational diplomas first need to be 
legalised by the local state government. The legalised documents are then translated to the language of the 
country for which the application is due before the translated version of the legalised document in turn may 
need to be legalised. For certain documents, the procedure can involve up to three levels of legalisation and 
visits to the applicant's hometown, the local state authority and government ministry in New Delhi. In 
some countries, Indian ITS professionals go through a process that can take more than six months in order 
to obtain a work permit. In some cases the waiting time can be 8-10 months. The processing time makes it 
impossible to undertake certain projects and may not only result in lost business opportunities but also 
damage client relations. 101. 
The administrative process for issuing work permits is less of a concern for Indian professionals 
working for foreign subsidiaries than for home-grown companies. Many foreign subsidiaries are product 
development centres and the employees of these centres seldom need to interact directly with clients or 
work abroad. Employees who still need a work permit can normally move as intra-corporate transferees. 
The administrative process for such movement is relatively efficient and subject to few restrictions. The 
situation is different for employees of Indian-owned companies. Some of the largest Indian companies 
have subsidiaries with local employees in their main client countries and this generally facilitates the work 
permit process since employees can move as intra-corporate transferees. However, the great majority of 
Indian companies do not have the financial strength or the business model to establish operational units in 
client countries and they depend on the effectiveness of client country embassies and consulates. 102. 
Work permits may come with regulations concerning minimum wage levels or wage parity 
requirements. While these occasionally inflate the final client bill, wage regulations seldom have any real 
effect since most professionals sent to work abroad have reached a seniority and wage level that exceed 
these requirements. More burdensome is the additional layer of administrative work needed to prove that 
the company comply with all the rules. A fair, predictable, transparent and streamlined process for business 
visa and work permit applications would benefit both the client and the supplier. 103. 
Indian IT companies have developed sophisticated mechanisms to minimise potential 
disturbances to their operations: large companies have dedicated departments which handle travel logistics 
and applications for business visas and work permits. Each project leader may be in charge of the visa 
planning for the professionals in his/her project. Most companies also employ professional consulting 
companies to help with translation, legalisation and temporary migration issues. Long-term client relations 
facilitate this planning process and increase predictability. TD/TC/WP(2007)2/FINAL 33 104. 
There are three principal ways which Indian companies can reduce their dependence on work 
permits in the future. One way is to establish development centres in client countries (see OECD (2006b)). 
This approach reduces the need for international movement of employees and those that move can apply 
for intra-corporate work permits. The second way is to maximise the amount of work that is carried out in 
India, e.g. by partnering with client country companies or by bringing the client over to India for 
knowledge transfers. 105. 
Another increasingly common approach among the larger Indian ITS companies is to establish 
development centres in countries within close proximity (near-shore) to client countries. These countries 
offer higher cost environments than in India but lower cost environments than in client countries. Central 
Europe, and in particular Hungary and the Czech Republic, are developing into service centres for 
Continental Europe; Mexican and Canadian companies service the U.S. market, francophone African 
countries are used as bases to service the French market; and development centres in China provide 
services to Japan. The near-shoring centres help to overcome language and cultural barriers as well as 
some of the restrictions to international movement of professionals, in particular in Europe. Data privacy 
and security regulations can also be easier managed within the EU. 106. 
While  " near-shoring "  may facilitate the movement of professionals to client countries, there are 
often serious restrictions to movement between India and the proximate markets that the companies invest 
in. Indian IT companies are generally well received and supported in the new emerging markets in which 
they invest but it takes time to remove long-standing south-south restrictions which in many cases are more 
stringent that those for north-south trade. These are often more challenging to overcome than those 
between India and OECD markets. Restrictions on movement of information 35 107. 
Data privacy and security concerns are related to the risk of: a) data being lost, and; b) data being 
accessed by external parties or misused by the company processing the information. While IT security can 
be guaranteed to some extent with technology, data privacy is people-driven and corporate procedures and 
ethics are of uttermost importance. Indian companies invest in data security systems and back-up 
equipment to reduce the former type of risk. 108. 
Data privacy is mainly a concern for BPS companies that transfer and/or process large quantities 
of personal information about other companies' clients or employees. These transfers may include 
sensitive data such as financial, medical, social security and purchasing histories. Regulations on data 
privacy are imposed on companies located within the OECD area and these companies in turn require 
companies to whom they outsource to fulfil criteria which normally go beyond legal requirements. 
Improper handling of information has in the past resulted in public relations scandals for companies whose 
customers or employees have been affected. Both clients that outsource work and the companies providing 
the services have much to lose if there is a breach in data confidentiality. 109. 
Restrictions to the movement of information are an area where many companies fear future 
legislation could erect barriers to mode 1/2 trade. 36 To counteract data handling misuse, Nasscom is 
working together with the Indian government to draft an Information Technology Act which will set 
minimum industry requirements for data privacy and establish a penal code for companies or individuals 35 See OECD (2006b) for a more extensive overview of data security and privacy issues. 36 As a precaution against potential protectionism, more than 300 Indian BPS and ITS companies have established 
subsidiaries in Singapore where they would be able to route data in case India were to be targeted with trade-
restricting legislation (Aron, 2005). TD/TC/WP(2007)2/FINAL 34 breaching the rules. So far there have been few known incidents of data theft in India and by establishing 
and enforcing strict data privacy standards, the industry hopes future issues will be kept to a minimum. 110. 
Indian BPS and ITS companies sign non-disclosure agreements with their clients and a number of 
mechanisms are established to protect data. These include dedicated offshore centres where e.g.: @BULLET only project staff is allowed; @BULLET the client's infrastructure and IT system are replicated; @BULLET all types of data transfers are encrypted; @BULLET project staff are prohibited from carrying any devices that can store information; @BULLET project staff are prohibited from interacting with project staff working for competing clients; @BULLET project staff are kept under video surveillance 111. 
There is also a multitude of technical solutions which eliminate the need to physically transfer 
data. This includes IT systems which allow offshore project staff direct online access to the data in the 
client country. Operations may also be carried out on dummy data and then applied on the original data at 
client site. As long as data privacy regulations hold for companies irrespective of the country in which they 
are headquartered, data privacy and security regulations are not considered an issue. 112. 
Indian companies have established processes to handle data privacy and security because they 
were often a requirement to attract foreign clients in the first place. However, the issue of data privacy and 
security is still a concern for clients. Booz Allen Hamilton (2006) recently published a survey which 
showed that information security is one of the three most important factors for U.S. companies when they 
select an outsourcing partner. The survey also indicated that information security concerns were related to 
the lack of trust in legal and regulatory environments in developing countries. 113. 
Several U.S. laws require companies to maintain reasonable technical, physical and 
administrative safeguards but do not address the issue of international data transfers directly. 37 They rather 
 " impose obligations to maintain reasonable security, access controls and the like, which must be 
considered in any vendor relationship, domestic or off-shore… "  thus  " …assuming the vendor provides 
appropriate security and confidentiality, U.S. laws do not now limit a company's ability to select vendors 
in any other geography "  (Eisenhauer, 2005). The obligation for a U.S. company to comply with U.S. data 
privacy and security regulation exists no matter where the engaged service provider is located. 114. 
EU Directive 95/46/EC 'On the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of 
personal data and on the free movement of such data' took effect in 1998 and is a comprehensive data 
protection and privacy law. It covers most sectors and allows transfers of data if a set of conditions are 
fulfilled. In addition, in the banking sector in some European countries for example, there are regulations 
stating that neither is the international transfer of data nor the international online access to data allowed. 
In such cases, the global delivery model employed by Indian BPS companies is not workable unless they 
establish operational units in the country. 115. 
In conjunction with legislation, there are several types of standards and guidelines such as ISO 
17799 (for best practices in information security), ISO 27001 (for information security management 
systems) and COBIT (Control Objectives for Business & Related Technology). Compliance with data 37 These include e.g. the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Privacy and Safeguards Rules Act, the Health Insurance Portability 
and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and California Senate Bill 1386. TD/TC/WP(2007)2/FINAL 35 privacy, security legislation and guidelines is necessary but comes at a cost: Pai and Basu (2005) cite a 
TowerGroup study which estimates that the costs of  " effective international outsourcing "  increase by 3-5 
percent in BPS and 7-9 percent in ITS for due diligence. Risk management increase the costs by another 3-
5 percent in ITS and 8-10 percent in BPS. THE PHILIPPINE BPS AND ITS SECTORS 116. 
The Philippines has several merits for international supply of services and is the second largest 
exporter of BPS and ITS among the countries studied in this paper. The labour cost arbitrage is significant, 
the infrastructure in Metro Manila where most companies locate is well developed and the 
telecommunications infrastructure is reliable and cost-effective. The voice-based and non-voice based BPS 
sectors attract graduates that are more highly qualified than their peers in most high-income countries. The 
country has historically been a protectorate of the United States and this has led to close cultural ties and a 
sizeable Philippine Diaspora in the United States. Communication skills, English proficiency and the 
neutral American-influenced Philippine accent are key attributes for serving U.S. clients. In addition, staff 
attrition rates in the service offshoring industry are low and certain cultural factors lend themselves 
particularly well to voice-based services, e.g. Philippine service workers are generally perceived to be 
customer-oriented with a natural ability to convey empathy. 117. 
International benchmarking exercises find the Philippines to be one of the most attractive 
locations for services offshoring (see Annexes F-H). A.T. Kearney's Global Services Location Index for 
2005 ranks the Philippines as the fourth most attractive country, with inexpensive labour and 
infrastructure, high cultural adaptability and low staff attrition. The country does less well in terms of 
maturity of the home-grown services industry, quality of education, protection of IPR and the country risk 
is higher than in many comparable emerging markets. High levels of corruption, security issues in the 
south of the country and political instability have a negative effect on the overall business environment. 
However, neoIT ranks the Philippines second only to India in terms of  " offshore attractiveness "  in the BPS 
sector and the country scores particularly well for the maturity of the local BPS sector and the availability 
and quality of talent (see Annex G). In the ITS sector, the country ranks lower (11 th out of 40 countries) 
and the relative weaknesses in the ITS field are the same factors that make the country strong in the BPS 
field: industry maturity and the availability of talent are not as favourable as in many other comparable 
countries. Market characteristics 118. 
The Philippine BPS industry has grown rapidly over the last five years and established itself as 
one of the premier emerging market providers of BPS. In 2005, the Philippine customer contact industry, 
which hardly existed only five years earlier, employed 112,000 workers and generated revenue of US$ 1.6 
billion (see Table 2). Revenue in the contact centre sector doubled every year between 2000 and 2004 
(Locsin, 2006). In addition to customer contact services, the Philippines exports back-office services, 
software services and medical transcription services. In 2005, some 150,000 workers provided US$ 2 
billion worth of BPS mainly to foreign markets. An additional 12,000 workers provided US$ 0.2 billion TD/TC/WP(2007)2/FINAL 36 worth of ITS exports. In total, four-fifths of BPS and ITS services were exported in 2004 and the great 
majority of these services were supplied by subsidiaries of foreign multinationals. 38 Table 2. Revenue and workforce data in the BPS and ITS sectors, 2004-2006E Revenue (US$ mn)

U.S. clients captured approximately 90 percent of Philippine BPS exports. Foreign client markets 
for ITS are more geographically dispersed with EU, Japan and United States as main export markets. 39 For 
call centres services, 87 percent of export revenue was derived from U.S. clients in Q3 2005 (Aquino, 
2006). The Philippine customer contact industry is to a large extent made up of U.S.-based multinationals 
that provide call centre services from captive units. But a growing number of Philippine, Asian and 
European companies also use the Philippines as a base for call centre services. The country is heavily 
dependent on the Metro Manila area which supplies some 80 percent of exports. The Philippine 
government is working together with domestic industry associations to develop strategies to geographically 
diversify the supply capacity (more on this below). 120. 
Labour arbitrage aside, a main reason why a country like the Philippines is so successful at 
attracting contact centre work is that the BPS sector can attract highly qualified graduates for work that in 
the OECD-area is provided by low-skilled workers and characterised by low wages, low productivity and 
high staff attrition. For example in the United States, the average call centre agent stay with the employer 
for less than six months while in the Philippines, the average call centre agent stays for two years or more. 
Companies such as eTelecare Global Solutions continuously invest in training and retention and keep their 
Philippine call centre agents for much longer. Low staff attrition and high quality manpower are 
compelling factors that have led the world's multinational call centre companies to invest heavily in the 
country. 40 38 This estimate is based on calculation by the OED Secretariat using data from Mapa (2006) and Aquino (2006). 39 The information was obtained at meetings with industry associations. 40 The Philippine BPS sector has penetrated as far as to the WTO in Geneva: WTO's online training modules are 
checked by Philippine teachers and assistants (Mapa, 2006). TD/TC/WP(2007)2/FINAL 37 121. 
The Philippines is also becoming an offshore centre for finance and accounting tasks associated 
with high levels of standardisation. 41 Philippine national standards and practice adhered to the U.S.-based 
Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) until January 1 2005, and since then to International 
Accounting Standards (IAS) (Locsin, 2006). About 100,000 students graduate every year in accounting, 
finance, management and other related subjects and the country produces 2,500-3,000 new certified 
accountants annually. Box 6. International outsourcing offers new business opportunities International outsourcing offers a growing number of feasible business opportunities due to labour cost arbitrage. 
These new business opportunities are seldom acknowledged and difficult to quantify but still part of the offshoring 
equation. For example, a large car manufacturer recently started to provide a GPS star positioning system for a 
monthly subscription fee. A Philippine call centre was hired to initiate an outbound calling campaign to contact 
new car owners with offers of the GPS deal. Old customers were also contacted and offered new services packages 
and information if they did not make use of the GPS service during the first three months of their subscription. 
Many companies consider outbound calling campaigns to be efficient tools to increase the life-time value of a 
customer. But they are often economically unviable to initiate from high-income countries. International 
outsourcing opens up a whole set of new innovative business models due to significant cost advantages. The Role of the Philippine government in attracting foreign investment 122. 
The Philippine government and the Philippine Board of Investment (BOI) agency are generally 
perceived as supportive of the country's BPS and ITS sectors. The government has in the past initiated a 
number of projects to reduce barriers to investment and it is currently cooperating with the industry 
associations, including the Business Processing Association Philippines (BPA/P) and the Philippine 
Software Industry Association (PSIA), to improve education in areas that are key to the industry and 
increase industry standards in terms of data privacy and security. 123. 
Some early initiatives were aimed at attracting foreign direct investment. Chief among these was 
legislation allowing 100 percent ownership of BPS and ITS entities established by foreign companies in 
the Philippines. Another initiative was to lower the minimum office-space requirement imposed by the 
Philippine Economic Zone Authority (PEZA). PEZA was established in 1995 and initially required 25 
hectares of dedicated space to create a special economic zone (SEZ)/industrial park. In 1999, the minimum 
space requirement for IT parks was reduced from 25 hectares to 15 hectares. In 2000, IT buildings 
benefiting from PEZA's policy were allowed if the available office area covered a minimum of 20,000 m 2 . 
According to Locsin (2006), the minimum space requirement by PEZA is now 5,000 m 2 . 124. 
Companies that locate in PEZA buildings benefit from a number of financial incentives and 
administrative support. The benefit packages include streamlined registration for incorporation, which has 
been reduced to three working days (the average numbers of days to setup a company in the Philippines 
was 48 days in 2005 – see Annex C). Companies can also enjoy 4 to 8 years of income tax holiday, 
unrestricted use of consigned equipment, deductions for labour expenses and training expenses (both up to 
50 percent) and exemptions from wharfage dues. IT park developers also enjoy tax and duty exemptions on 
imported capital equipment and exemption from the 10-percent input VAT on allowable local purchase of 
goods and services (Locsin, 2006). 41 These services include general accounting and bookkeeping services, accounts maintenance, accounts receivable 
collection, invoice and accounts payable administration, claims processing, expense and revenue reporting, sales 
auditing, payroll services, asset management/accounting, financial analysis and auditing, inventory control and 
purchasing, and tax reporting. TD/TC/WP(2007)2/FINAL 38 125. 
The main priority is now to improve the quality of education. The current administration of 
President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo reversed a decision by its predecessor to only promote the use of 
Filipino in schools. This decision was impairing the export-oriented BPS and ITS industry for which 
English proficiency is the strongest comparative advantage. The new initiatives include programmes to 
enhance teachers' English proficiency and communication skills and they are developing elective courses 
that may cater to students interested in a career in the BPS or ITS fields. The aim is also to improve the 
analytical skills of students and there are several industry-academic joint programmes to enhance the 
quality of IT professionals. 126. 
The BOI has commissioned two councils that in conjunction with the private sector are 
developing guidelines on the protection of data privacy and security. The objectives of these projects are to 
ensure minimum standards on data protection, to pre-empt accidents and counteract protectionism. The 
councils are cooperating with the Information Technology Association of America (ITAA) to address 
potential issues. The first council is developing voluntary guidelines for the industry to follow until the 
second council has produced and passed a legal bill on data protection (expected in 2007) (see Lipana and 
Cooper, 2005). 127. 
Another large-scale initiative is the investment in a 600 km long telecommunications corridor. 
Towns can be connected to this ICT backbone if they fulfil a number of criteria aimed at establishing a 
sustainable and business-friendly environment. The project has set a target of generating one million jobs 
by 2010. To achieve this goal the government estimates that it will need investment of US$ 6-7 billion to 
upgrade the infrastructure. There are several objectives related to this geographic diversification. First, 
more regions in the Philippines will get access to the business opportunities of international sourcing and 
this should result in more even economic development. Second, it will limit future salary inflation and 
poaching of staff frequent in the Metro Manila area; and third, the ICT backbone will increase access to the 
labour pool in the country. 128. 
Some critics argue that the Philippine government should refrain from favouring one industry 
over another and rather focus its resources on improving the overall business climate in the Philippines. 
The BPS and ITS sectors are already some of the least affected by the regulatory and institutional 
inefficiencies prevalent in the country – see Annex C – and the high levels of corruption that is plaguing 
domestic business is not a big issue to export-oriented BPS and ITS companies. While some observers 
argue that the current incentive packages fail to benefit the many small domestic companies that can ill 
afford to locate in PEZA buildings, where rents are high, others (e.g. Beshouri and Farrell, 2005) argue that 
the Philippines would do best by investing its resources in improving infrastructure and education rather 
that offering tax breaks to multinationals. The same argument would hold for China and India. 129. 
In general, the environment in which the industry operates is generally perceived as conducive to 
do business and the action taken by the Philippine government to reduce investment barriers and 
administrative red tape has helped the industry flourish. TD/TC/WP(2007)2/FINAL 39 Box 7. SPi – a home-grown success story Founded in the Philippines in 1980 and the first publicly listed Philippine IT company, SPi (previously SPI 
Technologies) is arguably the Philippines' most successful home-grown BPS company. Its 11,000 employees – 
4,500 in voice-based BPS and 6,500 in non-voice based BPS – in Asia, United States and Europe provide a broad 
portfolio of business process solutions related to content and data requirements in the publishing, legal, healthcare, 
content management, and transaction processing industries. SPi's main services offerings cover digital content 
conversion (transferring data from paper to electronic databases), litigation support, journal and book production 
(typesetting, copy-editing, illustration scanning and page formatting services), medical transcription, call centre 
(including inbound, outbound, sales and customer care applications) and software maintenance and development. SPi has established a 1,000 strong workforce in Coimbatore, Pondicherry, Kolkata, New Delhi and Chennai in 
India and plans to continue to expand its Indian presence: e.g. it recently acquired Indian KGISTL's medical 
transcription unit serving the U.S. healthcare industry. The company also has services centres in Vietnam and 
China and in April 2005, the company announced plans to invest US$ 50 million to extend its services capabilities 
in the Philippines and the United States. Geographic differentiation is a significant advantage since work can be 
located to where it makes most financial sense. For example in the past SPi had a 1,500 strong workforce in the 
Philippines doing basic data entry work. Today virtually all those functions have migrated to places like Vietnam 
and China. Most Philippine BPS companies are sub-contractors to U.S.-based companies and lack sales and marketing 
organisations in client countries. SPi has established its own sales and marketing channels in the United States and 
it has been particularly successful at building in-house capabilities which has made the company less sensitive to 
external price pressure. Compared to many other Philippine third party BPS providers, SPi has gotten the business 
model right and developed a mature, quality conscious organisation with high visibility abroad. Source: Huang (2005) and www.spitech.com. Challenges to the Philippine BPS and ITS sectors in supplying international markets 130. 
The Philippine BPS and ITS sectors are dominated by captive units, or cost-covering 
subsidiaries, of foreign multinationals. The BPS sector is young but has already developed into a US$ 2 
billion industry and a destination of choice for voice-based BPS to English-speaking markets. Some home-
grown companies – like SPi and eTelecare Global Solutions – have grown into internationally recognised 
multinationals in the BPS field. The ITS sector was founded in the 1980s and has yet to develop any 
significant export capabilities. As in the Czech Republic, the Philippine ITS sector could potentially 
develop expertise in certain niche markets but is not likely to become a sizeable provider to foreign 
markets in the foreseeable future. 131. 
Arguably the main reason why the BPS sector has thrived – next to the comparative advantages 
mentioned above – is the relative ease with which Philippine companies can supply services to the United 
States. The Philippine government has provided incentives and facilitated market entry but refrained from 
interfering in the industry. Most home-grown BPS and ITS companies belong to the SME category and 
face challenges unrelated to domestic or foreign regulations. The challenges are rather related to 
recruitment and retention of staff, developing mature and sustainable business models, and convincing 
foreign clients that the risks of political instability is unlikely to affect business. Country risk has a 
negative impact on business and political stability and sustained order are paramount to the BPS sector, 
which provides real-time services all year round. 132. 
It is only during the last few years that the BPS and ITS sectors have orchestrated an effort to 
market themselves abroad. The foreign multinationals that make up much of the sector have no incentives 
to sell the Philippines as a location for outsourced BPS and ITS. However, the establishment of the 
umbrella organisation BPA/P, which covers six other industry-specific associations, and its cooperation TD/TC/WP(2007)2/FINAL 40 with the BOI under the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) is already raising the industry's visibility. 
This is necessary since few Philippine companies have sales and marketing channels abroad: most 
companies work with foreign partners working on commission, which is seldom a viable business model. Supply-side constraints Recruitment and retention 133. 
The BPS and ITS sectors are people-driven. As such, the hunt for the best available talent is 
constantly top priority for companies and the main challenge in daily work. According to BPA/P, a 
shortage of suitable labour is the single most pressing issue facing the Philippine BPS and ITS sectors. The 
country produces some 70,000 graduates annually with computer-related degrees but only 12,000 
professionals in total worked in the export-oriented ITS sector in 2005 (Locsin, 2006). One reason why the 
ITS industry has failed to take off is the relatively modest quality of Philippine students in mathematics 
and science (Rodolfo, 2005). Several IT companies believe the Philippine government needs to set 
minimum quality standards in higher technical education. There is otherwise a risk that students who invest 
in IT-related education will face unemployment or be underemployed in adjacent low-value sectors. 134. 
Another reason why the ITS sector has struggled is that many software professionals with 4-5 
years of work experience leave the Philippines to work abroad and few tend to return. This limits the 
domestic supply of professionals with high-level technical expertise and managerial competence. The 
relative youth of the industry has also led to a scarcity of experienced managers with sector-specific 
expertise. The captive units of foreign multinationals are best situated to capture the domain expertise and 
middle management talent that stay in the Philippines. While barriers to enter the ITS market are relatively 
low, the actual costs and expertise required to serve foreign markets are high. 135. 
The quality certifications (e.g. ISO, SEI CMM and SEI CMMi) that ITS companies can obtain to 
improve the quality and maturity of their work and use to market their quality services work both for and 
against the Philippine ITS sector. Today, large clients normally demand these types of certification to 
evaluate a company's process maturity. However, these quality certificates are costly and time-consuming 
to obtain and most Philippine companies have ignored this important marketing tool. The situation is 
similar to the one in the Czech industry. Some executives note that as the market for internationally 
outsourced ITS matures, entry barriers pile up in the form of more stringent data privacy and security 
requirements, and higher demand for process quality certification, scalability and investment in training, 
etc. But these entry barriers are industry-imposed and a result of increasing international competition. 136. 
The supply-side constraints in the expanding BPS sector have led to strong salary inflation for 
call centre workers. Philippine customer contact centres target a thin slice of available talent since most 
graduates are unsuited for customer interaction requiring a high-level of language proficiency and 
communication skills. As a result, the starting salary for a call centre worker is higher than the starting 
salary for a medical doctor, accountant or software programmer. In 2005, the base salary for English 
speaking call centre workers was 14-16,000 pesos/month with additional supplements for night-shift and 
performance-based bonuses. Contact centre workers with a second language like Japanese or Spanish can 
obtain twice the base salary of an English-speaking call centre worker. One industry executive provided 
the following estimates for young professionals' monthly starting salaries: @BULLET Software developer in domestic industry: 12,000 pesos; @BULLET Software developer in foreign multinational: 18,000 pesos; @BULLET English-speaking call centre agent: 14-16,000 pesos + performance-based bonus; @BULLET Japanese or Spanish-speaking call centre agent: 20-25,000 pesos + performance-based bonus TD/TC/WP(2007)2/FINAL 41 137. 
The salary inflation has made contact centre work an attractive first job for many graduates: or, to 
cite an executive with many years of experience in both the Indian and Philippine call centre sector:  " …the 
call centre job is today a low-level yuppie kind of thing in Asia. It's a good job to take home 20,000 
pesos/month, it is impressive. "  A base salary of 15,000 pesos is just below US$ 300 and with added 
incentive programmes, rights allowance and a 13 th month of salary in December, the total pay is high 
compared to other professions. But the rapid growth of the industry is creating recruitment problems. Five 
years ago, to recruit one qualified BPS worker, a Philippine company needed to screen around 25-30 
people. To recruit a person today, the same company may need to interview 60-80 applicants. A common 
worry is that limited English proficiency will restrict the industry's growth potential and increase 
investments in screening and training. In a survey conducted by O2P and BPA/P (2006), enhancing 
English proficiency is the area, after improving the political situation and the country's external image, 
where the Philippine government can aid the industry most. 42 138. 
SMEs face the toughest challenges. Many of the small BPS companies suffer from irregular 
revenue flows and rely on workers with short-term project-based contracts. This approach may be one of 
the few viable ways to tackle a volatile business environment and Philippine labour laws become stringent 
when a worker has been employed for more than six months. But short-term employment does not only 
raise job uncertainty and staff attrition, it also reduces the incentives for companies to invest in their 
employees and develop in-house expertise. The issue is aggravated since it takes considerable time to reach 
adequate productivity levels that are needed to cultivate long-term business relations. 139. 
The export-oriented software sector is small and relatively immature but growth may pick up if 
the government manages to improve teaching and upgrade the technical curriculum in schools. The private 
sector has started to assist in enhancing the skills of IT graduates by providing teaching material and 
training teachers. BPA/P is also lobbying the government to increase the communication and language 
proficiency of students and teachers. Regulatory challenges 140. 
While there is much room to improve the domestic business environment, the BPS and ITS 
sectors are better off than most other industries in the Philippines. The World Bank's doing business 
indicators (see Annex C) show the inefficient process of starting and closing businesses, the slow process 
of enforcing contracts and the weak protection of investors. However, the special policy that covers 
companies operating in PEZA-certified buildings help companies circumvent most challenges related to 
domestic regulations. The BPS and ITS sectors also face few challenges related to foreign regulations. In 
the past, new U.S. regulations have even given rise to entire new services industries (see Box 8). The few 
regulatory challenges that still exist are related to restrictions to movement of service workers and security 
of information. 42 While electricity provision is more stable than in for example India, Beshouri and Farell (2005) note that Philippine 
electricity prices are 43 percent higher than in India and 65 percent higher than in China. TD/TC/WP(2007)2/FINAL 42 Box 8. The Philippine medical transcription sector The medical transcription sector in the Philippines is young, relatively small and the fastest growing 
business line in the Philippine BPS sector. It employed some 5,500 people in 2005 and many are 
working from home in family businesses. The sector was created following the enactment in the U.S. 
Congress in 1996 of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). This Act 
requires medical institutions to keep digital records of patients. It also requires the establishment of 
national standards for electronic health care transactions and its provisions address the security and 
privacy of health data. The hospitals and health clinics that outsource some of their business processes 
to a third party must ensure that the service provider has a framework in place to comply with HIPAA 
requirements. The establishment of the medical transcription industry in the Philippine can be dated to year 2000 when 
an American company established a captive unit to provide transcription services. At its peak, the 
company employed 700 people but it was soon acquired by another U.S. company which decided to 
move all its activities to India. Facing unemployment, some of the workers started their own businesses 
to serve the U.S. market and these companies now make up most of the Philippine medical transcription 
sector. Approximately 90 percent of the U.S. market for transcription services is captured by domestic 
companies but the U.S. labour pool has shrunk annually by a few percent. The job is low-paid and few 
consider it a real career in the United States. International sourcing has proven an attractive solution to 
American health clinics and India has captured approximately 10 percent of the U.S. market. The 
Philippine medical transcription industry currently has less than 1 percent of the U.S. market. Medical transcription companies operate 24/7 whereas call centres operate mostly during night. 
Typically a company receives an audio record with dictation and a short note about a patient. It then 
transcribes and puts together a report including analysis within hours before sending it back to the client. 
Hospitals get the reports within 6-12 hours. There are two main concerns: labour supply and compliance 
with HIPAA data privacy and security requirements. The Medical Transcription Industry Association of 
the Philippines is currently working on establishing HIPAA compliance certification for the local 
industry to enhance transparency and standards. Source: Bel Reyes of the Medical Transcription Industry Association of the Philippines (MTIAPI). Restrictions on temporary movement of service professionals 141. 
The Philippine BPS and ITS sectors are mainly made up of foreign multinationals and these 
companies circulate few professionals between the Philippines and their home or client countries. Those 
professionals that are employed by foreign multinationals have few restrictions to movement since 
employees can obtain intra-corporate work permits. In addition, most service workers are employed in the 
contact centre sector, which seldom circulates its employees. However, the challenges related to the 
movement of natural persons are more prevalent among some of the home-grown, export-oriented ITS 
companies. While these are few at present, those who face restrictions are subject to the same challenges as 
the Indian software professionals: quota limitations, documentation burden, and time and unpredictability 
issues related to the application process of business visas and work permits. 142. 
Most Philippine ITS companies have adopted a business model that is different from most Indian 
companies. Philippine companies usually partner with companies in client countries that do sales and 
marketing and take care of the onsite work component. Other companies choose to bring their clients to the 
Philippines to minimise costs and reduce some of the hassle with visas and work permits. While some 
companies report that they do turn down occasional business opportunities because of the lead time to 
obtain visas and work permits, concerns related to the limited size of Philippine companies are more 
frequently raised. TD/TC/WP(2007)2/FINAL 43 143. 
Several Indian BPS and ITS companies have negotiated with the Philippine authorities about 
establishing development centres in the Philippines and some of the larger players have established 
subsidiaries in Manila. There is a constraint, however, to Indian FDI because Indian citizens are 
categorised as a  " restricted nationality "  by Philippine law. This regulation provides a very small quota for 
the number of Indians allowed to visit the Philippines each year. Restrictions to South-South trade are 
often significant but tend to receive scant attention. Several nationalities are restricted from entering the 
Philippines under this policy. Restrictions on movement of information 144. 
The regulations related to data privacy and security that affect the Philippine BPS and ITS sectors 
are the same as those affecting their Indian colleagues (and presented above). But the Philippine companies 
are more dependent on the U.S. market. Regulations do not only result in overhead costs but can also 
provide significant business opportunities: e.g. the HIPAA law in the United States requires medical 
institutions to keep digital records of patients and this regulation initiated the medical transcription industry 
which is quickly expanding in India and the Philippines. 145. 
The Philippine companies interviewed for this study report that data privacy and security 
legislation has produced some useful industry standards: they may be costly to comply with but that is not 
an issue since they affect companies equally. Clients demand information security assurances that exceed 
those of national legislations and service providers comply in order to be in business. TD/TC/WP(2007)2/FINAL 44 MAIN FINDINGS AND CONCLUDING REMARKS Market characteristics and trade 146. 
The country case studies of the BPS and ITS sectors in China, the Czech Republic, India and the 
Philippines illustrated how emerging markets are being integrated in the global services supply chains in 
OECD economies. In 2005, the combined export revenue of the four countries came to an estimated US$ 
8.7 billion for BPS and US$ 14.5 billion for ITS. OECD economies captured most of these exports. 43 The 
amounts may seem modest compared to the four countries combined exports of merchandise trade (US$ 
948 billion) but the economic contribution of the BPS and ITS sectors in India and the Philippines has 
increased significantly. 147. 
India is leading the way among the emerging markets with its mature and internationally 
competitive ITS sector. The Indian ITS sector has managed to create a highly successful industry based on 
the global delivery model that has been continuously enhanced over the last decade. It has substantial 
exports to both North America and Europe but depends heavily on Anglophone markets. There are signs 
that China is becoming the offshore destination of choice for Japanese companies. However, it remains to 
be seen whether any emerging economy can come close to rival India in size in the future. 148. 
The market for internationally sourced BPS is young, fast growing and competition is more even 
between the four countries. India is the largest supplier but the Philippines has become a strong contender 
for services in English, in particular for voice-based services. All four countries are likely to continue to 
expand their export-oriented BPS sectors in the near future. Some trend-setting multinationals already use 
all four countries to deliver BPS to different geographies where they have a comparative advantage. 149. 
The following conclusions can be drawn from the country case studies: " The BPS and ITS sectors in the four countries have different client focus: while only 10-15 percent 
of BPS and ITS supply is exported in China and the Czech Republic, almost 80 percent of Indian 
and Philippine BPS and ITS are delivered to clients abroad. " Language and cultural proximity are decisive factors in international supply of BPS and ITS. From 
a trade perspective, the Chinese and Czech BPS and ITS sectors are mainly used as nearshore 
supply centres for companies in East Asia and Europe respectively. The Indian and Philippine BPS 
and ITS sectors are both offshore supply centres for more distant markets. o Czech export markets are based in the EU, including the UK and neighbouring Austria, 
Germany and Slovakia; o Chinese exports are to a large extent captured by Japan (around two-thirds of total). Other 
export markets include Korea, the United States and the Asia-Pacific region; 43 The Indian financial year covers 1 April 2005 to 31 March 2006. TD/TC/WP(2007)2/FINAL 45 o Indian export markets are predominantly the United States (66 percent) and UK (14 
percent). Other export markets include Japan, Singapore and Germany; o Philippine exports are captured by the United States (90 percent). Other English-speaking 
countries make up much of the rest; " Trade in BPS and ITS is dominated by OECD-based multinationals but home-grown companies in 
non-OECD economies are rising in prominence: o Czech BPS and ITS exports are mostly provided by foreign multinationals; o Philippine BPS and ITS exports are mainly provided by foreign multinationals. Home-
grown companies are increasingly providing BPS and ITS services to foreign markets; o Chinese BPS and ITS exports are provided by both home-grown and foreign companies; o Indian BPS exports are provided equally by home-grown and foreign companies while 
home-grown companies provide two-thirds of Indian ITS exports; " The four countries have developed different export-related capabilities in the BPS and ITS field: o The Czech Republic is mainly used as a centre for BPS and software application 
development; o China has developed capabilities at the opposite ends of the value chain: it is strong at low-
end BPS and ITS work, such as data entry and testing services, while foreign 
multinationals increasingly use it as a base for high-end R&D services; o India is dominating the BPS field and pushing the boundaries for the type of services that 
can be traded through cross-border supply. From an offshoring point of view, it is a full 
service provider. In the ITS field, India is strong at software application development and 
application maintenance services. It is in the nascent stages of developing strengths in 
system integration and IT consulting; o The Philippines is presently strong in BPS supply and in particular voice-based services. Trade-related and business-related challenges 150. 
The most pressing challenges in the export-oriented BPS and ITS sectors relate to preoccupations 
such as developing efficient operations, managing complexity in international client relationships, 
establishing marketing and sales channels abroad, etc. The industry is facing relatively few barriers related 
to regulations at home and in client countries. However, recruiting, training and retaining professionals are 
major challenges in the industry. BPS and ITS companies can generally overcome the administrative 
hurdles in local business environments thanks to special export-oriented zones where excessive red tape is 
removed and gaps in infrastructure are bridged. Yet heavy investment in such zones would be unnecessary 
if governments took action to improve the overall business environment and liberalised markets for key 
input services. Additional challenges relate to temporary movement of service workers in the ITS sector 
and data regulations in the BPS sector. Recruitment and retention " The four countries face considerable supply side constraints in their quest to provide BPS and ITS 
to international markets. The supply side constraints are most challenging in the ITS sector. The 
issue is less severe for foreign multinationals that pay a wage premium to recruit top talent. Work 
in the four countries' BPS and ITS sectors attract highly skilled workers. This is in sharp contrast TD/TC/WP(2007)2/FINAL 46 to some of the BPS work in OECD countries, in particular in the voice-based field, where work is 
poorly paid and attrition high. o Recruitment and retention of junior personnel: although China, India and the Philippines 
produce large numbers of university graduates, few are suited to work in the industry and 
serve foreign clients. Most graduates have inadequate language skills, communication 
skills and business acumen for client interaction, and lack the necessary level of technical 
training. Yet the levels of remuneration entice many university students and graduates to 
look for opportunities in the industry. It takes significant investment in the recruitment 
process to identify the right workers. In the ITS sector, it also takes significant investment 
in training. Hence, staff retention is crucial given that new professionals become 
productive with experience. Staff attrition is high in the BPS sector and for many 
companies in the ITS sector as well. o Recruitment and retention of senior personnel: the export-oriented BPS and ITS sectors 
have existed only for a few years in China, the Czech Republic and the Philippines. The 
industry has had little time to nurture project managers and senior managers with industry-
specific experience. Those that are available work to a large extent for foreign 
multinationals. As a result, many companies recruit senior personnel from abroad and this 
practise comes at a high cost. The situation is extra challenging in China where the 
industry to a large extent relies on the returning Chinese Diaspora. The situation is less of a 
problem in India where the industry has had more time to build capacity. Strong demand 
has resulted in rapid salary inflation for experienced professionals. Regulatory challenges " Regulatory and administrative challenges in the domestic business environments of the studied 
countries are considerable except in the Czech Republic. The challenges affect both home-grown 
and foreign companies that operate in China, India and the Philippines. While domestic service 
markets are highly protected in the three Asian countries, the development of a strong domestic 
export-oriented industry is high on the agenda of governments. The negative effect of the local 
business environment on export-oriented BPS and ITS companies is greatly reduced in the 
environments that they operate: the software and technology parks/buildings that host the 
companies generally offer ready-to-use infrastructure in terms of office space, utility services and 
ICT services; streamlined business administration and financial incentives. Policies that target the 
investment climate in specific industries may be unfair to other industries in the economy. But 
their impact on the local BPS and ITS sectors studied in this paper has been positive. " In the ITS sector, temporary movement of personnel between home country and client country can 
pose significant challenges in the business of international outsourcing. The issue is most pertinent 
for the Indian ITS sector which to a large extent is dependent on a global delivery model that sends 
professionals for longer visits to client premises. Unpredictable, slow and costly administrative 
procedures for business visas and work permits, and quota limitations for work permits have 
become serious issues for some companies. " In the BPS sector, and to a lesser extent in the ITS sector, certain data privacy and security 
legislation can have a negative effect on international outsourcing. New regulations have also 
created entirely new business opportunities, as seen in the medical transcription sector. Data 
privacy and security regulations are not necessarily regarded as negative as long as they are non-
discriminatory in nature. Technological solutions allow companies in most instances to comply 
with the rules and clients generally require their suppliers to live up to standards that are higher 
than existing legislation. TD/TC/WP(2007)2/FINAL 47 Table 3. Summary: Selected market indicators and trade profiles, 2005 44 China

Low * 2004. 44 Some of the data presented in this table are best available estimates and are presented due to the lack of other comprehensive and authoritative data sources. The 
sources of the data are presented in the country chapters. For India,  " 2005 "  refers to the period 1 April 2005 – 31 March 2006. 45 The combined domestic and export-oriented industry employed around 900,000 workers. Some US$ 960 million of the country's US$ 8.7 billion software 
development services market was exported. US$ 320 million of BPS was exported. A rough estimate is that 0.1-0.2 million workers are employed in the sector. 46 The figure is estimated from data presented by Nasscom (2006). The combined workforce in the export-oriented sectors of ITS, engineering and R&D, and 
software products was an estimated 0.51 million in March 2006. Revenue generated in the ITS sector made up 75 percent of total revenue in the combined sectors. 
75 percent of 0.51 million is 0.38 million. TD/TC/WP(2007)2/FINAL 48 Additional thoughts In the future, more and more BPS and ITS multinationals will do business where they do it best and where 
it makes most financial sense. This is likely to imply, among other things, that: o The very great majority of service workers in the BPS and ITS sectors will continue to be based 
within close proximity of their clients; o The supply of BPS and ITS will have a more international footprint: @BULLET OECD-based multinationals will boost their presence in emerging markets, which will 
allow them to tap into rapidly growing domestic markets for outsourced services and gain 
access to a global talent pool. International outsourcing will with time give rise to entire 
new service sectors due to the multitude of business models that become economically 
viable; @BULLET Leading BPS and ITS companies in emerging markets will move into OECD markets to 
establish local supply capacity when the limited markets for more easily  " offshoreable "  
services get saturated. As a result, more and more workers in OECD countries will work 
for companies originating in non-OECD countries; o Intensified competition for traded services will allow more companies to increase productivity 
through the procurement of better and cheaper services -which in turn will help stimulate growth 
in IT-intensive industries; o The increasing integration of emerging markets in international supply chains will stimulate 
economic growth in these countries and endow them with home-grown IT expertise necessary to 
help bridge some of the productivity gaps with OECD markets; o South-south trade is just starting to take off in the BPS and ITS sectors and will expand rapidly in 
the future. International sourcing of ITS and some potential implications for labour markets 151. 
OECD (2005a) has previously identified the main adjustment challenges that OECD economies 
may face due to the integration of non-OECD economies in international supply chains. In particular it 
examined the prospective effect on EU and U.S. labour markets and concluded that the practice of 
international sourcing can be mutually beneficial for low-income and high-income countries alike but open 
markets are essential to reap the gains and to manage adjustment. Of equal importance is a well 
functioning labour market that facilitates labour adjustment resulting from trade liberalisation and rapid 
technology diffusion. 152. 
While trade in BPS and ITS is predominantly conducted between OECD countries, these services 
are increasingly traded between OECD and non-OECD countries. 47 Depending on overall growth in the 
service sectors in question, international sourcing could potentially result in a net job loss for some 
occupations or a slower pace of job expansion than would otherwise occur. OECD (2005a) concluded that 
adjustment pressure while real is likely to remain modest in OECD labour markets. There are several 
reasons for this: 47 See OECD (2004a) for an extensive discussion. TD/TC/WP(2007)2/FINAL 49 1. Most BPS and ITS services will remain non-tradable since their provision requires face-to-face 
interaction, frequent communication or proximity to clients. 2. The various predictions of job losses resulting from international sourcing are minor in relation to 
the overall destruction and creation of jobs in labour markets. 3. International sourcing is a positive sum situation: many jobs are kept and created during the 
international sourcing process while efficiency gains are transferred to consumers in terms of lower 
prices or re-invested in new business opportunities. 4. The labour-cost arbitrage incentive is becoming less pronounced as low-income country service 
providers export increasingly sophisticated services at higher prices. 153. 
Much analytical work has been presented on the impact of offshoring in the BPS and ITS sectors 
in OECD economies. Some studies have tried to estimate the outer limits of total service jobs that could 
potentially face international competition. 48 These estimates indicate that the great majority of service jobs 
will remain unaffected by international competition. Depending on the assumptions on which the 
assessments rely, estimates have varied between 5 percent and 19 percent. However, what can possibly be 
supplied from a remote location is very different from what can be supplied with adequate service quality 
and with an economically compelling business model. Some services (or fragments of services) that can 
easily be identified, digitised and standardised may be traded in the future. But most work tasks do not 
match such a profile and it makes remote cross-border supply more complex, and hence more costly, to 
manage. 154. 
Some studies have tried to predict the number of jobs that is likely to be provided through cross-
border supply in the future. 49 Other studies have tried to quantify the economic impact of international 
sourcing on a country level. 50 These quantification exercises have generally concluded that the initial 
worries that offshoring of services will have serious consequences for OECD labour markets are largely 
unfounded. 51 Emerging markets will increase their share of world trade in BPS and ITS and the economic 
gains, on balance, can be significant in both importing and exporting countries. Many developing countries 
have realised the new business opportunities that this type of trade give rise to and some are pursuing a 
more active agenda of liberalising service markets. However, while international trade in BPS and ITS can 
bring significant gains to both sides of the transaction, it is likely to reduce the demand for certain job 
categories in OECD economies. The scope for labour market adjustment in the ITS sector 52 155. 
Some of the most pressing issues for BPS and ITS companies that operate in emerging markets 
are related to supply-side constraints. The McKinsey Global Institute has presented a series of 
comprehensive studies that examine the supply and demand for labour in a number of service sectors 
(MGI, 2005a-b). They forecast that the annual growth rate for ITS spending in the 2003-2008 period will 48 See e.g. Blinder (2005), van Welsum and Vickery (2005), Bardhan and Kroll (2003), ILO (2001) and World Bank 
(1995). See also the discussion presented by Bhagwati et al. (2004). 49 See Engman (2005) for an overview. MGI (2005c) 50 See e.g. Blanco et al. (2005), Mann (2003), MGI (2003, 2004), Evalueserve (2003, 2004), Deloitte Research 
(2003). 51 See e.g. WTO (2005), OECD (2005a), Bhagwati et al. (2004), Drezner (2004). 52 In 2005, ITS exports in China, the Czech Republic, India and the Philippines made up 60 percent of combined BPS 
and ITS exports. TD/TC/WP(2007)2/FINAL 50 be 4 percent in Western Europe, 5 percent in the United States, and 9 percent in the Asia Pacific region. 53 
The figures imply that the combined demand for ITS in the main markets for these services will grow by 
some US$ 20 billion annually. This is significantly more than the combined value of all ITS exports from 
China, the Czech Republic, India and the Philippines. 156. 
Competition from emerging markets is almost exclusively concentrated in the field of custom 
application development and application maintenance, and to a lesser extent in system integration. In 2006, 
an estimated 10 percent of demand for ITS employment in high-income countries was covered by low-cost 
countries. This share is expected to increase in the future but due to the expected rise in demand for ITS, 
annual ITS employment in high-income countries is expected to grow by 1 percent per year between 2003 
and 2008. 157. 
While the pressure on overall ITS employment is likely to be modest, there may well be cost 
pressure for certain types of services, and shifts in demand for ITS job occupations, as OECD-based 
companies refocus their operations on higher value services. 54 In the United States, which is the largest 
importer of BPS and ITS from emerging markets, the share of high-value ITS occupations (system 
analysts, software engineers) have expanded while mid-value (software programmers, database/network 
administrators) and low-value ITS occupations (computer support specialists, programmer aides) have 
contracted (MGI, 2005a-b). This trend is in line with the growth in offshoring of low-value work to cost-
effective countries in Asia. 158. 
The recruitment challenges in China, India and the Philippines stem from the fact that relatively 
few graduates have the set of skills to work for foreign multinationals or serve international markets. 
Figure 5, which is based on interviews with 83 human resource managers of multinationals, reveals that 
only one in ten Chinese engineers have the necessary profile for employment. A somewhat higher share of 
engineers is suitable for work in multinationals in India and the Philippines and more so in the Czech 
Republic. Both the Czech Republic and the Philippines have rather strong competence in finance and 
accounting. Figure 6 illustrates that the limited profiles of young professionals in China and India 
drastically reduce the available talent pools. Hence the large populations of countries like China and India 
do not commensurate with the number of service professionals that they can provide. Quantity is not the 
problem in these countries – quality is. 53 According to their findings, the United States accounted for roughly 41 percent of worldwide demand of ITS, 
followed by 13 percent in Japan and 7 percent in Germany. Employment in the ITS sector accounted for 1.2 percent 
of non-agricultural employment in Western Europe, 1.3 percent in the United States, and 0.9 percent in Japan. 54 Many OECD countries do not import BPS and ITS from the countries studied in this paper. TD/TC/WP(2007)2/FINAL 51 Figure 5. Young professionals suited to work

Forthcoming OECD (2006c) work will provide a comprehensive analysis of trade and labour 
market adjustment in the business services sector. It will analyse the interaction between trade, trade policy 
and technology in shaping employment patterns, labour turnover and relative wages. It will also analyse 
how trade and labour market policies can facilitate structural adjustment while reducing trade-and FDI-
related adjustment costs. TD/TC/WP(2007)2/FINAL 52 REFERENCES Analysys International (AI) (2006a),  " China Software Industry to Grow 30% Over Next 5 Years " ,
