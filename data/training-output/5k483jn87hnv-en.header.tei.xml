	<note type="other">OECD GREEN GROWTH PAPERS<lb/> The OECD Green Growth Strategy, launched in May 2011, provides concrete recommendations<lb/> and measurement tools to support countries&apos; efforts to achieve economic growth and<lb/> development, while at the same time ensure that natural assets continue to provide the<lb/> ecosystems services on which our well-being relies. The strategy proposes a flexible policy<lb/> framework that can be tailored to different country circumstances and stages of development.<lb/> OECD Green Growth Papers complement the OECD Green Growth Studies series, and aim to<lb/> stimulate discussion and analysis on specific topics and obtain feedback from interested<lb/> audiences.<lb/> The papers are generally available only in their original language, English, with a summary in the<lb/> other if available.<lb/> OECD Green Growth Papers are published on www.oecd-ilibrary and are also available at<lb/> www.oecd.org/greengrowth<lb/> Please cite this paper as<lb/> Matthieu Glachant (2013), &quot; Greening Global Value Chains: Innovation and the International<lb/> Diffusion of Technologies and Knowledge &quot; , OECD Green Growth Papers, 2013-05, OECD<lb/> Publishing, Paris.<lb/> This paper was commissioned by the World Bank for the Green Growth Knowledge Platform<lb/> (www.greengrowthknowledge.org), a global network of researchers and development experts<lb/> that identifies and addresses major knowledge gaps in green growth theory and practice.

	<div type="abstract">Abstract<lb/> Using novel data on patents, trade of equipment goods, and foreign direct investments and insights<lb/> from the economic literature, the paper seeks to lay out the state of knowledge on the role of<lb/> innovation and the diffusion of technologies in the greening of global value chains as well as some of<lb/> the main policy issues. A special emphasis is put on developing countries – distinguishing emerging<lb/> economies and least-developed countries --and on climate-mitigation technologies.<lb/> Emerging economies are already reasonably well integrated in the global economy. As a<lb/> consequence, technologies flow in through the imports of capital goods and local investments by<lb/> multinational enterprises owning technologies. Pushing further technology transfer requires<lb/> strengthening intellectual property rights, lowering barriers to trade and investments and improving<lb/> technological absorptive capacities. In contrast, their role in innovation is limited. Standard tools of<lb/> innovation policy -public R&amp;D, public support to private R&amp;D, better access to finance -should<lb/> develop. But studies also suggest that governments should introduce more stringent environmental<lb/> policies with proper enforcement at home to go beyond the adoption of foreign technologies.<lb/> The situation of least-developed countries is very different: they do not import green technologies<lb/> and low barriers to trade and FDI or strict intellectual property rights are unlikely to trigger<lb/> technology transfer. In these countries, the focus should be on building technological capacities.<lb/></div>
