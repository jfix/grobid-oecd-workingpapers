            <figDesc>MODULEECR – EARLY CAREER RESEARCH POSITIONS<lb/> If you were in permanent employment, self-employed, unemployed or inactive on 1 December<lb/> &lt;201X&gt;, please skip this module.<lb/> This module addresses persons who were in a temporary research position on 1 December &lt;201X&gt;<lb/> that satisfies most or all of the conditions in question ECR.2. Often, this type of position is referred to as a<lb/> postdoc position. It is generally understood that a postdoc is a temporary position for holders of advanced<lb/> research qualifications (i.e. after finalising their advanced research qualification studies) where the main<lb/> activity is research, and the holder receives some kind of financial support. However, there are very<lb/> different forms of postdoc positions worldwide. In order to assess the extent to which these positions have comparable characteristics, question ECR.2 lists a number of characteristics, which usually correspond to<lb/> this type of position. Please indicate if each of these characteristics corresponds or not to the position you<lb/> held on 1 December &lt;201X&gt; in question ECR.2, and provide the exact title of your position (in your own<lb/> language) in question ECR.3.<lb/> Please use the Fields of Science &amp; Technology Classification (see Classification 1) to reply to<lb/> question ECR.4.<lb/> MODULE EMP – EMPLOYMENT SITUATION<lb/> This module aims to furnish information on the career development of holders of advanced research<lb/> qualifications.</figDesc>
