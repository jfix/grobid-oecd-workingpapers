			<head>ABSTRACT<lb/></head>

			<p>Many countries invest considerable resources into promoting employment and the creation of jobs. At<lb/> the same time, policies and institutions still pay relatively little attention to the quality of jobs although job<lb/> quality has been found to be a major driver of employee wellbeing and may be an important factor for work<lb/> productivity. Eventually, job quality might also influence labour supply choices and lead to higher<lb/> employment. Providing robust evidence for the relationship between job quality and worker productivity<lb/> could make a strong case for labour market policies directed at the improvement of job quality. This paper<lb/> reviews existing evidence on the relationship between the quality of the work environment and individual<lb/> at-work productivity, defined as reduced productivity while at work, and assesses the effect of health on<lb/> this relationship.<lb/></p>

			<p>After screening 2 319 studies from various fields and disciplines, including economics and medicine,<lb/> 48 studies are reviewed. Strong evidence is found for a negative relationship between job stress or job strain<lb/> and individual at-work productivity and for a positive relationship between job rewards and productivity.<lb/> Moderate evidence is found for a negative relationship between work-family conflict and at-work<lb/> productivity and for a positive relationship between fairness at work and social support from co-workers<lb/> and productivity. Health influences the relationship between the quality of the work environment and<lb/> productivity. Specifically, the relationship is stronger for people in good health.<lb/> Job quality needs a more prominent place in labour market policy. More attention needs to be paid to<lb/> workers&apos; perceptions of the quality of their work environment and how policies and practices at both the<lb/> level of the worker and the work environment may influence this. Furthermore, as health-related factors<lb/> significantly influence the relationship between job quality and productivity, multidisciplinary approaches<lb/> are needed to support at-work productivity.<lb/></p>

			<head>RÉSUMÉ<lb/></head>

			<figure>De nombreux pays investissent des ressources considérables dans la promotion de l&apos;emploi et la<lb/> création d&apos;emplois. Les politiques et les institutions continuent en même temps à accorder relativement peu<lb/> d&apos;attention à la qualité des emplois, bien que celle-ci soit un facteur majeur du bien-être des employés et<lb/> peut-être un facteur important pour la productivité du travail. La qualité de l&apos;emploi pourrait finalement<lb/> influencer également les choix d&apos;offre de main-d&apos;oeuvre et conduire à un emploi supérieur. Fournir des<lb/> preuves solides sur la relation entre la qualité de l&apos;emploi et la productivité des travailleurs pourrait<lb/> constituer un argument de taille dans les politiques du marché du travail visant à améliorer la qualité de<lb/> l&apos;emploi. Cet article examine les résultats existants sur la relation entre la qualité de l&apos;environnement<lb/> professionnel et la productivité individuelle au travail, définie comme une productivité réduite et évalue<lb/> l&apos;effet de la santé sur cette relation.<lb/> Après avoir examiné 2 319 études dans divers domaines et disciplines, y compris l&apos;économie et la<lb/> médecine, 48 d&apos;entre elles ont été reconsidérées. Des preuves solides ont ainsi pu mettre en évidence une<lb/> relation négative entre stress ou tension au travail et productivité individuelle au travail, ainsi qu&apos;une<lb/> relation positive entre récompenses professionnelles et productivité. Un résultat modéré est mis en évidence<lb/> dans le cas d&apos;une relation négative entre conflit familiale et productivité au travail et dans le cas d&apos;une<lb/> relation positive entre équité au travail et soutien social des collègues et productivité. La santé influence la<lb/> relation entre la qualité de l&apos;environnement de professionnel et la productivité. Plus précisément, la relation<lb/> est plus forte pour les personnes en bonne santé.<lb/> La qualité de l&apos;emploi nécessite une place plus importante dans les politiques du marché du travail.<lb/> Il est nécessaire d&apos;accorder plus d&apos;attention à la perception qu&apos;ont les travailleurs de la qualité de leur<lb/> environnement professionnel et à la manière dont les politiques et pratiques, tant au niveau du travailleur<lb/> que de son environnement, peuvent influencer cette situation. De plus, du fait que les facteurs liés à la santé<lb/> influent de manière significative la relation entre qualité de l&apos;emploi et productivité, des approches<lb/> multidisciplinaires sont nécessaires pour soutenir la productivité au travail.<lb/></figure>

			<table>This paper links and contributes to two streams of recent OECD work: i) the work on Job Quality<lb/> which lead to the development of the OECD Job Quality Framework and ii) the work on Mental Health and<lb/> Work which culminated in the release of the Recommendation of the OECD Council on Integrated Mental<lb/> Health, Skills and Work Policy.<lb/></table>

			<p>The OECD Job Quality Framework has underlined the importance of giving more prominence in<lb/> policy and practice to the quality of the jobs created in a country to promote job-rich economic<lb/> growth (Cazes, Hijzen and Saint-Martin, 2015). While countries are more focused on promoting the<lb/> quantity of jobs and labour force participation, the quality of a job has been found to be a major driver of<lb/> employee wellbeing and may be an important factor for sustainable work participation and work<lb/> productivity (<ref type="biblio">Catalina-Romero et al., 2015; Milner, Butterworth, Bentley, Kavanagh<lb/> and LaMontagne, 2015; Stansfeld and Candy, 2006</ref>).<lb/> Following this, the OECD Job Quality Framework has provided a yardstick for assessing job quality,<lb/> which allows comparisons over time and across countries and socio-demographic groups. In the<lb/> Framework, job quality is assessed along three dimensions: earnings quality, labour market security and<lb/> quality of the work environment. There is ample evidence that these dimensions contribute to employee<lb/> wellbeing (<ref type="biblio">Schaufeli and Taris, 2014; Stevenson and Wolfers, 2013; Green, 2011; Salvatori, 2010</ref>).<lb/> While employee wellbeing is an end in its own right, the OECD Job Quality Framework emphasises<lb/> the importance of assessing the impact of job quality on work productivity to provide further justification<lb/> for incorporating job quality in policy recommendations on labour market performance. Whereas the<lb/> dimensions of earnings quality and labour market security are quantitative in nature and can be more easily<lb/> related to work productivity and compared across contexts, the dimension of the quality of the work<lb/> environment captures many qualitative aspects of employment that are less easily translated in terms of<lb/> work productivity and less comparable.<lb/></p>

			<p>The first goal of this paper is to review existing evidence on the relationship between the quality of<lb/> the work environment and work productivity. While productivity is a multidimensional construct and can<lb/> be operationalized in different ways – e.g. through annual working hours or output per hour worked or the<lb/> number of sick-leave days –, we chose to specifically focus on at-work productivity loss which refers to a<lb/> worker&apos;s reduced productivity, or performance, while at work.<lb/></p>

			<head>Through the OECD Mental Health and Work review (OECD<ref type="biblio">, 2012; OECD, 2015</ref>) it has become<lb/> evident that participating in work and being productive at work is far more challenging for people with<lb/> health problems compared to their peers without health problems, and even more so for people with mental<lb/> health problems. For example, 70% of people with mild-to-moderate mental health problems report to have<lb/> experienced reduced at-work productivity or performance compared to 30% of their peers without mental<lb/> health problems (<ref type="biblio">OECD, 2012</ref>). An important question arising is whether and in what way the relationship<lb/> between the quality of the work environment and individual at-work productivity is influenced by health.<lb/> The relationship may differ depending on the workers&apos; health status or, workers&apos; health could explain the<lb/> relationship between the quality of the work environment and at-work productivity (in other words, a poor<lb/> work environment may lead to reduced health which in turn may reduce the worker&apos;s productivity).<lb/> A second goal of this paper is to assess the existing evidence on the effect of health on the relationship<lb/> between the quality of the work environment and at-work productivity.<lb/></p>

			<head>DEFINITIONS<lb/></head>

			<p>The quality of the work environment, individual at-work productivity and also health can be measured<lb/> and construed in a number of ways. It is not assumed that the particular definitions used in this paper are<lb/> superior to alternative definitions, but it is important to be aware of the choice made to ensure clarity about<lb/> the focus of this paper, and its findings.<lb/></p>

			<head>At-work productivity<lb/></head>

			<p>In the field of Work and Health, at-work productivity is often seen as one particular aspect of overall<lb/> work productivity, in addition to absenteeism and work disability. Often, the focus is on assessing at-work<lb/> productivity loss due to health problems. Examples of definitions of at-work productivity loss used in the<lb/> literature include &apos;the inability to adequately perform one&apos;s work due to health problems,&apos; &apos;having gone to<lb/> work while hindered by health problems,&apos; or &apos;perceiving difficulties in meeting work demands given one&apos;s<lb/> (physical or mental) health.&apos; In this strand of literature, at-work productivity is usually assessed from the<lb/> perspective of the individual worker.<lb/> Different from that, the organisational psychology, human resource and business literature more<lb/> frequently interpret at-work productivity as performance at work, with no specific connection to people&apos;s<lb/> health status. Performance could be interpreted as an assessment of overall performance (or productivity),<lb/> but often it is also further divided into, for example, in-role performance, extra-role performance, task<lb/> performance, and others. While assessments by the individual worker are most common, in this field,<lb/> supervisor ratings or team performance ratings are also used.<lb/> For this paper, the decision was made to define at-work productivity as either:<lb/></p>

			<p>1.<lb/> An assessment of the percentage of time or number of days one has (or has not) been productive<lb/> or functioning well while at work, which could include a specific connection to health<lb/> (i.e. problems with reduced productivity/functioning due to health problems); or<lb/> 2.<lb/> An overall assessment of one&apos;s performance or productivity while at work.<lb/> This particular choice has two major limitations, or implications. First, the focus in this paper is on a<lb/> subjective assessment by the individual worker which may be quite remote from the &quot; economic concept &quot; of<lb/> productivity because workers have no ways of observing firm&apos;s value added. Secondly, absenteeism is not<lb/> included in this definition, i.e. the study only looks at performance or productivity of workers while at<lb/> work. In other words, the paper is looking at productivity per hour of work whereas, by narrowing the<lb/> analysis in this way, it omits any possible effects that a bad quality of the work environment might have on<lb/> lowering productivity per worker for a given level of hourly productivity (by increasing sick leave and<lb/> other absences from work). This effect could potentially be as large as the one considered in the paper.<lb/></p>

			<head>Quality of the work environment<lb/></head>

			<p>Two dominant theories on the quality of the work environment are the Effort-Reward Imbalance (ERI)<lb/> and the Job Demands-Resources (JD-R) models (<ref type="biblio">Bakker and Demerouti, 2007; Siegrist, 1996</ref>). The ERI<lb/> model postulates reciprocity between effort, consisting of extrinsic job demands and intrinsic motivation to<lb/> meet these demands, and rewards, consisting of salary, esteem, security and career opportunities. It is<lb/> hypothesised that an imbalance between effort and rewards results in reduced worker wellbeing. The JD-R<lb/> model theorises an interaction between job demands and job resources, where job demands refer to physical,<lb/> psychological, social or organisational aspects that request effort or skills and job resources refer to physical,<lb/> psychological, social or organisational aspects that help in achieving goals, reduce job demands and/or<lb/> stimulate personal growth (<ref type="biblio">Bakker and Demerouti, 2007</ref>). According to the JD-R model, job demands can<lb/> lead to reduced wellbeing and job resources to improved motivation. Adequate job resources may buffer the<lb/> negative relationship between job demands and wellbeing. This implies that (additional) job demands are<lb/> more problematic for workers if they do not have the job resources to cope with these demands. Similarly,<lb/> (additional) job demands may reduce the positive relationship between job resources and motivation. The<lb/> effort and reward concepts are also included in the JD-R model (as being part of demands and resources,<lb/> respectively), but the specific trade-off hypothesis is not postulated in the JD-R model.<lb/> Many empirical studies have tried to validate the JD-R and ERI models, and there is evidence showing<lb/> that the mechanisms described in these models are indeed related to worker wellbeing and motivation (e.g.<lb/> burn-out and organisational commitment). Additionally, there is evidence for a relationship with<lb/> absenteeism (Arnold B. <ref type="biblio">Bakker &amp; Demerouti, 2007; Catalina-Romero et al., 2015; Milner et al., 2015</ref>).<lb/> However, less is known about studies that have looked at the balance of job demands and job resources and<lb/> at-work productivity. <ref type="biblio">Lagerveld et al. (2010)</ref> reviewed studies on the association between work factors and<lb/> work functioning (which they defined as the productivity or performance of employees at work) and found<lb/> only one factor to be associated, namely the type of occupation. However, this finding was based on only<lb/> one study which was also cross-sectional in design. A more recent review by Miraglia and Johns (2016)<lb/> combined correlations found in different studies between work factors and presenteeism (defined as<lb/> &quot; attending work when ill &quot; ). This meta-analysis of correlations identified multiple work factors as strongly<lb/> correlated to presenteeism, including: role demands, workload, understaffing, working hours and physical<lb/> demands. However, the review only focused on presenteeism as an outcome, while at-work productivity<lb/> can be assessed in various other ways (for instance, an assessment of work performance or work<lb/> functioning). An overview of study results on the relationship between the quality of the work environment<lb/> and at-work productivity (as assessed in different ways) would add to the current literature.<lb/> In the OECD Job Quality Framework, quality of the work environment is defined largely along the<lb/> lines of the JD-R model. The OECD job strain index takes several components and dimensions of the<lb/> quality of the work environment into account, to identify the extent to which job demands exceed<lb/> job resources. There is no consensus on a minimal set of ingredients to measure the quality of the work<lb/> environment and, therefore, a minimal set of questions to be included in surveys that aim to examine<lb/> the quality of the work environment. The forthcoming OECD Guidelines on Measuring Quality of<lb/> the Working Environment will address conceptualisation and measurement issues.<lb/> In this paper, quality of the work environment is defined in the broader JD-R way of physical,<lb/> psychological, social or organisational job demands and job resources. This includes psychosocial work<lb/> factors such as psychological job demands, autonomy/job control, social support or job rewards, as well as<lb/> more contextual work factors like organisational size, type of contract or job type. Notably, the paper is<lb/> based on what factors and dimensions the studies reviewed have considered. Moreover, the terms quality of<lb/> the work environment and work factors (which are seen as an operationalization of the quality of the work<lb/> environment) are used interchangeably.<lb/></p>

			<head>Health<lb/></head>

			<p>Since 1948, the World Health Organisation defines health as &quot; a state of complete physical, mental and<lb/> social wellbeing and not merely the absence of disease of infirmity &quot; . This definition has been criticised in<lb/> the past decades, especially for using the word &apos;complete&apos; with respect to wellbeing. Probably, the<lb/> requirement of complete health would render the majority of the population unhealthy. Recently, Huber and<lb/> colleagues redefined health to a more dynamic concept of &apos;the ability to adapt and to self-manage, in the<lb/> face of social, mental and physical challenges in life&apos; (<ref type="biblio">Huber et al., 2011</ref>). With this concept of health,<lb/> people with physical, mental or social challenges who are able and enabled to cope well with these<lb/> challenges are regarded as healthy. This positive and dynamic concept of health is still underused in<lb/> research, where health is often assessed through the absence or presence of physical and/or mental health<lb/> problems, symptoms or disabilities. As this paper reviews the existing research literature, it defines health<lb/> in line with the common approach i.e. the presence or absence of physical and/or mental health problems,<lb/> symptoms or disabilities.<lb/></p>

			<head>METHODS<lb/> Literature search<lb/></head>

			<p>Scientific articles were searched in the following medical, psychological and economic literature<lb/> databases: PubMed, PsycInfo, Business Source Elite and Web of Science. The search strategy consisted of<lb/> search terms related to at-work productivity loss (e.g. presenteeism, job performance, work functioning)<lb/> combined with terms related to work factors (e.g. work conditions, work stressors, psychosocial factors).<lb/> No search terms on health were included as the primary goal was to identify research on the relationship<lb/> between quality of the work environment and at-work productivity, regardless of the effect of health on this<lb/> relationship. Including search terms related to health would restrict the number of studies that would be<lb/> identified. Also, no restrictions were used on study type or year of publication, and the search included<lb/> articles up until April 2016. The search string for each database can be found in the appendix. Additional<lb/> articles were searched through scanning the reference list of included studies.<lb/></p>

			<head>Inclusion of studies<lb/></head>

			<p>One author (IA) screened all titles and abstracts of articles that were found through the literature<lb/> search. In case of uncertainty of including or excluding an article the full text was retrieved, and if that<lb/> would not solve the uncertainty discussion took place with a second author (CP or FA). Inclusion criteria<lb/> for studies were: (1) empirical, quantitative data were presented on the relationship between work factors<lb/> and at-work productivity; (2) at-work productivity was quantitatively assessed at the individual level by<lb/> requesting (a) the percentage of time/number of days a worker has (not) been productive/functioning well at<lb/> work or (b) a worker&apos;s overall rating of his/her own performance/productivity/functioning at work; (3) the<lb/> included work factors had to represent the psychosocial quality of the work environment and could be<lb/> either (a) objective characteristics (e.g. contract hours, manual/non-manual work) or (b) psychosocial<lb/> characteristics (e.g. job demands, resources, workplace bullying); (4) the article should be written in<lb/> English, Dutch or German; and (5) the study should take place in a real-life workplace setting, e.g. not in a<lb/> simulated/laboratory setting. Articles using measures of work ability or specific aspects of job performance<lb/> (e.g. in-role, extra-role, task or contextual performance) were excluded, as these do not provide an<lb/> indication of the amount of time a worker is (not) functioning/being productive at work or an overall<lb/> performance score. Furthermore, reviews were excluded, but their reference lists were checked for<lb/> potentially relevant studies.<lb/></p>

			<head>Data extraction<lb/></head>

			<p>One author (IA) extracted data from the included studies on study type (cross-sectional, longitudinal),<lb/> study year, country, study goal, population type, population size, response rate, exposure variables<lb/> included, covariates controlled for, outcome variable, statistical method and study outcome (i.e. significant<lb/> relationships between work factors and at-work productivity in final models).<lb/></p>

			<head>Data synthesis<lb/></head>

			<p>In order to ensure a degree of homogeneity, additional inclusion and exclusion criteria were<lb/> formulated. Studies were only included if the relationship between work factors and at-work productivity<lb/> was investigated through multivariable analyses including more than one work factor and at least two<lb/> confounders, age and gender. Furthermore, the cut-off for significance in the multivariable model had to be<lb/> set at P&lt;.05. In case results were only presented for subgroups (e.g. age groups, occupational type) and<lb/></p>

			<head>RESULTS<lb/> Results of the search<lb/> <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref> presents a flow diagram of included and excluded studies. The initial search in the databases<lb/> resulted in 3 140 references and 21 studies were identified through reference checking of included studies.<lb/> After removing duplicate references, 2 319 references remained. Based on title and abstract screening,<lb/> 2 249 studies were excluded, mostly because studies did not assess at-work productivity following the<lb/> inclusion criterion described above. Full-text reading of the 70 remaining studies resulted in a further<lb/> exclusion of 22 articles. Reasons for exclusion are presented in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>. Thus, finally, 48 studies were<lb/> included in this paper.<lb/></p>

			<head>Characteristics of included studies<lb/></head>

			<p>The main characteristics of the studies included in the analysis are summarised in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>. The<lb/> majority of the studies (79%) were published between 2010 and 2016 and conducted in various countries;<lb/> e.g. the US, Canada, Australia, Japan, Korea and several European countries. The number of participants<lb/> included in a study varied greatly, with the smallest study containing only 68 participants and the largest<lb/> study as many as 78 587 participants. Overall, 62% of the studies had more than 1 000 participants. In the<lb/> majority of studies, participants were recruited through one or several companies. Three studies used a<lb/> European survey and 13 studies recruited participants through national surveys or selected a nationally<lb/> representative sample. In eight studies, participants with a specific health problem were recruited; in three<lb/> studies this related to mental health problems and in five studies to physical health problems.<lb/> <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> also provides information on several methodological aspects of the included studies. Most<lb/> studies (77%) had a cross-sectional as opposed to a longitudinal design, which implies that drawing<lb/> conclusions on the direction of the relationship (i.e. the causality) between work factors and individual<lb/> at-work productivity remains difficult. Furthermore, 66% of the studies included four important<lb/> confounders, i.e. age, gender, health (either physical or mental) and educational level/skill level. Of the 31<lb/> studies (66% of all included studies) that reported the response rate, 35% had a response rate below 50%.<lb/> Finally, the large majority of the studies (85%) had sufficient power for the analyses that were conducted.<lb/> Instruments to assess at-work productivity varied across studies. About half of the studies used one<lb/> self-report question on the number of days (mostly within a timeframe of 12 months) one had been at work<lb/> despite health problems, which is often referred to as &quot; presenteeism &quot; . Six studies assessed the percentage of<lb/> time people experienced difficulties with executing their work tasks due to health problems measured<lb/> through either the Work Role Functioning Questionnaire or the Work Limitations Questionnaire. There<lb/> were nine studies that assessed self-rated performance or productivity at work. Opposed to all other studies,<lb/> in these nine studies, no specific reference was made to the effect of health on at-work productivity. <ref type="table">Table 2<lb/></ref> provides an overview of the different instruments to assess at-work productivity that were used, and<lb/> whether instruments specifically referred to health-related at-work productivity.<lb/></p>

			<head>Relationship between quality of the work environment and at-work productivity<lb/> <ref type="table">Table 3</ref> summarises the relationships that were identified in the included studies between work factors<lb/> and at-work productivity.

			<table>(study 16) showed that<lb/> presenteeism in 2004 was not explained by job strain in 2002.<lb/>  The only longitudinal study on fairness at work (study 40) found a significant effect with at-work<lb/> productivity; participants scoring high on fairness (assessed as procedural justice) in 2009 and<lb/> 2010 had significantly higher job performance scores in 2010 compared to participants scoring<lb/> low on fairness at both points in time. ,<lb/>  Two out of four longitudinal studies looking at &apos;social support from co-workers&apos; found a<lb/> significant relationship with at-work productivity. Low support from colleagues predicted reduced<lb/> work performance at 6 and 12 months follow-up (study 23); and co-worker support in 2008 was<lb/> positively related to job performance in 2009 (study 38</table>

			<p>).<lb/>  For psychological job demands, only one out of five longitudinal studies included in the analysis<lb/> found a significant relationship with productivity; according to this study (study 30), job demands<lb/> at baseline increased the odds of presenteeism one year later and a change in job demands (from<lb/> baseline to 1-year follow-up) led to increased odds for presenteeism over time (from 1-year to 2-<lb/>year follow-up). However, this study did not control for at-work productivity at baseline (the four<lb/> studies that did not find an effect did control for this).<lb/>  Similarly, of the six longitudinal studies that looked at the relationship between job control and at-<lb/>work productivity, four found no significant relationship between baseline job control and at-work<lb/> productivity at 2, 3, 6 or 12-month follow-up (study 1, study 3, study 23 and study 28). Again,<lb/> study 30 found a relationship (job control at baseline decreased the odds of presenteeism one year<lb/> later and a change in job control decreased the odds of presenteeism over time) and this finding<lb/> was confirmed by another study, which found that baseline job control predicted job performance<lb/> one year later (study 38).<lb/> For several work factors, different studies found results in the opposite direction. For example, for job<lb/> rewards four studies found a positive association with productivity and one study a negative association.<lb/> There might be obvious explanations for such seemingly conflicting findings. Positive work factors such as<lb/> job rewards, job control and good leadership may on the one hand contribute to employee wellbeing and as<lb/> such have a positive effect on productivity. On the other hand, a negative effect may be expected if people<lb/> experience health or other problems that interfere with their productivity, but try to keep going out of<lb/> loyalty for the good work conditions they experience.<lb/></p>

			<p>Similarly, increased worries on job insecurity could reduce productivity, but they could also stimulate<lb/> people to work harder to increase their chances of remaining in the organisation. Furthermore, in <ref type="table">Table 3<lb/></ref> studies are combined that assess at-work productivity in different ways. About half of the studies assess at-<lb/>work productivity loss by requesting whether people had been at work while they should have stayed at<lb/> home because of health problems. High physical job demands may make it impossible to do one&apos;s work and<lb/> thus decrease the chances of turning up at work while experiencing health problems (i.e. this was classified<lb/> as a positive relationship with at-work productivity). On the other hand, in studies where self-assessed<lb/> performance was used as measure of at-work productivity, it would be more likely that physical demands<lb/> would lead to a lower assessment of performance (i.e. this was classified as a negative relationship with at-<lb/>work productivity).This is exactly what was found in the studies that included physical demands (and found<lb/> an effect) and thus explains the different direction of effects found for this work factor.<lb/> For a few work factors, no or only limited evidence was found for the relationship with at-work<lb/> productivity. This was especially for general job support and supervisor social support. This might seem<lb/> surprising given that research has shown that the supervisor-worker relationship can impact workers&apos;<lb/> wellbeing (<ref type="biblio">Nielsen and Daniels, 2016; O&apos;Donnell, Berkman and Subramanian, 2012</ref>). Potentially, social<lb/> support measures do not capture the most relevant aspects of the supervisor-worker relationship for<lb/> productivity. For example, assessing whether a supervisor is overall &apos;concerned&apos;, &apos;helpful&apos; or &apos;encouraging&apos;<lb/> (as examples of items typically used to measure the supervisor-worker relationship) might be too general to<lb/> find a significant relationship with at-work productivity; it could be more informative to look in more detail at,<lb/> for example, whether a supervisor can be approached to discuss potential productivity problems without the<lb/> fear of being stigmatised and whether a supervisor is willing to change work conditions. The latter aspects are<lb/> rarely included in supervisor support scales.<lb/></p>

			<head>Effect of health on the relationship between work factors and at-work productivity<lb/></head>

			<p>There are three different ways in which the effect of health on the relationship between work factors<lb/> and at-work productivity are assessed (see <ref type="table">Table 4</ref>):<lb/></p>

			<p> First, five studies analysed whether the relationship between work factors and productivity was<lb/> explained by health, i.e. whether work factors are related to a decrease or increase in health which<lb/> in turn decreases or increases at-work productivity (also referred to as a mediation effect).For<lb/> example, low job control may deteriorate a worker&apos;s health, and that effect on health may, in turn,<lb/> reduce at-work productivity.<lb/></p>

			<p> Second, eight studies provided information on whether the relationship between work factors and<lb/> productivity weakened or disappeared when controlling for the effect of health (i.e. taking health<lb/> as a confounder into account in the analysis). For example, a relationship between job strain and<lb/> at-work productivity might be (partly) due to the fact that people with job strain have poorer<lb/> health or that people with poor health experience higher job strain. While this seems similar to the<lb/> above mentioned mediation analyses, there is one important difference. With mediation analysis a<lb/> specific path is evaluated (in the six studies included it was the path: work factors influence health<lb/> and health influences productivity), while with confounding it is not investigated in what way<lb/> health &apos;interferes&apos; in the relationship, but only whether it does. In five studies, results on the<lb/> confounding effect of health were already included while in three cases the study authors<lb/> provided additional information to the authors of the present paper on results after controlling for<lb/> health (study number 19, 24 and 26).<lb/>  Third, there were two studies that investigated whether the effect of work factors on productivity<lb/> was different for people in good or bad health, often referred to as moderation analysis (in some<lb/> disciplines the terms interaction or effect-modification are more common). Specifically, studies<lb/> analysed the relationship between work factors and individual productivity separately for people<lb/> with bad and with good health. This allows identifying whether poor outcomes on work factors<lb/> are disadvantageous with regards to productivity to both people in bad and people in good health<lb/> or only to one of these groups.<lb/></p>

			<table>Table 4.<lb/> Assessment of health in studies on mediation, confounding and moderation<lb/></table>

			<p>Results of the mediation, confounding and moderation analyses are presented in <ref type="table">Table 5</ref>. Due to the<lb/> limited number of studies, it remains difficult to draw firm conclusions for each individual work factor. For<lb/> most work factors, only one study was available. However, for job rewards, work-family imbalance and<lb/> workload two studies evaluated the mediation effect of health and both found an effect in the same<lb/> direction: poor work conditions are related to poorer health which in turn is related to decreased<lb/> productivity while at work, while good work conditions are related to good health which in turn leads to<lb/> increased productivity. Only for job strain and workplace bullying, a longitudinal study was found that<lb/> showed a significant mediation effect by health (study 34). This study found that baseline job strain and<lb/> workplace bullying were related to reduced job performance at one-year follow-up through increased<lb/> depression symptoms (from baseline to one-year follow-up): i.e. job strain and bullying resulted in<lb/> increased depression symptoms which in turn resulted in reduced job performance.<lb/></p>

			<p>The two studies that assessed the moderating effect of health on the relationship between work factors<lb/> and at-work productivity show consistent results. For all work factors included in the two studies, the effect<lb/> of the work factor on productivity (be it positive or negative) was stronger for people in good health. Thus,<lb/> for example, increased job control was associated with a reduced risk of productivity loss, but this mattered<lb/> especially (study 33) or only (study 8) for people in good health.<lb/> Taking the latter finding into account, it could be expected that studies focusing on study populations<lb/> with specific health problems are less likely to find a relationship between work factors and at-work<lb/> productivity which in turn could have implications for the overall findings presented in this paper. Of the 43<lb/> studies that provided the evidence for <ref type="table">Table 3</ref> eight studies included a study population with health<lb/> problems (see also <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>). Three of the eight studies found no relationship between any of the included<lb/> work factors and productivity (study 11, study 14 and study 31).

			<head>DISCUSSION<lb/></head>

Three<lb/> findings stand out:<lb/> 1.<lb/> There is a great diversity in the operationalization of at-work productivity loss;<lb/> 2.<lb/> For several work factors there is emergent evidence of a strongly or moderately positive<lb/> relationship with productivity; and<lb/> 3.<lb/> Health is a relevant factor to take into account when looking at the relationship between work<lb/> factors and productivity.<lb/></p>

			<head>More consistency is needed in assessing at-work productivity<lb/></head>

			<p>The relatively broad definition of at-work productivity (loss) allowed the inclusion of studies with<lb/> varying operationalisations. &apos;At-work productivity&apos; was defined as either (a) the amount of time a worker<lb/> was productive or able to function/perform well at work, or (b) the worker&apos;s rating of his/her own<lb/> performance/productivity/functioning at work. Among the 48 included studies, there were 14 different ways<lb/> in which at-work productivity (loss) was operationalized. This raises the question whether consensus is<lb/> needed on defining and assessing this outcome, especially when the aim is to design policies and identify<lb/> practices that influence worker productivity.<lb/></p>

			<p>The majority of productivity instruments used in the studies tried to identify reduced at-work<lb/> productivity due to health problems specifically. Most frequently used was a single-item question on the<lb/> number of days one had gone to work despite health problems. Conceptually, there are two problems with<lb/> this single-item question when trying to capture at-work productivity. First, it implies that working while<lb/> experiencing health problems will result in productivity loss, or in other words that ill-health equals<lb/> inability to work. However, not all people experiencing health problems are unable to function or be<lb/> productive at work. As such, an item on working despite health problems could result in an overestimation<lb/> of productivity loss as going to work while experiencing health problems does not necessarily reduce<lb/> productivity. Second, the item implies that when one experiences ill-health, one should not go to work. In<lb/> several studies the item even included statements such as &apos;while you should have stayed at home&apos;. This<lb/> goes against scientific evidence that work is generally good for health (Dooley, <ref type="biblio">Fielding and Levi, 1996;<lb/> Thomas, Benzeval and Stansfeld, 2005</ref>), and that it can be an important factor in a person&apos;s recovery<lb/> (OECD, 2012). Furthermore, many people with health problems emphasise that participating in work is<lb/> important to them (<ref type="biblio">Saunders and Nedelec, 2014</ref>). Instead of asking people how many days they were at<lb/> work despite of health problems, an operationalization such as the one used in study 43 by <ref type="biblio">Plaisier et al.<lb/> (2012)</ref>, would be preferable. Here it was asked how many working days a respondent experienced<lb/> hindrance by health problems, followed by an assessment of the person&apos;s efficiency on these days.<lb/> Similarly, questionnaires like the Work Role Functioning Questionnaire and Work Limitations<lb/> Questionnaire result in an overall score representing the percentage of time one was not able to function<lb/> well at work specifically due to health problems (according to the respondent). Such multiple-item<lb/> questionnaires provide more detailed information on specific tasks for which people experienced work<lb/> functioning problems and can provide more direction for interventions by occupational health providers or<lb/> employment counsellors.<lb/> About one-third of the studies used a single-item instrument inquiring a worker&apos;s overall performance<lb/> or productivity at work, mostly on a scale from 0 to 10, regardless of health problems. These instruments<lb/> provide a straightforward assessment of one&apos;s self-perceived performance or productivity at work but no<lb/> information on what the specific productivity problems are and where interventions could focus on.<lb/></p>

			<p>The use of different operationalisations and instruments to assess at-work productivity may influence the<lb/> relationships one finds between work factors and at-work productivity. In this regard, a study by <ref type="biblio">Johns (2011)<lb/></ref> which included different instruments to assess at-work productivity loss – a single item on presenteeism days<lb/> but also the multiple-item Work Limitations Questionnaire (WLQ) and the Stanford Presenteeism Scale (SPS)<lb/> – has provided interesting insights. While relationships between the work factors and the different outcome<lb/> measures were in the same direction, differences were found in their strength and statistical significance; for<lb/> instance, &apos;pay equity&apos; was significantly associated with the single item on presenteeism days but not with the<lb/> WLQ and SPS, while &apos;family and work conflict&apos; was significantly related to the WLQ and SPS but not to the<lb/> presenteeism item. Based on this one paper, however, it is difficult to provide strong explanations for these<lb/> different results, highlighting the need for more research to look into this.<lb/> To conclude, when choosing an instrument to assess at-work productivity, it is important to take into<lb/> account what the goal of the analysis is. For example, when assessing how productive people are at work, a<lb/> single question about the number of days someone went to work despite health problems is not useful as it<lb/> does not provide information on whether the person was productive. Including an assessment of whether<lb/> one was also hindered by health problems and an estimation of the amount of hindrance would be essential.<lb/> When the goal is to measure how to influence productivity, multiple-item measures identifying which types<lb/> of work tasks are most problematic would be more informative. Consensus about the use of one particular<lb/> instrument is not essential, but using the same instrument when having a similar goal would improve<lb/> comparability across settings.<lb/></p>

			<head>Quality of the work environment influences at-work productivity<lb/></head>

			<p>A first conclusion that can be drawn from the largely cross-sectional studies reviewed in this paper is that<lb/> several work factors have shown to be related to productivity. There was strong evidence for a relationship<lb/> with job stress, job rewards and job strain and moderate evidence for a relationship with work-family conflict,<lb/> fairness at work and social support from co-workers. The limited number of longitudinal studies and the<lb/> differing results of these studies (i.e. some did and others did not find a longitudinal relationship between a<lb/> work factor and at-work productivity) did not allow clear conclusions on the causal pathways. As such,<lb/> separate look at these longitudinal studies did not change the overall conclusion that there is evidence that<lb/> several work factors are related to at-work productivity. Second, not for all work factors that have been<lb/> theoretically linked with worker productivity, following the dominant Job Demands Resources (JD-R) and<lb/> Effort Reward Imbalance (ERI) models, supportive evidence was found. For example, there was no clear<lb/> evidence for a unique relationship between job demands or job control (an important job resource in the JD-R<lb/> model) and at-work productivity, while this is being hypothesized in JD-R theory (<ref type="biblio">Bakker and Demerouti,<lb/> 2016</ref>). However, in line with JD-R theory, job strain, i.e. the combination of high job demands and low job<lb/> resources, did show a significant relationship with at-work productivity in several cross-sectional studies.<lb/> Another finding is that for general job support and supervisor support, most studies did not find any<lb/> relationship. This is surprising as qualitative studies (e.g. interviews with workers) have shown that the<lb/> supervisor-worker relationship is important for workers&apos; functioning at work, especially for people with health<lb/> problems (Hjarsbech, Nielsen, Andersen, Rugulies and Christensen, 2015; Andersen, Nielsen and Brinkmann<lb/> 2012). The question arises whether other ways to assess this relationship are needed.<lb/> While more longitudinal research is needed to confirm a causal pathway between the work factors<lb/> reported in this paper and at-work productivity, an important implication for policy and practice is that<lb/> more attention is needed for the quality of work and the inherent interplay between the individual and its<lb/> work context. At this moment, country policies and worker support practices do not take this into account.<lb/> First, in many OECD countries, workplace policies primarily focus on physical unsafe and unhealthy work<lb/> conditions. The identification of psychosocial workplace risks from the perspective of the individual worker<lb/> (e.g. fairness of organisational policies and job stain) is rarely included in workplace legislation and where<lb/> it is, it generally plays a limited role in practice (OECD, 2015). However, this paper has shown that these<lb/> factors matter for productivity. Furthermore, there is a body of evidence showing the importance of such<lb/> factors for workers&apos; health (<ref type="biblio">Bakker and Demerouti, 2016</ref>) (<ref type="biblio">Schaufeli and Taris, 2014</ref>). Second, while<lb/> workplace policies are directed at the (physical) works environment, the available interventions for<lb/> improving worker wellbeing and productivity are often (narrowly) focused on the individual worker, for<lb/> example by trying to improve resilience, stress management or coping skills (<ref type="biblio">Ebert et al., 2016; Jamieson<lb/> and Tuckey, 2016</ref>). Here, the interaction between the worker and its work environment is missing as well.<lb/></p>

			<p>More attention is needed for how workers perceive the quality of their work environment and how policies<lb/> and practices at both the level of the worker and the work environment may positively influence this.<lb/> When drawing conclusions on the relationship between the quality of the work environment and<lb/> productivity based on this paper, several limitations need to be taken into account. First, as mentioned, only<lb/> 11 studies had a longitudinal design, which inhibits conclusions on a causal relationship between work<lb/> factors and at-work productivity. Also, the direction of causation sometimes remains unclear. For some<lb/> work factors a reversed causal pathway could be hypothesised. For example, one could imagine that<lb/> increased productivity may lead to increased job rewards just as well as increased job rewards could lead to<lb/> increased productivity. Furthermore, the designs of the longitudinal studies that were included had some<lb/> limitations. For example, most of these studies had quite a short follow-up period of one year. Also,<lb/> baseline assessments of at-work productivity were not always included, but this is essential to investigate<lb/> causal pathways between work factors and productivity. In a similar vein, work factors were often only<lb/> assessed at baseline, while these factors should be repeatedly measured as the experience of quality of the<lb/> work environment may fluctuate over time.<lb/> Second, studies used different instruments to assess productivity and the various work factors, include<lb/> different study populations and use different covariates in their analyses. This heterogeneity in studies<lb/> reduces comparability and may explain why for some work factors different studies found opposite results.<lb/> As discussed above, the study by <ref type="biblio">Johns (2011)</ref> showed that relationships between work factors and at-work<lb/> productivity varied for different measures of at-work productivity. Other studies found that the relationship<lb/> between work factors and at-work productivity varies for different subgroups of participants, such as<lb/> workers differing in tenure or type of occupation, or for different countries (<ref type="biblio">Claes, 2011; Jourdain and<lb/> Vézina, 2014; Jacobs et al. 2007</ref>). However, there were too few studies to derive meaningful conclusions<lb/> when splitting results further for, e.g., similar at-work productivity measures. This is why for this paper it<lb/> was chosen to combine the results of all studies and to evaluate whether some broad conclusions on the<lb/> relevance of the quality of the work environment for at-work productivity could be drawn. Third, several<lb/> work factors were investigated in only a few studies, including those for which strong evidence was found.<lb/> It is important to have these work factors included in future research, to evaluate whether their relevance for<lb/> at-work productivity also shows in other settings.<lb/></p>

			<head>Work policies need to include a health perspective<lb/></head>

			<p>All 14 studies that investigated the impact of health on the relationship between the quality of the work<lb/> environment and productivity showed that health indeed matters. Policies must reflect that finding: policies<lb/> aimed at improving the quality of the work environment so to improve worker productivity must also take<lb/> workers&apos; health into account.<lb/></p>

			<p>Especially interesting are the comparable findings of the two studies looking at the moderating effect<lb/> of health on the relationship between work factors and at-work productivity. These studies show that the<lb/> relationship between positive work factors (e.g. job control) or negative work factors (e.g. job stress) and<lb/> productivity is strongest for people in good health. This is an important finding because it suggests that the<lb/> quality of the work environment matters for reasons that go beyond its negative effects on workers&apos; health.<lb/></p>

			<p>For some work factors, the relationship with productivity even ceases to exist for people in bad health.<lb/> The lack of a relationship between the quality of the work environment and productivity for people in bad<lb/> health has important implications for research and policy. If the relationship between work factors and<lb/> productivity is solely investigated within study populations dealing with health problems, chances of finding<lb/> significant associations may be smaller. Of the five studies included in this paper with study populations with<lb/> health problems, three studies found no effect for any of the work factors. This could one lead to conclude that<lb/> the quality of the work environment does not matter for productivity. But this would be incorrect, as studies in<lb/> this paper for general populations show a connection between several work factors and productivity.<lb/> Furthermore, research has shown that many people with health problems have difficulty in remaining<lb/> productive at work (Aronsson, <ref type="biblio">Gustafsson and Dallner, 2000; OECD, 2012</ref>). Thus, good work conditions<lb/> alone seem insufficient for workers with health problems to ensure a productive working life.<lb/> However, many of the studies included in this paper show that health-related factors (e.g. chronic diseases,<lb/> general health, or mental distress) were also significantly related to at-work productivity, thereby confirming the<lb/> need for multidisciplinary approaches to support worker productivity. In line with this, work by the OECD on<lb/> Mental Health and Work has shown that workplace policies for people with mental health problems should not<lb/> only focus on improving the psychosocial quality of work, but also have a focus on keeping people in work and<lb/> helping them return to work quickly when they are ill. For both of these aims, integrated health and work support<lb/> is critical (OECD, 2015). Neither can underlying health issues remain unaddressed, nor can health professionals<lb/> ignore the underlying workplace issues. An adequate policy response should also include tackling stigma at the<lb/> workplace associated with health problems to ensure that people feel comfortable discussing potential support<lb/> measures that could help them remain productive at work.<lb/></p>

			<head>Conclusion<lb/></head>

			<p>To improve our understanding of the relationship between the quality of the work environment and at-<lb/>work productivity and to be able to use the findings to support people (with and without health problems) to<lb/> remain productive at work, several developments in research and policy are indicated. First, more longitudinal<lb/> studies that overcome the limitations addressed above are needed to improve the evidence base and to clarify<lb/> the causal relationship between various factors of the quality of the work environment, health and<lb/> productivity. Second, when studying productivity, researchers or policy makers need to be clear about what<lb/> they want to measure, e.g. overall productivity or performance or health-related productivity loss. If the goal is<lb/> to intervene on reduced productivity, a measurement instrument is needed that can indicate in which areas<lb/> productivity problems are experienced and picks up change over time. Thirdly, this paper provides direction<lb/> for the work factors that could be explored further in terms of their effect on productivity and interventions<lb/> addressing these factors that would improve productivity. Fourthly, attention should be paid to the interaction<lb/> between the individual and the workplace environment, especially for people with health problems who<lb/> appear to benefit less from a good quality work environment than people without health problems. For those<lb/> people, support measures addressing both workplace and health issues are essential.<lb/></p>
