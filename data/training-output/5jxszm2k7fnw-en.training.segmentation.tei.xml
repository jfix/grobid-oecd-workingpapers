The government has a substantial reform program to make it easier to do business in Spain, <lb/>which should in some cases be deepened. Boosting economic growth requires a new generation of high-<lb/>growth companies and that resources flow towards the most productive firms. For this to happen, barriers <lb/>to business growth have to be reduced by streamlining regulations and licencing procedures, <lb/>internationalisation needs to be fostered, and competition strengthened. In addition, the negative impact of <lb/>the crisis on companies, notably the high level of indebtedness and difficulties to obtain financing faced by <lb/>some firms has to be relieved. This would be facilitated by more efficient insolvency procedures and <lb/>further development of non-bank financing. <lb/>This Working Paper relates to the 2014 OECD Economic Survey of Spain <lb/>(http://www.oecd.org/eco/surveys/economic-survey-spain.htm). <lb/>JEL classification: D21, D40, F10, K20, G21, G24, G33, H25, L11, L12, L25, L50 <lb/>Keywords: Spain, business sector, productivity, firms size, young firms, entrepreneurship, <lb/>internationalisation, exports, competition, competitiveness, indebtedness, corporate tax, regulations, <lb/>licences, constant market share analysis, market share effect, structure effect, trade specialization, <lb/>professional services, electricity, regulators, ports, judicial efficiency, insolvency, venture capital, mutual <lb/>guarantee schemes, credit register <lb/>************** <lb/>Dynamiser le secteur des entreprises en Espagne <lb/>Les efforts faits par les autorités pour revitaliser l&apos;entrepreneuriat et l&apos;investissement en Espagne <lb/>revêtent un rôle essentiel pour soutenir la croissance et la création d&apos;emplois. Un important programme de <lb/>réformes a été mis en oeuvre afin de faciliter l&apos;activité d&apos;entreprise en Espagne, dont certains aspects <lb/>devraient être approfondis. Pour stimuler la croissance économique, il faut que voit le jour une nouvelle <lb/>génération d&apos;entreprises à forte croissance et que des ressources soient acheminées vers les entreprises les <lb/>plus productives. Dans cette optique, les obstacles à la croissance des entreprises doivent être réduits en <lb/>simplifiant les réglementations et les procédures d&apos;agrément, l&apos;internationalisation doit être encouragée et <lb/>la concurrence doit être renforcée. En outre, les effets négatifs de la crise sur les entreprises, notamment le <lb/>niveau élevé d&apos;endettement et les difficultés rencontrées pour obtenir des financements, doivent être <lb/>atténués, ce qui exige des procédures d&apos;insolvabilité plus efficaces et un développement plus marqué des <lb/>financements non bancaires. <lb/>Ce Document de travail se rapporte à l&apos;Étude économique de l&apos;OCDE de l&apos;Espagne, 2014 <lb/>(http://www.oecd.org/fr/eco/etudes/espagne.htm). <lb/>Classification JEL : D21, D40, F10, K20, G21, G24, G33, H25, L11, L12, L25, L50 <lb/>Mots clefs : Espagne, le secteur des entreprises, la productivité, taille de firmes, les jeunes entreprises, <lb/>l&apos;entrepreneuriat, l&apos;internationalisation, l&apos;exportation, la concurrence, la compétitivité, l&apos;endettement, l&apos;impôt <lb/>des sociétés, réglementations, certifications, l&apos;analyse des parts de marché constantes, effet de part de <lb/>marché, l&apos;effet de la structure, la spécialisation du commerce, des services professionnels, l&apos;électricité, les <lb/>régulateurs, les ports, l&apos;efficacité judiciaire, insolvabilité, capital-risque, sociétés de caution mutuelle, <lb/>registre de crédit <lb/>ECO/WKP(2014)69 <lb/>4 <lb/>TABLE OF CONTENTS <lb/>MOVING TOWARDS A MORE DYNAMIC BUSINESS SECTOR IN SPAIN .......................................... 6 <lb/>Key challenges affecting the Spanish business sector ................................................................................. 6 <lb/>Resources need to be reallocated to the most productive firms ............................................................... 6 <lb/>Barriers to firm start-up and growth are too high ..................................................................................... 7 <lb/>Internationalisation and innovation are low ........................................................................................... 12 <lb/>Competition and cost-competitiveness need boosting ........................................................................... 14 <lb/>Debt remains high and financing conditions are tight ............................................................................ 15 <lb/>Improving the regulatory framework to favour business dynamism and growth ...................................... 17 <lb/>Favouring business start-ups .................................................................................................................. 17 <lb/>Favouring firms&apos;

			<body>MOVING TOWARDS A MORE DYNAMIC BUSINESS SECTOR IN SPAIN <lb/>By Alberto Gonzalez Pandiella 1 <lb/>Policy efforts to revitalise entrepreneurship and investment in Spain are of paramount importance to <lb/>absorb people and capital that have become idle during the crisis. Boosting economic growth requires a <lb/>new generation of high-growth companies to invest in more productive activities where labour could be <lb/>reallocated. Resources should flow to the most productive firms at the expense of the least productive ones, <lb/>which had not been the case in the years prior to the crisis. Lifting the performance of the Spanish business <lb/>sector requires meeting three inter-related challenges: reducing barriers to firm start-up and growth; <lb/>increasing exporting and innovation; and boosting competition. Additional constraints created by the crisis <lb/>should also be removed by rehabilitating highly indebted viable firms and facilitating the exit of the non-<lb/>viable ones, while improving access to credit and capital. The government reform programme already <lb/>underway in these areas should be deepened along these lines. <lb/>Key challenges affecting the Spanish business sector <lb/>Resources need to be reallocated to the most productive firms <lb/>An extensive literature has highlighted the important role of reallocation of resources across firms, <lb/>even within narrowly defined sectors, for overall productivity growth (Arnold et al., 2008; Foster et al., <lb/>2002; Hsieh and Klenow, 2009). Firm-level evidence suggests that Spain has lacked flexibility to <lb/>re-allocate resources to more dynamic and productive firms (Figure 1). In Spain, firms with low <lb/>productivity had stronger employment growth than others before the crisis. This contrasts with United <lb/>Kingdom, Italy and France that show a strong positive association between productivity and employment <lb/>growth. Productivity differentials between Spain and other high-income OECD economies cannot be fully <lb/>explained by the shift of resources towards the construction sector in the boom years (Mora-Sanguinetti <lb/>and Fuentes, 2012), but result from a lack of flexibility preventing resources from being efficiently <lb/>reallocated (Crespo Rodríguez et al., 2012). <lb/>1. <lb/>Alberto González Pandiella is Economist in the Spain/Ireland desk in the Country Studies Branch of the <lb/>Economics Department of the OECD, contact email: alberto.gonzalezpandiella@oecd.org.

The link between productivity and employment growth across firms within industries <lb/>Employment growth relative to average of country and sector, 1998-2009 <lb/>1 <lb/>1. <lb/>Or latest data available. <lb/>Source: OECD (2013), OECD Economic Surveys: Brazil 2013. <lb/>How to read this figure: The bars represent quartiles of firms within an industry ordered by productivity levels relative to the industry <lb/>average. The height of the bars measures annual employment growth, relative to the average of the country and sector. A bar higher <lb/>than zero means that employment growth in a set of firms was above average. <lb/>Implementing reforms that raise the productivity of existing firms, while at the same time fostering <lb/>the flexibility needed for resource reallocation, will be one of the principal policy challenges for ensuring <lb/>strong growth in the future. An environment that promotes reallocation and entrepreneurial risk-taking can <lb/>also encourage innovative activity and investment in knowledge-based capital, which are associated with <lb/>productivity improvements (OECD, 2013a; Andrews and Criscuolo, 2013). Structural policies can <lb/>influence the ease with which such re-allocations occur (Andrews and Cingano, 2012). For example, <lb/>administrative burdens can hamper firm entry, thresholds built into tax or labour codes can create <lb/>disincentives for firms to grow beyond a certain size and credit markets may unduly favour incumbents at a <lb/>time of crisis. <lb/>Barriers to firm start-up and growth are too high <lb/>Regulatory barriers to firm start-up, growth and exit discussed below have resulted in a business <lb/>sector with many low productivity micro enterprises and too few medium and larger firms (Figures 2 <lb/>and 2.3). These features can be observed both in the manufacturing and services sectors and have remained <lb/>unchanged over time. This dual distribution has serious implications for aggregate job growth, productivity <lb/>and employment quality because, as elsewhere, larger firms have higher productivity. Spain, together with <lb/>Italy, has more firms per unit of gross domestic product (GDP) than any other major European economy <lb/>(OECD, 2013b), signalling that the business sector is fragmented. Spanish dual firm distribution is more <lb/>similar to the one observed in developing countries, where many low-productivity locally focused micro <lb/>firms coexist with a few large export-oriented multinationals, than with the one observed in other advanced <lb/>economies. <lb/>-2.0 <lb/>-1.5 <lb/>-1.0 <lb/>-0.5 <lb/>0.0 <lb/>0.5 <lb/>1.0 <lb/>1.5 <lb/>2.0 <lb/>2.5 <lb/>3.0 <lb/>1st <lb/>2nd <lb/>3rd <lb/>4th <lb/>1st <lb/>2nd <lb/>3rd <lb/>4th <lb/>1st <lb/>2nd <lb/>3rd <lb/>4th <lb/>1st <lb/>2nd <lb/>3rd <lb/>4th <lb/>Spain <lb/>France <lb/>Italy <lb/>United Kingdom <lb/>ECO/WKP(2014)69 <lb/></body>

Spain also has one of the lowest early stage entrepreneurship rates, a measure of <lb/>start-up activity (Figure 5). This is a crucial impediment to aggregate economic performance and job <lb/>creation. New enterprises yield a competitive pressure on incumbent companies, improving resource <lb/>allocation by forcing inefficient firms out of the market. New start-ups also exploit knowledge unused or <lb/>under-used by existing companies, drawing on knowledge spillovers to enter new and established markets <lb/>(Acs et al., 2009). High start-up rates are strongly associated with high economic growth and job creation <lb/>(Acs et al., 2006; Stangler and Litan, 2009).

The payment of any wages for more than three months is considered the &quot; birth <lb/>event &quot; of the firm. Individuals who are actively committing resources to start a business (that they expect to own or co-own) <lb/>but for whom the business has not yet yielded wages or salaries are considered nascent entrepreneurs. <lb/>Source: GEM (2014), &quot; Key Indicators &quot; , Global Entrepreneurship Monitor Database, Global Entrepreneurship Research Association, <lb/>London Business School, May <lb/>Empirical evidence confirms this. Spanish young firms have a significantly higher contribution to <lb/>employment creation than older businesses. Indeed, the more favourable job-creation behaviour of young <lb/>firms with respect to mature firms is relatively more marked in Spain than in other economies (Criscoulo <lb/>et al., 2014). Over 50% of new jobs in Spain between 2001 and 2011 were due to young firms, though such <lb/>firms accounted for only about 20% of total employment. Start-ups tend to be smaller in Spain than in <lb/>other countries, and they do not appear to grow much over time, both in manufacturing and services <lb/>(Figure 6). This suggests that the high proportion of small firms and the low presence of larger businesses <lb/>in Spain might be reflecting two different features: start-ups are often small and there is a large share of <lb/>more mature businesses that do not grow. <lb/>0 <lb/>2 <lb/>4 <lb/>6 <lb/>8 <lb/>10 <lb/>12 <lb/>14 <lb/>16 <lb/>18 <lb/>20 <lb/>22 <lb/>24 <lb/>26 <lb/>ITA <lb/>JPN <lb/>FRA <lb/>BEL <lb/>DEU <lb/>ESP <lb/>FIN <lb/>DNK <lb/>GRC <lb/>NOR <lb/>SVN <lb/>KOR <lb/>GBR <lb/>CZE <lb/>CHE <lb/>PRT <lb/>SWE <lb/>LUX <lb/>IRL <lb/>NLD <lb/>POL <lb/>SVK <lb/>AUT <lb/>HUN <lb/>ISR <lb/>AUS <lb/>CAN <lb/>TUR <lb/>USA <lb/>EST <lb/>MEX <lb/>CHL <lb/>2007 <lb/>2013 <lb/></body>

Gal and C. Menon (2014), &quot; The Dynamics of Employment Growth: New Evidence from 18 Countries &quot; , <lb/>OECD Science, Technology and Industry Policy Papers, No. 14. <lb/>Spain displays relatively high rates of self-employment (Figure 7). On the positive side, this can be a <lb/>signal of entrepreneurism. However, it can also be a sign that employers prefer to hire workers as <lb/>independent contractors to benefit from lower social security contributions, which could increase the <lb/>duality of the labour market and reduce labour skills. It could also indicate that the economy is not creating <lb/>enough opportunities in the formal labour market. Indeed, a higher incidence of self-employment tends to <lb/>be related to the size of the informal economy, which in Spain is estimated to be around 22% of GDP <lb/>(Schneider et al., 2010), above the OECD average. On the one hand, the fall in construction activity, which <lb/>tends to have a high incidence of informality, would have contributed to reduced informality. On the other <lb/>hand, the recession reduced business and job opportunities in the formal economy and may have increased <lb/>incentives for entrepreneurs and workers to move to the informal economy. Informality may be a source of <lb/>jobs and livelihood in the short-term, but it hampers growth, job quality and productivity in the medium-<lb/>term. Informal enterprises have an incentive not to grow to escape from tax authorities and there is a <lb/>positive relationship between the size of the informal economy and the size of the micro-enterprise sector <lb/>(OECD, 2013b). Informal firms also tend not to invest in modernising production. This translates into low <lb/>productivity per worker and hence low wages. Moreover, the informal sector does not proportionally <lb/>contribute to the financing of public services and infrastructure and acts as unfair competition to compliant <lb/>firms. <lb/>0 <lb/>10 <lb/>20 <lb/>30 <lb/>40 <lb/>50 <lb/>60 <lb/>70 <lb/>80 <lb/>USA LUX <lb/>CAN <lb/>BEL FRA <lb/>HUN <lb/>GBR AUT <lb/>SWE NOR BRA FIN <lb/>NLD <lb/>PRT ESP <lb/>NZL ITA <lb/>JPN <lb/>A.

The weight of exports in GDP has considerably increased, <lb/>although it remains far below the euro area (Figure 8). It is essential that the Spanish business sector&apos;s <lb/>efforts to internationalise its activities continue and extend. <lb/>Figure 8.

Around 80% of <lb/>large companies do some kind of innovation, but this is again below rates observed in most OECD <lb/>innovative countries.

Spain has undertaken several <lb/>recent reforms to foster competition in goods and services markets. Prior to the recession profit margins <lb/>grew faster than in other euro area countries. Profit margins have moderated since the recession but remain <lb/>higher than in other euro area countries (Table 2.2). High margins reflect the need for firms to rebuild their <lb/>finances in the context of tight credit conditions, but it also signals weaknesses in effective competition in <lb/>some markets (Montero and Urtasun, 2014; Banco de España, 2014). As the recovery strengthens and <lb/>external financing becomes available at lower cost, it is essential to continue to foster competition in goods <lb/>and services markets to consolidate and reinforce competitiveness gains and to maximise the impact of <lb/>other reforms, such as those in the labour market, on job creation. <lb/>0 <lb/>10 <lb/>20 <lb/>30 <lb/>40 <lb/>50 <lb/>60 <lb/>70 <lb/>80 <lb/>90 <lb/>100 <lb/></body>

At least one third of listed firms have a debt to EBITDA (earnings before interest, <lb/>taxes, depreciation and amortisation) ratio of over four (Figure 10). There are substantial differences across <lb/>sectors and also depending on firm size (Figure 11). The level of indebtedness, defined as debt over total <lb/>net assets, for small and medium-sized companies is significantly lower than for large companies (although <lb/>it should be noted that the coverage of small firms in the sample is very reduced). In the large corporate <lb/>sector the strongest deleveraging has taken place in information and technology companies, while large <lb/>construction firm&apos;s indebtedness kept increasing until 2011, following valuation corrections that translated <lb/>into lower asset values.

			<body>At the same time the cost of borrowing remains high. Conditions are especially tight for smaller loans, <lb/>predominately used by SMEs (Figure 12). SMEs are particularly vulnerable to banking sector stress (Ryan <lb/>et al., 2014), as they have more difficulties in establishing new banking relationships and they tend to use <lb/>real-estate assets as collateral. In addition, alternatives to non-bank financing have been so far very limited. <lb/>Figure 12.

Particularly important is the interaction between product and labour market <lb/>policies. In Spain labour market policies that have resulted in dualism and precarious employment (Haugh <lb/>and Westmore, 2014) are reinforced by product, service and financial market regulation that have favoured <lb/>incumbents and left capital in unviable firms for too long. Broad reform of product, tax, insolvency and <lb/>financial market policies is required to reduce barriers to firm entry and to spur reallocation of resources <lb/>towards a new cohort of more productive, innovative, export intensive and quality-job rich enterprises. <lb/>Spain has been making good progress in improving measured product market regulations and <lb/>converging towards best practices in the areas of state control and barriers to trade and investment. <lb/>However, progress has been more muted in reducing barriers to entrepreneurship (Figure 13, Panel A). <lb/>0 <lb/>1 <lb/>2 <lb/>3 <lb/>4 <lb/>5 <lb/>6 <lb/>7 <lb/>8 <lb/>2008 <lb/>2009 <lb/>2010 <lb/>2011 <lb/>2012 <lb/>2013 <lb/>2014 <lb/>A.

Spain also ranks <lb/>142nd (out of 185) with respect to ease to start a business (World Bank and IFC, 2014). The regulatory <lb/>procedures have been too complex so far, especially the licences and permits system. Obtaining licences <lb/>and permits is more difficult in Spain than in most OECD countries (Figure 13, Panel B). Contrary to best <lb/>practices there are no standard procedures to use the &quot; silence is consent &quot; rule for issuing the licences <lb/>required to open up a business.

			<body>operate in multiple regions of Spain has been in many cases required to obtain a separate licence or permit <lb/>for their activity from the different regions where they wish to conduct business. In addition, often <lb/>requirements have differed, forcing higher costs on firms who have to adapt products to local requirements <lb/>(for example in labelling). <lb/>To tackle this and move towards a truly single market the government has introduced the Market <lb/>Unity Law. This law is a flagship reform and, if fully implemented, has the potential to revolutionise doing <lb/>business in Spain. It aims at simplifying business licensing requirements, by increasing the use of <lb/>notification procedures (with ex post controls) and reducing the need for prior authorisations to exert <lb/>economic activities. It also aims at ensuring that permits issued in one region will automatically be valid <lb/>for the others. Thus, it has the potential to improve substantially the regulatory framework, foster <lb/>competition and eliminate barriers preventing firms from taking advantage of economies of scale. The law <lb/>is inspired by the EU Services Directive, but it is broader in scope. It provides for principles of free <lb/>establishment and movement of goods and services in Spain and for their application in practice. <lb/>According to the law, all legal texts enacted at local, regional and central government level that may <lb/>be considered inconsistent with the market unity will have to be amended in the following six months. So <lb/>far 2 700 regulatory barriers, most at the regional level, have been identified as inconsistent with the <lb/>market unity. This process is to be supported by enhancing administrative cooperation, and by setting up a <lb/>procedure for responding quickly to complaints about obstacles to the single market. Spain&apos;s Competition <lb/>Authority has been granted power to file administrative appeals with regard to situations contrary to the <lb/>law. Legislative amendments will be discussed by regional and central government representatives in <lb/>sectoral conferences. The law also entails measurement and monitoring procedures, which should help to <lb/>assess implementation progress. These procedures include the elaboration of a directory of good and bad <lb/>practices and the publication of regulatory quality indicators. A swift implementation of the law, while <lb/>challenging both technically, due to the complexity of dealing with a large body of regulation, and <lb/>politically, due to resistance by some regions, will be crucial to boost the performance of the Spanish <lb/>business sector. Effective coordination and cooperation among the different levels of government will be <lb/>critical, in particular when it comes to amending sector specific legislation. <lb/>Besides the law on market unity, another on-going initiative to improve business climate is Emprende <lb/>en tres, an electronic one-stop-shop designed to present declarations of responsibility required for <lb/>entrepreneurs to start up a new economic activity, and a reduced tax rate for new corporate starts-up <lb/>introduced in 2013. The rate is 15% for new companies. Spain also foresees conducting annual reviews of <lb/>the business regulatory framework to detect and remove obstacles hampering entrepreneurship, investment <lb/>and business activities. This initiative is conducted by the Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness with <lb/>the collaboration of ICEX (Spanish Export Agency) and Invest in Spain (the Spanish body in charge of <lb/>public relations with foreign investors). First meetings with representatives of several industrial and <lb/>services sectors, academics and research services are already taking place. In addition, the World Bank will <lb/>undertake a subnational Doing Business study in Spain during 2014 and 2015, with the aim of identifying <lb/>regulatory best practices among Spanish regions and spurring regulatory improvement. <lb/>The law on Environmental Assessment 21/2013 also advocates for further standardising the <lb/>legislation across Spain in the area of environmental assessment procedures, seeking greater collaboration <lb/>and harmonisation across regions. <lb/>Favouring firms&apos; growth <lb/>Spanish business framework conditions include multiple size-dependent regulations, originally aimed <lb/>at supporting SMEs. One of them is the corporate tax that has special clauses depending on firm sizes both <lb/>in terms of turnover and number of employees. The standard corporate tax rate is 30%. The corporate rate <lb/></body>

			<note place="headnote">ECO/WKP(2014)69 <lb/></note>

			<page>20 <lb/></page>

			<body>for SMEs – defined for the tax as firms with an annual turnover below EUR 10 million – is 25% on profits <lb/>up to EUR 300 000 and 30% above that. The rate is further reduced to 20% for SMEs with net revenues <lb/>below EUR 5 million and fewer than 25 employees who have not decreased the number of workers they <lb/>employ. Despite all these preferential rates for SMEs, larger firms are capable of optimising existing <lb/>deductions, resulting in differences between statutory rates and effective rates that widen as turnover <lb/>increases. The current configuration of the tax also implies differences in effective rates within the SME <lb/>segment depending on the number of employees that the firms employ (Figure 14). The effective rate is <lb/>highest for medium-sized enterprises having between 100 and 250 employees. This creates incentives for <lb/>firms to remain small ( &quot; lock-in &quot; effect), which has serious implications for aggregate productivity given <lb/>the higher productivity that generally prevails in larger enterprises. All this indicates that the tax is not <lb/>successful in supporting SMEs and may be penalising medium-size firms and biasing firm&apos;s distributions <lb/>towards smallest sizes, to the detriment of medium-sized. Reducing tax deductions would decrease the <lb/>capacity of larger firms to avoid taxation. Using that fiscal space to establish a unique and lower corporate <lb/>tax rate for all firms would provide better incentives for firm&apos;s growth and would also align corporate <lb/>taxation with the OECD average (25.3% in 2013, Figure 15), which would contribute to attracting <lb/>investment. In this sense, the government announced in June 2014 a draft tax reform, which proposes <lb/>broadening the base, reducing tax credits, reducing the standard tax rate to 25% by 2016 and suppressing <lb/>the preferential rate for SMEs. The reduced rate for starts-up, introduced in 2013, is maintained. <lb/>Figure 14.

Firms with more than EUR 6 million in reported revenue are <lb/>monitored by the large taxpayers&apos; unit, which involves more frequent tax audits and more information <lb/>requirements. The effect of this kind of threshold on firm behaviour is strong. There is excess mass of <lb/>firms, or &quot; bunches &quot; , just below the revenue threshold and there is evidence that firms have deliberately <lb/>reduced reported revenue by up to 7.5% to avoid falling in the high enforcement regime. There is also <lb/>evidence that firms locating below the threshold misreport their material and labour input costs to evade <lb/>taxes. <lb/>There are also size-contingent regulations in the labour market that start to bind at different firm sizes. <lb/>They relate to different workers representation obligations, the availability of special employment contracts <lb/>(e.g. Contrato de emprendedores), social security contributions deductions and flexibility to change or <lb/>terminate employment contracts (Table 2.3). Risk prevention obligations also differ depending on the size <lb/>of the company. Companies above 250 employees need to elaborate, negotiate and apply an equality plan. <lb/>All these size-dependent regulations start biting at different sizes. This prevents a marked &quot; cliff &quot; effect as <lb/>in France at 50 employees (Garicano et al., 2012) but it compounds a complex system difficult and costly <lb/>to navigate. <lb/>0 <lb/>5 <lb/>10 <lb/>15 <lb/>20 <lb/>25 <lb/>30 <lb/>35 <lb/>40 <lb/>IRL <lb/>SVN <lb/>CZE <lb/>HUN <lb/>POL <lb/>CHL <lb/>FIN <lb/>ISL <lb/>TUR <lb/>EST <lb/>GBR <lb/>CHE <lb/>SVK <lb/>SWE <lb/>KOR <lb/>DNK <lb/>AUT <lb/>NLD <lb/>GRC <lb/>CAN <lb/>ISR <lb/>NOR <lb/>ITA <lb/>NZL <lb/>LUX <lb/>AUS <lb/>MEX <lb/>ESP <lb/>DEU <lb/>PRT <lb/>BEL <lb/>FRA <lb/>JPN <lb/>USA <lb/>Total <lb/>Small-business² <lb/></body>

In general, the emphasis should be on ensuring that policies support the specific needs of <lb/>SMEs (for example providing direct innovation support, as young SMEs may not have the profits to claim <lb/>R&amp;D tax credits), rather than progressively tightening regulatory requirements with size, as is currently the <lb/>case in Spain. When designing support policies, their potential effect on firms&apos; growth dynamics should be <lb/>explicitly recognised and examined, with the aim of minimising distortions and potential &quot; lock-in &quot; effects. <lb/>In general, business regulations de jure or de facto tend to be more detrimental for medium-sized <lb/>companies than for large or small companies. It is easier to ignore regulations when businesses are small. <lb/>Large companies have more legal and administrative resources that enable them to legally optimise and <lb/>exploit existing regulations. Medium-size companies neither can ignore regulations nor have resources to <lb/>deal efficiently with them. <lb/>Increasing and deepening internationalisation <lb/>Export performance has been mixed <lb/>The Spanish external sector has led the recovery and export performance has been better in Spain than <lb/>in other European economies (Figure 16). Both goods and services explain this performance. On the back <lb/>of improving cost-competitiveness and the need to search for new markets given the weakness in domestic <lb/>demand, goods exports have increased across most product categories. Additionally, services exports, <lb/>notably tourism, have also grown steadily since 2008. To further lift exports Spain faces four main <lb/>challenges: increasing the number of regular exporters; up-grading the technological content of exports; <lb/>diversifying trading partners; and ensuring that the business environment is favourable for both goods and <lb/>services exports. <lb/>ECO/WKP(2014)69 <lb/></body>

			<body>strong, exports will increase even if competitiveness does not improve. A constant market share analysis <lb/>(CMSA) can help to disentangle and measure these factors (González Pandiella, 2014).The basic idea <lb/>underpinning this analysis is that changes in exports are due either to changes in individual market shares <lb/>or to a specialisation in particularly dynamic markets or industries. A CMSA decomposes the difference <lb/>between the growth of Spanish manufacturing exports and the growth of total exports of the rest of the <lb/>world in two factors (Annex 2.A1). On one hand, the so-called market share effect captures the gain or loss <lb/>in shares that would occur if the export structure, whether in geographical or sectoral terms, were to remain <lb/>unchanged. It seeks to capture the extent to which changes in shares have been due to changes in price and <lb/>non-price competitiveness. On the other hand, the structure effect quantifies the extent to which the <lb/>country is benefiting from an advantageous position in terms of the composition of its exports. In turn, the <lb/>structural effect can be divided into a product effect, a geographical effect and a mixed effect. The first two <lb/>show the gain in share arising, respectively, from exporting products and from exporting towards regions <lb/>where demand has been more dynamic. The mixed effect captures the interaction of both effects, given the <lb/>impossibility of distinguishing perfectly between them. <lb/>The CMSA signals that, in the more recent periods, changes in market shares have been the main <lb/>driving force behind Spanish manufacturing export performance (Figure 18, Panel A). The negative total <lb/>effect indicates that Spanish exports grew less than world exports from 2003 to 2011, except in 2007. The <lb/>main contributor was the market share effect, indicating that the below-average growth of exports was due <lb/>to losses of competitiveness. However, a cross-country comparison reveals that losses of market shares <lb/>were less pronounced in Spain than in other European advanced economies (Figure 19, Panel A), including <lb/>Germany. Gains in competitiveness started to pay off in 2012 when Spanish goods exports grew above <lb/>world exports. <lb/>Figure 18.

The sector covered is manufacturing (excluding energy) plus agriculture, <lb/>forestry and fishing. <lb/>Source: Calculations based on OECD (2014), International Trade by Commodity Statistics (ITCS Database), May. <lb/>How to read this figure: Total effect is the difference between the growth rates of Spanish exports and of world exports. The market <lb/>effect aggregates the variation of shares in individual export markets. The combined structure effect can be decomposed into product <lb/>and geographical structure effect plus a residual term (so-called mixed effect). Product and geographical effects are positive if a <lb/>country has above average specialisation in markets that grow faster than overall world trade. Conversely, high specialisation in slow-<lb/>growing markets gives rise to negative structure effects. <lb/>ECO/WKP(2014)69 <lb/></body>

The sector covered is manufacturing (excluding energy) plus agriculture, <lb/>forestry and fishing. <lb/>Source: Calculations based on OECD (2014), International Trade by Commodity Statistics (ITCS Database), May. <lb/>The CMSA also highlights that Spanish export performance could have been even better if industry <lb/>and market specialisation were more geared towards more dynamic segments. For example the <lb/>contribution of the product structure to export performance has remained broadly unchanged over time <lb/>(Figure 19, Panel B). By contrast, Germany&apos;s evolution of product specialisation has been more favourable <lb/>to its export performance, reflecting a higher specialisation in products experiencing higher growth such as <lb/>medium to high technology products. Italy, had a similar evolution in product structure as Spain until 2006, <lb/>and has also recently improved the contribution of product specialisation to export performance by shifting <lb/>its sectoral export structure towards more dynamic products. <lb/>This highlights one of the main weaknesses of the Spanish external sector. Despite recent progress, <lb/>the product structure has remained broadly unchanged in Spain during the last ten years (Figure 20). Low-<lb/>technology exports have increased slightly even though this is an export segment that has grown below <lb/>average in world trade. The share of motor vehicles and components in total exports has fallen but this <lb/>remains a key sector in Spanish exports. Other medium-high technology exports have slightly increased <lb/>but they have done so below aggregate growth.

Products are grouped by the level of research and development intensity in the industry. <lb/>Source: Calculations based on OECD (2014), International Trade by Commodity Statistics (ITCS Database), May. <lb/>Spain&apos;s mix of trading partners has not been conducive to better goods export performance either <lb/>(Figure 19, Panel C). This reflects an over-specialisation in European markets that have grown below <lb/>average, such as France, Italy and Portugal. Around 63% of exports are destined for the European Union. <lb/>At the same time there is an under-specialisation in more dynamic markets, such as China and other Asian <lb/>economies. Exports to markets such as China and other emerging economies have recently increased, but <lb/>by less than world exports to those destinations. <lb/>Internationalisation policy needs to take also strong account of the services sector. Services account <lb/>for an increasing share of Spanish total exports and have significantly contributed to the rebalancing of the <lb/>Spanish economy and the return of the current account balance to positive territory. Most services <lb/>categories have grown since 2007, the exception is financial services. In terms of product composition, <lb/>tourism and travel account for more than 40% of total exports (Figure 21, Panel A). Geographically, as in <lb/>manufacturing goods, nearly 70% of export services are destined for the European Union (Figure 21, Panel <lb/>B). As in goods, Spain faces the challenge of increasing penetration of its services exports into non-<lb/>European markets and widening its product specialisation beyond labour-intensive services. <lb/>10.3 <lb/>25.7 <lb/>19.5 <lb/>15.6 <lb/>21.7 <lb/>2003 <lb/>10.6 <lb/>19.0 <lb/>22.9 <lb/>17.3 <lb/>23.5 <lb/>2013 <lb/>High <lb/>High <lb/>Motor vehicles <lb/>Other medium-high <lb/>Medium-low <lb/>Low <lb/>Motor vehicles <lb/>Other medium-high <lb/>Medium-low <lb/>Low <lb/>ECO/WKP(2014)69 <lb/></body>

To increase the number of regular <lb/>exporters, Spain should take advantage of the group of Spanish multinationals with substantial <lb/>international experience by establishing more formal mechanisms of collaboration between them and <lb/>SMEs attempting to gain access to new markets. <lb/>Moving towards a product structure with higher technology content requires stepping up business <lb/>innovation activities. Innovation and export participation have been found to be heavily interlinked, both in <lb/>Spain (Caldera, 2010) and internationally (Altomonte et al., 2013; Aw et al., 2011). Exporters often access <lb/>diverse knowledge inputs not available in the domestic market (Salomon and Shaver, 2005). Product <lb/>innovation is a very important driver of exports for Spanish firms, notably SMEs (Cassiman et al., 2010), <lb/>suggesting that export promotion policies should be combined with policies focused on promoting product <lb/>innovation. Thus, coordinating and integrating internationalisation and innovation policies under a single <lb/>responsibility would likely be beneficial. It would allow effects of diverse policies to be internalised, avoid <lb/>potential duplications and could increase synergies between various modes of innovation and <lb/>internationalisation. In this sense, the Strategic Plan for the Internationalisation of the Spanish Economy <lb/>includes measures for a closer collaboration between the export promotion agency, ICEX, and the Centre <lb/>for Technological and Industrial Development (CDTI). <lb/>Efforts to improve business framework conditions are likely to have also a positive effect in attracting <lb/>additional foreign direct investment (FDI). Encouraging greater FDI would help to boost the technological <lb/>content of exports by bringing new technologies and processes to Spain. Indeed, economies such as Ireland <lb/>have used foreign investment to establish entire new high technology industries such as medical devices <lb/>and pharmaceuticals. Another of the measures of the Strategic Plan for the Internationalisation of the <lb/>Spanish Economy is the establishment of a new programme to attract and facilitate direct foreign <lb/>investment in the information and communication technology sector. Greater foreign investment would <lb/>also provide more potential for linkages into global value chains for Spanish SMEs. FDI inflows into Spain <lb/>have been falling since 2000 (Figure 22). Nevertheless, Spain has recently managed to attract and maintain <lb/>a healthy pipeline of FDI in the automobile sector. FDI inflows increased in 2013, reflecting rising investor <lb/>confidence and existing opportunities in some sectors under restructuring such as banking or construction. <lb/>42 <lb/>25 <lb/>16 <lb/>5 <lb/>4 <lb/>3 <lb/>A.

			<body>Nevertheless, inflows into higher-technology sectors are more limited.

Maritime <lb/>transport activities show low productivity and reducing these and other trading costs associated with more <lb/>distant markets should be a priority (discussed below). <lb/>Table 4.

			<body>above mentioned opinion surveys on regulation, the subnational Doing Business study by the World Bank <lb/>and the market unity law. It also includes a new programme to facilitate the international mobility of <lb/>investors, entrepreneurs, researchers and professionals, the setting up a new Global Window at ICEX, to <lb/>provide information to SMEs on all available public support instruments, and renewed programmes to <lb/>access new markets. Progress will be monitored through a set of indicators. <lb/>Strengthening competition and boosting cost competitiveness <lb/>Strengthening competition is also vital for sustaining and reinforcing the ongoing recovery of cost <lb/>competitiveness needed to underpin further internationalisation of the economy. Countries with more <lb/>competitive regulatory frameworks for services achieve higher added value, productivity and export <lb/>growth in the manufacturing sectors that use services as inputs more intensively (Barone and Cingano, <lb/>2011). The potential beneficial effects are particularly strong for Spain, which is one of the OECD <lb/>countries whose manufacturing exports embody higher value added from services (OECD, 2013d). Indeed, <lb/>for Spain the adoption of the best regulatory practices in services could increase real goods exports by 18% <lb/>(Correa-López and Doménech, 2014). <lb/>An important lever for boosting competition generally is to facilitate new firm entry and growth by <lb/>allowing more flexibility in wage bargaining. New firms need to be able to offer different conditions from <lb/>incumbents as a way of offsetting the often sizeable advantages of incumbency. Indeed, inflexible labour <lb/>markets lead to less dynamic firm growth distributions (Bravo-Biosca et al., 2013). Stringent regulation <lb/>increases the costs of downward adjustment and is likely to encourage a more conservative growth strategy <lb/>(which in turns decreases the pressure on underperforming firms). Lower risk taking and slower job <lb/>reallocation may in turn reduce productivity growth. Firms may be less willing to expand their workforce <lb/>or enter into new markets if they cannot reduce their workforce later if their efforts prove to be <lb/>unsuccessful. Recent changes in Spanish labour market regulations have provided a less stringent <lb/>protection legislation regime that gives more scope for new firms to offer different wage and working <lb/>conditions from incumbents. However, more can be done to decentralise wage-bargaining processes and <lb/>thereby reduce the power of incumbent companies to use sectorial agreements as barriers to entry (Haugh <lb/>and Westmore, 2014). <lb/>Actions need also to be taken to increase competition in sectors that provide inputs used by nearly all <lb/>firms. This is an important avenue for reducing non-labour costs and improving competitiveness of <lb/>Spanish firms in international markets. Areas of key concern include electricity, professional services, <lb/>ports and oil distribution because of their pervasive use by the business sector and/or importance for <lb/>exporting. Increasing the efficiency of the judicial system would also help to lower costs for a large part of <lb/>the business sector. <lb/>Increasing competition in professional services <lb/>Business services, in particular professional services which account for 75% of business services, are <lb/>markedly less productive in Spain than in other European economies (Figure 23). This is coupled with <lb/>entry requirements that are above the OECD average (Figure 24) and practices far from those in the best <lb/>performing countries. The services trade restrictiveness index for Spain is also above the OECD average in <lb/>business services, particularly legal and accounting services (OECD, 2014). In addition, there is an <lb/>unusually large number of professions for which there is a requirement to be a member of the professional <lb/>body. Opening up these services to competition would increase productivity, drive down prices, improve <lb/>the quality of the services and provide more job opportunities. <lb/></body>

			<body>professions for which membership to the professional body would be compulsory. However, the final <lb/>reform seems to be less ambitious than originally planned on this front. It would be important that the <lb/>original ambition and spirit of the law is maintained by ensuring that membership fees cannot act as <lb/>barriers to entry to the professions. The reform could also potentially increase the mobility and competition <lb/>among providers of professional services throughout Spain and therefore can be framed within the effort <lb/>being undertaken via the market unity law to create a truly unified domestic market. Once the law is <lb/>approved, the consistency of sector specific legislation, including regional legislation and professional <lb/>organisations&apos; internal rules, with the new regulatory framework will also need to be swiftly ensured so <lb/>that the liberalisation is fully effective. <lb/>Fostering competition in network industries <lb/>Spain has made good progress in liberalising network industries. At the same time some sectors, such <lb/>as electricity and gas, are dominated by large vertically integrated companies. The electricity sector has <lb/>recently been at the centre of intense debate because of reforms to eliminate the so-called electricity tariff <lb/>deficit (see Assessment and Recommendations). Electricity prices are high in international comparison, <lb/>especially for SMEs (Figure 25). The new electricity price mechanism has the potential to incentivise more <lb/>effective price competition between different electricity providers. Nevertheless possible uncompetitive <lb/>price setting practices have already been identified by the competition authority (CNMC, 2014a), which <lb/>has claimed in multiple instances that the degree of competition in the wholesale market is insufficient <lb/>(CNC, 2013a). The market is dominated by two firms (Endesa and Iberdrola) which are involved in all <lb/>areas of activity and manage more than 70% of electricity demand via commercialisers and distributors. <lb/>The existing separation between distribution and commercialisation activities has been deemed insufficient <lb/>by the competition authority, despite existing requirements for legal and accounting separations. <lb/>Competition in the electricity sector could be strengthened by reinforcing the separation between <lb/>distribution and commercialisation, and also between distribution and other related activities such as the <lb/>installation of measurement equipment, where distributors can take advantage of their incumbent position <lb/>and information. Competition would be further boosted by ensuring a more level playing field between <lb/>incumbents and potential entrants, such as independent commercialisers, and by reducing the cost <lb/>associated to entering these activities. <lb/>Figure 25.

			<body>In this context, ensuring that the regulator can act effectively to avoid undue barriers to entry is <lb/>fundamental. In international perspective, there seems to be room to widen the scope of actions that the <lb/>regulator can undertake in electricity and gas areas (Figure 26). In particular, it would be beneficial that the <lb/>regulator reviews and approves contract terms between regulated entities or market actors, and issues <lb/>industry standards, guidelines and codes of conduct, as done in other OECD countries. <lb/>Figure 26.

The index is zero for <lb/>countries where no bar appears. <lb/>Source: OECD (2013), Product Market Regulation Database, www.oecd.org/economy/pmr. <lb/>Low cross-border transmission capacity with France has also contributed to inefficiencies and higher <lb/>costs in the Spanish electricity sector. It prevents Spain from engaging in cross-border trade in electricity <lb/>and gas, and from profiting from its overcapacity in electricity generation: only around 44 gigawatts are <lb/>used at peak demand compared with 100 gigawatts installed. A new electricity interconnection with France <lb/>was supposed to be operational in 2014 but its entry into service has been further postponed. More <lb/>effective interconnections with Portugal and France would foster competition between electricity and gas <lb/>companies, increase the liquidity of both markets, allow diversity of supply and provide a more <lb/>competitive environment. <lb/>0.0 <lb/>0.5 <lb/>1.0 <lb/>1.5 <lb/>2.0 <lb/>2.5 <lb/>3.0 <lb/>3.5 <lb/>4.0 <lb/>4.5 <lb/>5.0 <lb/>GBR <lb/>ITA <lb/>PRT <lb/>FRA <lb/>OECD <lb/>ESP <lb/>DEU <lb/>A.

			<body>Boosting competition in ports <lb/>Boosting competition in ports and lowering costs for exporters is key to boosting cost-competiveness <lb/>of Spanish firms and fostering internationalisation. The port regulator is not an independent body, contrary <lb/>to international best practices and to practices followed in other regulated sectors in Spain. Instead the <lb/>regulator is a ministerial department or agency, whose decisions can be overturned by governmental or <lb/>ministerial bodies. The port system in Spain is composed of 28 port authorities, which have ample <lb/>autonomy and depend largely on regional authorities. <lb/>Sea and coastal freight water transport activities have low productivity (Figure 27), despite Spain <lb/>having several ports that are large by European standards (e.g. Barcelona, Algeciras or Valencia), <lb/>suggesting the possibility of significant economies of scale. One direct and damaging implication is that <lb/>the cost to trade is significantly higher in Spain than in other OECD countries (discussed above). In some <lb/>instances anticompetitive policies and undue barriers to entry have been identified (CNC, 2013b). <lb/>Figure 27. Productivity in sea and coastal freight water transport <lb/>Apparent labour productivity, gross value added in thousand euros per person employed, 2011 <lb/>1 <lb/>1. <lb/>2010 for Greece, 2009 for Belgium and Turkey, 2008 for United Kingdom. <lb/>Source: Eurostat (2014), &quot; Structural business Statistics – Services &quot; , Eurostat Database, July. <lb/>Transport costs tend to have a disproportionate effect on trade volumes (Clark et al., 2004). In <lb/>general, it has been estimated that raising transport costs by 10% can reduce trade volumes by more than <lb/>20% (Limao and Venables, 2000). While Spain&apos;s regulated port costs have been decreasing, stevedoring <lb/>costs remain very high in international perspective, and these services typically account for the largest <lb/>percentage of the total cost of moving goods through a port. Stevedoring activities are restricted to a pool <lb/>of exclusive workers. Cargo-handling companies are not allowed to resort to the market to employ their <lb/>staff. Instead, cargo-handling companies are required to participate financially in the capital of private <lb/>companies, which in turn provide them with the required workforce. Only when the workforce proposed by <lb/>these private companies is not suitable or not sufficient can the cargo-handling companies freely hire staff <lb/>from the market. These restrictive labour practices discourage the entry of new cargo-handling providers, <lb/>posing a barrier to attract new investment. This regime is having a significant impact in the productivity <lb/>and competitiveness of Spanish ports and is hampering the Spanish export sector. According to the <lb/>European Commission it violates the principle of free establishment of economic activity, although the <lb/>issue has been brought to the court of justice of the EU. Access to stevedoring activities should be opened <lb/>and adjusted to the EU legislation. <lb/>0 <lb/>50 <lb/>100 <lb/>150 <lb/>200 <lb/>250 <lb/>300 <lb/>350 <lb/>400 <lb/>HUN FRA TUR SVK GRC SVN SWE PRT POL ESP FIN <lb/>ITA DNK NLD EU28 DEU NOR GBR BEL <lb/></body>

			<body>Increasing contestability in oil distribution <lb/>Oil distribution continues to be impaired by lack of sufficient contestability. These are important input <lb/>markets for many other sectors of the economy, whose international competitiveness is hampered. Recent <lb/>trend in gross margins in the fuel distribution sector are characteristic of uncompetitive markets (CNMC, <lb/>2014b). Consumers face high pre-tax fuel prices compared with international fuel prices and with pre-tax <lb/>prices in other advanced European economies (Avedillo Carretero, 2013). The concentration in the <lb/>automotive fuel sector remains too high and there is evidence of aligned pricing practices between the two <lb/>main operators, REPSOL and CEPSA. There is also a high level of vertical integration between supply, <lb/>refining and retail activities. Low-cost fuel retailers have a low market share and the competition between <lb/>service stations located on major roads is low. In July 2013, the government simplified procedures for <lb/>opening service stations and introduced some measures which reduce the power of established distributors <lb/>against independent retailers. The number of openings of independent service stations has grown but <lb/>increasing contestability in the distribution sector remains yet necessary. Simplifying the opening of <lb/>service stations in supermarkets and hypermarkets and reducing the duration of long-term agreements <lb/>giving exclusive operating rights over service stations have provided positive competition dynamics in the <lb/>past in some regions, which should be further exploited. <lb/>Improving judicial efficiency <lb/>The judicial system is also an important source of costs for business and improving its efficiency is an <lb/>important path for increasing cost-competitiveness and economic performance (Palumbo et al., 2013). <lb/>More efficient judicial systems have a positive effect on the size of firms, both internationally (Kumar <lb/>et al., 1999; Beck et al., 2006) and in Spain (García-Posada and Mora-Sanguinetti, 2013a). It also has a <lb/>positive effect on the entry rate of Spanish firms (García-Posada and Mora-Sanguinetti, 2014). <lb/>The Spanish judicial system does not rank well internationally in terms of efficiency. Spain holds <lb/>position 26 out of a total of 35 legal systems in its ability to resolve disputes before the first instance courts <lb/>(Palumbo et al. 2013). Spain ranks 21st out of 31 OECD countries in terms of enforcing contracts (World <lb/>Bank and IFC, 2014). Clearance rates are low, the case backlog remains high, and procedures are relatively <lb/>lengthy (European Commission, 2013), despite some recent improvement (European Commission, 2014). <lb/>The government has adopted measures to enhance the efficiency of the judicial system, including <lb/>reorganising the courts, implementing electronic judicial files and promoting out-of-court solutions to <lb/>conflicts. However, significant problems remain. A critical problem from the business perspective are the <lb/>so-called recursos administrativos, which are appeals against the public administration, over for example a <lb/>tax liability or denial of a permit, that need to be undertaken before reaching the ordinary judicial system. <lb/>These administrative appeals are slow to make findings and rarely conclude on the merits of the case. They <lb/>should be replaced by time limited administrative mediation processes that would automatically be deemed <lb/>as in a firm&apos;s favour if the time limit is exceeded. <lb/>In addition, despite significant investment in information and communication technologies, the new <lb/>tools are not yet readily available in all courts. Promoting further mediation arrangements can provide <lb/>faster and more efficient conflict resolutions. Increasing competition in the legal profession could also <lb/>induce lower litigation and hence have a positive effect on the efficiency of the system. The pressure <lb/>exercised by competition among lawyers would constrain their potential rents, thereby reducing the <lb/>number of cases that the lawyers may find profitable to bring to court rather than settle (OECD, 2013e). <lb/></body>

			<body>Tackling over-indebtedness and improving access to finance <lb/>Facilitating insolvency procedures to help restore credit growth <lb/>Boosting the performance of the business sector requires faster rehabilitation or closing down of the <lb/>high number of firms that carry excessive debt burdens. Quickly restructuring corporate debts and putting <lb/>viable firms on the path to recovery would in turn clean-up bank balance sheets allowing banks to focus on <lb/>new lending and reallocating capital to new and more productive firms. <lb/>An efficient insolvency regime is a pre-requisite for achieving this but so far the Spanish insolvency <lb/>law has proved of little use to facilitate the restructuring of viable firms and swift liquidation of unviable <lb/>ones (Mora-Sanguinetti and Fuentes, 2012). Business bankruptcy rates in Spain were among the lowest in <lb/>the world before the 2009 economic crisis. Existing procedures appeared to be unduly complex and <lb/>judicial resolution periods tended to be too long, which is part of the broader judicial efficiency problems <lb/>discussed above. In 2012 regular procedures lasted an average of 649 days, while the duration of simplified <lb/>procedures, that are supposed to be shorter, was 665 days (Van Hemmen, 2013). To correct this <lb/>inefficiency the government introduced several changes within its entrepreneurship law. The government <lb/>has recently reviewed them again (Decree of refinancing agreements and debt restructuring) to make it <lb/>easier to get prior agreements on write-offs, maturity extensions and debt-for-equity swaps, and to reduce <lb/>the majority needed for creditor agreements to be approved. In many cases liabilities with tax and social <lb/>security authorities account for a very significant part of the debt, but so far both authorities have not been <lb/>allowed to restructure their debts. Clear guidelines for the participation of both authorities in the <lb/>restructuring process should be established. <lb/>Bankruptcy rates are low for SMEs, and, in particular, for micro enterprises. In contrast with the low <lb/>incidence of business bankruptcies, business related mortgage foreclosures have soared during the crisis. <lb/>Small business owners tend to finance their firms with loans secured on their homes, and, if lenders <lb/>repossess the collateral, that will be reflected as residential foreclosures instead of as bankruptcies. The <lb/>small rate of small businesses filing for bankruptcy suggests that these procedures are more costly and <lb/>drawn out than the main alternative procedure, the mortgage foreclosure, and that the personal bankruptcy <lb/>law is unattractive to the individual debtor (García-Posada and Mora-Sanguinetti, 2013b). The challenges <lb/>ahead are to enable viable SMEs to restructure unsustainable debt and get recapitalised; and to ensure <lb/>nonviable SMEs cease their activities in an orderly fashion to allow effective redeployment of capital and <lb/>other resources. Insolvency procedures often fail to meet the needs of SMEs (European Commission, <lb/>2012). Alternative procedures, proportionate to the size of the business, should be put in place to make <lb/>adequate solutions available for all types of SMEs. Given the limited capacity of the judicial system and <lb/>the need for rapid resolutions, promoting and facilitating voluntary out-of-court restructurings for SMEs <lb/>could provide a cost-effective and swift alternative to court supervised proceedings. <lb/>The government recently introduced new out-of-court pre-insolvency payment procedures for SMEs <lb/>(acuerdo extrajudicial de pagos). The payment agreement must be approved by 60% of creditors, have a <lb/>maximum haircut of 25%, and involve a payment moratorium limited to three years. Public creditors are <lb/>excluded from the negotiations. This new procedure is a decisive step to alleviate financial distress of <lb/>SMEs in a swift manner. Nevertheless, its current configuration does not offer sufficient incentives for its <lb/>use. The procedure could be made more effective by permitting the debt haircut to go above the current <lb/>25% maximum and the payment moratorium above three years. A significant proportion of SMEs&apos; debts <lb/>are liabilities with tax and social security authorities. Integrating these liabilities in the payment plan would <lb/>be an additional step to make these procedures more effective. These procedures are facilitated by <lb/>mediators. The government is planning to change the way mediators are selected, appointed and <lb/>remunerated. This is welcome since the current system does not provide sufficient incentives to avoid long <lb/>processes ending in the final liquidation of firms. <lb/></body>

			<body>The recent entrepreneurship law created a new category to foster entrepreneurship (empresario de <lb/>responsabilidad limitada), according to which the entrepreneur can preserve their main residence from any <lb/>payment obligation originating from their entrepreneurship activities. This category puts undue emphasis <lb/>on protecting housing assets to the detriment of other type of assets. In general, setting-up insolvency <lb/>procedures providing clear and swift procedures for debt restructuring and resolution has been found to <lb/>have a far more decisive impact in fostering entrepreneurship than partial measures to protect <lb/>entrepreneurs&apos; assets. In this sense, introducing a new personal insolvency framework allowing for a <lb/>discharge of unresolved personal debt after liquidation or a payment plan for financially responsible <lb/>individuals, as existing in other EU countries, is a preferable alternative to tackle over-indebtedness of <lb/>individual entrepreneurs and increase entrepreneurship. Existing alternatives are too narrow in scope and <lb/>too stringent in their requirements to be broadly used or to have a significant impact. <lb/>Moving towards more diversified financing <lb/>Bank-lending has been the predominant financing source in Spain. The crisis boosted bank <lb/>disintermediation, in particular for larger firms that have increased issuance of corporate debt (Figure 28). <lb/>Issuance remains though below those observed in more developed corporate bond markets, such as <lb/>Germany, France or Italy. Market funding opportunities for SMEs have been more limited though. <lb/>Moreover, SMEs have more difficulties to establish new banking relationships and they tend to use as <lb/>collateral real-estate assets, whose value has fallen, which complicates further their access to credit. <lb/>Figure 28. Structure of non-financial corporations&apos; liabilities <lb/>Net incurrence of liabilities, billion euros <lb/>Source: Bank of Spain (2014), Financial Accounts of the Spanish Economy (database), July. <lb/>The downsizing of the banking sector makes the development of alternative, capital market-based <lb/>sources of finance more urgent, especially for SMEs. Developing non-bank financing, would also reduce <lb/>banks&apos; market power, which may help to make Spanish bank lending rates more responsive to monetary <lb/>policy. Where banks in Europe face limited competition, and firms depend on them, financing constraints <lb/>for SMEs have been found to be higher (Ryan et al., 2014). Moreover, in normal downturns, healthy banks <lb/>help to cushion the shock, but when recessions have coincided with financial crises the impact on GDP has <lb/>been three times more severe for bank-oriented economies than for market-oriented ones (Gambacorta <lb/>et al., 2014).

			<body>not have collateral or a track record. Thus, developing non-bank financing channels would make the <lb/>Spanish financial system more balanced, more resistant to shocks and more prone to entrepreneurship. <lb/>With that aim the government has launched a wide array of initiatives, including developing alternative <lb/>securities markets, improving the public guarantee system and venture capital initiatives (discussed below). <lb/>The effects of these initiatives will unfold progressively over time, and in the meantime measures to <lb/>improve firms&apos; access to bank finance are also required. <lb/>Improving access to bank financing <lb/>One way to improve the financing conditions of SMEs is to provide banks with funds to be used to <lb/>make loans to SMEs. In Spain, this is done via the Official Credit institute (Instituto de Crédito Oficial, <lb/>ICO) intermediation facilities. Through these facilities ICO provides funds to banks at a lower cost on the <lb/>condition that the funds are lent for a certain kind of activity or type of firm, including SMEs. Banks <lb/>assume fully the credit risk and charge a premium to remunerate their operating costs and the credit risk <lb/>assumed. ICO sets a ceiling for this premium, which currently stands at about 4%. The German <lb/>government agency Kreditanstalt für Wiederaufbau (KfW), OSEO in France and the European Investment <lb/>bank (EIB) also use these kind of facilities. Via these facilities ICO granted credit amounting to EUR 14 <lb/>billion in 2013 (an increase of 20% with respect to 2012), having a material impact in the incipient <lb/>recovery in the flow of new credit. In the first half of 2014 credit disposition amounted to EUR 10.9 <lb/>billion, which is a record figure. In the short-term, these facilities can be effective in improving firms&apos; <lb/>access to finance. Nevertheless, in the medium-term, the emphasis should move towards more market-<lb/>based alternatives currently under development (discussed below) and to make firms less dependent on <lb/>publicly supported bank finance. <lb/>Well-structured mutual guarantee schemes (MGS) can also play a decisive role in improving firms&apos; <lb/>access to bank finance. They spread some of the risk and thereby enable banks to extend loans to firms that <lb/>would find it difficult to access credit otherwise or to do it under better conditions (Columba et al., 2009). <lb/>For banks they can act as an important risk mitigation mechanism since they do not need to provision loans <lb/>guaranteed by MGS. <lb/>In Spain, MGS are a special type of limited liability society with two types of shareholders: <lb/> &quot; participatory members &quot; , who subscribe some shares against the guarantee service (currently about <lb/>100 000 SMEs); and &quot; protective members &quot; , which include local authorities, banks, chambers of commerce <lb/>and other entities that are involved in SME development. Typically, the guarantees issued by MGS cover <lb/>100% of the bank loan. The Spanish system of public support to MGS is based on counter-guarantees <lb/>granted by CERSA (Compañía Española de Reafianzamiento, SA), which is under the Ministry of <lb/>Industry, Energy and Tourism (OECD, 2013b). CERSA can cover up to 75% of the risk, depending on size <lb/>and conditions of the loan. The rest of the risk is covered by the MGS themselves. A new measure <lb/>introduced recently in Spanish regulation allows banks benefiting from a guarantee from a MGS to request <lb/>the reimbursement of its claim directly from the counter-guarantor, CERSA. This reduces significantly the <lb/>counterparty risk of the bank with the MGS. <lb/>MGS could play an important role in the current financing environment, where SMEs face relatively <lb/>strict financing conditions and banks must ensure a high level of capital quality. MGS offer the competitive <lb/>advantage of being close to the borrowers. This allows an effective monitoring and screening of loan <lb/>applications. It is estimated that banks can obtain 45% risk-weighted yields on operations with guarantees, <lb/>compared with 16.5% without guarantees and that the cost of the loan for the SME would be reduced by <lb/>250 basis points (PWC, 2014). Moreover, MGS tend to provide firms with long-term financing, while <lb/>SMEs usually obtain short-term loans from banks. Therefore they can contribute to SMEs moving towards <lb/>a more balanced financing term structure. <lb/></body>

			<page>39 <lb/></page>

			<body>The use of MGS in Spain is lower than in other countries with a similar firm structure such as Italy <lb/>and Portugal. The volume of outstanding guarantees amounted to 0.6% of GDP in Spain in 2011, <lb/>compared with 2.2% and 1.9% in Italy and Portugal (OECD, 2013b). A more extended use of MGS in <lb/>Spain will likely require a change in scale. There are currently 23 MGS in Spain, but some do not have <lb/>sufficient capital to significantly expand their activity (PWC, 2014). In general, a change in scale, with <lb/>mergers or consolidation can help reduce the relative costs of the service, as well as broaden the offer of <lb/>guarantee instruments (OECD, 2013b). Larger MGS can also provide more professional management and <lb/>screening tools. A consolidation process is underway, after the entrepreneurship law increased equity and <lb/>resources requirements for MGS. At the same time, there is a trade-off between efficient scale and <lb/>proximity to borrowers, which historically has been MGS&apos; competitive advantage. Strengthening the <lb/>public counter-guarantee by further increasing the resources of CERSA may also be required. That would <lb/>imply an increase in contingent liabilities for the government. Thus, it should be accompanied by regular <lb/>stress tests to check the solvency of the guarantee system. <lb/>Developing alternatives to bank-lending <lb/>Besides bank loans, alternative financing sources are important, especially for high-growth firms that <lb/>want to diversify their funding basis or need a mix of debt and equity. As Spain&apos;s recovery gains steam, it <lb/>will be critical to supplement bank lending with new sources of finance, so that bank capacity constraints <lb/>do not hold back the necessary financing of new business. One of the main alternatives is venture capital, <lb/>which has remained underdeveloped in Spain so far (Figure 29). To contribute to the development of the <lb/>venture capital market, the government has launched a programme called Fond-ICO Global. It is the first <lb/>public venture capital &quot; fund of funds &quot; created in Spain, and has a budget of EUR 1.2 billion. It seeks to <lb/>promote the creation of privately managed venture capital funds investing in Spanish companies at <lb/>different stages of development, with the goal to mobilise around EUR 5 billion of funds. The venture <lb/>capital funds in which Fond-ICO Global invests must have a majority of private capital and a presence in <lb/>Spain. The amount of capital invested by Fond-ICO Global in each fund will depend on the stages in which <lb/>it invests and the size of the fund. The emphasis in ensuring a majority of private capital is welcomed, <lb/>since government venture capital efforts have been found to have a positive impact when they have a <lb/>minority position and not when they are leaders (Brander et al., 2012; Grilli and Murtinu, 2014). The <lb/>selection of venture capital funds in which Fond-ICO participates is done via successive tender procedures. <lb/>It would be important to ensure a systematic and unified evaluation of the results of the first tenders so that <lb/>future calls can be adapted based on the results of that evaluation. <lb/>Figure 29.

			<body>Stock markets geared towards smaller firms are important complement to venture capital schemes. <lb/>Contrary to Germany or the United Kingdom where alternative stock exchanges are vibrant, the Spanish <lb/>alternative market, MAB (Mercado Alternativo Bursátil), has remained less developed: 22 firms are <lb/>currently listed, reflecting that not many SMEs comply with some of the requirements to list in the market <lb/>(e.g. estimated value of the free float above EUR 2 million). Spain has also recently launched an <lb/>alternative fixed-income market (MARF, in its Spanish acronym). MARF&apos;s potential issuers are large <lb/>unlisted companies, with EBITDA levels of at least EUR 12 million. Given these requirements, a massive <lb/>entry of issuers in this new market should not be expected (Guijarro and Mañueco, 2013). So far six <lb/>issuances have taken place. MARF targets solely institutional investors and the minimum unit issue <lb/>amount is EUR 100 000. The examples of Germany and Norway, with markets raising volumes of funds <lb/>that represent 1% and 0.13% of GDP, are good benchmarks for MARF&apos;s potential capacity. Nevertheless, <lb/>the predominance of small firms in the corporate sector in Spain will constrain the total funds that can be <lb/>raised compared to other European economies more populated by medium-sized companies. <lb/>Other measures would also help firms financing <lb/>Access to credit by SMEs would also be improved if assessing borrower creditworthiness becomes <lb/>easier. Mechanisms to facilitate the regular production of uniform, quality data on the most important <lb/>aspects of the business of SMEs would help. Banque de France has been identified as the institution <lb/>collecting the most comprehensive set of data on SMEs (IIF, 2013), and this is coupled with the lowest <lb/>spread between loans to large companies and loans to SMEs in the euro area. Banque de France requires <lb/>detailed reporting on all loans larger than EUR 25 000, and from this data they compile credit scores on <lb/>around 280 000 companies operating in France, the majority of which are SMEs. The credit scores and <lb/>related financial information, including aggregated bank claims for an individual SME, are made available <lb/>to French banks. Establishing a comprehensive central credit registry similar to the Banque de France <lb/>model would significantly reduce information asymmetries and contribute to banks providing SMEs with <lb/>loans at better terms. <lb/>The current framework of public financial support for SMEs, which rests on a broad variety of <lb/>instruments provided by various institutions, could also be simplified to make it easier for SMEs to absorb <lb/>information and access support. Simplification and consolidation may increase the effectiveness and cost-<lb/>efficiency of the system and avoid duplications. In addition to ICO there are several agencies and <lb/>institutions providing financing support to Spanish companies such as Compañía Española de Financiación <lb/>del Desarrollo (COFIDES) and Empresa Nacional de Innovación, SA (ENISA). In some cases these <lb/>institutions have cross-shareholdings and the instruments they offer are very similar (Ayuso, 2013). <lb/>Concentrating all financing support in ICO may contribute to achieving economies of scale and <lb/>exploitation of all possible synergies, in addition to offering firms a clearer access point to support. <lb/>The financing of Spanish firms, in particular SMEs, is also seriously impaired by very late payments <lb/>-or even failure to pay – in commercial transactions. To combat that, a new law (Ley de Morosidad) has <lb/>established maximum terms of payment in commercial relations. These legal terms are compulsory and <lb/>binding and therefore cannot be lengthened by mutual agreement of the parties. The maximum term is <lb/>30 days for administrative entities (from delivery of the document that accredits the total or partial <lb/>fulfilment of the contract) and 60 days for private companies (from the date of receipt of the goods or <lb/>rendering of services), in line with European Union directives. While payment terms have decreased, they <lb/>remain above the maximums established by the law. The authorities should introduce sanctions for those <lb/>firms systematically incurring late payments above the legal limits. <lb/>ECO/WKP(2014)69 <lb/></body>

			<body>Recommendations to move towards a more dynamic business sector <lb/>Boosting start-ups <lb/> Revamp the licence and permits system and reduce regulatory fragmentation by implementing the market <lb/>unity law. <lb/> Sep-up one-stop shops for issuing and accepting all notifications and licenses that are required to open up a <lb/>business. <lb/>Facilitating business growth <lb/> Broaden the corporate tax base, lower the rate and eliminate regimes for small and medium-sized <lb/>enterprises (SMEs). <lb/> Review other size-dependant policies and regulations. Adapt them to avoid them becoming obstacles to <lb/>firms&apos; growth. <lb/>Fostering internationalisation <lb/> Integrate internationalisation and innovation policies under a single responsibility. <lb/> Establish formal mechanisms of collaboration between Spanish multinationals and SMEs attempting to gain <lb/>access to new markets. <lb/> Strengthen the port regulator and ensure that entry barriers are eliminated. Open access to stevedore <lb/>activities. <lb/>Strengthening competition <lb/> Make access to professions easier. Reduce the number of professions for which being a member of the <lb/>professional body is required. Ensure that membership fees do not act as barriers to entry to the profession. <lb/> Progressively reduce the degree of vertical integration in the electricity market. <lb/> Widen the scope of actions of electricity and gas regulators. <lb/> Favour entry in the oil distribution market to increase contestability and reduce anti-competitive practices. <lb/>Improving judicial efficiency <lb/> Pursue efforts to increase efficiency in the judicial system by ensuring a broader deployment of information <lb/>technology tools, fostering mediation alternatives and increasing competition in the legal profession. <lb/> Replace special administrative appeals with the public administration with time-limited mediation <lb/>procedures. <lb/>Tackling over-indebtedness <lb/> Increase incentives for the use of out-of-court and in-court insolvency procedures by SMEs by allowing <lb/>more flexible payment plans, higher debt haircuts and participation from tax authorities. <lb/> Introduce a new out-of-court negotiated personal insolvency regime. <lb/> Establish clear guidelines for the participation of tax authorities in debt restructuring processes. <lb/>Improving firms financing <lb/> Continue to promote diversified financing sources for firms. In the short-term, adjust the Official Credit <lb/>Institute (ICO) intermediation facilities to demand and make further use of mutual guarantee companies. <lb/></body>
