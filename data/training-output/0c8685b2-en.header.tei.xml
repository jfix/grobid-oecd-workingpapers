	<div type="abstract">The G20/OECD Task Force on Financial Consumer Protection has highlighted that<lb/> &quot;regulators and supervisors can use the insights gained through behavioural economics<lb/> research to inform their approach to potential remedies to help consumers&quot;.<lb/> This paper, prepared under the aegis of the G20/OECD Task Force, first provides some<lb/> historical context for the development of the field of behavioural economics and its<lb/> increased application to policy. It then looks more specifically at the application of<lb/> behavioural economics in the area of financial consumer protection. Common biases that<lb/> individuals demonstrate in the context of making financial decisions are identified, and an<lb/> overview of how numerous governments are testing and implementing the application of<lb/> behavioural economics for policies promoting financial consumer protection is provided.<lb/> The paper concludes by highlighting the opportunity for behavioural economics to help<lb/> provide cost-efficient ways of making policy more effective at promoting positive outcomes<lb/> for consumers, and stressing the need to continue an open dialogue with policy makers,<lb/> regulators and supervisors to exchange experiences and good practices.<lb/></div>
