            <figDesc>Indian companies are increasingly investing in China<lb/> After much contemplation and evaluation, the Indian BPS and ITS sectors have decided to approach China as a<lb/> business opportunity rather than a competitive threat. Leading Indian companies Satyam Computer Systems, TCS<lb/> and Infosys Technologies all established branch offices in China in 2002-03. These companies employed some<lb/> 400-600 Chinese professionals in their development centres in China during the fall of 2006. However, towards the<lb/> end of the decade, the companies expect to have increased their Chinese headcount tenfold. Much of the workforce<lb/> will be used to serve clients in neighbouring Japan and Korea.</figDesc>

            <figDesc>Market characteristics<lb/> 54.<lb/> According to the IDC (2006b), total revenue in the Czech ITS sector was US$ 1.15 billion in<lb/> 2005 and the market has grown by roughly ten percent per year. Growth in external services expenditure is<lb/> triggered by low but increasing domestic outsourcing, public procurement and new establishments of shared services centres by foreign multinationals. The domestic market is increasingly attractive for both<lb/> domestic and foreign suppliers. In 2005, hardware and software support and installation services made up<lb/> 28 percent of the market, systems integration 22 percent, customisation 23 percent and outsourcing 15<lb/> percent. The finance sector (26 percent of the market), combined manufacturing sector (16 percent) and<lb/> government sector (14 percent) were the major client sectors.<lb/> 55.<lb/> The ten largest ITS companies captured 38 percent of the market and seven of those – including<lb/> the top six – are subsidiaries of foreign multinationals (see Annex K). A few big foreign companies<lb/> dominate the government procurement market. Domestically-owned companies are strong in certain niche<lb/> markets for the supply of IT services: e.g. Unicorn is market leader in custom application development;<lb/> and AutoCont CZ and ČEZData are market leaders in network and desktop outsourcing. However, revenue<lb/> is to a large extent generated by domestic clients rather than through exports.<lb/> 56.<lb/> So far, the home-grown Czech BPS and ITS sectors have neither amassed critical size nor<lb/> developed significant presence in client countries. McKinsey (2006) argues that this fact is due to<lb/> increasing business opportunities at home, regulations and inconsistencies in labour laws that complicate<lb/> foreign expansion, and a relatively slow embrace of international sourcing by Central and Eastern<lb/> European companies. The international supply of BPS and ITS that stems from the Czech Republic is<lb/> mainly generated by a limited number of foreign multinationals, predominantly in the IT field, that provide<lb/> services to their European clients from shared services centres. The Czech Republic is not a traditional<lb/> offshoring destination where internationally insourced and outsourced services are delivered to clients in<lb/> far away countries but rather a nearshoring destination where internationally insourced services are<lb/> delivered to other European countries.<lb/> 57.<lb/> McKinsey (2006) estimates that the global market for offshore IT and business process services<lb/> is worth around US$ 30 billion and Eastern Europe supplies less than one percent of this value. In 2004,<lb/> the Czech Republic exported approximately US$ 60 million of ITS, up from US$ 26 million 22 in 2003 and<lb/> US$ 40 million of BPS, up from US$ 15 million in 2003 (</figDesc>

            <figDesc>58.<lb/> According to survey results from 2005, covering 52 out of a total of 150 companies that provide<lb/> outsourced ITS in the Czech Republic, most companies reside in Prague with second tier cities like<lb/> Ostrava, Plzen and Brno gaining in significance due to local access to graduates from technical universities<lb/> and lower labour costs (70-80 percent of Prague salaries) (IT Outsourcing Center, 2005). Major export<lb/> markets for the surveyed companies were neighbouring Germany, Austria and Slovakia. UK, Germany and<lb/> Austria were the largest markets for BPS. Other client locations included Canada, USA and the Nordic<lb/> countries.</figDesc>

However, the maximum ceilings are likely to be reduced from 20-50 percent to 10-40<lb/> percent depending on the region receiving the investment. Between June 2001 and 16 November 2006, 90<lb/> companies had been approved by CzechInvest to receive financial support. In return, these companies have<lb/> pledged to invest €492 million and create 14,872 jobs. A majority of the jobs are for university graduates.<lb/> Figure 2-3 show the country of origin of the companies that established services centres in the Czech<lb/> Republic and the jobs created by the various investments. Next to the ten percent of jobs created by Czech<lb/> companies, the most labour-intensive investments were undertaken by EU-based companies (57 percent),<lb/> U.S. companies (22 percent) and Indian companies (7 percent). 66.<lb/> The industry association the Czech ICT Alliance was founded under the auspices of CzechTrade<lb/> in December 2005. Its role is to help enhance the international profile of the Czech ICT industry.<lb/> Improving the visibility of the Czech BPS and ITS sectors is needed in an increasingly competitive<lb/> international business environment and the Czech Republic has yet to differentiate itself from neighbouring<lb/> countries.

            <figDesc>New policies to attract foreign labour may be necessary to help smooth expected labour shortages.<lb/> 74.<lb/> In 2006, the Czech BPS and ITS companies could still recruit manpower without too much of a<lb/> problem – at least outside Prague. Most foreign establishments are located in Prague and tend to pay a<lb/> significant wage premium compared to domestically-owned companies. Staff attrition is less of a problem<lb/> in the Czech Republic than in the Asian countries studied in this report, in particular India. It does happen,<lb/> however, that multinationals enter the Czech market and pledge to recruit hundreds of workers within a<lb/> short period of time and this tends to create short-term fluctuations with regard to staff attrition and put<lb/> upward pressure on salaries.</figDesc>

It faces strong competition from other emerging markets such as the Philippines for services in<lb/> English. Indian companies are increasingly investing in emerging markets with complementary language<lb/> capabilities, including in China to serve East Asian markets, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Hungary to<lb/> serve EU countries, and in the Philippines to serve American clients. In addition, some of the leading<lb/> Indian companies are increasingly investing in supply capacity in other OECD markets.<lb/> 80.<lb/> India&apos;s strength lies in its large English proficient talent pool and its large sophisticated BPS and<lb/> ITS companies. The BPS and ITS sectors are labour-intensive rather than capital-intensive and a highly<lb/> skilled workforce with language and communication capabilities is paramount in serving foreign markets.<lb/> Compared to other emerging markets that export BPS and ITS, India stands out with its more mature and<lb/> experienced home-grown industry and the combination of size and quality of the relevant workforce.<lb/> Inexpensive labour helps attract foreign business but Indian labour costs are not discernibly different from<lb/> some other leading emerging markets such as China (see Annexes D and H).</figDesc>

In<lb/> total, 84.3 percent of Indian BPS and ITS exports were captured by English-speaking countries in the year<lb/> ending March 2005. 32 This figure would most likely be higher if American and British companies<lb/> operating from other non-Anglophone countries were included.</figDesc>

            <figDesc>Indian IT companies have developed sophisticated mechanisms to minimise potential<lb/> disturbances to their operations: large companies have dedicated departments which handle travel logistics<lb/> and applications for business visas and work permits. Each project leader may be in charge of the visa<lb/> planning for the professionals in his/her project. Most companies also employ professional consulting<lb/> companies to help with translation, legalisation and temporary migration issues. Long-term client relations<lb/> facilitate this planning process and increase predictability. 104.<lb/> There are three principal ways which Indian companies can reduce their dependence on work<lb/> permits in the future. One way is to establish development centres in client countries (see OECD (2006b)</figDesc>

These include dedicated offshore centres where e.g.:<lb/> • only project staff is allowed;<lb/> • the client&apos;s infrastructure and IT system are replicated;<lb/> • all types of data transfers are encrypted;<lb/> • project staff are prohibited from carrying any devices that can store information;<lb/> • project staff are prohibited from interacting with project staff working for competing clients;</figDesc>

            <figDesc>SPi has established a 1,000 strong workforce in Coimbatore, Pondicherry, Kolkata, New Delhi and Chennai in<lb/> India and plans to continue to expand its Indian presence: e.g. it recently acquired Indian KGISTL&apos;s medical<lb/> transcription unit serving the U.S. healthcare industry. The company also has services centres in Vietnam and<lb/> China and in April 2005, the company announced plans to invest US$ 50 million to extend its services capabilities<lb/> in the Philippines and the United States. Geographic differentiation is a significant advantage since work can be<lb/> located to where it makes most financial sense. For example in the past SPi had a 1,500 strong workforce in the<lb/> Philippines doing basic data entry work. Today virtually all those functions have migrated to places like Vietnam<lb/> and China.<lb/> Most Philippine BPS companies are sub-contractors to U.S.-based companies and lack sales and marketing<lb/> organisations in client countries. SPi has established its own sales and marketing channels in the United States and<lb/> it has been particularly successful at building in-house capabilities which has made the company less sensitive to<lb/> external price pressure. Compared to many other Philippine third party BPS providers, SPi has gotten the business<lb/> model right and developed a mature, quality conscious organisation with high visibility abroad.<lb/> Source: Huang (2005) and www.spitech.com.</figDesc>
