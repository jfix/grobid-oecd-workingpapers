	<div type="abstract">Abstract:<lb/> Policy complementarities have often been overlooked in transition economies, leading to the<lb/> exclusion or partial adoption of reforms. This paper examines the key determinants of successful<lb/> transition strategies, and concludes that an approach exploiting complementary relationships and<lb/> interactions between policies is most likely to result in a welfare improvement. Based on nine policy<lb/> areas from the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) Transition Indicators<lb/> database, composite indicators measuring reform implementation and complementarity are<lb/> constructed. Panel data estimates for 30 countries over the period 1989 to 2012 demonstrate a positive<lb/> association between improvements in reform complementarity and economic growth. Moreover, the<lb/> effects are found to persist over time for up to two years after the initial policy change, and are robust<lb/> to the inclusion of a wide range of control variables. Applying these findings to the case of Kazakhstan<lb/> illustrates that comprehensive reforms to a targeted group of complementary policies generate<lb/> sustained increases in output growth, whereas a partial reform strategy results in a loss of welfare.<lb/> JEL classification codes: P2; O40; C33.<lb/></div>
