			<body>MAIN POINTS <lb/>One of the major challenges for all stakeholders in thinking about the future of the Internet is its <lb/>ability to scale to connect billions of people and devices. The objective of this report is to raise awareness <lb/>among policy makers of capacity and limitations of the Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4), to provide <lb/>information on the status of readiness and deployment of the Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) and to <lb/>demonstrate the need for all stakeholders, including governments, to play a part in IPv6 deployment. <lb/>The Internet has rapidly grown to become a fundamental infrastructure for economic and social <lb/>activity around the world. The Internet Protocol (IP) specifies how communications take place between <lb/>one device and another through an addressing system. The Internet technical community has successfully <lb/>supported the Internet&apos;s growth by managing IPv4 Internet addresses through open and transparent policy <lb/>frameworks, for all networks to have address space sufficient to meet their needs. It has also developed a <lb/>new version of the Internet Protocol between 1993 and 1998, IPv6, to accommodate additional growth. <lb/>There is now an expectation among some experts that the currently used version of the Internet <lb/>Protocol, IPv4, will run out of previously unallocated address space in 2010 or 2011, as only 16% of the <lb/>total IPv4 address space remains unallocated in early 2008. The situation is critical for the future of the <lb/>Internet economy because all new users connecting to the Internet, and all businesses that require IP <lb/>addresses for their growth, will be affected by the change from the current status of ready availability of <lb/>unallocated IPv4 addresses. <lb/>IPv6, on the other hand, vastly expands the available address space and can help to support the <lb/>proliferation of broadband, of Internet-connected mobile phones and sensor networks, as well as the <lb/>development of new types of services. Beyond additional address space, IPv6 adoption is being driven by <lb/>public sector procurement mandates, by deployment of innovative products and services, by its better <lb/>support for a mobile Internet, as well as by the decreased network complexity that it allows. <lb/>Today, the latest versions of new popular end systems (e.g. Microsoft Windows Vista/Server 2008, <lb/>Apple Mac OS X, Linux, etc.) fully integrate IPv6, as do parts of the core of the Internet. However, <lb/>progress in actual usage of IPv6 remains very slow to-date and considerable challenges must be overcome <lb/>to achieve a successful transition. Immediate costs are associated with deployment of IPv6, whereas many <lb/>benefits are longterm and depend on a critical mass of actors adopting it. A further major obstacle to IPv6 <lb/>deployment is that it is not backwards compatible with IPv4: IPv6-only devices cannot communicate <lb/>directly with IPv4-only devices. Instead, both protocols must be deployed, or sophisticated ―tunnelling‖ <lb/>and translation systems set-up. Experience to-date with IPv6 also suggests that IPv6 deployment requires <lb/>planning and co-ordination over several years, that increased awareness of the issues is needed and that, as <lb/>with all new technologies, finding skilled resources is challenging. <lb/>An intersection of economic, technical and public policy factors will determine the strategies adopted <lb/>by various stakeholders who can pursue three broad paths: i) an even denser deployment of IPv4 Network <lb/>Address Translation (NAT), whereby more devices are connected with fewer public IPv4 addresses by <lb/>using private networks; ii) trying to obtain previously allocated but unused IPv4 addresses, and; iii) the <lb/>deployment of IPv6. It is likely that all three of these options will be pursued by various actors in parallel, <lb/>according to their business requirements. As an immediate solution, many are expected to pursue denser <lb/>deployments of NAT. If Internet addressing groups were to liberalise address transfers, some actors would <lb/>acquire previously allocated IPv4 addresses. Some actors will also implement IPv6. For policy makers, the <lb/>most important point is that the first two strategies, which extend the life of IPv4, may be useful but are <lb/>shortterm. The only sustainable solution to deliver expected economic and social opportunities for the <lb/>future of the Internet economy is the deployment of IPv6. <lb/>DSTI/ICCP(2007)20/FINAL <lb/></body>

			<body>In terms of public policy, IPv6 plays an important role in innovation and scalability of the Internet. In <lb/>addition, security, interoperability and competition issues are involved with the depletion of IPv4. <lb/>Transitioning to IPv6 represents a fundamental change in the Internet Protocol layer, which is necessary to <lb/>foster an environment for long-term growth and competition across existing players and new entrants. In <lb/>turn, such an environment is expected to enable the expanded use of the Internet and the development of <lb/>new networking environments and services. <lb/>As the pool of unallocated IPv4 addresses dwindles and transition to IPv6 gathers momentum, all <lb/>stakeholders should anticipate the impacts of the transition period and plan accordingly. With regard to the <lb/>depletion of unallocated IPv4 address space, the most important message may be that there is no complete <lb/>solution and that no option will meet all expectations. While the Internet technical community discusses <lb/>optimal mechanisms to manage IPv4 address space exhaustion and IPv6 deployment and to manage <lb/>routing table growth pre-and post-exhaustion, governments should encourage all stakeholders to support a <lb/>smooth transition to IPv6. 1 <lb/>To create a policy environment conducive to the timely deployment of IPv6, governments should <lb/>consider: <lb/>1) Working with the private sector and other stakeholders to increase education and awareness and <lb/>reduce bottlenecks <lb/>IPv6 adoption is a multi-year, complex integration process that impacts all sectors of the economy. In <lb/>addition, a long period of co-existence between IPv4 and IPv6 is projected during which maintaining <lb/>operations and interoperability at the application level will be critical. The fact that each player is capable <lb/>of addressing only part of the issue associated with the Internet-wide transition to IPv6 underscores the <lb/>need for awareness raising and co-operation. Governments should aim to raise awareness and: <lb/> Establish co-operation mechanisms for the development and implementation of high-level policy <lb/>objectives to guide the transition to IPv6. <lb/> Develop compelling and informative educational material to communicate and disseminate <lb/>information on IPv6. <lb/> Target decision-makers in awareness efforts and discussions on IPv6 deployment. <lb/> Support registries and industry groups as they continue to develop policies and technologies to <lb/>facilitate the management of IPv4 and adoption of IPv6, with a focus on: <lb/> Policies that safeguard security and stability. <lb/> Policies that give stakeholders ample opportunity to be ready and operate smoothly during <lb/>the upcoming period of IPv4 unallocated address space depletion. <lb/> Ensuring that the deployment of IPv6 and the necessary co-existence of IPv4 and IPv6 <lb/>safeguard competition, a level-playing field and are careful not to lock-in dominant positions. <lb/> Make specific efforts to ease bottlenecks, by encouraging: <lb/> Operators to consider IPv6 connectivity in peering and transit agreements. <lb/> Greenfield deployments to contemplate IPv6 from the outset, to ―future-proof‖ deployments. <lb/> Vendors and other providers of customer premises equipment to plan for and accommodate <lb/>future customer needs in terms of IPv6, in recognition of consumer Internet access as the <lb/></body>

			<body>largest current network-service growth area and the area placing the heaviest demand on IP <lb/>address resources. <lb/> Telecommunications operators to facilitate IPv6 deployment through training, equipment <lb/>renewal, integrating IPv6 in hardware and software, developing new applications, conducting <lb/>risk assessments. <lb/> Software development companies to develop IP version neutral applications where possible, <lb/>incorporate IPv6 capabilities into new software, and to conduct research and development on <lb/>new applications that leverage IPv6 functionality. <lb/>2) Demonstrating government commitment to adoption of IPv6 <lb/>As for all other stakeholders, governments need continued addresses to support growth in the public <lb/>services that they provide online and more generally to meet public policy objectives associated with the <lb/>continued growth of the Internet economy. They therefore have a strategic need to support transition to <lb/>IPv6 by taking steps to: <lb/> Adopt clear policy objectives that are endorsed at a high level, to guide the transition effort to IPv6. <lb/> Plan for the adoption of IPv6 for governments&apos; internal use and for public services, by developing a <lb/>road map and planning time needed to conduct network assessment, infrastructure upgrade, and <lb/>upgrade of applications, hosts, and servers. <lb/> Set up a steering group to provide strategic guidance on achieving IPv6 implementation objectives. <lb/> Ensure that all new programmes involving the Internet and ICT consider the relevancy of IPv6 and <lb/>assess public programmes and priorities to determine how they can benefit from IPv6. <lb/> Ensure that all relevant government security entities fully integrate the new dimension that IPv6 <lb/>brings to security. <lb/> Take pro-active initiatives to include IPv6 training efforts in life-long education cycles. <lb/>3) Pursuing international co-operation and monitoring IPv6 deployment <lb/>Awareness of the scope and scale of an issue is a key element in support of informed policy making. <lb/>Benchmarking at the international level is essential to monitor the impact of various policies. With respect <lb/>to IPv6, governments should: <lb/> Engage in bilateral and multilateral co-operation at regional and global levels, to share knowledge <lb/>and experience on developing policies, practices and models for coordination with private actors on <lb/>IPv6 deployment. <lb/> Consider the specific difficulties of some developing countries and assist them with capacity-<lb/>building efforts to help build IPv6 infrastructure. <lb/> Encourage the participation of all relevant stakeholders in the development of equitable public <lb/>policies for IPv6 allocation. <lb/> Encourage all relevant parties, including global and regional Internet registries, Internet exchange <lb/>point operators and research organisations, to gather data to track the deployment of IPv6 in <lb/>support of informed policy-making. <lb/> Monitor IPv6 readiness, including by monitoring information on national peering points offering <lb/>IPv6 connectivity, Internet Service Providers offering commercial IPv6 services, volumes of IPv6 <lb/>transit, and penetration of IPv6-enabled devices in domestic markets. <lb/></body>

			<body>INTRODUCTION <lb/>The Internet has been remarkably successful in scaling from a small community of users to a global <lb/>network of networks serving more than a billion users. Over a short period it has also become a <lb/>fundamental infrastructure for economies and societies around the world. Along the way, what was being <lb/>interconnected expanded from one mainframe per university or company, to a one computer per person <lb/>paradigm, to a multi-device environment, including greater use and all forms of access. In the future, vast <lb/>numbers of objects may be connected to the Internet. <lb/>Growth in the use of the Internet has meant greater demand for Internet addresses. IP addresses <lb/>combine ―who‖, ―where‖ and ―how‖ roles in the Internet&apos;s architecture. Internet addresses uniquely <lb/>identify devices on the network – or ―endpoints‖ – enabling the identification of the parties to a <lb/>communication transaction (―who‖ role). 2 In addition, addresses are used by the network to transfer data: <lb/>they determine the network location of the identified endpoint (―where‖ role). 3 Addresses are also used to <lb/>support routing decisions (―how‖ role). Therefore, IP addresses enable connection to the Internet, both <lb/>through identification of the endpoints to a conversation and enabling the carriage of the data of the <lb/>conversation through the network. 4 <lb/>Internet addressing is primarily a technical issue, but one that is influenced by economic and social <lb/>factors. Increased IP infrastructure deployment, greater demand for Internet services throughout economies <lb/>and societies translates into greater demand for IP addresses. Their continued and timely availability is, <lb/>therefore, critical for the Internet to be able to meet the economic and social objectives all stakeholders <lb/>have for this infrastructure, including in enabling public services continuity and evolution, for example, <lb/>and safe guarding the continued growth of the Internet. <lb/>The Internet is currently reliant on IPv4 (Internet Protocol version 4) addresses. This is, however, a <lb/>25-year-old standard that is limited in its ability to meet future demand. The pool of unallocated IPv4 <lb/>addresses available for new uses is rapidly being depleted. If current trends continue, projections expect the <lb/>free pool of unallocated IPv4 address space will run out between 2010 and 2011. 5 <lb/>Foreseeing eventual depletion of IPv4 address space, as the Internet became increasingly successful, <lb/>the Internet technical community took action to manage IPv4 addresses as a finite resource and plan for the <lb/>future. In the 1990s, policies were introduced to tie new assignments of IP addresses to demonstrated need. <lb/>A new scheme for addressing and routing, Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) was also introduced to <lb/>solve the routing problem and enabled network operators to make more efficient use of address space. <lb/>Moreover, a new technology called Network Address Translation (NAT) was introduced as a short-term <lb/>―quick fix‖ solution, enabling one public address to be shared among several machines. The NAT, with its <lb/>IPv4 address, provides a form of gateway to the global Internet. <lb/>Between 1993 and 1998, a new version of the Internet Protocol (IPv6) was developed to provide a <lb/>vastly expanded address space for future use and transition mechanisms were planned. A decade later, <lb/>abundance of IP addresses is still considered to be critical to enable business models of the future, such as <lb/>widespread mobile Internet, machine-to-machine applications and other types of models based on ubiquity <lb/>of the Internet. <lb/></body>

			<body>However, for technical reasons, IPv6 is not directly backwards compatible with IPv4 and <lb/>consequently, the technical transition from IPv4 to IPv6 is complex. If a device can implement both IPv4 <lb/>and IPv6 network layer stacks, the ―dual-stack‖ transition mechanism enables the co-existence of IPv4 and <lb/>IPv6. For isolated IPv6 devices to communicate with one another, IPv6 over IPv4 ―tunnelling‖ <lb/>mechanisms can be set-up. Finally, for IPv6-only devices to communicate with IPv4-only devices, an <lb/>intermediate device must ―translate‖ between IPv4 and IPv6. All three mechanisms – dual-stack, <lb/>―tunnelling‖ and ―translation‖ – require access to some quantity of IPv4 addresses. <lb/>The Internet&apos;s adoption of a new addressing scheme represents a significant challenge for all <lb/>stakeholders. At the time of the adoption of IPv4 there were less than 500 hosts connected to the Internet, a <lb/>relatively small community of technical specialists was involved and the Internet was operating in a non-<lb/>commercial environment. By 2008, over 500 million hosts were connected to the Internet and 1.32 billion <lb/>users had Internet access. 6 The network of networks had become a fundamental infrastructure, around the <lb/>world, for day-to-day economic and social activities. <lb/>Today, there is widespread agreement that the deployment of IPv6 is the best course forward, but also <lb/>recognition that IPv4 will continue to be used for a long time to come. Between May and October 2007, all <lb/>five regional Internet registries (RIRs), the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers <lb/>(ICANN), as well as national Internet registries (NIRs) made public statements emphasising the need for <lb/>all those who need IP addresses to deploy IPv6 (Annex 9). Their statements recognise the critical <lb/>importance of IPv6 to the future success of the Internet, urge companies to deploy it, and commit to <lb/>actively promoting the adoption of IPv6 in their respective regions. Another important message of all these <lb/>resolutions is renewed confidence in the Internet community and in the bottom-up, inclusive, stakeholder-<lb/>driven processes in place to provide any needed policy changes. <lb/>For the successful implementation of IPv6, a transition is required which builds positive network <lb/>effects or saves costs for Internet users. In other words, the use of IPv6 will increase in attractiveness for <lb/>all users, as greater numbers of people use this protocol or as costs of continued deployment of IPv4 <lb/>increase. The take-up in the use of IPv6 has been very slow to-date because of a lack of applications <lb/>support, a lack of awareness, as well as a lack of clear benefits. Until there is market demand for the <lb/>additional space and new functionality provided by IPv6, this will continue to be the case. In addition, <lb/>unlike when IPv4 was initially adopted, the Internet now operates in a commercial environment, whereby a <lb/>solid business case must be made to justify investment. Service providers have been understandably <lb/>cautious about committing the required investment ahead of visible demand from their customers. <lb/>The nature of technology transitions is such that, prior to general adoption, there may be little or no <lb/>initial incentive to shift to using a new technology. Once there is a critical mass of users, transitions often <lb/>exhibit a ―tipping point‖ at which adoption gains pace until it is widespread. In theory, a ―tipping point‖ <lb/>should occur when the marginal cost, for an Internet service provider, of implementing the next device on <lb/>IPv4 becomes higher than the marginal cost of implementing the next device on IPv6. In other words, once <lb/>the cost of deploying IPv4 infrastructure – determined by the cost of obtaining the addresses themselves <lb/>and the cost of designing and operating networks that use fewer public addresses, by using NATs – <lb/>become higher than deploying IPv6, a dynamic for IPv6 implementation should propel the industry <lb/>through a dual-stack transitional phase to IPv6. The challenge lies in reaching this tipping point, which <lb/>depends on a range of factors: customer demand, opportunity costs, emerging markets, the introduction of <lb/>new services, incentives, regulation, as well as other factors. <lb/>The upcoming depletion of IPv4 unallocated addresses and the complexity of the transition to IPv6 <lb/>has led to growing discussion in the Internet technical community about how best to manage the ongoing <lb/>need for IPv4 addresses. Each of the initiatives undertaken to ensure that adequate address space is <lb/>available is well founded, and raises a number of complex technical and economic issues, including some <lb/></body>

			<page>9 <lb/></page>

			<body>with public policy significance for the future of the Internet economy. The goal is to ensure the adoption <lb/>and deployment of technically-sound solutions while maintaining the potential for new participants to <lb/>access the full benefits of the global Internet. <lb/>Maintaining accurate records of address assignments is, for example, critical, for operational and <lb/>security reasons. Additionally, from an economic growth perspective, IPv6 expertise is likely to be <lb/>necessary to provide economies and companies with competitive advantage in the areas of technology <lb/>products and services, and to benefit from ICT-enabled innovation. <lb/>Trying to achieve as much interoperability as possible between IPv4 and IPv6, for everyone to be able <lb/>to continue to reach everyone else, is another priority. In the medium term, since operating dual IPv4 and <lb/>IPv6 protocol stacks is required in most cases to underpin the Internet&apos;s evolution to IPv6, access to IPv4 <lb/>addresses remains key for the development of new services for some time to come. A situation with <lb/>anticipated scarcity of IPv4 addresses could raise competition concerns in terms of barriers to new entry <lb/>and strengthening incumbent positions. Consequently, there is considerable discussion about how to <lb/>manage previously allocated IPv4 space once the free pool of IPv4 addresses has been exhausted, <lb/>including the ramifications of reclaim efforts and of authorised or unauthorised transfers of addresses <lb/>between assignees. <lb/>A key challenge lies in ensuring that policies and practices that have been developed in the past to <lb/>meet specific principles and goals such as stability, security, transparency, equity, and efficiency, are <lb/>maintained or adapted to the new environment. As with any finite resource, the existence of scarcity has <lb/>meant that economic issues are increasingly part of the discussion. The discussions underway are an <lb/>endeavour to adapt existing policies and practices to a situation where, in the short to medium term, <lb/>demand for IPv4 address space seems likely to exceed supply. A mechanism for transferring IPv4 <lb/>addresses from one party to another already exists, for very specific circumstances (e.g. the sale of a <lb/>company or a merger). For example, a modified transfer mechanism, sanctioned by the Internet community <lb/>and adhering to its bottom-up consensus-driven policies and practices, could help to manage on-going <lb/>demand. However, in allowing for more flexible transfers of IP address resources, safeguards to ensure <lb/>adherence to long-held principles and objectives would need to be preserved or adapted to the new <lb/>environment. <lb/>Technical issues are also very much to the fore in these discussions. For example, Network Address <lb/>Translators (NATs), to share public IPv4 addresses between several devices, are in widespread use and are <lb/>very popular with network operators. At the same time NATs are deemed to have limitations in the long <lb/>term. Experts deem that NATs increase the complexity of Internet applications, therefore costs of <lb/>operation, and impede some directions in innovation and the use of upper-level protocols and applications <lb/>that depend upon the end-to-end functionality in the Internet. As the unallocated pool of IPv4 addresses <lb/>runs out, NATs are predicted to become increasingly deployed. If this is done without simultaneously <lb/>transitioning to IPv6, so as to build positive network effects, it could narrow future technical options as <lb/>well as have economic and public policy implications. For example, application developers may have to <lb/>build increasingly complex and costly central gateways to allow ―NATed‖ clients to communicate with <lb/>each other. This is deemed to present barriers to innovation, the development of new services and the <lb/>overall performance of the Internet. <lb/>It is increasingly important that all stakeholders co-operate and make concerted efforts, based on their <lb/>appropriate role and expertise, to enable the timely and smooth transition to IPv6, in most cases through a <lb/>dual-stack period. All stakeholders have a role to play in the deployment of IPv6. The Internet&apos;s technical <lb/>community has laid the foundation by developing the technical standards for IPv6. The technology is <lb/>sufficiently mature to be introduced into production networks, although, to-date, this introduction has been <lb/>on a small scale. <lb/></body>

			<body> The Internet technical community continues to play a critical role in evolving the IPv6 protocols <lb/>and operations to meet ―real-life requirements‖in building awareness of the need for the transition <lb/>and in helping to develop the skills base necessary for widespread deployment. <lb/> The role of the broader Internet community&apos;s bottom-up, consensus-based process for developing <lb/>policies and practices needs to be underscored. <lb/> The private sector, through its development of infrastructure and services, has led the development <lb/>of Internet infrastructure and services from a small community of users, to a global network of <lb/>networks. The implementation of IPv6 will entail continued private sector leadership. <lb/> As large users of Internet services, governments can help to stimulate IPv6 products and services <lb/>through their own procurement policies and use and through public-private partnerships in IPv6-<lb/>related research and development. In terms of public policy, governments can also play a role in <lb/>building the awareness of the necessity for a transition to begin in earnest. <lb/>A priority is to increase awareness of IPv6 and of its role for the future of the Internet. This can be <lb/>done through public statements of support for IPv6 deployment to relevant constituencies, explaining the <lb/>advantages of equipment and services that are IPv6 compliant, and highlighting the positive and negative <lb/>experiences of businesses, governments and others that have implemented IPv6. A parallel priority is to <lb/>increase IPv6 training and expertise, including in the area of security, since IPv6 networks introduce new <lb/>opportunities and requirements compared to IPv4 networks. In addition, IPv6 deployment should be <lb/>measured and progress in the roll-out monitored, by the parties best able to carry out that task. <lb/>All stakeholders should draw lessons from successes and barriers that have been identified in IPv6 <lb/>implementations to-date. In general, these experiences highlight the importance of planning ahead. <lb/>Planning ahead can drastically minimise costs by using natural technical refresh cycles. Experience also <lb/>shows the need to adapt an organisation&apos;s transition plan on a case-by-case basis and the need to ensure <lb/>high-level decision-maker buy-in. Equipment vendors, in particular of customer premise equipment, <lb/>should ensure their products are IPv6-enabled. <lb/>It is important to note that the premise of this report is that a widespread transition to IPv6 is the most <lb/>likely and most desirable outcome for the future of the Internet. Experience shows, however, that the <lb/>Internet will continue to change and evolve in ways that cannot be easily predicted. There are considerable <lb/>challenges for the Internet community to make the transition to IPv6. In creating a dual-stack environment, <lb/>IPv4 will likely be in widespread use for the next decade or more, irrespective of parallel IPv6 deployment. <lb/>To make this work, NATs will have to be more extensively deployed. In turn, more NATs are likely to <lb/>trigger the further development of applications and services for that environment (e.g. more services that <lb/>use the client-server paradigm and workarounds such as in Skype). <lb/>If NAT deployments were to occur to the point where the Internet industry is both comfortable and <lb/>capable of running an (IPv4) network with intense deployment of NATs, then the case for investment to <lb/>support IPv6 deployment in parallel, possibly without additional customer demand, would be much more <lb/>challenging. If momentum were to shift in this direction, with a demise of the &quot;end-to-end argument&quot;, then <lb/>addressing would become increasingly oriented toward mapping topology rather than to mapping identities <lb/>(―who‖ role), with the consequence of less demand for expanded address space enabled by IPv6. In such a <lb/>scenario, there would not be a global addressing scheme anymore, but increasing numbers of different <lb/>types of addresses used in different scopes and domains. While the wide-scale deployment of NATs may <lb/>seem the most cost-effective and near-term solution to defend against IPv4 address scarcity, it should be <lb/>stressed that it is a deferral of the problem, not a sustainable solution. <lb/>The risk, in the absence of wide enough deployment of IPv6, is a partition of the Internet, whereby <lb/>some regions would adopt IPv6 and others would run IPv4 with multiple layers of NAT. Such a division <lb/></body>

			<page>11 <lb/></page>

			<body>would impact the economic opportunities offered by the Internet with severe repercussions in terms of <lb/>stifled creativity and deployment of generally accessible new services. <lb/>Scope of the report <lb/>The report reviews economic considerations associated with the transition from IPv4 to IPv6.

			<body>I. AN OVERVIEW OF INTERNET ADDRESSING <lb/>The Internet Protocol (IP) enables many different types of physical networks, such as cable TV <lb/>systems, telephony systems, or wireless networks, to transport packets of data or ―IP packets‖. To do this, <lb/>IP packets are ―encapsulated‖ into whatever structure the underlying network uses. To connect different <lb/>types of physical networks, routers ―de-encapsulate‖ the incoming IP packets at the edge of a physical <lb/>network and then re-encapsulate them to be able to forward them to the next physical network. <lb/>IP addresses play a fundamental role in the functioning of the Internet. They identify (―who‖ role) <lb/>participating devices on the network of networks that comprises the Internet. All devices – including <lb/>routers, computers, servers, printers, Internet fax machines, or IP phones – must have an IP address. IP <lb/>addresses allow devices to communicate and transfer packets to each other: the Internet Protocol routes <lb/>messages based on the destination IP address (―where‖ role). Network routers also use IP addresses to <lb/>decide the way in which a packet will arrive to its destination (―how‖ role). <lb/>The IPv4 address space is a 32-bit address scheme, which creates an address space of theoretically <lb/>4 billion (2 32 ) possible unique addresses. 7 Since IPv4 addresses are of a fixed length, they are a finite <lb/>resource and have been managed as such by the Internet community for more than a decade. Allocations <lb/>of IPv4 addresses made prior to the formalisation of regional Internet address allocation bodies are known <lb/>as ―legacy assignments‖. This class of allocation accounts for around one-third of all possible IPv4 <lb/>addresses, or 1.6 billion addresses. Some portions of the IPv4 space have been reserved for special <lb/>purposes such as private networks (~16 million addresses), multicast addresses (~270 million addresses) <lb/>and addresses defined for ―Future Use‖ (~270 million addresses). <lb/>IPv6, of which the core set of protocols were developed by the Internet Engineering Task Force from <lb/>1993 to 1998, has sometimes been called the Next Generation Internet Protocol or IPng. IPv6, or Internet <lb/>Protocol version 6, provides a greatly expanded address range of 2 128 possible addresses. 8 Its format, shown <lb/>in Figure 1, allows for 340 billion, billion, billion, billion unique IPv6 addresses in theory. <lb/>Figure 1. Simplified Comparison of IPv4 and IPv6 Address Schemes <lb/>Source: United States Government Accountability Office (GAO). <lb/>The Internet enables communication between one IP address and another. IP addresses of a particular <lb/>version can only intercommunicate directly or ―natively‖ with IP addresses of the same version. That is, <lb/>IPv4 cannot communicate directly with IPv6 and vice versa. <lb/></body>

			<body>Routers examine the destination IP address on incoming data packets and send them on, ever-closer to <lb/>the destination computer. To do this, each router must be regularly supplied with up-to-date routing tables <lb/>that describe all valid destinations. 9 At the global level, individual IP addresses are combined together into <lb/>prefixes. Prefixes represent a hierarchical, aggregated block of addresses for a network, for example /24. 10 <lb/>The administrative entities that obtain, aggregate and announce these prefixes are autonomous systems <lb/>(AS). Autonomous systems are groups of networks that operate under a single external routing policy. For <lb/>example AT&amp;T, Google, NTT and France Telecom each are an AS. Each AS has its own unique AS <lb/>identifier number (for example 8228) and groups the individual prefixes that are allocated to that network. <lb/>Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is the standard routing protocol used to exchange information about <lb/>IP routing between autonomous systems. In general, each autonomous system uses BGP to announce (i.e., <lb/>advertise) the set of prefixes (i.e. aggregated IP addresses) to which it can deliver traffic. For example, the <lb/>network 80.124.192.0/24 (―/24‖ being the prefix) being inside Autonomous System number 8228 <lb/>(AS8228), means that AS8228 will announce to other providers that it can deliver any traffic destined for <lb/>80.124.192.0/24. <lb/>Overview of major initiatives in Internet addressing and routing to-date <lb/>Internet routing and addressing have been revised over the years to support the expansion in the <lb/>global use of Internet, with over one billion Internet users connected in 2007 and increasingly pervasive <lb/>IP‑based devices and infrastructure. <lb/>In 1972 Robert Kahn developed the concept of open-architecture networking, or &quot;Internetting&quot;. His <lb/>concept was that an open architecture would be able to connect multiple independent networks, each <lb/>network itself having a different operating system and design. Such an open-architecture network required <lb/>a new communication protocol which was designed in 1973-74 by Robert Kahn and Vinton Cerf and later <lb/>called TCP/IP (Box 1). <lb/>Box 1. &quot; I Survived the TCP/IP Transition &quot; <lb/>In the early 1980s, the existing protocol (NCP) supported a very limited number of IP addresses. Such a limitation was <lb/>a key motivating factor in the development of IP Version 4. The IPv4 address space is a 32-bit address scheme, <lb/>providing for over 4 billion (2 <lb/>32 <lb/>) possible unique addresses. The technology cutover date of all the hosts and equipment <lb/>on the network was 1 January 1983 and, although less than 500 hosts made up the Internet, several years of planning <lb/>and development were required in order to simultaneously convert all the machines and equipment on the network. <lb/>An excerpt from RFC801 by Jon Postel, detailing the conversion plan, reads &quot; Because all hosts cannot be converted to <lb/>TCP simultaneously, and some will implement only IP/TCP, it will be necessary to provide temporarily for <lb/>communication between NCP-only hosts and TCP-only hosts. To do this certain hosts which implement both NCP and <lb/>IP/TCP will be designated as relay hosts… Initially there will be many NCP-only hosts and a few TCP-only hosts, and <lb/>the load on the relay hosts will be relatively light. As time goes by, and the conversion progresses, there will be more <lb/>TCP capable hosts, and fewer NCP-only hosts, plus new TCP-only hosts. But, presumably most hosts that are now <lb/>NCP-only will implement IP/TCP in addition to their NCP and become &quot; dual protocol &quot; hosts. So, while the load on the <lb/>relay hosts will rise, it will not be a substantial portion of the total traffic. &quot; <lb/>Source: RFC801, ftp://ftp.isi.edu/in-notes/rfc801.txt. <lb/>The original IPv4 addressing structure was a two-level hierarchy, with 8 bits of the address <lb/>identifying a host&apos;s network (network part), and the remaining 24 bits (host part), identifying the specific <lb/>end system on that network, allowing for a total of 256 networks in total only. <lb/>In 1980, the addressing structure evolved from its original 8-bit/24-bit network/host part addressing to <lb/>a ―classful‖ addressing structure. The classful structure, which used the first four bits of the address to <lb/>define the address ―class‖, segmented addresses to provide three sizes of network address and allow more <lb/>networks to be connected. Class ―A‖, which mirrored the original address allocation model with 7-bit <lb/>network/24-bit host, and Class ―B‖, which provided for 14 bits of network and 16 bits of host, address <lb/></body>

			<body>spaces were very large, while class &quot;C&quot; (providing 21 bits of network and only 8 bits of host) was small for <lb/>most networks. Class B address space, albeit too large for most networks, experienced high demand and <lb/>led to the initial concerns about IPv4 address space depletion. <lb/>By the early 1990s, it was apparent that the growth in number of users along with emerging <lb/>applications such as multimedia and broadband services, would put a severe strain on the capabilities of the <lb/>Internet, and that its underlying protocols, in particular IPv4, would require an update. <lb/>The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) took on the task of finding several short-term solutions <lb/>e.g. by introducing the &quot;Classless&quot; address architecture in 1993, also known as Classless Interdomain <lb/>Routing (CIDR), to more efficiently use the remaining IPv4 space. 11 In the classless addressing scheme, a <lb/>block of address space can have many different sizes, depending on a network&apos;s need. As an example, a <lb/>small network in need of 16 addresses could obtain a /28 (pronounced ―slash 28‖). Addresses came to be <lb/>talked about as ―/n‖, with n indicating the number of bits that were ―pre-set‖. For example, in a ―/28‖, the <lb/>first 28 bits of the address range are ―set‖, while all possible variation of the last 4 bits enables the network <lb/>to use 2 4 i.e. 16 addresses. <lb/>A new routing protocol, BGP-4, implemented support for Classless Inter-Domain Routing (or CIDR) <lb/>and introduced route aggregation to decrease the size of the routing table. 12 While CIDR had to be <lb/>implemented in all the routers and hosts on the Internet involved in making routing decisions, the changes <lb/>needed were software-based and were backwards compatible. Therefore, the transition was fairly smooth. <lb/>Network Address Translation (NAT, RFC 2663) was devised in 1994 as another short-term solution <lb/>to the lack of IPv4 address space. NAT functionality can be built into a device such as a router that sits <lb/>between an upstream provider (an ISP and the public Internet) and a local network. NAT, as the name <lb/>implies, translates the address used on the local network into an address used on the public network. <lb/>Connection through a NAT allows a small number of public addresses to be ―shared‖ across a much larger <lb/>number of hosts using private, i.e. not globally unique, addresses, thereby allowing an entire group of <lb/>computers and other connected devices to connect to the Internet via the NAT. As such, most devices <lb/>behind NAT devices become ―clients‖, as opposed to both clients and servers in the ―end-to-end‖ model <lb/>that characterised the early Internet (Box 2). 13 <lb/>Box 2. The &quot; End-To-End Argument &quot; <lb/>The Internet &quot; s original design is based on what is known as the &quot; end-to-end argument &quot; where the intelligence and <lb/>processing power of a network reside at the outer edges while the inner network itself remains as simple as possible. <lb/>The model proposed is a way to maximise the efficiency and minimise the cost of the network. The end-to-end <lb/>argument explaining the relationship between the network and its end points has arguably been one of the key <lb/>elements of the Internet &quot; s success. Its origins lie in a seminal paper in 1981 by Jerome Saltzer, David Reed, and David <lb/>Clark. <lb/>14 <lb/>NATs are pervasive in the Internet ecosystem and are a low direct cost solution to IPv4 address space <lb/>limitations. Benefits of NATs include perceived security (since by default all incoming connections are <lb/>filtered), increased flexibility in changing service providers, and low usage of public IP addresses. 15 <lb/>However, NAT modifies the packet&apos;s header before it reaches its destination and thus requires <lb/>intelligence and processing power within the network rather than only at the end points. Problems often <lb/>associated with NATs include increasing the complexity of networks, creating asymmetry between clients <lb/>and servers, complicating the provision of public services within a local network and interfering with peer-<lb/>to-peer applications. 16 For example, if a computer&apos;s address is behind a NAT, it can be difficult to initiate a <lb/>conversation with that computer because there is no simple way to know which computer to send the <lb/>message to. Some have pointed out a primary reason NATs introduce complexity is the lack of standards to <lb/>specify their ―behaviour‖ in different scenarios. For example, standards to specify how NATs deal with <lb/></body>

			<body>peer-to-peer applications such as voice-over-IP, have not been devised. As a result, NAT implementations <lb/>vary widely. Unable to predict how specific NATs will react, application designers have had to devise <lb/>complex ―work-arounds‖. 17 <lb/>As a long-term solution to the depletion of IPv4 address space, the IETF chartered a new working <lb/>group named Internet Protocol – Next Generation, or IPng. In December 1993, the IETF issued a Request <lb/>for Comments (RFC 1550), entitled ―IP: Next Generation (IPng) White Paper Solicitation‖. Interested <lb/>parties were invited to submit comments on specific requirements for IPng, and on factors that should be <lb/>considered during the IPng selection process. The responses were grouped into a document ―the Technical <lb/>Criteria for Choosing IP, the Next Generation (IPng)‖. 18 Seventeen criteria for the new protocol were <lb/>specified, including scalability, a straightforward transition plan, media independence, easy and largely <lb/>distributed configuration and operation with automatic configuration of hosts and routers, multicast, <lb/>network service and mobility. <lb/>In January 1995, ―The Recommendation for the IP Next Generation Protocol‖ was published. 19 The <lb/>document specified the key features of IPng, including larger addresses, enhanced routing capabilities, <lb/>authentication and encryption to strengthen security, quality of service functions, and more. It also gave the <lb/>IPng protocol a new name, IPv6. 20 The suite of IPv6 protocols were finalised by the IETF in 1998. 21 <lb/>Characteristics of IPv6 include, first and foremost, a widely-expanded address space. As more devices <lb/>(like handheld devices, and integrated IP appliances and utilities) come to use the Internet, they require <lb/>unique addresses to work optimally. Section III. Drivers and challenges of IPv6 deployment, provides <lb/>further information on the characteristics of IPv6 and its adoption by businesses to-date. <lb/>The address distribution and registry function <lb/>Accompanying the evolution of the Internet, institutions were created to manage Internet resources <lb/>and adapt Internet resource policies as needed. To ensure that no two networks would use the same <lb/>network address in the Internet, Jon Postel, at the Information Sciences Institute (ISI) of the University of <lb/>Southern California (USC), managed, until 1998, the allocation of blocks of IP addresses to networks. He <lb/>also managed the allocations of blocks of IP addresses to Regional Internet Registries (RIRs), when these <lb/>were formed to serve geographical regions of continental scope. The first regional Internet registry was <lb/>created in 1989 for Europe and named RIPE NCC (Réseaux IP Européens-Network Coordination Centre). <lb/>The APNIC (Asia Pacific Network Information Centre) was created for the Asia-Pacific region in 1993. <lb/>The ARIN (American Registry for Internet Numbers) was created in 1997 for the United States, Canada <lb/>and a portion of the Caribbean. The LACNIC (Latin America and Caribbean Network Information Centre) <lb/>for Latin America and the Caribbean (2002). In 2005, AfriNIC became the RIR for the African region. <lb/>Allocating IP addresses to RIRs came to be known as one of the Internet Assigned Numbers <lb/>Authority (IANA) functions, which ICANN has performed since 1998. 22 ICANN&apos;s Address Supporting <lb/>Organisation (ASO) is the formal entity through which RIRs agree on global address policies, i.e. policies <lb/>that require the involvement of ICANN, IANA, and all the RIRs for implementation. An Address Council <lb/>was created in 1999 to communicate proposed global policies to ICANN&apos;s Board for ratification. <lb/>The Internet community uses an administrative approach to resource allocation, whereby address <lb/>blocks are allocated based on demonstrated needs for addresses. IANA allocates blocks of IPv4 and IPv6 <lb/>address space, and Autonomous System (AS) numbers to each RIR to meet the needs of their region. 23 The <lb/>criteria, as currently agreed between the IANA and the RIRs, stipulate that IANA allocates /8 IPv4 blocks <lb/>and /12 IPv6 address blocks. RIRs, in turn, allocate IP addresses to Local Internet Registries (LIRs), or to <lb/>national Internet Registries (NIRs) in those countries that have them, based on demonstration of need. 24 <lb/></body>

			<body>LIRs either ―assign‖ address space to end-users or ―allocate‖ address space to ISPs who, in turn, assign IP <lb/>addresses to enterprises and end-users, in a manner that is consistent with regional address policies. 25 <lb/>The RIRs are membership-based organisations through which policies for address distribution are <lb/>developed in an open, bottom-up and transparent manner by regional policy forums. The three primary <lb/>goals of the RIR system are: i) conservation, to ensure efficient use of a finite resource and to avoid service <lb/>instabilities due to market distortions; ii) aggregation (routeability), to assist in maintenance of Internet <lb/>routing tables of a manageable size; and iii) registration, to provide a public registry documenting address <lb/>space allocations and assignments, to ensure uniqueness and provide information for Internet <lb/>troubleshooting. Each RIR is responsible for maintaining documentation on the allocation and use of IP <lb/>space within its region and for maintaining a public database (the IP Whois) of unique allocations of these <lb/>number resources, including IP space, AS number, organisation name and points of contact. 26 Importantly, <lb/>addresses are not considered as property and cannot be bought or sold. <lb/>Aggregation, minimum allocations and routeability <lb/>RIRs apply a minimum size for allocations, which facilitates prefix length-based filtering for routing <lb/>purposes. Furthermore, as a result of differing network sizes and different needs, prefix lengths vary by <lb/>region. In general, RIRs allocate IPv4 address prefixes to Local Internet Registries (LIRs) no longer than <lb/>/22 for AfriNIC and /20 for ARIN (Annex 5). In ARIN&apos;s case, if smaller allocations are needed, LIRs are <lb/>expected to request address space from their upstream provider. For ―provider independent‖ or ―multi-<lb/>homed‖ users, i.e. users with redundant interconnection and traffic exchange with two or more independent <lb/>networks, ARIN allocates IP address prefixes no longer than /22. <lb/>In the case of IPv6, the minimum allocation size for IPv6 address space to LIRs is /32 for all five <lb/>RIRs. LIRs are able to allocate IPv6 address blocks to end sites with a size between a /64 (a single subnet <lb/>within the end site) and a /48 (up to 65 536 routed subnets within the end site). The choice of the allocation <lb/>policies to sites within these bounds is a matter for the LIR to determine. <lb/>An important notion that is closely related to allocation sizes is that of address routeability. An <lb/>address, as a host locator (―where‖), must, for it to be useful, be recognised in routing announcements. 27 <lb/>Routing announcements have to be accepted and propagated through the routing system. Yet while the <lb/>practice of filtering the routes accepted from peers according to prefix length (prefix length filters) is not <lb/>yet commonly applied, filtering out longer prefixes could become more commonplace to help manage <lb/>increasing numbers of announcements in global routing tables. <lb/>IPv4 address depletion forecasts <lb/>Some experts project that the depletion of unallocated IPv4 address space will occur in the next two to <lb/>three years, unless another method is found to extend the life of the IPv4 address space. They project that, <lb/>if current allocation rates prevail, IANA will exhaust all available IPv4 space in the IANA pool by 2010 <lb/>and that the RIRs will run out of large unallocated contiguous blocks of IPv4 addresses to allocate in 2011 <lb/>(Figure 3). The most authoritative sources are Geoff Huston&apos;s &quot;IPv4 Address Space Report&quot; 28 and Tony <lb/>Hain&apos;s &quot;A Pragmatic Report on IPv4 Address Space Consumption&quot;. 29 Depending on the models used, their <lb/>projections for depletion vary by a few months. There is widening awareness within the Internet <lb/>community and among network operators of the upcoming depletion. There is also significant discussion <lb/>of potential ways to encourage an orderly transition to an IPv6-based Internet connectivity model. <lb/>It is important to note that estimates of a depletion date assume no major technology change, policy <lb/>change or ―land rush‖ effect. However, many new policies are being proposed and a ―land rush‖ can be <lb/></body>

IPv6, first and foremost, offers a widely expanded address <lb/>space, i.e. much greater volume. Experts deem that IPv6 provides other features and capabilities, including <lb/>simplified assignment of addresses and configuration options for communications devices as well as more <lb/>flexible addressing and Secure Neighbor Discovery. Some experts attribute additional benefits to IPv6, <lb/>although many have been ported to IPv4 or are contingent on the removal of NATs, which are deeply <lb/></body>

			<body>embedded into the existing infrastructure. Such potential benefits could include more robust security at the <lb/>transportation level, support of peer-to-peer applications, and better mobility support. <lb/>Dual-stack means running both IPv4 and IPv6, which enables communication with both IPv4 and <lb/>IPv6 nodes. 30 Tunneling is the packaging of IPv6 data through encapsulation or address assignment so it <lb/>can travel across an IPv4 network, or, less often, the packaging of IPv4 data to travel across an IPv4 <lb/>network. Translation enables IPv6-only devices to communicate with IPv4-only devices through an <lb/>intermediate device (e.g. an application layer gateway or proxy). <lb/>Current status of IPv6 deployment <lb/>This section examines the current status of IPv6, with respect to roll-out, technology and applications. <lb/>It shows that, while support for dual-stack IPv4/IPv6 is implemented in much -but not all -available <lb/>hardware and software, IPv6 is not currently used and interconnectedness is lacking. Many network <lb/>operators are not rolling-out IPv6 due to insufficient demand or cost-incentive, or are just beginning to <lb/>realise the need to transition to IPv6. <lb/>IPv6 address allocations <lb/>Going through the RIR&apos;s processes to obtain an IPv6 allocation is the first step in adopting IPv6. IPv6 <lb/>addresses can and are being obtained and routed. 31 The number of allocated prefixes provides an indication <lb/>of the number of organisations interested in implementing the IPv6 protocol (Figure 4, left). Meanwhile, <lb/>the size of the allocations (Figure 4, right) is difficult to use at an aggregate level because extremely large <lb/>allocations were made to some operators. The statistics shown in Figure 4 indicate that the European and <lb/>Asian markets have started, or are close to starting, large-scale deployments of IPv6, while North America, <lb/>Latin America and the Caribbean, and Africa, have been comparatively more interested in evaluating IPv6. <lb/>Figure 4.

About 50% of all <lb/>allocated IPv6 LIR prefixes are visible in the IPv6 routing table (Figure 5, right). 32 It should be pointed out, <lb/>however, that volumes of IPv6 activity are extremely low: there are less than 1 000 prefixes announced in <lb/></body>

Assignment registration information in <lb/>the IP Whois database shows that the most common sizes registered are /40s and /48s. The most common <lb/>prefix sizes announced are /32 and /48. IPv6 is generally assigned to end sites in fixed amounts (/48). <lb/>Therefore, the number of /48 prefixes in the IP Whois databases provides an indication of the utilization of <lb/>IPv6 address space by operators, since these IPv6 addresses have been assigned to end-users. This measure <lb/>indicates that Japan leads in terms of actual use of IPv6 allocations, by several orders of magnitude (Figure <lb/>6, left). <lb/>Figure 6.

			<body>IPv6/IPv4 traffic ratio <lb/>The level of IPv6 traffic is extremely low compared to IPv4 traffic. IPv6/IPv4 traffic ratio at Internet <lb/>Exchanges, such as the Amsterdam Internet eXchange (AMS-IX), is at less than 0.1%. Traffic measured in <lb/>Japan is similar (Figure 6, right). Early research conducted by Packet Clearing House (PCH) shows that at <lb/>least 17% of Internet eXchange Points (IXPs) support IPv6 explicitly. 37 There are some indications that <lb/>IPv6 traffic may actually be more significant, because much IPv6 traffic is encapsulated into IPv4 packets <lb/>with a transition tunnelling scheme to be transported over an IPv4 infrastructure. 38 <lb/>There is a misconception that no global IPv6 traffic means that there is no use of IPv6. As mentioned <lb/>above, current measurements may not account for ―transition‖ IPv6 traffic which is not native IPv6 traffic, <lb/>but instead is ―tunneled‖ inside IPv4. 39 In addition, there are indications that many organisations are using <lb/>IPv6 within internal networks for specific applications or to familiarise themselves with the new protocol. <lb/>For example, NTT estimates that IPv6 traffic inside its network is very significant because its video-on-<lb/>demand and video streaming traffic use IPv6 multicast. In another example, Comcast uses IPv6 to manage <lb/>its cable modems: while the volume of IPv6 traffic is very low, this traffic is extremely important to the <lb/>company. <lb/>Hardware and software <lb/>A pre-requisite to implementation of IPv6 is the availability of supporting operating systems, i.e. <lb/>Windows Server 2008, Windows Vista or MacOS X, on top of which application and services can then be <lb/>built. Many experts view widespread adoption of operating systems which support IPv6 by default, as a <lb/>determining factor with the potential to trigger the deployment of IPv6 in earnest. <lb/>Most mainstream hardware and software vendors support IPv6 in their products. The level of IPv6 <lb/>support in computer and device operating systems is a direct proxy for the number of computers and <lb/>devices that could potentially use the new protocol as soon as IPv6 connectivity is available. All significant <lb/>operating systems, DNS servers, programming languages, and routers now support IPv6 (e.g. BIND DNS, <lb/>PowerDNS, djbdns, Linux Mobile support IPv6, Java 1.4, etc.). Most recent operating systems releases, <lb/>such as Apple Mac OS X 10.x, Linux 2.6, Microsoft Windows Vista or Microsoft Windows Server 2008, <lb/>have IPv6 set by default. In particular, Microsoft&apos;s Windows Vista includes a tunnelling system whereby <lb/>IPv6 is enabled by default and Apple&apos;s Mac OS X has had IPv6 enabled &quot;out of the box&quot; for some time. <lb/>These two platforms represented respectively 100 million and 30 million licences by early 2008 out of a <lb/>total of 1.3 billion Internet users, i.e. some 10%. 40 Almost all Unix/Linux platforms and new smart phone <lb/>operating systems are IPv6-ready. 41 <lb/>The major equipment vendors, including 3Com, Alcatel, Cisco Systems, Hewlett Packard, Hitachi, <lb/>Juniper, Nokia, Nortel Networks, Novell, Siemens, or Sun Microsystems, all support IPv6. Several high-<lb/>use public domain applications, such as Mozilla Firefox, support IPv6. The conversion of commercial <lb/>applications has begun, e.g. with IBM Websphere Application Server 6. <lb/>Experts point out, however, that IPv6 support is not universal. For SOHO and home users, and <lb/>Internet service providers, an important barrier to IPv6 uptake is the lack of suitable customer premises <lb/>(CPE) devices, a market that is highly commoditised. A survey of IPv6 support in commercially available <lb/>firewall equipment, noted that the level of support for static packet filtering, stateful inspection, and <lb/>application layer inspection, stood at between 30% and 60% of products on the market. 42 In addition, all <lb/>IPv6 implementations face the challenge of in-house software, which may need to be upgraded, adapted or <lb/>replaced. 43 Lack of IPv6 support in network management applications is reported as being an issue, as in <lb/>other enterprise applications that can be used via the Internet or an intranet. <lb/></body>

			<body>Domain Name System <lb/>The inclusion of IPv6 support at all levels of the Domain Name System (DNS) is important to IPv6 <lb/>adoption because it allows IPv6-enabled hosts to reach other IPv6 hosts. Most Internet applications <lb/>regularly query the DNS. The DNS is a distributed registry system that ―resolves‖ (i.e. translates) user-<lb/>friendly host names (for example www.oecd.org) into a numeric Internet Protocol (IP) address, to locate <lb/>content or applications on the Internet. Hierarchical DNS names are supported by the ―dot‖ in the name, <lb/>and structured from right to left. The data in the DNS is stored in widely distributed sets of machines <lb/>known as ―name servers‖, which are queried by ―resolvers‖. Invisible to users, the top of the hierarchy is <lb/>the ―root‖, and the root servers that mirror this root. <lb/>The DNS uses a simple client-server model to perform a mapping between hostnames like <lb/>www.oecd.org and IP addresses such as 193.51.65.71. Devices on the Internet are usually configured to <lb/>send DNS queries to a resolving name server on the local network. This is typically done when the <lb/>device&apos;s operating system is configured. The local resolving name server is generally configured with the <lb/>addresses of the Internet&apos;s root name servers. When the local DNS server receives a query from a client <lb/>(e.g. a web browser), it follows a chain of delegations from the root of the DNS in order to resolve the <lb/>query. So for a lookup of www.oecd.org, the local resolver will first consult one of the root name servers. <lb/>It will refer the resolving name server to the name servers for .org. 44 One of the .org name servers will <lb/>return details of the name servers for oecd.org. When one of these is consulted, it returns the IP address of <lb/>www.oecd.org to the resolving name server which then passes that answer to the clients that originally <lb/>made that query. 45 <lb/>On 4 February 2008, IANA added IPv6 (AAAA) records in the ―hints‖ file to provide the IPv6 <lb/>addresses of four root servers whose operators requested this, thereby removing an important roadblock to <lb/>IPv6-only Internet access. The move means that IPv6-only devices may now be able to communicate on <lb/>the Internet. Back in July 2004, ICANN had added IPv6 support in the ―root‖, to include IPv6 addresses <lb/>for .KR, .JP and .FR zones. 46 Some 9% of the servers in the Internet DNS root zone are dual-stacked (84 <lb/>IPv6-enabled servers in the DNS root zone compared to 1 000 IPv4-enabled DNS servers in the root <lb/>zone). 47 Meanwhile, about half of the top-level (TLD) domain name servers are IPv4 and IPv6 capable. In <lb/>terms of generic top-level domains (gTLDs), .com and .net for example are IPv6-enabled. About a third of <lb/>country code top-level domain (ccTLD) registries (76 out of 245 48 ) are IPv6-enabled. And the <lb/>Measurement Factory found that in 2006 about 0.2% of the second-level zones in COM and NET were <lb/>using IPv6 addresses for their name servers. 49 <lb/></body>

			<body>II. MANAGING THE IPV4 DEPLETION <lb/>The regional Internet registries (RIRs) are considering a number of policy proposals and initiatives to <lb/>manage the remaining unallocated pool of IPv4 address space and existing IPv4 assignments, and to <lb/>encourage the adoption of IPv6. Policies are being prepared for the period until the depletion of previously <lb/>unallocated IPv4 address space and for the post-depletion period, when all IPv4 addresses will have been <lb/>allocated. The uppermost concern in these discussions is the likely continuing demand for IPv4 – fuelled <lb/>by continued Internet growth and transitioning to dual-stack – even as deployment of IPv6 takes place. <lb/>The following provides a snapshot of evolving proposals and discussions (broadly summarised in <lb/>Tables 2, 3 and 4). Interested parties are invited to continually check with the relevant organisations – in <lb/>particular, the regional Internet registries and IANA – for the latest address distribution policies and status <lb/>of discussions (Table 1). Scenarios being discussed include: <lb/>1. Attempts to better allocate the remaining IPv4 address space: <lb/> No modifications and a ―wait and see‖ or ―brick wall‖ approach. <lb/> ―Reserving‖ one ―/8‖ block per region, for fairness reasons and to enable some regions to <lb/>save IPv4 address space to ensure, for example, dual-stack for critical information <lb/>infrastructure. <lb/> Introducing policies to ensure that all RIRs run out at the same time so as to avoid regional <lb/>distortions. <lb/> Rationing IPv4 space by making requirements increasingly difficult while encouraging IPv6 <lb/>deployment. <lb/>2. Attempts to better re-use allocated address space: <lb/> No modifications and the possible emergence of a black or grey market for IPv4 addresses. <lb/> Re-using address space that was previously reserved for other purposes. <lb/> Reclaiming address space that is not being used. <lb/> Transferring IPv4 resources: discussions focus on whether to maintain a needs-based <lb/>approach or, at the other extreme, to let an open market manage supply and demand. <lb/>Table 1.

A sample of current policy proposals that pertain to the distribution of the remaining IPv4 <lb/>address blocks <lb/>DISTRIBUTION OF THE REMAINING IPv4 ADDRESS BLOCKS <lb/>PROPOSAL <lb/>DESCRIPTION <lb/>ARGUMENTS FOR PROPOSAL <lb/>ARGUMENTS AGAINST <lb/>PROPOSAL <lb/>Allocation <lb/>of <lb/>remaining <lb/>unallocated <lb/>pool of <lb/>IPv4 <lb/>50 <lb/>Advocates an equal distribution of <lb/>the remaining /8s to each RIR, <lb/>once the pool reaches the <lb/>threshold of 5 /8s. <lb/>The proposal takes the position that <lb/>each RIR community should then <lb/>be able define its regional policy on <lb/>how to distribute this final pool of <lb/>addresses. <lb/>This &quot; global proposal &quot; was <lb/>discussed at the LACNIC X <lb/>meeting in May 2007, in the APNIC <lb/>24 meeting in New Delhi in <lb/>September, and in ARIN and RIPE <lb/>meetings in October 2007. <lb/>Partial correction for a situation in which lower <lb/>historical use of IPv4 addresses means that LACNIC <lb/>and AfriNIC will have only few IPv4 addresses to go <lb/>through the transition with. <lb/>Reduce IANA &quot; s need to assess the relative merit of <lb/>potentially competing requests. <lb/>Each RIR community would define policies to <lb/>allocate the final block that best match their regional <lb/>situation, taking into account the relative <lb/>development of IPv4 and IPv6 in their region. <lb/>RIRs/NIRs, depending on the situation of their region <lb/>or country, may reserve some addresses for specific <lb/>constituencies in the Internet supply chain, whose <lb/> &quot; connection using dual-stack &quot; is deemed important. <lb/>For example, some RIRs might wish to create <lb/>safeguards for services they consider to be &quot; critical <lb/>infrastructure &quot; . <lb/>Regional distortions because some <lb/>parts of the world would reach <lb/>depletion of IPv4 addresses sooner <lb/>than others. <lb/>LIRs could become members of <lb/>different RIRs ( &quot; RIR shopping &quot; ) <lb/>because of remaining IPv4 resources <lb/>in some regions. <lb/> &quot; Set-asides &quot; could invite intervention <lb/>by regulators. <lb/> &quot; Set-asides &quot; may require qualitative <lb/>assessments by RIRs which may in <lb/>turn invite litigation. <lb/>Cooperative <lb/>distribution <lb/>51 <lb/>Would establish a process for RIR-<lb/>to-RIR redistribution of the tail-end <lb/>of the IPv4 pool, taking effect after <lb/>the IANA Reserve is exhausted. <lb/>The five RIRs would run out of IPv4 address space <lb/>at approximately the same time. <lb/>No margin for safeguards by RIRs. <lb/>Rationing <lb/>IPv4 <lb/>address <lb/>space <lb/>52 <lb/>Would institute a set of IPv4 <lb/>Address Allocation &quot;phases&quot; that <lb/>would make address allocation <lb/>requirements progressively more <lb/>stringent, using the amount of <lb/>address <lb/>space <lb/>remaining <lb/>unallocated by IANA as a metric. <lb/>Aims to provide a smooth transition <lb/>by encouraging the deployment of <lb/>IPv6. <lb/>Aims to encourage more efficient <lb/>use of IPv4 address space through <lb/>progressive supply rationing. <lb/>Also introduces new requirements <lb/>for <lb/>requesters, <lb/>such <lb/>as <lb/>documentation of non-private IPv4 <lb/>address space used for internal <lb/>infrastructure or documentation of <lb/>IPv6 plans for offering connectivity <lb/>and services. <lb/>At aggregate levels, documentation could provide <lb/>insight on plans of LIRs in their region, drivers and <lb/>barriers to adoption of IPv6, and other economic <lb/>considerations. Comparable data across regions <lb/>would be valuable to allow for benchmarking and <lb/>measurement of progress in the adoption of IPv6. <lb/>Progressively raising the requirements to obtain IPv4 <lb/>space may both decrease IPv4 demand, through <lb/>conservation and increased address space <lb/>efficiency, and increase incentives to migrate to IPv6 <lb/>by eventually making the obtaining of IPv4 space <lb/>contingent on demonstrating IPv6 services and <lb/>connectivity. <lb/>Helps to increase awareness of the option to deploy <lb/>IPv6, by compelling LIRs in need of address space <lb/>to start an inventory of systems that would require <lb/>adaptation to IPv6. <lb/>Commercially confidential concerns <lb/>are likely to be high. <lb/>Some Internet service providers that <lb/>oppose <lb/>increasing <lb/>efficiency <lb/>requirements argue that changes in <lb/>the rules would favour some business <lb/>models and market players. For <lb/>example, some operators serve only <lb/>large enterprises and it may be <lb/>relatively easier for these companies <lb/>to justify 100% utilisation rates. For <lb/>others, like broadband providers, it <lb/>may be relatively harder, since they <lb/>are in a &quot; retail &quot; model. <lb/>Assumes that significant address <lb/>space is inefficiently used. <lb/>The change in allocation criteria <lb/>would not have much impact if <lb/>assignments were already used <lb/>efficiently. <lb/></body>

A sample of current policy proposals that pertain to increasing the IPv4 address space <lb/>available for re-use <lb/>INCREASING THE IPv4 ADDRESS SPACE AVAILABLE FOR RE-USE <lb/>PROPOSAL <lb/>DESCRIPTION <lb/>ARGUMENTS FOR <lb/>PROPOSAL <lb/>ARGUMENTS AGAINST PROPOSAL <lb/>RECYCLING <lb/>RESERVED IPV4 <lb/>BLOCKS <lb/>Recycling existing assignments for other purposes. The <lb/>IANA has taken the lead in identifying address space that is <lb/>no longer in use, by working through the IPv4 registry data. <lb/>For example, 14.0.0.0/8 is a former &quot;Class A&quot; that was <lb/>reserved to connect X.25 networks to the Internet. Since <lb/>X.25 is no longer in significant use, this space has been <lb/>recovered and has been placed back into the IPv4 free pool, <lb/>so 14.0.0.0/8 addresses can potentially be reassigned for <lb/>other uses. 53 <lb/>The Class E space, encompassing the &quot; top &quot; end of the <lb/>address space, 240.0.0.0/4 is also a candidate that <lb/>engineers have proposed to redefine as available for use, <lb/>potentially in private or even public use contexts. <lb/>Contributors to the <lb/>IETF are currently <lb/>considering feasible <lb/>re-uses for the Class <lb/>E space. <lb/>Many of the currently deployed <lb/>implementations of the IP protocol stack <lb/>were configured to ignore traffic to or from <lb/>those Class E address blocks. <lb/>RECLAIMING <lb/>UNUSED IPV4 <lb/>SPACE <lb/>In the early days of the Internet, large blocks of IP <lb/>addresses were allocated to individual entities. It is <lb/>suggested that these allocations, when these entities no <lb/>longer exist or when addresses are not used or are not used <lb/>efficiently, could be reclaimed by the IANA or by the RIRs <lb/>and reissued. <lb/>Some have advocated stronger reclamation efforts, which <lb/>may not or may not be &quot; voluntary &quot; . <lb/>An important effort was for ARIN to adopt a &quot; Legacy RSA &quot; <lb/>on 31 October 2007, for organisations and individuals in the <lb/>ARIN service region, who hold legacy Internet number <lb/>resources not covered by any other Registration Services <lb/>Agreement with ARIN. 54 <lb/>Over the past five <lb/>years, attempts to <lb/>recycle <lb/>legacy <lb/>address space have <lb/>been made, with <lb/>some success. <lb/>Relatively few efforts <lb/>have been made to <lb/>reach out to legacy <lb/>holders. <lb/>Would require sizeable effort and expense, <lb/>substantive negotiation (in multiple court <lb/>systems around the globe) to retrieve any <lb/>sizeable block. <lb/>Likelihood of getting back more than a few <lb/>/8 blocks is very low. <lb/>Experts from the addressing groups <lb/>consider that most easily recycled space <lb/>has already been reclaimed <lb/>Since legacy blocks were issued under <lb/>terms that did not include reclamation <lb/>provisions, and predate the existence of the <lb/>RIRs, there is no legal framework under <lb/>which to do so in the handful of countries <lb/>concerned, except for legacy holders that <lb/>have agreed to sign a registration services <lb/>agreement (RSA). <lb/></body>

			<body>Table 4. Policy proposals to enable IPv4 address transfers <lb/>ARGUMENTS USED FOR PROPOSAL <lb/>ARGUMENTS USED AGAINST PROPOSAL <lb/>Ongoing demand: The ongoing demand for IPv4 address space, beyond the <lb/>time of unallocated address availability, may lead to a period of movement of <lb/>IPv4 address blocks between address holders. <lb/>Developing countries: Since many ISPs or other entities in <lb/>developing countries came relatively late to using the Internet at a <lb/>time when the RIR system was already established, their current <lb/>allocations should for the most part be proportionate to <lb/>demonstrated need. <lb/>Developing countries may not have sufficient financial resources to <lb/>purchase addresses on a market, while there could potentially be a <lb/>windfall for well-resourced countries that joined the Internet early <lb/>on. On the other hand, after IPv4 free pool depletion, the choice <lb/>offered to all Internet users would either be IPv4 at a higher cost in <lb/>a market environment or the unavailability of IPv4 addresses. <lb/>In addition, the cost of IPv6-compatible equipment is currently <lb/>higher than for pre-used IPv4 equipment, making less well-<lb/>resourced ISPs more reliant on IPv4. A lack of IPv4 addresses, <lb/>could, for example, curtail economic market entry or expansion by <lb/>new &quot; home grown &quot; competitors. <lb/>Efficiency: Providing an incentive for unused IPv4 address space to be made <lb/>available for active use, would help to satisfy residual demand for IPv4 address <lb/>space during the transition to IPv6. <lb/>Security of records: Ensuring both the accuracy and integrity of records which <lb/>may otherwise be degraded without a sanctioned and transparent mechanism <lb/>to transfer records. <lb/>Registration: Avoid a black market that would drive prices up. A black market <lb/>would degrade the accuracy of existing records, as changes to the registration <lb/>data would not be reflected in the records. This could have ramifications for <lb/>the security and stability of the Internet for many uses, such as in day-to-day <lb/>internetworking or dealing with such events as denial of service attacks. There <lb/>is also a broader community of users of such records, ranging from commercial <lb/>geo-location services to law enforcement agencies. <lb/>Hoarding: If unused address space cannot be traded, the user has no <lb/>incentive to return it. However, if secondary trading is possible, this creates an <lb/>incentive against hoarding, although it does not eliminate the possibility of <lb/>hoarding: operators may for example wish to block the entrance of additional <lb/>operators or to harm competitors. <lb/>Speculation: A market entails the potential for certain forms of <lb/>market failures, including the possibility of speculation and price <lb/>manipulation, which would be counter to existing policy goals. <lb/>Proposals include safeguards aimed at preventing speculation by <lb/>preventing parties to a transaction from entering into another <lb/>transaction for 24 months. <lb/>Transition to IPv6: A likely increase in the price of IPv4 resources would <lb/>translate into a financial compensation for those selling IPv4 addresses, <lb/>helping them to bear the cost of renumbering/investing in IPv6. <lb/>Allows organisations to choose the strategy that is best for them, rather than <lb/>forcing a one-size-fits-all solution: some companies are likely to use IPv6 with <lb/>IPv4 and NAT or a proxy to reach the remaining IPv4 Internet, while others <lb/>may &quot; pay &quot; someone else to migrate and use their space to delay migrating until <lb/>all their systems are ready. <lb/>Transition to IPv6: Transferring IPv4 addresses could lengthen <lb/>the transition period from IPv4 to IPv6, and as a result, increase the <lb/>likelihood of NAT solutions being widely implemented. <lb/>Predictability: Some argue that introducing a market introduces <lb/>confusion and removes incentives for those who implement IPv6 to <lb/>return IPv4 address space. <lb/>Existing price for addresses: Transfers already take place during mergers or <lb/>acquisitions. Addresses have a scarcity value and cost is transmitted to the <lb/>customer. Cost of addresses will have a market value whether or not transfers <lb/>are liberalised. <lb/>Pricing: The availability of IPv6 as a free and essentially unlimited resource <lb/>means that IPv4 may only have value for a limited time. <lb/>Supply: Some claim there will be a limited supply compared to <lb/>likely high demand for IPv4 address space in the short and <lb/>medium-term, driving up prices. <lb/>Competition: Fosters competition by providing a mechanism for new entrants <lb/>to acquire address space. <lb/>Enforcement: RIR &quot; s only lever, to ensure that records for transfers go through <lb/>them, is whether the address space can be routed on the core of the Internet. <lb/>Global routing table expansion: Smaller blocks being traded <lb/>would result in increased deaggregation. This could increase the <lb/>cost of routing equipment to accommodate larger routing tables. 55 <lb/>Policy proposals aim to control deaggregation by not permitting an <lb/>entity transferring IPv4 to apply again for a specified time period. <lb/>Inter-RIR considerations: Strong arguments to consider global, or &quot; inter-RIR &quot; <lb/>transfers rather than RIR-only, because of the regional distribution of IPv4 <lb/>addresses, regional levels of demand for IPv4 addresses, and projections of <lb/>demand within each region. <lb/>Question of whether a global transfer domain would create inequities and <lb/>imbalances in the residual IPv4 Internet that may require some other form of <lb/>intervention or mediation to redress and potential policy mechanisms to <lb/>mitigate such risks. <lb/>To avoid abuse of an inter-RIR transfer system, necessary to increase inter-<lb/>RIR co-ordination to verification policies, and possibly to direct (i.e. cross-<lb/>regional) verification of &quot;need&quot; itself. Necessity to define how the &quot;needs <lb/>verification&quot; or qualifying process will work even in an intra-regional context. <lb/>Inter-RIR considerations: Difficult to enforce regional membership <lb/>while resources are global. <lb/>Proponents of a modified transfer mechanism currently only permit <lb/>transfer between account holders at the same RIR. However, <lb/>entities could presumably create accounts at multiple RIRs. In <lb/>addition, significant differences in levels of financial resources can <lb/>exist within regions. <lb/>Conflicts with RIR principle of not being involved in routing. <lb/>Whether inter-RIR transfers were authorised would impact on the <lb/>efficiency of a potential market. <lb/></body>

			<body>Proposals to enable IP address transfers <lb/>The pending depletion of the free common pool of IPv4 addresses has led some in the Internet <lb/>addressing community to propose modifications to the policies governing the transfer of IPv4 addresses. <lb/>The question that is being debated with respect to transfers is whether greater flexibility in being able to <lb/>transfer IP addresses could assist in any process of recycling previously allocated addresses. Some hold the <lb/>view that significant amounts of IPv4 address space, including legacy assignments, may be transferred <lb/>between parties if there are financial incentives for them to do so: address space that is allocated but <lb/>unused would be moved back into potential use, albeit at a cost to the potential user. <lb/>A first proposal for IP Address transfers was introduced in the APNIC region in September 2007. 56 <lb/>The proposal suggests removing restrictions on the transfer of registration of IPv4 address allocations and <lb/>IPv4 portable address assignments between current APNIC account holders. The proposal argues that the <lb/>ongoing demand for IPv4 address space, beyond the time of unallocated address availability, will lead to a <lb/>period of movement of IPv4 address blocks between address holders. A similar proposal, entitled <lb/>―Enabling methods for reallocation of IPv4 resources‖, was proposed and is being discussed in the RIPE <lb/>region. 57 A different proposal is being discussed by ARIN. 58 <lb/>The proposals placed before each of the three RIR communities establish initial sets of ―rules of the <lb/>game‖ for address transfers and mandate that all transfers be undertaken through the local RIR. They place <lb/>conditions on the transfer of the IPv4 address block, the source of the transfer (i.e. original assignee) and <lb/>the recipient of the transfer (i.e. new assignee). Such ground rules include, for example, only enabling the <lb/>transfer of IPv4 address blocks equal to, or larger than, a /24 prefix (16 384 addresses) between existing <lb/>account holders. Further stipulations include that the source entity will be ineligible to receive any further <lb/>IPv4 address allocations or assignments from the RIR for a period of 24 months after the transfer and that <lb/>the RIRs will charge recipients a service fee on the transfer transaction. Holders of legacy address space <lb/>are allowed to participate. <lb/>A discussion on potential supply and demand <lb/>The usefulness of enabling transfers depends on potential supply and demand. However, it is difficult <lb/>to predict potential supply of IPv4 addresses, since organisations to-date have had no incentive to return <lb/>unused addresses and since data on actual use of public IPv4 addresses in private networks is generally <lb/>proprietary information. <lb/>Opponents of a potential liberalisation of transfer policy point to a likely high demand for IPv4 <lb/>address space in the short and medium term, compared to limited supply. For example, the ISPs forming <lb/>the membership of the European Telecommunications Network Operators&apos; Association (ETNO) point to <lb/>the fact that the Association&apos;s membership represents a large portion of demand for IP addresses in the <lb/>RIPE region. While address demand is high, the point they stress is that sources of supply are limited in all <lb/>regions except for the ARIN region: because of the Host-Density ratio utilisation requirements, address <lb/>holders with an RIR membership are deemed to overall efficiently use their IPv4 allocations. Therefore, <lb/>the primary source of supply is viewed by some to be the legacy, i.e. pre-RIR, address space allocations. <lb/>For historical reasons, these allocations are located primarily within the ARIN region. Other views have <lb/>also been expressed in the debate on the matter of regional variations of potential supply of addresses for <lb/>unrestricted transfer. <lb/>Geoff Huston, Chief Scientist at APNIC, points out that 90% of RIR-allocated space is routed while <lb/>only 40% of legacy space is routed. He uses publicly advertised address space as a proxy for consumption <lb/>(and ongoing demand), because 90 to 95% of (non-recent) address space allocated since 2000 is advertised <lb/>on the public Internet. By contrast, only 40% of address space allocated before 2000, i.e. before the RIR <lb/></body>

			<note place="headnote">DSTI/ICCP(2007)20/FINAL <lb/></note>

			<page>27 <lb/></page>

			<body>system, is advertised. A model developed by Huston estimates that currently allocated but unadvertised <lb/>address space could support continued demand until mid 2019, i.e. for about 7 years after the exhaustion of <lb/>the free pool of unallocated IPv4 addresses, under specific assumptions. 59 Some stress that much of the <lb/>address space that is unadvertised (not publicly routed) is actually in use within inter-networks that do not <lb/>exchange packets with the public Internet and therefore that it may not be available for re-allocation. <lb/>The global routing table shows whether allocated IPv4 address space is routed or not publicly routed <lb/>(Annex 4). Unallocated space and space reserved for technical use can also be represented. 60 The <lb/>allocations/utilisation rates shown in the figure reflect the history of IPv4 address allocation and increased <lb/>efficiency measures introduced by the RIRs over time. It provides a visualisation of the sizes of routed <lb/>address space, from the largest prefixes (/8) through to the smallest prefixes possible (/32). <lb/>In addition, several surveys that examine the population of ―visible‖ IPv4 Internet hosts find that only <lb/>a low percentage of advertised addresses respond, which could mean that even among routed address <lb/>space, significant address space is unused. For example, one study finds that only 3.6% of allocated <lb/>addresses are actually occupied by visible hosts. 61 <lb/>Possible safeguards <lb/>It is possible to envisage a number of potential constraints to address some stakeholders&apos; concerns. <lb/>The most prominent potential constraint is to continue the existing RIR policy of demonstrated need to <lb/>avoid speculation with IPv4 address space. This means that only qualified applicants would be eligible to <lb/>participate in the transfer of IPv4 address space. The repercussions of other qualification mechanisms, and <lb/>of the absence of such forms of qualification, are also under investigation. Whether the RIRs have the <lb/>means and resources to enforce such constraints, and what form they should take is a moot point. The main <lb/>criteria in these considerations should be whether changes assist the Internet community to more <lb/>effectively meet specific goals (the stated objective to-date has been to safeguard addresses for <lb/>demonstrated need, to maintain accurate records for security and operational reasons and to minimise the <lb/>load on the global routing tables) and whether they can be enforced. <lb/>If a market were to develop such that addresses were monetised, its nature and the challenges for <lb/>enforcing regulation, outside of any individual national regulatory framework, would require thorough <lb/>consideration. However, if Internet service providers chose to require the registration of address space <lb/>within RIR databases, there could be a mechanism for RIR policy setting mechanisms to be enforced. If, <lb/>however, ISPs chose to negotiate transfers of address space outside of the context of the RIR policies, <lb/>those policies by definition do not apply. There may be a tipping point, perhaps dependent on the creation <lb/>of an alternative ―titles registry‖ that the ISPs can be convinced to use (Box 3). <lb/>From an economic perspective, there are strong arguments to increase the allocation efficiency of <lb/>scarce resources such as IPv4 address space. For new entrants, as well as existing operators, being able to <lb/>acquire IPv4 addresses that were previously allocated to other parties, seems important to maintain <lb/>interoperability. Any kind of institutional arrangement should ensure efficient resource use, promote <lb/>competition, and minimise interference. Political acceptability is likely to be key, considering the potential <lb/>windfall gains for some actors (although such windfalls could arguably exist even without a market). <lb/></body>

			<body>Box 3. Developing a routing PKI or &quot; Certification of Internet resources &quot; <lb/>Several RIRs are developing Internet resource certification frameworks in view of validating assertions of &quot;right-<lb/>to-use&quot; of an Internet Number Resource (IP Addresses and Autonomous System Numbers). APNIC, for example, has <lb/>built a Resource Certification System. <lb/>62 One potential use for this type of certification and the associated Public Key <lb/>Infrastructure (PKI) is to provide a validation framework to support secure routing on the Internet and improve other <lb/>aspects of securing the use of addresses within protocol transactions. Such certification by RIRs would also apply to a <lb/>market for IP addresses, where a major public policy concern relates to consumer confidence. <lb/>Certificates would play three roles in a market transaction: i) validating that a &quot; seller is indeed a valid seller &quot; who <lb/>has clear &apos;title&apos; to the addresses that are being sold; ii) ensuring that the transaction of the sale cannot be repudiated or <lb/>denied once completed, by either party to the sale, and; iii) ensuring that the buyer becomes the clear &quot; title &quot; holder of <lb/>the addresses following the transaction and that the seller has given up rights to the address. <lb/>Each allocation or assignment made by an RIR is certified by the same RIR. Each address holder holds a private <lb/>key, whose matching public key is published in the RIR-issued certificate. Anything signed by the address <lb/>holder&apos;s private key can be validated through the RIR-issued certificate and the addresses bound to that certificate. In <lb/>the case of using certificates to secure the routing system for example, an address holder would digitally sign a routing <lb/>origination authority, giving an autonomous system address holder the authority to advertise into the routing system a <lb/>routing advertisement for that address. A third party receiving the routed object could use the RIR-issued certificate to <lb/>validate the signed authority and thereby check the valid advertisement of that address. Overall, adoption of security <lb/>measures in the Internet&apos;s routing system that could make use of an Internet address PKI would help prevent various <lb/>attacks, including denial of service, third party traffic inspection and service cloning. Such attacks on the integrity of the <lb/>routing system often occur within today&apos;s Internet. But because of the distributed nature of the system and the diverse <lb/>trust environment, these attacks are extremely challenging to detect, let alone prevent, without a structured trust model <lb/>that number resource certification could provide. <lb/>Some express reservations and point out that such certification in the context of adoption of secure routing <lb/>frameworks, expands the role of the RIRs into that of certificate issuers which, in turn, gives them a central role in the <lb/>operation of the Internet &quot; s routing system. <lb/>In other respects, RIRs appear to be a logical institution to issue such certificates since what is being certified are <lb/>the number resource allocation and assignment actions of the RIRs themselves, and the information provided through <lb/>the certificate is the information published by the RIRs via the Whois query systems. Certificates republish this same <lb/>information in a manner that is strongly secured, allowing other parties to make decisions as to the validity and <lb/>authenticity of the use of an address. <lb/>The efforts to improve the security of the routing system and offer capabilities to support the integrity of the <lb/>operation of a market in addresses, illustrates the adaptability and reactivity of the RIR system to evolving <lb/>requirements of the address community. Governments should participate and comment as stakeholders. <lb/>With respect to modifications to the existing transfer policies, the Internet community will need to <lb/>take the following into consideration: <lb/> The status of addresses: IP addresses are not currently considered as property by the Internet <lb/>community. The introduction of a modified transfer mechanism does not necessarily imply that <lb/>this status needs to be changed if they were, for example, treated as partial use-rights rather than <lb/>all-encompassing property rights. 63 Changes could also emerge in relation to concepts such as <lb/>―ownership‖ and ―leasing‖. <lb/> The geographic scope of transfers: whether IP addresses could be transferred within RIR <lb/>regions, between countries with a NIR, between RIR regions, inside countries, or between <lb/>countries, and if/how policies could be enforced. <lb/> The technical scope of transfers: whether the entire IPv4 address space would be transferable or <lb/>just a subset, and depending on when transfers were enabled, whether the currently unassigned <lb/>pool participates. <lb/> Pricing: what safeguards are imposed upon transfers to help avoid IP price manipulation. <lb/></body>

			<note place="headnote">DSTI/ICCP(2007)20/FINAL <lb/></note>

			<page>29 <lb/></page>

			<body> Participants in transfers: whether existing RIR practices and procedures, in relation to <lb/>demonstrated need, would be used to determine qualified participants or, if not, whether an open <lb/>market would be compatible with achieving existing policy objectives. <lb/> The optimal size of address blocks and complimentary markets: what the minimum size-<lb/>transfer block should be, how a market would impact global routing table sizes, whether <lb/>complimentary markets, for example a market for route entries, would be co-ordinated or who <lb/>would route smaller address blocks. <lb/> The design, structure and convenor of a &quot; market venue &quot; : what requirements and issues of <lb/>market design and structure would be; price formation and price discovery, transaction and timing <lb/>costs, and information and disclosure. Microstructure for financial markets can offer insights into <lb/>market design. Comparisons could also draw on secondary markets for spectrum allocations and <lb/>other scare resources (Annex 8). Another question may be whether the RIRs would act as the <lb/>convenor of market venue for transfers and facilitate making the connection between buyer and <lb/>seller in the same form as a stock exchange operator, or whether the RIRs would assume a more <lb/>limited role of a ―title office‖ as the trusted authority for number resource disposition information. <lb/>The foregoing only provides a cursory examination of some of the issues that will be considered by <lb/>the Internet community. Over time, the behaviour of different actors will be highly dependent on the <lb/>policies and practices adopted by the Internet community and how the valuation placed on IPv4 addresses <lb/>develops and changes as positive network effects build for IPv6. <lb/>For governments, the most important message may be that any of the options available to the Internet <lb/>community may only imperfectly address broader economic issues. Since after the depletion of IPv4 <lb/>addresses, the IPv4 Internet will continue to function, actors who wish to connect to both IPv4 and IPv6 <lb/>nodes need to have access to IPv4 addresses: consequently, mechanisms to extend the life of IPv4 or tip it <lb/>towards specific uses are being thoroughly investigated. In addition, different options may have potential <lb/>public policy implications, such as in the area of security, on which governments should comment as a <lb/>stakeholder. All stakeholders are encouraged to contribute to address allocation mechanisms and policies, <lb/>and their review, through providing input in appropriate for a, such as the regional Internet registries, as to <lb/>priorities and local requirements. <lb/></body>

			<body>III. DRIVERS AND CHALLENGES OF IPV6 DEPLOYMENT <lb/>This section investigates business drivers and challenges related to the introduction of IPv6. The vast <lb/>additional address space available with IPv6 can help the Internet to support the next generation of <lb/>wireless, high-bandwidth, multimedia applications as well as growth in the overall number of users. <lb/>Today&apos;s IPv6 deployment drivers focus on performance approaching that of IPv4 albeit on an expanded <lb/>scale, operational cost savings through simpler network models when deploying applications, and on <lb/>enabling new product and service innovation. General benefits or application areas for IPv6 are listed <lb/>(Table 5). <lb/>Industry is in the early stages of IPv6 production deployment, but substantial challenges remain for <lb/>the adoption of IPv6 on a meaningful scale. Although the success of IPv6 will ultimately depend on the <lb/>new applications that run over IPv6, a key part of the deployment of IPv6 in the short and medium-term is <lb/>that of co-existing with existing IPv4 networks. Furthermore, many Internet service providers currently <lb/>lack incentives to adopt IPv6. This is due to several factors such as a lack of awareness, lack of demand, <lb/>expertise and capital to make investments that do not provide short-term benefits. Challenges to IPv6 <lb/>deployment can be ranked in function of urgency (Annex 7). <lb/>Table 5. Several benefit/application categories <lb/>Impact Metric <lb/>Application/ <lb/>Market <lb/>General Description: Examples <lb/>Cost reductions resulting <lb/>from increased efficiency <lb/>NAT removal <lb/>• According to RTI International (2005), enterprise and application <lb/>vendors &quot; spending on NAT workarounds accounts for up to 30% of IT-<lb/>related expenditures. <lb/>Value of remote access <lb/>to existing <lb/>products/services <lb/>Increased life <lb/>expectancy of <lb/>products <lb/>• Automobile <lb/> 64 and appliance owners <lb/> 65 could increase the functionality <lb/>and life expectancy of their products through the use of remote <lb/>monitoring and support services. <lb/>Service costs <lb/> • Automotive and appliance owners could decrease service costs <lb/> through the use of remote monitoring and support services. <lb/>Innovation in <lb/>communications and <lb/>online products/services<lb/>New mobile data <lb/>services <lb/>• Wireless companies could sell new features through expanded <lb/> network capabilities.<lb/>66 <lb/>• Wireless companies need IPv6 to increase address capacity for peer-<lb/> to-peer (P2P) applications. <lb/>Online gaming <lb/> • Gaming and game console makers could see expanded functionality <lb/>and thus opportunities for innovative new products.<lb/>Source: OECD (2007), adapted from IPv6 Economic Impact Assessment, RTI International for National Institute of Standards &amp; <lb/>Technology, October 2005. <lb/>DRIVERS <lb/>Scalability and demand for IP addresses <lb/>Escalating demand for IP addresses is a main driver for IPv6 adoption. Convergence and the <lb/>development of ubiquitous IP networks and IP-based communications place pressure on the available IPv4 <lb/>address space. The current IPv4 address space is unable to satisfy the potentially very significant increase <lb/>in the number of users, or the requirements of emerging applications such as Internet-enabled wireless <lb/>devices, home and industrial appliances, Internet-connected transportations, integrated telephony services, <lb/>sensors networks such as RFID, IEEE 802.15.4/6LoWPAN, distributed computing or gaming.

			<body>environments and the ready-to-use capability required by some consumer Internet appliances further <lb/>increases the address requirements. <lb/>IPv6 quadruples the number of network address bits from 32 bits (in IPv4) to 128 bits, which provides <lb/>sufficient globally unique IP addresses for a vast number of networked devices. The use of globally unique <lb/>IPv6 addresses simplifies the mechanisms used for reachability of these network devices. <lb/>There may also be an increasing number of cases in which networks ―outgrow‖ IPv4 private space, <lb/>such as in the case of Comcast, a large cable operator that transitioned to IPv6 because it outgrew the <lb/>largest private address space of 16.7 million addresses. It was economically critical for Comcast to <lb/>transition to IPv6 in order to continue to support the growth of its network. Mobile operators, for example, <lb/>could potentially consume large amounts of IP addresses. <lb/>Public procurement mandates <lb/>In some cases, aggressive IPv6 adoption curves by government bodies have provided incentives for <lb/>industry, particularly those vendors supporting or interacting with the government, to work toward IPv6 <lb/>adoption themselves. In many cases, public sector mandates have caused vendors to develop IPv6 <lb/>solutions, which then accelerate deployment in private sector companies, because vendor software already <lb/>supports specific features. <lb/>In June 2003, the United States Department of Defense (DoD) mandated the integration of IPv6 to be <lb/>ready by 2008. 67 In June 2005, the United States&apos; Office of Management Budget (OMB) set June 2008 as <lb/>the deadline by which all agencies&apos; infrastructure (network backbones) must be using IPv6 and agency <lb/>networks must be interfacing with this infrastructure. 68 To provide an idea of the impetus such a decision <lb/>can provide to the market and vendor and operator strategies, spending on communications and network <lb/>services by the US federal government will grow from USD 17.6 billion in 2007 to USD 22.4 billion by <lb/>2012. 69 The Japanese Ministry of Internet Affairs and Communications released a ―Guideline for e-<lb/>Government IPv6 Systems‖ in April 2007, to help central ministries plan for IPv6 adoption and promote <lb/>IPv6 for e-Government systems. 70 Targets set by the Korean Ministry of Information and Communication <lb/>include converting Internet equipment in public institutions to IPv6 by 2010. The Australian Government <lb/>Information Management Office (AGIMO) has also released its Strategy for the Transition to IPv6 for <lb/>Australian Government agencies, to last from January 2008 to December 2015. 71 <lb/>Innovative applications, including sensor networks and embedded systems <lb/>Most of the work on IPv6 to-date has focused on ensuring that what worked well with IPv4 continues <lb/>to work with IPv6. But an equal level of functionality is only the first step. A key driver for IPv6 is to make <lb/>possible new business and services on a large scale, such as networked sensors for industrial or home <lb/>automation services. In addition, when new services are greenfield deployments, they do not have to <lb/>interoperate with legacy IPv4 hosts and applications and can be directly deployed over native IPv6 <lb/>infrastructures (or dual-stack). <lb/>Trends in the Internet include more capable consumer devices – personal digital assistants, videogame <lb/>consoles, and popular audio-visual equipment, including home servers, set-top boxes, digital TV sets, <lb/>networked home appliances, car navigation systems, as well as wireless sensor networks, and intelligent <lb/>transport systems and servers in trains, ships and airplanes. Several features of IPv6, including its support <lb/>for near unlimited numbers of potentially connected devices at any given time, combined with mobility, <lb/>make the standard a logical candidate for some of these new uses. Sensor networks can also benefit from <lb/>the plug-and-play capabilities of IPv6, such as address auto-configuration and anycast address support. <lb/>Beyond energy management, environmental information systems, facility control and management or <lb/></body>

			<body>disaster protection (Box 4), applications in areas such as home security and health are emerging. A number <lb/>of governmental authorities have actively promoted sector-specific IPv6 applications (Annex 3). <lb/>Box 4. Using IPv6 to Bridge the Physical and Virtual Worlds <lb/>Arch Rock uses IPv6 in low power wireless meshed networks of sensors. <lb/>72 The company chose Internet <lb/>Protocol-based sensor networks to benefit from convergence toward the well-proven and open &quot; Internet Protocol &quot; (IP): <lb/>IP integration helps to reliably manage sensor networks and sensor nodes using familiar Internet technologies at a <lb/>dramatically lower operating cost compared to the rival proprietary options. The company uses the 6LoWPAN <lb/>standard, which has scaled the IPv6 protocol down sufficiently to be useful in wireless embedded networks. The <lb/>standard supports both connected and disconnected operation. <lb/>73 Other reasons for adopting IPv6 include its ease of <lb/>management of two-way communications without the need for translation, its large address space to support millions <lb/>of sensors, its plug and play networking capabilities, energy efficiency and simplified protocol processing as well as to <lb/>support future growth and new innovations. Arch rock &quot; s sensor network solutions are rapidly deployable in many <lb/>challenging environments and applications such as open fields, civil engineering structures, on mobile high-value <lb/>items, factory floors, or office buildings. <lb/>With wireless sensor networks providing the ability to measure and monitor places and things that were once <lb/>impossible or impractical to instrument, new applications using 6LoWPAN have demonstrated they could help: <lb/>-Energy management: applications using IPv6-based sensor networks allow efficient energy management with <lb/>monitoring solutions for energy awareness and control in enterprise data centers, as well as with electric utility <lb/>programs to influence and sometimes control electric load from subscribers. In Japan for example, the Tokyo <lb/>Metropolitan Art Museum and the Tokyo Art Space have been able to reduce energy consumption by about 5%. <lb/>-Road traffic management: road to car communication systems with IPv6-based sensor networks offer <lb/>promises to help reduce traffic jams and fuel consumption. <lb/>-Risk detection and prevention: IPv6-based sensor networks can be used for global monitoring and disaster <lb/>management of seismic activity, volcanic eruptions or landslides and avalanches, disaster prevention, or <lb/>environmental problems. <lb/>-Industrial automation: wireless sensor networks using Ipv6 can offer previously inaccessible insight and <lb/>information. Costs are reduced because wires or heavy instruments are no longer needed. Problems can be detected <lb/>early, failures or outages prevented, and new information and data can be collected to keep machinery running without <lb/>direct human intervention. <lb/>-Location and proximity: applications developed by Arch Rock include asset tracking and monitoring, worker <lb/>safety, quality of service, hazardous material management, and regulatory compliance. <lb/>Source: Arch Rock, www.archrock.com. <lb/>Less expensive network administration <lb/>Some network administrators deem that IPv6 simplifies some functions in network administration, <lb/>through a simplified header that can improve routing efficiency, serverless autoconfiguration, easier <lb/>renumbering, ready-to-use support, and multicast support with increased addresses. <lb/>Actors are likely to deploy IPv6 when the cost/benefit ratio of that deployment, given network effects, <lb/>warrants it. Large address consumers, faced with non-predictable costs in obtaining resources, are likely to <lb/>accelerate deployment plans for IPv6 for their internal infrastructure where possible, complemented by <lb/>private use IPv4 address space, thereby freeing up the public IPv4 addresses used for internal infrastructure <lb/>for use in customer assignments. In addition, it will become increasingly difficult and expensive to obtain <lb/>new IPv4 address space to expand networks and the cost and complexity associated with keeping track of <lb/>and managing remaining IPv4 address space will also increase. Therefore, there may be strategic benefits <lb/>in avoiding opportunity costs or operational costs associated with IPv4 and increasing density of NATs. <lb/>Adoption decisions will be taken by many and various stakeholders (e.g. infrastructure vendors, <lb/>software vendors, ISPs and users) based on the costs and benefits they see for their activity (Figure 7). As <lb/>mentioned above, Internet service providers may decide to implement IPv6 in their internal networks once <lb/></body>

			<body>they consider that the benefits of reduced operational expenditures (current or projected) outweigh the <lb/>capital expenditure of maintaining IPv4 and increasing NATs. It is important to note that considerations of <lb/>provision of external IPv4 connectivity services and dual-stack networking remain even in such a scenario. <lb/>Figure 7. Supply chain stakeholders, costs, and benefits <lb/>Source: OECD based on RTI, IPv6 Economic Impact Assessment, National Institute of Standards &amp; Technology, <lb/>October 2005. <lb/>Better mobility support <lb/>While mobility can be supported at various levels, this document considers IP layer mobility only, <lb/>which is critical because it is neither conditioned by supporting wireless radio technology nor by <lb/>applications. A further distinction can be made between mobile nodes and nomadic nodes: while mobile <lb/>nodes need to preserve established communications during movement, nomadic nodes only need to be able <lb/>to establish new communications each time they re-connect to the network. The following considers <lb/>mobile nodes. <lb/>It is projected that, in the wireless arena, very large numbers of mobile phones, personal digital <lb/>assistants (PDAs), and other types of wireless devices will increasingly require Internet access in the <lb/>future, and therefore, IP addressing. Some experts consider that IPv6 offers improved support for mobility. <lb/>Within the IETF, a number of working groups are using IPv6 as the basis for solving protocol problems <lb/>related to handset mobility. 74 IPv6 is also the basis for new mobility-related protocol developments, <lb/>including in the areas of ad hoc networking. 75 Some developments target sensor networks. 76 In general, <lb/>updating applications is an important transition issue, including applications that run on handsets to support <lb/>IPv6. A number of mobile applications, in particular many mobile operating systems, support IPv6. <lb/>Mobile phone operators and manufacturers see handsets as ―always-on‖ end points in a network. This <lb/>architecture has developed into 3GPP IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS), to be used with smartphones. As <lb/>Internet-connected handsets that offer voice, data and video become the norm, operators could start to <lb/>deploy IPv6 on a large scale. 77 While many smart phone operating systems support IPv6, a challenge for <lb/>mobile operators is the availability of billing and authentication applications from service providers. In <lb/>what follows, some of the arguments for mobile IPv6 over mobile IPv4 are described. <lb/>One reported advantage of IPv6 is that it improves timeliness of transmissions, by optimising <lb/>routing. 78 However, there is an associated overhead cost, to make the mobile transmissions secure. 79 The <lb/>alternative option of using IPv4 private space and NATs is considered less efficient and has its own <lb/>overheads, due to cost associated with NAT transversal techniques as well as costlier management <lb/>R &amp; D <lb/>Transition for internal networks <lb/>Capital expenditure <lb/>Transition for provisioning services <lb/>Transition for internal networks <lb/>Lost productivity during transition <lb/>Transition for internal networks <lb/>Lost productivity during transition <lb/>Cost categories <lb/>(Inputs) (Benefits) <lb/>Infrastructure vendors <lb/>Application vendors <lb/>Internet Service <lb/>Providers <lb/>Users <lb/>Supply Chain <lb/>Reduced R &amp; D costs <lb/>Reduced operational expenditures <lb/>Reduced provisioning costs <lb/>Reduced internal IT costs <lb/>Reduced internal IT costs <lb/>New functionality <lb/>Benefits categories <lb/></body>

			<body>resulting from more complex architectures. Another implication of ―always on‖ and NAT is that the <lb/>handset has to send regular ‗keep alive&apos; messages in order to keep its IPv4 address, which drains battery <lb/>capacity. <lb/>Considerations of interoperation with the IPv4 network and the concept of dual-stack support for <lb/>mobility also need to be addressed. 80 The assumption made in many analyses of mobile IP support is that <lb/>interoperation across IPv4 and IPv6 would be through application level gateways. The cost and complexity <lb/>of these gateways needs to be considered because, while servers for Internet applications are on IPv4, they <lb/>require translation. <lb/>In summary, the benefit of IPv6 is that, due to the larger address space in IPv6, public addresses can <lb/>be assigned to mobile nodes, even with very many mobile nodes. In addition, Mobile IPv6 is deemed to <lb/>optimise routing, by offering route optimisation between any-to-any node. Therefore, NATs, which can be <lb/>expensive for mobile devices, are not needed. Considerations of interoperation with the IPv4 network also <lb/>need to be taken into account. Both options carry costs. <lb/>Although there are plans to deploy MIPv6 in the future releases of 3GPP and of WiMAX, there are <lb/>currently no commercial MIPv6 deployments of any significance. <lb/>As a potential indication of interest, many large IPv6 prefix assignments are to telecommunications <lb/>operators. However, the policy basis under which these allocations were made – without incremental cost <lb/>to requesters and without any obligation to demonstrate IPv6 deployed infrastructure – means that <lb/>requesting allocations does not necessarily mean actively planning to deploy IPv6. Some of the IPv6 <lb/>allocations are extremely large, such as the allocations to Telecom Italia, the Korean Education Network, <lb/>Sprint, or Samsung (Table 6). As an illustration of the size of some of these prefixes, the allocation in 2006 <lb/>of a /20 to Telecom Italia represented 268 435 456 (2 28 ) customers, under the assumption of each customer <lb/>receiving a /48 and each customer having up to 2 16 (65 536) local area networks. <lb/>Table 6.

			<body>IPv6 requires careful planning, a thorough review of the network&apos;s architecture and a detailed transition <lb/>plan. <lb/>Dual-stack approach <lb/>In terms of technical strategies, the dual-stack approach implies that all devices (computer, routers, <lb/>cellular phones etc.) can interoperate with IPv4 devices using IPv4 packets, and also interoperate with IPv6 <lb/>devices using IPv6 packets. Since the goal of most networks on the Internet is to maximise their <lb/>connectivity with other networks, most IPv6 implementations today are dual-stack. Experts stress that <lb/>dual-stack support is important for public-facing hosts, across the network, in the routing system, and in <lb/>infrastructure services such as the domain name system, firewalls, security, and management systems, so <lb/>as to enable interoperability. Edge devices (enterprise, net services, consumer etc.), for their part, can be <lb/>dual-stack, IPv6-only, or IPv4, depending on configurations. <lb/>Experts also point out that the dual-stack approach is based on the idea that for as long as there is a <lb/>significant level of IPv4-only networks, services and connections, new deployments will need to provide <lb/>IPv4 access. The value of IPv6-only deployments would be impaired by their limited domain of <lb/>connectivity. This means that in the early phases of IPv6 deployment, the IPv6 component of dual-stack <lb/>hosts and network deployments will be isolated ―islands‖ (Figure 8). Experts also stress that this implies a <lb/>need for support of automated IPv6 tunnelling, in order to connect isolated IPv6 islands. <lb/>Figure 8. Dual-stack example <lb/>Source: Huston, G., &quot; Transition to IPv6 &quot; , August 2007. <lb/>81 <lb/>A significant complication associated with dual-stack is that it assumes that parties, namely the two <lb/>end host devices, have access to both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses. Internet packets need public IPv4 addresses <lb/>in the destination field to be routed in the public IPv4 network, regardless of how many private addresses/ <lb/>NATs are at either end. The paradox is that IPv6 is not likely to be deployed in significant volume before <lb/>the free pool of unallocated IPv4 addresses is depleted. Therefore access to Internet resources may be <lb/>limited for those who do not already have IPv4 addresses, as long as all servers are not widely available <lb/>through IPv6. <lb/>Tunelling and other transition mechanisms <lb/>Tunnelling provides a way for the existing IPv4 routing infrastructure to remain functional, and also <lb/>carry IPv6 traffic. Data is carried through an IPv4 tunnel using a process called encapsulation, in which the <lb/>IPv6 packet is carried inside an IPv4 packet. <lb/>Several other transition mechanisms have been defined, and may be appropriate for some network <lb/>configurations. For example, a mechanism called ―6to4‖ allows IPv6 packets to be transmitted over an <lb/>IPv4 network using automated tunnel support. The mechanism: i) assigns a block of IPv6 address space to <lb/>any host or network that has a global IPv4 address; ii) encapsulates IPv6 packets inside IPv4 packets for <lb/>transmission over an IPv4 network; and iii) routes traffic between 6to4 and IPv6 networks. <lb/></body>

			<body>Box 5. &quot; An Internet Transition Plan &quot; <lb/>There is significant discussion within network operator groups, such as the North American Network Operators &quot; <lb/>Group (NANOG) or the South Asian Network Operators Group (SANOG), as well as within the IETF, about <lb/>transitioning to IPv6. For example, one proposed &quot; Internet transition Plan &quot; presented as an &quot; informational Internet draft &quot; <lb/>of July 2007 states that its goal is &quot; to begin the discussion of Internet-wide transition plans in general &quot; . To this effect, it <lb/>proposes a phased approach to transitioning to IPv6, with i) a preparation phase, until 2008; ii) a transition phase, from <lb/>January 2009 to December 2010 and; iii) a post-transition phase, after January 2011. <lb/>The proposed plan specifies that in the first stage, which began in 2007, service providers should start offering <lb/>IPv6-based Internet service to their Internet customers, via native IPv6 network service or via IPv6 transition <lb/>mechanisms. It further advises that organisations in general arrange for IPv6-based Internet connectivity for any <lb/>Internet-facing servers (e.g. web, email, and domain name servers) and should furthermore progressively provide <lb/>IPv6-based Internet connectivity to internal user communities. Even though other experts believe that such a <lb/>timeframe is too short and that both protocols will have to coexist for many years, the general approach proposed for <lb/>the upcoming transition, is generally considered useful. Each transition plan will differ depending on the type of <lb/>organisation. Some networks may in fact never need to make the transition. <lb/>While other experts believe that such a timeframe may be too fast and that both protocols will have to coexist for <lb/>many years, the general approach proposed, in terms of thinking of the upcoming transition, is considered <lb/>constructive. Some stress the co-ordination difficulties. Moreover, different regions are at different levels of <lb/>development and have differing investment capacity, including for investment in skills building. They point out that <lb/>further dialogue is needed in various forums, industries and inside firms, so as to develop better understanding of the <lb/>form that collective efforts could take. For example, ISPs have stressed the need to develop a common understanding <lb/>of what the basic &quot; IPv6 service &quot; might be, such as, for example, at a basic level, web and email support. <lb/>Source: John Curran, J., &quot; An Internet Transition Plan &quot; , IETF Draft, August 2007. <lb/>82 <lb/>IPv6-related deployment strategies, associated costs and skills <lb/>The cost of IPv6 deployment cannot be evaluated generically, as such costs vary on a case-by-case <lb/>basis according to network needs and business. 83 User cost differences are not directly related to <lb/>organisational size and depend on existing organisational network infrastructure (including servers, routers, <lb/>firewalls, billing systems, and standard and customised software programs); on the type of organisation <lb/>(i.e. some types of services could be interrupted or damaged during a transition); on the future needs of an <lb/>organisation&apos;s network; and on the level of security required during the transition. Furthermore, different <lb/>technologies (e.g. cable, DSL, Ethernet and wireless) involve different IPv6 transition and co-existence <lb/>scenarios. 84 <lb/>In some networks, deploying IPv6 only involves training, configuration, testing and management <lb/>costs, while for others – depending on set-up, goals and strategy – the cost of software and hardware <lb/>upgrades may be significant. Planning the deployment enables each organisation to determine costs and <lb/>select a deployment scenario that enables IPv6 services at the lowest cost possible (Table 7). 85 Hardware <lb/>and software vendors are increasingly integrating IPv6 as a standard feature in products, allowing <lb/>organisations to deploy IPv6 as part of routine upgrade cycles. <lb/>For many organisations, operational costs, including staff training, and staff time to add IPv6 to <lb/>management databases and documentation, are likely to constitute the majority of the cost of upgrading to <lb/>IPv6. Organisations that run in-house customised software will experience additional costs to upgrade <lb/>these programs to IPv6, and enterprises that have test/release processes will see a marginal additional cost <lb/>for IPv6 configuration tests. A widely reported barrier to IPv6 deployment is that of expertise: education, <lb/>training and awareness. There are few network engineers and computer scientists with the knowledge <lb/>needed to set up and manage IPv6 networks. This is deemed to be particularly true for IPv6 security, <lb/>because connectivity during the transition phase will in many cases involve tunnels, which create security <lb/>vulnerabilities. <lb/></body>

Distribution of IPv6-related transition costs to users <lb/>Distribution of Total Transition Costs <lb/>Category Internal Network Costs <lb/>Network management software (upgrade) <lb/>Network testing <lb/>Installation effort <lb/>Maintaining network performance <lb/>Training (sales, marketing, and technical staff) <lb/>18% <lb/>17.6% <lb/>24% <lb/>16% <lb/>24.4% <lb/>The percentages in this table sum to 100 percent, comprising the distribution of all costs for users to move to IPv6. <lb/>Source: RTI International, 2005. <lb/>RTI estimated that the (2005) value of costs for all stakeholder groups to transition to IPv6 in the <lb/>United States would be approximately USD 25 billion, occurring mainly over the 1997 to 2025 period. The <lb/>highest cost year projected was 2007, representing USD 8 billion. 88 RTI also estimated that, in the United <lb/>States, users would incur most of the costs of IPv6 transition (approximately 92%), with ISPs and vendors <lb/>accounting for 0.5 and 8% respectively. <lb/>Content, latency and interconnectedness <lb/>From an end user&apos;s perspective, the key issue with transitioning to IPv6 is likely to be content rather <lb/>than cost. There is currently little Internet content available via IPv6 because transitioning to IPv6 is <lb/>particularly challenging for content providers. Comparatively fewer IPv6 traffic exchange (peering and <lb/>transit) agreements and numerous ―tunnels‖ to carry IPv6 traffic over IPv4 infrastructures often mean IPv6 <lb/>has higher latency than IPv4 (Box 6). Latency represents the amount of time it takes for a packet of data to <lb/>get from one designated point to another. In a dual-stack environment, where both endpoints prefer IPv6 <lb/>to IPv4 if available, IPv6 may appear to be available at both endpoints, without actually providing <lb/>reachability all the way through. Thus, a user may try to browse a website, find an IPv6 address, and try to <lb/>contact the IPv6 version of the site, but then experience a failed or slow connection. Content providers, <lb/>with little demand and potentially downgraded performance (which most users would not realise was due <lb/>to IPv6 traffic paths rather than to the content provider), consider latency to be a major obstacle to making <lb/>their content and services available through IPv6. <lb/></body>

			<body>Box 6. Measuring latency <lb/>Researchers in Portugal have compared latency with IPv4 and IPv6 from the Portuguese NREN to commercial <lb/>sites and to National Research and Education Network (NRENs) in Europe, in Japan, and the United States. <lb/>89 <lb/>Results show that latency with IPv6 is generally higher than with IPv4. Results with Japanese commercial <lb/>services are good, while those with the European Union, US and Russian services are not. Surprisingly, latency can <lb/>actually be improved with IPv6, as in the case of the Irish NREN. <lb/>90 The overall conclusion of the authors &quot; research is <lb/>that global IPv6 deployment is not on track. <lb/>Source: Domingues, M., Friacas, C., &quot; Is Global IPv6 Deployment on Track? &quot; , FCCN, October 2007. <lb/>Internet traffic experts point to the low number of carriers that provide IPv6 peering and transit as a <lb/>reason for latency and other issues. Lack of IPv6 peering agreements and Internet eXchange Points (IXPs) <lb/>supporting IPv6 can increase latency because traffic may have to travel further to reach its destination. <lb/>They deem that the latency issue with IPv6 will disappear once a critical number of service providers have <lb/>enabled native IPv6, as is the case for IPv4. In the meantime, ISPs and businesses that negotiate peering <lb/>and transit agreements should explicitly provide support for IPv6 traffic. There have been suggestions that <lb/>public policy makers could look into subsidising IPv6 support in IXPs. <lb/>Several content providers seem to have provisioned IPv6 address space, which may signal change. <lb/>For example, Google has started IPv6 deployment (see Section V. Case studies of deploying IPv6: Google) <lb/>and Microsoft and Cisco Systems also each have a /32, as does Speakeasy, an ISP in the United States. <lb/>YouTube has a /48 provider-independent IPv6 network assignment from ARIN, as does Tellme Networks, <lb/>a provider of voice services that has recently been acquired by Microsoft. Another entity with an IPv6 <lb/>assignment is Collab Network, which produces leading open source development collaboration software, <lb/>enabling over 2 million geographically dispersed developers to work together on a project. <lb/>CAIDA, an association that provides tools and analyses promoting the engineering and maintenance <lb/>of a robust, scalable global Internet infrastructure, has produced Internet topology maps comparing the use <lb/>of IPv4 and IPv6 around the world (Figure 9). The visual representation comparing IPv4 and IPv6 is <lb/>telling. The observations of IPv6 connectivity between networks (autonomous systems or &quot;ASes&quot;) are <lb/>much sparser than the IPv4 AS graph: fewer nodes and less peering richness were observed. Geographical <lb/>patterns of the graphs also differ. For IPv4, the service providers with most observable connectivity are in <lb/>the United States. In contrast, the operators with the richest observed IPv6 peering are NTT, headquartered <lb/>in Japan, and Tiscali, headquartered in Italy. The largest cluster of high degree IPv6 AS nodes is in Europe. <lb/>The observation that Japan and Europe have the highest degree of peering in IPv6 is consistent with <lb/>the registry allocations of IPv6 prefixes in these regions. It warrants noting that a relatively small number <lb/>of Tier 1 providers are present in both the IPv4 and IPv6 topology maps: NTT, Global Crossing, Cable &amp; <lb/>Wireless, Tiscali, Sprint, Teleglobe and Asia Netcom. <lb/>DSTI/ICCP(2007)20/FINAL <lb/></body>

IPv4/IPv6 Internet topology maps – AS-level internet graph <lb/>Source: CAIDA, observed January 2008. <lb/>Scalability of the global routing tables <lb/>Enterprises have stressed that a primary reason they were not investing in IPv6 deployment was <lb/>dissatisfaction with the way IPv6 supports ―provider independent‖ or ―multi-homed‖ users, i.e. users with <lb/>redundant interconnection and traffic exchange with two or more independent networks. Multi-homed <lb/>users add entries corresponding to their routes to the global routing tables, which increases the size of the <lb/>tables. Therefore some fear that IPv6 could exacerbate a pre-existing global routing table issue by virtue of <lb/>its much larger address space, which in turn allows for a much larger scope of deployed networks, with the <lb/>potential to reflect this in the size of the routing system. Simply put, the total number of routes on the <lb/>Internet needs to be managed so as not to exceed the capabilities of existing equipment (i.e. backbone <lb/>routers). 91 Technical solutions for site multihoming with IPv6 and their adoption as standards by the IETF <lb/>are viewed as very important for IPv6 adoption. <lb/>Generally speaking, scalability of the routing system is seen as a major issue for the future of the <lb/>Internet. Addressing and routing on the Internet are interdependent and there are significant economic <lb/>considerations in devising solutions to scalable routing systems. One reason for growth in the routing table <lb/>is a misalignment of economic incentives and outcomes: adding new entries or failing to aggregate existing <lb/>routes may be economic or convenient for a single network operator but the cost of new entries or <lb/>expansion in the routing table, however, is borne by everyone in the global routing system. 92 The issue is <lb/>seen as a very high priority for the Internet in the medium-term, with further examination and discussion <lb/>warranted in both the technical and economic realms. 93 <lb/>IPv4 <lb/>IPv6 <lb/></body>

			<body>IV. ECONOMIC AND PUBLIC POLICY CONSIDERATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS <lb/>PUBLIC POLICY CONSIDERATIONS <lb/>Important public policy issues are associated with the smooth transition of the Internet to IPv6. These <lb/>relate in part to a belief by some experts that the current IPv4-based Internet will be unable to scale to <lb/>create opportunities for new connections and new services. The Internet is expected to help address <lb/>challenges in areas that range from enabling new innovative services to interconnecting new types of <lb/>wireless devices to support a range of economic and social objectives. <lb/>Likely scenarios, sustainability and economic growth <lb/>Governments have a special role to play in helping the transition towards IPv6 (Annex 1 presents the <lb/>role of different stakeholders in the transition to IPv6 and Annex 2 provides an overview of governmental <lb/>initiatives to-date). According to original plans of the Internet community, the transition of the Internet to <lb/>IPv6 should have been much more advanced before the depletion of IPv4 addresses. Instead, in most <lb/>countries and most companies, the transition is either just beginning, or there is still no visible activity in <lb/>this area. <lb/>The three options available to networks that are growing after the depletion of previously unallocated <lb/>IPv4 address space are i) denser deployment of NAT, ii) obtaining and deploying additional IPv4 <lb/>infrastructure if actors gain access to previously allocated addresses, and: iii) IPv6 deployment (Table 9). <lb/>These scenarios are not exclusive and it is likely that all three will be pursued by various actors as the <lb/>depletion of previously unallocated addresses with affect actors differently (Annex 6). Experts deem that in <lb/>the short term, denser NAT deployment is an inevitable response to the looming IPv4 address depletion. <lb/>They also point out that as available resources diminish, actors are likely to become more efficient in the <lb/>use of IPv4, particularly when there is a cost associated with obtaining address space. Therefore, operators <lb/>may tend to reduce their use of public address space, most likely by making use of private address space <lb/>and NAT in IPv4 and concurrent IPv6 (particularly for non-public infrastructure) wherever possible. 94 <lb/>Denser NAT deployment means the associated deployment of multi-party application architectures that <lb/>perform more complex operations in order to set up applications. 95 If NAT is deployed without concurrent <lb/>deployment of IPv6, severe restrictions on the scalability of the Internet would appear. <lb/>It is likely that all network administrators will eventually be faced with the task of creating a plan to <lb/>migrate from IPv4 to IPv6. The time at which this is done and the current infrastructure will have a <lb/>significant impact on how migrations are carried out. Early adopters will require different tools and <lb/>approaches than late adopters since they will have a greater need to interoperate with IPv4 networks on a <lb/>large scale. Late adopters, for their part, may have the ability to more directly implement a native IPv6 <lb/>infrastructure. However, experts agree that if adoption is left to the latest possible moment, this would <lb/>create pressure for hurried and potentially unstable deployment of IPv6. <lb/>A number of factors – amount of IPv4 address space, speed of deployment, service offerings, and <lb/>application support – will determine which transition tools are used. 96 Organisations with a large number of <lb/>public IPv4 addresses will be able to use a dual-stack approach, while those with fewer addresses will need <lb/>to use mechanisms for an IPv6-only internal infrastructure. 97 For organisations looking to perform testing <lb/>and migrate to IPv6 only gradually, tunnelling systems may be the most appropriate mechanism. 98 <lb/></body>

			<body>Organisations whose ISP offers native-IPv6 connectivity can use a number of tools while others will have <lb/>limited options. 99 In all cases, future transition to IPv6 should be planned in today&apos;s network infrastructure <lb/>and application design. <lb/>Table 9.

For network operators and other entities that rely on Internet <lb/></body>

			<page>42 <lb/></page>

			<body>numbering allocations, it will become increasingly difficult and expensive to obtain new IPv4 address <lb/>space to expand their networks. A situation with anticipated scarcity of IPv4 addresses raises competition <lb/>concerns in terms of barriers to new entry and strengthening incumbent positions. From a business <lb/>standpoint, new or existing Internet users who need IPv4 addresses are likely to have to use private <lb/>addresses with several levels of translation (NAT) and still need some quantity of public IPv4 addresses. <lb/>Care must be exercised that the IPv6 transition and co-existence between IPv4 and IPv6 safeguard <lb/>competition and a level playing field and do not lock in dominant positions. <lb/>As the Internet progressively becomes a dual IPv4/IPv6 network, some experts deem that ensuring <lb/>IPv6 support will be critical for retaining universal Internet connectivity. As the difficulty of obtaining <lb/>IPv4 address space increases, they believe it is inevitable that some sites will only support IPv6. IPv6, <lb/>therefore, will be required to ensure global connectivity. Experts stress the importance of adopting policies <lb/>that will encourage IPv6 connectivity (peering and transit) among all Internet service providers. 100 <lb/>Security <lb/>Security is an important public policy objective. Maintaining network security will continue to be a <lb/>challenging undertaking in both IPv4 and IPv6 contexts. In relation to IPv4 and IPv6, the following points <lb/>should be highlighted: <lb/> Legal intercept and identification are easier with IPv6 in the absence of NATs and in particular, <lb/>several layers of NATs. 101 <lb/> Because a number of new operating systems use IPv6 as a default, IPv6-enabled devices are <lb/>likely to increasingly find their way into commercial and governmental networks, creating <lb/>security vulnerabilities in the absence of adequate training. <lb/> Debates concerning IPv4 versus IPv6 security often focus on different aspects of network <lb/>deployment. The IPsec protocol suite works generally the same way in both IPv4 and IPv6. <lb/>While IPv6 potentially facilitates deployment of end-to-end security, in practice, NATs will <lb/>continue to be deployed. <lb/> Because the IPv6 protocol is different from IPv4, it creates opportunities for new types of attacks. <lb/>IPv6 products being comparatively new, they have not benefited from the recurring cycle of <lb/>discovering and fixing security vulnerabilities and other bugs yet. <lb/> In addition, the dual-stack IPv4 and IPv6 environment will require the development of new <lb/>operational practices. <lb/>REQUIRED FOCUS OF PUBLIC POLICY EFFORTS <lb/>Planning for IPv6 compatible government services, and skills <lb/>Governments have an important role to play as a major consumer of IP-related products and services. <lb/>As all other stakeholders, governments need continued addresses to support growth in scale and scope of <lb/>the public services that they provide on line and to support the evolution of their internal networks. They <lb/>therefore have a strategic need to consider adopting IPv6 to accommodate future growth in the services <lb/>they offer and their operations. Japan, Korea, the United States and China are transitioning their e-<lb/>government networks and services (See section III. Drivers and challenges of IPv6 deployment: Public <lb/>procurement mandates). Australia and several European countries are also launching public sector <lb/>transition plans. The main reasons for which Australia is planning for IPv6-compatible government <lb/>services, and which are generally applicable to all governments, are summarised below (Box 7). <lb/></body>

			<page>43 <lb/></page>

			<body>Beyond building IPv6 skills and applications within governmental bodies, public procurement <lb/>mandates also lead to a virtuous cycle of adoption by instigating the development of skills within <lb/>technology partners. Expertise takes significant time to develop and the current expertise in IPv6 of <lb/>network engineers is deemed to be insufficient to meet the needs of the transition to IPv6 in many <lb/>countries. Policies aimed at ensuring a sufficient skills base exists, for the implementation of IPv6, are <lb/>critical. <lb/>Box 7. Why plan for the transition to IPv6 now? <lb/>There are several reasons for starting the planning process and thereby not leaving it until industry and other <lb/>external pressures build and introduce additional risks and costs. <lb/>1. The risk that unplanned and uncontrolled implementation of IPv6 equipment into government networks could <lb/>result in failures and loss of service delivery capability. <lb/>2. The risk that the skills shortage in the ICT arena and in particular, the IPv6 field becomes so great that the <lb/>government will not be able to compete with the private sector for IPv6 skilled technical and administrative staff. <lb/>3. The opportunities for increased service delivery, particularly in the health, environment and transport <lb/>industries, that IPv6 will allow with its ability to have multiple sensor/tracking devices in a variety of fields. <lb/>4. The fact that many other countries, including the United States, Japan, Korea, Australia and many European <lb/>nations are all moving down this path. <lb/>5. The risk that the cost of moving to IPv6 when industry and suppliers are driving the market will be significantly <lb/>greater than if the planning and transition stages are undertaken in an environment of controlled progress. <lb/>Source: Adapted from A Strategy for the Transition to IPv6 for Australian Government agencies, &quot; Building Capacity for <lb/>Future Innovation &quot; , AGIMO, October 2007. 102 <lb/>Governments should pro-actively take initiatives to address skills shortages with IPv6 training efforts <lb/>in university-level education cycles as well as ensuring lifelong education opportunities, i.e. include IPv6 <lb/>in computer networking, software design, or security programs for the following reasons: i) countries&apos; and <lb/>companies&apos; experience and knowledge of IPv6 are likely to become competitive assets in realising <lb/>continued growth of the social and economic benefits enabled by the Internet since existence of IPv6 <lb/>expertise among computer scientists and networking engineers is key to successful transitions; ii) the open <lb/>market faces explicit training costs in the absence of graduates trained in IPv6. Many companies, such as <lb/>Comcast or NTT Communications, have identified lack of IPv6 skills as a major challenge; and iii) IPv6 <lb/>expertise pools will provide employment opportunities. <lb/>Awareness raising <lb/>Taking part in building awareness and helping to minimise potential barriers is an important role for <lb/>governments, to complement current initiatives by private sector actors. Awareness raising of the <lb/>upcoming issue has begun in all technical numbering fora, in many technical standardisation groups as <lb/>well as within network operator groups. Significantly scaled-up efforts are needed to ensure that all those <lb/>who depend on IP addresses, starting with Local Internet Registries, are well aware of the upcoming <lb/>exhaustion of previously unallocated IPv4 addresses, its timeframe and its likely impacts. While a number <lb/>of resources exist to provide information to network managers, more resources should be broad, user-<lb/>friendly and comprehensive, such that they can be understood by stakeholders of the Internet economy at <lb/>large: from governments through business decision makers through to more technical or operational <lb/>audiences. <lb/>Government initiatives to increase awareness and prioritisation of IPv6 have included, for example, <lb/>public statements and integrating IPv6 into strategic plans for the development of networks in their <lb/>countries. Some countries have created agencies with the mission to promote IPv6 and facilitate its <lb/>adoption by diffusing knowledge. Those agencies actively liaise with private sector parties so as to share <lb/></body>

			<body>experience and good practice, help to increase awareness of the issues and of the potential of IPv6, as well <lb/>as liaise with industry on developments in the IPv6 commercial arena. <lb/>Monitoring progress <lb/>Countries and organisations should track their progress in the transition from IPv4 to IPv6. Such <lb/>monitoring will enable the compilation of case-studies along with ―lessons learned‖ to assist in transition <lb/>education and best practices development. In addition, monitoring will enable comparative analyses to be <lb/>carried out over time with respect to the economic drivers for the transition and to its economic impact. <lb/>Box 8. Summary of key economic considerations related to IPv6 implementation and development <lb/>ECONOMIC CONSIDERATIONS FROM INDIVIDUAL ORGANISATIONS&apos; PERSPECTIVES: <lb/>● Business continuity and necessary time of transition: because implementing IPv6 takes time, planning IP <lb/>addressing needs over the next few years can enable organisations to devise and implement optimal strategies to <lb/>ensure continued growth and operations after IPv4 address exhaustion. <lb/>● Cost: Ipv6 implementation costs vary significantly in function of requirements and deployment plan (e.g. internal <lb/>versus external, peering, transit, DNS, provision to the desktop, web services, hosted services etc.). Experts deem that <lb/>in the medium or long term, IPv6 can potentially reduce operational expenditure for network administration. However, <lb/>in the early stages IPv6 implementation is likely to increase capital and operational expenditures, due to: <lb/>• Internal training and skills upgrading. <lb/> • Costs of running dual-stack interoperability; and <lb/> • Potential lack of vendor and back-office tool support, increased hardware costs or upstream transit.<lb/>● Initial presence of negative externalities: Initially, economic actors bearing the cost of NAT may not be those who <lb/>need to invest in IPv6 deployment. With time, such negative externalities should give way to (positive) network effects <lb/>for those who invested, as increasing numbers of economic actors implement IPv6 and an adoption &quot; tipping point &quot; <lb/>takes place. <lb/>● Universal Internet connectivity: IPv6 is projected to become critical for retaining universal Internet connectivity, <lb/>which is in the interest of many organizations. <lb/>● Scalability and demand for IP addresses: IPv6 can provide the necessary scalability for growth of organisations, <lb/>e.g. for mobile providers to offer always-on Internet access via mobile devices, or for service providers to benefit from <lb/>more IP numbers to offer triple play services. <lb/>● Innovative applications and services: IPv6 enables new services which cannot be implemented with IPv4, e.g. <lb/>remotely accessible sensor network applications / machine-to-machine communications. <lb/>● Competitive advantage: operational experience with IPv6 is likely to be a competitive advantage in some <lb/>industries. <lb/>____________________________________________ <lb/>ECONOMIC CONSIDERATIONS FROM A PUBLIC POLICY PERSPECTIVE <lb/>● Platform for innovation: IPv6 provides a platform for innovation in Internet-based products and services, in <lb/>particular to meet medium and long-term requirements of an increasingly mobile, wireless and ubiquitous Internet. <lb/>● Growth and competition: IPv6 is necessary to foster an environment capable of sustaining long-term growth of the <lb/>Internet economy and competition across existing players and new entrants. <lb/>● Competitive advantage: IPv6 expertise is likely to be key for economies to remain competitive in the production of <lb/>technology products and services. <lb/></body>

			<body>V. CASE STUDIES OF DEPLOYING IPV6 <lb/>This section of the report aims to show the rationale for a few selected IPv6 implementations. In what <lb/>follows, case studies for Comcast, Bechtel Corporation, NTT Communications and Google are considered. <lb/>A further source of information beyond the case studies below is the IPv6 Forum. The IPv6 Forum has <lb/>actively promoted IPv6 since 1999: with chapters in 46 countries, it has conducted numerous case studies <lb/>of IPv6 implementations. 103 <lb/>Several important lessons were highlighted independently by these four different organisations: <lb/>planning ahead is viewed as the single most important factor in transitioning to IPv6. Challenges to <lb/>transition were considered as reasonable, and costs were mainly those of labour and of training staff to <lb/>develop expertise. For both NTT and Comcast, two large Internet service providers, a major benefit of <lb/>IPv6 adoption is considered to be the decreased complexity of their networks and associated reduction of <lb/>support costs. In all four cases, IPv6 is enabling these firms to plan new services and applications that draw <lb/>on the possibility to have a locally or globally routable Internet address for any device. <lb/>Comcast <lb/>Comcast was founded in 1963, as a cable television operator, and is today the largest cable <lb/>communications operator in the United States, with operations in 23 States. The growth of Comcast&apos;s <lb/>customer and service base illustrates how an organisation can be constrained by insufficient IPv4 address <lb/>space. <lb/>Comcast remotely manages and operates its private network, i.e. the cable modems, set-top boxes and <lb/>voice adaptors of all its customers, with IP technology. All Comcast customer devices are identified and <lb/>managed with one or more IP address. The largest block of IPv4 addresses reserved for private networks <lb/>provides 16.7 million addresses theoretically. 104 Comcast was using private IPv4 space to manage the cable <lb/>modems but realised in 2005 that, with new customers subscribing to its services, it was going to run out of <lb/>private space. <lb/>Simple projections showed Comcast that the quantity of IP addresses that it would need in order to <lb/>support its future growth in terms of subscriber base, as well as to be able to leverage potential new <lb/>services, exceeded available address space. In fact, estimations were that within a few years, Comcast <lb/>would have some 20 million video customers, an average of 2.5 set-top boxes per customer, and 2 IP <lb/>addresses per box. This would mean that the company would be in need of some 100 million IP addresses <lb/>at a minimum. <lb/>Reviewing its potential options, Comcast concluded that IPv6 was the best solution to facilitate its <lb/>management of a growing network to ensure business continuity. In addition, the company considered that <lb/>it would potentially be able to leverage IPv6 in its service offerings, such as its ―triple play services‖ <lb/>(Table 10), that it foresaw might grow to require several hundreds of millions of addresses. <lb/></body>

To this end, dual-stack was incrementally implemented in the core <lb/>networks: i) in the backbone (2006); ii) in the converged regional area network (2007) and; iii) in the cable <lb/>modem termination system used to provide high speed data services. Challenges encountered by Comcast <lb/>included the limited availability of IPv6 cable modems, IPv6 home gateways, video, and voice systems on <lb/>the consumer electronic retail market. Adapting back office systems – the provisioning and monitoring <lb/>systems that would have to communicate with potentially IPv6-only systems – proved to be particularly <lb/>challenging. <lb/>A noteworthy aspect of the strategy is that of starting IPv6 deployment from the dual-stack core and <lb/>deploying IPv6 step-by-step towards edge devices. By including IPv6 in its roadmap for new generation <lb/>equipment and devices, Comcast greatly minimised transition costs. It then tested offering new services to <lb/>its customers based on IPv6. Newly installed customer devices are planned to be IPv6-only, since <lb/>managing dual-stack end user devices would be expensive and defeat the purpose: the edge of the network <lb/>is where Comcast may have potentially several millions of devices to manage and therefore where IP <lb/>addresses are needed. Dual stack for millions of devices would be complex to manage and to support, and <lb/>prohibitively expensive: it would need to involve IPv6 addresses, IPv4 addresses, network address <lb/>translators and various gateways etc. Comcast&apos;s strategy to deploy native IPv6 where possible and to <lb/>update only those IPv4 systems that manipulate or interact with IPv6 data is pictured in Figure 10. <lb/>Figure 10. <lb/>Comcast&apos;s deployment strategy <lb/>Backbone <lb/>Regional Network s <lb/>System s <lb/>Cable modem <lb/>termination system s <lb/>CM <lb/>PC <lb/>CM <lb/>STB <lb/>CM <lb/>PC <lb/>CM <lb/>STB <lb/>CM <lb/>PC <lb/>CM <lb/>STB <lb/>CM <lb/>PC <lb/>CM <lb/>STB <lb/>LEGACY <lb/>NEW <lb/>NEW <lb/>IPv6 <lb/>IPv4 <lb/>2005 <lb/>2006 <lb/>2007 <lb/>Source: Based on Comcast presentation at Nanog 37. <lb/>Training is a critical part of deploying IPv6. Internally, the company focused on diffusing IPv6 <lb/>knowledge widely among its staff and at various technical levels. While the cost, operationally, of <lb/>renumbering all the modems was high, it was inevitable with any of the options the company could have <lb/>chosen. Knowledge was that with IPv6, renumbering would be needed only once and be able to scale to <lb/>accommodate growth needs in the foreseeable future. Key lessons learned are summarised in Table 11. <lb/></body>

			<body>While Comcast is the first known case of a service provider having run out of private address space, <lb/>similar situations are likely to occur with other service providers in the near future. Other very large cable <lb/>operators are already starting to investigate various options and their implications. The primary lesson from <lb/>Comcast&apos;s transition to IPv6 is the importance of planning ahead. For Comcast, limited scale deployment <lb/>will have taken some four years. The costs were not major, because deployment was gradual. <lb/>Table 11. Lessons learned <lb/>TO DO <lb/>TO AVOID <lb/> <lb/>Plan deployment carefully <lb/> <lb/>Use IPv6 only where required <lb/> <lb/>Conduct extensive training on IPv6 <lb/> <lb/>Focus on the application layer rather than on the network layer <lb/> <lb/>Include IPv6 in the roadmap of equipment life cycle <lb/> <lb/>Deploy IPv6-only at the edges, where a dual-stack environment is non <lb/>practicable for millions of devices, due to lack of IPv4 address space <lb/> Dual stack deployment <lb/>everywhere <lb/> Wait and rush <lb/>Source: Based on IPv6 Forum case study. <lb/>Another take-away message from the Comcast case is that beyond what the company has already <lb/>implemented, it is now able to plan for new services to offer home networks. Comcast expects that these <lb/>home networks will require smart gateways with features and services equipped to handle numerous IP <lb/>devices, multiple types of links with varying characteristics (wired/wireless, different speeds, multi-cast <lb/>support), as well as additional services such as home automation, network storage or video <lb/>communications. <lb/>NTT Communications <lb/>NTT Communications began offering IPv6 Internet service in April 2001, leading the world in the <lb/>provision of commercial IPv6 Internet connection services, both to enterprises and home users. 106 One of <lb/>the largest ISPs in Japan, NTT Communications, provides several commercial IPv6 services. The company <lb/>has been operating a worldwide native commercial IPv6 backbone along with an IPv6-over-IPv4 tunnel <lb/>connection service since 2001 (Figure 11). <lb/>Figure 11. <lb/>NTT Global IPv6 backbone and services <lb/>Source: NTT Communications. <lb/>Dual stack (IPv4 and IPv6) ADSL services have been offered since 2002. In addition, NTT Com has <lb/>operated a dual-stack IPv6/IPv4 backbone connection since 2004. Since 2005, NTT Com has provided <lb/>dual-stack Ethernet access (e.g. for fibre) for enterprise users. And NTT Com&apos;s 5 million residential <lb/>subscribers can easily turn on IPv6 tunnel access to remotely access and control electric appliances <lb/>connected to their home network (Figure 12). 107 <lb/></body>

			<body>Applications in private IPv6 networks are where the company is seeing strong growth, compared to <lb/>access to the IPv6 Internet. 108 The company says that from the time it began offering IPv6 services, users <lb/>have benefited from business opportunities in using it and that IPv6 services are now profitable to the <lb/>company. <lb/>Figure 12. <lb/>NTT Home Network ( &quot; OCN IPv6 &quot; ) <lb/>Source: Asia Pacific IPv6Summit 2007, How and Why have millions of households been already IPv6 ready? <lb/>109 <lb/>An NTT subsidiary, NTT West, started offering IPv6 Internet Access service in 2005. The service <lb/>includes an IPv6 service network, which is a private multicast-enabled network and services nearly two <lb/>million customers. An observer reports that customers are generally not even aware of the fact that they are <lb/>using IPv6. 110 The major reasons cited by NTT West for deploying IPv6 include ease of manageability, <lb/>business continuity, as well as the multicast functionalities of IPv6 that NTT needed to provide video <lb/>streaming services. <lb/>Multicast functionality – which allows for one data stream to be sent to multiple recipients, as <lb/>opposed to unicast where there is one stream per recipient – is also used by NTT for new applications. An <lb/>innovative service that NTT offers is its ―Earthquake Flash Report System‖. The system reports in real <lb/>time on the intensity of an earthquake and on the exact time it will take to reach a specific location, thanks <lb/>to over 1 000 sensors spread out through the countryside, all connected via IPv6. 111 When the sensors <lb/>detect an earthquake, they transmit the data to both government agencies and commercial utilities so <lb/>appropriate action can be taken. Preventive steps can be taken in the 10 to 15 seconds before the second <lb/>real earthquake wave hits people, buildings and the city/community infrastructure. This system can be <lb/>developed to send a flash TV emergency news, initiate automated fire-suppression systems, to <lb/>automatically stop elevators, close natural gas and petroleum pipeline valves, etc. <lb/>Bechtel Corporation <lb/>Bechtel Corporation is a large global engineering, construction, and project management company <lb/>that was an early adopter of IPv6. Bechtel&apos;s pace of adoption was influenced by several drivers. First <lb/>among these were the 2003 mandate of the US Department of Defense (DoD) and 2005 mandate by the <lb/>United States Office of Management and Budget (OMB) which required department-wide deployment of <lb/>IPv6 by 2008. Requests for proposals from the US Army and other customers started to explicitly require <lb/>IPv6 products and services. 112 Another driver was that IPv6 is the default in current Windows Vista and <lb/>emerging Windows Server 2008 Microsoft operating systems that are deployed in Bechtel. 113 Additionally, <lb/>Bechtel views IPv6 as a significant foundation for future innovation. Bechtel is exploring opportunities to <lb/>capitalise on IPv6 features to improve its project execution and operational efficiencies over time. The last <lb/>driver is the broad adoption of IPv6 in industry standards as a required part of emerging products and <lb/>services, for example in the standards DOCSIS 3.0 and IMS (IP Multimedia Subsystem). <lb/>In 2004, Bechtel launched a phased, enterprise-wide deployment of IPv6 spanning over eight years <lb/>that was designed to develop broad awareness and competence in the new protocol across the firm. The <lb/></body>

			<body>approach has yielded growing implementations of production IPv6 services across the enterprise. The <lb/>company started its deployment by sending dozens of network engineers to in-depth IPv6 training courses <lb/>and created IPv6 labs that interconnected them across the Internet. Bechtel then started to integrate IPv6 <lb/>into the company&apos;s existing product and service lifecycle processes, paying particular attention to turnover <lb/>packages and verification processes as applications and infrastructure components moved from <lb/>development through quality assurance and into production. The environment and building templates have <lb/>been instrumented to provide deployment metrics and consistent IPv6 deployment look and feel. Most of <lb/>the applications were not affected by adding IPv6 to the existing IPv4 network. However, the company felt <lb/>that many of the carriers it solicited in the United States lagged in terms of offering adequate enterprise <lb/>IPv6 communications transport to the premise. <lb/>By the end of 2006, Bechtel had enabled IPv6 on its production networks and on hundreds of <lb/>computers at four of its primary sites, and created a scalable model for future deployments. The company <lb/>trained all its application developers to be able to configure machines for IPv6. Bechtel has included IPv6 <lb/>compatibility in its regular application-development and quality-assurance processes. By the end of 2007, <lb/>Bechtel expects that over 80% of its 18 000 company-managed computers and 50% of its routers and <lb/>switches will be running in a dual-stack (IPv4/IPv6) mode. All major offices are already running IPv6 on <lb/>most computers and all local area network (LAN) and wide area network (WAN) connections (Figure 13). <lb/>Figure 13. <lb/>Project highlights (March 2006) <lb/>Source: IPv6 Transition at Bechtel, presented by Fred Wettling, February 2007. <lb/>114 <lb/>Bechtel is interested in a range of applications using IPv6 for projects on different types of <lb/>construction activities – mines, treatment plants, or power plants – across the world. The company hopes to <lb/>leverage IPv6 peer discovery and peer-to-peer communications to enable the rapid deployment of project <lb/>IT infrastructure as well as ad hoc collaboration with its partners in projects. The mobility features of IPv6 <lb/>enable wireless routers in trailers at project sites to set-up ―self-configuring/self-healing‖ networks with <lb/>secure voice, data, and video. <lb/>Bechtel also sees future utility in using distributed environmental sensors to provide weather <lb/>monitoring, such as on bridges, in high buildings, on large cranes, etc. In the area of communications in the <lb/>field, the company wants to enable communications between employees through point-to-point and <lb/>broadcast features of IPv6. Being able to track construction workers on sites for security reasons, by <lb/>adding Global Positioning System (GPS) and Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) to its mobile IPv6, is <lb/>also on the list of applications for Bechtel to deploy. <lb/></body>

			<body>Google <lb/>Google provides search technologies used by millions of people every day to query online <lb/>information – Web, Usenet, images, and other types of content such as videos. Google&apos;s business model <lb/>relies on targeted advertising. <lb/>There are several drivers for the company to implement IPv6. Many individual engineers at Google <lb/>felt that it was important for the future of the Internet and for the company to be a leader in the area. <lb/>Originally a project undertaken in staff&apos;s free time, IPv6 deployment is becoming an official project. <lb/>Another reason cited included the US Department of Defense and Office of Management and Budget <lb/>mandates: Google wants to be able to crawl public sector IPv6 content once federal agencies are using <lb/>IPv6. Google also anticipates the adoption of IPv6 in countries such as China or Japan. A last driver for the <lb/>deployment of IPv6 is the company&apos;s own growth and the considerable efforts required to efficiently <lb/>manage IPv4 address space while constantly adding new offices and data centers. <lb/>Google started to consult vendors in 2004 and received a ―/32‖ IPv6 delegation from ARIN in 2005. <lb/>Google then started to build out its IPv6 peering. Within the Internet technical community, Google was <lb/>issued a challenge by the Chair of the IETF&apos;s IPv6 Working Group that it would have working IPv6 search <lb/>functionality by November 2008, at the IETF&apos;s 73 rd meeting. <lb/>There are three facets to Google&apos;s IPv6 deployment: <lb/>1. Production networking infrastructure i.e. peering and transit, whereby IPv6 is stretched to each <lb/>data centre. <lb/>2. Corporate deployment, for all Google&apos;s internal networks and staff to be using IPv6; and <lb/>3. Deploying IPv6 in Google&apos;s software and services including gmail, search, or Google maps in <lb/>production quality. <lb/>As a top web property, Google is extremely sensitive to latency, i.e. the amount of time it takes a <lb/>packet to travel from source to destination. The lower the latency, the quicker a web page loads, so that <lb/>Google puts intensive effort into measuring and improving latency. Large numbers of servers and data <lb/>centers around the world provide redundancy and reduce latency to each user by ensuring that the <lb/>requested data is always online. If an end user&apos;s operating system – Windows Vista for example – defaults <lb/>to IPv6, delays and problems in loading web pages are more likely than with IPv4 because of IPv6&apos;s <lb/>incomplete connectivity. <lb/>To ensure that service over IPv4 is not affected, Google is likely to use a separate domain name for its <lb/>IPv6 service, which is not attractive from a branding perspective but ensures complete separation from <lb/>IPv4-only service. Since IPv6 infrastructure must be built so that it does not affect any IPv4 traffic, <lb/>separate routers and separate bandwidth are needed in some cases and some capital outlay is required. <lb/>Another challenge for Google is that in its search for minimal latency, it has been implementing very <lb/>fast IPv4 Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASIC) chips but few vendors offer similar performance <lb/>in their IPv6 hardware offering yet. <lb/>Significant investments in time are needed to adapt/recode all the tools that measure IPv4 <lb/>performance so that they can also measure IPv6 performance. A large portion of the infrastructure and of <lb/>the computer code can be reused but most of the transition work lies in experimentation (creating, <lb/>measuring etc.) and Google is developing an extensive IPv6 compliance and testing suite and monitoring <lb/>tools, including IPv6 traffic monitoring, a latency map of IPv6 traffic, and tracking IPv6 adoption in web <lb/>servers over time. <lb/></body>

			<body>ANNEXES <lb/>ANNEX 1: OVERVIEW OF GOVERNMENTAL INITIATIVES TO-DATE <lb/>Japan <lb/>WIDE, (Widely Integrated Distributed Environment) established in 1988 is a joint industry, <lb/>government and academia research consortium that promotes the research and development of Internet <lb/>technologies. Represented by Jun Murai, Vice President of Keio University and Professor of the Faculty of <lb/>Environmental Information, over 100 corporations and 40 universities are currently involved in the WIDE <lb/>Project. They partake in a diverse array of research and development activities concerning next generation <lb/>Internet technologies. <lb/>In 2000 Japan&apos;s Prime Minister told Parliament that IPv6 was to be the core of future deployment of <lb/>the Internet in the country. In January 2001, Japan was the first country to put forth a national strategy for <lb/>the adoption of IPv6, e-Japan. 115 It consisted of support for academic research through the WIDE project, <lb/>development of new applications, as well as tax incentives between 2001 and 2003 for organisations that <lb/>deploy IPv6. Japan&apos;s investment in IPv6 is estimated at between USD 10 to USD 13 million a year. To-<lb/>date, Japan is the leading country in IPv6 expertise and has the largest commercial deployments of IPv6. 116 <lb/>Japan&apos;s strategy has largely been supply-driven. <lb/>The Japanese government has supported the establishment of an IPv6 Promotion Council in Japan to <lb/>facilitate the resolution of issues related to development and deployment and has provided tax incentives to <lb/>promote deployment. In parallel, major Japanese corporations in the communications and consumer <lb/>electronics sectors are developing IPv6 networks and products. Many commercial IPv6 offerings exist in <lb/>Japan. 117 <lb/>In Japan&apos;s ―New IT Reform Strategy‖ that was released in January 2006, a time frame to become <lb/>IPv6-ready was set, ―as information and communications hardware is updated and replaced in the future, <lb/>new equipment will as a general rule be IPv6 compatible by 2008.‖ Each ministry and government agency <lb/>continues its efforts to become IPv6-ready. 118 <lb/>In August 2007, the Japanese MIC announced in that it was convening a study group on Internet&apos;s <lb/>smooth transition to IPv6 in order to study measures to facilitate the transition of domestic Internet <lb/>networks to IPv6 from a technical perspective. 119 <lb/>Europe and the European Commission <lb/>European technology experts have been involved in the definition and development of IPv6 since the <lb/>beginning. A RIPE WG in this area has been active since April 1994. 120 The European Commission <lb/>initiated a task force in April 2001 to design an IPv6 Roadmap. The Roadmap was to serve as an update <lb/></body>

			<page>54 <lb/></page>

			<body>and plan of action for the development and future perspectives of IPv6. It was also to serve as a way to co-<lb/>ordinate European efforts for developing, testing, and deploying IPv6. <lb/>In 2002, the European Commission issued a Communication from the Commission to the Council and <lb/>the European Parliament on the ―Next Generation Internet – priorities for action in migrating to the new <lb/>Internet protocol IPv6‖ 121 stating that ―a strategic concerted effort is … required that will enable the <lb/>competitiveness of the European industry to be strengthened‖. 122 The Commission is currently examining <lb/>ways to accelerate roll-out, possibly through procurement, policy and research activities, and dissemination <lb/>efforts. <lb/>The European Commission (EC) dedicated some USD 216 million to several research projects <lb/>(6NET, GEANT, Euro6IX, 6INIT) with the goal of instigating deployment experience, protocol expertise <lb/>and new applications. The EC also brought together Universities and industry partners from around the <lb/>world into various collaborative efforts. <lb/>Latin America <lb/>Latin America has also begun developing projects involving IPv6. For example, the National <lb/>Autonomous University of Mexico has been conducting research to provide IPv6-enabled service to <lb/>Mexico and Latin America. <lb/>United States <lb/>In June 2003, the United States Department of Defense (DoD) mandated the integration of IPv6 to be <lb/>ready by 2008. 123 The Department of Defense&apos;s transition to IPv6 is a key component of its business case <lb/>to be able to architect new technologies and to improve interoperability among many information and <lb/>weapons systems, known as the Global Information Grid (GIG). The IPv6 component of GIG is to <lb/>facilitate DOD&apos;s goal of achieving network-centric operations by exploiting these key characteristics of <lb/>IPv6. The increased address space provides DOD with an opportunity to reconstitute its address space <lb/>architecture to better address the future proliferation of numerous unmanned sensors and mobile assets. 124 <lb/>In June 2005, the United States&apos; Office of Management Budget (OMB) set June 2008 as the deadline <lb/>by which all agencies&apos; infrastructure (network backbones) must be using IPv6 and agency networks must <lb/>be interfacing with this infrastructure. 125 <lb/>Korea <lb/>In February 2001, the Korean Ministry of Information and Communications established a plan <lb/>entitled &quot;Next Internet Infrastructure Constructing Plan by Diffusing IPv6&quot;. <lb/>In Korea, USD 81 million were invested to support several national research projects including <lb/>KOREN, KREONET2, 6NGIX and TEIN (Trans Eurasia Information Network). In 2004, Korea launched <lb/>its ―all IPv6‖ development plan named IT839 and a nationwide trial service, ―KOREAv6 Project‖. <lb/>The current targets set by the Korean Ministry of Information and Communication (MIC) to <lb/>encourage the use of IPv6 include: <lb/> Converting Internet equipment in public institutions to IPv6 by 2010. <lb/> Securing a user base of 10 million IPv6 users by 2010, in partnership with operators and <lb/>equipment vendors: a major driver is expected to come from the creation of an ―IPv6-based User <lb/>Created Content (UCC) portal service‖ to allow users to send UCC in real time through mobile <lb/>terminals such as IPv6 network cameras. <lb/></body>

			<body> Providing commercial service, by converting the backbone equipment of the commercial <lb/>telecommunications network to support IPv6 by 2010 and of the commercial <lb/>telecommunications&apos; access network to equipment that supports IPv6 by 2013. <lb/> Installing IPv6 equipment in every newly built telecommunications network. <lb/> Converting the research network to IPv6 by 2008, and using the network as a test-bed for <lb/>telecommunication equipment companies and Internet service providers. <lb/> Building a co-operative relationship between the public and private sectors for the development <lb/>and spread of IPv6-based application services; and <lb/> Reviewing related rules and regulations, including the rules for IP address and domain name <lb/>management, with a view to fostering the deployment of IPv6. <lb/>As of September 2007, Korea&apos;s Ministry of Information and Communication (MIC) will begin <lb/>providing general users with various IPv6-based services that utilise recently spotlighted Internet <lb/>technologies such as Wideband Code Division Multiple Access (WCDMA), Voice over IP (VoIP), and <lb/>Ubiquitous Sensor Networks (USN). <lb/>China <lb/>The 2008 Olympics, to be held in Beijing, are planned to serve as a wide-scale IPv6 demonstration <lb/>involving portable devices, intelligent transport systems (ITS), security, and 3G IPv6 mobile services. <lb/>China&apos;s strategy for the promotion and adoption of IPv6 is based on the development of an IPv6 <lb/>backbone network, China Next Generation Internet (CNGI), designed to be the core of China&apos;s Internet <lb/>infrastructure. CNGI intends to foster the development of IPv6 expertise, and of IPv6-enabled products and <lb/>applications. CNGI involves many branches of the Chinese government that invested USD 170 million, <lb/>private sector communication service providers with a matching investment, and academia. <lb/>CNGI is described as a nationwide demonstration platform and large-scale test bed for IPv6 SIP <lb/>(Session Initiation Protocol), providing peer-to-peer communication, wireless and mobile applications, <lb/>computing grid and data grid, video conference and HDTV (high definition television), environment <lb/>measurement, visual surveillance, remote control of instrument and virtual reality, advanced <lb/>manufacturing, remote education and digital library and remote medical treatment. <lb/>The strategy, outlined in China&apos;s latest five-year plan, calls for the country to transition its economy <lb/>from one based almost entirely on manufacturing to one that produces its own scientific and technological <lb/>breakthroughs — using a new and improved version of today&apos;s dominant innovation platform, the Internet. <lb/>IPv6 is at the heart of CNGI. <lb/></body>

			<body>ANNEX 2: ROLES OF DIFFERENT STAKEHOLDERS <lb/>Among actors that form the Internet&apos;s ecosystem, stakeholders with a particularly important role to <lb/>play in the deployment of IPv6 include: <lb/> Backbone network operators, who manage global networks. <lb/> Internet Service Providers (ISPs) of fixed and mobile IP networks. <lb/> Standardisation bodies, and the individuals and organisations that contribute to them. <lb/> The IPv6 Forum and national chapters throughout the world, for the training and the sharing of <lb/>best practices that they conduct. <lb/> Regional Internet Registries that provide stewardship for IP address allocation. <lb/> Local Internet Registries that manage IP addresses on the collection of some 26 000 autonomous <lb/>systems that together form the Internet. <lb/> ICANN, which conducts technical co-ordination for Internet parameters, including IP addresses. <lb/> The Internet Society, which is the organisational home for the Internet Engineering Task Force and <lb/>Internet Architecture Board, and itself strives to play a unique and neutral role of fostering co-<lb/>ordination among the Internet constituencies including the Regional Internet Registries. <lb/> Governments and public sector organisations that have a special role in helping to establish the <lb/>enabling environment for long-term economic and social goals. <lb/> Equipment, software and service vendors, who develop the products and services that require IPv6 <lb/>support. <lb/> Research and education networks, which have accumulated IPv6 experience and expertise. <lb/> Domain name system operators, Internet exchange points. <lb/> All public and private managers of IP networks, including those with experience in managing <lb/>IPv6, who are willing to share best practices and lessons learned. <lb/>Successes and limitations of ongoing action <lb/>Efforts by these participants have been underway in the technical and business realms to develop <lb/>solutions to a myriad of issues, to raise awareness, to find ways of measuring deployment, test and debug <lb/>production solutions. For example: <lb/> Many RFCs and websites exist to assist network managers in managing this protocol transition. <lb/> The RIRs and individual researchers track, measure and publish data and analysis that enables <lb/>others to understand portions of complex dynamics. <lb/> The IPv6 Forum and its regional and national iterations train large numbers of engineers on IPv6. <lb/> Governments in many countries have made important efforts to understand the stakes and invest <lb/>in solutions. <lb/> RIRs are developing a certification mechanism which could provide significant benefits to more <lb/>stable and more secure network operation, and a potential transfer mechanism at a later stage. <lb/> Network operators are making efforts to assess their future requirements and whether IPv6 can <lb/>provide a cost-effective solution to help ensure business continuity. <lb/></body>

			<body>ANNEX 3: PUBLICLY FUNDED RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT INITIATIVES <lb/>The first noteworthy experimental network was the 6bone Network, which ceased operation on <lb/>6 June 2006 after almost a decade. The 6bone was a worldwide network comprising many types of <lb/>organisations (including academic and government organisations, hardware and software vendors, and <lb/>service providers), with oversight from the IETF NGtrans (IPv6 Transition) working group within the <lb/>IETF. It started out as a way to transport IPv6 packets over the existing IPv4-based Internet using a process <lb/>called tunnelling, and later evolved into a network that supported IPv6 directly. <lb/>Investing in experimental networks to provide verifiable IPv6 experience helps develop experience <lb/>and expertise. Cross-fertilisation between research and development and the private sector should be a <lb/>priority. Technical experts with experience from R&amp;D networks are able to train others in order to increase <lb/>the skills base by orders of magnitude. Many major wide-area publicly funded research and development <lb/>networks have been running IPv6 infrastructure, services, and applications over the last few years. Some <lb/>examples are: <lb/> Australian Academic and Research Network (AARNET) or Grangenet in Australia <lb/> IPv6 Research and Education Network (6REN), Moonv6, Abilene (Internet2) in the United States <lb/> Education and Research Network (ERNET) in India <lb/> SURFnet in the Netherlands <lb/> CSTNet2, China Education and Research Network (CERNET2), China Next Generation Internet <lb/>(CNGI) in China <lb/> Gigabit European Academic Network (GEANT), 6NET, 6DISS, Euro6IX and all European <lb/>National Research Network (NRNs) in Europe <lb/> JGN2 and Widely Integrated Distributed Environment (WIDE) in Japan <lb/> Korea Research Environment Open Network 2 (KREONET2), 6NGIX and TEIN (Trans Eurasia <lb/>Information Network) and the KOREAv6 Project in Korea <lb/> RedCLARA in Latin America <lb/> RUNet and FREEnet in Russia <lb/> Viagenie/CANARIE in Canada <lb/> TANET2 and TWAREN in Chinese Taipei <lb/>A number of governmental authorities have actively promoted sector-specific IPv6 applications. <lb/>These include, for example: <lb/> Applications using IPv6-based 3G mobile services and <lb/>connectivity for transportation applications: trains, cars, airplanes <lb/> Peer-to-peer communication <lb/> Computing grid and data grid <lb/> Video conference and HDTV (high definition television) <lb/> Environment measurement <lb/> Remote control of instrument and virtual reality <lb/> Advanced manufacturing <lb/> Remote education and digital library <lb/> Remote medical treatment <lb/>Many applications can use features of IPv6 to help provide economic and social benefits. The <lb/>vision of the future that many stakeholders have for the Internet economy is to be an enabler of wider <lb/>societal and to scale for new uses. It appears that IPv6 could provide the address space needed for many <lb/>enabling applications. <lb/></body>

			<body>ANNEX 5: REGIONAL INTERNET REGISTRY POLICY DEVELOPMENT PROCESSES <lb/>The RIRs are membership-based organisations through which Internet resource policies are developed <lb/>in an open, bottom-up and transparent manner by the Internet community. In the case of ARIN for <lb/>example, anyone may participate in the process and contribute to policy discussions, which often take <lb/>place on public mailing lists. The ARIN Board of Trustees ratifies policies after public discussion is held, a <lb/>review and recommendation by the ARIN Advisory Council is made, and there is evidence that rough <lb/>consensus (i.e. that no parties have significant reservations), for a specific policy has been reached among <lb/>the ARIN community. Addressing policy proposals are ratified, then adopted, left until the next meeting <lb/>for future discussion or ―rejected‖. 126 The other RIRs have similar processes, although each RIR&apos;s process <lb/>may differ in detail. In all these respects the current RIR system is transparent, representative, flexible and <lb/>effective. Figure 14 details RIPE NCC&apos;s policy development process. <lb/>Table 12.

			<body>ANNEX 9: INCREASED AWARENESS AND PUBLIC STATEMENTS OF SUPPORT FOR IPV6 <lb/>Technical standards groups, all five regional Internet registries (RIRs), ICANN, as well as national <lb/>Internet registries (NIRs) have recently made public statements emphasising the need for IPv6 deployment <lb/>with renewed urgency. <lb/>On 7 May 2007, the ARIN Board of Trustees passed a resolution on Internet protocol numbering <lb/>resource availability. The resolution i) advises ―the Internet community that migration to IPv6 numbering <lb/>resources is necessary for any applications which require ongoing availability from ARIN of contiguous IP <lb/>numbering resources‖; ii) directs ARIN staff to take any and all measures necessary to assure veracity of <lb/>applications to ARIN for IPv4 numbering resources; and, iii) requests the ARIN Advisory Council to <lb/>consider Internet Numbering Resource Policy changes advisable to encourage migration to IPv6 <lb/>numbering resources where possible. 127 <lb/>In other words, ARIN was advising companies that will need public addresses in the future to support <lb/>their growth to plan ahead and investigate deployment of IPv6. It also forewarned its membership and the <lb/>wider business community that ARIN would carefully monitor applications for IPv4 space due to <lb/>upcoming scarcity and that it would introduce policies to encourage the migration of IPv6 where possible. <lb/>Shortly thereafter, on 20 June 2007, in Montevideo, LACNIC announced that it was launching a <lb/>regional campaign so that all the region&apos;s networks would be adapted to IPv6 by 1 January 2011. It advised <lb/>companies, governments and institutions to take the necessary steps to prepare to adopt IPv6 as soon as <lb/>possible. 128 <lb/>ICANN&apos;s Board passed a resolution on the deployment of IPv6 on 29 June 2007, which stated: <lb/>―the future growth of the Internet (…) depends on the availability and timely deployment of <lb/>IPv6‖ and that ―the Board ―resolves to work with the Regional Internet Registries and other <lb/>stakeholders to promote education and outreach, with the goal of supporting the future growth of <lb/>the Internet by encouraging the timely deployment of IPv6.‖ <lb/>Beyond a call to real action in encouraging IPv6 deployment, the important message of the ICANN <lb/>Board was that ―the Board expresses its confidence in the Internet community to meet this challenge to its <lb/>future prospects, and expresses its confidence in the bottom-up, inclusive, stakeholder-driven processes in <lb/>place to provide any needed policy changes.‖ 129 <lb/>On 1 July 2007, after considering the situation of the IPv4 central pool depletion and the analysis <lb/>paper published by AfriNIC staff in April 2007, the AfriNIC Board passed a Resolution stating: <lb/>&quot;Noting the imminent exhaustion of the IPv4 address central pool, the AfriNIC Board resolves <lb/>that efforts to draw the public&apos;s attention to the problem and potential solutions such as IPv6 be <lb/>intensified, and instructs the staff to take appropriate action in this regard&quot;. 130 <lb/>In line with this resolution, the AfriNIC Board announced that they would reach out to a larger <lb/>audience including the media, advise network operators in the region to make their network infrastructure <lb/>IPv6 ready as soon as possible, and intensify its IPv6 awareness and training activity across the continent. <lb/>On 7 September 2007, at APNIC 24, the APNIC community agreed to a resolution recognising the <lb/>critical importance of IPv6 for the future success of the Internet, and stating that the APNIC community <lb/></body>

			<note place="headnote">DSTI/ICCP(2007)20/FINAL <lb/></note>

			<page>64 <lb/></page>

			<body>would actively promote the adoption of IPv6, and focus its efforts towards comprehensive deployment of <lb/>IPv6 in the Asia Pacific region. On the transition to IPv6 APNIC stated: <lb/>―We agree that this situation requires a concerted effort by this community, working for the <lb/>common good, to seek, examine and adopt responsible measures for the management of <lb/>remaining IPv4 address space. We recognise that during this period, we will be learning and <lb/>adapting, and that address management policies may also change to adapt to new <lb/>circumstances.‖ 131 <lb/>The APNIC resolution also reasserted support for open, bottom-up and consensus-based decision <lb/>making. In addition, it stated, <lb/>―we also call upon the leading senior and expert members of this community to provide strong <lb/>leadership in the search for solutions to these issues of IPv4 address management and transition <lb/>to IPv6, both within the Asia Pacific region and globally‖. <lb/>On 26 October 2007, the RIPE community agreed to a resolution on IPv4 Depletion and Deployment <lb/>of IPv6, which included a reference to the role of governments in deployment of IPv6: <lb/>&quot;We recommend that service providers make their services available over IPv6. We urge those <lb/>who will need significant new address resources to deploy IPv6. We encourage governments to <lb/>play their part in the deployment of IPv6 and in particular to ensure that all citizens will be able <lb/>to participate in the future information society. We urge that the widespread deployment of IPv6 <lb/>be made a high priority by all stakeholders.&quot; 132 <lb/>On 12 November 2007, an Internet draft on an ―IETF Statement on IPv4 Exhaustion and IPv6‖, which <lb/>considered &quot;work in progress&quot; in IETF procedures, was submitted to the Internet standards body. In what <lb/>follows, the draft&apos;s author summarises the reason for the IETF to re-iterate its support and continued <lb/>commitment to IPv6: <lb/>―IPv6 deployment is necessary to ensure the continued growth and expansion of the Internet. <lb/>Deployment of IPv6 is needed to preserve the important properties of the Internet that have made <lb/>it a success and enable new generations of applications and services.‖ 133 <lb/></body>

			<body>NOTES <lb/>1. <lb/>In parallel, the technical community has to manage complex trends in routing, because of the strong <lb/>interdependency between addressing and routing. To do this, the technical community is discussing <lb/>solutions to enable enterprises to be independent from their Internet provider; i.e. supporting competition <lb/>between Internet providers while mitigating its impact on routing table processing <lb/>2. <lb/>An IP address is not, however, a unique identifier. While IP addresses help to identify a device that is <lb/>participating in a communication, this ―who‖ function is only valid in one location and changes based on <lb/>location. <lb/>3. <lb/>From a network topology context. <lb/>4. <lb/>Huston, G., ―Addressing as a Fundamental Part of the Internet‖, NSF/OECD workshop, January 2007, <lb/>http://www.oecd.org/sti/ict/futureinternet2007. <lb/>5. <lb/>The free pool of unallocated IPv4 address space is considered to be the IANA pool. After then, regional <lb/>Internet registries will still have remaining address space to last until mid 2011 at current consumption <lb/>rates. Widely consulted sources for projections are Geoff Huston&apos;s &quot;IPv4 Address Space Report&quot; available <lb/>at http://ipv4.potaroo.net and Tony Hain&apos;s &quot;A Pragmatic Report on IPv4 Address Space Consumption&quot; <lb/>available at http://www.tndh.net/~tony/ietf/ipv4-pool-combined-view.pdf. <lb/>6. <lb/>The Internet Domain Survey, July 2007, counted 489 million hosts, http://www.isc.org/index.pl?/ops/ds/ <lb/>and Internet World stats, Feb 2008, http://www.internetworldstats.com/stats.htm. <lb/>7. <lb/>In reality, the number of addressable objects in an addressing plan is much lower than the ―theoretical‖ <lb/>maximum, because addressing plans are typically organised hierarchically and there is loss of efficiency at <lb/>each level of a hierarchical plan. For this reason, a logarithmic ―host-density ratio‖ or ―HD-ratio‖ for <lb/>address assignment efficiency is used rather than a linear function. <lb/>8. <lb/>This number is theory – the IPv6 address architecture has already reduced this to a significantly smaller <lb/>number by taking off the bottom 64 bits and using them as some form of interface identifier. <lb/>9. <lb/>Or the router must have a default route to which it sends all traffic for which it doesn&apos;t have explicit <lb/>instructions. <lb/>10. <lb/>See page 15 for more information about the use of ―/‖ in front of a number. <lb/>11. <lb/>The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) is a large open international community of network designers, <lb/>operators, vendors, and researchers concerned with the evolution of the Internet architecture and the <lb/>smooth operation of the Internet. The IETF Mission Statement is documented in RFC 3935. The mission of <lb/>the IETF is to produce high quality, relevant technical and engineering documents that influence the way <lb/>people design, use, and manage the Internet in such a way as to make the Internet work better. These <lb/>documents include protocol standards, best current practices, and informational documents of various <lb/>kinds. <lb/>12. <lb/>BGP4 propagates prefix lengths along with the subnet addresses. <lb/>13. <lb/>It should be noted that servers can also be behind NATs today. <lb/>14. <lb/>Saltzer, J., Reed, D. and Clark, D., ―End-to-end arguments in system design‖, 1981, <lb/>http://web.mit.edu/Saltzer/www/publications/endtoend/endtoend.pdf. <lb/></body>

ARIN states that it will not <lb/>reclaim unutilised address space from legacy holders who sign the RSA. It allows ARIN to accept the <lb/>return or relinquishment of any address space from any existing address holder. Organisations returning <lb/>addresses under this policy see their fees waived if they voluntarily return unused address space. <lb/>Discussions regarding legacy space come primarily out of ARIN because most of the legacy allocations <lb/>were made to organisations in the ARIN region, before the creation of the RIR system. <lb/>55. <lb/>The Routing Research Group of the Internet Research Task Force (IRTF) is discussing several technical <lb/>schemes that are intended primarily to help the routing system scale with growing demand for more <lb/>multihomed end-user networks.

Most of the signaling overhead cost is to make the transmission between the mobile node and its <lb/>peer secure. <lb/>80. <lb/>In this case there appears to be a need to devise more complex forms of protocol translation mechanisms <lb/>that use forms of 4in6 protocol mapping, in order to allow IPv4 packets to transit across an IPv6 internal <lb/>infrastructure. The issue concerns the capability of available routers to perform such packet <lb/>transformations within the necessarily very high packet processing rates that such high volume networks <lb/>require. <lb/>81. <lb/>http://www.potaroo.net/ispcol/2007-08/dualstack.html. <lb/>82. <lb/>John Curran, J., ―An Internet Transition Plan‖, August 2007, Informational Internet-draft, <lb/>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-jcurran-v6transitionplan-01.txt. <lb/>83. <lb/>In ―A Scenario-Based Review of IPv6 Transition Tools,‖ Mackay and colleagues leverage their experience <lb/>running 6Net, one of Europe&apos;s largest IPv6 research networks.
