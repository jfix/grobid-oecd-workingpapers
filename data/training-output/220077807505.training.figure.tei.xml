There are no procedures for<lb/> tendering social tariffs as these are imposed on all providers and funded through a fund to<lb/> which all market participants contribute. There are no legal tools to assess that the<lb/> USO provision actually constitutes an unfair burden, which would justify the additional<lb/> financing.
