			<front>Abstract <lb/>Nothing ventured, nothing gained: the long-run fiscal reward of structural reforms <lb/>The recent reform of the Stability and Growth Pact provides more leeway for EU governments to <lb/>temporarily breach the 3% deficit limit if this facilitates the implementation of initially expensive reforms. But <lb/>the implementation of this principle is not obvious as budgets would need to specify the initial and multi-annual <lb/>budgetary cost and benefit profile of reforms. Budgets should also be explicit about the fiscal cost of inaction to <lb/>allow a balanced judgment of countries&apos; trade-offs between the various options available. This paper first <lb/>assesses the information requirements to implement this new form of flexibility built into the Stability and <lb/>Growth Pact. It then provides simulation exercises to highlight the positive budgetary effects of coordinated <lb/>structural reforms in the euro area as well as the need for an adequate monetary policy response to make sure <lb/>that demand adjusts to the improved supply conditions swiftly. The budgetary gains would still depend on the <lb/>type of reform and their impact on employment and productivity. On the other hand, national policy initiatives <lb/>by a single country may only have a limited impact, especially in the short term and in the case of a large <lb/>country. Indeed, in monetary union, the strength of endogenous adjustment mechanisms appears to be weaker in <lb/>larger countries. Finally, the experience of New Zealand and Australia has shown that the longer-term benefits <lb/>of reforms both in terms of the budget and overall economic performance are significant. Even so, it is not easy <lb/>to disentangle the various forces at play. Fundamentally, structural reform and the implementation of smart <lb/>fiscal frameworks tend to go hand in hand – indeed may be two sides of the same coin. <lb/>JEL classification: E37, E62, E63, E65, H6, P52. <lb/>Key words: Monetary union, fiscal policy, structural reforms. <lb/>* * * * * <lb/>Résumé <lb/>Qui ne risque rien n&apos;a rien : les bénéfices budgétaires à long terme des réformes structurelles <lb/></front>

			<body>La réforme récente du Pacte de stabilité et de croissance fournit davantage de marges aux gouvernements <lb/>des pays de l&apos;UE pour dépasser la limite de 3 % du déficit public si cela facilite la mise en oeuvre de réformes <lb/>initialement coûteuses. L&apos;application de ce principe n&apos;est cependant pas évidente car les budgets devraient <lb/>indiquer le profil des coûts et bénéfices budgétaires attendus de ces réformes, non seulement dans l&apos;immédiat <lb/>mais aussi dans une perspective pluriannuelle. Les budgets devraient aussi être explicites sur le coût budgétaire <lb/>de l&apos;inaction pour permettre une évaluation équilibrée des dilemmes auxquels doivent faire face les pays en <lb/>fonction des diverses options disponibles. Cet article fournit d&apos;abord une évaluation des besoins d&apos;information <lb/>pour mettre en oeuvre les nouveaux éléments de flexibilité inclus dans le Pacte de stabilité et de croissance. Il <lb/>présente ensuite des exercices de simulation afin d&apos;illustrer les effets budgétaires positifs de réformes <lb/>structurelles coordonnées dans la zone euro ainsi que la nécessité d&apos;une réponse de politique monétaire adéquate <lb/>afin d&apos;assurer que la demande s&apos;ajuste rapidement à l&apos;amélioration des conditions d&apos;offre. Les gains budgétaires <lb/>seraient alors variables selon le type de réformes réalisées et leur impact sur l&apos;emploi et la productivité. D&apos;un <lb/>autre côté, des réformes menées dans un pays isolé pourraient n&apos;avoir qu&apos;un effet limité, notamment à court <lb/>terme dans le cas d&apos;un grand pays. En effet, dans l&apos;union monétaire, la force des mécanismes d&apos;ajustement <lb/>endogènes semble plus faible dans les grands pays. Enfin, l&apos;expérience de la Nouvelle Zélande et de l&apos;Australie <lb/>montre que les bénéfices à long terme des réformes sont importants à la fois sur le plan budgétaire et pour les <lb/>performances économiques d&apos;ensemble, même s&apos;il n&apos;est pas aisé de distinguer l&apos;influence des différentes forces <lb/>en jeu. Fondamentalement, la réforme structurelle et la mise en place d&apos;un cadre budgétaire pertinent tendent à <lb/>aller de pair – et semblent en effet être les deux faces d&apos;une même pièce. <lb/>Classification JEL : E37, E62, E63, E65, H6, P52. <lb/>Mots clés : union monétaire, politique budgétaire, réformes structurelles. <lb/>To see previous ECO Working Papers, go to www.oecd.org/eco/working_papers. <lb/>Copyright OECD, 2006 <lb/>Application for permission to reproduce or translate all, or part of, this material should be made to: <lb/>Head of Publications Service, OECD, 2 rue André Pascal, 75775 Paris Cedex 16, France. <lb/></body>

			<body>Nothing ventured, nothing gained: the long-run fiscal reward of <lb/>structural reforms <lb/>Peter Hoeller and Claude Giorno 1 <lb/>Introduction <lb/>1. <lb/>We take it for granted that fiscal discipline is important because: large deficits and rising debt <lb/>undermine the long-run sustainability of fiscal policy, excessive deficits will be a burden on future <lb/>generations, fiscal policy volatility can undermine growth and a pro-cyclical policy can destabilise the <lb/>economy (Fatás, 2005). Fiscal rules are one way to cope with such fiscal policy biases, even though they <lb/>need to be underpinned by institutional settings so that they can be enforced at the national, and in the case <lb/>of the euro area, at the Community level. <lb/>2. <lb/>These concerns were not at the root of the EU fiscal framework. It was designed to address <lb/>another key concern, namely that once exchange rates within the single currency area ceased to exist, <lb/>financial markets would no longer discipline fiscal policy. Fiscal profligacy in one country could affect <lb/>area-wide interest rates and crowd out economic activity in other countries. Even though interest rate <lb/>differentials across the euro area countries have narrowed despite a divergent fiscal performance, there is <lb/>little evidence of spill-over effects. The main reason probably is that there is little to crowd out due to <lb/>persistent economic slack in the large euro area countries. <lb/>3. <lb/>This may be one reason why the arguments in favour of rules-based fiscal co-ordination have <lb/>shifted towards long-term issues, as they should, especially because ageing-related concerns oblige <lb/>governments to recognise the implications of current budget decisions for public finances in the future. <lb/>Also, greater attention has progressively shifted to the incentives built into budgetary institutions that <lb/>produce fiscal biases (higher deficits, expenditure and taxes). Even though these institutions have improved <lb/>to some extent, they are still lagging best practice in many euro area countries. <lb/>4. <lb/>At the same time, calls to make the Pact more flexible have mushroomed. Some were motivated <lb/>by new member countries&apos; need to boost infrastructure outlays, against the backdrop of relatively low <lb/>public debt levels. Some observers have argued in favour of the &quot; golden rule &quot; , along the lines of the one <lb/>introduced in 1997 in the United Kingdom. <lb/>1 . <lb/>The authors are members of the Economics Department. The views expressed are those of the authors and <lb/>not necessarily of the OECD. This is part of a paper, earlier versions of which were presented at the <lb/>European Commission Workshop on the Budgetary Implications of Structural Reforms held in Brussels on <lb/>2 December 2005 and at the Banca d&apos;Italia Workshop on Public Finance in Perugia on 30 March to 1 April <lb/>2006.

			<body>5. <lb/>Another rationale for a rewrite of the rules is that structural reform is expected to yield long-term <lb/>economic gains but often entail up-front costs that may dissuade governments from implementing <lb/>structural reforms. The expected gains of structural reforms are usually uncertain, long-term and spread out <lb/>across the economy whereas any political and budgetary costs, such as compensation schemes to offset <lb/>redistributive effects, are more tangible, are felt immediately and are more concentrated. Moreover, some <lb/>reforms will involve J-curve effects; a cut in taxation will reduce budget receipts immediately while effects <lb/>on incentives to work, save and invest may take some time before they materialise. This asymmetry could <lb/>discourage reforms, especially in a monetary union, where they cannot be supported via an easing of <lb/>monetary policy. Similarly, a move towards privately-funded pension schemes typically leads to deficits in <lb/>the public scheme but initial surpluses in the private schemes as contributors transfer to them. <lb/>6. <lb/>According to the fiscal rules a waiver can be granted under the excessive deficit procedure to <lb/>countries on the basis of &quot; exceptional circumstances &quot; (EC, 2005a and EC, 2006). While the Treaty had <lb/>already stipulated that &quot; other relevant factors &quot; should be part of the &quot; exceptional circumstances &quot; , these <lb/>were not specified. The revamped Pact decided by the European Council in March 2005 specifies them and <lb/>the conditions under which they are taken into account. These include efforts to pursue the Lisbon agenda, <lb/>to foster R&amp;D or &quot; a high level of financial contributions &quot; to underpin the &quot; unification of Europe &quot; and <lb/> &quot; international solidarity &quot; (development aid). Consideration would also be given to pension reforms. <lb/>Concerning the Lisbon agenda, the new Council Regulation observes: &quot; In order to enhance the <lb/>growth-oriented nature of the Pact, major structural reforms which have direct long-term cost-saving <lb/>effects, including through raising potential growth, and therefore a verifiable impact on the long-term <lb/>sustainability of public finances, should be taken into account when defining the adjustment path to the <lb/>medium-term budgetary objective for countries that have not yet reached this objective and in allowing a <lb/>temporary deviation from this objective for countries that have already reached it &quot; (EC, 2005b). All these <lb/>provisions, however, only apply if &quot; an excess over the reference value is temporary &quot; and if the deficit ratio <lb/> &quot; remains close to the reference value &quot; , as stipulated in the Treaty. In its assessment of the most recent <lb/>batch of stability programmes the Commission (EC, 2006) noted that no structural reforms were taken into <lb/>account in setting adjustment path towards the medium-term fiscal objectives because of the lack of <lb/>information provided in the programmes on the content of reforms and their budgetary implications. <lb/>Moreover, there were virtually no cases of structural reforms being discussed. <lb/>7. <lb/>Against this backdrop we will address the following three questions: <lb/>• Do governments actually know the size of the upfront cost of structural reform or do they at least <lb/>make any efforts to estimate them? This is an important question, because without such estimates <lb/>it is hard to see what could eventually underpin a waiver. Unfortunately the answer is a qualified <lb/>no, as will become clear in the first section of this paper.<lb/>• What can the economics profession contribute to estimating the long-run gain of structural <lb/>reform? The usual instrument is to look at macroeconomic feedback mechanisms and to simulate <lb/>various scenarios with an economic model to study the fiscal implications of reforms that affect <lb/>technical progress, the participation rate or the natural rate of unemployment in different settings. <lb/>This is what we will do in the second section.<lb/>• What do historical examples of deep structural reform say about the interplay between structural <lb/>reform and public finances? The answer from New Zealand and Australia is that their structural <lb/>reform programmes were followed by a very strong improvement in their fiscal positions.<lb/></body>

			<body>Costing the impact of reforms on the budget <lb/>The UK budget: a role model? <lb/>8. <lb/>Assessing the budgetary implications of structural reforms in the short, medium and long run is <lb/>shrouded with many difficulties. In many cases, governments do provide a costing of changes in tax and <lb/>spending plans and often also beyond the current budget. 2 Obviously, changes in tax and spending plans <lb/>are pursued for many other purposes than purely fiscal ones. UK Budgets (HMT, 2001, 2002, 2003 and <lb/>2004), for instance, provide an assessment of Budget policy decisions over a three-year horizon under the <lb/>following headings: meeting the fiscal rules and funding public services; meeting the productivity <lb/>challenge; increasing employment opportunity for all; building a fairer society; a modern and fair tax <lb/>system; and protecting the environment. <lb/>9. <lb/>Budget 2002, for instance, lists 54 spending and tax measures and estimates their budgetary <lb/>effect. The budgetary impact of 16 measures implemented since Budget 2001 are estimated as well. The <lb/>biggest measure was a payroll tax increase and the second biggest an increase in the generosity of the <lb/>Child Tax Credit and Working Tax Credit for families with children. All other measures were small, <lb/>ranging from beer duty relief for small brewers to simplifying capital gains tax. While the list of measures <lb/>is long, only those are included where the impact of the decisions and circumstances can be quantified with <lb/>reasonable accuracy. Moreover, spending that is fixed by the spending reviews and embedded in <lb/>Departmental Expenditure Limits is not included in the Budget costing of decisions. In 2002, the net fiscal <lb/>impact of the identified spending and revenue measures was nearly 1% of GDP, but considerably lower in <lb/>most other Budgets (Table 1). In comparison, the forecasting error for the deficit was equivalent to 1% of <lb/>GDP for the year-ahead projection in recent years and nearly 1½ per cent of GDP for the two-year ahead <lb/>projection. There is no strong hint in the Budget costings that reforms have generated large budgetary costs <lb/>in the short term. However, this is so mainly, because the spending underpinning the ongoing reforms to <lb/>health, education and infrastructure are built into (hence respect) the Departmental Spending Limits. <lb/>Table 1. The costing of Budget policy decisions in the UK <lb/>Budgetary measures as a per cent of GDP <lb/>1 <lb/>2001-02 <lb/>2002-03 <lb/>2003-04 <lb/>2004-05 <lb/>2005-06 <lb/>2006-07 <lb/>Budget 2001 <lb/>-0.2 <lb/>+0.2 <lb/>+0.3 <lb/>Measures since Budget 2000 <lb/>-0.3 <lb/>-0.4 <lb/>-0.3 <lb/>Budget 2002 <lb/>-0.1 <lb/>+0.6 <lb/>+0.7 <lb/>Measures since Budget 2001 <lb/>-0.0 <lb/>-0.2 <lb/>-0.2 <lb/>Budget 2003 <lb/>-0.1 <lb/>-0.0 <lb/>+0.0 <lb/>Measures since Budget 2002 <lb/>+0.1 <lb/>+0.0 <lb/>+0.1 <lb/>Budget 2004 <lb/>-0.1 <lb/>+0.0 <lb/>-0.0 <lb/>Measures since Budget 2003 <lb/>-0.1 <lb/>-0.1 <lb/>-0.1 <lb/>1.

Assessments of feedbacks of tax and <lb/>spending changes on economic activity are even rarer. HMT&apos;s effects of budget measures, for instance, do <lb/>not include effects on overall levels of income and spending. This is not surprising, because there is often <lb/>no consensus on effects. Depending on the underlying model and empirics, a rise in payroll taxes can have <lb/></body>

			<body>a negative short, medium or long-term impact on structural unemployment, or none at all. Effects of R&amp;D <lb/>tax credits or grants on R&amp;D spending and ultimately growth are notoriously difficult to quantify. Or the <lb/>effect of savings incentives on substitution between different savings vehicles versus aggregate savings is <lb/>usually impossible to pin down. And sometimes, long lags imply that any discernible effects of reforms <lb/>would only show up after many years. Still, in the United States, attempts are underway to include <lb/>feedback effects in assessing tax and spending proposals (Box 1). <lb/>Box 1. Dynamic scoring <lb/>In the United States, legislative proposals are scrutinised by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) and the <lb/>Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT). They provide a baseline and forecasts of the changes in expenditure and <lb/>revenues that would result from proposed legislation over the following ten years. <lb/>1 The forecasts provide a cost <lb/>estimate or &quot; score &quot; , for each piece of legislation that is reported by a Congressional committee (Page, 2005). In the <lb/>past, the scoring was static, not taking into account macroeconomic feedback effects. Dynamic scoring, which is still in <lb/>its infancy, takes into account induced changes on output, inflation, interest rates or other macroeconomic feedbacks. <lb/>The scoring is important as it influences how favourably initiatives are viewed in Congress and the Senate. A tax cut, <lb/>for instance, could raise output significantly, with a large cut in tax rates having little implication for net government <lb/>revenues. If this feedback is not included, the tax cut will be viewed less favourably by Congress, which is usually <lb/>constrained to keep the total revenue cost of a tax package within pre-set targets (Altshuler et al., 2005) <lb/>The outcome of dynamic scoring depends on the models used and on assumptions about macroeconomic policy <lb/>reactions. In assessing the 2004 budget, forward-looking, life-cycle growth models and more traditional <lb/>macroeconomic forecasting models were used. For the latter, various monetary policy reactions to the fiscal stimulus <lb/>were simulated, while the growth models differ in various respects. Given different models and assumptions, the <lb/>outcomes differed widely. Concerning the JCT&apos;s analysis, incorporating dynamic effects reduced the net revenue cost <lb/>of one proposal by 6 to 28% over the first five years and 3 to 23% over the second five years. Auerbach (2005) <lb/>concludes from these first attempts, that &quot; … it seems clear that dynamic scoring analysis has value, but also that <lb/>adjustments to estimates are smaller than some might have expected. The process to date offers some support to <lb/>those on both sides of the debate. On the one hand, the ability of CBO and JCT to produce dynamic analyses of <lb/>complex, realistic proposals lends credence to the argument that dynamic analysis and, indeed, dynamic scoring may <lb/>be feasible. On the other hand, the many models used and the many assumptions needed leave many with doubts <lb/>about the quality of these estimates and how they would fit into the budget scoring process as currently structured. &quot; <lb/>1. On the expenditure side, the CBO provides the baseline and the scoring, on the revenue side the CBO provides <lb/>the baseline and the JCT the scoring. <lb/>Quantifying the cost of inaction <lb/>11. <lb/>One could argue that, before allowing more leeway under the fiscal rules, unproductive spending <lb/>should be pruned first, which would probably leave enough room to spend on priority areas, without <lb/>running up against the deficit limit. Similar issues relate to reforms, or the lack thereof, of budgetary <lb/>frameworks, which are far from being best practice in many EU countries (Joumard et al., 2004). The <lb/>design of reforms themselves may also be problematic: perhaps the scope for more cost-effective <lb/>approaches is not being exploited. There are many examples of government spending programmes that <lb/>tend to undermine growth, come at a high budgetary cost, sometimes grow considerably faster than GDP <lb/>and are difficult to reform. They crowd out more productive government spending programmes. As such <lb/>programmes tend to push countries towards the Maastricht deficit limit, the question arises whether policy <lb/>inaction in such areas should not be taken into account, when granting greater flexibility on spending in <lb/>priority areas. <lb/>12. <lb/>The potential sources of fiscal stress built into government programmes are multiple. Fiscal <lb/>pressures may mount because of biased incentives of government programmes, for example in the case of <lb/>early retirement and disability schemes. The implicit tax on continued work, which gauges incentives to <lb/>quit work before the retirement age, is very high in many European countries (Figure 1). There have been <lb/></body>

			<body>reforms, but most were minor, though Italy lowered the implicit tax a lot between 1998 and 2003. Early <lb/>retirement lowers labour utilisation and has fiscal costs that can amount to several per cent of GDP. <lb/>Similarly, the number of disability benefit recipients varies considerably across countries and only a few <lb/>countries were successful in reducing the number of beneficiaries (Figure 2). In fact, in many countries, the <lb/>number of beneficiaries keeps on rising rapidly. <lb/>Figure 1.

Majnoni d&apos;Intignano (2001), for instance, argues that health reforms in France <lb/>are recurrent, actually close to one every year between 1975 and 2000, but have barely dented spending <lb/>growth, or have slowed growth in one year, but with a catch-up towards the underlying spending trend the <lb/>next. The costing of changes in government programmes is not too difficult for programmes that are <lb/>relatively simple and where at least some changes in policy parameters influence private decision making <lb/>in a straightforward way: the implications of pension reforms, for instance, have been well researched by <lb/>the Commission or the OECD. More complex issues, like the effects of health care reforms are much more <lb/>difficult to quantify. There are many actors and incentive effects are difficult to model. <lb/>14. <lb/>The cost of inaction can be illustrated by resorting to the now fashionable distinction between the <lb/>Nordic, Anglo-Saxon, continental and Mediterranean social models. Boeri (2002), for instance, compares <lb/>their performance in terms of meeting three objectives: reductions in income inequality and poverty; <lb/>protection against uninsurable labour market risk; and the reward to labour market participation. And <lb/>indeed, geography and economic characteristic tend to coincide, though the match is not perfect. Sapir <lb/>(2005) uses the same typology, but focuses on efficiency and equity aspects: Efficiency is measured by a <lb/>high employment rate and equity by a low poverty rate. <lb/>15. <lb/>Figure 3 shows that all Nordic and Anglo-Saxon countries are above average in terms of <lb/>employment, whereas most continental countries (except Austria and the Netherlands) and Mediterranean <lb/>countries (except Portugal) rank below average. On the other hand, poverty is relatively high in the <lb/>Mediterranean and Anglo-Saxon countries and relatively low in the continental and Nordic countries. Sapir <lb/>(2005) has analysed the reasons for these differences. What is important in the context of this paper is the <lb/>fiscal sustainability of social models. Net public debt as a per cent of GDP is much lower in the &quot; efficient &quot; <lb/>countries and much higher in the continental and Mediterranean countries (Table 2). Moreover, debt does <lb/>not tend to come down much in the high-debt countries (except Belgium), while it has stayed low or even <lb/>come down further in most better-performing countries. <lb/>ECO/WKP(2006)21 <lb/></body>

The OECD has developed a broad range of indicators concerning the <lb/>stringency of labour and product market regulations. 3 The OECD has also produced a lot of empirical work <lb/>that traces the effects of the regulatory stance on employment and unemployment rates, R&amp;D intensity and <lb/>ultimately growth. This work has culminated in the OECD&apos;s Growth Project (OECD, 2001) and feeds into <lb/>the ongoing structural surveillance work (OECD, 2005). Substantial methodological progress has been <lb/>achieved in constructing structural policy indicators with an econometric link to economic performance. <lb/>18. <lb/>Such inventories are potentially very useful, but there are also limitations, when assessing the <lb/>budgetary implications of structural reforms: <lb/>• These inventories leave out a wide variety of regulations, such as health and safety or <lb/>environmental regulations, which could have a budgetary impact.<lb/>• There is in general no direct link between these inventories and budgetary effects and it would <lb/>seem difficult to establish the link between reforms and side-payments to get reforms underway.<lb/>19. <lb/>Moreover, while the body of empirical work on growth is enormous, there are still considerable <lb/>disagreements about what reforms can achieve in the short and long term. In particular, the short-term <lb/>adjustment costs associated with reforms are under-researched. Moreover, results are data-quality, model <lb/>and estimator dependent. While cross-country growth regressions have been an extremely popular means <lb/>of testing ideas about the sources of growth, many of the variables claimed to be significant have not <lb/>passed tests of statistical robustness (Ahn and Hemmings, 2000). Another problem is the lack of accepted <lb/>formal theoretical models that can accommodate the wide range of variables that are often included as <lb/>explanatory variables, despite advances in the theory of economic growth. A related issue is that causal <lb/>links between aggregate economic variables and growth are bi-directional, hence most estimates are likely <lb/>to suffer from endogeneity problems. <lb/>3. <lb/>The World Bank has also developed inventories of policy measures. Another example is the indicators <lb/>developed by the Fondazione Rodolfo Debenedetti. <lb/></body>

			<body>Structural reform, feedback mechanisms and fiscal performance: what can a macro-model tell? <lb/>20. <lb/>Even if reforms have measurable direct beneficial effects on primary spending, their overall <lb/>effect on the fiscal position depends on economic feedback mechanisms and will vary across countries. To <lb/>quantify the impact of these mechanisms, several simulations were run with the OECD&apos;s Interlink model. <lb/>They show how the macroeconomic effects of structural reform can vary across different situations, and in <lb/>particular they illustrate the difference between concerted reform efforts versus reforms in a single country. <lb/>Effects of coordinated reform in monetary union <lb/>21. <lb/>Simulations have been run to quantify the benefits from co-ordinating structural reform with <lb/>monetary policy in the case of the euro area. To set a benchmark, we first construct scenarios in which co-<lb/>ordination with monetary policy is absent. Three scenarios are run: first, total factor productivity is raised; <lb/>second, labour force participation increases; and third, structural unemployment is reduced. These changes <lb/>affect the large euro area countries and thus the overall performance of the euro area, for which the level of <lb/>potential output increases by 1¼ per cent over eight years. The reforms all imply lower inflation and are <lb/>accompanied by lower interest rates in a way that keeps real interest rates unchanged. Exchange rates are <lb/>assumed fixed, except in one simulation. Finally, tax rates are kept constant and also government <lb/>consumption and investment are held fixed in real terms. The results are represented with respect to a <lb/>baseline scenario which goes to 2012, which is based on the premise that countries converge gradually to <lb/>their potential production level. 4 <lb/>Effects of a rise in trend productivity <lb/>22. <lb/>The first simulation illustrates the effect of a productivity gain on macroeconomic and budgetary <lb/>performance. As many studies have shown there is considerable potential to raise productivity in the euro <lb/>area, be it by product and labour market reforms or stronger innovative activity (OECD, 2003 and 2004). <lb/>The simulation assumes that the level of trend labour productivity goes up by a cumulated increase of 2% <lb/>over eight years. In the simulation, stronger productivity growth leads to a gradual rise in real wages, <lb/>which is compatible with lower inflation (Figure 5). This raises internal demand and boosts net exports, <lb/>which benefit from improved competitiveness. Total demand rises somewhat faster than potential output <lb/>and the output gap closes more quickly than in the baseline. The budget balance improves in actual and <lb/>structural terms by about 1¼ per cent of GDP at the end of the simulation period. This is mainly due to the <lb/>lower nominal interest rates and to a lesser extent to improved social accounts. The reduction of the deficit <lb/>allows only a small decline in the debt/GDP ratio, because lower inflation lowers nominal GDP growth. 5 <lb/>4. <lb/>Medium-term scenarios that prolong the short-term projections are regularly up-dated by the OECD. They <lb/>are based on the premise that the output gap will close over the scenario&apos;s horizon (by 2012), while <lb/>unemployment converges to the structural unemployment rate. Commodity prices and exchange rates are <lb/>held fixed in real terms, while the oil price declines from $54 at the end of 2007 to $44 per barrel by 2012. <lb/>Monetary policy aims at price stability, while fiscal policy remains unchanged, with the primary budget <lb/>balance virtually stable between 2007 and 2012 in most countries. Details can be found in the OECD <lb/>Economic Outlook 78 (2005). <lb/>5. <lb/>The debt profile is determined by the following equations: <lb/>Debt (t) = primary balance (t) + debt (t-1)*(1+ r(t))/(1+g(t)) with r(t) being the nominal interest rate at t and <lb/>g(t) nominal growth of GDP. With no improvement in the primary budget, lower inflation tends to lower <lb/>the growth of nominal GDP, which offsets the effect of lower interest rates. In this case public debt will <lb/>change little with respect to the baseline. If, however, nominal growth declines more than interest rates, a <lb/>snow-ball effect will raise indebtedness, even if there is no deterioration in the primary budget balance. <lb/></body>

			<body>Effects of a rise in participation <lb/>23. <lb/>Figure 5 allows a comparison of these first results with a simulation of an increase in labour force <lb/>participation. Considerable room for increases also exist in this domain, especially by sharpening <lb/>incentives for young and older workers to work and by removing obstacles to participation by females <lb/>(Burniaux et al., 2003). In this simulation it is assumed that changes in incentives push up trend <lb/>participation by 1 percentage point gradually over eight years. As in the earlier case, domestic demand and <lb/>net exports rise. The rise in participation leads, however, to some rise in unemployment, which leads to <lb/>lower real wages and inflation, which stimulates competitiveness and employment and finally disposable <lb/>income. Demand is, however, initially not rising as fast as supply, so that the output gap is higher for some <lb/>years. The budgetary situation also improves in this simulation, while the debt/GDP ratio remains close to <lb/>the baseline. The improvement of the budgetary situation is likely however to be somewhat <lb/>underestimated. Especially a rise in the participation of older workers would reduce spending on early <lb/>retirement, while unemployment should return to the baseline level over the longer term. <lb/>Effects of a decline in structural unemployment <lb/>24. <lb/>Also a decline in structural unemployment would raise the employment rate and potential output. <lb/>This is illustrated by a third simulation which reduces structural unemployment gradually by 1 percentage <lb/>point over the first three years. The increase in potential output is thus concentrated in these years and <lb/>initially the output gap widens by more than in the other simulations. This leads to a larger real wage and <lb/>inflation deceleration than in the other two simulations (Figure 5). This stimulates employment, <lb/>profitability and competitiveness and leads to stronger internal and external demand. The budgetary <lb/>improvement is somewhat stronger than in the preceding cases. This is because of lower unemployment. In <lb/>conjunction with the effect of lower interest rates on the budget, also the debt/GDP ratio declines <lb/>somewhat. <lb/>ECO/WKP(2006)21 <lb/></body>

			<body>25. <lb/>The simulations show the positive medium-term effects of the reforms on the government budget, <lb/>with the gains being larger in the simulations that show a stronger improvement in the primary budget <lb/>balance. However, the effects on indebtedness are minor, because of the deceleration in inflation induced <lb/>by the reforms. A more accommodating monetary policy would contribute to improve the budgetary results <lb/>further. The central role of monetary policy in accompanying the reforms is shown by simulations that <lb/>again reduce the structural unemployment rate, but now under alternative monetary policy assumptions. <lb/>The first assumes that real interest rates decline as well as the exchange rate, while the other assumes that <lb/>nominal interest rates and exchange rates stay at the baseline level. <lb/>26. <lb/>The simulation shown in Figure 6 suggests that an easier monetary policy would stimulate <lb/>demand considerably. It is assumed that real interest rates are about 100 basis points below the baseline <lb/>level on average over the simulation period, while the euro is assumed to decline by 5% in real effective <lb/>terms. 6 The effects on external and internal demand would push the output gap above the baseline level, <lb/>which would limit the deceleration of inflation. The budgetary improvement would be considerably <lb/>stronger, in terms of deficits and of debt developments. Concerning the latter, the impact of the <lb/>improvement in the primary deficit of lower interest rates is not offset by the disinflationary effect and the <lb/>debt/GDP ratio would decline by 10 percentage points with respect to the baseline at the end of the <lb/>simulation period. <lb/>27. <lb/>If, on the other hand, nominal interest rates and exchange rates are kept at their baseline values, <lb/>the higher real interest rates dampen demand considerably and the output gap remains larger than in the <lb/>baseline scenario throughout the simulation period (Figure 6). With activity weaker and unemployment <lb/>higher, the improvement in the primary deficit is much slower to come, while nominal GDP rises by less <lb/>because of lower inflation. The debt/GDP ratio deteriorates considerably as the snow-ball effect is <lb/>reinforced by lower inflation. <lb/>6. <lb/>In this simulation the exchange rate is assumed to respond to both inflation and interest rates developments. <lb/>On the one hand, an exchange rate purchasing power parity rule applies in the long term, implying stable <lb/>real effective exchanges rates. On the other hand, the lower real interest rates in the euro area induce a real <lb/>depreciation of the euro exchange rate at least for some time. <lb/>ECO/WKP(2006)21 <lb/></body>

			<body>Structural reform in a single country in monetary union <lb/>28. <lb/>In the previous set of simulations it was assumed that all countries embark on structural reforms <lb/>simultaneously. However, this may not occur in reality, which raises the issue whether the incentives for <lb/>(or reward of) structural reform is sufficiently strong for individual countries. There may also be a divide <lb/>between small and big countries in this regard, due to the difference in openness of their respective <lb/>economies. <lb/>Effects of a decline in structural unemployment <lb/>29. <lb/>The importance of monetary policy in facilitating the adjustment of demand to a rise in supply <lb/>and for improving budget balances leads to questions about the reforms pursued by a single country in the <lb/>euro area. This divide appears clearly when simulating the impact of a gradual decline in the structural <lb/>unemployment rate by 1½ percentage points over three years in a small (Belgium) and a large (France) <lb/>country. They are based on the same assumption as above: the nominal interest rate and the exchange rate <lb/>are fixed at the baseline level. The results show a marked contrast between the two countries. <lb/>30. <lb/>The small country, because of its much greater openness to trade, benefits much more from the <lb/>competitiveness gains, which allows a more rapid adjustment of demand and limits the deceleration in <lb/>inflation (Figure 7). The effect of the reform is positive for the budget balance, though the effect on <lb/>indebtedness is minor. <lb/>31. <lb/>In contrast, the adjustment path for the large country is much more drawn-out (Figure 8). The <lb/>impact of higher real interest rates tends to neutralise the competitiveness gains due to lower inflation. <lb/>Overall, the output gap remains below the baseline level over the whole simulation period. The budget <lb/>balance hardly improves, while indebtedness is rising. However, significantly lower inflation in a large <lb/>country will affect area-wide inflation, which could lead to some monetary easing. If the interest rate were <lb/>to decline in line with overall inflation, the budget balance would improve by more. <lb/>32. <lb/>These simulation results are, of course, model dependent. The weak endogenous adjustment <lb/>forces in the case of reforms of a single large euro area economy could be exaggerated. It can not be <lb/>excluded that a better macroeconomic performance, and especially lower unemployment, would lead to <lb/>substantial confidence effects, which are not included in the model. These could lead to greater dynamism <lb/>of consumption and investment. The reaction of the US economy to the productivity shock during the <lb/>1990s suggests that demand can outstrip supply, following a supply shock. 7 On the other hand, one should <lb/>not underestimate either the role played by the US monetary authorities, which recognized and <lb/>accompanied the structural changes. Also the depth and flexibility of the American financial markets were <lb/>crucial in allowing a rapid transmission of the associated wealth gains onto demand. <lb/>7. <lb/>This would follow Say&apos;s law, which suggests that supply will create its demand. But the American <lb/>situation even suggests what Val Koromzay dubbed Super-Say&apos;s law, whereby a more optimistic outlook <lb/>on future income can lead to excess demand, when supply conditions improve. <lb/></body>

			<body>Effects of a decline in structural unemployment with a more active fiscal policy <lb/>33. <lb/>A final set of simulations is designed to examine the role of upfront cost, and more generally to <lb/>look at the possibility that countries use a more activist fiscal policy to accompany their structural reform <lb/>programme. A rise in potential output due to a decline in structural unemployment improves the structural <lb/>budget balance. In the absence of monetary policy, euro area member countries may be tempted to use the <lb/>room for fiscal manoeuvre to accompany reforms to speed up the adjustment of demand to the improved <lb/>supply conditions. Moreover, the reforms could have a budgetary cost, for instance because they include a <lb/>cut in social security contributions. <lb/>34. <lb/>To illustrate the joint effect of a decline in structural unemployment and of a more active fiscal <lb/>policy two scenarios were run for France. The first assumes that the structural budget balance is kept at the <lb/>baseline level. The second assumes that the decline in unemployment is accompanied by a permanent <lb/>reduction in employers&apos; social security contributions by ½ per cent of GDP. The results are presented in <lb/>Figure 9. They clearly show the limits of loosening fiscal policy to accompany structural reforms: the <lb/>macroeconomic gains are very limited, but the budget deteriorates significantly. <lb/> &quot; Big bangs &quot; and gradualism: the experiences of New Zealand and Australia <lb/>35. <lb/>Some OECD economies have undergone radical transformations with major fiscal implications <lb/>and their recent economic histories are consistent with the findings from the above model-based analysis. <lb/>New Zealand is a prime example. It initiated radical and wide-ranging reforms in the mid-1980s. These <lb/>reforms encompassed both macroeconomic stabilisation and structural change (Evans et al., 1996). The <lb/>reforms followed a decade of anaemic growth, with even lower rates than those currently observed in the <lb/>euro area, while inflation was rampant and the current account in deep deficit (Table 3). <lb/>Table 3.

			<body>36. <lb/>Key reforms included financial market deregulation and the granting of operational independence <lb/>to the Reserve Bank; deep labour market reforms, though they were only enacted from the early 1990s <lb/>onwards; and telecommunication and electricity reforms. These reforms did not include any <lb/>side-payments, but there were many reforms affecting the budget directly. Support to manufacturing <lb/>industries and agriculture was withdrawn, which lowered spending, but also lowered revenues due to hefty <lb/>tariff cuts on industrial products. Direct government assistance to industry and agriculture declined from <lb/>16% of primary government spending to just 4% in 1993/94. At the same time, tax policy put a sharp focus <lb/>on the neutrality of the tax system: a comprehensive value added tax replaced a myriad of sales taxes, <lb/>while the corporate and income tax base was broadened and tax rates reduced. Tax incentives concerning <lb/>exports or retirement savings were abolished. On the spending side, focus was put on organisational and <lb/>managerial devolution and improved accountability, for instance in health and education. Chief executives <lb/>became responsible for managing departments, being directly accountable to their Ministers for hitting <lb/>specific output targets. Moreover, the large number of trading departments was turned into state-owned <lb/>enterprises, many of which were subsequently sold. <lb/>37. <lb/>Stronger growth did not help fiscal consolidation early in the reform era. Partly reflecting heavy <lb/>industrial and agricultural restructuring and job losses from rapid efficiency gains, GDP barely increased <lb/>between 1984 and 1991 (Table 3). Also the exchange rate and real interest rate were high. Early in the <lb/>reforms, consolidation was largely achieved by revenue increases and while some spending items were <lb/>pruned severely, spending on health, education and social services increased as a share of GDP. But <lb/>stronger growth followed and a fiscal surplus was achieved in the 1993/94 financial year. Fiscal <lb/>performance has been strong since then, the government recording a deficit in only one year since 1994 <lb/>and a net debt position of more than 50% of GDP has swung into a net asset position. This successful fiscal <lb/>consolidation partly reflects a decent, though not outstanding, growth performance and partly the <lb/>principled approach to fiscal management that was put in place in 1994, based on responsibility and <lb/>transparency. This approach has been taken up in the UK&apos;s code of fiscal conduct and the OECD Best <lb/>Practices for Budget Transparency. Macroeconomic policy was set to provide a stable and sound <lb/>framework for fiscal policy rather than stabilise macroeconomic outcomes with short-term adjustments to <lb/>the fiscal stance. <lb/>38. <lb/>Reforms in New Zealand since the mid-1980s were broad ranging and quick, in the wake of large <lb/>macroeconomic imbalances. By tackling many areas quickly there was no stable coalition formed to <lb/>oppose reforms: for instance, farmers who had their subsidies withdrawn, 8 strongly supported tariff cuts; <lb/>and farmers and other businesses then put pressure on the government to reduce spending to bring down <lb/>the interest and exchange rate. But moving quickly also led to some backlashes, as the reform process <lb/>stalled between 1988 and 1991, from when onward it resumed again. The experience highlights that fiscal <lb/>consolidation and radical change can go hand in hand, even when the results of reforms on economic <lb/>performance do not come quickly. <lb/>39. <lb/>In contrast with New Zealand, the Australian reform process was gradual, but it was also <lb/>principled and coherent (Banks, 2005). As in New Zealand, policy prior to the reforms was characterised <lb/>by being highly regulated, anti-competitive and redistributive, even though the macroeconomic <lb/>background, while not brilliant, was more benign (Table 4). Productivity growth of just over 1% between <lb/>1973 and 1990 was relatively poor and, also affected by terms of trade losses, the international <lb/>income-per-capita ranking slipped badly. Though reforms started in 1973 with a 25% across-the-board <lb/>8. <lb/>The largest farmer association, the Federated Farmers of New Zealand argue that the sudden and <lb/>unexpected removal of subsidies have made the farming sector stronger and that farmers are determined <lb/>never again to be dependent upon government handouts (Federated Farmers of New Zealand, 2002). <lb/>Productivity gains, for instance, moved from 1% pre-reform to nearly 6% post-reform, while the initial <lb/>impact of the reform, while sizeable, was much milder than officially projected. <lb/></body>

			<body>tariff cut, this precipitated a heavy backlash against reforms. It was not before 1988 that tariff reductions <lb/>were phased in with virtually all tariffs falling to below 5% by 1996. The early 1980s also saw financial <lb/>market reforms. Increased competition led to pressure to reform labour markets and sheltered sectors. The <lb/>reforms ultimately embraced all product markets, factor markets and the public sector, including as in <lb/>New Zealand the commercialisation, corporatisation and privatisation of many government enterprises. <lb/>Table 4.

			<body>40. <lb/>Contrary to New Zealand, Australia adopted a gradual approach to reforms, thus avoiding heavy <lb/>initial adjustment costs. The programme evolved in a cumulative way to encompass reforms across much <lb/>of the economy. Moreover, and again contrary to New Zealand, reforms were accompanied by retraining <lb/>schemes and displaced workers could rely on the relatively generous welfare safety net. Adjustment costs <lb/>were also eased by sector-specific restructuring and assistance schemes, which amounted to AUD 600 <lb/>million annually under the Automotive Competitiveness and Investment Scheme. Similarly, when price <lb/>support for the milk industry was abolished in 2000, farmers were provided with a substantial stream of <lb/>payments, financed by a levy on milk consumers. Also regional policy schemes eased the adjustment blow <lb/>in some cases. Policy has thus dealt with the front-loaded timing of the potential losses of reforms as well <lb/>as the fact that costs of reform are often concentrated on particular groups. The reform process had a fiscal <lb/>cost, but it was limited and easily outweighed by the overall gains: concomitant with the reforms, there was <lb/>a sharp rise in the trade to GDP ratio and business R&amp;D surged, boosting productivity growth to among the <lb/>highest in the OECD and the income-per-capita ranking improved from the 15 th place in the mid-1980s to <lb/>the 8 th currently. Not surprisingly, fiscal performance improved a lot as well: the general government <lb/>balance swung from a deficit peak in the early 1990s of more than 6% of GDP into a surplus by 1998. The <lb/>fiscal balance has stayed in surplus since then, except in one year, leading to the elimination of government <lb/>net debt in the course of 2006. <lb/>41. <lb/>Clearly, for both countries the evidence is that major structural reforms brought a major <lb/>improvement in fiscal performance. Yet, how to apportion the success between a strengthening in <lb/>budgetary institutions and better growth performance is unclear. <lb/></body>

			<body>Policy implications <lb/>42. <lb/>The recent reform of the Stability and Growth Pact provides more leeway for EU governments to <lb/>temporarily breach the 3% deficit limit if this can be shown to facilitate the implementation of effective, <lb/>but initially expensive, structural reform. While this principle is underpinned by a clear economic rationale, <lb/>its implementation is not obvious. Indeed, for it to be properly implemented a number of conditions will <lb/>have to be met: <lb/>• Budgets would need to clearly identify the structural policy measures that are being taken and <lb/>specify their immediate and multi-annual budgetary cost and benefit profile. So far, this is not <lb/>happening in a systematic way, with probably the United Kingdom being at the frontier (and even <lb/>there the picture is not always clear). Indeed, the Commission in its assessment of the most recent <lb/>batch of stability programmes suggested that the clause related to structural reforms would <lb/>benefit from a clear specification of the quantitative information necessary for assessing the <lb/>impact of structural reforms (EC, 2006).<lb/>• Budgets would also need to be explicit about the fiscal cost of inaction, i.e., report the budgetary <lb/>developments in the absence of structural reform. This is a form of transparency that is necessary <lb/>for the European authorities to call a balanced judgment on countries&apos; trade-offs between the <lb/>various options available, like reforming health care but not pensions, or any other combination <lb/>of reform programmes. However, it is rare to find such information in budgets.<lb/>• Budgets would, finally, need to give some indication of the broader economic effects of action or <lb/>inaction, in order to be able to call a judgment on the ex ante effectiveness and efficiency of the <lb/>proposed measures. However ex ante cost-benefit analysis is rare – not to mention ex post <lb/> cost-benefit analysis. The experience in countries like New Zealand and Australia has shown that <lb/>the longer-term benefits both in terms of the budget and overall economic performance may be <lb/>significant. Even so, it is not easy to disentangle the various forces at play. Fundamentally, <lb/>structural reform and the implementation of smart fiscal frameworks tend to go hand in hand – <lb/>indeed may be two sides of the same coin.<lb/>43. <lb/>The simulation exercises highlight the positive budgetary effects of coordinated structural <lb/>reforms in the euro area. But they have to be accompanied by an adequate monetary policy response to <lb/>make sure that demand adjusts to the improved supply conditions swiftly. The budgetary gains would still <lb/>depend on the type of reform and their impact on employment and productivity. Efforts to improve supply <lb/>conditions are surely easier to co-ordinate or coordinated in any case, when it comes to single market <lb/>initiatives, such as the current drive to liberalise services across the European Union. Co-ordination is more <lb/>difficult to achieve for labour market reforms. In this domain, national policy initiatives by a single country <lb/>may only have a limited impact, especially in the short term and in the case of a large country. Indeed, in <lb/>monetary union, the strength of endogenous adjustment mechanism appears to be weaker in larger <lb/>countries. Moreover, if reforms were to be accompanied by an easing of fiscal policy, additional <lb/>macroeconomic gains would also appear very limited. <lb/>ECO/WKP(2006)21 <lb/></body>
