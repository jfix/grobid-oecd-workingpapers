			<figure>Ce document décrit et évalue les politiques de prix et de remboursement des médicaments au Canada,<lb/> en les situant dans le contexte politique et l&apos;environnement de marché dans lesquels elles s&apos;inscrivent ; et<lb/> en observant leur rôle dans l&apos;atteinte des objectifs relatifs à la politique pharmaceutique canadienne. Le<lb/> gouvernement fédéral régule les prix des médicaments brevetés dans le but de protéger les consommateurs<lb/> de prix excessifs. Cette régulation a très probablement eu pour effet d&apos;amener les prix des médicaments<lb/> brevetés canadiens au niveau des prix des pays européens auxquels le Canada se compare. Les prix des<lb/> médicaments génériques, qui ne sont pas régulés, sont relativement élevés malgré une forte pénétration des<lb/> génériques sur les marchés. Tous les Canadiens sont couverts pour les médicaments fournis à l&apos;hôpital par<lb/> un système public qui fournit gratuitement tous les services hospitaliers et médicaux. Les médicaments<lb/> dispensés dans le secteur ambulatoire ne sont pas inclus dans le panier des services couverts au titre de la<lb/> Loi Canadienne sur la santé. Par conséquent, deux tiers des Canadiens, dont la plupart des salariés et leurs<lb/> familles, obtiennent une couverture médicament par les assurances privées, tandis que beaucoup de<lb/> personnes âgées, ainsi que certains groupes vulnérables de la population, sont couverts par des plans<lb/> publics provinciaux, territoriaux ou fédéraux. Dans la plupart des cas, les patients participent aux dépenses<lb/> de médicaments remboursables selon diverses modalités (forfait, co-assurance), parfois assorties de<lb/> franchises. Le manque de protection contre le risque de dépenses catastrophiques de médicament reste un<lb/> problème pour une petite partie de la population canadienne, concentrée dans les provinces atlantiques.<lb/> Reflétant l&apos;ensemble de ces modalités de couverture et de remboursement, 54% des dépenses de<lb/> médicaments sont financées par les assurances privées et les ménages. Les dépenses de médicaments ont<lb/> augmenté rapidement au cours des dernières années. Le management des listes de médicaments<lb/> remboursables, à présent facilité par une initiative gouvernementale pour entreprendre une évaluation<lb/> centralisée des médicaments, et la promotion de la substitution par les génériques, ont été les principaux<lb/> leviers utilisés par les plans publics pour améliorer l&apos;efficience des dépenses de médicament. Les plans<lb/> privés couvraient, par le passé, tous les médicaments autorisés à la vente au Canada, mais ceci est en train<lb/> de changer sous la pression des coûts. Dans l&apos;ensemble, les nouveaux médicaments sont disponibles sur le<lb/> marché Canadien dans des délais satisfaisants mais le maintien de bonnes conditions de disponibilité et<lb/> d&apos;accessibilité financière pourrait devenir un défi.<lb/> Codes JEL : I18, I11<lb/> Mots-clés : Politique du médicament ; prix et remboursement ; marché pharmaceutique ; Canada<lb/> TABLE OF CONTENTS<lb/> ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS.</figure>

			<p>Successive legislations enacted at the federal level permitted the provision of universal coverage<lb/> for hospital care (1957) and for physician services (1966) to the Canadian population through federal and<lb/> provincial cost-sharing. These two federal Acts were combined and updated in the Canada Health Act<lb/> (1984) which sets forth conditions and criteria that must be satisfied by provincial and territorial health<lb/> care plans in order for them to be eligible for federal funding. In this decentralized health system,<lb/> provinces and territories are responsible for the management, organisation and delivery of hospital and<lb/> physician services and may offer supplemental coverage for other medical goods and services, including<lb/> prescription drugs furnished outside of the hospital, for all or part of their residents The federal government<lb/> currently co-finances health expenditures of provinces and territories through earmarked cash and tax<lb/> transfers. Provincial and territorial governments raise other funds through taxation and determine the<lb/> appropriate allocation of resources within the health system.<lb/> 2.<lb/> The regulation of the pharmaceutical sector rests on several levels. Federal regulation of the<lb/> pharmaceutical sector focuses on two objectives: protecting the Canadian population against safety-related<lb/> risks and protecting consumers against excessive patented drug prices. Policies pertaining to drug coverage<lb/> have been developed and administered mainly under the authority of provinces and territories, while<lb/> responsibility for ensuring appropriate use of drugs rests mostly with health professionals.<lb/></p>

			<p>3.<lb/> This report is the first in a series of case studies aimed at describing and analysing<lb/> pharmaceutical policies used in selected OECD countries. These case studies are part of a broader OECD<lb/> project on the impact of pharmaceutical pricing and reimbursement policies. The main objective of this<lb/> paper is to describe and analyse policies at the federal and provincial/territorial level pertaining to the<lb/> prices of pharmaceuticals in Canada, and, as far as possible, to assess their effects at the national level.<lb/> 4.<lb/> Since these policies cannot be considered in isolation from other policies and contextual<lb/> elements, this paper also takes account of the main policies pertaining to the pharmaceutical sector in<lb/> Canada and the characteristics of its pharmaceutical sector before offering an assessment as to how well<lb/> policy goals are being achieved and what role pharmaceutical policies have played in this respect.<lb/></p>

			<head>1. THE POLICY ENVIRONMENT<lb/></head>

			<p>5.<lb/> This section describes pharmaceutical pricing and reimbursement policies in Canada, as well as<lb/> some of the most important related policies and practices concerning pharmaceuticals, including marketing<lb/> approvals, coverage, policies to influence pharmaceutical use and policies intended to promote innovation<lb/> in the pharmaceutical and other sectors.<lb/></p>

			<head>1.1. Pharmaceutical product regulatory review procedures and outcomes<lb/></head>

			<p>6.<lb/> The pharmaceutical product approval process is an important determinant of key policy<lb/> outcomes, including product availability, patient safety, health outcomes and manufacturer returns on<lb/> investment in research and product development.<lb/></p>

			<head>7.<lb/> In accordance with the Food and Drugs Act</head>

			<p>and related regulations, Health Canada is responsible<lb/> for regulating the safety, efficacy and quality of drug products. The Therapeutic Products Directorate of the<lb/> Health Products and Food Branch (HPFB), a branch of the Department of Health (Health Canada), is in<lb/> charge of reviewing new drugs for licensing and labelling.<lb/> 8.<lb/> Sponsors file market licensing applications and supporting documentation for proposed new<lb/> products. Drugs are reviewed by HPFB in-house experts, who collaborate with outside experts to assess<lb/> their safety, efficacy and quality. At the end of the review process, Health Canada may grant a marketing<lb/> authorisation or &quot; Notice of Compliance (NOC) &quot; , which indicates that the drug under review has met it s<lb/> safety, efficacy and quality requirements.<lb/> 9.<lb/> Sponsors may ask for priority review for promising drugs used for life-threatening or severely<lb/> debilitating conditions such as cancer, AIDS, or Parkinson&apos;s disease, for which few or no other effective<lb/> therapies are available on the market. In certain circumstances, conditional approval for marketing may be<lb/> granted to expedite access to potentially life-saving drugs (with the same eligibility criteria as priority<lb/> review drugs) under the Notice of Compliance with Conditions (NOC/c) policy. An NOC/c authorizes the<lb/> manufacturer to market a drug on condition that the manufacturer undertakes additional studies to<lb/> demonstrate the drug&apos;s clinical benefit. Conditions associated with approval allow the HPFB to monitor the<lb/> safety and effectiveness of the drug through enhanced post-market surveillance 1 .<lb/> 10.<lb/> An abbreviated procedure is used to assess generic products, mainly based on comparative<lb/> bioavailability studies aimed at showing that the generic product is as safe and as effective as the brand-<lb/>name product.<lb/> 11.<lb/> Canada has faced criticism for lengthy approval times. Comparative data from the<lb/> pharmaceutical industry suggest that the average time from a manufacturer&apos;s application to market<lb/> approval over the 1999-2003 period was notably longer in Canada than in 10 of 12 other OECD countries<lb/> supplying data (<ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>). Australia, at 18.2 months, was closest to Canada&apos;s 19-month average. The only<lb/> country with longer average delays was Japan.<lb/></p>

Performance targets<lb/> were set for review delays, ranging from 120 to 300 days, depending on the type of drug. As of August<lb/> 2006, Health Canada eliminated the backlog in pharmaceuticals and has made progress in meeting<lb/> internationally-comparable drug review targets for pharmaceuticals (<ref type="biblio">Health Canada, 2006</ref>) and intends to<lb/> meet them for biologics within the next year 2 . Consequently, average and median review times in Canada<lb/> have declined significantly since 2003 (<ref type="biblio">Health Canada, 2006, p. 18-19</ref>).<lb/> 13.<lb/> In addition to its responsibilities pertaining to drug marketing approval, Health Canada also<lb/> monitors the safety, efficacy and quality of therapeutic products once they reach the market (See Box 1).<lb/> Reports of suspected problems can be received from manufacturers, health care professionals and<lb/> consumers, which Health Canada evaluates to determine appropriate action if a serious health risk is<lb/> identified. Such actions can range from issuing warnings to the public and the health care community, to<lb/> removing a product from the market.<lb/> 14.<lb/> Under authority of the federal Food and Drugs Act, decisions as to whether a drug is to be sold<lb/> by prescription or over-the-counter (OTC) are based on the list of medicinal ingredients in Schedule F of<lb/> the Food and Drug Regulations. Ingredients listed on Schedule F cannot be purchased without<lb/> prescription. The Drug Schedule Status Committee determines the necessity for prescription status for<lb/> medicinal ingredients on the basis of established and publicly available criteria. These criteria include, but<lb/> are not limited to, concerns related to toxicity, pharmacological properties and therapeutic uses of the<lb/> ingredients. Some prescription drugs, such as narcotics, are subject to further control pursuant to the<lb/> Controlled Drugs and Substances Act. In 2006, about 20,750 human drugs are available in Canada, of<lb/> which 6,400 are prescription-only medications 3 ; 1,090 are &quot; ethicals &quot; , which do not need prescription but<lb/> are generally prescribed by physicians; 8,429 are OTC drugs and 4,846 are in the category called Natural<lb/> Health Products (includes vitamins, minerals, herbal products, and homeopathic medicines). Provinces<lb/> may impose further restrictions on drug dispensing.<lb/></p>

			<head>Box 1. Drug safety monitoring and consumer protection<lb/></head>

			<p>Several databases used in drug safety monitoring are available on Health Canada&apos;s website. The Drug Product<lb/> Database presents basic information on drug products (name, Drug Identification Number, prescription status). The<lb/> Notice of Compliance database presents the list of drugs authorized to be marketed. The MedEffect Web site provides<lb/> access to the latest advisories, warnings and recalls issued by Health Canada concerning therapeutic drugs as well as<lb/> other marketed health products including natural health products and medical devices. Adverse reactions can be<lb/> reported by individuals.<lb/> A new medication incident reporting and prevention system, now in the design stages, is intended to strengthen<lb/> the capacity to report, analyse and manage medication incident data on a national basis, while mounting<lb/> comprehensive prevention and education programs for healthcare practitioners. The system, known as the Canadian<lb/> Medication Incident Reporting and Prevention System, relies on voluntary reports of incident data and is currently<lb/> being phased in.<lb/></p>

			<head>15.<lb/></head>

			<p>Health Canada also administers a Special Access Programme (SAP), which authorises the sale of<lb/> drugs that have not been licensed in Canada, including drugs that are available in other countries or are still<lb/> in development. 4 This program is reserved for patients with a serious or life-threatening disease, when<lb/> alternatives have failed or are not available in the Canadian market. In 2005, the SAP received and<lb/> processed approximately 30,000 requests. About 23,000 authorisations and 100-200 denials were issued.<lb/> An additional 5,000-7,000 requests were returned because they were considered incomplete.<lb/></p>

			<head>1.2. Pricing<lb/></head>

			<p>16.<lb/> Prices of off-patent original products and generic products are not regulated in Canada. Since<lb/> 1987, prices of patented medicines have been regulated at the federal level to ensure that they are not<lb/> &apos;excessive&apos;.<lb/></p>

			<head>1.2.1. General objectives and scope of pricing regulation<lb/></head>

			<p>17.<lb/> The Patented Medicine Prices Review Board (PMPRB) was created in 1987 through amendments<lb/> to the Patent Act. At that time, price regulation of patented pharmaceuticals was accepted by the brand-<lb/>name pharmaceutical industry in exchange for enhanced patent protection. 5 The PMPRB operates as an<lb/> independent, quasi-judicial body empowered to enforce sanctions and impose price reductions for patented<lb/> pharmaceutical products.<lb/> 18.<lb/> The PMPRB mandate is limited to the regulation of manufacturers&apos; prices of all patented drugs<lb/> for the duration of their patent life, whatever their status (available OTC or by prescription-only, for human<lb/> or veterinary use). The Board does not regulate off-patent drugs, and does not consider determinants of the<lb/> prices paid by consumers, such as wholesalers&apos; and pharmacists&apos; margins. The Board&apos;s authority extends<lb/> to the prices of existing drugs as well as new drugs. PMPRB must report annually to Parliament on its<lb/> activities, on R&amp;D spending by drug patentees and on drug pricing trends.<lb/> 19.<lb/> The PMPRB has the mandate to protect Canadian consumers by ensuring that the prices of<lb/> patented drugs sold in Canada are not excessive. In making this judgement the Board compares the<lb/> proposed Canadian price either to prices of existing drugs in Canada, or to prices in seven markets<lb/> designated in the regulations (France, Germany, Italy, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the<lb/> United States 6 ). Price increases are limited to changes in the Consumer Price Index. 7 In addition, the price<lb/> of a patented drug may, at no time, exceed the highest price of the same drug in the seven foreign<lb/> countries.<lb/> 20.<lb/> The &apos;excessive price&apos; criterion used in assessing the price of a new drug depends on the &apos;degree<lb/> of innovation&apos; of the new product (<ref type="biblio">PMPRB, 2003; PMPRB, 2006d</ref>), as categorised by the PMPRB using a<lb/> three-tiered scale.<lb/> • Category 1 comprises drug products that are a new strength (e.g., 50 mg v. 100 mg) or a new<lb/> dosage form (e.g., tablet v. capsule) of an existing medicine. The price is considered excessive if<lb/> it does not bear a &quot; reasonable relationship &quot; to the average price of the existing medicine in<lb/> comparable dosage forms.<lb/></p>

			<p>• Category 2 comprises drug products that represent a therapeutic breakthrough or provide<lb/> substantial improvement (including cost savings) over comparable existing medicines. The price<lb/> is excessive if it exceeds the prices of comparable products in the therapeutic class and the<lb/> international median price of the medicine.<lb/> • Category 3 comprises drug products that provide moderate, little or no therapeutic advantage<lb/> over comparable medicines. For these so-called &apos;me-too&apos; drugs, the price is judged excessive if it<lb/> exceeds the price of comparable products in the Canadian market. PMPRB may use the<lb/> international median price as a reference when it is impossible or inappropriate to identify<lb/> comparable drugs in Canada.<lb/> 21.<lb/> Drugs are classified in these three categories by experts of the Human Drug Advisory Panel<lb/> (HDAP) 8 , which reviews all the available information on the drug and its comparators, with reference to<lb/> 6<lb/> These comparator countries were selected as ones that had or aspired to have a strong national presence of<lb/> the pharmaceutical industry.<lb/> 7<lb/> To assess the compliance with this rule regarding price increases, the price of a product in year t is<lb/> compared to its price three years before, adjusted by 3-year cumulative CPI. In addition, the price cannot<lb/> increase by more than 1.5 times the CPI increase for a given year.<lb/> 8<lb/> The Human Drug Advisory Panel is composed of three designated members, chosen for their scientific<lb/> expertise in drug therapy, clinical research methodology, statistical analysis and the evaluation of new<lb/> drugs. HDAP also relies on scientific assessments made by PMPRB staff.<lb/> documents provided by the manufacturer and to published literature 9 . A drug&apos;s manufacturer suggests the<lb/> category that it believes is appropriate for considering the drug&apos;s price. The manufacturer also indicates the<lb/> drug&apos;s primary use, its comparators and their dosage regimens and, if relevant, the comparative therapeutic<lb/> class. Results of drug assessments have been published on the Internet since September 2001. 10<lb/> 22.<lb/> Manufacturers are requested to furnish price levels for four classes of customer (hospitals,<lb/> pharmacies, wholesalers and other) in all provinces of Canada, as well as prices in the seven comparator<lb/> countries, when relevant. Although the PMPRB considers the national Average Transaction Price (ATP), it<lb/> retains authority to act on the basis of any manufacturer&apos;s price found to be excessive for any class of<lb/> customer in any market in Canada.<lb/> 23.<lb/> In 2000, the PMPRB checked the validity of foreign prices provided by manufacturers for a<lb/> sample of 50 products. European prices observed by the PMPRB coincided in 85% of cases with European<lb/> prices provided by the manufacturer. Similarly, filed prices for the United States were equal to, or below<lb/> prices listed in the US Federal Supply Schedule 11 price in 82.5% of cases (PMPRB, 2002).<lb/> 24.<lb/> Upon the request of a manufacturer, the PMPRB will assess the price of a new drug prior to its<lb/> launch in the market and issue an Advance Ruling Certificate (ARC). This provides the manufacturer with<lb/> some assurance that the price proposed will not be found to exceed the maximum allowable price resulting<lb/> from the PMPRB&apos;s price guidelines. ARCs are non-binding for PMPRB, however. PMPRB issued one<lb/> ARC in 2004 and none in 2005.<lb/></p>

			<head>1.2.2. Consequences of excessive price<lb/></head>

			<p>25.<lb/> When the PMPRB considers a price to be excessive according to the criteria defined above, there<lb/> are two alternatives:<lb/> • If the company agrees to cut its price and to pay to the government of Canada some<lb/> compensation for the excess revenues earned, it must submit a Voluntary Compliance<lb/> Undertaking (VCU);<lb/></p>

			<p>• If the company does not agree with the PMPRB, the Board holds a public hearing to reconsider<lb/> the conclusion of excessive price and, if affirmed, make a judgment regarding penalty. If the<lb/> public hearing confirms that the price is excessive, the company may appeal to the Federal Court<lb/> of Canada to ask that the Board decision be overruled.<lb/> 26.<lb/> In 2005, the PMPRB reviewed the prices of 66 new patented drugs, of which 15 appeared to be<lb/> priced outside the guidelines and were subject to further investigation (PMPRB, 2006a).<lb/> 27.<lb/> In certain cases, the list price of the manufacturer is not altered, but the manufacturer gives some<lb/> guarantee to PMPRB that no customer in Canada will pay more than the maximum non-excessive price.<lb/> For instance, the</p>

			<table>Board accepted in 2004 a VCU from Sanofi Synthelabo for Fasturtec® (treatment and<lb/> 9<lb/> Guidelines for this scientific review, for the categorisation of drugs and for manufacturers&apos; submissions are<lb/> published in the Compendium of Guidelines, Policies and Procedures issued by PMPRB (PMPRB, 2003,<lb/> Chap 3, pp. 22-29).<lb/> 10<lb/> See http://www.pmprb-cepmb.gc.ca/english/view.asp?x=117&amp;mp=68 .<lb/> 11<lb/> The US Federal Supply Schedule presents prices negotiated between manufacturers and the US<lb/> Department of Veterans Affairs. The listed prices do not represent average paid prices in the United States,<lb/> but are among the lowest prices in the United States.<lb/></table>

			<p>prevention of hyperuricemia in paediatric and adult cancer patients), which proposed this kind of<lb/> arrangement. The company had been asked to lower its price by nearly 60%. Such a disconnection between<lb/> list price and actual paid price may be desired by a manufacturer who is concerned about the implications<lb/> of a relatively low Canadian list price for prices in other countries that use an external reference price<lb/> scheme for benchmarking, as Canada does. This arrangement does not present any advantage for Canadian<lb/> purchasers, but renders the price less attractive for potential US purchasers.<lb/> 28.<lb/> Investigations for excessive price increase are instigated when a price exceeds the maximum non-<lb/>excessive price by at least 5%, and/or when excessive revenues exceed a defined threshold ($50,000). In<lb/> 2005, the prices of about 1,043 existing drugs were reviewed by PMPRB, leading to 37 investigations and<lb/> 15 notices of hearings (PMPRB, 2006a).<lb/></p>

			<head>1.2.3. Impact of pricing regulation on Canadian drug prices<lb/></head>

			<p>29.<lb/> According to PMPRB estimates, Canadian prices have moved closer to median international<lb/> prices since price regulation commenced in 1987. In 1987, Canadian prices for patented medicines<lb/> exceeded the international median by more than 20%. After a fairly consistent annual decrease 12 until<lb/> 1994, the prices have since stabilized at or up to 10% below the median in seven comparator countries. In<lb/> 2005, prices of patented drugs in Canada were about 8% lower than the median prices of the seven<lb/> comparator countries 13 (see <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>).These data suggest that Canadian price regulation has had a<lb/> dampening effect on relative price levels in Canada, bringing them closer to the median price paid in a<lb/> selected set of countries.<lb/></p>

One study found that Canadian drug prices in 1999</table>

			<p>could be assessed as generally in line with<lb/> what would be predicted based on the country&apos;s income level (<ref type="biblio">Danzon and Furukawa, 2003</ref>). According to<lb/> the authors of this study, the finding that pharmaceutical price differences in many of the countries studied<lb/> roughly reflect the income differences across countries might result from the interaction of drug<lb/> manufacturers&apos; pricing strategies, using income as a proxy for demand elasticity, and regulation.<lb/> Nevertheless, the question of whether income is a suitable proxy for elasticity of pharmaceutical demand is<lb/> debatable, as elasticity may have other determinants (e.g., distribution of income, extent of out-of-pocket<lb/> payments for the purchase of pharmaceuticals, consumers&apos; preferences and appetite for drugs, etc.).<lb/> 31.<lb/> Reconciling the findings that price regulation has reduced Canada&apos;s price differential relative to<lb/> certain countries with the suggestion that Canada&apos;s prices are in line with income is difficult. One<lb/> hypothesis is that, prior to price regulation, Canada&apos;s prices had been relatively high due to the country&apos;s<lb/> geographic proximity to the United States, which features the highest patented drug prices in the world.<lb/> Price regulation has succeeded in offsetting the incentives for manufacturers to price higher in Canada to<lb/> reduce risks of cross-border trade. Supporting this hypothesis is a finding that prices in the other US<lb/> neighbouring country, Mexico, where price regulation is weak, are considerably higher than what would be<lb/> predicted based on income (<ref type="biblio">Danzon and Furukawa, 2003</ref>).<lb/> 32.<lb/> Certainly, it is apparent that, according to PMPRB criteria, manufacturers of drugs offering<lb/> significant new therapeutic benefits have a great deal of leeway to set prices at the levels of the highest-<lb/>priced countries in the world. On the other hand, Canada&apos;s policies ensure that prices of &quot; me-too &quot; drugs –<lb/> as well as prices of other drugs that offer moderate therapeutic advantages over existing therapies – are<lb/> restricted in price to the level of alternatives, where manufacturers might otherwise seek a premium.<lb/> 33.<lb/> Representatives of the pharmaceutical industry 14 claim that the PMPRB fails to fully recognize<lb/> and value innovation. They also blame the PMPRB for not adequately valuing product benefits fully and<lb/> for having refused price premia in cases where a new product offered enhanced patient comfort. They link<lb/> these problems to the small number of categories used to classify drugs, which do not allow regulators to<lb/> take into account refinements of incremental innovation. 15 The flip-side of this is that the PMPRB&apos;s<lb/> regulatory framework works to promote value for money as well in the sense that no premium is provided<lb/> for &apos;me too&apos; drugs just because they are new.<lb/> 34.<lb/> Whether or not the PMPRB has a significant constraining effect on average pharmaceutical price<lb/> levels in Canada, it is likely that the policies have other impacts. For example, the variation in price levels<lb/> seen across Canada may be more limited than would otherwise exist absent price regulation. Manufacturers<lb/> may sell products to some purchasers with limited market power at lower prices than those purchasers<lb/> could otherwise command because of concern about the PMPRB authority to assess not only average<lb/> prices paid, but to single out particular prices paid in particular geographic areas by particular purchasers.<lb/> 35.<lb/> Finally, the PMPRB process may in some cases provide perverse incentives, encouraging<lb/> manufacturers to keep list prices artificially high, for example. Manufacturers will not be willing to lower<lb/> their price, in case of increased competition for instance, if they believe that doing so will limit the amount<lb/> they can charge in the future for a new variant of the</p>

			<table>same drug.<lb/> 14<lb/> Personal communication with representatives of Rx&amp;D, the association of research-based, brand-name<lb/> companies.<lb/> 15<lb/> The PMPRB launched a consultation process in May 2006 in order to revise its guidelines for excessive<lb/> price assessment, in which the Board raises the question of a more refined categorisation of drugs<lb/> (PMPRB, 2006d).<lb/></table>

			<head>1.3. Coverage of pharmaceuticals<lb/></head>

			<p>36.<lb/> Coverage in Canada is distinct from many other OECD countries with respect to the significant<lb/> role of private insurance as a source of coverage for drugs prescribed for use outside the hospital setting.<lb/> Another notable characteristic is the decentralisation of public drug program administration and delivery,<lb/> which is distributed among the country&apos;s 13 jurisdictions (10 provinces and 3 territories), plus certain drug<lb/> plans under federal jurisdiction. Finally, drug coverage in Canada has to be put in the context of free<lb/> provision of all medical services guaranteed by the Canadian Health Act.<lb/> 37.<lb/> Given the growing cost of medicines and the unpredictability of need, drug coverage is an<lb/> important determinant of the accessibility of medicines. Among the various public and private plans,<lb/> formulary restrictions, reimbursement policies and cost-sharing requirements have a role to play in<lb/> determining access.<lb/></p>

			<head>1.3.1. Forms of drug coverage in Canada<lb/></head>

			<p>38.<lb/> While drugs administered in hospitals are covered through the universal, publicly financed<lb/> Medicare programme, other prescription drugs are not included among the insured benefits guaranteed by<lb/> the Canada Health Act. Consequently, about two-thirds of Canadian residents are covered for prescription<lb/> drugs by private insurance obtained through their employer or purchased on an individual basis. Provinces<lb/> and territories administer publicly financed programmes to provide prescription drug coverage<lb/> concentrated on seniors, social assistance recipients (including disabled citizens), and persons with special<lb/> needs (e.g., high drug expenditures relative to income), while federal programmes exist for indigenous<lb/> persons (First Nations and Inuit peoples), veterans, Canadian Forces members, Royal Canadian Mounted<lb/> Police members, certain designated classes of immigrants, and inmates of federal penitentiaries, including<lb/> some former inmates on parole. According to the Auditor General of <ref type="biblio">Canada (2004)</ref>, about one million<lb/> Canadians are eligible for federal drug benefits and more than nine million people are covered by<lb/> provincial plans.<lb/> 39.<lb/> Thanks to publicly financed drug programs offered by most provinces and territories, including<lb/> catastrophic coverage programs existing in some provinces, many of those with greatest need for coverage<lb/> are able to obtain it. According to estimates for 2000, 98% of the Canadian population has some form of<lb/> public or private sector drug plan coverage that provides a degree of protection against severe drug<lb/> expenditures (Fraser Group, Tristat Resources, 2002, page 52). The 2% of the population which is not<lb/> insured against severe expenditures are concentrated in particular geographical areas, particularly in the<lb/> Atlantic Provinces 16 , where it is estimated that 1 in 4 residents lacks pharmaceutical coverage (Fraser<lb/> Group, Tristat resources, 2002).<lb/> 40.<lb/> Moreover, it was estimated in 1998 that 10% of the Canadian population was un-insured for<lb/> routine expenditures, in the sense that they would have to pay every dollar of the first CAN$1,000 if they<lb/> had to face such expenditures (Applied Management, Fraser Group, Tristat Resources, 2000).<lb/></p>

			<head>1.3.1.1. Private insurance<lb/></head>

			<p>41.<lb/> Private insurance policies offer health benefits designed to supplement the universal, publicly<lb/> financed benefits in Medicare. Drug costs are the major component of their expenditures (70%), but they<lb/> also cover some services in hospitals (such as private room supplements), as well as dental, eye-care,<lb/> paramedical and other professional care.<lb/> 16<lb/> Newfoundland and Labrador, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island<lb/> 42.<lb/> About 1,000 private plans cover two-thirds of the Canadian population. 17 Private plans may be<lb/> national, regional, or local in coverage, and enrolment tends to cater to those affiliated with particular<lb/> employers, or through membership in a professional order or association. Individual subscriptions to<lb/> private drug insurance plans are not common. In Québec, individual coverage is even prohibited.<lb/> Approximately 95% of private coverage in Canada is provided through group benefits plans.<lb/> 43.<lb/> The level of coverage by private insurance varies from one province to another, together with<lb/> employment conditions. According to <ref type="biblio">Luffman (2005)</ref>, high-wage and unionized workers are more likely<lb/> to have access to employer-sponsored private insurance.<lb/> 44.<lb/> Private plans are financed by premiums from their sponsors and from beneficiaries. In 2000, 45%<lb/> of employer-sponsored plans did not require enrolees to make any contribution to premiums<lb/> (Fraser/<ref type="biblio">Tristat, 2002</ref>). According to more recent estimates, employers normally pay about 70% of<lb/> premiums. However, employers are not required to offer this benefit. If an employer offers coverage, an<lb/> employee may be required to enrol (along with spouse and children).<lb/> 45.<lb/> Private health plans can be regulated by the provinces and territories, resulting in different<lb/> policies across Canada. For instance, while risk selection 18 is allowed in most provinces, it is prohibited in<lb/> Québec. Overall, regulation of private insurance is more stringent in Québec than in other provinces.<lb/> Indeed, since 1997, prescription drug insurance coverage has been compulsory for all Quebecers, either<lb/> through private plans or the public drug plan; as well, termination of coverage is regulated and insurers<lb/> have the obligation to pool risks in the private system. Private plans are further required to maintain<lb/> minimum coverage standards (they must be at least as generous as the provincial public plan in terms of<lb/> coverage and they have no latitude to deny claims). Québec also requires private plans to undertake<lb/> education and prevention activities in order to optimize drug coverage.<lb/></p>

			<head>1.3.1.2. Forms of public coverage for prescription drugs<lb/></head>

			<p>46.<lb/> Provinces and territories offer drug coverage to social assistance recipients and persons with<lb/> special needs. However, degrees of coverage vary across provinces and territories (see Box 2). Seniors are<lb/> universally eligible for public coverage (irrespective of income or other tests) in Alberta and Ontario, and<lb/> become eligible in Nova Scotia if they have no private drug coverage, Prince Edward Island, the Northwest<lb/> Territories and the Yukon Territory. Jurisdictions often provide drug coverage for patients requiring high-<lb/>cost treatments, either in the form of multiple specific plans defined for each disease (HIV, cystic fibrosis,<lb/> growth hormone deficiency, organ transplant, etc.) or in the form of coverage against catastrophic drug<lb/> expenditures. Some programmes cover drugs dispensed to home-care and long-term care patients.<lb/> 47.<lb/> Four provinces offer &apos;universal eligibility&apos; for public drug coverage: Alberta, Manitoba,<lb/> Saskatchewan and British Columbia. In Alberta, residents not covered by other plans may apply for<lb/> coverage in the public programs 19 (for which they are required to pay premiums 20 and co-payments). In the<lb/> three other provinces, all residents are entitled to enrol in the public plan but deductibles may dissuade<lb/> 17<lb/> Source: personnel communication with representatives of the Canadian Life and Health Insurance<lb/> Association (CLIHA).<lb/></p>

			<head>18<lb/></head>

			<p>Health insurers are authorised to accept or refuse enrolment according to characteristics of the candidate<lb/> and to vary the premium according to these characteristics (age, health status, gender...).<lb/> 19<lb/> Note that delivery of Alberta&apos;s programs is contracted out to a private insurer, Alberta Blue Cross.<lb/> 20<lb/> In Alberta, those over the age of 65 are eligible for premium-free coverage.<lb/> them from doing so, especially if they have high income and/or have access to more generous coverage<lb/> through private insurance.<lb/> 48.<lb/> Québec has achieved universal coverage by requiring that all residents who have no access to<lb/> private group insurance enrol in its public scheme, where income-dependent premiums are charged.<lb/> Further, everyone under age 65 who has access to a private plan is required to obtain the prescription drug<lb/> coverage provided by that plan. Persons who turn 65 and who have access to a private plan that offers<lb/> basic prescription drug coverage may either retain their private plan coverage or join the public plan.<lb/></p>

			<head>Box 2. Drug coverage in selected provinces and in the federal Non-insured Health Benefits programme<lb/></head>

			<p>In Ontario, the Ontario Drug Benefit program (ODB) offers drug coverage to Ontario residents who are beneficiaries of<lb/> the Ontario Health Insurance Plan (public coverage of medical services) and belong to one of the following categories:<lb/> people 65 years and older, residents of long-term care facilities, residents of homes for special care, people receiving<lb/> professional services under the Home Care programme, and recipients of social assistance programs. In addition, the<lb/> Trillium Drug Program (a catastrophic coverage program, i.e., covering high prescription drug costs in relation to net<lb/> household income) covers people whose drug expenditures exceed 3-4% of their income.<lb/></p>

			<p>In 2004, the ODB covered 2.9 million people (23% of the Ontario population) and other public programs (such as<lb/> federal programs) covered 246,000 people (2%). Another 7.5 million (58%) Ontario residents were covered by private<lb/> insurance, while 2.2 million people (17%) were uninsured (Government of <ref type="biblio">Ontario, 2006</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<head>In British Columbia</head>

			<p>, PharmaCare was launched in 1974 as a social assistance program for seniors and low-income<lb/> residents. PharmaCare now includes a variety of plans covering prescription drugs for eligible populations, including<lb/> permanent residents of long-term care facilities, recipients of income assistance, and children who qualify for aid.<lb/> Other plans provide coverage for those who meet eligibility criteria and require certain types of drugs, including<lb/> psychiatric drugs, palliative care drugs, treatments for cystic fibrosis, and HIV/AIDS. On the top of these plans, Fair<lb/> PharmaCare was introduced in May 2003 to improve the equity of financial assistance for purchase of prescription<lb/> drugs. It functions as a safety net, providing means-tested assistance for the purchase of prescription drugs. Every<lb/> British Columbia resident is eligible for this programme but people covered by private insurance have generally no<lb/> incentive to enrol unless they face exceptional drug expenditures since deductibles are high (deductibles are means-<lb/>tested: the annual deductible is 0 if the net family income is less than Can$15,000, 2% of the income if income is<lb/> between $15,000 and $30,000 and 3% beyond<lb/> 1 ).<lb/></p>

			<figure>In 2003, PharmaCare covered 899,700 people, i.e. 21.7% of the population of British Columbia, including more than<lb/> three-quarters of those residents aged 65 and older.<lb/></figure>

			<p>Québec implemented a universal drug coverage scheme in 1997 The system requires workers to subscribe to private<lb/> plans offered by their employer and provides publicly financed drug coverage for all residents who are not otherwise<lb/> covered by a private group insurance plan.<lb/></p>

			<p>The system is funded by various parties at different rates. For the public plan, the premium (paid through the<lb/> contributor&apos;s income tax return), deductible and co-pays that a resident pays depends on age, net family income, and if<lb/> they are recipients of certain social programs. Residents who have access to a private plan do not partake in the public<lb/> plan, but must also pay premiums, though how this is paid and the amount varies by plan.<lb/></p>

			<p>In 2005, 43% of Québec residents were covered by the public provincial scheme, either because they had no access<lb/> to private coverage (24%) or because they were entitled to public coverage (19%) as seniors or as social assistance<lb/> beneficiaries of the province&apos;s &quot; Employment Assistance Program &quot; . Almost all other residents are covered by private<lb/> insurance. The public regime requires the payment of a means-tested annual premium, ranging from $0 to $538,<lb/></p>

			<figure>above a revenue threshold (for the period July 2006 to June 2007).<lb/> The Non-insured Health Benefits (NIHB) is a federal program administered by Health Canada. Its aim is to &apos;support<lb/> First</figure>

			<p>Nations people and Inuit in reaching an overall health status that is comparable with other Canadians&apos; (NIHB<lb/> website), by covering health goods and services not covered through other private or provincial/territorial health<lb/> insurance plans. The NIHB program provides coverage for a specified range of drugs, dental care, vision care, medical<lb/> supplies and equipment, short-term crisis intervention and mental health counselling. Drug coverage is its most<lb/> important component, representing more than 44% of NIHB&apos;s expenditures.<lb/></p>

			<p>The NIHB program covers about 765,000 people. The enrolled population is rather young. The average age is 29<lb/> years and only 4.5% of those are more than 65 years (Health Canada, 2004, page 10).<lb/> ______________<lb/></p>

			<head>1.3.2. Formularies<lb/></head>

			<p>49.<lb/> A drug&apos;s inclusion in a formulary, or list of medicines eligible for reimbursement by a third-party<lb/> payer, is an important determinant of the accessibility of that medicine to persons covered by the<lb/> insurance. In Canada, where hospital care – including medicines furnished to hospital patients on an<lb/> inpatient basis – is covered by Medicare, individual hospitals are responsible for developing their own<lb/> formularies. Private insurers are free to draw up their own formularies. 21 Provinces make their own<lb/> decisions regarding the formularies used by provincial drug plans.<lb/></p>

			<head>1.3.2.1. Hospital formularies<lb/></head>

			<p>50.<lb/> Hospitals establish their own formularies through a Pharmaceuticals and Therapeutics Committee<lb/> (P&amp;T Committee) composed of physicians, pharmacists, and in many cases, nurses. The P&amp;T Committee<lb/> is usually a sub-committee of the Medical Advisory Committee to whom the P&amp;T makes its<lb/> recommendations. Formularies are adapted to the hospital&apos;s activities and patient profile. The hospital<lb/> formulary may include drugs not yet approved by Health Canada but judged likely to be accessible for<lb/> certain patients through the Special Access Programme.<lb/></p>

			<head>1.3.2.2. Private plans<lb/></head>

			<p>51.<lb/> Private coverage tends to be more inclusive in terms of the number of products covered for<lb/> reimbursement, as compared with the publicly financed plans. Many private plans offer open access to all<lb/> drugs licensed for marketing by Health Canada, while others cover only drugs listed on a more restrictive<lb/> formulary, reflecting growing concerns from employers about growth in benefit cost. Some private plans<lb/> are reportedly beginning to experiment with the use of formularies which mirror those of public drug plans,<lb/> while others offer employers various options in terms of formularies. Generally speaking, private plans<lb/> have the option to reference public plan formularies for coverage decisions, or to maintain their own.<lb/> However, in Québec all plans are required to offer coverage at least equal to the public formulary.<lb/></p>

			<head>1.3.2.3. The Common Drug Review<lb/></head>

			<p>52.<lb/> Following the recommendations of the Commission on the Future of Health Care in <ref type="biblio">Canada<lb/> (2002)</ref>, also known as the Romanow Commission, a Common Drug Review (CDR) was launched in 2003.<lb/> The CDR is an intergovernmental 22 collaborative body which aims at evaluating new chemical entities<lb/> (NCEs) and new combinations to inform an official recommendation as to whether a drug should be<lb/> included in the formularies of participating publicly financed drug plans.<lb/> 53.<lb/> The CDR is part of the Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technology in Health (CADTH). This<lb/> agency, until recently known as the Canadian Coordinating Office for Health Technology Assessment<lb/> (CCOHTA), was created in 1989 to assess medical services and to inform decision-makers&apos; health<lb/> technology choices. CADTH is funded by Canadian federal, provincial and territorial governments.<lb/> 21<lb/> Québec is an exception to these two rules since hospitals there develop individual formularies based on<lb/> drugs listed on a provincial hospital drug formulary, and the Drug Insurance Act requires private insurers<lb/> to cover drugs listed on the provincial formulary.<lb/> 22<lb/> All Canadian jurisdictions (provinces and territories) participate in the CDR, with the exception of Québec.<lb/> 54.<lb/> Recommendations regarding formulary inclusion are made by the Canadian Expert Drug<lb/> Advisory Committee (CEDAC), an independent advisory body composed of individuals with expertise in<lb/> drug therapy and drug evaluation. CEDAC is appointed by and accountable to the CADTH Board of<lb/> Directors. In formulating recommendations, CEDAC considers clinical studies demonstrating safety and/or<lb/> efficacy of the drug in appropriate patient populations; therapeutic advantages and disadvantages of the<lb/> drug relative to accepted therapy, and cost-effectiveness of the drug relative to accepted therapy.<lb/> 55.<lb/> CEDAC may recommend a drug be listed, a drug be listed with criteria, a drug not be listed, or<lb/> that a recommendation be deferred pending clarification of information. To date, the Common Drug<lb/> Review is limited to new chemical entities (NCEs) and new combinations 23 . As of late August 2006, 51<lb/> drug reviews have been completed since the CDR&apos;s implementation, resulting in recommendations that the<lb/> federal government, provinces and territories not list new products in their public drug plan formularies for<lb/> half of the drugs reviewed. Some negative recommendations are based on a decision that the product is not<lb/> cost-effective at the price listed, although the actual cut-off point in terms of Quality-Adjusted Life-Years<lb/> (QALYs)/$ (or other metric) is not made explicit. Another important factor is whether surrogate outcomes<lb/> (such as reduced cholesterol level) are accepted in place of desired health outcomes, such as reductions in<lb/> morbidity or mortality.<lb/> 56.<lb/> A key objective of the CDR is to gain efficiencies in the drug review process by avoiding<lb/> multiple duplicative assessments by each publicly financed programme. During the first few years of the<lb/> CDR, some efficiencies have been achieved – for example, a manufacturer&apos;s application to CEDAC takes<lb/> the place of applications to each of the participating plans for reimbursement consideration – however,<lb/> each plan continues to supplement the review with its own follow-up. Moreover, since CDR is currently<lb/> limited to NCEs and new combinations, applications for formulary listing of line extensions of existing<lb/> drugs or for generics are directly submitted to publicly financed drug plans.<lb/> 57.<lb/> Although differences in decision-making criteria across plans make some supplementary<lb/> assessment unavoidable, some may be due to limitations of the current CDR process. For example,<lb/> findings from a recent survey of public drug plan managers conducted by the PMPRB (2005) indicated the<lb/> possible need to develop guidelines for budget impact analysis, required by most public plans for inclusion<lb/> on drug formularies.<lb/></p>

			<head>1.3.2.4. Public plan formularies<lb/></head>

			<p>58.<lb/> Processes and rules for formulary listing differ among provinces and territories, reflecting both<lb/> historical development and policy objectives. Except for Québec, all other Canadian jurisdictions now<lb/> consider CDR recommendations when making their own decisions. Decision criteria and methods vary<lb/> (see Box 3). Generally, formulary decisions are made by the respective provincial or territorial Ministry of<lb/> Health based on the recommendations of a committee.<lb/> 59.<lb/> Economic considerations are often taken into account, even if these considerations are not always<lb/> predominant in formulary decisions or explicitly outlined in decision-making criteria. What is meant by<lb/> economic considerations ranges from simple budget impact analysis to more elaborate cost-effectiveness<lb/> studies provided by the manufacturer. Pharmaco-economic assessment has been formally taken into<lb/> account in reimbursement decisions for several years in Ontario and British Columbia. However, no<lb/> explicit cost-effectiveness threshold has been defined by any jurisdiction. In cases where provinces decide<lb/> against formulary inclusion on the grounds that the drug is not cost-effective at the proposed price,<lb/> manufacturers are not constrained from presenting a new application with a lower price.<lb/></p>

			<figure>Box 3. Formulary listing processes used in selected drug coverage schemes<lb/> Ontario<lb/> 1<lb/> The Ontario Drug Benefit (ODB) covers all drugs listed in a general formulary, although coverage may be restricted to<lb/> some indications ( &quot; Limited Use &quot; ). Beyond this formulary, two specific programs exist: the Special Drug Program covers<lb/> very expensive medicines, such as treatments of HIV, cystic fibrosis, growth failure, etc., and the Section 8 Program<lb/> furnishes coverage for drugs which are approved for sale in Canada but which are not (yet) on the ODB formulary or<lb/> which are prescribed out of the &apos;Limited Use&apos; conditions required for reimbursement. This is reserved for exceptional<lb/> circumstances and needs a request by the physician. The Ontario formulary contains 3,300 products and other drugs<lb/> listed for limited use.<lb/> Formulary decisions are made by the Minister of Health, with the advice of the Drug Quality and Therapeutics<lb/> Committee (DQTC) of Ontario. DQTC members are appointed by the Government of Ontario. In 2006, there were 12<lb/> members: 9 physicians, 2 pharmacists and 1 economist. The DQTC meets once a month to examine reviews prepared<lb/> by experts. Its deliberations are confidential, as are manufacturers&apos; applications. The Ontario Ministry of Health<lb/> decided in the early 1990s that formulary decisions should be enhanced by cost-effectiveness analysis. Ontario&apos;s first<lb/> pharmaco-economic guidelines were drafted in 1993 and companies seeking reimbursement of their products have<lb/> been required to undertake cost-effectiveness studies since 1996.<lb/></figure>

			<p>A study of recommendations made by the DQTC from December 1997 to <ref type="biblio">August 1998 (PausJenssen et al, 2003</ref>)<lb/> identified factors influencing decisions of the committee. The therapeutic value of the drug was found to play a major<lb/> role in decisions, over cost considerations. For the latter, budget impact was closely considered but it never overrode<lb/> the cost-effectiveness analysis. However, less than 10% of the 134 manufacturers&apos; submissions presented<lb/> &apos;sophisticated cost-effectiveness&apos; analysis, which played a major role in only 8 decisions. Cost-containment never led<lb/> to a negative decision for a cost-effective drug. However, this study is quite old and things may have changed as<lb/> officials have since had to make decisions on an increasing number of very expensive drugs.<lb/></p>

			<p>In fiscal year 2005/2006, 98,548 patients benefited from coverage under the Individual Clinical Review (ICR/Section 8)<lb/> mechanism. The numbers of both requests and beneficiaries have been increasing very rapidly (there were only 7,429<lb/> beneficiaries in 1997/1998) and the approval rate is 68%.<lb/></p>

			<head>British Columbia<lb/></head>

			<p>In 2003, the PharmaCare formulary contained 4,900 drugs corresponding to 750 molecules. The coverage of a drug<lb/> may be limited to certain circumstances related to a patient&apos;s condition, drug intolerance, or other factors. For instance,<lb/> the drug may have to be prescribed by physicians of a defined specialty or may be covered only in second-line therapy<lb/> (after the failure of a first-line therapy). For these drugs to be covered, physicians have to ask for prior authorisation.<lb/> The British Columbia Ministry of Health makes formulary decisions on the recommendations of the BC PharmaCare<lb/> Drug Benefit Committee, whose role is to consider if a new molecule that has been the subject of a positive<lb/> recommendation from the Common Drug Review&apos;s CEDAC is both needed and affordable for British Columbia<lb/> residents. This means that negative recommendations by CEDAC are not considered further. Positive<lb/> recommendations are not always confirmed by the committee, which assesses the product against the following<lb/> criteria: safety issues, clinical effectiveness and health outcomes, value for money compared to current treatments and<lb/> budget impact of listing.<lb/></p>

			<head>Québec<lb/></head>

			<p>In Québec, the Ministère de la Santé et des Services sociaux (health ministry) establishes and updates a positive<lb/> formulary list for public and private prescription drug coverage, but private drug plans are allowed to offer extended<lb/> coverage. The formulary list includes an &apos;exception section&apos; that contains drugs reimbursed only for some indications<lb/> and for which prior authorisation is needed. Québec&apos;s formulary is acknowledged as the most inclusive formulary in<lb/> Canada. In 2005, it contained over 5,300 drugs, of which 683 are &apos;exceptional drugs&apos; whose prescription requires prior<lb/> authorisation. Québec also provides a formulary for hospital drugs.<lb/></p>

			<p>After market approval by Health Canada, a drug&apos;s manufacturer has to file an application with the Council of<lb/> Pharmaceuticals (Conseil du médicament), which considers whether to list the drug and provides recommendations to<lb/> the Ministry. The average time taken in making a recommendation ranges between 3 to 5 months but may be<lb/> accelerated under certain circumstances.<lb/> The Council is composed of medical and economic experts, as well as other experts intended to foster consideration of<lb/> ethical and societal perspectives. The 1997 Act Respecting Prescription Drug Insurance defined the following criteria<lb/> for inclusion in the positive list: (1) evidence-based therapeutic value and (2) fair pricing (considering the cost-efficiency<lb/> ratio).</p>

			<figure>Reforms introduced in 2002 (though yet to become law) added two new criteria to better take into account<lb/> societal values: (3) prospective impact on population health and on other aspects of the health care system, and (4)<lb/> appropriateness of listing in relation to the objectives of the general drug coverage scheme, which is to ensure<lb/> reasonable and equitable access to drugs. Recommendations of the Council are published when the decision of the<lb/> MSSS is announced. In 2004-2005, 100% of the recommendations issued by the Council were followed by the Québec<lb/> government. Recommendations were negative in 32% of cases in 2004-2005 and in 19% of cases in 2005-2006<lb/> (Conseil du médicament, 2005 and 2006).<lb/> The federal Non-Insured Health Benefits (NIHB) Program (First Nations and Inuit peoples)<lb/></figure>

			<p>Drugs have to be listed on the NIHB Drug Benefit List (DBL) to be funded. The NIHB makes its formulary decision by<lb/> considering CEDAC recommendations. Manufacturers filing a submission for listing in the NIHB formulary are required<lb/> to provide a letter authorizing the NIHB to access any information in the possession of Health Canada, any province or<lb/> government of Canada, the PMPRB and CADTH. Manufacturers are also required to provide information on prices and<lb/> marketing, as well as a complete budget impact assessment for the NIHB program.<lb/></p>

			<p>The review process for formulary decisions depends on the type of drug. New formulations and/or new indications for<lb/> existing drugs are reviewed internally and referred to the Federal Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committee. The<lb/> FP&amp;TC, an advisory committee composed of health professionals, is in charge of providing evidence-based<lb/> recommendations for all federal drug programs. Criteria for formulary listing are the following: evidence of therapeutic<lb/> efficacy, safety, &apos;demonstrated incremental benefit in proportion of incremental cost&apos;, and consistency with NIHB<lb/> program mandate and policy.<lb/> A drug may be listed for limited use when it has the potential for widespread use outside covered indication(s), it is<lb/> associated with predictable severe adverse effects, it is a second or third-line choice treatment in case of intolerance,<lb/> treatment failure or non-compliance with a first-line alternative, or it is very costly and there are therapeutically effective<lb/> alternatives in the DBL. Limited-use benefits may require prior approval or be subject to quantity and frequency limits.<lb/> For instance, beneficiaries are eligible for one 3-month supply of smoking cessation products per year. Products which<lb/> are not listed may be approved in special circumstances after the request of a physician or dentist.<lb/></p>

			<p>Products may be de-listed if they are discontinued from the Canadian market, if new toxicity data changes the benefit-<lb/>risk ratio to the point where listing becomes inappropriate, if new information demonstrates that the product does not<lb/> have the anticipated therapeutic benefit; when the purchase cost is disproportionate to the benefits provided; or when<lb/> a drug has a high potential for misuse or abuse.<lb/></p>

			<figure>_____________________<lb/> 1.<lb/> Current policies and practices of the Ontario Drug Benefit Program may be affected by the implementation of new drug<lb/> legislation (The Transparent Drug System for Patients Act) passed in Ontario in June 2006. Changes will be made to the<lb/> program as of October 1, 2006 and beyond.<lb/></figure>

			<p>60.<lb/> In general, drugs not listed on a formulary are not included in the scope of coverage and are<lb/> therefore not eligible for reimbursement. However, there are exceptions. Many plans allow physicians to<lb/> apply for special-use permission for drugs not listed on a formulary, which promotes accessibility of drugs<lb/> not covered or not yet covered by a patient&apos;s insurer. However, these processes are reportedly cumbersome<lb/> for the physician, acting as a disincentive to application. Efforts to address this are under way in some<lb/> provinces, such as in Ontario where special-use processes have been streamlined.<lb/> 61.<lb/> Studies have documented wide variations in formularies across Canada. <ref type="biblio">Gregoire et al. (2001)<lb/></ref> observed in 1999 the formulary status of 148 new prescription drugs approved and launched between 1991<lb/> and 1998 in all provinces and territories. Québec, British Columbia, Manitoba and Saskatchewan had listed<lb/> more than 70% of these new drugs and had the highest rates of listing without restriction. New Brunswick,<lb/> Newfoundland, Ontario and Prince Edward Island had listed less than 50% of those new products but the<lb/> listing with restriction was notably low in New Brunswick and Newfoundland. Surprisingly, the authors<lb/> found little consistency in provincial formularies, even among the provinces having the highest rates of<lb/> listing. Only 18 drugs were listed in all formularies and 10 in none. They explain these discrepancies, also<lb/> visible at the level of therapeutic classes, by differences in the population covered by provincial plans and<lb/> by the concomitance of other public programmes dedicated to specific diseases (such as cancer<lb/> programmes).<lb/> 62.<lb/> On a smaller sample 24 , Anis and colleagues (2001) found similar results. They also explored the<lb/> factors underlying decisions regarding formulary inclusion, finding that drugs were more likely to be<lb/> included where means-tested co-payments were used and when the drugs were offered at a competitive<lb/> price, compared with alternative treatments. On the other hand, the integration of public and private<lb/> insurance in a jurisdiction had a negative impact on inclusion decisions, and, counter-intuitively, the<lb/> category of disease treated by a drug was found to have no effect.<lb/> 63.<lb/> <ref type="biblio">Arthur et al (2006)</ref> show that there tends to be a common core of medications available to those<lb/> with coverage, despite the existence of more than 15,000 drug products on the market and an average of 93<lb/> new drug products added per month. However, using the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC)<lb/> classification system, the analysis also suggests that there is only 55 per cent commonality at ATC level<lb/> four when the listings of the products common amongst eight, nine or ten jurisdictions are combined.<lb/> 64.<lb/> Data from IMS allow inter-provincial comparisons of formulary listing outcomes, both in terms<lb/> of formulary &quot; generosity &quot; and in terms of &quot; time to listing &quot; (See <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>). Formulary &quot; generosity &quot; is<lb/> measured by the ratio of the</p>

			<figure>number of drugs listed to the number of listing applications by manufacturers.<lb/> Québec is more inclined to include new drugs in its formulary (48% of applications in 2003) than other<lb/> provinces, followed by Manitoba and Saskatchewan (39% and 38%). Other provinces are more stringent.<lb/> The propensity to list new drugs declined in all provinces between 2000 and 2003.<lb/> 65.<lb/> &quot; Time to listing &quot; measures the time from the date of approval for marketing to the date of<lb/> formulary listing in each province. It cannot be interpreted as an indicator of efficiency of listing<lb/> procedures since it includes delays in application submissions by manufacturers. The average time to<lb/> listing varied from less than one year in Saskatchewan, Newfoundland and Labrador to more than two<lb/> years in the Northwest Territories. The time to listing increased in many provinces between 2000 and<lb/> 2003. Since then, the Common Drug Review has been implemented and may have reduced the variation in<lb/> time to listing for new chemical entities since manufacturers file a unique application for all public plans.<lb/> 24<lb/> The authors observed the status in 10 provinces of 58 products approved for sale in Canada in 1996-1997.<lb/></figure>

			<head>Province<lb/> 66.<lb/> Provincial and territorial formularies</head>

			<p>define the public coverage of drugs dispensed in ambulatory<lb/> (outpatient) care. However, public coverage is not limited to these formularies and they should not be<lb/> considered in isolation to assess the comprehensiveness of public coverage in a province or Territory.</p>

			<figure>For<lb/> instance, intravenous cancer drugs are not reviewed by the CDR and their coverage varies across provinces<lb/> and territories. The Cancer Advocacy Coalition of Canada (2005) assessed the coverage status of 20 cancer<lb/> drugs in provinces and states that there &quot; is variable access to new drugs across the provinces, depending on<lb/> a jurisdiction&apos;s prioritisation of the treatment, timeliness of the often multi-tier vetting process, and<lb/> availability of resources to support each new treatment. This results in treatments being available in some<lb/> provinces but not others at any point in time &quot; (p. 27). 25 The report indicates that British Columbia &quot; has the<lb/> best funded and most timely access to cancer drugs, &quot; attributed to a consistent cancer programme<lb/> coordinated by a provincial cancer agency.<lb/> 67.<lb/> In 2005, McMahon et al. (2006) compared recommendations issued by the Common Drug<lb/> Review for 25 products between April 2004 and June 2005 to decisions made in 10 provinces and 3<lb/> territories in June 2005. At the time of the survey, all the drugs were still under review in Prince Edward<lb/> Island, as was the case for 16 to 19 drugs in Manitoba, New Brunswick and the Yukon territories. Other<lb/> provinces had made more decisions. British Columbia, Alberta, Nova Scotia, Saskatchewan and Ontario<lb/> showed the highest concordance between formulary decisions and CDR recommendations.<lb/></figure>

			<p>68.<lb/> Not surprisingly, formulary differences have been found to have an impact on patterns of drug<lb/> use and expenditures in Canada. Prior authorisation requirements are more effective than restricting use to<lb/> limited applications in constraining use of drugs, and formulary delisting is associated with lower<lb/> consumption (see</p>

			<table>Box 4).<lb/> 25<lb/> For instance, intravenous cancer drugs are covered through hospital global budgets in Québec, Prince<lb/> Edward Island, New Brunswick and Nova Scotia while they are covered by separate cancer agencies&apos; drug<lb/> budgets in British Columbia, Newfoundland and Saskatchewan. Provincial programs covering prescription<lb/> drugs provide different levels of coverage for new oral cancer drugs. Manitoba, Ontario, Québec and Nova<lb/> Scotia were found to cover only partially new oral drugs for ambulatory and home care, while Alberta,<lb/> Prince Edward Island and New Brunswick do not cover them at all.<lb/></table>

			<figure>Box 4. Evidence of the impact of formulary listing on consumption patterns<lb/> A few studies have examined the impact of formulary changes or of differences in provincial formularies on<lb/> consumption patterns.<lb/></figure>

			<p>One study evaluated the impact of a change in reimbursement policy for respiratory drugs in Nova Scotia in 2000<lb/> (<ref type="biblio">Kephart et al., 2005</ref>). The policy change was aimed at decreasing the use of nebulisation respiratory therapies,<lb/> considered to be no more effective than less costly therapies. Several measures were adopted: criteria were<lb/> developed to limit the reimbursement of nebulisers to certain conditions, a spacer device (a less costly alternative to<lb/> improve the delivery of inhaled drugs) was introduced in the formulary and a fixed fee was paid to the pharmacist for<lb/> patient education on the use of this device ($10 for initial education and $4 for subsequent refills and follow-up<lb/> education). The study observed the impact of the policy on cohorts of users of nebulisation therapy before the policy. A<lb/> sharp decrease in the use of nebulisation therapies was observed among former users as soon as the program was<lb/> announced, partly compensated by a large increase in the use of Aerochamber<lb/> 1 , but also by increases in other inhaled<lb/> therapies. By contrast, no increase was observed in the consumption of physicians&apos; services or in hospital admissions<lb/> among these patients, suggesting that changes in consumption did not induce adverse effects. Similar results were<lb/> observed in an assessment of the same kind of policy in British Columbia.<lb/></p>

			<p>Another study assessed the impact of the exclusion of selected topical corticosteroid products from the Nova Scotia<lb/> formulary in 2000, after an evidence-based drug review of this therapeutic class found certain topical corticosteroids<lb/> did not meet standards for inclusion (<ref type="biblio">Campbell et al., 2003</ref>). Not surprisingly, use of certain topical corticosteroid<lb/> products decreased after this change, as well as associated average costs.<lb/> <ref type="biblio">Sketris et al. (2004b)</ref> studied antibiotic consumption in Manitoba, Nova Scotia and Saskatchewan among public<lb/> programme beneficiaries between 1995 and 1998. Consumption of anti-infectives was higher in Nova Scotia (9,398<lb/> DDDs per 1,000 beneficiaries per year in 1997-98) and in Manitoba (9,950) than in Saskatchewan (8,590). Moreover,<lb/> Saskatchewan was the only province where the consumption of antibiotics decreased over the period (by 11.5%).<lb/> Saskatchewan also had a lower rate of use for broad-spectrum antibiotics, due to its more limited reimbursement<lb/> policies.<lb/> <ref type="biblio">Paterson et al. (2003)</ref> studied the impact of provincial drug policies on the use and costs to governments of Cox-2<lb/> inhibitors (a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug or NSAID) and atypical neuroleptics (antipsychotics with fewer side-<lb/>effects than older drugs used in treatment) in two provinces. Cox-2 inhibitors are subject to limited use in the Ontario<lb/> drug benefit and require prior authorisation for reimbursement in British Columbia. In Ontario, consumption of NSAID<lb/> drugs rose by 70% in the year following the introduction of Cox-2 inhibitors and costs tripled. By contrast, there was no<lb/> increase in use of NSAIDs in British Columbia. The authors found similar developments for atypical neuroleptics, which<lb/> were included in the formulary without restriction in Ontario and covered subject to prior authorisation in British<lb/> Columbia.<lb/> ____________________<lb/> 1.<lb/> An aerochamber is a device that facilitates inhalation of a puffer medication for patients with co-ordination<lb/> problems (children, older people).<lb/></p>

			<head>69.<lb/></head>

			<p>Recommendations for a common national formulary are a recurring item in Canadian public<lb/> debates; they were mentioned in both reports of the Romanow Commission (Commission on the Future of<lb/> Health Care in <ref type="biblio">Canada, 2002</ref>) and of the Standing Senate Committee on Social Affairs, Science and<lb/> <ref type="biblio">Technology (2002)</ref> – also known as the Kirby Committee. <ref type="biblio">Hollis and Law (2004)</ref> asserted that a national<lb/> drug review and formulary would avoid duplicative work of formulary management; increase negotiating<lb/> power of buyers, ensure an adequate investment in formulary management, impede strategic behaviours<lb/> from manufacturers and provinces harming other provinces, eliminate the differences in &apos;available&apos; drugs<lb/> between provinces, and reduce marketing delays by increasing collaboration between Health Canada and<lb/> the PMPRB. On the other hand, a single formulary could take into account neither differences in ability<lb/> and willingness to pay of provinces, nor differences in the health status of the populations covered.<lb/> However, Hollis and Law note that previous studies (e.g., <ref type="biblio">Grégoire et al, 2001</ref>) have found no link<lb/> between provincial income and propensity to list new drugs quickly and without restrictions.<lb/></p>

			<head>1.3.3. Reimbursement<lb/></head>

			<p>70.<lb/> In Canada, the main purchasers of prescription drugs are third-party payers, including publicly<lb/> and privately-financed drug plans, patients and hospitals<lb/> 71.<lb/> Canadian hospitals operate under fixed budgets and/or payment per case, which they use to<lb/> procure drugs provided free-of-charge to their patients. Hospitals typically use group purchasing programs<lb/> to establish group contracts for set prices. The hospital then buys directly from the manufacturer at the<lb/> contract price.<lb/> 72.<lb/> Private health insurance plans tend to act as passive payers, typically reimbursing plan members<lb/> (who normally must pay out-of-pocket first and then seek reimbursement) for the costs of prescribed<lb/> medicines used by their enrolees that are included in a given plan&apos;s formulary, less any cost-sharing<lb/> amount. The reimbursement arrangements may or may not cover the dispensing fee charged by the<lb/> pharmacist.<lb/> 73.<lb/> Provincial, territorial and federal drug plans define reimbursement prices for pharmaceutical<lb/> products covered under their formularies and, in some instances, use elaborate methodologies for<lb/> determining reimbursement amounts. The reimbursed prices may differ from manufacturer&apos;s list prices. 26<lb/> The following sections describe the various reimbursement practices and tools used by public plans in<lb/> Canada.<lb/></p>

			<head>1.3.3.1. Reimbursement formulas used by publicly financed plans<lb/></head>

			<p>74.<lb/> Public plans use different formulas to pay for prescription drug purchases and distribution<lb/> services (see <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>). When pharmacy reimbursement prices are pre-defined, this is generally the price<lb/> paid to the pharmacy by the plan; in other cases the pharmacy&apos;s actual acquisition price is paid. Wholesale<lb/> margins paid by the pharmacist are generally compensated according to a fixed or capped mark-up. Types<lb/> and amounts of dispensing fees paid are defined by each plan.<lb/> 26<lb/> Reimbursement prices are paid to retailers, whereas wholesalers or retailers purchase drugs at the price set<lb/> by the manufacturer.<lb/></p>

			<head>1.3.3.2. Reimbursement policies for price control and cost-containment<lb/></head>

			<p>75.<lb/> As the most important third-party payer in their jurisdiction, provincial plans have significant<lb/> purchasing power, enabling them to institute a range of reimbursement policies for price control and cost-<lb/>containment. Almost all publicly financed third-party payers employ some policies aimed at containing<lb/> pharmaceutical costs. Several tools are used by the plans to control reimbursement prices of drugs: direct<lb/> negotiations with manufacturers, constraints imposed on manufacturers, use of reference prices or lowest<lb/> cost alternatives, bids and across-the board freezes.<lb/> 76.<lb/> Provincial drug plans engage in very little direct negotiation with manufacturers regarding<lb/> reimbursement prices. Ontario introduced in 1998 so-called &quot; cost-sharing arrangements &quot; linking prices to<lb/> expected volumes of sales. This regulation requires written agreements between the product sponsor and<lb/> the Ministry of Health for all new brand-name drugs listed in the ODB formulary. Manufacturers have to<lb/> provide sales forecasts for the 3 years following listing and, if sales later exceed the forecasts, may be<lb/> asked to demonstrate that no inappropriate use occurred (for instance, if new uses have been approved).<lb/> An audit conducted in 2001 revealed that, in most cases, actual expenditures were at least 10% below the<lb/> forecast provided by the manufacturer. Moreover, auditors were unable to determine how forecasts had<lb/> been made since they were often significantly higher than amounts predicted on the basis of the ministry&apos;s<lb/> documentation. Finally, the auditor noted that no penalties have ever been applied in cases of unjustified<lb/> excess (Auditor General of <ref type="biblio">Ontario, 2001</ref>). Morgan, <ref type="biblio">Barer and Agnew (2003)</ref> concluded that the most<lb/> important benefit of these negotiations is to offer a better predictability to the program rather than to share<lb/> risk 28 .<lb/> 27<lb/> The price guaranteed by the manufacturer may be higher for direct sales to pharmacists than for<lb/> wholesalers, but the difference between the two prices cannot exceed 9%. If this difference is greater than<lb/> 5%, the price paid by the public plan is the price guaranteed for pharmacists and includes payment for the<lb/> wholesaler. If this difference is lower than 5%, the price paid is the price guaranteed for wholesalers + the<lb/> actual wholesale markup.<lb/> 28<lb/> However, things may change in Ontario since new drug legislation will enable the newly created office of<lb/> the Executive Officer, responsible for formulary management, to more actively negotiate formulary prices<lb/> with manufacturers as of October 1, 2006 (Legislative Assembly of <ref type="biblio">Ontario, 2006</ref>).<lb/> 77.<lb/> Some plans impose constraints that manufacturers must accept for a given drug to be listed on the<lb/> public plan formulary. For a number of years, Québec has required that manufacturers offer their drug at<lb/> the best price available in the rest of Canada. Non-compliance with this rule may lead to the delisting of all<lb/> of the manufacturer&apos;s products. For instance, Québec withdrew 37 generic drugs of the manufacturer Nu-<lb/>Pharm from its formulary when it was found to have offered a lower price in Saskatchewan (University of<lb/> <ref type="biblio">Calgary, 2004</ref>). However this de-listing was contested in court by the manufacturer, who argued that<lb/> Québec should not benefit from the lower price offered in Saskatchewan, since Québec does not offer the<lb/> 6-month period of market exclusivity provided by Saskatchewan (see below). After several judgments and<lb/> appeals, the case is now before the Supreme Court. Incidentally, Québec&apos;s listing requirements are<lb/> suspected to have created a price floor for smaller provinces. According to a report by the Federal,<lb/> <ref type="biblio">Provincial</ref> and Territorial Taskforce on Pharmaceutical Prices (published in 1999 and quoted by University<lb/> of Calgary, 2004), Saskatchewan&apos;s generic drug prices jumped by around 10% at the time of the<lb/> introduction of Québec&apos;s lowest price policy.<lb/> 78.<lb/> Since 1998, Ontario has required that the price of the first generic listed on the formulary not<lb/> exceed 70% of the brand-name product price and that prices of subsequent generic entrants not exceed<lb/> 90% of the price of the first generic product. As of October 2006, generics will have to be priced 50%<lb/> lower than the comparator product to be listed in the Ontario drug benefit formulary. Alberta also limits the<lb/> price of generic entrants to 75% of the brand-name price. As a consequence of its own regulation requiring<lb/> the &quot; best available price &quot; , Québec benefits from the regulation adopted in Ontario. In a policy paper issued<lb/> by the Québec Ministry of Health in December 2004, the government proposed to further regulate the price<lb/> of generics by limiting the price of the first entrant to 60% of the originator&apos;s brand-name price and the<lb/> price of following entrants to 54% of that price.<lb/></figure>

			<p>79.<lb/> British Columbia is the only province using so-called internal or therapeutic price referencing.<lb/> This system, established in 1995, sets reimbursement caps below the level established by PMPRB price<lb/> guidelines. The reimbursement price is defined as the price of the most cost-effective drug of the<lb/> therapeutic class. Reference prices exist for five therapeutic classes (see <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>). Similarly, in 2003,<lb/> British Columbia limited the reimbursement for proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) to the cost of the least<lb/> expensive PPI product for first-line treatment.<lb/> 80.<lb/> British Columbia&apos;s reference price system was highly contested by the pharmaceutical industry.<lb/> Its impact has been assessed by several independent researchers. They concluded that the public drug plan<lb/> realised net savings by implementing this policy, even if the reform seems to have had a one-time effect in<lb/> some drug classes with cost growth resuming at the former rate. (<ref type="biblio">Grootendorst et al., 2001; Marshall et al.,<lb/> 2002, Schneeweiss et al., 2002a; 2002b; 2003; Grootendorst et al., 2005</ref>). Conclusions on its impact on<lb/> health care utilisation and health outcomes were more nuanced. A temporary increase in physician visits<lb/> was observed among people switching to the reference drug in a class of cardiovascular drugs<lb/> (<ref type="biblio">Grootendorst et al., 2001; Schneeweiss et al., 2002a; 2002b; Schneeweiss et al., 2003</ref>), as well as higher<lb/> hospitalisation rates for some cardiovascular procedures (<ref type="biblio">Grootendorst et al., 2001</ref>). These studies also<lb/> showed increases in out-of-pocket payments for enrolees. A recent study raises questions about the<lb/> methodology used in previous studies and concludes that, in the case of anti-hypertensive drugs, actual<lb/> savings have been only about one half of the amount found previously (<ref type="biblio">Grootendorst and Stewart, 2006</ref>).<lb/> 81.<lb/> Several plans set reimbursement prices at the level of the least costly alternative in generic<lb/> groups (See <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>). Quebec adopted such a policy with a particular feature: the rule applies only 15 years<lb/> after the listing of the brand-name product in the positive list. In the interval between patent expiry and this<lb/> deadline, generics are authorised and reimbursed but originator drugs are still reimbursed at their initial<lb/> price.<lb/> 82.<lb/> Although they are based on a similar concept, lowest cost alternatives are generally better<lb/> accepted by the industry than reference prices, since they only apply to generic groups after patent expiry.<lb/> On the contrary, reference prices may apply to larger therapeutic groups – this is the case in British<lb/> Columbia – where several brand names and, possibly, generics – are placed in price competition by the<lb/> reimbursement policy. Manufacturers allege that drugs grouped in these &quot; therapeutic groups &quot; cannot be<lb/> considered as perfect substitutes and that price constraints may lead to non-optimal choices for patients.<lb/> Proponents note that it introduces price competition in markets where competition is traditionally based on<lb/> differentiation of products.<lb/> 83.<lb/> Saskatchewan employs an original system of &apos;standing offer&apos; for generics by which the<lb/> manufacturer offering the best price for a given market obtains listing exclusivity for a given period, as<lb/> well as guaranteed payment within 30 days (University of <ref type="biblio">Calgary, 2005</ref>). As seen before, this policy<lb/> created some tension with other provincial policies. In reaction, generic manufacturers have created<lb/> affiliates to serve Saskatchewan so as to avoid demands to receive the same price elsewhere. No complete<lb/> assessment of this policy was found, but the PMPRB mentions that a sharp decrease in generic prices in<lb/> 1999-2001 seems to have been compensated by exceptional growth between 2001 and 2004 (PMPRB,<lb/> 2006b, p. 30).<lb/> 84.<lb/> Reimbursement price freezes have been used in at least two provinces. Since 1994, Ontario has<lb/> frozen the retail price it will pay for drugs listed on its formulary. 29 In Québec, prices of drugs included in<lb/> the positive list are not allowed to increase, except in exceptional circumstances (such as an increase in the<lb/> cost of an input).<lb/></figure>

			<p>85.<lb/> In spite of these policies pertaining to reimbursement prices, it is fair to say that, at present,<lb/> Canadian purchasers are not very active in pursuing low prices for pharmaceuticals. With some exceptions,<lb/> Canada&apos;s publicly financed drug plans have largely refrained from applying their significant purchasing<lb/> power in price negotiations and from using their regulatory authority to obtain concessions on prices.<lb/> Indeed, the development of pricing and purchasing strategies was identified as a priority work area by the<lb/> federal/provincial/territorial National Pharmaceuticals Strategy (NPS).<lb/></p>

			<head>1.3.4. Cost-sharing arrangements<lb/></head>

			<p>86.<lb/> Both public and private plans usually require patients to contribute to the cost of medicines<lb/> through some form of cost-sharing.<lb/> 87.<lb/> Private drug plans generally impose deductibles and copayments. Employer-sponsored drug<lb/> plans have lower levels of cost sharing than do individual plans, typically setting annual deductibles at<lb/> about CAN$ 25 for individuals or CAN$ 50 per family and copayments at 20% of the cost (however,<lb/> copayments vary from 0 to 30%).</p>

			<figure>In 2000, about 29% of private plans did not require any co-payment<lb/> (Fraser/Tristat, 2002). Out-of-pocket payments are regularly capped at $2,000 per year. 30 Enrolees may<lb/> have to pay pharmacists&apos; fees.<lb/> 88.<lb/> Co-payment is the most common form of patient cost-sharing in public drug plans (see Box 5).<lb/> Total out-of-pocket spending amounts are sometimes capped. Deductibles are also frequently used.<lb/> 29<lb/> However, this policy may be affected by Ontario&apos;s new drug legislation will enable the newly created<lb/> office of the Executive Officer, responsible for formulary management, to more actively negotiate<lb/> formulary prices with manufacturers as of October 1, 2006 (Legislative Assembly of Ontario, 2006).<lb/> 30<lb/> Personal communication from CLIHA representatives.<lb/></figure>

			<p>Enrolees sometimes have to pay pharmacists&apos; fees. Cost-sharing requirements tend to be set at higher<lb/> levels, as compared to private employer-sponsored plans.<lb/></p>

			<head>Box 5. Cost-sharing arrangements in selected provincial drug plans<lb/></head>

			<p>The cost-sharing arrangements employed in the provincial drug plans of Ontario, British Columbia, and Québec<lb/> illustrate the diversity of arrangements used.<lb/> Beneficiaries of the ODB may be required to pay a part of the cost of prescription drugs. Single seniors (people aged<lb/> 65 or older) who have an annual income of $16,018 or more and seniors in couples with a combined annual income of<lb/> $24,175 or more pay a $100 deductible per senior before they are eligible for drug coverage. After these seniors pay<lb/> the deductible, they then pay up to $6.11 towards the dispensing fee each time they fill a prescription for a covered<lb/> drug product in Ontario in the benefit year (ODB website, consulted in May 2006). All other ODB eligible people,<lb/> including Trillium Drug Program (a catastrophic coverage program) recipients, may be asked to pay up to $2 each time<lb/> they fill a prescription.<lb/></p>

			<p>In the British Columbia Fair Pharmacare plan, an annual income-related deductible determines when reimbursement<lb/> will begin. Once the deductible is met, the cost of prescription drugs is covered by the plan up to 70 or 75% of cost,<lb/> and co-payments are capped by an annual maximum. Both the deductible and the maximum depend on the<lb/> beneficiary&apos;s family income. The deductible ranges from 0 to 3% of family net income while the annual maximum<lb/> ranges from 1.25 to 4% of income.<lb/> In Québec, users of the public scheme in 2006 contributed to the costs of drugs via a deductible of $145 and a co-<lb/>payment of 29% beyond this deductible. Québec residents&apos; co-payments are limited to $881 per year, in public as well<lb/> as in private insurance. The public regime requires the payment of a means-tested annual premium, ranging from $0 to<lb/> $538, above a revenue threshold.<lb/> Sources: websites of public plans and CIHI (2006).<lb/></p>

			<head>89.<lb/></head>

			<p>There is some evidence of a negative impact of cost-sharing arrangements on drug use and<lb/> adverse events in the Canadian context (see Box 6). Particularly important is evidence suggesting that use<lb/> of essential medicines has been affected, in addition to the use of medicines judged less essential.<lb/></p>

			<figure>Box 6. Canadian evidence on the impact of cost-sharing on drug use<lb/></figure>

			<p>The impact of co-payments on the use of drugs has been assessed among elderly patients using rheumatoid arthritis<lb/> drugs in British Columbia (<ref type="biblio">Anis et al., 2005</ref>). When the study was undertaken, the ingredient cost of drugs was totally<lb/> covered by BC Pharmacare for people over 65 but they had to pay pharmacist fees up to a deductible of $200. A<lb/> cohort of users of rheumatoid arthritis drugs was observed between 1997 and 2000. Patterns of health care<lb/> consumption were compared between &quot; cost-sharing periods &quot; and &quot; free periods &quot; , i.e. between years in which patients<lb/> did not reach the deductible for co-payments and periods in which they reached it. Prescriptions filled per month were<lb/> significantly higher in &quot; free &quot; periods than in cost-sharing periods. On the other hand, physician visits and hospital<lb/> admissions per month were significantly higher in the cost-sharing periods. This suggests that the existence of co-<lb/>payments on pharmaceuticals may induce substitution with other (free) medical services.<lb/> <ref type="biblio">Tamblyn et al. (2001)</ref> studied the impact of the introduction of cost-sharing among poor and elderly persons at<lb/> the time of implementation of Québec reforms. Before these reforms, beneficiaries of social assistance/welfare through<lb/> Québec&apos;s Employment Assistance Program were fully covered for drug purchases and the non-poor elderly had to pay<lb/> $2 per prescription up to an annual $100 ceiling. Commencing in August 1996, both groups had to pay coinsurance of<lb/> 25% up to an annual means-tested maximum, ranging from $200 to $750. A deductible, added to the 25% coinsurance<lb/> fee, was introduced in 1997. As a result of these policy changes, consumption of drugs judged as essential decreased<lb/> by 9% among the elderly and by 14% among welfare recipients, while the consumption of &quot; less essential drugs &quot;<lb/> decreased by 15% and 22% respectively in the two populations. Moreover, increases in cost-sharing were associated<lb/> with substantial increases in rates of adverse events (first occurrence of acute-care hospitalisation, long term care<lb/> admission or death) and in emergency department visits for those who reduced their drug utilisation.<lb/></p>

			<head>1.3.5. Adequacy of drug coverage and financial protection against drug expenditures in Canada<lb/></head>

			<p>90.<lb/> Adequacy of drug coverage can be assessed by the extent to which medicines are affordable and<lb/> otherwise accessible to Canadians. The extent and comprehensiveness of insurance coverage are key<lb/> determinants.<lb/> 91.<lb/> A report commissioned by Health Canada in 2000 provided an in-depth description of the range<lb/> and extent of drug coverage in 1998 (<ref type="biblio">Applied Management, 2002</ref>). The first conclusion was that the<lb/> comprehensiveness of drug coverage provided by both private and public plans is very different from one<lb/> province to another. Seniors receiving guaranteed income supplements and beneficiaries of social<lb/> assistance are often covered by public plans and benefit from good coverage for drugs expenditures. Full-<lb/>time employees also benefit from good coverage through private insurance. The report identified overlaps<lb/> in eligibility to federal, provincial and private drug plans, as well as gaps, notably in the case of relocation<lb/> or change of employer since many private and public drug plans impose a waiting period before enrolment<lb/> (generally 3 months). In addition, the authors reported that drug coverage was not satisfactory for low-<lb/>income families (above thresholds for social assistance) and &quot; special needs groups &quot; , i.e. young adults<lb/> suffering from certain debilitating and chronic diseases (such as multiple sclerosis and schizophrenia, see<lb/> pp. 67-68).<lb/></p>

			<figure>92.<lb/> The report also used simulations to analyse patients&apos; co-payments, according to three indicators:<lb/> the coverage for routine expenses (share of the first CAN$1,000 of annual drug expense covered by the<lb/> drug plan), the coverage for catastrophic expenses (proportion of the &quot; last CAN$1,000 &quot; covered by the<lb/> drug plan for an annual expense of CAN$50,000), and the share of family income which would be<lb/> absorbed by out-of-pocket payments of CAN$1,000. It concluded that 90% of the Canadian population has<lb/> some coverage for routine expenditures and the remainder would pay every dollar if they had to face<lb/> expenditures up to CAN$1,000. People who are uninsured against routine expenditures are most often<lb/> under 65 years and working. It also concluded that full coverage of the last CAN$1000 of catastrophic<lb/> expenditures would be provided to 93% of the Canadian population. Another 4% would be required to co-<lb/>pay 20% of these expenditures and another 3% (concentrated in the Atlantic Provinces and in Alberta)<lb/> have no coverage against such expenditures. Finally, people for whom out-of-pocket payments of<lb/> CAN$1,000 would represent more than 4.5% of family income accounted for 2% of the Canadian<lb/> population, concentrated in the same provinces and British Colombia (Applied Management, 2000).<lb/></figure>

			<p>93.<lb/> A more recent report (Fraser Group, Tristat <ref type="biblio">Resources, 2002</ref>) assessed the protection of<lb/> Canadians against &quot; severe expenditures &quot; (defined as annual expenditures for pharmaceuticals ranging from<lb/> CAN$5,000 to CAN$80,000). It concluded that &quot; 98% of the Canadian population has some form of public<lb/> or private coverage that provides a degree of protection against severe drug expenses &quot; . The report shows<lb/> also that some people would face non-negligible out-of-pocket payments in case of exposure to severe drug<lb/> expenditures (CAN$20,000, see <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>). Almost all residents of Québec, Manitoba, Ontario, British<lb/> Columbia and Saskatchewan would be protected against out-of-pocket payments exceeding CAN$2,000<lb/> per year, while only one half of residents of Alberta and the Atlantic provinces would be. Altogether, it<lb/> estimated that 89% of Canadian citizens were protected against exposure to severe drug expenses (as<lb/> defined above), 9% of Canadian citizens were only partially protected and 2% were unprotected.<lb/></p>

			<p>94.<lb/> The fact that 10% of the Canadian population has to pay every dollar for routine drug<lb/> expenditures and that 2% of the population is not even covered against severe expenditures undoubtedly<lb/> creates some financial barriers to access, particularly as those without coverage tend to be poorer.<lb/> However, such financial barriers arise in the context of a health system which otherwise offers universal<lb/> coverage of all needed medical services at no charge (zero cost-sharing) to the patient.<lb/> 95.<lb/> Somewhat surprisingly, there are few studies of the impact of lack of insurance in Canada on<lb/> prescription drug use and implications for health or other outcomes. The accessibility problems caused by<lb/> lack of drug coverage are ameliorated, in part, by the existence of catastrophic coverage programs in<lb/> several jurisdictions and the availability of publicly-financed programs covering drugs for particular<lb/> diseases and populations, including those on social assistance. Because of such programmes, many of those<lb/> with greatest need for coverage should be able to obtain it.<lb/> 96.<lb/> Underinsurance, variously defined, also leaves some Canadians at risk of reduced access to<lb/> medicines and/or spending a significant proportion of income on pharmaceuticals. Since the mid-1990s,<lb/> increased premiums, deductibles, or co-payments have greatly reduced the generosity of benefits furnished<lb/> in Canadian provincial drug plans (<ref type="biblio">Grootendorst, 2002 as cited in Morgan, Barer and Agnew, 2003</ref>).<lb/> Although some stakeholders and experts are concerned about the ramifications of underinsurance, as well<lb/> as inequities across groups in the levels of coverage, there is little information available about the impact<lb/> of underinsurance on the health or financial situation of Canadians.<lb/> 97.<lb/> There is some evidence of financial barriers to access in Canada, indicating problems with the<lb/> levels of insurance coverage. In a survey of patients conducted by the Commonwealth Fund, 20% of<lb/> Canadian sicker adults 31 did not fill a prescription because of cost in the past 2 years. This is comparable to<lb/> the percentages recorded in Australia (22%) and New Zealand (19%), and far better than that observed in<lb/> the United States, where this percentage reaches 40%. However, financial access to drugs seems to be<lb/> better in the UK (8%) and in Germany (14%) (<ref type="biblio">Schoen et al., 2005</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<head>1.3.5.1. Canadian proposals for improving drug coverage<lb/></head>

			<figure>98.<lb/> The need for catastrophic coverage was limited when most of the public drug plans were<lb/> designed, but it is more important today, given the increase in drug costs per individual. This need has been<lb/> acknowledged recently in two prominent policy reports produced by the Romanow Commission and the<lb/> Kirby Committee (Commission on the Future of Health Care in Canada, 2002; Standing Senate Committee<lb/> on Social Affairs, Science and Technology, 2002).<lb/> 99.<lb/> The Romanow report advocated the integration of prescription drugs into the insured benefits<lb/> guaranteed by the Canada Health Act. It argued for a gradual integration in order not to threaten the<lb/> sustainability of the system and recommended first the introduction of a new federal financial transfer<lb/> aimed at high-expense individuals to help provinces and territories to better cover the costs of prescription<lb/> drug plans. It defined the threshold for catastrophic expenses as being $1,500 out-of-pocket per individual,<lb/> and proposed catastrophic coverage in the form of a federal contribution of 50% of costs per individual<lb/> exceeding $1,500.<lb/></figure>

			<p>100.<lb/> The Kirby Committee report proposed to cap out-of-pocket payments (at 3% of income for<lb/> enrolees in public provincial drug plans and at $1,500 for those enrolled in private drug plans) and to<lb/> establish federal funding for 90% of any payment per patient exceeding $5,000 a year (including payment<lb/> by the plan). This solution would both protect citizens against catastrophic expenditures and limit the<lb/> financial responsibility for provincial payers and private insurers. However, national catastrophic drug<lb/> coverage has not yet been implemented.<lb/> 101.<lb/> Another approach to addressing perceived problems in the current system of coverage that has<lb/> been discussed in Canada is to create a comprehensive national system of coverage. The creation of a<lb/> federal Pharmacare program 32 , originally evoked by the National Forum on Health in 1997, was proposed<lb/> again during the meeting of</p>

			<table>Canada&apos;s Premiers and Territorial Leaders (the First Ministers from each<lb/> 31<lb/> &quot; Sicker adults &quot; are adults who rated their health as fair or poor, who had a serious illness, injury or<lb/> disability that required intensive medical care in the past two years.<lb/> 32<lb/> Québec would maintain its own program and would receive compensation comparable to the costs of the<lb/> program put in place in other provinces and territories.<lb/> province or territory) in July 2004, but was not kept on the agenda of the new National Pharmaceuticals<lb/> Strategy (NPS) defined for Canada in September 2004 (see Box 7).<lb/> Box 7. Developing a new national strategy for pharmaceuticals in Canada<lb/> In September 2004, First Ministers agreed to a National Pharmaceuticals Strategy. They agreed that no Canadian<lb/> should suffer undue financial hardship in accessing needed</table>

			<p>drug therapies, and that affordable access to drugs is<lb/> fundamental to equitable health outcomes for all Canadians. They established a Ministerial task force to develop this<lb/> strategy and charged it with the following responsibilities: develop, assess and cost options for catastrophic drug<lb/> coverage; establish a common national drug formulary for participating jurisdictions based on safety and cost-<lb/>effectiveness;accelerate access to breakthrough drugs for unmet health needs through improvements to the drug<lb/> approval process; strengthen the evaluation of &apos;real world&apos; (i.e., post-market) drug safety and effectiveness; pursue<lb/> purchasing strategies to obtain best prices for drugs and vaccines; enhance action to influence the prescribing<lb/> behaviour of health care professionals so that drugs are used only when needed and the right drug is used for the right<lb/> problem; broaden the practice of e</p>

			<table>-prescribing; accelerate access to non-patented drugs and achieve international<lb/> parity on prices of non-patented drugs; and enhance analysis of cost-drivers and cost-effectiveness, including best<lb/> practices in drug plan policies.<lb/> A public report on NPS progress was issued on September 21,2006. See http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/hcs-sss/pubs/care-<lb/>soins/2006-nps-snpp/index_e.html<lb/> 102.<lb/> In a recent paper, Marchildon (2005)</table>

			<p>advocates the creation of a &apos;Federal Pharmacare&apos;<lb/> programme in order to concentrate all relevant regulatory power and administrative, delivery and funding<lb/> functions at the federal level and thus clarify respective roles of the different levels of government and<lb/> address corresponding funding issues. According to the author, expected costs of such a program could<lb/> range from $8 billion (if the federal program just replaces existing provincial and territorial programs) to<lb/> $19 billion (if the program provides universal first-dollar coverage). Under a scenario of universal<lb/> coverage with co-payments set at the level of the most generous provincial plans, and the inclusion of<lb/> hospital drugs in the federal program (to avoid cost-shifting between out-patient and in-patient sectors), the<lb/> estimated cost is $12 billion.<lb/></p>

			<head>1.4. Policies and other initiatives intended to influence pharmaceutical consumption<lb/></head>

			<p>103.<lb/> Canada uses a range of policies to influence physicians&apos; prescribing practices, dispensing by<lb/> pharmacists, and use of medicines by patients. As is true in the United States, these policies are more<lb/> geared towards educational measures than towards binding constraints: physicians&apos; and pharmacists&apos;<lb/> professional autonomy is emphasized.<lb/></p>

			<head>1.4.1. Publicly financed assessment of health technologies and prescribing practices<lb/></head>

			<table>104.<lb/> The Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technology in Health (CADTH) 33 is responsible for<lb/> furnishing Canada&apos;s federal, provincial and territorial health care decision makers 34 (with the exception of<lb/> 33<lb/> Until April 2006, the CADTH was known as the Canadian Coordinating Office for Health Technology<lb/> Assessment (CCOHTA). The name change was intended to better reflect the organisation&apos;s mandate and<lb/> activities.<lb/> 34<lb/> Specific target audiences for the work include drug plan managers, regional health authorities, federal and<lb/> provincial government policy makers, hospital administrators and healthcare professionals.<lb/> Québec) with assessments of the evidence and advice about the effectiveness and efficiency of drugs and<lb/> other health technologies. In addition to responsibility for the Common Drug Review (discussed above),<lb/> the agency has two other main areas of work in the field of pharmaceuticals: health technology assessment<lb/> and promotion of best practices in drug prescribing and use.<lb/></table>

			<p>105.<lb/> Under CADTH&apos;s Health Technology Assessment Program, multidisciplinary teams of<lb/> researchers are convened to review and interpret evidence regarding the clinical effectiveness, cost-<lb/>effectiveness and other impacts of drugs and medical technologies for patients and health systems.<lb/> Proposals for assessment subjects are solicited from decision makers and the public at large. The<lb/> program&apos;s products include full reports, overviews and updates. It also produces reports describing issues<lb/> relating to emerging health technologies and maintains a list of emerging drugs to aid planning efforts.<lb/> 106.<lb/> The Canadian Optimal Medication Prescribing and Utilization Service (COMPUS) is a relatively<lb/> new programme administered by CADTH to identify and promote best practices in drug prescribing and<lb/> use. Priorities for work by COMPUS are identified by a committee – using criteria such as evidence of<lb/> over-or under-use, size of patient population, and ability to measure outcomes – and approved by federal,<lb/> provincial and territorial deputy ministers of health. The first three priorities were identified as proton<lb/> pump inhibitors (drugs for gastrointestinal problems), diabetes management, and anti-hypertensives. A<lb/> report on proton pump inhibitors was released in 2006. Key products of COMPUS are reports that rate the<lb/> quality of evidence supporting practice guidelines developed by others. COMPUS itself does not create<lb/> guidelines for drug prescribing and use. Future plans include tool kits to help provinces and territories<lb/> wishing to implement guidelines.<lb/> 107.<lb/> It is too early for the accumulation of adequate evidence through which to assess the influence of<lb/> COMPUS in improving drug prescribing and use. While the decision not to issue specific practice<lb/> guidelines may help avoid criticisms of government-dictated medical practice or promotion of &quot; cookbook<lb/> medicine &quot; – problems which caused a US agency with similar responsibilities to cease production of<lb/> guidelines under pressure – COMPUS&apos; findings may be more difficult to communicate clearly and,<lb/> ultimately limit the ability to influence prescribing patterns and use. On the other hand, perceived success<lb/> in accomplishing its current mission may well lead to enhanced trust and authority in future, as was<lb/> apparently the case for the evolution of health-technology assessment from reports to support for<lb/> reimbursement recommendations by CEDAC.<lb/></p>

			<head>1.4.2. Efforts by third-party payers to influence drug prescribing and dispensing behaviour<lb/></head>

			<p>108.<lb/> At present, Canada&apos;s private health insurance plans do not have many policies in place that are<lb/> intended to influence how pharmaceuticals are prescribed or dispensed. While so-called pharmaceutical<lb/> benefits management firms (PBMs) are employed by some insurers, their actions at present are restricted to<lb/> prescription claims and data management. In the United States, by contrast, PBMs take a more active role<lb/> in managing drug dispensing.<lb/> 109.<lb/> Canada&apos;s public plans provide efforts to encourage appropriate prescribing behaviours. For the<lb/> most part, these efforts concentrate on formulary management (prior authorisation, restricted listing).<lb/> However, public drug plans increasingly produce prescription guidelines 35 and some of them provide<lb/> feedback to doctors on their prescribing patterns 36 . By contrast with third-party payers in some OECD<lb/> 35<lb/> For example, the Ontario government has, in the past, subsidized the production of a series of guidelines<lb/> covering different systems (e.g., gastrointestinal), and it continues to produce guidelines for antibiotics.<lb/> 36<lb/> e.g., In Nova Scotia physicians have been providing feedback on their prescribing patterns (<ref type="biblio">Sketris et al.<lb/> 2004c; Sketris et al., 2005</ref>).<lb/> countries 37 , public plans do not set prescription spending targets or budgets for physicians and do not use<lb/> any kind of financial incentives to influence doctors&apos; prescribing.<lb/></p>

			<p>110.<lb/> Public drug plans are more active in promoting and ensuring appropriate dispensing. A first set of<lb/> rules pertain to maximum &quot; supply per prescription &quot; policies. Most drug plans limit drug supply per<lb/> prescription to a given period. For instance, British Columbia Pharmacare is limited to a 30-day supply for<lb/> the first prescription fill of a given drug and to 100-day supply for subsequent refills (<ref type="biblio">Anis et al., 2005</ref>).<lb/> 111.<lb/> Some drug plans introduced incentive fees for pharmacists. For instance, both Québec and British<lb/> Columbia compensate the pharmacist fee when the pharmacist refuses to deliver a drug because of<lb/> potential interactions with other treatments. Nova Scotia introduced a special fee for educating patients in<lb/> the use of metered dose inhalers for respiratory drugs when it decided to restrict the prescription of<lb/> respiratory nebulisers to some categories of patients (<ref type="biblio">Murphy et al., 2005</ref>).<lb/> 112.<lb/> More recently, several public drug plans implemented drug utilisation reviews (DURs). For<lb/> instance, the NIHB implemented a DUR at the point of service in order to monitor potential drug<lb/> interactions and avoid duplicate therapies (NIHB Drug benefit list, April 2006). Drug utilisation reviews<lb/> also allow retrospective analysis of the frequency of potential dangerous interactions. However, in 2004,<lb/> the Auditor General of Canada wrote that these utilisation reviews were under-used by public drug plans.<lb/></p>

			<head>1.4.2.1. Policies relating to prescribing and dispensing of generic products<lb/></head>

			<p>113.<lb/> In addition to patent policy and policies pertaining to the approval process, a number of other<lb/> policies affect the prescribing and dispensing decisions that determine the share of prescriptions that are<lb/> filled with generic formulations of pharmaceutical products.<lb/> 114.<lb/> Provinces usually establish lists of interchangeable products after generic market approval by<lb/> Health Canada. These lists generally apply only to public drug plans but some provinces (British<lb/> Columbia, Manitoba, New Brunswick and Nova Scotia) extended inter-changeability rules to the whole<lb/> market (see <ref type="biblio">Skinner, 2004</ref>). This means that provincial scientific committees re-assess the equivalence of<lb/> generic drugs imposing further delays for substitution and introducing discrepancies in substitution<lb/> possibilities across provinces (<ref type="biblio">Public Policy Forum, 2006</ref>). Generic manufacturers claim for immediate<lb/> inter-changeability after Health Canada approval. This rule already applies in British Columbia where,<lb/> since mid-2003, pharmacists have been allowed to rely on data published by Health Canada or on<lb/> information from their professional association to make judgements on drug interchangeability (BC<lb/> College of <ref type="biblio">Pharmacists, 2004</ref>).<lb/> 115.<lb/> Financial incentives for generic utilisation differ from one province to another but are generally<lb/> directed to patients rather than to pharmacists. They consist of reimbursement policies that require patients<lb/> to pay out-of-pocket the difference between the retail price and the reimbursement level for a drug<lb/> included in a reference group of interchangeable drugs.<lb/> 116.<lb/> As a result of discrepancies among provincial policies, there is significant variation across<lb/> Canada in the extent to which generic alternatives are dispensed in place of brand-name products,<lb/> providing an indication of the impact of policies relating to prescribing and dispensing of generics. For<lb/> instance, generic products were dispensed for only 38% of prescriptions filled in Québec during 2005,<lb/> compared with 49% in British Columbia (IMS <ref type="biblio">Health, 2006</ref>).<lb/> 117.<lb/> In hospitals, payment schemes provide strong incentives for cost-containment. Once a generic<lb/> version of a medicine is approved by Health Canada, hospital purchases concentrate on the generics and<lb/> avoid using the original brand-name product.<lb/></p>

			<head>1.5. Innovation policies<lb/></head>

			<p>118.<lb/> Policies providing incentives to innovate are important in shaping pharmaceutical markets. Such<lb/> policies include direct or indirect subsidies for R&amp;D investments, and protection of intellectual property<lb/> rights allowing manufacturers to recoup R&amp;D expenditures through pricing based on market exclusivity.<lb/> This section provides a brief overview of innovation policies in the Canadian context.<lb/></p>

			<head>1.5.1. Intellectual property rights<lb/></head>

			<p>119.<lb/> Overall, Canada&apos;s drug patent policy aims to achieve a balance between adequate patent<lb/> protection and timely introduction of generic drugs. Adequate patent protection is needed to encourage the<lb/> development of better drug therapies, while timely introduction of generic drugs, coupled with patented<lb/> medicine price regulation, helps to contain drug costs.<lb/> 120.<lb/> The Patent Act of 1923 and its subsequent amendments define patent rights in Canada. Before<lb/> 1987, intellectual property rights protection for patented drugs was not among the highest: patents<lb/> pertaining to drug and food were for shorter terms than in some other developed countries, and were<lb/> subject to compulsory license 38 to manufacture (since 1923) and to import (since 1969).<lb/></p>

			<figure>121.<lb/> In 1987, amendments to the Patent Act were introduced (Bill C-22) to enhance patent protection<lb/> of pharmaceuticals 39 . These amendments guaranteed an increase in protection against compulsory licensing<lb/> after market approval: 10 years against compulsory licensing to import and 7 years against compulsory<lb/> licensing to manufacture. They also introduced the ability to issue product patents to complete the<lb/> protection offered by process patents. As well, the patent protection period was extended to 20 years from<lb/> date of filing instead of the previous system granting 17 years from date of patent&apos;s issue.<lb/> 122.<lb/> In 1993, following negotiations related to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT)<lb/></figure>

			<p>and the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), the government passed Bill C-91, which<lb/> substantially amended Canada&apos;s drug patent policy. Most notably, C-91 repealed Canada&apos;s longstanding<lb/> compulsory licensing regime for patented drugs 40 and introduced in its stead what is commonly called the<lb/> &quot; early-working &quot; exception, as well as a provision to ensure that generic drugs will not be marketed before<lb/> patent expiry.<lb/> 123.<lb/> The &quot; early-working exception &quot; allows generic manufacturers to use the patented invention<lb/> without the patentee&apos;s authorisation for the purpose of obtaining approval of a generic product before the<lb/> patent expiration date. Originally, Bill C-91 authorised generic manufacturers to create stocks of their<lb/></p>

[See<lb/> http://www.ictsd.org/weekly/03-10-15/story5.htm].<lb/> products up to six months before patent expiry, but Canada repealed this provision to comply with a World<lb/> Trade Organisation ruling against it.<lb/> 124.<lb/> However, to prevent generic manufacturers from selling their approved drugs before patent<lb/> expiry, Bill C-91 introduced the Patented Medicines (Notice of compliance) Regulations. This provision<lb/> requires patentees to provide Health Canada with</table>

			<p>the list of valid patents linked to any product when<lb/> seeking approval. Generic manufacturers have to check dates of patent expiry of listed patents before<lb/> marketing their drugs or to make an attestation explaining why their product is not infringing on current<lb/> patents. If the patentee disagrees, litigation ensues and an automatic stay is triggered that bars Health<lb/> Canada from issuing the generic product a marketing authorisation for 24 months, until the litigation is<lb/> resolved or the patent expires, whichever comes first.<lb/> 125.<lb/> In recent years, provisions aiming at protecting patent rights have been used by manufacturers of<lb/> some top-selling patented drugs to delay generic entry through what is commonly called &quot; ever-greening &quot;<lb/> strategies. In particular, brand-name companies were suspected of routinely protecting old products by new<lb/> patents in order to trigger multiple 24-month stay periods against generic market entry (<ref type="biblio">Government</ref> of<lb/> Canada, 2004a and 2004b).<lb/> 126.<lb/> In light of the above, the Departments of Industry and Health developed a joint package of<lb/> regulatory amendments designed to bring a greater degree of stability and predictability to the<lb/> pharmaceutical marketplace by establishing a firmer upper and lower boundary to the period during which<lb/> brand-name drugs enjoy market exclusivity. These amendments were conceived in response to specific<lb/> concerns expressed by stakeholders following pre-publication of the proposed amendments in Part I of the<lb/> Canada Gazette on December 11, 2004. Following extensive consultations with industry stakeholders, a<lb/> revised set of amendments came into force on October 5, 2006 and was published on October 18, 2006 in<lb/> the Canada Gazette, Part II 41 .<lb/></figure>

			<p>127.<lb/> Amendments to the PM(NOC) Regulations will facilitate the market entry of a generic version of<lb/> the original form of a brand-name drug immediately following expiry of the relevant patents, as was<lb/> originally intended, while at the same time allowing brand-name companies to duly protect improvements<lb/> to the original form of the drug that are innovative and therapeutic (so-called &quot; incremental innovation &quot; ).<lb/> There are two primary means by which the market entry of generic drugs would be facilitated: (1) through<lb/> the so-called &quot; freezing &quot; of Health Canada&apos;s patent register; and, (2) by reaffirming the rules for listing<lb/> patents on the register. The freezing of the register would prevent any patent arising after the date the<lb/> generic files its regulatory submission with Health Canada from triggering additional 24-month stays<lb/> against that company. 42 In terms of reaffirming the rules for listing patents on the register, the proposed<lb/> amendments entrench the concept of product specificity as the key consideration required of the Minister<lb/> of Health in applying the listing requirements under section 4 of the PM(NOC) Regulations. They do so<lb/> through more precise language respecting the intended link between the subject matter of a patent on a<lb/> patent list and the content of the underlying submission for a marketing authorisation in relation to which it<lb/> is submitted. In addition, under the amendments, only certain clearly defined submission types would<lb/> provide an opportunity to submit a new patent</p>

			<table>list.<lb/> 128.<lb/> Health Canada&apos;s amendments to the Food and Drug Regulations address the issue of data<lb/> protection for pharmaceuticals and bio-pharmaceuticals. Both the World Trade Organization (WTO)<lb/> Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS), and the North American<lb/> 41<lb/> See http://canadagazette.gc.ca/partII/2006/20061018/html/sor241-e.html.<lb/> 42<lb/> This approach is inspired by recent amendments in the United States in response to similar strategic<lb/> behaviour on the part of brand-name companies there.<lb/> Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) require that test data be protected from unfair commercial use. NAFTA<lb/> defines a minimum period of time for the protection as &quot; not less than five years &quot; . The amended regulations<lb/> provide 8 years of data protection for new and innovative drugs from</table>

			<p>the date on which marketing<lb/> authority is granted. A subsequent manufacturer is prohibited from filing its submission for the first six<lb/> years of this period. A further 6 months of protection is provided for drugs that have been subject to<lb/> paediatric clinical trials. This is longer than in the United States, which provides 5 years during which a<lb/> generic submission cannot be filed, and an additional three-year period for improvements to the drugs as<lb/> well as an additional 6 months for drugs that have been tested in paediatric populations. Recently passed<lb/> EU legislation grants 8 years of data exclusivity and an overall 10-year period of market exclusivity, which<lb/> can be extended by one year in case of the approval of a new indication with significant therapeutic value<lb/> in the first 8 years of marketing, and by one year for OTC switch (in addition to the 6 months granted for<lb/> paediatric products). According to officials, under the former Canadian regulations, data exclusivity was<lb/> less than 8 years only in 22% of cases, which means that the new regulation would affect only a part of the<lb/> market.<lb/> 129.<lb/> Unlike in the US and in Europe, there is no &apos;complementary protection&apos; after patent expiry<lb/> (commonly called &quot; patent-term restoration &quot; ) to compensate for long regulatory delays of patented<lb/> products. The effective length of market exclusivity in Canada is not easy to assess since two regimes are<lb/> still in force for marketed drugs (drugs patented before 1989 were granted shorter patent protection). The<lb/> actual market exclusivity (the time between launch and first generic entry) was estimated for a sample of<lb/> 73 molecules by <ref type="biblio">Health</ref> Canada (document provided by I respectively ndustry Canada for 2003): average<lb/> and median market exclusivity were 12.9 and 11.4 years, respectively. However, a few products<lb/> experienced much shorter periods of market exclusivity (3 to 5 years) 43 .<lb/> 130.<lb/> Unlike a number of other OECD countries, Canada does not have any specific IPR policy aimed<lb/> at encouraging R&amp;D for orphan drugs, such as extended patent protection. In a policy paper issued in the<lb/> 1990s, Canadian authorities concluded that Canadian patients were able to benefit from new drugs<lb/> discovered in foreign countries and that there was no need to foster national innovation in this sector<lb/> (Health Canada report of 1997 quoted by the Canadian coalition for rare disorders, 2005). However,<lb/> BioteCanada (2004) 44 calls for the implementation of such a policy in order to take advantage of the good<lb/> development of the biotech industry in Canada to develop biotech orphan drugs.<lb/></figure>

			<head>1.5.2. Other policies intended to promote innovation<lb/></head>

			<p>131.<lb/> In 2002, Canada launched an innovation strategy, 45 aimed at improving public and private<lb/> investments in R&amp;D, further developing labour force skills, improving the business environment and<lb/> fostering community-based innovation. Each strategic goal was assigned more specific targets, such as<lb/> &quot; rank in 2010 among the Top 5 countries in terms of R&amp;D performance &quot; or &quot; develop at least 10<lb/> internationally recognized technology clusters &quot; . According to an assessment produced by the Conference<lb/> Board of Canada, results of this policy are mixed in the sense that very ambitious targets have not always<lb/> been met (<ref type="biblio">OECD, 2006</ref>). However, some measures are likely to be beneficial to the pharmaceutical sector</p>

			<table>.<lb/> 43<lb/> Other products experienced very long periods of market exclusivity (24 to 36 years), but in these cases, the<lb/> relative roles of regulation and attractiveness of the market for generics cannot be easily distinguished.<lb/> 44<lb/> BioteCanada is a not-for-profit association representing the interests of biotech companies. However,<lb/> BioteCanada (2004)44 calls for the implementation of such a policy in order to take advantage of the good<lb/> development of the biotech industry in Canada to develop biotech orphan drugs.<lb/> 45<lb/> This overview relies on a summary presented in the forthcoming OECD Economic Survey of Canada 2006.<lb/> 132.<lb/> One of the first goals of this policy was to increase public and private expenditures on R&amp;D with<lb/> the target of ranking among the top five countries in the world in terms of R&amp;D performance by 2010. In<lb/> the health field, R&amp;D expenditures have increased faster than in other sectors since the 1990s and now<lb/> represent a larger share of total gross domestic expenditures on R&amp;D (23% in 2005 versus 15% in 1990).<lb/> In 2005, gross domestic expenditures on R&amp;D</table>

			<p>in the health field were estimated at almost $6 billion, of<lb/> which 33% was funded by business enterprises and 52% by the public sector (federal, provincial and<lb/> higher education). The higher education sector – including teaching hospitals – plays a major role in<lb/> conducting health-related R&amp;D (62%) while business enterprises conduct about 27% of it (<ref type="biblio">Statistics<lb/> Canada, 2006</ref>). However, these figures relate to total health-related R&amp;D and the share of business funding<lb/> is higher when the pharmaceutical sector is considered alone.<lb/> 133.<lb/> Tax credits for R&amp;D expenditures constitute another form of incentive. The Canadian Scientific<lb/> Research and Development (SR&amp;D) tax credit applies to current and capital expenditures on eligible R&amp;D<lb/> activities and is designed to favour small companies. The tax credit amounts to 35% of refundable<lb/> expenditures under a threshold, defined at different levels according to the size of the company. (100% of<lb/> current expenditures and 40% of capital expenditures under this threshold are refundable). Small<lb/> companies benefit from an additional 20% tax credit for 40% of total expenditures (current and capital)<lb/> beyond a defined threshold (generally $2 million). Provinces provide additional tax subsidies for R&amp;D,<lb/> with wide variations, Québec being the most generous (<ref type="biblio">McKenzie and Kenneth, 2005</ref>).<lb/> 134.<lb/> The regulation of patented medicine prices by the PMPRB may also, to some extent, be<lb/> considered as an innovation-related policy geared towards the pharmaceutical sector. The seven<lb/> comparator countries used for the assessment of the median international price were chosen among the<lb/> greatest investors in pharmaceutical innovation. Moreover, price regulation was accepted by the patented<lb/> medicines industry as part of an arrangement in which the industry committed to increasing R&amp;D<lb/> investment in Canada in exchange for extended patent protection.<lb/></p>

In 1985, they were responsible for only 67.5% of total drug expenditures (CIHI,<lb/> 2006). Expenditures for non-prescribed drugs include both over-the-counter drugs (CAN$ 2.23 billion or<lb/> 9.0% of total drug expenditures in 2005) and personal health supplies such as dental floss and disposable<lb/> diabetic syringes (CAN$ 1.93 billion, 7.8% of drug expenditures). Compared with other OECD countries<lb/> for which data are available, Canada&apos;s level of OTC consumption seems rather low 50 .<lb/></figure>

			<table>143.<lb/> Expenditures for hospital drugs accounted for CAN$ 1.5 billion in 2003, representing 7% of<lb/> prescription drug expenditures in Canada. Again, there are wide variations across provinces, with<lb/> 50<lb/> Data are available only for Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Japan, Korea, Slovak Republic,<lb/> Spain, and Switzerland in 2003. For these countries, the average per capita expenditures for OTC drugs is<lb/> 62 US(PPP)$ -versus 49 in Canada and the average share in total expenditures for drugs is 16% -versus<lb/> 9.6% in Canada.<lb/> expenditures for hospital drugs ranging from CAN$ 37 per capita in Prince Edward Island to CAN$ 58 in<lb/> New Brunswick. Hospital drug expenditures range from an average of CAN$ 44.8 per inpatient day in<lb/> Nova Scotia to $76 in British Columbia 51 . According to IMS data on manufacturers&apos; sales in Canada 52 ,<lb/> hospital drugs accounted for 11.6% of total prescription drug sales in Canada in 2005 and the market is<lb/> growing at twice the rate of the ambulatory market (IMS Health, 2006).<lb/></table>

			<p>144.<lb/> Canada is one of relatively few OECD countries – along with the United States, Germany, and<lb/> the United Kingdom – in which generic products account for a relatively large share of drug consumption<lb/> (<ref type="biblio">Danzon and Furukawa, 2003</ref>)</p>

			<figure>. Generic drugs represent 16.8% of Canadian pharmaceutical sales and<lb/> 42.7% of prescriptions in the 12 months ending June 2005, with significant variations across provinces,<lb/> ranging from 37.5% in Québec to 49.5% in British Columbia (Canadian Generic Pharmaceutical<lb/> Association (CGPA) website consulted on March 21st, 2006). In addition, generic prescription is<lb/> increasing faster than prescription of brand-name medicines. According to IMS Health, generic drugs<lb/> accounted for 50% of the growth in the number of prescriptions in 2003. Generics represented the majority<lb/> of prescriptions for antibiotics and analgesics, and about 90% of diuretics in 2003.<lb/></figure>

			<head>2.1.3. Volume of pharmaceutical consumption<lb/></head>

			<figure>145.<lb/> The number of prescriptions filled in Canadian retail pharmacies has increased significantly over<lb/> the past 10 years, from 228.2 million in 1995 to 395.8 million in 2005, according to IMS Health<lb/> calculations, an increase of 73%. Considered in per capita terms, this equates to an increase in the number<lb/> of prescriptions filled from an average of 7.8 to approximately 12 per year.<lb/> 146.<lb/> The number of annual prescriptions per person also varies widely across Canadian provinces,<lb/> from a low of 9 in British Columbia to a high of 20 in Québec in 2005 (IMS Health, 2006). Among the<lb/> factors explaining this variation are differences in the period of time for which a drug is normally<lb/> prescribed. Prescriptions in Québec are normally smaller in terms of the quantity of dosages than are those<lb/> of other provinces; therefore, a greater number of prescriptions are issued for the treatment of chronic<lb/> conditions or extended spells of illness. Differences in the age composition of the population, 53 as well as<lb/> differences in policies or practices that influence prescribing behaviour, may also explain some of the<lb/> variation.<lb/> 147.<lb/> Both in terms of the average number of prescriptions filled and the range of variation across<lb/> jurisdictions, Canada appears roughly similar to the United States, where the average number of<lb/> prescriptions per capita in 2004 was 10.6, with variation across states ranging from 6.5 (in Alaska) to 15.4<lb/> (in Kentucky) (Kaiser Family Foundation, 2006).<lb/></figure>

			<p>148.<lb/> Although prescription data are interesting, they provide a less-than-ideal measure of the change<lb/> in the volume of drug consumption over time. No information is publicly available by which to assess the<lb/> volume of pharmaceuticals consumed in Canada in terms of the so-called &quot; defined daily dose (DDD) &quot;<lb/> standard or other comparable metric (<ref type="biblio">Sketris et al., 2004a</ref>). This makes it difficult to assess how the<lb/> 51<lb/> These figures need to be interpreted cautiously since categories of drugs dispensed in hospitals and covered<lb/> in ambulatory care may vary from one province to another. For instance, cancer or HIV drugs are<lb/> dispensed in ambulatory care in some provinces but only by hospitals in some provinces.<lb/></p>

			<figure>52<lb/> Market shares are measured at ex-factory prices whereas expenditures are measured at public prices.<lb/> Differences in distribution costs in ambulatory and hospital care explain differences in the share of<lb/> hospitals in market sales and in pharmaceutical expenditures.<lb/> 53<lb/> Canadians aged 80 and over fill an average of 73 prescriptions per person in retail pharmacies, compared<lb/> with less than 6 per person for those under age 39 (IMS, 2006).<lb/> increase in consumption of prescription medicines over time compares with trends outside Canada,<lb/> although significant consumption growth in several important therapeutic classes of medicines tracked<lb/> across OECD countries is evident among those countries reporting such data (OECD Health Data, 2005).<lb/> 149.<lb/> Cooke et al. (2005) compared the consumption of statins among elderly patients covered by<lb/> public drug plans in Nova Scotia and in Queensland, Australia between 1997 and 2001. Patterns of<lb/> consumption were found to be very similar. The use of statins increased sharply over the period in both<lb/> jurisdictions, from 50 DDDs/1,000 beneficiaries per day in 1997 to 205 in 2001, reflecting worldwide<lb/> evolutions in recommendations for the use of cholesterol-lowering drugs and in statins use. Prescription<lb/> costs per 1,000 beneficiaries increased during the period although average unit costs per DDD actually<lb/> decreased in both countries (Prices in Nova Scotia have historically been higher than in Queensland<lb/> (CAN$ 1.14 per DDD versus CAN$ 0.88)).<lb/></figure>

			<p>150.<lb/> A recent survey, conducted by the Commonwealth Fund, of patients in several OECD countries<lb/> sheds light on some differences in drug use. Among &apos;sicker&apos; adults with at least one chronic condition,<lb/> 84% of Canadians take prescription medications regularly, which is higher than in Australia (79%) and in<lb/> Germany (81%), but lower than in the United Kingdom (88%) or in the United States (88%). The<lb/> proportion of Canadian interview subjects taking &quot; 4 or more medications &quot; regularly was 41%, which is<lb/> higher than in Australia (34%) and Germany (40%) but lower than in the United States (53%) (<ref type="biblio">Schoen et<lb/> al., 2005</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<head>2.1.4. Pharmaceutical prices<lb/></head>

			<p>151.<lb/> Variation in pharmaceutical prices across Canada is minimal, with price differentials across<lb/> jurisdictions estimated to be no more than 10%. Price growth of existing products is rather weak and<lb/> Canadian patented drug prices are comparable to the medicine prices in the seven comparator countries<lb/> used by the PMPRB in conducting price reviews. However, generic drug prices in Canada are higher than<lb/> in other countries.<lb/></p>

			<head>2.1.4.1. Variation in prices sub-nationally<lb/></head>

			<p>152.<lb/> There is some variation in manufacturers&apos; list prices in different geographic regions of the county<lb/> and actual prices paid by purchasers (hospital, retailer, wholesaler, public plans) can differ according to the<lb/> purchaser as well. We did not find any recent public information on the difference in prices paid by<lb/> hospitals and by other purchasers. Reliable price comparisons between provinces were available only for<lb/> 1999/2000.<lb/> 153.<lb/> A report by PMPRB (2001) compares the price of an average Canadian basket of drugs<lb/> (composed of products available in all jurisdictions, weighted to reflect utilisation in all jurisdictions) in six<lb/> provinces (British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Ontario, Nova Scotia) for the 1999-2000<lb/> fiscal year. Ex-manufacturer prices were found to be more or less equivalent in the six provinces (± 1%),<lb/> although discrepancies were higher for the reimbursement prices paid by drug plans, which include<lb/> wholesale and pharmacist mark-ups. Deviations from the average price range from -1.9% in Ontario to<lb/> +5% in British Columbia. In a more recent work, prices of 101 top-selling drugs were found to vary<lb/> between -3% to +9% from the national average (Morgan, <ref type="biblio">Barer and Agnew, 2003</ref>). When the market is<lb/> segmented according to drug status related to patent, it appears that price differentials are higher for<lb/> generic drugs than for patented drugs: for generics, Saskatchewan pays 7.3% less than the average while<lb/> British Columbia pays 4.7% more.<lb/> 154.<lb/> Differences in prices paid by private and public insurers have also been computed for the 101 top<lb/> selling drugs. Public drug plans paid lower prices than private ones in most provinces: sometimes 10% less<lb/> (Québec, Nova Scotia) and sometimes only 1% less (Alberta and Manitoba). In two provinces, public plans<lb/> paid higher prices than private plans (+7% in Ontario and +9% in Newfoundland) (<ref type="biblio">Morgan, Barer and<lb/> Agnew, 2003</ref>).<lb/> 155.<lb/> Prices of generics were found to be on average 39.2% cheaper than brand-name drugs in the<lb/> Ontario drug formulary in 2005, with some generics being 63% cheaper than their branded counterparts<lb/> (CGPA data). Closely similar results were observed for Québec&apos;s drug formulary, with generics being on<lb/> average 37.3% cheaper than brand-name drugs. However, prices of generics have been found to be not<lb/> significantly lower than the price of the original drug, in some cases. For instance, in 2003, prices of<lb/> generics of some hypertensive molecules were almost identical to prices of originators in all provinces<lb/> (<ref type="biblio">Morgan et al., 2003</ref>).<lb/> 156.<lb/> Relatively high prices of generics are explained by a lack of competition in the Canadian market,<lb/> due to a high concentration of the market. Using results derived by PMPRB from<lb/> federal/provincial/territorial drug plan data, Skinner (2004) observes that one company accounted for 50%<lb/> of all public spending in generic drugs in 6 provinces in 1999/2000, while the three largest competitors<lb/> accounted for 82% of these spending. According to more recent data, this concentration has been slightly<lb/> decreasing (PMPRB, 2006c, p. 4).<lb/></p>

			<head>2.1.4.2. Price trends<lb/></head>

			<figure>157.<lb/> In line with the price regulation scheme, price increases of patented drugs 54 were parallel to those<lb/> of the general CPI, however with lower annual growth rates (PMPRB, 2006a, page 24). Growth rates were<lb/> even negative from 1993 to 1997 and between 2002 and 2003.<lb/> 158.<lb/> Even if patented drugs represent a growing fraction of pharmaceuticals sales, from 43.2% in 1990<lb/> to 71.4% in 2005 (PMPRB<ref type="biblio">, 2006</ref>), one might assume that the Patented Medicines Price Index is not<lb/> necessarily representative of price increases in the whole market. However, recent analysis by the PMPRB<lb/> on price trends in seven public drug plans shows that price trends in the last four years were very similar<lb/> for patented and non-patented-drugs 55 .<lb/></p>

			<head>2.1.4.3. Prices in international comparisons<lb/></head>

			<p>159.<lb/> To assess the international position of Canadian prices, the OECD used several studies chosen<lb/> according to the following criteria: they are quite recent (1999 and after), of high quality and as<lb/> 54<lb/> The best available index to assess pharmaceutical price changes is the one computed by the PMPRB for<lb/> patented drugs. Actually, several indexes exist to measure price changes in the pharmaceutical sector in<lb/> Canada. Statistics Canada provides two types of indexes for pharmaceuticals: the industrial product price<lb/> index (IPPI, for manufacturer prices) and two separate consumer price indexes for prescribed drugs and for<lb/> non-prescribed drugs (consumer prices, including distributors&apos; mark-ups and taxes). The latter serve as a<lb/> basis for the composite index for pharmaceuticals and other non-durable goods published in OECD Health<lb/> Data. All these indexes show higher price increases than the PMPRB index for the 1987-</p>

			<table>2005 period (see<lb/> CIHI, 2006, page 47 for instance). These indexes, computed with a small number of pharmaceutical<lb/> products (from 8 to 30 according to Statistics Canada&apos;s methodology), may not be representative of the<lb/> pharmaceutical market. Moreover, the more rapid increase in consumer prices reported in the non-PMPRB<lb/> indexes may be in part due to increases in distributors&apos; margins. The PMPRB&apos;s PMPI (Patented Medicines<lb/> Price Index) is a Laspeyres index, computed as a weighted-by-sales average of year-over-year changes in<lb/> ex-manufacturers&apos; prices. It is based on all patented drugs and not only on a sample.<lb/> 55<lb/> With the notable exception of Saskatchewan, which experienced high growth in generic prices in the 2001<lb/> to 2004 period, after a sharp decline between 1999 and 2001.<lb/></table>

			<p>representative as possible of the Canadian market. Some studies deal with the whole market, while others<lb/> focus on one segment (e.g., patented drugs/generics). A review of the studies is presented in an Annex.<lb/> 160.<lb/> Although reconciliation of the results of these studies is challenging given the sensitivity of<lb/> results to variations in methodology, it is possible to draw some conclusions about relative price levels in<lb/> Canada. Prices of patented drugs seem to be close to average European price levels, lower than in the more<lb/> expensive European countries (the United Kingdom, Switzerland) and higher than in the European<lb/> countries with the lowest price levels (France, Italy). On average, patented drug prices are between 35%<lb/> and 45% lower in Canada than in the United States, the country with the highest prices for patented<lb/> medicines. By contrast, such differentials with US prices are not observed for generic products. In fact,<lb/> Canada&apos;s generics appear to be priced higher than they are in other countries (including the US).<lb/> 161.<lb/> According to PMPRB calculations, Canadian prices of patented drugs tend now to be more in<lb/> line with prices in the seven countries chosen as comparators than before the enforcement of the excessive<lb/> price regulation in the late 1980s. The achievement of such parity for non-patented drug prices is regarded<lb/> as one of the objectives of the National Pharmaceuticals Strategy (PMPRB, 2006c).<lb/></p>

			<head>2.2. Financing<lb/></head>

			<p>162.<lb/> Considering total expenditures devoted to pharmaceuticals, including both prescription and over-<lb/>the-counter medicines, public funding in Canada is relatively low compared to most other OECD<lb/> countries. In 2003, it reached 38% of total drug expenditures, while the OECD average was about 60%<lb/> (see <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>). Only Mexico (11%) and the United States (21%) had lower shares for public funding of<lb/> drugs. This low share of public funding results from the prevalence of private coverage of prescription<lb/> drugs for a large part of the population. This situation further reflects policy choices implicit in Canada&apos;s<lb/> health system, in which medical and hospital services are publicly and 100% covered, as well as drugs<lb/> used in inpatient care.<lb/> 163.<lb/> In spite of increasing public funding of prescription drugs, from 43.4% in 1985 to 46% in 2005,<lb/> private expenditure (through private insurance and households&apos; expenditures) continues to be an important<lb/> means of financing in Canada. Provincial and territorial governments are the largest payers for prescription<lb/> drugs: they finance 39% of total prescription drug expenditures. Federal direct contributions and social<lb/> security funds (including the Québec drug insurance fund) add to public funding with respectively 3% and<lb/> 4% of total prescription drug expenditures. Private insurers covered another 34% of these expenditures and<lb/> households are responsible for the remaining 20% (see <ref type="figure">Figure 7</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<figure>Figure 7. Expenditure on prescribed drugs by source of finance in Canada, 2005<lb/> Source: CIHI, 2006.<lb/> Provincial/ Territorial<lb/> Governments<lb/> 39%<lb/> Private Insurers<lb/> 34%<lb/> Households<lb/> 20%<lb/> Federal direct<lb/> 3%<lb/> Social security funds -<lb/>Workers&apos; Compensations<lb/> boards<lb/> 1%<lb/> Social security funds -<lb/>Quebec Drug insurance<lb/> fund<lb/> 3%<lb/> 164.<lb/> As a consequence of discrepancies in the scope of provincial and territorial drug plans, public<lb/> financing of prescribed drug expenditures varies widely across provinces, from 32% in New Brunswick to<lb/> 70% in the Northwest Territories (Table 2).<lb/> 165.<lb/> Households&apos; expenditures on drugs averaged $218 per family 56 in 2002, an increase of 71% (in<lb/> 2002 dollars) since 1992 (Luffman, 2005). Drug spending represented 25% of households&apos; expenditures on<lb/> health, of which 16% were out-of-pocket payments for partly subsidised drugs and 9% payments for other<lb/> drugs. Premiums paid by households for private health insurance represented another 34% of households&apos;<lb/> health expenditures. Again, the situation differed across Canada. In Saskatchewan, families spent 27% of<lb/> their health care dollar on prescription drugs (CAN$ 386), while families in Ontario and Alberta spent the<lb/> least (13%, CAN$ 188).<lb/> 166.<lb/> These variations can also be seen when drug expenditures are considered as a share of household<lb/> income. In Canada, 6.5% of families spend more than 3% of their after-tax income on pharmaceuticals<lb/> This proportion reaches 15.9% in Saskatchewan, 11.7% in Prince Edward Island, about 10% in New<lb/> Brunswick and Manitoba, and 9% in Québec and Nova Scotia (Luffman, 2005).<lb/> 2.3. Pharmaceutical industry presence and activities<lb/> 167.<lb/> According to Statistics Canada, 262 companies are operating in the pharmaceutical<lb/> manufacturing industry and employing about 30,000 people in Canada in 2005. R&amp;D-based companies<lb/> provide two-thirds of employment, with about 49 generic companies accounting for the balance (Industry<lb/> Canada, 2006 and Industry Canada website).<lb/> 56<lb/> When only consumers are considered, this average expenditure amounted to $378. 35% of respondents to<lb/> this households&apos; expenditures survey did not report drug expenditures.<lb/></figure>

			<head>2.3.1. Production<lb/></head>

			<p>168.<lb/> In 2003, Canada ranked 9 th among OECD countries for the production of pharmaceuticals (<ref type="figure">Figure<lb/> 8</ref>). Related to its population, however, this represents a rather low level of production ($261 per person, i.e.<lb/> 2/3 of the OECD average).<lb/> 169.<lb/> Generic manufacturers have a notable presence in Canada, with a production oriented both<lb/> towards the internal market and exports. The sector is highly concentrated, with 60% of market volumes<lb/> being sold by two companies and 90% by twelve companies (data from PMPRB and CGPA at different<lb/> dates, quoted in <ref type="biblio">Skinner, 2004</ref>). However, concentration has declined considerably since 1996, when 90%<lb/> of the market was shared by two firms (personal communication with Health Canada officials).<lb/></p>

			<head>2.3.2. Trade<lb/></head>

			<p>170.<lb/> Canada imports 45% of its domestic supply of pharmaceuticals and exports more than 80% of its<lb/> production. Relative to many other OECD countries, Canada is not a particularly significant exporter of<lb/> pharmaceuticals, but has notably greater relative importance as an importer. It shows a trade deficit for<lb/> pharmaceuticals, as do more than half of OECD countries (<ref type="figure">Figure 9</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<figure>Figure 9. Trade balance for pharmaceuticals in OECD countries, 2003<lb/> (1) 2001.<lb/> Source: OECD Health Data, 2005.<lb/> -16000<lb/> -8000<lb/> 0<lb/> 8000<lb/> Switzerland<lb/> Ireland (1)<lb/> France<lb/> United Kingdom<lb/> Sweden<lb/> Germany<lb/> Denmark<lb/> Belgium<lb/> Netherlands<lb/> Austria<lb/> Iceland<lb/> OECD<lb/> Norway<lb/> New Zealand<lb/> Italy<lb/> Hungary<lb/> Finland<lb/> Slovak Republic<lb/> Portugal<lb/> Mexico<lb/> Greece<lb/> Czech Republic<lb/> Australia<lb/> Spain<lb/> Canada<lb/> Poland<lb/> United States<lb/> millions USD PPP<lb/> 171.<lb/> The United States is Canada&apos;s most important partner in pharmaceutical trade. Nearly half of<lb/> Canada&apos;s pharmaceutical imports in 2002 came from the United States. 57 In the same year, 81% of<lb/> Canada&apos;s pharmaceutical exports went to the United States (US Department of Commerce, 2004).<lb/> 172.<lb/> The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) had a significant impact on the Canadian<lb/> pharmaceutical market by eliminating tariffs and facilitating imports and exports of pharmaceutical<lb/> products. From the perspective of US pharmaceutical manufacturers who export medicines to Canada,<lb/> benefits of NAFTA include greater transparency in Canadian government rule-making and stronger<lb/> intellectual property rights and enforcement (US Department of Commerce, 2004). NAFTA also benefited<lb/> Canadian manufacturers that export pharmaceutical products to the United States. From 1992 to 2002,<lb/> Canada&apos;s exports to the United States increased 487%, while its imports from the United States increased<lb/> by 125%.<lb/> Figure 10.<lb/> Trends in pharmaceutical imports and exports in Canada 1980-2003<lb/> Source: OECD Health Data, 2005.<lb/> 0<lb/> 1000<lb/> 2000<lb/> 3000<lb/> 4000<lb/> 5000<lb/> 6000<lb/> 7000<lb/> Box 8. Cross-border trade<lb/> Given relatively high US drug prices, proximity to Canada, and gaps in US insurance coverage, there is a long history<lb/> of some degree of sales by Canadian pharmacies to US consumers.<lb/> 58 The development and expansion of Internet<lb/> pharmacies provided a boost to this activity. Between 2002 and 2003, the value of pharmaceutical purchases made by<lb/> Canadian Internet pharmacies (primarily for cross-border sales) doubled (IMS, 2006). Sales peaked in 2004 at a level<lb/> representing 8% of total Canadian prescription drug sales.<lb/></figure>

			<p>Since then, manufacturers (most of which are Canadian subsidiaries of multinational firms with headquarters in the<lb/> United States or Europe) began to tighten up the supplies to wholesalers suspected of providing drugs to Internet<lb/> pharmacies, though they committed to ensuring there would be an adequate supply of medicine for the Canadian<lb/> market. Physician and pharmacy regulatory associations also increased enforcement of professional standards,<lb/> issuing fines and suspending the licenses of medical practitioners found contravening good prescribing practices. At a<lb/> national level, no shortages were ever documented, although pharmacists reported some delays in receiving stock as<lb/> needed.<lb/></p>

			<head>59<lb/></head>

			<p>More recently, the pressure has diminished: Implementation of Medicare Part D in the United States has reduced<lb/> some of the political and media attention. The strengthening of the Canadian dollar against the US dollar has also<lb/> probably contributed to reduced demand. And manufacturers&apos; activities, which have not been contested by the<lb/> Canadian competition authorities, have put pressure on pharmacists and physicians to clamp down on cross-border<lb/> trade. Sales revenues from cross-border trade have dropped, but there is speculation that this may reflect only a shift<lb/> in trade from brand-name pharmaceuticals to products which are Canadian generic therapeutic equivalents of US<lb/> products still under patent protection.<lb/> 58<lb/> In the Prescription Drug Marketing Act of 1988, the US Congress banned the re-importation of U.S.-made<lb/> prescription drugs to prevent potentially unsafe repackaging and to minimize exposure to counterfeit<lb/> products. Only medications for approved emergency care, those re-imported by original manufacturers, and<lb/> those imported in small quantities for personal use are exempt (<ref type="biblio">Ward, 2004</ref>).<lb/> 59<lb/> Personal communication with Health Canada officials.<lb/></p>

			<head>2.3.3. Investments and activities in research and development<lb/></head>

			<p>173.<lb/> R&amp;D investments and activities are important features of the pharmaceutical industry. With the<lb/> adoption of the 1987 amendments to the Patent Act, R&amp;D, the organisation representing brand name<lb/> manufacturers in Canada, made a public commitment to increase their members&apos; annual R&amp;D expenditures<lb/> as a percentage of domestic sales to 10% by 1996, in exchange for strengthened intellectual property rights<lb/> protection. As a result, the R&amp;D-to-sales ratio increased to a maximum of</p>

			<table>11.5% in 1998 but has since<lb/> declined to 8.3% in 2005. In 2005, 80 companies reported total R&amp;D expenditures amounting to<lb/> CAN$1.23 billion 60 , representing 8.8% of their sales (PMPRB, 2006a).<lb/> 174.<lb/> Pharmaceutical companies concentrate their R&amp;D spending in two provinces, Québec and<lb/> Ontario, which represent 45.6% and 42.9% of Canadian private R&amp;D expenditures, respectively (PMPRB,<lb/> 2005a).<lb/> 175.<lb/> International comparisons of R&amp;D expenditure data raise a number of methodological problems<lb/> and no complete statistics are available to compare investments in R&amp;D in all OECD countries (OECD,<lb/> 2005; EFPIA<ref type="biblio">, 2005; Vekeman, 2005; PMPRB, 2002</ref>). Moreover, indicators used for decades have begun to<lb/> lose some significance in the context of globalisation of the pharmaceutical industry. For instance, the ratio<lb/> of R&amp;D expenditures to domestic sales is of limited value as a metric since multinational pharmaceutical<lb/> companies finance R&amp;D undertaken in a particular country through their global sales revenue 61 .<lb/> 176.<lb/> According to data collected by OECD, Canada spent $US 985 million (adjusted to reflect cross-<lb/>national differences in purchasing power parity) for R&amp;D in pharmaceuticals in 2003, ranking 7 th among<lb/> OECD countries for which data are available 62 (<ref type="biblio">OECD, 2005</ref>). This represents 0.1% of GDP, a level<lb/> comparable to that of Germany, the United States, Spain, Finland and the Netherlands, but below the<lb/> shares of GDP observed in Sweden (0.6%), Belgium and Denmark (0.4%), the United Kingdom (0.3%)<lb/> and France (0.2%). Related to population, pharmaceutical companies&apos; expenditures for R&amp;D in Canada<lb/> represent US$27 per capita compared with an OECD average of US$45. Thus, although Canada figures<lb/> among the greatest investors in pharmaceutical R&amp;D, its investments related to income or per capita are<lb/> lower than those of leaders in pharmaceutical R&amp;D. Moreover, R&amp;D investments tended to decline in the<lb/> recent years, both in absolute terms and in share of domestic sales (PMPRB, 2005).<lb/> 177. However, other indicators may be used to assess the level of pharmaceutical R&amp;D undertaken in<lb/> Canada. Overall, Canada&apos;s intramural expenditures in pharmaceutical R&amp;D represent about 2% of those of<lb/> all OECD countries 63 . This corresponds roughly both to its market share on the worldwide pharmaceutical<lb/> market (2%, according to IMS quoted by <ref type="biblio">Industry Canada, 2006</ref>) and to its share of worldwide wealth<lb/></p>

Of 24 biotech drugs approved for sale on the world market, 3 come from Canadian firms<lb/> (12.5%). The biotech industry benefits from strong federal support.<lb/></p>

			<head>2.3.4. Product launches in Canada<lb/></head>

			<p>180.<lb/> Although it represents only 2% of worldwide pharmaceutical sales (IMS, quoted by Industry<lb/> <ref type="biblio">Canada, 2006</ref>), Canada appears to be a relatively attractive market for prompt launching of new products.<lb/> Data from the pharmaceutical industry show that manufacturers submit an application for market approval<lb/> in Canada about 6.1 months, on average, from the time of the first application in any world market (<ref type="biblio">PICTF,<lb/> 2006</ref>). This is about double the average US time (2.9 months), but is lower than any of the other 11<lb/> countries included in the study, and comparable to the United Kingdom (6.1 months) and Switzerland (6.5<lb/> months). Japan was an outlier with an average lag of 16.6 months.<lb/> 181.<lb/> The time from market approval to product launch in the market is also notably short in Canada –<lb/> just 1.7 months, the lowest of a dozen countries included in a recent pharmaceutical industry report<lb/> (Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry, quoted in PICTF, 2006). Delays may be longer in<lb/> countries where market launch is more closely linked to pricing and reimbursement decisions.<lb/> 182.<lb/> The uptake of new products is rather good on the Canadian market, which renders it attractive for<lb/> the pharmaceutical industry. Indeed, new products launched within the last 5 years represent about 22% of<lb/> the market, which is close to the equivalent percentages for the French, German and Australian markets,<lb/> below the US market share (27%) and above that for the Italian, Swiss, British and Japanese markets (16%,<lb/> for the latest) (IMS world review, quoted by PICTF report, 2006).<lb/></p>

			<head>2.3.5. Efforts by manufacturers to influence physicians&apos; prescribing behaviour<lb/></head>

			<p>183.<lb/> In order to profit from their investments in the development of new products, manufacturers must<lb/> do what they can to encourage physicians to prescribe them, irrespective of whether those products<lb/> represent improvements over other treatments. Manufacturers gain revenues when a physician prescribes<lb/> their drug instead of the therapeutic alternative or bioequivalent product produced by a competitor, as well<lb/> as when physicians favour a newer (and more costly) formulation over an older version still on the market.<lb/> In Canada, therefore, as in other OECD countries, pharmaceutical manufacturers use a range of strategies<lb/> to influence physicians&apos; prescribing behaviour, ranging from the deployment of sales representatives to<lb/> physicians&apos; offices (a practice known as detailing) to inform them about products, to sponsorship of<lb/> continuing medical education activities relating to treatment of conditions and use of pharmaceutical<lb/> products. Manufacturers also advertise products to physicians through print and other media.<lb/></p>

			<figure>184.<lb/> There is some indication of a potential increase over time in the level of advertising directed to<lb/> physicians, which could be explained by a number of factors. The number of advertisements for<lb/> prescription drugs submitted to Canada&apos;s Pharmaceutical Advertising Advisory Board (PAAB) for review<lb/> increased 13% in 2005, as compared with 2004. In 2005, the Board conducted 4,444 reviews, up from<lb/> 3,921 in 2004 (Pharmaceutical Advertising Advisory Board, 2006). 66 The total number of annual reviews<lb/> has nearly doubled since 1998. 67<lb/></figure>

			<head>2.3.6. Efforts by manufacturers to influence pharmacists&apos; dispensing behaviour<lb/></head>

			<p>185.<lb/> As is true in some other OECD countries, generic drug manufacturers often furnish Canadian<lb/> pharmacists with rebates and gifts to encourage purchases and/or exclusive purchasing (<ref type="biblio">Skinner, 2004</ref>).<lb/> However, these practices are not allowed in all provinces. In Québec, manufacturers are not allowed to<lb/> give further reductions to bulk purchase prices and commit themselves not to give rebates or discounts, and<lb/> not to provide free goods to distributors. Ontario&apos;s drug bill 102, passed in 2006, outlaws all supplier-to-<lb/>pharmacy rebates with the exception of a prompt payment discount and some allowance for professional<lb/> spending. Moreover, guidelines are provided by the Canadian Generic Pharmaceutical Association<lb/> (CGPA), but the ability to enforce compliance with guidelines (particularly for non-members) is limited.<lb/> 66<lb/> The PAAB reviews advertising of prescription and OTC products to health professionals in all media. All<lb/> advertising materials reviewed by PAAB (including certain promotional materials aimed at consumers –<lb/> see below) are voluntarily submitted. The PAAB code is used for review and pre-clearance of advertising<lb/> materials directed at health professionals, whereas Health Canada guidelines are used by the PAAB in<lb/> reviewing help-seeking and reminder ads aimed at consumers.<lb/> 67<lb/> The current Commissioner of PAAB, Ray Chepesiuk, took office in 1998. He attributes the accelerated<lb/> growth in reviews beginning in that year to increased compliance by industry.<lb/></p>

			<head>2.3.7. Direct-to-consumer advertising<lb/></head>

			<p>186.<lb/> Advertising prescription medicines to prospective patients – so-called direct-to-consumer<lb/> advertising (DTCA) – is prohibited by Canadian law, as is the case in most other OECD countries 68 .<lb/> Nevertheless, although advertisements that include both the product name and specific therapeutic claims<lb/> are forbidden 69 , Canadians are exposed to some DTCA. Indeed, they are an audience for DTCA (television<lb/> or other media) that originates in the United States 70 , where advertisements that meet established<lb/> regulatory guidelines are allowed. And in recent years, Canadian advertisements that mention a product<lb/> name without stating its use (&apos;reminder ads&apos;) and those that inform consumers of new but unspecified<lb/> treatment options of diseases or conditions (&apos;help-seeking advertisements&apos;) have become common,<lb/> following interpretations issued by Health Canada in 1996 and 2000 which first implied and then asserted<lb/> that these were legally permissible (<ref type="biblio">Gardner et al., 2003</ref>). 71 Health Canada has consulted with key<lb/> stakeholders, health professionals and advocacy groups and has been reviewing the policy on DTCA as<lb/> part of an overall initiative on health protection legislation renewal.<lb/> 187.<lb/> Such advertising is likely to play a non-negligible role in driving up Canadian consumers&apos;<lb/> demand for medicines. 72 It has been shown to affect prescribing volume as well as product choice (<ref type="biblio">Mintzes<lb/> et al., 2003</ref>).<lb/> 188.<lb/> While DTCA and the additional consumption of pharmaceutical products which it gives rise to<lb/> are believed to have both positive and negative effects on the health of Canadians, the net impact is<lb/> difficult to assess. Proponents cite the potential value of advertising in boosting detection and appropriate<lb/> care of under-diagnosed and under-treated health conditions (e.g., hypertension), resulting in benefits to<lb/> patients. Opponents 73 argue that advertising encourages consumers to seek care for conditions that do not<lb/> require treatment, pressures physicians to prescribe unsuitable medicines, promotes the use of new<lb/> medicines for which the post-market safety profile is incomplete, and favours certain therapies in cases<lb/> where alternative treatments would be more appropriate. DTCA may result in higher prices, to the extent<lb/> that advertising expenses incurred by manufacturers are not fully met by increased revenues from higher<lb/> consumption. The question of whether a vehicle intended to promote sales can be regulated adequately to<lb/> make it a valuable source of information is also at issue.<lb/></p>

			<head>2.4. Supply/distribution of pharmaceuticals<lb/></head>

			<p>This section describes and assesses the pharmaceutical supply chain in Canada, as well as policies and<lb/> other factors that influence (or are intended to influence) the supply of pharmaceuticals.<lb/></p>

			<head>2.4.1. Recent changes in the distribution chain and impact<lb/></head>

			<p>189.<lb/> In 2005, 58% of pharmaceutical sales by manufacturers were made to distributors and<lb/> wholesalers, 30% to self-distributing retail chains, and 12% directly to retail pharmacies and hospitals<lb/> (IMS, quoted by the Canadian Association for Pharmacy Distribution Management 74 )<lb/> 190.<lb/> The distribution chain has experienced important changes in the past years. Historically, a large<lb/> share of sales to pharmacies has been made directly by manufacturers without use of a wholesaler as<lb/> intermediary: in 1993, direct sales accounted for 44% of total manufacturers&apos; sales. During the 1990s, there<lb/> has been a shift from direct supply towards sales to big wholesalers, as well as changes in the retail sector,<lb/> with fewer independent pharmacies and the entrance of mass merchandisers and grocers (PMPRB, 2005c).<lb/> In the same period, manufacturers&apos; behaviors have changed. According to the PMPRB, manufacturers are<lb/> now less inclined to accept orders from retail pharmacies and tend to implement or increase levels of<lb/> &quot; minimum purchase &quot; . On average, minimum purchase sizes increased from CAN$242 in 1997 to<lb/> CAN$2,167 in 2004.<lb/> 191.<lb/> The PMPRB measured the impact of these changes in the distribution channels on distribution<lb/> costs 75 for 7 public plans, assuming an average wholesale margin of 5%. The Board estimated that these<lb/> changes lead to an additional cost of 40% over the 1997-2004 period for provincial plans and their<lb/> beneficiaries (PMPRB, 2005c). Distribution costs estimated by the PMPRB for 2003-2004 added on<lb/> average from 10.8% (NIHB) to 24% (BC) to ingredient costs in public plans&apos; expenditures.<lb/></p>

			<head>2.4.2. Role of pharmacies and pharmacists<lb/></head>

			<p>192.<lb/> There are several types of pharmacies in Canada. Independent pharmacies are pharmacies owned<lb/> by a proprietor who does not own more than five pharmacies. Banner pharmacies are independent<lb/> pharmacies which are affiliated with a central office and pay fees for the right to use a recognized name<lb/> and to participate in central buying, marketing, professional programs, etc. Franchises are run by operators<lb/> who do not necessarily own the physical store or fixtures, and franchise arrangements vary across Canada.<lb/> There are also chain pharmacies, supermarket pharmacies (departments of supermarkets) and mass-<lb/>merchandiser/department store pharmacies, which are pharmacy departments within large retail outlets,<lb/> such as Wal-Mart. In all these cases, pharmacy managers are employed to implement policies defined by<lb/> head offices, who direct functions such as buying, marketing, professional programs, etc. (<ref type="biblio">Trends and<lb/> Insights, 2005</ref>). In 2003, the top five pharmacy chains and banners dispensed 40% of all prescriptions in<lb/></p>

			<table>Canada (PMPRB, 2005c).<lb/> 74<lb/> http://www.capdm.ca/industry_facts/facts.asp, accessed on May 14, 2006.<lb/> 75<lb/> Distribution costs defined by the PMPRB do not include pharmacists&apos; margins or fees, but only covers the<lb/> cost of &apos;intermediaries&apos; between the manufacturer and the retailer.<lb/> 193.<lb/> The number of pharmacies in Canada has increased steadily in recent years, growing from a total<lb/> of 7,144 (1 per 4,342 people) in 2001 to 7,585 (1 per 4,212 people) in 2004. 76 During that period, the<lb/> number of independent pharmacies declined (from 2069 to 1638), while the number of chain pharmacies<lb/> increased (from 3,914 to 4,444</table>

			<p>), as did the relatively small but rapidly growing share of pharmacies located<lb/> in stores focused on food or mass merchandise (up from 544 to 1,503) (IMS Health <ref type="biblio">Canada, 2006</ref>).<lb/> 194.<lb/> The distribution of pharmacies across Canada&apos;s largest provinces is relatively consistent, at about<lb/> 1 pharmacy per 5,000 people. In absolute terms, Ontario has the most pharmacies, 2,869 in 2004<lb/> (approximately 1 pharmacy per 5,000 residents) and Nunavut, with 3 pharmacies in 2004 (approximately 1<lb/> pharmacy per 10,000 residents), the fewest (IMS Health Canada, 2006b).<lb/> 195.<lb/> The fees charged by pharmacists for dispensing a prescription medicine, along with retail mark-<lb/>ups, affect the prices paid by consumers, as do the reimbursement policies of any third-party payers<lb/> involved in the transaction. Dispensing fees vary across pharmacies and provinces, as do the norms<lb/> regarding prescription amounts or sizes, which determine how often a patient will need to have a<lb/> prescription refilled. Third-party payers also establish schedules by which dispensing fees and mark-up<lb/> rates will be reimbursed by the payer.<lb/> 76<lb/> In addition, there were an estimated 278 Internet pharmacies based in Canada as of <ref type="biblio">June 2005 (Skinner,<lb/> 2006</ref>). Cross-border sales (primarily to US customers) represented about 70% of the sales of these<lb/> pharmacies.<lb/></p>

			<head>3. ACHIEVEMENT OF POLICY GOALS<lb/></head>

			<p>196.<lb/> This section describes the degree to which certain policy goals relating to pharmaceuticals are<lb/> being achieved in Canada and attempts to assess the impact of Canada&apos;s pharmaceutical pricing policies on<lb/> the attainment of these goals.<lb/></p>

			<head>3.1. Containment of drug expenditures<lb/></head>

			<p>197.<lb/> In recent years, Canada&apos;s real annual growth in pharmaceutical spending has been among the<lb/> highest in the OECD, despite the fact that Canada&apos;s real growth in health spending as a whole has been<lb/> comparable to the OECD average. This trend, common to most OECD countries, may be partly due to<lb/> some substitution between components of health care (pharmaceuticals versus hospitalisation) as well as<lb/> the extension of efforts to prevent health risks by employing pharmaceuticals as part of long-term<lb/> treatments for chronic health conditions such as high cholesterol, hypertension, and diabetes. The trend<lb/> might also reflect policy decisions to focus cost-containment efforts on the relatively more costly hospital<lb/> sector, or could indicate that cost-containment efforts directed towards the hospital or other sectors have<lb/> had relatively better success. It could also be related to the impact on Canadian drug prescribing and<lb/> consumption patterns of US-originated Direct-to-Consumer Advertising, much of which Canadians are<lb/> exposed to via their access to American television advertising and Internet sources.<lb/> 198.<lb/> Unlike many other OECD countries, there have not been explicit policy goals at the national level<lb/> in Canada pertaining to containment of pharmaceutical expenditures. This likely relates to the relatively<lb/> limited direct role of the federal government in the administration and delivery of drug coverage for<lb/> pharmaceuticals. The rationale for government intervention was primarily guided by consideration as to<lb/> whether there is a need to offset the monopoly power of manufacturers of patented products in order to<lb/> protect consumers. Thus, it follows that Canada has not employed policy levers such as the PMPRB in<lb/> explicit cost-containment endeavours such as across-the-board price freezes or general price reductions on<lb/> existing products, an approach used for cost-containment in many other OECD countries where ensuring<lb/> adequate public financing for a higher share of pharmaceutical costs is a matter of national government<lb/> concern. The PMPRB has no mandate to ensure low prices for prescription drugs in Canada, but is<lb/> concerned rather with ensuring prices are not &quot; excessive, &quot; according to an arguably generous standard.<lb/> Indeed, in this respect the PMPRB is successful, as Canadian prices of patented drugs vary in a range of<lb/> 10% from the median price in comparator countries.<lb/> 199.<lb/> However, the situation has changed recently. In both the 2000 Communiqué on Health and the<lb/> 2003 Accord on Health Care Renewal, First Ministers identified pharmaceuticals management as a<lb/> priority. In September 2004, First Ministers affirmed their commitment to a range of pharmaceuticals<lb/> management actions under the National Pharmaceuticals Strategy, a part of the 10-Year Plan to Strengthen<lb/> Health Care. The NPS includes a number of cost control and expenditure-management related elements<lb/> and addresses interconnected pharmaceutical policy issues around coverage and costs. Further, cost control<lb/> and expenditure management is a key aspect of earlier Federal-Provincial-Territorial collaborative<lb/> pharmaceuticals initiatives such as the Common Drug Review, of which the federal government is both a<lb/> funder and an active participant, as well as a direct beneficiary for the public plans under its jurisdiction.<lb/> 200.<lb/> Until now, concern about drug costs has been decentralised in Canada to the level of third-party<lb/> payers, whether public or private, and to the hospitals which purchase medicines for in-patient use under<lb/> the constraint of a defined drug budget. To date, private payers have had minimal incentive to implement<lb/> cost-control activities, but reported growing cost concerns from the employers who sponsor coverage for<lb/> most Canadians may indicate a changing trend in future. In the publicly-funded drug plans, cost-<lb/>containment efforts are used to various degrees, but most measures influence expenditures by constraining<lb/> the type and amount of drugs reimbursed, rather than the reimbursement price paid.<lb/> 201.<lb/> With respect to purchasers, there is some activity on the pricing side of the equation:<lb/> Reimbursement prices have been frozen on at least one occasion in at least two Canadian provinces, for<lb/> example. But the fact that there is little variation in prices paid across Canada – taking into account both<lb/> passive private insurers and less passive public payers – suggests that price-related activities undertaken by<lb/> drug purchasers are not particularly important.<lb/> 202.<lb/> On the other hand, to greater or lesser degrees, Canada&apos;s publicly-financed drug plans have been<lb/> using formulary management in order to contain costs, as well as to support appropriate and cost-effective<lb/> prescribing and utilisation. Increasing use of programmes to provide exceptional access to drugs not<lb/> included in provincial formularies suggests that such controls may be tightening. Although many private<lb/> plans have traditionally operated under an &quot; open access &quot; scheme, plans are increasingly offering restricted<lb/> formulary alternatives for employers concerned about cost-containment. Canadian jurisdictions with<lb/> relatively tight formularies have lower use of medicines and lower per capita drug expenditures.<lb/> 203.<lb/> Similarly, Canada&apos;s third-party payers make use of patient cost-sharing requirements which have<lb/> the effect of shifting some of the cost burden for prescription drug expenditures to individuals. Evidence<lb/> shows that some Canadian cost-sharing levels are high enough to suppress demand notably for medicines,<lb/> including drugs considered essential as well as less important or more discretionary medicines (<ref type="biblio">Tamblyn et<lb/> al., 2001</ref>). Limited use of reference pricing schemes and tiered co-payments suggests that these measures<lb/> are not generally used to steer demand to the most cost-effective choices.<lb/></p>

			<head>3.2. Sustainability and equity of financing for pharmaceuticals<lb/></head>

			<p>204.<lb/> Like most OECD countries, Canada has recorded rapid growth in pharmaceutical expenditures<lb/> over the past 15 years. This trend has encouraged policy makers to take steps to increase the efficiency of<lb/> expenditures in order to maintain the sustainability of the system.<lb/> 205.<lb/> The fact that financing is spread over several sources, public and private, may encourage payers<lb/> to shift costs to other sources in reaction to cost pressure. For example, patients have been required to pay<lb/> higher shares of expenditures.<lb/> 206.<lb/> The significant inequity in financing across jurisdictions, which contributes to the large<lb/> differences in pharmaceutical coverage and accessibility seen in Canada, is an important policy concern.<lb/> Reform proposals currently under discussion, including a move to a national formulary and even<lb/> consideration of a uniform national system of coverage, suggest that inequitable financing and the resulting<lb/> outcomes are a particular policy problem in Canada.<lb/></p>

			<head>3.3. Efficiency of expenditures in the pharmaceutical sector<lb/></head>

			<p>207.<lb/> Attention is increasingly being paid to the question of cost-effectiveness and value of<lb/> pharmaceutical expenditures – in particular, on the public expenditure side – but there appears to be scope<lb/> for improving the policy initiatives undertaken along these lines so as to achieve better value for money.<lb/> 208.<lb/> At a macro level, there is cause for considering that gaps or shortfalls in coverage – particularly,<lb/> but not only, the estimated 2% of Canadians lacking insurance (<ref type="biblio">Fraser Group &amp; Tristat Resources, 2002</ref>) –<lb/> could lead to costly adverse events in cases where drug use is foregone due to financial barriers, or to<lb/> substitution with more expensive health services (see Box 6 above).<lb/> 209.<lb/> As in other OECD countries, the impact of having multiple payers for different services and/or<lb/> sector-specific budgets raises concerns due to its potential creation of incentives to shift cost in ways that<lb/> may promote inefficiencies in health care delivery. Health systems where one payer has primary<lb/> responsibility for paying both hospital and drug bills have greater incentives to consider the overall cost-<lb/>effectiveness of healthcare delivery by promoting substitution of less-expensive medicines for more costly<lb/> surgeries, where appropriate, for example.<lb/> 210.<lb/> On another level, however, there are policies to promote value for money in drug expenditures<lb/> for those with publicly financed coverage. Notably, the Common Drug Review, which plays an important<lb/> role in the coverage decisions affecting accessibility of drugs in Canada, entails centralized assessment of a<lb/> product&apos;s cost-effectiveness relative to therapeutic alternatives. Considering that about half of the drug<lb/> reviews by the CDR as of August 24, 2006, have resulted in recommendations to the participating federal,<lb/> provincial, and territorial drug plans that the drug in question not be listed, the hurdle of acceptance is not<lb/> insignificant. As many of the recommendations not to list are made on the grounds that the drug is not<lb/> shown to be cost-effective at the offered price, the CDR is an important tool in the effort to obtain value for<lb/> money in public expenditures on prescription drugs.<lb/> 211.<lb/> Following the Common Drug Review, which is a non-binding advisory service for participating<lb/> plans, the publicly financed plans have formulary consideration processes to make reimbursement<lb/> decisions. While provincial reimbursement decisions that have been made are generally consistent with<lb/> CDR recommendations, variations exist. These decisions may reflect different standards for cost-<lb/>effectiveness, concerns about the potential budgetary impact of a product (even one considered to be cost-<lb/>effective), or other local factors.<lb/> 212.<lb/> Once a drug has cleared these hurdles, there are very few policy levers used to promote cost-<lb/>effective prescribing, dispensing and use of medicines by patients, however. Federal initiatives such as the<lb/> Canadian Optimal Medication Prescribing and Utilization Service (COMPUS) are quite new and remain<lb/> focused on fostering change by providing information and evidence, lacking levers for rewards or<lb/> penalties. Efforts to steer choice of medicines to the product offering highest value for money through<lb/> reference-price schemes or lowest-cost alternative reimbursement methods are not widely used.<lb/> 213.<lb/> Evidence suggests that Canada is taking advantage of opportunities to obtain value from generic<lb/> products, although there is scope for improvement here as well. Canada is one of only a few countries with<lb/> high penetration of generic products in its pharmaceutical market. On the price side, the story is more<lb/> mixed. While, in most cases, generic products are available at prices significantly lower than originators,<lb/> this is not universally true and many or most comparator countries have lower prices for generic products.<lb/> Lack of competition among manufacturers of generic drugs may be one explanation for the shortcomings<lb/> in price competition. Furthermore, lack of regulation in many provinces of discounts and rebates provided<lb/> by manufacturers to pharmacies suggests that there are rents being captured at the retail level that do not<lb/> carry over to low consumer prices for generic drugs.<lb/></p>

			<head>3.4. Availability of pharmaceuticals<lb/></head>

			<p>214.<lb/> An important policy question is the extent to which state-of-the-art medicines are available for<lb/> purchase in Canada. Factors affecting availability include product approval timing and outcomes, as well<lb/> as manufacturers&apos; launch decisions and marketing strategies. Although the evidence is mixed, a reasonable<lb/> conclusion is that, in general, the vast majority of new pharmaceuticals are launched in Canada promptly.<lb/> In comparison with other high-income OECD countries, availability of medicines in Canada appears quite<lb/> comprehensive and timely. On the other hand, there are exceptional cases of non-availability, some of<lb/> which reflect peculiar characteristics of the Canadian policy environment (e.g., product launch decisions<lb/> affected either by PMPRB pricing regulation and/or the cross-border trade with the United States). These<lb/> exceptional cases receive considerable attention in the media, where often concerns are conflated with<lb/> accessibility problems 77 (discussed below).<lb/> 215.<lb/> Some evidence of timely market availability of drugs in Canada comes from an evaluation of the<lb/> average time from the first world application for marketing approval to launch in various markets,<lb/> considering products launched between 1999 and 2003 (ABPI quoted by <ref type="biblio">PICTF, 2006</ref>). By this measure,<lb/> Canada does not appear to have an unusual delay in availability. 78 Further evidence of good availability<lb/> comes from a study by <ref type="biblio">Danzon and Furukawa (2003)</ref> that documented the availability of 249 molecules<lb/> with strong US market presence in 1999. 95% of these molecules were available in Canada, and only<lb/> Germany and the United Kingdom had a higher match (respectively 97% and 98%). Moreover,<lb/> corresponding products accounted for 61% of sales in the Canadian market, which is equivalent to the<lb/> market share of these molecules in the United States. This indicates consistency with the US market as far<lb/> as top-selling drugs are concerned.<lb/> 216.<lb/> On the other hand, a study using more recent data found evidence of some delayed availability in<lb/> Canada, as compared with the United States, including in the case of some drugs assessed as improvements<lb/> over existing therapies (<ref type="biblio">Lexchin, 2006</ref>). 79 Of the 37 drugs in the sample, 32 were not available in Canada.<lb/> Of those not available, 19 were judged to bring &apos;little or no improvement&apos; compared to available therapies.<lb/> However, 6 were considered to bring moderate improvement and 1 drug offered an improvement classified<lb/> as significant. 80<lb/> 217.<lb/> As noted, there is also anecdotal evidence of instances in which availability of new products<lb/> appears impaired in Canada, by comparison to the United States or other markets. Recently, several<lb/> newspapers related the case of a cancer drug whose manufacturer has opted not to launch it in Canada<lb/> because it is not willing to comply with PMPRB requirements on price. 81 The drug sells in Western Europe<lb/> for about €4,000 per month and in the United States for more than twice that price. Because the drug is not<lb/> available on the Canadian market, availability of the drug has been limited to successful applicants to<lb/> 77<lb/> In many, but not all OECD countries, availability and accessibility of medicines are quite closely linked, as<lb/> in the case of countries with a single national formulary (where decisions not to list a drug can have very<lb/> significant impact on sales prospects). In Canada, these dimensions of policy performance are more<lb/> distinct, given the multiplicity of payers (including some with open access) and formularies, and thus are<lb/> treated separately here.<lb/> 78<lb/> Drugs introduced between 1999 and 2003 were available in Canada an average of 26.8 months after the<lb/> manufacturer placed its first application for marketing anywhere in the world. While the United States had<lb/> the shortest time lag, at 19 months, followed by Germany (24.4 months) and the United Kingdom (24.5<lb/> months), Canada&apos;s lag was comparable to that of Switzerland (25.2 months), Sweden (25.5 months) and<lb/> the Netherlands (27.2 months), and considerably shorter than that of Spain (30.3 months), Australia (30.4<lb/> months), Italy (31.5 months), France (32.</p>

			<table>2 months) and Japan (43.9 months).<lb/> 79<lb/> The sample was composed of products for which assessment had been published in the Canadian edition of<lb/> the Medical Letter between May 12, 2003 and June 21, 2004. The therapeutic value of the drug was rated<lb/> by two clinical pharmacologists and compared with the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) criteria<lb/> for priority review.<lb/> 80<lb/> Two other drugs belong to the first and second categories according to different indications, two others<lb/> belong to the second and third categories and two were not rated because of a lack of information.<lb/> 81<lb/> This situation is summarised in a news article by Lisa Priest, published in the Globe and Mail (2006).<lb/> Health Canada&apos;s Special Access Programme. In an unusual step, Ontario has decided to reimburse the<lb/> costs of treatment for certain patients who receive the treatment in US hospitals. The price paid by Ontario<lb/> is high ($3.6 million for 34 patients treated in the 2005-2006 fiscal year), including the cost of treatments<lb/> in US hospitals on the top of the drug cost. This choice suggests a possible discrepancy between the<lb/> standards used by the PMPRB for judging when a price is excessive and the willingness-to-pay of<lb/> jurisdictions.<lb/></table>

			<p>218.<lb/> Decisions not to launch a product may reflect the categorisation process used by the PMPRB,<lb/> which does not recognise marginal improvements 82 in effectiveness in a therapeutic class as a legitimate<lb/> rationale for price differentials. A further reason for delays in product launches may be manufacturer&apos;s<lb/> concerns about the potential for cross-border trade, particularly in the case of high-cost drugs. There might<lb/> also have been delays reflecting the timing of marketing approval reviews and decisions by Health Canada,<lb/> although average and median review times have improved significantly following the launch in 2003 of<lb/> Health Canada&apos;s Therapeutics Access Strategy, major elements of which were designed to improve the<lb/> performance, efficiency and timeliness of the drug review process. Prompt applications from<lb/> manufacturers for approval to participate in the Canadian market have compensated for any delays to a<lb/> great extent, meaning that drugs are launched on a timely basis, by international standards.<lb/> 219.<lb/> There is little information on the question of whether the health or well-being of Canadians is<lb/> affected by unavailability of certain products on the Canadian market. The Special Access Programme, in<lb/> practice if not by design, serves partly to compensate for some shortfalls in availability of medicines that<lb/> offer some possible benefits to those with a serious or life-threatening condition. Some commentators have<lb/> suggested that limits or delays in availability of medicines is a minor problem in terms of impact, as<lb/> compared with the broader problem of insufficient drug coverage for many populations and gaps in<lb/> coverage. These issues are considered below.<lb/></p>

			<head>3.5. Accessibility of pharmaceuticals<lb/></head>

			<p>220.<lb/> Timely market availability is only one determinant of accessibility of drugs to patients, however;<lb/> affordability is another one. 83 A number of features combine to suggest that there are real limits on<lb/> accessibility of pharmaceuticals in Canada, and that accessibility varies widely, depending on jurisdiction<lb/> and type of coverage.<lb/> 221.<lb/> In this respect, the lack of universal coverage for medicines is an important issue in Canada.<lb/> While programs such as those established by each of Canada&apos;s jurisdictions for high-risk or low-income<lb/> groups help to ensure that those most in need are covered, those who do not qualify for coverage may<lb/> suffer compromised access to medicines with possible negative implications for their health status.<lb/></p>

			<head>82<lb/></head>

			<p>There is great debate as to what constitutes a &quot; significant improvement &quot; and, particularly, whether this is<lb/> considered adequately from the patient perspective. An example was the treatment of Viagra, which was<lb/> categorised for price evaluations with an existing injectible product which provided the same effect with<lb/> less convenience and more discomfort for patients.<lb/> 83<lb/> The significant level of use of the Special Access Program suggests this is an important tool for securing<lb/> timely access to those drugs that are of potential benefit to patients with a serious or life-threatening<lb/> condition, yet accessibility at an affordable price is not ensured through this programme, as payers are not<lb/> obligated to cover their enrolees&apos; costs for drugs made available through the SAP. Nevertheless, this is not<lb/> believed to be a significant problem, as some payers (plans or hospitals) choose to provide coverage.<lb/> Furthermore, many drugs approved through the programme are still in development and provided free of<lb/> charge by manufacturers. Where the drugs are sold, prices are subject to approval by the PMPRB.<lb/> 222.<lb/> Beyond this, Canadians with coverage may experience mediated access to medicines to the extent<lb/> that reimbursement policies restrict coverage of certain medicines through decision-making criteria, and/or<lb/> formulary policy, both of which vary across provinces and territories.<lb/> 223.<lb/> Delays by publicly-financed drug plans in making reimbursement decisions are another factor<lb/> suggesting impaired access for those Canadians with this form of coverage. Many plans allow physicians<lb/> to apply for special-use permission for drugs not listed on a formulary, which promotes accessibility of<lb/> drugs not covered or not yet covered by a patient&apos;s insurer. However, these processes are reportedly<lb/> cumbersome for the physician, acting as a disincentive to application.<lb/> 224.<lb/> Increasing levels of controls and restrictions by third-party payers on use of covered medicines,<lb/> along with increased cost-sharing for medicines, are another source of concern as to drug accessibility in<lb/> Canada. The level of drug benefits furnished by provincial plans has eroded over time. Cost-sharing levels<lb/> are in some cases high enough to impair use of medicines.<lb/></p>

			<head>3.6. Quality of care, health outcomes<lb/></head>

			<p>225.<lb/> There is very little evidence by which to assess the quality of care and health outcomes relating to<lb/> use of pharmaceuticals in Canada, much less to make the link between findings and policies. It is likely<lb/> that shortcomings in coverage – particularly the prevalence in parts of Canada of persons who are<lb/> uninsured or underinsured for pharmaceuticals provided outside hospitals – has an impact on quality of<lb/> care and health outcomes to the extent that persons go without using medicines that would have been<lb/> beneficial in preventing or treating health conditions.<lb/> 226.<lb/> Beyond this, errors resulting from the misuse of pharmaceuticals, including medication errors in<lb/> hospitals, physicians&apos; prescribing errors, errors in prescription medications dispensing, and patient errors in<lb/> using medicines appropriately – have been shown to be common in all OECD countries for which<lb/> assessment has been undertaken, and a leading source of preventable injury to patients. Health Canada<lb/> cites studies (e.g., <ref type="biblio">Wilson, 2001</ref>) reporting that medication errors are the most common single preventable<lb/> cause of patient injury. The toll of such errors, in terms of patient safety and patient care costs, is<lb/> considered to be significant.<lb/> 227.<lb/> Although evidence is limited, there is no particular reason to think the problem is better or worse<lb/> in Canada. For instance, a recent survey by the Commonwealth Fund of sicker adults in several OECD<lb/> countries found no significant difference in the share (10%) of sicker Canadian adults who said they had<lb/> been given the wrong medication or the wrong dosage (<ref type="biblio">Schoen et al., 2005</ref>).<lb/> 228.<lb/> As in many OECD countries, policy makers in Canada have paid increasing attention to the<lb/> problem of medication errors. Improved surveillance systems and innovative payment schemes, such as<lb/> Québec&apos;s policy of reimbursing pharmacists who refuse to dispense a medicine so as to prevent a potential<lb/> error, are examples of policies used to improve quality of care and health outcomes associated with<lb/> pharmaceutical use. As part of 2004 Patient Safety commitments, Health Canada is providing funding for<lb/> the implementation of a new Canadian Medication Incident Reporting and Prevention System (CMIRPS)<lb/> and for the Canadian Patient Safety Institute (CPSI), newly established to address overall medical error.<lb/></p>

			<head>3.7. Public satisfaction with pharmaceutical policies and outcomes<lb/></head>

			<p>229.<lb/> An extensive survey, conducted for use by the Romanow Commission, revealed Canadian views<lb/> and values in the area of pharmaceutical policy. For example, 85% of Canadians favoured policy changes<lb/> to ensure universal drug coverage, although respondents had different views as to whether gaps in<lb/> coverage should be addressed within the current system or the current system should be replaced with a<lb/> national program offering universal coverage. When asked about alternative forms of cost-control, 94%<lb/> said they supported government use of purchasing power to negotiate lower prices, while only 76%<lb/> supported limiting reimbursement to the cheapest effective version of a drug. When asked to choose<lb/> whether decreasing the cost of drugs to governments or supporting research and development of new drugs<lb/> should have higher priority in Canada, 63% named the former, compared with 19% choosing the latter.<lb/> Among the highest users of the health-care system, 24% named R&amp;D as the highest priority.<lb/> 230.<lb/> Pharmaceutical policy and decision-making in Canada, as in many other OECD countries, is not<lb/> particularly transparent, nor are many channels for involvement by patients or consumer representatives<lb/> evident. The Romanow Commission report (2002) concluded that intergovernmental mechanisms in<lb/> Canada lack adequate public input. Since then, initiatives have been promoted by the Federal government<lb/> and Health Canada to improve openness, transparency and public access to information on regulatory<lb/> decisions and on clinical trials. These initiatives include steps to enable public input to the regulatory<lb/> review process for drugs and other health products, and implementation of public registration and<lb/> disclosure of clinical trials information. On June 14, 2006, CADTH announced a decision to expand<lb/> CEDAC membership from 11 to 13, with the inclusion of 2 public representatives, in order to improve<lb/> consumer/patient representation in this instance. Because the interests of Canadian drug consumers and<lb/> patients are so diverse and diffuse, is a very difficult task to ensure that their views are represented<lb/> adequately in the policy-making process. There is a risk that channels created for public input can be<lb/> monopolized by the drug industry, which has the most concentrated economic interests in policy outcomes<lb/> and strong incentives to wield what influence it can. Finding appropriately open and transparent processes<lb/> that provide opportunities for input from all stakeholders is a difficult challenge for Canada and all<lb/> countries seeking optimal outcomes in pharmaceutical policy-making.<lb/> 231.<lb/> Finally, there is some evidence to suggest that Canada&apos;s pharmaceutical policies tend to<lb/> undervalue improvements in treatments that are marginal or non-existent from a therapeutic perspective,<lb/> but significant in terms of patient convenience or other factors. Specifically, the PMPRB categories do not<lb/> permit price premiums for new medicines for which patients may be willing to pay a higher price. This<lb/> discourages the marketing of innovations of this kind (e.g., line extensions, new delivery technology),<lb/> possibly leading to consumer welfare loss and lower public satisfaction than might otherwise be possible<lb/> (particularly if patients become aware of the availability of such products elsewhere).<lb/></p>

			<head>3.8. Industrial policy goals<lb/></head>

			<p>232.<lb/> Like many OECD countries, Canada has an explicit goal of attracting business activities with<lb/> high R&amp;D intensity and in the biotech industry in particular.<lb/> 233.<lb/> The competitiveness of Canada for pharmaceutical companies can be evaluated according to<lb/> several dimensions pertaining to geographical location, human resources skills and labour costs, corporate<lb/> taxes, access to capital and, more specifically, to comparative advantages in the pharmaceutical or<lb/> biotechnological sectors, and to pharmaceutical market dynamics (Government of <ref type="biblio">Canada, 2005</ref>; PICTF,<lb/> 2006; OECD, 2006, KPMG, quoted by Government of Canada, 2005).<lb/> 234.<lb/> Canada presents a number of attractive features for business enterprises: the proximity to the US<lb/> market, allied with NAFTA provisions easing trade with the United States: a highly educated and relatively<lb/> low-cost labour force; a lower marginal rate of corporate tax than the United States and Japan; and a high<lb/> level of access to venture capital (Government of Canada, 2006; OECD, 2006, KPMG quoted by the<lb/> government of Canada, 2005). All these elements, combined with a favourable perception among business<lb/> executives regarding Canada&apos;s business environment, contribute to a good ranking of Canada in the World<lb/> Competitiveness Yearbook of the Institute for Management Development (7th among 61 countries, behind<lb/> the United States, Hong Kong, Singapore, Iceland, Denmark and Australia) 84 (Institute for Management<lb/> Development, 2006).<lb/> 235.<lb/> Although pharmaceutical industry activities continue to grow in Canada, notably in terms of<lb/> production and employment (Industry Canada<ref type="biblio">, 2006</ref>), the attractiveness of Canada for the location of<lb/> pharmaceutical activities in the global context is not easy to assess. Although there are no major<lb/> pharmaceutical firms&apos; headquarters in Canada, the proximity with the United States and relatively low<lb/> labour costs seem to be attractive characteristics for the generic industry, which has a notable presence in<lb/> Canada. Actually, 40% of sales of the generic industry are accounted for by exports, of which 80% go to<lb/> the</p>

			<table>United States.<lb/> 236.<lb/> The attractiveness for R&amp;D activities is less evident: R&amp;D expenditures of companies in Canada<lb/> increased (in absolute terms) until 2002 but declined in 2003 and 2004 (PMPRB<ref type="biblio">, 2006</ref>). Although<lb/> pharmaceutical market factors are important determinants of a firm&apos;s sales revenues, the importance of<lb/> such factors in driving firms&apos; location and R&amp;D investment activities is likely to be secondary to other<lb/> factors. The productivity of Canadian R&amp;D expenditures, assessed by the number of new molecular<lb/> entities launched in the world and originating from Canada, is not particularly high, except in the biotech<lb/> sector.<lb/> 237.<lb/> Nevertheless, it seems that Canada can be judged an attractive market for pharmaceutical<lb/> manufacturers. Manufacturers can expect to obtain prices that are relatively high from a global perspective,<lb/> and in line with Canada&apos;s income levels, and to obtain per capita sales volumes that are comparable to<lb/> those of other markets. Factors that may reduce the attractiveness of the Canadian market, from the<lb/> perspective of manufacturers, include policies that restrict utilisation of certain medicines through<lb/> formulary restrictions and other controls, particularly in publicly financed plans, to the extent that such<lb/> restrictions could result in lower expected sales revenues. However, the fact that the delay between first<lb/> approval in the world and application for approval in Canada by the manufacturer is among the shortest in<lb/> the world suggests that the Canadian market is considered an attractive market for pharmaceuticals.<lb/></p>

			<head>KEY FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS<lb/></head>

			<p>238.<lb/> This paper has undertaken a comprehensive review and assessment of Canada&apos;s pharmaceutical<lb/> pricing and reimbursement policies and the market and policy environment in which those policies operate.<lb/> The findings point to a number of successful accomplishments, as well as outstanding challenges. Among<lb/> the key findings are these:<lb/> ! Regulation has very likely been responsible for bringing the prices of patented medicines in Canada<lb/> roughly in line with European comparators. Of course, this raises the question as to whether European<lb/> price levels are themselves at an appropriate level ---an issue beyond the scope of this case study, but<lb/> an important consideration in the larger policy project to which this case study will contribute.<lb/> ! Reimbursement and other policies have no doubt played a role in the high penetration rate of generic<lb/> products in the Canadian market, yet relatively high generic prices persist, suggesting that there is scope<lb/> for increased efficiency of spending and cost control through policy adjustments.<lb/> ! Canadian third-party payers have largely refrained from undertaking price negotiations with<lb/> manufacturers, foregoing prospective opportunities for containing costs and improving the cost-<lb/>effectiveness of drug expenditures.<lb/> ! In Canada as elsewhere, changes in the mix of medicines that are prescribed and consumed favouring<lb/> new and higher-priced products over old ones are contributing to expenditure growth. Canadian pricing<lb/> policies and the reimbursement policies, such as formulary management, that are employed by public<lb/> plans, seek to ensure that the resulting cost increases are justified in terms of added value.<lb/> ! While the weight of the evidence indicates that availability of medicines on the Canadian market has<lb/> been both comprehensive and prompt, some very recent studies and anecdotal reports suggest that<lb/> maintaining this standard may be an emerging challenge, particularly in the case of certain new<lb/> medicines which succeed in obtaining a very high premium price in US markets.<lb/></p>

			<p>! While all of Canada&apos;s coverage schemes promote access to medicines, differences in cost-sharing<lb/> requirements, timeliness of formulary inclusion decisions and other factors result in differences in<lb/> access to medicines across schemes.<lb/></p>

			<figure>! Canada&apos;s mix of schemes leave a small share of the population without financial protection against the<lb/> risk of catastrophic spending on drugs.<lb/> 239.<lb/> These findings regarding Canadian pricing and reimbursement policies have been drawn on the<lb/> basis of an assessment of the direct impact of the policies in Canada. However, an important consideration<lb/> of ongoing work in the area of pharmaceutical pricing policy is the so-called global and cross-national<lb/> impact of policies. Impacts of interest include the hypothetical effect of pricing and reimbursement policies<lb/> in one country on prices and availability of medicines elsewhere, and the impact of pricing and<lb/> reimbursement policies on investment in pharmaceutical R&amp;D and the resulting impact on pharmaceutical<lb/> innovation. These issues have been alluded to in this report without being directly assessed. This case<lb/> study of Canada will provide input into OECD work to assess the hypothetical global and cross-national<lb/> impact of different pricing and reimbursement schemes and policies.<lb/> ANNEX: CROSS-COUNTRY COMPARISONS OF PHARMACEUTICAL PRICE LEVELS<lb/></figure>

			<p>240.<lb/> One of the most critical issues of price comparison studies is that they often present bilateral<lb/> comparisons between a reference country (A) and other countries (B, C, etc.). This means practically that<lb/> the basket of pharmaceuticals used in the comparison between country A and country B is not the same<lb/> basket of goods used to compare prices in A and C, and it implies that direct comparisons between price<lb/> indexes for B and C are not valid. Therefore, studies presenting bilateral comparisons with Canada as the<lb/> country of reference and studies presenting multilateral comparisons (the basket of selected<lb/> pharmaceuticals is the same in all countries) are the focus of this review (see <ref type="table">Table 4</ref>			<figure>). Studies presenting<lb/> bilateral comparisons with the United States as the reference country were also reviewed.<lb/> 241.<lb/> A study by Danzon &amp; Furukawa (2003) compares US prices of 249 molecules among the US top<lb/> 300 in 1999 to prices in eight countries, including Canada. The basket of pharmaceuticals contains both<lb/> generic and patented drug, matched by molecule and indication 85 (ATC class) and represents 56% of the<lb/> Canadian market. The authors use IMS data to compare manufacturers&apos; prices, with price discounts<lb/> furnished to big purchasers in the United States estimated at 8%. Price indexes were calculated using US<lb/> volumes of sales as weights. Canadian prices appear to be 33% lower than US prices. Prices of originator<lb/> products are 35% lower than in the United States while prices of generics are only 6% lower.<lb/> 242.<lb/> A study published in 2004 by the US Department of Commerce (ITA, 2004) compares the prices<lb/> of patented products in the United States with prices in ten OECD countries (bilateral comparisons) in<lb/> 2003. The sample is composed of the US top 54 patented prescription products containing a single<lb/> molecule, further extended to all products containing this molecule (on-or off-patent). It represents 26% of<lb/> drug sales across OECD countries, but the share of the market covered in Canada is not known. Fisher<lb/> Indexes have been calculated based on ex-manufacturer price per standard unit. Canadian prices appear to<lb/> be 46% below US prices. As US discounts have been ignored, the price differential between Canada and<lb/> the United States is overestimated.<lb/> 243.<lb/> Annual reports from the PMPRB (see 2005 report) present bilateral comparisons of Canadian ex-<lb/>factory prices of patented drugs with prices in the seven countries referred to in the regulation defining<lb/> excessive prices (France, Germany, Italy, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the United<lb/> States). Bilateral comparisons are based on patented products available in Canada and in the comparator<lb/> country. The average foreign-to-Canadian price ratio for each product is computed, weighted by sales in<lb/> Canada. Prices are converted by current exchange rates. 86 In the 2005 report, prices of patented drugs are<lb/> 85<lb/> The paper presents also a price comparison when products are matched by molecule and form-strength. In<lb/> this case, only 35% of the Canadian market is covered, which shows how different are presentations in<lb/> these two markets. Price differentials between the two countries are less important, by 2 to 3%, when<lb/> &quot; identical &quot; products are compared.<lb/></figure>

			<p>86<lb/> PMPRB uses a fully-lagged 36-month moving average of spot exchange rates for this purpose. This means<lb/> that long-term exchange-rate movements will be fully reflected in PMPRB&apos;s average price ratios only 36<lb/> months after they occur, while a short-term fluctuation will influence the ratios up to 36 months after it has<lb/> been reversed.<lb/></p>

			<head>44% lower in Canada than in the United States 87 . Prices in the United Kingdom and Switzerland are 13 to<lb/> 16% higher than in Canada; Swedish and German prices are very close to Canadian prices; and France and<lb/></head>

			<p>Italy have lower prices than Canada (respectively 10% and 17%). It is important to note that these price<lb/> comparisons are based on &quot; publicly available ex-factory prices &quot; obtained by manufacturers in foreign<lb/> countries and provided to PMPRB for the review of excessive price (PMPRB, 2002). This means that<lb/> further confidential discounts or rebates consented by the manufacturers are not taken into account, which<lb/> could lead to under-or over-estimates of differentials between Canadian and foreign prices.<lb/> 244.<lb/> Although the price-regulation mandate of the PMPRB is limited to patented drugs, the Board has<lb/> published international price comparisons for non-patented medicines. The first report (2003) analyses the<lb/> ex-factory prices of non-patented single-source 88 drugs in Canada and the seven &quot; official comparator<lb/> countries &quot; for fiscal year 1998/1999 (see Box 9). These products represent only a small part of provincial<lb/> expenditures (13%). The study conducted on these products revealed that Canadian prices 89 were 22%<lb/> higher than international median prices and 55% above median European prices (PMPRB, 2003a, p.24 &amp;<lb/> p. 25). In bilateral comparisons, Canadian prices were higher than prices in any European country (from<lb/> 100% above Italy&apos;s prices to 15% above German prices). When comparisons focus on brand-name<lb/> products only in all countries (i.e. exclude generics which are available in comparator countries), Canadian<lb/> prices are 21% above the median international price and 54% above median European prices.<lb/> 245.<lb/> Multiple-source drugs are produced by several manufacturers; they may be originator brand-<lb/>name drugs or generic equivalents. PMPRB studied the prices of these drugs in 2000. International<lb/> comparisons were conducted on 496 products (for 64 molecules) representing 40% of the generic market in<lb/> six provinces. They showed that in Canada generics were priced 35% below originator products on<lb/> average, the gap increasing with time after generic entry. This difference was slightly greater than in most<lb/> comparator countries, except Germany (where the difference between originator and generic price is 41%),<lb/> New Zealand (47%) and the United Kingdom (42%). In bilateral comparisons, multiple-source product<lb/> prices are higher in Canada than in most comparator countries, except the United Kingdom (where prices<lb/> are 12% higher), Switzerland (30% higher), and the United States (where prices are 259% higher when the<lb/> Red Book was considered but 50% below Canadian prices when prices from the Federal Supply Schedule<lb/> are used). Overall brand-name multiple-source products are priced 12 to 13% above median international<lb/> prices (depending on prices considered in the US) and generic drugs are priced 14 to 32% 90 above median<lb/> international price.<lb/> 87<lb/> To estimate the US-to-Canadian price ratio, the PMPRB uses an average of publicly available prices<lb/> supplied by the patentee and of prices from the Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) published by the Veterans<lb/> Administration. The FSS seldom has more that a 50% weight in the average, and often has a much smaller<lb/> weight (personal communication with PMPRB).<lb/> 88<lb/> Single-source drugs are those sold by only one manufacturer. Single-source products have been identified<lb/> in the Ontario Drug Benefit formulary. These products may be sold by several manufacturers in other<lb/> jurisdictions of Canada and in other countries. Non-patented products include products which have never<lb/> been patented as well as products whose patent has expired.<lb/> 89<lb/> The Canadian price is approximated by the Ontario Drug Benefit Formulary price, justified by the fact that<lb/> there are few inter-provincial variations in prices.<lb/></p>

			<head>90<lb/></head>

			<p>With other assumptions, brand-name multiple-source products appear to be priced up to 45 to 46% above<lb/> median international price and generic drugs 43 to 62% above median international price.<lb/></p>

			<head>Box 9. Methods used in PMPRB price comparisons<lb/></head>

			<p>PMPRB studies of single and multiple-source non-patented products (2003) present multiple variants to test sensitivity<lb/> to different assumptions and/or samples. For instance, three methods are used to consider US prices: the use of the<lb/> Federal Supply Schedule only, the use of the Red Book only or the use of both sources. Two different samples of<lb/> products are considered: a set of drugs which are available in at least one comparator country and a set of drugs<lb/> which are available at least in three countries. Finally, the average Canadian price to median international price ratio is<lb/> computed as a geometric mean, according to three weighting methods: unweighted, weighted by &quot; Canadian &quot;<lb/> expenditures and weighted by &quot; Canadian &quot; utilisation. Indeed, expenditures and utilisation in the Ontario Drug Benefit<lb/> were used as a proxy of Canadian expenditures and utilisation and ODB formulary prices were used as a proxy for<lb/> Canadian prices.<lb/> In PMPRB studies, different package sizes of equivalent molecule-form-strength in a country are dealt with by using<lb/> the median unit price of these packages (and not the average). Ex-manufacturer prices are considered.<lb/></p>

			<p>The impact of methods and sample on results is very important. For instance, for single-source non-patented products,<lb/> Canadian prices are assessed to be 5% to 44% higher than the median international price, depending on assumptions.<lb/> The first result is computed as the unweighted average Canadian price to median international price ratio for the<lb/> largest sample of products (56) and using the Red Book for US prices, and the second one is the expenditures-<lb/>weighted average for the smaller sample of products (39) and using both FSS and Red Book for US prices.<lb/></p>

			<p>Results presented in this annex are for the utilisation-weighted average Canadian price to median international price<lb/> computed with the sample of products available at least in three countries, using both FSS and Red Book.<lb/></p>

			<head>246.<lb/> Comparisons with prices in the United States</head>

			<figure>have been given particular attention in recent years,<lb/> partly because of the growth in cross-border trade. In 2001, Palmer D&apos;Angelo Consulting International<lb/> (2002) compared the prices of 27 top-selling generic drugs representing 39% of generic drug sales in<lb/> Canada. The study used the Federal Supply Schedule for the US price and the Québec government<lb/> formulary for the Canadian price to define the ex-manufacturer price of the &apos;most representative<lb/> presentation in Canada&apos; (strength and dosage form) of each product.</figure>

			<p>The conclusion was that Canadian<lb/> prices for generics were above US FSS prices, whatever the methodology used (mean, median, weighted or<lb/> not), by 37 to 100%. However, the use of the Federal Supply Schedule can be considered as an important<lb/> caveat, since it certainly underestimates US prices.<lb/></p>

			<head>247.<lb/> In 2005, Skinner compared the 2003 retail prices of prescription drugs in Canada and in the<lb/></head>

			<p>United States, from a sample of 100 brand-name drugs and 100 generics (Canada&apos;s 100 top-selling drugs in<lb/> volumes). Retail prices in Canada were computed using the IMS CompuScript database which provides<lb/> both volume of sales and corresponding sales at retail prices, while retail prices in the United States were<lb/> estimated by the author using several publicly available sources. Generic prices appear to be 78% higher<lb/> than US ones, while branded products (patented or not) were 43% lower (<ref type="biblio">Skinner, 2005</ref>).<lb/> 248.<lb/> Another study compares United States and Canadian generic retail prices for the 1999-2005<lb/> period (D&apos;<ref type="biblio">Cruz et al. 2005</ref>). The sample covers all presentations (strength, form and package size) which<lb/> are available in both countries, which probably leads to an overestimate of US prices by excluding large<lb/> package sizes with lower unit costs. This sample represents an increasing share of the Canadian market<lb/> (from 39% in 1999 to 56% in 2005). Prices in both countries were evaluated using IMS data, at ex-<lb/>manufacturer level. Purchasing power parities were used to convert US prices to Canadian dollars. A ratio<lb/> for Canadian-to-US prices was computed for each product and then averaged, using Canada&apos;s market<lb/> shares as weights. According to this study, US generic prices used to be higher than Canadian generic<lb/> prices in <ref type="biblio">1999-2000, were slightly lower in 2001-2002 and were equivalent in 2004-2005.<lb/></ref> 249.<lb/> In 2006, the PMPRB produced a report on prices of non-patented prescription drugs (PMPRB,<lb/> 2006c). Using IMS data, the PMPRB compared ex-factory prices of generics and other non-patented drugs<lb/> using &quot; average foreign-to-Canadian prices ratios &quot; (arithmetic mean). In bilateral comparisons, generic<lb/> prices were found to be systematically lower in foreign countries 91 than in Canada. On a bilateral<lb/> comparison, Canada&apos;s prices for generics exceeded those in each of the 11 comparison countries. Canadian<lb/> prices for non-patented drugs also exceeded those in all comparator countries except Switzerland and the<lb/> United States (See <ref type="figure">Figure 12</ref>).<lb/></p>
