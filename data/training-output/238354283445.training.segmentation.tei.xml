			<body>August 2008 <lb/>Policy Insights <lb/>Policy Insights <lb/>OECD DEVELOPMENT CENTRE <lb/>www.oecd.org/dev/insights <lb/>The idea of local &quot; ownership &quot; of development policies is now popular among the donor community, but without <lb/>a reduction of conditionality on aid disbursements, enhanced ownership will be difficult to achieve. <lb/>While there are still strong reasons for attaching certain kinds of conditionality to aid, policy conditionality has <lb/>been shown to be largely ineffective and often counterproductive. <lb/>Donors insisting on policy conditions may in any case soon find themselves sidelined, as developing countries <lb/>find alternative official and private sources of finance with fewer strings attached. <lb/>♦ <lb/>♦ <lb/>♦ <lb/>A Farewell to Policy Conditionality? <lb/>by Andrew Mold and Felix Zimmermann, OECD Development Centre <lb/>The official languages of next month&apos;s Accra High-Level <lb/>Forum on Aid Effectiveness are French, English and <lb/>Spanish. However, participants in discussions will also need <lb/>to master the new aid lexicon, which includes concepts <lb/>like &quot; ownership &quot; and &quot; harmonisation &quot; and is embodied in <lb/>the 2005 Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness. <lb/>Fortunately, these words represent more than a shift in <lb/>semantics. They stand for a sincere reappraisal by donors <lb/>and aid recipients of the way aid should be delivered if it is <lb/>to become more effective in reducing poverty. &quot; Ownership &quot; <lb/>implies that aid recipients need greater space to choose <lb/>their own development policies. &quot; Harmonisation &quot; means <lb/>that donors should coordinate their aid better to reduce <lb/>costs and needless duplication. <lb/>There is one older concept, however, whose place in the <lb/>new aid lexicon remains controversial: &quot; conditionality &quot; . The <lb/>donor community now prefers to use the term &quot; ownership &quot; , <lb/> &quot; ownership &quot; , ownership &quot; , &quot; , , <lb/>but arguably they are different sides of the same coin, <lb/>for without a reduction of conditionality, ownership is <lb/>impossible. In practice, donors still feel they need to tie <lb/>their aid to conditions to ensure it is well spent. And, <lb/>understandably, recipients would prefer their aid without <lb/>strings attached. <lb/>It is not surprising, then, that the Paris Declaration&apos;s take on <lb/>conditionality is ambiguous. Paragraph 16 commits donors <lb/>to base conditions on recipient-country priorities &quot; wherever <lb/>possible &quot; . It allows exceptions with &quot; sound justification &quot; . <lb/>And it calls on donors and recipient countries to develop a <lb/> &quot; manageable &quot; set of indicators to which aid might be tied. <lb/>A non-committal paragraph to say the least! <lb/>The problem with such ambiguity is that the imposition <lb/>of conditions runs counter to ownership, a principle of aid <lb/>effectiveness which emerged following the recognition that <lb/>past attempts to impose policies from the outside had not <lb/>proven effective. Most aid experts are now unanimous <lb/>about the failure of structural adjustment programmes, <lb/>through which donors attempted to coax developing <lb/>countries into economic reforms throughout the 1980s <lb/>and 1990s. <lb/>The failure of policy conditions to bring about meaningful <lb/>reform has a number of reasons: <lb/>For a start, donors have not been consistent in applying <lb/>conditions: whilst measures are imposed forcefully in some <lb/>countries, generous aid disbursements have continued <lb/>in countries that ignored conditions. This lack of even-<lb/>handedness in applying conditions may well relate to <lb/>the underlying political dimensions of aid, often ignored <lb/>during formal negotiations of aid agreements. Bilateral <lb/>aid agencies often see their relationships with recipient-<lb/>country administrations undermined by their counterparts <lb/>in ministries of trade or foreign affairs 1 . Aid agencies quickly <lb/>suffer from a credibility gap that undermines the very <lb/>rationale for conditions. <lb/>A further problem with policy conditions, even when they <lb/>are applied consistently, is that they inevitably undermine <lb/>local accountability structures. Some donors believe that <lb/>conditions can help governments lock in urgent reforms <lb/>. See, for instance, the examples pointed out in Carol Lancaster <lb/>(2007), &quot; Foreign Aid – Diplomacy, Development, Domestic Politics &quot; , <lb/>The University of Chicago Press, Chicago. <lb/>No. 74 <lb/>Policy Insights No. 74 © OECD 2008 <lb/>The opinions expressed in this paper are those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect those of the OECD, <lb/>the Development Centre or their member countries. <lb/>Policy Insights No. 74, © OECD 2008 <lb/>OECD Development Centre <lb/>2, rue André-Pascal, <lb/>75775 Paris Cedex 16, France <lb/>Tel.: +33-(0) 45.24.82.00 <lb/>Fax: +33-(0) 44 30 6 49 <lb/>E-mail: dev.contact@oecd.org <lb/>Readers are encouraged to quote or reproduce material from OECD <lb/>Development Centre Policy Insights for their own publications.

Full text of Policy Insights and more information on the <lb/>Centre and its work are available on its web site: www.oecd.org/dev <lb/>without broad local support. Conditions thus become <lb/>scapegoats for governments seeking to avoid national <lb/>debate about unpopular policy measures. Governments <lb/>become accountable to donors rather than citizens. <lb/>Finally, there are legitimate doubts about the extent <lb/>to which donors can know which development policies <lb/>may be the right ones. They have often been criticised <lb/>for ignoring local contexts when negotiating policy <lb/>priorities. Most economists would now recognise that <lb/>the laundry-list approach to economic policy, epitomized <lb/>by the &quot; Washington Consensus &quot; , was inappropriate in <lb/>many circumstances, and that the proper sequencing of <lb/>reform is crucial to its success. Dani Rodrik calls for a <lb/>more pragmatic approach to economic policy, adapting <lb/>to local circumstances and considering the returns on <lb/>different policy options 2 . The resulting choices may not <lb/>always coincide in what economists consider to be the <lb/> &quot; first-best &quot; policy choice. But this is surely the right way <lb/>to ensure successful reform. <lb/>Moving away from policy conditionality, of course, does not <lb/>mean giving developing countries &quot; carte blanche &quot; . Donors <lb/>are right to insist on transparency and good fiduciary <lb/>practices to guard against the embezzlement of aid monies. <lb/>2. Dani Rodrik (2007), &quot; One Economics Many Recipes – Globalization, <lb/>Institutions and Economic Growth &quot; , Princeton University Press, <lb/>Princeton, NJ. <lb/>Similarly, they should expect aid recipient countries to <lb/>adhere to international human rights standards. Finally, <lb/>they are entitled to a degree of quality assurance: <lb/>without development results to show for their aid, <lb/>OECD-based taxpayers will withdraw their support for <lb/>aid programmes. <lb/>This is why some donors have begun linking aid <lb/>disbursements to the achievement of agreed results, <lb/>leaving the choice of policies with recipient countries. <lb/>As yet, such performance-based conditions are untested <lb/>and bear risks: natural disasters or economic crises can <lb/>put performance beyond a country&apos;s control. But these <lb/>risks could be factored into aid contracts with safeguard <lb/>clauses. <lb/>In any case, donors insisting on policy conditions may soon <lb/>find themselves sidelined – many developing countries <lb/>are finding alternative official and private sources of <lb/>finance that come with fewer strings attached. If they <lb/>are serious about development, they will use this freedom <lb/>from conditions to design effective, innovative and home-<lb/>grown policies for development. Let us hope that this is <lb/>indeed the case. <lb/>www.oecd.org/dev/insights <lb/>Policy Insights No. 74, August 2008 </body>
