            <figDesc>Focus on connectivity and trade costs to provide an operational focal point for an action-oriented<lb/> agenda among a broad collation of stakeholders, including the providers of South-South co-operation and<lb/> the private sector. The advantages of such targets are also that they are neutral in the sense of benefiting<lb/> not just exporters, but also importers and households.<lb/> Expand the scope to sustainable investment. The initial emphasis should be on trade in services,<lb/> with a focus on those sectors that are central to promoting sustainable development, such as agriculture,<lb/> energy and transport. Donor support in this area could tackle a range of issues such as transparency.</figDesc>

            <figDesc>Play a catalytic role in supporting the SDGs. The SDGs highlight that &quot; (…) increasing aid-for-trade<lb/> support for developing countries, in particular the least developed (…) &quot; would help to &quot; (…) promote<lb/> sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work<lb/> for all. &quot;<lb/> The Initiative should focus on the fundamental changes that are taking place in the trade<lb/> and development landscape. In response to the changing nature of the world economy and its rising<lb/> complexity, new analytical approaches are needed to better understand the trade-offs and<lb/> complementarities between policy objectives – e.g. between growth promoting policies and equity and<lb/> environmental concerns. Addressing these concerns and dealing with these interlinkages requires<lb/> integrated approaches that breakdown silos between policy communities. The Aid for Trade Initiative<lb/> should be an integral part of this new approach to policy which is essential if we want to deliver the<lb/> Sustainable Development Goals by 2030. The Tenth WTO Ministerial Conference in Kenya in<lb/> December 2015 offers an opportune moment to take stock of the achievements of the Aid for Trade<lb/> Initiative and reflect on how to continue its relevance in the changing trade and development<lb/> landscape.</figDesc>

            <figDesc>Central to the whole Aid for Trade Initiative is the notion that trade should be (better) mainstreamed<lb/> as a priority in the strategies of developing countries and donor agencies. Most donor agencies have<lb/> reported that they have specific aid for trade strategies. Some donors such as European Commission<lb/> Germany and the United Kingdom are in the process of updating their strategies. UNDP (2011) and<lb/> Brenton et al (2014) find that while progress has been observed in mainstreaming trade in developing<lb/> countries, capacities remain uneven. The high number of countries that have actively participated in<lb/> successive monitoring exercises that underpin the biennial Global Reviews of Aid for Trade, as well as a<lb/> recent review of the Diagnostic Trade Integration Studies undertaken by the Executive Secretariat of the<lb/> Enhanced Integrated Framework suggest that progress in this area continues. 2</figDesc>

Thus, involving the private sector<lb/> in donor programmes should not reintroduce the bad practice of tying aid to donor companies. The OECD<lb/> Arrangement on Officially Supported Export Credits offers an extensive framework for the orderly use of<lb/> officially supported export credits, while the 2001 DAC Recommendation unties ODA to the LDCs and<lb/> HPICs. 7 The WTO Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures contains binding disciplines for<lb/> the use of subsidies. 8</figDesc>
