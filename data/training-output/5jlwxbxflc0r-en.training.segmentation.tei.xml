It reviews the shift in ELM policy at the EU level by examining <lb/>documents and debates. It looks at the treatment of ELM, setting out from the Amsterdam Treaty and then <lb/>follows the development up to the present, paying close attention to the evolving rational for increasing <lb/>ELM. The difference between the horizontal approach and the sectoral approach is explained. The major <lb/>ELM Directives under the sectoral approach are presented and discussed in terms of how they were <lb/>negotiated and how they fit into the overall ELM policy strategy. The document concludes by identifying <lb/>current political challenges for expanding the EU approach beyond its present form. <lb/></body>

			<body>THE EUROPEAN UNION&apos;S EXTERNAL LABOUR MIGRATION POLICY; RATIONALE, <lb/>OBJECTIVES, APPROACHES AND RESULTS, 1999-2014 <lb/>The Background <lb/>1. <lb/>The EU&apos;s declared need for third country labour migrants is not just any type of need. According <lb/>to most estimates put forward by the EU (but also by the UN and other organizations) the figures range in <lb/>the tens of millions for the coming five decades. In its 2005 &apos;Policy Plan on Legal Migration&apos;, the <lb/>European Commission (2005a: 4) warns that unless the EU manages to increase labour immigration the <lb/>EU&apos;s working age population is expected to contract by some 52 million by 2050. Furthermore, as is <lb/>underscored in the Commission&apos;s &apos;2012 Ageing Report&apos;, looking only to 2020, the EU would need a net <lb/>migration of 25 million in order to keep the working-age population stable at current level. This means that <lb/>the Union would have to net an additional 11 million migrants to the already projected 14 million (EC <lb/>[European Commission] 2012a: 51–6). This provided, economic growth and migration growth have <lb/>become two sides of the same coin in the EU&apos;s economic and political ambitions. This was made clear <lb/>already in the Lisbon Strategy (2000-2010) and now constitutes one of the cornerstones of &apos;Europe 2020&apos;, <lb/>the EU&apos;s current ten-year plan for growth (EC 2010a: 18; EC 2011a: 4). From the perspective of the <lb/>Commission, a large-scale increase in labour migration has become so urgent that the then Home Affairs <lb/>Commissioner referred to it as a matter of &apos;our economic survival&apos; (Malmström 2010). <lb/>2. <lb/>The ways in which the EU goes about this urgent undertaking is the topic of this paper. It focuses <lb/>on the Commission&apos;s current approach to external labour migration (ELM), its overarching rationale, core <lb/>objectives and the practical ways and means by which Brussels seeks to build common EU policy in the <lb/>area, often against the wishes of intransigent governments in the Council. Consequently, a substantial part <lb/>of this paper will be devoted to the EU directives relating to ELM that have been adopted so far, <lb/>accounting for their content as well as analysing how they correspond to the Commission&apos;s objectives. <lb/></body>

			<body>3. <lb/>Before saying anything further about the more contemporary developments, however, it is <lb/>important to take note of the relatively recent nature of the Commission&apos;s current position as a strong <lb/>advocate of ELM, which thus differs from the quite consistent and continuous policy approach that the <lb/>Commission, since at least the early 1980s, has taken to the three other major areas of migration policy, i.e. <lb/>asylum, border security/&apos;illegal migration&apos; and free movement for EU citizens. From the early 1970s to the <lb/>late 1990s, and in sharp contrast to today, the Commission instead championed an official line of policy <lb/>that advised against labour migration to the EU from non-OECD countries. In its &apos;comprehensive <lb/>approach&apos; to migration, presented in 1994 (and originally drafted in 1991), the Commission advocated a <lb/>three-pronged strategy, calling for: (1) &apos;Taking action on migration pressure&apos;; (2) &apos;Controlling migration <lb/>flows&apos;; and (3) &apos;Strengthening integration policies for the benefit of legal immigrants&apos; (EC 1994: 11). <lb/>4. <lb/>Deemed the only &apos;realistic&apos; option at the time, this (what is now referred to as) &apos;zero migration&apos; <lb/>policy also served as an important public relations tool from the mid-1980s and onwards, promising EU <lb/>citizens that the transformations brought about by the Single Market would not lead to an increase in <lb/>external migration (Hansen &amp; Hager 2012). In an information booklet from 1996, for instance, addressing <lb/>the &apos;European citizen&apos;, Brussels took care to note that many &apos;are concerned about immigration […], <lb/>thinking that this could increase once internal border controls have been fully swept away&apos;. The question <lb/>that many EU citizens were asking, according to the Commission, could thus be phrased as follows: &apos;Will <lb/>the eventual dismantling of all internal borders lead to an increase in levels of immigration to my country, <lb/>both from inside and outside the Community?&apos; To this the Commission could give a reassuring answer: <lb/>&apos;No, it should not. The fundamental point about dismantling the Community&apos;s internal borders is that this <lb/>process must be accompanied by the synchronized tightening of all external borders&apos; (EC 1996: 13–15). <lb/>5. <lb/>By the turn of the millennium this, by now, habitual policy picture was to be significantly <lb/>revised. To be sure, the revision did not affect the pursuit of border security, which would continue <lb/>unabated. But it did involve a remarkable reversal of the EU&apos;s stance on ELM. All of a sudden, Brussels <lb/>would start issuing statements such as the following: &apos;The Commission considers that the zero immigration <lb/>mentioned in past Community discussion of immigration was never realistic and never really justified&apos;; <lb/>and &apos;it is clear from an analysis of the economic and demographic context of the Union and of the <lb/>countries of origin, that there is a growing recognition that the &quot; zero &quot; immigration policies of the past <lb/>30 years <lb/>are <lb/>no <lb/>longer <lb/>appropriate&apos; <lb/>(EC 1999: <lb/>2; <lb/>2000: <lb/>3). <lb/></body>

			<body>The Role of Amsterdam and Tampere <lb/>6. <lb/>This policy shift on ELM formed part of the larger conversion of EU migration policy brought <lb/>about by the Amsterdam Treaty in 1997 (ratified in 1999) 1 and the Tampere European Council in 1999, the <lb/>latter marking the first European Council ever devoted to Justice and Home Affairs (and thus to migration <lb/>issues). 2 <lb/>7. <lb/>Amsterdam&apos;s treaty changes and the bold objectives contained in the multiannual <lb/>Tampere Programme (1999–2004, resulting from the Tampere European Council) expanded the scope for <lb/>EU harmonization and supranational provisions with regard to migration policy. Ever since, as seen in the <lb/>number of directives and other legislation and policy initiatives, this scope has been consistently expanded <lb/>through Tampere&apos;s successor multi-annual programmes, i.e. the Hague (2004–2009) and Stockholm <lb/>Programmes (2009–2014), the European Pact on immigration and asylum, 3 and, most crucially, through <lb/>1 <lb/>The Amsterdam Treaty marked a historical shift toward a significantly augmented role for the EU and the <lb/>supranational level in migration policy. With the overarching aim of developing the European Union as an <lb/>&apos;area of freedom, security and justice&apos;, Amsterdam laid down the broad outlines for a future EU policy on <lb/>migration and asylum. Upon ratification, the groundwork for such a policy was to be built incrementally <lb/>over a period of five years (1999–2004). Some of these changes were spelled out in Article 61 under <lb/>Amsterdam&apos;s new Title IV (&apos;Visas, asylum, immigration and other policies related to free movement of <lb/>persons&apos;, Articles 61–69): <lb/>In order to establish progressively an area of freedom, security and justice, the Council shall adopt: (a) <lb/>within a period of five years after the entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam, measures aimed at <lb/>ensuring the free movement of persons […] in conjunction with directly related flanking measures with <lb/>respect to external border controls, asylum and immigration […] (b) other measures in the fields of <lb/>asylum, immigration and safeguarding the rights of nationals of third countries. <lb/>Further, Article 62 specified that measures should be adopted granting certain limited intra-EU mobility <lb/>rights to &apos;nationals of third countries&apos;. In addition, Article 63 outlined a series of measures on asylum and <lb/>immigration, calling for the adoption (within a period of five years) of a set &apos;minimum standards&apos; in the <lb/>area of asylum as well as &apos;measures on immigration policy within the following areas: (a) conditions of <lb/>entry and residence, and standards on procedures for the issue by Member States of long term visas and <lb/>residence permits, including those for the purpose of family reunion, (b) illegal immigration and illegal <lb/>residence, including repatriation of illegal residents&apos;; and &apos;measures defining the rights and conditions <lb/>under which nationals of third countries who are legally resident in a Member State may reside in other <lb/>Member States.&apos; As part of this reshuffling, Amsterdam also incorporated the Schengen acquis into the <lb/>treaty framework. As seen, and unlike its predecessor, Amsterdam did not confine itself to immigration and <lb/>asylum proper, but also introduced into the treaty explicit wordings concerning the Union&apos;s resident third-<lb/>country nationals (TCNs). Moreover, the treaty enacted an article to better equip the Union in its fight <lb/>against racism and other forms of discrimination. Owing to British, Irish, and Danish opposition, and in <lb/>order not to derail the negotiations, it became necessary to allow these countries to opt out of these new <lb/>provisions. Such opt-out, but also opt-in, agreements had to be codified in a series of complex protocols <lb/>(see Hailbronner 1998; Hedemann-Robinson 1999). <lb/>2 <lb/>At the Tampere European Council in 1999, under the heading &apos;A Common EU Asylum and Migration <lb/>Policy&apos;, the Council decided that &apos;a common European asylum system&apos; gradually should be put into <lb/>operation. Tampere also established that a major focus of the EU&apos;s efforts should be on the &apos;more efficient <lb/>management of migration flows at all their stages&apos;, on more effective external border controls and on <lb/>combating illegal immigration. In addition, Tampere declared that &apos;a more vigorous integration policy <lb/>should aim at granting&apos; third-country nationals &apos;rights and obligations comparable to those of EU citizens&apos; <lb/>(European Council 1999). <lb/></body>

			<body>the Lisbon Treaty (ratified in 2009), the latter making the Community method of decision and law making <lb/>applicable also to ELM. 4 As the Treaty&apos;s Title I on &apos;Common Provisions&apos; (Art. 3) stipulates: <lb/>The Union shall offer its citizens an area of freedom, security and justice without internal frontiers, in <lb/>which the free movement of persons is ensured in conjunction with appropriate measures with respect <lb/>to external border controls, asylum, immigration and the prevention and combating of crime. <lb/>8. <lb/>In the new Title V, Chapter 2, moreover, the Lisbon Treaty widens Amsterdam&apos;s rather limited <lb/>latitude for immigration policy (as distinct from policies on asylum and illegal immigration) by explicating, <lb/>in Article 79, that &apos;The Union shall develop a common immigration policy&apos; and that this should aim at <lb/>&apos;ensuring, at all stages, the efficient management of migration flows, fair treatment of third-country <lb/>nationals residing legally in Member States, and the prevention of, and enhanced measures to combat, <lb/>illegal immigration and trafficking in human beings&apos;. While the terms &apos;labour immigration&apos; or &apos;legal <lb/>immigration&apos; are not explicitly spelled out in the Treaty, the references to &apos;common immigration policy&apos; <lb/>&apos;management of migration flows&apos; and &apos;fair treatment of third-country nationals residing legally in Member <lb/>States&apos; are nonetheless proof of ELM&apos;s conditional recognition as a common policy area. Such recognition <lb/>is also provided by way of emphasizing conditionality, such as in Article 79 and its stipulation: &apos;This <lb/>Article shall not affect the right of Member States to determine volumes of admission of third-country <lb/>nationals coming from third countries to their territory in order to seek work, whether employed or self-<lb/>employed.&apos; In emphasizing the conditionality of a &apos;common immigration policy&apos; the Treaty is also <lb/>acknowledging that such a policy does, in fact, include ELM, which is contained in the formulation &apos;in <lb/>order to seek work&apos;. <lb/>9. <lb/>However, looking at the policy development over the past fifteen years since Amsterdam and <lb/>Tampere, the achievements with regard to ELM have been both meagre and fragmented. As such, ELM <lb/>has clearly taken a backseat to the far more prioritized and interrelated areas of &apos;illegal migration&apos;, border <lb/>security, asylum, visa, return and readmission. 5 <lb/>4 <lb/>The Community method refers foremost to qualified majority voting in the Council and EP co-decision <lb/>powers. The Lisbon Treaty also expanded the Court of Justice&apos;s say in EU immigration law by, inter alia, <lb/>giving the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights binding legal status as well as providing for the accession of <lb/>the EU to the European Convention of Human Rights (see e.g. Douglas-Scott 2011). <lb/>5 <lb/>It needs mention here that the EU also has sought to gain influence in the area of migrant integration <lb/>policy, based, initially, on the Amsterdam Treaty&apos;s implicit authorization; on Tampere&apos;s declaration &apos;that a <lb/>more vigorous integration policy should aim at granting&apos; TCNs &apos;rights and obligations comparable to those <lb/>of EU citizens&apos; (EC 2001a: 2); the Hague and Stockholm Programmes&apos; as well as Europe 2020&apos;s further <lb/>affirmations; and, finally, the Lisbon Treaty&apos;s (first ever) explicit mention of migrant integration as having <lb/>a legal basis (albeit a very weak one). As stated in Lisbon&apos;s Article 79. 4: &apos;The European Parliament and <lb/>the Council, acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure, may establish measures to <lb/>provide incentives and support for the action of Member States with a view to promoting the integration of <lb/>third-country nationals residing legally in their territories, excluding any harmonisation of the laws and <lb/>regulations of the Member States.&apos; Apart from non-binding declarations, the adoption of integration <lb/>principles and agreement on the Commission&apos;s role in monitoring and assisting the member states in <lb/>integration matters (e.g. the &apos;Common basic principles for immigrant integration policy in the European <lb/>Union&apos; [see Council EU 2004a; 2004b: 19–20; EC 2005c], and the subsequent &apos;European Agenda for the <lb/>Integration of Third-Country Nationals&apos; [EC 2011d]), this policy has not gone beyond supranational <lb/>measures relating to various types of mobility for resident TCNs within the Union. However, since such <lb/>integration measures, when being the subject of concrete legislative measures – as seen in several of the <lb/>directives dealt with in this paper – primarily are framed in terms of labour mobility and less as integration, <lb/>this paper will group such measures as forming part of EU labour migration and mobility policy rather than <lb/>EU migrant integration policy. <lb/></body>

			<body>The caption of Chapter 2 under Lisbon&apos;s Title V, which reads &apos;Policies on border checks, asylum and <lb/>immigration&apos;, thus serves as an accurate description of the ranking of policy preference within the Council. <lb/>The Commission&apos;s Rationale and Objectives for Increasing ELM <lb/>10. <lb/>In this context meagre results of course relate to the Commission&apos;s objectives. But what are these <lb/>more precisely, and how should we construe them in more analytical terms? <lb/>11. <lb/>As already seen, medium and long-term demographic projections constitute the foundation for <lb/>the Commission&apos;s outlook. They have been used consistently throughout as justification of Brussels&apos; <lb/>stance and to drive home the point that ELM is above all structurally determined and, as such, should not <lb/>be allowed to be compromised by immediate business cycle and unemployment concerns, but rather needs <lb/>to be seen as an increasingly urgent necessity in order to sustain growth, competitiveness and social <lb/>welfare in the EU. Instead of the member states going it alone, devising between themselves inconsistent <lb/>responses (or few responses at all) at odds with the overall functioning of EU, the Commission approaches <lb/>these demographically induced migration challenges as calling for common, coordinated and increasingly <lb/>harmonized policies. <lb/>12. <lb/>From the demographic projections, giving at hand a rapidly aging Union, the Commission then <lb/>derives in more detail the short, medium and the long-term labour demand with regard to skills required, <lb/>sectoral assessments and overall structural changes in the labour market. Important to keep in mind is that <lb/>the Commission does not foresee ELM as the sole solution to the demographic deficit. However, what is <lb/>interesting is that the Commission is leaning more and more in this direction. For some time, as reflected in <lb/>the Commission&apos;s (2005a: 5) &apos;Policy Plan on Legal Migration&apos; from 2005, the official view was that <lb/>&apos;Immigration does not provide in itself a long-term solution to falling birth rates and an ageing population, <lb/>but it is one of the available tools within a broader policy mix.&apos; Since then, however, and as seen in <lb/>numerous statements and documents, not least in the Commission&apos;s earlier cited &apos;2012 Ageing Report&apos;, <lb/>ELM is more and more deemed as, if not the only remedy, certainly the most important one, equipped with <lb/>fairly detailed estimates of the required volumes of migrants and the serious consequences from failure to <lb/>act in accordance. <lb/>13. <lb/>This tendency is reflected too in Brussels&apos; increasingly alarmist and frustrated calls for member <lb/>state cooperation on ELM, or as put by the then Home Affairs Commissioner Cecilia Malmström: &apos;When I <lb/>meet ministers responsible for labour policies, they almost all speak of the need for immigrant workers— <lb/>and it&apos;s true, we need hundreds of thousands, millions in the long term. But when the ministers go and <lb/>speak in front of their national publics, this message is not to be heard at all.&apos; (quoted in Barber 2011) <lb/>14. <lb/>Besides expanding ELM as such, the Commission also aims to increase the admission of <lb/>students, researchers and other categories of TCNs more indirectly related to the labour market; this in <lb/>order to cope with a severe shortage of researchers, in particular, and to facilitate these groups&apos; future <lb/>labour market participation and contributions to innovation and entrepreneurship, in general. <lb/>15. <lb/>Integral to the goal of increasing ELM is also the goal of increasing the internal mobility of third <lb/>country labour in the EU. This requires that both long-term resident and newly arrived third country <lb/>nationals (TCNs) are provided with free movement rights that are more in line with those of EU citizens. <lb/>For the Commission this is crucial in order to optimize the allocation of labour and to ensure greater <lb/>flexibility on the EU&apos;s labour market. <lb/>16. <lb/>The rationale and goals relating to ELM are embedded in the &apos;overarching framework of the <lb/>EU External Migration Policy&apos; (EC 2011b: 5), entitled the Global Approach to Migration and Mobility <lb/></body>

			<body>(GAMM), first adopted in 2005 and renewed in 2011, now with a more marked ELM profile. 6 Here, &apos;all <lb/>relevant aspects of migration&apos; are accounted for and brought together into a &apos;comprehensive&apos;, &apos;coherent&apos; <lb/>and &apos;balanced&apos; framework for the purpose of managing migration and mobility to the benefit of both the <lb/>EU and the sending countries (EC 2011b; 2014d). As one of GAMM&apos;s thematic priorities has it: <lb/>Good governance of migration and mobility of third countries nationals can create value on a daily <lb/>basis for the development of millions of people, increase the EU&apos;s competitiveness and enrich <lb/>European societies. This makes the Global Approach a core strategic interest of the EU and its <lb/>Member States. With an increasingly global labour market for the highly skilled, there is already <lb/>strong competition for talent. (EC 2011b: 5) <lb/>17. <lb/>GAMM thus explains how to construe the links between ELM and all the other prioritized areas <lb/>of EU migration policy (i.e. asylum, &apos;illegal&apos; migration, border security and visa policy); but it also <lb/>underscores ELM&apos;s close alignment with EU foreign and development policy. As such, GAMM contains <lb/>and seeks to develop in concert everything from supranational legislation and instruments with a firm <lb/>treaty basis, on the one side, to more loosely defined policy proposals and agreements, unbinding <lb/>declarations and future plans and visions, on the other. <lb/>18. <lb/>Apart from the work that has gone into specific ELM directives, GAMM reveals the persistent <lb/>work that the Commission also has invested in furthering the cause of ELM in a number of EU policy <lb/>processes, collaborations, formalized partnerships, dialogues and negotiations with single third countries, <lb/>groups of countries, regional and other international organizations. Alongside measure to create <lb/>cooperation with third countries on &apos;illegal&apos; immigration, border security, readmission and refugee <lb/>reception, much effort is thus also devoted to make these compatible with the opening of new and <lb/>development-enhancing channels for legal labour migration to the EU (EC 2011g). <lb/>19. <lb/>In the wake of the upheavals in North Africa and the war in Libya, EU migration policy activity <lb/>targeting North Africa has grown exponentially. According to the Commission, the crises and <lb/>transformations taking place in North Africa have accentuated the need for improved migration <lb/>management in the Mediterranean area, so as to facilitate, within the GAMM framework, legal migration <lb/>for North Africans in need of work and to help the EU meet key labour demands and amend its <lb/>demographic problems. In order to set in train such a mutually beneficial dynamic the Commission <lb/>proposed, in March 2011, to develop &apos;a partnership on migration, mobility and security with the Southern <lb/>Mediterranean countries&apos; (EC 2011c). The focus here is to promote circular labour migration to the EU, <lb/>built on &apos;real&apos; and &apos;clearly identified labour demands&apos;, that will &apos;help to meet the need for highly skilled <lb/>workers in the expanding sectors of the EU&apos;s economy but also help fill many jobs requiring a mix of <lb/>lower skills&apos; (EC 2011c: 7, 9). The Commission has stepped up these efforts further following the refugee <lb/>catastrophe at Lampedusa, which gave rise to the Task Force Mediterranean, calling for safe legal <lb/>migration channels to the EU (EC 2013d). <lb/>20. <lb/>Within various bilateral frameworks sorting under GAMM, such as the European Neighbourhood <lb/>Policy, the EU-Africa Strategic Partnership on Migration, Mobility and Employment and other <lb/>partnerships and agreements with third countries, 7 policies are enacted and developed to facilitate ELM, <lb/>mostly focusing on so-called circular migration, &apos;i.e. migrants coming to the EU for short periods and <lb/></body>

			<body>going back to a third country after the end of the contract.&apos; (EC 2014b; see also EC 2007c; 2011b). 8 <lb/>Among the most important concrete policy instruments in this context are the (bilateral and unbinding) <lb/>Mobility Partnerships—focusing on effective, secure and flexible management of movement between the <lb/>EU and third countries— that the EU (to date) has signed with seven third countries, 9 as well as the <lb/>Common Agendas on Migration and Mobility (EC 2011c). <lb/>21. <lb/>Yet, when speaking of compatibility between policies on &apos;illegal&apos; immigration, border security <lb/>and readmission, on the one side, and ELM, on the other, this should not be understood as a symmetric <lb/>relationship; rather, it is a highly asymmetrical one where the latter is to be made compatible with the <lb/>former. This could also be expressed as the golden rule of security-comes-first in EU migration policy, a <lb/>rule that has been criticised from within the European Parliament and by numerous NGOs and scholars <lb/>since the supranational level first tried to gain a say over external migration policy in the mid-1980s (see <lb/>Hansen &amp; Hager 2012; European Parliament 1990). It should also be mentioned that many analysts <lb/>assumed that the Commission&apos;s new affirmative position on ELM at the turn of the new millennium would <lb/>(logically) induce a toning down of the strong emphasis on migration security. These hopes, however, <lb/>where soon frustrated by Brussels&apos; decision to make sure that its repeal of &apos;zero immigration&apos; was <lb/>combined with a renewed pledge to EU citizens of strengthening migration security even further. This was <lb/>visible early on, such as in 2002 when the Commission (2002: 8) pointed to the merits of &apos;forced return of <lb/>illegal residents&apos;, arguing that this could &apos;help to ensure public acceptance for more openness towards new <lb/>legal immigrants against the background of more open admission policies particularly for labour migrants.&apos; <lb/>22. <lb/>Security, then, as in border security, policy to combat &apos;illegal&apos; migration and the plethora of other <lb/>migration control instruments developed within the EU framework, serves as the primary rationale and <lb/>objective that both practically and principally over determines ELM in all its forms, although it is less <lb/>emphasized in migration policy involving the highly qualified and high-skilled. 10 As the Commission <lb/>(2011a: 7) has emphasized on numerous occasions in recent years, the EU must &apos;ensure that the need for <lb/>enhanced mobility does not undermine the security of the Union&apos;s external borders&apos;; and therefore &apos;The <lb/>control of the EU&apos;s external border must be continuously improved to respond to new migration and <lb/>security challenges.&apos; &apos;Citizens&apos;, moreover, &apos;need to feel reassured that external border controls are working <lb/>properly&apos;, and authorities thus need to demonstrate that &apos;[p]reventing irregular migration and maintaining <lb/>public security are compatible with the objective of increased mobility&apos; (EC 2011a: 7, 11). Or, in a third <lb/>formulation: &apos;Without well-functioning border controls, lower levels of irregular migration and an <lb/>effective return policy, it will not be possible for the EU to offer more opportunities for legal migration and <lb/>mobility. The legitimacy of any policy framework relies on this.&apos; (EC 2011b: 5, italics in original; see also <lb/>EC 2014a: 2; Council EU 2012) In its contribution to the UN High-level Dialogue on International <lb/>Migration and Development in 2013, finally, the Commission (2013a: 4) makes sure to stress that &apos;In the <lb/>absence of effective governance, the costs of migration may be significant, and can include social tensions <lb/>with host populations—often exploited by populist forces—and pressure on scarce resources. Uncontrolled <lb/>migration may also aggravate security threats&apos;. <lb/>8 <lb/>For in-depth accounts on circular migration as it relates to EU policy, see the contributions in <lb/>Triandafyllidou (2013); Cassarion (2008); Venturini (2008); Feldman (2012); Carrera &amp; Hernández <lb/>iSagrera (2009). <lb/>9 <lb/>These are Moldova, Cape Verde, Georgia, Armenia, Morocco, Azerbaijan and Tunisia. <lb/>10 <lb/>As indicated in the EU&apos;s &apos;Key messages&apos; to the UN High Level Dialogue on International Migration and <lb/>Development: &apos;All states should review existing barriers to human mobility, with a view to remove barriers <lb/>which are not justified from a security point of view and are unnecessarily hindering economic <lb/>competitiveness and regional integration&apos; (EC 2013a: 11). <lb/></body>

			<body>23. <lb/>It is crucial to keep in mind, therefore, that whereas migration security constitutes a key objective <lb/>in and of itself, ELM is always made conditional on security. To the extent that the Commission is <lb/>determined to create a productive dynamic between the security oriented prevention of illegal immigration, <lb/>on the one side, and the growth and competitiveness oriented aspiration for a large-scale increase in ELM, <lb/>on the other, this dynamic needs to be construed as being founded on an asymmetrical relation. <lb/>The Commission&apos;s Approach <lb/>24. <lb/>Before turning to the actual legislation that have been achieved up to this point, something should <lb/>be said too about how the Commission has gone about its task of initiating legislation and getting <lb/>directives adopted on ELM. <lb/>25. <lb/>Put simply, the Commission has been pursuing two approaches or strategies. The one launched <lb/>initially, referred to as the horizontal approach, sought to create a broad general common framework for <lb/>the admission, residence conditions and the rights granted to any TCNs engaging in paid work and self-<lb/>employed economic activities. The first major directive proposal on ELM, presented by the Commission in <lb/>2001 and drawing on Tampere&apos;s mandate, strove for a high level of harmonisation, simplicity, <lb/>transparency and as little differentiation as possible amongst third country workers—hence the horizontal <lb/>approach. Basically, TCNs admitted for work in the EU should be treated as one single category and there <lb/>was also explicit mention of a &apos;pathway&apos; to permanent residence for those admitted. To be sure, member <lb/>states were to retain &apos;the right to limit admission&apos; as well as being provided with other forms of discretion; <lb/>and the principle of preference of the domestic labour market&apos;s workers over TCNs was also to apply (EC <lb/>2001b). <lb/>26. <lb/>While the directive proposal was given a favourable response by the European Parliament and the <lb/>European Economic and Social Committee (EESC), the Council would have none of it; the proposal was, <lb/>as Peers (2009: 410) puts it, &apos;dead on arrival in the Council&apos;. 11 <lb/>27. <lb/>But although the horizontal approach had been effectively blocked, this did not prevent the <lb/>Commission from forwarding new directive proposals. But in the process the Commission&apos;s strategy was <lb/>to change, something that was made official in its 2005 &apos;Policy Plan on Legal Migration&apos; (EC 2005a). The <lb/>Plan, which was drawn up at the request of the Hague European Council (in 2004), was preceded by the <lb/>Commission&apos;s &apos;Green Paper on an EU Approach to Managing Economic Migration&apos; (EC 2005b), which <lb/>presented a set of options for the future development of ELM as well as initiating a public consultation <lb/>process on this very matter. In the Green Paper the foiled horizontal approach was still presented as one of <lb/>the options. However, since it was prefaced with the Commission&apos;s acknowledgement of having <lb/>considered the member states&apos; reservations it was clear that it was no longer a viable option, but merely <lb/>included for the purpose of reaffirming the Commission&apos;s preferred approach. In order to break the <lb/>deadlock with the Council over ELM, the Commission went on to present a sectoral approach as its second <lb/>main option, and it did so on the merit of having already presented, in 2002 and 2004 respectively, two <lb/>separate sectoral directives for the entry and residence of third country students and researchers (as <lb/>discussed below). <lb/>28. <lb/>In the public consultation process on the Green Paper, several of the stakeholders expressed <lb/>scepticism toward the sectoral approach, cautioning that it would create a differential and fragmented <lb/>policy picture whereby rules and rights would apply differently and unequally to different categories of <lb/>TCNs. While the European Parliament&apos;s (2005: point 26) resolution advised against a sectoral legislation, <lb/>the EESC (2005: 4) went further, stating that &apos;[i]f the European Council were to opt for a sectoral approach <lb/>(geared towards highly skilled migrants), it would be discriminatory in nature.&apos; <lb/></body>

			<body>29. <lb/>Such objections notwithstanding, the Policy Plan on Legal Migration confirmed the sectoral <lb/>approach as the Commission&apos;s new strategy, one it, in actuality, had already embarked on in the student <lb/>and researchers directives. More specifically the Policy Plan outlined a roadmap for the next four years, <lb/>specifying that the Commission&apos;s priority would be to table five directives in all, four of which were to <lb/>address sector specific categories of migrants (highly skilled, seasonal, intra-corporate transferees and <lb/>remunerated trainees, as attended to below). In addition to this there would also be a proposal for a <lb/>framework directive (or single permit) defining basic rights for labour migrants (EC 2005a). <lb/>30. <lb/>In what follows these and other directives (9 in total) 12 relating to ELM are discussed, focusing <lb/>both on their specific content and goals, as well as how they measure up to the Commission&apos;s more general <lb/>and overarching rationale and objectives. <lb/>The Directives <lb/>The Long-Term Residence Directive <lb/>31. <lb/>As already noted, the Commission proposed directives relating to ELM prior the 2005 Policy <lb/>Plan; and although the failed horizontal proposal from 2001 counts as the first substantial one, important <lb/>ELM components were also included in the even earlier directive proposal (March 2001, EC 2001a) <lb/>concerning the status of third country nationals who are long-term residents, which was adopted in <lb/>November 2003. The Directive (Dir. 2003/109/EC) 13 establishes the conditions under which a member <lb/>state confers (and revokes) long-term resident status and accompanying rights to legally resident TCNs. 14 <lb/>Most importantly for the purposes here, the directive also lays down the rules concerning the rights of <lb/>residence for TCNs in member states other than the one that has granted them long-term resident status. <lb/>32. <lb/>As stipulated in the directive, the status of long-term resident should be given to applying TCNs <lb/>&apos;who have resided legally and continuously&apos; in a member state for five years. Other key requirements <lb/>specify that TCNs must demonstrate &apos;stable and regular resources&apos; that are adequate to support themselves <lb/>and their family dependants, &apos;without recourse to the social assistance system of the Member State <lb/>concerned&apos;; that they have sickness insurance; and that they abide by national integration obligations <lb/>where such apply. <lb/>33. <lb/>While this directive does not speak directly to the Commission&apos;s objective of increasing ELM—it <lb/>exclusively addresses the conditions for TCNs already residing in the EU—it aligns very well with <lb/>Brussels long-standing goal of closing the rights and labour mobility gap between member state nationals, <lb/>or EU citizens, and legally resident TCNs. This goal has been on the Commission&apos;s agenda since the early <lb/>1970s, as seen in these strong wordings from 1974: <lb/>12 <lb/>With one exception, all of the directives discussed here have been adopted; the ones on seasonal migration <lb/>and ICTs are still awaiting transposition. The one exception concerns a directive incorporating remunerated <lb/>trainees; this category is currently incorporated in a directive proposal, still under negotiation, &apos;on the <lb/>conditions of entry and residence of third-country nationals for the purposes of research, studies, pupil <lb/>exchange, remunerated and unremunerated training, voluntary service and au pairing&apos; (EC 2013b). <lb/>13 <lb/>Council Directive 2003/109/EC of 25November 2003 concerning the status of third-country nationals who <lb/>are long-term residents. The UK, Ireland and Denmark do not take part in this directive. <lb/>14 <lb/>As of 2013, according to Eurostat, TCNs made up 4 per cent of the EU&apos;s population (or 20.4 million) (EC <lb/>2014b: 3). <lb/></body>

			<body>[T]he legal situation of migrant workers coming from third countries depends on the status accorded <lb/>to them by the host country. […] The result is that migrant workers from third countries are generally <lb/>treated less favourably than workers coming from the Member States, and the situation of these third <lb/>country migrants varies considerably from one country to another. [T]he social conditions of the <lb/>migrant do indeed give cause for serious concern—especially in the case of third country migrants, <lb/>who have no Community protection and rely solely on often restrictive national legislation […] For <lb/>this reason solutions in common must be found, not only to the problems of Community migrants but <lb/>also for those from third countries. These solutions must take account of the migrant workers&apos; needs <lb/>and their rightful place in a society to whose prosperity and well-being they contribute. As the migrant <lb/>population increases, and they remain longer in the Community, so their interests in the affluent <lb/>society around them increases and their sense of exclusion from it can become more acute (EC 1976 <lb/>[1974]: 14, 12). <lb/>34. <lb/>Thirty years later the Commission&apos;s perseverance can be said to have borne some fruit in the <lb/>long-term resident directive (LTR), which was made possible by the Amsterdam Treaty&apos;s Article 63, the <lb/>Tampere European Council and the Tampere Programme&apos;s commitment to &apos;safeguarding the rights of third <lb/>country nationals&apos;. <lb/>35. <lb/>The pledge to improve the lot of the EU&apos;s legal and permanently settled TCNs was clearly one of <lb/>the boldest declarations made in Tampere and, as such, it is asserted in the preambles to all but one of the <lb/>directives discussed in this paper; in most of them, moreover, &apos;the protection of the rights of third-country <lb/>nationals&apos; appears in the preamble&apos;s first recital. By stating that &apos;a more vigorous integration policy should <lb/>aim at granting them [TCNs] rights and obligations comparable to those of EU citizens&apos;, the Council <lb/>opened up for a revision of the legal restraints built into the EU citizenship that was instituted by the <lb/>Maastricht Treaty. It must be emphasized, though, that neither Amsterdam nor the declarations in Tampere <lb/>indicated that permanently settled TCNs were about to become naturalized EU citizens any time soon, or, <lb/>for that matter, that long-term residence was about to replace nationality as the determining principle of EU <lb/>citizenship (Kostakopoulou 2002: 452). This provided, the strategy adopted by the Commission since then, <lb/>and as clearly reflected in the LTR directive, has rather been geared toward making the most of Tampere&apos;s <lb/>pledge to grant rights to TCNs that are &apos;comparable to those of EU citizens&apos;. <lb/>36. <lb/>To improve TCNs&apos; intra-EU mobility rights is of course crucial to this strategy. &apos;A genuine area <lb/>of freedom, security and justice&apos;, the Commission (EC 2001a: 8) affirmed in the LTR directive proposal in <lb/>2001, &apos;is unthinkable without a degree of mobility for third-country nationals residing there legally, and <lb/>particularly for those residing on a long-term basis&apos;. With the adoption of the LTR directive, then, the <lb/>Commission gained (somewhat of) a hearing for its repeated calls for facilitating TCNs&apos; intra-EU mobility <lb/>and residence. <lb/>37. <lb/>The Commission&apos;s attempt to expand the scope of free movement to also incorporate TCNs must <lb/>be understood in the context of its perpetual mission to stimulate labour mobility within the EU area. In the <lb/>LTR directive proposal the Commission contended that to continue barring legally resident TCNs from the <lb/>free movement provisions runs counter to &apos;the demands of an employment market that is in a process of <lb/>far-reaching change, where greater flexibility is needed&apos; (EC 2001a: 8): <lb/>The evolution of the employment market in the Union is highlighting employment shortages in certain <lb/>sectors of the economy. Third-country nationals who are long-term residents may be ready and willing <lb/>to relocate either in order to put their vocational skills to work in another Member State or to escape <lb/>unemployment in the Member State where they reside. The mobility of long-term residents can thus <lb/>make for better utilisation of employment reserves available in different Member States (EC 2001a:8). <lb/></body>

			<page>16 <lb/></page>

			<body>38. <lb/>It is in this larger context that the objectives of the LTR directive (and subsequent directives that <lb/>similarly seek to facilitate TCNs&apos; intra-EU mobility) need to be situated; or as stated in the LTR directive&apos;s <lb/>preamble: &apos;It could also constitute a major factor of mobility, notably on the Union&apos;s employment market.&apos; <lb/>Permanently settled TCNs constitute an untapped labour reserve that, once unhampered by the EU&apos;s <lb/>internal borders, could help remedy recurrent labour shortages in growth industries and other labour market <lb/>distortions across the Union. Moreover, since TCNs suffer disproportionately from unemployment, the <lb/>Commission seems to presume they should be more prone (given their weaker bargaining position) to <lb/>intra-EU labour mobility than are member state nationals. As such, the LTR directive does, in fact, <lb/>indirectly promote the goal of increasing ELM, both by providing for mobility within the EU that could <lb/>increase third country labour flows to some member states (that might suffer comparatively more from <lb/>labour shortages and demographic imbalances) and by enabling onward movement of third country labour <lb/>migrants from member states with more open ELM policies (and thus higher inflows) to members with <lb/>more restrictive policies; in the latter case the directive would have a positive impact on absolute numbers. <lb/>39. <lb/>Yet, it needs emphasizing that the mobility rights offered to TCNs by the LTR directive are <lb/>nowhere near those contained in EU citizenship provisions; also, the directive was a far cry from the <lb/>Commission&apos;s original proposal for such a directive (as tabled in 2001), which aimed to provide TCNs <lb/>with more rights. As with all the directives covered in this paper, moreover, the LTR directive is fraught <lb/>with exceptions and red-tape, and with regard to rights and equal treatment for the long-term resident <lb/>TCNs numerous disparities prevail, both as concern the situation in the granting member state and the <lb/>conditions applying to a long-term resident who wishes to move to another member state. In the latter case, <lb/>just to point to one of many derogations, non-granting member states are allowed to &apos;limit the total number <lb/>of persons entitled to be granted right of residency&apos; (Art 14: 4), a derogation highlighting member states&apos; <lb/>refusal give a blank cheque to TCNs&apos; intra-EU movement. Reflecting the fragmented and stratified scope, <lb/>which in turn results from the failure of adopting a more horizontal approach (as discussed above), the <lb/>directive exempts no less than six categories of TCNs from its provisions. In 2011 the Commission <lb/>managed to have the directive amended in order &apos;to extend its scope to beneficiaries of international <lb/>protection&apos; (Dir. 2011/51/EU), 15 a category who is now also eligible for long-term resident status. <lb/>The Student and Researchers Directives <lb/>40. <lb/>Adopted a year after the LTR directive, the so-called Student Directive (Dir. 2004/114/EC) 16 also <lb/>deserves mention here. As with the former this directive is neither explicitly tied to the goal of increasing <lb/>and facilitating ELM; in fact, it is explicitly dissociated from &apos;the labour-market situation in the host <lb/>country&apos;. Yet, since it concerns itself with (treaty and Tampere) provisions directly pertaining to the <lb/>&apos;approximation&apos; of the member states&apos; rules on admission and residence of TCNs as well the improvement <lb/>of TCNs&apos; situation in the EU, it is clearly worth consideration in the wider ELM context. Not the least due <lb/>to the obvious fact that third country students who have their foot inside the door very well might be <lb/>recruited for work in the EU at a later stage. <lb/>41. <lb/>Setting out from the broad objectives of championing the EU as an educational &apos;world centre of <lb/>excellence&apos; and promoting third country student mobility to the EU, the immediate purpose of the directive <lb/>is to create a common legal framework defining the conditions and procedural rules for admission of TCNs <lb/>to the EU &apos;for a period exceeding three months for the purpose of studies, pupil exchange, unremunerated <lb/>training or voluntary service&apos;. Whereas the directive &apos;shall apply&apos; to TCNs who apply for purposes of study <lb/>15 <lb/>Directive 2011/51/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 May 2011 amending Council <lb/>Directive 2003/109/EC to extend its scope to beneficiaries of international protection. <lb/>16 <lb/>Council Directive 2004/114/EC, of 13 December 2004, on the conditions of admission of third-country <lb/>nationals, for the purposes of studies, pupil exchange, unremunerated training or voluntary service. The <lb/>UK, Ireland and Denmark do not take part in this directive. <lb/></body>

			<body>(i.e. higher education), member states &apos;may also decide&apos; to have the other activities fall within the <lb/>directive&apos;s scope. As part the wider focus on mobility, the directive stipulates that students who apply to <lb/>conduct a part of their studies at a higher education establishment in a member state other than the one they <lb/>were first admitted to &apos;shall be admitted&apos; to that member state in due course and pending certain <lb/>conditions. Equally relevant in this context, and notwithstanding the preamble&apos;s explication that the <lb/>directive&apos;s migration provisions are not conditioned by &apos;the labour-market situation in the host country&apos;, is <lb/>the fact that &apos;students shall be entitled to be employed and may be entitled to exercise self-employed <lb/>economic activity&apos; (Art. 17). To be sure, however, member states are allowed to impose a number of <lb/>restrictions in this area. <lb/>42. <lb/>Closely related to the Student Directive, the so-called Researchers Directive (Dir. 2005/71/EC) 17 <lb/>was adopted in October 2005. Aiming to attract third country researchers to the EU and forming an integral <lb/>part of the creation of a European Research Area and the Lisbon Strategy&apos;s goal of turning the EU into &apos;the <lb/>most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world by 2010&apos;, this directive was also <lb/>launched for the more particular purpose of contributing to the target (set in 2003) of having an additional <lb/>700 000 researchers working in the Union by 2010 (via a goal of earmarking 3% of GDP for investment in <lb/>research). <lb/>43. <lb/>Conditional on a hosting agreement with a research organization, the directive establishes the <lb/>(simplified) admission terms for researchers from third countries who are to carry out research in a <lb/>member state for more than three months. The researchers are granted rights comparable to those of <lb/>member state nationals in a number of areas (much in line with the LTR directive), but in contrast to <lb/>students and doctoral students (under the Student directive) they are afforded more favourable intra-EU <lb/>mobility rights and they are afforded both family reunification and EU mobility for family members <lb/>(neither of these apply to students). As Chou (2012: 1062) notes, moreover, and contrary to future ELM <lb/>directives (e.g. the Blue Card directive), the principle of Community preference, or labour market test, <lb/>does not apply to the directive. <lb/>44. <lb/>Although third country researchers, as by definition, always will involve relatively few people, <lb/>this directive nonetheless answers directly to the Commission&apos;s goal of increasing ELM, at least in the <lb/>high-skilled category; this too, since it exclusively addresses third country nationals (and their family <lb/>members) who will migrate to the EU, as opposed to TCNs who are already EU residents. Together with <lb/>the student directive it is also of some principal and symbolic importance since it conforms to the <lb/>Commission&apos;s long-standing goal, dating to the Single Market relaunch in the early 1980s (Geddes 2000: <lb/>70), of supranational harmonization of migrant admission policies. <lb/>45. <lb/>Both of these directives should have been transposed into national law in 2007; however, more <lb/>than half of the members failed to do so, prompting the Commission to issue infringements proceedings. In <lb/>the subsequent reports on the application of the directives, both of which were published in 2011, the <lb/>Commission voiced its dissatisfaction with the performance of the directives (EC 2011e; 2011f). Among <lb/>other things, the Commission drew attention to the dismally low number of third country researchers that <lb/>had been admitted under the researchers directive. <lb/>46. <lb/>In the spring of 2013, therefore, the Commission decided to table a proposal to amend both <lb/>directives and merge them into one directive, calling for improvements and additions regarding a number <lb/>of key components, such as admission procedures, rights, intra-EU mobility, number of binding rules and <lb/>overall coherence. Most of all, the Commission (2013b) intends to make the directives more compatible <lb/></body>

			<body>with the Europe 2020 Strategy and the EU&apos;s Global Approach to Migration and Mobility (GAMM), 18 <lb/>highlighting the ever-increasing importance of attracting talented third country students and researchers to <lb/>the EU. The directive proposal also sounds the alarm over the EU&apos;s alleged &apos;innovation emergency&apos; vis-à-<lb/>vis the US and Japan, its shrinking working age population and structural demographic and economic <lb/>challenges that risk to grow worse unless the EU manages to compete successfully for global talent: <lb/>&apos;Thousands of the best researchers and innovators have moved to countries where conditions are more <lb/>favourable&apos; (EC 2013b: 2). <lb/>47. <lb/>The proposal is also much more explicit than the two original directives in its emphasis on the <lb/>labour migration aspect: &apos;One of the key elements of this proposal would be to better tap into the potential <lb/>of students and researchers upon finalizing their studies/research. They constitute a future pool of highly <lb/>skilled workers as they speak the language and are integrated in the host society.&apos; (EC 2013b: 8) The <lb/>amended directive thus intends to provide students with more possibilities to work while studying as well <lb/>as giving both students and researchers the right, upon completion of their studies/research, to stay for an <lb/>additional 12 months in order to seek work and to start a business. As in the case of the amended LTR <lb/>directive above, the proposal adds new categories of TCNs to be covered by the directive&apos;s admission <lb/>conditions. These are labour migrants admitted to work as au pairs and remunerated trainees, 19 thus again <lb/>evincing the directive&apos;s ELM focus. In addition to this the amended directive proposes to extend and <lb/>improve the intra-EU mobility and labour market access terms for family members of third country <lb/>researchers; and it facilitates mobility for students and researchers. <lb/>The Blue Card and Single Permit Directives <lb/>48. <lb/>The Blue Card Directive (Dir. 2009/50/EC), 20 which was adopted in May 2009 to attract highly <lb/>qualified labour migrants to the EU, is arguably the EU&apos;s most publicly well-known labour migration <lb/>directive to date, immediately acquiring a flagship status due to the fact that the Commission finally could <lb/>point to an instrument with a potential (at least ostensibly) to involve fairly large number of new labour <lb/>migrants. Indeed, when the European Parliament, in the autumn of 2008, overwhelmingly approved the <lb/>Commission&apos;s Blue Card proposal, the then EU Home Affairs Commissioner, Jacques Barrot, translated <lb/>the Parliament&apos;s approval as clearly indicating &apos;that Europeans are open to immigration flows and that we <lb/>are welcoming to nationals from outside Europe&apos; (quoted in Goldirova 2008). <lb/>49. <lb/>Building on the Amsterdam Treaty and the Hague Programme&apos;s provisions and tailored to amend <lb/>projected labour and skills shortages and to the Lisbon Strategy, the directive lays down the terms of entry, <lb/>residence and intra-EU mobility for highly qualified third country workers and their families. As with the <lb/>LTR and researchers directives it stipulates socio-economic rights in a number of areas as well as a set of <lb/>labour rights, in accordance with the goal of approximating the rights of TCNs with those of member state <lb/>nationals. The directive explicitly seeks to encourage circular migration between countries of origin and <lb/>the EU, but it also provides a path to long-term resident status in the EU, in keeping with the rules of the <lb/>LTR directive. <lb/>18 <lb/>As part of GAMM, the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP) and the bilateral Mobility Partnerships <lb/>signed with a growing number of non-EU countries are specifically mentioned as means by which the EU <lb/>could increase its intake of researchers and students. <lb/></body>

			<body>50. <lb/>While the directive is promoted for its rights provisions and commitment to making the EU most <lb/>attractive destination for highly qualified migrants, it also contains numerous complicated requirements <lb/>and restrictions as well as many discretionary and derogative powers for the member states, the latter, of <lb/>course, a sine qua non for making the adoption of the directive possible in the first place. Due to this, as <lb/>many scholars have pointed out, the directive&apos;s facilitating impact on the harmonization of the different <lb/>member states&apos; admission systems, which made up one of the Commission&apos;s main rationales for the Blue <lb/>Card in its original directive proposal (EC 2007b: 3), can only be meagre at best. 21 As Eisele (2013: 2) puts <lb/>it, by failing to phase out the 28 different national systems for qualified third country workers, as originally <lb/>intended, the Blue Card directive can best be likened to &apos;an upgraded national residence and work permit&apos;. <lb/>51. <lb/>Many limitations also apply to intra-EU mobility, another of Brussels&apos; key motivations for <lb/>launching the Blue Card proposal. 22 As Article 18 has it, before a Blue Card holder and his/her family <lb/>&apos;may move to&apos; another member state, the card holder must have resided at least 18 months in the first <lb/>member state. Yet as the &apos;may&apos; clause indicates (and the directive contains many of these), even then their <lb/>intra-EU mobility is not guaranteed, since the directive specifies that &apos;Member states may continue to <lb/>apply volumes of admission as referred to in Article 6&apos;. As Article 6 establishes, restating the treaty&apos;s <lb/>Article 79, this directive &apos;shall not affect the right of a Member State to determine the volume of admission <lb/>of third-country nationals entering its territory for the purposes of highly qualified employment.&apos; This is of <lb/>course the most crucial impediment to making due on the Commission&apos;s main objective of stimulating a <lb/>large increase in ELM; at the same time this was made clear by the Commission already when it presented <lb/>its proposal in 2007, the press release stating that the directive &apos;does not create a right of admission; and is <lb/>demand-driven, i.e. based on a work contract. Member States will therefore maintain control on which <lb/>type—and on how many—highly qualified workers will enter their labour markets&apos; (EC 2007a: 2; see also <lb/>EC 2007b: 7). In effect, this means that member states retain the option of not issuing any Blue Cards at <lb/>all, thus defeating the purpose of the directive. In a nutshell, this illustrates just how contentious the issue <lb/>of EU harmonization of ELM is in the EU, with member states showing little interest in ceding control, <lb/>particularly when it comes to the key matters of admission, access to labour markets and volumes of labour <lb/>migrants. <lb/>52. <lb/>In its &apos;5th Annual Report on Immigration and Asylum (2013)&apos;, published in May 2014, the <lb/>Commission (2014b: 13) takes note of the low number of Blue Cards being issued so far: 3644 in total for <lb/>2012, of which Germany stood for 2584. As a tentative explanation, the Commission, in its implementation <lb/>report from May 2104, points to the already operating and competing national systems for high-skilled <lb/>migration, defective transposition of the directive, &apos;the low level of coherence, the limited set of rights and <lb/>barriers to intra-EU mobility&apos; as well as to poor information (EC 2014c: 10). <lb/>53. <lb/>In this context mention should also be made of the Single Permit Directive, or the Framework <lb/>directive (Dir. 2011/98/EU), 23 which was launched alongside the Blue Card directive proposal in 2007 (EC <lb/>2007d). Of the directives dealt with here, this was the first to be adopted under the Lisbon Treaty and thus <lb/>21 <lb/>For more on the limited scope and impact of the Blue Card, see e.g. the contributions in Grütters and Strik <lb/>(eds, 2013); Cerna (2014); Gümüs (2010); Peers (2009). <lb/>22 <lb/>As stated by the Commission (2007: 6) in the directive proposal: &apos;Intra-EU mobility would be a strong <lb/>incentive for third-country highly qualified workers to enter the EU labour market, and could play a <lb/>primary role in relieving the labour shortages in certain areas/sectors.&apos; <lb/>23 <lb/>Directive 2011/98/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 December 2011 on a single <lb/>application procedure for a single permit for third-country nationals to reside and work in the territory of a <lb/>Member State and on a common set of rights for third-country workers legally residing in a Member State. <lb/>The UK, Ireland and Denmark do not take part in this directive. <lb/></body>

			<body>in accordance with the Community method and its full parliamentary co-decision powers. 24 Since the <lb/>proposal was met with much objection from member states in the Council and also subject to ample <lb/>disagreement within the Parliament—which at first (in 2010), and in part due to the directive&apos;s sectoral <lb/>approach, voted to reject the proposal—and, subsequently, between the Council and the Parliament, a <lb/>significantly altered directive was only adopted in December 2011, after more than four years of protracted <lb/>negotiations. <lb/>54. <lb/>With reference to the Lisbon Treaty&apos;s Article 79(2) and the objectives of the Tampere European <lb/>Council and the Stockholm Programme, the directive lays down &apos;a single application procedure for issuing <lb/>a single permit for third-country nationals to reside for the purpose of work in the territory of a member <lb/>state&apos;; and it establishes &apos;a common set of rights of third-country workers legally residing in a Member <lb/>State, irrespective of the purposes for which they were initially admitted&apos; (Art. 1). Explicitly steering clear <lb/>of any bearing upon &apos;the admission, including the volumes of admission, of third country nationals for the <lb/>purposes of work&apos;, the directive&apos;s first subject matter relates exclusively to provisions whereby TCNs (or <lb/>their employers) enter into a single application procedure that, in turn, should a member state grant <lb/>admission, results in a &apos;combined title&apos; covering both residence and work permits &apos;within a single <lb/>administrative act&apos;. <lb/>55. <lb/>The aim is thus to contribute to procedural simplification, greater efficiency and harmonization of <lb/>national rules, something that is said to facilitate control of migration and the legality of migrants&apos; stay in <lb/>the EU. As to the second subject matter, regarding rights, this reiterates Tampere&apos;s, but also the Stockholm <lb/>Programme&apos;s, pledge to ensure fair treatment of TCNs and rights that are comparable with member state <lb/>nationals. In the preamble the objective of &apos;narrowing&apos; the so-called &apos;rights gap between citizens of the <lb/>Union and third-country nationals legally working in a Member State&apos; is elaborated in some detail. The <lb/>directive establishes that third country workers who have been granted single permits will enjoy a set of <lb/>equal treatment rights comparable to those of EU citizens (Art. 12; e.g. working conditions, freedom of <lb/>association, branches of social security and tax benefits), yet not on a par with those afforded under the <lb/>Blue Card and LTR directives. In essence, and as stated in the preamble, the rights under the single permit <lb/>directive are specifically, although not exclusively, intended for third country workers &apos;who are not yet <lb/>long-term residents&apos; (recital 19) and thus not eligible for the LTR directive&apos;s provisions. As also stated in <lb/>the preamble, and provided &apos;the absence of horizontal legislation&apos;, this is done in order &apos;to developing <lb/>further a coherent immigration policy and narrowing the rights gap&apos; between TCNs and EU citizens. <lb/>56. <lb/>These ambitions notwithstanding, the single permit directive may be the most conspicuous <lb/>illustration so far of the disjointing effects stemming from &apos;the absence of horizontal legislation&apos;. To begin <lb/>with, the directive lists no less than 12 categories of TCNs to whom the directive &apos;shall not apply&apos; (Article <lb/>3); some of these, but far from all, are covered by more favourable terms in previous directives. As <lb/>numerous scholarly accounts point out, moreover, member states managed to not only reduce the scope <lb/>and binding force of the directive; they also procured ample room to manoeuvre within what was left in the <lb/>directive, including significant latitude for interpretation, national law involvement and restrictions of <lb/>rights for TCNs (Brinkmann 2012; Groenendijk 2013; Peers 2012a). As Brinkmann&apos;s (2012: 365–6) <lb/>detailed study concludes, then, the directive can have &apos;only a limited harmonising effect&apos; (see also <lb/>Pascouau &amp; McLoughlin 2012). The transposition date for the single permit directive was set for 25 <lb/>December 2013. Yet, as the Commission noted in its Annual Report (2014b: 14), by the end of 2013 only 8 <lb/>members had complied, prompting the Commission to open infringements proceedings. <lb/>24 <lb/>Initially, the directive had its legal basis in the old Article 63, when the Community method did not apply, <lb/>but since it had not been adopted when the Lisbon Treaty (and the full scope of the Community method) <lb/>entered into force in December 2009, its legal basis was changed to Article 79. <lb/></body>

			<body>The Seasonal Workers Directive <lb/>57. <lb/>After nearly four years of negotiations, the Seasonal Workers Directive (Dir. 2014/36/EU) 25 was <lb/>adopted in February 2014. It specifies the terms of entry, stay and rights of TCNs who apply to be <lb/>employed as seasonal labour in the EU for a maximum stay of between five to nine months within a 12-<lb/>month period. Although the directive leaves decisions about volumes of seasonal labour to be admitted <lb/>exclusively in the hands of member states, this, together with the Blue Card, is the only directive to date <lb/>that at least nominally aligns with the Commission&apos;s goal of significantly increasing the admission of third <lb/>country labour migrants to the EU. Industries employing seasonal migrant labour (tourism, agriculture and <lb/>horticulture are mentioned in the directive but member states are entitled to define additional ones) are by <lb/>nature labour intensive, since cost can be kept at a minimum, and they have an obvious growth potential <lb/>given the pull of high unemployment of unskilled labour in countries close to the EU. <lb/>58. <lb/>As a partial solution to the problem of high unemployment in North African countries and <lb/>elsewhere, the Commission has, within the framework of GAMM (as discussed above), made repeated <lb/>calls for a better migration management in the Mediterranean and for more legal migration channels to the <lb/>EU. The directive fits with this objective by being the first one to be promoted in terms of circular <lb/>migration and by being specifically designed to support development and prevent &apos;illegal immigration&apos; and <lb/>employers&apos; exploitation of TCNs through a set of &apos;fair and transparent rules for admission and stay&apos;. In <lb/>turn, these are intended to work legalizing on work in industries heavily staffed by undocumented <lb/>migrants. As part of this, the directive puts much emphasis on &apos;safeguards to prevent overstaying or <lb/>temporary stay from becoming permanent&apos; (see also the Commission&apos;s directive proposal, EC 2010b); and, <lb/>as such, it is also adapted to the previously adopted Employers Sanctions Directive. 26 As the European <lb/>Parliament&apos;s (2014) press release highlighted upon the passing of the directive, the rules established &apos;aim <lb/>both to end exploitation and to prevent temporary stays becoming permanent&apos;. <lb/>59. <lb/>Aside from the treaty competence under Article 79(2), the directive, as outlined in the extensive <lb/>preamble, is based on a number of EU migration policy aims and commitments, including the Hague <lb/>Programme&apos;s call for measures to meet &apos;fluctuating demands for migrant labour&apos;; the European Council&apos;s <lb/>(of December 2006) request to examine measures to stimulate temporary migration; the European Pact on <lb/>Immigration&apos;s goal (agreed in 2008) of &apos;proper management of migration flows&apos; in cooperation with third <lb/>countries; and, not the least, the Stockholm Programme&apos;s recognition of the importance of ELM in <lb/>responding to demographic challenges and labour shortages and hence ELM&apos;s &apos;important contribution to <lb/>the Union&apos;s economic development and performance in the long term&apos;. <lb/>60. <lb/>While taking note of &apos;fair treatment&apos; of TCNs and while granting a set of minimum basic rights <lb/>to seasonal workers (encompassing e.g. equal treatment in the areas of working conditions, terms of <lb/>employment, working hours, pay and dismissal, minimum working age, health and safety requirements, <lb/>freedom of association and the right to strike), the directive&apos;s rights provisions also differ significantly <lb/>from most of the other EU directives relating to ELM. For instance, and due to member states&apos; preferences, <lb/>the directive does not provide for intra-EU mobility, something that facilitated the adoption process <lb/>(Lazarowicz 2014: 1). In addition, it does not grant family reunification and it limits equal treatment in a <lb/>number of areas, restraints that NGOs lobbied against during the negotiation period (see e.g. Joint NGO <lb/>25 <lb/>Directive 2014/36/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 February 2014 on the <lb/>conditions of entry and stay of third-country nationals for the purpose of employment as seasonal workers. <lb/>The UK, Ireland and Denmark do not take part in this directive. <lb/></body>

			<note place="footnote">26 <lb/>Directive 2009/52/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 June 2009 providing for <lb/>minimum standards on sanctions and measures against employers of illegally staying third-country <lb/>nationals. <lb/></note>

			<body>Statement 2011). This is obviously due to the temporary nature of seasonal work (see EC 2013c) but <lb/>nevertheless underscores the stratifying effects of the sectoral approach to ELM. <lb/>61. <lb/>For the same reason, and also in contrast to other ELM directives, there is no mention of migrant <lb/>&apos;integration&apos; in this directive. The absence of an integration endorsement can also be construed as <lb/>contingent on the fact that the migrant labour addressed in this directive will enter highly segregated labour <lb/>markets that, as the Commission has underscored time and again, face a permanent and growing &apos;structural <lb/>need for low-skilled and low-qualified workers&apos; that cannot be satisfied by &apos;EU national workers, primarily <lb/>owing to the fact that these workers consider seasonal work unattractive&apos; (EC 2010b: 2–3). If this explains <lb/>the non-appearance of references to migrant integration in the directive, their absence as well as the <lb/>Commission&apos;s sanction of segregated labour markets nonetheless contradict sharply with the <lb/>Commission&apos;s overall emphasis on the crucial importance of migrants&apos; successful integration into EU host <lb/>societies. As the Commission (2005a: 4) has stated on numerous occasions: &apos;Admission of economic <lb/>immigrants is inseparable from measures on integration&apos;. <lb/>62. <lb/>As with the other directives discussed here, finally, due mainly to Council resistance this <lb/>directive also fails to meet the harmonization goals set up initially. Many of the administrative components <lb/>related to admission, for instance, are to be kept within the purview of the member states, and the directive <lb/>allows for a number of different admission terms, partly to avoid conflict with the Schengen acquis. In <lb/>addition, and yet again in conformity with the other directives, the directive excludes a number of <lb/>categories of third country nationals and it leaves much discretion to member states (see further Delaney <lb/>2013; Jonjić &amp; Mavrodi 2012; Monar 2013). <lb/>The ICT Directive <lb/>63. <lb/>After some very difficult negotiations, lasting for four years, the Parliament and Council finally <lb/>adopted the intra-corporate transferees directive (Dir. 2014/66/EU), laying down the terms of entry, <lb/>residence and rights of third country managers, specialists and trainee employees who apply to be admitted <lb/>as part of an intra-corporate transfer. 27 By facilitating the entry and stay of ICTs (defined as temporary <lb/>workers), 28 the EU is to benefit from the added competence, skills, knowledge and innovation capacity that <lb/>these migrants bring. In turn, this is to spur investment and benefit the knowledge-based economy. Besides <lb/>treaty provisions authorizing a common migration policy, the ICT directive thus draws on the Europe 2020 <lb/>strategy and its aims to have innovation and knowledge contribute more to economic growth. Once <lb/>transposed (November 2016), the Commission expects the directive to apply to some 15–20 000 new ICTs <lb/>annually. <lb/>64. <lb/>The most contentious aspects of the proposal revolved around rights for the ICTs, in general, and <lb/>intra-EU mobility rights, in particular. The Council insisted that ICTs should be placed on a par with <lb/>posted workers, whereas the Parliament argued for equal treatment along similar lines as member state <lb/>nationals (Monar 2013; Kostakopoulou, Acosta Arcarazo and Munk 2014: 144; Peers 2012b). However, as <lb/>Peers (2012b: 105) has it, the Council and Parliament positions were &apos;not radically far apart&apos; and in the end <lb/>a compromise was finally struck. Here, and in accordance with the Council&apos;s position, it was agreed that <lb/>&apos;Intra-corporate transferees should benefit from at least the same terms and conditions of employment as <lb/>posted workers whose employer is established on the territory of the Union&apos; (Article 15). At the same time, <lb/>the Parliament managed to incorporate the right to equal treatment into many of areas (Brieskova 2014). <lb/>27 <lb/>Directive 2014/66/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 May 2014 on the conditions of <lb/>entry and residence of third-country nationals in the framework of an intra-corporate transfer. The UK, <lb/>Ireland and Denmark do not take part in this directive. <lb/>28 <lb/>The maximum duration of stay is limited to three years for managers and experts and one year for trainee <lb/>employees. <lb/></body>

			<page>23 <lb/></page>

			<body>65. <lb/>During the negotiations the European Trade Union Confederation (ETUC) argued that the rights <lb/>framework for ICTs should be modelled on the Seasonal Workers Directive, not on posted workers; this to <lb/>safeguard workers&apos; protection and to prevent further fragmentation of the EU&apos;s labour market. As a result <lb/>of the Council carrying the day on this issue, the directive&apos;s list of rights turned out to be quite short, <lb/>including no more than three items. On the other hand, and in contrast to seasonal workers, ICTs were <lb/>granted family reunification, although not to the same extent as the Parliament had wanted and as applies <lb/>to third country workers in other directives. Also in contrast to seasonal workers, ICTs and their families <lb/>were given intra-EU mobility rights. However, this came with many strings attached as the Council <lb/>prevailed over the Parliament&apos;s request for less member state discretion in this area. Together with <lb/>numerous other derogations, highly complex rules and much leeway for the member states, this diminishes <lb/>the directive&apos;s harmonisation effect. <lb/></body>

			<body>CONCLUSION <lb/>66. <lb/>Judged by the European Commission&apos;s yardstick of what needs to be done in order to enable a <lb/>large-scale increase of ELM, the EU policies and legislation enacted over the past 15 years are nothing <lb/>short of disappointing; and the first to acknowledge this is the Commission itself. As the then Home <lb/>Affairs Commissioner put it in an interview in 2013, when referring to the necessity of stimulating labour <lb/>migration: &apos;But it is politically impossible to attain in today&apos;s Europe&apos; (quoted in Larsson 2013). <lb/>Malmström is here foremost referring to the Commission&apos;s most favoured approach, namely the horizontal <lb/>one of broad, supranational and thus harmonized rules, with as little differentiation as possible. But as <lb/>shown in this paper, with the horizontal approach effectively discarded already in 2001, the Commission <lb/>has instead spent the last decade pursuing a piecemeal sectoral approach that it never trusted in the first <lb/>place. And given the great amount of discretion that the member states have managed to secure in each and <lb/>every directive adopted so far, such lack of confidence is only natural; it is borne out of the experience of <lb/>seeing each sectoral directive not even fulfilling its primary objective of generating a fair amount of <lb/>harmonization in the targeted sector. As seen too, the sectoral approach has also compromised many of the <lb/>Commission&apos;s original objectives, not least concerning transparency, rights and equal treatment of TCNs. <lb/>67. <lb/>However, measured by another, less technocratic and more realistic, standard, the development <lb/>accounted for here may well appear as both less disappointing and less irrational. Less disappointing <lb/>because, given the political and economic realities on the ground, the likelihood of erecting an ELM <lb/>regime even modestly resembling the one advocated by the Commission has always been slim at best. <lb/>Moreover, what was very difficult to achieve with 15 members has not become easier with 28 members, all <lb/>with highly diverse labour needs, unemployment levels, industrial structures, welfare regimes, positions in <lb/>the business cycle and political leanings. Even if the member states were all in agreement with Brussels&apos; <lb/>goal of a massively increasing ELM, which many of them are in principle, these factors would still <lb/>constitute a significant obstacle to getting agreement on supranational harmonization. In addition, several <lb/>member states have invested quite some efforts in getting their own ELM policies up and running (as <lb/>acknowledged by the Commission in its assessment of the Blue Card directive) and so have little <lb/>inclination to scrap these for EU policies that may be less sensitive to national interests. To illustrate a bit <lb/>further, recent Eurostat figures may be instructive. They show that EU member states &apos;issued around 2,36 <lb/>million first residence permits to third country nationals in 2013&apos;, a 12 per cent increase as compared to <lb/>2012. Of these residence permits, 23 per cent were specifically issued for employment purposes. <lb/>Somewhat contrary to what the &apos;demographic deficit&apos; debate often gives at hand, these figures show that <lb/>&apos;legal&apos; third country immigration to the EU is far from insignificant. Yet when this data are disaggregated <lb/>to the member state level it is also possible to discern a highly varied picture, both number-wise and <lb/>proportionally speaking, with, for instance, six member states accounting for about 80 per cent of the total <lb/>issuing of new residence permits to TCNs (Eurostat 2014). This thus reflects country specific preferences <lb/>that, together with the current crisis, high unemployment and a range of other factors, speak to the fact that <lb/>as long as enough member states feel they have more to gain from staying in control of ELM, they will <lb/>only allow for so much common EU policy and legislation. <lb/></body>

			<body>68. <lb/>While this should be quite straightforward and while the Commission seems to concede the <lb/>reality of political obstacles, the bigger demographic-economic picture should still, according to the <lb/>Commission, trump political differences and have governments come to their senses and embrace ELM for <lb/>what it truly is: an economic survival strategy for the EU. This differs from how the Commission reasoned <lb/>15 years ago, when ELM was considered as just one important component in a broader policy mix to offset <lb/>future demographic imbalances. Today, however, ELM is increasingly put forth as the primary remedy for <lb/>the projected demographic decline. And as with all technocratic solutions or rationales also this one tends <lb/>to relegate uncertainties, opposition and reservations to the realm of irrationality and false consciousness. <lb/>The problem is though, that short of a full-fledged technocracy things such as demographic projections will <lb/>not be able to dictate policy, but rather have to coexist and compete with a multitude of other interest-<lb/>mediated projections and policy options. What can be fairly certain though, is that a failure to orchestrate a <lb/>large-scale ELM to the EU over the next 10–50 years will not necessarily spell catastrophe. To argue as <lb/>such would be to underestimate socio-political inventiveness, technological advances and human agency; <lb/>and it would also be to grossly overestimate the predictive power of demographic data. A host of <lb/>unforeseen events and dislocations always tend to modify and sometimes upset the particular future course <lb/>that seemed most likely at the outset. <lb/>69. <lb/>The current crises in the EU can be seen as such unforeseen dislocations that few predicted; and <lb/>it has also transformed migration policies and migration patterns (some of them quite dramatic) in ways <lb/>few could have imagined prior to the crisis. Although the EU&apos;s current refugee crisis falls outside the scope <lb/>of this paper, it is should be mentioned that it has had a significant demographic impact in some member <lb/>states, most notably in Germany and Sweden, where it has also impacted positively on economic growth. <lb/>In addition, it has of course also ignited policy discussions over how refugees could help resolve current <lb/>and future labour shortages in the light of a declining working age population (see e.g. Hansen 2016; IMF <lb/>2016; OECD 2015; Statistics Sweden 2016). <lb/>70. <lb/>Conversely, as of 2012, eleven member states, all of them severely affected by the economic <lb/>crisis, suffered from net emigration (Eurostat 2013a; 2013b). According to the EU&apos;s most recent &apos;Ageing <lb/>Report&apos; from 2015, this number has now risen to thirteen, a striking development given that some of these <lb/>countries were solid immigration countries before the crisis and expected to remain as such for the decades <lb/>to come. Meanwhile, some member states that have weathered the crisis better have experienced a <lb/>significant increase in labour immigration (e.g. Germany), much of it originating from other EU <lb/>countries. 29 <lb/></body>

			<note place="footnote">29 <lb/>With such crisis-induced migration from poorer to richer member states, the EU&apos;s migration debate is now <lb/>not only targeting external migration and third country migrants but has increasingly come to target also <lb/>the (free) movement of EU citizens themselves. More and more, then, a formerly commended free <lb/>movement of EU citizens is being recast as a detrimental immigration of the poor, unemployed and, as <lb/>some disparagingly calls it, welfare tourists. Accordingly, many EU members at the centre are now calling <lb/>for restrictions on free movement from the peripheral members, requesting, above all, a curtailment of the <lb/>social provisions that until now have formed an integral part of the EU&apos;s free movement regime. In the <lb/>summer of 2013, for instance, Austria, Britain, Germany and the Netherlands wrote a joint letter to the <lb/>Irish presidency, the Commission and the other member states, calling for the system be overhauled, <lb/>emphasising that &apos;the right of EU citizens to freedom of movement is not unconditional&apos;, and also <lb/>requesting that &apos;[a]ll necessary measures need to be taken to deal with the consequences of this type of <lb/>immigration and to fight its causes&apos;, including &apos;legal as well as financial measures.&apos; (Letter to Mr Alan <lb/>Shatter, President of the European Council for Justice and Home Affairs 2013). Given that this could <lb/>jeopardize a long-standing regime that the Commission deems absolutely central not only for labour <lb/>mobility but also for the EU project as such, it has caused a great deal of concern within the Commission <lb/>and elsewhere. Indeed, since the letter dispute the situation has deteriorated further and the issue of free <lb/>movement (or &apos;EU migration&apos;) has now become so contentious that Britain&apos;s membership in the EU (now <lb/>the subject of a referendum in June 2016) may very well come to hinge on it. <lb/></note>

			<body>71. <lb/>Since emigration may provide short-term fiscal relief—as the population eligible for social and <lb/>unemployment benefits decreases—some governments obviously cannot afford the luxury of worrying too <lb/>much about it. But from the Commission&apos;s perspective this should be a very worrisome development, <lb/>spelling a worsening demographic decline in many member states while also accelerating demographic and <lb/>labour imbalances in the Union as a whole, imbalances that may be very hard to reverse given that they <lb/>mirror and are caused by the overall macroeconomic imbalances in the EU. The tendency, discerned in <lb/>some member states, where many young unemployed, and often skilled, also emigrate to non-EU countries <lb/>as a result of the crisis should be a cause of concern too. As with third country nationals leaving the EU <lb/>due to the crisis, it deprives the Union of both skilled labour and working age people and thus belies the <lb/>central objectives of the Commission&apos;s labour migration policy. <lb/>72. <lb/>In the wake of the crisis, several EU governments&apos; anti-immigration measures and rhetoric also <lb/>run counter to the Commission&apos;s line of policy. Such measures include steps to either stop completely or <lb/>curtail regular labour migration, further tightening of family migration, as well as social benefits and <lb/>access to residence permits and some governments have sought to make unemployed migrants on <lb/>temporary permits leave their countries. <lb/>73. <lb/>This is yet another great obstacle to the Commission&apos;s ELM objectives, one that may explain <lb/>why member states do not put priority of increasing and harmonizing ELM at this point in time. Yet, the <lb/>crisis has not modified the Commission&apos;s stance. If anything it has rather served to reinforce the <lb/>technocratic rationale further, or as argued by the Commission in its &apos;3rd Annual Report on Immigration <lb/>and Asylum&apos;: <lb/>At first sight, the EU&apos;s current economic challenges might make it difficult to understand the <lb/>necessity for legal migration and mobility channels. But it is necessary to bear in mind that, even with <lb/>the overall EU unemployment rate of around 10%, equating to 23.8 million citizens, and increasing to <lb/>22.1% for youths (under 25), many Member States are already experiencing labour and skills <lb/>shortages in different sectors and for varying reasons. […] Economic migration thus remains an <lb/>important component part of efforts to address the challenges of labour shortages, notably in the <lb/>context of the EU&apos;s ageing population and an increasingly competitive international market for talent, <lb/>with other countries outside Europe also experiencing skills shortages. (EC 2012b: 4; see also <lb/>Malmström 2012) <lb/>74. <lb/>When the Commission states that it &apos;might make it difficult to understand the necessity for legal <lb/>migration&apos; this illustrates quite well the conflict between a technocratic approach, drawing on seemingly <lb/>irrefutable facts about future problems and the necessary measures needed to resolve them, on the one side, <lb/>and a political approach, drawing on expedient political calculations, public opinion and constraints <lb/>imposed by the current political, economic and ideological leanings and realities on the ground. <lb/>75. <lb/>It is no wild guess to assume that this conflict will continue to pervade EU policy on ELM. <lb/>Judging from the European Council meeting in June 2014 and its &apos;strategic guidelines for legislative and <lb/>operational planning for the coming years within the area of freedom, security and justice&apos; there are no <lb/>signs that the member states are ready to reconsider and allow for more EU influence over ELM (European <lb/>Council 2014). As for the Commission, however, its recent announcements may indicate a change of <lb/>course. Instead of new legislative initiatives the Commission has clarified that the focus from now on <lb/>should be on ensuring implementation and consolidation of existing legislation and frameworks (EC <lb/>2014e). Many of the directives relating to ELM have just recently been transposed and some are still <lb/>pending transposition. In this sense their real impact have not been tested yet. Instead of asking for the <lb/>moon, then, the Commission&apos;s latest strategy may therefore be to focus its energies on making the most of <lb/>what it has already managed to achieve. <lb/></body>
