These acts empower<lb/> the MEI to lead the EI process by initiating and driving the planning process (including Instrument for<lb/> Pre-Accession [IPA] resources); monitoring the implementation activities (including the quality of<lb/> harmonisation of the acquis); and reporting on the progress made.

The legislative tasks and commitments for developing strategies are<lb/> summarised annually in separate annexes to the work plan. The GAWP includes a prioritisation<lb/> mechanism consisting of two sections: section A concentrates on activities needed for the<lb/> implementation of the strategic priorities, and section B encompasses all activities of ministries.<lb/> Regulations define mechanisms for ensuring coherence among central planning documents. Every item<lb/> foreseen under the GAWP has to make reference to other planning documents, such as the Government<lb/> Statement of Priorities, the Action Plan for the Implementation of the Economic Vision and the MTEF.<lb/> The RoP are in place to link policy planning with annual and medium-term financial planning, although<lb/> they are implemented with varying degrees of success, mainly through the strategic objectives. 7<lb/> However, there are also requirements to link the GAWP to budget decisions and to include projected<lb/> costs. In addition, the RoP specify the responsibility of ministries to provide the calculation of public<lb/> revenues and expenditures for new initiatives. Fundamental to this is the requirement that the MoF<lb/> reviews and approves the fiscal analysis 8 .<lb/> Requirements exist for linking the GAWP with the EI process. The guidelines on the preparation of the<lb/> GAWP foresee a &apos;reference to EPAP/APSAA.&apos; Moreover, Article 48 of the RoP expects the GCS of the<lb/> OPM to co-ordinate the preparation of the GAWP with the MEI.<lb/> The RoP of the Government obliges the SPO and the GCS to issue general guidelines to enable better<lb/> planning and more detailed guidance of the methodology for the GAWP, including strategies and a<lb/> legislative programme 9 .

            <table>Statement of Priorities and its application in the MTEF and GAWP<lb/> development processes was a challenge for the SPO of the OPM in 2012, mainly due to vacant positions.<lb/> The SPO was strengthened in 2013 with two additional staff. The process of developing the Statement of<lb/> Priorities has been changed in order to move from macro-level priorities to sectoral-level priorities and<lb/> to link priorities with the development of sectoral strategies and medium-term budgetary ceilings. The<lb/> stated efforts are steps in the right direction and will strengthen the priority-setting and implementation<lb/> capacities of the Government, including in the SAA process, and enable the more efficient use of scarce<lb/> resources. Analysis of the coherence of key strategic documents – the MTEF and the GAWP –<lb/> demonstrates that the situation improved in 2012, with both documents approved for the year 2013 and<lb/> beyond being more coherent compared with the documents adopted in the previous year. Their<lb/> structure and priority objectives follow the structure of the Programme of the Government and are<lb/> largely consistent.<lb/> However, in 2013, when developing the Declaration of Priorities 2014-2016 and MTEF for the same<lb/> period, co-operation of the OPM with the MoF deteriorated. Commitment of the MoF to contribute to<lb/> the development of the priorities to ensure alignment with the financial opportunities of the<lb/> Government remains a challenge. The SPO of the OPM and the MoF are still applying a somewhat<lb/> different approach to the Government priorities, leading to a modified version of priorities in the MTEF<lb/> 22<lb/> The GCS evaluates the quarterly reports on the following three criteria: 1) quality of reporting; 2) meeting of<lb/> implementation deadline; 3) level of implementation.<lb/> 23<lb/> A list of strategic documents in force is provided by the SPO of the OPM; concrete numbers are derived from<lb/> expert analysis of the stated list. compared with the Declaration of Priorities prepared by the SPO and approved by the Government. As<lb/> the guardian of financial resources, the MoF must accommodate the Government priorities within the<lb/> funding opportunities of the state, a consideration which is not fully taken into account during the<lb/> development of the priorities statement. Better co-operation is therefore needed between the MoF and<lb/> the OPM, and mechanisms need to be built into the planning process to frame the prioritisation exercise<lb/> within short and medium-term funding opportunities.</table>

            <figDesc>The MEI employed in 2013 four to five lawyers, and although the anticipated number of staff members is<lb/> seven, this will still not be enough to cope with the workload. It is also clear that the real expertise of the<lb/> sectoral acquis should be developed within the ministries. The MEI should focus not only on the<lb/> approximation of the text of law itself but also more on possible problems regarding delivery of the aims<lb/> of the acquis. As the EU itself will increasingly emphasise the need to achieve actual and measurable<lb/> progress in different policy fields (on commitments made by Kosovo), in order to proceed with the EI<lb/> process the MEI could also replicate this in national planning by putting more emphasis in the planning documents on achieving measurable progress of real outcomes on the ground.

This<lb/> practice could be developed further by enhancing the MEI&apos;s capacity to lead this shift and provide<lb/> feedback to guide ministries should be planned.<lb/> In this respect, the decision of MEI to nominate members of its staff in relevant departments as<lb/> contact-points for each ministry, to serve as focal points for co-ordination activities between MEI and the<lb/> ministry, merits approval. The Government should focus in the coming years on strengthening the<lb/> capacities in the central co-ordination bodies (OMP, MEI, MoF).<lb/> 35<lb/> The booklet entited &quot; MTI priorities of 2013 &quot; not only sets desired qualitative aims and outcomes but also<lb/> tries to budget for and co-ordinate the use of different aid programmes for different tasks.</figDesc>

            <head>MTI<lb/> MAFRD Analysing the allocation of positions in the Ministry of Local Government Administration 44 confirms these<lb/> conclusions. 31% of positions (41 in total) were allocated to policy development departments.

There are also two main<lb/> General Departments – for Legal and Procedural Issues and for Administration – and nine departments<lb/> that report to them. Most of these departments are further divided into units. The organisational set-up<lb/> and associated job descriptions are based on acts of the Presidency. The current structure, with two<lb/> General Departments and nine departments is of recent origin. It was devised in the spring of 2012 and<lb/> became fully functional in the autumn of that year, and was accompanied by a rise in the number of<lb/> Draft laws processed<lb/> Draft laws adopted<lb/> Draft laws returned for<lb/> redrafting<lb/> 2011<lb/> 94<lb/> 65<lb/> 2<lb/> 2012<lb/> 92<lb/> 69<lb/> 7<lb/> 0<lb/> 10<lb/> 20<lb/> 30<lb/> 40<lb/> 50<lb/> 60<lb/> 70<lb/> 80<lb/> 90<lb/> 100 positions of director in the administration. Participants in this process of organisational reform mention<lb/> several reasons for the growth in the number of departments: the desire to establish better direct<lb/> communication between the Secretary-General and staff, and the aim of improving responsibility in the<lb/> administration by increasing the number of managerial positions.<lb/> It is worth considering the allocation of staff across different functions. At present, the General<lb/> Department for Legal and Procedural Issues, with its four Departments for Plenary and Procedural Issues,<lb/> Parliamentary Committees, Standardisation and Legislative Harmonisation, and Research, Archive and<lb/> Library, employs merely a third of the overall Assembly staff. This means that direct support for the core<lb/> bodies and functions of the Assembly takes up a third of personnel capacity, whilst more indirect<lb/> &quot; backroom &quot; functions, such as procurement, IT, internal administration (budget and personnel),<lb/> transport, mail and supplies take up the remainder of resources. Considering the heavy emphasis on<lb/> legislative and oversight and control activities at the level of committees and working groups, the<lb/> number of officials servicing committees and working groups, 36 at present, is small.</table>
