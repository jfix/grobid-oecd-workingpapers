of the European Commission and the OECD's Directorate for Employment, Labour and Social Affairs on 
 " Review of Labour Migration Policy in Europe " . This document has been produced with the financial assistance of the European Union. The views 
expressed herein can in no way be taken to reflect the official opinion of the European Union. Grant: HOME/2013/EIFX/CA/002 / 30-CE-0615920/00-38 (DI130895) A previous version of this paper was presented and discussed at the OECD Working Party on 
Migration in June 2015.The paper investigates the preferences and post-graduation mobility behaviour of 
international students, focusing on how the EU could succeed in attracting and keeping highly educated 
talent from across the globe. Providing their skills to European labour markets, graduates from outside the 
EU have a potential to enrich the supply of high-skilled labour. Seen as the 28 EU countries still constitute 
the most attractive destination area for studying abroad, the paper examines different calculation methods 
in order to generate stay rates for over 170 countries of origin. Empirical results indicate that for the EU as a whole, aggregate stay rates from stayers from all non-
EU source countries lie within a range of 16.4% and 29.1%. They are also typically very low among 
students from other OECD countries, and much higher for students from less developed or politically less 
stable countries. The paper concludes by recommending a catalogue of measures to boost the EU's 
attractiveness, and to increase stay rates. Proposed policy measures draw on a smooth labour market 
integration of international graduates, as well as on cultivating strong points of the European countries, 
such as: political stability and participation possibilities, reliable institutions and governance structure, as 
well as an innovative and competitive environment.

BEHAVIOUR: AN ANALYSIS OF DETERMINANTS OF STUDENT MOBILITY 
AND RETENTION RATES IN THE EU 1 INTRODUCTION -ON THE IMPORTANCE OF ATTRACTING AND KEEPING TALENT 1. 
European economies have always been subject to change over time. Some changes were of a 
short-term nature and occurred as negative shocks, sending economies into recession. Other changes 
manifested themselves as medium-or long-term trends. An important evolution, belonging to the second 
category, is the increasing importance of knowledge-based processes in all developed economies. The 
input factor 'knowledge', human capital, contributes more and more to productivity in European 
economies. 2. 
Although EU member states experienced rather heterogeneous economic development since the 
early 2000s, there remains one striking similarity: the relative share of tertiary educated individuals 
employed in science and technology surged between 2002 and 2012. This development is primarily driven 
by a rising absolute number of highly skilled individuals in these occupations. Consequently, European 
economies now rely more than ever on the supply of high skilled labour. Figure 1. Tertiary educated employees in science and technology as percentage of the total active 
population, 2012 and 2002. Source: Eurostat, own representation Note: 
EU 27 refers to all current members but Croatia. 1 Footnote by Turkey: The information in this document with reference to «Cyprus» relates to the southern part of the Island.

preserve its position concerning the  " Cyprus issue " . Footnote by all the European Union Member States of the OECD and the European Union: The Republic of Cyprus is recognized 
by all members of the United Nations with the exception of Turkey. The information in this document relates to the area under the 
effective control of the Government of the Republic of Cyprus. "  DELSA/ELSA/WD/SEM(2016)12 8 3. 
This dependence is likely to increase further as the evolution of knowledge-based economies 
proceeds. To meet this rising demand, and to foster innovativeness, EU economies have to invest in the 
formation of human capital -the 'brains' of the future labour force. 4. 
Demographic constraints however, already looming at the horizon, will limit the maximal 
possible supply of 'brains' the EU will be able to generate, even with increases in the share of youth who 
are tertiary-educated. To ensure that knowledge-fuelled EU economies will not suffer a fuel shortage in the 
near future, some short-acting measures might be required.  " I not only use all the brains that I have, but all that I can borrow. "  Woodrow T. Wilson, 28 th president of the USA, 1856-1924 5. 
In this spirit, attracting third country workers to the EU is one potential approach. But what if 
these migration streams are too small, or there still remains a qualification mismatch? To prevent this 
issue, initiatives have been launched, such as the EU Blue Card, designed specifically to attract high-
skilled labour. However, resulting inflows might still be insufficient. 6. 
Recent trends, i.e. the jump in the number of asylum seekers from 261 thousand in 2010 to 628 
thousand 
in 
2014 2 , indicate that actual inflows into the EU could mitigate the demographic constraint, depending on whether 
the majority of these migrants stay temporarily or permanently. In any case, the distribution of these new 
immigrants across European member states is not proportional to their labour market size. At the same 
time, educational background and occupational skill sets of these new arrivals, already acquired abroad, are 
heterogeneous. 7. 
Aside from workers who completed education and vocational training abroad there is another 
group of temporary migrants, namely international students. Their number reached in 2012 an all-time high 
of almost 1.5 million enrolled students 3 , indicating that the EU remains one of the main destinations for 
studying abroad (see Figure A. 1in the appendix). 8. 
In 2012, 500 thousand of the 1.46 million of international students in the EU were students 
from another EU country. Hence, almost two-thirds of all international students in the EU came from 
countries outside the EU -they constitute potentially a substantial pool of well-educated and highly-skilled 
future workers. Beyond their formal qualifications they also acquired additional cultural and social capital 
as well as language skills during their years of study in the EU. All these aspects speak in favour of a 
smooth integration into an EU labour market. Moreover, by their initial choice of studying in the EU they 
already demonstrated that the EU has a certain appeal on them. 9. 
Whereas all major destinations hosted in 2012 distinctly more internationally mobile students 
than five years ago, the three major destinations attracted slightly smaller shares (Figure 2). Compared to 
2007, students gravitated more frequently towards the Russian Federation and China. A noteworthy shift in 2 Figures are rounded, extracted from Eurostat tables on 'Asylum and Managed Migration'. 3 Total stock numbers (3.85 million in 2012, 2.83 million in 2007) are below the figures reported in OECD 
(2013). This is related to the underlying statistical concept – here international students, in case of OECD 
(2013) foreign students. DELSA/ELSA/WD/SEM(2016)12 9 relative enrolment figures occurred also in favour of other economies in South East Asia, namely the 
Republic of Korea, Malaysia or Thailand. Figure 2. Relative attractiveness expressed as Top-10 destination shares Source: UNESCO Institute for Statistics, education database; own calculations and representation Note:

In an increasingly interconnected and globalised world, students in tertiary education face a 
growing number of potentially attractive destinations to study abroad. One of the essential questions in the 
decades to come is how the EU could manage to remain among the top destinations for international 
students in a world increasingly competing for highly-skilled labour. Another central question in this 
context was how to turn effectively the potential of international students into real gains from an EU 
perspective? Alternatively, referring to the above-noted quotation, one could ask how many brains could 
be borrowed, under which circumstances and how to proceed to retain these talents for a longer time? 
These questions constitute the main research questions guiding this report and defining its structure. 11. 
In order to highlight students' initial preferences, and a possible interconnectedness with 
subsequent staying behaviour, chapter 2 provides an overview over the distribution of internationally 
mobile students in the EU. The descriptive analysis sheds light on absolute numbers, as well as relative 
numbers in relation to total enrolment. Internationally mobile students' preferences are presented based on 
country (or region) of origin, sex, as well as level and field of study. Aside from a status quo assessment in 
the year 2012, some changes over time are highlighted as well. 12. 
Chapter 3 is dedicated to the introduction of a measure for international students' staying 
behaviour – the so-called 'stay rate'. Main findings from the literature are synthesised, including both 
academic and administrative reports. A meta-study on internationally mobile academics served as starting 
point for the exploratory study, presented in the extended version of this paper (Weisser, 2015a). This 
methodological paper focuses on the derivation of suitable statistics and a detailed empirical assessment of 
staying patterns of internationally mobile students in the EU and its member countries, eventually 
indicating 'plausibility bands' for stay rates on the EU level. The main findings, together with a short 
discussion of related core issue, will be briefly summarised in chapter 4.1 of this report. DELSA/ELSA/WD/SEM(2016)12 10 13. 
Yet, the exploratory study's summary is not to be seen as an end in itself, but rather as 
foundation for an examination of determinants of staying behaviour in two alternative econometric 
frameworks in the remainder of chapter 4. This empirical evaluation is followed by an analysis of potential 
labour market and fiscal consequences and a discussion of implications of changing staying behaviour in 
chapter 5. Based on the previously conducted empirical analyses, chapter 6 deduces some policy 
recommendations. The concluding chapter 7 provides a summary of all previous chapters' essential 
findings. 2 DISTRIBUTION OF INTERNATIONALLY MOBILE STUDENTS IN THE EU 14. 
From an a priori point of view, the attractiveness of the EU Higher Education Area 4 could be 
one of the most crucial determinants of post-graduation staying behaviour. Only those graduates who chose 
studying in the European Union in the first place can then in a subsequent decision opt for a prolonged stay 
and entry into the European labour market. Consequently, it is not only important to understand what 
makes students staying in a host country after graduation, but also why they came in the beginning, from 
where they originated and which destinations they have chosen. 15. 
The decision to study abroad, being part of individual investment in human capital, depends not 
only on intrinsic motivation but also on the educational landscape in the country of origin. 16. 
Figure 3 shows how 'outbound mobility ratios' vary across countries. This measure indicates 
how many students study abroad in relation to all students enrolled in the respective country of origin. In 
roughly 50 percent of all countries, this ratio is at least five percent. Especially smaller economies, with 
smaller tertiary educational sectors often display an outbound ratio of more than 10 percent. Figure 3. Outbound mobility ratio in 2012, by country of origin Source: UNESCO Institute for Statistics, education database; own calculations and representation Note: 
Outbound mobility ratio defined as 'Number of students from a given country studying abroad, expressed as a percentage of 
total tertiary enrolment in that country'. 4 In the context of this report, the term 'EU Higher Education Area' shall refer to the EU member states' 
tertiary education sectors in a geographic dimension. This area is part of the official 'European Higher 
Education Area', launched in March 2010 (http://www.ehea.info/). The European Higher Education Area 
also includes non-EU countries. DELSA/ELSA/WD/SEM(2016)12 11 17. 
Switching the perspective to the EU as a major destination region, Figure 4 displays the 
percentage changes regarding the number of internationally mobile students 5 enrolled between 2002 and 
2012 by country of origin. Though on average, the EU hosted more internationally mobile students than 
ever, the emerging picture points to a somehow heterogeneous trend. Whilst the number of internationally 
mobile students originating from some countries, for example China and India, more than tripled, other 
countries of origin sent in 2012 distinctly fewer students than one decade ago. 18. 
What are the reasons for these mixed developments -are they related to changing host or source 
country conditions? Did changing students' preferences or the structure of the tertiary educational system 
contribute to such a pattern? Figure 4. Source countries of internationally mobile students from non-EU countries, percentage change 
2002-2012 Source: UNESCO Institute for Statistics, education database; own calculations and representation 19. 
Referring to credit or degree mobility 6 , literature provides some guidance, for instance 
regarding those general factors affecting students' decision for studying abroad at all, and then, also with 
respect to their preferred destination country. 5 The group of internationally mobile students comprises 'international' and 'foreign' students. International 
students are those students who crossed a border for studying in a specific destination country whilst their 
usual domicile is abroad (resident concept). Foreign students are those students who do not hold the 
citizenship of the respective country they are studying in (national concept). The first concept depicts 
actual international student mobility in a precise way, but as some countries do only provide information 
on foreign students, the second category cannot be neglected. Subsequent chapters will differentiate 
between these two concepts whilst also commenting on the impact regarding outcomes. 6 Credit mobility refers to short-to medium-duration study spells abroad, typically one or two semesters, 
whilst staying enrolled at a university in the country of origin. Acquired credits from abroad, for instance 
ECTS in the European context, are then allowed for the domestic degree. In contrast to this, degree 
mobility refers to those internationally mobile students who enrol for a complete programme abroad, hence 
obtain their degree abroad. This type of mobility will be at the centre of this work. DELSA/ELSA/WD/SEM(2016)12 12 2.1 Literature review on determinants of cross-border student mobility 20. 
Aside from mere intrinsic motives, e.g. acquiring additional human capital, externally set 
incentives seem able to foster student mobility as well. Within their analysis of any impact of studying 
abroad on graduates' propensity to start their career abroad, Oosterbeek and Webbink (2009) along with 
Parey and Waldinger (2011) demonstrated that grants to high-achieving students or the availability of 
Erasmus funding schemes increase the likelihood of going abroad during studies significantly. Scrutinizing 
the mobility of ERASMUS-participants, Rodríguez González et al. (2011) focused on host country features 
which possibly serve as pull-factors for intra-European student flows. Using a gravity model, they showed 
that flows are positively affected by size of the host country and the share of the highly educated in the 
country of origin. Quality of receiving institutions and the spoken language in the host country are also 
relevant flow determinants 7 . Typically for findings in the migration context, distance between source and 
destination country dampens flows, even in case of intra-European student mobility. Findings of Caruso 
and de Wit (2013) supported the relevance of a host countries economic performance, regarding integration 
and overall performance, in the context of intra-European student flows. Beyond that, educational spending 
and higher levels of safety are positively associated with a host country's attractiveness. 21. 
Following a human capital approach, Perkins and Neumayer (2013) analysed degree mobility 
for a large set of source and destination countries, whilst accounting for distinct socio-political and 
economic features. They also supported findings of Findlay et al. (2012) who stressed acquisition of social 
and cultural capital to be one of the driving forces behind the decision to study abroad. At the same time 
both author groups acknowledged that cross-border student mobility should not be seen as an isolated 
event, but a decision in light of individual career plans. Perkins and Neumayer (2013) presented evidence 
that enrolment abroad is positively influenced by the income level in the host country -an indication for 
better labour market perspectives in a host country and thus possibly increasing benefits of studying 
abroad. Additionally, network effects have been identified, implying that costs of mobility could be 
mitigated by the presence of fellow nationals which could provide information and support. Sharing a 
language, which facilitates studying and daily life likewise, seems to affect the decision to study abroad 
positively as well. Distance, implying higher travel costs, and larger income gaps between sending and 
receiving countries impose both non-negligible impeding factors in a monetary sense. Both effects are 
larger in the case of least developed countries, compared to newly industrialised countries 8 . Institutional 
quality matters primarily for international students from newly industrialised economies whereas higher 
income levels increase host countries attractiveness to a larger extent for students originating from least 
developed countries. 22. 
The relative importance of higher educational sector's features is also emphasised by Van 
Bouwel and Veugelers (2010) in an analysis of 18 European countries: a larger student base, better ranking 
positions of universities 9 , tuition fees 10 and especially higher funding per student boost the numbers of 
incoming students. Using data on 13 OECD countries, Beine et al. (2014) confirmed the afore-mentioned 
major results concerning quality and tuition fee, whilst highlighting the signalling effect of tuition fees. 
They also identified a positive network effect, pointing to the relevance of past migration streams. Once 
again, geographical and linguistic proximity have been shown to influence flows positively. 7 i.e. if the spoken official language in the destination country is English, French, German, Italian or Spanish 
, inward flows are higher 8 Both groupings follow the World Bank's classification in 2010. 9 This may also reflect ranking according to the number of foreign students enrolled. 10 Although perhaps counterintuitive at first glance, tuition fees could be perceived as a sign of quality of a 
host country's universities, thus attracting more students. DELSA/ELSA/WD/SEM(2016)12 13 23. 
Thissen and Ederveen (2006) focused more on labour market aspects in their evaluation of 
possible determinants of enrolment of foreign students in EEA-countries: they concluded that higher 
income levels and lower unemployment rates substantially foster inflows of foreign students. 24. 
This short literature review provides some important information on main determinants of 
cross-border student flows: institutional quality, distance, and economic conditions matter. If a host 
country's tertiary educational system is perceived to be of high quality, more international students chose 
this country as a destination. Geographically closer host countries or those with higher degrees of 
proximity in a cultural or linguistic sense are favoured too. In addition, internationally mobile students 
seem to be influenced by economic perspectives in a potential host country, accordingly to their individual 
career plans. Studying abroad is not merely an 'adventure', but a deliberate choice right from the start. 25. 
To provide an empirical examination of international students' location choices, the following 
chapter will present the distribution of international and foreign students within the EU Higher Education 
Area. A special focus rests on source countries, as well on degree types and fields of study. 2.2 Source and destination countries 26. 
Chapter 2.2 is dedicated to a detailed examination of the distribution of international students 
within destination countries in the European Union, in terms of main countries and regions of origin. Such 
an approach allows illustrating a host country's attractiveness for students from a specific geographical 
area as well as from a political or economic entity. The results are of a descriptive nature, displaying four 
types of cross-border student mobility:  intra-European mobility 
 students from EFTA countries 
 inbound mobility from OECD countries (net EU countries) 
 mobility of students from other countries (equal to worldwide net EU, EFTA and OECD countries, 
subsequently also referred to as 'third countries' or 'other countries') The data is taken from the UNESCO Institute for Statistics database and covers the years 2007 to 2012, 
with a maximum number of 218 possible countries of origin 11 . 11 This number includes seven geographical residual categories for students with 'unknown' source countries, 
one within each of the larger geographical units (Africa, Asia, Caribbean and Central America, Europe, 
North America, South America, and Oceania). DELSA/ELSA/WD/SEM(2016)12 14 Figure 5. Origins and absolute numbers of incoming non-EU students studying in the EU, 2012 Source: UNESCO Institute for Statistics, education database; own calculations and representation 27. 
Due to the fact that host countries' population size, and thus also the size of the higher 
education system varies considerably, the remainder of this section is divided into two parts. The first part 
presents absolute enrolment figures of internationally mobile students to assess the relative attractiveness 
of destination countries based on raw numbers. Absorptive capacity of a host country's tertiary educational 
system is accounted for in the second part, by adjusting these numbers by the size of the respective HE 
system. For each EU host country the value from 2012, if available, and a five year change rate of the 
corresponding indicator will be reported. Figure 6. Shares of outgoing students with EU as destination, 2012 Source: UNESCO Institute for Statistics, education database; own calculations and representation A first impression regarding the attractiveness of the EU Higher Education Area can be obtained from 
Figure 6. Though Chinese students are the largest group of international students in the EU in absolute 
numbers (see Figure 5), their overall preference for studying in the EU is relatively small: only 23 percent 
of all Chinese students studying abroad came to the EU in 2012. In case of another newly industrialising 
country, i.e. Brazil, students favour the EU clearly – 58 percent chose an EU member state as destination 
for their studies abroad. DELSA/ELSA/WD/SEM(2016)12 15 2.2.1 Absolute numbers of international students in EU host countries 28. 
Europe offers a large selection of possible destination countries, all providing a rich variety of 
structured programmes in tertiary education. Though the Bologna process contributed substantially to a 
harmonization of tertiary education, there still remain distinct features of each potential destination 
country: the spoken language in daily life, the main language used in courses at HE institutions, cultural 
peculiarities and economic conditions. 29. 
As highlighted in the literature review, these distinct features can be expected to affect the 
choices of international students regarding the preferred host country during their studies. Table 1 presents 
an overview for 2012 of absolute figures for internationally mobile students enrolled in the current 28 
member states of the European Union, by source regions. 30. 
Unsurprisingly, the largest number of incoming students (426875) was in 2012 enrolled at a 
university in the UK. France and Germany attracted the second (256261) and third highest number 
(191734) of international students. This picture corresponds to a large extent to the size of a destination 
countries' tertiary educational sector. Other leading destinations were Italy, Austria, Spain and the 
Netherlands which attracted in 2012 between 55000 and 77000 internationally mobile students. With a 
total number of 39128 enrolled international students, the Czech Republic was the leading destination 
country in Central-Eastern Europe in 2012. DELSA/ELSA/WD/SEM(2016)12 16 Table 1. Internationally mobile students, by host country and region of origin, 2012 Host country EU

Asia, Caribbean and Central America, Europe, North America, South America, and Oceania) 31. 
The ranking of countries is different when enrolment of EU students is compared with that of 
non-EU students. More than two thirds of internationally mobile students originate from another EU 
country in the case of Slovakia, Luxemburg, Austria, the Netherlands and the Czech Republic. In 12 
member states, no more than one out of three international students originates from another EU-country -
this includes the five most populated EU countries. Intra-European student mobility is thus more important 
in smaller countries. 32. 
Students from third countries (other countries of origin, not members of EU, EFTA or OECD) 
constitute the largest share in Lithuania. However, this is due to its direct neighbour Belarus, which 
accounts for almost 40 percent of enrolled students from third countries. The highest absolute numbers of 
inbound students from other countries are hosted in the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy and 
Spain. Seemingly, most populated countries respectively larger economies attracted most students from 
third countries. Within this group of five countries, France has with 73.4 percent the largest share of third 
country students, and Germany with 44.2 percent the lowest. 33. 
Table A. 1 (in the appendix) shows the Top Five of source countries for each EU member state, 
excluding other EU or EFTA countries. In 11 out of 15 old (pre-2004) EU member states, Chinese students DELSA/ELSA/WD/SEM(2016)12 17 constitute the largest or second largest group of international students from outside the EU or EFTA. This 
source country's relevance could be interpreted not only as reflecting the massive number of young 
Chinese, but also as an outcome of the new global geographies: Since there occurs a shift of multi-national 
corporations' R&D expenditures towards China as one new geographic focus (Bruche, 2009, p. 274), its 
economy will naturally display an increasing demand for highly qualified employees in R&D. And most 
likely, a substantial fraction of this increased demand initially will be met by hiring employees having 
received tertiary education abroad. 34. 
The Top Five also suggests the importance of geographical proximity and persistent 
implications of historical or colonial ties. Geographical proximity facilitates travel and the exchange of 
information. Furthermore, it implies often a certain degree of cultural similarity. All those factors might 
affect the costs of mobility in an advantageous way, either by decreasing uncertainty or by reducing 
monetary costs of student mobility. The impact of historical or former colonial ties appears not to be 
restricted to students, but is also found for immigration towards OECD or EU countries in general (see e.g., 
DeWaard et al., 2012; Ortega, 2009) and appears to be increasing for certain countries 12 (Hooghe et al., 
2008). 35. 
Historical or colonial ties could exert an effect on today's students' choices in a twofold way: 
first, there are often well established institutional co-operations or programmes between HE institutions or 
an ongoing thought exchange on a governmental or administrative level. These links can contribute to 
lowering uncertainty about what to expect abroad. This can be observed for the Eastern European countries 
having joined the EU in the 2004 enlargement: predominant other source countries are Russia or other 
former members of the onetime Eastern Bloc -even more than two decades after it ceased to exist. Second, 
colonial ties often imply a shared language, as for all of the Portuguese Top Five source countries. A 
common language in turn eases daily life and facilitates the learning process at university (Perkins and 
Neumayer, 2013). 36. 
Bringing these descriptive findings together highlights that population's composition of third 
country students in EU countries is partially history-dependent, and partially the result of an increasing 
economic and demographic weight of emerging economies. 37. 
Within a global market for higher education, the EU is the most important destination region: 
EU countries which were also OECD members attracted almost 31 percent of foreign students worldwide 
in 2011, followed by North America where 21 percent of all foreign students are enrolled in tertiary 
education (OECD, 2013, p. 306). Within the EU, especially the United Kingdom strongly increased its 
market share concerning tertiary education for foreign students within one decade. During the same period, 
the global number of students enrolled outside their country of citizenship increased from 2.1 million in 
2000 to 4.3 million in 2011 (OECD, 2013, p. 306). 38. 
This dramatic rise in the number of internationally mobile students can be observed in almost 
every single EU member state: since 2007, only Ireland and Croatia recorded a decline in the overall 
number of international students. The increase is to a large extent caused by rising intra-European mobility, 
but is bolstered by rising numbers of students from third countries. 12 Hooghe et al. (2008, p. 502) stated that  " [e]specially countries like Spain, Portugal, Italy, and France 
increasingly attract immigrants from their former colonies " , which points even to a persistent importance 
of colonial ties in the future. DELSA/ELSA/WD/SEM(2016)12 18 39. 
As Table 2 reveals, most EU countries 13 hosted higher number of internationally mobile 
students in 2012 than they did five years earlier. Amongst those countries, 13 recorded an even higher 
increase for third country student mobility compared with intra-European student mobility. Belgium, Spain 
and Lithuania have seen the number of internationally mobile students from third countries triple in five 
years. 40. 
In contrast to this development, Germany was the only major host country to experience a 
decline -of almost 12 percent -in students from non-OECD/EU/EFTA countries, although this may be a 
statistical artefact. 14 13 At the reference period 2007, two of those 28 countries have acceded to the European Union in this exact 
year (Bulgaria and Romania), and Croatia was not yet a member state. 14 the number of enrolled international students without clear information on country of origin rose to 17,000, 
possibly explaining this decline. DELSA/ELSA/WD/SEM(2016)12 19 Table 2. Percentage change of internationally mobile students between 2007 and2012 Country of study

While EU countries appear to be attractive destinations for a rising number of European and 
third country students, increases are not equally distributed. Host countries which had lower levels of 
student mobility in the past now display higher growth rates. The United Kingdom, however, not only 
maintained its top position but actually saw enrolment increase by one third between 2007 and 2012. 2.2.2 Inbound ratios – international student mobility from a relative point of view 42. 
Does the growing number of international students lead to a change in the composition of the 
total student body or does it merely reflect the expansion of the tertiary educational system? To answer 
this, the relative size of international student mobility compared to total enrolment in tertiary education in a 
respective host country is examined. 43. 
Table A. 2, as well as Figures 7 and 8, present the inbound ratios for the years 2007 and the 
most recent years for the 28 EU member states. This ratio is calculated for each of the source and host 
countries as DELSA/ELSA/WD/SEM(2016)12 20 í µí°¼í µí± í µí±í µí±,í µí±¡ = í µí°¼ í µí±í µí±,í µí±¡ í µí°¸íµí°¸í µí±,í µí±¡ (eq. 1) where í µí°¼ í µí±í µí±,í µí±¡ is the total number of students from region í µí± studying in country í µí± at a given year í µí±¡, and í µí°¸íµí°¸í µí±,í µí±¡ is 
total tertiary enrolment in the host country. The latter variable is the sum of domestic students and 
international students from all í µí°½ countries of origin í µí°¸íµí°¸í µí±,í µí±¡ = ∑ í µí°¼ í µí±í µí±,í µí±¡ í µí°½ 
í µí±=1 + í µí°· í µí±,í µí±¡ . 44. 
Figure 7 gives some indication regarding the changing importance of third country students by 
depicting the inbound ratios in the years 2007 and 2012 (or the most recent year available), by individual 
country of study. Figure 7. Inbound ratios for international students from non-EU countries, 2007 and 2012 Source: UNESCO Institute for Statistics, education database; own calculations Note: *

The majority of countries experienced a growing share of third country students. A number of 
countries have, however, seen declines: Austria, Ireland and Portugal, principally. In the case of Austria, 
the decrease is primarily attributable to a considerable drop of the enrolment of students from China as 
well as Bosnia and Herzegovina. For Ireland and Portugal, the disadvantageous economic developments in 
the analysed time horizon serve as likely explanations. 46. 
How successful was the European Union overall with respect to attracting international 
students? In relation to enrolment of domestic students a distinct answer can be given: Overall, the 
European Union saw an increase in the weighted 15 inbound ratio of third country students from 2.9 to 3.8 
percent (EU students: 1.9 to 2.4 percent). The average increase in third country student inbound ratio in the 
EU 28 is not driven by the rising enrolment of international students in the UK, but by a rather evenly 
spread increase in internationalisation across the EU. Excluding the UK from the average still yields an 
increase of 0.7 percentage points (instead of 0.9 percentage points) on the aggregate level. 15 The weighting procedure accounts for substantial differences in the size of the tertiary educational sectors 
of the examined countries. Each country-level inbound rate was weighted by the number of students 
enrolled in this specific county, í µí°¸íµí°¸í µí±,í µí±¡ . Germany and Luxembourg are not included as no corresponding 
figures for 2007 are available. DELSA/ELSA/WD/SEM(2016)12 21 47. 
Whilst an analysis of absolute numbers for all internationally mobile students previously 
(chapter 2.2.1) portrayed an unbalanced development, the overall trend relative to the size of their tertiary 
educational system is once again similar across countries, as indicated by Figure 8. 48. 
The inbound rate for all internationally mobile students in the EU rose from 2007 to 2012 by 
1.5 percentage points on average. Consequently, international students represent a larger share of the 
tertiary educational system within the European Union. Such findings give rise to the hypothesis that the 
absorptive capacity of HE institutions evolves in a comparable manner across EU member states. Figure 8. Inbound ratios for all internationally mobile students, 2007 and 2012 Source: UNESCO Institute for Statistics, education database; own calculations

most recent values from 2011 
** most recent values from 2010 49. 
Aside from Luxembourg (figures from 2010) with by far smallest tertiary educational system in 
the EU, Austria and Cyprus have the highest inbound rates referring to intra-EU mobility (see Table A. 2 
in the appendix). In the first case, a substantial number of German students, studying at universities in the 
neighbouring country in the South-East, inflates this value; in the latter case, the result is mainly driven by 
Greek students. Among large EU countries, only the United Kingdom has such a high share of EU students 
enrolled at its tertiary institutions. In 2012, the share of European students in total enrolment in France, 
Germany, Italy and Spain was lower than in Slovakia, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands and Denmark. 50. 
When third country students are considered, the picture changes: France experiences large 
inflows from Morocco, Tunisia and Algeria, pushing it into the Top three of destination countries. The fifth 
and sixth highest inbound ratios, referring to third country students, can be found for Finland and Sweden. 
Though these two countries rank relatively low as a destination for European students, they successfully 
attract students from third countries. For most Eastern European countries, in contrast, the shares of 
students from other countries are almost negligible. 51. 
From an aerial perspective, looking at the European Union as a whole, the share of international 
students enrolled increases. Universities across the EU become more diverse with respect to students' 
origins. This increase is in line with one of the major goals of Council Directive 2004/114/EC, namely 
 " [p]romoting the mobility of third-country nationals to the Community for the purpose of studies "  
(European Commission, 2004, p. 1). 52. 
Whilst previously described patterns provide credible evidence that the European Union is an 
increasingly attractive place for temporary studies it yet has to be determined whether the EU is also 
attractive to international graduates in a short-, medium-or long-run. DELSA/ELSA/WD/SEM(2016)12 22 2.3 Gender distributions of international students 53. 
Studying abroad is not only an important aspect from an educational point of view, enlarging 
the intellectual horizon and strengthening human capital. It offers also the opportunity for academic 
exchange, and to participation in cultural or daily life of the destination country. Yet, there might be an 
alternative aspect of participation which could provide valuable insights into the attractiveness of the EU 
Higher Education Area, namely women's participation in international tertiary education. While the data 
structure prevents conducting analyses on the source country level, it is possible to look at the time series 
from 2002. 54. 
Table A. 3 (in the appendix) contrasts inbound rates of male and female international students, 
giving information on the gender-specific share of international students in relation to the respective 
gender's enrolment numbers in a given country. For roughly 50 percent of the country-year observations 
the ratios are balanced. For the majority of other cases, the female inbound ratio is at least 20 percent larger 
or smaller than the corresponding male rate. Usually, the latter case prevails. 55. 
As the presented numbers are ratios, the gender difference is not to be interpreted at face value 
since its causes cannot be unambiguously determined. Gender differences within countries could emerge 
either from gender differences between inbound numbers or differences between gender-specific enrolment 
numbers, the latter primarily caused by domestic student enrolment. Hence, presented ratios for the three 
observation points in time should be interpreted with caution in a within-country context. 56. 
Despite this limitation, the ratios provided can be used to evaluate between-country differences 
with respect to attractiveness on international students of a given gender in a specific year. What can be 
derived is that for instance Austria draws more female international students than Denmark in relation to 
each countries female total enrolment numbers (15.3% vs. 7.3% in 2012). Countries with relatively fewer 
women than men include Bulgaria, Cyprus, Finland, Hungary, Romania and Sweden. DELSA/ELSA/WD/SEM(2016)12 23 Table 3. Absolute inbound numbers by gender for 2002, 2007 and 2012 2012

To address the question which countries are relatively more attractive for female international 
students, Table 3 presents gender specific enrolment figures 16 . Observable female/male enrolment ratios 
for internationally mobile students show that there might be some destination countries which are 
persistently preferred by one sex, compared to the other. Austria, Italy, the Netherlands and Spain display 
at all three reference points a larger number of female international students. 58. 
The overall picture shows varying relative participation of female international students across 
countries. But why are there substantial differences in internationally mobile students' preferences between 
the two sexes? 59. 
Two main mechanisms could be driving this outcome: First, one should remember that host 
countries display a heterogeneous composition of their international student body with regard to students' 
origins – some have a larger share of students from other EU member states, others a higher share from 
other continents (see Table 1 and Table 2). Aside from general socio-cultural differences between countries 
of origin and destination countries, distance could matter as well. 16 The underlying data source provides only aggregate figures and an inbound rate for female 
students, thus absolute figures for male and female enrolment of internationally mobile students 
have to be 'recovered'. DELSA/ELSA/WD/SEM(2016)12 24 60. 
Keeping the possibly mobility-deterring effect of distance in mind, there is evidence that 
willingness to migrate is associated to individual risk attitudes: less risk-averse individuals are more 
willing to migrate (Jaeger et al., 2010; Nowotny, 2010). At the same time, women tend to be more risk-
averse in general than men (Dohmen et al., 2011), or even when several definitions of risk domains are 
separately investigated (see e.g., Charness and Gneezy, 2012; Nicholson et al., 2005). There is even some 
evidence of a relationship between risk attitude and migration patterns on the level of short-to medium 
distance migration, when it comes to students' choice of a study location (Weisser, 2015b). 17 61. 
In addition, gender-specific returns to education abroad might be influential as well: if studying 
abroad was associated with a certain risk and women's marginal returns to the acquisition of 
transnationally applicable human capital were lower, they would benefit less from studying abroad at more 
remote destinations than their male fellow students. Consequently, if a host country was particularly 
attractive to students from a specific remote country of origin, e.g. due to historically established 
connections, it might be that only the most risk-seeking students with highest expected returns would 
embark on the journey of studying several years abroad. This could explain higher inbound numbers of 
male students in some countries. 62. 
A second driving force of gender imbalances regarding numbers of inbound students could 
reflect the portfolio of study programmes and access criteria in the tertiary educational system itself. If a 
country had an especially strong focus on engineering sciences, it would plausibly attract a larger share of 
those international students who are interested in such programmes. Gender differences concerning 
enrolment preferences are known from domestic students and could apply to international students as well. 
For example, Charles and Bradley (2009) examined students' enrolment choices in 44 developing, 
transitional or industrialised countries and show that women are underrepresented in the field of 
engineering in all countries and overrepresented in the field of humanities and social sciences. Barone 
(2011) concentrated on eight European countries and points to distinct gender differences in graduation 
numbers on a finer grid of 14 different fields of study. He, too, identified gender-related preference 
disparities which are also remarkably stable over time. Thus, regardless of the economic development of 
source or destination countries, there remain substantial differences in gender-specific tastes. 63. 
Plausibly, this will also come into play when it comes to enrolment at a European university, 
and accordingly, gender-specific inbound rates will be affected. 2.4 Internationally mobile students by field of study 64. 
As the choice of a specific destination country or a receiving institution will be heavily 
influenced by the programmes and curricula offered, international students preferences for various fields of 
studies will be examined in this paragraph. Overall, there is credible evidence that some sorting of students 
into specific host countries occurs according to their tastes for a given field. At the same time, the 
distribution of preferences implies that internationally mobile students do not display a higher preference 
for the STEM fields in general. Table 4. Relative study preferences of internationally mobile students, 2012 student

Table 4 demonstrates that internationally mobile students 18 , coming to EU countries, have a 
high preference for social sciences, business or law programmes. In almost every EU country, where data 18 The students' type indicates whether the underlying data refers to international or foreign students. DELSA/ELSA/WD/SEM(2016)12 26 on internationally mobile students is available, international students are concentrated in those 
programmes. 19 66. 
There is also a large fraction of internationally mobile students who chose Belgium, Hungary, 
Latvia, Poland or Romania in order to enrol in the field of health or welfare. Engineering, manufacturing or 
construction programmes draw internationally mobile students to Denmark, Finland, Germany and 
Sweden. 67. 
The fields of education, services, as well as agriculture or veterinary science are the least 
chosen from the perspective of internationally mobile students. Within the four most preferred fields of 
internationally mobile students, the dominating choices are humanities, business and administration, 
computing and engineering respectively. 68. 
Overall, there is credible evidence that some sorting of students into specific host countries 
occurs according to their tastes for a given field. At the same time, the distribution of preferences implies 
that internationally mobile students do not display a higher preference for the STEM fields in general. 2.5 Mobile students by study level and type 69. 
Further insights can be obtained from disaggregating the international student body by level of 
study. As the underlying goal of this work is an examination of factors which induce internationally mobile 
students from other countries to stay in Europe after graduation, special attention will be paid to post-
graduate studies (ISCED 6). 70. 
There are two reasons to focus on post-graduate education. First, if someone obtained a first or 
second stage degree (Bachelor or Master, ISCED 5) within the EU Higher Education Area and choses then 
to stay for doctoral studies (ISCED 6), this can be seen as an indication of attachment to the host country 
and willingness to prolong the stay in general. 71. 
Furthermore, there is some evidence that PhD students are more inclined to stay in the host 
country than bachelor or master students after graduation (OECD, 2014). And, even if some international 
post-graduate students earned their first degree outside the EU, they would still contribute during their 
post-graduate studies to a host country's research output. 72. 
The average ratio of post-graduate (ISCED 6) internationally mobile students to internationally 
mobile students enrolled in a first-stage (ISCED 5) programme is 0.093 20 in 2012 for the EU 28 (Table 5). 
In the United Kingdom, for example, there is one international post-graduate student enrolled for ten first-
stage international students. 73. 
In agriculture and veterinary science, although total enrolment numbers are low, there is a 
substantial share of international students coming to a European country for their doctoral education. 
Similarly, in the fields of science, mathematics and computing as well as engineering, manufacturing and 
construction, international PhD students have a more pronounced preference for studying in the EU than 
international bachelor and master students do. 19 Cyprus is the most obvious outlier. Here, almost 73 percent of international students are enrolled in the 
field of social science, business and administration. 20 Each countries ratio is weighted by the total number of enrolled international students in this respective 
country. DELSA/ELSA/WD/SEM(2016)12 27 Table 5. Relative preferences of internationally mobile students on the ISCED 6 level, by field in 2012 student

The descriptive statistics presented in this chapter point to the fact that the profile of 
international students in the EU higher education area is rather heterogeneous. Aside from an overall trend 
of rising numbers of international students enrolled in an EU country, there are important distinctions by 
students' origin, sex, designated study fields, and level of study. Concerning the ability to attract high-
skilled individuals, and possibly to keep them, the ratio of international second-stage to international first-
stage tertiary enrolment (Table 5) indicates that some countries seem to have a relatively more pronounced 
appeal than others. An alternative explanation might be that second-stage higher education institutions in 
these countries specifically target international candidates. DELSA/ELSA/WD/SEM(2016)12 28 3 POST-GRADUATION STAY RATES IN THE LITERATURE 75. 
Attracting international students during the course of their studies is one possible way 
immigration can contribute to a knowledge economy. But how could the EU benefit from these talents 
after graduation? 76. 
Keeping a share of those graduates in Europe – the larger, the better – would contribute to this 
goal. Having examined the distribution of internationally mobile students within the European Union, the 
pool of potential stayers, the focus shall be shifted to the main part of this paper, namely understanding and 
empirically examining staying behaviour of international graduates. 77. 
The literature identifies several issues regarding the quantitative assessment of such staying 
behaviour: Precise identification of international students on a cross-country level is the first challenge. A 
second complication is the fact that internationally mobile individuals are often hard to track – if they 
graduate from university, they can easily disappear from the 'administrative radar' and in many cases it is 
virtually impossible to follow them, and therefore to calculate reliable stay rates. 78. 
Furthermore, staying behaviour is a dynamic phenomenon: although some international 
graduates decide to stay immediately after graduation in the host country, they may change their minds in a 
subsequent period – perhaps due to worsening economic conditions in the host country -and go back to 
their country of origin or a third country. Others may have planned right from enrolment to study and then 
gain initial work experience in a foreign country before returning after some years. Consequently, a 
cohort's stay rate immediately after graduation will almost surely decline as time passes. This stresses the 
importance of establishing stay rates' reference periods. 79. 
The following literature review 21 delivers a status quo picture, but also shines a light on 
potential pitfalls with respect to the chosen calculation method. These findings serve as foundation for an 
assessment of the feasibility and error-proneness of various proposed calculation methods in the extended 
version of this paper; only the main implications and results will be presented in chapter 4 of this paper. 80. 
There are two main branches in the literature on staying patterns of internationally mobile 
students, respective academics in general. One is dedicated to the examination of stay (or return) rates 
where the underlying implicit research question is who stays or returns after having graduated abroad? 
Here, students displaying degree-mobility are in the centre of interest and it is possible to derive stay rates 
in or return rates from a given host country, since information on host and source country is available. 81. 
The second branch, which does not directly address stay or return rates, is guided by the slightly 
different question who chooses to start a career abroad after having spent some time during studies 
abroad? In this line of research, the usual observation unit are students exhibiting credit-mobility and it is 
only known that they started their career either 'somewhere' outside their home country or they have 
returned from 'somewhere'. Since there are many similarities between conceptual approaches and 
discussed determinants, the second branch offers valuable insights with respect to locational choices of 
graduates. 82. 
In order to generate insights into observable staying behaviour, which is the prerequisite for any 
evaluation of stay or return rates, staying or returning intentions are left out. Publications covered in this 21 This literature review is not exhaustive, but includes the most prominent publications from 2002 onwards, 
dedicated to stay or return rates of international or foreign academics, comprising students, graduates or 
researchers. DELSA/ELSA/WD/SEM(2016)12 29 literature review represent authors' most recent version of a paper discussing truly observable stay or 
return decisions on an empirical basis. 22 3.1 Credit mobility and the likelihood of starting a career abroad 83. 
Typically, research on the effects of studying abroad concentrates primarily on the 
improvement of language proficiency, intercultural skills or a change of individual attitudes or valuations. 
If authors try to establish a connection between working abroad and previous experiences as internationally 
mobile student, the data does not allow a comparison with a suitable reference group, i.e. non-mobile 
graduates (Bracht et al., 2006; Norris and Gillespie, 2009). This in turn makes it virtually impossible to 
infer a reliable effect of studying abroad. 84. 
The overall focus on soft skills, network and intercultural aspects also applies in the context of 
the few specifically designed long-term studies where authors used a suitable control group (Hansel, 2008; 
Paige et al., 2010). Actual labour market outcomes, and thus any possible dependency from earlier 
experiences abroad, are for the most part ignored. Instead, possible interconnections between credit 
mobility on the one hand and self-assessed 'employability', a vaguely specified 'international dimension' 
in the job or 'intentions to work abroad' on the other hand are examined. 85. 
Limiting the review to quantitative studies of actually observable or retrospectively reported 
episodes of employment abroad excludes a vast amount of small or medium scale survey publications, 
relying mainly on descriptive presentations. 86. 
Despite this restriction, a coherent picture arises in the investigated literature (see overview in 
the extended version of this paper): When non-mobile students are used as a reference group, studying 
abroad exerts an effect with respect to the chosen location of graduates' labour market entry. 87. 
For a short-to medium-term perspective (one to seven years after graduation), Parey and 
Waldinger (2011) and Di Pietro (2012) reported – whilst accounting for potential endogeneity of the 
decision to study abroad – that Erasmus participation increases likelihood of starting the working career 
abroad by 12 to 24 percentage points. Wiers-Jenssen (2008) presented smaller values, between 2 and 4 
percentage points, which come close to the OLS-benchmark values of the first two publications. 
Oosterbeek and Webbink (2011) provided evidence that studying abroad also affects high achieving 
students, with a stay abroad lowering the likelihood of starting working life in the country of origin by 30 
percentage points. 88. 
Enlarging the time horizon to two decades after graduation, Voin and Gérard (2013) as well as 
King and Ruiz-Gelices (2003) calculated probability differentials for those who studied abroad, finding 
that the share of those who ever worked abroad after graduation was between 9 and 17 percentage points 
larger within this group of formerly mobile students. 89. 
Overall, the limited literature on the relationship between international study experience and 
labour market entry location yields credible evidence for a positive and robust effect of student mobility on 
the likelihood of starting a career as an expatriate. Studying at least one semester abroad raises the 
likelihood of working after graduation in another country substantially, although the effect's magnitude 22 Only the latest versions are cited, unless methodology and data source have changed. DELSA/ELSA/WD/SEM(2016)12 30 may vary considerably between fields of study, type of mobility programme, and applied evaluation 
method 23 . 3.2 Degree mobility and stay rates for specific countries 90. 
The type of cross-border mobility examined in this paragraph is mainly degree-mobility, since 
only this type of mobility can provide answers to the question 'How large is the share of internationally 
mobile students who stay in the host country after graduation?' 91. 
All but one of the 41 publications covered are from the periods 2002-2014, hence the same 
timeframe that is also covered by this work's empirical part. The extended version of this paper comprises 
detailed tables with a comprehensive overview over the main findings from the literature review. 92. 
While all included publications address the phenomenon of international students' post-
graduation mobility behaviour in one way or another, the procedures and data sources chosen varied 
widely. Furthermore, derived results vary depending on the precise group under scrutiny, observed field of 
study, combination of host and source country, time horizon, reference point in time etc. 93. 
The first conclusion to be drawn is that no unique stay rate for international students exists for a 
given country, but rather a multitude of stay rates. This reflects not primarily imprecise calculation 
methods or small sample sizes, but great variance in the angle of observation. As a special case for 
example, Ruiz (2014) ascertained even different stay rates related to varying levels of aggregation for the 
US: whilst one third stayed after graduation in the US, 15 percentage points of foreign students lingered 
even in the same metropolitan area. 94. 
Nonetheless, some central tendencies and common patterns can be derived for some types of 
bilateral stay rates or reference groups. 95. 
A substantial number of authors (e.g. Achato et al., 2011; Bratsberg, 1995; Guo, 2010; 
Merwood, 2007; OECD, 2011; Wilkinson et al., 2010) calculated stay rates based on permit status changes 
of former students: the number of status changers over international (foreign) graduates or students. This 
gives an idea how many international students have been granted (temporary) residence. Those studies 
relied on large sample sizes, but overall results are sensitive to administrative and legislative changes over 
time. Consequently, the figures presented should be interpreted as stay rates for individuals who were 
allowed to stay instead of those who chose to stay. 96. 
Short-term stay rates are much higher than medium-term stay rates (Finn, 2012; Ministeriet for 
Forskning, Innovation og Videregående Uddannelser, 2013; Nemeckova and Krylova, 2014; Suter and 
Jandl, 2006), reflecting a non-negligible subsequent emigration wave of initial stayers. The declining 
numbers of stayers stabilise in a longer perspective. Nevertheless, the dynamic aspect of a staying decision, 
which can be revised even years after graduation, is rarely accounted for directly. Only studies relying on a 
survey, or those tracking career histories (CIDA, 2005; Sage et al., 2013; Tian, 2013), provide information 
regarding repeated migration events in the context of international students' mobility. Unfortunately, they 
suffer from small or very small sample size, most times below 500 subject-specific observations (e.g. 
Badikyan, 2011; Bond et al., 2006; Lehr, 2008; Silver, 2012). 97. 
In general, medium-to long-run stay rates of doctoral students and researchers tend to be higher 
than those of undergraduate students (Gaule, 2011; van Bouwel and Veugelers, 2012; van de Sande et al., 23 Estimated coefficients of Oosterbeek and Webbink (2011), Parey and Waldinger (2011) and Di Pietro 
(2012) are larger in absolute magnitude since they are local average treatment effects. DELSA/ELSA/WD/SEM(2016)12 31 2005). This may be linked to a different focus at the time of the decisions to go abroad, although it may 
also reflect greater returns to postgraduate degrees, or favourable policy settings for those with advanced 
degrees. 98. 
Students from countries with weaker economic conditions tend to display higher stay rates in 
economically more developed countries than their peers from other economically developed countries 
(Hein and Plesch, 2008; Vasiljev, 2014). Chinese and Indian international students are usually amongst 
those with highest stay rates (Achato et al., 2011; Wang, 2012; Zang and Li, 2002). 99. 
International students or researchers in a scholarship programme mostly leave the respective 
host countries after graduation (Hein and Plesch, 2008; Lehr, 2008; van de Sande et al., 2005). This is 
related to specific features of the scholarships, i.e. requiring students to leave after graduation. A second 
explanation is that such grants can be a component of a development aid programme in fields relatively 
more valued in source countries, for instance agriculture. 100. 
With respect to field of study, stay rates of international students enrolled in natural sciences or 
in a technical field tend to be higher than for those enrolled in social sciences and humanities. Retention 
rates are especially higher in the field of life sciences (Finn, 2012; Kim et al., 2011; Wolfeil, 2009). 101. 
Amongst those studies who reported gender-specific stay rates, results point to a more 
pronounced staying behaviour of female international students. Where there was a substantial difference 
between stay rates of the two sexes, male students are typically more prone to leave the host country after 
they graduated (Bijwaard, 2010; Vasiljeva, 2014). 102. 
Focusing on the EU, literature provides even more scarce guidance: only for approximately one 
third of the current 28 EU members stay rates could be found. Once again, stay rates vary between bilateral 
pairs of host and source countries (or regions), and across applied methodologies (Felbermayr and 
Reczkowski, 2012 presented for the EU a kind of upper limit of 71%). The highest rates can be observed 
for the UK, Germany, France, Denmark and the Netherlands -also five of the countries with highest per 
capita income. Aside from the Netherlands and Denmark, they also have the largest tertiary educational 
sectors. Also noteworthy is that stay rates based on permit data seem to be smaller than figures based on 
survey or administrative micro-data. This might be attributable to the fact that implemented surveys 
typically addressed a specific sub-sample of internationally mobile students, e.g. alumni of a university or 
participants in a scholarship programme. In these cases special effort is exerted to track members of the 
designated target group. Yet, if stayers had a higher response rate than returnees, as they first group might 
be easier to track, results would be skewed towards higher stay rates. 103. 
In the end, a non-conclusive picture emerges from the literature. There is an urgent need to 
develop a more coherent approach to evaluate stay rates of internationally mobile students. To conduct 
reliable between-country or between-group analyses, a robust methodological framework, underpinned by 
comparable and reliable data, is required. 3.3 Determinants of post-graduation staying behaviour 104. 
Having sketched some potential determinants of international students' initial locational choices 
in chapter 2, the extent to which those factors also contribute to international graduates' staying decision 
shall now be explored. 105. 
Some host country characteristics, e.g. a specific language or cultural similarities, might affect 
international students and graduates all alike. Other destination country features, such as labour market 
conditions around graduation time or work permit regulations might have a more severe impact on the 
decisions of graduates as they are immediately concerned. DELSA/ELSA/WD/SEM(2016)12 32 106. 
In the literature on international student stay rates a number of publications assess determinants 
of international students' staying behaviour from a quantitative point of view. This subchapter summarises 
already identified determinants or promising candidates and evaluates their magnitude, as indicated in the 
literature. 107. 
As one of the first authors, Bratsberg (1995) investigated possible determinants of students' 
long-run stay rates in the US for a set of 69 countries of origin in an econometrical framework. Within his 
analysis special attention was paid to general economic and labour market differences between destination 
and source countries. He presented evidence that earnings variations in both countries played a significant 
role in explaining students staying behaviour. If earnings increased in the US by one standard deviation, 
the average stay rate rose by 3.2 percentage points. Similarly, a one standard deviation decrease in the 
source countries' labour income raised the long-term stay rate by 8.2 percentage points. Furthermore, 
higher degrees of income inequality or higher returns to education in the country of origin were associated 
with lower stay rates. Interpreting higher earnings variation as an indication of a relatively higher valuation 
of specific skills, this result points to the special importance of skills' valuation in the home country – if 
engineers were comparably poorly rewarded in the country of origin, international engineering graduates 
would prefer to stay in the respective host country. If the source country's GDP was to double, observed 
stay rate would decline on average by 5.5 percentage points. Bratsberg (1995) extended his empirical 
analysis also to non-economic aspects: increasing geographical distance coincided with a higher stay rate 24 , 
so did stronger immigration ties between source and destination country. 108. 
In its evaluation of the Canadian Francophone Scholarship Program (CFSP), part of Canadian 
development assistance, CIDA (2005) pointed to factors which made some former scholarship holders stay 
in Canada. Amongst this group, the opportunity to bring one's family to Canada right from the start was 
mentioned as fostering staying behaviour. The desire to gather working experience in an industrialised 
country, specific job offers in Canada, respectively the lack of attractive job opportunities in the home 
countries were also major concerns of those who stayed. The general socio-political and academic culture 
in the host country, as well as non-deterring immigration regulations were referred to by survey 
participants as relevant reasons for staying. 109. 
In a discussion of brain circulation, Rosenzweig (2006) evaluated factors affecting the 
depreciation rate of foreign student stocks in the US 25 . He derived that if the skill price in the source 
country doubles, the stay rate decreased by 32 to 41 percent. Foreign students from Asian countries were in 
general less likely to stay in the US after they completed their study programme, but they were also found 
to react more sensitively to changes in skill prices. 110. 
Within their analysis of locational and work place choice of Dutch graduates, Venhorst et al. 
(2010) examined possible determinants of staying in peripheral regions of the Netherlands. They indicated 
that students born outside of Europe were in general much more likely to leave these regions for work 
abroad than to stay. This effect was even more pronounced for students from other European countries. 24 If the distance between the home country's capital and the closest US gateway increased by 1000 miles, the 
stay rate increased by 3.4 percentage points. The distance was likely to capture monetary and psychological 
migration costs, thus staying would be a strategy to avoid the costs of re-migration to the country of origin. 25 Rosenzweig (2006) calculated a stock depreciation rate, using asan unadjusted numerator students with an 
F-1 visa who adjusted their status within a seven month period in 2003, rather than twelve months. In the model specification, GDP in the source country is excluded  " as financing cost should not be a significant factor for the decision to return " . Rosenzwieg's model of returning behaviour includes 
university ranking variables. In a subsequent version Rosenzweig (2008) accounts for average GDP growth 
but not the possible impact of overall wealth of a source country. DELSA/ELSA/WD/SEM(2016)12 33 However, regions near a border successfully maintained high ability students from other countries, as they 
were more inclined to stay than to start a career abroad. 111. 
Conducting an analysis of life cycle migration to the Netherlands, Bijwaard (2010) applied 
several mover-stayer duration models which identified factors that influence the probability of becoming a 
stayer for several groups of migrants, including students. For students, he showed that the longer students 
stayed in the Netherlands, the less likely they were to leave. If students were older than 25 years when they 
arrived, they were also less likely to stay, but this effect diminished with increasing age. Accounting for re-
migration events, after having left the Netherlands, the author derived long-run probabilities for residing in 
the Netherlands. Based on estimates, generated within the mover-stayer duration framework, he presented 
distinct results in comparison to a student reference migrant 26 : married or female international students 27 
had a higher propensity to stay in the long-run in the Netherlands. This held true to an even larger extent 
for students from other European countries (non-EU members), Turkey, China or Africa. Students from 
English-speaking countries of origin, such as the UK, the USA or Canada, displayed either a similar or 
lower probability of staying as the reference student does. Students from new EU-members and Germany, 
in contrast, had a higher likelihood of staying – in the first cases economic differentials might matter, in the 
latter case geographical or cultural proximity could serve as possible explanations. 112. 
In a follow-up study Bijwaard and Wang (2013) shifted their analytical focus fully to 
international students and investigated the relevance of labour market and family formation dynamics after 
graduation too. Using a 'timing-of-events' approach they estimated the impact of employment or 
unemployment spells as well as of marriage on the hazard of leaving the Netherlands after graduation. The 
social factor 'marriage' reduced for sub-groups the hazard of returning, thus implies a prolonged stay in the 
Netherlands. Aside from the special group of students from Surinam or the Antilles, finding employment 
affected this hazard in the same way, but the impact was less pronounced. Unemployment spells affected 
students from different regions or origin in varying ways: students from EU-15 and EFTA countries, less 
developed countries and the afore-mentioned former colonies tended to return as reaction to individual 
unemployment. The opposite holds true for students from other developed countries. 113. 
Hein and Plesch (2008) used administrative data from a large Catholic scholarship-providing 
institution to evaluate determinants of return for scholarship holders from developing or transitioning 
countries who studied in Germany. Personal factors, such as age, having children or closer ties to the home 
country were found to be negatively related to the likelihood of staying. Network effects tended to increase 
only men's propensity to stay. Language proximity between the home country language and German 
predicted staying behaviour in a pronounced manner, as did the time spent in Germany. Women were also 
more likely to stay in general, and they reacted more sensitively to both factors. Hein and Plesch (2008) 
provided also some insights regarding the impact of economic and political factors: poor labour market 
conditions in the destination country or rising living standards in the country of origin made international 
students return, and the former seems to especially affect women's decisions. Greater economic or political 
freedom, and better living conditions for women in the home country, lowered the likelihood of staying 
after graduation. Regarding the source regions, students from Asia were less inclined to stay in Germany 
after graduation whilst historical ties operated in the opposite way for African students. 26 The student reference migrant is defined as unmarried 21 year old male student originating from an EU15 
or EFTA country, not including Germany, the UK and France. His long-run staying probability is 21 
percent. 27 Most interestingly, the parameter estimate of females intensity to return (after having left) in the student 
sample is negative – if they leave once, they are less inclined to return than their male peers. DELSA/ELSA/WD/SEM(2016)12 34 114. 
Scrutinising returning decisions of scientists who joined a US chemistry department during 
graduate studies or post-doctoral career, Gaule (2011) estimated a discrete-time model of the hazard of 
return. He derived that those who came during their graduate studies were only one third as likely to return 
as those who came as faculty. Recognising the potential impact of a selective stay or return decision he 
controlled for researchers' ability too: academic scientist within the highest category of productivity, 
measured as number of publications weighted by publishing journals' impact factors, were approximately 
twice as likely to stay in the US. Beyond individual factors he also evaluated the possible influence of 
source countries' characteristics on the staying behaviour. He found that if GDP per capita in a country of 
origin was to increase by USD 1,000, the odds of return were to increase by 20 percent. Considering a 
home country's scientific strength in the field of chemistry, measured as relevant publications in relation to 
its population, any significant impact on the staying decision disappeared when controlling for country's 
wealth. 115. 
Drawing from the Survey of Earned Doctorates (SED), Kim et al. (2011) examined 
determinants of staying behaviour for three cohorts (1980s, 1990s and 2000s) of foreign post-graduate 
students in the US in a large sample. The impact of age diminished in later cohorts whilst female graduates 
were persistently more inclined towards staying. His findings supported also the claim that students' 
attachment to a host country – as measured by continuing directly with post-graduate studies -is a non-
negligible factor: those who came to the US for their undergraduate studies were twice as likely to stay 
after their PhD-Studies. Compared to the staying behaviour of the Canadian reference group, Chinese, 
Indian and Korean students were always much more likely to stay. Though Europeans and students from 
Africa displayed a higher likelihood too, they were less likely to stay than their peers from the three Asian 
countries. Cohort-specific patterns varied also by field of study: whilst earlier cohorts in any fields, aside 
from agriculture, were much more likely to stay than the reference group of biology-graduates, this pattern 
was reversed for the 2000s cohort, suggesting that conditions for biologists in the USA must have 
improved relative to those for graduates in other fields. Kim et al. (2011) also showed that staying 
behaviour is partially influenced by financial aspects: being funded as research or teaching assistant during 
the doctoral studies increased the likelihood of staying afterwards substantially compared to being self-
reliant. On the other hand, receiving a fellowship and employer or foreign government financial support 
lowered the staying probability significantly. 116. 
Van Bouwel (2010) provided some descriptive evidence of factors affecting the locational 
choice of Europeans regarding the first job after graduation from doctoral studies in the US and a later 
career stage. The author explained that staying is more frequently chosen in later cohorts. Like Kim et al. 
(2011), she also highlighted the relevance of the funding source: those who chose to stay were less likely to 
be funded by an institution in the country of origin. Furthermore, stayers were much less likely to focus on 
a research topic related to Europe in their dissertation, but more likely to be involved in an US-specific 
topic. It can be concluded that providing funding and supporting host country-specific research topics 
might foster graduates attachment to a host country. 117. 
In a follow-up study, Van Bouwel and Veugelers (2012) investigated determinants of staying 
decisions of European doctoral students in the US incorporating scientific output measures. In addition to 
confirming the basic previous findings, they found a strong positive effect of funding by the host institution 
on the likelihood of staying after graduation. Additionally, being in a highly productive or supportive 
research environment, indicated by existence or impact of early publications, encouraged European 
graduates to stay. Conditioning on institutional quality or reputation, high-ability graduates chose high-
quality institutions for their first job in general, preferably in the host country, but also in the source 
country over institutions with lower reputation. In this context, linguistic or cultural similarity seemed to 
affect staying behaviour once again, since graduates from English-speaking countries were much more 
likely to stay, irrespective of institutional reputation. DELSA/ELSA/WD/SEM(2016)12 35 118. 
The entrenchment of doctoral students with their country of study was also highlighted by 
OECD (2014). International PhD graduates were found to be significantly more likely to remain in Norway 
after graduation, as were those who started a family. A further interesting finding was that having worked 
during studies in a field related to the field of post-graduation employment increased the likelihood of 
staying. Such job opportunities during studies might have served as entrance ticket to the labour market, 
e.g. either by granting more direct access to job networks or by providing more country and occupation 
specific human capital. 119. 
Reconstructing the careers of Chinese scientists in the field of mathematics, physics, chemistry 
and biology, Tian (2013) investigated possible determinants of return for those with a foreign doctoral 
degree from an English-speaking country. Based on a sample of 159 foreign degree holders (the small size 
is due to the biographical identification procedure of scientists' career history), the only highly significant 
determinant of return is the quality of the respective institution at which someone earned her or his 
doctorate. Compared to the reference group of higher education institutions in the lower six deciles of the 
Academic Ranking of World Universities ('Shanghai Ranking'), those with degree from the top decile 
were six times as likely to stay abroad, those from third to fourth decile still four times as likely to choose a 
career path abroad. This is an indication that institutional quality, e.g. research strength and reputation, 
may affect job market success and thus staying decisions of international graduates who chose an academic 
or research track. 120. 
Using a unique combination of data from population, employment and educational institution 
registers, Vasiljeva (2014) evaluated determinants of EU and EEA post-graduate students' decision to stay 
at least four years in Denmark after the 2004 EU enlargement. She concluded that the smaller the nominal 
wage gap between source and host country, the more inclined students were to stay in Denmark in the 
medium-run. Students from Southern or Western Europe were also more likely to stay than those from 
Scandinavian countries. Unemployment and social security differentials between the country of origin and 
Denmark did not play a significant role in explaining students' staying decisions. Accounting for cultural 
dimensions, students from countries with a higher acceptance for masculinity dominance 28 displayed a 
higher preference for staying in Denmark. At the same time, male students from countries with higher 
acceptance for power inequality were found to be less inclined towards staying – most likely as they 
perceive that there might be more opportunities for them in their country of origin. In contrast to other 
authors' findings, Vasiljeva (2014) showed inequality in the home country to be positively related to 
staying probabilities whilst linguistic similarity exhibited no explanatory power at all 29 . 121. 
Some common findings can be derived from this literature review. The most obvious is that the 
majority evolved around a discussion of staying behaviour in the US, a very large English-speaking 
economy with a tertiary education sector attracting many international students. Most European countries 
have very different labour markets from the US, even ignoring the language factor. Regarding staying 
patterns of international graduates in the EU, literature provides only determinants for the Netherlands, 
Norway or Denmark. 122. 
Nevertheless, there are a number of common determinants of international graduate stay rates. 
Women tend to be more inclined towards staying in the chosen country of destination. Forming social ties, 
e.g. marriage, fosters the willingness to stay – so does a longer time spent in the host country. Both factors 
contribute to a higher attachment to the destination country. The latter leads to a larger degree of 28 measured by Hofstede's Masculinity vs. Femininity Index 29 As the author indicated, this outcome may be driven by the fact that the  " language proximity variable 
mainly accounts for the effect of neighbouring Scandinavian countries which score high on this index "  
(Vasiljeva, 2014, p. 16). DELSA/ELSA/WD/SEM(2016)12 36 familiarisation with a country's cultural peculiarities, contributing also to the formation of country-specific 
human capital, which in turn facilities labour market entry in a host country. 123. 
International graduates base their decisions whether to stay or to return also on perceived 
chances: if they assume job opportunities, i.e. skill-specific wages to be relatively higher in the home 
country, or if the wealth differential between source and host country is not in favour of the host country, 
they tend to return. But if they expect to run into social or political impediments, lowering their perceived 
opportunities in a country of origin, they show a preference for staying. 124. 
Regarding the staying behaviour of doctoral students and scientists, especially the attractiveness 
of the research environment and the funding source during their post-graduate studies is pivotal: the better 
and stimulating working conditions were the less willing are those individuals to lose such benefits by 
turning their back on the destination country. 125. 
Thus, the central conclusion to be drawn is that international graduates do not decide lightly 
where they start their career after graduation. Instead, they stay if they consider a destination to be a 
country of social and economic opportunities, as other types of migrants do as well. DELSA/ELSA/WD/SEM(2016)12 37 4 WHAT MAKES INTERNATIONAL GRADUATES STAY IN THE EU: INVESTIGATING 
DETERMINANTS OF INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS' POST-GRADUATION RESIDENCE 
CHOICES 126. 
This chapter is dedicated to empirically investigating the staying behaviour of international 
graduates in the EU member states. The chosen econometric approach aims at providing some answers to 
the question what determines international students' stay rates in EU countries? Above insights into 
possible mechanisms and determinants are addressed in an empirical framework, using permit based stay 
rates. Although there are some drawbacks 30 , they offer also a huge advantage compared to the tested 
alternatives: a substantial sample size of bilateral stay rates in 2012, ranging from 783 to 2107 
observations. 127. 
A brief discussion of these statistics' features and related issues will be given in chapter 4.1. 
Chapter 4.2 lays the foundation for later econometric analysis by highlighting likely mechanisms and 
introducing components which potentially exert an effect on stay rates. The econometric estimation 
method will be presented in chapter 4.3. In chapter 4.4 results from the preferred model specifications will 
be presented and their sensitivity to underlying modelling assumption will be evaluated. 4.1 About the nature of internationally mobile students' stay rates in the EU 128. 
Internationally mobile students are not an easy subject to study in a cross-country setup. First, 
as a highly mobile group they are hard to track: Across countries, or even within countries, they are not 
always registered in a comprehensive manner. In particular after graduation, during the transition from 
university to working life, they easily disappear from the records. 129. 
A second issue is the existence of various definitions or recording procedures in different 
countries. Some compile information on internationally mobile students using the resident concept others 
rely on the national concept. Additionally, the data may vary regarding the level of aggregation: some 
countries report only aggregate figures for all incoming students whilst others itemise them by country of 
origin. Most of the data on internationally mobile students in the EU is stock data which cannot be linked 
to any individual characteristics. This drawback can be partially remedied by evaluating staying behaviour 
of individuals included in the European Labour Force Survey (EU-LFS); yet, this too comes at a price. 130. 
For the purpose of a cross-country assessment of staying behaviour of internationally mobile 
students in the EU the previously mentioned hitches impose substantial analytical challenges. There is no 
single perfect statistic identifying post-graduation mobility patterns in this group over all 28 EU member 
states in a truly comparable and perfectly reliable manner. Instead, the statistic of choice depends on the 
specific angle of a research question. For instance, the required statistic in an econometric analysis of 
origin-specific stay rates for all member states should display different features then the statistic used to 
evaluate labour market outcomes of internationally mobile students, respectively graduates. 131. 
As integral part of this research, several alternative statistics have been derived and compared in 
an exploratory study part, found in the extended version of this paper (Weisser, 2015a). Detailed 
information regarding their construction is provided there and the resulting statistics are contrasted in light 
of their advantages and limitations. The following subchapter only provides a brief overview of stay rates 
used for subsequent econometric analysis. 30 Methodological issues are discussed at length in the extended version of this paper. DELSA/ELSA/WD/SEM(2016)12 38 4.1.1 Construction of stay rates 132. 
The three relevant permit based stay rates are: í µí±í µí± í µí±í µí±,í µí±¡ 
1í µí°´,µí°´, í µí±í µí± í µí±í µí±,í µí±¡ 
1í µí°µ,ℎ=3 , and í µí±í µí± í µí±í µí±,í µí±¡ 
1í µí°µ,í µí±í µí±í µí±¥ .While all of them identify those who stayed using permit status changes (from education to another permit category), each 
was constructed using a different denominator. Stay rate í µí±í µí± í µí±í µí±,í µí±¡ 
1í µí°´derivesµí°´derives the population of internationally mobile graduates as the total number of those who relinquish education-related permit status. This 
population proxy, however, has to be recovered from a demographic equality, based on changes in stock 
data and new permits since the required figure is not in the data. Several drawbacks are associated: permits 
for education reasons are not exclusively issued for those enrolled in tertiary education, and for available 
data the demographic equality does not always allow recovering plausible population proxies for all 
countries and periods. The latter problem can be circumvented using past inflows, recorded as newly 
issued education permits in a previous period, to generate a proxy for the population in the denominator 
and match the respective cohort to present status changers (the stayers). Several time horizons have been 
evaluated, accordingly to usual durations of a study programme. Most meaningful was a time horizon of 
three years 31 , yielding stay rate í µí±í µí± í µí±í µí±,í µí±¡ 
1í µí°µ,ℎ=3 . To account for varying time horizons of study spells (between one and four years) a mixed cohort approach integrated over cumulative inflows of these periods to recover 
a proxy for the denominator, resulting in stay rate í µí±í µí± í µí±í µí±,í µí±¡ 
1í µí°µ,í µí±í µí±í µí±¥ .. In addition, all three categories of stay rates were calculated as three year averages over the years 2010 to 2012 32 in order to counteract any random 
fluctuations, and to attenuate the impact of minor changes in data recording. 4.1.2 Post-graduation stay rates in the EU 133. 
Depicted conditional stay rates (í µí±í µí±1í µí°´,Figure 9) highlight that staying behaviour of 
internationally mobile students varies greatly, depending on their country of origin. For example by far the 
highest stay rate on the aggregate EU-level is displayed by internationally mobile students from Armenia 
(79.5%). A high tendency to stay in the EU can also be observed for students from Northern and Western 
Africa, some South-East Asian countries and the Commonwealth of Independent States. These patterns can 
be seen as hints towards potential determinants of staying behaviour, such as economic development or 
historical relations. 31 corresponding to a three year bachelor programme 32 For the United Kingdom stock data series only contained values from 2012, therefore it had frequently to 
be excluded from stay rates' analysis. DELSA/ELSA/WD/SEM(2016)12 39 Figure 9. Conditional average EU stay rates from 2010-2012, by source country Note: 
EU refers to 2014 EU members, excluding the United Kingdom. Since these stay rates are based on permits (SR1A), only 
figures for non-EU countries can be derived. 134. 
Similarly, destination-specific stay rates across the EU suggest that the retention potential 
differs significantly between host countries. Figure 10 compares the stay rates in specific EU member 
states, grouping incoming students into three categories depending on their origin. Stay rates in larger 
member states tend to be higher, yet some smaller destinations also manage to retain a relatively large 
share amongst their specific pool of incoming students. At the same time, stay rates of internationally 
mobile students from other developed countries (OECD net EU) are typically distinctly below those from 
students originating from third countries (World, net EU, EFTA and OECD). 135. 
On the aggregate EU-level, across calculation methods, 6.3 to 8.0 percent of incoming students 
from other OECD countries stayed in the country they studied. Those from third countries were much more 
likely to stay; corresponding rates are in the range of 20.5 to 23.1 percent. Figure 10. Comparison of conditional stay rates for international students from various source regions Source: Based on Eurostat permit data, own calculations Note:

As the previous section has demonstrated, observed bilateral stay rates are highly specific to the 
examined country pairs, and to a certain extent to the calculation method. The chosen analytical strategy 
thus accommodates these facts by focusing on country-related features and applying the econometric 
estimation procedure to all three types of stay rates. 137. 
The basic idea is to evaluate the impact of various specific features of source country í µí± and 
destination country í µí± on the respective bilateral stay rate í µí±í µí± í µí±í µí± . Within the analysis of these aggregate 
pairwise stay rates three different types of influential factors will be considered 33 : 1. Time constant features of host country í µí± (í µí»¿ í µí± ) which affect students from all non-EU countries 
during the time horizon in a similar manner, e.g. cultural or climatic aspects of the host country. 
2. Specific pairwise time-constant factors (í µí± í µí±í µí± ), e.g. sharing a common language or having historical 
ties. 
3. Potentially time-varying factors (í µí± í µí±í µí±,í µí±¡ ), such as economic conditions, social aspects or legal 
frameworks, encompassing composite indicators: Global Competitiveness Index (GCI) and 
Worldwide Governance Indicators (WGI). 4.3 Estimating determinants: econometric methodology 138. 
All three types of bilateral stay rates introduced in chapter 4.1 (í µí±í µí± í µí±í µí±,í µí±¡ 
1í µí°´,µí°´, í µí±í µí± í µí±í µí±,í µí±¡ 
1í µí°µ,ℎ=3 , and í µí±í µí± í µí±í µí±,í µí±¡ 
1í µí°µ,í µí±í µí±í µí±¥ ) have been incorporated into two different modelling approaches. The first one, based on Papke and 
Wooldridge (1996) can be applied if one assumes that zero stay rates and positive stay rates originate from 
a common process, and the analytical focus rests on the stay rates' conditional mean. However, if stay rates 
are not the result of one single, but two sequential processes, a two-part estimation in the sense of Ramalho 
et al. (2011) might be appropriate. The first part is a binary zero-one response: either there are no stayers at 
all or there is some positive number, yielding a non-zero stay rate. The second part consists of a fractional 
response estimation for those cases with stay rates larger than zero 34 . 4.4 Determinants of bilateral stay rates: empirical results 139. 
Since model selection procedures (see Table A. 6 to Table A. 11) indicated that all other link 
functions are more frequently rejected than the complementary loglog link function, the subsequent part is 
dedicated to the discussion of the one-and two-part specifications applying this specific type of link 
function. 140. 
Table 6 shows the outcomes for the most preferred specification relying on the Global 
Competitiveness Index. For all the three stay rates the respective results from the one-part and fractional 
part of a two-part model are reported. The latter shows results for the subset of non-zero bilateral stay 
rates, hence it accounts for the possibility that there might be in fact two distinct processes as discussed in 
chapter 4.3. 141. 
Due to the construction of stay rates as averages (typically 2010 to 2012), and for the sake of 
model parsimoniousness, GDP per capita differences, unemployment and competitiveness differences 33 Further discussion on these components is included in the extended version of this paper. 34 Derivation of both models is explained in the extended version of this paper. DELSA/ELSA/WD/SEM(2016)12 41 entered the model as three year averages as well 35 . The 'diaspora effect' incorporates potential network 
effects with the corresponding variable being the share of migrants 36 from country í µí± living in a destination 
country í µí± over the total population. This share can be interpreted as proxy for the likelihood of meeting 
someone from the same country of origin – hence as probability of benefitting from potential diaspora 
network effects. 142. 
The implementation of differentials between destination country (DC) and country of origin 
(OC) was a result of two arguments. First, the degree of precision increased substantially when destination 
country controls have been introduced (see appendix). This was mainly due to an improved estimation for 
observations at the lower bound of zero. An immediate consequence is that variables at the destination 
country level display perfect colinearity with these country controls and thus cannot be used anymore in 
the cross-section sample. 143. 
The second consideration refers to the underlying decision-making process of individuals. As 
previously mentioned, perceived opportunities will most likely govern the process whether to stay or to 
return on an individual level. If an international graduate arrives at the conclusion that her living standard 
will probably be higher in the destination country, she would be more inclined towards staying. Such 
comparisons can be accounted for on the aggregate level by using differences whilst perfect colinearity 
poses no longer an issue. 144. 
Testing the model's specification by usage of a generalised goodness of functional form test 
(GGOFF, Ramalho et al., 2014), suitable to detect symmetric and asymmetric misspecification alike, 
supported the complementary loglog specification clearly in favour of symmetric ones, i.e. logit or probit. 
Parallel conducted RESET-tests yielded also results in favour of the complementary loglog fractional 
modelling approach. Direct model comparisons of one-and two-part specifications, using a P-test 
(Davidson and MacKinnon, 1981; results not reported), lead to varying preferences depending on the 
dependent variable and set of explanatory variables. Overall results insinuate a weak preference for the 
two-part specifications. 145. 
For all three different stay rates to be investigated, some common results can be derived from 
the GCI specification: bilateral time-invariant factors play a predominant role. If destination and source 
country share a common official language the stay rate is between 3.7 and 6.3 percentage points higher for 
students from such a country of origin. The effect of colonial ties after 1945 is similarly pronounced but 
less frequently significant. The impact of distance is also non-negligible. If the distance between capitals 
was to increase by one percent beyond 1000 kilometres 37 observed stay rates decline on average by 0.61 to 
0.84 percentage points. 35 Alternative specifications including lagged differences have been tested. These yielded neither substantial 
changes in other variables estimated coefficients nor in additional robust insights into the dynamic 
influence of GDP per capita or unemployment differentials. 36 The stock of migrants is based on the OECD's DIOC database 2010 and has been restricted to those being 
at least 35 years old. The restriction has been adopted to limit the likelihood that the derived share of 
migrants includes also internationally mobile students whose numbers are actually an integral part of the 
stay rate to be explained. 37 Average marginal effects 'dy/ex' have the interpretation of semi-elasticities. Since marginal effects are not 
constant, but depending on the reference distance, reported results referring to a specific value deliver a 
more precise picture. Alternative specifications accounted for non-linearities as well. The quadratic 
distance showed up to be insignificant. DELSA/ELSA/WD/SEM(2016)12 42 Table 6. Determinants of stay rates – socio-economic and competitiveness differentials SR 1A

(significantly) larger in the destination country, and 'OC>DC' vice-versa. Both categories' outcomes refer to the reference group of 
those observations with no distinct difference between destination and source country. GDP per capita, unemployment rate and GCI 
pillar score differences entered as three year averages. 'dx/dx' gives the discrete change from the base level (no difference between 
the two countries). 'dy/ex' gives the change of the dependent variable as reaction to a one percent change of the respective 
continuous variable x at the given reference point of x. Additional information in the lower segment originates from the estimation of 
the underlying model with a complementary loglog link function. 146. 
Economic prospects in an isolated view seem not to matter much on this aggregate level of 
analysis: Differentials in the average GDP per capita are insignificant in the full specification. They only 
become significant in the expected way in a reduced model (Table A. 4 to Table A. 6) 147. 
In light of findings in the literature regarding the impact of unemployment on staying 
behaviour, a negative relationship between higher unemployment rates in source countries and a lower stay 
rate in a European destination country is not implausible. Bijward and Wang (2013) provided evidence that 
some individuals opt to stay in the country with higher unemployment rates. On the other hand, Vasiljeva 
(2014) identified in her analysis no significant effect of unemployment differentials. 148. 
An alternative interpretation could be found in the basic concept of the Roy model (Roy, 1951), 
applied in the context of return migration of foreign-born by Borjas and Bratsberg (1996) 38 . Even where 
the unemployment rate in the country of origin were relatively higher, it still may be beneficial to return for 
ability-dependent for a specific subgroup. Some international graduates may face attractive employment 38 Measures of inequality (including GINI indexes), the income distribution or unemployment rates of tertiary 
education are not included due to small sample size or insufficient observations. DELSA/ELSA/WD/SEM(2016)12 44 perspectives in their country of origin even when the general unemployment rate is higher than in the 
destination country, if for example they offered a scarce and highly valued skill portfolio (e.g. international 
experience or specific technical knowledge not widely spread in the source country).Regarding aspects of 
competitiveness, two remarkable facts emerge. First, international graduates seem to display a certain 
preference for destination countries with more developed institutions: stay rates rise by 3.2 to 7.8 
percentage points if the average score differential of the GCI's first pillar is at least one standard deviation 
above the mean. Second, if a country of origin scores distinctly higher compared to a destination country in 
the pillar 'innovations', observed stay rates decline by 4 to 8.5 percentage points. Staying behaviour would 
thus respond to improved innovativeness and a focus on a technological pioneering role in the country of 
study. 149. 
There is also an indication that stay rates for students from larger economies (market size) are 
smaller. Possibly, they expect to have a larger variety of opportunities in their home economy. In a similar 
fashion, distinctly higher scores in the infrastructure pillar of a country of origin are associated with lower 
stay rates as well. 150. 
The following table presents average marginal effects obtained using the governance 
specifications (WGI). The results are highly consistent with respect to time-constant bilateral components 
and economic differentials, measured by GDP per capita and unemployment rate differences (Table 7). 151. 
Furthermore, the diaspora effect seems to be robust across almost all specifications. If the share 
of migrants from a specific country of origin increases from 0.1 to 0.101 percent 39 , observed stay rates tend 
to be higher by 0.95 to 2.8 percentage points. 152. 
Average WGI score differentials have been constructed in accordance with the 90 percent 
confidence intervals from Kaufmann et al. (2010) 40 . The aspect of 'government effectiveness' bears across 
all types of stay rates and model specifications significant explanatory power: if a destination country 
scores on average always significantly above a country of origin, stay rates are between 4.8 and 8.7 
percentage points higher; if the country of origin performs better in this regard, stay rates are typically 10 
to 11.4 percent smaller. All six specifications thus point to the fact that international graduates have a 
certain preference to settle in the country which has more effective government and better public services. 153. 
Similarly, if a source country scores on average better in the domain of 'voice and 
accountability', the average staying likelihood decreases by 13.6 to 16.1 percentage points 41 . 39 Respective shares have a mean of 0.04 percent and a maximum of 10 percent. The chosen reference value 
of 0.1 percent was already in the highest decile. 40 'DC>OC' indicates that the average score difference for the years 2010 to 2012 was always positive whilst 
the 90% confidence intervals of both countries' scores were always non-overlapping. This implies that the 
resulting difference is in fact significant. The reference category for the WGI differential indicator consists 
of those observations which displayed in at least one year an insignificant score differential. Based on the 
indicators distribution it can be concluded that country-pairs in the reference group displayed a comparably 
high degree of similarity in the specific domain. 41 The positive marginal effect for SR 1A highlights the issue associated with much smaller sample size and a 
reduced set of involved countries. DELSA/ELSA/WD/SEM(2016)12 45 Table 7. Determinants of stay rates – socio-political and governance differentials SR 1A

unemployment rate and GCI pillar score differences entered as three year averages. 154. 
For stay rates derived based on method 1B, the dimensions 'political stability and the absence 
of violence' as well as 'rule of law' reveal significant correlations with the expected sign. Yet, some 
marginal effects are larger in magnitude or become significant only in the two-part specification, for 
instance derived average marginal effects for 'rule of law'. This can be seen as an argument for the 
existence of two distinct processes governing the likelihood of observing a positive stay rate at all and then 
the relative size of stayers' population. 155. 
Taken together, these findings suggest that participation opportunities in general, stability and 
reliability may influence staying decision. 156. 
Both modelling approaches, the competitiveness and the governance specification, lead to 
similar conclusions: Some persistent factors, e.g. historical links or linguistic similarities, are likely to 
influence staying behaviour heavily. Time-dependent aspects, such as per capita income, referring to 
wealth level differentials between destination and source country might only be partially relevant. 
Economic differentials might tip the scales, but are not necessarily major determinants on an aggregate 
level. Well educated and globally mobile international students are likely to find their niche in most 
economies. 157. 
Furthermore, findings on the aggregate level suggest that staying decisions are indeed linked to 
an assessment of individual opportunities. Those countries seen as more innovative are more attractive to 
international graduates. Institutional quality and the quality of political processes are plausible 
determinants of stay rates too. Just like other migrants, international students and graduates opt for a career 
start in the respective country offering more opportunities whilst providing an institutional environment 
suitable to sustain these prospects. DELSA/ELSA/WD/SEM(2016)12 47 5 CONSEQUENCES OF POST-GRADUATION STAYING BEHAVIOUR ON EUROPEAN 
ECONOMIES 158. 
Post-graduation mobility decisions of international students, i.e. the choice where they start 
their careers, clearly have important economic consequences. Aside from the mere question in which 
country they enter the labour market, their successful integration is relevant too. If their integration into a 
host country's labour force proves difficult, not only public acceptance of tertiary educated labour migrants 
might suffer but the economy would incur a loss as well -through a waste of international graduate 
stayers' potential and skills. 159. 
Aside from labour market related consequences, staying behaviour of international graduates 
has implications with respect to fiscal policy too. There might be plausible arguments linking the costs of 
providing education to international students and their post-graduation migration patterns. Beyond this, the 
ramifications of changing stay rates on other policy domains should be considered as well. 5.1 Labour market related consequences 160. 
The integration of international graduate stayers into the labour market will be evaluated based 
on descriptive statistics, derived from the EU-LFS. Available data, for most of the presented statistics, 
allows a distinction between EU and third country national stayers. This entails the opportunity to evaluate 
the degree of substitutability between these two distinct types of stayers. 161. 
This empirical examination is followed by a brief discussion of possible consequences of a shift 
in the tertiary educated labour supply, induced by an increasing stay rate of international students and 
graduates. 5.1.1 Labour market outcomes of stayers -LFS 162. 
Regarding labour market integration and outcomes of international student stayers 42 the EU-
LFS provides valuable insights. A direct comparison of stayers to their native peers (domestic graduate 
stayers), which graduated in the same year, allows a more in-depth analysis of employment outcomes in 
general but also with respect to sectorial differences or other distinguishing characteristics. 163. 
International graduates are just as successful regarding their labour market entrance as domestic 
graduates: one year after graduation there is no significant difference between the employment status of 
domestic graduate stayers and international graduate stayers 43 . 164. 
International graduate stayers (10.9%) do not face larger risks of being unemployed than their 
domestic peers (11.6 %). However, one should bear in mind that these international stayers might be 
positively selected, with skills in high demand, whilst international graduates who failed to find a job or 
who saw dim employment prospects already left the country. 165. 
International graduate stayers have a higher likelihood of receiving part-time contracts. This 
result is to a large extent driven by stayers from third countries, especially female graduates. There 
emerges also a noticeable difference regarding income deciles: international stayers have a slightly lower 
probability of reaching the two highest deciles and a higher probability of being in the lowest two deciles. 
The observed differences are not however significant at conventional levels. 42 Stayers are identified following the concept SR3, illustrated shortly in chapter 4.1. 43 The large share of inactive individuals is for EU graduate stayers, and especially for domestic graduates, 
mainly driven by those who are studying on or who are in further training after their first degree. DELSA/ELSA/WD/SEM(2016)12 48 Table 8. Labour market outcomes and characteristics by type of stayer, 2012 Outcome domestic

Percentages within the respective weighted subgroups are reported. P-values result from a design-based Chi squared test. 
If a p-value is smaller or equal to 0.10, the proportions of a respective international stayer group are assumed to be significantly 
different from the reference group of domestic stayers (*** p<0.01, ** p<0.05, * p<0.1). a weighted group sum is in 2012 below reliability threshold A (20000), thus not reported. 
b weighted group sum is in 2012 above reliability threshold A (20000) but below reliability threshold B (40000). 166. 
Accounting for job adequacy, indicated by occupational skill level, international graduates 
display a significantly higher likelihood of being employed in an occupation which requires only medium 
or low skills. Whereas only 1.9 % of domestic stayers find themselves in a low-skill occupation, the share 
of third country graduate stayers is 11.8 %. 167. 
Conditioning on the field of their university degree, EU graduate stayers differ significantly 
from their domestic counterparts too. They engaged significantly less likely in teacher training and 
education science (as seen in the general enrolment preferences) or in the field of social sciences, business 
and law. On the other hand, they graduated more often in the humanities, languages and arts. DELSA/ELSA/WD/SEM(2016)12 50 168. 
The preferred locational choice of international graduate stayers deviates clearly from domestic 
stayers' preferences. Third country graduate stayers, and even more so EU graduate stayers, prefer densely 
populated areas over intermediate or more rural ones. 169. 
Overall, international graduate stayers perform comparably well regarding the integration into a 
country's labour force. But as this brief analysis indicates, graduate stayers preferences and national or 
regional labour market needs do not necessarily coincide. International graduate stayers seem little inclined 
to reside outside of metropolitan areas, nor do they currently show signs of more pronounced preferences 
for a career in STEM fields (science, mathematics and computing or engineering, manufacturing and 
construction) or the area of health and welfare. 5.1.2 On the nexus of stay rates and skilled labour supply shifts 170. 
The question regarding a likely impact of a supply shift of tertiary educated labour on labour 
market outcomes for involved groups is an ample field of research in itself. This paragraph thus can neither 
provide a comprehensive overview over the state of current research nor can it present detailed empirical 
results. It serves merely to spotlight three relevant aspects in the nexus of international graduates' staying 
behaviour and labour market outcomes: permanence of supply shifts, the impact on wage levels and 
employment, and the unemployment of younger cohorts of tertiary educated labour. 171. 
Every international graduate who decides to stay in the country of graduation (or the EU) 
contributes to a marginal supply shift of tertiary educated labour. Abstracting from all other effects of such 
a supply shift, there still remains the question concerning the aspect of permanence: is an international 
graduate's decision to stay final or only part of a qualification process which increases human capital 
further before returning? 172. 
Literature provides some direct information regarding staying behaviour of internationally 
mobile graduates in a more dynamic context. For instance Finn (2012) reported for foreign PhD-holders in 
the USA five year stay rates which declined by eight percentage points on average compared to short-term 
rates. This decrease holds also for graduates in computer sciences and engineering, and it is even more 
pronounced for physical science and mathematics. 173. 
Similarly, figures presented by Van Bouwel (2010) pointed to a decrease of five to eight 
percentage points, depending on the source region of European PhD-holders graduating in the USA. For 
Denmark, Ministeriet for Forskning (2013) showed stay rates of international students three years after 
graduation to be six percentage points lower than after the first year. 174. 
Unsurprisingly, staying behaviour of internationally mobile students might only be temporary. 
Whilst some came initially to stay for good, others aimed at gathering some working experience and 
collect then the additional skill premium in a different labour market. As the previous chapter indicated, 
short-run stayers are likely to be positively selected, this might also hold true for sequential staying 
decisions in the medium-or long-run. 175. 
Nevertheless, the cohort of those who chose to stay at first will shrink over time, even in the so-
called STEM-fields which are typically mentioned in the context of alleged skill-shortages. If international 
graduates are sought to alleviate the impact of this kind of stated friction, it has to be kept in mind that only 
a fraction will be there to fulfil this role in the long-run. They are highly-skilled and have already proven to 
be highly mobile as well, so in the end, some of them will only be temporary migrants and not permanently 
provide their talent to the EU. 176. 
Turning to the second aspect, namely the connection between changing staying patterns and 
wages, one could try to infer whether status quo and recent wage trends might be conducive to a desired DELSA/ELSA/WD/SEM(2016)12 51 expansion of tertiary educated labour supply. Although purely monetary motives are not necessarily 
pivotal regarding staying decisions of international graduates, comparably higher wages at career start after 
graduation might nevertheless increase someone's inclination towards staying. On an aggregate level, this 
could then result in a broadening of tertiary educated labour supply. Figure 11. Changes of average hourly real wages for high-skilled young professional Source: Structure of earnings survey and HICP (Eurostat), own calculations Note: 
* 
the category's complete label is 'Education; human health and social work activities; arts, entertainment and 
recreation; other service activities' 
EU** refers to all 28 current EU members Average real wage changes have been derived as change of average hourly 
wages between 2002 and 2010 net consumer price changes, the latter taken from the HICP series (Harmonised Indices of 
Consumer Prices). High-skilled workers are identified based on the ISCO-08 classification. DELSA/ELSA/WD/SEM(2016)12 52 177. 
Figure 11 depicts the changes between 2002 and 2010 in hourly average real wages of high-
skilled employees for three different sectorial aggregates. The sample has been restricted to those below 30 
years of age to represent the entry ages after university graduation. 178. 
In almost all EU member states which acceded in the 2004 enlargement, average real wages 
surged. This can be attributed to a large extent to a catching-up process, since in 2010 the average hourly 
wages are still clearly below the wages in the old EU member states. 179. 
Most of the older EU member states experienced moderate real wage increases for young 
professionals. However, some of them welcomed high-skilled labour market entrants with decreasing real 
wages, with the United Kingdom leading the way. Here,  " each cohort of graduates since the financial crisis 
is earning less than the one before " .  " New graduates who earned £15,000 or more in 2011-12 – enough to 
start repaying their loans – were paid on average 12 per cent less in real terms than graduates at the same 
stage of their careers in 2007-08 "  (Financial Times, 2013). 180. 
For the EU as a whole, the picture looks similar: across all high-skilled occupations, real wages 
declined between 2002 and 2010 by 6.9 to 34.3 percent. This is not exclusively a result to the financial 
crisis: between 2002 and 2006 young professionals employed in the field of 'Education; human health and 
social work activities; arts, entertainment and recreation; other service activities' benefitted from a real 
average wage growth of 4.4 percent – while young high-skilled workers in the remaining eight groups 
experienced a decline of average real wages of 1.5 to 17.4 percent. 181. 
Real wage developments for young high-skilled professionals in the EU 15 raise doubt on the 
existence of a general labour shortage concerning high-skilled employees. Beyond, partly declining 
average real wages for this group will neither increase enrolment in tertiary education in general, nor 
improve the EU's retention capability with respect to international graduates. Instead, this adverse 
development suggests a relatively weaker demand for tertiary educated or high-skilled labour at an early 
career stage in the EU in the period examined. 182. 
The third aspect to be briefly highlighted are employment perspectives for internationally 
mobile graduates with respect to their risk of being unemployed. As previously shown, those who stayed 
upon graduation have almost identical unemployment rates than their domestic peers. This suggests that 
the sample of stayers is affected by a country's general labour market conditions in a similar manner as 
nationals. These general conditions have worsened from 2008 onwards on a broad scale. In most of the EU 
countries, tertiary educated (ISCED 5 and 6) individuals below age 40 faced in 2013 a much higher 
likelihood of being unemployed than they did five years ago (see Figure 12). 183. 
This adverse labour market environment was especially harsh for the age cohorts 20 to 24 and 
25 to 29 years, which is the typical age at which someone graduates from university. The unemployment 
rate of the youngest graduates reached 18.8 percent in 2013, for those aged 25 to 29 it was at 10.7 percent 
still the highest value since this series has been introduced. This general trend is also mirrored in some 
anecdotal evidence, highlighting that even a costly university education is no longer a guarantee for a 
smooth labour market entry: the top 100 employers in the UK offered in 2014 nine percent fewer graduate 
vacancies than before the crisis (Financial Times, 2013). 184. 
Under the currently prevailing circumstances in most EU countries, higher stay rates or 
especially higher absolute numbers of stayers would most likely not contribute to improving the labour 
market situation for tertiary educated entrants. This is also true in light of the fact that stayers' fields of 
graduation are not significantly different from those of their domestic peers -hence they offer a similar 
portfolio of qualification and skills. Taking recent years' unemployment trends and the similarity of DELSA/ELSA/WD/SEM(2016)12 53 international and domestic graduates into account, any first-glance impression of those two types of 
graduates being substitutes cannot be easily dismissed. If international graduates are supposed to 
strengthen the economic position of EU member states by providing their skills and talents, the general 
environment which enables them to do so should be improved. Figure 12. EU 28 unemployment rates for tertiary educated, by age Source: Eurostat, EU-LFS data 185. 
What are the general conclusion regarding the nexus of staying behaviour of international 
graduates and skilled labour supply shifts? Current labour market conditions, thus unemployment rates and 
remuneration trends, indicate relatively poor conditions for labour market entrants after graduation on the 
aggregate EU level. With some exceptions, international graduates are now facing in most EU countries 
less favourable labour market conditions than five to ten years ago. This in turn might translate into lower 
stay rates in the short-or medium term as highly-skilled and internationally mobile graduates attribute a 
dwindling attractiveness to the EU labour markets. 186. 
In addition, graduate stayers' initial study preferences are similar to those of domestic students. 
Hence it is rather unlikely that higher numbers of stayers translate immediately into substantially higher 
numbers of qualified job applicants in STEM occupations, especially in non-metropolitan areas. The 
underlying issue, a mismatch between applicants' study or location preferences and employers' demands, 
cannot be eradicated by unselective retention of international graduates. 5.2 General fiscal and demand-related implications of graduates' staying behaviour 187. 
Labour market outcomes of international graduate stayers have shown that stayers display an 
employment rate at least as high as the native comparison group. Such high shares regarding stayers' 
participation indicate that they constitute a relevant part of the highly skilled labour force. 188. 
If, furthermore, a host country has a high demand for tertiary educated labour, which cannot be 
satisfied by domestic supply, international graduate stayers' labour supply will be complementary. Hence, 
any additional graduate stayer would marginally contribute to an expansion of the host country's output -
and as employee to an increasing income tax base alike. 189. 
Moreover, these stayers display an unemployment rate similar to domestic graduates or below, 
hence they typically do not pose a burden to social security systems: amongst those graduates who one 
year after graduation are unemployed or inactive, 5.4 percent of domestic graduates and 5.1 percent of all 
international graduate stayers receive benefits or assistance. Restricting the sample to third country DELSA/ELSA/WD/SEM(2016)12 54 nationals who stay, 97.1 percent of unemployed or inactive stayers do not receive any social benefits or 
assistance whilst the same holds true for only 94.6 percent of domestic graduates. The design of social 
security benefits or assistance, most likely eligibility criteria, and the high employment rate of international 
stayers ensure that international stayers are from a relative point of view a lesser burden to EU social 
systems than domestic graduates. 190. 
International graduate stayers who are unemployed or inactive do still consume in the chosen 
country of residence, thus they contribute to the demand for commodity goods. This plausibly results in a 
marginal contribution to the respective country's GDP. At the same time, by means of value added 
commodity good and service taxation, they further contribute to municipal or governmental revenues. 191. 
If one extends the time horizon to comprise also periods prospective international graduates are 
still enrolled at university, the consumption argument holds of course already during studies. Vossensteyn 
et al. (2013) quote for example a weekly consumption level of 500 Australian Dollar for international 
students in Australia. They also report that international students in Canada spent in 2010 more than 7.7 
billion Dollars for tuition fees, accommodation and discretionary spending. NAFSA (2013) provides 
figures regarding the economic relevance of international students in the US: international students and 
their dependents contributed in the academic year 2012/2013 approximately 24 billion US-$ to the US 
economy and supported 313,000 jobs. For the UK, international students' contribution to the economy is 
assumed to be in the range of 12.5 billion British Pound. Over and above,  " for every ten international 
students, three full time equivalent jobs are created in the UK "  (House of Commons, 2011, p. 8). 192. 
Taken these facts together, the average graduate stayer can be expected to become already in 
the short-run not only a consumer, adding to internal demand, but also a fiscal net-contributor. 5.3 Funding of higher education and internationally mobile students 193. 
Before international stayers can contribute to a host country's economic prosperity after 
graduation, they already constitute a part of the overall demand for tertiary education. For a couple of 
countries, this fraction amounts to more than ten percent of total enrolment (see Table A. 2). This has 
further fiscal implications regarding the funding of higher education. 194. 
Some countries, for instance the UK, charge higher tuition fees from non-EU students. Others, 
aside from administrative fees, provide access to higher education for all students free of tuition fees. The 
first group of countries not only manages to recover marginal costs of providing tertiary education to a 
third country student but also to lessen fiscal restrictions regarding the funding of higher education 
institutions in general. In fact, this might even result in a successful sort of cross-subsidising tertiary 
education for domestic students 44 by attracting international students (Findlay, 2011, p. 178). In the 
absence of capacity constraints, any additional international student generates an immediate fiscal gain. 195. 
This outcome is partially efficient since those who benefit personally from a high quality 
education system also shoulder associated costs. On the other hand it might be partially inefficient as well: 
if international fee paying students decide to stay upon graduation, then the host country would benefit 
from a privately funded human capital investment. This kind of positive externality might imply an 44 The claim that this is a non-negligible case of cross-subsidising is supported by figures from the 
academic year 2005/2006. According to House of Lords (2008, p. 512), non-EU domiciled students paid 
fees of approximately GBP 1.5 billion, which amounted to 8% of the higher education sector's total 
funding in the UK. DELSA/ELSA/WD/SEM(2016)12 55 initially too low private investment in education, and the higher the stay rate, the larger the overall impact 
of this externality might become. 196. 
For the second group of countries, the immediate net effect is not as unambiguous. Accounting 
only for the purely fiscal aspect of funding tertiary education in a short-run, any additional international 
student will lead to a marginal increase of public expenditure. Thus, from a merely fiscal point, if 
consumption levels of international students were low, e.g. due to individual financial constraints, and they 
had complete access to all public services, the governmental budget might incur a net loss due to an 
international student. This however can change in the medium-to long-run, mainly depending on whether 
international students stay after graduation and successfully integrate themselves into the labour force or 
not. Here, the post-graduation stay rates are of key interest. 197. 
Referring to previous considerations with respect to fiscal or economic net contributions after 
graduation, the higher the stay rate, the faster or more likely previous public expenditures can be 
recovered. Both cases, referring to the extremes of the basic funding alternatives (private versus public), 
lead to the conclusion that an optimal fiscal policy should neither focus exclusively on minimising fiscal 
burden of providing tertiary education to international students nor on maximising subsequently generated 
additional (income) tax revenues. 198. 
In the presence of highly mobile international graduates, the overall fiscal outcome would not 
only be determined by education policy competition but also by tax competition between host countries. In 
this context, Krieger and Lange (2010) discuss in a fiscal competition model the impact of student and 
labour mobility. They model the mechanisms of interconnected student and graduate mobility on the one 
side and education expenditures and tax rates on the other. Amongst other findings, they establish a 
relationship between international graduates' tax sensitivity and decreasing overall net revenues. This 
effect is mainly driven by a comparative cost advantage when it comes to migration, which allows 
international graduates to leave high taxation countries more easily. This tax base erosion can only 
partially be offset by lowering education expenditure or increasing fees. 199. 
In an alternative modelling approach Lange (2013) aims at explaining the impact of changing 
stay rates on optimal tuition fees if some net gains already accrue to the host country during international 
students' study period. This was for example the case if costs of tertiary education in relation to students' 
consumption levels were sufficiently low. If international students correctly anticipate, at the time of their 
initial study choice, a low post-graduation staying probability, their demand for tertiary education abroad 
reacts more sensitively to changes in tuition fees. If international students generate public net gains already 
during studies, lowering tuition fees in case of declining stay rates would be the optimal policy. 200. 
The outcome changes however, if international students had irrational, i.e. overly optimistic 
expectations regarding the possibility to stay. If they assume to be able to reap the benefits from a high 
quality education and favourable labour market outcomes in the host country in any case, their demand for 
foreign education is less elastic with respect to tuition fees. Here, rising tuition fees and simultaneously 
declining stay rates might still increase governments' net revenues. Both approaches provide strong 
arguments in favour of a high importance of international students' choice sensitivity regarding host 
countries tuition fees and expectations regarding post-graduation opportunities. 201. 
Poutvaara (2008) incorporated the fact that tertiary education may not be equally transferable 
across countries: for example degrees in law may have a rather national relevance, whereas degrees in 
natural sciences should be applicable in an international context – principles of quantum physics do not 
change depending on which side of a border they have been taught, yet paragraphs in fiscal law are likely 
to differ. He established that the national public provision of internationally applicable education, yielding 
positive externalities for other countries as well (due to graduate mobility, fostered e.g. by mobility DELSA/ELSA/WD/SEM(2016)12 56 programmes), could remain strictly below a global optimum. A possible suggested solution was the 
introduction of a graduate tax, accruing to the country where a possibly mobile graduate acquired her 
university degree. 202. 
A further extension was investigated by Delpierre and Verheyden (2014) who addressed also 
quality of provided education and location preferences of graduates. Optimal funding schemes could 
change in the presence of potentially conflicting priorities of universities and governments. Universities 
might engage in competition for (international) students, by raising quality, whilst governments aimed at 
maximising an economy's output under fiscal competition. Some resulting inefficiencies, e.g. 
underinvestment in human capital if workers are mobile, could be remedied by transnational transfers for 
mobile students. 203. 
Theoretical models' mechanisms and previously presented empirical evidence underscore the 
economic relevance of international students for a host country. Yet, when it comes to defining policy 
measures regarding international students' enrolment, all associated decisions will be made between 
conflicting priorities of fiscal goals, revenue or output maximising aspects in the short-and long-run, 
socio-political necessities and other policy fields. 204. 
The complexity of determining an optimal policy (mix) can be easily demonstrated: Higher 
tuition fees for international students might relax short-run fiscal constraints at the cost of lower enrolment 
numbers if students' demand for foreign education is price sensitive. But this in turn might hamper the 
generation of future revenues or economic output, by negatively affecting the overall number of 
prospective stayers 205. 
Low tuition fees in contrast could be a suitable policy to attract in a first step brains to fuel the 
knowledge economy. If post-graduation stay rates were at the same time low, this might indicate a certain 
degree of free-riding. Yet, if the policy goal was to export higher education -jointly with low or no tuition 
fees at all, this could be seen as part of a host country's development assistance -low stay rates for 
international students from developing countries would then indicate a rather successful outcome. As it 
happens, achieving this latter goal seems difficult, as there is evidence that even setting quotas, and 
defining scholarship schemes to foster return to developing countries often fail their purpose (Brekke, 
2006; Hein and Plesch, 2008). 206. 
This chapter prompts the conclusion that any measure directly or indirectly targeting 
international students' stay rates should only be implemented after having clearly defined a country's 
policy priorities. Increasing stay rates by all means may produce the desired advantageous result in one 
policy domain, but at the same time come at the price of impairment in another field. DELSA/ELSA/WD/SEM(2016)12 57 6 POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS 207. 
Empirical results from this study, as well as established findings in the migration literature may 
now serve as point of reference for the derivation of policy recommendations. Presented suggestions 
concern two major questions: how to increase the number of stayers -thus stimulate associated positive 
economic outcomes, and which measures to promote for a reliable investigation of future dynamics? 208. 
Answers to the first question address directly the goal of turning international students' 
potential and skills into real gains for the EU in the medium and long-run and these answers might have 
immediate practical implications. Here, the ever present underlying assumption is that higher stay rates 
translate into real socio-economic net gains. The second question is more a technical one, but nevertheless 
an important aspect if internationally mobile students' staying behaviour or the effectiveness of intertwined 
policies shall be evaluated more precisely. 6.1 Measures to foster international students' attachment to the European host country 209. 
Although some plausible determinants of stay rates have been identified, not all empirical 
findings may be translated into tangible policy measures: for instance, it is just not possible to reduce 
geographical distance between a country of origin and a destination country. Nevertheless, there might be 
some policies which have the potential to strengthen the EU's retention capabilities by increasing 
countries' or individuals' 'proximity' in other domains, e.g. in the sense of reducing barriers to integration 
and by lowering associated costs. 210. 
The overarching goal has to be to foster international students' attachment to EU host countries 
and to facilitate integration in general as well as into the labour market in particular. As the main leverage 
points for retaining talents in the EU have been identified the following aspects: 1. Group specific recruitment International students from some countries of origin display a higher inclination towards staying in the 
EU than others. Furthermore, focusing on undergraduate international students implies that these 
students have more time to get familiar with a host country's culture, language and administrative 
procedures. This in turn reduces the effective (and perceived) obstacles for staying after graduation. Recruiting and educating more of these likely stayers would then subsequently translate into higher 
numbers of stayers. 2. Granting funding for advanced studies 
Scholarship programmes' negative monetary incentives, i.e. to induce return after graduation, appear 
to be ineffective. The other way round, providing funding to doctoral students and offering them the 
opportunity to become more familiar with host country specific research fields strengthens their 
attachment to the host country and reduces financial insecurity. Funding schemes could be 
concentrated in those areas which are perceived to suffer from a certain 'brain' shortage. This might 
be achievable within the framework of the Marie Skłodowska-Curie actions and explicitly address 
international students at the end of their masters' programme, just when they decide whether to stay or 
to return. Most importantly, funding opportunities have to be made publicly known in the designated 
target group. 3. Language courses 
Even if more and more study programmes are taught in English, most EU countries' business and 
daily life language is not English. Offering more intensive high-quality language courses and setting 
incentives for participation during studies will reduce actual or perceived comparative disadvantages 
regarding employment. As taking additional courses implies higher workload, an integration of these DELSA/ELSA/WD/SEM(2016)12 58 courses into the ECTS system deems advisable. As such courses foster social inclusion, tapping the 
European Social Fund to support high-quality language courses at universities or for university 
students could be a feasible solution. 4. Labour market policies As the analysis of labour market outcomes has shown, there are some dimensions where international 
graduate stayers find themselves in a less favourable situation: they tend to be more often in part-time 
and less adequate employment, considering their educational attainment. Here, providing additional 
support, e.g. by financing seminars specifically designed for introducing international students to 
national peculiarities of an application process, might improve their integration into the labour market. Moreover, all essential information from employment agencies should be available not solely in the 
national language, but at least in English or other major languages. This would facilitate the 
understanding of administrative procedures and job search itself. From a general point of view, there remain also some policy issues on the macro level: although 
international graduate stayers are willing and able to integrate themselves into a host country's labour 
market, their willingness to stay is certainly depending on the specific labour market situation. Current 
labour market conditions in some larger EU countries signal however a certain degree of saturation 
regarding tertiary educated labour. If more international graduates are to be kept in order to cope with 
future demographic trends, these underlying adverse labour market conditions for young professionals 
should be addressed first. 5. Political stability and participation Empirical findings indicate that stay rates are higher in politically stable countries and those where the 
possibility for political participation is more pronounced. Whilst the first aspect can be seen as 
guaranteed in any EU member state, more participation opportunities for third country nationals might 
improve their inclination towards staying: if a foreign national contributes to a country's economic 
and social success he or she should also be given a voice. In this regard, a harmonization of EU 
nationals' and third country nationals' rights would represent a credible commitment. 6. Institutional design and governance Properly working institutions, which handle administrative procedures not only transparently but also 
promptly, are important. For instance, if the processing of visa takes too long, an international 
graduate who would have otherwise found skill-adequate employment in the host country might take 
up a job offer in the country of origin. Furthermore, administrative processes should be designed in 
such a way that they can be understood and appropriately prepared by someone who is not familiar 
with country-specific administrative hurdles. 7. Innovative and competitive environment Keeping the brightest requires being able to offer them an interesting and challenging working or 
living environment. This holds especially true when it comes to graduates in the technical or 
engineering field, and especially for researchers -keeping their ideas means providing them with an 
opportunity to realise these ideas. This in turn strengthens the importance of preserving or even 
increasing technological competitiveness: private and public R&D expenditures have to mirror such 
an aspiration. Furthermore, a research and innovation friendly environment – in a political and social 
dimension alike – is important as well. 211. 
Potential graduate stayers have probably gained some experience with respect to the 
performance of a host country in some of the above mentioned domains. Being well educated, highly 
mobile and possibly also being a sought employee abroad, they will base their decision to stay to a large 
extent on whether a respective EU member state meets their expectations or not. In the end it is not about DELSA/ELSA/WD/SEM(2016)12 59 announcing a welcoming culture but about adopting concrete measures which actually translate into a 
working and living environment offering real opportunities for those we want to stay. 6.2 Monitoring international graduates' residential choices 212. 
Previous chapters' elaborations adverted briefly to some drawbacks regarding the various 
methods to assess international graduates' staying behaviour. Aside from general reliability issues, 
insufficient data coverage and harmonization have been identified as additional limitations in the extended 
version of this paper. Furthermore, all investigated calculation methods can only provide information with 
respect to short-term staying behaviour. 213. 
Especially the latter deserves some additional considerations as such short-term outcomes might 
be poor predictors for medium-or long-term staying behaviour: if studying abroad and starting the career 
abroad is only seen as one way to increase human capital, e.g. by acquiring international experience, the 
return to a country of origin might have been always part of an individual career plan (Perkins and 
Neumayer, 2013; Findlay et al., 2012). Consequently, short-term stay rates in EU countries might be high 
whilst long-term rates could be very low. This implies that those who have been educated in an EU 
country, gathered country-specific human capital and first practical working experience were afterwards 
likely to leave – probably exactly at a point where they reached a high productivity level. 214. 
Hence, for the EU to benefit from international graduates' in an extensive way, the goal should 
not be to concentrate exclusively on short-term staying behaviour, but to ensure that the EU remains 
attractive for these individuals for a longer period. Yet, to evaluate whether the EU achieves this objective, 
reliable medium-and long-term stay rates have to be derived. At the present state it is infeasible to obtain 
such measures on the scale of the EU due to a lack of adequate data. In the following, two possible 
approaches to resolve this issue are briefly sketched. 1. Augmenting EU-LFS The basic issue regarding the identification of stayers in the LFS is related to the country of university 
graduation. Currently, it can only be inferred one year after graduation via country of residence at the 
graduation year – this implies directly its short-term nature. If the basic set of items regarding highest 
education attained (level, field and year) was supplemented by 'region of graduation', international 
graduates would be easier to identify and trace over time. This basic adjustment would remove all 
doubts regarding the identification of stayers amongst the set of internationally mobile students. Although such a modification would constitute a significant improvement, only a partial picture of 
international graduates' mobility could be derived, namely cohort-specific stay rates for í µí± and í µí± − 1 
years after graduation. Additional elicitation of the region of work or residence in the year after 
graduation would further allow determining a cohorts' short-run stay rate, even if some time has 
elapsed between graduation and respective survey year. Two remarks remain: First, the larger í µí± the fewer stayers can be expected. This might conflict with 
reliability thresholds once again. Second, this simple modification would not enable any inference 
regarding mobility or migratory events after the first year after graduation and before year í µí± − 1. 
Nevertheless it constituted a substantial improvement regarding capturing more facets of dynamic 
staying behaviour in the EU-LFS. 2. Harmonized graduate survey on the national level To avoid the underlying pitfalls related to usage of EU-LFS data, a graduate survey could be suitable 
to derive short-and medium-run stay rates. Since a survey targeting potentially highly mobile 
individuals suffers probably from high non-response, likely to increase over time, and small sample 
size, a special procedure is proposed: implementation as an event history calendar for international DELSA/ELSA/WD/SEM(2016)12 60 graduates from nationally representative universities. The so-called event history calendar (Sage et al., 
2013) can be set up as an online-based tool which asks participants to report status changes. These 
changes may cover changes of employment status, residence change but also cover other topics of 
interest, which allows then an analysis with respect to determinants of staying (or returning) behaviour 
on the subject level. Such an approach would in fact account for detailed mobility-related experiences 
in a medium-term time horizon, for example three to five years. Participants, however, should be offered some incentive to report changes constantly and to avoid 
increasing non-response levels. This necessity implies that a restriction to a subset of universities was 
unavoidable. These participating universities should host an international student body of substantial 
size whilst offering a wide range of programmes and fields of study. A positive and required by-
product of involving specific universities is that university-specific numbers of international 
graduates, possibly even by field and sex, could be obtained concurrently. Whilst the first approach would be easier to implement, as it does not involve the development of a specific 
tool on the European level, the second was suitable to deliver more detailed insights into sub-groups' 
staying behaviour. Furthermore, detailed determinants of international graduates' mobility could be 
investigated as well. Both approaches would constitute a significant improvement to the current state regarding the examination 
of dynamic staying behaviour of international students and graduates. If we want to understand what 
makes them stay in a longer perspective, we need a reliable and transnationally comparable data source. 7 SUMMARY 215. 
This report investigated the preferences of internationally mobile students with a special focus 
on post-graduation mobility. The key findings emerging during this research project, as well as the main 
implications will be briefly summarised below. 216. 
Some stylised facts on the distribution of internationally mobile students in the EU:  With almost 1.5 million international students enrolled in 2012, the 28 EU countries constitute still the 
most attractive destination area for studying abroad -38 percent of all internationally mobile students 
chose the EU in 2012. However, Asian destination countries are becoming increasingly more popular. 
 Approximately two thirds of internationally mobile students in the EU come from outside the EU. 
 Students from Asia and Latin America choose the EU as a destination much more frequently than 10 
years ago. This mirrors the growing importance of these countries in the global context. 
 Some EU countries are primarily destinations in the context of intra-EU mobility (Austria, Belgium, 
Czech Republic, Estonia, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Slovakia). Others are especially attractive 
for students from non-EU and non-OECD countries, as the composition of their international student 
body displays (Croatia, Finland, France, Italy, Lithuania and Sweden). 
 Geographical proximity, historical ties and language similarities seem to contribute in a substantial way 
to students' country preferences. 
 Some countries, in particular (?)their higher education institutions, attract male and female students in 
different ways, which is likely associated with the curriculum offered by study programmes. 
 Aside from some Eastern European countries, the preferred field of study is social sciences, business 
and law. Most frequently chosen studies in these Eastern EU members belong to the field of health 
and welfare. DELSA/ELSA/WD/SEM(2016)12 61 217. 
The main insights from the exploratory study part 45 concern the identification and discussion of 
internationally mobile students' staying behaviour:  Typically, measures of staying or returning behaviour of internationally mobile students in the 
literature vary drastically for destination countries. This variation originates from a multitude of 
sources, such as countries of origin, reference year, time horizon, calculation procedure, underlying 
data source and type of student (e.g. Germany: 9 – 77.5%, the Netherlands: 29 – 94%, United 
Kingdom: 3 – 64%). 
 More than a dozen alternative calculation methods were evaluated in the context of EU destination 
countries. Some of these examined methods generated for over 170 countries of origin specific stay 
rates. 
 Within the exploratory study, a substantial degree of between-method variation could be observed on 
the EU member state level. This phenomenon is mainly driven by small sample sizes, data quality and 
partial violation of required assumptions. To mitigate stay rates' sensitivity to those issues, stay rates 
have been constructed in most cases as three year average over the years 2010 to 2012. 
 For the EU as a whole, aggregate stay rates from stayers from all non-EU source countries lie within a 
range of 16.4 to 29.1%. 
 Derived stay rates on the EU level are especially high for students from North-Western Africa and the 
Commonwealth of Independent States. Large enrolment numbers do not automatically imply high stay 
rates; for instance Chinese students, being by far the largest group, display only a stay rate between 
13.7 and 15.5%. 
 Current data sources only allow assessing short-term stay rates (6-12 months after the end of studies), 
this implies that the dynamic nature of subsequent staying decisions at a later career stage cannot be 
analysed. 218. 
Taking into account potential shortcomings of permit based stay rates these bilateral measures 
nevertheless offer the opportunity to investigate potential determinants of staying behaviour. The most 
essential results are the following ones:  Internationally mobile students see their studies abroad as an integral part of their career path. 
Subsequent staying decisions are not taken lightly but made in light of perceived opportunities. 
 Addressing the impact of perceived opportunities by observable differences between destination and 
source countries in socio-economic or socio-political dimensions provides valuable insights on an 
aggregate level. 
 Similarity between host and source countries' language are associated with higher stay rates. A larger 
distance between these countries, reflecting higher monetary costs of migration and lower degrees of 
cultural proximity, is indicative of lower stay rates. 
 Assuming that internationally mobile students base their staying or returning decision purely on 
economic differentials around their graduation might be too short-sighted. 
 Higher general unemployment has not necessarily a deterring effect. Tertiary educated workers might 
still be able to find employment in a niche, according to their qualification. 
 If an EU host country scores better regarding institutional quality and governance effectiveness, higher 
stay rates can be observed. This gives rise to the claim that stayers prefer a 'reliable' business or daily 
life environment. 
 In a similar manner, higher scores regarding technological readiness and innovation serve as predictors 
for higher stay rates. 
 Living circumstances in general have to be considered as relevant factors as well – more pronounced 
levels of political stability and absence of violence are associated with more likely staying decisions. 45 Details can be found in the full version of this paper. DELSA/ELSA/WD/SEM(2016)12 62 But if (political) participation opportunities are more developed in the home country, return becomes 
more likely. 
 These possible determinants deliver a plausible explanation why stay rates amongst students from other 
OECD countries are typically very low and stay rates from students from less developed or politically 
less stable countries are much higher. 219. 
Examining the impact of post-graduation staying decision on European economies allowed 
drawing the following conclusions:  Regarding labour market outcomes, those internationally mobile students who decide to stay are likely 
to be positively selected, especially if permission to stay is only granted in case of employment. 
 International stayers have an employment rate which is at least as high as for their domestic peers. 
Unemployment is also not more frequent amongst stayers. The subsample of stayers from other EU 
countries is more often self-employed. 
 Part-time employment is more widespread amongst international stayers, partially due to the fact that 
this group consists to a larger extent of married women. A positive selection of stayers explains also 
why they have a higher likelihood of having found permanent employment. 
 Whilst there are no significant differences regarding income, international stayers face a much higher 
probability of working in a job requiring only medium or low skills. This is mainly driven by stayers 
from non-EU countries and points to problematic skill mismatches. 
 Fields of study and preferred residential locations of international stayers lead to the conclusion that 
they have a low inclination towards selecting themselves into labour market segments with alleged 
shortages – they strictly prefer metropolitan areas and are not more likely to have graduated in the 
fields of  " science, mathematics and computing " ,  " engineering, manufacturing and construction "  or 
 " health and welfare " . 
 Current labour market conditions, i.e. increasing unemployment rates for tertiary educated labour 
below 30 years of age and declining real wages for young professionals in some larger EU economies, 
are neither favourable nor fostering the attractiveness of the EU labour market(s). 
 International stayers can be expected to become net contributors to EU economies by no later than 
graduation. But already during their studies, their consumption of commodity and services adds to the 
host country's demand. 
 Fiscal implications of providing funding for the education of internationally mobile students and 
related inefficiencies due to externalities could be taken into account, for instance by conditioning 
subsidies on subsequent staying behaviour. 220. 
Considering all above mentioned findings, two main policy recommendations can be distilled. 
The first one refers to structural data deficiencies which prevent a more in-depth analysis: to broaden 
analytical possibilities in this line of research, the harmonisation of existing data series should be 
promoted. Relevant dynamic aspects, regarding the retention of internationally mobile students after 
graduation in a medium-or long-run, can only be addressed if either the EU-LFS is slightly extended or a 
representative sample of international graduates participates in an online based survey. But, once again 
referring to the introductory Wilson quote, exactly such a medium-to long-term analysis enables to assess 
for how long the EU can 'borrow' the brains of internationally mobile academics. 221. 
The second recommendation encompasses a catalogue of measures to boost the EU's 
attractiveness, hence to increase stay rates. Proposed policy measures draw on a smooth labour market 
integration of international graduates by setting further incentives to remove language barriers already 
during studies or providing support regarding country-specific labour market peculiarities. Actively 
supporting post-graduate studies seems to be another promising way to increase retention of international 
talents in a medium-run. At the same time, the EU and all its members are well advised not only to 
maintain, but to cultivate their strong points: political stability and participation possibilities, reliable 
institutions and governance structure, as well as an innovative and competitive environment – all these DELSA/ELSA/WD/SEM(2016)12 63 aspects exert a non-negligible influence on the decision to stay of highly-skilled, but also highly-mobile, 
individuals. 222. 
If we want to turn the potential, ensuing from a huge pool of internationally mobile students, 
into real and lasting gains for the EU, we should provide these individuals with long-term perspectives, not 
only long-term permits. DELSA/ELSA/WD/SEM(2016)12 64 REFERENCES Achato, Lorrah, Mike Eaton and Chis Jones (2011): The migrant journey. Second report; Research Report

Reported values for GGOFF and RESET are p-values. P-values of the GGOFF (Generalized Goodness of Functional Form) below a chosen threshold, e.g. 10%, indicate that the 
chosen link function should be rejected at this level. The RESET test is based on í µí°¸[í µí±í µí±|í µí±, í µí»½, í µí»¾] = í µí°º[í µí±í µí»½ + ∑ í µí»¾ í µí± (í µí±í µí»½) í µí±+1 í µí°½

Reported values for GGOFF and RESET are p-values. P-values of the GGOFF (Generalized Goodness of Functional Form) below a chosen threshold, e.g. 10%, indicate that the 
chosen link function should be rejected at this level. The RESET test is based on í µí°¸[í µí±í µí±|í µí±, í µí»½, í µí»¾] = í µí°º[í µí±í µí»½ + ∑ í µí»¾ í µí± (í µí±í µí»½) í µí±+1 í µí°½ 
í µí±=1 ] with G[.] as the respective link function. RESET (2) tests for 
í µí»¾ 1 = 0, RESET (3) for í µí»¾ 1 = í µí»¾ 2 = 0. Rejection of the Null points to misspecification.
