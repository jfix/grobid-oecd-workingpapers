			<head>ABSTRACT<lb/></head>

			<p>Offshoring of business process services (BPS) and information technology services (ITS) –<lb/> whether through international insourcing or international outsourcing – is transforming the way many<lb/> companies do business. This paper looks at the expansion of international supply chains and the rise of<lb/> China, the Czech Republic, India and the Philippines as exporters of BPS and ITS. It also analyses the<lb/> nature of and factors behind this trade and identifies major business-and trade-related challenges arising.<lb/> In this context it presents some of the labour market implications resulting from increasing trade between<lb/> OECD and non-OECD economies.<lb/></p>

			<p>The analysis shows that the BPS and ITS sectors in the four emerging economies are very<lb/> differently structured: Chinese and Czech companies are predominantly supplying their domestic markets<lb/> while Indian and Philippine companies are focused mainly on supplying foreign markets. In terms of<lb/> exports, they also supply different geographies: China is mainly exporting to Japan; the Czech Republic to<lb/> the European Union; the Philippines to the United States; and India to the United States and UK. Several of<lb/> the larger home-grown companies in the four countries are establishing significant presence in foreign<lb/> markets, in particular in other emerging markets, to build capacity and leverage local comparative<lb/> advantage. This highlights the fact that different geographies have different strengths and BPS and ITS-<lb/>related FDI between emerging economies is likely to expand rapidly in the future.<lb/> All four countries are facing supply side constraints. The low supply of senior personnel with<lb/> industry-relevant experience in China, the Czech Republic and the Philippines acts as a break on growth.<lb/> Many companies are also struggling to manage high levels of staff attrition and salary inflation. Regulatory<lb/> restrictions are relatively few but still affect some companies. In the ITS sector, temporary movement of<lb/> personnel can pose a significant challenge for home-grown exporters. The issue is most relevant for the<lb/> Indian ITS sector that is dependent on sending professionals for longer visits to client premises. Slow and<lb/> unpredictable procedures for issuing business visas and work permits, and quota limitations for work<lb/> permits, give rise to operational challenges. In the BPS sector, and to a lesser extent in the ITS sector, data<lb/> privacy and security legislation can have a negative effect on international outsourcing. But new<lb/> regulations have also created entirely new business opportunities, including the medical transcription<lb/> sector.<lb/></p>

			<p>Business process services (BPS) and information technology services (ITS) are increasingly<lb/> traded between emerging markets and OECD countries. While trade in these services has recently<lb/> expanded significantly, this has been from relatively modest absolute levels. China, the Czech Republic,<lb/> India and the Philippines are leading emerging market exporters in this area. In 2005, their combined<lb/> export revenue was an estimated US$ 8.7 billion for BPS and US$ 14.5 billion for ITS. This represented<lb/> roughly 2-3 percent of worldwide BPS and ITS spending and OECD countries imported the great majority<lb/> of these services.<lb/></p>

			<p>As part of OECD&apos;s ongoing work on Globalisation and Structural Adjustment, this paper<lb/> analyses the expansion of international supply chains and the rise of China, the Czech Republic, India and<lb/> the Philippines as exporters of BPS and ITS. It aims to provide a clearer picture of the nature of and factors<lb/> behind new international supply chains in these sectors and identify major business-and trade-related<lb/> challenges arising. In this context it presents some of the labour market implications resulting from<lb/> increasing trade between OECD and non-OECD economies.<lb/> The BPS and ITS sectors in the four countries enjoy access to stable ICT infrastructure and a<lb/> highly educated and language proficient workforce, which allow them to serve foreign markets. They also<lb/> benefit from a set of other enabling factors that facilitate their business. First, the countries have generally<lb/> established zones with dedicated infrastructure and streamlined administration to overcome local<lb/> weaknesses in the business environment. While broader liberalisation for input services and more effective<lb/> business regulations would render such zones unnecessary and benefit the economy as a whole, these<lb/> zones have removed most of the excessive regulatory burden that hold companies back and ensured access<lb/> to necessary input services.<lb/> Second, governments have ensured liberal rules for foreign direct investment (FDI), which has<lb/> allowed foreign multinationals to establish captive units, or joint service centres, to provide BPS and ITS<lb/> services to foreign markets. This has with time generated substantial transfers of technology and<lb/> management practises. Finally, open markets for cross-border supply and few regulatory restrictions in<lb/> client countries have made it possible for companies in emerging markets to deliver BPS and ITS to<lb/> international markets.<lb/> The findings in the country studies show that the BPS and ITS sectors in the four countries are<lb/> very differently structured: while only 10-15 percent of BPS and ITS supply are exported in China and the<lb/> Czech Republic, almost 80 percent of Indian and Philippine BPS and ITS are aimed for foreign markets.<lb/> They also supply different geographies: China is mainly exporting to Japan and the East Asia region; the<lb/> Czech Republic to EU countries; the Philippines to the United States; and India to the United States, UK,<lb/> and to a lesser extent to other OECD markets. This highlights that language proximity is a decisive factor<lb/> in the decision making process of where to source BPS and ITS.<lb/> Trade in BPS and ITS is dominated by OECD-based multinationals but home-grown companies<lb/> in non-OECD economies are rising in prominence. Czech and Philippine BPS and ITS exports are mainly<lb/> provided by foreign multinationals. In China and India, BPS and ITS exports are provided rather more<lb/> equally between home-grown and foreign-owned companies.<lb/> India is leading the way among the emerging markets with a mature and internationally<lb/> competitive ITS sector. The home-grown Indian ITS sector has managed to create a successful business<lb/> model based on a &apos;global delivery model&apos;, which makes use of a combination of cross-border supply and<lb/> temporary labour migration. Several of the larger home-grown companies in the four countries are<lb/> establishing significant presence in other markets, in particular in other emerging markets, to build<lb/> capacity and leverage local comparative advantage. This highlights the fact that different geographies have<lb/> different strengths and BPS and ITS-related FDI between emerging economies is likely to expand rapidly<lb/> in the future. There are also indications that south-south trade is about to gain in influence in some niche<lb/> markets.<lb/></p>

			<p>The market for internationally sourced BPS is young, fast growing and competition is more even<lb/> between the four countries than for ITS. India is the largest supplier but the Philippines has become a<lb/> strong contender for services in English, in particular for voice-based services. All four countries are likely<lb/> to continue to expand their export-oriented BPS sectors in the future. Some trend-setting multinationals<lb/> already use all four countries to deliver BPS to geographies where languages match.<lb/></p>

			<p>The four countries face increasing supply side constraints in their quest to provide BPS and ITS<lb/> to international markets. Strong demand has resulted in high attrition rates and salary inflation that some<lb/> companies struggle to manage. In the ITS sector, it also takes significant investment in training to make<lb/> young professionals productive, which makes staff retention key. The availability of senior personnel with<lb/> industry-relevant experience is low in China, the Czech Republic and the Philippines, which acts as a break<lb/> on growth.<lb/> Regulatory restrictions are relatively few but still affect some companies. In the ITS sector,<lb/> temporary movement of personnel can pose a significant challenge for home-grown exporters. The issue is<lb/> most relevant for the Indian ITS sector that is dependent on sending professionals for longer visits to client<lb/> premises. Slow and unpredictable procedures for issuing business visas and work permits, and quota<lb/> limitations for work permits, give rise to operational challenges for Indian companies.<lb/></p>

			<p>In the BPS sector, and to a lesser extent in the ITS sector, data privacy and security legislation<lb/> can have a negative effect on international outsourcing. But new regulations have also created entirely new<lb/> business opportunities, including the medical transcription sector. Data privacy and security regulations are<lb/> not necessarily negative as long as they are non-discriminatory in nature. Technological solutions allow<lb/> companies in most instances to comply with the rules and clients generally require their suppliers to live up<lb/> to standards that are higher than existing legislation.<lb/></p>

			<p>The integration of large countries, like China and India, in the world economy creates huge<lb/> opportunities for companies in the OECD area to access new markets. It also enables them to access new<lb/> talent to perform tasks in vertically fragmented value chains, including for BPS and ITS. While most work<lb/> tasks cannot be performed in remote places with a business model that is economically compelling and<lb/> delivers adequate service quality, international competition gives rise to job insecurity for some workers<lb/> that used to be cushioned from such pressures. This indicates that trade liberalisation needs to be<lb/> accompanied by sound labour market policies that facilitate reallocation of workers to more productive<lb/> employment and help their citizens reap the gains from trade.<lb/> The ITS sector in high-income countries may face less adjustment pressure than some initially<lb/> feared. The reasons are that international competition is only applied to certain types of services – such as<lb/> application development and maintenance – and the annual growth in worldwide demand for ITS is<lb/> expected to exceed new supply capacity from low-income countries for the foreseeable future. While<lb/> absolute levels of employment is unlikely to drop in the ITS sector, OECD markets may well see a shift in<lb/> the demand for some job occupations within the ITS sector as it recruits more highly skilled workers for<lb/> the supply of higher value services.<lb/></p>

			<head>INTRODUCTION<lb/> 1.<lb/> Business</head>

			<p>process services (BPS) and information technology services (ITS) are increasingly<lb/> traded between emerging markets and OECD countries. While trade in these services has recently<lb/> expanded significantly, this has been from relatively modest absolute levels. Worldwide spending on BPS<lb/> and ITS was approximately US$ 836 billion in 2005 and the great majority of trade takes place between<lb/> OECD countries. 1 Exports from the four countries studied in this paper – China, the Czech Republic, India<lb/> and the Philippines – made up around 2-3 percent of worldwide BPS and ITS spending. These countries<lb/> were all providing the necessary combination of stable ICT infrastructure, liberal rules for foreign direct<lb/> investment (FDI) and a highly educated and language proficient workforce. Yet only in India and the<lb/> Philippines have the BPS and ITS sectors become significant sources of export revenue and job creation.<lb/> India is leading the way with approximately 60 percent of the offshore market for trade in BPS and ITS<lb/> (<ref type="biblio">Citigroup, 2005</ref>).<lb/> 2.<lb/> International sourcing of BPS and ITS offers significant labour-cost arbitrage and enables<lb/> companies to offer their clients new, cheaper, more flexible, and often higher quality services. It may offer<lb/> reduced time-to-market, facilitate access to foreign markets and create business opportunities to develop<lb/> new products for niche markets. The use of external providers also allows companies to focus on what they<lb/> do best, freeing up capital to be re-invested in R&amp;D and more productive activities. Innovations in business<lb/> practices and low productivity growth have worked as drivers in other instances. But international sourcing<lb/> of BPS and ITS from distant countries is not a viable option for most companies. It takes considerable<lb/> investment and effort for a company to manage the complex undertaking and most services remain non-<lb/>tradable. That said, trade in BPS and ITS will continue to grow in significance as international delivery<lb/> models mature and more countries – on both the demand and supply side – enter the global markets for<lb/> BPS and ITS.<lb/></p>

			<p>3.<lb/> This paper is one in a series of OECD studies on Globalisation and Structural Adjustment (GSA).<lb/> The GSA project aims to deepen our understanding of the impact of globalisation in OECD and non-<lb/>OECD economies. It focuses in particular on the overall economic effects of globalisation, the impact of<lb/> globalisation and innovation in the business support service sector, and the links between trade and labour<lb/> market adjustment. 2 As part of the GSA project, this paper looks at the role of major emerging economies<lb/> in providing BPS and ITS to OECD markets. It is first and foremost aimed at trade analysts and policy<lb/> makers but it may just as well be of use for anyone interested in the debate on offshoring – especially since<lb/> the analysis offers plenty of information that is not easily accessible.<lb/></p>

			<head>Objectives and scope<lb/></head>

			<p>4.<lb/> The objective of the paper is to examine the expansion of international supply chains involving<lb/> BPS and ITS. In particular the analysis will focus on how emerging markets are integrated in the supply<lb/> chains of companies operating in OECD countries. The countries that are studied in the paper have either<lb/> developed competitive BPS/ITS export sectors or have the potential to do so in the future. The aim is to<lb/> provide a clearer picture of the nature of and factors behind new international supply chains in these<lb/> sectors. It also seeks to identify the major business-and trade-related challenges arising. In this context it<lb/> presents some of the implications for labour markets resulting from increasing trade between OECD and<lb/> non-OECD economies.<lb/> 5.<lb/> The scope of the paper is limited to international supply of BPS and ITS, frequently referred to<lb/> as &quot; offshoring &quot; (see <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>). Offshoring covers both international insourcing and international<lb/> outsourcing and involves mainly cross-border supply of services (GATS mode 1/2). 3 For ITS, service<lb/> delivery may also be provided through cross-border supply in conjunction with temporary labour migration<lb/> (GATS mode 4). The scope of the study is further narrowed down to focus on the flow of services from<lb/> emerging markets to OECD countries. It should be noted, however, that OECD-based companies are some<lb/> of the largest suppliers of BPS and ITS to emerging markets through commercial presence (GATS mode 3)<lb/> and emerging market suppliers are increasingly establishing subsidiaries in OECD countries to supply<lb/> services locally. 4<lb/></p>

			<p>Source: OECD Secretariat<lb/> 6.<lb/> The paper focuses on a fairly broad group of services that is referred to throughout the paper as<lb/> business process services (BPS) and information technology services (ITS). A &apos;business process&apos; is an<lb/> &quot; event-driven end-to-end processing path that starts with a customer request and ends with a result for the<lb/> customer &quot; . 5 Consequently, a &apos;business process service&apos; is a service that performs a business process<lb/> activity either in full or in part. Customer interaction services, back office operations, and professional<lb/> services such as human resource, finance and accounting services are examples of business process<lb/> services. &apos;Information technology services&apos; include activities such as IT consulting, system integration,<lb/> custom application development, application maintenance and traditional IT outsourcing and hardware<lb/> support. 6 The number of activities that can be classified as BPS and ITS is continuously growing due to<lb/> technological progress and business innovation. Thus, an exhaustive list using a non-generic methodology<lb/> would quickly become outdated. 7<lb/> 3 There is no agreement among WTO members about whether electronic supply falls under GATS mode 1 or 2, hence<lb/> the terminology modes 1/2 is used<lb/> 4 See</p>

			<table>Table 3 and Annex K.<lb/> 5 See Gartner&apos;s glossary: www.gartner.com/6_help/glossary/GlossaryB.jsp<lb/> 6 See more in MGI (2005a).<lb/> 7</table>

			<p>This is one of the main reasons why there is no common definition used in the literature that is linked to registers<lb/> such as the WTO (1991) Services Sectoral Classification list. Annex A presents an indicative list of some of the<lb/> services that are outsourced.<lb/></p>

			<head>Data and methodology<lb/></head>

			<p>7.<lb/> International trade statistics fail, to a large extent, to capture trade in BPS and ITS. Several<lb/> reports have concluded that there is a substantial discrepancy between the BPS and ITS trade data captured<lb/> in the IMF Balance of Payment (BOP) system and the data presented by some governments and industry<lb/> associations. In the case of India, the discrepancy between data presented by IMF&apos;s BOP system and the<lb/> Indian National Association of Software and Service Companies (Nasscom) exceeds 90 percent for most<lb/> recent years. 8<lb/> 8.<lb/> Given the challenges related to definitions and availability of comprehensive data, the following<lb/> analysis will make use of data provided by government officials, industry associations and market<lb/> intelligence companies. This type of data is normally based on filed income statements and market surveys.<lb/> Thus it is essential for the reader to keep in mind that some data are best available estimates and may not<lb/> be perfectly comparable across countries. 9<lb/> 9.<lb/> The analysis is also based on information and data obtained from interviews with some 90 senior<lb/> managers, government officials, industry experts and representatives of industry associations in China, the<lb/> Czech Republic, India and the Philippines (Annex B presents a list of the interviewees). The interviews<lb/> were conducted during 1-2 week long missions to the four countries between September 2005 and<lb/> September 2006. Information obtained from the interviews has been backed up with data from the existing<lb/> literature whenever possible.<lb/> 10.<lb/> The following paper is centred round country studies of the BPS and ITS sectors in China, the<lb/> Czech Republic, India and the Philippines. Each country study presents market characteristics of the local<lb/> BPS and ITS sectors with focus on trade aspects. They present distinguishing features of each country&apos;s<lb/> BPS and ITS sectors to illustrate how the countries&apos; BPS and ITS sectors are being integrated in<lb/> international supply chains and the extent to which they are successful at targeting export markets. They<lb/> also seek to identify the main business-and trade-related challenges facing companies and governments.<lb/> The country studies are then followed by a section with the main findings and concluding remarks. It<lb/> includes a discussion of some of the implications that workers and governments may face as a result of the<lb/> increasing trade in BPS and ITS between emerging economies and OECD countries.<lb/></p>

			<head>THE CHINESE BPS AND ITS SECTORS<lb/></head>

			<p>11.<lb/> The potential attractions of China as a provider of BPS and ITS to OECD-based clients are many.<lb/> The Chinese economy has grown rapidly for many years and the domestic markets for BPS and ITS are<lb/> boosted by the large and growing number of Chinese and foreign-owned multinationals that operate in<lb/> China. There is abundant supply of university graduates, including software engineers, many of which are<lb/> highly qualified and motivated. Labour costs are particularly low for junior-level professionals and it<lb/> makes China an economically compelling location for provision of BPS and ITS. Geographic proximity<lb/> and linguistic capabilities are attributes useful in serving clients in Japan, Korea, Chinese Taipei, Singapore<lb/> and Hong Kong. In addition, the business environment is conducive in Chinese technology and software<lb/> parks that provide streamlined administration, quality infrastructure and incentive packages to prospective<lb/> new exporters. Yet given all these merits, China still remains a small player on the international market for<lb/> other services than high-end R&amp;D services and lower end BPS services.<lb/> 12.<lb/> A.T. Kearney&apos;s Global Services Location Index ranks China as the second most attractive<lb/> geography for providing BPS and ITS (see Annex H). Labour is inexpensive and infrastructure costs low<lb/> but taxes and regulatory costs are higher in China than in India and the Philippines. While China has a<lb/> particularly large labour force in absolute terms, people with relevant experience and foreign language<lb/> skills make it less suited to provide services to markets outside East Asia. And although China is regarded<lb/> as having a relatively low country risk and decent infrastructure, it scores poorly for cultural adaptability<lb/> and security of intellectual property. neoIT&apos;s ranking of emerging markets places China as the third most<lb/> attractive offshore location for ITS but only ninth most attractive location for BPS (see Annex F-G). China<lb/> has a slight advantage compared to India in terms of costs but it significantly lags its neighbour in terms of<lb/> maturity of local BPS and ITS companies and in the availability of suitable manpower.<lb/></p>

			<head>Market characteristics<lb/></head>

			<p>13.<lb/> The BPS and ITS sectors in China are predominantly serving the domestic market. In 2000, the<lb/> export share of total supply was 6 percent according to <ref type="biblio">Tschang and Xue (2003). By 2006</ref>, this share was<lb/> estimated to have increased to 10-15 percent. 10 Exports are equally generated by Chinese-owned<lb/> companies and subsidiaries of foreign multinationals. However, foreign multinationals obtain more of the<lb/> large private services contracts than their Chinese counterparts (IDC, 2006a) 11 .<lb/> 14.<lb/> While there is a scarcity of reliable BPS/ITS trade data in general, the Chinese market is<lb/> particularly challenging to analyse due to the relative lack of transparency and availability of disaggregated<lb/> data. Very few Chinese BPS or ITS companies are publicly listed. The following set of estimates provides<lb/> an overview of those that are frequently presented:<lb/></p>

			<table>! Analysys International estimates that the Chinese &quot; software outsourcing market &quot; was worth<lb/> US$8.7 billion in 2005 (OSW, 2005).<lb/> ! According to the Chinese Ministry of Information Industry, software exports in 2005 totalled<lb/> US$3.59 billion, up from US$ 2.80 billion in 2004 (MII, 2006).<lb/> ! Government officials in the Ministry of Commerce put the export value of IT and IT-enabled<lb/> services at US$ 3.6 billion in 2005 and US$ 960 million were related to exports of software<lb/> programmes and applications. 12<lb/> ! According to IDC (2006a), exports of software development services reached US$ 933 million in<lb/> 2005, up from US$ 600 million in 2004 and US$ 400 million in 2003. 13<lb/> ! A.T. Kearney (2004) estimates that US$ 320 million worth of BPS would be internationally<lb/> sourced from China in 2005, up from US$ 260 million in 2004.<lb/> 15.<lb/> Exports of BPS and ITS are mainly delivered to companies operating in China&apos;s eastern<lb/> neighbours: the Asia-Pacific region imported more than three-fourths of these services in 2005. Japan<lb/> captures roughly two-thirds of exports and a significant part of this business is generated by branches of<lb/> OECD-based companies operating in Japan. European and North American markets represent around one-<lb/>fifth of Chinese exports. More specifically, Japanese companies are large consumers of software<lb/> application and maintenance services while European and North American companies are major clients for<lb/> testing services (IDC, 2006a).<lb/> 16.<lb/> Notwithstanding the publicised, forthcoming rivalry between China and India as offshore<lb/> services suppliers</table>

			<p>, the former country has yet to develop into a major base for international sourcing of<lb/> BPS and ITS. There are indications that China is becoming the destination of choice for the supply of<lb/> certain BPS and ITS to companies operating in Japan and Korea. However, this is not the case for<lb/> European and North American companies and many analysts believe this is unlikely to happen in the<lb/> foreseeable future.<lb/> 17.<lb/> Nevertheless, China may excel in foreign niche markets, some of which may generate sizeable<lb/> export revenue. It is currently a capable destination at the two ends of the services value chain: low-level<lb/> data processing and testing work and high-level R&amp;D. In the R&amp;D area, China is already one of the main<lb/> centres in the world but there is rather limited R&amp;D investment in the Chinese BPS and ITS sectors. In<lb/> between the low-end and high-end of the value chain, China has yet to realise its potential as a supplier to<lb/> foreign markets despite the nascent industry&apos;s ambition and the Chinese government&apos;s explicit goal to<lb/> develop a competitive domestic software industry.<lb/> 18.<lb/> There is great potential for a strengthened Sino-Japanese trade relation in the BPS and ITS area.<lb/> For example, the five top Chinese BPS and ITS companies presented in Annex K are mainly focusing their<lb/> activities to serve the Japanese market. The geographic proximity, Japanese language proficiency and<lb/> demographic and economic forces are compelling and indicate that this relation is likely to develop further<lb/> if the political and business environments remain stable. Increased investment in Japanese language<lb/> capabilities would in particular increase business opportunities for Chinese BPS companies.<lb/></p>

			<head>Fragmentation and ownership<lb/></head>

			<p>19.<lb/> While the future potential for China to become an offshore centre of choice is great, the current<lb/> capabilities of the domestic industry and the market structure leave plenty of room for improvement. The<lb/> BPS and ITS markets are highly fragmented with more than 13,000 SMEs employing some 900,000<lb/> professionals vying for business. 14 No home-grown company has a market share over 3 percent and few<lb/> companies are export-oriented – the competition is cutthroat. There are many reasons why the BPS and<lb/> ITS markets are fragmented.<lb/> 20.<lb/> First, they are still in their infancy and foreign participation has only started to pick up over the<lb/> last few years. Second, with low entry barriers, the markets are full of small and immature companies that<lb/> tend to compete on price rather than quality; act opportunistically without attention to developing domain<lb/> expertise; and not invest adequately in training and process controls. As a result, operating margins are low<lb/> by international standards (7 percent according to <ref type="biblio">de Filippo (2005)</ref>). China is also mainly exporting fairly<lb/> low-value services related to data entry, modular software programming and testing and maintenance<lb/> services.<lb/> 21.<lb/> Third, China is a large country with different IT champions in different provinces and regions.<lb/> Local governments have significant equity holdings in local BPS and ITS companies and tend to favour<lb/> these to external competitors. Market consolidation is also held back by local governments that are<lb/> unwilling to lose control of the companies. This has slowed down the development of companies with<lb/> country-wide presence. Estimates of the share of public ownership of the BPS and ITS sectors vary:<lb/> Tschang and Xue (2003) have estimated the share of public ownership at about 30 percent, with another 10<lb/> percent having mixed public-private owners, and Gartner puts the public ownership share at 70 percent<lb/> (<ref type="biblio">Ilett, 2006</ref>). <ref type="biblio">Saxenian (2003)</ref> argues that 30 percent of the software companies in China are state-owned,<lb/> 27 percent are Sino-foreign joint ventures, 20 percent are collectively owned (university spin-offs), 17<lb/> percent are private and 6 percent are foreign-owned.<lb/> 22.<lb/> Many ITS companies founded in the 1980s-1990s were established by university faculty and<lb/> universities were often awarded a share of corporate equity. For other Chinese entrepreneurs, a mixed<lb/> public-private ownership structure was simply necessary to setup and run a company: official assistance<lb/> (through guanxi 15 ) is often essential in China to gain access to licenses, permits, financial resources and<lb/> facilities. Public ownership also brings protection and favourable interpretation of regulations and<lb/> enforcement of contracts. Another key benefit of a public-sector link is the perceived advantage in the<lb/> competition for contracts from public institutions and state-owned enterprises. (<ref type="biblio">Saxenian, 2003</ref>). The<lb/> supply of software programming and IT services to sensitive industries such as defence and aerospace is<lb/> predominantly provided by publicly controlled companies.<lb/> 23.<lb/> The fragmented markets for BPS and ITS have several disadvantages: without adequate scale it is<lb/> difficult to attract multinational clients, which make up much of the market for internationally sourced BPS<lb/> and ITS. The main reasons are that small service providers are less reliable due to their dependency on key<lb/> personnel and limited financial resources. Technical capabilities and flexibility are also negatively affected<lb/> due to their lack of capacity or breadth to absorb large projects and offer domain expertise. In addition, it<lb/> 14 According to the Chinese Ministry of Information Industry (MII), there were 13,194 registered software companies<lb/> by the end of 2005 (AI, 2006a). MOFCOM provided the number of professionals in the industry.<lb/> negatively affects companies&apos; ability to develop mature and efficient procedures for process and quality<lb/> controls.<lb/> 24.<lb/> Several of the export-oriented Chinese BPS and ITS companies are start-ups by former<lb/> employees of OECD-based multinationals. Many senior Chinese executives have also been recruited from<lb/> abroad to the domestic industry. This situation is similar to the one in India, where many of the leading<lb/> services companies were established by former employees of U.S. and British multinationals. The main<lb/> difference, however, is that most of the successful Indian services companies were established in the late<lb/> 1980s and early 1990s while many of China&apos;s fast growing services companies were established in the late<lb/> 1990s and early 2000s. The Indian industry is thus enjoying a significant head start and the Chinese<lb/> industry is trying to catch up the best it can. 16<lb/> 25.<lb/> Some of the fastest growing export-oriented Chinese ITS companies are today privately owned.<lb/> Given the competitive pressures and low-margin work at the Chinese market, more and more companies<lb/> are trying to establish business models that are effective in serving foreign markets. Entry barriers to serve<lb/> OECD markets are significantly higher than for domestic supply but those companies that succeed – and<lb/> there is a small number of Chinese BPS and ITS companies that have more than US$ 10 million in export<lb/> revenue from OECD market (see Annex K) – operate in markets where there are fewer competitors and<lb/> more profitable business opportunities.<lb/></p>

			<head>The role of the Chinese government in attracting foreign investment<lb/></head>

			<p>26.<lb/> The Chinese government supports the local BPS and ITS sectors and tries to entice foreign<lb/> companies with tax and tariff incentives, subsidies and administrative convenience in its dedicated high-<lb/>tech parks. The Chinese government also actively encourages partnerships and joint ventures with foreign<lb/> companies to assist in the development of Chinese ITS companies. The Chinese government is not only the<lb/> regulator but also the largest client of BPS and ITS in China and the largest owner of local companies. This<lb/> makes the Chinese BPS and ITS sectors stand out in a comparison with those in the Czech Republic, India<lb/> and the Philippines where public ownership is almost non-existent and public procurement as a share of<lb/> total demand is relatively low.<lb/> 27.<lb/> The Chinese government regards the software industry to be essential to economic progress and<lb/> national security. The key government policy for the software industry was announced in</p>

			<table>June 2000 and<lb/> published in State Council Document 18, also known as the &quot; Notice of Certain Policies to Promote the<lb/> Software and Integrated Circuit Industry Development &quot; , and later followed up by State Council Document<lb/> 47 in 2002. The policy document established preferential policies to promote the development of these two<lb/> sectors and the policies for software companies include: 17<lb/> ! Value-added tax refunds for R&amp;D and expanded production;<lb/> ! Tax preferences for newly established companies;<lb/> ! Fast-track approval of software companies seeking to raise capital on overseas stock markets;<lb/> ! Exemption from tariffs and VAT for all imports of technology and equipment;<lb/> ! Direct export rights for all software firms with more than US$ 1 million in revenue;<lb/> ! Right to set salary levels and to grant bonuses to investors<lb/> 16 Computerworld argued in 2003 that the Chinese ITS sector was 12 years behind the Indian one. The Economist put<lb/> it at 5-10 years in 2006.<lb/> 17 See www.csia.org.cn/chinese_en/index/No18Document.html for the text and Saxenian (2003).<lb/> 28.<lb/> In addition to the above-mentioned incentives, State Council Document 18 also provided for a<lb/> new layout of the software sector, which included a plan to fund and promote selected companies for the<lb/> creation of national champions (the Chinese government has subsequently selected around 160 national<lb/> companies). It also established a Committee covering 15 Ministries to establish an effective legal<lb/> framework to protect patents, trademarks and copyrights; and to ensure enforcement of this legal<lb/> framework. Another pillar of the strategic document covers government incentives for the development of<lb/> human resources (more on this below).<lb/> 29.<lb/> Documents 18 and 47</table>

			<p>were followed by an initiative by the Torch Centre – a division under the<lb/> Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST) – in November 2003 and referred to as the China Offshore<lb/> Software Engineering Project (COSEP). COSEP&apos;s goal is to provide services from China to overseas<lb/> corporate clients. The Torch Center annually selects qualified software companies from regional software<lb/> parks to participate in COSEP and the companies are trained under supervision of ExperExchange – an<lb/> American BPS and ITS company – to obtain a quality certification (<ref type="biblio">ChinaTechNews, 2003</ref>). This project<lb/> was launched with the help of ExperExchange and it has provided some of the impetus behind the<lb/> expansion of outsourcing activities, in particular those targeting Europe and North America (<ref type="biblio">Simon, 2005</ref>).<lb/> 30.<lb/> Although the central and local governments provide the BPS and ITS industry with significant<lb/> support, there are two areas where the industry would like to see further improvement to enhance the<lb/> business environment and its international visibility. First, the Chinese BPS and ITS sectors lack an<lb/> effective industry association to provide best practise indicators for benchmarking, comprehensive industry<lb/> data, and promote them abroad to potential investors. This is a disadvantage vis-à-vis other emerging<lb/> market competitors. As Nasscom in India, BPA/P in the Philippines and the Czech ICT Alliance, such an<lb/> industry association could also aid the Chinese government in formulating common priorities for the policy<lb/> environment. The China Software Industry Association (CSIA) is currently the nation-wide industry<lb/> association but it focuses mainly on the domestic market for software and related services. Its activities are<lb/> restricted by its limited mandate provided by the Chinese government. CSIA is perceived to be first and<lb/> foremost accountable to the government rather than to the industry itself.<lb/> 31.<lb/> Second, there are currently ten government ministries with different responsibilities to address<lb/> specific issues and challenges faced by the BPS and ITS sectors. The National Development and Reform<lb/> Commission (NDRC) defines the overarching policies for ministries, the Ministry of Information industry<lb/> (MII) focuses on industry policy, the Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM) promotes trade, the Ministry of<lb/> Science and Technology (MOST) provide guidelines for R&amp;D strategy, etc. Many local observers argue<lb/> that the Chinese government could be more effective and facilitate the situation by introducing a more<lb/> coherent long-term policy without conflicts of interest with regard to the responsibility of different<lb/> government ministries.<lb/></p>

			<head>Box 1. Dalian Software Park<lb/></head>

			<p>The Dalian Software Park (DLSP), established in 1999, is one of the fastest growing software parks in East Asia<lb/> and a major gateway for Chinese exports of IT and IT-enabled services to <ref type="biblio">Japan</ref> and Korea. It is also one of six<lb/> &quot; national software export bases &quot; approved by the Chinese Government to export services. Due to Dalian&apos;s<lb/> geographical proximity and historical links to neighbouring Japan and Korea, the region has a substantial Japanese<lb/> and Korean speaking population, which can be employed to supply voice-based and non-voice-based business<lb/> process services. It also hosts many universities and research institutes that provide plenty of graduates that form<lb/> the backbone in the outsourcing sector.<lb/> Exports have grown rapidly: after the first establishments of mostly domestic companies, Panasonic setup<lb/> operations in 2001 as the first Japanese multinational and GE Capital International Services arrived the following<lb/> year. In September 2006, 340 companies employed approximately 30,000 professionals in the DLSP and roughly<lb/> 40 percent of the companies were foreign-owned. Half of the companies supply BPS and ITS services to foreign<lb/> clients mainly in East Asia and Japan captures some 80 percent of exports. Revenue is to a large extent made up of<lb/> software application development (40 percent) and business process services (30 percent). Engineering services,<lb/> embedded software and R&amp;D make up much the rest. A joint venture between DLSP and a Singaporean company<lb/> is currently investing to develop the park by adding 9 km² to the current 3 km², which will make it the largest<lb/> software park in China. This project is to form an industrial arrangement enclosing a Software Development Zone,<lb/> a Research &amp; Development Zone, an Information Service Zone, an Education &amp; Training Zone, and a Corporate<lb/> Campus Zone, plus adjacent public services and housing.<lb/> DLSP offers companies a set of preferential policies. Foreign companies that operate in the DLSP can enjoy<lb/> preferential tax treatment during five years from the year the company starts making a profit: the taxes of the first 2<lb/> years are exempted and taxes for the following 3 years are reduced by 50 percent. Moreover, as long as exports<lb/> make up at least 70 percent of total production value, income tax is reduced from 33 percent to 10 percent and the<lb/> maximum VAT from 17 percent to 0-3 percent. For software products, VAT and export tax are exempted. For<lb/> technology exports, the sales tax and income tax are exempted. Companies that export software products for more<lb/> than US$ 1 million can conduct trade operations without having to make use of a third party export/import agent.<lb/> Furthermore, import tax and VAT are exempted for imported equipment used by software companies and for<lb/> technology, including software, and the parts and spare parts imported together with the equipment (with some<lb/> exceptions).<lb/></table>

			<p>Companies that employ graduates with Bachelor degrees or higher qualifications are further allowed to register<lb/> their employees as permanent residents, who are exempted from paying the city environmental fee. The same goes<lb/> for overseas Chinese that come and work in the DLSP. They receive long-term temporary residential cards and<lb/> their children enjoy similar rights as locals for school and kindergarten services. Annual &quot; special funds &quot; are<lb/> provided from state departments, the province and the city to DLSP-based companies in addition to support from<lb/> risk capital companies. Companies and employees also enjoy preferential treatment in buying or renting office<lb/> buildings in the park.<lb/> Source: OECD (2006), www.dlsp.com.cn and discussions with representatives from the DLSP.<lb/></p>

			<head>Challenges to China&apos;s BPS and ITS sectors in supplying international markets<lb/></head>

			<p>32.<lb/> Chinese-owned and foreign-owned companies that supply BPS and ITS from China face a<lb/> number of challenges. Most challenges in the BPS and ITS sectors are related to supply side constraints.<lb/> The biggest challenge is to recruit and retain talent, in particular middle and senior managers of the calibre<lb/> needed to serve foreign markets. Another type of challenge relates to maintaining operational efficiency –<lb/> including systems for formal procedures, processes and quality control – and this paper only touches on<lb/> some of the China-specific issues that companies face. Regulatory constraints affecting trade are relatively<lb/> few and the sectors benefit from a rather open business environment. This is partly due to business models<lb/> based on cross-border supply and openness to foreign direct investment. The following section looks at<lb/> challenges that are repeatedly highlighted by corporate executives in China:<lb/></p>

			<head>Supply-side constraints<lb/> Recruitment and retention<lb/></head>

			<p>33.<lb/> The BPS and ITS sectors are highly labour, not capital, intensive and human capital is each<lb/> company&apos;s key asset. Although China produces a large number of university graduates every year,<lb/> recruitment is for most Chinese-based service companies the single largest challenge. The sheer size of the<lb/> talent pool is often presented as a main strength but identifying, hiring, training, retraining and retaining<lb/> talent are real challenges for companies. Most graduates and engineers are unsuited to work in an export-<lb/>oriented sector where effective communication and client interaction in many instances are essential. The<lb/> competition to lure the best software engineers (for the ITS sector) and other university graduates with<lb/> technical and business training (for the BPS sector) is tough. Foreign multinationals have an advantage<lb/> since they can afford to pay a wage premium for top talent; they may have an attractive brand name and<lb/> offer opportunities to work abroad and with new technology in exciting projects. Domestic companies<lb/> generally pay less but offer a somewhat different value proposition to its employees.<lb/> 34.<lb/> At the junior level, recruitment is not yet a major issue in China even if it takes considerable<lb/> investment in training before new employees become productive. At a more senior level, for project<lb/> managers and middle managers, the situation is different. The relative infancy of the Chinese BPS and ITS<lb/> sectors makes it naturally difficult to find management talent with mission critical experience and<lb/> expertise. The situation is not aided by the structural gap left from the Cultural Revolution, which<lb/> drastically reduced the education level of a generation of Chinese.<lb/> 35.<lb/> The scarcity of middle and top level talent has effectively put a brake on growth and led to rapid<lb/> salary inflation for these professionals (the salary increases are much more modest for junior level<lb/> professionals). Some Chinese companies try to tackle the situation by recruiting managers from abroad, in<lb/> particular from the sizeable Chinese Diaspora. According to <ref type="biblio">DeWoskin (2005)</ref>,</p>

			<figure>some 60 million Chinese<lb/> live outside China and make up a large source of capital and technology and provide crucial business<lb/> networks.<lb/> 36.<lb/> Several policy programmes have been implemented by the Chinese government to provide<lb/> incentives for Chinese scholars based abroad to move to China. For example State Council Document 18<lb/> established a fund, managed jointly by the State Bureau of Foreign Experts and Ministry of Education, to<lb/> send software developers overseas for training. A.T. Kearney (2004) refers to survey results by Hewitt and<lb/> Associates showing that two-thirds of companies employ numerous Chinese expatriates and roughly half<lb/> of director-level positions and above are filled by Chinese expatriates. The lack of middle and senior<lb/> managers also force many companies to nurture their young talent and fast-track them into management<lb/> positions.<lb/></figure>

			<p>37.<lb/> Labour attrition is another challenge. 18 With only six export-oriented services centres,<lb/> competition is especially hard as more and more companies move to the same locations and vie for talent.<lb/> In the BPS sector, attrition rates are high – especially for voice-based services – but even at 30 percent,<lb/> levels are lower than in India and the Philippines, and significantly lower than in many OECD countries.<lb/> The ITS sector also suffers from attrition but it is generally lower than in the BPS field. To tackle this<lb/> situation companies increasingly focus their attention to enhance core HR policies, e.g. by designing clear<lb/> career paths, investing in education and training, and creating more pleasant work environments. Many<lb/> companies also move delivery centres to smaller towns outside traditional technology and software centres<lb/> where wages are lower and opportunities for staff to jump to neighbouring competitors are fewer. More<lb/> and more companies are also providing performance related bonuses and relaxation of ownership rules will<lb/> allow more companies to offer equity to key personnel.<lb/></p>

			<head>Box 2. Chinese vs. Indian labour supply<lb/></head>

			<p>Leading educational indicators show that China is quite well placed to provide ample talent for its service industry.<lb/> According to Deloitte Research (2006), there is more than twice as many Chinese 18-23 years-olds (15 percent of<lb/> total) than Indians (7 percent) enrolled in higher education. Chinese secondary schools host almost half the number<lb/> of pupils per teacher (18 pupils/teacher) than Indian secondary schools (34 pupils/teacher). China also spends more<lb/> resources on R&amp;D and has many more computer and internet users (see Annex J).<lb/> For the supply of BPS and ITS in English, India has a strong advantage over China. Many Indians are bilingual (or<lb/> trilingual) with English as a mother tongue while the great majority of Chinese have limited exposure to the<lb/> English language. However, in a generation&apos;s time, this difference will become less pronounced since the Chinese<lb/> government has decreed that all Chinese children must study English from the age of five.<lb/></p>

			<head>Language proficiency and international business acumen<lb/></head>

			<p>38.<lb/> The supply of BPS and ITS often involves intensive interaction and communication with<lb/> corporate clients. BPS are also often provided through real-time communication. The ability of service<lb/> professionals to properly identify the task, solve the problem, and communicate the solution is thus related<lb/> to his/her communication skills, technical capabilities and business acumen. Chinese professionals have a<lb/> natural advantage to foreigners when serving their domestic market. However, Chinese professionals face a<lb/> serious challenge when it comes to serving foreign clients and customers. Most Chinese professionals have<lb/> limited exposure to foreigners and foreign business environments. BPS and ITS companies seek to address<lb/> these gaps by investing in soft skills like language proficiency, communication skills and cultural<lb/> awareness.<lb/> 39.<lb/> China has a sizable population of Japanese and Korean speakers in its North-Eastern provinces.<lb/> A growing number of foreign multinationals are supplying voice-based support services in Japanese and<lb/> Korean to customers and clients in China&apos;s eastern neighbours (see Box 3). The language proficiency and<lb/> cultural affinity to these countries aid the process of supplying non-voice based business process services<lb/> and IT services. China is today the main, although nascent, offshore destination for cross-border delivery<lb/> of BPS and ITS to Japan and Korea.<lb/> 40.<lb/> The language barrier is arguably the main reason why China has yet to develop into an offshore<lb/> location of choice for the supply of BPS and ITS services to companies in Europe and North America. An<lb/> exception is certain high-level software programming and R&amp;D-related activities for which China&apos;s<lb/> abundance of scientists and knowledge workers are particularly well suited. The situation is different for<lb/> Indo-European language skills. While China&apos;s current generation of pupils learn English at elementary<lb/> school, students that graduate from university today have, at best, limited knowledge of spoken English.<lb/> Those that do learn English have few opportunities to practise their skills. Even at international master<lb/> degree programmes at some of China&apos;s best universities, students can read in English but writing and<lb/> verbal communication skills remain low.<lb/> 41.<lb/> But this is starting to change, and will continue to change, as more English-speaking students will<lb/> graduate in the future and more Chinese students return with degrees and language skills from overseas. To<lb/> serve foreign markets, companies will not only need to find talent with language skills but also invest<lb/> heavily in training to enhance workers&apos; understanding of language nuances and the importance of tone in<lb/> customer interaction. This is particularly important for sales and marketing activities abroad.<lb/></p>

			<head>Regulatory challenges<lb/></head>

			<p>42.<lb/> The regulatory challenges are related both to the domestic business environment and to the<lb/> regulatory environment in client countries. In the major client countries Japan, Korea and the United<lb/> States, there are currently few regulatory concerns for Chinese-based BPS and ITS companies. The<lb/> Chinese ITS companies that deliver services with the help of a global delivery model that is partly<lb/> dependent on temporary movement of professionals between home office and client office face the same<lb/> type of restrictions that Indian companies face in Europe and North America (see Indian chapter for an<lb/> extensive discussion). 19 These restrictions relate to the relatively unpredictable and time-consuming<lb/> administration of business visas and work permits, which increase complexity and business risk.<lb/> 43.<lb/> So far, few Chinese companies send professionals to their client countries and the issue, while<lb/> real, is thus limited to the companies that employ a global delivery model with a significant onsite<lb/> component. And Chinese professionals do not face this type of challenge in their relation with Japan and<lb/> Korea, which also capture most of Chinese services exports. Foreign multinationals operating in China can<lb/> move employees on intra-corporate work permits which are easier to obtain and involve less discretion.<lb/> 44.<lb/> The view of OECD-based companies with regard to regulatory challenges in China is rather<lb/> positive too, not least because the software and technology parks that host almost all foreign-owned<lb/> companies provide a unique trade environment with streamlined administration, high standards of<lb/> infrastructure and financial incentives. These software and technology parks are a relief since it is a rather<lb/> time consuming and tedious process to establish a subsidiary in China and there are some other issues as<lb/> well (see Annex C).<lb/></p>

			<figure>Box 3. Indian companies are increasingly investing in China<lb/> After much contemplation and evaluation, the Indian BPS and ITS sectors have decided to approach China as a<lb/> business opportunity rather than a competitive threat. Leading Indian companies Satyam Computer Systems, TCS<lb/> and Infosys Technologies all established branch offices in China in 2002-03. These companies employed some<lb/> 400-600 Chinese professionals in their development centres in China during the fall of 2006. However, towards the<lb/> end of the decade, the companies expect to have increased their Chinese headcount tenfold. Much of the workforce<lb/> will be used to serve clients in neighbouring Japan and Korea.<lb/></figure>

			<p>China can be leveraged by foreign/Indian companies in three main ways. First, some companies are targeting the<lb/> rapidly growing domestic market with local and foreign-owned multinationals. Some 80 percent of Fortune 500<lb/> companies have operations in China. Competition is high but new niche markets such as engineering services are<lb/> providing new growth opportunities. China&apos;s accession to the WTO and the liberalisation of the banking sector will<lb/> put pressure on domestic banks to increase productivity and this is expected to increase the market for domestically<lb/> sourced BPS and ITS. Second, China is the natural offshore base, or &quot; nearshore &quot; bridge, to serve clients in Japan,<lb/> Korea and the Asia Pacific. Third, with time, companies will build up capabilities to use their Chinese branches to<lb/> serve clients also outside North-East Asia.<lb/></p>

			<head>Source: OutsourcingWorld and Vandrevala (2006)<lb/></head>

			<p>45.<lb/> The Chinese court system is considered to be unpredictable and recourse to legal means<lb/> expensive. Most contracts are signed directly in the client country so that potential disagreements can be<lb/> settled according to the jurisprudence in the client country. Foreign companies normally hire consulting<lb/> companies to establish their subsidiaries since this process can take considerable time and involve dealings<lb/> with many public agencies.<lb/> 46.<lb/> According to China&apos;s Schedule of Specific Commitments related to GATS, for &quot; computer and<lb/> related services &quot; , China has no limitation on market access or national treatment for mode 1-3 supply of<lb/> &quot; consultancy services related to the installation of computer hardware &quot; , &quot; data processing services &quot; , &quot; input<lb/> preparation services &quot; , &quot; data processing and tabulation services &quot; , &quot; time sharing services &quot; and &quot; management<lb/> consulting services &quot; . Limitations to mode 4 are related to education and work experience levels. For<lb/> &quot; software implementation services &quot; , &quot; systems and software consulting &quot; , &quot; systems analysis services &quot; ,<lb/> &quot; systems design services &quot; , &quot; programming services &quot; and &quot; systems maintenance services &quot; , market access is<lb/> only allowed in the form of joint ventures (with foreign majority ownership permitted) (<ref type="biblio">WTO, 2002</ref>).<lb/> Foreign industry has previously called for these limitations to be removed (USITO, 2003).<lb/> 47.<lb/> However, unlike in many other services sectors (e.g. telecommunications) in China, the BPS and<lb/> ITS companies consulted in this study did not consider ownership regulations to restrict their activities.<lb/> Ownership plays much more of a crucial role in government procurement: foreign-owned companies find<lb/> themselves at a disadvantage in the bidding process with government agencies and state-owned enterprises.<lb/> Yet a similar situation holds for the other countries studied in this paper and Chinese–owned companies<lb/> find themselves at a disadvantage when bidding for contracts overseas.<lb/> 48.<lb/> There are significant concerns about Intellectual Property Right (IPR) violations in China,<lb/> including patent, trademark and copyright violations. Pirated versions of enterprise and consumer software<lb/> are readily available at the black market. However, IP violations do not necessarily affect the BPS and ITS<lb/> sectors and companies dealing with IPR take a fairly pragmatic approach to tackle the issue in China. Most<lb/> software applications and even software solutions, when tailor-made for corporate clients, are difficult to<lb/> pirate. IPR is in most instances not relevant to services provision in the sectors studied here. The view of<lb/> industry experts is that the legal framework in China to a great extent is developed on this issue but<lb/> enforcement is not necessarily as strong as it could be.<lb/> 49.<lb/> Foreign investors are somewhat less concerned following China&apos;s accession to the WTO, which<lb/> protects them under the Agreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) 20 .<lb/> State Council Document 18 also provides stiff penalties for piracy. The Chinese government has increased<lb/> its effort in cracking down on IP violations in parallel with its own campaign to help foster domestic<lb/> innovation – which itself is highly dependent on proper enforcement of IPR. Tackling IP concerns to some<lb/> extent hinges on the business model that a foreign company adopts in China. The captive unit, joint venture<lb/> and use of external provider have difference merits with regard to control and security (see more in A.T.<lb/> <ref type="biblio">Kearney, 2004</ref>).<lb/> 50.<lb/> One type of regulation that is particularly relevant in the BPS sector relates to data privacy and<lb/> security. Few regulations act as barriers to trade and clients require the highest standards for data security<lb/> and privacy to outsource fragments – or activities – of their value chains. Companies invest in<lb/> infrastructure and the business processes required to work according to these standards in order to compete<lb/> for business. Regulations may raise the entry barriers to suppliers but are generally applied in a non-<lb/>discriminatory manner (see Indian chapter for more on this issue).<lb/></p>

			<head>THE CZECH BPS AND ITS SECTORS<lb/></head>

			<p>51.<lb/> The Czech Republic is regarded as one of the most attractive locations in Central and Eastern<lb/> Europe for international supply of BPS and ITS. It is also one of the more attractive locations worldwide.<lb/> The country has several merits as a base for the supply of BPS and ITS within Europe. Among the chief<lb/> advantages are the country&apos;s geographic and cultural proximity to large markets in Western Europe, its<lb/> well educated, language proficient and cost effective workforce, its traditionally strong domestic<lb/> engineering industry and well developed infrastructure. Foreign services companies also serve the growing<lb/> domestic market and foreign expatriates like Prague for its high quality of life. Since May 2004, the Czech<lb/> Republic is a member of the EU, which facilitates movement of service personnel within the internal<lb/> market, ensures harmonisation of domestic laws and regulations with those in other EU countries –<lb/> including for data privacy and security – and provides unlimited access to the European market.<lb/> 52.<lb/> A.T. Kearney&apos;s Global Services Location Index ranks the Czech Republic as the 7 th most<lb/> attractive geography for providing BPS and ITS (see Annex H). The country scores particularly highly for<lb/> its business environment, with low country risk, well developed infrastructure and high cultural<lb/> adaptability. It also does well in international comparisons of quality of education, language proficiency<lb/> and staff attrition. The main weaknesses relate to the limited size of the young and technically trained<lb/> workforce and the domestic industry&apos;s lack of experience of delivering BPS and ITS services abroad.<lb/> Additionally, the labour cost structure is significantly higher than in many other emerging markets with<lb/> comparable capabilities. Czech salaries in the BPS and ITS fields are 100-150 percent higher than in China<lb/> and India, and 60-100 percent higher than in the Philippines (see Annex D). Labour cost is not the decisive<lb/> factor for foreign investors in the Czech Republic.<lb/> 53.<lb/> EIU <ref type="biblio">(2005)</ref> ranks the Czech Republic as Europe&apos;s most attractive &quot; offshoring environment &quot; and<lb/> third among emerging markets after India and China. 21 The attractiveness stems from its relatively low<lb/> labour costs, favourable regulatory environment and proximity – both culturally and historically – to<lb/> Western European markets. The country&apos;s well-educated workforce distinguishes it from closely ranked<lb/> Poland and Slovakia. In neoIT&apos;s Offshore Attractiveness Index for ITS, the Czech Republic ranks 6 th after<lb/> countries like India and China that score higher for industry maturity but ahead of the Philippines (see<lb/> Annexes F-G). For international supply of BPS, the Czech Republic ranks 7 th behind India and the<lb/> Philippines but ahead of China. In both areas, Poland and Ireland rank somewhat higher than the Czech<lb/> Republic and it highlights the fact that different countries have different comparative advantages within the<lb/> diverse BPS and ITS sectors.<lb/></p>

			<figure>Market characteristics<lb/> 54.<lb/> According to the IDC (2006b), total revenue in the Czech ITS sector was US$ 1.15 billion in<lb/> 2005 and the market has grown by roughly ten percent per year. Growth in external services expenditure is<lb/> triggered by low but increasing domestic outsourcing, public procurement and new establishments of<lb/> shared services centres by foreign multinationals. The domestic market is increasingly attractive for both<lb/> domestic and foreign suppliers. In 2005, hardware and software support and installation services made up<lb/> 28 percent of the market, systems integration 22 percent, customisation 23 percent and outsourcing 15<lb/> percent. The finance sector (26 percent of the market), combined manufacturing sector (16 percent) and<lb/> government sector (14 percent) were the major client sectors.<lb/> 55.<lb/> The ten largest ITS companies captured 38 percent of the market and seven of those – including<lb/> the top six – are subsidiaries of foreign multinationals (see Annex K). A few big foreign companies<lb/> dominate the government procurement market. Domestically-owned companies are strong in certain niche<lb/> markets for the supply of IT services: e.g. Unicorn is market leader in custom application development;<lb/> and AutoCont CZ and ČEZData are market leaders in network and desktop outsourcing. However, revenue<lb/> is to a large extent generated by domestic clients rather than through exports.<lb/> 56.<lb/> So far, the home-grown Czech BPS and ITS sectors have neither amassed critical size nor<lb/> developed significant presence in client countries. McKinsey (2006) argues that this fact is due to<lb/> increasing business opportunities at home, regulations and inconsistencies in labour laws that complicate<lb/> foreign expansion, and a relatively slow embrace of international sourcing by Central and Eastern<lb/> European companies. The international supply of BPS and ITS that stems from the Czech Republic is<lb/> mainly generated by a limited number of foreign multinationals, predominantly in the IT field, that provide<lb/> services to their European clients from shared services centres. The Czech Republic is not a traditional<lb/> offshoring destination where internationally insourced and outsourced services are delivered to clients in<lb/> far away countries but rather a nearshoring destination where internationally insourced services are<lb/> delivered to other European countries.<lb/> 57.<lb/> McKinsey (2006) estimates that the global market for offshore IT and business process services<lb/> is worth around US$ 30 billion and Eastern Europe supplies less than one percent of this value. In 2004,<lb/> the Czech Republic exported approximately US$ 60 million of ITS, up from US$ 26 million 22 in 2003 and<lb/> US$ 40 million of BPS, up from US$ 15 million in 2003 (<ref type="biblio">Vashistha et al., 2005; neoIT, 2004</ref>). These<lb/> estimates indicate that the industry is growing from a fairly modest level and is still preoccupied with<lb/> serving the domestic market. Like in China, the Czech BPS and ITS sectors are still relatively immature<lb/> and trying to build capacity to serve a more international clientele in the future.<lb/></p>

			<figure>58.<lb/> According to survey results from 2005, covering 52 out of a total of 150 companies that provide<lb/> outsourced ITS in the Czech Republic, most companies reside in Prague with second tier cities like<lb/> Ostrava, Plzen and Brno gaining in significance due to local access to graduates from technical universities<lb/> and lower labour costs (70-80 percent of Prague salaries) (IT Outsourcing Center, 2005). Major export<lb/> markets for the surveyed companies were neighbouring Germany, Austria and Slovakia. UK, Germany and<lb/> Austria were the largest markets for BPS. Other client locations included Canada, USA and the Nordic<lb/> countries.<lb/></figure>

			<head>Nearshoring<lb/></head>

			<p>59.<lb/> Nearshoring is a process where a specific country is chosen to service countries within close<lb/> geographic proximity due to its favourable combination of labour cost, access to talent, cultural proximity<lb/> and other enabling factors. 23 The Czech Republic is becoming a nearshoring destination of choice for<lb/> multinationals wishing to consolidate their back office and IT support in shared service centres serving<lb/> continental Europe. 24 Central and Eastern European countries are rising to the top of the list for<lb/> multinationals seeking to reduce costs for BPS and ITS supply in Europe but unwilling to bear the risks<lb/> associated with offshoring to Asia.<lb/> 60.<lb/> One of the main investors in the BPS and ITS field in the Czech Republic is DHL, which<lb/> operates a large shared services centre in Prague to track transactions and handle billing for its European<lb/> customers (see Box 4). IBM operates a 1,200 strong workforce in its Integrated Delivery Centre in Brno<lb/> that is part of IBM&apos;s global delivery strategy and Accenture has 1,250 services professionals at its shared<lb/> service centre in Prague providing business solutions in the areas of for example finance and accounting to<lb/> European clients (IDC, 2006). Other examples of shared – or nearshoring – centres include ExxonMobil<lb/> (shared financial and accounting service centre), Hewlett-Packard (EMEA regional headquarters), Icon<lb/> Communication Centers (outsourcing contact centre), Lufthansa (data processing centre), Siemens (shared<lb/> financial and accounting service centre), Symbol Technologies (shared servicing and financial service<lb/> centre) and Tesco Stores (shared service centre for IT, finance and accounting). 25<lb/> 61.<lb/> Leading Indian BPS and ITS companies have also started to invest in development centres in<lb/> Europe and in particular in Eastern Europe. The global delivery model that was pioneered by the Indian<lb/> outsourcing industry is not optimal for many foreign clients and it is often easier and more effective to<lb/> serve European clients from countries like the Czech Republic. Progeon, a subsidiary of Infosys<lb/> Technologies, was the first Indian IT-related investment in the Czech Republic. The company has 100<lb/> professionals providing IT support services from its Prague office and another 100 professionals providing<lb/> BPS from its office in Brno. The company plans to increase its Czech workforce to 1,000 in the near<lb/> future. 26<lb/></p>

			<head>Box 4. Serving European clients from the Czech Republic<lb/></head>

			<p>Following the integration of DHL, Danzas and Deutsche Port Euro Express in April 2003, the new DHL, with<lb/> headquarter in Bonn, decided to establish three global IT services centres to provide 24/7/365 IT support to its<lb/> 120,000 clients that send more than one billion parcels annually. Prague was chosen as the European centre,<lb/> replacing smaller units in Switzerland and the UK, and other global IT services centres were located in Scottsdale<lb/> and Kuala Lumpur. These Czech, U.S. and Malaysian centres are interconnected via a corporate<lb/> telecommunications network and support DHL&apos;s mail, express and logistics businesses around the world.<lb/> The Prague centre was fully operational by January 2005 and DHL plans to invest €500 million over five years in<lb/> its Prague operations. By 2008, the Prague centre is likely to employ some 2,000 employees. According to DHL&apos;s<lb/> CIO, the Czech Republic was chosen for its &quot; availability of skilled and flexible labour force, well established and<lb/> reliable telecommunications networks, good air links as well as for the optimum incentives package offered by the<lb/> Czech government &quot; . DHL hopes the project will reduce its US$ 1 billion IT budget by 60 percent and the<lb/> consolidation of support centres has already increased productivity by 20 percent.<lb/></p>

			<p>62.<lb/> The reason why the demand for nearshoring services is growing is that it is easier to service<lb/> foreign clients from a closer geography. According to <ref type="biblio">DiamondCluster (2005)</ref>, client satisfaction has<lb/> dropped recently for offshored services. Management complexity is a significant deterrent. Cultural<lb/> proximity has a big impact on communication and large time-zone differences are a disadvantage for<lb/> 24 Other common locations for shared services centres include Ireland, Hungary, Slovakia and Romania.<lb/> 25 According to the www.czechinvest.org website.<lb/> 26 According to CzechInvest.<lb/> certain types of services. For SMEs, nearshoring is often the only viable alternative to keeping operations<lb/> at home due to management overhead costs and operational risks associated with offshoring. An added<lb/> benefit of nearshore locations like the Czech Republic is also that sensitive data remain within a regulatory<lb/> environment similar to the one of the client&apos;s home country.<lb/> 63.<lb/> The Czech Republic is vying for the same foreign business as other Eastern European countries<lb/> like Hungary, Slovakia, Poland and Romania. So far, these countries have all managed to attract a fair<lb/> share of international investment. The different markets have yet to clearly differentiate their service<lb/> capabilities. These countries have similar strengths and weaknesses and government officials and<lb/> companies compete for as large a share of investment as possible in the hope that foreign multinationals<lb/> will establish service centres which in time will yield technological spillover effects and transfers of<lb/> management know-how to the domestic industry.<lb/></p>

			<head>The role of the Czech government in attracting foreign investment<lb/></head>

			<p>64.<lb/> The Czech government provides investment incentives through the CzechInvest agency.<lb/> CzechInvest has identified the BPS sector as one of its top priorities. According to Government Decree<lb/> 1238 of 10 December 2003, the Framework Programme for Support of Technology Centres and Centres of<lb/> Business Support Services, foreign investors that establish headquarters, software development centres or<lb/> expert solution centres and invest a minimum of €0.5 million, create a minimum of 15 new jobs sustained<lb/> for five years, and export at least 50 percent of supply are eligible for support. For call centres, high-tech<lb/> repair centres, shared services centres, the minimum investment is €1 million and the number of new jobs<lb/> 50. Companies are also required to finance a minimum of €0.25-0.5 million from their own equity<lb/> (<ref type="biblio">CzechInvest, 2006</ref>). The incentives consist of subsidy grants for:<lb/></p>

			<figure>• business activities, with up to 50 percent of eligible business expenses (wage or capital<lb/> expenditure on tangible and intangible assets) paid during the a maximum of ten years and up to<lb/> the ceiling of state aid; and<lb/> • training and re-training, with up to 35 percent (30 percent in Prague) of special training costs<lb/> and 60 percent (55 percent in Prague) of general training costs paid during a period of 3-5 years<lb/> and dependent on the number of jobs created. 27 The maximum training subsidy is CZK 100,000-<lb/>150,000 per employee.<lb/> 65.<lb/> The maximum ceilings for state aid during 2007-2013 period were not yet negotiated when this<lb/> report was prepared. However, the maximum ceilings are likely to be reduced from 20-50 percent to 10-40<lb/> percent depending on the region receiving the investment. Between June 2001 and 16 November 2006, 90<lb/> companies had been approved by CzechInvest to receive financial support. In return, these companies have<lb/> pledged to invest €492 million and create 14,872 jobs. A majority of the jobs are for university graduates.<lb/> Figure 2-3 show the country of origin of the companies that established services centres in the Czech<lb/> Republic and the jobs created by the various investments. Next to the ten percent of jobs created by Czech<lb/> companies, the most labour-intensive investments were undertaken by EU-based companies (57 percent),<lb/> U.S. companies (22 percent) and Indian companies (7 percent).<lb/> 66.<lb/> The industry association the Czech ICT Alliance was founded under the auspices of CzechTrade<lb/> in December 2005. Its role is to help enhance the international profile of the Czech ICT industry.<lb/> Improving the visibility of the Czech BPS and ITS sectors is needed in an increasingly competitive<lb/> international business environment and the Czech Republic has yet to differentiate itself from neighbouring<lb/> countries. The main reason why government incentives are perceived as important in Central and Eastern<lb/></figure>

			<p>Europe is that the country profiles are relatively similar. A more generous government funded programme<lb/> can make the difference when foreign investors decide where to locate shared services centres in the<lb/> region. The situation is different in China, India or the Philippines where country profiles differ<lb/> significantly and cost structures are lower.<lb/> 67.<lb/> While the Czech government is supportive of the BPS and ITS sectors, there is much room for<lb/> improvement in its procurement policy. Government procurement is dominated by a few large companies<lb/> and several observers argue that the procurement process could be significantly more open and<lb/> transparent. 28 Survey results provided by the World <ref type="biblio">Bank (2006)</ref> show that the share of companies<lb/> describing corruption as a problem for their operations and growth in the Czech Republic has drastically<lb/> increased. Between 2002 and 2005, the share increased from 28 percent to 49 percent. This situation is a<lb/> great deal worse than in Slovakia, Poland and Bulgaria where the development was the opposite.<lb/></p>

			<head>Challenges to the Czech BPS and ITS sectors in supplying international markets<lb/></head>

			<p>68.<lb/> The business challenges facing the Czech BPS and ITS sectors in their quest to serve<lb/> international markets are to a large extent related to the operational issues that face any nascent industry<lb/> that starts to target foreign markets. On the supply side, these challenges are related to recruiting<lb/> technically adept professionals and experienced managers that master foreign languages, building domain<lb/> expertise, boosting productivity and managing complexity in an increasingly international market place.<lb/> On the demand side, the main challenges are to develop sales and marketing organisations abroad and in<lb/></p>

While Czech<lb/> exports of BPS and ITS still are relatively modest, the country has the potential to attract significant<lb/> amounts of foreign business and the Czech government hopes that the BPS and ITS sectors will help<lb/> reduce the economy&apos;s strong dependency on exports of manufactured goods (see Annex I).<lb/> 69.<lb/> A survey by the IT Outsourcing Center in 2005 highlighted two challenges affecting the Czech<lb/> services sector. First</table>

			<p>, there is a scarcity of technical personnel: the number of university graduates is<lb/> relatively low and some of the software engineers migrate abroad. Second, the cost effectiveness of the<lb/> Czech BPS and ITS sectors is being diminished by salary inflation, taxation and high levels of<lb/> bureaucracy. According to <ref type="biblio">CzechInvest (2004)</ref> and the Czech Ministry of <ref type="biblio">Informatics (2006)</ref>, Czech BPS<lb/> and ITS companies suffer from their inability to effectively market themselves abroad and tend to rely<lb/> heavily on their technical competence. The industry would gain from a more German and English<lb/> proficient workforce, a more developed service culture and improved IPR protection. The capital market<lb/> for SMEs is also a concern: e.g. <ref type="biblio">Cermak et al. (2006)</ref> argue that access to capital has increased following<lb/> the privatisation of the Czech banking industry but SMEs still suffer from limited access to capital. These<lb/> weaknesses put the Czech Republic in a challenging situation where high-value services are provided<lb/> mainly by Western companies while companies in Eastern Europe are building capacity and increasingly<lb/> compete on cost in the same foreign markets as the Czech industry.<lb/> 70.<lb/> The labour cost arbitrage is not likely to be sustained in the long term and future EU accession<lb/> countries, Bulgaria and Romania, are expected to increase the competition especially on the lower end of<lb/> the services value chain. Ukraine is also a potential low-cost location for BPS and ITS work and a future<lb/> competing geography for the Czech industry. However, companies from China, India and the Philippines,<lb/> which are studied in this report, are not competing directly for the same business as the Czech industry.<lb/> 71.<lb/> During the next decade, it is likely that some of the BPS and ITS work that is done in the Czech<lb/> Republic will migrate eastwards due to labour cost differences. In the hardening competition with the<lb/> Czech Republic&apos;s eastern neighbours, Hungary, Slovakia, Poland and Romania, and non-EU members<lb/> Ukraine and Russia, the Czech sector will need to move up the value chain and find niche areas where it<lb/> can be at the forefront in specific domains or areas of technical expertise. The Czech industry may gain<lb/> from an increased participation by companies further east if it can develop a business model that leverages<lb/> the capabilities in those countries. Czech companies may for example outsource or insource some of their<lb/> work to those countries. To become a more attractive partner to international clients, the Czech industry<lb/> will need to increasingly focus on process maturity and quality control (e.g. certification such as ISO and<lb/> SEI CMMi) and develop effective sales and marketing channels abroad.<lb/></p>

			<head>Supply side constraints<lb/> Recruitment and retention<lb/></head>

			<p>72.<lb/> The Czech education system – in particular its technological universities – is one of the country&apos;s<lb/> inherent strengths and a decisive factor for potential new ITS establishments. 92 percent of Czechs in their<lb/> twenties have completed higher secondary education (compared to an EU average of 69 percent) and<lb/> around 30 percent of tertiary students enrol in science, engineering, manufacturing and construction<lb/> programmes (see Annex J). This is higher than in many other emerging markets and according to OECD&apos;s<lb/> Pisa study, the Czech Republic has the highest quality of maths and science education in Central and<lb/> Eastern Europe (<ref type="biblio">CzechInvest, 2005</ref>). The Czech Republic produces 14,000 university graduates in<lb/> technical and scientific subjects each year (neoIT, 2004) and there are currently some 26,700 students in<lb/> IT-related fields in the Czech Republic (<ref type="biblio">CzechInvest, 2005</ref>). Estimates of the annual number of IT<lb/> graduates vary: 2,000-3,000 graduates result from a narrow definition of an &quot; IT graduate &quot; and the number<lb/> increases to 4,000 with a broader definition.<lb/></p>

			<table>73.<lb/> According to figures by Universitas, 60 percent of 18-29 year-olds speak some English and 52<lb/> percent have studied German. 29 The proportion of Czechs that can speak English is set to increase since 95<lb/> percent of secondary school students study English (neoIT<ref type="biblio">, 2004</ref>). Russian is a common language among<lb/> older generations. What is worrying to the BPS and ITS sectors, however, is that although total spending<lb/> per pupil has increased by 15 percent in real terms since 1989, spending per university student has fallen<lb/> by more than 40 percent in real terms and the rate of admission to tertiary education among university-age<lb/> students is the third lowest in the OECD (<ref type="biblio">EIU, 2006</ref>). The domestic workforce is also set to shrink in the<lb/> future due to the extremely low birth rates experienced in the 1990s. As a result of this demographic shock,<lb/> Czech universities will either need to reduce entrance requirements or enrol fewer students in the future.<lb/></p>

			<figure>New policies to attract foreign labour may be necessary to help smooth expected labour shortages.<lb/> 74.<lb/> In 2006, the Czech BPS and ITS companies could still recruit manpower without too much of a<lb/> problem – at least outside Prague. Most foreign establishments are located in Prague and tend to pay a<lb/> significant wage premium compared to domestically-owned companies. Staff attrition is less of a problem<lb/> in the Czech Republic than in the Asian countries studied in this report, in particular India. It does happen,<lb/> however, that multinationals enter the Czech market and pledge to recruit hundreds of workers within a<lb/> short period of time and this tends to create short-term fluctuations with regard to staff attrition and put<lb/> upward pressure on salaries.<lb/></figure>

			<p>75.<lb/> As in China, the Czech BPS and ITS sectors suffer from a shortage of experienced managers that<lb/> are both customer focused and quality conscious (<ref type="biblio">Economist, 2005</ref>). Managers with strong backgrounds in<lb/> both domestic and foreign markets, at ease with the business acumen and communication standards<lb/> expected by foreign clients, are equally in short supply. This situation is not helped by the general<lb/> unwillingness of Czechs to move and work in new cities. It is also challenging for the ITS sector to find<lb/> senior programmers with 5-7 years of work experience since such professionals tend to have management<lb/> positions.<lb/></p>

			<head>Regulatory challenges<lb/></head>

			<p>76.<lb/> The Czech business environment has in many regards improved over the last years and corporate<lb/> taxation is being trimmed in line with competition from other newly acceded EU members. Annex C<lb/> shows that Czech regulatory and institutional efficiency affecting the business community is broadly on<lb/> parity with the OECD average in the areas of investor protection, access to credit, paying taxes and<lb/> employing workers. There is still a lot of room for improvement when it comes to the ease with which<lb/> entrepreneurs can start a business, close a business and enforce contracts. The judicial system is<lb/> particularly slow compared to the OECD average and also slower than in China and the Philippines.<lb/> 77.<lb/> Czech ITS companies do seldom employ a service delivery model based on the temporary<lb/> movement of service personnel. The economics behind the global delivery model, which is based on<lb/> service personnel migrating temporarily from the supplier to the client, is not feasible in the Czech<lb/> business environment. Yet some key personnel need to be transferred abroad at times and this is made<lb/> more difficult by the decision of some EU countries to phase in the freedom of movement in the European<lb/> internal market over a number of years. However, this is a temporary restriction that only affects a limited<lb/> number of ITS projects involving foreign clients. Most Czech professionals are working to serve the<lb/> domestic market and those serving foreign markets are predominantly working for foreign companies that<lb/> can move skilled personnel without problems. With regard to movement between the Czech Republic and<lb/> non-EU countries in Eastern Europe, movement of high-skilled workers is less difficult that movement of<lb/> low skilled workers.<lb/></p>

			<head>THE INDIAN BPS AND ITS SECTORS<lb/></head>

			<p>78.<lb/> India is the leading emerging market exporter of BPS and ITS to the OECD area. India&apos;s export-<lb/>oriented ITS sector started to gain momentum already in the middle of the 1990s and has grown rapidly<lb/> since then. The success of the ITS sector is demonstrated by the fact that three Indian ITS companies<lb/> ranked among the world&apos;s six most valuable ITS companies in 2006. 30 Each one of these Indian companies<lb/> exported more services than the combined ITS sectors of China, the Czech Republic and the Philippines<lb/> (see <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>			<figure>and Annex K).<lb/> 79.<lb/> The Indian BPS sector is less mature than the ITS sector and started to reach scale only some 3-4<lb/> years ago. It faces strong competition from other emerging markets such as the Philippines for services in<lb/> English. Indian companies are increasingly investing in emerging markets with complementary language<lb/> capabilities, including in China to serve East Asian markets, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Hungary to<lb/> serve EU countries, and in the Philippines to serve American clients. In addition, some of the leading<lb/> Indian companies are increasingly investing in supply capacity in other OECD markets.<lb/> 80.<lb/> India&apos;s strength lies in its large English proficient talent pool and its large sophisticated BPS and<lb/> ITS companies. The BPS and ITS sectors are labour-intensive rather than capital-intensive and a highly<lb/> skilled workforce with language and communication capabilities is paramount in serving foreign markets.<lb/> Compared to other emerging markets that export BPS and ITS, India stands out with its more mature and<lb/> experienced home-grown industry and the combination of size and quality of the relevant workforce.<lb/> Inexpensive labour helps attract foreign business but Indian labour costs are not discernibly different from<lb/> some other leading emerging markets such as China (see Annexes D and H).<lb/></figure>

			<p>81.<lb/> The Indian business environment is the industry&apos;s main weakness. The over-burdened<lb/> infrastructure lacks adequate investment and the country risk is perceived to be higher than in countries<lb/> like China and the Czech <ref type="biblio">Republic (neoIT, 2006</ref>). Fierce competition for the country&apos;s top talent has led to<lb/> rapid salary inflation and high attrition rates. Indian culture also lends itself less well to serve far off<lb/> markets than for example the Czech Republic and the Philippines with cultural proximity to the main<lb/> export markets in Europe and the United States respectively.<lb/></p>

			<head>Market characteristics<lb/></head>

			<p>82.<lb/> During the 1990s, India&apos;s compound annual growth rate (CAGR) for services exports was 17<lb/> percent – the highest growth rate among the world&apos;s top 15 services exporters (<ref type="biblio">World Bank, 2004</ref>).<lb/> According to <ref type="biblio">Nasscom (2006)</ref>, in the financial year ending March 2006, India exported BPS for US$ 6.3<lb/> billion and ITS for US$ 13.2 billion. Custom application development and application management were<lb/> the two dominant service categories (see <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>). MGI (2005a) estimates that India accounts for 72<lb/> percent of ITS originating from low-wage regions and as much as 88 percent of such imports in the UK.<lb/> The industry is strongly dependent on foreign markets: the domestic market for BPS and ITS was worth<lb/> around US$ 5.2 billion, or 21 percent of the total supply. 31<lb/> 83.<lb/> In terms of export markets, the United States is the single largest destination for Indian BPS and<lb/> ITS: it captures two-thirds of exports and this share has remained stable over time. The UK is the second<lb/> largest client country and absorbs 14 percent of Indian BPS and ITS exports (see <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>). The private<lb/> sector in the UK sources marginally more BPS and ITS from India than the private sector in the United<lb/> States if account is taken of the relative sizes of their economies. Indian companies have targeted other<lb/> overseas markets for many years but these investments have generated limited returns. <ref type="biblio">Japan</ref> and Germany<lb/> are the third and fourth biggest export markets but none of them business exceeding US$ 500 million. In<lb/> total, 84.3 percent of Indian BPS and ITS exports were captured by English-speaking countries in the year<lb/> ending March 2005. 32 This figure would most likely be higher if American and British companies<lb/> operating from other non-Anglophone countries were included.<lb/></figure>

The top five companies generated 46 percent of<lb/> Indian ITS exports and 4-5 percent of BPS exports. 33 Another ten home-grown companies supply one-<lb/>fourth of ITS exports and 4-5 percent of BPS. The thirty largest captive units of foreign multinationals<lb/> supply 15 percent of ITS exports and the 150 largest captive units make up 50 percent of the Indian BPS<lb/> market. This implies that India works predominantly as a centre for international outsourcing for ITS and<lb/> both as a centre for international insourcing and international outsourcing in the BPS sector.<lb/> 85.<lb/> The Indian-owned BPS and ITS companies are increasingly establishing supply capacity in<lb/> locations outside India, for e.g. through cross-border acquisitions, acquisitions of IT departments of clients<lb/> and through greenfield investments. While Indian companies are going global, moving into both emerging<lb/> 31 In addition to BPS and ITS, Indian companies exported an estimated US$ 3.9 billion worth of engineering services,<lb/> R&amp;D services and software products.<lb/> 32 That is Australia, Canada, Singapore, UK and the United States.<lb/> 33 www.nasscom.in/upload/5216/Indian_IT_Industry_Factsheet_2006.pdf.<lb/> markets and OECD markets, more and more OECD-based ICT multinationals are growing their presence<lb/> in India. Annex L presents estimates of the workforces of leading ITS multinationals. In 2005,<lb/> approximately 11 percent of the combined workforce of foreign multinationals presented in the annex was<lb/> based in India. According to Nasscom (2006), this share is growing and expected to reach 14 percent by<lb/> 2007. Some companies, like Accenture and IBM Services, have roughly one fifth of their workforces in<lb/> India. Other companies like Cap Gemini and EDS have relatively few Indian employees.<lb/> 86.<lb/> Total employment in the export-oriented Indian BPS and ITS sectors was estimated at 0.8 million<lb/> in the fiscal year ending March 2006</table>

			<p>. The workforce was split equally between the BPS sector and the ITS<lb/> sector. A total of 1.3 million workers were employed in the Indian BPS and ITS sectors (for both domestic<lb/> and foreign supply) and the sectors serving foreign markets with software products, R&amp;D and engineering<lb/> services. These combined sectors sustain an estimated 3 million jobs through indirect and induced<lb/> employment (<ref type="biblio">Nasscom, 2006</ref>). The former kind of employment is projected from expenditure on<lb/> telecommunications, power, construction, facility management, IT, transportation, catering and other<lb/> services. The latter kind of employment is driven by consumption of employees on food, clothing, utilities,<lb/> recreation, health and other services.<lb/></p>

			<head>Box 5. The global delivery model for IT services<lb/></head>

			<p>The global delivery model (GDM) for IT services makes use of a combination of cross-border supply and<lb/> temporary labour migration and was pioneered by Indian companies in the 1980s and 1990s. During the early<lb/> years, before international fibre networks and the Internet were common place, documents and audiotapes were<lb/> flown to India for digitisation and transcription. Basic programming work was also conducted for foreign<lb/> multinationals. With time, Indian companies started sending IT specialists to their clients&apos; premises for software<lb/> programming work. This practice reached a peak in the lead up to year 2000 when demand for IT professionals<lb/> exceeded supply in many OECD countries.<lb/></p>

			<p>The rapid growth in ICT networks, reductions in communication costs, and technological progress made it<lb/> possible to keep an increasing number of IT professionals back in India (offshore) working with the Indian team at<lb/> the client site (onsite). The Indian professionals at the client site defined the project requirements, coordinated<lb/> work, installed software, trained client staff and provided rapid-reaction maintenance services while team<lb/> members in India provided technology tasks such as technical and database design, programming, testing,<lb/> documentation and long-term maintenance services. This business model was economically compelling due to the<lb/> labour cost arbitrage between IT professionals in the client country and those working in India. It was also a highly<lb/> challenging process to manage that only the Indians came to fully master among the emerging markets players.<lb/> Over time, the need to keep a sizeable Indian team at the client site has been reduced. Between 2000 and 2005, the<lb/> industry-wide average proportion of onsite work dropped from 67 percent to 42 percent. The size of the ratio of<lb/> offshore/onsite work component is directly proportionate to savings of labour costs but the same also holds for the<lb/> complexity of managing the project. Hence the optimal offshore/onsite ratio varies from project to project.<lb/> The GDM has grown increasingly complex and sophisticated with time. Today large Indian companies break<lb/> pieces of work into logical components and distribute them to locations where they can be most cost-effectively<lb/> performed. For example, a client engaging an Indian company in London may interact with the Indian company&apos;s<lb/> sales team, which is permanently based in London, and during the project life cycle host a team of senior Indian IT<lb/> specialists that coordinate and implement different IT components provided from Bangalore, Jaipur and Budapest.<lb/> The Indian company may then provide maintenance services from its development centres in Belfast and Budapest<lb/> and technical telephone support from Bangalore.<lb/></p>

			<head>Challenges to India&apos;s BPS and ITS sectors in supplying international markets<lb/></head>

			<p>87.<lb/> The Indian BPS and ITS sectors benefit from a strong industry association in Nasscom. It has<lb/> helped enhance transparency in the industry; promote industry standards, best practises and foreign direct<lb/> investment; and it has been particularly successful at selling the industry abroad. Nasscom (2006) has<lb/> identified three pillars where the industry faces significant challenges: cyber security (piracy, privacy, data<lb/> protection and IPR), human resources, and infrastructure (in particular airports, mass transport systems,<lb/> roads and electricity).<lb/> 88.<lb/> In general, companies operating in India are also subject to excessive bureaucracy and<lb/> regulations. The country scores poorly in several of the indicators provided by the World Bank&apos;s<lb/> benchmarking exercise Doing Business (see Annex C). These include in particular indicators for starting a<lb/> business (lengthy and tedious), closing a business (lengthy and with low recovery rates), taxation (highest<lb/> tax rate) and labour market rigidity. Enforcing a contract is a nightmare: it takes on average some 1,420<lb/> days, one of the world&apos;s worst records. As a result, legal contracts are signed in client countries and<lb/> covered by the client country&apos;s jurisprudence.<lb/> 89.<lb/> To the benefit of the BPS and ITS sectors, the business environment is significantly improved in<lb/> the Indian Software Technology Parks (STP) that were introduced in the early 1990s, and which is where<lb/> export-oriented companies operate. The STPs have the same function as export processing zones. They<lb/> provide tax exemptions, bridge gaps related to infrastructure, and offer a more conducive business<lb/> environment. For foreign multinationals, most of the administrative burden is drastically cut in the STPs<lb/> and many of the remaining issues can be solved by hiring external consulting companies.<lb/> 90.<lb/> The World Bank (2004) argues that India must address two critical challenges in order to sustain<lb/> the dynamism of its service sector: externally, the problem of actual and potential protectionism; and<lb/> domestically, the persistence of restrictions on trade and investment as well as weaknesses in its regulatory<lb/> framework. To address the former problem, India will need to secure access to foreign markets. However,<lb/> the most pressing challenges facing the BPS and ITS sectors companies today relate to supply side<lb/> constraints. The following section reviews the concerns addressed by Indian companies and foreign<lb/> multinationals with substantial operations in India.<lb/></p>

			<head>Supply side constraints<lb/> Recruitment and retention<lb/></head>

			<p>91.<lb/> Most BPS and ITS companies in India struggle with recruitment and retention of professionals.<lb/> The problem is not the number of graduates produced every year but rather their quality. While the share of<lb/> graduates that are adequately trained for work in the export-oriented BPS and ITS sectors is higher than in<lb/> a country like China, the relative size of the combined BPS and ITS workforces (around 0.8 million in<lb/> <ref type="biblio">March 2006</ref>) and the high growth of the industry have increased HR activities. Although there is no<lb/> shortage of young professionals looking for employment, investment in screening and training is<lb/> substantial and keeps rising in line with the high number of graduates that are recruited. Foreign<lb/> multinationals tend to tackle these issues by paying a significant wage premium compared to Indian<lb/> companies.<lb/> 92.<lb/> Retention is another challenge since most ITS talent is concentrated in centres such as Bangalore,<lb/> Chennai, Delhi, Hyderabad and Mumbai. Staff attrition rates in the BPS sector may be lower than in most<lb/> OECD countries, especially for voice-based services, but frequent job hopping reduces BPS companies&apos;<lb/> productivity and tends to fuel salary inflation. <ref type="biblio">Dange et al (2005)</ref> estimates that every 5 percent of<lb/> employee attrition reduces gross margins by up to 1.5 percent. However, India has an advantage compared<lb/> to the other countries studies in this paper since its BPS and ITS sectors pioneered the offshoring business<lb/> and have the broadest and deepest pool of project managers and senior managers.<lb/></p>

			<head>Restrictions on temporary movement of ITS personnel 34<lb/></head>

			<p>93.<lb/> The global delivery model (GDM), used by most Indian companies to export ITS, is dependent<lb/> on international transfers of senior personnel between home and foreign client offices (see Box 5). On<lb/> average, approximately one-third of operational manpower in a typical Indian ITS company is situated at<lb/> the client site throughout a project life cycle. But the allocation of personnel varies from company to<lb/> company, project to project, and throughout the project life cycle. Many medium and large Indian<lb/> companies have permanent staff employed in client country subsidiaries. These professionals typically<lb/> manage client interaction, in particular related to sales and marketing activities, but some of the largest<lb/> companies, like Infosys Technologies and TCS, maintain a growing number of operational staff as well.<lb/> However, most operations such as software development are still carried out by professionals based in<lb/> India or other emerging markets, including China, Eastern Europe and the Philippines.<lb/> 94.<lb/> The manpower located at client site has gradually dropped from more than two-thirds in the mid-<lb/>1990s to one-third today. This ratio of work at client site is likely to continue to edge downwards due to<lb/> technological improvements and maturing GDMs. Yet there is a limit to the amount of work that can be<lb/> carried out offshore: the economics of international outsourcing lies in maximising the amount of work<lb/> carried out in cost-effective locations; and face-to-face client interaction is still paramount to achieve<lb/> operational efficiency. The GDM employed by Indian companies will continue to be dependent on<lb/> international transfers of managers and IT professionals in the foreseeable future.<lb/> 95.<lb/> The administrative process related to documentation for business visits to client countries can be<lb/> a challenge for Indian ITS companies. Some of the issues related to administration and documentation are<lb/> removed with time as trust is built in new client countries and authorities realise the value that visiting<lb/> professionals provide. American and British authorities have long experience of handling Indian visa and<lb/> work permit applications but this does not hold for many other OECD countries. There has been some<lb/> improvement in the visa and work permit administration and there is scope for further improvement.<lb/> 96.<lb/> Rules concerning business visas and work permits are issues of national sovereignty. Each<lb/> country designs the requirements and administrative procedure deemed necessary to provide business visas<lb/> and work permits to foreign citizens consistent with national objectives. The following section presents<lb/> some frequently raised concerns in this area in the Indian ITS sector. In general, while there are direct costs<lb/> associated with the documentation and application process for movement of personnel, the concerns raised<lb/> relate more often to the time and uncertainty involved. The direct costs are regarded as an additional<lb/> overhead while time and uncertainty cause large indirect costs or even break deals.<lb/></p>

			<head>Business visas and work permit requirements<lb/></head>

			<p>97.<lb/> The process of obtaining a business visa is relatively straightforward in most of India&apos;s export<lb/> markets. However, the discrepancy between countries can be significant: the process of obtaining a<lb/> business visa can take anything from one to ten working days in India. Some companies report that they<lb/> frequently obtain business visas with shorter valid times than they apply for. This adds complexity and<lb/> uncertainty since companies may have to pay cancelling and rebooking fees for air tickets and hotels, and<lb/> reschedule project plans and client meetings, etc. The visa holder may also need to return to India only to<lb/> go through the application process again before finalising the business with the client.<lb/> 98.<lb/> The administrative process for work permits is more stringent than for business visas. Some<lb/> countries make use of quota systems to control and manage the number of work permits that can be issued<lb/> each year. Work permits are usually issued for visitors that do billable work or stay for more than three<lb/> months. An advantage of the application process for work permits compared to the process for business<lb/> visas is that there is less discretion in the administrative process and there are seldom issues concerning the<lb/> duration of stay.<lb/> 99.<lb/> The current application procedure for work permits leaves the decision to the discretion of the<lb/> official handling the application. In many countries, applicants need to submit documents in original<lb/> copies, schedule an interview for which there may be 45-120 days of waiting time, and then convince the<lb/> official during the interview that he/she has no intention to migrate on a permanent basis or overstay the<lb/> approved duration of stay. This recurring issue is due to the fact that many countries do not differentiate<lb/> the handling of applications for permanent migration and temporary movement of natural persons. The<lb/> applicant who presents the requested documentation may also be asked to provide additional<lb/> documentation at a later stage to verify the obligatory documentation. This process may involve rounds of<lb/> translation and legalisation of documents.<lb/> 100.<lb/> For example, some records such as birth certificates and educational diplomas first need to be<lb/> legalised by the local state government. The legalised documents are then translated to the language of the<lb/> country for which the application is due before the translated version of the legalised document in turn may<lb/> need to be legalised. For certain documents, the procedure can involve up to three levels of legalisation and<lb/> visits to the applicant&apos;s hometown, the local state authority and government ministry in New Delhi. In<lb/> some countries, Indian ITS professionals go through a process that can take more than six months in order<lb/> to obtain a work permit. In some cases the waiting time can be 8-10 months. The processing time makes it<lb/> impossible to undertake certain projects and may not only result in lost business opportunities but also<lb/> damage client relations.<lb/> 101.<lb/> The administrative process for issuing work permits is less of a concern for Indian professionals<lb/> working for foreign subsidiaries than for home-grown companies. Many foreign subsidiaries are product<lb/> development centres and the employees of these centres seldom need to interact directly with clients or<lb/> work abroad. Employees who still need a work permit can normally move as intra-corporate transferees.<lb/> The administrative process for such movement is relatively efficient and subject to few restrictions. The<lb/> situation is different for employees of Indian-owned companies. Some of the largest Indian companies<lb/> have subsidiaries with local employees in their main client countries and this generally facilitates the work<lb/> permit process since employees can move as intra-corporate transferees. However, the great majority of<lb/> Indian companies do not have the financial strength or the business model to establish operational units in<lb/> client countries and they depend on the effectiveness of client country embassies and consulates.<lb/> 102.<lb/> Work permits may come with regulations concerning minimum wage levels or wage parity<lb/> requirements. While these occasionally inflate the final client bill, wage regulations seldom have any real<lb/> effect since most professionals sent to work abroad have reached a seniority and wage level that exceed<lb/> these requirements. More burdensome is the additional layer of administrative work needed to prove that<lb/> the company comply with all the rules. A fair, predictable, transparent and streamlined process for business<lb/> visa and work permit applications would benefit both the client and the supplier.<lb/></p>

			<figure>103.<lb/> Indian IT companies have developed sophisticated mechanisms to minimise potential<lb/> disturbances to their operations: large companies have dedicated departments which handle travel logistics<lb/> and applications for business visas and work permits. Each project leader may be in charge of the visa<lb/> planning for the professionals in his/her project. Most companies also employ professional consulting<lb/> companies to help with translation, legalisation and temporary migration issues. Long-term client relations<lb/> facilitate this planning process and increase predictability.<lb/> 104.<lb/> There are three principal ways which Indian companies can reduce their dependence on work<lb/> permits in the future. One way is to establish development centres in client countries (see OECD (2006b)</figure>

			<p>).<lb/> This approach reduces the need for international movement of employees and those that move can apply<lb/> for intra-corporate work permits. The second way is to maximise the amount of work that is carried out in<lb/> India, e.g. by partnering with client country companies or by bringing the client over to India for<lb/> knowledge transfers.<lb/> 105.<lb/> Another increasingly common approach among the larger Indian ITS companies is to establish<lb/> development centres in countries within close proximity (near-shore) to client countries. These countries<lb/> offer higher cost environments than in India but lower cost environments than in client countries. Central<lb/> Europe, and in particular Hungary and the Czech Republic, are developing into service centres for<lb/> Continental Europe; Mexican and Canadian companies service the U.S. market, francophone African<lb/> countries are used as bases to service the French market; and development centres in China provide<lb/> services to Japan. The near-shoring centres help to overcome language and cultural barriers as well as<lb/> some of the restrictions to international movement of professionals, in particular in Europe. Data privacy<lb/> and security regulations can also be easier managed within the EU.<lb/> 106.<lb/> While &quot; near-shoring &quot; may facilitate the movement of professionals to client countries, there are<lb/> often serious restrictions to movement between India and the proximate markets that the companies invest<lb/> in. Indian IT companies are generally well received and supported in the new emerging markets in which<lb/> they invest but it takes time to remove long-standing south-south restrictions which in many cases are more<lb/> stringent that those for north-south trade. These are often more challenging to overcome than those<lb/> between India and OECD markets.<lb/></p>

			<head>Restrictions on movement of information 35<lb/></head>

			<p>107.<lb/> Data privacy and security concerns are related to the risk of: a) data being lost, and; b) data being<lb/> accessed by external parties or misused by the company processing the information. While IT security can<lb/> be guaranteed to some extent with technology, data privacy is people-driven and corporate procedures and<lb/> ethics are of uttermost importance. Indian companies invest in data security systems and back-up<lb/> equipment to reduce the former type of risk.<lb/> 108.<lb/> Data privacy is mainly a concern for BPS companies that transfer and/or process large quantities<lb/> of personal information about other companies&apos; clients or employees. These transfers may include<lb/> sensitive data such as financial, medical, social security and purchasing histories. Regulations on data<lb/> privacy are imposed on companies located within the OECD area and these companies in turn require<lb/> companies to whom they outsource to fulfil criteria which normally go beyond legal requirements.<lb/> Improper handling of information has in the past resulted in public relations scandals for companies whose<lb/> customers or employees have been affected. Both clients that outsource work and the companies providing<lb/> the services have much to lose if there is a breach in data confidentiality.<lb/></p>

			<figure>109.<lb/> Restrictions to the movement of information are an area where many companies fear future<lb/> legislation could erect barriers to mode 1/2 trade. 36 To counteract data handling misuse, Nasscom is<lb/> working together with the Indian government to draft an Information Technology Act which will set<lb/> minimum industry requirements for data privacy and establish a penal code for companies or individuals<lb/> 35 See OECD (2006b) for a more extensive overview of data security and privacy issues.<lb/> breaching the rules. So far there have been few known incidents of data theft in India and by establishing<lb/> and enforcing strict data privacy standards, the industry hopes future issues will be kept to a minimum.<lb/> 110.<lb/> Indian BPS and ITS companies sign non-disclosure agreements with their clients and a number of<lb/> mechanisms are established to protect data. These include dedicated offshore centres where e.g.:<lb/> • only project staff is allowed;<lb/> • the client&apos;s infrastructure and IT system are replicated;<lb/> • all types of data transfers are encrypted;<lb/> • project staff are prohibited from carrying any devices that can store information;<lb/> • project staff are prohibited from interacting with project staff working for competing clients;<lb/></figure>

			<p>• project staff are kept under video surveillance<lb/> 111.<lb/> There is also a multitude of technical solutions which eliminate the need to physically transfer<lb/> data. This includes IT systems which allow offshore project staff direct online access to the data in the<lb/> client country. Operations may also be carried out on dummy data and then applied on the original data at<lb/> client site. As long as data privacy regulations hold for companies irrespective of the country in which they<lb/> are headquartered, data privacy and security regulations are not considered an issue.<lb/> 112.<lb/> Indian companies have established processes to handle data privacy and security because they<lb/> were often a requirement to attract foreign clients in the first place. However, the issue of data privacy and<lb/> security is still a concern for clients. Booz Allen <ref type="biblio">Hamilton (2006)</ref> recently published a survey which<lb/> showed that information security is one of the three most important factors for U.S. companies when they<lb/> select an outsourcing partner. The survey also indicated that information security concerns were related to<lb/> the lack of trust in legal and regulatory environments in developing countries.<lb/> 113.<lb/> Several U.S. laws require companies to maintain reasonable technical, physical and<lb/> administrative safeguards but do not address the issue of international data transfers directly.</p>

			<table>37 They rather<lb/> &quot; impose obligations to maintain reasonable security, access controls and the like, which must be<lb/> considered in any vendor relationship, domestic or off-shore… &quot; thus &quot; …assuming the vendor provides<lb/> appropriate security and confidentiality, U.S. laws do not now limit a company&apos;s ability to select vendors<lb/> in any other geography &quot; (Eisenhauer<ref type="biblio">, 2005</ref>). The obligation for a U.S. company to comply with U.S. data<lb/> privacy and security regulation exists no matter where the engaged service provider is located.<lb/> 114.<lb/> EU Directive 95/46/EC &apos;On the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of<lb/> personal data and on the free movement of such data&apos; took effect in 1998 and is a comprehensive data<lb/> protection and privacy law. It covers most sectors and allows transfers of data if a set of conditions are<lb/> fulfilled. In addition, in the banking sector in some European countries for example, there are regulations<lb/> stating that neither is the international transfer of data nor the international online access to data allowed.<lb/> In such cases, the global delivery model employed by Indian BPS companies is not workable unless they<lb/> establish operational units in the country.<lb/> 115.<lb/> In conjunction with legislation, there are several types of standards and guidelines such as ISO<lb/> 17799 (for best practices in information security), ISO 27001 (for information security management<lb/> systems) and COBIT (Control Objectives for Business &amp; Related Technology). Compliance with data<lb/> privacy, security legislation and guidelines is necessary but comes at a cost: <ref type="biblio">Pai and Basu (2005)</ref> cite a<lb/> TowerGroup study which estimates that the costs of &quot; effective international outsourcing &quot; increase by 3-5<lb/> percent in BPS and 7-9 percent in ITS for due diligence. Risk management increase the costs by another 3-<lb/>5 percent in ITS and 8-10 percent in BPS.<lb/></p>

			<head>THE PHILIPPINE BPS AND ITS SECTORS<lb/></head>

			<p>116.<lb/> The Philippines has several merits for international supply of services and is the second largest<lb/> exporter of BPS and ITS among the countries studied in this paper. The labour cost arbitrage is significant,<lb/> the infrastructure in Metro Manila where most companies locate is well developed and the<lb/> telecommunications infrastructure is reliable and cost-effective. The voice-based and non-voice based BPS<lb/> sectors attract graduates that are more highly qualified than their peers in most high-income countries. The<lb/> country has historically been a protectorate of the United States and this has led to close cultural ties and a<lb/> sizeable Philippine Diaspora in the United States. Communication skills, English proficiency and the<lb/> neutral American-influenced Philippine accent are key attributes for serving U.S. clients. In addition, staff<lb/> attrition rates in the service offshoring industry are low and certain cultural factors lend themselves<lb/> particularly well to voice-based services, e.g. Philippine service workers are generally perceived to be<lb/> customer-oriented with a natural ability to convey empathy.<lb/> 117.<lb/> International benchmarking exercises find the Philippines to be one of the most attractive<lb/> locations for services offshoring (see Annexes F-H). A.T. Kearney&apos;s Global Services Location Index for<lb/> 2005 ranks the Philippines as the fourth most attractive country, with inexpensive labour and<lb/> infrastructure, high cultural adaptability and low staff attrition. The country does less well in terms of<lb/> maturity of the home-grown services industry, quality of education, protection of IPR and the country risk<lb/> is higher than in many comparable emerging markets. High levels of corruption, security issues in the<lb/> south of the country and political instability have a negative effect on the overall business environment.<lb/> However, neoIT ranks the Philippines second only to India in terms of &quot; offshore attractiveness &quot; in the BPS<lb/> sector and the country scores particularly well for the maturity of the local BPS sector and the availability<lb/> and quality of talent (see Annex G). In the ITS sector, the country ranks lower (11 th out of 40 countries)<lb/> and the relative weaknesses in the ITS field are the same factors that make the country strong in the BPS<lb/> field: industry maturity and the availability of talent are not as favourable as in many other comparable<lb/> countries.<lb/></p>

			<head>Market characteristics<lb/></head>

			<p>118.<lb/> The Philippine BPS industry has grown rapidly over the last five years and established itself as<lb/> one of the premier emerging market providers of BPS. In 2005, the Philippine customer contact industry,<lb/> which hardly existed only five years earlier, employed 112,000 workers and generated revenue of US$ 1.6<lb/> billion (see <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>). Revenue in the contact centre sector doubled every year between 2000 and 2004<lb/> (<ref type="biblio">Locsin, 2006</ref>). In addition to customer contact services, the Philippines exports back-office services,<lb/> software services and medical transcription services. In 2005, some 150,000 workers provided US$ 2<lb/> billion worth of BPS mainly to foreign markets. An additional 12,000 workers provided US$ 0.2 billion<lb/> worth of ITS exports. In total, four-fifths of BPS and ITS services were exported in 2004 and the great<lb/> majority of these services were supplied by subsidiaries of foreign multinationals. 38<lb/></p>

Foreign client markets<lb/> for ITS are more geographically dispersed with EU, Japan and United States as main export markets. 39 For<lb/> call centres services, 87 percent of export revenue was derived from U.S. clients in Q3 2005 (<ref type="biblio">Aquino,<lb/> 2006</ref>). The Philippine customer contact industry is to a large extent made up of U.S.-based multinationals<lb/> that provide call centre services from captive units. But a growing number of Philippine, Asian and<lb/> European companies also use the Philippines as a base for call centre services. The country is heavily<lb/> dependent on the Metro Manila area which supplies some 80 percent of exports. The Philippine<lb/> government is working together with domestic industry associations to develop strategies to geographically<lb/> diversify the supply capacity (more on this below).<lb/> 120.<lb/> Labour arbitrage aside, a main reason why a country like the Philippines is so successful at<lb/> attracting contact centre work is that the BPS sector can attract highly qualified graduates for work that in<lb/> the OECD-area is provided by low-skilled workers and characterised by low wages, low productivity and<lb/> high staff attrition. For example in the United States, the average call centre agent stay with the employer<lb/> for less than six months while in the Philippines, the average call centre agent stays for two years or more.<lb/> Companies such as eTelecare Global Solutions continuously invest in training and retention and keep their<lb/> Philippine call centre agents for much longer. Low staff attrition and high quality manpower are<lb/> compelling factors that have led the world&apos;s multinational call centre companies to invest heavily in the<lb/> country. 40<lb/> 38 This estimate is based on calculation by the OED Secretariat using data from Mapa (2006) and Aquino (2006).<lb/> 39 The information was obtained at meetings with industry associations.<lb/> 40 The Philippine BPS sector has penetrated as far as to the WTO in Geneva: WTO&apos;s online training modules are<lb/> checked by Philippine teachers and assistants (<ref type="biblio">Mapa, 2006</ref>).<lb/> 121.<lb/> The Philippines is also becoming an offshore centre for finance and accounting tasks associated<lb/> with high levels of standardisation. 41 Philippine national standards and practice adhered to the U.S.-based<lb/> Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) until January 1 2005, and since then to International<lb/> Accounting Standards (IAS) (<ref type="biblio">Locsin, 2006</ref>). About 100,000 students graduate every year in accounting,<lb/> finance, management and other related subjects and the country produces 2,500-3,000 new certified<lb/> accountants annually.<lb/></p>

			<head>Box 6. International outsourcing offers new business opportunities<lb/></head>

			<p>International outsourcing offers a growing number of feasible business opportunities due to labour cost arbitrage.<lb/> These new business opportunities are seldom acknowledged and difficult to quantify but still part of the offshoring<lb/> equation. For example, a large car manufacturer recently started to provide a GPS star positioning system for a<lb/> monthly subscription fee. A Philippine call centre was hired to initiate an outbound calling campaign to contact<lb/> new car owners with offers of the GPS deal. Old customers were also contacted and offered new services packages<lb/> and information if they did not make use of the GPS service during the first three months of their subscription.<lb/> Many companies consider outbound calling campaigns to be efficient tools to increase the life-time value of a<lb/> customer. But they are often economically unviable to initiate from high-income countries. International<lb/> outsourcing opens up a whole set of new innovative business models due to significant cost advantages.<lb/></p>

			<head>The Role of the Philippine government in attracting foreign investment<lb/></head>

			<p>122.<lb/> The Philippine government and the Philippine Board of Investment (BOI) agency are generally<lb/> perceived as supportive of the country&apos;s BPS and ITS sectors. The government has in the past initiated a<lb/> number of projects to reduce barriers to investment and it is currently cooperating with the industry<lb/> associations, including the Business Processing Association Philippines (BPA/P) and the Philippine<lb/> Software Industry Association (PSIA), to improve education in areas that are key to the industry and<lb/> increase industry standards in terms of data privacy and security.<lb/> 123.<lb/> Some early initiatives were aimed at attracting foreign direct investment. Chief among these was<lb/> legislation allowing 100 percent ownership of BPS and ITS entities established by foreign companies in<lb/> the Philippines. Another initiative was to lower the minimum office-space requirement imposed by the<lb/> Philippine Economic Zone Authority (PEZA). PEZA was established in 1995 and initially required 25<lb/> hectares of dedicated space to create a special economic zone (SEZ)/industrial park. In 1999, the minimum<lb/> space requirement for IT parks was reduced from 25 hectares to 15 hectares. In 2000, IT buildings<lb/> benefiting from PEZA&apos;s policy were allowed if the available office area covered a minimum of 20,000 m 2 .<lb/> According to <ref type="biblio">Locsin (2006)</ref>, the minimum space requirement by PEZA is now 5,000 m 2 .<lb/> 124.<lb/> Companies that locate in PEZA buildings benefit from a number of financial incentives and<lb/> administrative support. The benefit packages include streamlined registration for incorporation, which has<lb/> been reduced to three working days (the average numbers of days to setup a company in the Philippines<lb/> was 48 days in 2005 – see Annex C). Companies can also enjoy 4 to 8 years of income tax holiday,<lb/> unrestricted use of consigned equipment, deductions for labour expenses and training expenses (both up to<lb/> 50 percent) and exemptions from wharfage dues. IT park developers also enjoy tax and duty exemptions on<lb/> imported capital equipment and exemption from the 10-percent input VAT on allowable local purchase of<lb/> goods and services (<ref type="biblio">Locsin, 2006</ref>).<lb/> 125.<lb/> The main priority is now to improve the quality of education. The current administration of<lb/> President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo reversed a decision by its predecessor to only promote the use of<lb/> Filipino in schools. This decision was impairing the export-oriented BPS and ITS industry for which<lb/> English proficiency is the strongest comparative advantage. The new initiatives include programmes to<lb/> enhance teachers&apos; English proficiency and communication skills and they are developing elective courses<lb/> that may cater to students interested in a career in the BPS or ITS fields. The aim is also to improve the<lb/> analytical skills of students and there are several industry-academic joint programmes to enhance the<lb/> quality of IT professionals.<lb/> 126.<lb/> The BOI has commissioned two councils that in conjunction with the private sector are<lb/> developing guidelines on the protection of data privacy and security. The objectives of these projects are to<lb/> ensure minimum standards on data protection, to pre-empt accidents and counteract protectionism. The<lb/> councils are cooperating with the Information Technology Association of America (ITAA) to address<lb/> potential issues. The first council is developing voluntary guidelines for the industry to follow until the<lb/> second council has produced and passed a legal bill on data protection (expected in 2007) (see <ref type="biblio">Lipana and<lb/> Cooper, 2005</ref>).<lb/> 127.<lb/> Another large-scale initiative is the investment in a 600 km long telecommunications corridor.<lb/> Towns can be connected to this ICT backbone if they fulfil a number of criteria aimed at establishing a<lb/> sustainable and business-friendly environment. The project has set a target of generating one million jobs<lb/> by 2010. To achieve this goal the government estimates that it will need investment of US$ 6-7 billion to<lb/> upgrade the infrastructure. There are several objectives related to this geographic diversification. First,<lb/> more regions in the Philippines will get access to the business opportunities of international sourcing and<lb/> this should result in more even economic development. Second, it will limit future salary inflation and<lb/> poaching of staff frequent in the Metro Manila area; and third, the ICT backbone will increase access to the<lb/> labour pool in the country.<lb/> 128.<lb/> Some critics argue that the Philippine government should refrain from favouring one industry<lb/> over another and rather focus its resources on improving the overall business climate in the Philippines.<lb/> The BPS and ITS sectors are already some of the least affected by the regulatory and institutional<lb/> inefficiencies prevalent in the country – see Annex C – and the high levels of corruption that is plaguing<lb/> domestic business is not a big issue to export-oriented BPS and ITS companies. While some observers<lb/> argue that the current incentive packages fail to benefit the many small domestic companies that can ill<lb/> afford to locate in PEZA buildings, where rents are high, others (e.g. <ref type="biblio">Beshouri and Farrell, 2005</ref>) argue that<lb/> the Philippines would do best by investing its resources in improving infrastructure and education rather<lb/> that offering tax breaks to multinationals. The same argument would hold for China and India.<lb/> 129.<lb/> In general, the environment in which the industry operates is generally perceived as conducive to<lb/> do business and the action taken by the Philippine government to reduce investment barriers and<lb/> administrative red tape has helped the industry flourish.<lb/></p>

			<head>Box 7. SPi – a home-grown success story<lb/></head>

			<p>Founded in the Philippines in 1980 and the first publicly listed Philippine IT company, SPi (previously SPI<lb/> Technologies) is arguably the Philippines&apos; most successful home-grown BPS company. Its 11,000 employees –<lb/> 4,500 in voice-based BPS and 6,500 in non-voice based BPS – in Asia, United States and Europe provide a broad<lb/> portfolio of business process solutions related to content and data requirements in the publishing, legal, healthcare,<lb/> content management, and transaction processing industries. SPi&apos;s main services offerings cover digital content<lb/> conversion (transferring data from paper to electronic databases), litigation support, journal and book production<lb/> (typesetting, copy-editing, illustration scanning and page formatting services), medical transcription, call centre<lb/> (including inbound, outbound, sales and customer care applications) and software maintenance and development.<lb/></p>

			<figure>SPi has established a 1,000 strong workforce in Coimbatore, Pondicherry, Kolkata, New Delhi and Chennai in<lb/> India and plans to continue to expand its Indian presence: e.g. it recently acquired Indian KGISTL&apos;s medical<lb/> transcription unit serving the U.S. healthcare industry. The company also has services centres in Vietnam and<lb/> China and in April 2005, the company announced plans to invest US$ 50 million to extend its services capabilities<lb/> in the Philippines and the United States. Geographic differentiation is a significant advantage since work can be<lb/> located to where it makes most financial sense. For example in the past SPi had a 1,500 strong workforce in the<lb/> Philippines doing basic data entry work. Today virtually all those functions have migrated to places like Vietnam<lb/> and China.<lb/> Most Philippine BPS companies are sub-contractors to U.S.-based companies and lack sales and marketing<lb/> organisations in client countries. SPi has established its own sales and marketing channels in the United States and<lb/> it has been particularly successful at building in-house capabilities which has made the company less sensitive to<lb/> external price pressure. Compared to many other Philippine third party BPS providers, SPi has gotten the business<lb/> model right and developed a mature, quality conscious organisation with high visibility abroad.<lb/> Source: Huang (2005) and www.spitech.com.<lb/></figure>

			<head>Challenges to the Philippine BPS and ITS sectors in supplying international markets<lb/></head>

			<p>130.<lb/> The Philippine BPS and ITS sectors are dominated by captive units, or cost-covering<lb/> subsidiaries, of foreign multinationals. The BPS sector is young but has already developed into a US$ 2<lb/> billion industry and a destination of choice for voice-based BPS to English-speaking markets. Some home-<lb/>grown companies – like SPi and eTelecare Global Solutions – have grown into internationally recognised<lb/> multinationals in the BPS field. The ITS sector was founded in the 1980s and has yet to develop any<lb/> significant export capabilities. As in the Czech Republic, the Philippine ITS sector could potentially<lb/> develop expertise in certain niche markets but is not likely to become a sizeable provider to foreign<lb/> markets in the foreseeable future.<lb/> 131.<lb/> Arguably the main reason why the BPS sector has thrived – next to the comparative advantages<lb/> mentioned above – is the relative ease with which Philippine companies can supply services to the United<lb/> States. The Philippine government has provided incentives and facilitated market entry but refrained from<lb/> interfering in the industry. Most home-grown BPS and ITS companies belong to the SME category and<lb/> face challenges unrelated to domestic or foreign regulations. The challenges are rather related to<lb/> recruitment and retention of staff, developing mature and sustainable business models, and convincing<lb/> foreign clients that the risks of political instability is unlikely to affect business. Country risk has a<lb/> negative impact on business and political stability and sustained order are paramount to the BPS sector,<lb/> which provides real-time services all year round.<lb/> 132.<lb/> It is only during the last few years that the BPS and ITS sectors have orchestrated an effort to<lb/> market themselves abroad. The foreign multinationals that make up much of the sector have no incentives<lb/> to sell the Philippines as a location for outsourced BPS and ITS. However, the establishment of the<lb/> umbrella organisation BPA/P, which covers six other industry-specific associations, and its cooperation<lb/> with the BOI under the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) is already raising the industry&apos;s visibility.<lb/> This is necessary since few Philippine companies have sales and marketing channels abroad: most<lb/> companies work with foreign partners working on commission, which is seldom a viable business model.<lb/></p>

			<head>Supply-side constraints<lb/> Recruitment and retention<lb/></head>

			<p>133.<lb/> The BPS and ITS sectors are people-driven. As such, the hunt for the best available talent is<lb/> constantly top priority for companies and the main challenge in daily work. According to BPA/P, a<lb/> shortage of suitable labour is the single most pressing issue facing the Philippine BPS and ITS sectors. The<lb/> country produces some 70,000 graduates annually with computer-related degrees but only 12,000<lb/> professionals in total worked in the export-oriented ITS sector in 2005 (<ref type="biblio">Locsin, 2006</ref>). One reason why the<lb/> ITS industry has failed to take off is the relatively modest quality of Philippine students in mathematics<lb/> and science (<ref type="biblio">Rodolfo, 2005</ref>). Several IT companies believe the Philippine government needs to set<lb/> minimum quality standards in higher technical education. There is otherwise a risk that students who invest<lb/> in IT-related education will face unemployment or be underemployed in adjacent low-value sectors.<lb/> 134.<lb/> Another reason why the ITS sector has struggled is that many software professionals with 4-5<lb/> years of work experience leave the Philippines to work abroad and few tend to return. This limits the<lb/> domestic supply of professionals with high-level technical expertise and managerial competence. The<lb/> relative youth of the industry has also led to a scarcity of experienced managers with sector-specific<lb/> expertise. The captive units of foreign multinationals are best situated to capture the domain expertise and<lb/> middle management talent that stay in the Philippines. While barriers to enter the ITS market are relatively<lb/> low, the actual costs and expertise required to serve foreign markets are high.<lb/> 135.<lb/> The quality certifications (e.g. ISO, SEI CMM and SEI CMMi) that ITS companies can obtain to<lb/> improve the quality and maturity of their work and use to market their quality services work both for and<lb/> against the Philippine ITS sector. Today, large clients normally demand these types of certification to<lb/> evaluate a company&apos;s process maturity. However, these quality certificates are costly and time-consuming<lb/> to obtain and most Philippine companies have ignored this important marketing tool. The situation is<lb/> similar to the one in the Czech industry. Some executives note that as the market for internationally<lb/> outsourced ITS matures, entry barriers pile up in the form of more stringent data privacy and security<lb/> requirements, and higher demand for process quality certification, scalability and investment in training,<lb/> etc. But these entry barriers are industry-imposed and a result of increasing international competition.<lb/> 136.<lb/> The supply-side constraints in the expanding BPS sector have led to strong salary inflation for<lb/> call centre workers. Philippine customer contact centres target a thin slice of available talent since most<lb/> graduates are unsuited for customer interaction requiring a high-level of language proficiency and<lb/> communication skills. As a result, the starting salary for a call centre worker is higher than the starting<lb/> salary for a medical doctor, accountant or software programmer. In 2005, the base salary for English<lb/> speaking call centre workers was 14-16,000 pesos/month with additional supplements for night-shift and<lb/> performance-based bonuses. Contact centre workers with a second language like Japanese or Spanish can<lb/> obtain twice the base salary of an English-speaking call centre worker. One industry executive provided<lb/> the following estimates for young professionals&apos; monthly starting salaries:<lb/> • Software developer in domestic industry: 12,000 pesos;<lb/> • Software developer in foreign multinational: 18,000 pesos;<lb/> • English-speaking call centre agent: 14-16,000 pesos + performance-based bonus;<lb/> • Japanese or Spanish-speaking call centre agent: 20-25,000 pesos + performance-based bonus<lb/> 137.<lb/> The salary inflation has made contact centre work an attractive first job for many graduates: or, to<lb/> cite an executive with many years of experience in both the Indian and Philippine call centre sector: &quot; …the<lb/> call centre job is today a low-level yuppie kind of thing in Asia. It&apos;s a good job to take home 20,000<lb/> pesos/month, it is impressive. &quot; A base salary of 15,000 pesos is just below US$ 300 and with added<lb/> incentive programmes, rights allowance and a 13 th month of salary in December, the total pay is high<lb/> compared to other professions. But the rapid growth of the industry is creating recruitment problems. Five<lb/> years ago, to recruit one qualified BPS worker, a Philippine company needed to screen around 25-30<lb/> people. To recruit a person today, the same company may need to interview 60-80 applicants. A common<lb/> worry is that limited English proficiency will restrict the industry&apos;s growth potential and increase<lb/> investments in screening and training. In a survey conducted by O2P and BPA/P (2006), enhancing<lb/> English proficiency is the area, after improving the political situation and the country&apos;s external image,<lb/> where the Philippine government can aid the industry most. 42<lb/> 138.<lb/> SMEs face the toughest challenges. Many of the small BPS companies suffer from irregular<lb/> revenue flows and rely on workers with short-term project-based contracts. This approach may be one of<lb/> the few viable ways to tackle a volatile business environment and Philippine labour laws become stringent<lb/> when a worker has been employed for more than six months. But short-term employment does not only<lb/> raise job uncertainty and staff attrition, it also reduces the incentives for companies to invest in their<lb/> employees and develop in-house expertise. The issue is aggravated since it takes considerable time to reach<lb/> adequate productivity levels that are needed to cultivate long-term business relations.<lb/> 139.<lb/> The export-oriented software sector is small and relatively immature but growth may pick up if<lb/> the government manages to improve teaching and upgrade the technical curriculum in schools. The private<lb/> sector has started to assist in enhancing the skills of IT graduates by providing teaching material and<lb/> training teachers. BPA/P is also lobbying the government to increase the communication and language<lb/> proficiency of students and teachers.<lb/></p>

			<head>Regulatory challenges<lb/></head>

			<p>140.<lb/> While there is much room to improve the domestic business environment, the BPS and ITS<lb/> sectors are better off than most other industries in the Philippines. The World Bank&apos;s doing business<lb/> indicators (see Annex C) show the inefficient process of starting and closing businesses, the slow process<lb/> of enforcing contracts and the weak protection of investors. However, the special policy that covers<lb/> companies operating in PEZA-certified buildings help companies circumvent most challenges related to<lb/> domestic regulations. The BPS and ITS sectors also face few challenges related to foreign regulations. In<lb/> the past, new U.S. regulations have even given rise to entire new services industries (see Box 8). The few<lb/> regulatory challenges that still exist are related to restrictions to movement of service workers and security<lb/> of information.<lb/></p>

			<head>Box 8. The Philippine medical transcription sector<lb/></head>

			<p>The medical transcription sector in the Philippines is young, relatively small and the fastest growing<lb/> business line in the Philippine BPS sector. It employed some 5,500 people in 2005 and many are<lb/> working from home in family businesses. The sector was created following the enactment in the U.S.<lb/> Congress in 1996 of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). This Act<lb/> requires medical institutions to keep digital records of patients. It also requires the establishment of<lb/> national standards for electronic health care transactions and its provisions address the security and<lb/> privacy of health data. The hospitals and health clinics that outsource some of their business processes<lb/> to a third party must ensure that the service provider has a framework in place to comply with HIPAA<lb/> requirements.<lb/> The establishment of the medical transcription industry in the Philippine can be dated to year 2000 when<lb/> an American company established a captive unit to provide transcription services. At its peak, the<lb/> company employed 700 people but it was soon acquired by another U.S. company which decided to<lb/> move all its activities to India. Facing unemployment, some of the workers started their own businesses<lb/> to serve the U.S. market and these companies now make up most of the Philippine medical transcription<lb/> sector.<lb/></p>

			<p>Approximately 90 percent of the U.S. market for transcription services is captured by domestic<lb/> companies but the U.S. labour pool has shrunk annually by a few percent. The job is low-paid and few<lb/> consider it a real career in the United States. International sourcing has proven an attractive solution to<lb/> American health clinics and India has captured approximately 10 percent of the U.S. market. The<lb/> Philippine medical transcription industry currently has less than 1 percent of the U.S. market.<lb/> Medical transcription companies operate 24/7 whereas call centres operate mostly during night.<lb/> Typically a company receives an audio record with dictation and a short note about a patient. It then<lb/> transcribes and puts together a report including analysis within hours before sending it back to the client.<lb/> Hospitals get the reports within 6-12 hours. There are two main concerns: labour supply and compliance<lb/> with HIPAA data privacy and security requirements. The Medical Transcription Industry Association of<lb/> the Philippines is currently working on establishing HIPAA compliance certification for the local<lb/> industry to enhance transparency and standards.<lb/></p>

			<head>Restrictions on temporary movement of service professionals<lb/></head>

			<p>141.<lb/> The Philippine BPS and ITS sectors are mainly made up of foreign multinationals and these<lb/> companies circulate few professionals between the Philippines and their home or client countries. Those<lb/> professionals that are employed by foreign multinationals have few restrictions to movement since<lb/> employees can obtain intra-corporate work permits. In addition, most service workers are employed in the<lb/> contact centre sector, which seldom circulates its employees. However, the challenges related to the<lb/> movement of natural persons are more prevalent among some of the home-grown, export-oriented ITS<lb/> companies. While these are few at present, those who face restrictions are subject to the same challenges as<lb/> the Indian software professionals: quota limitations, documentation burden, and time and unpredictability<lb/> issues related to the application process of business visas and work permits.<lb/> 142.<lb/> Most Philippine ITS companies have adopted a business model that is different from most Indian<lb/> companies. Philippine companies usually partner with companies in client countries that do sales and<lb/> marketing and take care of the onsite work component. Other companies choose to bring their clients to the<lb/> Philippines to minimise costs and reduce some of the hassle with visas and work permits. While some<lb/> companies report that they do turn down occasional business opportunities because of the lead time to<lb/> obtain visas and work permits, concerns related to the limited size of Philippine companies are more<lb/> frequently raised.<lb/> 143.<lb/> Several Indian BPS and ITS companies have negotiated with the Philippine authorities about<lb/> establishing development centres in the Philippines and some of the larger players have established<lb/> subsidiaries in Manila. There is a constraint, however, to Indian FDI because Indian citizens are<lb/> categorised as a &quot; restricted nationality &quot; by Philippine law. This regulation provides a very small quota for<lb/> the number of Indians allowed to visit the Philippines each year. Restrictions to South-South trade are<lb/> often significant but tend to receive scant attention. Several nationalities are restricted from entering the<lb/> Philippines under this policy.<lb/></p>

			<head>Restrictions on movement of information<lb/></head>

			<p>144.<lb/> The regulations related to data privacy and security that affect the Philippine BPS and ITS sectors<lb/> are the same as those affecting their Indian colleagues (and presented above). But the Philippine companies<lb/> are more dependent on the U.S. market. Regulations do not only result in overhead costs but can also<lb/> provide significant business opportunities: e.g. the HIPAA law in the United States requires medical<lb/> institutions to keep digital records of patients and this regulation initiated the medical transcription industry<lb/> which is quickly expanding in India and the Philippines.<lb/> 145.<lb/> The Philippine companies interviewed for this study report that data privacy and security<lb/> legislation has produced some useful industry standards: they may be costly to comply with but that is not<lb/> an issue since they affect companies equally. Clients demand information security assurances that exceed<lb/> those of national legislations and service providers comply in order to be in business.<lb/></p>

			<head>MAIN FINDINGS AND CONCLUDING REMARKS<lb/> Market characteristics and trade<lb/></head>

			<p>146.<lb/> The country case studies of the BPS and ITS sectors in China, the Czech Republic, India and the<lb/> Philippines illustrated how emerging markets are being integrated in the global services supply chains in<lb/> OECD economies. In 2005, the combined export revenue of the four countries came to an estimated US$<lb/> 8.7 billion for BPS and US$ 14.5 billion for ITS. OECD economies captured most of these exports. 43 The<lb/> amounts may seem modest compared to the four countries combined exports of merchandise trade (US$<lb/> 948 billion) but the economic contribution of the BPS and ITS sectors in India and the Philippines has<lb/> increased significantly.<lb/> 147.<lb/> India is leading the way among the emerging markets with its mature and internationally<lb/> competitive ITS sector. The Indian ITS sector has managed to create a highly successful industry based on<lb/> the global delivery model that has been continuously enhanced over the last decade. It has substantial<lb/> exports to both North America and Europe but depends heavily on Anglophone markets. There are signs<lb/> that China is becoming the offshore destination of choice for Japanese companies. However, it remains to<lb/> be seen whether any emerging economy can come close to rival India in size in the future.<lb/> 148.<lb/> The market for internationally sourced BPS is young, fast growing and competition is more even<lb/> between the four countries. India is the largest supplier but the Philippines has become a strong contender<lb/> for services in English, in particular for voice-based services. All four countries are likely to continue to<lb/> expand their export-oriented BPS sectors in the near future. Some trend-setting multinationals already use<lb/> all four countries to deliver BPS to different geographies where they have a comparative advantage.<lb/> 149.<lb/> The following conclusions can be drawn from the country case studies:<lb/></p>

			<table>&quot; The BPS and ITS sectors in the four countries have different client focus: while only 10-15 percent<lb/> of BPS and ITS supply is exported in China and the Czech Republic, almost 80 percent of Indian<lb/> and Philippine BPS and ITS are delivered to clients abroad.<lb/> &quot; Language and cultural proximity are decisive factors in international supply of BPS and ITS. From<lb/> a trade perspective, the Chinese and Czech BPS and ITS sectors are mainly used as nearshore<lb/> supply centres for companies in East Asia and Europe respectively. The Indian and Philippine BPS<lb/> and ITS sectors are both offshore supply centres for more distant markets.<lb/> o Czech export markets are based in the EU, including the UK and neighbouring Austria,<lb/> Germany and Slovakia;<lb/> o Chinese exports are to a large extent captured by Japan (around two-thirds of total). Other<lb/> export markets include Korea, the United States and the Asia-Pacific region;<lb/> o Indian export markets are predominantly the United States (66 percent) and UK (14<lb/> percent). Other export markets include Japan, Singapore and Germany;<lb/> o Philippine exports are captured by the United States (90 percent). Other English-speaking<lb/> countries make up much of the rest;<lb/> &quot; Trade in BPS and ITS is dominated by OECD-based multinationals but home-grown companies in<lb/> non-OECD economies are rising in prominence:<lb/> o Czech BPS and ITS exports are mostly provided by foreign multinationals;<lb/> o Philippine BPS and ITS exports are mainly provided by foreign multinationals. Home-<lb/>grown companies are increasingly providing BPS and ITS services to foreign markets;<lb/> o Chinese BPS and ITS exports are provided by both home-grown and foreign companies;<lb/> o Indian BPS exports are provided equally by home-grown and foreign companies while<lb/> home-grown companies provide two-thirds of Indian ITS exports;<lb/> &quot; The four countries have developed different export-related capabilities in the BPS and ITS field:<lb/> o The Czech Republic is mainly used as a centre for BPS and software application<lb/> development;<lb/></table>

			<p>o China has developed capabilities at the opposite ends of the value chain: it is strong at low-<lb/>end BPS and ITS work, such as data entry and testing services, while foreign<lb/> multinationals increasingly use it as a base for high-end R&amp;D services;<lb/> o India is dominating the BPS field and pushing the boundaries for the type of services that<lb/> can be traded through cross-border supply. From an offshoring point of view, it is a full<lb/> service provider. In the ITS field, India is strong at software application development and<lb/> application maintenance services. It is in the nascent stages of developing strengths in<lb/> system integration and IT consulting;<lb/> o The Philippines is presently strong in BPS supply and in particular voice-based services.<lb/></p>

			<head>Trade-related and business-related challenges<lb/></head>

			<p>150.<lb/> The most pressing challenges in the export-oriented BPS and ITS sectors relate to preoccupations<lb/> such as developing efficient operations, managing complexity in international client relationships,<lb/> establishing marketing and sales channels abroad, etc. The industry is facing relatively few barriers related<lb/> to regulations at home and in client countries. However, recruiting, training and retaining professionals are<lb/> major challenges in the industry. BPS and ITS companies can generally overcome the administrative<lb/> hurdles in local business environments thanks to special export-oriented zones where excessive red tape is<lb/> removed and gaps in infrastructure are bridged. Yet heavy investment in such zones would be unnecessary<lb/> if governments took action to improve the overall business environment and liberalised markets for key<lb/> input services. Additional challenges relate to temporary movement of service workers in the ITS sector<lb/> and data regulations in the BPS sector.<lb/></p>

			<head>Recruitment and retention<lb/></head>

			<p>&quot; The four countries face considerable supply side constraints in their quest to provide BPS and ITS<lb/> to international markets. The supply side constraints are most challenging in the ITS sector. The<lb/> issue is less severe for foreign multinationals that pay a wage premium to recruit top talent. Work<lb/> in the four countries&apos; BPS and ITS sectors attract highly skilled workers. This is in sharp contrast<lb/> to some of the BPS work in OECD countries, in particular in the voice-based field, where work is<lb/> poorly paid and attrition high.<lb/> o Recruitment and retention of junior personnel: although China, India and the Philippines<lb/> produce large numbers of university graduates, few are suited to work in the industry and<lb/> serve foreign clients. Most graduates have inadequate language skills, communication<lb/> skills and business acumen for client interaction, and lack the necessary level of technical<lb/> training. Yet the levels of remuneration entice many university students and graduates to<lb/> look for opportunities in the industry. It takes significant investment in the recruitment<lb/> process to identify the right workers. In the ITS sector, it also takes significant investment<lb/> in training. Hence, staff retention is crucial given that new professionals become<lb/> productive with experience. Staff attrition is high in the BPS sector and for many<lb/> companies in the ITS sector as well.<lb/> o Recruitment and retention of senior personnel: the export-oriented BPS and ITS sectors<lb/> have existed only for a few years in China, the Czech Republic and the Philippines. The<lb/> industry has had little time to nurture project managers and senior managers with industry-<lb/>specific experience. Those that are available work to a large extent for foreign<lb/> multinationals. As a result, many companies recruit senior personnel from abroad and this<lb/> practise comes at a high cost. The situation is extra challenging in China where the<lb/> industry to a large extent relies on the returning Chinese Diaspora. The situation is less of a<lb/> problem in India where the industry has had more time to build capacity. Strong demand<lb/> has resulted in rapid salary inflation for experienced professionals.<lb/></p>

			<head>Regulatory challenges<lb/></head>

			<p>&quot; Regulatory and administrative challenges in the domestic business environments of the studied<lb/> countries are considerable except in the Czech Republic. The challenges affect both home-grown<lb/> and foreign companies that operate in China, India and the Philippines. While domestic service<lb/> markets are highly protected in the three Asian countries, the development of a strong domestic<lb/> export-oriented industry is high on the agenda of governments. The negative effect of the local<lb/> business environment on export-oriented BPS and ITS companies is greatly reduced in the<lb/> environments that they operate: the software and technology parks/buildings that host the<lb/> companies generally offer ready-to-use infrastructure in terms of office space, utility services and<lb/> ICT services; streamlined business administration and financial incentives. Policies that target the<lb/> investment climate in specific industries may be unfair to other industries in the economy. But<lb/> their impact on the local BPS and ITS sectors studied in this paper has been positive.<lb/> &quot; In the ITS sector, temporary movement of personnel between home country and client country can<lb/> pose significant challenges in the business of international outsourcing. The issue is most pertinent<lb/> for the Indian ITS sector which to a large extent is dependent on a global delivery model that sends<lb/> professionals for longer visits to client premises. Unpredictable, slow and costly administrative<lb/> procedures for business visas and work permits, and quota limitations for work permits have<lb/> become serious issues for some companies.<lb/> &quot; In the BPS sector, and to a lesser extent in the ITS sector, certain data privacy and security<lb/> legislation can have a negative effect on international outsourcing. New regulations have also<lb/> created entirely new business opportunities, as seen in the medical transcription sector. Data<lb/> privacy and security regulations are not necessarily regarded as negative as long as they are non-<lb/>discriminatory in nature. Technological solutions allow companies in most instances to comply<lb/> with the rules and clients generally require their suppliers to live up to standards that are higher<lb/> than existing legislation.<lb/></p>

A rough estimate is that 0.1-0.2 million workers are employed in the sector.<lb/> 46 The figure is estimated from data presented by Nasscom (2006). The combined workforce in the export-oriented sectors of ITS, engineering and R&amp;D, and<lb/> software products was an estimated 0.51 million in March 2006. Revenue generated in the ITS sector made up 75 percent of total revenue in the combined sectors.<lb/> 75 percent of 0.51 million is 0.38 million.<lb/></table>

			<head>Additional thoughts<lb/></head>

			<p>In the future, more and more BPS and ITS multinationals will do business where they do it best and where<lb/> it makes most financial sense. This is likely to imply, among other things, that:<lb/> o The very great majority of service workers in the BPS and ITS sectors will continue to be based<lb/> within close proximity of their clients;<lb/> o The supply of BPS and ITS will have a more international footprint:<lb/> • OECD-based multinationals will boost their presence in emerging markets, which will<lb/> allow them to tap into rapidly growing domestic markets for outsourced services and gain<lb/> access to a global talent pool. International outsourcing will with time give rise to entire<lb/> new service sectors due to the multitude of business models that become economically<lb/> viable;<lb/></p>

			<table>• Leading BPS and ITS companies in emerging markets will move into OECD markets to<lb/> establish local supply capacity when the limited markets for more easily &quot; offshoreable &quot;<lb/> services get saturated. As a result, more and more workers in OECD countries will work<lb/> for companies originating in non-OECD countries;<lb/> o Intensified competition for traded services will allow more companies to increase productivity<lb/> through the procurement of better and cheaper services -which in turn will help stimulate growth<lb/> in IT-intensive industries;<lb/></table>

			<p>o The increasing integration of emerging markets in international supply chains will stimulate<lb/> economic growth in these countries and endow them with home-grown IT expertise necessary to<lb/> help bridge some of the productivity gaps with OECD markets;<lb/> o South-south trade is just starting to take off in the BPS and ITS sectors and will expand rapidly in<lb/> the future.<lb/></p>

			<head>International sourcing of ITS and some potential implications for labour markets<lb/></head>

			<p>151.<lb/> OECD (2005a) has previously identified the main adjustment challenges that OECD economies<lb/> may face due to the integration of non-OECD economies in international supply chains. In particular it<lb/> examined the prospective effect on EU and U.S. labour markets and concluded that the practice of<lb/> international sourcing can be mutually beneficial for low-income and high-income countries alike but open<lb/> markets are essential to reap the gains and to manage adjustment. Of equal importance is a well<lb/> functioning labour market that facilitates labour adjustment resulting from trade liberalisation and rapid<lb/> technology diffusion.<lb/> 152.<lb/> While trade in BPS and ITS is predominantly conducted between OECD countries, these services<lb/> are increasingly traded between OECD and non-OECD countries. 47 Depending on overall growth in the<lb/> service sectors in question, international sourcing could potentially result in a net job loss for some<lb/> occupations or a slower pace of job expansion than would otherwise occur. OECD (2005a) concluded that<lb/> adjustment pressure while real is likely to remain modest in OECD labour markets. There are several<lb/> reasons for this:<lb/> 1. Most BPS and ITS services will remain non-tradable since their provision requires face-to-face<lb/> interaction, frequent communication or proximity to clients.<lb/> 2. The various predictions of job losses resulting from international sourcing are minor in relation to<lb/> the overall destruction and creation of jobs in labour markets.<lb/></p>

			<p>3. International sourcing is a positive sum situation: many jobs are kept and created during the<lb/> international sourcing process while efficiency gains are transferred to consumers in terms of lower<lb/> prices or re-invested in new business opportunities.<lb/> 4. The labour-cost arbitrage incentive is becoming less pronounced as low-income country service<lb/> providers export increasingly sophisticated services at higher prices.<lb/> 153.<lb/> Much analytical work has been presented on the impact of offshoring in the BPS and ITS sectors<lb/> in OECD economies. Some studies have tried to estimate the outer limits of total service jobs that could<lb/> potentially face international competition. 48 These estimates indicate that the great majority of service jobs<lb/> will remain unaffected by international competition. Depending on the assumptions on which the<lb/> assessments rely, estimates have varied between 5 percent and 19 percent. However, what can possibly be<lb/> supplied from a remote location is very different from what can be supplied with adequate service quality<lb/> and with an economically compelling business model. Some services (or fragments of services) that can<lb/> easily be identified, digitised and standardised may be traded in the future. But most work tasks do not<lb/> match such a profile and it makes remote cross-border supply more complex, and hence more costly, to<lb/> manage.<lb/> 154.<lb/> Some studies have tried to predict the number of jobs that is likely to be provided through cross-<lb/>border supply in the future. 49 Other studies have tried to quantify the economic impact of international<lb/> sourcing on a country level. 50 These quantification exercises have generally concluded that the initial<lb/> worries that offshoring of services will have serious consequences for OECD labour markets are largely<lb/> unfounded. 51 Emerging markets will increase their share of world trade in BPS and ITS and the economic<lb/> gains, on balance, can be significant in both importing and exporting countries. Many developing countries<lb/> have realised the new business opportunities that this type of trade give rise to and some are pursuing a<lb/> more active agenda of liberalising service markets. However, while international trade in BPS and ITS can<lb/> bring significant gains to both sides of the transaction, it is likely to reduce the demand for certain job<lb/> categories in OECD economies.<lb/></p>

			<head>The scope for labour market adjustment in the ITS sector 52<lb/></head>

			<p>155.<lb/> Some of the most pressing issues for BPS and ITS companies that operate in emerging markets<lb/> are related to supply-side constraints. The McKinsey Global Institute has presented a series of<lb/> comprehensive studies that examine the supply and demand for labour in a number of service sectors<lb/> (</p>

			<figure>MGI, 2005a-b). They forecast that the annual growth rate for ITS spending in the 2003-2008 period will<lb/> 48 See e.g. Blinder (2005), van Welsum and Vickery (2005), Bardhan and Kroll (2003), ILO (2001) and World Bank<lb/> (1995). See also the discussion presented by Bhagwati et al. (2004).<lb/> 49 See Engman (2005) for an overview. MGI (2005c)<lb/> 50 See e.g. Blanco et al. (2005), Mann (2003), MGI (2003, 2004), Evalueserve (2003, 2004), Deloitte Research<lb/> (2003).<lb/> 51 See e.g. WTO (2005), OECD (2005a), Bhagwati et al. (2004), Drezner (2004).<lb/> 52 In 2005, ITS exports in China, the Czech Republic, India and the Philippines made up 60 percent of combined BPS<lb/> and ITS exports.<lb/></figure>

			<p>be 4 percent in Western Europe, 5 percent in the United States, and 9 percent in the Asia Pacific region. 53<lb/> The figures imply that the combined demand for ITS in the main markets for these services will grow by<lb/> some US$ 20 billion annually. This is significantly more than the combined value of all ITS exports from<lb/> China, the Czech Republic, India and the Philippines.<lb/> 156.<lb/> Competition from emerging markets is almost exclusively concentrated in the field of custom<lb/> application development and application maintenance, and to a lesser extent in system integration. In 2006,<lb/> an estimated 10 percent of demand for ITS employment in high-income countries was covered by low-cost<lb/> countries. This share is expected to increase in the future but due to the expected rise in demand for ITS,<lb/> annual ITS employment in high-income countries is expected to grow by 1 percent per year between 2003<lb/> and 2008.<lb/> 157.<lb/> While the pressure on overall ITS employment is likely to be modest, there may well be cost<lb/> pressure for certain types of services, and shifts in demand for ITS job occupations, as OECD-based<lb/> companies refocus their operations on higher value services. 54 In the United States, which is the largest<lb/> importer of BPS and ITS from emerging markets, the share of high-value ITS occupations (system<lb/> analysts, software engineers) have expanded while mid-value (software programmers, database/network<lb/> administrators) and low-value ITS occupations (computer support specialists, programmer aides) have<lb/> contracted (MGI, 2005a-b). This trend is in line with the growth in offshoring of low-value work to cost-<lb/>effective countries in Asia.<lb/> 158.<lb/> The recruitment challenges in China, India and the Philippines stem from the fact that relatively<lb/> few graduates have the set of skills to work for foreign multinationals or serve international markets.<lb/> <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref>, which is based on interviews with 83 human resource managers of multinationals, reveals that<lb/> only one in ten Chinese engineers have the necessary profile for employment. A somewhat higher share of<lb/> engineers is suitable for work in multinationals in India and the Philippines and more so in the Czech<lb/> Republic. Both the Czech Republic and the Philippines have rather strong competence in finance and<lb/> accounting. <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref> illustrates that the limited profiles of young professionals in China and India<lb/> drastically reduce the available talent pools. Hence the large populations of countries like China and India<lb/> do not commensurate with the number of service professionals that they can provide. Quantity is not the<lb/> problem in these countries – quality is.<lb/></p>
