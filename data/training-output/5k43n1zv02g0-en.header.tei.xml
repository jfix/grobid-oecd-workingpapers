	<div type="abstract">This paper sets out to examine the impact of the quality of local and regional governments on the<lb/> returns of investment, focusing on the returns of EU structural and cohesion funds. Despite the<lb/> widespread belief that the quality of government affects the returns of public investments, whether this<lb/> is effectively the case has seldom been proved. Using primary data on quality of government collected<lb/> by the Quality of Government Institute, combined with World Bank Global Governance Indicators<lb/> data, we conduct a two-way fixed effect panel regression model for a total of 169 in European regions<lb/> during the period 1996 to 2007. The results of the analysis underline the importance of the quality of<lb/> government both as a direct determinant of economic growth, as well as a moderator of the efficiency<lb/> of structural and cohesion funds expenditure. Our analysis finds that both EU investments targeting<lb/> regions and quality of government make a difference for regional economic growth, but that above a<lb/> significant threshold level of expenditure, the quality of government is the key factor determining the<lb/> returns of public investment. In many of the regions receiving the bulk of structural funds, greater<lb/> levels of cohesion expenditure would, in the best case scenario, only lead to a marginal improvement<lb/> in economic growth, unless the quality of government is significantly enhanced.<lb/> JEL Classification: O43, R11<lb/></div>
