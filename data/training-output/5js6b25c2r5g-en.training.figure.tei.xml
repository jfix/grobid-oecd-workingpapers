            <figDesc>Total green bilateral ODA committed by the members of the OECD DAC reached 30% of total ODA<lb/> commitments to the country over 2010-12 (USD 230 million), up from 6% of total bilateral ODA<lb/> commitments over 2004-06 (USD 90 million; Chart 2), increasing at a time when total ODA volumes were<lb/> 8<lb/> This paper only provides a partial picture of total green ODA flows to Zambia, based on the activities of bilateral<lb/> providers of development co-operation. An integrated, full picture including multilateral providers is still missing at<lb/> the time of writing.<lb/> 9<lb/> Total bilateral green ODA commitments are calculated using the OECD DAC CRS as being the total ODA<lb/> commitments marked as principal or significant with the environment marker, plus additional ODA to climate change<lb/> adaptation marked principal or significant, additional ODA to climate change mitigation marked principal or<lb/> significant, additional ODA to biodiversity marked principal or significant, and additional ODA to desertification<lb/> marked principal or significant. Care has been taken to aggregate these figures to ensure there is no double counting<lb/> where activities target multiple environmental objectives. For a further description of the CRS database and the Rio<lb/> markers methodology, see Annex 1. falling (Chart 1). These green flows include ODA targeting local environment objectives, as well as global<lb/> objectives enshrined in the three Rio Conventions (biodiversity, climate change and desertification). 10<lb/> Chart 2.

This suggests<lb/> high levels of mainstreaming of green concerns across the portfolios of development co-operation<lb/> providers.<lb/> 10<lb/> OECD DAC members did not monitor all their green development finance during 2004-09, e.g. monitoring climate<lb/> change mitigation only became mandatory in 2006, and climate change adaptation was only monitored after 2010.

Note: The ODA commitments to biodiversity, climate, desertification and local<lb/> environmental objectives displayed in this chart cannot be aggregated, as activities may target multiple objectives. Aggregated<lb/> figures, taking into account any overlaps between finance targeting multiple objectives have been taken into account for the<lb/> preparation of Chart 2. For further information on the methodology employed to avoid double counting, see Annex 1.<lb/> Looking at the components of green bilateral ODA commitments shows that the increase since 2004-06<lb/> has been primarily driven by climate-related ODA (Chart 3). Climate change adaptation represented 14%<lb/> of total climate-related ODA in 2010-12, reaching USD 46 million per year on average, while climate<lb/> change mitigation-related ODA accounted for 0.4% or USD 1.5 million over 2010-12 on average per year.<lb/> The remainder, or over 85% or USD 272 million per year on average targeted both climate change<lb/> adaptation and mitigation. During the same period, too, biodiversity-and desertification-related ODA<lb/> halved in volume to USD 19 million and USD 10 million respectively. Providers are also seeking synergies<lb/> within and across their green portfolios (Chart 4). An estimated USD 10 million or 7% of environment-<lb/>related ODA also targets all other green objectives; USD 17 million or 13% of environment-related ODA<lb/> also targets climate change mitigation and adaptation objectives; and all of the biodiversity and<lb/> desertification-related ODA, and virtually all of the adaptation-related ODA targets at least one other green<lb/> objective. That being said, 70% of total green ODA still targets climate change mitigation alone (USD 54<lb/> million); and 44% of environment-related ODA targets local environmental objectives only (USD 58<lb/> million).</figDesc>

During 2008-12 (covering the 2010-12 period of Fast-start Finance period), climate<lb/> financing to Zambia amounted to USD 24 million, or USD 8 million on average per year.

In addition, a grant from Japan&apos;s Fast Start Finance focused<lb/> on climate change adaptation.
