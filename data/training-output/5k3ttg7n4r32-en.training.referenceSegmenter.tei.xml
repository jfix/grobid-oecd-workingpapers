        <bibl>Banking Union. CESEE policy-makers would thus get a seat at the ECB&apos;s Supervisory Board and<lb/> contribute to the supervisory assessment and decision-making on these large European banks.<lb/> </bibl>
<bibl>Next, capital is a good indicator of the health of a financial institution. Supervisors should supplement<lb/> the Tier 1 Capital Ratio (based on risk-weighted assets) with a leverage ratio (based on unweighted total<lb/> assets), as the risk-weighted approach shows some deficiencies. The simple leverage ratio provides a<lb/> useful backstop. It is also helpful to complement the regulatory ratios, which are based on book values,<lb/> with market-based indicators. We therefore introduce the market based leverage ratio (based on the stock<lb/> price of a bank&apos;s equity) as a signal for supervisors. Based on this indicator, we find an earlier reported<lb/> capital shortfall of EUR 84 billion.<lb/> </bibl>
<bibl>Finally, a strong and decisive recapitalisation is key to get the banking sector back in the good<lb/> equilibrium, in which they contribute to economic growth. Our simulations show that well capitalised<lb/> banks support lending. It is important to conduct the Asset Quality Review by the ECB and the Stress Test<lb/> by the EBA as swift as possible. The outcome of these joint tests should be announced in terms of absolute<lb/> euro amounts instead as a capital ratio. In the latter case, banks may restore their capital ratio by reducing<lb/> assets (deleveraging) instead of increasing capital. Banks should also get a short time frame (up to 3 to<lb/> 6 months) to restore capital.<lb/> </bibl>
