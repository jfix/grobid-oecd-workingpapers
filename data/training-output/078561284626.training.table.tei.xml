            <figDesc>See Hann et al. (2004).<lb/> 32 This argument applies even if fair value valuation methods can be reliably applied (see Kortleve and Ponds (2006).<lb/> 33 Burkhardt and Strausz (2004) and Plantin et al. (2005) show how fair value accounting may heighten incentives for<lb/> procyclical investment behaviour among banks and insurance companies. A similar argument can be made<lb/> about pension funds.<lb/> 34 Borio and Tsatsaronis (2005) also suggest disclosing information on ―measurement error, be this as a result of<lb/> model error or of intentional misreporting‖.<lb/> 35 A report by the Association of British Insurers (2007) models a pension fund&apos;s cash flows and compares them<lb/> against the FRS 17 pension deficit measure. It finds that ―there is no clear correlation between the size of<lb/> the FRS 17 deficit and the financial health of the plan. A decrease in staff turnover, for example, had the<lb/> largest impact on the FRS 17 deficit even though the scheme remained financially solvent‖. companies have continued to use such assumptions despite the fact that returns have been substantially<lb/> lower for the past five years. According to Coronado and Sharpe (2003), return smoothing contributed to<lb/> an overvaluation of equity prices of 5% on average after the bubble burst in 2000. Gold (2001) argues that<lb/> the ―opaque‖ pension accounting system has encouraged an overexposure to equities that would be<lb/> corrected if it was based on a fair value methodology.</figDesc>
