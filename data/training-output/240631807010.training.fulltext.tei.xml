			<figure>L&apos;adoption de l&apos;euro par la République slovaque: les implications pour l&apos;inflation et les taux d&apos;intérêt<lb/> En janvier 2009, la République slovaque adoptera l&apos;euro et deviendra le 16ème membre de la zone euro. Ce<lb/> document examine les implications de l&apos;adoption de l&apos;euro dans la République slovaque pour l&apos;inflation et les taux<lb/> d&apos;intérêt avec une tentative d&apos;évaluer quantitativement leur taille probable aussi bien que leurs conséquences pour la<lb/> population. L&apos;analyse empirique – qui se sert de l&apos;expérience des pays de la zone euro de la première vague – suggère<lb/> que le changement des liquidités soit très probablement associé à une augmentation modérée des prix à la<lb/> consommation, estimée à peu près à 0.3 %. Les mesures politiques pour réduire cet effet incluent des campagnes<lb/> publiques d&apos;information, la conversion des prix publiquement administrés avec le taux de conversion exact et la<lb/> réduction d&apos;obstacles administratifs pour augmenter l&apos;offre. Les pertes de pouvoir d&apos;achat mineures associées à cette<lb/> augmentation des prix ne seront pas également distribuées à travers la population; les ménages aux revenus plus<lb/> élevés et les familles avec des enfants pourraient être frappés plus durement que les autres. Bien que le taux de<lb/> change vis-à-vis de la zone euro soit irrévocablement fixé, les appréciations passées de la couronne slovaque<lb/> pourraient encore se répercuter sur les prix à la consommation; l&apos;effet cumulatif des effets retardés est évalué à<lb/> environ 1½ pour cent jusqu&apos;au milieu de 2009. À plus long terme, l&apos;effet Balassa-Samuelson et d&apos;autres facteurs<lb/> affectant des économies en rattrapage peuvent accroître l&apos;inflation slovaque au-dessus du niveau de la zone euro.<lb/> Comme les marchés financiers ont déjà entièrement tenu compte de l&apos;adhésion de l&apos;euro, aucun effet immédiat sur les<lb/> taux d&apos;intérêt de grande clientèle à court terme ou à long terme n&apos;est attendu pour janvier 2009. À plus long terme, on<lb/> peut s&apos;attendre à ce que l&apos;adoption de l&apos;euro favorise l&apos;intégration financière, menant ainsi à une convergence des taux<lb/> d&apos;intérêt aux particuliers vers les niveaux de la zone euro. Cette réduction de taux d&apos;intérêt aux particuliers profitera au<lb/> grand public avec des emprunteurs hypothécaires récoltant probablement les plus grands avantages. Un risque<lb/> potentiel lié aux taux d&apos;intérêt réels bas est l&apos;apparition d&apos;une phase d&apos;essor suivie d&apos;une récession ; une politique<lb/> fiscale prudente et des nouvelles réformes structurelles, y compris l&apos;amélioration de la compétitivité, aideraient à<lb/> résister à de tels développements.<lb/> ECO/WKP(2008)40<lb/> 14.

			<figure>ECO/WKP(2008)40<lb/> THE EURO CHANGEOVER IN THE SLOVAK REPUBLIC:<lb/> IMPLICATIONS FOR INFLATION AND INTEREST RATES<lb/> by<lb/> Felix Hüfner and Isabell Koske 1<lb/></figure>

			<p>This paper investigates the implications of euro adoption in Slovakia for inflation and interest rates<lb/> with an attempt to quantify their likely size as well as their consequences for the general public. The<lb/> following main findings emerge from the analysis:<lb/> • The cash changeover can be expected to lead to significant price increases in a number of sectors,<lb/> most notably in sectors related to recreational activities. The impact on the aggregate HICP,<lb/> however, is likely to be small. Applying the experience of existing euro area member countries<lb/> on the case of the Slovak Republic, the cash changeover is estimated to increase aggregate<lb/> consumer prices by 0</p>

			<head>.32% between July 2008 and July 2009.<lb/></head>

			<p>• The price increase implies that a typical household will incur additional consumption<lb/> expenditures of SKK 504 (€ 16.7) per year as a result of the changeover. The effect will weigh<lb/> more heavily on citizens in higher income quintiles as they spend a larger share of their income<lb/> on recreational activities. The consumption expenditures of citizens in the highest income<lb/> quintile are estimated to increase by 0.11% more than those of citizens in the lowest quintile.<lb/></p>

			<p>• Product market competition appears to have played a major role in determining the extent of euro<lb/> changeover-related price increases in the first-wave euro area countries. As such, the overall<lb/> lighter product market regulation in the Slovak Republic compared to other euro area members<lb/> and the associated higher level of competition should help containing price increases around the<lb/> euro changeover.<lb/> • Although the overall actual price effect of the cash changeover was very small in most euro area<lb/> countries, inflation perceptions increased notably after the changeover as there was a widespread<lb/> feeling among the public that the euro had brought about significant price hikes. Whilst such a<lb/> widening of the perception gap in the Slovak Republic, if it occurs, might contribute to a negative<lb/> attitude of citizens towards the euro, it is unlikely to have consequences for actual inflation. This<lb/> is because in most member countries the effect was perceived as temporary by citizens so that<lb/> inflation expectations remained unaffected or even declined in the aftermath of the changeover</p>

The paper has been drafted under the supervision of<lb/> Andreas Wörgötter (Head of CS5 Division). They are grateful to Andrew Dean, Peter Höller and other<lb/> colleagues in the Economics Department as well as participants of the EDRC seminar on 9 July 2008 on<lb/> the euro adoption in the Slovak Republic for helpful comments. A voluntary financial contribution by the<lb/> Slovak government is gratefully acknowledged.<lb/> ECO/WKP(2008)40<lb/> • As with euro adoption, the conversion rate between the Slovak koruna and the euro will be<lb/> irrevocably fixed, the effect of exchange rate changes vis-à-vis the euro on inflation will<lb/> disappear. As the pass-through is operating with long lags, exchange rate changes prior to euro<lb/> adoption will still affect domestic inflation for some time going forward. This lagging effect is<lb/> likely to reduce consumer price inflation by 1.5% over the period June 2008 to June 2009.<lb/> • Exchange rates vis-à-vis countries outside the euro area will continue to change after euro<lb/> accession. As the euro tends to depreciate against the currencies of countries like Poland,<lb/> Hungary and the Czech Republic, which account for 30% of Slovak imports, imports from these<lb/> countries will become more expensive in euro terms, thereby exerting upward pressure on<lb/> aggregate inflation in the Slovak Republic.<lb/></table>

			<p>• The strong real exchange rate of the Slovak koruna over the past years was at least partly backed<lb/> by the development of economic fundamentals such as the strong rise in productivity in the open<lb/> sectors driven by large FDI inflows. The real appreciation is likely to continue for some time<lb/> going forward, although to a lesser extent than in the past. With the nominal exchange rate<lb/> irrevocably fixed against the euro, any real appreciation vis-à-vis the euro will be reflected in an<lb/> inflation rate that exceeds the average inflation rate in the remaining euro area countries.<lb/></p>

			<p>• On capital markets, the adoption of the euro will lead to an equalisation of short-term interest<lb/> rates and the vanishing of the exchange rate risk premium in bond yields vis-à-vis the euro area.<lb/> With one-month money market rates already at the euro area level and measures of the exchange<lb/> rate risk premium near zero, this adjustment already took place. The remaining government bond<lb/> spread vis-à-vis Germany of around 50 basis points is in line with other euro area member<lb/> countries of similar perceived creditworthiness and is thus likely to persist after euro adoption.<lb/></p>

			<p>• Retail interest rates in the Slovak Republic are significantly above euro area levels for loans (and<lb/> below euro area levels for deposits). In particular, Slovak households pay more for their<lb/> household consumption and mortgage loans with long interest rate fixation periods than the<lb/> average euro area household. Deeper financial integration following euro adoption is likely to<lb/> lead to a convergence of Slovak retail interest rates towards euro area levels. This process may<lb/> extend over several years, however. In case interest rates fully converge to euro area levels,<lb/> interest rates for a typical mortgage may be up to 1.5 percentage points lower.<lb/> • Among the population, borrowers will benefit more from the retail interest rate convergence<lb/> (through a downward adjustment to euro area levels) than depositors (through an upward<lb/> adjustment of deposit rates to euro area levels) and households will benefit more than non-<lb/>financial companies. Most of the benefits of retail interest rate convergence will accrue to the<lb/> population in the Bratislava region, as most of the loans and deposits are located in this area.<lb/> Lower mortgage loan interest rates are also likely to support the development of house prices,<lb/> although the speed and extent of the impact is surrounded by considerable uncertainty.<lb/></p>

			<p>• Potential policy measures to deal with the impact of the euro changeover differ by the time<lb/> horizon they aim at. In the short-term, measures could be taken to reduce the effect of the cash<lb/> changeover, for example by intensifying public information campaigns, by converting publicly<lb/> administered prices with the conversion rate and by reducing administrative obstacles to increase<lb/> supply. Any programs to compensate for the price level effects of euro adoption should be<lb/> limited to low income groups and social partners should be encouraged to exclude changeover<lb/> costs from wage and price negotiations. Over the medium term, competition enhancing measures<lb/> are important in order to raise productivity in the services sectors. In addition, measures to<lb/> counter a potential boom-bust cycle induced by low real interest rates, in particular in the housing<lb/> market, are essential.<lb/></p>

			<head>1.<lb/> Introduction<lb/></head>

			<p>1.<lb/> On 1 January 2009, the Slovak Republic will adopt the euro and will become the 16th member of<lb/> the euro area. Euro area membership will have wide-ranging consequences for the Slovak economy. The<lb/> aim of this paper is not to present a comprehensive evaluation of all effects of the adoption of the euro, but<lb/> rather to focus on the likely consequences of euro adoption for inflation and interest rates in the Slovak<lb/> economy, presenting own estimates as well as drawing on the experience of earlier entries into the euro<lb/> area.<lb/></p>

			<head>2.<lb/> Euro adoption</head>

			<p>in the Slovak Republic will be carried out according to a &apos;big bang&apos; scenario with<lb/> the euro being introduced simultaneously in both cash and non-cash circulation. The Slovak Republic<lb/> opted for a dual circulation period of 16 days during which cash payments will be possible in both koruna<lb/> and euro. To prepare the general public for the introduction of the euro, the government has started a wide-<lb/>ranging information campaign with special attention given to sensitive groups such as the elderly and to<lb/> economically weaker regions of the Slovak Republic. Nonetheless, in a survey conducted on behalf of the<lb/> European Commission in September 2007, less than half of all citizens answered that they felt well or very<lb/> well informed about the euro. To help consumers getting accustomed to the new currency, dual pricing in<lb/> koruna and euro will start shortly after the announcement of the conversion rate. Dual pricing will be<lb/> mandatory until the end of 2009, although sellers can continue dual pricing on a voluntary basis for another<lb/> six months.<lb/></p>

			<head>3.<lb/> As all assets and liabilities denominated in Slovak koruna will be converted in January 2009</head>

			<p>into<lb/> euro at a fixed conversion rate (already determined in July 2008), euro adoption should in principle not<lb/> have any immediate impact on prices. A price effect can only arise if another conversion rate than the<lb/> official one is used for converting koruna prices into euro. Motivations for such behaviour could be menu<lb/> costs that sellers pass on to consumers, rounding of prices to obtain a price pattern that is attractive in euro,<lb/> or simply the exploitation of pricing power on the side of sellers. The experience of existing euro area<lb/> countries suggests that the cash changeover into euro is typically associated with an -albeit small -price<lb/> level increase. Slovak citizens appear to expect similar price level effects for the Slovak Republic with<lb/> 83% of all respondents in the September 2007 Eurobarometer survey saying that they expect the<lb/> changeover to be associated with increasing prices.<lb/> 4.<lb/> Adopting the euro as a new currency will also give rise to more medium-term effects on prices,<lb/> notably for a country with a lower income level than the euro area average like the Slovak Republic. As the<lb/> price level in such countries typically converges to the higher price levels of more advanced economies,<lb/> their real exchange rates tend to appreciate. In the past the real appreciation was to a large extent reflected<lb/> in an appreciation of the nominal exchange rate of the Slovak koruna. With euro adoption, however, this<lb/> channel is no longer available and the catch-up process will show up in higher inflation rates rather than<lb/> exchange rate appreciation. This is also reflected in the vanishing of the pass-through of exchange rate<lb/> changes (vis-à-vis the euro) to consumer prices. In the past, exchange rate appreciation has helped to<lb/> dampen consumer price inflation by reducing import prices. Although exchange rate changes prior to euro<lb/> adoption will still help to contain inflation for some time going forward, it can be expected that this<lb/> disinflationary effect disappears after approximately two years and be replaced by an inflationary effect as<lb/> the euro is depreciating against the currencies of other central and eastern European countries that are an<lb/> important source for Slovak imports.<lb/> 5.<lb/> Apart from the conversion of prices, the process of euro changeover will involve the loss of<lb/> monetary autonomy as the monetary policy decision-making process is transferred to the European Central<lb/> Bank (with the Slovak central bank governor participating in the process through membership in the ECB<lb/> Governing Council). First of all, this means that short-term interest rates set by the central bank are<lb/> determined on the basis of the euro area as a whole, instead of only the Slovak Republic. This change,<lb/> ECO/WKP(2008)40<lb/> however, will not lead to immediate adjustments in interest rates in January 2009 given that Slovak<lb/> monetary policy was already prior to that date closely interlinked with euro area short-term interest rates as<lb/> the koruna was participating in ERM II. In fact, as capital markets are forward-looking, expectations<lb/> regarding euro membership have already led to a significant convergence of Slovak long-term interest rates<lb/> towards the euro area level. At the retail level, however, there is still ample room for convergence and it<lb/> can be expected that over the medium term Slovak retail interest rates will converge towards the prevailing<lb/> euro area levels as euro adoption will foster financial integration through more transparency, lower<lb/> transaction costs and more competition. This convergence in retail interest rate is likely to bring along<lb/> benefits for both households and non-financial companies.<lb/> 6.<lb/> Through the transfer of monetary policy to the ECB, euro area membership will also have real<lb/> effects on the economy. As a catch-up country the Slovak Republic tends to grow faster and exhibit higher<lb/> inflation than the euro area average country so that its natural interest rate is likely to be higher. This<lb/> means that, during the catch-up period, interest rates will tend to be set lower than otherwise, stimulating<lb/> investment and discouraging savings. This will pose challenges for policy-makers, especially with respect<lb/> to a potential boom-bust cycle of the economy, but also for the rate of return for ageing-related, necessary<lb/> pension savings.<lb/> 7.<lb/> The remainder of this paper is organised as follows. Section 2 discusses the impact of euro<lb/> adoption on inflation. Whilst the first part of the section focuses on the immediate changeover-related price<lb/> effects, the second part focuses on structural aspects of euro adoption for the exchange rate pass-through<lb/> and the Balassa-Samuelson effect. Section 3 then investigates the impact of the changeover on different<lb/> interest rates, notably money market rates, government bond rates and retail rates. Section 4 then uses the<lb/> obtained results to quantify the associated impact on Slovak consumers. Section 5 concludes with some<lb/> policy recommendations.<lb/></p>

			<head>2.<lb/> The impact of euro adoption on prices<lb/> 2.1<lb/> Immediate price level effects of the cash changeover<lb/></head>

			<p>8.<lb/> The euro cash changeover that took place in 2002 in 12 EMU countries triggered a heated<lb/> discussion about its effect on prices in literally all countries. Two years after the changeover, 95% of euro<lb/> area consumers had the impression that the conversion of prices into euro had been associated with rising<lb/> prices. Similar concerns were raised in Slovenia when it joined the euro area in 2007. Against this<lb/> background, this section will review the empirical evidence on the price level effect of the cash changeover<lb/> in the existing euro area member countries, present results on the likely effect in the Slovak Republic and<lb/> analyze the role of product market competition for the size of the observed price increases around the<lb/> changeover.<lb/></p>

			<head>2.1.1<lb/> Existing empirical evidence<lb/></head>

			<p>9.<lb/> Most empirical studies on the price level effect of the euro changeover focus on individual euro<lb/> area member countries. Examples include: <ref type="biblio">Buchwald et al. (2002)</ref>, Chlumsky and Engelhardt (2002) and<lb/> Deutsche <ref type="biblio">Bundesbank (2002, 2004</ref>) for Germany; <ref type="biblio">Folkertsma et al. (2002)</ref> for the Netherlands; National<lb/> Bank of <ref type="biblio">Belgium (2002)</ref> for Belgium; <ref type="biblio">Pollan (2002)</ref> for Austria; <ref type="biblio">Santos et al. (2002)</ref> for Portugal; and,<lb/> more recently, Eurostat (2007) and the Institute of Macroeconomic Analysis and Development (IMAD)<lb/> (2007) for Slovenia; and Eurostat (2008) for Malta. These studies commonly find that price increases were<lb/> not a general phenomenon but limited to certain categories of goods and services, so that their impact on<lb/> aggregate consumer price inflation was modest. Most studies estimate the effect at around 0.2 to 0.3%<lb/> which is in line with the estimate published by <ref type="biblio">Eurostat (2003)</ref> for the euro area as a whole (see <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<figure>ECO/WKP(2008)40<lb/></figure>

			<p>Nonetheless, prices have risen markedly in some sectors, particularly in some service sectors where the<lb/> above mentioned studies have singled out restaurants and catering, hairdressers, cinemas, and dry cleaning<lb/> as sectors with significant price increases.<lb/></p>

			<p>the impact is significantly different from zero (France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, the<lb/> Netherlands, Portugal and Spain).<lb/> 10.<lb/> One reason why the euro changeover could have been associated with rising prices is that<lb/> retailers may have passed on the menu costs of adjusting their business to the euro on to their customers.<lb/> While Deutsche Bundesbank (2004) identifies several German service sectors where prices increased by<lb/> more than was justified by changes in the underlying cost factors, <ref type="biblio">Hobijn et al. (2004)</ref> argue that the price<lb/> increases observed around the cash changeover generally closely match those predicted by a simple model<lb/> of menu costs. This view is supported by <ref type="biblio">Gaiotti and Lippi (2005)</ref> showing for the Italian restaurant sector<lb/> that the rise in the average price of a restaurant meal was mainly due to a greater fraction of restaurants<lb/> revising their prices rather than to greater individual price revisions the price increases. The authors<lb/> interpret this as being consistent with the menu-cost hypothesis.<lb/> 11.<lb/> Another reason for rising prices around the changeover relates to the need to find new attractive<lb/> prices in euro. 2 After the conversion of prices into euro the prices obtained were often no longer attractive<lb/> requiring an adjustment of prices to the nearest attractive euro price. <ref type="biblio">Chlumsky and Engelhardt (2002)<lb/></ref> show for Germany that in May 2002 attractive deutschmark prices still dominated in more than half of all<lb/> product groups considered, whilst in October 2002 the majority of prices had been adjusted to attractive<lb/> euro prices. Although the rounding effect should theoretically be symmetric (with some of the attractive<lb/> prices being below and some above the exact euro price) there was a tendency by retailers to round prices<lb/> upwards rather than downwards. This is supported by <ref type="biblio">Folkertsma et al. (2002)</ref> demonstrating for the Dutch<lb/> retail sector that prices increased at above average rates in market segments where psychological pricing is<lb/> of greater importance. Quantifying the effect of this rounding behaviour on retail prices the authors find<lb/> that it accounts for about two-thirds of the observed euro-related price increases with the remainder<lb/> attributed to the passing on of menu costs.<lb/> 2.<lb/> Two sorts of attractive prices can be distinguished: convenient prices in which the last digit is equal to zero<lb/> so that they are convenient to pay and psychological prices in which the last digit is equal to eight or nine<lb/> so that consumers are inclined to undervalue the cost of the product.<lb/> ECO/WKP(2008)40<lb/> 12.<lb/> One frequently cited explanation for why producers were able to raise prices around the cash<lb/> changeover relates to the phenomenon of rational inattention. The central idea is that the euro changeover<lb/> temporarily raised the information processing costs on the side of consumers as they had to convert euro<lb/> prices back to the old currency in order to assess the price of a product. This increase in information<lb/> processing costs was not matched by an equally large cost increase on the side of vendors as they had to<lb/> perform the conversion only once rather than for each individual purchase and they knew the exact price<lb/> that had to be converted whereas consumers needed to remember the benchmark price in the old currency.<lb/> The high information processing costs might have induced consumers to pay less attention to price changes<lb/> as the costs of detecting them outweighed the benefits, thereby creating temporary market power for sellers<lb/> (<ref type="biblio">Sims, 2003 and Reis, 2004</ref>). 3 <ref type="biblio">Ehrmann (2006)</ref> provides an indirect test of the rational inattention<lb/> hypothesis, showing that the inflationary impact of the euro changeover tended to be higher in countries<lb/> with medium-complex conversion rates where consumers relied on (imprecise) rule-of-thumbs rather than<lb/> using pocket calculators to convert prices.<lb/> 13.<lb/> Displaying prices both in euro and in the old national currency reduces the information<lb/> processing costs on the side of consumers and with it the tendency of vendors to raise prices. This is<lb/> supported by <ref type="biblio">Folkertsma et al. (2002)</ref> showing for Dutch retailers that shops displaying prices in both<lb/> guilders and euro raised their prices by half as much as shops that failed to show both currencies. The<lb/> importance of dual pricing is confirmed by Ehrmann (2006) who shows that inflation around the cash<lb/> changeover turned out to be relatively lower in countries where dual pricing was mandatory. 4<lb/></p>

			<head>2.1.2<lb/> Identifying sectors with significant price increases<lb/></head>

			<p>14.<lb/> In this section, sectors with significant changeover-related price increases are identified for the<lb/> first-wave euro area countries in order to calculate an estimate for the likely effect in the Slovak Republic.<lb/> The empirical analysis makes use of disaggregated data on harmonised indices of consumer prices (HICP)<lb/> provided by Eurostat. The data are disaggregated at COICOP levels 2 and 3, covering respectively 39 and<lb/> 93 different categories of goods and services per country. 5 The results at COICOP level 2 will be used in<lb/> the assessment of the monetary impact of the cash changeover on Slovak consumers in Section 4.1 as<lb/> disaggregated data on consumption expenditures are only available at that level; the results at COICOP<lb/> level 3 will be used in the analysis of the role of product market competition in Section 2.1.3 as it provides<lb/> a more detailed picture of the changeover effects and allows making use of a larger data sample.<lb/> 15.<lb/> A number of corrections are made to the two data sets. First, sectors where prices are to a large<lb/> extent administered by governments or where government ownership is substantial are excluded from the<lb/> analysis so that only market determined prices are investigated. As such, the price indices of health,<lb/> transport services, postal services, electricity, gas and other fuels, and education are dropped from the<lb/> 3.<lb/> Note that consumers do not actually need to ignore price changes. All that is needed for prices to rise is that<lb/> sellers believe that consumers ignore price changes.<lb/></p>

			<table>4.<lb/> Dual pricing was only mandatory in Austria, Greece and Portugal. Empirical studies suggest that it was<lb/> also widely applied in most other countries, especially among hypermarkets and supermarkets (see, for<lb/> example, Banque de France, 2002 and Santos et al., 2002).<lb/> 5 .<lb/> COICOP (Classification of Individual Consumption by Purpose) is a classification by the United Nations<lb/> Statistics Division used to classify consumption expenditures.<lb/> ECO/WKP(2008)40<lb/> sample. 6 Second, whenever a tax change occurred around the changeover period, the price series of the<lb/> corresponding sector and country is excluded from the analysis. 7<lb/> 16.<lb/> In a first step sectors with a significant changeover induced price increase are identified by<lb/> estimating the following system of equations jointly for all countries that started the circulation of euro<lb/> banknotes and coins on 1 January 2002: 8<lb/> π ijt = α ij π ijt-1 + β ij π NEURjt + γ ij GAP it + δ ij D ij + 񮽙 ijt ,<lb/> (1)<lb/> 17.<lb/></table>

			<p>where π ijt is the change in the price index in country i and sector j between July year t-1 and July<lb/> year t, π NEURjt is the unweighted average of the respective variables in the United Kingdom, Sweden and<lb/> Denmark, GAP is the average output gap of year t-1 and t, and D is a dummy variable equal to unity for the<lb/> period July 2001 to July 2002. Focusing on July-July inflation rates allows capturing changes in the price<lb/> setting behaviour that had already taken place in the run-up to the changeover (i.e. before January 2002)<lb/> and changes in the price setting behaviour that did not immediately occur with the changeover<lb/> (e.g. because of voluntary agreements with retailers to keep prices stable around the changeover). The<lb/> average inflation rate of the United Kingdom, Sweden and Denmark is included in the regression to control<lb/> for other exceptional events that happened around the changeover and that might have triggered price<lb/> increases for certain goods and services such as the bad weather conditions of the winter season 2001/2002<lb/> and the spreading of the mad cow and the foot-and-mouth diseases somewhat earlier.<lb/> 18.<lb/> In a first step, the system of equations (1) is estimated over the period 07/1997 to 07/2007 with<lb/> generalised least squares (GLS) using price data disaggregated at COICOP level 2. 9 To obtain an estimate<lb/> of the average changeover effect by sector, the coefficients on the changeover dummy are restricted to be<lb/> equal across countries (so that δ ij = δ j for all i). The results suggest that changeover-related price increases<lb/> did indeed occur in a number of sectors (see <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>). Although the size of the changeover effect appears<lb/> to have been quite sizable for individual sectors, the implied impact on the aggregate HICP is relatively<lb/> small. Applying the weights of the different sectors in the aggregate HICP of the euro area suggests that<lb/> the changeover raised HICP inflation in the euro area by about 0.34 percentage points, which is in line with<lb/> previous studies (see <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>). 10 Employing the same coefficients and the weights of the different sectors<lb/> in the aggregate HICP of the Slovak Republic (as of 2008) shows that the price effect in the<lb/> Slovak Republic is likely to be of similar magnitude than in the first-wave euro area countries, with<lb/> aggregate prices estimated to rise by 0.32% due to the cash changeover.<lb/></p>

			<p>is a<lb/> dummy variable equal to unity for countries that had a legal requirement for dual display around the<lb/> changeover (Austria, Greece and Portugal), GAP is the output gap and Ψ is an indicator of the level of<lb/> competition. The size of the price level effect of the cash changeover is measured in two ways: first, by the<lb/> difference between the annual inflation rate in July 2002 and the annual inflation rate in July 2001 which is<lb/> the measure also used by <ref type="biblio">Ehrmann (2006)</ref>, 14 and second, by the size of the estimated changeover dummy<lb/> in equation (1). Whenever the first measure is used as the dependent variable, the equation also includes<lb/> the change in the output gap to control for business cycle effects. 15<lb/> 25.<lb/> The classification of conversion rates follows Ehrmann (2006) with the conversion rates of<lb/> Germany, Italy and Portugal classified as simple, those of Belgium, Luxembourg and Greece classified as<lb/> medium complex, and the conversion rates of the remaining countries classified as complex. 16 Three<lb/> alternative indicators of the level of competition are used: first, the OECD&apos;s summary indicator of product<lb/> market regulations (PMR), second, the OECD&apos;s indicator for product market regulations in the retail sector<lb/> (RETAIL), and third, the size of the average mark-up in non-manufacturing industries (MARKUP). 17 The<lb/> use of the indicator of regulatory impediments in retailing is motivated by the observation that most of the<lb/> euro changeover-related price increases occurred in the retailing business.<lb/> 26.<lb/> Equation</p>

			<p>(2) is estimated for all sectoral inflation rates and, following Ehrmann (2006), for<lb/> sectoral inflation rates that have increased by more than certain thresholds. Three subsamples are created.<lb/> The first one comprises only those inflation rates that have increased by more than twice the average<lb/> unweighted increase observed for Denmark, Sweden and the United Kingdom. The second one comprises<lb/> only sectors which showed inflationary developments in excess of twice the average inflation rate observed<lb/> over the period July 1996 to July 2001. Finally, the third subsample comprises only those sectors for which<lb/> the changeover dummy in the first-stage regression was significantly positive at the 10% significance<lb/> level. 18<lb/> 27.<lb/> The estimation results are reported in <ref type="table">Table 5</ref>. The coefficient on the competition indicator is<lb/> significantly positive in the majority of the specifications, supporting the hypothesis that a higher level of<lb/> product market competition is associated with a smaller changeover effect. The evidence is particularly<lb/> strong for specifications (5a) to (5c) which employ the size of the changeover dummy from the first-stage<lb/> regression as the dependent variable and thus directly control for the national historic pattern of inflation<lb/> and extraordinary events such as the cold winter and the spreading of the mad cow and the foot-and-mouth<lb/> diseases that affected prices also in the three EU countries that did not join the euro area.<lb/> 14.<lb/> The change in inflation is used rather than its level as the latter would require taking into account country-<lb/>fixed effects which is not possible as the explanatory variables only vary across countries.<lb/></p>

			<p>15.<lb/> This is not necessary for all specifications that employ the size of the changeover dummy of the first stage<lb/> regression as the dependent variable because the output gap was included in this regression.<lb/></p>

			<head>2.1.4<lb/> The divergence between perceived and actual inflation<lb/></head>

			<p>29.<lb/> A puzzling feature of the euro changeover in essentially all countries that introduced the euro in<lb/> January 2002 relates to the mismatch between actual and perceived inflation in the aftermath of the cash<lb/> changeover. Whilst price increases around the changeover were concentrated in a few sectors with only a<lb/> small impact on aggregate inflation (see Section 2.1.2) the public perceived the changeover as having led<lb/> to general price increases. This mismatch between actual and perceived inflation is illustrated in <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref>,<lb/> showing the gap between actual and perceived inflation over the period 1996 to 2007. 19 While perceived<lb/> inflation tracked actual inflation very well prior to the euro changeover with the perception gap close to<lb/> zero in all EU countries, the perception gap opened up in all euro area countries after the changeover. In<lb/> the three EU countries that did not join the euro area the gap remained close to zero suggesting that the<lb/> departure of perceived inflation from actual inflation was indeed related to the cash changeover.<lb/></p>

			<figure>Source: OECD calculations based on data from the Joint Harmonised EU Programme of Business and Consumer Surveys and from<lb/> the OECD Economic Outlook 83 database.<lb/> 30.<lb/> The sharp rise in perceived inflation around the cash changeover matches well with consumers&apos;<lb/> responses in the Eurobarometer surveys conducted on behalf of the European Commission. In the survey<lb/> carried out in November 2002 almost 90% of all respondents in the euro area said that the conversion of<lb/> prices into euro had been to their detriment; only 3% felt that the conversion had been in their favour (see<lb/> Figure 6).<lb/> act<lb/> t<lb/> resc<lb/> t<lb/> π<lb/> β<lb/> α<lb/> π<lb/> ˆ<lb/> ˆ +<lb/> =<lb/> 19.<lb/> Data on perceived inflation is obtained from the Joint Harmonised EU Programme of Business and<lb/> Consumer Surveys.

			<p>31.<lb/> A number of arguments have been put forward to explain the deviation of perceived inflation<lb/> from actual inflation in the aftermath of the cash changeover. <ref type="biblio">Brachinger (2005)</ref> claims that consumers&apos;<lb/> inflation perceptions are more influenced by price rises rather than by price declines as they weigh<lb/> purchasing power losses higher than purchasing power gains. 20 Moreover, consumers are likely to pay<lb/> more attention to frequently purchased items than to routine items such as rents and items that are less<lb/> frequently purchased (Del <ref type="biblio">Giovane and Sabbatini, 2005; Pollan, 2002; Fluch and Stix, 2005</ref>). Del <ref type="biblio">Giovane<lb/> and Sabbatini (2005)</ref> explore this argument empirically and show for Italy that the gap between the<lb/> inflation rates of frequently and less frequently purchased items can partly explain the divergence between<lb/> perceived and officially measured inflation. Less encouraging results are obtained by Döhring and<lb/> Mordonu (2007) who cannot find any evidence that an index of out-of-pocket expenditure explains<lb/> inflation perceptions better than the overall HICP index. 21<lb/> 32.<lb/> The interactions might have been amplified by consumers&apos; expectations of price increases around<lb/> the changeover as people tend to check data that confirm their expectations less accurately than data that<lb/> disprove them. Research by <ref type="biblio">Traut-Mattausch et al. (2004) and Kamleitner et al. (2004)</ref> point in this<lb/> direction showing in an experiment that individuals are biased towards perceiving price increases as a<lb/> result of previously held expectations even when the price increases are not confirmed by the data. In<lb/> addition, the extensive media coverage of the changeover with its emphasis on price increases might have<lb/> amplified consumers&apos; inflation perceptions in a number of countries.<lb/> 20.<lb/> The argument is based on the theory of loss aversion put forward by Kahneman and Tversky (1979).<lb/> 21.<lb/> These diverging results might be related to the fact that whilst in Italy the inflation differential between<lb/> frequently and less-frequently purchased items started to widen in the aftermath of the changeover, this<lb/> was not the case in most other euro area countries.<lb/> ECO/WKP(2008)40<lb/> 33.<lb/> If the perception gap also widens after the euro changeover in the Slovak Republic, this could be<lb/> problematic in two ways. First, the associated increase in inflation perceptions may contribute to a negative<lb/> attitude of citizens towards the euro which in turn may delay their adaption to the new currency. For the<lb/> twelve first-wave euro area countries there is indeed a positive correlation of 0.76 between the change in<lb/> inflation expectations in the aftermath of the changeover and the dissatisfaction of citizens with the<lb/> common currency (see <ref type="figure">Figure 7</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<p>34.<lb/> Second, to the extent that inflation expectations are adaptive, a rise in perceived inflation may<lb/> raise inflation expectations. If individuals set prices and wages with reference to the rate of inflation they<lb/> expect, this might push up actual inflation. As shown in <ref type="table">Table 5</ref>, perceived inflation and expected inflation<lb/> are indeed highly correlated in the Slovak Republic. 22 While this was also the case in the first-wave euro<lb/> area countries before the changeover, this relationship broke down at the beginning of 2002 with inflation<lb/> perceptions starting to rise and inflation expectations starting to fall (see <ref type="table">Table 6</ref> and <ref type="figure">Figure 8</ref>). This<lb/> suggests that consumers did not expect the price increases they perceived after the changeover to continue<lb/> in the foreseeable future. The changeover was thus perceived as having an impact on the price level rather<lb/> than inflation. If the same phenomenon occurs in the Slovak Republic and if it is indeed expected rather<lb/> than perceived inflation that is driving wage demands, a rise in perceived inflation, if it were to occur,<lb/> should not trigger any wage-price spiral and thus not pose a threat to overall price stability.<lb/> 22.<lb/> Data on inflation expectations are taken from the Joint Harmonised EU Programme of Business and<lb/> Consumer Surveys. The survey contains, among others, the question: &quot; By comparison with the past 12<lb/> months, how do you expect that consumer prices will develop in the next 12 months? &quot; The possible<lb/> answers are: &quot; they will increase more rapidly &quot; , &quot; increase at the same rate &quot; , &quot; increase at a slower rate &quot; ,<lb/> &quot; stay about the same &quot; , &quot; fall &quot; , and &quot; don&apos;t know &quot; .<lb/></p>

			<head>2.2<lb/> Structural aspects of euro adoption<lb/> 2.2.1<lb/> The exchange rate pass-through<lb/></head>

			<p>35.<lb/> With euro adoption, the conversion rate between the Slovak koruna and the euro will be<lb/> irrevocably fixed so that the effect of exchange rate changes vis-à-vis the euro on inflation will gradually<lb/> disappear. As the koruna was appreciating against the euro, this pass-through of exchange rate changes had<lb/> a damping impact on inflation in the past. With imports from the euro area accounting for over 40% of<lb/> total imports, this effect is likely to be large (see <ref type="figure">Figure 9</ref>). Exchange rates vis-à-vis countries outside the<lb/> euro area will continue to change after euro accession of Slovakia and those changes will continue to pass-<lb/>through to consumer prices. This concerns foremost other central and eastern European (CEE) countries<lb/> like Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic, which account for 30% of Slovak imports. As the currencies<lb/> of these countries tend to appreciate against the euro, imports from these countries will become more<lb/> expensive in euro, thereby exerting upward pressure on aggregate inflation in the Slovak Republic. 23<lb/> Hence, while the disinflationary impact from the appreciation of the koruna vis-à-vis the euro will vanish<lb/> with euro adoption, an inflationary impact from depreciation vis-à-vis the currencies of other</p>

			<table>CEE<lb/> economies will emerge.<lb/> 23.<lb/> Over the past, the Slovak koruna was appreciating against the Hungarian forint and the Polish zloty (with<lb/> the appreciation amounting to respectively 2.9% and 2.5% per year on average over the period 2000 to<lb/> 2007) and remained roughly stable against the Czech koruna, so that the exchange rate pass-through vis-à-<lb/>vis these countries had a dampening effect on Slovak inflation.<lb/> ECO/WKP(2008)40<lb/></table>

			<p>36.<lb/> The pass-through of exchange rate changes to consumer prices is operating with long lags<lb/> -typically it is assumed that a large share of the effect occurs within one year with the remainder occurring<lb/> in the second year. This means that, although after euro adoption there will be no further exchange rate<lb/> changes vis-à-vis the euro, past changes will still continue to influence inflation rates. Given the trend<lb/> appreciation of the koruna over recent months (the appreciation since January 2007 amounts to over 12%)<lb/> there will still be a damping effect on inflation for some time going forward. This effect will counter<lb/> somewhat the price-increasing euro changeover effects identified in Section 2.1.2.<lb/> 37.<lb/> To identify the likely damping effect on inflation estimates of the exchange rate pass-through to<lb/> consumer prices as provided by <ref type="biblio">Korhonen and Wachtel (2005)</ref>, Vyskrabka (2007) and Merrill Lynch<lb/> (2008) are used (see <ref type="table">Table 7</ref>			<figure>). 24 Korhonen and Wachtel (2005) estimate a vector autoregression (VAR)<lb/> model in first differences at monthly frequency over the sample period January 1999 to December 2004 to<lb/> analyse the impact of bilateral exchange rate changes on headline inflation. Applying a similar approach to<lb/> quarterly data over a somewhat longer time horizon Vyskrabka (2007) investigates the impact of both<lb/> bilateral and effective exchange rate changes on core inflation. Merrill Lynch (2008) estimate a monthly<lb/> VAR in first differences over the sample period January 2001 to December 2007 for both bilateral and<lb/> nominal effective exchange rates. In the calculations, only estimates of changes in the bilateral koruna/euro<lb/> exchange rate (as opposed to the nominal effective exchange rate) are used. 25 When only a short-and a<lb/> long-run effect were given in the studies, linear interpolation was used to calculate the effect over time. 26<lb/> 24.<lb/> These studies were selected on the grounds that they also identify the speed of pass-through. Doliak and<lb/> Karmazin (2007) find a total pass-through effect of similar extent (0.13-0.2), which is broadly in line with<lb/> internal European Commission estimates, as reported in European Commission (2008).<lb/> 25.<lb/> As Merrill Lynch (2008) provide an estimate of the speed of the pass-through only for changes in the<lb/> effective nominal exchange rate, it is assumed that the speed of the pass-through for bilateral exchange rate<lb/> changes is equal to their estimate for effective exchange rate changes.<lb/> 26.<lb/> There are some indications that the extent of pass-through is time-varying. For example, in the Slovak case<lb/> the arrival of large retail chains between 2003 and 2006 is reported to have raised pass-through rates<lb/> ECO/WKP(2008)40<lb/> The sample starts in July 2006; thus, the data point for June 2008, for example, is the impact that exchange<lb/> rate changes between July 2006 and May 2008 have on inflation in that particular month.<lb/></figure>

			<p>(<ref type="biblio">Doliak and Karmazin, 2007</ref>).

			<figure>ECO/WKP(2008)40<lb/> 38.<lb/> Using this approach, Figure 10 shows the impact of past changes in the SKK/EUR exchange rate<lb/> (July 2006–May 2008) on Slovak consumer prices. As can be seen, the past appreciation of the koruna is<lb/> likely to exert a damping effect on consumer prices until at least the middle of 2009. The size of the<lb/> cumulative impact is estimated at around -1½ per cent for the period June 2008 to June 2009 (i.e. inflation<lb/> is likely to be reduced by 1½ per cent over this period); for the period June 2009 to June 2010 the effect is<lb/> negligible. 27<lb/> 39.<lb/> Although from January 2009 onwards the Slovak Republic will face the same nominal exchange<lb/> rate changes as the other euro area countries, it is likely that the resulting impact on consumer price<lb/> inflation will be different. First, imports from outside the euro area represent a larger share of total imports<lb/> in the Slovak Republic than in most other euro area countries (see <ref type="figure">Figure 11</ref>), implying that any given<lb/> exchange rate change will affect a larger share of the goods and services in the Slovak Republic. Second,<lb/> the country composition of extra-euro area imports in the Slovak Republic differs notably from those in<lb/> other euro area countries (see <ref type="figure">Figure 12</ref>). In particular, the Czech Republic, the Russian Federation, Poland<lb/> and Hungary are more important sources of imports for the Slovak Republic than for the other euro area<lb/> countries, implying that exchange rate changes vis-à-vis the currencies of those countries will have a larger<lb/> impact on Slovak consumer prices.<lb/></p>

			<head>2.2.2<lb/> The Balassa-Samuelson effect<lb/></head>

			<p>40.<lb/> Over the past decade, the real exchange rate of the Slovak koruna appreciated considerably both<lb/> vis-à-vis the euro and in effective terms (see <ref type="figure">Figure 13</ref>). This real appreciation occurred through a<lb/> combination of nominal exchange rate appreciation and higher inflation rates than in the trading partner<lb/> countries. The adoption of the euro in 2009 will rule out any further nominal appreciation against the euro<lb/> and therefore any underlying real appreciation will ultimately be reflected in an inflation rate that exceeds<lb/> the average inflation rate in the euro area. As such, euro adoption will also have consequences for the<lb/> longer-run evolution of inflation in the Slovak Republic. Against this background, this section briefly<lb/> discusses potential explanations for the observed real appreciation of the koruna and reviews the associated<lb/> empirical evidence. The existing literature suggests that the observed real appreciation was at least partly<lb/> backed by the development of economic fundamentals such as productivity and is likely to continue for<lb/> some time going forward, although to a lesser extent than in the past.<lb/></p>

			<p>41.<lb/> The most widely used explanation for the real appreciation of the Slovak koruna is the Balassa-<lb/>Samuelson (BS) hypothesis. The hypothesis was put forward by Balassa (1964) and Samuelson (1964) to<lb/> explain differences in inflation rates and price levels between catching-up economies and advanced<lb/> economies. The price level effect rests upon the idea that catching-up economies such as the<lb/> Slovak Republic are characterised by productivity levels in the open and sheltered sectors that are lower<lb/> than those in the advanced economies (see <ref type="figure">Figure 14</ref>). If tradable prices are given by purchasing power<lb/> parity (PPP), low productivity levels in the open sectors imply low wages in these sectors. If labour is fully<lb/> mobile or wage setting is solidaristic and wages equalise across sectors, wages and prices should be low<lb/> also in the sheltered sectors. As the nominal exchange rate is determined by purchasing power parity in the<lb/> open sectors, non-tradable goods and services should cost less in the Slovak Republic than in the euro area,<lb/> implying a lower overall price level. Whilst the absolute price level of non-tradable goods in the<lb/> Slovak Republic is indeed well below the euro area average, thereby supporting the Balassa-Samuelson<lb/> hypothesis, the price level of many goods that are generally perceived as tradable is also markedly lower,<lb/> suggesting that purchasing power parity does not hold for the open sectors (see <ref type="figure">Figure 15</ref>). This<lb/> observation makes it clear already that the Balassa-Samuelson hypothesis cannot fully account for the<lb/> lower price level in the Slovak Republic relative to the euro area and that other factors must be at work as<lb/> well.<lb/></p>

			<p>In its dynamic form, the hypothesis postulates that productivity will improve faster in the open<lb/> sectors than in the sheltered sectors. Rising wages in the open sectors (in line with productivity<lb/> developments) will spill over to the sheltered sectors, thereby pushing up the prices of non-tradable goods.<lb/> Thus, if the productivity differential between the open and the sheltered sectors in the Slovak Republic<lb/> exceeds that of the euro area, the overall price level should rise faster in the Slovak Republic than in the<lb/> euro area. <ref type="figure">Figure 16</ref> shows that productivity growth differentials have indeed been larger for the<lb/> Slovak Republic than for the euro area, suggesting that this prerequisite for the Balassa-Samuelson effect is<lb/> fulfilled.<lb/></p>

			<p>43.<lb/> A large number of empirical studies have tried to estimate the size of the Balassa-Samuelson<lb/> effect in the Slovak Republic (see <ref type="table">Table 8</ref>). These studies generally conclude that the effect is relatively<lb/> small, having contributed not more than 1.5 percentage point per year to the real appreciation of the Slovak<lb/> koruna (which amounted to around 7% per annum vis-à-vis the euro when measured based on the HICP). 28<lb/> At first, this seems surprising given the strong productivity growth in the open sectors, particularly in<lb/> automobile manufacturing and electronics, where large inflows of foreign direct investment contributed to<lb/> a marked increase in productivity growth in recent years.<lb/> 44.<lb/> The transmission of this primary impulse seems to have been damped by a number of factors<lb/> (<ref type="biblio">Vladová, 2007; Égert and Podpiera, 2008</ref>). First, wage growth in the open sectors did not reach the growth<lb/> rate of labour productivity; particularly in recent years (see <ref type="figure">Figure 17</ref>). Second, the wage equalization<lb/> mechanism was imperfect with wages in the sheltered sectors growing at slightly lower rates than those in<lb/> the open sectors (see <ref type="figure">Figure 18</ref>). Third, labour productivity growth in the sheltered sectors compensated for<lb/> a certain part of the wage growth so that producers were not forced to pass on the entire wage growth to<lb/> prices (see <ref type="figure">Figure 19</ref>). With productivity growth in the sheltered sectors well below the levels seen in<lb/> Western European countries, promoting competition in the sheltered sectors by reducing administrative<lb/> barriers and enhancing the general business environment could boost productivity growth in these sectors,<lb/></p>

			<table>28.<lb/> A few studies even find a negative BS effect (e.g. Égert, 2002a; Wagner and Hlouskova, 2004) or no<lb/> significant effect at all (e.g. Égert, 2007).<lb/> ECO/WKP(2008)40<lb/> thereby further moderating the Balassa-Samuelson effect. Finally, although the share of market services<lb/> (only those non-tradables for which prices are market-determined and not administered should ultimately<lb/> matter for the Balassa-Samuelson effect) has risen markedly</table>

			<p>in the Slovak Republic, it still accounts for<lb/> only one quarter of the HICP (see <ref type="figure">Figure 20</ref>). So even if a given productivity differential between the open<lb/> and sheltered sectors would translate one-to-one into higher prices of non-tradable goods and services, the<lb/> overall HICP would still rise by only one quarter of the productivity differential.<lb/></p>

			<p>45.<lb/> At less than 1.5% per year, the Balassa-Samuelson effect is clearly too small to explain the entire<lb/> observed real appreciation of the Slovak koruna which (based on the HICP) amounted to almost 7% per<lb/> year over the period 2000 to 2007. A number of alternative explanations have been proposed in the<lb/> literature to explain the share of the real appreciation that cannot be accounted for by the Balassa-<lb/>Samuelson effect. One widely used explanation is the rising share of non-tradable goods and services in<lb/> private consumption that comes with rising incomes in catching-up economies. 29 This rising share of non-<lb/>tradable goods and services affects aggregate consumer prices in two ways. First, assuming that non-<lb/>tradables have a higher inflation rate than tradables (such as because of the Balassa-Samuelson effect), by<lb/> increasing the weight of non-tradables within the HICP, aggregate inflation will rise through a simple<lb/> accounting effect. Second, the higher demand for non-tradable goods will push up the prices of these<lb/> goods, thereby raising the aggregate price level. 30 This second channel can only affect inflation as long as<lb/> the share of non-tradables is still rising. As shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 20</ref>, the share has remained fairly constant<lb/> since 2005, so that in recent years, this second channel should have played only a minor role in influencing<lb/> inflation in the Slovak Republic.<lb/> 46.<lb/> A closely related argument is the rising GDP share of government consumption observed in most<lb/> catching-up economies. As government expenditures are biased towards non-tradable goods and services, a<lb/> rising GDP share of government consumption is likely to lead to a rise in the relative price of non-tradable<lb/> goods, thereby causing an appreciation of the real exchange rate. 31 However, in the Slovak Republic, the<lb/> GDP share of government consumption has actually declined over the past (from around 21% in the mid-<lb/>1990s to around 17% in 2007), exerting a depreciating effect on the real exchange rate and thereby<lb/> 29.<lb/> The idea is an extension of Engle&apos;s law, stating that with a given set of tastes and preferences, as income<lb/> rises, the proportion of income spent on food falls, even if actual expenditure on food rises.<lb/> 30.<lb/> Theoretically, such a shift in preferences towards non-tradable goods and services should only lead to a<lb/> shift in relative prices. However, with the prices of tradables determined on the world market (small<lb/> country assumption) the price level will be affected as well.<lb/></p>

			<figure>31.<lb/> Oomes (2005) confirms this positive relationship between the GDP share of government consumption and<lb/> the real exchange rate for the Slovak Republic, while Frait et al. (2006) cannot detect any significant<lb/> relationship.<lb/> ECO/WKP(2008)40<lb/> counteracting the appreciating effect of the Balassa-Samuelson effect and the rising share of non-tradables<lb/> in private consumption. 32<lb/></figure>

			<p>47.<lb/> As the Balassa-Samuelson effect and the rising share of non-tradables in the private consumption<lb/> basket lead to an appreciation of the real exchange rate via a rise in the prices of non-tradable goods and<lb/> services they can only explain an appreciation of the HICP-based real exchange rate (which reflects the<lb/> prices of both tradable and non-tradable goods and services). The real exchange rate based on producer<lb/> prices (which should mainly reflect the prices of tradable goods and services) should remain constant as<lb/> purchasing power parity is assumed to hold for tradables. This is not reconcilable with the empirical<lb/> evidence as the real exchange rate has also appreciated when based on the producer price index, although<lb/> to a lesser extent than the HICP-based real exchange (see <ref type="figure">Figure 21</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<p>ECO/WKP(2008)40<lb/> 49.<lb/> Pricing-to-market practices offer another explanation for lower price levels and higher inflation<lb/> rates in catching-up economies. Producers might set prices deliberately lower in catching-up economies<lb/> because of the lower disposable income of households in these countries. As disposable income rises,<lb/> prices are adjusted upwards, leading to inflation rates in excess of those in advanced economies. <ref type="biblio">Égert<lb/> (2007)</ref> provides some evidence of such behaviour in the Slovak Republic, showing that the prices of small<lb/> cars are around 10% lower than the euro area average.<lb/> 50.<lb/> A final explanation to be mentioned relates to regulated prices which make up a significant share<lb/> of the overall HICP. As regulated prices have been adjusted upwards in the past in order to achieve cost-<lb/>recovering levels, they can partly explain the observed real appreciation of the koruna real exchange rate.<lb/></p>

			<figure>51.<lb/> Going forward, the factors driving the real appreciation of the Slovak koruna are likely to<lb/> moderate as the country&apos;s GDP per capita level catches up with the levels of western European countries.<lb/> As regards the Balassa-Samuelson effect, Oomes (2005) expects an inflationary impact of 3% per year on<lb/> average until 2010 compared with a projection of 1.5% per year by the National Bank of Slovakia<lb/> (2006). 33 A further rise in the share of non-traded goods and services in private consumption might<lb/> reinforce this effect, although any rise in the share is likely to be small as it is already very close to the euro<lb/> area average. 34 Continued integration of Slovak manufacturing production into the global economy should<lb/> lead to a closing of the quality gap with advanced economies and a saturation of the quality bias effect,<lb/> albeit at a slow pace. The appreciating influences are likely to be dampened by continued fiscal<lb/> consolidation in line with the Stability and Growth Pact, which will further reduce the GDP share of<lb/> government consumption.<lb/></figure>

			<head>3.<lb/> The impact of euro adoption on interest rates<lb/></head>

			<p>52.<lb/> The effect of euro adoption on interest rates runs via financial integration of capital markets and<lb/> is multi-faceted. First, policy controlled interest rates converge to the euro area level immediately once<lb/> monetary authority is transferred to the ECB in January 2009. Second, the premium for exchange rate risk<lb/> imbedded in market interest rates relative to euro-denominated bonds will vanish which will reduce the<lb/> spread of bonds vis-à-vis the euro area. Also, market interest rates will be increasingly influenced by<lb/> factors common to the euro area rather than specific factors relating to the Slovak Republic. Third, Slovak<lb/> retail banking markets will become more integrated with the euro area markets as the lack of exchange rate<lb/> risk as well as lower transaction costs are likely to enhance cross-border financing activities. Hence, over<lb/> the longer term, Slovak retail interest rates for loans (to both households and non-financial companies)<lb/> may converge towards the lower euro area level and interest rates for deposits may rise towards the higher<lb/> euro area level. Of these three effects, the convergence of retail interest rates is likely to have the largest<lb/> impact on the population going forward.<lb/> 53.<lb/> Financial integration is defined as a situation where there are no frictions that discriminate<lb/> between economic agents in their access to capital, particularly on the basis of their location. In practice<lb/> this means that the same financial products, such as bonds, loans or deposits should have the same price<lb/> across countries. While financial integration has already started in the CEE countries, not least with EU<lb/> accession, the experience from existing euro area member countries shows that euro adoption enhances and<lb/></p>

			<figure>33.<lb/> These estimates are based on historical estimates of the Balassa-Samuelson effect. To the extent that wage<lb/> growth in the open sector will catch up with productivity growth, this might increase the size of the<lb/> Balassa-Samuelson effect.<lb/> 34.<lb/> The dispersion of the share of non-tradables in private consumption across euro area countries is very<lb/> small. The share is the highest in Austria (36%) followed by Spain, Ireland and Italy (32%).<lb/> ECO/WKP(2008)40<lb/> accelerates integration (ECB<ref type="biblio">, 2003; Baltzer et al., 2008</ref>). 35 This is due to the removal of important<lb/> obstacles, such as exchange rate risk, to the cross-border provision of financial services. As financial<lb/> markets become better integrated, economies of scale can be realised and the supply of funds for<lb/> investment opportunities is increased as banks and non-financial companies can tap the large and more<lb/> liquid euro capital markets. Greater integration raises price transparency and lowers transaction costs,<lb/> which should foster more cross-border activities, increase competition in the national markets and result in<lb/> a more efficient allocation of capital as well as a reduction in the cost of capital.<lb/> 54.<lb/> At the same time, financial integration in the euro area is still far from perfect. While wholesale<lb/> markets (such as the interbank money markets and government bond markets) are already fairly integrated,<lb/> retail markets remain more fragmented (ECB, 2008). For the Slovak Republic, it can thus be expected that<lb/> wholesale markets will continue to integrate fairly quickly with the adoption of the euro -in fact, a lot of<lb/> the adjustment has already happened. Even though integration in the case of retail banking markets in the<lb/> euro area is far from perfect, it is here where the Slovak Republic&apos;s markets still have the most catch-up to<lb/> do with most of the adjustment potential probably existing in the business with households (with banking<lb/> activities with non-financial companies already much closer to euro area integration levels).<lb/></p>

			<head>3.1<lb/> Changeover effects on money markets and government bond markets<lb/> 3.1.1. Equalization of short-term interest rates<lb/></head>

			<p>55.<lb/> With the adoption of the euro, the Slovak Republic will give up its autonomous monetary policy<lb/> and short-term interest rates will equal those in the euro area and will mainly depend on interest rate<lb/> decisions made by the European Central Bank. The change in short-term interest rates at the time of<lb/> joining will be relatively small, as i) monetary policy was constrained also before while the koruna had<lb/> been in ERM II; and ii) expectations of euro adoption have already diminished the short-term interest rate<lb/> differential. Indeed, as can be seen from <ref type="figure">Figure 22</ref> one-month money market rates have converged to the<lb/> euro area level by now.<lb/></p>

			<head>3.1.2<lb/> Exchange rate risk in long-term interest rates will disappear<lb/></head>

			<p>56.<lb/> Euro adoption also implies that the Slovak koruna will cease to exist as a currency so that the<lb/> exchange rate risk premium embedded in longer-term interest rates, which previously compensated euro-<lb/>based investors in Slovak financial assets for the risk of exchange rate changes vis-à-vis the euro, will<lb/> vanish. As the adoption of the euro in the Slovak Republic had long been expected, a large part of this<lb/> adjustment has already been factored into the prices of Slovak bonds. One measure for the size of the<lb/> exchange rate risk premium that the market is pricing for a given country is the difference in swap rates<lb/> between the country and a benchmark country. 36 This measure has converged to zero in all euro area<lb/> countries in the period prior to joining, as can be seen in the case of Italy from 1999 onwards and in<lb/> Greece, which became a member of the euro area in January 2001 (<ref type="figure">Figure 23</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<p>57.<lb/> For Slovakia, the swap differential to the euro area has also already fallen to almost zero<lb/> (<ref type="figure">Figure 23</ref>, left panel), meaning that government bond yields are unlikely to include any significant<lb/> exchange rate risk premium at this stage. Indeed, the current differential between Slovak and German<lb/> government bond yields is already comparable to other euro area countries, such as Italy and Greece<lb/> (<ref type="figure">Figure 23</ref>, right panel). The resulting spread, which reflects liquidity and default risk premia, will continue<lb/> to exist once Slovakia becomes a member of the euro area and its size is likely to depend on the<lb/> development of public finances as well as liquidity conditions going forward. As can be seen in <ref type="figure">Figure 24</ref>,<lb/> 36.<lb/> The swap rate is usually defined as the interest rate of the fixed leg of a fixed-for-floating interest rate swap<lb/> with ten year maturity. Swap contracts are private agreements between financial institutions (typically<lb/> investment banks) to exchange a flow of interest payments at a fixed rate for one at a floating rate, usually<lb/> the six-month LIBOR. An interest rate swap does not involve any principal to be potentially lost by any of<lb/> the two counterparts in case of default of the other. The counterpart risk for swap rates denominated in<lb/> different currencies should be the same, since the investment banks who deal in swaps operate in all major<lb/> markets. Also, swap rates do not contain a liquidity premium as there is no fixed amount of swaps<lb/> outstanding (i.e. they are created upon demand). As a consequence, differentials between fixed interest<lb/> rates on swaps should solely reflect exchange rate risk and therefore those differentials among euro area<lb/> countries converged towards zero as the probability of monetary union increased up to 1999 (<ref type="biblio">Codogno<lb/> et al. 2003</ref>).<lb/> ECO/WKP(2008)40<lb/> the level of interest rate differentials in the euro area tends to be positively related to the level of public<lb/> debt (although the relation is not very strong) and overall credit worthiness (as reflected in sovereign<lb/> ratings), respectively. 37<lb/> Figure 24.<lb/> Interest rate differentials and debt levels / Moody&apos;s sovereign ratings<lb/> 0.0<lb/> 0.1<lb/> 0.2<lb/> 0.3<lb/> 0.4<lb/> 0.5<lb/> 0.6<lb/> Govt. bond spread vs. Germany,<lb/> percentage points<lb/> Moody&apos; s sovereign rating<lb/> Aaa<lb/> Aa<lb/> A<lb/> BEL<lb/> NLD<lb/> AUT FRA<lb/> SVK<lb/> IRL<lb/> PRT<lb/> GRC<lb/> ITA<lb/> ESP<lb/> FIN<lb/> 0.0<lb/> 0.1<lb/> 0.2<lb/> 0.3<lb/> 0.4<lb/> 0.5<lb/> 0.6<lb/> 0<lb/> 50<lb/> 100<lb/> 150<lb/> Govt. bond spread vs. Germany,<lb/> percentage points<lb/> Maastricht Debt/GDP, %<lb/> SVK<lb/> IRL<lb/> PRT<lb/> GRC<lb/> ITA<lb/> BEL<lb/> ESP<lb/> FIN<lb/> NLD<lb/> AUT<lb/> FRA<lb/> Notes: Maastricht Debt levels are from 2006 and Moody&apos;s ratings are from 2008; both are compared with the average interest rate<lb/> differentials (10-year government bonds) for 2008q1.

			<p>58.<lb/> The current yield spread of Slovak government bonds vis-à-vis Germany is roughly 50 basis<lb/> points, equal to the upper bound of the current distribution among euro area countries. While the current<lb/> Maastricht debt level for the Slovak Republic of around 30% of GDP is below that of most other euro area<lb/> countries (which would argue for a lower spread), the Moody&apos;s sovereign rating of A1 is worse. Recent<lb/> research suggests that credit ratings are the primary driver of bond spreads in the euro area (<ref type="biblio">Manganelli<lb/> and Wolswijk, 2007</ref>), probably reflecting the more forward-looking nature of this variable in contrast to<lb/> the backward-looking debt levels. Taking the rating as an indication suggests that the current yield<lb/> differential of Slovak government bonds relative to the euro area is already close to the level that will<lb/> prevail once the Slovak Republic has joined the euro area (similar to the Greek spread, as Greece is also<lb/> rated as A1 by Moody&apos;s).<lb/></p>

			<head>3.1.2<lb/> Increasing influence of common factors on yield changes<lb/></head>

			<p>59.<lb/> While the level of the interest rate differential will thus still depend to some extent on local<lb/> factors, such as public creditworthiness, the experience of existing euro area countries suggests that, with<lb/> increased integration, interest rate changes are increasingly driven by factors common to the euro area.<lb/> With euro adoption and thus closer integration, this phenomenon is also to be expected for the Slovak bond<lb/> market.<lb/> 37.<lb/> See <ref type="biblio">Codogno et al. (2003)</ref> for a discussion of default risk and yield spreads. While they a significant<lb/> influence of debt-to-GDP ratios vis-à-vis Germany on the spread in some countries, they suggest that<lb/> international risk factors are the more important drivers.<lb/> ECO/WKP(2008)40<lb/> 60.<lb/> The extent of co-movement is usually estimated by regressing individual country&apos;s yield changes<lb/> against changes in the yield of the benchmark bond (which is the German government bond) (<ref type="biblio">Baltzer et al.,<lb/> 2008</ref>):<lb/></p>

As can be seen, the beta coefficient for euro area<lb/> members is fluctuating around one since the introduction of the common currency in 1999. The coefficient<lb/> for the Slovak Republic is still below one but given historical experience it should converge towards one<lb/> fairly quickly after 2009.<lb/></p>

			<head>3.2<lb/> Effects of financial integration on retail interest rates<lb/></head>

			<p>62.<lb/> While the integration of money markets and government bond markets determines the underlying<lb/> interest rate level for the economy, prices in the retail markets signal what consumers and enterprises<lb/> actually have to pay for taking up a loan or the interest they receive on deposits. Even though the overall<lb/> interest rate level, as seen above, has converged fairly closely to euro area levels, there still remains a large<lb/> gap between the interest rates on loans and deposits for Slovak citizens and non-financial companies as<lb/> compared with euro area residents. Euro adoption, by effectively leading to a more liquid and transparent<lb/> capital market, will increase competition. This will lead to a reduction in the difference between market<lb/> interest rates and deposit rates on the one hand and between market interest rates and lending rates on the<lb/> other hand, thereby reducing banks&apos; interest margins. 38 Cross-border activity of banks</p>

			<table>plays an important<lb/> 38 .<lb/> The high concentration among commercial banks in the Slovak Republic has led to a rather low level of<lb/> competition (which, however, has increased over the last years) (IMF, 2007). Van Leuvensteijn et al.<lb/> ECO/WKP(2008)40<lb/> role in this process. 39 Even though cross-border competition between banks in the existing euro area<lb/> member countries is far from perfect, their experience suggests that over time Slovak retail interest rates<lb/> should converge towards the euro area level.<lb/></table>

			<p>63.<lb/> Integration is still an ongoing process and retail banking interest rates at the euro area level are in<lb/> a continuous process of becoming more integrated, also reflecting the efforts of the Eurosystem and the EU<lb/> to promote financial integration (<ref type="biblio">European Commission, 2005; and ECB, 2008</ref>). As integration tends to<lb/> lead to convergence towards the lower end of the distribution, this process will lead to a lower euro area<lb/> average. Therefore, the assumption that Slovak interest rates converge towards the current euro area<lb/> average level is likely to be a conservative estimate and the extent of convergence might well turn out to be<lb/> larger.<lb/> 64.<lb/> In order to analyze the extent of integration as well as to proxy the likely changes following euro<lb/> adoption, we use the monthly harmonised MFI interest rate statistics on loans and deposits for households<lb/> and non-financial companies as published by the ECB and the National Bank of Slovakia. They break<lb/> down different loan and deposit categories by type and period of initial interest rate fixation or maturity. 40<lb/> The statistics are available for both new business and for outstanding amounts; in order to better gauge<lb/> changes in the offer price of banks, we concentrate on the rates for new business in the following. These<lb/> statistics are available from 2003 onwards for the euro area and from 2004 onwards for the<lb/> Slovak Republic. 41<lb/></p>

			<head>3.2.1<lb/> Notable differences between Slovak and euro area retail interest rates<lb/></head>

			<p>65.<lb/> Turning first to households, interest rates for all loan categories are higher than in the euro area,<lb/> notably for consumption loans (<ref type="table">Table 9</ref>). 42 For the latter, Slovak households have to pay 2¼ and<lb/> 8¾ percentage points (depending on the initial interest rate fixation of the loan) more for a new loan than<lb/> the average euro area household. The differences are smaller for housing loans, where the spread to euro<lb/> area rates is between ¾ (for an initial interest rate fixation period of up to 1 year) and 3¾ percentage points<lb/> (for an initial interest rate fixation period of 5 to 10 years). For the category of household loans for other<lb/> purposes, differences from the euro area amount to up to 1.3 percentage points.<lb/> 66.<lb/> In contrast to household loans, loan conditions for Slovak non-financial companies in general are<lb/> closer to those prevailing in euro area countries. This holds in particular for loan amounts of over<lb/> € 1 million where Slovak companies are even paying somewhat less for loans with an initial interest rate<lb/> fixation of over five years than their counterparts in euro area countries. For loans up to 1 million,<lb/> differences are between 10 and 130 basis points. This suggests that competition for company loans is<lb/> already more developed than for household loans.<lb/></p>

			<p>(2008) find evidence that spreads between bank and market interest rates are smaller in countries with<lb/> stronger competition.<lb/> 39 .<lb/> One example would be Slovenia, where interest rates on loans to households even fell below the euro area<lb/> average recently. Allegedly, this is due to foreign commercial banks entering the market and trying to gain<lb/> market share by undercutting local retail interest rate conditions.<lb/> 40 .<lb/> The initial period of interest rate fixation is a predetermined period of time at the start of a loan contract<lb/> during which the value of the interest rate cannot change (ECB, Manual on MFI interest rate statistics,<lb/> October 2003).<lb/> 41 .<lb/> For the Slovak Republic, we use interest rates for loans and deposits in koruna rather than euros as the<lb/> latter represent only a very small share of the total volume (2½ % of total household loan volume).<lb/> 42 .<lb/> The following and <ref type="table">Table 9</ref>			<figure>refer to averages for the first quarter 2008.<lb/> ECO/WKP(2008)40<lb/></figure>

			<head>3.2.2<lb/> Extent and speed of convergence<lb/></head>

			<p>68.<lb/> Even though there is still significant dispersion of retail interest rates within the euro area<lb/> analyses from the ECB suggest that they tend to converge over time. As can be seen from <ref type="table">Table 9</ref> (last<lb/> column), the standard deviation of interest rates across euro area countries differs by loan category and<lb/> ranges between ¼ and 1¼ percentage points. Even assuming that Slovak interest rates only decline towards<lb/> the upper bound of the euro area interest rate distribution leaves ample scope for convergence, at least for<lb/> household loans. The adjustment process, however, is likely to take some time as it will work through<lb/></p>

			<p>69.<lb/> It should be noted that differences in bank interest rates across countries can also reflect<lb/> differences in institutional factors (such as taxation, supervision and consumer protection) and financial<lb/> structures. This may explain why integration in the euro area is far from complete. It might also influence<lb/> the extent to which Slovak interest rates converge to the euro area level.<lb/> 70.<lb/> So far, empirical analysis suggests that convergence of Slovak interest rates is already underway.<lb/> One way to demonstrate this is to estimate the following equation, which relates the change in the interest<lb/> rate spread vis-à-vis the euro area average for every loan/deposit category i (<lb/></p>

			<p>71.<lb/> A negative value for i<lb/> β is indicative of convergence as loan or deposit categories with a higher<lb/> spread have a tendency to converge to the benchmark euro area average more rapidly than those categories<lb/> with a lower spread. A higher absolute value for i<lb/> β is indicative of a higher speed of convergence (with a<lb/> coefficient close to -1 signalling a complete convergence process).</p>

			<table>Table 10 shows the estimated i<lb/> β<lb/> coefficients for different Slovak retail interest rate categories, estimated over the time period January 2004<lb/> to March 2008. As can be seen, all coefficients are negative, i.e. all categories are converging towards the<lb/> euro area level. The speed of convergence (higher absolute β -values) tends to be highest for loans to non-<lb/>financial corporations, suggesting that competition for this category is most intense. Convergence is also<lb/> high for deposits of both households and non-financial companies. For household loans, the size of the β -<lb/>coefficient is generally smaller, although for those categories with substantial interest rate differentials to<lb/> ECO/WKP(2008)40<lb/> the euro area average, there is evidence of faster convergence (consumption and housing loans with longer<lb/> interest rate fixation periods).<lb/> Table 10.

			<head>4.<lb/> Implications of the changeover for the general public<lb/> 4.1<lb/> Impact of euro related price increases on different groups of Slovak consumers<lb/></head>

			<p>72.<lb/> As discussed in Section 2 the cash changeover in the Slovak Republic will most likely be<lb/> associated with price increases for a number of goods and services but only a modest increase in the<lb/> aggregate consumer price index. In this section the implied financial impact on Slovak consumers is<lb/> estimated making use of a disaggregated data set on consumption expenditures provided by Eurostat.<lb/> Specifically, the data are disaggregated at the COICOP 2 level and by income, household type, age of the<lb/> reference person, employment status of the reference person, and degree of urbanisation.<lb/> 73.<lb/> To gauge the implied impact on different groups of Slovak consumers, the coefficients on the<lb/> changeover dummies obtained in Section 2.1.2 at the COICOP 2 level (<ref type="table">Table 2</ref>) are multiplied by the<lb/> ECO/WKP(2008)40<lb/> weights of the respective sectors in the consumption baskets of different groups of consumers. As the latest<lb/> year for which disaggregated data on consumption expenditures are available is 2005, the calculations are<lb/> based on the presumption that the composition of the consumption basket after the cash changeover will be<lb/> the same as in 2005. This assumption is of course somewhat problematic, especially since cash changeover<lb/> induced relative price changes might lead to substitution effects whereby consumers substitute goods and<lb/> services with relative price increases by goods and services with relative price declines. As such, the<lb/> financial impact on consumers presented here is likely to be an upper bound of the financial impact on<lb/> consumers.<lb/></p>

Whilst the weights used in section 3.1.2 correspond to the weights used by Eurostat in<lb/> the calculation of the HICP, the weights used here correspond to the share of a certain category of goods<lb/> and services in total consumption expenditures.

For citizens in the<lb/> highest income quintile consumption expenditures are estimated to increase by almost 0.26% compared<lb/> with an increase of only 0.15% for persons in the lowest income quintile, mainly reflecting the higher share<lb/> of recreational goods and services, vehicle purchases and catering services in the consumption basket of<lb/> the highest income quintile. Expressed in monetary units, this implies additional expenditures of SKK 981<lb/> per year for households in the highest income quintile compared with SKK 241 for those in the lowest<lb/> income quintile.<lb/> 75.<lb/> Comparing the changeover effect across different household types suggests that households with<lb/> dependent children will be more severely hit by the changeover induced price increases than households<lb/> without children as expenditures for catering services, recreational activities and vehicle purchases tend to<lb/> be larger when dependent children are present. 45 For example, the additional annual costs per equivalent<lb/> adult are estimated at SKK 232 for a couple without dependent children compared with SKK 341 for a<lb/> couple with children.<lb/> 76.<lb/> Households with a reference person aged 60 and over should be less severely hit by the<lb/> changeover induced price increases than households with a younger reference person. Recreational goods<lb/> and services, vehicle purchases and catering services represent only 0.06% of their consumption<lb/> expenditures compared with around 0.14% for households with a reference person aged 45 and below. The<lb/> implied financial impact of the cash changeover amounts to SKK 163 per year for a household with a<lb/> reference person aged 60 and over compared with SKK 560 to 710 for those with a reference person aged<lb/> below 60.<lb/> 77.<lb/> Looking at the employment status of the reference person shows that the retired and the<lb/> unemployed are likely to be the least affected by the cash changeover induced price increases. For the<lb/> retired the financial impact is estimated at SKK 151 per year and household which, given the large overlap<lb/> between the two groups, is very close to the estimate for those aged 60 and above. This suggests that the<lb/> real value of pensions is diminished only slightly as a result of the changeover. The same applies to<lb/> unemployment benefits with the size of the financial impact on a household with an unemployed reference<lb/> person estimated at SKK 138 per year.<lb/> 78.<lb/> Regional differences in the estimated size of the cash changeover-related price increase largely<lb/> reflect regional differences in income levels with a higher impact of around 0.26% in densely populated<lb/> areas (which comprise mainly the Bratislava region) and a lower impact of 0.16 to 0.21% in intermediate<lb/> and sparsely populated areas.<lb/></p>

			<head>4.2<lb/> Impact of financial integration on Slovak consumers and non-financial enterprises<lb/></head>

			<figure>79.<lb/> Slovak households and non-financial companies will benefit from increased convergence of retail<lb/> interest rates towards the euro area level (see Section 3.2), in particular mortgage borrowers as mortgage<lb/> loans currently make up roughly one third of all outstanding loans (and two thirds of outstanding loans to<lb/> 44.<lb/> It cannot be excluded that some of this cost increase might be regained in the future as prices might<lb/> increase by less than they would have done without the changeover-related price hikes.<lb/> 45.<lb/> As no data are available for the share of vehicle purchases in the expenditures of single parents with<lb/> dependent children, the share is set equal to its value in the Czech Republic. This decision is motivated by<lb/> the high correlation of 0.96 between the composition of the consumption basket of this household type in<lb/> the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic. Robustness checks show that alternative methods to derive<lb/> an estimate of the share lead to almost identical results.<lb/></figure>

			<table>ECO/WKP(2008)40<lb/> households). 46 Assuming that interest rates on household loans fully converge to the lower current euro<lb/> area average level, households would benefit from lower interest payment in the order of SKK 6 billion<lb/> (€ 200 million) (Table 12). 47 Around half of this benefit would accrue to mortgage borrowers. This<lb/> compares with around SKK 1 billion (€ 33 million) lower interest payments for non-financial companies,<lb/> reflecting the fact that interest rates for their loans are closer to the euro area level. Depositors would<lb/> benefit from a convergence of Slovak deposit interest rates towards the higher euro area level. Using the<lb/> current stock of deposits, households can expect to receive an additional SKK 4 billion (€ 130 million) in<lb/> interest payments and non-financial companies SKK 1.8 billion (€ 60 million). Total interest savings/gains<lb/> for borrowers and depositors add up to SKK 12¾ billion, around 0.8% of GDP.<lb/></table>

			<p>80.<lb/> Overall, households are thus likely to benefit significantly more from the convergence of retail<lb/> interest rates than non-financial companies. Within the household sector, borrowers will save more in<lb/> interest payments than depositors will gain by receiving higher interest rates. This static calculation (based<lb/> on current outstanding loan amounts) does not take into account that private credit is expanding rapidly as<lb/> is often observed in catch-up countries. For example, the share of mortgage loans in GDP currently<lb/> accounts for 11% (compared with 40% in the euro area), up from around 6% in 2002. Thus, as more and<lb/> more households become debtors and the outstanding amount of loans increases, the benefits of lower<lb/> retail interest rates will also rise in absolute terms.<lb/></p>

			<p>Notes: Savings in interest payments are calculated by assuming complete convergence of Slovak interest rates to the euro area<lb/> average (in both cases using the interest rate levels prevailing in the first quarter of 2008), multiplying the interest rate spread for each<lb/> loan/deposit category with the outstanding amounts in the first quarter of 2008 and summing up across categories. Due to the lack of<lb/> a breakdown for loans to non-financial companies by size in the banking balance sheet, the average spread for loans above/below<lb/> 1 million euro was used in the calculations. The calculation does not include bank overdrafts (for both households and non-financial<lb/> companies) due to the lack of information about outstanding amounts.<lb/></p>

			<figure>Source: National Bank of Slovakia, OECD calculations.<lb/> 81.<lb/> Taking into account the current composition of loans outstanding by initial interest rate fixation<lb/> period, the average Slovak mortgage borrower pays a roughly 1.5 pp higher interest rate on his new<lb/> mortgage than the average euro area borrower. In case interest rates have fully converged to euro area<lb/> 46 .<lb/> Data are taken from the bank balance sheet statistics in April 2008 as published by the National Bank of<lb/> Slovakia and refer to loans granted to residents.<lb/></figure>

			<p>47.<lb/> This and the ensuing calculation are based on applying the interest rate differentials for new business vis-à-<lb/>vis the euro area average (<ref type="table">Table 9</ref>) on the outstanding loan amounts by different categories in April 2008.<lb/> As data for outstanding loan amounts are available only by maturity, we approximated the outstanding<lb/> amounts of households loans by initial interest rate fixation period using the average shares of different<lb/> types of interest fixation of new housing loans granted since 2005. For non-financial companies, we<lb/> assumed the initial interest rate fixation period matches the maturity of the loans. The calculated welfare<lb/> benefits only materialise once the outstanding loan amounts are refinanced as borrowers will benefit from<lb/> the lower interest rates only at the time when they take up a new loan or when they refinance their<lb/> outstanding loan.

			<p>84.<lb/> A lower level of retail interest rates is also likely to have an impact on house prices as it increases<lb/> the affordability of real estate for households. Apart from interest rates, Beka (2007) points to the<lb/> importance of disposable income, development of credit markets, demographics, public housing support,<lb/> as well as supply of new housing as important factors driving real estate prices. While is it undisputed that<lb/> the past dynamic increase in real estate prices in the Slovak Republic (annual price increases have<lb/> averaged over 20% from 2005q1 to 2008q1) has also been driven by a lowering of real interest rates, it<lb/> remains difficult to isolate the effect of this single variable. Empirical analysis is made even more difficult<lb/> by the availability of only a short time series for house price data for the Slovak Republic (starting only in<lb/></p>

			<table>2005).<lb/> 48.<lb/> Developments for loans since 2001, however, indicate that the regional divergence is likely to become<lb/> smaller. Since 2001 the share of the Bratislava region in total new loans to the population has decreased<lb/> from close to 80% to the current 62%. For new deposits, on the other hand, the share of the Bratislava<lb/> region has increased over the past years.<lb/> ECO/WKP(2008)40<lb/> 85.<lb/> Studies on house price determinants in CEE countries, such as Égert and Mihaljek (2007) who<lb/> study a sample of CEE countries (excluding the Slovak Republic due to data constraints)</table>

			<p>usually find that<lb/> house prices are significantly affected by changes in real interest rates. However, they find a wide range of<lb/> impact estimates and thus the definitive size of the real interest rate effect remains somewhat inconclusive.<lb/> The same uncertainty holds for the speed of adjustment of house prices to real interest rates. For example,<lb/> it is conceivable that prices have already risen in expectation of this future decline in real interest rates.<lb/> Such concerns are all the more important as the convergence of retail interest rates to euro area levels is<lb/> likely to take some time and thus any increasing effect on house prices will be spread over several years.<lb/> Hence, although the expected decline in mortgage interest rates is likely to give a further boost to house<lb/> prices, the magnitude and timing of the effect is difficult to gauge.<lb/></p>

			<head>5.<lb/> Summary and policy recommendations<lb/></head>

			<p>This paper has studied the impact of euro adoption on inflation and interest rates in the<lb/> Slovak Republic. In general, the immediate impacts in January 2009 are likely to be relatively small. While<lb/> euro cash changeover effects on prices could be sizeable in specific sectors and for particular groups of<lb/> consumer items, the overall price level may rise by around 0.3%, in line with the experience from previous<lb/> countries that joined the euro area. Price effects can be expected to materialise rather quickly, either<lb/> already before the euro adoption or shortly after the &quot; hot phase &quot; of price watch terminates. As euro<lb/> membership has been fully priced in on capital markets, short-as well as long-term interest rates will<lb/> probably not change at all in January 2009.<lb/></p>

			<p>More significant will be the medium-to longer term effects of euro adoption. First, as the exchange<lb/> rate vis-à-vis the euro is irrevocably fixed, there will no longer be a damping effect on inflation (from<lb/> exchange rate appreciation) through imports from the euro area, at least after past exchange rate changes<lb/> have filtered through the distribution chain by around the middle of 2009. Second, Balassa-Samuelson and<lb/> other effects related to catch-up countries may raise the Slovak inflation rate above the euro area level for a<lb/> longer period of time, although the size of the effect is difficult to quantify. Regarding interest rates, euro<lb/> adoption will foster financial integration with the euro area and this is likely to lead to a convergence of<lb/> Slovak retail interest rates towards euro area levels. However, those interest rate changes associated with<lb/> capital market integration will materialise only over a medium to long term horizon.<lb/> Taking into account that the euro changeover will have an impact on inflation and interest rates at<lb/> different points in time, the following policy recommendations are organised according to their time<lb/> horizon.<lb/></p>

			<head>Policy recommendations for the short term – From now to mid 2009<lb/></head>

			<p>• Rounding effects should only exert a minor upward pressure on prices. A pure mathematical<lb/> rounding procedure would lead to rounding up in five out of 10 cases while rounding down in<lb/> four out of ten cases.</p>

			<head>Public information campaigns as well as negotiations with retailers should<lb/> therefore emphasize that euro adoption does not automatically mean rounding up prices. The<lb/> same logic also applies to the transition to a system of new &quot; attractive prices &quot; .<lb/></head>

			<p>• Publicly administered prices as well as prices and fees for public services still play an important<lb/> role in the consumption basket for Slovak citizens. The changeover for such price items in the<lb/> public domain should be presented as show case. For such prices the need to charge &quot; attractive &quot;<lb/> numbers is less evident.</p>

			<head>Publicly determined prices and fees should be changed strictly<lb/> according to the conversion rate. The euro adoption should be used as an opportunity to<lb/></head>

			<table>introduce publicly available price and fee comparisons for public services, like public and<lb/> municipal utilities.<lb/> ECO/WKP(2008)40<lb/> • International retail chains are already operating in the Slovak Republic. Most of them offer price<lb/> information which is available via the internet. Consumer protection organizations could<lb/> consider to put together representative samples of consumer baskets and maintain a &quot; beauty<lb/> contest &quot; for retail chains, which is publicly accessible. Such comparisons should also include<lb/> neighbouring countries, especially Austria and Hungary, which are in reach for a large share of<lb/> consumers in Western Slovakia.<lb/></table>

			<p>• Calculations show that those socio-economic groups which are likely to experience a larger<lb/> increase in the costs of their consumption expenditure also have a higher income.</p>

			<head>Programs to<lb/> compensate for the price level effects of euro adoption should be limited to low income groups,<lb/> especially families with children. General transfer increases would only stimulate price increases<lb/> and should be avoided.<lb/></head>

			<p>• If suppliers want to increase their profits by gaining market share (and not by increasing prices)<lb/> during the changeover period then any obstacles to bring the additional supply to the market will<lb/> deter firms from choosing such a strategy.</p>

			<head>Remaining administrative obstacles to increase supply<lb/> should be removed and arguments in their favour, referring to health and safety concerns should<lb/> be carefully examined to avoid that such concerns are misused as entry barriers which protect<lb/> insiders.<lb/></head>

			<p>Unavoidable changeover costs, like menu costs, as well as costs related to the handling of a new<lb/> currency for some time in parallel with the current Slovak koruna, are equivalent to a one-off cost<lb/> increase, which – under conditions of perfect competition – will be shared among suppliers and<lb/> consumers according to the slopes of demand and supply schedules. Such cost increases cannot be<lb/> rolled forward into wage increases without increasing wage costs throughout the economy and thus<lb/> putting employment at risk.</p>

			<head>Social partners should be encouraged to exclude changeover costs from<lb/> wage and price negotiations in the current and next rounds.<lb/> Policy recommendations for the medium term<lb/></head>

			<p>• Competition is limiting the scope for misusing the euro changeover for an increase of mark-ups<lb/> and to reap extra profits. A competition friendly regulatory environment, which keeps entry<lb/> barriers low and avoids administrative overheads and red tape, is a powerful ally for the<lb/> changeover campaign. While past reforms have achieved a lot already, much remains still to be<lb/> done and this also includes network industries. Although regulatory changes need time to<lb/> exercise an impact it is now the time to use this opportunity.</p>

			<table>The government should use the euro<lb/> changeover to reduce and remove altogether entry barriers and accelerate its efforts to remove<lb/> administrative barriers. Where competition is not yet possible due to the existence of natural<lb/> monopolies, regulators should be endowed with sufficient powers to allow the use of private<lb/> networks at fair conditions and to set prices which do not include excessive monopoly rents.<lb/></table>

			<p>• Financial market integration should lead to lower spreads, not the least because of the removal of<lb/> any exchange rate risk within the euro area. Currently lending rates are above the euro area<lb/> average, while deposit rates are below. Experience from the euro area demonstrates that financial<lb/> sector integration takes time and that it more often takes the form of takeovers than cross border<lb/> expansion. This process has been more or less concluded insofar as domestic (Slovak) banks and<lb/> financial institutions are involved. However, there may be some scope for consolidation among<lb/> the foreign banks.</p>

			<table>The government should investigate in co-operation with the central bank and<lb/> financial market supervision in how far barriers for the establishment of a more competition<lb/> friendly market structure in financial services exist. In order to reap these potential benefits from<lb/> a pro-competitive market structure it will also be necessary to make sure that the associated cost<lb/> cutting opportunities can be exercised.<lb/></table>

			<p>• Adopting the euro will eliminate the opportunity to pursue real appreciation via nominal<lb/> appreciation. This is important for catching up economies, which have lower prices in domestic<lb/> services sectors than in richer euro area member countries. This Balassa-Samuelson effect will<lb/> damp real interest rates and can possibly contribute to a boom-and bust cycle. In order to avoid<lb/> such a scenario the government should prepare a comprehensive policy package in order to<lb/> compensate for the loss of monetary policy and the elimination of the nominal exchange rate as a<lb/> channel for real appreciation. Such a package should include:<lb/></p>

			<head>− Measures to increase the scope for competition in domestic services sectors in order to close<lb/></head>

			<table>the gap of productivity growth with the (international competition exposed) export<lb/> manufacturing sector. Such a measure would reduce the Balassa-Samuelson effect directly.<lb/> − Measures to reduce the attractiveness of loan financed asset bubbles, in particular a capital<lb/> gains tax. Such a measure would reduce the attraction of investing in a bubble market.<lb/> − Maintaining a prudent fiscal stance and avoiding in particular to expand general transfer<lb/> programs. The government should continue to improve the incentives to work as well as to<lb/> search for work and to participate in lifelong learning in order to be employable longer.<lb/> Such measures would increase the overall supply of labour and avoid a premature<lb/> overheating of the labour market.<lb/> − Establishing a regulatory environment which allows the development of a rental housing<lb/> market. This would reduce the need to enter the housing market as a buyer in order to satisfy<lb/> a housing need.<lb/> ECO/WKP(2008)40<lb/> WORKING PAPERS<lb/> The full series of Economics Department Working Papers can be consulted at www.oecd.org/eco/Working_Papers/<lb/> 631.
