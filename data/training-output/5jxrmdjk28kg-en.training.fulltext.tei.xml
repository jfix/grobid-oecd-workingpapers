			<head>Abstract/Résumé<lb/> Making Economic Growth more Socially Inclusive in Germany<lb/></head>

			<p>While past labour market reforms have been successful in terms of employment, the relative poverty risk<lb/> and income inequality have remained broadly unchanged in recent years. Some social groups remain<lb/> particularly vulnerable, including individuals in non-regular employment, the unemployed and the low<lb/> skilled. If in employment, their jobs tend to be unstable and wages and income mobility low. Continued<lb/> efforts are needed to foster economic growth in a more inclusive manner, such that the most vulnerable<lb/> groups benefit from and contribute to economic growth more strongly and such that the gaps between the<lb/> rich and the poor in terms of income and wellbeing are reduced. These efforts should include enhancing<lb/> the labour market outcomes of the most vulnerable and increase upward income mobility among<lb/> disadvantaged individuals; strengthening skills at the lower end of the skills distribution; revising the tax<lb/> and benefit system to improve incentives and to ensure efficient and well-targeted redistribution; and to<lb/> make health and old-age pension insurance more inclusive. This working paper relates to the 2014 OECD<lb/> Economic Survey of Germany (http://www.oecd.org/eco/surveys/economic-survey-germany.htm).<lb/></p>

			<figure>**********<lb/> Rendre la croissance économique plus inclusive en Allemagne<lb/> Alors que les réformes du marché du travail opérées dans le passé ont été bénéfiques en termes d&apos;emploi,<lb/> le risque de pauvreté relative et les inégalités de revenus n&apos;ont quasiment pas changé ces dernières années.<lb/> Certains groupes sociaux restent particulièrement vulnérables, notamment les personnes ayant un emploi<lb/> précaire, les chômeurs et les personnes peu qualifiées. Lorsque les personnes concernées ont un travail, il<lb/> s&apos;agit généralement d&apos;emplois peu stables, et les salaires sont bas et la mobilité salariale faible. Il est<lb/> nécessaire de poursuivre les efforts, pour faire en sorte que les groupes les plus vulnérables puissent<lb/> bénéficier d&apos;une croissance économique plus vigoureuse et y contribuer, pour accroître la mobilité à la<lb/> hausse des revenus parmi les personnes défavorisées et pour atténuer les inégalités. L&apos;accent devrait être<lb/> mis sur les instruments de l&apos;action publique permettant à la fois de réduire les inégalités de revenus et de<lb/> doper la croissance du PIB. Il s&apos;agit notamment d&apos;améliorer le devenir professionnel des plus vulnérables;<lb/> de renforcer les compétences au bas de l&apos;échelle de distribution des compétences; de réviser le système de<lb/> prélèvements et de prestations pour améliorer les incitations; et assurer une redistribution efficiente et bien<lb/> ciblée; et rendre l&apos;assurance santé et l&apos;assurance retraite plus inclusives.

			<figure>ECO/WKP(2014)71<lb/> 6<lb/> MAKING ECONOMIC GROWTH MORE SOCIALLY INCLUSIVE IN GERMANY<lb/> By Andreas Kappeler0 F and Andrés Fuentes Hutfilter 1<lb/> Strong labour market performance has had little impact on relative poverty risks and inequality<lb/></figure>

			<p>1.<lb/> Inequality and relative poverty in Germany are below levels observed in many OECD countries<lb/> They have risen since the mid-90s, as elsewhere, although income inequality has not increased since 2004<lb/> (<ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>, bottom panel). GDP growth has benefited households with high incomes more than those with<lb/> low incomes since the mid-1990s. The ratio of the top 10% to bottom 10% of disposable incomes has<lb/> increased more than in many other OECD economies, especially before 2005. Relative poverty increased<lb/> particularly in East Germany, affecting 20% in 2009, which is almost twice as much as in the West. While<lb/> real disposable household income inequality in East and West Germany did not converge much in the early<lb/> 2000s, some convergence has occurred since 2005 (<ref type="biblio">Grabka et al., 2012</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<figure>Figure 1. Relative poverty¹ and income inequality²<lb/></figure>

			<p>2.<lb/> Thanks to the robust labour market, and in stark contrast to many other European countries,<lb/> German household income has increased since 2007, benefitting incomes at both ends of the scale (OECD,<lb/> 2012 and 2013a). Nevertheless, despite sustained employment growth and a significant drop in<lb/> unemployment, largely brought about by far-reaching labour market reforms in the mid-2000s (OECD,<lb/> 2012a), income inequality has not declined markedly over this period, either in absolute terms or relative to<lb/> developments in OECD countries on average. The risk of relative poverty has, if anything, increased<lb/> (OECD, 2013a). Kierzenkowski and Koske (2012) have identified a number of determinants of income<lb/> inequality, some of them being particularly relevant for Germany (Box 1).<lb/></p>

			<head>Box 1. Determinants of rising income inequality and risk of relative poverty<lb/></head>

			<p>Skill-biased technological change: In many OECD countries, labour markets have become polarised, with<lb/> computer technology depressing the middle of the wage and employment distributions where workers perform skilled<lb/> but routine tasks, which leads to an increase in income inequality at the top end and a decrease at the low end. This<lb/> pattern also appears in Germany (<ref type="biblio">Dustmann et al., 2009; Spitz-Oener, 2006</ref>).<lb/> Education: Wage inequality is negatively correlated with the average level of educational attainment. In Germany<lb/> returns to education have been broadly stable over time (<ref type="biblio">Prasad, 2004; OECD, 2013d</ref>). Higher educational attainment<lb/> is also positively correlated with well-being, in part because of more rewarding jobs.<lb/> International trade: Globalisation seems to have important implications for at least some groups of workers. In<lb/> particular, offshoring appears to reduce employment and wages of medium-skilled workers performing routine tasks,<lb/> thus reinforcing labour-market polarization.<lb/> Immigration: Immigration has a small impact on native workers and sizeable adverse wage or employment<lb/> effects on the cohorts of previous immigrants are found for Germany, implying only small effects for overall labour<lb/> income inequality (D&apos;<ref type="biblio">Amuri et al., 2010; Steinhardt, 2011</ref>).<lb/> Labour market regulation: It has been relaxed over the past 20 to 25 years in many OECD countries. The impact<lb/> of declining unionisation and of the lower relative minimum wage, observed in many countries, is most pronounced at<lb/> the lower end of the wage distribution. However, many such institutions (e.g. employment protection legislation,<lb/> minimum wage) have opposite effects on employment and wage dispersion leaving the final impact on inequality<lb/> undetermined (OECD, 2011). For Germany, there is little evidence that the labour market reforms in the mid-2000s<lb/> have raised inequality.<lb/></p>

			<head>Household structure: Changes</head>

			<p>in the household structure, driven by a tendency towards more single households,<lb/> are an important trigger for poverty at the microeconomic level (OECD, 2008a). Among others, the labour market<lb/> reforms in the mid-2000s have generated incentives for subsistence payment beneficiaries to form single-households<lb/> (<ref type="biblio">Peichl et al., 2010</ref>). The formation of smaller households due to separation is likely to affect spouses with low<lb/> earnings and their children most.<lb/></p>

			<head>Inequality is marked in market incomes, wealth and well-being indicators<lb/></head>

			<p>3.<lb/> Inequality in market incomes is higher than in many other OECD economies (<ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>). The<lb/> long-term increase in inequality of market incomes has been driven by rising disparities in labour incomes,<lb/> and a particularly uneven distribution of self-employment incomes (OECD, 2012b). However, taxes and<lb/> cash transfers play a larger role in mitigating market income inequality and risk of relative poverty than in<lb/> most other countries. According to most recent data, the German tax-benefit system reduces inequality<lb/> among the working-age population by almost 30%.<lb/></p>

			<figure>Figure 2. Effect of net taxes and transfers on income¹ inequality²<lb/></figure>

			<table>Gini coefficient, 2010³<lb/> 1.<lb/> Income refers to cash income excluding imputed components such as home production and imputed rents regularly received<lb/> over the year. Market income (i.e. before taxes and transfers) includes earnings (broken down into those of the household head,<lb/> of the spouse and of other household members); self-employment income; and capital income (rents, dividends and interest).<lb/> 2.<lb/> Income inequality is measured as Gini coefficient for equivalised household market income and disposable income for the total<lb/> population. It ranges from zero (perfect equality) to one (where one individual receives all).<lb/> 3.<lb/> 2011 for Chile; 2009 for Ireland, Japan, Switzerland and New Zealand. Market income Gini coefficient is not available for<lb/> Hungary, Mexico and Turkey. The OECD average is calculated as a population-weighted average of 26 countries available for<lb/> 2010.<lb/> Source: OECD Income Distribution and Poverty database.<lb/></table>

			<p>4.<lb/> Besides income inequality at any given point in time, the likelihood of an individual to move up<lb/> or down the income distribution (income mobility, often measured in moves across quintiles) also matters<lb/> for life-time inequality. Workless and low-income households suffer particularly from low upward income<lb/> mobility as it raises the likelihood of long-lasting or repeated spells of poverty (OECD, 2008a) and<lb/> prevents them from benefiting from and contributing to more economic growth. It is therefore worrisome<lb/> that equivalised disposable income mobility has declined particularly for low income households since the<lb/> late 1990s (German Council of Economic Experts, 2011 and 2013), with income mobility being especially<lb/> low in East Germany. Wage mobility also steadily declined between 1976 and 2008 (<ref type="biblio">Aretz, 2013</ref>), raising<lb/> the risk of relative poverty for workers in the low wage sector. Changes in job stability and employment<lb/> characteristics, including unemployment history, tenure and type of industry, explain a significant share of<lb/> this decline (<ref type="biblio">Riphahn and Schnitzlein, 2011</ref>).<lb/> 5.<lb/> In-kind benefits paid for by governments, notably health and education services have an<lb/> important redistributive effect, but they are not reflected in the monetary measures of income inequality<lb/> and risk of relative poverty. Although government spending on in-kind benefits is comparatively high as a<lb/> share of GDP, its redistributive effect is estimated to be relatively small, which may suggest poor targeting<lb/> (OECD<ref type="biblio">, 2011; Verbist et al., 2012; Adema et al., 2011</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<p>Wealth is less evenly distributed than income and has become more uneven (German Council of<lb/> Economic <ref type="biblio">Experts, 2009</ref>). It is also less evenly distributed across households than in other European<lb/> economies (<ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>). At 37%, the share of households without any property or wealth is comparatively<lb/> large. The 10% wealthiest households earn 31% of gross incomes and own 59% of net wealth (<ref type="biblio">Deutsche<lb/> Bundesbank, 2013</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<figure>Figure 3. Distribution of household net wealth¹<lb/></figure>

			<table>Ratio of top to bottom quintile, 2009²<lb/> 1.<lb/> Net wealth is the difference between total household assets and total household liabilities.<lb/> 2.<lb/> 2010 for Italy; 2007 for Spain.<lb/> Source: European Central Bank (2013), &quot;The Eurosystem Household Finance and Consumption Survey -Statistical Tables&quot;, April.<lb/></table>

			<p>6.<lb/> A relatively large number of small households in Germany may account to some extent for the<lb/> larger share of households with low wealth. Home ownership, which is the most important component of<lb/> household net wealth, is highly concentrated among the wealthiest (<ref type="biblio">Deutsche Bundesbank, 2013; Andrews<lb/> and Caldera Sánchez, 2011</ref>). The tax regime may have encouraged wealthy households to invest in<lb/> residential real estate (see below). The divergence of wealth between East and West Germany also<lb/> contributes to the uneven distribution of wealth (<ref type="biblio">Frick and Grabka, 2009</ref>).<lb/> 7.<lb/> According to the OECD well-being framework, which encompasses eleven domains covering<lb/> both material and non-material living conditions, German households enjoy a relatively high level of<lb/> economic welfare and perform well in most domains (OECD, 2013g). However, well-being outcomes for<lb/> individuals with high income/high education are considerably better than for individuals with low<lb/> income/low education in several domains. For instance, individuals with high income report a considerably<lb/> better health status than individuals with low income. The strong impact of socio-economic background on<lb/> education attainment also points towards inequalities in well-being outcomes (<ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>). Moreover, 25% of<lb/> individuals live in households where the total housing costs – net of housing allowances – represent 40%<lb/> or more of their disposable income (10% OECD wide; OECD, 2013g).<lb/></p>

			<head>Identifying the most vulnerable to risks of poverty<lb/></head>

			<p>8.<lb/> Some social groups – including low skilled, individuals in non-regular employment and<lb/> unemployed – are particularly vulnerable. They face a high risk of relative poverty and, if in employment,<lb/> their jobs tend to be unstable, their wages low and their income mobility subdued.<lb/></p>

			<figure>ECO/WKP(2014)71<lb/> Figure 4. Average well-being outcomes, 2013<lb/> Note: Indicators are normalized to range between 10 (best) and 0 according to the following formula: (indicator value -minimum<lb/> value) / (maximum value -minimum value) multiplied by 10.<lb/></figure>

While the share of low skilled individuals in the population is<lb/> low, a relatively large share of low wage earners has low skills. This suggests that job matching is<lb/> effective, but also that better targeted efforts to improve skills could considerably improve the income<lb/> prospects of these workers. The large share of women in the low wage sector partly reflects the large gap<lb/> between men and women in hourly wages. This may partly be due to more frequent and extended<lb/> interruptions in working careers, a larger share of women who work part-time and differences in<lb/> occupation (OECD, 2012h). The gender gap in full-time earnings is one of the largest among OECD<lb/> countries. This is also true for the bottom quintile of full-time earners (OECD, 2013f).<lb/></p>

			<head>Workers in non-regular employment are exposed to high poverty risks<lb/></head>

			<p>10.<lb/> While past labour market reforms have put more workers into jobs, poverty risks are high for<lb/> workers in non-regular employment (defined here as employees with relatively low employment protection<lb/> or limited access to unemployment insurance), as well as many part-time and self-employed workers,<lb/> especially those without employees (<ref type="table">Table 1</ref>). As in other OECD countries, such workers are often paid<lb/> low wages, suffer from low wage mobility and are less well protected than workers on permanent contracts<lb/> (OECD, 2012a).<lb/></p>

Non-regular employment consists here of temporary<lb/> employees, workers in marginal employment (minijobs) and temporary agency workers. Overlaps among the different forms of non-<lb/>regular employment and part-time employment exist.<lb/> Source: Federal Statistical Office of Germany.<lb/></table>

			<p>11.<lb/> Part-time work is particularly widespread among women: only 62% of employed women work<lb/> full-time compared to 74% OECD-wide in 2012. Part-time work is characterised by a high risk of relative<lb/> poverty. Also, their prospects of moving to full-time, permanent employment are often limited. They often<lb/> face unstable employment, they tend to receive less in-work training and have poor chances to move up the<lb/> income ladder. A considerable number of vulnerable part-timers is in marginal employment (minijobs, see<lb/> Box 3 below). These vulnerabilities are attenuated to some extent at the household level, as many part-time<lb/> workers are secondary earners. Nonetheless, even for secondary earners in high-income households part-<lb/>time employment may entail the risk of falling into relative poverty in the future, for example in the case of<lb/> changes in the household, possibly as a result of separation.<lb/> 12.<lb/> The number of workers in employment receiving top-up subsistence benefits increased to 3% of<lb/> total employment in 2011. Most are in marginal employment and 18% are single parents (<ref type="biblio">Bruckmeier<lb/> et al., 2013</ref>). Some 44% of individuals receiving subsistence payments who find a job continue to depend<lb/> on top-up benefits and 45% are in employment for 6 months or less, which may reduce their income<lb/> mobility (<ref type="biblio">Koller and Rudolph, 2011</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<figure>The unemployed face a very high risk of relative poverty<lb/> 13.<lb/> Many workers in non-regular employment acquire little or no unemployment insurance benefit<lb/> entitlements, but face a high risk of unemployment. Lack of employment is particularly widespread among<lb/> single parent households, which represent 5.9% of total households. Sixty-five per cent of single parents<lb/> were in employment in 2008, less than in most other OECD countries, and labour market participation is<lb/> particularly low for mothers with children aged 4 or less (Federal Ministry of Finance, 2012). Also<lb/> individuals approaching retirement age are characterized by low employment and a high risk of relative<lb/> poverty.<lb/> 14.<lb/> While long-term unemployment has decreased sharply in recent years, it continues to account for<lb/> more than 40% of total unemployment. The long-term unemployed are particularly vulnerable to poverty<lb/> risks, because longer unemployment spells reduce employability and workers lose their unemployment<lb/> ECO/WKP(2014)71<lb/> insurance benefit entitlement. Low skilled workers are more likely to face long-term unemployment<lb/> (<ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref>). Also older works face a high risk of long-term unemployment which, unlike for youth and<lb/> prime-age individuals, is close to the EU average. The high incidence of long-term unemployment among<lb/> older workers, including those with medium vocational qualifications, suggests that older workers with a<lb/> narrow set of skills have difficulties to adapt to structural changes in the economy that may occur during<lb/> their working life.<lb/></p>

			<head>15.<lb/></head>

			<p>The risk of relative poverty for immigrants is almost twice as high as for German nationals, in<lb/> part because unemployment among immigrants is about twice as high. Moreover, the incidence of<lb/> long-term unemployment is high, also in international comparison (OECD, 2012f). The high share of the<lb/> low skilled among immigrants reduces their wages and employability (<ref type="biblio">Koske et al., 2012</ref>). To some extent<lb/> this is also true among second generation immigrants indicating the need to make integration policies more<lb/> effective.<lb/></p>

			<head>Structural reforms to promote inclusive growth<lb/></head>

			<p>16.<lb/> Continued efforts are needed to foster economic growth in a more inclusive manner, such that the<lb/> most vulnerable groups benefit from and contribute to economic growth more strongly and such that the<lb/> gaps between the rich and the poor in terms of income and wellbeing are reduced. As discussed below,<lb/> more inclusive growth requires enhancing the labour market outcomes of the most vulnerable and<lb/> improving skills at the lower end of the skills distribution, as well as reforms of the tax and benefit system<lb/> to ensure efficient and well-targeted redistribution. The focus should be on policy instruments which entail<lb/> a double dividend by reducing income inequality and boosting GDP growth at the same time. Going for<lb/> Growth 2012 has benchmarked a number of policy instruments against these two objectives (Box 2;<lb/> OECD, 2012g).<lb/></p>

			<head>Box 2. Policy instruments and their impact on inequality and economic growth<lb/></head>

			<p>General policy trade-offs and complementarities between growth and income distribution objectives as identified<lb/> in Going for Growth 2012 are summarized in <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<p> Policies which reduce income inequality and at the same time boost long-run GDP per capita include<lb/> instruments to raise human capital while making it less dependent on personal and social circumstances,<lb/> reducing labour market duality, promoting the integration of immigrants and fostering female labour market<lb/> participation. Some tax policies, notably to reduce tax expenditures, contributes to equity objectives while<lb/> also allowing a growth-friendly cut in effective marginal tax rates, in particular for lower income recipients.<lb/></p>

			<p> Several policies may entail a trade-off between reducing income inequality and raising GDP per capita. For<lb/> instance, administrative extensions of collective wage agreements may reduce wage earnings dispersion<lb/> among workers, but they may harm competition and productivity and possibly reduce employment. Shifting<lb/> the tax mix to less-distorting taxes -in particular away from labour and corporate income taxes towards<lb/> consumption, proper pricing of environmental externalities and real estate taxes -would improve incentives<lb/> to work, save and invest, but may require additional steps to address adverse implications for equity.<lb/></p>

			<figure>Source: Koske et al. (2012).<lb/> Reducing market income inequality through labour market reforms<lb/> 17.<lb/></figure>

			<p>There is scope to help the most vulnerable to improve their labour market outcomes, which<lb/> would boost growth and at the same time address the uneven distribution of market incomes. Three reform<lb/> areas deserve particular attention: avoiding low employment and low pay traps, avoiding a dual labour<lb/> market and strengthening active labour market policies (ALMP).<lb/></p>

			<head>Removing barriers to full-time employment would reduce poverty risks<lb/></head>

			<p>18.<lb/> Policies that discourage full-time employment should be carefully reviewed as they tend to<lb/> reduce upwards income mobility of vulnerable individuals and growth. This section argues that the high<lb/> incidence of part-time employment is favoured by the tax treatment of marginal employment and the<lb/> ECO/WKP(2014)71<lb/> limited supply of full-time childcare facilities, which also makes it difficult for families with children to<lb/> fully participate in economic activity.<lb/></p>

			<head>Avoiding low employment and low pay traps<lb/></head>

			<p>19.<lb/> Marginal employment (so-called minijobs) refers to low income employment contracts of up to<lb/> EUR 450 per month, which benefit from tax subsidies, are partially exempt from the mandatory public<lb/> pension system and fully exempt from unemployment insurance (Box 3). minijobs were intended as a<lb/> stepping stone towards permanent full-time employment relationships but a success has not been proven.<lb/> Reduced income tax and social security rates are phased out between EUR 450 and EUR 850 via so-called<lb/> midijobs, thereby implying high marginal tax rates for individuals willing to work more (<ref type="biblio">Freier and<lb/> Steiner, 2007; Körner et al., 2013; Fertig and Kluve, 2007</ref>). Workers in minijobs tend to suffer from low<lb/> in-work training opportunities and low wage mobility, locking them into their marginal employment status<lb/> (<ref type="biblio">Voss and Weinkopf, 2012</ref>). Some workers on minijobs are exposed to a rising risk of relative poverty<lb/> once they retire or in case of losing their job (<ref type="biblio">Hohendanner and Stegmaier, 2012</ref>) because they acquire low<lb/> pension entitlements and are not entitled to unemployment insurance benefits. As the tax subsidy is not<lb/> targeted to low income individuals, many minijobs are taken up by second earners to avoid high taxation in<lb/> the context of the joint income taxation of couples. Minijobs also create an additional tax advantage for<lb/> workers with more than one job, one of them being marginal employment, as income from other jobs does<lb/> not count towards the minijob income ceiling. The number of individuals using marginal employment as<lb/> side job has almost doubled since 2004 and accounted for 34% of all individuals with a minijob in 2011<lb/> (<ref type="biblio">Hohendanner and Stegmaier, 2012</ref>). Minijobs should be better targeted towards low-wage workers. For<lb/> example, tax subsidies should not be provided for combining jobs, one of them being a minijob.<lb/></p>

			<head>Box 3. Minijobs -characteristics and incidence<lb/></head>

			<p>Minijobs refer to employment contracts for earnings of currently up to EUR 450 per month with reduced income<lb/> tax and social security contribution rates and entitlements. Mandatory social security contribution rates amount to<lb/> roughly 29%, compared to 39% or more for permanent full-time employment. Unlike the case of permanent full-time<lb/> employment, compulsory social security contributions are fully paid by employers. Since 2013 individuals can opt out<lb/> of full pension coverage by not paying the employees&apos; pension contribution rate of 3.9%, on top of the employer&apos;s<lb/> mandatory contribution of 15%. In practice, this option leaves a considerably share of individuals in marginal<lb/> employment with limited entitlement once they retire. Workers in marginal employment do not contribute to<lb/> unemployment insurance and are not entitled to unemployment insurance benefits. They are subject to income tax at a<lb/> flat-rate of 2%. Many individuals in marginal employment, about 5.5 million in total, are students, pensioners or second<lb/> earners (<ref type="table">Table 3</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<p>Midijobs, referring to earnings between EUR 450 and EUR 850, are subject to reduced social insurance contributions as well, but with<lb/> rates increasing gradually to the standard rates. There were 1.37 million midijobs in 2011.<lb/></p>

			<head>Further expansion of childcare to facilitate full-time employment<lb/></head>

			<p>20.<lb/> Sufficient and affordable formal childcare facilitates the labour market integration of single<lb/> parents and improves earnings prospects, especially for low income households (<ref type="biblio">Rainer et al., 2011; Rainer<lb/> et al., 2013</ref>). A lack of childcare facilities is of particular concern for single parents as they and their<lb/> children are subject to high poverty risks in Germany (<ref type="biblio">Zabel, 2011</ref>). Formal childcare also favours other<lb/> family policy goals, such as increasing fertility and improving work-life balance.<lb/></p>

			<figure>Figure 7. Public expenditure on childcare and early education services<lb/> As a percentage of GDP, 2009<lb/> Note: Aggregate spending for Spain.<lb/> Source: OECD Family database.<lb/></figure>

			<p>21.<lb/> Germany is making progress in expanding childcare and has guaranteed access for all parents, if<lb/> only for a few hours per day. However, enrolment rates in early childcare (one-to-two-year-olds) remain<lb/> low and access to full-time care is limited. One reason is comparatively low total public spending on<lb/> childcare and early education (see <ref type="figure">Figure 7</ref>), although it has increased in recent years. Since August 2013<lb/> parents have a legal claim to public care for children aged one year or more. In practice, however, several<lb/> conditions may prevent parents from enforcing this right. For instance they cannot reject offered places,<lb/> even if they imply longer commuting distance. Moreover, the availability of full-time care remains limited,<lb/> also for pupils more than 5 years old (<ref type="biblio">Blossfeld et al., 2013; OECD, 2014</ref>). Efforts should continue to<lb/> expand early childcare, notably full-time care and all-day school provision.<lb/> 22.<lb/> Attendance at formal childcare is particularly low among children from low income households<lb/> or with a migrant background (<ref type="biblio">Spieß et al., 2008; Blossfeld et al., 2013; Authoring Group Educational<lb/> Reporting, 2013</ref>). While 33% of children without migration background attend childcare at the age of zero<lb/> to 3 years, only 16% of children with migration background do so (<ref type="biblio">Federal Statistical Office, 2012</ref>). These<lb/> households are often less informed about the benefits of formal childcare and may particularly be<lb/> discouraged by high fees. However early childcare and childhood education is an important determinant of<lb/> learning outcomes later on (<ref type="biblio">Heckman and Masterov, 2007</ref>). The most seriously disadvantaged children<lb/> reap particularly large cognitive and non-cognitive skill gains (<ref type="biblio">Heckman and Raut, 2013</ref>). Children with<lb/> migrant background also benefit by acquiring language through education (OECD, 2008a). Further efforts<lb/> and resources are needed to raise the participation of children with weak socio-economic background in<lb/> early childcare and early childhood education. Fees are set by municipalities and thus vary considerably<lb/> across regions (<ref type="biblio">Gathmann and Sass, 2012</ref>). Equal access to affordable high-quality childcare should be<lb/> ensured independently of place of residence and socio-economic background.<lb/></p>

			<head>Avoiding a dual labour market<lb/></head>

			<p>23.<lb/> The gap between employment protection of permanent workers with long seniority and<lb/> temporary workers is large in Germany (<ref type="figure">Figure 8</ref>). One reason is that Germany is the OECD country with<lb/> the most far-reaching employment protection legislation for workers with open-ended contracts. A reform<lb/> in 2011 tightened regulation of temporary agency workers and the 2013 coalition agreement spelled out<lb/> plans to go somewhat further in this direction by requiring equal pay between in-house workers and<lb/> temporary agency workers with equal tasks after 9 months. In contrast, the use of fixed-term contracts has<lb/> been eased substantially since the late 1990s and regulation of temporary contracts is now among the least<lb/> restrictive among OECD countries (<ref type="biblio">Eichhorst and Tobsch, 2013</ref>). For example, it is under certain<lb/> conditions possible to use multiple successive fixed-term contracts with the same employee (European<lb/> Court of Justice, 2012), generating incentives to substitute regular work contracts with fixed-term<lb/> contracts.<lb/></p>

			<figure>Figure 8. Protection of temporary and regular workers<lb/> Scale 0 (least restrictions) to 6 (most restrictions), 2013<lb/> 1.<lb/> Aggregate contributions of employment protection for regular workers against individual dismissals and additional cost of<lb/> collective dismissals.<lb/> Source: OECD (2013), Employment Outlook.<lb/></figure>

			<p>24.<lb/> Permanent employment has contributed strongly to employment growth in Germany in recent<lb/> years. Thirty nine per cent of workers on temporary contracts moved to a permanent contract within one<lb/> year (<ref type="biblio">Walwei, 2013</ref>). However, international evidence shows that a large gap in employment protection<lb/> between permanent and temporary workers often tends to thwart employability (<ref type="biblio">de Serres et al., 2012</ref>),<lb/> increases inequality (Box 1) and hampers the transition from non-regular employment to permanent full-<lb/>time employment. It thereby also lowers wage mobility (<ref type="biblio">Riphahn and Schnitzlein, 2011; Koske et al.,<lb/> 2012</ref>). Against this backdrop, the gap in employment protection between permanent and temporary<lb/> workers should be reduced to further improve the transition of workers in temporary employment<lb/> relationships into permanent jobs. The strict regulation of regular employment should be reviewed along<lb/> the lines suggested in the 2012 Economic Survey of Germany. Simultaneously the regulation of fixed term<lb/> contracts should be reviewed as well. In particular, the use of multiple successive fixed term contracts with<lb/> the same employee should be limited in scope.<lb/></p>

			<head>A minimum wage consistent with preserving employment<lb/></head>

			<p>25.<lb/> A minimum wage may be an effective instrument to reduce the dispersion of wages while<lb/> preserving employment prospects (<ref type="biblio">Garloff, 2010; Card and Krueger, 1995</ref>). It may also limit the need for<lb/> benefit top-ups the government pays to low-wage recipients. Negative employment effects are less likely to<lb/> occur when employers&apos; bargaining power is high and workers&apos; bargaining power is low (<ref type="biblio">Koske et al.,<lb/> 2012</ref>). In such cases there is potential for redistribution of rents without reducing employment. For<lb/> example, low wealth and low income (especially in the absence of unemployment benefit entitlement) can<lb/> push job searchers to accept jobs paying below the marginal product in order to avoid the costs of<lb/> continuing searching. Search models show that a minimum wage may even generate positive employment<lb/> effects, as a minimum wage raises incentives for individuals to work and improve their skills (<ref type="biblio">Acemoglu<lb/> and Pischke, 2001; OECD, 2008b</ref>). The experience of the United Kingdom, which implemented a fairly<lb/> low minimum wage relative to the median wage in 1999, but subsequently increased it substantially in<lb/> several steps, shows that employment has not fallen due to the introduction of a nationwide minimum wage<lb/> (OECD, 2004), and was also not affected by the increase in minimum wage during the recent economic<lb/> and financial crisis (<ref type="biblio">Bryan et al., 2012</ref>).<lb/> 26.<lb/> Currently, a minimum wage can be set for individual sectors, which has been done in several<lb/> cases in Germany, mostly on the basis of extending collectively bargained wages. Two procedures exist to<lb/> set a sector specific minimum wage (see Box 4). The extension of collective wage agreements incurs the<lb/> risk of harming employment prospects of &quot; outsiders &quot; . For instance, legal extension of sectoral wage<lb/> agreements can reduce incentives of social partners to set wages low enough for unemployed to have a<lb/> reasonable chance of finding a job, as no employer can compete by reducing costs with a lower wage.<lb/></p>

			<head>Box 4. Procedures to set sector specific minimum wages<lb/></head>

			<p>There are two main procedures to implement a sector-specific minimum wage.<lb/> If (1) a minimum of 50% of employees are covered by collective agreements and (2) there is a public interest, a<lb/> collective agreement can be declared as generally binding for all employees in the region and sector. To introduce<lb/> such a sectoral and regional minimum wage, employers&apos; associations and trade unions of the sector have to file a joint<lb/> application for legal extension with the Federal Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs, specifying the agreed minimum<lb/> wage. Once accepted by the Federal Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs, the agreement is binding for all employees<lb/> and employers in the sector. If the government of a Land contests a proposal for legal extension, consent by the<lb/> federal government is needed.<lb/> If less than 50% of all employees in a sector are employed by employers who are bound by collective<lb/> agreements a permanent council can propose a sectoral minimum wage. The permanent council consists of two<lb/> representatives of employers of the sectors concerned, two representatives of labour unions of the sectors concerned<lb/> and three representatives from the Federal Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs. Alternatively, an expert commission,<lb/> composed of three representatives of employers and three from labour unions, and, optionally, experts without voting<lb/> rights, can propose a minimum wage, which can be introduced by the federal government.<lb/> Sectoral minimum wages are in place in several branches and occupations: construction and related crafts,<lb/> (safety services, cleaning services, long-term care, vocational education and further training services and waste<lb/> management). A minimum wage also exists for temporary agency workers. Sectoral minimum wages in Germany<lb/> varied between EUR 7.50 per hour and EUR 13.70 per hour in 2013. Many of these minimum wages vary across<lb/> regions.<lb/></p>

			<head>Raising</head>

			<p>wages via the legal extension of collective wage agreements may also be a way for incumbents to<lb/> prevent the entry of firms and thereby thwart competition and employment. Moreover, sectoral minimum<lb/> wages can be circumvented by outsourcing activity to firms in other sectors or to the self-employed, which<lb/> are then more likely to generate precarious job conditions. These substitution efforts will reduce in-house<lb/> training activities and further contribute to the risks of a dual labour market (OECD, 2008a, 2006 and<lb/> 2012g). An extensive evaluation study commissioned by the German Ministry of Labour in 2011 covering<lb/> all sectors with minimum wages failed to find any substantial negative effects on employment and market<lb/> entry in the sectors concerned. However, employment losses may have resulted due to indirect effects on<lb/> other sectors (van Suntum, 2014).<lb/> 27.<lb/> The government plans to phase in a general minimum wage of EUR 8.50 between 2015 and the<lb/> end of 2016 and to create a commission to propose future adjustments of the general minimum wage. The<lb/> members of the commission will be nominated by social partners, with the possibility to consult<lb/> independent experts, who will have no voting power. Sectoral minimum wages above the general<lb/> minimum wage will continue to apply and the government plans to make it easier to legally extend<lb/> collectively bargained sectoral minimum wages above the general minimum wage. At present, several of<lb/> these sectoral minimum wages are higher than EUR 8.50.<lb/> 28.<lb/> The government&apos;s plans to introduce a general minimum wage are welcome. However it should<lb/> be ensured that the initial level does not entail considerable negative employment effects. A minimum<lb/> wage of EUR 8.50 would amount to about half of the median wage, placing the German minimum wage at<lb/> a level similar to those of other European countries, such as Belgium and the Netherlands, but below<lb/> France. It would affect about 15% of employees nation-wide and more than 23% in Eastern Germany. It<lb/> may harm the employment prospects of workers in some regions and with little experience or low skills<lb/> (<ref type="biblio">Brenke, 2014</ref>). A useful strategy would be to introduce the minimum wage at a lower level and make<lb/> adjustments in the light of its impact, as was done in the United Kingdom. The mandate of the expert<lb/> commission should be to set the minimum wage at a level which balances potential employment losses<lb/> against the social benefits. The social partners alone may not sufficiently take the interests of the<lb/> unemployed into account. It could therefore be desirable to involve independent experts or government<lb/> representatives in the commission&apos;s decisions. Moreover, given the introduction of the nationwide<lb/> minimum wage, cautious use should be made of higher sectoral minimum wages set on the basis of<lb/> collective agreements.<lb/></p>

			<head>Active labour market policies and in-work benefits could be improved<lb/></head>

			<p>29.<lb/> Total spending on ALMPs is relatively high (<ref type="figure">Figure 9</ref>) and spending per unemployed has<lb/> increased by almost 50% since 2007. Spending increased particularly for training and integrating the<lb/> disabled, in line with recommendations in the 2012 Economic Survey of Germany. However, spending per<lb/> unemployed on public employment services increased sharply as well and is now unusually high. While in<lb/> many cases ALMPs are found to be counterproductive, i.e. rather extending the time of unemployment<lb/> (<ref type="biblio">Federal Government, 2006</ref>), placement services and hiring subsidies are found to be particularly effective<lb/> in the short-term, whereas instruments aiming at improving education outcomes take more time to unfold<lb/> their effects but are considered to be more beneficial in the long-term (Kluve, 2013).<lb/></p>

			<figure>Figure 9. Spending on labour market programmes¹<lb/> USD thousands at PPP per unemployed person,</figure>

			<p>30.<lb/> Many ALMPs benefit mostly those with a comparatively strong socio-economic background<lb/> within their respective target groups. Vouchers -including for education and private job placement<lb/> services -as well as hiring subsidies are more often taken up and actually used by individuals with a<lb/> comparatively strong socio-economic background. Self-selection effects within target groups may persist,<lb/> in part because better educated individuals are often better informed and less discouraged (<ref type="biblio">Heyer et al.,<lb/> 2011</ref>).<lb/> 31.<lb/> Hiring subsidies (Eingliederungszuschuss), which are considered to be effective in bringing long-<lb/>term unemployed and migrants back to work, could be targeted more towards the neediest (<ref type="biblio">Butschek and<lb/> Walter, 2013; Heyer et al., 2011</ref>). For example hiring subsidies could become more generous for the most<lb/> disadvantaged individuals with the longest unemployment spells. Hiring subsidies could be accompanied<lb/> to a larger extent by incentives to achieve higher general education to ensure a lasting integration of<lb/> disadvantaged individuals in the labour market and increase income mobility (Kluve, 2013).<lb/> 32.<lb/> Steps have been taken to raise the incentives of public employment service offices to direct<lb/> efforts more towards bringing the most disadvantaged individuals into work in 2014, including the<lb/> long-term unemployed and low skilled. These steps are welcome. However, continued assistance and<lb/> guidance following placement, during the initial period in work, is also needed to ensure lasting integration<lb/> into the labour market. Also incentives of providers of private job placement services should be reviewed,<lb/> as these vouchers benefit mostly job searchers with relatively high employability (<ref type="biblio">Heyer et al., 2011</ref>).<lb/> 33.<lb/> There is scope to further review in-work benefits to ensure that the most vulnerable receive<lb/> sufficient support while minimising disincentives to work. For instance, means-tested subsistence benefits<lb/> are currently phased out as earnings rise above EUR 100. While the phasing out is already slower for<lb/> families with children, the benefits could be phased out more slowly for particularly vulnerable<lb/> individuals, such as single parents (<ref type="biblio">Meister, 2009</ref>). Child benefits paid to parents receiving a housing<lb/> allowance could also be phased out more slowly to remove disincentives to work. Currently they are<lb/> discontinued abruptly at a certain income level.<lb/></p>

			<figure>ECO/WKP(2014)71<lb/> The education system could provide more support for the disadvantaged<lb/> 34.<lb/> PISA results in Germany have improved in all three PISA domains and are now above the OECD<lb/> average. These improvements</figure>

			<p>were mostly due to better results among students coming from a lower<lb/> socio-economic or immigrant background (OECD, 2013i and 2014). However, the link between<lb/> socioeconomic background and mathematics performance remains strong compared to the OECD average<lb/> and immigrants remain more disadvantaged than nationals (<ref type="figure">Figure 10</ref>). A strong link between socio-<lb/>economic background and learning outcomes undermines employment prospects and income mobility of<lb/> the most vulnerable.<lb/></p>

			<head>Reviewing system level policies<lb/></head>

			<p>35.<lb/> Further reforms are needed to improve learning outcomes and facilitate access to upper<lb/> secondary and tertiary education among disadvantaged youth. Performance variation between schools is<lb/> relatively large, reflecting in large part stratification of the school system (OECD, 2012c) and a high share<lb/> of disadvantaged students going to disadvantaged schools (OECD, 2013i). Efforts should be made to<lb/> continue to reduce stratification of the school system as recommended in the 2008 Economic Survey of<lb/> Germany. Also, grade repetition, which is particularly widespread in Germany, should be reduced. It<lb/> widens inequity, increases the likelihood of dropping out and does not improve education outcomes<lb/> (OECD, 2012c). Moreover, grade repetition raises total expenditure on primary and secondary education<lb/> by 7%. Moreover, efforts should continue to remove financial barriers to access to tertiary education. The<lb/> main federal means-tested student support scheme provides grants and loans with income contingent<lb/> repayments of up to EUR 8 040 per year for needy students. However, consideration should be given to<lb/> raising the maximum amount of support and to making all loan repayments contingent. While an additional<lb/> preferential student loan scheme provides loans of up to EUR 7 200 per year, their repayment is not<lb/> contingent on income.<lb/> 36.<lb/> A relatively large share of pupils with learning difficulties is separated from the mainstream and<lb/> placed in classes or schools for children with learning difficulties or disabilities (<ref type="figure">Figure 11</ref>, top panel;<lb/> OECD, 2012c). Pupils are more likely to be assigned to such special needs schools if their socio-economic<lb/> background is disadvantaged. For example, children with migrant background are overrepresented in<lb/> special needs schools. Also, the share of pupils in special needs schools varies considerably across Länder<lb/> (<ref type="figure">Figure 11</ref>, bottom panel). Assignment of pupils to special needs schools undermines their career prospects<lb/> early on, as many of them leave school without having completed even lower secondary education.<lb/> Instead, integrating children with learning difficulties in mainstream classes and schools raises their<lb/> education outcomes and is less costly (OECD, 2009). In this context, the initiative by the Länder to<lb/> promote integrated education is welcome (<ref type="biblio">Kultusministerkonferenz, 2010</ref>). A coherent strategy should be<lb/> developed for integrated education across Länder, limiting assignment of children to separate special needs<lb/> education, and avoiding that children with disadvantaged socio-economic background are assigned to them<lb/> on account of their weak socio-economic status.<lb/></p>

			<p>37.<lb/> Most young people who do not obtain at least upper secondary education face a high risk of<lb/> unemployment or, if in employment, low wages (OECD, 2013b). In Germany, 10.6% of youth aged 18-24<lb/> have at most lower secondary education and are not in education or training, many of them with migrant<lb/> background, according to Eurostat; about 8% do not complete lower secondary education. While special<lb/> training measures exist to integrate these youth into vocational education and training (VET), they are<lb/> often not successful. Around 260 000 youth (26 % of all youth entering VET per year) attended special<lb/> training programmes in 2012 (Federal Statistical Office of <ref type="biblio">Germany, 2014</ref>). Half of them are expected to<lb/> not successfully complete formal VET (<ref type="biblio">Authoring Group Educational Reporting, 2013; Klemm, 2012</ref>).<lb/> Against this backdrop greater efforts are needed to help early school leavers to achieve at least upper<lb/> secondary education. Guaranteeing direct access to VET to all school leavers, an idea also spelled out in<lb/> the 2013 coalition agreement, would require additional resources of about EUR 1.5 billion per year,<lb/> according to Klemm (2012). However, this cost is likely to be partially recovered through higher tax<lb/> revenues in the long-term. To achieve this goal, existing training programmes need to be tailored more<lb/> towards bringing youth quickly into mainstream VET programmes in close cooperation with private<lb/> companies (<ref type="biblio">Plicht, 2010</ref>). The federal government and governments of the Länder are setting up a<lb/> programme (education chains) to streamline the existing initiatives in vocational orientation and to<lb/> strengthen the transition from school into mainstream VET. In 2013 the Länder jointly made proposals to<lb/> improve school-based training programs in the transition system. Some of these policies to make economic<lb/> growth more socially inclusive also require additional public funding.<lb/> 38.<lb/> Efforts should also continue to raise the employability of older workers and immigrants. Lifelong<lb/> learning can help to improve employability among experienced workers, thereby reducing poverty risks as<lb/> suggested in the 2012 Economic Survey of Germany. Specialisation early on should be avoided as older<lb/> workers, who face a high risk of long-term unemployment (<ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref>), are particularly vulnerable to<lb/> structural changes. Despite recent reforms, difficulties in the recognition of professional and vocational<lb/> qualifications obtained abroad hold back earnings prospects of immigrants. The Federal Recognition Act,<lb/> in force since April 2012, has proved effective. The first data show that in most cases the equivalence of<lb/> foreign professional qualifications was established and the recognition was granted. However, differences<lb/> continue to exist in the recognition of foreign credentials across Länder. This limits the capacity of<lb/> immigrants to move to locations where their skills are in highest demand (OECD, 2013e). The recognition<lb/> of professional and vocational qualifications should be furthered facilitated, as planned by the government,<lb/> and harmonized across Länder.<lb/></p>

			<head>Providing more targeted support to disadvantaged pupils<lb/></head>

			<p>39.<lb/> The share of public spending on compulsory schooling directed to children of low-income<lb/> families is lower than in most other OECD countries (<ref type="biblio">Verbist et al., 2012</ref>). As in many OECD countries,<lb/> there is scope to provide more financial resources to schools with a comparatively high share of pupils with<lb/> weak socio-economic background (OECD, 2012c). For instance, considerable differences exist in spending<lb/> per pupil across school tracks with spending per pupil being lower in middle schools (Realschule) than in<lb/> high schools (Gymnasium). Also modern secondary schools (Hauptschulen) have difficulties in attracting<lb/> qualified teachers (<ref type="biblio">Authoring Group Educational Reporting, 2013</ref>), indicating that their employment<lb/> conditions need to be improved. More financial and career incentives should be provided to attract and<lb/> retain high quality teachers and leaders in schools attended by disadvantaged children also with regard to<lb/> the large share of older teachers currently on active duty (OECD, 2014). It should be ensured that teachers<lb/> earn the same across different school tracks. To address learning gaps and avoid grade repetition, which is<lb/> relatively high, it should be ensured that an adequate environment for learning is made available to the<lb/> most disadvantaged children, including for counselling, mentoring and smoothing transitions between the<lb/> different levels of education (OECD, 2012c).<lb/> 40.<lb/> To further increase the benefits of existing early childhood education and care additional<lb/> resources should be made available: to increase the staff-child ratio; to provide more integrated education<lb/> and care; and to ensure early childhood professionals (e.g. educators, pedagogues, etc.) have better<lb/> qualifications, more professional development opportunities and better working conditions, as planned by<lb/> the government (OECD, 2012e; Federal Ministry for Labour and Social <ref type="biblio">Affairs, 2013</ref>). The Länder have<lb/> developed a competence-oriented qualification profile for childcare workers in order to enhance and<lb/> harmonize the quality of training programmes (<ref type="biblio">Kultusministerkonferenz, 2011</ref>) and have made efforts to<lb/> establish training courses at tertiary level. In the short term, however shortages of qualified staff need to be<lb/> addressed.<lb/> 41.<lb/> The education package (Bildungspaket) is an initiative by the federal government to help children<lb/> from poor households to participate in social activities and receive learning support. However, it may fail<lb/> to reach the most vulnerable, despite means-testing, because of self-selection (<ref type="biblio">Krug and Popp, 2008</ref>).<lb/> Disadvantaged parents, including those with migrant background, are less likely to be aware of education<lb/> support programmes for their children (<ref type="biblio">Apel and Engels, 2012</ref>) and they tend to underestimate the long-<lb/>term benefits of such activities. Therefore, continued effort is needed to ensure that the neediest children<lb/> benefit from the programme, for example by continuing to tailor information and assistance towards these<lb/> families. It should also be ensured that more funds are allocated to tutoring of disadvantaged children to<lb/> improve their learning outcomes. Currently, this is only possible if a teacher certifies that a child is at risk<lb/> of repeating a school year. Only 4% of children from families receiving subsistence payments or housing<lb/> subsidies receive such support (<ref type="biblio">Apel and Engels, 2012</ref>). Providing more funding for tutoring to<lb/> disadvantaged children independently of whether they are at risk of repeating a school year could help<lb/> them to perform better at school, which might encourage them to aim for higher education later on.<lb/></p>

			<head>Reforming health insurance to tackle inequalities<lb/></head>

			<p>42.<lb/> The segmentation of health insurance into a private sector, which covers about 10% of the<lb/> population, and a public sector, which covers the remaining 90% (Box 5) raises efficiency concerns<lb/> (OECD, 2008b; German Council of Economic <ref type="biblio">Experts, 2006</ref>). Low and middle income earners and<lb/> individuals with poorer health status are generally covered by public health insurance, where contributions<lb/> are independent of health risks and proportional to wage income up to a ceiling. Employees with a wage<lb/> income above EUR 53 550 per year can opt out of public insurance and choose private insurance instead.<lb/> High income earners with good health status have incentives to choose private insurance because insurance<lb/> premia do not depend on income and because private insurers can adjust the terms of contracts they offer<lb/> to new insurees in line with their perceived health risks. Moreover, private insurers do not participate in the<lb/> central health fund, which redistributes insurance contributions of public insurers on the basis of risk-<lb/>adjusted transfers. The central health fund helps to avoid selection on the basis of risk (Box 3.5; OECD,<lb/> 2008b). Private insurers can therefore compete on the basis of risk selection rather than on the basis of<lb/> efficiency. Moreover, competition within the private insurance sector is de facto limited to attracting new<lb/> entrants to the private system. New insurees can be selected on the basis of risk in most contracts, making<lb/> individuals reluctant to switch, for example, after facing chronic conditions. Moreover, switching between<lb/> private insurance providers is costly due to the restricted portability of ageing reserves (Box 5).<lb/> 43.<lb/> Private insurance can also result in poverty risks for some individuals when they experience a<lb/> drop in income. These risks affect older workers, because insurance premia tend to increase with age and<lb/> because they cannot return to the public insurance system. They also affect the self-employed, who do not<lb/> generally have access to public insurance and may face high income uncertainty. It is therefore possible<lb/> that the current health insurance system discourages risk-averse workers from becoming self-employed,<lb/> especially if their business plans imply uncertain income prospects, as may particularly be the case for<lb/> innovative start-ups. While special tariffs have to be provided by private health insurance companies for<lb/> individuals who have difficulties in paying, they can be fairly expensive or provide only limited coverage<lb/> (Box 5; Federal Ministry of <ref type="biblio">Health, 2013a</ref>). While the dual health insurance system in Germany has a long<lb/> tradition, it generates difficulties in today&apos;s labour market, in which employment histories often include<lb/> changes in employment status and earnings.<lb/></p>

			<table>ECO/WKP(2014)71<lb/> 44.<lb/> The German Council of Economic Experts (2006) and the 2008 OECD Economic Survey of<lb/></table>

			<p>Germany therefore suggested integrating private health insurance providers in the central health fund. The<lb/> German Council of Economic Experts also suggested imposing the obligation to contract on all insurers<lb/> and limiting the cost of mandatory health insurance for low-income households with government transfers.<lb/> This would imply that all insurance companies provide mandatory health insurance packages to all<lb/> individuals on equal terms, as public insurance companies already do. Such a reform would remove<lb/> incentives for risk selection and reduce poverty risks. However, it would give rise to substantial transitory<lb/> challenges. In particular, it requires dealing with the reserves accumulated in the private health insurance<lb/> system.<lb/> 45.<lb/> While the introduction of the central health fund (see Box 5) has raised efficiency and<lb/> transparency, it should be developed further (<ref type="biblio">Drösler et al., 2011</ref>). As only a limited number of 80 diseases<lb/> are considered to determine risk-adjusted transfers, public health insurance companies continue to have<lb/></p>

			<head>Box 5. The German health insurance system<lb/></head>

			<p>Healthcare coverage is provided through a mix of public health insurance, which covers about 90% of the<lb/> population, and private health insurance for eligible individuals who opted out of the public system, including many civil<lb/> servants.<lb/> Public health insurance: Employees with gross yearly earnings currently below EUR 53 550 must be insured in<lb/> the public health insurance system. Non-profit public insurers are funded mostly via the central health fund, which<lb/> collects 15.5% of labour income from all insured (14.6 percentage points are equally shared by employer and<lb/> employee and 0.9 percentage points are paid by the employee alone) and then distributes funds to insurers as risk-<lb/>adjusted transfers. Individual insurers compete mainly via additional lump-sum surcharges which they can levy on their<lb/> clients (up to a limit of 2% of the income of the insured individual). The federal government contributed 7.4% to the<lb/> central health fund&apos;s revenues in 2012 (Federal Ministry of Health, 2013a). Non-working spouses and children up to a<lb/> certain age are insured at no extra cost if they have no income above EUR 395 (or EUR 450 out of a minijob). Public<lb/> insurers are subject to the obligation to accept every individual fulfilling the criteria for access to the public scheme and<lb/> wishing to conclude a contract with them and cannot vary premia according to individual risk. The 2013 coalition<lb/> agreement stipulates abolishing the lump sum surcharges which can be levied by individual insurers, replacing them<lb/> by income dependent surcharges to be paid by the employee.<lb/></p>

			<p>Private health insurance: Employees with gross yearly earnings currently exceeding EUR 53 550 can opt out of<lb/> the public health insurance scheme. The self-employed must insure themselves in the private sector unless they were<lb/> insured in the public sector before becoming self-employed, in which case they can choose between public and private<lb/> insurance. Civil servants are reimbursed 50% of their healthcare costs by their employers if they take out private<lb/> insurance. Premia do not depend on income and, in general, insurers can charge higher fees to new clients depending<lb/> on their perceived health risks. Private health insurance companies are obliged to build up old age reserves for their<lb/> clients, which are in principle portable if switching between private health insurance providers (<ref type="biblio">Commonwealth Fund,<lb/> 2012</ref>). However, switching between private insurance providers is costly because the scope of portable ageing<lb/> reserves is restricted to that of the basic tariff and to insurees who joined private health insurance after 2008.<lb/> Therefore, in practice competition among private health insurance companies is limited to attracting new entrants to<lb/> the private system.<lb/></p>

			<p>Private insurers are obliged to offer special tariffs for individuals having difficulties in paying for their health<lb/> insurance. The basic and the standard tariff provide coverage comparable to the one of public insurance, but these<lb/> tariffs cost up to EUR 610 per month in 2013 regardless of income. Income support is provided by the government only<lb/> if the privately insured&apos;s income risks falling below the subsistence threshold. For individuals who fall behind with their<lb/> contribution payments, an emergency tariff (Notlagentarif) was introduced in 2013 with a premium not higher than<lb/> EUR 125. However, it provides considerably less coverage than public insurance (Federal Ministry of Health, 2013b).<lb/> The transition from private health insurance back to public health insurance is only possible under certain, narrow<lb/> circumstances. Employees whose income falls below the income threshold can switch to the public system if they are<lb/> less than 55 years old. In principle switching is not possible for the self-employed.<lb/> incentives to discriminate against clients with diseases not included in the adjustment, for example<lb/> including some forms of mental ill health. Despite an obligation to contract, public insurance companies<lb/> can influence their client structure to some extent, for instance by advertising their services to selected<lb/> groups. Therefore, the current risk-adjustment should be reviewed and include a larger number of diseases.<lb/> 46.<lb/> Unlike in other countries with central health funds, the treatment costs of deceased individuals<lb/> are not annualized when determining disease specific transfers. For higher age groups and diseases with<lb/> high death tolls costs are systematically underestimated and thus transfers from the central health fund too<lb/> low (<ref type="biblio">Buchner et al., 2012</ref>). It should be ensured that risk-adjusted transfers are set high enough for clients<lb/> with cost-intensive diseases characterized by high morbidity as also spelled out in the 2013 coalition<lb/> agreement.<lb/></p>

			<head>Limiting the risk of rising old age poverty<lb/></head>

			<p>47.<lb/> Although old age poverty is not a major concern in Germany today, this is expected to change as<lb/> population ageing and past pension reforms will reduce the level of pensions in the public system relative<lb/> to income earned during active life (German Council of Economic Experts, 2013). Net pension<lb/> replacement rates for future retirees are among the lowest across OECD countries, especially for workers<lb/> earning half the average wage and retiring after a full career (OECD, 2013h). One reason is that pension<lb/> claims are more closely related to income than in most other OECD countries. In this context, the rise of<lb/> low pay-jobs, low wage mobility and emerging labour market dualisation aggravate risks of old-age<lb/> poverty. Helping workers to acquire sufficient pension claims over their working life by improving<lb/> earnings prospects of workers subject to low-pay and part-time work is the best way to tackle the risk of<lb/> old age poverty. In this context labour market reforms to boost permanent full-time employment as<lb/> outlined above are particularly helpful.<lb/> 48.<lb/> The 2013 coalition agreement includes several measures to extend pension claims for selected<lb/> groups. Workers with a contribution record of at least 45 years will be able to retire with a full pension at<lb/> age 63 initially, rising to 65 years, in line with the increase of the standard legal pension age from 65 to<lb/> 67 years. If implemented, they provide an incentive to retire earlier. Pension top-ups will also be paid to<lb/> mothers whose children were born before 1992 and invalidity pensions will be raised. In the medium term,<lb/> these measures will be funded by payroll contributions, which are projected to be 0.4 percentage points<lb/> higher as a result of the planned measures by 2030. There are also plans to implement a minimum pension<lb/> for people with a contribution record of at least 40 years and low pension entitlements at a later stage. The<lb/> plans are not specifically targeted at addressing old-age poverty, which could become a problem in decades<lb/> to come, and thus may generate more spending pressures in the future. If pension entitlements for workers<lb/> with a low earnings record are deemed too low, a cost effective way of raising incomes for pensioners with<lb/> low entitlements while safeguarding incentives to work would be to phase out means-tested subsistence<lb/> benefits more slowly as pension entitlements rise.<lb/> 49.<lb/> The mandatory public pension system generally covers employees only. Only about one quarter<lb/> of the self-employed, mainly in professional services, are covered by alternative mandatory pension<lb/> schemes (German Council of Economic Experts, 2011). The remaining self-employed workers, often<lb/> including the most vulnerable, are not covered (German Council of Economic <ref type="biblio">Experts, 2013</ref>). They may<lb/> not sufficiently price in future pension requirements to offer their goods and services at a low price. This<lb/> creates a coverage gap raising the risk that self-employed workers have to rely on social assistance benefits<lb/> during retirement. Firms have incentives to outsource work to these self-employed workers at low cost in<lb/> order to avoid pension contributions, raising precarious self-employment and weakening government<lb/> finances. Against this backdrop, all self-employed should be included in the mandatory public pension<lb/> scheme.<lb/></p>

			<head>Making the tax system more inclusive<lb/></head>

			<p>50.<lb/> The labour tax wedge is high in international comparison, including for low income families and<lb/> single parents (<ref type="table">Table 4</ref>). While income tax rates are low, especially for families with children, social<lb/> security contributions are high.<lb/></p>

			<p>51.<lb/> Lowering social security contributions, notably for low income workers with full-time earnings,<lb/> should be a priority. Such a step should be placed in the context of a broader reform to make the tax system<lb/> more conducive to economic growth. In particular this involves continued efforts to reduce the tax burden<lb/> on labour income, especially for workers on low pay. Such a reform should also include measures on the<lb/> expenditure side of the social security system. More revenues could be raised from taxes on consumption,<lb/> real estate and environmentally harmful behaviour, as suggested in the 2012 Economic Survey of Germany.<lb/> 52.<lb/> Some sources of capital income benefit from preferential tax treatment. Households&apos; capital<lb/> income (interest payments, dividends) is generally taxed at a rate of 26.4% at the household level, although<lb/> households&apos; interest income benefits from a tax-free allowance up to EUR 801. The general tax rate for<lb/> capital income is, in many cases, below the marginal income tax households pay on their other income, as<lb/> capital income is particularly concentrated among high-income households. These reduced tax rates have<lb/> in the past helped to reduce tax evasion through capital flight. However, efforts have been made to improve<lb/> international cooperation to prevent tax fraud. A moderate increase in capital income taxation may<lb/> therefore not lead to more tax evasion (<ref type="biblio">Bach and Beznoska, 2012b</ref>). Consideration should be given to align<lb/> the taxation of capital income to the taxation of other personal income. Moreover, households are fully<lb/> exempt from capital gains tax on housing property, held for more than 10 years, even if the owner does not<lb/> live in the dwelling concerned. This tax exemption risks biasing investment decision towards residential<lb/> housing, especially in the current low interest rate environment which may encourage expectations of<lb/> rising prices and benefits high-wealth households the most (<ref type="biblio">Frick and Grabka, 2009; Deutsche<lb/> Bundesbank, 2013; European Central Bank, 2013</ref>). Realised capital gains on housing should be taxed,<lb/> except for owner-occupied housing.<lb/> 53.<lb/> Inheritance taxes have less distortionary effects and entail a lower administrative burden than<lb/> other forms of taxation of wealth (<ref type="biblio">Bach and Beznoska, 2012a</ref>). There is scope to further increase revenues<lb/> from inheritance taxes by removing exemptions. Wealth held in small and medium sized enterprises is<lb/> ECO/WKP(2014)71<lb/> subject to lower inheritance taxation than other forms of wealth under certain conditions. Households<lb/> therefore have incentives to transform private into business property to lower their tax burden (<ref type="biblio">Bach and<lb/> Beznoska, 2012b</ref>). The conditions for such transformations have recently been tightened. The remaining<lb/> tax advantages provided to small firms in inheritance taxation should be reconsidered. To avoid liquidity<lb/> problems for businesses subject to inheritance tax, tax payments can already be stretched over ten years.<lb/> During this period, the tax liability could be subordinated to other claims on the business (see e.g. the 2004<lb/> Economic Survey of Germany).<lb/></p>

			<head>Regional pockets of poverty risk could be addressed more effectively<lb/></head>

			<p>54.<lb/> Although dispersion of GDP per capita across Länder continued to decline over the past decade<lb/> and is now lower in Germany than in most other EU countries, the risk of relative poverty has risen to a<lb/> considerably higher level in East than in West Germany and continues to diverge (<ref type="biblio">Grabka et al., 2012</ref>).<lb/> 55.<lb/> The current revenue-sharing system including fiscal federal transfers is based on population as<lb/> well as on multipliers which only reflect differences in population density (<ref type="biblio">Söllner, 2001</ref>). Although,<lb/> additional discretionary transfers exist, in part to account for differences in long-term unemployment rates,<lb/> they do not take into account additional socioeconomic and demographic characteristics, such as migrant<lb/> status, or age composition, in the population structure across the Länder, which contribute to different<lb/> levels of demand for public services provided by Länder and municipalities on their territory (<ref type="biblio">Feld et al.,<lb/> 2013; Heinemann, 2012</ref>). It should be considered to enlarge the set of criteria based on which transfers are<lb/> provided, e.g. by including differences in age composition, socio-economic or migrant background. The<lb/> advantage of including such demographic indicators in the determination of fiscal federal transfers is that<lb/> they can help align such transfers with demand for social services more effectively without harming<lb/> incentives of the poorest jurisdictions to strengthen their growth potential (<ref type="biblio">Joumard and Kongsrud, 2003</ref>).<lb/> 56.<lb/> Subnational government levels may also face disincentives to provide adequate provision for key<lb/> services that can help to boost inclusive economic growth. For example, municipalities may not fully take<lb/> into account the benefits provided by childcare facilities and early childhood education, for which they<lb/> have funding responsibilities, because they partly accrue to neighbouring jurisdictions or even nation-wide.<lb/> Special grants from state to local governments are available to address such externalities. However they are<lb/> provided on a discretionary basis with rules (for local grants) differing considerably across the Länder<lb/> (<ref type="biblio">Dombert, 2006</ref>). The government should consider assuming funding responsibilities for key social<lb/> services provided by subnational governments subject to geographic externalities, which are particularly<lb/> important for inclusive growth. For example, the federal government could finance vouchers for families<lb/> with young children which they could use to pay for the services of accredited childcare facilities.<lb/></p>

			<figure>Box 6. Recommendations to foster inclusive growth<lb/> Labour market<lb/></figure>

			<p> Continue to expand early childcare provision, notably for full-day care. Ensure equal access of the most<lb/> vulnerable to affordable high-quality childcare independently of their place of residence and socio-economic<lb/> background. Extend the supply of all-day schools.<lb/>  Reduce the gap in employment protection between permanent and temporary workers by reducing<lb/> protection of permanent workers and by limiting the use of multiple successive fixed term contracts with the<lb/> same employee.<lb/></p>

			<head></head>

			<figure>Introduce a general minimum wage at a sufficiently low level that will not lead to job losses, determined by<lb/> an expert commission. Cautious use should be made of higher sectoral minimum wages set on the basis of<lb/> collective agreements.<lb/>  Target the preferential tax treatment of minijobs towards low-wage workers.<lb/></figure>

			<p> Make active labour market policies more targeted by monitoring self-selection problems within target<lb/> groups. Continue to review in-work benefits to ensure that the most vulnerable receive sufficient support<lb/> while minimising disincentives to work. For instance, phase out more slowly means-tested subsistence<lb/> benefits for particularly vulnerable individuals earning more than EUR 100. Also phase out additional child<lb/> benefits paid to parents receiving a housing allowance more slowly.<lb/></p>

			<head>Education<lb/>  Reduce stratification</head>

			<p>of the school system and provide more financial resources to schools with a<lb/> comparatively high share of pupils with weak socio-economic background. Reduce grade repetitions.<lb/> Provide more support for disadvantaged youth to complete formal upper secondary education programmes,<lb/> in particular mainstream VET. Continue reducing the assignment of pupils to special needs schools and<lb/> make sure assignment to such schools does not reflect the socio-economic background of pupils.<lb/>  Improve the quality of early childhood education and care, including by improving the staff-child ratio in<lb/> accredited facilities; by better integrating education and care; and by ensuring early childhood professionals<lb/> have better qualifications, more professional development opportunities and better working conditions.<lb/></p>

			<head>Tax and transfer system<lb/></head>

			<p> Extend compulsory pensions to the self-employed.<lb/></p>

			<head></head>

			<figure>Focus additional pension entitlements on reducing future old age poverty risks, for example, by phasing out<lb/> subsistence benefit entitlements more slowly as pension entitlements rise.<lb/>  Fund such additional spending from general tax revenue instead of higher payroll taxes. Strengthen<lb/> incentives to retire later.<lb/>  Extend capital gains taxes on residential real estate except for owner-occupied housing. Raise the tax rates<lb/> applying to household capital income towards marginal income tax rates applying to other household<lb/> income.<lb/></figure>

			<p> Equalize the inheritance tax burden for different forms of wealth.<lb/></p>

			<p> Further improve the determination of risk-adjusted transfers within the health fund, by considering a larger<lb/> number of diseases and by ensuring that transfers for higher age groups and diseases with high death tolls<lb/> are high enough.</p>
