			<head>MAIN POINTS<lb/></head>

			<p>This report examines recent developments regarding the use of fibre to provide local access networks<lb/> (referred to inter alia as the last mile or local loop) for the provision of broadband access. Countries across<lb/> the OECD are adopting different approaches to stimulate investment and to define the terms of competition<lb/> to end-users in a Fibre to the Home/Building (FTTH/B) world.<lb/></p>

			<p>There is no simple solution to the question of how to get FTTH/B networks built. The issues boil<lb/> down to having as much physical access competition as economically efficient, which in turn drives<lb/> investment and ultimately better deals for consumers both pre and post fibre deployment. The adoption of<lb/> FTTH/B solutions is normally preceded by strong broadband take-up. Broadband take-up is normally best<lb/> in competitive, dynamic markets with multiple fixed network competitors. Competition on the access<lb/> network is a key requirement to facilitate choice for consumers at the retail level when there is a single<lb/> Next Generation Networks (NGN) fibre access provider. Where there is more than one NGN fibre<lb/> provider, unbundling may have a role to play, but the case may be less compelling and more complicated.<lb/> Once FTTH/B is deployed, ensuring take-up, usage, innovation and consumer outcomes all benefit<lb/> from more competitive end-user markets. It can be observed from the data that there is a wide divergence<lb/> in take-up rates where fibre is deployed. Competition has consistently delivered better consumer outcomes<lb/> in terms of price and innovation and this in turn improves take-up rates. Higher take-up rates are also very<lb/> good for investors as this appears to be a key variable in determining the return period, even more so than<lb/> prices.<lb/> For those countries which do not have sufficient network competition and rely on unbundling of<lb/> existing networks, issues arise concerning how best to provide competitive access to the physical fibre and<lb/> these are related to the fibre topology. Two main topologies exist, point-to-point (PtP) or point-to-<lb/>multipoint (PtMP). In a PtP context the existing access regime can normally continue. Entrants can build<lb/> their own network utilising the incumbent&apos;s economies of scale (by renting the fibre loops, as they can<lb/> with copper today). In the event that a sufficient number of end-to-end network competitors exist, this<lb/> again does not raise an issue since competition does not depend on access. However, in the event that there<lb/> is not a sufficient number of network competitors and that competition requires access conditions on a<lb/> network, then a PtMP model presents challenges in the form of access that can be offered. Physical<lb/> unbundling does not appear to be a realistic option in most instances and virtual access products appear to<lb/> be preferable. Countries which have limited access competition today and do not have the prospect for<lb/> physical access competition in the future should ensure that such virtual access products are planned for,<lb/> and that they are the best available, so that competition to provide services to the end-user can continue.<lb/> In general end-to-end network competition is preferable to other forms of competition since<lb/> competitors compete over the entire value chain or access provision. Parallel networks may exist<lb/> independently of each other or they may be created by renting loops. One network can be shared by several<lb/> physical network access operators. This can reduce inefficient network duplication costs whilst still<lb/> allowing the benefits of economies of scale to be available to the market.<lb/> Countries can take measures to lower deployment costs by giving access to existing passive<lb/> infrastructures, streamlining building permits and ensuring co-ordination of investments, all of which<lb/> should lower entry barriers.<lb/> While competition can drive FTTH/B in certain settings, it is unlikely to deliver FTTH/B universally<lb/> due to the very high costs associated with the &quot; last mile&apos; investments. Where population densities are low,<lb/> a viable business case will be especially challenging. This implies that subsequent government intervention<lb/> will be needed to deliver FTTH/B outside commercially viable areas. Significant positive externalities can<lb/> justify such interventions. However, it is important that public interventions do not interfere with or indeed<lb/> forestall private investment. Countries that clearly specify when and where they will intervene with public<lb/> finance can minimise these risks.<lb/></p>

			<head>Fibre-to-the-Home (FTTH) deployment and strategies<lb/> Introduction<lb/></head>

			<p>Fibre has long been used for telecommunication networks. Since the mid-1980s it has been the<lb/> technology of choice for new backbone networks for both telecommunication and cable television<lb/> networks. More recently it has also been used to provide the final connections to some premises, first for<lb/> larger business users and now for some residential users.<lb/></p>

			<p>The transition from copper access to fibre access networks is a source of great upheaval in the ICT<lb/> sector. It poses a series of challenges to industry and regulators to achieve the transition with positive<lb/> long-term results for consumers and society generally. This paper aims to update recent developments in<lb/> this area across OECD countries. It should be noted that the transition from copper to fibre is barely<lb/> underway in most of the World and though some countries are already making significant progress. The<lb/> drivers of investment in these new networks are multiple and it is not always possible to identify and<lb/> manage those drivers to achieve specific outcomes. However, this report seeks to examine the progress<lb/> made to date within the OECD and to look at what lessons might be drawn from that experience.<lb/></p>

			<p>Though many specific challenges arise, the report seeks to look most carefully at two. The first<lb/> challenge, for policy makers, is to choose amongst the different approaches to encourage investments in<lb/> FTTH/B. These range from regulatory forbearance in the United States for instance, with the decision not<lb/> to extend competitive access products for third parties to fibre-based products, to an actively managed<lb/> competitive access regime in Japan. It can be observed that markets which have demonstrated the greatest<lb/> level of access competition on traditional broadband networks such as xDSL and cable television networks,<lb/> have not only delivered very good results to consumers but also seem to be leading the charge in terms of<lb/> FTTH/B investments.<lb/> This is a crucial observation because the competition on today&apos;s networks may drive itself onto<lb/> tomorrow&apos;s, ensuring not only that the networks are built but also that consumers are in a position to<lb/> exploit their potential benefits. It is also the case that take-up rates will be crucial to lower payback<lb/> periods, and indeed, to ultimately allow the existing copper networks to be switched off -to the benefit of<lb/> investors, consumers and society at large.<lb/></p>

			<p>The second related challenge facing policy makers is how to ensure that adequate competition is<lb/> maintained on the FTTH/B networks once they are built. Two main deployment topologies are being used,<lb/> Point-to-Point (PtP) and Point-to-Multipoint (PtMP). It is beyond the scope of this report to make an<lb/> assessment of the merits of the different topologies. Each topology has advantages and disadvantages and<lb/> OECD countries have in general given investing entities the freedom to choose their own preferred<lb/> topology. It is a fact, however, that the competitive physical access options today are much more limited<lb/> when a PtMP topology is deployed. It may be that this assessment will change as technologies develop and<lb/> improve. However, the competitive access limitations on a PtMP network may limit the scope of future<lb/> competition and this is a challenge which must be carefully assessed by policy makers.<lb/></p>

			<p>This paper is organised as follows: first a review of where FTTH/B networks are being built is set out.<lb/> Then the drivers of investment and the deployment profiles are identified. The report looks at the sources<lb/> of funding and major investment projects currently pending. It also consider the types of networks being<lb/> deployed, whether PtP or PtMP and considers the implications for competitive access solutions. Finally,<lb/> some conclusions are synthesised into a number of policy suggestions.<lb/></p>

			<head>Defining FTTH/B<lb/></head>

			<p>For the purposes of this study Fibre-to-the Home (FTTH) and Fibre-to-the-Building (FTTB) are<lb/> classified together as FTTH/B.<lb/> While it should be noted that, at the time of writing there are also two other network solutions<lb/> competing for customers and in places being installed – Fibre-to-the-Curb (FTTC) and Cable -these are<lb/> not the subject of this report (although cable&apos;s role as a driver of competitive effects is remarked upon).<lb/> In terms of network topologies (rather than technologies), the reader should be aware that there are<lb/> two main options. The first option, Point-to-Point (PtP), looks relatively similar to the existing copper<lb/> network topology insofar as each consumer has a dedicated fibre. The second topology is<lb/> Point-to-Multipoint (PtMP) where a portion of the access network is shared amongst a number of users.<lb/> See Annex 1 for a more detailed description of these items.<lb/></p>

			<head>Where FTTH networks are being built<lb/></head>

			<p>A distinction needs to be drawn between where networks are actually being built as opposed to being<lb/> planned. A number of countries and operators with minimal deployments today are planning very<lb/> extensive deployments in the immediate future.<lb/></p>

			<p>An assessment of actual deployment today suggests that, with some notable exceptions, FTTH/B<lb/> deployments are still tentative or at an early stage. The exceptions are Korea and Japan who have achieved<lb/> extensive FTTH/B deployments. The data suggests that there are no &quot;rules&quot; regarding who deploys what<lb/> kind of network -new entrants are deploying PtMP networks, new government-owned corporations<lb/> building networks are opting for PtMP, some incumbent operators are deploying PtP networks. Even<lb/> though there are no easy classifications possible, it can be observed that there is a clear preference for<lb/> PtMP networks amongst incumbents and that, in general, entrants have opted for PtP deployments.<lb/> An initial review of deployments to date gives the following data set out in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> below. <ref type="table">Table 1<lb/></ref> seeks to give a broad overview of the current state of play in FTTH roll-out across OECD countries.<lb/></p>

			<head>Investment funding and deployment profiles<lb/></head>

			<p>The Asia Pacific is the region where the most advanced</p>

			<figure>FTTH/B deployments have been made.<lb/> Reviewing the history of countries such as Japan and Korea can be instructive in terms of identifying<lb/> investment drivers.<lb/> In September 2000, the Japanese government directed Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, the<lb/> incumbent operator, to unbundle its copper local loop. In 2004, partial unbundling rates were JPY 120<lb/> (USD 1.50) per month and JPY 1,300 (USD 16) per month for total unbundling.<lb/> Softbank, a major Japanese ISP, launched its DSL service in 2001 &quot;Yahoo! BB&quot; and invested heavily<lb/> in DSL technology. When SoftBank started its (12 Mbit/s) ADSL service at a price of around JPY 3000<lb/> USD 30) it made a huge impact in the Japanese market. The price proposed by Softbank was<lb/> approximately half the prevailing price in the market and, coupled with aggressive marketing campaigns,<lb/> led to Softbank capturing a large share of the market such that, by 2003, it was already the largest DSL<lb/> operator, even ahead of the traditional incumbent. Competitors and Softbank each dropped prices in an<lb/> iterative fashion and repeatedly offered higher speed services to entice customers with offers that quickly<lb/> ran from12 Mbit/s to 24 Mbit/s and 50 Mbit/s.<lb/> In 2004, 52.1% of Japanese households had Internet access, with more than half of these using<lb/> broadband. By March 2005, DSL had more than 13.6 million customers in Japan and the development of<lb/> FTTH became part of the competitive landscape with the arrival of operators like TEPCO (Tokyo Electric<lb/> Power Company), allied to KDDI and NTT. Three million customers were wired with FTTH in March<lb/> 2005 and by 2007 it had overtaken DSL in Japan.<lb/> As noted by Cave (2010) and Ida (2009) regarding Japan, it was the competition in the supply of<lb/> xDSL (driven by low unbundling charges) which was then followed by competition in capacity that<lb/> ultimately drove fibre deployment. This allowed high fibre penetration rates to be established without<lb/> government subsidies, which were largely confined to taking high speed broadband into rural areas.<lb/></figure>

			<p>Therefore it can be observed that in Japan, the primary driver of deployment was market based<lb/> competition on the access network and that finance was privately sourced. A second step in deployment<lb/> was driven by government as concerns regarding a digital divide emerged.</p>

			<head>The Next Generation<lb/> Broadband Concept 2010 published in 2005 by the Japanese Ministry of Internal Affairs and<lb/></head>

			<p>Communications (MIC) in Japan, identified two important steps, first, to ensure that every municipality in<lb/> Japan had broadband access by 2008 and second hat with respect to FTTH networks, over 90% of Japanese<lb/> homes had access to access networks capable of &apos;upload speeds in excess of 30 Mbps&apos; by 2010. This is<lb/> implicitly a significantly higher target than specifying a download speed and effectively excludes at a<lb/> minimum FTTC and Wireless solutions from the plan. As noted in <ref type="table">Table 2</ref> above, the competitive process<lb/> behind deployment seems to have also ensured a significant take-up rate with regard to the FTTH/B that<lb/> has been deployed.<lb/> The Korean Government was also very proactive in terms of ensuring first broadband and then<lb/> FTTH/B developments. In 2003 the government published the Broadband IT Korea Vision 2007 and after<lb/> the successful rollout of the broadband network, the government set out its goal for the future broadband<lb/> policy in the so-called u-Korea Masterplan (2007).<lb/></p>

			<figure>The development of the Korean fibre optic network can also be divided into two stages. The first,<lb/> starting in 2004, included the extension of the fibre network without focusing on the direct connection of<lb/> households to the new network. Development in this period was driven by policy decisions. In 2003, the<lb/> Ministry of Information and Communication (MIC) amended the Facility Sharing Directive. For fibre<lb/> optics deployed before 2004</figure>

			<p>, the MIC imposed obligations on Korea Telecom (KT) to open its fibre optics<lb/> to alternative operators, with regulated wholesale charges set by the MIC. For KT, fibre optics deployed<lb/> after 2004, the MIC did not impose any regulations on KT (cf. <ref type="biblio">Twist, 2007</ref>). Regulatory forbearance was<lb/> also applied for the fibre deployed by other operators. Many operators started to roll out their own fibre<lb/> optic networks after this decision. For all broadband networks (copper-and cable-based), the MIC had an<lb/> &quot; open access &quot; regulation in place. In contrast to most other economies, which have only unbundled the<lb/> local loop, Korea went one step further by also unbundling the cable loop. This early competitive access<lb/> policy on broadband networks resulted in fierce competition among service providers (<ref type="biblio">ITU, 2005</ref>). Again,<lb/> public finance followed in the wake of this competitive process.<lb/></p>

			<figure>In the 2003 Triennial Review Order (TRO) the United States found that &quot; excessive network<lb/> unbundling requirements tend to undermine the incentives of both incumbent LECs and new entrants to<lb/> invest in new facilities and deploy new technology. &quot; 2 The Federal Communications Commission (FCC)<lb/> found in the TRO that competitive access was not appropriate for most fiber loops used to serve enterprise<lb/> and mass market customers, and reinforced that finding in 2004. 3<lb/> On 20 March 2006, Verizon&apos;s petition for forbearance from dominant carrier regulation of high-<lb/>capacity broadband services – fiber circuits used to serve enterprise customers and as inputs by competitive<lb/> carriers – was &quot; deemed granted &quot; by operation of law. 4 The FCC granted comparable forbearance relief to<lb/> AT&amp;T 5 , Qwest 6 , and Embarq and Frontier 7 in subsequent orders in 2007, stating that &quot; [f]orbearance in<lb/> these circumstances also will increase [their] incentives to invest in advanced network technologies that<lb/> will enable it to provide enterprise customers with increasingly innovative services. &quot; 8<lb/> Clearly, significant progress in terms of investment and homes passed has been achieved, as shown in<lb/> Figure 2 below, and the regulatory action in the United States was accompanied by a significant period of<lb/> investment where cable and telecom networks competed directly. It should be noted, again by reference to<lb/> Table 2 above, that despite the levels of FTTH/B deployment noted in the United States, take-up rates lag<lb/> someway behind leaders in the OECD though, as noted by IDATE (2010) &quot;The United States, Canada and<lb/> Mexico have connected 27% more users with fibre than all of the countries in West, Central and Eastern<lb/> Europe combined&quot;. On the other hand, performance in terms of fibre access investment in the United States<lb/> is greater than in Canada and Mexico and these countries also have limited or no third-party access via<lb/> policies such as unbundling, and it is difficult to assess the effects of the global economic crisis on<lb/> demand.<lb/></figure>

			<p>At the same time, Hong Kong, China, a location with some of the most competitive broadband offers<lb/> in the world, relies almost wholly on network competition. In the OECD, Korea has been very successful<lb/> with end-to-end network competition. Geographic and demographic factors are clearly important in Korea,<lb/> Hong Kong, China and China – with high population densities -the proclivity of apartment-style<lb/> residential properties have no doubt been key factors. In these countries encouraging apartment buildings<lb/> to have &quot; points of access &quot; to which any provider can connect, have further encouraged competition.<lb/></p>

			<figure>Figure 2:United States FTTH/B homes passed<lb/> Source: RVA and FTTH Council North America.<lb/></figure>

			<p>In 2010, the effectiveness of forbearance of regulation in the United States as a driver of investment is<lb/> under renewed scrutiny. A study carried out by the Berkman Center, reviewing experience around the<lb/> world, suggested that competitive access regimes outside the United States have led to better price/quality<lb/> outcomes which may go some way towards explaining the relative under-performance of FTTH/B take-<lb/>up</p>

			<head>. 9<lb/></head>

			<p>In the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 10 , the United States Congress directed the<lb/> FCC &quot; … to ensure that all people of the United States have access to broadband capability and <ref type="biblio">[to]<lb/></ref> establish benchmarks for meeting that goal. &quot; In support of that goal, they tasked the FCC with i) evaluating<lb/> the status of deployment, ii) analysing the most effective mechanisms for achieving broadband<lb/> access, iii) developing a strategy to ensure affordability and maximum utilisation of broadband<lb/> access, and iv) providing a plan whereby broadband would further consumer welfare, civic participation,<lb/> public safety, homeland security, health care delivery, energy independence, education, and a host of other<lb/> public policy goals.<lb/> The FCC published the National Broadband Plan (NBP) in 2010. Through it, the United States<lb/> government has made a forward-looking statement of its long-range plans and has earmarked a level of<lb/> finance to encourage more marginal investments, as noted in <ref type="table">Table 3</ref> below.<lb/> In Europe similar considerations were given to the possibility of using regulatory forebearance as a<lb/> means to accelerate investment. The Dutch Regulator, OPTA, took the lead in this debate since it was<lb/> faced with a similar market situation to that prevailing in the United States -widely deployed (and<lb/> technologically advanced) cable networks competing directly with a traditional telecoms incumbent. In that<lb/> market, a decision was taken to forsake bitstream access for the mass market and to oblige entrant<lb/> operators to build competing networks based on Unbundling of the Local Loop (ULL) for access. ULL is<lb/> well developed in the Netherlands and as the incumbent operator signalled its intention to redesign its<lb/> network, OPTA took a considered view on regulatory forbearance. The resulting policy paper, &quot;Is two<lb/> enough&quot;, concluded: &quot; On balance the conclusion of the assessment is that in the relevant scenario there<lb/> is a significant risk that competition is not effective. &quot;<lb/></p>

			<figure>More generally in the European Union, the &quot;Europe 2020 Strategy&quot; was launched in March 2010 with<lb/> the aim of preparing Europe&apos;s economy for the next decade. In May 2010 the Commission published its<lb/> Digital Agenda element which detailed how ICT would contribute to the overall EU2020 Strategy vision<lb/> through the creation of advanced networks. Seven target areas are specified, including the need to increase<lb/> Europeans&apos; access to fast and ultra fast Internet. The target set in these policy documents is for Europe to<lb/> achieve Internet speeds of 30 Mbps or above for 100% of European citizens, with 50% or more of<lb/> European households subscribing to connections of 100Mbps or higher.<lb/></figure>

			<p>The European Commission believes it can attract investment in broadband through better and more<lb/> consistent regulation and through more operational measures such as credit enhancement mechanisms and<lb/> guidance on how to encourage investments in fibre-based networks. The vehicles to achieve these aims are<lb/> the &quot;Next Generation Access (NGA) Recommendation&quot; and the &quot;Broadband Communication&quot;.<lb/> In September 2010, the European Union published the Commission Recommendation on regulated<lb/> access to NGA networks which seeks to guide National Regulatory Authorities (NRAs) as to what are the<lb/> appropriate remedies to be imposed for NGA Networks. This is a non-binding Recommendation based on<lb/> Article 19 11 of the Better Regulation Directive. NRAs must &quot;take utmost account of&quot; these guidelines<lb/> when selecting remedies as part of their analysis of Markets 4 and 5. 12<lb/></p>

			<p>As noted elsewhere (<ref type="biblio">Cave and Shortall, 2010</ref>) preservation of competition is the European<lb/> Commission&apos;s preferred approach and access in the form of fibre unbundling and/or active access is<lb/> proposed to continue as previously. Any suggestion of regulatory forbearance in <ref type="biblio">Europe</ref> has been soundly<lb/> dismissed. Access conditions on fibre based networks will include risk premiums to entice investment.<lb/> The Recommendation also puts significant emphasis on remedies which are aimed at lowering<lb/> deployment costs such as granting access to passive infrastructures. Also in September 2010, the European<lb/> Commission published its Communication &quot;European Broadband: investing in digitally driven growth&quot;.<lb/> As part of that Communication the Commission committed itself to make a proposal, in co-operation<lb/> with the European Investment Bank (EIB) in 2011:<lb/> • For broadband financing.<lb/> • To issue guidance for local and regional authorities on the use of European Union funds for<lb/> broadband project design and preparation.<lb/> • To adopt investment guidelines on broadband for local and regional authorities to facilitate full<lb/> absorption of European Union funds.<lb/> The European Commission also committed itself to:<lb/> • Complete a review of cost-reduction practices [for NGA deployment] by 2012.<lb/> • Reinforce and rationalise the use of funding of high-speed broadband through European Union<lb/> instruments under the current financial framework (e.g. the European Regional Development Fund<lb/> (ERDF), the Eastern Recovery Development Programme (ERDP), the European Agricultural Fund<lb/> for Rural Development (EAFRD), the Trans-European Networks (TEN) and the Competitiveness<lb/> and Innovation Framework Programme (CIP) by end 2013.<lb/> In turn, the European Commission asks that its Member States:<lb/> • Set national broadband targets and adopt operational plans that are in line with the European<lb/> broadband target; the European Commission will review the national plans in 2011,<lb/> • Take national actions to reduce broadband investment costs.<lb/></figure>

			<p>Taken as a whole, the European public policy position is seeking to ensure that NGA and especially<lb/> FTTH are facilitated by lowering deployment costs, making finance available and co-ordinating<lb/> information and operators. However, while the reliance in Europe on competitive dynamics in the market<lb/> to be the main driver of FTTH/B deployment remains, there is renewed emphasis now on the need for<lb/> publicly funded investment beyond areas where competition is viable.<lb/> It is also clear within Europe that those countries that are making the most progress are precisely those<lb/> countries where physical access based competition is strongest.<lb/> <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref> below shows the retail share of broadband of alternative providers. In Europe different<lb/> access products are available as a means of delivering services to end users, with those access products<lb/> being on a scale between bitstream and full ULL. <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref> below shows the number of broadband lines<lb/> based on full ULL. Full ULL allows an entrant to build its own network by buying the economies of scale<lb/> available to the incumbent (by renting local loops at cost). Where entrants enjoy a high share of the retail<lb/> market and that share is principally based on full ULL, it is fair to conclude that that represents situations<lb/> where access competition is strongest, subject to two caveats. The first concerns the presence of cable<lb/> networks which tends to be stronger in Northern Europe and weaker in the South. The second concerns<lb/> Eastern Europe where self supply (new network construction) is often preferred, facilitated by lighter<lb/> planning requirements.<lb/></p>

			<p>Taken together therefore, and looking at rates close to or above 50% for both entrant share and share<lb/> based on ULL, these elements would suggest that competition is strongest in Portugal, France,<lb/> Netherlands, Germany and Italy. With the exception of Germany and Sweden this correlates closely with<lb/> those countries where the most active FTTH/FTTB deployments may be observed. The Swedish exception<lb/> might reasonably be explained by the high proportion of local/regional initiatives observed in that country,<lb/> while the quality of the traditional German copper network might explain its relative underperformance in<lb/> FTTH/B investments to date.<lb/> Therefore, in the European Union it can be observed that the greater the level of physical access<lb/> competition on today&apos;s networks, the stronger the investment dynamic in those markets for FTTH/B.<lb/></p>

			<head>Financing the FTTH Networks<lb/></head>

			<p>In addition to privately driven investment, many publicly funded interventions in the OECD<lb/> (underway or planned) are intended to accelerate broadband, including FTTH deployments. <ref type="table">Table 3</ref> below<lb/> seeks to capture the largest of those national projects.<lb/></p>

			<p>Many of these initiatives are seeking to use public finance as a catalyst for private sector investment<lb/> in more marginal areas. Portugal represents a good example of such a project where the regulator has<lb/> divided the country into two regions, competitive and non-competitive. Currently, in the competitive<lb/> region operators will have regulated access to civil engineering (passive) infrastructure and the main<lb/> operators are obliged to deploy their own networks. In the non-competitive areas, where there is currently<lb/> no other basic broadband infrastructure than the network of the incumbent operator, the State is seeking to<lb/> accelerate a single NGN shared infrastructure open to all operators, through a series of tenders. In the<lb/> remaining non-competitive areas, regulated unbundled fibre access and fibre bitstream access are options<lb/> that might be imposed by the regulator following market analysis.<lb/> The Australian investment is the most ambitious public intervention in the OECD, with the Australian<lb/> Federal Government&apos;s plan to build a National Broadband Network (NBN) with fibre-to-the-premises<lb/> (FTTP) technologies delivering broadband to 93% of homes with an investment of up to USD 43 billion.<lb/> In most OECD countries, private-led investment is the main vehicle for achieving a transition from<lb/> copper-based networks to networks which are primarily FTTH/B.<lb/></p>

			<p>In addition to government-level interventions a great many local investments are taking place, often<lb/> by energy utilities with large infrastructural project experience, sometimes with and sometimes without<lb/> public financial support. One striking feature of FTTH/B deployments is the observation that a large<lb/> number of local initiatives of different shapes and sizes where consumers, although willing to pay for<lb/> FTTH access, cannot elicit supply through traditional means. Since their demand is not being met in the<lb/> market, consumers are obliged to revert to a model which seeks supply from non-traditional sources. Two<lb/> such examples, one in Sweden and one in the United States, are described below.<lb/></p>

			<head>Mälarenergi Stadsnät -Västerås, Sweden<lb/></head>

			<p>In 2000, the city of Västerås in Sweden, with a population of 130 000, decided to build an open-access fiber optic<lb/> network. The city tasked its power utility, Mälarenergi, with the responsibility of building and operating the network.<lb/> Mälarenergi, in turn, created a subsidiary: Mälarenergi Stadsnät (The &quot; Malar Energy City Network &quot; ) or MSN. The<lb/> financing of local access was a shared responsibility with the home owners involved. The price of access was set at<lb/> USD 3 900 for an SDU, while MDU prices were set at USD 429, reflecting the different costs involved. The topology is<lb/> PtP and the network was sold as an open-access network which any service provider could then contract directly with<lb/> end users. Benefits identified to end users included: increased home valuations, radically improved service quality and<lb/> competitive prices for ongoing services. In practice, for users taking telephony and a 100Mbs broadband connection<lb/> service the estimated return on investment was as little as 4 years.<lb/></p>

			<head>Utopia Network, Utah, United States<lb/></head>

			<p>A similar initiative in the United States concerns an attempt by 16 Utah cities to provide FTTH infrastructure to their<lb/> residents. The local power utility has been used as the vechicle to roll-out and manage the infrastructure. Residents<lb/> pay for the local access connection through payments added to their utility bills, spread over a number of instalments.<lb/> Recently, public funding through the American Reinvestment and Recovery Act was allocated in order to allow<lb/> connection of nearly 400 schools, libraries, medical and healthcare providers, public safety entities, community college<lb/> locations, government offices and other important community institutions in sections of Perry, Payson, Midvale,<lb/> Murray, Centerville, Layton, Orem, and West Valley City. In turn, the extended reach of the network will give more<lb/> private residents the option to connect to the extended network.<lb/></p>

			<p>As noted earlier, Sweden has shown that that these small initiatives can scale-up with perhaps as<lb/> much as 40% of Swedish deployments falling into such a category. The European Commission for its part<lb/> believes that Europe can scale-up local initiatives with the support of public finance and publicly funded<lb/> investment mechanisms such as the EIB. 14<lb/></p>

			<head>The topologies of the FTTH/B networks being deployed<lb/></head>

			<p>The topology of deployment has a determinative impact on the form of competitive access that can be<lb/> achieved on FTTH/B networks. In terms of physical access remedies that could be imposed on a FTTH/B<lb/> network, only PtP deployments have the possibility to give physically unbundled access equivalent to the<lb/> kind historically available over the copper network.<lb/> In general end-to-end network competition is preferable to other forms of competition since<lb/> competitors compete over the entire value chain or access provision. End to end network operators enjoy<lb/> technical independence in all aspects of service provision, which is not a feature of virtual access solutions.<lb/> While parallel networks may exist independently of each other, they may also be created by renting loops.<lb/> One network can be shared by several physical network access operators and this can reduce inefficient<lb/> network duplication costs whilst still allowing the benefits of economies of scale to be available to the<lb/> market. Hence, many public policy makers that do not have sufficient existing network competitors to<lb/> ensure competitive retail conditions express a preference for PtP where it is feasible. Wavelength Division<lb/> Multiplexing (WDM) solutions have the possibility to deliver the benefits of a PtP access network over a<lb/> PtMP access network but they are mostly unproven and lack scale in the access network for the moment.<lb/> For PtMP topologies, the currently available access remedies are more limited. While in theory, and<lb/> indeed in practical deployment terms, it is possible to deploy multiple PtMP networks simultaneously<lb/> which would be managed by alternative operators, it is not obvious what incentives exist for such an<lb/> approach.<lb/> It is more likely that access remedies will need to be based on different forms of virtual access, either<lb/> forms of &apos;bitstream&apos; access or more advanced access products based on wavelength unbundling. These<lb/> access options are considered further in the following section of this report.<lb/></p>

			<p>An assessment of <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> above indicates that 20 countries have PtP as the main topology, 11 with<lb/> PtMP and 1 which can only be classified as a mixture. In practice only 9 (4 PtMP and 5 PtP) of the 32<lb/> countries have opted for one or other technology, whilst the other countries have opted for a mixture.<lb/></p>

			<p>It should also be noted that the current picture may be distorted to some extent by the stage of network<lb/> development. As noted already, Europe lags some way behind other regions in terms of network<lb/> deployment for a variety of reasons. The early stage of FTTH\B deployment in Europe and indeed in<lb/> Australasia suggests that the currently identified topology may change in the not-too-distant future. A good<lb/> case in point is the United Kingdom where, to date, network deployment has been carried out mainly on<lb/> the basis of local initiatives and localised commercial deployments 15 . However, BT in the United Kingdom<lb/> has indicated that it will deploy 4 million FTTH/B lines in the coming years and that the topology will be<lb/> PtMP 16 . Such a deployment is likely to dwarf any other deployment in terms of size.<lb/></p>

			<p>Similarly, Deutsche Telekom in Germany has announced its intention to deploy FTTH to 4 million<lb/> homes by 2012 and in Italy, a consortium of alternative operators have announced plans to deploy a further<lb/> (PtP) FTTH network in the principle 15 Italian cities or to about 4 million homes, also reinforcing the<lb/> existing deployment model. Telecom Italia at the same time has proposed a mixed PtMP and FTTN<lb/> deployment to about 50% of Italian homes at a cost of USD 11.8 billion so the final deployment mode<lb/> remains uncertain.<lb/></p>

			<p>There is, therefore, considerable uncertainty particularly given the early stage of FTTH deployments<lb/> in Europe so that the European market could change quite radically in the coming years. Within Europe,<lb/> PtMP has increased from 15% to 17% 17 of all deployments and as incumbents, who to date have expressed<lb/> a strong preference for PtMP deployment topologies, commence deployment, the share of PtMP can be<lb/> expected to accelerate rapidly.<lb/> It should be noted from the above that there is no strict correlation between topology and the nature<lb/> of the party deploying, which suggests that other factors are driving the commercial decision regarding<lb/> deployment technology. Each topology has advantages and disadvantages and countries have in general<lb/> given investing entities the freedom to choose their own preferred topology.<lb/></p>

In general, PtP is more future proof but PtMP is often<lb/> cheaper 19 to install and run. In areas with low population densities, where overhead network deployment is<lb/> often a feature, these cost differences can be even more pronounced. Competitive access products are<lb/> better on a PtP network and future network management can be achieved under more competitive<lb/> conditions. The incremental costs of choosing between building PtMP and PtP vary but seem to range<lb/> between 5% and 15% while the additional cost of deploying multiple PtMP networks simultaneously<lb/> seems to be in the same range 20 .<lb/> Nevertheless, it is a fact that the competitive access options today are much more limited when a<lb/> PtMP topology is deployed. This assessment may change as technologies develop and improve. The<lb/> various access options and practices are discussed in more detail in the following section.<lb/></p>

			<head>Accommodating competitive access<lb/> Regulatory responses<lb/></head>

			<p>In the European Union a series of documents released in 2010 have sought to clarify the mode of<lb/> regulation for fibre and to outline, or request Member States of the European Union to outline, their<lb/> broadband plans for reaching certain predefined targets. In particular, the Recommendation on NGA seeks<lb/> to clarify the terms for private investors investing in fibre-based networks in Europe. That document seeks<lb/> to smooth the transition from copper to fibre based networks. In relation to existing copper network based<lb/> competitors, the Recommendation sets out the migration regime and sets minimum conditions for<lb/> migration from copper-based wholesale products to fibre ones.<lb/> The umbrella Body of European Regulators of Electronic Communications of the European Union<lb/> (BEREC), an advisory body to the European Commission, conducted a comprehensive survey of the<lb/> access products available in a FTTH/B context. As part of that exercise, a simplified and stylised ladder of<lb/> investment for NGA products was identified which is depicted in <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref> below, some of these elements<lb/> may be merged together or further split, depending upon a national solution, therefore a concentration<lb/> point can be the same as a cabinet:<lb/></p>

			<figure>Figure 5: NGA ladder of investment<lb/> Source: BEREC : BoR (10) 08 BEREC Report on NGA wholesale products.<lb/></figure>

			<p>The architecture of a fibre network differs from that of a copper one. Current generation broadband in<lb/> Europe, as elsewhere, is often supplied by competitors who have built out to the incumbent&apos;s local<lb/> exchange, where they rent local loops. That point may disappear in a fibre network, being replaced with<lb/> different exchange points in a PtP network, while in a PtMP network unbundling the fibre loop in a manner<lb/> similar to unbundling copper loops is difficult or impossible. Regulators need to devise strategies which<lb/> will permit the transition of competition on FTTH/B networks to go ahead.<lb/></p>

			<p>In a PtP network, it is possible to unbundle the network in more or less the same fashion as on a<lb/> copper network. Some issues have arisen about how large an optical distribution frame (ODF) needs to be<lb/> in order to credibly be able to host one or more competitors. Certain national regulators 21 have specified<lb/> minimum criteria in respect of ODF size and guidance may also be proffered regarding the location of<lb/> access points.<lb/> In Japan and the Netherlands fibre loop unbundling regimes are in place. In Europe, while PtP is the<lb/> dominant deployment technology to date, it is frequently deployed by entrant operators rather than the<lb/> (normally) dominant incumbent implying that access obligations will not arise.<lb/></p>

			<p>In the United States unbundling decisions and regulatory forbearance have generally eliminated<lb/> regulated access to fibre and in Korea regulatory forbearance for fibre investments exists since 2004.<lb/> As noted already, incumbent operators are opting more and more for PtMP-type topologies. They are<lb/> not alone and while some entrants 22 have opted for PtMP deployments so too has the Australian<lb/> Government. In general, therefore, a very significant proportion of access obligations within the OECD<lb/> will be based on PtMP networks. Since physical unbundling is virtually impossible on such networks,<lb/> regulators need to consider the scope for virtual access remedies to replace physical unbundling.<lb/> Regarding PtMP networks, two broad types of virtual access products can be identified. The first is<lb/> wavelength unbundling -often referred to as &quot;wave division multiplexing (WDM)&quot;. As its name suggests,<lb/> WDM involved splitting the lightwave into its constituent colours (with many shades of primary colours<lb/> being possible). Once split, the individual wavelengths can then be allocated to different services or<lb/> operators. In this sense lightwave unbundling could allow multiple operators full control of a wavelength<lb/> without access to the physical fibre. From a technical independence perspective, this form of unbundling is<lb/> likely to give access seekers a degree of independence comparable to physical unbundling.<lb/> WDM in the fibre access loop is a technology which is established but has not been standardised and<lb/> perhaps more tellingly, has not reached any level of scale economies. In its assessment of the various<lb/> technical options for FTTH roll-out in the United Kingdom. 23 Analysys Mason found that WDM had the<lb/> least favourable economic profile of the different deployment options. There remains uncertainty about<lb/> how significant scale economies for active network components will be in the future for WDM, but if<lb/> significant, these results could change.<lb/> In 2010, WDM usage is very limited but it holds out the exciting prospect of technical independence<lb/> for access seekers on a single infrastructure and the ability to take access relatively high in the network<lb/> (i.e. further away from the end-user). This should allow viable entry with larger numbers of addressable<lb/> consumers at access points. The possibility is that once WDM technology matures, light-wave unbundling<lb/> may be functionally equivalent to physical unbundling holds out the best future hope for competitive<lb/> access seekers on PtMP networks. It may be that networks built with a PtMP topology might be more, or<lb/> less, capable of upgrading to a network which can support a WDM solution 24 .<lb/></p>

			<p>The second main access product that can be envisioned on PtMP network topologies is a<lb/> bitstream-type access product. Ofcom in the United Kingdom has required 25 a bitstream product Virtual<lb/> Unbundled Local Access (VULA) provide access seekers a wholesale product that allows a degree of<lb/> control similar to that achieved in local loop unbundling as physical access is not possible. RTR in Austria<lb/> made a comparable proposal more or less at the same time 26 . While both proposals raised comments from<lb/> the European Commission about the need to move to unbundling as soon as the technology enabling fibre<lb/> unbundling is available, both were considered appropriate as transitory measures. Regulators need to<lb/> ensure that by introducing virtual solutions due to the limitations for physical competition, they do not<lb/> become embedded in the regulatory approach rather than be transitory arrangements. Otherwise, with a<lb/> move to fibre, the entrant community may face a step (or half-step) back down the &quot;ladder of<lb/> investment&quot;&apos; 27 where they have built out their own networks on the basis of ULL but will be forced to<lb/> move back along the value chain and accept bitstream and bitstream variants in the future.<lb/></p>

			<head>Market developments<lb/></head>

			<p>In choosing the appropriate form of regulation, there are trade-offs at two levels. The first level<lb/> concerns choosing between network duplication costs and dynamic efficiency. If the access market is<lb/> viewed from a static perspective, building multiple networks increases the costs of delivery significantly.<lb/> The additional costs incurred can be viewed as costly and inefficient where each network delivers the same<lb/> basic services.<lb/> From a more dynamic perspective, multiple networks will compete vigorously with each other and<lb/> will ensure that any inefficiency is competed away on the individual networks and that innovation will be<lb/> important as network operators seek to differentiate themselves from each other.<lb/></p>

			<p>In the past, the costs of duplicating copper-based networks, or PSTN, were so high that considerations<lb/> of dynamic efficiency rarely arose. However, since the topology of copper networks was universally PtP,<lb/> in practice the efficiencies of building a single network single network build and the benefits of multiple<lb/> competing networks, could be achieved simultaneously (through ULL). With technological evolution and<lb/> convergence, cable networks also found themselves competing with traditional PSTN -and with the<lb/> evolution of DSL, the PSTN could in turn compete with cable networks. Where competition is strongest<lb/> between platforms and within platforms, product innovation and take up have been markedly better than<lb/> where limited or no access competition has existed.<lb/></p>

			<p>Where PtMP topologies are deployed the more optimum solution of sharing a single build network to<lb/> achieve multiple competing end-to-end networks is not generally cost effective today. Therefore policy<lb/> makers require a view of how large the costs of deployment will be (and can they be made smaller) and<lb/> how large the benefits of dynamic efficiency will be. By facilitating the sharing of passive infrastructures<lb/> and the co-ordination of investments where appropriate, policy makers can lower replication costs and<lb/> encourage infrastructure-based competition and investment. There is significantly more scope for end-to-<lb/>end competition emerging in a FTTH/B context than existed in a copper world. However, achieving such a<lb/> competitive roll-out is not obvious.<lb/> Allowing access to passive infrastructure and sharing certain network elements (such as in-building<lb/> wiring) can greatly facilitate entry. Co-ordinating and facilitating co-operative roll-outs can also<lb/> significantly enhance the possibilities for end-to-end competition.<lb/> However, it is clear that investment incentives are also coloured by the alternative access regimes.<lb/> Most European regulators that have fibre deployments have signalled that regulated bitstream products are<lb/> either not available over the new infrastructure 28 or such availability is limited at least for the moment, so<lb/> as to preserve entrants&apos; incentives to invest (particularly when facing a PtMP deployment). Those<lb/> regulators that judge the scope for infrastructure based competition to be very limited have opted to try and<lb/> develop bitstream products ahead of time 29 . Policy makers therefore seek to protect competition in the<lb/> market but in doing so must take a forward-looking view on the market developments and make trade-offs<lb/> on access products where necessary. The appropriate policy response is further complicated by the fact<lb/> that, even under optimal conditions, competitive roll-outs are likely to be relatively limited in their<lb/> geographic scope and indeed, many countries have to deal with less than optimal conditions. The<lb/> implication therefore is that some virtual access products will be needed in order to avoid re-<lb/>monopolisation of significant parts of the market. Therefore geographic limitation of remedies is becoming<lb/> more prominent over time.<lb/> In countries where a PtP deployment is taking place, that singular infrastructure allows many<lb/> operators to build their own networks by renting the fibre loops and adding their own network elements. In<lb/> countries where a PtMP topology is being deployed this option is not available and the choice will be<lb/> between multiple parallel networks and competition based on virtual remedies. Unless there is a credible<lb/> threat of alternative, competing investments, the incentives for incumbent operators to move first are weak.<lb/> This in turn suggests that, absent competitive pressure, incumbents may choose to delay the<lb/> installation of fibre even when investment in a fibre network has a positive expected net present value as<lb/> compared with maintaining the copper network in place. This is because delaying the fibre until<lb/> uncertainties about execution, demand and regulation are removed has an option value to the investor from<lb/> which it has to be bought out for the investment to go ahead.<lb/> In order to restore incentives, regulators could commit to access pricing policies which encourage<lb/> investment by competitors. A problem with such an approach is that the pricing of wholesale products can<lb/> change quickly and that regulators have often reneged on commitments to withdraw access products or<lb/> worsen the terms on which they are available. 30 Often, a more fundamental problem arises when<lb/> competitors on the market do not hold a sufficient scale to make large scale investments credible. Strong<lb/> competitors on today&apos;s networks give policy makers greater opportunities in terms of stimulating an<lb/> investment dynamic.<lb/> From a demand perspective, service development, innovation and above all pricing of fibre-based<lb/> access products are likely to be critical to take-up. A number of market analysts have identified the take-up<lb/> rate of fibre as being of far greater importance than the prices charged when assessing payback periods.<lb/> The relationships between prices, take-up and payback periods are non-linear, i.e. a percentage increase in<lb/> take-up rates leads to a several percentage points decrease in price (holding the payback period constant).<lb/> <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref> below from Yankee Group depicts their assessment of the relationship between prices, take-<lb/>up rates and the time needed for investment payback. This suggests that ensuring a competitive<lb/> environment is not only the best way of justifying the investments but is also likely to drive outcomes of<lb/> lower prices and higher take-up beneficial to consumers, ensuring shorter payback periods for investors.<lb/></p>

			<p>Therefore, an access model which seeks to ensure cheaper access rates is likely to see higher take-up<lb/> which becomes self sustaining. A higher take-up not only facilitates a more rapid transition to FTTH/B but<lb/> also the retirement of the copper network.<lb/></p>

			<head>Policy suggestions or guidance based on the results of the research<lb/></head>

			<p>The evidence to date suggests several points of guidance for policy makers. First, while an equation<lb/> seeking to explain the adoption of FTTH/B solutions would have many explanatory variables it is normally<lb/> preceded by strong broadband take-up. Broadband take-up is normally best in dynamic markets with strong<lb/> competition with more than two fixed network competitors. Competition on the physical access network<lb/> (whether via ULL, based on cable/other networks or both) is a key requirement to facilitate broadband<lb/> take-up. This suggests that regulation that ensures competitive markets is as important as ever if FTTH/B is<lb/> to be achieved. Once FTTH/B is deployed, ensuring take-up, usage, innovation and consumer outcomes<lb/> generally, will all benefit from more competitive markets.<lb/> Second, competition can drive FTTH/B in certain settings but is unlikely to deliver FTTH/B<lb/> universally, implying that some subsequent government intervention will be needed to deliver FTTH/B<lb/> outside commercial areas. Significant positive externalities can justify such interventions 31 . However, it is<lb/> important that public interventions do not interfere with or indeed forestall private investment. Policy<lb/> makers who clearly specify when and where they will intervene can minimise these risks.<lb/></p>

			<p>Third, public finance given to encourage FTTH/B rollouts should have open access requirements.<lb/> Consistent with maintaining incentives to invest, policy makers should seek to ensure that the best access<lb/> options are available on future access networks where they can influence the outcomes.<lb/> Fourth, FTTH deployment is expensive and choosing the right technology is best left to market<lb/> players to decide in national circumstances. However, physical access products available today on PtMP<lb/> networks are inferior to those available on PtP networks. PtMP networks that anticipate, by installing<lb/> splitters that allow multiple frequencies through, an upgrade to WDM at the point of deployment, can be<lb/> upgraded much more readily than networks that do not.<lb/></p>

			<p>Fifth, countries hoping to achieve a radical improvement in FTTH/B deployment should consider<lb/> measures to improve access competition on current networks. The evidence suggests that not only is this<lb/> important in terms of stimulating investment, it is also critical to ensuring a strong take-up of the network<lb/> once it is available, which in turn will allow shutting down parallel networks in a timely fashion.<lb/></p>

			<p>Finally, countries should take all reasonable measures to lower deployment costs by ensuring<lb/> information transparency on network evolution, setting out clearly migration paths to new access products<lb/> and by giving access to existing passive infrastructures, streamlining building permits and co-ordination of<lb/> investments.<lb/> ANNEX 1-DEFINITIONS<lb/> Fibre-to-the-Home is defined as a telecommunications architecture in which a communications path is<lb/> provided over optical fibre cables extending from the telecommunications operator&apos;s switching equipment<lb/> to (at least) the boundary of the home living space or business office space.<lb/> &quot; Fibre-to-the-Building &quot; is defined as a telecommunications architecture in which a communications<lb/> path is provided over optical fibre cables extending from the telecommunications operator&apos;s switching<lb/> equipment to (at least) the boundary of the private property enclosing the home or business of the<lb/> subscriber or set of subscribers, but where the optical fibre terminates before reaching the home living<lb/> space or business office space and where the access path continues to the subscriber over a physical<lb/> medium other than optical fibre (for example copper loops).<lb/> This definition excludes architectures where the optical fibre cable terminates in public space (for<lb/> example an operator&apos;s street-side cabinet) and where the access path continues to the subscriber over a<lb/> physical medium other than optical fibre (for example copper loops).<lb/></p>
