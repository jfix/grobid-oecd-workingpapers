	<div type="abstract">A previous version of this paper was presented and discussed at the OECD Working Party on<lb/> Migration in June 2015.The paper investigates the preferences and post-graduation mobility behaviour of<lb/> international students, focusing on how the EU could succeed in attracting and keeping highly educated<lb/> talent from across the globe. Providing their skills to European labour markets, graduates from outside the<lb/> EU have a potential to enrich the supply of high-skilled labour. Seen as the 28 EU countries still constitute<lb/> the most attractive destination area for studying abroad, the paper examines different calculation methods<lb/> in order to generate stay rates for over 170 countries of origin.<lb/> Empirical results indicate that for the EU as a whole, aggregate stay rates from stayers from all non-<lb/>EU source countries lie within a range of 16.4% and 29.1%. They are also typically very low among<lb/> students from other OECD countries, and much higher for students from less developed or politically less<lb/> stable countries. The paper concludes by recommending a catalogue of measures to boost the EU&apos;s<lb/> attractiveness, and to increase stay rates. Proposed policy measures draw on a smooth labour market<lb/> integration of international graduates, as well as on cultivating strong points of the European countries,<lb/> such as: political stability and participation possibilities, reliable institutions and governance structure, as<lb/> well as an innovative and competitive environment.<lb/></div>
