	<p type="introduction">1<lb/> OECD/IEA CLIMATE CHANGE EXPERT GROUP PAPERS<lb/> This series is designed to make available to a wider readership selected papers on climate change<lb/> issues that have been prepared for the OECD/IEA Climate Change Expert Group (CCXG). The<lb/> CCXG (formerly called the Annex I Expert Group) is a group of government delegates from OECD<lb/> and other industrialised countries. The aim of the group is to promote dialogue and enhance<lb/> understanding on technical issues in the international climate change negotiations. CCXG papers are<lb/> developed in consultation with experts from a wide range of developed and developing countries,<lb/> including those participating in the regular Global Forum on the Environment organised by the<lb/> CCXG. The full papers are generally available only in English.<lb/> The opinions expressed in these papers are the sole responsibility of the author(s) and do not<lb/> necessarily reflect the views of the OECD, the IEA or their member countries, or the endorsement of<lb/> any approach described herein.<lb/> Comments on the series are welcome, and should be sent to:<lb/></p>

The CCXG Expert Group oversees development of analytical papers for the<lb/> purpose of providing useful and timely input to the climate change negotiations. These papers may<lb/> also be useful to national policy-makers and other decision-makers. Authors work with the CCXG to<lb/> develop these papers. However, the papers do not necessarily represent the views of the OECD or the<lb/> IEA, nor are they intended to prejudge the views of countries participating in the CCXG. Rather, they<lb/> are Secretariat information papers intended to inform Member countries, as well as the UNFCCC<lb/> audience.<lb/> Members of the CCXG are Annex I and OECD countries. The Annex I Parties or countries referred to<lb/> in this document are those listed in Annex I of the UNFCCC (as amended by the Conference of the<lb/></p>

	<div type="abstract">All OECD and IEA information papers for the Climate Change Expert Group on the UNFCCC can be<lb/> downloaded from: www.oecd.org/environment/cc/ccxg.htm<lb/> 3<lb/> ABSTRACT<lb/> Establishing Cycles for Nationally Determined Mitigation Contributions or Commitments<lb/> Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) are currently negotiating a<lb/> climate change agreement scheduled for adoption at the 21st Conference of the Parties in December<lb/> 2015. At the centre of the new agreement are nationally determined contributions (NDCs). These are<lb/> the objectives and actions relating to mitigation or other aspects of climate change responses that<lb/> countries are willing to put forward internationally and be bound by in some way. This paper seeks to<lb/> clarify and discuss ideas contained in the draft agreement and draft decision text for the 2015<lb/> agreement that may serve to enhance the dynamism and ambition of nationally determined mitigation<lb/> contributions or commitments (NDMCs). Provisions for ambition and dynamism are included in the<lb/> procedures framing NDMCs, namely common, regular communications and the requirement that<lb/> NDMCs become more ambitious over time. Several multilateral processes are also proposed, which<lb/> might influence the ambition of NDMCs in terms of their content and implementation. The paper<lb/> discusses proposals for a clarification exercise, a regular global stocktake, and individual assessment<lb/> and review processes contained with the transparency system and a potential facilitative compliance<lb/> and implementation system. There are implementation challenges associated with all proposals,<lb/> though overall these could encourage countries to maximise effort, and provide an opportunity for<lb/> countries to revise and update their contributions and commitments at regular intervals.<lb/> JEL Classification: F53, H87, Q54, Q56, Q58<lb/></div>

	<p type="introduction">RÉSUMÉ<lb/> Établissement de cycles pour les contributions ou les engagements en matière d&apos;atténuation<lb/> déterminées au niveau national<lb/> Most of the processes described in Box 1 already exist, in some form, within the UNFCCC. The<lb/> technical reviews of inventories (annually), Biennial Reports (biennially) and National<lb/> Communications (every four years) for Annex I countries contain recommendations to improve the<lb/> completeness and transparency of future reports. The Multilateral Assessment for developed countries<lb/> is a biennial non-technical process conducted by all Parties, discussing progress towards achieving the<lb/> Party in question&apos;s emissions reduction target. There is no set framework or basis on which an<lb/> assessment is made, but Parties do ask questions to evaluate the quality and nature of the assessed<lb/> Party&apos;s actions and accomplishments, including on additional actions needed to achieve targets, and<lb/> the effects of policies and measures (UNFCCC, 2015a). To date, developing country National<lb/> Communications and Biennial Update Reports are not subject to review; the latter are subject to a<lb/> biennial technical assessment, and a non-technical process involving peer-to-peer exchange referred<lb/> to as a &quot; facilitative exchange of views &quot; . Established outside the regular MRV system, the 2013-15<lb/> Review is a form of global stocktake. This primarily involved taking stock of the latest science to<lb/> determine the adequacy of the 2°C objective, but also assessed overall progress towards the<lb/> Convention&apos;s objective.<lb/> Assessment and review processes under the UNFCCC can focus on both process and substance, in<lb/> varying degrees. Current reviews of National Communications and Biennial Reports, for example,<lb/> assess these documents against their respective reporting guidelines. Recommendations are mostly<lb/> related to reporting provisions, such as on improving the completeness and transparency of reporting.<lb/> However, in some cases reviews also comment on the content being reported, for example, indicating<lb/> that a country is unlikely to meet its mitigation target based on the projections it has provided.<lb/> Box 1: Terms used for review processes and their working definitions<lb/> Assessment: A process where the nature, quality, ability or value of something is evaluated or estimated. As such,<lb/> it implies the use of an assessment framework or set of criteria. For example, the completeness and transparency<lb/> of national reports for Annex I countries is assessed against a set of guidelines. Biennial Update Reports submitted<lb/> by developing countries under the UNFCCC are also subject to a technical assessment. An assessment can<lb/> therefore select different criteria against which to evaluate the nature or ambition of, for example, a national<lb/> contribution or commitment.<lb/> Review: Commonly denotes a formal assessment undertaken with the intention of instituting or recommending<lb/> change. In this sense, review generally denotes a process which looks at historical performance and produces an<lb/> assessment that aims to guide any changes needed, including through explicit recommendations. For example,<lb/> technical reviews of Annex I National Communications result in recommendations to improve the transparency<lb/> and completeness of future reports, based on an assessment framed by the reporting guidelines.<lb/> Stocktake: The act of reviewing and assessing a given situation and associated options, often used to denote a<lb/> reappraisal or reassessment of a situation, along with its progress and prospects. It suggests an exercise that looks<lb/> forward, at future options and prospects, not only at historical performance.<lb/> Clarification exercise: In contrast to the assessment, review or stocktake processes, a clarification exercise aims<lb/> to allow for a better understanding of countries&apos; actions. It may be both a technical and political exercise, as it<lb/> would allow for clarifying questions from other countries. For example, individual Parties made presentations and<lb/> then responded to questions from other Parties under the work programme on clarifying developed country<lb/> targets, and the work programme on understanding developing country mitigation actions.<lb/> Technical vs. Political: Processes can either focus on more technical issues (e.g. similar to current reviews and<lb/> assessments of inventories and national communications) or be more &quot; political &quot; , often peer-to-peer exchanges<lb/> (e.g. similar to current international assessment or facilitative exchange of views). A political process is helpful<lb/> where objective assessments are challenging, and where no established assessment frameworks are in place. It can<lb/> be used to: better understand specific challenges and share experiences between countries; build trust; and create a<lb/> space for discussing political issues, such as ambition and fairness. Terms such as &quot; consideration &quot; , &quot; consultation &quot; ,<lb/> &quot; facilitative dialogue &quot; and &quot; facilitate understanding &quot; may suggest political processes, though dialogue and peer-<lb/>to-peer processes can also be a venue for discussing or clarifying technical issues.</p>
