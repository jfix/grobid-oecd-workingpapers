			<head>1.<lb/> Introduction<lb/></head>

			<p>1.<lb/> A common way to compare and assess sub-central spending power -defined as the extent of<lb/> control sub-central governments (SCG) exert over the budget – is the sub-central share of government<lb/> expenditure, as provided by National Accounts Statistics (OECD) and Government Finance Statistics<lb/> (IMF). However, sub-central spending may be strongly influenced by upper level government regulation,<lb/> reducing SCG discretion over various budget items. An analysis of SCG spending power based on simple<lb/> expenditure shares may therefore be misleading. No internationally comparable indicators of spending<lb/> power are currently available, except for recent activities carried out by the OECD Economics Department<lb/> on primary and secondary education (<ref type="biblio">Gonand et al., 2007</ref>) or a database on decentralisation in developing<lb/> countries (<ref type="biblio">Wunsch, 2006</ref>). To allow for better policy analysis, more refined autonomy indicators would be<lb/> useful. Once established, such indicators could help assess how decentralisation affects policy outcomes<lb/> like public sector efficiency, the fiscal stance or long term sustainability<lb/> 2.<lb/> This paper presents a pilot study on indicators of sub-central spending power and is organised as<lb/> follows: The second section presents sub-central expenditure ratios for the various policy areas based on<lb/> the National Accounts classification of government functions. The third section gives an overview on how<lb/> spending power can be defined and measured. The fourth section presents the results of a pilot study for<lb/> four policy areas, namely education, public transport, childcare and elderly care, and sets the newly<lb/> obtained spending power indicators against the traditional expenditure shares. The fifth section concludes<lb/> and presents options for continuation of the work.</p>

			<table>Most information was provided by questionnaires sent to<lb/> selected countries in summer 2007 and spring 2008. Results of the pilot study can feed into future Network<lb/> activities. The paper does not draw any normative conclusions on efficient allocation of spending power<lb/> across government levels.<lb/> 3.<lb/> Conditional on the small sample of participating countries, the main results of this pilot study can<lb/> be summarised as follows:<lb/> 1.<lb/> OECD Economics Department, 2 rue André Pascal, 75775 Paris Cedex 16, France. Hansjörg Blöchliger is<lb/> Senior Economist at the OECD Economics Department while Steffen Bach and Dominik Wallau were on<lb/> secondment from the German Ministry of Finance when writing this paper. Many thanks go to Claire Charbit,<lb/> Isabelle Joumard, Lee Mizell, Jorgen Elmeskov, Christopher Heady, Peter Höller, Robert Price and Jean-<lb/>Luc Schneider as well as Delegates from the Network on Fiscal Relations Across Levels of Government<lb/> for their comments and suggestions. We would also like to thank the respondents to the Fiscal Network<lb/> questionnaire in the national administrations. Special thanks are due to Susan Gascard for excellent<lb/> technical assistance.<lb/> − Spending power indicators show relatively low SCG spending autonomy. Spending power<lb/> indicators appear to show that SCGs have relatively little power and autonomy, especially if<lb/> compared to the commonly used sub-central expenditure share. Much sub-central spending is<lb/> regulated or otherwise influenced by central government, and simple expenditure shares tend to<lb/> give an inappropriate picture of sub-central spending autonomy.<lb/> − Spending power is particularly low in education. Spending power seems to be particularly low<lb/> in education and to a lesser extent in childcare and elderly care. While the sub-central<lb/> expenditure share in education – often above 50% – suggests extensive sub-central autonomy,<lb/> the spending power indicators paint a different picture, where SCGs mainly function as<lb/> agencies funded and regulated by central government.<lb/> − Federal countries grant more spending power than unitary countries. SCG spending power<lb/> tends to be higher in federal than in unitary countries in most policy areas except elderly care.<lb/> However, federal countries also have more overlapping responsibilities, generating potential<lb/> efficiency losses in intergovernmental relations.<lb/> − Spending power indicators require extensive data analysis. The spending power concept rests<lb/> on a detailed analysis of each policy area for which SCGs spend money. Data</table>

			<p>have to be<lb/> retrieved through questionnaires which require a thorough knowledge of the institutional and<lb/> regulatory background of each policy area on the part of the respondent. If the activity were to<lb/> be extended, only the main sub-central spending areas should be considered and evaluated,<lb/> such as education, health care, social welfare and public infrastructure. Parallel work on more<lb/> detailed financial statistics (COFOG II) could complement the spending power activity.<lb/></p>

			<head>2.<lb/> Expenditure shares: a traditional way to assess SCG budget autonomy<lb/> 2.1<lb/> SCG expenditure shares<lb/></head>

			<p>4.<lb/> Government expenditure shares are currently the most common way of describing SCG spending<lb/> power. The OECD National Accounts provide data on the spending of different levels of government<lb/> based on the COFOG I classification. 2 <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref> shows that the average expenditure share of SCGs from<lb/> 1995 to 2005 across OECD countries amounted to 33%. Values for individual member states vary<lb/> considerably, ranging from nearly 70% in Canada to merely 6% in Greece. Federal and regional countries<lb/> for which data are available have above-average expenditure shares, but only three countries (Canada,<lb/> Denmark and the United States) are effectively decentralised with a SCG-expenditure share exceeding<lb/> 50%. Between 1995 and 2005 the sub-central expenditure share rose by 2%, with more than two thirds of<lb/> all countries showing an increase (not shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<head>2.2<lb/> SCG expenditure shares across policy areas<lb/></head>

			<p>5.<lb/> SCG expenditure shares do not only vary between countries, but also across functions (<ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>).<lb/> The data suggest that on average SCGs are more involved in policy fields which have a smaller share of<lb/> the total public budget, such as environmental protection, with the exception of education where the sub-<lb/>central share clearly exceeds 50% of total public expenditure on average. All other policy areas are<lb/> predominantly financed by central government. <ref type="biblio">Between 1995 and 2005, expenditure</ref> shares rose in all<lb/> service areas except for environment protection and health. Increases were above average in general public<lb/> services, economic affairs, housing and community amenities, and in social protection. Increases were<lb/> below average in education and others. Detailed charts for specific policy fields can be found in the annex<lb/> (<ref type="figure">Figure A1</ref>).<lb/> 6.<lb/> Some functions are characterised by a strong variation in SCG expenditure shares which is not<lb/> easy to explain. A case in point is the large spread of expenditure ratios in health care. While in some<lb/> countries such as Canada, Denmark, Italy, Sweden, Ireland, or Finland the sub-central level accounts for<lb/> more than 80% of total health care spending, in other countries such as France, Greece, Luxembourg, New<lb/> Zealand or the United Kingdom, SCGs have little or virtually no financial responsibility for health care.<lb/> Whether these numbers accurately reflect the national diversity in health care systems requires<lb/> corroboration with respect to more refined indicators of sub-central involvement in the funding of health<lb/> care systems.<lb/></p>

			<head>2.3<lb/> Shortcomings of expenditure shares in measuring budget autonomy<lb/></head>

			<p>7.<lb/> The use of expenditure shares as a measure for sub-central autonomy has its limits, since a large<lb/> SCG expenditure share does not necessarily coincide with true spending autonomy. SCG spending may be<lb/> strongly influenced by upper level government regulation, thus reducing discretion over various<lb/> expenditure items. Often SCGs implement policies which are completely determined by the central<lb/> government and financed through earmarked transfers. In some countries, the transfer of financial<lb/> responsibility for education and health care was hardly more than a change in accounting procedures, while<lb/> essential regulatory and financial power remained with the central level. Hence, the large sub-central<lb/> expenditure ratios for health care in some countries are unlikely to reflect a thoroughly decentralised health<lb/> care system. To produce a more accurate picture of the true level of SCG spending power, a more refined<lb/> set of indicators is required.<lb/></p>

			<head>3.<lb/> Spending power: definition, scope and measurement<lb/> 3.1<lb/> Definition and scope of spending power<lb/></head>

			<p>8.<lb/> The term &quot; spending power &quot; describes the ability of SCGs to shape, determine and change their<lb/> spending policy. The spending power concept thus has a larger scope than that of simple expenditure<lb/> shares and encompasses all facets of policy making. In order to capture the idea of sub-central spending<lb/> power, it is probably best to consider sub-central governments as service providers. SCGs spend money on<lb/> various services, from local public transport and garbage collection, through the police and judiciary, to<lb/></p>

A set of rules and regulations governs each of these<lb/> services, and the more sub-central expenditures are shaped and influenced by upper-level intervention, the<lb/> smaller is the effective power of sub-central governments to determine the size and structure of their<lb/> budget (<ref type="biblio">Watts, 1999</ref>). Hence, SCG spending power depends on the extent to which those regulations are<lb/> under sub-central control. Conceptually, rules and regulations may be grouped into five categories relating<lb/> to major facets of autonomy (see also <ref type="biblio">Bell et al., 2006</ref>):<lb/></p>

			<figure>• Policy autonomy: To what extent do sub-central governments exert control over main policy<lb/> objectives and main aspects of service delivery (e.g. are sub-central governments obliged to<lb/> provide certain services)?<lb/> • Budget autonomy: To what extent do sub-central governments exert control over the budget<lb/> (e.g. is expenditure autonomy limited by earmarked grants or expenditure limits). The stringency<lb/> of fiscal rules could also be assessed here if linked to individual policy areas.<lb/> • Input autonomy: To what extent do sub-central governments exert control over the civil service<lb/> (staff management, salaries) and other input-side aspects of a service (e.g. right to tender or<lb/> contract out services).<lb/> • Output autonomy: To what extent do sub-central governments exert control over standards such<lb/> as quality and quantity of services delivered (e.g. the right to define school curricula, the right to<lb/> set up a hospital, the right to set prices for local public transport etc.)?<lb/> • Monitoring and evaluation: to what extent do sub-central governments exert control over<lb/> evaluation, monitoring and benchmarking (e.g. financial control, school tests, etc.)?<lb/></figure>

			<p>9.<lb/> The five categories of autonomy could in theory be applied to every policy area for which<lb/> spending power is assessed. According to the COFOG level II classification this would mean 69 policy<lb/> areas. Evaluating all categories would be very elaborate, however. Therefore, for practical reasons, a<lb/> spending power database should cover the main expenditure items of sub-central government, likely to<lb/> contain around 8 to 10 policy areas eventually. For the pilot study, four policy areas representing large sub-<lb/>central expenditure shares were analysed.<lb/></p>

			<head>3.2<lb/> Measuring spending power: institutional indicators<lb/></head>

			<p>10.<lb/> Sub-central spending power will be measured by means of institutional indicators. Institutional<lb/> indicators assess a country&apos;s policy arrangements in quantitative terms. Applied to the present study, they<lb/> measure the extent to which SCGs have autonomy in the design of public services, i.e. how and by whom<lb/> are public services provided, organised, regulated or financed. Spending power indicators as developed<lb/> here are intended to be purely descriptive and contain no explicit or implicit evaluation of the effectiveness<lb/> of a given arrangement. Guidelines on how to establish institutional indicators are shown in<lb/> <ref type="biblio">Sutherland et al. (2005)</ref> or Blöchliger (2008).<lb/></p>

			<head>3.3<lb/> Policy areas selected<lb/></head>

			<p>11.<lb/> To assess the feasibility of the spending power concept, four policy areas are selected, namely<lb/> &quot; primary and secondary education &quot; , &quot; public transportation &quot; , &quot; childcare &quot; and &quot; elderly care &quot; . Data was<lb/> obtained through a questionnaire for each policy area. The questionnaire was structured according to the<lb/> five above-mentioned categories policy autonomy, input autonomy, budget autonomy, output autonomy,<lb/> monitoring and evaluation. For &quot; public transportation &quot; , four categories were used, as input autonomy and<lb/> budget autonomy were merged to form one single category. As far as possible the questions followed a<lb/> multiple choice pattern. Five countries participated in the pilot study, of which two – Germany,<lb/> Switzerland – are federal and three – Denmark, Portugal, Slovak Republic – are unitary. In addition,<lb/> Ireland returned a questionnaire on &quot; primary and secondary education &quot; .<lb/></p>

			<head>3.4<lb/> Indicator set and coding<lb/></head>

			<p>12.<lb/> The generalised indicator tree based on a set of recurrent questions for an individual policy area<lb/> is shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>. The indicator tree consists of low-level indicators (LLI), medium-level indicators<lb/> (MLI) and the high-level indicator. Indicator construction starts with LLIs that describe one specific facet<lb/> of autonomy. LLIs are then aggregated using the random-weights technique to form five MLIs actually<lb/> representing the five autonomy categories shown above. The MLIs are finally aggregated to yield a single<lb/> high-level indicator (HLI) portraying spending power in one sub-central policy area. Indicator trees for<lb/> individual policy areas are shown in the Annex (<ref type="figure">Figures</ref> A2.1–A2.4), where further statistical details are<lb/> also explained.<lb/> Figure 3. Spending power: Sample indicator tree<lb/></figure>

			<p>13.<lb/> Coding is relatively simple. Each answer to the questionnaire was transformed into a LLI using<lb/> the codes shown in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>. The lower the level to which a certain responsibility, role or task is assigned,<lb/> the more decentralised the spending power and the higher the indicator value. While indicator values are<lb/> scaled between 0 and 10 and can easily be transformed into percentages, the ordinal ratings are arbitrary. If<lb/> answers to the questionnaire indicated shared responsibilities, the arithmetic mean of the indicator values<lb/> for the government levels involved was used.<lb/> 14.<lb/> Two points are noteworthy with respect to coding for this pilot study:<lb/></p>

			<p>− Providers – schools, hospitals, transport companies etc. – are considered a separate government<lb/> level receiving the highest indicator value. This implies that a move of spending responsibilities<lb/> from a state or local government to providers increases sub-central autonomy. While allocating<lb/> spending power to providers can be considered as decentralisation that tends to bring services<lb/> closer to citizens, it does not necessarily increase sub-central power over a specific service,<lb/> particularly since service providers or the bodies managing them are often not democratically<lb/> controlled. The question whether service providers should be seen as a separate – and decentralised<lb/> – government level should be investigated in more detail.<lb/></p>

			<p>− Local governments in unitary countries were given the value five (5) which is the average of the<lb/> regional (3) and the local level (7) in federal countries. This arbitrary assignment can be interpreted<lb/> as local governments in unitary countries partially fulfilling tasks which are incumbent on state<lb/> governments in federal countries. While this assignment is used to make spending power in federal<lb/> and unitary countries comparable, it rests on the assumption that local levels in both country types<lb/> can be set against each other. The question whether results are comparable for countries with and<lb/> without an intermediate SCG level – state or regional – should also be investigated in more detail.<lb/></p>

			<head>4.1<lb/> Medium-level indicators<lb/></head>

			<p>15.<lb/> <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref> shows preliminary results for medium-level indicators for the four analysed policy areas.<lb/> The higher the value, the greater is SCG autonomy over spending in that policy area.</p>

			<figure>Indicator values for<lb/> federal countries – Germany, Switzerland – are shown in the left hand side of each figure while results for<lb/> unitary countries – Denmark, Portugal, Slovak Republic plus Ireland for &quot; education &quot; – are shown in the<lb/> right hand side. The results for federal/regional and unitary countries are comparable subject to the caveats<lb/> described in Section 3.4. Numerical values are shown in Tables A2.1. to A2.4. in the Annex. Detailed<lb/> figures for each of the participating countries can also be found in the Annex.<lb/></figure>

			<p>16.<lb/> Indicator values are quite dispersed, but certain patterns can be identified. Federal countries tend<lb/> to have higher values than unitary countries. Values for childcare and public transport tend to be higher<lb/> than in the other policy areas. Education has the lowest values, pointing to relatively little autonomy in this<lb/> policy area, while for elderly care autonomy tends to be higher. Data points show relatively small<lb/> dispersion in education, pointing at quite homogenous arrangements, while the spread is larger in childcare<lb/> and public transport, but these spreads are quite country specific: while Switzerland has quite homogenous<lb/> arrangements for elderly care and dispersed arrangements for public transport, the opposite is true for<lb/> Germany.<lb/> 17.<lb/> As for the autonomy categories, central government has a stronger oversight over policy and<lb/> output aspects of a service than over the input and budget side. This is shown by low indicator values for<lb/> policy autonomy in all four service areas and for low values for output autonomy in education and public<lb/> transport. By contrast, in most countries SCGs are granted more leeway for input-related matters such as<lb/> defining the administrative and organisational framework of service delivery. The values for input and<lb/> budget autonomy are therefore higher, especially in education. The few cases where output-oriented<lb/> autonomy is larger than input-oriented autonomy could reveal arrangements that are difficult to manage for<lb/> SCGs. Interestingly, values for monitoring and evaluation have a large spread across services and<lb/> countries, revealing that some monitoring activities are organised at lower government levels while others<lb/> are subject to a high degree of central control.<lb/></p>

			<p>Shared responsibilities between different levels of government can influence the spending power<lb/> of SCGs and the efficiency of intergovernmental fiscal relations. <ref type="table">Table 2</ref> reveals the extent to which<lb/> responsibilities are shared across government levels by showing how often more than one box was ticked<lb/> in the questionnaire. Shared responsibilities are spread unevenly among countries, but federal countries<lb/> tend to share responsibilities more frequently than unitary countries. Of the unitary countries under<lb/> scrutiny, Denmark has fewer shared responsibilities than Portugal or the Slovak Republic. The number of<lb/> shared responsibilities also depends on the service in question, e.g. responsibilities tend to be more often<lb/> shared in public transportation than in childcare or elderly care, likely to reflect the network industry<lb/> character of the former and hence the need for enhanced coordination.<lb/> 19.<lb/> Another way of determining shared responsibilities between different levels of government is by<lb/> means of 90% confidence intervals for a single service and autonomy category, as shown by the vertical<lb/> line through indicator values (Figures A2.1. to A2.8. in the Annex) and obtained through the<lb/> aforementioned random-weights technique. Statistically, confidence intervals indicate the robustness of the<lb/> indicators; in the figurative sense they measure the consistency of a policy setting for one single service.<lb/> The confidence intervals vary considerably, from zero in several cases to almost three indicator points,<lb/> pointing at quite heterogeneous arrangements. In general, confidence intervals tend to be smaller for<lb/> budget autonomy than for the other autonomy categories. Also, federal countries tend to have lower<lb/> confidence intervals than unitary countries, pointing at more consistent policy settings within a single<lb/> autonomy category. For statistical details see the Annex.<lb/></p>

			<figure>20.<lb/> Results for the high-level indicator are shown in Figure 5. The figure can be interpreted in the<lb/> same way as Figure 4. Values are obtained by arithmetic (additive) aggregation of the medium-level<lb/> indicators using the random-weights technique. The top figure compares spending power across policy<lb/> areas, while the bottom figure compares spending power across countries, with federal countries to the left<lb/> and unitary countries to the right. Detailed figures, including the 90% confidence intervals, are shown in<lb/> Annex 2 (Figure A2.9.). Confidence intervals underestimate the uncertainty about the real value of the HLI<lb/> as the confidence intervals of the MLIs are not taken into account. As already stated for the MLI-level,<lb/> confidence intervals also vary considerably, but remain smaller than those for MLIs.<lb/></figure>

			<p>21.<lb/> Again, indicator values vary considerably across policy areas and countries. SCG spending power<lb/> is highest for childcare and lowest for education, particularly in Ireland and Portugal which both appear to<lb/> have a strongly centralised school system. The spread of indicator values across countries is highest in<lb/> childcare and smallest in elderly care, pointing at very different intergovernmental arrangements, while<lb/> values for education and public transportation have similar spreads in a medium range. Spending power is<lb/> generally higher in federal than in unitary countries except for elderly care. Since spending power<lb/> indicators are purely descriptive and not normative, there is no &quot; optimal &quot; indicator value to which the<lb/> actual values could be compared; given the lack of benchmarks, one cannot say whether spending power in<lb/> a particular policy area is &quot; too low &quot; or &quot; too high &quot; in a country.<lb/></p>

			<p>22.<lb/> While high-level indicators permit a quick assessment of a single policy area, they tend to blur<lb/> institutional differences across countries. Indeed, HLIs differ less than MLIs across countries, suggesting<lb/> that policy settings are similar everywhere. Yet as shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>, indicator ordering across autonomy<lb/> categories differs between countries, implying that some SCGs have more input autonomy while others<lb/> have more output autonomy. These differences disappear once intermediate indicators are aggregated,<lb/> since the high-level indicator averages them out. For this reason it may be preferable to concentrate on<lb/> intermediate-level indicators without the aggregation effect just described. In the same vein, intermediate-<lb/>level indicators in the work on primary and secondary education (Joumard, <ref type="biblio">Gonand and Price, 2006</ref>) and<lb/> on market mechanisms in public service provision (<ref type="biblio">Blöchliger, 2008</ref>) proved to be more relevant than the<lb/> high-level indicators.<lb/></p>

			<p>23.<lb/> The spending power indicators developed in this exercise are meant as a complement to<lb/> expenditure shares. Set against each other, they can provide an encompassing picture of sub-central budget<lb/> autonomy. <ref type="table">Table 3</ref> and <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref> compare spending power indicator values for each of the four policy areas<lb/> to the sub-central expenditure ratios for the respective COFOG I function. More specifically, public<lb/> transportation was compared to COFOG I function &quot; economic affairs &quot; , education was compared to<lb/> COFOG I function &quot; education &quot; , and elderly care and childcare were compared to COFOG I function<lb/> &quot; social protection &quot; 3 . Working with the COFOG I classification can only give a rough approximation of the<lb/> true expenditure ratios in a particular policy area, but a more detailed approach can only be undertaken<lb/> once COFOG II data are available.<lb/></p>

Whereas expenditure ratios frequently exceed the 50% threshold, the<lb/> corresponding spending power indicator is rarely above the value 5, indicating that sub-central spending<lb/> power is more limited than expenditure shares suggest. This is particularly true for education. By contrast,<lb/> in the area of economic affairs spending power is relatively high compared to expenditure shares. For most<lb/> policy areas the results suggest that SCGs often function as agencies funded and regulated by the central<lb/> government rather than autonomous and independent policy makers. The power of SCGs over their own<lb/> budget is limited, pointing at potential difficulties once they have to set spending priorities or to enforce<lb/> spending cuts. Again, the comparison rests on the assumption that, first, the spending power indicators can<lb/> be transformed into percentages and, second, that these percentages can be set against sub-central<lb/> expenditure shares.<lb/></p>

			<head>5.<lb/> Conclusions and further steps<lb/></head>

			<p>25.<lb/> This pilot study presented a method to establish indicators that measure the spending power of<lb/> sub-central governments and produced numerical values for a few countries and policy areas. Spending<lb/> power indicators could complement existing financial statistics, especially sub-central expenditure shares,<lb/> delivering a more complete and varied picture of the autonomy SCGs actually enjoy. In the following a<lb/> few suggestions are made if the activity is to be continued, based on what the Secretariathas learnt during<lb/> this exercise and Delegate&apos;s comments during the pilot study.<lb/> • Spending power indicators should only be established for core SCG policy areas. Theoretically, the<lb/> spending power exercise could cover all 69 categories of the COFOG II classification. However,<lb/> the workload to establish indicators is considerable and extending the exercise to all COFOG II<lb/> categories by using a questionnaire with roughly 50 questions for each policy area would yield<lb/> nearly 3.500 data points per country to be analysed. Moreover, detailed COFOG II data is not<lb/> available so far. It is hence useful to apply the spending power concept to core SCG policy areas<lb/> such as education, health care, social welfare, and infrastructure.<lb/> • Spending power indicators should complement financial statistics: Spending power indicators<lb/> provide information which hitherto was not available in this clarity. The newly established<lb/> indicators should however be linked and compared to the existing financial statistics such as sub-<lb/>central expenditure shares, in order for sub-central spending power to be assessed correctly and in<lb/> the most complete way.<lb/> • Providers might not be seen as a separate &quot; government level &quot; : Although in most countries public<lb/> service providers – schools, hospitals, transport companies etc. – do have some spending power,<lb/> they may not be considered a separate government level. Usually providers or the special bodies<lb/> governing them are not democratically controlled. If providers are to be left out, the coding table<lb/> must be adapted accordingly. While providers may indeed have some power over spending issues<lb/> (e.g. the power to negotiate salaries or to determine investment strategies), coding should reflect<lb/> that it is usually a specific government that is granting such spending power to providers.<lb/> • Determining spending power requires careful preparation of questionnaires: When designing<lb/> questionnaires on policy areas, it is crucial to choose questions which are detailed enough to<lb/> capture the diversity of possible service design on one hand, but also to avoid exhaustive length of<lb/> questionnaires on the other hand. Questions should not be too complex (no &quot; compound questions &quot; )<lb/> and not combine different subjects or dimensions of a decision making process, because<lb/> questionnaire recipients are likely to state shared responsibilities when in fact different levels of<lb/> government are responsible for different aspects of service delivery. Questions should however<lb/> reveal real overlapping responsibilities. Often, a multiple-choice-type questionnaire may not<lb/> capture all details of intergovernmental regulation, which makes it advisable to leave space for<lb/> comments and explanations.<lb/> • Allowing for regional bodies in unitary countries: In several unitary countries the regional level<lb/> and regional jurisdictions have gained importance in the last two decades. To allow for a more<lb/> differentiated picture of responsibilities in unitary countries, it could be useful to distinguish<lb/> between a local and a regional level. Also inter-jurisdictional agreements that leave, once<lb/> established, little autonomy to an individual jurisdiction could be included.<lb/> • Efficiency of spending power arrangements: The approach developed in this paper is descriptive<lb/> and not normative, i.e. spending power arrangements are not evaluated. As a next step,<lb/> preliminary work on how to measure the efficiency of spending power arrangements could be<lb/> carried out.<lb/> 26.<lb/> To provide a closer link with National Accounts, it would be useful to have COFOG II<lb/> expenditure data, whose sub-division into government functions corresponds more closely than COFOG I<lb/> data to the policy areas selected for the spending power indicators. Progress on spending power indicators<lb/> and on COFOG II data could be made independently but in parallel, and in the future the two datasets<lb/> could be made comparable. At European Union level a Task Force to implement COFOG II has been<lb/> established.<lb/></p>
