Co-Operation in Zambia: 
An Overview December 2014 2014-03 1 2 OECD GREEN GROWTH PAPERS The OECD Green Growth Strategy, launched in May 2011, provides concrete recommendations and 
measurement tools to support countries' efforts to achieve economic growth and development, while at the 
same time ensuring that natural assets continue to provide the ecosystem services on which our well-being 
relies. The strategy proposes a flexible policy framework that can be tailored to different country 
circumstances and stages of development. OECD Green Growth Papers should not be reported as representing the official views of the OECD or 
of its member countries. The opinions expressed and arguments employed are those of the author(s). OECD Green Growth Papers aim to describe preliminary results or research in progress by the

and integrates the value of natural capital into economic decision-making and development planning, 
which is critical to avoid natural capital depletion, the worst of climate change and social and national 
security risks (OECD, 2013). This is particularly true for developing countries, because of their 
dependence on natural assets and acute exposure and vulnerability to environmental risks, ranging from 
air, water and soil pollution, as well as natural resource scarcity and extreme weather events exacerbated 
by climate change. A green growth policy framework recognises and aims to address both micro-and 
macro-level pressures that countries face to grow their economies, while also managing environmental 
risks. In poorer developing countries, micro-level pressures may include lack of access to basic services 
such as shelter, fuel, water; while macro-level pressures are threats to stable livelihoods due to 
unemployment, poverty, social inequality, or resource scarcity or mismanagement. Leaders in developing 
countries today face clear choices to guide development towards a new growth model (OECD, 2013). 
These countries have the opportunity to move away from conventional growth strategies – the  " grow now, 
clean up later "  model – towards a green growth model, with the aim to build resilient and fairer economies 
around a vision of sustainable development. An increasing number of developing countries have formulated and/or implemented innovative policies to 
pursue green growth, notably in Africa (AfDB, 2013; AfDB and OECD, 2013; OECD, 2013, 2014a). 
Zambia, in particular, is committed to drawing up an Inclusive Green Growth Strategy (IGGS) that builds 
upon a nationally-defined and comprehensive definition of green growth (Government of Zambia, 2012). 
A preliminary understanding already exists on what green growth means in Zambia, namely inclusive 
development that makes sustainable and equitable use of the country's natural resources within ecological 
limits (Banda and Bass, 2014). This effort can draw from a solid set of initiatives and institutions where 
green considerations are already beginning to be mainstreamed. Key among these are Zambia's National 
Long Term Vision and the Fifth and Sixth National Development Plans (2006-10 and 2011-15 
respectively), and subsequent implementation through green programmes, policies, and processes i.e. 
targeting biodiversity, climate change adaptation, climate change mitigation, desertification, and other 
environmental objectives. 6 This paper illustrates the foundations of green growth in Zambia and provides an overview of bilateral 
green development co-operation efforts in the country from 2004 to 2012. Zambia is considered a 
 " frontrunner "  with respect to green planning and policy (Pauw, 2014; UN-HABITAT, 2014), yet most of 
the funding for its green programmes and initiatives has come from providers of development co-operation 
(Aongola et al., 2009; Government of Zambia, 2011a). Bilateral Official Development Assistance (ODA) 
targeting green objectives reached up to 30% of total bilateral ODA to Zambia over 2010-12 (USD 218 
million) (OECD DAC CRS, 2014). 1 Importantly, the volume of green bilateral commitments increased 
steadily since 2004-06 (albeit part of this increase resulted from better reporting of green ODA flows by 
members of the OECD's Development Assistance Committee (DAC)), but this happened in the context of 
falling ODA flows to Zambia – bilateral ODA fell from USD 1.7 billion in 2004-06 to USD 738 million in 
2010-12. 2 This illustrates the important role of green ODA in Zambia. Green ODA to Zambia targets many of the leading sectors of the economy, namely agriculture, energy, 
transport, and water supply and sanitation, and these are identified as key by the country's vision and plans 
for its development pathway (Government of Zambia, 2006a, 2006b, 2011a). This suggests that green 
interventions are relatively aligned with the government of Zambia's plans and that providers use these to 
inform the priority sectors and types of technical support provided (Co-operating Partners to the JASZ I, 
2007 and Co-operating Partners to the JASZ II, 2011). The Joint Assistance Strategy to Zambia (JASZ) has 
been a key mechanism to co-ordinate across development co-operation activities of different providers. 
With respect to green interventions, the JASZ has avoided duplication of provider activities, and has 
improved the information flow between providers and the government of Zambia (Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs of Denmark, 2010). Working closely with the government, several Nordic countries, which rank 
among the most active providers of green ODA in Zambia and lead under the JASZ on green matters, have 
established strategic plans in co-operation with the government to implement activities that support 
mainstreaming green objectives into many areas of government operations and policy (e.g. agriculture, 
forestry, water supply and sanitation). The JASZ has potential to be the main forum for providers to support the implementation of any 
forthcoming agenda on green growth led by the government of Zambia. To do so, and to further increase 
the effectiveness of development co-operation in the Zambian context, the JASZ could continue aligning 
the interests of providers and those of Zambia (Mulenga, 2013) in three respects: @BULLET First, the government of Zambia targets poverty reduction as its chief priority in both 
development planning and in its future inclusive green economy strategy (Banda and Bass, 
2014). However, few green international projects have explicitly targeted or achieved the 
objective of poverty reduction (Banda, 2013). Although the main aim of ODA is, by definition, to 
promote the economic development and welfare of developing countries, poverty reduction 
remains an aspect of green ODA that could be bolstered. 1 In this paper, bilateral ODA targeting green objectives refers to those activities targeting biodiversity, climate 
change adaptation, climate change mitigation, desertification, and other environmental objectives. 2 The DAC currently has 29 members: Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Czech Republic, Denmark, European 
Union, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Korea, Luxembourg, The Netherlands, New 
Zealand, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Slovak Republic, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom and 
United States. This paper covers the activities of these providers, except from Czech Republic, Iceland, Poland, 
Slovak Republic, and Slovenia, which joined in 2013. Korea joined the DAC in 2009. 7 @BULLET Second, a number of key sectors for the Zambian economy and its development receive virtually 
no green ODA or relatively small volumes of green ODA and could benefit from increased 
attention. These include key economic sectors, such as mining, industry or tourism (Telfer and 
Sharpley, 2008; World Bank, 2014), which face a host of environment-related risks and are 
important in Zambia's economic development (Government of Zambia, 2011a). Similarly, green 
issues could also be further mainstreaming into local-level institutions and planning processes, 
including in urban areas, where no projects could be identified targeting this level of governance 
over 2010-12. @BULLET Finally, the Zambian government has identified the need for a climate financing framework (e.g., 
developing an in-country regulatory framework, human and institutional capacity and fiduciary 
standards) to tap into international financing mechanisms and to use these funds to leverage 
private sector investment into climate change (Government of Zambia, 2012). There is also an 
opportunity to mobilise and allocate domestic resources – public and private – to some of the 
core government functions to protect and promote environmental performance. Provider support 
in this area could help with the government's objective to ease dependency on ODA and lessen 
the reliance on foreign ODA in the green sector; while reducing the vulnerability of the country. 8 LIST OF ABBREVIATIONS AfDB

Africa is particularly vulnerable to climate change, with most of its crops likely to be negatively affected 
by rising temperatures and shifting precipitation patterns (IPCC, 2014). These global changes interact with 
local environmental issues such as land degradation, the depletion of natural resources, air and water 
pollution. Development, urbanisation and population growth are also putting pressure on local 
environments and increasing the ecological footprint of the region, while underlining the urgency of 
strengthening the resilience of livelihoods and sustainably managing essential natural resources and related 
ecosystem goods and services. This is particularly important in Africa, where the poorest of the poor rely 
disproportionately on natural resources to sustain their livelihoods (OECD, 2013; IPCC, 2014) and where 
it is becoming increasingly important to put green measures in place to manage and reduce the risks 
associated with climate change and unsustainable development pathways (AfDB, 2013). An increasing number of African countries have formulated or are formulating green growth strategies and 
policies (AfDB; 2013; AfDB and OECD, 2013; OECD, 2013). Embracing green growth can secure a 
strong, stable and sustainable future for developing countries because green growth rests on recognising 
and integrating the value of natural capital into economic decision-making and development planning 
(OECD, 2013), thus helping to tackle pressing social issues (e.g. lack of access to basic services and 
infrastructure, high vulnerability and threats to stable livelihoods from resource scarcity or 
mismanagement). Realising the benefits of green growth, the Zambian government aims to develop an Inclusive Green 
Growth Strategy (IGGS) (Government of Zambia, 2012). Although an official, comprehensive definition is 
still to be developed, a preliminary understanding already exists on what green growth means in the 
Zambian context, and which refers to inclusive development that makes sustainable and equitable use of 
Zambia's natural resources within ecological limits (Banda and Bass, 2014). Developing the IGGS could 
build upon substantial experience with mainstreaming green considerations across sectors and levels of 
government and pre-existing green institutions, processes and policies (Banda, 2013; Banda and Bass, 
2014). These explain why Zambia is considered a  " frontrunner "  in the green planning and policy space in 
Africa (Pauw, 2014; UN-HABITAT, 2014). Notwithstanding this, most of Zambia's green activities have 
been largely supported by international providers of development co-operation (Watson et al. 2013). Their 
experience in this sphere can therefore also help the Zambian government support the IGGS process, for 
example through sharing lessons learned and good practice, including from related experience elsewhere. This paper illustrates the foundations of green growth in Zambia and provides an overview of green 
development co-operation efforts in the country from 2004 to 2012. Section 2 discusses on-going efforts 
towards greening growth in Zambia. Section 3 looks at total bilateral green Official Development 
Assistance (ODA) flows from members of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and 
Development's (OECD) Development Assistance Committee (DAC) member countries, i.e. targeting 
biodiversity, climate change adaptation, climate change mitigation, desertification, and other 
environmental objectives. This analysis draws on OECD DAC statistics, in particular the Creditor 10 Reporting System (CRS). 3 It describes the sectors targeted, as well as the instruments used, and discusses 
the degree of alignment between Zambian priorities and providers' activities. Section 4 then explores 
specific provider co-ordination efforts and strategies to support the mainstreaming of green issues in-
country. The paper concludes with a number of questions that could guide further research on this topic in 
Zambia and beyond. TOWARDS GREEN GROWTH IN ZAMBIA Zambia's gross domestic product (GDP) grew on average by 6.3% over 2004-13 (World Bank, 2014) 
stimulated by economic reforms, infrastructure investments, a better educated population and the 
development of natural resources (Murray McIntire, 2014). A number of environmentally sensitive sectors 
are responsible for this growth, notably mining (copper, cobalt, lead), tourism, agriculture (maize) or 
forestry (Aongola et al., 2009; Banda and Bass, 2014). The mining sector, in particular, contributed to over 
a third of Zambia's GDP and 70% of its export value on average during that period (Government of 
Zambia, 2011a). Agriculture, forestry and fishing contributed another 15% and provided for up to 80% of 
all livelihoods (FAO, 2009; Government of Zambia, 2010b). According to the World Bank, environmental 
assets amount to 27% of all assets available for Zambia's development (with other assets being financial, 
infrastructure, social, and human in nature). Cropland and forests are particularly abundant in Zambia 
(World Bank, 2006), yet this figure may actually be underestimated as the measurement of environmental 
assets excludes the value of many ecosystem services (Aongola et al., 2009). The benefits of growth have not been widely shared across different income groups in Zambia. Poverty 
stood at 64% of the population in 2013 (down from 68% in 1996; Government of Zambia, 2012), and the 
poor largely depend on rapidly shrinking or vulnerable environmental assets to sustain their incomes and 
livelihoods (Government of Zambia, 2012). This is especially the case in rural areas, which account for 
60% of the population. Population growth, rural flight, rapid urbanisation and a growing middle-class are 
further straining an already fragile environmental balance (Aongola et al., 2009). As a result, Zambia 
appears unlikely to meet the Millennium Development Goal (MDG) 7 to provide adequate clean water and 
sanitation, to slow the rate of deforestation, and to protect biodiversity by 2015 (Government of Zambia, 
2012). In other words, Zambia's recent growth has been natural resource intensive, leading to problems of 
environmental degradation and heightened climate change-related risks (see Box 1). However, growth has 
not translated into rapid poverty and inequality reduction rates (World Bank, 2014). Zambia aims to 
become a middle-income country by 2030 (Government of Zambia, 2006b) but achieving this goal will 
require a long-term strategy to manage its green assets in a sustainable manner. 3 ODA refers to flows of official financing administered with the promotion of the economic development and welfare of 
developing countries as the main objective, and which are concessional in character with a grant element of at least 25%. By 
convention, ODA flows comprise contributions of provider government agencies, at all levels, to developing countries (bilateral 
ODA) and to multilateral institutions (OECD, 2014b). 11 Realising the potential benefits of green growth, the Zambian government aims to develop an Inclusive 
Green Growth Strategy (IGGS) (Government of Zambia, 2012). Although an official, comprehensive 
definition is still to be developed, a preliminary understanding has already emerged on what green growth 
means in the Zambian context. Namely, green growth refers to inclusive development that makes 
sustainable and equitable use of Zambia's natural resources within ecological limits (Banda and Bass, 
2014). More specifically, green growth is seen as a deliberate, progressive and incremental move away 
from a carbon intensive economic model of growth to one compatible with sustainable development; it 
aims to fulfil short-and medium-term needs, such as reducing unemployment, poverty and inequality, and 
long-term needs, such as overcoming infrastructure deficits, connecting to markets worldwide and 
supporting urban growth (Government of Zambia 2012; Banda and Bass, 2014). 12 Box 4. Climate change and deforestation in Zambia Climate change is expected to have important impacts in Zambia. By the end of the first decade of the 21st 
century, mean temperatures are estimated to be 1.3 degrees C warmer and precipitation patterns 2.3% 
rainfall lower per decade on average since the 1960s (McSweeney et al., 2008). Temperatures are 
projected to increase by another 1.2 -3.4 degrees C and rainfall to decrease by a further 8-10% by 2060 
(Hertel et al., 2010; Dell et al., 2012). This is likely to modify the catchment areas of the major Zambezi 
river watershed (with lower levels in dry seasons and higher in wet seasons); to increase evaporation in 
deep lakes (e.g. levels in the lake Tanganyika are decreasing due to the combined effect of drought, 
warming and human activities; IPCC, 2014); to change the climate of the Zambian highlands, but to reduce 
annual runoff by 30-50% under a scenario of warming above 2.7 degrees C by 2060-80 (Dell et al., 2012; 
IPCC, 2014). Extreme weather events are also predicted to increase in frequency. Floods, droughts and 
heavy rainfall are already increasing in intensity and frequency (Fumpa-Makano, 2011). Lusaka and other 
urban areas of Zambia are increasingly vulnerable to extreme weather events such as severe heat, heavy 
rainfall and flooding due to the growth of informal settlements, reliance on urban agriculture to sustain the 
livelihoods of the urban poor, and low levels of piped water, sewerage and electricity access (Heath et al., 
2010). As a result, climate change impacts are expected to alter the prospects for sustainable development in 
Zambia. In particular, unmitigated climate change is expected to: compromise agricultural and livestock-based livelihood security by lowering agricultural growth by 1% p.a. 
(AfDB, 2013), negatively impact water quality and availability as well as human health (e.g. increased incidence of 
climate-sensitive diseases such as malaria, cholera and dysentery; FAO, 2009; IPCC, 2014), put at risk vital infrastructure, including hydro-power generation and at urban level (UN-HABITAT, 2014), harm biological diversity, forestry and agricultural productivity and increase price volatility (e.g. reduction in 
fish stocks, soil erosion, decreased soil fertility; Government of Zambia, 2012). Since 2003, Zambia has suffered losses in GDP estimated at USD 13.8 billion due to floods and droughts 
and is it is expected to lose over USD 2 billion per year (amounting to 0.9% to 1.5% of its annual GDP 
growth) due to climate change through 2020 (Government of Zambia, 2011a), while lower agricultural 
productivity due to climate change will cost USD 4.3 billion in GDP over the next decade (AfDB, 2013). The 
estimated loss of agricultural potential due to climate variability is USD 2.2 -3.1 billion of GDP per year 
until 2020 (representing up to 2% of its annual GDP growth; Government of Zambia, 2011a). In Zambia, forests provide edible products (e.g. caterpillars, mushrooms, honey), fuel in the form of 
firewood or charcoal and health services through medicinal plants. However, charcoal markets and 
agricultural needs are driving deforestation (IDLO and FAO, 2011). The rate of deforestation is estimated 
to be the second highest per capita in Africa and the fifth highest in the world (estimated at 4,000 km2 of 
forests lost every year from 1990 to 2005; see UNDP 2008), causing further land degradation and 
desertification (Government of Zambia, 2006a, 2011a; Watson et al., 2013). Source: AfDB, (2013) African Development Report 2012: Towards Green Growth in Africa, Tunis, African Development Bank; Dell,

2013; Banda and Bass, 2014), especially into the country's National Long Term Vision 2030 (NLTV; 
Government of Zambia, 2006b) and the Fifth and Sixth National Development Plans (2007-11 and 2011-
15 respectively; Government of Zambia, 2006a, 2010b). Over time, green issues, understood here to 
encompass biodiversity, climate change adaptation, climate change mitigation, desertification and local 
environmental issues, have progressively gained more space in these documents (see Table 1). As the 
implementation of these documents is meant to guide further decision-and policy-making, a number of 
green institutions and processes have been established to help with the mainstreaming process and have 
supported the implementation of several programmes and policies at the national and local levels (Banda 
and Bass, 2014; see Annex 1 for an overview). These developments are likely to inform the formulation of 
a Zambian IGGS in the future. Table 1. Green and development priorities of Zambia Document

African Cities 2014: Re-imagining Sustainable Urban Transitions, Nairobi: UN-HABITAT; Watson, C. et al., (2013), Understanding 
Climate Finance Readiness Needs in Zambia, Bonn: GIZ. 14 In light of these strategies and plans, Zambia is considered a  " frontrunner "  with respect to green planning 
and policy-making in Africa (Pauw, 2014; UN-HABITAT, 2014), displaying strong political will to 
engage on green issues (Watson et al., 2013) and relatively high levels of awareness among decision 
makers and the general public on these issues (Aongola et al., 2009). Looking forward, it is expected that 
the Seventh NDP (2016-20) will serve as a framework for a Zambian IGGS once it is developed, bringing 
more coherence and capacity to manage green issues at national and local levels (Banda and Bass, 2014). To date, most of Zambia's environmental projects and programmes have been largely supported by the 
international development co-operation community (Watson et al., 2013). It is widely understood that 
providers of development assistance can help developing countries transition towards green growth (AfDB 
and OECD, 2013; OECD, 2013). They can offer finance, help transfer knowledge, build capacity and 
promote learning, open markets for green goods and services, as well as support reforms in legal 
frameworks and collective action agreements to create a basis for new green activities at sectoral, local 
and/or national level (Aongola et al., 2009; OECD, 2013). A Zambian IGGS could therefore also build 
upon the support of providers of development co-operation and their experience in this space. Zambian priorities and the increasing number of green activities have also provided a framework for 
development co-operation providers to act in this area. In particular, alignment between providers' 
activities and Zambian priorities has been facilitated by the on-going work of the Joint Assistance Strategy 
for Zambia (JASZ). The JASZ was created to co-ordinate the activities of providers in Zambia 
(Government of Zambia, 2006a), and constitutes a response to the Paris Declaration on ODA Effectiveness 
and its five principles (OECD, 2005) and the Accra Agenda of Action (OECD, 2008; see Box 2). 15 Box 5. International principles on aid effectiveness and effective development co-operation The Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness (OECD, 2005) outlines five fundamental principles for 
making ODA more effective, born out of decades of experience of what works and what does not work 
for development: @BULLET Ownership: Developing countries set their own strategies for poverty reduction, improve their institutions and tackle corruption. @BULLET Alignment: Development co-operation providers align behind these objectives and use local systems. @BULLET Harmonisation: Providers co-ordinate, simplify procedures and share information to avoid duplication. @BULLET Results: Developing countries and providers shift focus to development results and results get measured. @BULLET Mutual accountability: Providers and developing countries are accountable for results. These principles are further elaborated by the Busan Declaration, which fleshed out some of these 
to form the foundation of effective development co-operation, namely: @BULLET Ownership of development priorities by developing countries: Partnerships for development can only succeed if they are led by developing countries, implementing 
approaches that are tailored to country-specific situations and needs. @BULLET Focus on results: Investments and efforts must have a lasting impact on eradicating poverty and reducing inequality, on sustainable development, and on enhancing developing countries' 
capacities, aligned with the priorities and policies set out by developing countries themselves. @BULLET Inclusive development partnerships: Openness, trust, and mutual respect and learning lie at the core of effective partnerships in support of development goals, recognising the different 
and complementary roles of all actors. @BULLET Transparency and accountability to each other: Mutual accountability and accountability to the intended beneficiaries of co-operation efforts, as well as to respective citizens, 
organisations, constituents and shareholders, is critical to delivering results. Transparent 
practices form the basis for enhanced accountability. All members of the OECD DAC have endorsed these principles, which are applicable to all 
development co-operation activities. Implementation of these principles and commitments to integrate 
them into development co-operation activities of DAC members is well under way and the OECD has 
been monitoring progress since 2006 (OECD, 2011). Source: OECD (2005), Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness, Paris: OECD; OECD (2011), Aid Effectiveness 2011: Progress

Country (LMIC) status in 2011 due to reductions in poverty and sustained growth (OECD, 2011a). 5 
Political stability and strong growth have improved investor confidence, as evidenced in the issue of two 
oversubscribed Euro bonds raising USD 750 million (Watson et al., 2013), or the increase in Foreign 
Direct Investment from USD 164 million in 2003 to USD 1.7 billion in 2010 (World Bank, 2012). In light 
of this, Zambia is increasingly less reliant on ODA: total ODA as a percentage of Gross National Income 
(GNI) steadily declined from 29% in 2004-06 to 11% in 2010-12 (Chart 1), in line with a general 
downward trend of ODA to Sub-Saharan Africa in recent years (OECD, 2014c). Chart 1. Trends in total ODA to Zambia 2004-12, bilateral and multilateral commitments, 3-year annual averages, USD billion, constant 2012 prices Source: OECD DAC Statistics, September 2014; World Bank, October 2014. Notes: 1) Chart 1 presents a trend based on averages 
over three years, so as to smooth fluctuations form large multi-year projects programmed and committed in a given year; 2) The 
share of ODA to GNI was calculated using constant 2000 USD. 4 According to the UN, a LDC is a country that exhibits the lowest indicators of socio-economic development, with 
the lowest Human Development Index ratings of all countries worldwide (UNDESA, 2014). 5 According to the World Bank, a LMIC is defined as a country with a GNI per capita between USD 1,045 -4,125 in 
2013 (World Bank, 2013). 17 Since 2004, total bilateral and multilateral ODA flows committed to Zambia have fallen from USD 1.9 
billion in 2004-06 to USD 1.1 billion in 2010-12 (Chart 1). 6 Bilateral ODA provided by DAC member 
countries, including the European Union (EU) institutions, has generally been the largest source, 
representing 68% of total ODA to Zambia over 2010-12 (USD 730 million), falling from USD 1.6 billion 
in 2004-06 and 85% of total ODA commitments to Zambia. Multilateral commitments, in turn, reached 
USD 350 million over 2010-12, growing by 16% compared to 2004-06. 7 Total bilateral and multilateral ODA commitments to Zambia over 2010-12 primarily targeted the 
following sectors: health and population (30.2%), transport and storage (13.2%), agriculture (10%), 
government and civil society (7.4%), water supply and sanitation (5.2%) and education (5%); with 8.8% of 
total commitments providing general budget support. Looking at bilateral and multilateral commitments, 6 
of the top 10 providers over 2010-12 were bilateral providers of development co-operation (Table 2). 6 Commitments are firm obligations, expressed in writing and backed by the necessary funds, undertaken by an 
official donor to provide specified assistance to a recipient country or a multilateral organisation (OECD, 
2014b). 7 The DAC CRS also recorded flows from Kuwait (USD 14.5 million) and the United Arab Emirates (USD 0.4 
million) to Zambia in 2010. 18 Table 2. Top 10 bilateral and multilateral donors in Zambia, providing 81% of total ODA Annual average 2010-12, bilateral and multilateral commitments, USD million, constant 2012 prices Provider of development co-operation

3% Source: OECD DAC Statistics, September 2014 Trends in total domestic and external green development finance to Zambia 8 This section looks at domestic levels of green finance and provides an overview of green external 
development finance in Zambia. 9 Domestic sources of green finance have generally been low: the 
investments associated with the environment chapter of the Fifth National Development Plan (FNDP) 
stood at 2% of the national budget according to the medium-term expenditure framework of the FNDP 
(Aongola et al., 2009). Environmental protection, pollution control, environmental and climate change 
mainstreaming represented only 3% of the national budget in 2011 (Government of Zambia, 2011b). By 
contrast, governmental allocation to climate change adaptation and mitigation in the national budget was 
on average 7% of total resources over 2008-2012 (Mulenga, 2013). With the Sixth National Development 
Plan (SNDP), the government planned to increase its green funding by 33% for the 2011-15 period 
compared to 2006-10 (Government of Zambia, 2011b). However, this would still leave green investments 
heavily dependent on external support from providers of development co-operation (Government of 
Zambia, 2006a, 2008; Mulenga, 2013). Total green bilateral ODA committed by the members of the OECD DAC reached 30% of total ODA 
commitments to the country over 2010-12 (USD 230 million), up from 6% of total bilateral ODA 
commitments over 2004-06 (USD 90 million; Chart 2), increasing at a time when total ODA volumes were 8 This paper only provides a partial picture of total green ODA flows to Zambia, based on the activities of bilateral 
providers of development co-operation. An integrated, full picture including multilateral providers is still missing at 
the time of writing. 9 Total bilateral green ODA commitments are calculated using the OECD DAC CRS as being the total ODA 
commitments marked as principal or significant with the environment marker, plus additional ODA to climate change 
adaptation marked principal or significant, additional ODA to climate change mitigation marked principal or 
significant, additional ODA to biodiversity marked principal or significant, and additional ODA to desertification 
marked principal or significant. Care has been taken to aggregate these figures to ensure there is no double counting 
where activities target multiple environmental objectives. For a further description of the CRS database and the Rio 
markers methodology, see Annex 1. 19 falling (Chart 1). These green flows include ODA targeting local environment objectives, as well as global 
objectives enshrined in the three Rio Conventions (biodiversity, climate change and desertification). 10 Chart 2. Trends in total green ODA to Zambia 2004-2012, bilateral commitments, USD million, constant 2012 prices, 3-year annual averages Source: OECD DAC CRS, September 2014. Note: The adaptation marker was introduced in 2010 so reported figures over 2004-09 
may appear lower than in practice, and may reflect a break in the series given pre-2010 adaptation spend was not monitored; Activities are classified as either having principal or significant green objectives (see Annex 1 for further 
information on the Rio Markers methodology). On the one hand, principal activities are activities where 
green issues are central and where the activity would not have gone ahead without having a green 
dimension. The amount of ODA having green principal objectives is relatively low in Zambia, with 
volumes varying over 2004-2012, and reaching USD 26 million over 2010-12 (see Chart 2). On the other 
hand, activities that providers score as significant have other prime objectives but have been formulated or 
adjusted to help meet green concerns, and failure to take this dimension into account would have not 
prevented the activity from going ahead. In Zambia, the majority of green ODA is marked as having a 
significant objective, accounting for 88% of all green ODA committed to the country over 2010-12 (USD 
192 million), up from 2004-06 when it represented 77% of total ODA (USD 75 million). This suggests 
high levels of mainstreaming of green concerns across the portfolios of development co-operation 
providers. 10 OECD DAC members did not monitor all their green development finance during 2004-09, e.g. monitoring climate 
change mitigation only became mandatory in 2006, and climate change adaptation was only monitored after 2010. As 
a result, part of the increase observed in Zambia also reflects improvements in the statistical coverage of green 
development finance. 20 Chart 3. Total ODA supporting environmental and Rio Convention objectives in Zambia 2004-12, bilateral commitments, USD million, constant 2012 prices, 3-year annual averages Source: OECD DAC CRS, September 2014. Note: The ODA commitments to biodiversity, climate, desertification and local 
environmental objectives displayed in this chart cannot be aggregated, as activities may target multiple objectives. Aggregated 
figures, taking into account any overlaps between finance targeting multiple objectives have been taken into account for the 
preparation of Chart 2. For further information on the methodology employed to avoid double counting, see Annex 1. Looking at the components of green bilateral ODA commitments shows that the increase since 2004-06 
has been primarily driven by climate-related ODA (Chart 3). Climate change adaptation represented 14% 
of total climate-related ODA in 2010-12, reaching USD 46 million per year on average, while climate 
change mitigation-related ODA accounted for 0.4% or USD 1.5 million over 2010-12 on average per year. 
The remainder, or over 85% or USD 272 million per year on average targeted both climate change 
adaptation and mitigation. During the same period, too, biodiversity-and desertification-related ODA 
halved in volume to USD 19 million and USD 10 million respectively. Providers are also seeking synergies 
within and across their green portfolios (Chart 4). An estimated USD 10 million or 7% of environment-
related ODA also targets all other green objectives; USD 17 million or 13% of environment-related ODA 
also targets climate change mitigation and adaptation objectives; and all of the biodiversity and 
desertification-related ODA, and virtually all of the adaptation-related ODA targets at least one other green 
objective. That being said, 70% of total green ODA still targets climate change mitigation alone (USD 54 
million); and 44% of environment-related ODA targets local environmental objectives only (USD 58 
million). 21 Chart 4. Overlaps between OECD DAC members' ODA green activities Annual average, 2010-12, USD million, constant 2012 prices Source: OECD DAC CRS, September 2014. It is noteworthy that the climate-related development finance figures presented here may not be 
comparable to those reported by Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change 
(UNFCC) in their National Communications, Biennial Reports, or Biennial Update Reports. Reporting to 
the UNFCCC is often based on, but may not be directly comparable to the OECD DAC Rio marker data 
presented here as different methodologies are applied, in particular to account only for a certain share of 
finance targeting climate change marked as a significant objective (Ockenden and Gaveau, 2014 
forthcoming). During 2008-12 (covering the 2010-12 period of Fast-start Finance period), climate 
financing to Zambia amounted to USD 24 million, or USD 8 million on average per year. (Mulenga, 2013). 
This has been primarily provided through grants originating from Germany's International Climate 
Initiative, the Global Environmental Facility-Administered Trust Fund and the United Nations 
Collaborative Programme on Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (UN 
REDD+), aimed at climate change mitigation. In addition, a grant from Japan's Fast Start Finance focused 
on climate change adaptation. The Climate Investment Funds (CFIs), in particular, have also been a key 
international driver for the increase in climate change adaptation finance to Zambia, as the country was 
included in its Pilot Program for Climate Resilience (PPCR; Box 3). 22 Box 6. The Pilot Program for Climate Resilience in Zambia The Pilot Program for Climate Resilience (PPCR) is funded by the Strategic Climate Fund, one of 
the two Climate Investment Funds (CIFs). It is designed to demonstrate ways that developing countries 
can make climate risk and resilience part of their core development planning. It helps countries build on 
their National Adaptation Programs of Action and helps fund public and private sector investments 
identified in climate resilient development plans. In Zambia, the African Development Bank (AfDB) worked closely with the government and other 
partners to develop a PPCR investment strategy in line with national development priorities, including 
strengthening early warning weather systems, integrating climate resilience in infrastructure planning 
and investments, and strengthening the adaptive capacity and livelihood of farmers and natural 
ecosystems in the most affected areas of southern and western Zambia. To date, Zambia has received a PPCR programme development grant of USD 1.5 million to 
support preparation of its PPCR investment strategy, the Strategic Programme on Climate Resilience. 
The AfDB is supporting this phase by providing input on mainstreaming climate resilience into national 
development planning; strengthening institutional co-ordination, improving information for decision-
makers; and shaping targeted awareness and communication. This provided individual ministries the 
mandate to work on climate change issues, because budget allocations were linked to the strategy; has 
also strengthened country ownership and effectiveness by promoting institutional reforms on adaptation 
planning; and succeeded to change and improve the political economy context through concessional 
finance (Climate Investment Funds, 2014). Finally, this has also translated into three concrete 
interventions covering a range of sectors, e.g. two projects on building resilience in land-based 
livelihoods and infrastructure in two river sub-basins and a project on private sector support for climate 
resilience in those same sub-basins. Source: Climate Investment Funds (2014), Learning by Doing: The CIFs Contribution to Climate Finance; and CIFs website: 
www.climateinvestmentfunds.org (accessed December 2014). Sectors targeted by green ODA in Zambia This section details the sectors that DAC member countries are targeting with their green ODA. This 
analysis can be used to inform and assess the extent of alignment between the sectors prioritised by the 
government of Zambia and those targeted by providers' interventions. The issue of alignment has been 
scantly studied in the case of green ODA (but see Thornston et al., 2011 who look at climate finance in 
various African countries; Terpstra et al., 2013 who explore national adaptation priorities and international 
adaptation finance flows in Zambia and other developing countries; or Drutschinin and Casado-Asensio, 
forthcoming, who study biodiversity-related development co-operation in Zambia and other developing 
countries). Alignment implies that providers base their support on partner countries' national development 
strategies, institutions and processes (see Box 2). For example, providers aim to increasingly use country 
systems for programmes managed by the public sector. In return, partner countries improve the quality and 
transparency of their public financial management systems. A lack of alignment leads to unsustainable 
outcomes, as well as undermining national institutions and processes; while alignment reflects efforts to 
build the institutional strength of partner countries (Birdsall and Kharas, 2014). By supporting this 
dimension, providers signal their willingness to make a long-term investment in partners' ability to develop 
and implement their own strategies. In the case of Zambia, there is alignment between the sectors targeted by providers and with those 
highlighted by the Zambian government in the FNDP and SNDP. Inter alia, the FNDP (2006-10) 
highlighted agriculture, while the SNDP (2011-15) also highlighted energy, fisheries, livestock, tourism, 
transport and the water sectors (see Table 1). Providers have been consistently prioritising agriculture, 23 forestry, fishing and rural development over 2010-12 (22% of all green ODA to Zambia, or USD 39 
million on average per year over that period, primarily driven by agriculture). Following this, are the 
sectors of water supply and sanitation and energy (each accounting for 19%, or USD 35 million), transport 
and storage (7%, or USD 14 million), general environmental protection (4%, or USD 7 million), other 
social infrastructure and services (4%, or USD 6 million) and trade and tourism (3% or USD 6 million; see 
Chart 5). Chart 5. Total green-related ODA by sector 2010-2012, bilateral commitments Source: OECD DAC CRS, September 2014. Note: 1) General budget support interventions are not targeted at a specific sector. In 
principle, the Rio marker methodology cannot be applied to this  " sector " , hence the data presented is only partial; 2) General 
Environmental Protection includes support to environmental research, education, policy and administration management; 3) The 
Other Social Infrastructure and Services category comprises social and welfare services, employment policy and administrative 
management, housing policy and administrative management, low-cost housing, and multi-sector ODA for basic social services. Priorities for allocating green ODA can also be assessed based on the extent to which environmental 
considerations have been integrated into development co-operation support. Total sector support between 
2004 and 2012 shows that environmental considerations are well integrated into ODA supporting a number 
of key sectors for Zambia's development -based on the share of total ODA to each sectors that targets a 
green objectives (Chart 6) -such as forestry (99%), energy (95%), water supply and sanitation (67%), 
tourism (61%) or agriculture (54%). For example: @BULLET Agriculture is a key sector in Zambia. It was declared the  " engine of income expansion in the 
economy "  by both the FNDP and SNDP (Government of Zambia, 2006a, 2010a), yet is also seen 
as being particularly vulnerable to climate change. The draft National Climate Change Response 
Strategy (Government of Zambia, 2010b) and the Strategic Programme on Climate Resilience 
(Climate Investment Funds, 2011), were in fact developed to implement the NDPs and to 
prioritise agriculture (see Watson et al., 2012; UN-HABITAT, 2014). @BULLET Green support to the forestry sector predominantly comes from Finland to build government 
capacity to value, map and sustainably manage the country's forests (Leventon, et al., 2014). This 
is aligned with the government's Zambia Forestry Action Plan and National Forest Policy of 
1998 aiming to achieve Joint Forest Management in Zambia. 24 @BULLET The high share of green ODA in the energy sector can be attributed to the expansion of energy 
access from hydro-power (Zambia is a water rich-country, accounting for 40% of the water 
resources of Southern Africa; UN-HABITAT, 2014), and to the government's intentions to 
continue expanding hydro-power and biofuel plants during the SNDP period (Government of 
Zambia, 2010a) and to climate-proof existing infrastructure (e.g. so that droughts do not impact 
negatively on energy generation which in turn affects industrial production). @BULLET ODA to water supply and sanitation, but also to the transport and storage sector, have a green 
dimension in Zambia because providers have focused on climate-proofing existing infrastructure, 
as prioritised by the government's SNDP (Government of Zambia, 2010a). For example, 
transport interventions comprise three environmental assessments funded by the United States, 
plus other activities focusing on road construction and rehabilitation funded by Denmark and 
Japan to ensure that the increased frequency and severity of floods does not destroy roads as has 
happened in the past. Chart 6. Percentage of ODA targeting green objectives by sector 2010-12, bilateral commitments Source: OECD DAC CRS, September 2014 25 Providers' activities also coincide with respect to the emphasis placed upon capacity-building. Indeed, 
many small-volume activities also focus on the General Environmental Protection sector, 11 which is 
identified as the centrepiece to develop the FNDP, SNDP and the IGGS (Banda and Bass, 2014). In fact, 
19% of all green ODA to Zambia over 2010-12 had capacity-building as its objective. 12 Three notable 
activities in this sector are: @BULLET A programme funded by the United Kingdom's Department for International Development 
(DfID) to integrate climate resilience into development planning, and to provide support to 
priority public and private climate-proofed investments. This programme ran over 2009-12 and 
targeted climate change mitigation and biodiversity as principal objectives. The programme 
included contracting a consultant to identify links between climate change and development, and 
to suggest appropriate policies. @BULLET A programme led by the Finnish Environmental Institute to support institutional capacity 
building in the then Ministry of Tourism, Environment and Natural Resources (MTENR). The 
programme was implemented during 2009-12 and comprised five mutually defined components: 
improving human resource management (including training on environmental monitoring), 
environmental information management, strategic environmental assessment, biodiversity and the 
implementation of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna 
and Flora and the Basel, Stockholm, and Rotterdam Conventions. @BULLET Finally, in 2010, the United States Department of Agriculture provided support to reduce 
pollution across multiple sectors. The initiative set out to improve environmental sustainability. 
By reducing environmental risks, the programme aimed to reduce health costs and ecosystem 
loss. Notwithstanding the observed sectoral alignment and the emphasis placed to develop domestic-level 
capacity, there are also a number of gaps, for example: @BULLET Mining, which has a high impact on Zambia's economy and environment (Aongola et al., 2009). 
Zambia's mining sector is specialised on the extraction of copper and cobalt. Mining activity 
consumes substantial volumes of electricity (Kivyiro and Arminen, 2014), primarily relying on 
hydro-power in Zambia and making the sector vulnerable to water scarcity and climate change. 
Despite recent signs of a green transformation in this sector (AfDB and OECD, 2013) and the 
fact that mining sites have to perform environmental impact assessments (Government of 
Zambia, 2011a), change is slow and enforcement of environmental legislation poor (Leventon et 
al., 2014); and the sector struggles to manage waste (AfDB and OECD, 2013). @BULLET Tourism has the potential to be an effective means for achieving economic and social 
development in destination areas, notably through community-based eco-tourism (Lachlan and 
Binns, 2014). Although the data show that over 2010-12, 61% of all interventions had a green 
objective, the volume devoted to the sector was small (under USD 100,000 over 2010-12), owing 11 General Environmental Protection includes support to environmental research, education, policy and administration 
management. 12 Although there is no specific sector code for capacity building in the OECD DAC CRS, it has been estimated here 
based on all green activities that target policy and administrative management, research, education and training, 
public/financial institutions and access to financial services. For completeness, the CRS sub-sectors  " statistical 
capacity building "  and  " agricultural extension "  were also added. 26 to a Japanese intervention aiming to improve tourism policy and administrative management. No 
green intervention had been recorded in this sector previously, despite being mentioned already 
in the FNDP; and the fact that tourism may help Zambia diversify its economy and decouple its 
development from fluctuations in the world price of copper and other raw materials. @BULLET Urban development, according to a recent review of DAC CRS data looking for interventions 
targeting climate change adaptation at urban level for the years 2010-12, no explicit projects 
could be identified on the matter in Lusaka, Ndola or Kitwe, despite high levels of vulnerability 
and the prioritisation of interventions at this level by the government (UN-HABITAT, 2014). 13 Instruments used for green ODA The majority of green ODA over 2004-12 (87%) is committed through grants (Chart 7). While ODA to 
biodiversity, climate change adaptation, and desertification only takes the form of grants (see e.g. Teprstra 
et al. 2013), 40% of the ODA targeting climate change mitigation takes the form of concessional loans. 
This is in line with Zambia's Aid Policy and Strategy, which states that  " although it is the policy of the 
country to progressively reduce its dependence on external assistance, the government shall give 
preference to grants as opposed to loans "  (Government of Zambia, 2005). The government also targets 
concessional finance and loans with a minimum 35% grant element (Government of Zambia, 2005). Chart 7. Green-related ODA by instrument 2004-12, bilateral commitments Source: OECD DAC CRS, September 2014 The majority of green bilateral ODA consists of project-type interventions (57%). Green ODA is also 
channelled through general budget support. Data collected within the OECD DAC CRS is only partial 
reflecting that the  " Rio markers "  are not applicable to general budget support – but available data suggests 
that at least USD 26 million per year on average over 2010-12 has been channelled as green ODA through 
general budget support, consisting of four large Poverty Reduction Budget Support transfers from Finland 
and Germany. 13 This finding is based on a review of ODA activities within DAC members' climate change adaptation portfolios 
that target cities of over 500,000 inhabitants. Over 200 out of 1600 activities (above USD 50,000) were identified 
as targeting urban areas, based on the methodological approach developed for this study. This number may be 
considered a lower bound, owing to limited information available to identify the location of some ODA activities 
(OECD, 2014d). For further information see: http://oe.cd/RioMarkers 27 CO-ORDINATION AND MAINSTREAMING OF GREEN ODA IN ZAMBIA Providers have made considerable progress in ensuring harmonisation amongst their green activities and to 
align these with Zambia's priorities through a provider co-ordination group, the Joint Assistance Strategy 
for Zambia (JASZ) (Aogonda et al. 2009). The JASZ responds to broader concerns from the development 
co-operation community that providers' practices did not always fit well with national development 
priorities and systems such as budget, programme and project planning cycles (see Box 2). The demands 
on partner countries to meet with different providers' objectives, reporting processes and procedures, along 
with uncoordinated country analytical work and missions may create excessive transaction costs and 
reduce the effectiveness of development co-operation. Providers and partner countries therefore have 
recognised that urgent, co-ordinated and sustained action is required to reduce overlap, waste and 
fragmentation among providers and to reduce the burden placed upon partner countries (Birdsall and 
Kharas, 2014). This section explores the green activities of the JASZ since 2007 and how this has helped 
mainstream green activities into the portfolios of development co-operation providers. Provider co-ordination efforts: the Joint Assistance Strategy for Zambia The JASZ is an instrument developed by 16 DAC and multilateral providers to co-ordinate their activities 
and align these with the country's national development priorities. The Strategy is periodically reviewed 
and updated with the introduction of successive NDPs. There are no specific projects under the JASZ, 
rather the co-operating partners use the JASZ to inform their development co-operation projects and 
programmes in-country (Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Denmark, 2010). Joint Assistance Strategy for Zambia I: 2007-2010 The first JASZ I and its priority sectors were based on the FNDP. According to the agreed division of 
labour, the Nordic countries were meant to work on green issues; the EU, the US, Sweden, and the 
development banks supported the agriculture sector; while the Netherlands, development banks and the 
UK supported private sector development (Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Finland, 2010). Co-operating 
partners also committed to increase their funding of green issues. In line with the FNDP, the co-operating 
partners together with the government of Zambia, civil society and the private sector identified the 
following priority areas as a target for green ODA (Irish Aid, 2008; Aongola et al., 2009; Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs of Denmark, 2010): @BULLET increasing capacity building efforts and funding for environmental planning and mainstreaming; @BULLET introducing strategic environmental assessments at the national and sector levels, and 
strengthening the application of environmental impact assessments, including participatory 
approaches, to ensure the effective mainstreaming of green issues; @BULLET carrying out joint analytical work with the government to support knowledge management; @BULLET focusing on fisheries, forests, land, renewable energy and wildlife, and ensuring sufficient 
attention is paid to climate change adaptation. The co-operating partners' targeting of these priorities were meant to assist Zambia in achieving 
Millennium Development Goal 7 (Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Denmark, 2010). Additionally, Zambia 
worked to reform and enhance the capacity of its government institutions, including its statutory bodies 28 aiming to help fulfil their mandates; to strengthen cross-sectoral co-ordination mechanisms; to address 
equity and transparency issues in the access and control of resources; to capture the contribution of green 
issues on the national economy and its impact in poverty alleviation; and to assess the impact of natural 
resource base degradation on growth pillars such as agriculture and tourism (Ministry of Foreign Affairs of 
Denmark, 2010). The Strategy led to a more structured process to support the green dimension in Zambian development 
policy and its strategy (Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Denmark, 2010). As a mechanism, the JASZ I 
helped identify improvements in provider activity and in providing an effective model for greater sector-
level co-ordination on green issues (Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Denmark, 2010). Information sharing 
through the JASZ I reduced duplication of activities and, where relevant, provided more co-ordinated 
support to the development of government systems. The dialogue architecture that emerged from the 
Strategy made a considerable contribution to encouraging harmonisation. Indeed, the co-operating 
partners' troika structure, whereby three co-operating partners represent the JASZ I signatories in dialogue 
with the government of Zambia, was generally perceived as successful and as having improved the flow of 
information (Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Denmark, 2010). However, the co-operating partners identified generic drawbacks that significantly weakened its ability to 
achieve its objectives (Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Denmark, 2010): @BULLET The Strategy neither contains specific targets nor does it define indicators against which progress 
can be measured. A work plan was developed in late 2007 and some of its elements were 
implemented. However, no work plans and no systematic processes to follow up on the 
commitments and actions were subsequently agreed. @BULLET The government of Zambia was initially neither a signatory to the JASZ I nor to the work plan, 
despite the success of the JASZ I depending on governmental actions. In addition, there were 
doubts regarding the government's leadership in this process and the capacity for the Ministry of 
Finance and National Planning (MoFNP) to manage ODA (Ministry of Foreign Affairs of 
Denmark, 2010). The government is now aware of this and has taken steps to develop a 
mechanism for taking an effective cross-sector strategic view on green ODA issues and has 
anchored these responsibilities within the MoFNP. @BULLET Existing consultative mechanisms are driven by co-operating partners and often do not respect 
governmental processes. The requirements of providers still dictate many actions and a number 
of important decisions are taken bilaterally, which undermine JASZ I processes. The risks were 
that the JASZ I may have resulted in leaving green issues entirely up to a few providers to lead, 
offering vague mainstreaming promises for the portfolio of other providers engaged with the 
JASZ I but not leading on green issues (European Commission, 2007). 29 Joint Assistance Strategy for Zambia II: 2011-2015 JASZ II builds on the lessons learned from JASZ I, as well as on priorities identified in the SNDP. JASZ II 
aims to channel co-operating partners' investment in Zambia to: address rural poverty and inclusive 
growth; support Zambia's longer term transition away from ODA; introduce a more robust focus on 
performance measurement and ensure management accountability; and improve the flow and quality of 
information and dialogue between co-operating partners and the government of Zambia and other local 
non-state actors (Co-operating Partners to the JASZ II, 2011). In an effort to improve the effectiveness and 
harmonisation of the JASZ with national processes, the government has committed to managing the 
division of labour among co-operating partners in the various sectors (Co-operating Partners to the JASZ 
II, 2011). In the energy sector, co-operating partners commit to expanding generation capacity in the power sector 
and to scaling up access to clean, modern energy, primarily in rural areas. Co-operating partners will focus 
on supporting the government's efforts to exploit cost-effective hydro-power generation and transmission, 
strengthening the framework of ensuring an efficient and effective fuel supply system, including through 
locally produced, sustainable biofuels, in line with the SNDP (Co-operating Partners to the JASZ II, 2011). 
Co-operating partners will also continue to support the development of policies and legislation, and 
increase community, civil society and private sector participation in forestry, wildlife and national heritage 
to enhance sustainable management of natural resources. Co-operating partners will focus on the following 
key areas, namely: @BULLET Mainstreaming green issues into the planning, programming and budgetary frameworks for 
central economic growth sectors by promoting strategic policy dialogue, joint planning and 
programming on green issues, in particular to develop the capacity for climate resilience and low 
carbon development; @BULLET Conducting ecosystem assessments to inform green decision making and investments; @BULLET Developing monitoring and performance assessment indicators to track implementation of green 
programmes across sectors; @BULLET Supporting fiscal and market based incentive mechanisms to improve green management, in 
particular in pollution control and waste management; @BULLET Intensifying the implementation of adaptation and mitigation initiatives as well as positioning the 
country to benefit from climate financing opportunities (e.g., the Green Climate Fund; Co-
operating Partners to the JASZ II, 2011). 30 With the elections of 2011, however, ministerial portfolios and mandates changed, with implications for 
the implementation of the JASZ II (Watson et al., 2013). For example, after a period of uncertainty the 
Ministry of Tourism, Environment and Natural Resources (MTENR) became the Ministry of Lands, 
Natural Resources and Environmental Protection. The MTENR had led the preparation of the National 
Climate Change Response Strategy since 2010 and had received support from Norway and the United 
Nations Development Programme (UNDP) to establish a Facilitation Unit to co-ordinate climate change 
activities in-country. With the governmental change, departments were reshuffled and annual departmental 
and line budgets were housed in different ministries (Watson et al., 2013). In turn, this has slowed the 
drafting and implementation of many JASZ II proposals. Notwithstanding this, the government of Zambia 
has remained engaged with the green agenda and created an Interim National Climate Change Secretariat, 
now housed in the Ministry of Finance. The Secretariat is the focal point for developing the Zambian IGGS 
and co-ordinates all international and domestic green programmes and projects with the JASZ II (e.g. the 
USAID Low Emissions Development Strategy, the PPCR (see Box 3), or the UN Joint Climate Project 
REDD-Low Emissions Capacity Building Programme). Provider strategies to mainstream green issues into development co-operation Green issues have been at the centre of many DAC providers' ODA activities in Zambia. Chart 8 illustrates 
the top nine green providers, accounting for 97% of total green bilateral ODA to Zambia over 2004-12. 
Norway, Japan and Germany are the largest providers in absolute terms, and together account for 53% of 
green ODA to Zambia. It is important to note that Japan, Norway, Denmark and Finland commit the 
largest amount of ODA targeting green objectives as a principal objective over the same period. Green 
ODA as a proportion of a provider's total ODA portfolio gives an indication of the priority that this 
provider is placing on green issues. By this measure, Finland stands out in dedicating about 41% of its total 
ODA commitments to Zambia to green issues, followed by Denmark and Norway (each 37%). This 
reflects the division of labour of the JASZ I. Chart 8.

Note: For technical reasons, data collection on green ODA for the

terms, Denmark, Finland and Norway, illustrates how provider activities align with the green priorities of 
the Zambian government. Their interventions have taken various forms, ranging from planning and goal 
setting support to promoting policy change, institutional capacity building and reform, monitoring and 
evaluation (see Table 3). 32 Table 3. Selected green development co-operation interventions in Zambia Denmark Intervention

Achieving this will likely depend upon how Zambia manages its natural assets, controls pollution and 
prepares for the impacts of climate change. In addition to a range of existing green plans and policies, 
Zambia aims to develop an explicit and comprehensive Inclusive Green Growth Strategy, to ensure that 
future development and growth takes green considerations more centrally into account. Importantly, 
Zambia aims to ensure that the green dimension of economic growth and well-being is fully integrated and 
has a higher profile in its development plans (see OECD, 2013 on the rationale for doing so). The process 
of formulating this Strategy provides an opportunity to assess the environmental sustainability of existing 
growth patterns and to identify the structural changes needed in the economy to ensure growth and poverty 
reduction, while also protecting the environment. This process could not only build upon past domestic 
experience with green policy-making and mainstreaming of environmental objectives into sector policies, 
but also upon the experience of the international development co-operation community. Indeed, support 
from the international development co-operation community has been increasingly important in Zambia 
since 2004. This paper reviewed to what extent development co-operation activities are aligned with Zambian priorities 
and needs. The statistical analysis provided here finds that green ODA has targeted some of the economic 
engines of Zambia (e.g. agriculture, forestry) and has significantly contributed to  " greening "  other key 
domestic sectors, such as energy, water supply and sanitation, or transport. Furthermore, providers have 
supported a range of capacity building activities, including environmental policy and legislation 
formulation, data management, resource valuing, community engagement and benefit-sharing in the green 
space. These activities are strongly aligned with the country's Long-Term Vision and its various National 
Development Plans (see also Co-operating Partners to the JASZ I, 2007; Co-operating Partners to the 
JASZ II, 2011). There is evidence, too, that alignment was informed by the Joint Assistance Strategy for 
Zambia (JASZ). The JASZ I and II has helped co-ordinate 16 DAC providers active in Zambia, has 
avoided the duplication of green projects and programmes, and has improved the information flow with the 
government (Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Denmark, 2010). Despite strong alignment with Zambian priorities, the paper shows there is scope for further alignment 
with Zambian priorities, and of co-ordination among providers and with the government (Mulenga, 2013). 
First, virtually no green bilateral ODA flowed to a number of key sectors for the Zambian economy, such 
as mining, industry or tourism. The mining sector, in particular, is crucial for it generates up to 30% of 
Zambia's GDP, creates substantial amounts of waste and pollution, and is vulnerable to water scarcity and 
climate change. Second, green ODA has not yet demonstrated a link to the overarching developmental goal 
of reducing poverty in Zambia. Poverty reduction is expected to require a private sector role (Kivuitu et al., 
2005), yet little is known about the activities of development co-operation providers to help make this link. 
Third, development co-operation places relatively low emphasis on the mainstreaming of green issues into 
local-level institutions and planning processes (Terpstra et al. 2013; UN-HABITAT, 2014). This is 
especially true at the urban level, where no projects could be identified in 2010-12, despite heightened 
vulnerability at this level. Finally, the JASZ worked in an iterative manner to refine its approach and align 
its work with Zambian priorities but struggled with Zambian bureaucracy, staff rotation and delays in the 
process of working with line ministries. Strengthening the capacity of the Zambian government and its 
institutions to more closely work with the JASZ could help to make development co-operation more 
effective. 36 These findings can support and inform the national agenda for action in Zambia to advance its green 
growth agenda and Inclusive Green Growth Strategy (IGGS). They can also assist providers of 
development co-operation to better target their activities. Notwithstanding this, further analytical work 
could benefit the IGGS process. First, it would be important to understand how ODA dependence on green 
matters is perceived by the Zambian government (e.g. exploring if the government interested in building 
sufficient capacity and political support for green goals, the potential for self-or co-financing such 
activities over time using domestic resources, and the role that providers could take to support these 
developments). Second, and relatedly, Zambia could work with providers to develop, implement, and 
evaluate new types of goals that sustain the  " greening "  of policy and practice over time. By setting clear 
goals, by tracking outcomes or impacts, gaps and improvements regarding the mainstreaming of green 
issues, providers and the Zambian government could improve their ODA effectiveness and better 
understand what green ODA is achieving on the ground. Finally, there is potential to work with Zambian 
stakeholders to understand better the potential pathways to improve harmonisation and alignment of 
development co-operation with Zambian priorities. This could provide lessons, for example, on the 
potential use of country systems, beyond national planning, to channel support; and might begin by 
monitoring and evaluating relevant systems (e.g. mechanisms for internal co-ordination, budgetary and 
financial management, and procurement systems). 37 BIBLIOGRAPHY AfDB (2013), African Development Report 2012: Towards Green Growth in Africa, Tunis: African

Data are reported by members of the OECD DAC, collected through the "Creditor Reporting System" 
(CRS) and identified as using  " Rio markers " , where providers are requested to indicate for each 
development finance activity whether or not it targets environmental objectives. There are four Rio 
markers, covering: biodiversity, desertification, climate change mitigation, and climate change adaptation. A scoring system of three values is used, in which official development finance activities reported to the 
DAC CRS are screened and  " marked "  as either (i) targeting the conventions as a  " principal "  objective or 
(ii) as a  " significant "  objective, or (iii) not targeting the objective. These markers indicate donors' policy 
objectives in relation to each development finance activity. Activities marked as having a  " principal "  
objective would not have been funded but for that objective; activities marked  " significant "  have other 
prime objectives but have been formulated or adjusted to help meet the relevant environmental concerns. The markers provide an indication of the degree of mainstreaming of environmental considerations into 
development co-operation portfolios. In marking the full value of development finance activities the 
markers are considered descriptive rather than strictly quantitative, but allow for an approximate 
quantification of development finance flows that target the Rio convention objectives. In marker data 
presentations the figures for flows targeting objectives as principal or significant can be shown separately 
and the sum referred to as the  " total "  or  " upper bound "  of environmental-related development finance. Climate change mitigation is defined as activities that contribute to the objective of stabilisation of 
greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous 
anthropogenic interference with the climate system by promoting efforts to reduce or limit GHG emissions 
or to enhance GHG sequestration. Climate change adaptation is defined as activities that aim to reduce the vulnerability of human or 
natural systems to the impacts of climate change and climate-related risks, by maintaining or increasing 
adaptive capacity and resilience. This encompasses a range of activities from information and knowledge 
generation, to capacity development, planning and the implementation of climate change adaptation 
actions. Biodiversity is defined as activities that promote at least one of the three objectives of the Convention on 
Biological Diversity: the conservation of biodiversity; sustainable use of its components (ecosystems, 
species or genetic resources); or fair and equitable sharing of the benefits of the utilisation of genetic 
resources. Desertification is defined as activities that aim at combating desertification or mitigating the effects of 
drought in arid, semi-arid or dry sub-humid areas through prevention and/or reduction of land degradation, 
rehabilitation of partly degraded land, or reclamation of desertified land. Environment is defined as activities that are intended to produce an improvement, or something that is 
diagnosed as an improvement, in the physical and/or biological environment of the recipient country, area 43 or target group concerned, or activities that include specific action to integrate environmental concerns 
with a range of development objectives through institution building and/or capacity development. The Rio markers are applicable to Official Development Assistance (ODA) where reporting is mandatory, 
for the mitigation marker from 2007 flows, and for the adaptation marker since 2010. Reporting is 
voluntary on Other Official Flows (OOF) (i.e. non-concessional developmental flows, excluding export 
credits) starting from 2010. A key feature of the marker methodology is that one activity can address several policy objectives at the 
same time. This reflects the fact that the three Rio conventions (targeting global environmental objectives) 
and local environmental objectives are mutually reinforcing, but this overlap poses a problem when 
aggregating data across several markers. The same activity can be marked for e.g. biodiversity and climate change mitigation, or for mitigation and 
adaptation. To avoid double or triple-counting the same activity, aggregate figures for biodiversity-, 
climate change mitigation-, climate change adaptation-and desertification-related aid should not be added 
up. Statistical presentations should either be prepared for one marker at a time, and resulting totals for each 
marker should not be added up – or the overlap should be  " treated " .  " Treating "  the overlap involves 
identifying and deducting the  " overlap " , and requires activity-level data. For more information, see the user guide, available at http://oe.cd/Riomarkers. 44 ANNEX 2: OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL INSTRUMENTS IN ZAMBIA National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan (2006) Aims
