	<div type="abstract">Abstract<lb/> This paper provides, for the first time, estimates of subjective well-being variables in 373 OECD<lb/> subnational regions, allowing comparison of various measures of how people experience and evaluate their<lb/> lives within and across all 34 OECD countries. Different weighting strategies as well as several robustness<lb/> checks have been carried out to ensure regional representativeness and to provide reliable indicators. The<lb/> results show that it is possible to obtain robust regional estimates of subjective well-being through the<lb/> Gallup World Poll for the variables satisfaction with life and social support network. These estimates could<lb/> be included in the OECD Regional Well-Being Database to provide two additional well-being dimensions<lb/> measured uniquely with subjective indicators. In addition to these two variables, the paper explores the<lb/> feasibility of other subjective indicators, either from Gallup or the European Statistics on Income and<lb/> Living Standards (EU SILC), which are particularly meaningful when measured at the city or regional<lb/> levels, such as satisfaction with the living environment, satisfaction with commuting time, trust in the<lb/> political system, and feeling of safety in the community. Finally, a regression analysis is performed to give<lb/> an insight of the explanatory power of both individual and regional specific characteristics to self-reported<lb/> life satisfaction. The results show that regional fixed effects capture around 10 percentage points of the<lb/> variation in life satisfaction, of which 30% can be associated to observable regional characteristics such as<lb/> mortality rate and air pollution. Furthermore, life satisfaction tends to be negatively affected not only by<lb/> the individual unemployment status but also by the level of unemployment of the region; in the OECD<lb/> area, everything else equal, being unemployed is associated with 7 percentage points less of life<lb/> satisfaction compared to someone that is employed; whereas, an increase of 1 percentage point in the<lb/> unemployment rate at the regional level is related with 0.4 percentage points less of satisfaction with life as<lb/> a whole.<lb/> JEL classification codes: I31, R11<lb/></div>
