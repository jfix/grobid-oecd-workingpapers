	<div type="abstract">Abstract<lb/> VOLUNTARY ENVIRONMENTAL AND ORGANIC STANDARDS<lb/> IN AGRICULTURE: POLICY IMPLICATIONS<lb/> S. Rousset, K. Deconinck, H. Jeong and M. von Lampe<lb/> While public regulation in food and agriculture is attracting attention at both policy and<lb/> research level for their potential implications on international food trade, policy implications<lb/> of agricultural standards – understood to be legally not mandatory and hence voluntary – are<lb/> much less well understood. Yet, environmental and organic standards have grown in<lb/> importance in agriculture and agri-food chains, making also their potential trade effects more<lb/> relevant. In this context, understanding the linkages between governments and standards has<lb/> become a key element in the debate.<lb/> This report analyses possible roles of public authorities in the area of environmental and<lb/> organic standards, including policy objectives, options for interaction and means for the use<lb/> of standards for achieving public policy goals. It identifies the main objectives behind<lb/> government activity on environmental and organic standards in the area of consumer<lb/> protection and fraud prevention, the enabling of functioning food markets and the<lb/> improvement of efficiency in the design, implementation and monitoring of public policies.<lb/> Countries have taken very different approaches towards dealing with standards on organic<lb/> agriculture which frequently, though not always, are seen as a subset of environment-related<lb/> standards. Choices for organic standards range between market self-regulation and the<lb/> development of government-owned public standards. More generally, the level of public<lb/> intervention often reflects OECD governments&apos; perception on the environmental benefits of<lb/> organic agriculture itself.<lb/></div>

	<p type="introduction">JEL: M38, Q13, Q17, Q58<lb/> This work has benefited from substantial input from officials of agricultural and<lb/> environment ministries, from private standard owners in OECD countries, Argentina and the<lb/> European Commission. It was carried out under the direction of Frank van Tongeren, Head<lb/> of the Policies in Trade and Agriculture Division in the OECD Trade and Agriculture<lb/> Directorate. In addition, the authors wish to thank Carmel Cahill, Guillaume Gruère and Ron<lb/> Steenblik for valuable comments and suggestions in various stages of the work. Editorial<lb/> assistance was provided by Martina Abderrahmane.<lb/> The final report and its Annexes have benefitted from discussions in the OECD Joint<lb/> Working Party on Agriculture and Trade, where they were declassified in March 2015.
