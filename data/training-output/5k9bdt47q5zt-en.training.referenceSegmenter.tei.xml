        <bibl><label>1.</label><lb/> Countries included are: Austria, Belgium, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary (2007),<lb/> </bibl>
<bibl>Ireland, Italy, Luxemburg, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Spain, Slovenia, the Slovak Republic, Sweden and the UK.<lb/> 2.<lb/> The sub-sample includes all countries for which comparable data is available from the mid-1980s (baseline 1 in Table 8).<lb/> </bibl>

<bibl>In 2008 the Gini index for the European Union was 0.33 (Table 6). This is broadly in line with<lb/> previous findings in the scarce literature that exists on EU inequality (Table 7). Some differences are to be<lb/> expected as the studies do not always include the same countries, nor refer to the same time period.<lb/> </bibl>
<bibl>Unsurprisingly, the result obtained (0.33) is higher than inequality calculated both as a simple average of<lb/> national Gini indexes (0.29) and a population-weighted average (0.31) since the latter two methods do not<lb/> take into account the between-country component of European inequality.<lb/> Inequality in Europe is somewhat higher compared with the average national Gini indicator for the<lb/> OECD as whole which is 0.30. However, if one constrains the comparison to economies of comparable<lb/> size, which is probably more relevant, the European Union appears less unequal. In 2008, the Gini index<lb/> for the United States was 0.38. The difference appears to be in both ends of distribution, as both the top<lb/> and bottom deciles are closer to the median in Europe. Lower inequality in Europe than in the United<lb/> States is also what the literature tends to find (Table 7).<lb/> </bibl>
