	<div type="abstract">ABSTRACT<lb/> Prices for commodities such as minerals and metals have increased significantly over the past<lb/> few years. At the same time, there has also been an increase in restrictions on the export of raw materials<lb/> which has led policy makers and business people to address free trade of raw materials. This paper<lb/> provides information on the present situation regarding the use of export restrictions and international<lb/> disciplines on these measures. Export restrictions are maintained to achieve diverse policy objectives,<lb/> including environmental protection or conservation of natural resources, promotion of downstream<lb/> processing industries, controlling inflationary pressures, and for fiscal receipts reasons. Export restrictions<lb/> take various forms such as export duties, quantitative restrictions, and licensing requirements. The number<lb/> of countries applying export duties over the period 2003-2009 was higher than in previous years and that<lb/> such duties were introduced primarily by developing and least developed countries. Under the current<lb/> WTO rules, unlike quantitative export restrictions which are in principle prohibited, there is no substantive<lb/> discipline on export duties, although there have been efforts to revise this at the multilateral and bilateral<lb/> levels. The WTO accession process imposes several disciplines. Export restrictions have also been<lb/> discussed during the DDA negotiations in both NAMA (Non-Agricultural Market Access) and agriculture<lb/> negotiations. Several regional trade agreements (RTAs) went beyond the WTO by including prohibition of<lb/> export duties. Export restrictions, by creating a differential between the price available to domestic<lb/> processors and the price charged to foreign processors, provide domestic processing industries with an<lb/> advantage. Although several governments apply export restrictions to achieve diverse policy objectives,<lb/> not all rely on such restrictions. Alternative policy options with different trade impacts are used. In view of<lb/> the significant impacts of export restrictions on global supply chains, transparency on the use and<lb/> implementation of such measures should be substantially improved.<lb/></div>

In view of the significant impacts of export<lb/> restrictions on global supply chains, transparency regarding the use and implementation of the measures<lb/> should be substantially improved.</p>
