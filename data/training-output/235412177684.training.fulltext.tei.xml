			<head>1. Conclusions and messages for policy makers<lb/></head>

			<p>Although this summary does not pretend to present a unanimous or<lb/> negotiated position for the participants at the Round Table, a number of<lb/> conclusions did enjoy broad support.<lb/></p>

			<head>Performance of biofuels in reducing greenhouse gas emissions<lb/></head>

			<p>Discussions at the Round Table underlined the wide range of performance of<lb/> biofuels in terms of life-cycle energy and greenhouse gas emission balances.<lb/> Performance differs between fuels and even for a single fuel and feedstock,<lb/> performance varies greatly according to production process and farming<lb/> practice. In the worst cases biofuels result in significantly higher emissions of<lb/> greenhouse gases than gasoline or diesel.<lb/></p>

			<p>The discussions also identified a wide range of uncertainty in the estimation of<lb/> emissions of CO 2 from the soil and emissions of N 2 O in the cultivation of<lb/> feedstocks. These emissions vary according to soil type and farming<lb/> technique and can account for a large part of the overall greenhouse gas<lb/> emissions for some conventional biofuels.<lb/> For biofuels that provide relatively low greenhouse gas abatement (up to<lb/> around 30%), such as ethanol produced from corn and many other grains, the<lb/> range of uncertainty can be larger than the average expected benefit.<lb/> Therefore there is a risk that such fuels provide no benefit or even produce<lb/> higher rates of greenhouse gas emissions than oil products.<lb/></p>

			<p>On a small scale, biofuels are currently produced from whey and waste<lb/> cooking oil with relatively large greenhouse gas savings compared to fossil<lb/> fuels, of around 70%. The only large-scale production of biofuels to approach<lb/> this level of performance is Brazilian sugar cane ethanol. However, it requires<lb/> tax subsidies to be viable, amounting to around USD 1 billion a year.<lb/> Most other large-scale biofuel production (ethanol from sugar beet and<lb/> sorghum; biodiesel from rape, soy and palm oil) achieves around 30% to 50%<lb/> greenhouse gas savings, but require large subsidies.<lb/></p>

			<head>Costs and alternative policies<lb/></head>

			<p>Views differed over just how much biofuel could be produced sustainably. But<lb/> most biofuels are expensive, particularly when environmental costs are<lb/> factored in. Only at sustained high oil prices are biofuels likely to be produced<lb/> commercially. With subsidies restricted to a level that reflects their contribution<lb/> to greenhouse gas mitigation, much production would cease.<lb/> Improving energy efficiency in transport has much greater potential, and at<lb/> lower cost, than promoting biofuels for reducing energy supply vulnerability<lb/> and reducing greenhouse gas emissions.<lb/> Taxes related to the carbon content of fuels, including for biofuels, would also<lb/> be more cost-effective than subsidies or biofuel targets as they target CO 2<lb/> emissions directly. Fuel-excise tax systems are very similar to a tax on the<lb/> carbon content of fuels, albeit at a high rate in some cases. In Europe, current<lb/> excise rates are roughly equivalent to a carbon tax on petrol and diesel of<lb/> around Euro 200/t CO 2-eq , around ten times the current cost of CO 2 in the<lb/> European emissions trading system. Support for ethanol in the USA is<lb/> currently estimated to cost double this level at the country&apos;s best performing<lb/> ethanol plants. The same is true for rapeseed biodiesel produced in the EU.<lb/></p>

			<head>Advanced biofuels<lb/></head>

			<p>Future generations of biofuel feedstocks and production processes are likely<lb/> to have lower greenhouse gas emissions and may be more cost-effective.<lb/> Such biofuels may be able to meet up to 10% or 20% of current transport<lb/> energy demand, but no more than this without major advances in technology<lb/> (<ref type="biblio">Jones 2007</ref>).<lb/> Ligno-cellulosic ethanol produced from some feedstocks in pilot plants already<lb/> performs much better than most conventional biofuels in terms of greenhouse<lb/> gas emissions and performs as well as the best Brazilian sugar cane ethanol.<lb/> However, the economics are unproven and for large-scale production the<lb/> potential supply of ligno-cellulosic ethanol is limited by cost and the land<lb/> available for energy crops. There is a rationale for supporting research on<lb/> advanced biofuels but this does not extend to open-ended support.<lb/></p>

			<head>Effectiveness of subsidies<lb/></head>

			<p>Subsidising large-scale production and consumption of conventional biofuels<lb/> fails to deliver a significant contribution to the strategic goals of reducing<lb/> greenhouse gas emissions or improving the security of supply of fuels for<lb/> transport. It is an inefficient way of providing income support to rural<lb/> communities and it consumes large amounts of taxpayers&apos; money<lb/> (USD 4 billion in 2007 in the USA in tax subsidies alone; USD 4 billion in 2006<lb/> in the European Union in tax subsidies; and between USD 13 billion and<lb/> USD 15 billion in the OECD as a whole for support overall), without<lb/> commensurate benefits. Germany has now begun to reduce subsidies for<lb/> biofuels and the United Kingdom is expected to reduce the current excise duty<lb/> differential of 20p/litre (Euro 0.29/litre) over time.<lb/></p>

			<head>Policy reform<lb/></head>

			<p>Volumetric production targets for biofuels fail to provide incentives to contain<lb/> costs, to avoid environmental damage or even to ensure greenhouse gas<lb/> emission reductions are delivered. Carbon content targets for fuels,<lb/> accompanied by certification, are a better alternative.<lb/> California, the Netherlands, Germany, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and<lb/> the European Commission are developing systems of certification to regulate<lb/> the market for biofuels. These systems are aimed at improving environmental<lb/> outcomes. If governments continue to promote biofuels, then greater<lb/> selectivity is needed in the choice of producers and processes to be<lb/> subsidised. Without this refinement of policy, through certification linked to<lb/> subsidies, although there may be progress towards targets for production and<lb/> consumption of biofuels, there will be disappointment in the higher level<lb/> objective of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Moreover there are likely to<lb/> be unwelcome side effects for other sustainability goals.<lb/> It should be noted that certification systems are not well suited to addressing<lb/> the indirect impacts of biofuel production. Certification can only guarantee to<lb/> influence the supply chain. It can be used to modify farming and biomass<lb/> harvesting methods in order to limit the environmental impacts of farming. But<lb/> certification can not be used to control any displacement of existing farming<lb/> activities induced by an expansion of biofuel production, with consequent<lb/> land-use change outside the area farmed to produce biofuel. Separate<lb/> measures will be required to protect valued natural and semi-natural<lb/> ecosystems, from all kinds of development.<lb/></p>

			<p>The range and sometimes poor performance of today&apos;s biofuels in terms of<lb/> greenhouse gas emissions is in part a result of the absence of regulations or<lb/> incentives to select biofuels according to their environmental profile. The<lb/> challenge for the development of biofuel certification systems is to provide<lb/> such incentives cost-effectively.<lb/></p>

			<head>2.<lb/> Introduction<lb/></head>

			<p>Government</p>

			<table>support for the production of biofuels has been motivated<lb/> primarily by agricultural and energy policies with the aim of substituting<lb/> biofuels for imported oil and supporting farm incomes and agricultural sector<lb/> industries. More recently support for biofuels has become a core part of many<lb/> national policies for reducing transport sector CO 2 emissions. The relative<lb/> importance of each driver differs between governments.<lb/> Subsidies for biofuels are growing rapidly and are estimated to have reached<lb/> around USD 15 billion in 2007 for the OECD as a whole. Many Governments<lb/> have also imposed biofuel quotas for oil distributors. The European Union<lb/> requires Member States to take measures to ensure that biofuels account for<lb/> 2% of the demand for transport fuels, rising to 5.75% in 2010. The European<lb/> Commission proposes increasing the target to 10% by 2020 1 . The US<lb/> Government set a target of 4 billion gallons of ethanol for 2006, nearly 3% of<lb/> the gasoline market, and has proposed a target of 35 billion gallons of biofuels<lb/> production by 2017, which is expected to account for about 9% of transport<lb/> sector fuel consumption.<lb/></table>

			<p>However, all biofuels are not equally effective in substituting for oil or in cutting<lb/> greenhouse gas emissions and promoting their production can have<lb/> unintended consequences. Subsidies for biofuels, and the resultant increase<lb/> in demand for grain and oil seeds, appears to have contributed to sharp<lb/> increases in food and livestock feed prices in world markets, in a context of<lb/> rising demand for these commodities for traditional uses. Also, depending on<lb/> feedstock and farming practices, biofuels production can have significant<lb/> environmental costs. These include degradation of biodiversity and soil fertility<lb/> and increased rates of soil erosion, excessive water abstraction and water<lb/> pollution. In some circumstances, biofuel feedstock production can even result<lb/> in a net increase in greenhouse gas emissions.<lb/> The Round Table brought together 50 leading researchers on the science and<lb/> economics of biofuels to examine the potential for these fuels to fulfil the<lb/> policy expectations underlying their promotion, to analyse the economics of<lb/> biofuels supply and to assess the potential to limit the environmental costs of<lb/> large-scale production. In this context the Round Table reviewed progress on<lb/> certification systems designed to limit unintended environmental damage from<lb/> producing and promoting biofuels.<lb/></p>

			<p>The discussions, chaired by Lyn Martin of the Australian Bureau of Transport<lb/> and Regional Economics, focused on the following themes:<lb/></p>

			<p>– The energy and greenhouse gas impacts of producing biofuels and<lb/> substituting them for oil products in the transport sector.<lb/></p>

			<p>– The economics of biofuels.<lb/></p>

			<p>1. The European Council has endorsed the proposal subject to the development of<lb/> sustainability standards, second generation biofuels becoming commercially available and<lb/> amendment of the Fuel Quality Directive to allow for adequate levels of blending.<lb/></p>

			<p>– The potential of second generation fuels.<lb/></p>

			<p>– The potential for Brazilian ethanol exports.<lb/></p>

			<p>– Certification and the potential for linking support to performance.<lb/></p>

			<p>– The policy implications of the discussions.<lb/></p>

			<p>The debate was structured around five papers, each addressing one of these<lb/> themes. Presentations based on each of the papers are available at<lb/> http://www.cemt.org/JTRC/EconomicResearch/RoundTables/index.htm<lb/></p>

			<head>3. Energy and greenhouse gas impacts<lb/></head>

			<p>The Round Table began with a review of the research on the life-cycle energy<lb/> balance and greenhouse gas emissions of producing biofuels for transport<lb/> markets. Discussions were launched by Professor Alex Farrell of the<lb/> University of California Berkeley who highlighted the mixed results of the<lb/> research and identified the critical parameters on which the results depend.<lb/></p>

			<p>The team at Berkeley&apos;s Energy and Resources Group (ERG) undertook a<lb/> detailed comparison of six representative studies of US corn-ethanol<lb/> greenhouse gas and energy balances (<ref type="biblio">Farrell et al. 2006</ref>), with the results first<lb/> reported in the journal Science in 2006. Four of the six studies found that<lb/> producing and consuming biofuels for transport results in higher greenhouse<lb/> gas emissions than producing and consuming gasoline (see light coloured<lb/> circles above the horizontal line in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>). Average impacts ranged from a<lb/> 20% decrease to a 32% increase in greenhouse gas emissions. In terms of<lb/> net energy balance, two of the studies found that corn ethanol required more<lb/> fossil fuel to produce than the energy it contains (light circles to the left of the<lb/> vertical line in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>). Though all of the studies found net oil savings, a lot<lb/> of gas or coal was consumed in processing biomass to produce ethanol.<lb/></p>

			<p>The comparison set out to standardise the reported results by normalizing the<lb/> assumptions on which the studies were based. The key differences identified<lb/> concern the boundary conditions employed in the studies (i.e. decisions on<lb/> which parts of the overall production system to include or exclude from the<lb/> analysis) and assumptions regarding:<lb/></p>

			<p>– The prime energy used in bio-refineries – natural gas, oil, electricity or<lb/> coal, with widely differing thermal efficiencies and associated CO 2<lb/> emissions.<lb/></p>

			<p>– Soil erosion and oxidation of soil carbon as a result of crop cultivation.<lb/></p>

			<p>– Lime application on crop land.<lb/></p>

			<p>– The treatment of co-product energy (the energy content of non-fuel<lb/> co-products).<lb/></p>

			<p>The primary energy source used in the production of biofuels, and particularly<lb/> for distilling ethanol, is a major determinant of greenhouse gas impact. Boiler<lb/> efficiencies, which vary widely, also account for some of the variation in<lb/> performance. In most locations natural gas or electricity provides the energy<lb/> for process heat. However, high prices for gas have resulted in some new<lb/> ethanol facilities using coal in the</p>

			<table>American Midwest, with large associated<lb/> greenhouse gas emissions. In Brazil, bagasse (sugar cane waste) is burnt to<lb/> provide process heat and electric power and this is in large part responsible<lb/> for the superior performance of Brazilian ethanol production (see the paper<lb/> prepared for the Round Table by Professor Almeida) 2 .<lb/></table>

			<p>The ERG team developed a meta-model to compare the results of all the<lb/> studies on the basis of consistent assumptions. Adjustments were made in<lb/> relation to:<lb/></p>

			<p>– Primary energy inputs.<lb/></p>

			<p>– System boundaries (by adding missing parameters such as effluent<lb/> processing energy and dropping some extraneous parameters).<lb/></p>

			<p>– Co-product energy content.<lb/> Adjusting for the different assumptions brings the results of the US corn-<lb/>ethanol studies closer to convergence (see dark circles in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>). However,<lb/> it does not alter their absolute position. Except in one case, studies that found<lb/> 2. Very recently, some European ethanol producers have introduced semi-permeable<lb/> membrane technology to replace distillation, with large energy savings.<lb/></p>

			<p>negative energy balances and higher greenhouse gas emissions compared<lb/> with producing and using gasoline (to the left of and above the red lines)<lb/> maintain these negative results after correction. Half the studies show<lb/> negative greenhouse gas emission balances after correction.<lb/> The ERG team selected what it viewed as the best data from the original<lb/> studies to create three case-studies with their model (<ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>):<lb/></p>

			<p>– Ethanol Today using typical values for current US corn-ethanol<lb/> production.<lb/></p>

			<p>– CO 2 -Intensive based on plans to ship Nebraska corn to a lignite-<lb/>powered ethanol plant in North Dakota.<lb/></p>

			<p>– Cellulosic using data from Wang&apos;s study for ligno-cellulosic ethanol<lb/> produced from switchgrass.<lb/></p>

			<p>These additional points were used to show that greenhouse gas emissions<lb/> can differ tenfold according to the feedstock used to produce ethanol. The<lb/> case studies also illustrate the strong sensitivity of the results to the carbon<lb/> intensity of the fuel used to heat the processing and distillation processes,<lb/> with coal-fired and transport-intensive production labelled &apos;CO 2 intensive&apos;. This<lb/> scenario includes the long-distance shipping of corn by rail with diesel<lb/> traction. Transport becomes an increasingly important aspect of life-cycle<lb/> analysis as the size of biofuel plants increases and feedstock has to be<lb/> transported from an increasingly large area. For instance, some of the large<lb/> plants on the Gulf of Mexico rely on corn brought from the Midwest by rail.<lb/> Residual animal feedstock (distillers grain) also often has to be transported<lb/> long distances to cattle farms.<lb/></p>

			<p>Biofuels are ranked by their respective GHG emission reductions. In the left hand diagram, fuels with total<lb/> GHG emission reductions of more than 50% compared to petrol are shown in green, those with GHG<lb/> emissions reductions of more than 30% in yellow, those with GHG emissions reductions of less than 30% in<lb/> orange. In the other diagrams green = better than reference; orange = worse than reference. Cross-hatched<lb/> fields = production paths from waste materials or residues.<lb/></p>

			<figure>Source: Zah et al. 2007.<lb/> The Empa study confirms a number of the points made by Farrell et al.:<lb/></figure>

			<p>– The large range in greenhouse gas performance between different<lb/> fuels and feedstocks.<lb/></p>

			<p>– Corn-ethanol and ethanol produced from rye and potatoes appears to<lb/> provide no greenhouse gas benefits.<lb/></p>

			<p>– Ligno-cellulosic ethanol produced from both grass and wood offers<lb/> potentially far superior greenhouse gas benefits.<lb/></p>

			<p>The study also finds favourable greenhouse gas performance for ethanol<lb/> produced from whey and for biodiesel produced from recycled vegetable oil.<lb/> The other fuels that provide unambiguous greenhouse gas benefits (over 50%<lb/> reductions compared to gasoline or diesel) are ethanol from Brazilian sugar<lb/> cane, from Canadian sorghum and from sugar beet. Biodiesel from US soy,<lb/> Malaysian palm-oil and Swiss rapeseed also perform reasonably well with<lb/> 30-40% reductions of greenhouse gas emissions compared to conventional<lb/> diesel. Rapeseed biodiesel produced in the European Union performs less<lb/> well according to the study (indicated as 100% Rape ME RER in <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<head>Uncertainties<lb/></head>

			<p>Discussions at the Round Table confirmed the wide range of uncertainty in the<lb/> estimation of life-cycle energy and greenhouse gas emission balances for<lb/> biofuels. Most of the uncertainties relate to feedstock production, whilst<lb/> processing of feedstock into fuel is much better understood and can be more<lb/> readily measured.<lb/></p>

			<p>Almost all biofuels today are produced on fertile land that competes with other<lb/> agricultural production. Many Round Table participants felt that the<lb/> uncertainties surrounding greenhouse gas emissions from this type of biofuel<lb/> are so large that no firm conclusions can be drawn on the climate costs and<lb/> benefits of biofuels.<lb/></p>

			<p>Other participants concluded that large uncertainties concern only a few<lb/> parameters (mainly land-use change and emissions of nitrous oxide) and that<lb/> emission ranges can be adequately quantified. In their view, for biofuels<lb/> offering only small greenhouse gas emission benefits (such as corn-based<lb/> ethanol) the uncertainties are sufficient that greenhouse gas emissions may in<lb/> fact exceed those associated with gasoline. Most biofuels, however, achieve<lb/> net emissions reductions, even if these are sometimes small.<lb/></p>

			<p>A recent study by Tad Patzek, using an estimate of the impact of typical US<lb/> corn farming practices, finds that emissions from humus oxidation in soil<lb/> eroded by wind may be the second largest component of emissions from corn<lb/> ethanol production, after emissions from the fuel used for biorefinery process<lb/> energy (<ref type="biblio">Patzek 2007</ref>). New scientific research will be essential in order to<lb/> produce figures specific to other crops and farming practices. New crops and<lb/> new farming methods might reduce greenhouse gas emissions and other<lb/> environmental impacts significantly.<lb/></p>

			<p>A large part of the difference between the highest and lowest values for<lb/> greenhouse gas emissions in the data analysed by Farrell and the ERG team<lb/> are due to differences in the assumed rate of lime application in farming corn<lb/> and they observe that the data on lime application is poor.<lb/> Much of the uncertainty in the analysis of life-cycle greenhouse gas emissions<lb/> concerns land-use change. Changes in land use due to the production of<lb/> biofuels can result in large changes in the amount of carbon in biomass and<lb/> soils. There is a great deal of variation in soil-carbon levels but forest,<lb/> wetland, and grassland soils generally contain significantly more carbon than<lb/> do typical agricultural soils (<ref type="biblio">Delucchi 2006</ref>). Converting forests or grasslands<lb/> to agriculture for the purpose of producing biofuel crops can result in<lb/> emissions of soil carbon equivalent to several decades of emissions from<lb/> fossil-fuel use.<lb/></p>

			<p>Another large source of uncertainty arises in estimating emissions of nitrous<lb/> oxide (N 2 O) from cultivated soil and indirectly from fertilizer application. This<lb/> may account for as much as 50% of total greenhouse gas emissions on a CO 2<lb/> equivalence basis for some biofuels production. A recently completed<lb/> unpublished report for the German Environment Agency found that when N 2 O<lb/> emissions are included, biodiesel produced from rapeseed in Germany is<lb/> associated with three times the greenhouse gas emissions of conventional<lb/> diesel. Mark Delucchi at University of California Davis found similar results for<lb/> soybean biodiesel in the USA (<ref type="biblio">Delucchi 2006</ref>).<lb/> Farming practices are an important determinant of emissions and the<lb/> difference between &apos;good&apos; and &apos;bad&apos; practice can be sufficient to shift the<lb/> balance from positive to negative. Soil types also matter. Emissions of<lb/> greenhouse gases from the soil from farming crops on humus rich soils, such<lb/> as prevail in northern Europe, are estimated to be around a hundred times<lb/> emissions from farming crops on the more mineral soils typical of Spain or the<lb/> main sugar cane areas of Brazil. Crop yields also have a major impact on life-<lb/>cycle energy and greenhouse gas emissions balances.<lb/></p>

			<head>Ecosystem impacts<lb/></head>

			<p>Using waste products as the raw material for biofuel production avoids many<lb/> of the problems associated with cultivating biofuel crops. At the same time<lb/> many agricultural wastes have an opportunity cost and sustainable agricultural<lb/> practices would see them returned to the soil to maintain organic matter<lb/> content. As it is, levels of soil humus are diminishing rapidly in many regions<lb/> of the world with current agricultural practices. Extracting straw, manure and<lb/> other biomass for vary large scale production of ligno-cellulosic fuels could<lb/> exacerbate the trend depending on the proportion of residues removed.<lb/></p>

			<p>Where excess manure concentrations from intensive farming are currently a<lb/> problem, conversion to biofuel would be beneficial, even if a comparison with<lb/> resolving the problem through less intensive production is difficult to make.<lb/> More generally, producing biofuels from wastes that would otherwise be<lb/> dumped in landfill sites might be expected to show net environmental benefits<lb/> given a shortage of suitable landfill sites.<lb/></p>

			<p>The potential for the use of degraded lands, normally abandoned agricultural<lb/> land, for biofuel feedstock production was discussed briefly at the Round<lb/></p>

			<table>Table. This is not common practice today and when degraded lands have<lb/> been converted to biofuel production, such as on some Conservation Reserve<lb/> Program lands in the United States, traditional crops such as maize have<lb/> usually been used, causing all of the problems discussed above. Alternatives<lb/> have been proposed that would establish perennial crops to restore land<lb/> quality and sequester carbon in soils at the same time as producing biofuels,<lb/> using existing species such as prairie grasses or genetically modified biofuel<lb/> crops such as elephant grass (miscanthus). These approaches have not yet<lb/> been demonstrated and would produce biofuels on only a limited scale<lb/> because of the relatively low productivity of such land and feedstocks.<lb/></table>

			<p>The categorisation of almost all biofuels as &apos;renewable&apos; was challenged at a<lb/> fundamental level. Turning biomass into fuels takes material out of natural<lb/> ecosystems (when wild growing plants and trees are converted into fuel),<lb/> replaces a natural ecosystem with crop land or intensifies production from<lb/> existing farmland. The net result, as with much modern farming, is the<lb/> destruction of natural ecosystems, a loss of biodiversity and a simplification of<lb/> modified farmland ecosystems that is irreversible except on a geological time-<lb/>scale. Increased production of biomass represents consumption of a resource<lb/> that can not be replaced. With even present-scale production of biofuels these<lb/> losses are not trivial. Taking a very long-term perspective it was argued that<lb/> large-scale biofuel production is not &apos;sustainable&apos; and biofuels cannot be<lb/> regarded as &apos;renewable&apos; fuels (see Patzek 2007a for a full discussion of this<lb/> point). Of course the same holds for the &apos;renewability&apos; of much food<lb/> production.<lb/></p>

			<head>4. Subsidies, cost-effectiveness of support to biofuels and indirect<lb/> economic impacts<lb/></head>

			<p>Debate was launched by a presentation from Ron Steenblik, Director of<lb/> Research for the Global Subsidies Initiative of the International Institute for<lb/> Sustainable Development, which examined:<lb/></p>

			<p>– The size and extent of subsidies.<lb/></p>

			<p>– Prospects for commercial viability in relation to oil and feedstock prices.<lb/></p>

			<p>– Market interactions and the impact of biofuel subsidies on food and<lb/> animal feedstock markets.<lb/></p>

			<p>He began by noting that if it were not for the existence of large and growing<lb/> subsidies and volumetric production targets for biofuels, the complicated and<lb/> costly task of calculating life-cycle performance for the certification of fuels<lb/> would probably not be required. Few if any biofuels are currently produced<lb/> without direct or indirect government support.<lb/></p>

			<p>In the United States, the cost to taxpayers of just the federal volumetric tax<lb/> credits for biofuels is expected to be almost USD 4 billion in 2007 (</p>

			<table>Table 1),<lb/> equivalent to one third of the total USD 12 billion expected to be paid out in<lb/> farm support in 2007. Federal tax credits for biofuels could grow to<lb/> USD 16 billion if the US Congress were to adopt the Bush Administration&apos;s<lb/> proposed expanded &apos;alternative fuels&apos; target of 35 billion gallons (132 billion<lb/> litres) a year by 2017 (Figure 5).<lb/> In the European Union, reduced excise tax rates for biofuels are estimated to<lb/> have cost around Euro 3 billion (USD 4 billion) in tax revenues foregone in<lb/> 2006, up from Euro 1.8 billion in 2005 (<ref type="biblio">Kutas et al., 2007</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<p>For the OECD as a whole, Mr Steenblik estimated overall support for biofuels<lb/> at 13 to 15 billion dollars in 2007.<lb/> Much cheaper ways of saving fuel and CO 2 emissions are available in the<lb/> transport sector and elsewhere in the economy. Putting to one side those<lb/> circumstances where the use of ethanol increases, rather than reduces,<lb/> greenhouse gas emissions, support for ethanol was estimated to cost USD<lb/> 520/tCO 2-eq (Euro 390) for the greenhouse gas emissions saved through<lb/> production of ethanol at the best performing US plants 3 . The cost of emissions<lb/> avoided rises to over USD 10 000/tCO 2-eq (Euro 7 400) in the case of<lb/> hypothetical production of ethanol in Oregon from feedstock transported from<lb/> the Midwest. At these levels of cost it is inconceivable that using life-cycle<lb/> analysis to help improve even the best performing US ethanol plants and corn<lb/> production practices could make ethanol a more cost effective way of<lb/> reducing greenhouse gas emissions than alternatives such as supporting<lb/> improved vehicle fuel efficiency.<lb/> Research for the Global Subsidies Initiative (<ref type="biblio">Kutas et al., 2007</ref>) suggests that<lb/> the same is true for biofuels produced in Europe, even though greenhouse<lb/> gas emission balances are generally much better than is the case for US corn<lb/> ethanol. For ethanol produced from sugar beet in Europe the cost of subsidies<lb/> per ton of CO 2-eq avoided is estimated to lie between Euro 450 and Euro 620;<lb/> for biodiesel produced from rapeseed the range is estimated to be Euro 750 to<lb/> Euro 990; and for biodiesel produced from used cooking oil around Euro 270<lb/> (USD 370).<lb/></p>

			<p>These subsidies for biofuels are an extremely costly way of reducing<lb/> greenhouse gas emissions. For example, the implicit subsidy from the excise<lb/> tax exemption for biodiesel of Euro 0.70 per litre in Germany is equivalent to<lb/> 10 000 Euros (USD 13 000) per car on the basis of average kilometres driven<lb/> over a car&apos;s lifetime. Investing this amount in improved vehicle efficiency could<lb/> massively improve the fuel efficiency of average cars.<lb/></p>

			<p>In some cases biofuel subsidies can significantly exceed the price of the fossil<lb/> fuel for which they substitute. Pennsylvania, for example, is contemplating<lb/> providing subsidies for biodiesel that, combined with federal subsidies, would<lb/> amount to USD 2.37 per gallon against a pre-tax price for mineral diesel oil of<lb/> around USD 2.00 per gallon. Fossil fuels also receive subsidies, but not at<lb/> such high rates per unit of fuel produced. In OECD countries there are tax<lb/> subsidies to oil production but these have only a small effect on prices at the<lb/> pump. (Fuel subsidies tend to be found mainly in OPEC member countries<lb/> and a few lower income countries.)<lb/></p>

			<p>Food and fibre production is also heavily subsidised in many countries, but<lb/> biofuels subsidies are particularly poorly structured, with no cap and no<lb/> differentiation according to performance. Although the purpose of biofuel<lb/> subsidies might be expected to be to make biofuels competitive with oil<lb/> products, they are only rarely linked to the price of oil, and subsidies continue<lb/> to be paid when oil prices rise to levels that should make biofuels competitive.<lb/> It was noted that biofuel subsidies in France are currently calculated on the<lb/> basis of an oil price of USD 30 a barrel. With current prices at USD 60 a barrel<lb/> this represents a massive transfer from the taxpayer to the biofuels industry.<lb/> Whilst capital grants for building biorefineries can be terminated relatively<lb/> easily, subsidies to production always prove very difficult to reform.<lb/></p>

			<p>Few markets have been as distorted by government intervention as biofuels.<lb/> Moreover, biofuel subsidies are lending legitimacy to calls for subsidies for<lb/> other &apos;alternative&apos; fuels. US politicians that would like to see new coal-to-liquid<lb/> plants located in their States are arguing for a production tax credit (51 cents<lb/> per litre) that matches that currently benefiting ethanol. Two bills were<lb/> presented to Congress and defeated in June 2007 seeking similar subsidies<lb/> for coal-to-liquid fuels production. The logic is that other fuels providing the<lb/> same environmental or energy security benefit should be accorded the same<lb/> level of subsidy. In this way subsidies tend to proliferate. A simple increase in<lb/> fuel excise duty to reflect its carbon content would be a more direct, less<lb/> open-ended and more transparent way of encouraging the development of<lb/> low-carbon fuels.<lb/></p>

			<p>There were suggestions that Brazil demonstrates that subsidies can be<lb/> temporary. Brazilian ethanol production comes closest to commercial viability.<lb/> However, as explained in detail in Professor de Almeida&apos;s paper, it is exempt<lb/> from fuel excise duty, and in sugar cane growing states it is also exempt from<lb/> VAT. Without these tax subsidies production would not be viable. Support<lb/> amounts to around USD 1 billion a year.<lb/> Any notion that conventional ethanol production requires infant industry<lb/> support is difficult to accept as the production process is identical to the<lb/> fermentation of grain for ethanol in making beer and other alcoholic<lb/> beverages, a process operated commercially over thousands of years.<lb/> Moreover, ethanol for gasoline blending has been produced in the USA for 20<lb/> years. Support for wind power generation was advocated on an &apos;infant&apos;<lb/> industry basis because costs are on a trajectory towards commercial viability.<lb/> Biofuels, however, appear to be on the opposite trajectory with land and grain<lb/> prices increasing as a consequence of subsidizing their production.<lb/> It was suggested that the lack of substitutes for liquid hydrocarbon transport<lb/> fuels justifies specific support to biofuels, but given the large potential for<lb/> reducing CO 2 emissions and saving oil in other sectors at much lower cost,<lb/> this view did not command general support. Moreover, transforming biomass<lb/> into complicated hydro-carbon molecules is inevitably much less efficient than<lb/> simply burning it for heating or electricity generation.<lb/></p>

			<p>The strategic goals of subsidies to biofuels production are:<lb/></p>

			<p>– Reducing greenhouse gas emissions.<lb/></p>

			<p>– Improving energy security.<lb/></p>

			<p>– Promoting rural employment.<lb/> Much greater contributions to all of these goals can be achieved at much<lb/> lower cost by other means: promoting energy efficiency, developing transport<lb/> demand management strategies and providing direct income support to<lb/> farmers.<lb/> Support to commodity production has proved an ineffective way to deliver<lb/> social policy in the farm sector as any benefits are almost always captured by<lb/> large agro-industrial companies rather than the targeted farm labourers or<lb/> small farmers. The same is true with biofuels production where most<lb/> production is accounted for by large corporations.<lb/></p>

			<p>In relation to energy security, price volatility is usually a good indicator of<lb/> supply security problems. Prices increase in times of shortage and fall when<lb/> there is a glut. Grain prices fluctuate more widely than oil prices due, in part,<lb/> to dependence on the weather. Even if all arable land were diverted to the<lb/> production of biofuels it would not ensure energy security and could increase<lb/> price volatility.<lb/> The high cost of subsidies to biofuels has the potential to divert resources<lb/> from energy efficiency measures with much higher returns in terms of<lb/> greenhouse gas emission reductions. Overall, the current level and structure<lb/> of support for biofuel production would appear to weaken our ability to achieve<lb/> any of the strategic goals.<lb/></p>

			<head>5. Second generation fuels – Performance and potential<lb/></head>

			<p>Discussions followed a presentation by <ref type="biblio">Professor</ref> Birgitte Ahring of the<lb/> Technical University of Denmark, founder of the BioGasols Company that<lb/> produces ligno-cellulosic ethanol from a pilot plant in Denmark. The paper<lb/> covers:<lb/></figure>

			<p>– Energy performance by feedstock and process.<lb/></p>

			<p>– Economic performance to date.<lb/></p>

			<p>– Design of subsidies.<lb/></p>

			<p>– Future performance and scale of production from wastes and dedicated<lb/> crops.<lb/> Ligno-cellulosic ethanol demonstration plants are under development in<lb/> Denmark with production expected to start in the next year or two at a scale of<lb/> around 10 million litres a year per plant. These plants will be designed to<lb/> demonstrate flexibility of feedstock capability rather than produce fuel at the<lb/> lowest cost. Around 2010 the next generation of small full-scale plants of<lb/> around 70 million litre a year capacity is foreseen. Fully commercial plants<lb/> would be bigger again, around 100 million litres per year, and expected to<lb/> break even at an oil price of USD 35/bbl. Despite that, Professor Ahring&apos;s<lb/> paper argues for continuing subsidies for production.<lb/></p>

			<p>The capital costs of ligno-cellulosic plants were reported to be around 50%<lb/> higher than for conventional ethanol production; nevertheless the critical factor<lb/> for commercial viability is the cost of biomass feedstock. The main feedstock<lb/> in Denmark will be straw, despite its relatively high price of USD 85/t, but a<lb/> variety of feedstocks are expected to be used eventually including waste<lb/> paper, household wastes and the fibrous residues of pig manure. The<lb/> potential value of diverting wastes from landfill was stressed against a<lb/> background of rapid growth in the generation of household waste. Producing<lb/> fuels from some kinds of waste reduces land use impacts to zero but the<lb/> potential volume of production from these kinds of waste remains to be<lb/> quantified.<lb/></p>

			<p>The great variety of feedstocks that can potentially be used for ligno-cellulosic<lb/> ethanol production provides for a very wide range of performance in terms of<lb/> life-cycle greenhouse gas emissions. Results are more likely to be positive<lb/> than with much conventional ethanol production. For straw fed plants in<lb/> Denmark, emission reductions of 80% compared to gasoline are expected.<lb/> There is no figure available for the cost per tonne of CO 2 saved.<lb/></p>

			<p>The relatively high capital costs of producing ligno-cellulosic ethanol imply<lb/> important scale economies. Large plant, processing large volumes of<lb/> biomass, are therefore probably required for commercial viability. This means<lb/> that either that large quantities of feedstock have to be available locally or<lb/> feedstock has to be brought to the plant over long distances. This is the case<lb/> for low yield crops such as switchgrass grown on marginal land. Transporting<lb/> feedstock, however, has a cost in both financial and energy terms and<lb/> severely undermines the greenhouse gas balance of producing ethanol this<lb/> way. Large-scale plantations of dedicated crops on reasonably fertile land<lb/> would be required to produce quantities of ethanol sufficient to substitute for<lb/> more than one or two percent of transport sector oil demand. Ethanol yields<lb/> from ligno-cellulosic production are higher per hectare of land used than<lb/> conventional ethanol production because more of the feedstock is converted<lb/> to fuel. Substituting for conventional production could reduce pressure on land<lb/> to some degree, albeit at the expense of higher production costs.<lb/></p>

			<p>Distiller&apos;s grain, a co-product in conventional ethanol plants, could be used as<lb/> feedstock for ligno-cellulosic production (although it is 30% protein and 9% fat<lb/> and probably more valuable as animal feed) and could be used to increase<lb/> overall ethanol output 20% in an integrated production system. Professor<lb/> Ahring thought that producing ethanol from bagasse in Brazil would enable it<lb/> to become competitive with gasoline without tax subsidies. It was noted that in<lb/> Australia sugar cane is selected for greater leafiness and cane burning 4 is<lb/> being reduced to provide more material for bagasse.<lb/></p>

			<p>Again a number of questions were raised about the material and energy<lb/> balances of diverting some waste streams for ethanol production. Bagasse in<lb/> Brazil is usually used to fire the boilers for distilling ethanol whilst co-<lb/>producing ethanol, diverting it to ligno-cellulosic ethanol production would<lb/> sacrifice income from electricity sales to the grid and require other (fossil)<lb/> fuels to provide process heat and electricity. Since straw normally gets<lb/> ploughed back into the soil, using large quantities to produce ethanol would<lb/> be detrimental to soil quality.<lb/></p>

			<figure>It was reported that prospects for commercial operation of the world&apos;s first<lb/> large-scale demonstration ligno-cellulosic ethanol plant, the Iogen plant in<lb/> 4. Burning makes harvesting easier and empties the fields of snakes and other pests.<lb/></figure>

			<p>Canada, continue to be uncertain. There was speculation that early starts like<lb/> Iogen might not prove to be the way forward in the long run. A number of<lb/> small private companies are developing new enzymes that could reduce<lb/> costs, and the costs of the enzymes themselves are falling. One technology<lb/> being trialled in the USA is to feed algae in tanks with carbon dioxide<lb/> sequestered from fossil-fuel power stations. Although this doesn&apos;t dispose of<lb/> the CO 2 it results in some incremental energy production through<lb/> photosynthesis. A note of caution was sounded with regard to the potential of<lb/> bioengineering to radically increase the efficiency of producing biofuels.<lb/> Although enzymes are superior to chemical catalysts in their selectivity, this<lb/> comes at a cost in terms of speed and thermal efficiency, where catalysts do<lb/> much better.<lb/> Small scale subsidies for technical innovation were regarded as generally<lb/> useful, with a role in supporting research into the technologically innovative<lb/> forms of second generation biofuels. But some second generation biofuels are<lb/> counterproductive. Converting wood to liquids by processes generally known<lb/> as BTL (biomass-to-liquid) is around 50% efficient whereas burning the wood<lb/> directly in an efficient boiler can achieve 80% efficiency; 30% of the energy<lb/> content of the wood is foregone by converting it to liquid instead of burning it.<lb/> Replacing domestic heating oil with wood for industrial and domestic heating<lb/> would release oil for motor diesel at four times the efficiency of producing<lb/> biodiesel.<lb/></p>

			<p>There are potentially other fuels that might be produced from second<lb/> generation technologies, including other alcohols (e.g. biobutanol),<lb/> hydrocarbons and hydrogen. These alternatives were not discussed in detail<lb/> at the Round Table but a variety of pathways need to be explored.<lb/></p>

			<head>6. Potential for Brazilian ethanol exports<lb/></head>

			<p>Discussions were launched by Professor Edmar de Almeida of the Institute of<lb/> Economics of the Federal University of Rio De Janeiro, examining:<lb/></p>

			<p>– The performance of current production.<lb/></p>

			<p>– Environmental issues.<lb/></p>

			<p>– The potential size of exports.<lb/></p>

			<p>– The impact on energy, environment and economic performance of<lb/> scaling up for export.<lb/></p>

			<p>–</p>

			<table>Trade and trade barriers.<lb/> Professor de Almeida&apos;s paper examines the performance of Brazilian ethanol<lb/> and biodiesel in detail, including energy and CO 2 balances, quantifying<lb/> subsidies and examining the direct and indirect environmental impacts of<lb/> producing biofuels. The discussions focused on ethanol, reflecting the relative<lb/> significance of ethanol and biodiesel in Brazil.<lb/> The most comprehensive body of research on ethanol in Brazil, led by<lb/> Professor de Macedo, finds ethanol produced from sugar cane achieving 30%<lb/> to 80% greenhouse gas savings compared with gasoline, depending on the<lb/> efficiency of feedstock production and the operation of plants, with most<lb/> towards the upper end of performance. Professor Almeida&apos;s thorough review<lb/> of the literature confirms the superior performance of Brazilian ethanol<lb/> production, although the he was not able to assess all of the uncertainties<lb/> discussed above surrounding such estimates. The advantages for Brazilian<lb/> ethanol production are as follows:<lb/></table>

			<p>– Sugar is a better feedstock than starch (from grain) as starch must first<lb/> be broken down with enzymes into sugar before it can be fermented,<lb/> which requires heat.<lb/></p>

			<p>– The use of bagasse (cane residue) to produce process heat and<lb/> electricity avoids the use of fossil fuel.<lb/></p>

			<p>– Co-generation of surplus electricity sold to the grid, improving both<lb/> financial and energy balances.<lb/></p>

			<p>– At least some of the soils used for sugar cane in Brazil are low in<lb/> organic matter and produce relatively little N 2 O and CO 2 when<lb/> cultivated.<lb/></p>

			<p>– Cane is largely rain-fed in Brazil rather than irrigated, reducing the<lb/> need to pump water and reducing stress on water resources.<lb/></p>

			<p>– Farm labour costs are low, aiding financial performance.<lb/></p>

			<p>– A sustained government funded research effort into plant breeding and<lb/> selection has improved yields substantially, a trend that is set to<lb/> continue.<lb/> Ethanol prices have traditionally been closely linked to sugar prices because<lb/> of the flexibility of producers to switch production between sugar and ethanol.<lb/> However, high oil prices mean that ethanol prices are increasingly linked to<lb/> the price of oil.<lb/></p>

			<p>The potential indirect impacts of cane growing on greenhouse gas emissions<lb/> through the displacement of agriculture as a result of the expansion of cane<lb/> growing are not well documented. There is likely to be some effect because of<lb/> interconnections between land markets. Expanding cane plantations onto land<lb/> famed for other purposes will create pressure for more intensive production of<lb/> the displaced crops or expansion into virgin lands somewhere in the world, if<lb/> demand for these other crops remains unchanged.<lb/></p>

			<p>There are a number of factors that complicate the picture. Incremental cane<lb/> plantations in Brazil generally replace extensive cattle rearing, which is<lb/> associated with widespread soil erosion. In these conditions replacing cattle<lb/> with cane may reduce soil carbon loss. Around Sao Paolo, in the heart of<lb/> cane country, some cattle have been moved indoors as cane planting<lb/> expands. Greenhouse gas emissions from stall-fed cattle can be much higher<lb/> than from free-range herds depending on the feed types they are given. The<lb/> overall impact of cane expansion on greenhouse gas emissions is difficult to<lb/> determine. It is also possible that some cattle rearing has been displaced to<lb/> the North where it encroaches on rainforest. The main incentive for felling<lb/> forest in the Amazon is extracting timber, which has a very high cash value.<lb/> Cattle-rearing yields very little, around $100 per hectare per year, and simply<lb/> follows where timber has been exploited – legally or illegally.<lb/></p>

			<p>The link between forest destruction and biofuel production may be stronger in<lb/> the case of soybeans for biodiesel as this crop is suited to the North and<lb/> grown on very large plantations. Soybean production has expanded rapidly<lb/> recently due to growing international demand. The spread of the crop is<lb/> replicating the initial development of land for sugar cane plantations, which<lb/> resulted in massive deforestation in earlier centuries. Whilst the government<lb/> has passed laws to protect the Amazon rainforest, enforcement is difficult<lb/> across the vast and sparsely populated territory of the North.<lb/></p>

			<p>Biofuels subsidies in Brazil were initially aimed at providing jobs for unskilled<lb/> labour in rural areas and at combating local air pollution. (Ethanol is used as<lb/> an octane enhancer in lead-free petrol and as a fuel oxygenate to reduce<lb/> carbon monoxide emissions). Although mechanisation is gradually reducing<lb/> employment in sugar cane plantations, the industry provides one million jobs,<lb/> and at a higher rate of pay than the rural average. There are similar<lb/> motivations for supporting the development of biodiesel production. The first<lb/> goal is rural development through support to small scale production in poor<lb/> areas. Biodiesel is also free of sulphur and can be blended with conventional<lb/> diesel to reduce emissions of both sulphur dioxide and particulates, which are<lb/> major environmental health problems in Brazil&apos;s main cities. There has,<lb/> however, been no analysis of whether subsidies for biofuels are an efficient<lb/> way of encouraging rural development.<lb/></p>

			<head>Trade in biofuels<lb/></head>

			<p>Debate on trade in biofuels was initiated by a short presentation from Ron<lb/> Steenblik noting an important distinction between the trade treatment of<lb/> biodiesel and ethanol. The World Customs Organisation (WCO) classifies<lb/> biodiesel as a chemical product and as such it attracts low tariffs. Ethanol is<lb/> classified by the WCO as an agricultural good, as most production has been<lb/> for beverages, and as such it can be subject to much higher tariffs. Import<lb/> tariffs vary widely in OECD countries, from 6% in Canada to 51% in Australia<lb/> on an ad valorem basis. The USA and EU levy tariffs with ad valorem<lb/> equivalent rates of 23% and 38% respectively. Trade diplomacy on<lb/> environmental goods under the World Trade Organisation (WTO) negotiations<lb/> on access to markets for agricultural products only ever covered biodiesel,<lb/> and biodiesel has now been removed from the list of proposed environmental<lb/> goods. Negotiators are reluctant to address ethanol as they believe this would<lb/> inevitably lead to demands for a wide range of agricultural products to receive<lb/> special treatment.<lb/></p>

			<p>The potential of Brazil to export ethanol is severely constrained by import tariff<lb/> policies. Brazil&apos;s current 2 billion litres annual exports to the USA mainly enter<lb/> the country via Central American and Caribbean countries under the<lb/> Caribbean Basin Initiative trade agreement. Major expansion would require<lb/> negotiation of favourable tariffs. There has been speculation that ethanol<lb/> might provide a reason for reopening the current stalled round of WTO<lb/> negotiations, but no country appears ready to change its present position.<lb/></p>

			<head>7. Certification – the potential for linking support to performance<lb/></head>

			<p>Certification schemes have been developed for a variety of agricultural and<lb/> forest products in order to differentiate products that meet certain<lb/> environmental standards from others that do not. Organic food labelling is a<lb/> familiar example. Some of the schemes are operated by government, some<lb/> by voluntary consumer or producer organisations. All have to create<lb/> confidence in the reliability of the endorsement they provide. This requires an<lb/> assurance system that sets the standards to be met, inspects farms and<lb/> processing plants to determine if standards are being met, and grants<lb/> accreditation to independent bodies that issue certificates to producers<lb/> confirming their products meet the standards. Confidence in the integrity of<lb/> the assurance system may rely on government oversight, involvement of<lb/> environmental campaign groups and public reporting of inspection activities<lb/> and standard setting.<lb/></p>

			<p>Certification and assessment of biofuels was introduced by a summary of<lb/> developments in California from Professor Alex Farrell and a detailed<lb/> presentation from Professor Jeremy Woods of Imperial College London<lb/> covering:<lb/></p>

			<p>– The design of certification and assurance schemes.<lb/></p>

			<p>– The environmental impacts of farming biomass.<lb/></p>

			<p>– National and international certification schemes.<lb/></p>

			<p>– The cost-effectiveness and feasibility of auditing and inspection.<lb/></p>

			<p>The very great range of performance in terms of greenhouse gas emissions of<lb/> different biofuels production pathways was stressed in the presentations.<lb/> Around 130 combinations of feedstock and process have been evaluated to<lb/> date. Taking just one, ethanol produced from wheat, research suggests<lb/> performance when compared to gasoline ranges from higher emissions to an<lb/> 80% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, on a life-cycle basis.<lb/></p>

			<p>As noted already, the role of soil carbon is particularly poorly understood. This<lb/> applies to both the soil-carbon content of natural ecosystems compared to<lb/> farmland (for example if peat-lands or wetlands are cleared and drained for<lb/> biofuel crops) and to the soil-carbon impacts of different farming techniques.<lb/> Research suggests that good farming practice can result in an increase in<lb/> carbon trapped in organic matter in the soil, in some cases even when grazing<lb/> land or savannah is planted. Poor farming practice can result in significant<lb/> emissions and loss of soil carbon. Poor practice currently dominates and<lb/> farming practice is costly to monitor for certification purposes. At the same<lb/> time, biofuels production is so far only a small sub-set of the different uses to<lb/> which land is put. As knowledge about the impacts of soil-carbon on<lb/> greenhouse gas emissions increases estimates for emissions from other<lb/> types of land use will also need to be revised.<lb/></p>

			<p>Certification is a difficult task, not least because of the effort required in<lb/> building consensus over the methodologies employed and the validity of<lb/> results.<lb/></p>

			<p>Despite the difficulties and gaps in research certification is critical if subsidies<lb/> and volumetric targets for biofuels production are to continue to be employed.<lb/> Without certification, such targets are likely to result in a &apos;race to the bottom&apos;;<lb/> producing the largest quantity at the lowest cost and at the lowest capital<lb/> intensity, which tends to be associated with the highest greenhouse gas<lb/> emissions. The first goal of certification is to counter this tendency.<lb/></p>

			<p>In response to EU biofuel targets the UK government will introduce a<lb/> Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation (RTFO) from April 2008 under which<lb/> fuel suppliers will be required to submit monthly carbon and sustainability<lb/> reports to the Administrator of the scheme. The reports will identify the volume<lb/> and type of biofuel supplied with detail on the feedstock type, any<lb/> environmental and social standards to which the feedstock has been grown,<lb/> any land use change that has occurred and the carbon intensity of the biofuel<lb/> supplied. Targets have been set that indicate the level of performance<lb/> Government expects from suppliers but there will be no penalty or sanction for<lb/> not meeting these targets. Companies will supply an annual report that<lb/> provides a summary of this information which will be made publicly available.<lb/> The Administrator will also publish an annual report that will include an<lb/> assessment of each supplier&apos;s performance against the targets.<lb/> Technical guidance is being developed (by E4tech) that will provide the<lb/> information and instructions suppliers need in order to comply with these<lb/> requirements. Direct land use change is included within the boundaries of the<lb/> carbon intensity calculation. Indirect land-use change is not addressed within<lb/> the well-to-wheel carbon intensity calculation but the Administrator will assess<lb/> these potential impacts on an ex-post basis and report to Parliament.<lb/> In June, the UK Government announced that it intends to move to a scheme<lb/> that rewards fuels on the basis of their greenhouse gas performance from<lb/> 2010, and that only biofuels that meet specific sustainability standards will<lb/> qualify</p>

			<table>for incentives from 2011. The proposals for a mandatory carbon-based<lb/> RTFO with minimum sustainability standards are subject to a number of<lb/> provisos. The changes must be: compatible with World Trade Organisation<lb/> rules and EU Technical Standard requirements; consistent with the policy<lb/> framework being developed by the European Commission as part of the<lb/> review of the Biofuels Directive; subject to consultation on environmental and<lb/> economic impacts; and subject to the appropriate development of<lb/> sustainability standards for feedstocks. The scheme design must also be in<lb/> line with the proposals developed under the European Fuel Quality Directive.<lb/> The Netherlands has scheduled introduction of a reporting system in 2008,<lb/> similar to that adopted in the UK. Technical guidance is being developed (by<lb/> Ecofys) in alignment, as far as possible, with UK guidance.<lb/> The German government planned to introduce certification in June 2007.<lb/> Although introduction has been delayed in Germany, certification there is<lb/> expected to be compulsory without a long lead-in period of voluntary<lb/> reporting. Germany plans to organise workshops in Asia and South America<lb/> to build support for certification with local Non-Governmental Organisations<lb/> (NGOs) and local communities as well as governments and biofuel producers.<lb/></table>

			<p>A number of voluntary agreements between producers and environmental<lb/> NGOs have improved farming practices for palm oil in mature plantations.<lb/> However, such schemes are unlikely to be effective in preventing the<lb/> destruction of primary forest for new plantations of palm oil. Certification<lb/> systems are designed to influence the supply chain and are not well suited to<lb/> addressing the indirect impacts of producing biofuel feedstocks. While the<lb/> policy is for German certificates not to be awarded to fuels produced from<lb/> areas designated for protection, it remains to see how effectively this can be<lb/> enforced.<lb/></p>

			<p>The State of California has begun developing a policy to reduce the carbon<lb/> intensity of transport fuels, which could provide strong linkage between the<lb/> support for biofuels used in the State and performance in terms of greenhouse<lb/> gas emissions (<ref type="biblio">Brandt et al 2007; Arons et al 2007</ref>). The policy will require the<lb/> net greenhouse gas emissions of transportation fuels (measured in grams of<lb/> CO 2 equivalent per MJ) distributed in the State to decline over time. While<lb/> other transportation energy sources may compete to meet this standard,<lb/> including, for instance electricity, biofuels will be strongly affected, in part<lb/> because Californian gasoline already contains about 6% ethanol by volume.<lb/> The European Commission has proposed a similar instrument to reduce the<lb/> carbon intensity of transport fuels in a draft Directive under consideration by<lb/> the European Council and the European Parliament. If adopted this might<lb/> replace the existing volumetric biofuel targets. The Commission is developing<lb/> a framework for the certification of fuels that would be required for<lb/> implementation of a carbon intensity regulation.<lb/> International consensus building on greenhouse gas calculation<lb/> methodologies and sustainability standards is important if certification is to be<lb/> successful in influencing the way imported fuels are produced and at the<lb/> same time avoid simply acting as a trade barrier. Moreover, given the<lb/> relatively poor understanding of the impact of different farming techniques,<lb/> sustainability criteria have to be developed with local experts and can not be<lb/> simply transposed from practices in other regions. The transaction costs<lb/> involved suggest that, without complementary measures, certification will<lb/> make it harder for small farmers to supply the market.<lb/> It was noted that a potential shortcoming of certification systems is that once a<lb/> producer qualifies for certification there is no further incentive to improve<lb/> performance. Subsidies provided to certified fuels need therefore to be linked<lb/> to a life-cycle assessment of greenhouse gas emissions, with the attendant<lb/> monitoring costs.<lb/></p>

			<p>In summary, the following issues need to be addressed in designing<lb/> certification systems:<lb/></p>

			<p>– Agreement is required on the boundaries to life-cycle analysis and on<lb/> the approach to addressing land-use change.<lb/></p>

			<p>– More research is required on soil carbon and N 2 O emissions from<lb/> farming to reduce scientific uncertainties in life-cycle analysis.<lb/></p>

			<p>– The potential for certification to be used as a barrier to imports from<lb/> lower income countries needs to be minimised.<lb/></p>

			<p>The costs of certifying production processes and farming practices, of<lb/> monitoring compliance and of achieving consensus between stakeholders that<lb/> certification is both fair and effective are not trivial and need to be contained.<lb/> There is nevertheless a compelling argument for developing the business<lb/> case for a certification process that can reduce the risks of subsidies<lb/> encouraging environmentally-destructive feedstock production and promote<lb/> biofuels production in proportion to the greenhouse gas emissions savings<lb/> actually achieved. This is particularly true for governments so long as markets<lb/> for biofuels remain almost entirely dependent on public subsidies.<lb/></p>

			<head>8. Outlook for biofuels production<lb/></head>

			<p>Discussions at the Round Table suggested that projections that biofuels<lb/> production will grow to contribute a large share of energy supply are<lb/> unrealistic. For example the projection by the University of Texas of solid and<lb/> liquid fuels derived from biomass covering 25% of US energy supply by 2025<lb/> would require 50% of all ecosystem production in the US (natural ecosystems<lb/> as well as food and fibre crops) to be replaced with biofuel crops.<lb/></p>

			<p>The 2007 Inter-Governmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)<lb/> 4 th Assessment Report on climate change mitigation policies foresees a<lb/> potential for biofuels from agricultural crops and wastes to replace 5% to 10%<lb/> of road transport fuels by 2030, with an economic potential for net greenhouse<lb/> gas reductions ranging from 0.6 to 1.5 Gt CO 2-eq at carbon prices of up to $US<lb/> 25/t CO 2-eq . It bases these projections on assessments of the life-cycle<lb/> greenhouse gas emissions by the IEA, EUCAR-CONCAWE-JRC (<ref type="figure">Figure 7</ref>),<lb/> GM-ANL and Toyota (see references).<lb/> The uncertainties surrounding estimates of the greenhouse gas emissions<lb/> reduction potential identified at the Round Table suggest that the IPCC<lb/> forecast needs to be viewed with circumspection. The forecast does assume<lb/> significant advances in biofuel production but the figures for corn-ethanol<lb/> production in the studies reviewed by Farrell et al. suggest more radical<lb/> change would be required, with the abandonment of current land-intensive<lb/> feedstocks such as corn and wheat.<lb/></p>

			<p>Even if the IPCC&apos;s assumption that biofuels could be competitive with oil in<lb/> 2030 proves to be the case, the discussion of the economics of biofuels at the<lb/> Round Table suggests that hundreds of billions of dollars of subsidy will be<lb/> spent on the production of biofuels in the interim, if proposed EU and US<lb/> targets to cover 10% of transport sector fuel consumption before 2020 are to<lb/> be met. Only very small quantities of biofuels are currently produced without<lb/> support and even the best performing biofuel industry, Brazilian sugar cane<lb/> ethanol production, requires around USD 1 billion a year in support through<lb/> excise tax and VAT exemptions.</p>
