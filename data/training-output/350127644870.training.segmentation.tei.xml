			<body>THE IMPACT OF MONITORING EQUIPMENT ON AIR QUALITY MANAGEMENT <lb/>CAPACITY IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES <lb/>Air quality data: the first step toward cleaner skies in the developing world <lb/>Air quality in many developing countries, particularly urban centres, has become severely polluted <lb/>over the last several decades as a consequence of industrial development, economic growth and large-scale <lb/>migrations by rural residents to cities. Air pollution degrades the health and quality of life for people. Air <lb/>pollution also exacts direct costs on national economies in the forms of reduced productivity and greater <lb/>demand for medical services. In addition, there are indirect costs that are rarely accounted for such as the <lb/>decreased value of the natural resource &apos;asset&apos; of clean air in a nation, decreased tourism and even reduced <lb/>foreign investment as a result of polluted air or other environmental and health impacts of polluted air. <lb/>Citizens in the United States, Japan and much of Europe enjoy relatively clean air thanks to <lb/>enforcement of air quality laws and market-based incentives for emitters to reduce their output of sulphur <lb/>dioxide (SO 2 ), nitrogen oxide (NO x ), particulate matter (PM) and other pollutants. But efforts to reduce <lb/>pollution lag significantly in most developing countries largely because the costs of obtaining cleaner air <lb/>— through such measures as replacing and upgrading vehicles and installing air pollution control devices <lb/>on industrial facilities and power plants — represent a large investment relative to national economic <lb/>output. <lb/>Nonetheless, there is a strong interest in improving air quality among citizens and leaders of <lb/>developing countries with heavily polluted airsheds. Reflecting the desire for cleaner air, many developing <lb/>countries have enacted clean-air laws similar to those of developed nations, although to date most of these <lb/>laws have been poorly enforced. Regional initiatives such as the Air Pollution in the Megacities of Asia <lb/>(APMA) and Clean Air Initiative for Asian Cities are aiding national governments and developing <lb/>transnational strategies for cleaner air; and multilateral institutions such as the World Bank and the Asian <lb/>Development Bank are funding air-quality management programs. <lb/>The challenges to improving air quality in developing countries range from a lack of government <lb/>commitment to even weak policies and standards to lack of accurate air-quality data, according to APMA&apos;s <lb/>Strategic Framework for Air Quality Management in Asia (2004). All these obstacles must be overcome to <lb/>improve air quality in developing countries, but a key starting point is obtaining comprehensive and <lb/>reliable air-quality monitoring data. Such data are scarce in developing countries, and where they exist, <lb/>they are often incomplete or inaccurate. Without effective and useful data, it is impossible to identify and <lb/>apportion the sources of emissions, and to establish permanent monitoring systems and hence impossible to <lb/>develop effective measures to prevent and reduce harmful pollutants. <lb/>In the Philippines, for example, acquiring accurate and reliable data on the sources and levels of air <lb/>pollution is viewed as a crucial first step in implementing national clean-air policies. While the government <lb/>has the legal authority to regulate emissions through fees or taxes on major emitters, according to Air <lb/>Pollution Control Policy Options (2003), a report by Resources for the Future, it must first develop the <lb/>capacity to compile specific emissions data and validate data from emitters. The agency must also <lb/>determine the &quot; precise extent and distribution of stationary source and other emissions in Metro Manila, &quot; <lb/>according to the report. <lb/></body>

			<body>Five case studies: NGOs, Governments and businesses collaborate to build air quality monitoring <lb/>capacity <lb/>A range of air quality monitoring projects has been implemented over the last decade in developing <lb/>countries. This report explores the impacts of such projects, focusing on case studies from five countries: <lb/>Morocco, the Philippines, Indonesia, India and Malaysia. These projects were selected and profiled in late <lb/>2005. <lb/>In all the case studies except for the Indian fuel testing project, imported air-quality monitoring <lb/>equipment was crucial to the programmes&apos; successes. Such equipment is not manufactured to any <lb/>significant degree in developing countries at this point. (In the Indian case, advanced imported equipment <lb/>for fuel testing would have increased the speed and efficiency of testing, but project funding limits forced <lb/>the investigators to use older, indigenously manufactured equipment.) <lb/>With the vast majority of their sales in the developed countries, manufacturers still do not see much of <lb/>a market in the developing world and have little incentive to license their technology to producers in <lb/>developing nations. While manufacturers&apos; instruments and monitoring systems source sub-components <lb/>worldwide, virtually all technologically advanced components are sourced from developed countries, and <lb/>virtually all assembly and testing is performed in the manufacturers&apos; domestic factories. This could change <lb/>in the future if the volume of purchases in developing countries increased to the point where manufacturers <lb/>could achieve the economies of scale necessary to outsource or franchise production to manufacturers in <lb/>developing countries. <lb/>Overall it seems to be clear that most analytical technology used in the developing world for <lb/>environmental purposes is imported from developed nations. However, like much of the broader <lb/>environmental industry that involves air, waste, wastewater, solid waste, recycling and remediation, there <lb/>are significant service and labour components involved in almost every environmental project. So often, <lb/>the importation of a piece of sophisticated machinery involves the employment and training of a large <lb/>number of individuals and contributes to the building of institutions. An example exists in the Manila <lb/>project where a USD2.3-million project funded by the Asian Development Bank involves the purchase of <lb/>just USD170 000 worth of monitoring equipment, with most of the remaining amount used for data <lb/>collection and analysis by local project team members. <lb/></body>

			<note place="footnote">A valid observation about the five cases profiled is that there is indeed a significant capacity-building <lb/>element in each project. Monitoring stations or programmes are established and sometimes given the <lb/>impetus to be self-sustaining. Besides the obvious capacity-building value of monitoring stations and <lb/>programmes and environmental regulatory bodies given access to greater data, these projects also reveal a <lb/>sort of non-institutional capacity building through actions of the citizens of the country to promote cleaner <lb/>air. In at least two of the cases documented below, there are examples where the provision and <lb/>dissemination or publication of environmental monitoring data has made people more aware of air-<lb/>pollution sources and in a way empowered citizens and even agencies to act of the behalf of residents <lb/>affected by air pollution. One case shows demonstrably the power of information, as the government <lb/>banned the release of the data during the smoke-and-haze crisis knowing public pressure might increase if <lb/>the extent of the degradation of the air were fully grasped. <lb/>The ultimate objective of these projects in air-pollution and air quality monitoring in the developing <lb/>world is undoubtedly clear air itself. But the environmental regulatory apparatus can hardly operate and <lb/>hold emitters accountable without sufficient data to demonstrate each emitter&apos;s impact on air quality. The <lb/>capture and dissemination of air-pollution data is an important and inevitable first step in getting to the task <lb/>or controlling air-pollution emissions. While the projects profiled below demonstrate little in the direct <lb/>reduction of air pollution, the institutionalization of air-monitoring bodies and programmes represent an <lb/></note>

			<body>ANNEX 1. CASE STUDIES OF ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING PROGRAMMES IN <lb/>DEVELOPING COUNTRIES <lb/>Jorf Lasfar Energy Company <lb/>Air Quality Monitoring Project <lb/>El Jadida, Morocco <lb/>To stimulate economic development and reduce poverty through the provision of reliable electricity, <lb/>the Moroccan government embarked in the early 1990s on a project to build a large coal-fired electrical <lb/>generation station near the port of Jorf Lasfar in El Jadida, 130 km west of Casablanca. <lb/>Two 330-MW units were constructed by the national electric utility, Office National de l&apos;Electricité <lb/>(ONE), and placed in service in 1994 and 1995. During this period, the national legal framework was <lb/>modified to allow independent power production, and in 1994, ONE requested bids for the construction of <lb/>two additional units. Because the electricity law required that power assets be owned by ONE, the agency <lb/>sought a builder-operator team to construct the two new units and operate all four units with a 30-year <lb/>power purchase agreement. <lb/>ABB Asea Brown Boveri Ltd (Zurich) and CMS Morocco Operating Co., a wholly owned subsidiary <lb/>of CMS Energy Corporation (Dearborn, Michigan, USA) were the chosen bidders to build and operate the <lb/>power plant. These entities formed the jointly owned Jorf Lasfar Energy Company and entered into a long-<lb/>term agreement, which was a 30-year lease by the project company of the four units. <lb/>In addition to cash flows from the existing units and investor equity, the project was financed with <lb/>loans from Swiss, Italian and U.S. export credit agencies and commercial loans backed by World Bank <lb/>guarantees. The USD 1.483 billion project included port enhancements to facilitate the increase in coal <lb/>shipments, as well as upgraded transmission lines from the power plant. <lb/>To meet World Bank standards for NO X , SO 2 and particulate air emissions, the power plant <lb/>incorporated electrostatic precipitators and other measures. In accordance with loan conditions, the project <lb/>also included an ambient air-quality monitoring system to evaluate the effect of the power plant on the <lb/>local environment. <lb/>Two meteorological stations and one air-monitoring station were established to measure SO 2 , NO X , <lb/>total suspended particulates (TSP), and respirable particulates (PM 10 ). The initial contract for monitoring <lb/>equipment and related services was approximately USD 250 000. The monitoring stations are operated by <lb/>JLEC, but to ensure the data quality and the sustainability of the monitoring effort, URS Corporation (San <lb/>Francisco) is under contract to perform annual audits of the monitoring network. Additional auditing, <lb/>preventative maintenance and training are provided by URS, as needed. <lb/>The system has been in operation for almost 10 years and has a very good reliability record (valid data <lb/>capture rates are consistently above 90%). The monitoring system has documented that the plant does not <lb/>emit pollutants in excess of levels that would exceed World Bank or WHO guidelines for air quality. Of <lb/>particular importance, monitoring data have shown that occasional elevated levels of SO 2 in the area are <lb/>caused by other industrial sources and not the JLEC power plant. Similarly, the occasional days with high <lb/>dust levels have been shown to be due to natural windblown dust (the plant is on the edge of the desert) <lb/>and not the power plant. <lb/></body>

			<body>The Jorf Lasfar power plant has brought enormous advantages to the country&apos;s people. It provides <lb/>approximately 65% of Morocco&apos;s baseload electricity demand and one-third of the country&apos;s total <lb/>electricity supply. And with this monitoring system, the government and plant operators are confident that <lb/>the electricity is generated without significant adverse impacts on the environment. <lb/>Additionally, the project provides an example of the type of data that is needed to improve air quality <lb/>in polluted airsheds throughout the country. In a recent report by the World Bank, (Sarraf and Jorio, 2003), <lb/>improved air quality monitoring was cited as a top priority. &quot; Despite progress to date, much still needs to <lb/>be done in the area of air quality monitoring. Studies should be conducted not only to measure the <lb/>concentration of air pollutants and track the effectiveness of pollution control mechanisms, but also to <lb/>show the relationship between pollution and the environment, health, quality of life and natural resources, &quot; <lb/>states the report. The JLEC air quality monitoring system provides an excellent example for other <lb/>industrial and power generating plants. <lb/>Goods associated with the project <lb/>• Filter assemblies (HS 8421.39)<lb/>• Particulate samplers (HS 9027.10)<lb/>• NOx absorbers (HS 9027.10)<lb/>• SO2 absorbers (HS 9027.10)<lb/>Metro Manila Air Quality Monitoring Project <lb/>Manila, Philippines <lb/>Pollution from vehicles and industries render the air in Metropolitan Manila increasingly dangerous <lb/>for the region&apos;s approximately 20 million residents. When pediatricians were asked in the late 1990s to <lb/>identify the most common illnesses they treated, respiratory diseases were cited by 100% of the <lb/>respondents. While affluent families keep their children indoors, breathing filtered air, poor children, <lb/>especially those who beg in areas with heavy traffic, suffer chronic exposure to the heavily polluted air. <lb/>Adults suffer as well, with citizens complaining that the air on major thoroughfares leaves them dizzy and <lb/>hyperventilating. Studies by European and British health experts have demonstrated a strong link between <lb/>the region&apos;s polluted air and abnormally high rates of heart disease. <lb/>As the metropolitan population continues to grow, so does the rate of pollution emissions, taking an <lb/>increasing toll on human health. If air-quality controls are not forthcoming, it is likely that the harmful <lb/>effects of polluted air will undermine advances in economic and social development. <lb/>Cleaner air is a policy goal widely supported by citizens and leaders in the country. Indeed, the <lb/>Philippines passed an air-quality law similar to the U.S. Clean Air Act in 1999. Yet relatively little has <lb/>been done to implement the law. As in other developing nations, economic growth is the dominant priority, <lb/>and the nation lacks the resources to subsidise the costs of replacing and upgrading vehicles and installing <lb/>pollution controls on industrial emitters. <lb/>Acquiring good data on the sources and levels of air pollution is viewed as the key first step in <lb/>implementing the nation&apos;s clean-air policies. While the Philippine Department of Environment and Natural <lb/>Resources (DENR) has the legal authority to regulate emissions through fees or taxes on major emitters, <lb/>the agency must first develop greater capacity to compile specific emissions data, validate data from <lb/>emitters, collect fees, enforce penalties, and manage the resulting revenues, according to Air Pollution <lb/>Control Policy Options (Krupnick et al., 2003), a report by Resources for the Future. The agency must also <lb/></body>

			<body>determine the &quot; precise extent and distribution of stationary source and other emissions in Metro Manila, &quot; <lb/>according to the report. Of particular concern is the extent to which sulfur and SO 2 emissions must be <lb/>reduced. Existing data are old and came from just one source. &quot; Better data are critical to designing the fee <lb/>and evaluating the program, &quot; states the report. <lb/>To develop more comprehensive and reliable data on pollution levels and sources, DENR has created <lb/>the Metro Manila Air Quality Improvement Sector Development Program. With funding from the Asian <lb/>Development Bank, a major emission sampling programme was initiated in 2004. DENR contracted with <lb/>TRC Environmental Corporation (Irvine, California) for a three-year, USD 2.3 million Outsource <lb/>Sampling Program. TRC in turn contracted with a Filipino firm, Technical Experts on Environmental <lb/>Management (TEEM), to provide the manpower for data collection. The Outsource Sampling Program <lb/>involves four teams that are deploying mobile testing sets to measure stack emissions from about 1 000 <lb/>sources in metropolitan Manila. <lb/>As of November 2005, 60% of the 500 emitters tested failed one or more criteria of the Philippine <lb/>clean air law. While no enforcement action has been taken to date, the initial results indicate that there is a <lb/>high rate of non-compliance. It is anticipated that the full data set and accompanying analysis will enable <lb/>the DENR to adapt appropriate enforcement protocols. <lb/>At the conclusion of the project, the equipment — approximately USD 160 000 worth of U.S.-made <lb/>gear for measuring PM, SO 2 , NO X , CO and some metals, as well as laboratory analysis equipment — will <lb/>be turned over to the agency. Since the contract includes a training component, it is anticipated that the <lb/>DENR will develop the capacity to operate the equipment in an expanded monitoring programme after <lb/>conclusion of the contract period. <lb/>Imports of goods associated with the project <lb/>Because the project was government-funded, tariffs were waived, but clearing customs was still <lb/>extraordinarily difficult, requiring specialised consultants and approximately 40 person-hours of staff time. <lb/>With six major shipments to date, approximately 240 hours have been expended on this activity. <lb/>• Filter assemblies (HS 8421.39)<lb/>• Particulate samplers (HS 9027.10)<lb/>• NOx absorbers (HS 9027.10)<lb/>• SO2 absorbers (HS 9027.10)<lb/>• Fluid filled impingers (HS 9026.80)<lb/>Malaysia Air Quality Monitoring Network <lb/>In the early 1990s, the Malaysian government issued an unusual request for a contractor to build a <lb/>nationwide air-quality monitoring system and provide its own financing. The government sought bidders <lb/>who would finance the project&apos;s construction and operating costs in exchange for a long-term contract to <lb/>sell air quality data to the government and the rights to sell data to third-party entities such as media <lb/>outlets. The high risks involved in such an arrangement dissuaded many would-be contractors and <lb/>equipment suppliers from the United States and other developed countries, but ultimately a joint venture <lb/>between Bovar (a Canadian company that merged with Orbus Life Sciences, a pharmaceutical company, in <lb/>2002) and PIC Corp., a Malaysian company, met the government&apos;s terms. <lb/></body>

			<body>Initiated in 1995, the network has become one of the most successful air-quality monitoring <lb/>programmes in the developing world. The USD 6 million system includes 51 continuous monitoring <lb/>stations, 44 to measure CO, SO 2 , NO X , PM 10 and ozone (O 3 ), and seven to measure PM 10 only; in addition, <lb/>there are 25 manual stations for TSP, PM 10 and heavy metals which are checked every six days. The <lb/>continuous monitors provide real-time updates every hour. The average data capture rate has been more <lb/>than 95%, and the project passed an audit by the US EPA. <lb/>The 20-year contract between the joint venture, Alam Sekitar Malaysia Sdn. Bhd. (ASMA), and the <lb/>Malaysia Dept. of Environment included performance targets and penalties for nonperformance. Air <lb/>quality data sales have yielded enough revenue (approximately USD 4.8 million in 2002) to sustain the <lb/>company and finance its expansion. The company also maintains and earns revenues from a database of <lb/>water-quality data, but revenue figures are not available for that data. The ASMA staff of approximately <lb/>100 is predominantly Malay; staffing by expatriate professionals has never exceeded five. <lb/></body>

			<note place="footnote">Prior to the ASMA network, the government of Malaysia operated approximately six ambient air <lb/>montoring stations with equipment donated by the Japanese government, with all stations located in the <lb/>Klang Valley. The ASMA network provided data to assess the air quality throughout the country. <lb/>The ASMA air-quality monitoring network has greatly increased the national government&apos;s capacity <lb/>to control pollution. During extreme haze episodes, ASMA data supplied directly to the government has <lb/>been used to identify local burning, and investigators were dispatched to locate the fires and, if necessary, <lb/>fine the people or company responsible. Haze monitoring and the co-operation of the local governments in <lb/>the areas affected has improved. During the 1997 smoke-and-haze crisis, the Malaysian government used <lb/>the data to target enforcement and public health responses toward the worst affected areas. <lb/>ASMA data have since been widely used as leverage by NGOs and citizen groups seeking <lb/>improvements in air-quality policies and enforcement. ASMA data provided evidence for an August 2005 <lb/>Malaysia University of Science and Technology study, which recommends that the air-quality monitoring <lb/>network be expanded, that the state create and enforce air quality standards (as opposed to the &quot; guidelines &quot; <lb/>that now exist), and require periodic inspection of all vehicles. 1 <lb/>Transboundary haze (predominantly PM 10 ) continues to accumulate to critical levels in parts of <lb/>Malaysia, and the air-quality monitoring system is indispensable to government agencies and NGOs <lb/>seeking to respond; the data figure strongly in the country&apos;s negotiations with Indonesia in the context of <lb/>the ASEAN Transboundary Haze Agreement. <lb/>Over its 10 years of operation, ASMA has evolved to offer broader sets of environmental services <lb/>within Malaysia, including environmental impact assessment, site assessment and remediation, waste <lb/>management and control, and training in these and other fields. <lb/>Imports of goods associated with the project <lb/>Import tariffs were not a significant barrier because the project was exempted from tariffs for its first <lb/>four years, the period in which the bulk of the equipment was imported. But ASMA ran into difficulty <lb/>importing specialised beta gauges that run on a low level radioactive source, carbon-13. While not <lb/>requiring a special license in Canada (where the project managers came from), the Malaysian authorities <lb/>considered that the devices contained hazardous materials, and fined the ASMA heavily for bringing in a <lb/>shipment of the gauges without appropriate licensure. <lb/>1. <lb/>http://www.sea-uema.ait.ac.th/snp/forum1/Air_Malaysia_kennedy.pdf <lb/></note>

Air <lb/>pollution is estimated to result in net costs of at least USD 400 million annually, exacting a very serious <lb/>health consequences in the form of respiratory diseases, which are the sixth leading cause of death in <lb/>Indonesia (after accidents, diarrhoea, cardiovascular disease, tuberculosis and measles). 2 <lb/>The Indonesian government ordered the phasing out of leaded gasoline in 2001, but implementation <lb/>has been repeatedly delayed, and nationwide phase-out of leaded gasoline is now expected to be <lb/>accomplished in 2006. Lead levels in one study of children were high enough to impair cognitive <lb/>development in one-third of those tested. <lb/>Air-quality monitoring in Jakarta has historically consisted of a dispersed system of five ambient air-<lb/>quality monitoring stations that collect data of little practical use in identifying sources. In order to <lb/>generate more reliable and useful data on air pollution sources and exposure levels, the Ministry of the <lb/>Environment, the University of Indonesia, and the University of California Berkeley have collaborated to <lb/>develop and implement a unique project that uses citizen volunteers to monitor other citizens&apos; exposure to <lb/>PM and CO. The project&apos;s USD 200 000 budget has been provided by the US-Asian Environmental <lb/>Partnership (USAID), the project partners, and the Swiss Foundation for Technical Cooperation <lb/>(Swisscontact). <lb/>State-of-the-art equipment for measuring PM and CO was borrowed and purchased from <lb/>manufacturers and air-quality laboratories in the United States. It included highly sensitive devices capable <lb/>of measuring particles from 0.1 microns to 2.5 microns. Placing the equipment in backpacks and shoulder <lb/>packs, student investigators from the University of Indonesia shadowed more than 50 individuals — <lb/>students of many ages, traffic officers, a variety of workers — for 8-hour and 24-hour periods. The <lb/>investigators recorded the time, environment and conditions precisely, including such factors as whether <lb/>the air conditioning on a bus was functioning and how long the subject spent on a particular street corner. <lb/>Pollution levels were monitored continuously, with 10-second resolution. <lb/>Such a technically sophisticated measuring program is rare even in the developed world. Project <lb/>managers designed the programme to provide extraordinarily robust and precise data to provide Indonesian <lb/>air quality management policy makers with tools to craft and implement effective regulations in a cost-<lb/>efficient and timely manner. By screening particle sizes so precisely, the resulting data will identify the <lb/>types and locations of pollution sources with unusual specificity. Data analysis was still underway at the <lb/>time this report was being written. <lb/></body>

			<body>The project was also geared to empower Indonesian staff and volunteers to gain the technical <lb/>expertise necessary to continue and expand such monitoring programmes. It has reportedly inspired <lb/>officials at the city and national environmental agencies with a vision of what can be accomplished in <lb/>terms of effective monitoring. However, additional resources and training will be required to assure that <lb/>future monitoring yields reliable data. <lb/>Imports of goods associated with the project <lb/>To avoid the delays and unusual fees associated with Indonesian customs, project equipment was <lb/>brought into the country as personal luggage by professional consultants travelling to the country. <lb/>Importing the equipment commercially would have caused delays of 8 to 12 weeks and added significant <lb/>costs. <lb/>• Filter assemblies (HS 8421.39)<lb/>• Particulate samplers (HS 9027.10)<lb/>• CO absorbers, analyzers, calibrators (HS 9027.10)<lb/>Fuel Testing for Air Quality Project <lb/>Tamil Nadu, India <lb/>Air quality in Indian cities has deteriorated over the last decade due in large measure to the sharp <lb/>increase in the number and use of motor vehicles of all types. In addition to the increase in numbers of <lb/>vehicles and emissions, there is widespread evidence that the air-quality problems are compounded by <lb/>retail gasoline dealers who adulterate gasoline and diesel with less expensive hydrocarbon fuels. Gasoline <lb/>is typically adulterated with solvents such as hexane, benzene, toluene, naphtha and other hydrocarbon <lb/>mixtures having the boiling range within that of gasoline, while diesel is typically adulterated with <lb/>kerosene. Vehicles powered by adulterated fuel emit high levels of air pollutants, including PM, CO, NO X , <lb/>SO 2 , and polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH). The price differential between gasoline purchased <lb/>from oil companies and these materials presents an irresistible profit opportunity to many fuel dealers. <lb/>Even imported kerosene is less expensive than domestic diesel fuel. <lb/>Oil companies have begun testing fuel at retail outlets, but it is believed that fuel adulterated by as <lb/>much as 30% still tests clean because of the range of values in the testing methods of the Bureau of Indian <lb/>Standards (BIS), and also because the high-quality fuels provided by oil companies can accommodate <lb/>significant adulteration without violating BIS specifications. <lb/>In 1999, CONCERT (the Center for Consumer Education, Research Teaching, Training and Testing) <lb/>in Chennai (formerly Madras), Tamil Nadu, took samples from 21 retail fuel outlets in Chennai. Using a <lb/>gas chromatograph method developed by a professor at the Indian Institute of Technology, CONCERT&apos;s <lb/>research showed a high level of adulteration of diesel and gasoline in all 21 samples. <lb/>To more rigorously test for fuel adulteration, CONCERT proposed establishing a fuel-testing <lb/>laboratory with a gas chromatographic to compare fuel obtained from retail outlets with fuel obtained from <lb/>distribution depots and refineries. With funding and support from the Environmental Partnership Grant <lb/>Program of the U.S. Council of State Governments, the US-Asian Environmental Partnership and the <lb/>government of Tamil Nadu, and technical support and training from the California Air Resources Board, <lb/>the project broke ground in 2003 and began operating in 2004. <lb/></body>

			<body>After analyzing more than 60 retail gasoline and diesel fuel samples, CONCERT&apos;s data was highly <lb/>suggestive of contamination because adulterants were found at the high end of allowable concentrations. <lb/>Armed with evidence of likely fuel adulteration, CONCERT intends to expand its sampling programme, <lb/>upgrade and procure additional laboratory equipment, establish a mobile laboratory to collect and test <lb/>samples in the field, seek greater enforcement by government agencies, and increase outreach to retail fuel <lb/>dealers. CONCERT believes widespread fuel testing, coupled with greater enforcement, would <lb/>significantly improve air quality throughout India. CONCERT has informed the public and government <lb/>about the results of their fuel testing, and the agency is now working with the local air-quality agency and <lb/>NGOs to create more stringent fuel specifications. <lb/>All the equipment purchased for CONCERT&apos;s Fuel Testing Laboratory were indigenously <lb/>manufactured. Project managers would have preferred to purchase automated equipment with <lb/>computerized data-logging to speed up the process and increase the number of samples analyzed per unit <lb/>of time and labor. But the necessary resources were not available. While the Indian-made equipment took <lb/>longer to operate, it did not compromise the accuracy of analysis. <lb/>Sophisticated analytical equipment for fuel analysis is imported into India, but it is only utilised by the <lb/>oil companies for quality control and for research related to refinery operations. CONCERT staff believe <lb/>that if such equipment could be purchased, and if testing facilities could be established in every Indian <lb/>state, the nation&apos;s fuel supply --and hence its air quality --would be greatly improved. <lb/>Goods associated with the project <lb/>As noted above, in this project, the project participants from the United States lent expertise only; all <lb/>the equipment was procured within India. It included: <lb/>• Gas chromatograph <lb/> • Distillation unit <lb/> • Reid vapour pressure apparatus <lb/> • Pout point apparatus <lb/> • Hot air oven <lb/> • Viscosity bath <lb/> • Abel flash point apparatus <lb/> • Sample storage refrigerator <lb/> • Ramsbottom carbon residue apparatus <lb/> • Cold filter plug point apparatus <lb/> • Copper corrosion bath <lb/> • Extraction apparatus <lb/> • Aniline point test assembly <lb/> • Oxidation stability apparatus<lb/></body>
