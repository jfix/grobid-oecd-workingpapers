			<front>© OECD 2007 <lb/>5 <lb/>PREFACE <lb/>This working paper is a direct contribution to the newly created OECD Global Forum on <lb/>Development that was launched in 2006. <lb/>This Forum has been created with the aim of improving dialogue between OECD and <lb/>non-member governments, as well as private and civil society actors. During the Forum&apos;s first <lb/>thematic cycle (2006-2009), participants are invited to identify options for a more effective <lb/>development finance system. The OECD Development Centre is actively and deeply involved in <lb/>this process. One of its objectives is to look beyond aid and foresee the potential synergies <lb/>between different types of actors, public and private, national and international, governmental <lb/>and non-governmental, involved in development finance activities. <lb/>The aim of this paper is precisely to contribute to this debate and process. It highlights <lb/>how private banks and other private financial operators like private equity firms and <lb/>investments funds, can play a pivotal role in economic development. All in all, they are <lb/>interesting potential partners for public aid donors willing to deepen impacts on developing <lb/>countries. As documented, some of the private banking firms are more active in specific regions. <lb/>UK and French banks seem, for example, to be potential interesting partners for aid donors in <lb/>Africa while Spanish banks or US counterparts are more relevant for Latin America and German, <lb/>Swiss and Italian banks for Eastern Europe. Beyond international banks, local private banks in <lb/>Brazil, India, South Africa, Morocco and other developing countries are becoming increasingly <lb/>aware and sensitive to economic, social and environmental impacts. <lb/>Several policy recommendations are made in the conclusions. One of them is to create a <lb/>Prize on Development Finance that could reward best practices of public and private <lb/>partnerships in development finance. The OECD Global Forum on Development could host such <lb/>a Prize as it intends to strengthen the dialogue between aid donors and private actors working <lb/>on development issues and investing in developing countries. The objective of the OECD <lb/>Development Finance Prize would be to underline already existing best practices and, through a <lb/>worldwide media campaign (like the one developed by the IFC and the Financial Times), to <lb/>stimulate projects between donors and private banks, asset managers and equity firms. <lb/>Javier Santiso <lb/>Acting Director and Chief Development Economist <lb/>OECD Development Centre <lb/>November 2007 <lb/>Banking on Development: Private Banks and Aid Donors in Developing Countries <lb/>DEV/DOC(2007)6 <lb/>6 <lb/>© OECD 2007 <lb/>RÉSUMÉ <lb/>Au cours de ces dix dernières années, nous avons pu observer une double convergence. <lb/>D&apos;une part, l&apos;intérêt des donneurs d&apos;aide pour le secteur privé s&apos;est accru, et d&apos;autre part, les <lb/>banques privées ont développé des programmes pour promouvoir la responsabilité sociale des <lb/>entreprises, le crédit soutenable, et des projets dans le domaine de la microfinance. En <lb/>conséquence, le dialogue entre les banques privées et les donneurs d&apos;aide s&apos;est intensifié, ce qui <lb/>laisse entrevoir une collaboration plus étroite à l&apos;avenir. Le but de ce papier est d&apos;évaluer <lb/>précisément le potentiel de ces synergies entre banques privées et donneurs d&apos;aide. Dans <lb/>l&apos;objectif de réaliser un outil d&apos;analyse pertinent et d&apos;aider à identifier des partenaires potentiels <lb/>pour les donneurs d&apos;aide, nous avons conduit une étude des crédits accordés par les banques <lb/>privées aux pays en développement afin de repérer les institutions financières privées les plus <lb/>actives au sein de ces économies. Nous montrons qu&apos;il existe une division internationale dans <lb/>l&apos;activité de prêt des banques : les banques des pays donneurs opèrent une spécialisation <lb/>régionale dans les pays en développement. La réalisation d&apos;une telle étude de l&apos;activité créditrice <lb/>des banques privées permet également d&apos;introduire un exercice de repérage des meilleures <lb/>pratiques, au niveau micro, des projets spécifiques développés conjointement par les banques <lb/>privées et les donneurs d&apos;aide. Nous dégageons les principaux cas d&apos;étude, dans l&apos;objectif de <lb/>repérer les meilleures opportunités de coopération internationale et de mise en place de <lb/>partenariats public/privé entre les banques privées et les donneurs d&apos;aide. <lb/>Mots clé : Banques, Crédit, Donneurs d&apos;aide, Finance du développement, Afrique, Amérique <lb/>latine, Asie <lb/></front>

			<front>© OECD 2007 <lb/>7 <lb/>ABSTRACT <lb/>Over the past decade we have witnessed a double convergence. Aid donors have <lb/>developed a growing interest in the private sector while private banks have set about creating <lb/>corporate social responsibility programs, sustainable lending and microfinance programmes. As <lb/>a consequence, the dialogue between private banks and aid donors has been intensifying, <lb/>opening new avenues for collaboration. The aim of this paper is to map the potential synergies <lb/>between private banks and aid donors. A survey of private bank lending towards developing <lb/>countries is undertaken in order to identify the private banks most active in those economies and <lb/>provide an analytical tool to help identify the scope for public and private partnerships. We find <lb/>an international division of labour in bank lending: within the developing world, banks from <lb/>OECD countries tend to focus their credit on specific regions and countries. This mapping of <lb/>private bank lending also allows us to pinpoint concrete examples of best practices in private <lb/>bank and financial actors/aid donors collaborations. We follow by discussing some of the more <lb/>important cases in the field, and conclude with the potential implications for improved <lb/>partnerships between private banks and donor organisations. <lb/>JEL Classification: F3; O1; G21. <lb/>Key words: Banks; Lending; Aid donors; Development Finance; Africa; Latin America; Asia. <lb/>Banking on Development: Private Banks and Aid Donors in Developing Countries <lb/>DEV/DOC(2007)6 <lb/>8 <lb/>© OECD 2007 <lb/></front>

			<body>I. INTRODUCTION <lb/> &quot; The life of money making is one undertaken under compulsion, and wealth is evidently not the <lb/>good we are seeking; for it is merely useful and for the sake of something else &quot; . <lb/>Aristotle, The Nichomachean Ethics, Book I.5, written around 350 B.C. <lb/>Over the past decade we have witnessed a double convergence. Aid donors have <lb/>developed an increasing interest in the private sector while private banks have created corporate <lb/>social responsibility programs, sustainable lending or microfinance programmes. This paper <lb/>aims to map potential synergies between private banks and aid donors. <lb/>Over the course of the first OECD Global Forum on Development, held in early <lb/>April 2007, many aid donors expressed a growing interest for a deeper dialogue with the private <lb/>sector, including corporations or foundations, for example 1 . This interest found echo in the first <lb/>flagship publication of the OECD Development Centre on development financing (OECD, <lb/>2007a), which argued on the need to go beyond aid and incorporate new actors into the financing <lb/>of development. The 2005 OECD Development Assistance Committee (DAC) annual report also <lb/>stressed the fundamental importance of this deepening dialogue with the private sector (OECD, <lb/>2007b). <lb/>Over the past decade, bilateral donors have developed new financial tools and <lb/>institutions to improve their work with developing countries. Following the assumption that <lb/>public money may be a catalyst for private resources, leading donor agencies have strived to <lb/>mobilise private sector resources and capacities for poverty reduction. Most European donors, <lb/>for example, have established Development Finance Institutions (DFIs) operating on a <lb/>commercial basis, that have become an integral part of government development policy. <lb/>For instance, in 2005, Switzerland established the Swiss Investment Fund for Emerging <lb/>Markets (SIFEM) 2 , as a spin-off of SECO (Swiss State Secretariat for Economic Affairs, one of the <lb/>main national institutions in charge of development cooperation). In collaboration with other <lb/>donor agencies such as Proparco (the French Development Finance Institution, a subsidiary of <lb/>1. <lb/>See the web page devoted to the OECD Global Forum on Development: http://www.oecd.org/dev <lb/>2. <lb/>See for more information: http://www.sifem.ch/ <lb/></body>

			<body>the French Development Agency 3 ) or the Belgian Investment Company for Developing <lb/>Countries (BIO <lb/>4 ), SIFEM now participates in many private equity projects around the developing <lb/>world, working with local private financial operators like Tuninvest in Tunisia, Fidelity Capital <lb/>Partners (a private venture capital and private equity company, subsidiary of Fidelity <lb/>Investment) in Ghana, Ethos in South Africa, Nexxus in Mexico or BTS Investment Advisors in <lb/>India 5 . As we will see, these initiatives are not the only ones where private and public <lb/>institutions have converged to boost development projects. <lb/>These national financial institutions also developed the European Development Finance <lb/>Institutions (EDFI) network, a group of fifteen bilateral institutions providing long-term capital <lb/>for private sector enterprises in developing and reforming economies. The institutions in this <lb/>group share common objectives but are quite different in the way they develop their operations. <lb/>Some of them are still mostly financial institutions offering capital and advice to joint venture <lb/>enterprises in developing countries, and collaborating on projects with national. Danish IFU, <lb/>Swedish Swedfund or Spanish COFIDES <lb/>6 , both members of EDFI, support projects mostly in a <lb/>context of Danish or Spanish companies&apos; involvement. <lb/>Other members like CDC 7 , a UK government-owned fund with nearly $3 billion of net <lb/>assets, work actively with worldwide private equity partners like London based Aureos Capital, <lb/>Indian based Barings Private Partners or ICICI Venture, Canadian based Cordiant or Citigroup <lb/>Venture Capital <lb/>8 . As an example, in 2007 CDC backed a new African initiative, committing <lb/>$100 million to Citigroup&apos;s first private equity vehicle entirely dedicated to Africa. The <lb/>Netherlands Development Finance Company (FMO) <lb/>9 , another leading and very active EDFI, <lb/>3. <lb/>See http://www.proparco.fr/. Interestingly, among the institutions that fund Proparco are also some <lb/>French private banks like BNP Paribas, Société Générale, Natixis, Dexia Crédit Local or other private <lb/>financial institutions like COFACE or Gras Savoye. African banks or other financial institutions from <lb/>developing countries also participate in the capital, for example, Banque Marocaine du Commerce <lb/>Extérieur, Aga Khan Fund for Economic Development (AKFED) or Banque de Tunisie. The Aga Khan <lb/>Fund is particularly interesting. It is an international development agency dedicated to promoting <lb/>entrepreneurship and building economically sound enterprises in the developing world. On Aga Khan <lb/>Fund see http://www.akdn.org/agency/akfed.html <lb/>4. <lb/>http://www.b-i-o.be/ <lb/>5. <lb/>See: http://www.tuninvest.com/; <lb/>http://fidelitycapitalpartners.com/; http://www.btsadvisors.com/; <lb/>http://www.nexxuscapital.com/; and http://www.ethos.co.za/live/index.php <lb/>6. <lb/>See http://www.ifu.dk/http://www.swedfund.se/; and http://www.cofides.es/. Swedfund developed an <lb/>interesting strategy of partnering with private sector asset managers and private equity companies like <lb/>East Capital (http://www.eastcapital.com/) or Swedish companies like Tetra Pak or Ikea. Interestingly, <lb/>as for Proparco, COFIDES also has private banks involved in its core capital, mainly BBVA, Santander <lb/>and Banco Sabadell. <lb/>7. <lb/>See http://www.cdcgroup.com/ <lb/>8. <lb/>See <lb/>http://www.aureos.com/; <lb/>https://www.citigroupai.com/; <lb/>http://www.bpepindia.com/; <lb/>http://www.iciciventure.com/; and http://www.cordiantcap.com/. <lb/>9. <lb/>FMO was formed in 1970 through a partnership between the Dutch government (the majority <lb/>shareholder with 51 per cent) and Dutch financial institutions like ABN Amro, ING and Rabobank, In <lb/></body>

			<body>© OECD 2007 <lb/>launched with Citigroup in 2006 a $540 million risk sharing facility aimed at providing loans to <lb/>small and medium sized companies in poor countries. This was the first global partnership <lb/>between an EDFI institution and a leading private retail bank. EDFIs have even participated in <lb/>the creation of private equity companies, one of the most dynamic being Aureos Capital, created <lb/>in 2001 by two leading EDFIs, the Norwegian Norfund (Norwegian Investment Fund for <lb/>Developing Countries) and the UK&apos;s CDC Capital Partners 10 . <lb/>Private banks have also shown an increasing awareness of social, environmental or <lb/>labour issues in developing countries. In the course of their global expansion and acquisitions, <lb/>OECD-based bankers have encountered new realities, constraints and opportunities in <lb/>developing countries. Through either their lending operations, retail business on the ground or <lb/>investment banking and asset management activities, emerging markets and developing <lb/>countries have gradually grown to become core business areas. In parallel, when faced with <lb/>increased pressures and demands from NGOs, activist investors and government pressures, <lb/>private banks have also developed new programmes of sustainable lending and investment, and <lb/>corporate social responsibility. These private institutions have thus found themselves entering <lb/>projects in which they, directly or indirectly, may find themselves working to provide public <lb/>goods such as education, health, microfinance and remittances-related services to the poor. <lb/>Private banks have also become involved in infrastructure projects, and increasingly often <lb/>sealing partnerships with the public sector in many countries. In Brazil, the ABN Amro <lb/>subsidiary Banco Real 11 became a leading provider of micro-credits and grants to the poor for <lb/>education related activities. Spanish banks, which are heavily involved in Latin America, have <lb/>multiplied their initiatives throughout the region. Banco Santander, for example, promoted the <lb/>creation of a huge educational platform Universia 12 . Both of Spain&apos;s leading banks, Santander and <lb/>BBVA 13 , in 2000 participated together with other ministries and private corporations in the <lb/>creation of the Fundación Carolina, a unique Spanish institution funded by both the public and <lb/>private sectors whose aim is to provide grants for Latin American wishing to pursue studies in <lb/>Spain 14 . <lb/>2007, FMO has an investment portfolio of almost €2 billion and a staff of more than 200. It is one of the <lb/>largest bilateral private sector oriented development banks worldwide. <lb/>10. See http://www.norfund.no/. Norfund also participated in the creation of another private equity <lb/>company, specializing in renewable energy related investments in Asia, Africa and Latin America: SN <lb/>Power. See http://www.snpowerinvest.com/ <lb/>11. See http://www.bancoreal.com.br/. In 2006, Banco Real doubled its microfinance clients (350 000 <lb/>worldwide) and consolidated its sustainable banking division.

			<body>II. BANK LENDING IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES <lb/>Bank(er)s have been very active in developing economies over the past decades, either <lb/>through bank lending or through securities markets. The rising number of foreign claims (loans <lb/>made and deposits placed in other countries) is a good measure of the rapid internationalisation <lb/>of banking over the past decades. Nonetheless, it is not the only way in which OECD private <lb/>banks have been involved in emerging countries. <lb/>Over the past decades, OECD private banks have invested in and acquired major banks in <lb/>developing countries 15 , boosting the share of foreign bank credit in total domestic credit: South <lb/>America, for example, saw a jump from less than 6 per cent to nearly 40 per cent in 2005 16 . US <lb/>and Spanish banks have been the most active in developing countries: between 1990 and 2003, <lb/>they invested respectively $74 and $68 billion in developing countries, far ahead of UK <lb/>($38 billion), German ($34 billion) or French ($32 billion) banks (Goldberg, 2007). <lb/>Investment banks and asset managers did not stay behind in the emerging markets gold <lb/>rush, investing through their regional or global emerging market funds <lb/>17 . International bank <lb/>lending also provides a good indicator of a division of labour that aids us in identifying key <lb/>potential partners and synergies for public sector aid donors. The sums involved are quite <lb/>15. On internationalisation towards emerging markets, see Moreno and Villar, 2005; Domanski, 2005; <lb/>Arena et al, 2006; Levy-Yeyati and Micco, 2007; Cerutti et al, 2007, and on banking internationalisation <lb/>processes in general, see Schoenmaker and van Laecke, 2007. <lb/>16. Obviously the differences between regions, Africa and Latin America, or even within a region are <lb/>important, foreign banks being much more present in some areas or countries than others. In Latin <lb/>America, foreign banks&apos; credit as a share of total domestic credit has jumped from less than 1 per cent to <lb/>more than 90 per cent in a country like Mexico, between 1990 and 2005, In Costa Rica it is still lower <lb/>than 1 per cent in 2005. In Belize, Bolivia or Panama, the share has been decreasing over the same <lb/>period (BIS, 2007). <lb/>17. Not all the regions enjoyed a boom of portfolio flows, Africa remaining largely a &quot; frontier &quot; market with <lb/>less bond and equity flows than other emerging markets areas like Asia or Latin America. Most of the <lb/>Africa dedicated funds created in the 1990s by asset managers have been short lived, most of them <lb/>closing at the beginning of the 2000s. By 2006 only seven of the Africa dedicated equity funds remained <lb/>active. Interestingly, however, a new generation of funds started by the mid 2000s with asset managers <lb/>like Investec opening a Pan-African Fund. For Global Emerging Markets Funds, investing worldwide, <lb/>Africa represents 10 per cent of the total holdings, South Africa being by far the largest African holding <lb/>of this category of funds. The 11 other African markets, where some investments are registered, <lb/>attracted only a combined 0.03 per cent of total assets of global emerging markets funds. For a complete <lb/>review of foreign institutional investors&apos; activity in Africa see Moss, Ramachandran, Standley, 2007. <lb/></body>

			<body>impressive: according to BIS, the total claims flowing from OECD private banks to emerging <lb/>economies in 2005 reached $230 billion, an amount twice as large as the total OECD official aid to <lb/>developing countries 18 . <lb/>That said, bank flows to emerging markets remain much weaker than those crossing <lb/>borders between OECD countries: total cross-border claims of BIS reporting banks expanded by <lb/>nearly 3 000 billion in developed countries in 2005, ten times more than in developing countries. <lb/>All in all, by the end of 2005, the stock of cross-border claims of BIS reporting banks was <lb/>$21 450 billion (BIS, 2006). Of this total, the bulk was directed to OECD developed economies, all <lb/>of them democracies. Only $2 396 billion, less than 11 per cent of the total, went to emerging <lb/>markets economies, the bulk of which went to emerging democracies such as South Korea, <lb/>Brazil, and Mexico. A country like China only concentrates a stock of $114.6 billion of cross-<lb/>border bank claims, less than 0.53 per cent of the world stock 19 . <lb/>Private foreign bank lending nonetheless constitutes a substantial fraction of <lb/>development financing in emerging countries. As mentioned above, bank flows towards <lb/>emerging countries are very low (in nominal terms) when compared with OECD countries. <lb/>Despite this, bank loans are still very important for developing economies for despite actual <lb/>amounts received are much lower than their OECD counterparts in nominal terms they represent <lb/>a relatively high percentage of GDP. For example, in 2005, bank loans received by Brazil, Mexico <lb/>and South Korea were equivalent to 20.1 per cent, 34.3 per cent, and 28 per cent of their GDP, <lb/>respectively. Predictably, financial depth is lower in Latin America and Africa than in developed <lb/>countries: during the 1990s credit to the private sector represented a paltry 21 per cent of GDP in <lb/>sub-Saharan Africa and 28 per cent of GDP in Latin America, in comparison with the 84 per cent <lb/>of GDP in developed countries (BIS, 2007). <lb/>Of particular relevance for aid donors looking to promote economic, social, <lb/>environmental and political development in emerging economies, private bankers have, over the <lb/>past decade, also begun, in their assessment of investment decisions, begun to take new variables <lb/>into account. In 2003, for example, a leading group of top global bankers adopted the Equator <lb/>Principles, an unprecedented initiative led by 10 of the world&apos;s largest banks to address the social <lb/>and environmental impact of the projects that they finance 20 . Based on IFC&apos;s environmental and <lb/>social standards and developed with IFC&apos;s advice, the Principles are a voluntary set of guidelines <lb/>for managing environmental and social issues in project finance lending. Since then, all the big <lb/>18. This is in fact the tip of the iceberg of international banking involvement in developing countries as, <lb/>through the acquisitions processes, there has been an important shift towards more local activities, <lb/>through branches and subsidiaries, with the subsequent implication that direct cross border activities <lb/>are only part of the picture, with local lending by foreign banks in developing countries also being on <lb/>the rise as underlined by the IMF (IMF, 2007). <lb/>19. In terms of bank assets the picture does not change as bank assets vis-à-vis OECD developed countries <lb/>account for 37 per cent of world GDP and bank assets vis-à-vis emerging economies less than 3 per cent <lb/>of world GDP. <lb/>20. See http://www.equator-principles.com/. For a critical monitoring of this initiative by a group of leading <lb/>NGOs see BankTrack, Principles, profits or just PR?

			<body>names in project finance (46 in total by early 2007, accounting for around 85 per cent of the <lb/>world&apos;s cross-border project finance and 80 per cent of the lending market by the end of 2006 <lb/>21 ) <lb/>have signed up for this series of guidelines for assessing their project finance deals, based on <lb/>those used by the International Finance Corporation (IFC), the World Bank&apos;s private financing arm <lb/>(see Eiris, 2006 for an evaluation). As a result, the Equator Principles have become the project <lb/>finance industry&apos;s global standard for addressing environmental and social issues. <lb/>OECD banks with such impeccably capitalist credentials as Citibank, Standard Chartered, <lb/>Calyon, Dexia, Credit Suisse, Intesa Sanpaolo, Dresdner, BBVA, ABN Amro or HSBC have all <lb/>been eager to prove that their operations can measure up on sustainability goals. In 2006, a new <lb/>revised set of guidelines (Equator II) was produced and approved by private banks, again with <lb/>the help of the IFC. Equator II expands requirements for labour conditions, community health, <lb/>safety and security. In complement to this, the IFC and the Financial Times launched in 2006 a <lb/>sustainable banking award. The following year, more than 151 institutions from 51 countries <lb/>submitted entries to the 2007 FT Sustainable Banking Awards, over 50 per cent more than the <lb/>98 entries submitted to the inaugural 2006 Awards, a testimony to the programme&apos;s success and <lb/>banks&apos; increasing awareness of the issues promoted by the initiative. <lb/>Dialogue between private banks and aid donors has also been intensifying on a number <lb/>of levels, opening new avenues for collaboration.

More precisely we find an international division of <lb/>bank lending: UK banks are, for example, much more active in Africa than any others, along with <lb/>some French based banks, while Spanish banks remain attached to Latin America, a region <lb/>where US banks are also heavily involved. In Asia, the leading private lenders are UK based <lb/>banks, followed by US banks. In Eastern Europe, Austrian and German banks dominate lending <lb/>activities, although, after recent mergers and acquisitions operations, Italian and Belgian banks <lb/>are also becoming increasingly heavy players in this region. Other private lenders like Dutch, <lb/>Swedish or Swiss banks have a more global and balanced portfolio. <lb/>For aid donors willing to develop financing programs with private bank actors, Spanish <lb/>banks would be the natural partners in Latin America, while French or UK banks would be more <lb/>suited for African related projects, as US and UK banks might be in Asia. In Eastern Europe, the <lb/>natural partners would be German and Austrian private banks, along with perhaps Italian and <lb/>Belgian banks. <lb/>The mapping of private bank lending also helps introduce a more micro-exercise, relating <lb/>to the specific projects already developed by private bankers and aid donors. We identify <lb/>outstanding case studies and best practices, with the objective of underlining the available <lb/>avenues for international cooperation activities in terms of public/private partnerships between <lb/>private banks and aid donors. <lb/>26.

			<body>III. PRIVATE BANK LENDING FLOWS TO EMERGING MARKETS: <lb/>STYLISED FACTS <lb/>The current trend of increasing financial integration and the opening up of emerging <lb/>countries to capital flows has brought about a sharp increase in foreign bank claims over the past <lb/>decade. This brought private international loans to reach the equivalent to 48.3 per cent of global <lb/>GDP in 2005 27 , more than the total of international trade flows combined with global foreign <lb/>direct investment and tourist receipts (from 32 per cent in 1999 — a jump of more than <lb/>16 percentage points in only half a decade). In real terms, foreign claims in all non-BIS reporting <lb/>countries <lb/>28 rose by more than 120 per cent, while claims in developing countries jumped by more <lb/>than 100 per cent. <lb/>Among emerging countries, Latin America and Eastern Europe experienced the biggest <lb/>increase, rising by more than 110 per cent and 165 per cent respectively. It is interesting to note <lb/>that both of these regions are where democratisation and the consolidation of democracy have <lb/>been the most intensive <lb/>29 . <lb/>27. The Bank for International Settlements, which monitors the foreign claims held by banks mostly from <lb/>OECD countries vis-à-vis the rest of the world, defines these claims as those authorised by international <lb/>banks on residents outside the country in which they are headquartered. Foreign claims may range <lb/>from assets such as loans, debt securities to equities, including equity stakes in local subsidiaries. <lb/>28. There are a total of 40 BIS reporting countries in 2007, i.e. financial centers providing locational banking <lb/>data. Not all OECD countries provide this data (this is the case, for example, of Iceland or Poland). <lb/>Some non-OECD and developing countries like Chile or Brazil do provide this data to the BIS. The <lb/>major non-BIS reporting emerging countries are Argentina, China, Russia, and South Africa. There is no <lb/>BIS reporting country from Africa. <lb/>29. For an analysis of the relations between democracy and private bank lending, see Rodríguez and <lb/>Santiso, 2007. <lb/></body>

Financing has the <lb/>advantage of being less restricted than trade, tourism, direct and portfolio investments and <lb/>remittances. For trade and tourism flows, distance is the determining factor: the greater the <lb/>distance between countries, the greater the transaction cost. The situation is similar for <lb/>remittances, which reflect in general migration patterns, which are more based on proximity or <lb/>historical or cultural ties <lb/>In contrast, foreign claims are not limited either by distance or other limiting factors, and <lb/>therefore have few constraints with regards the destination of funds. The greater dynamism of <lb/>foreign claim flows should also be emphasised in that loans can be granted or received <lb/>immediately, since little information is needed to carry out a transaction and the time required <lb/>for closing such deals is minimal. The reduced time involved favours foreign claim flows, <lb/>compared with trade or direct investments, which require longer periods for closure. Foreign <lb/>claims are also more liquid than other fund flows. <lb/>In order to define the mapping of private bank lending flows to developing countries, we <lb/>draw on the BIS&apos;s &quot;Consolidated Foreign Claims of Reporting Banks on Individual Countries&quot; <lb/>statistical series for the period from the fourth quarter of 1983 to the first quarter of 2006. The BIS <lb/>collates data on the international loans of private banks and deposit organisations worldwide, <lb/>and separates data on domestic loans from foreign loans. Domestic loans are those advanced to <lb/>third persons resident in the country where the bank is based. The BIS does not provide any <lb/>information on these operations. <lb/>Foreign loans are provided to third persons resident in a different country from the one <lb/>where the bank is based. These foreign claims can also be divided into: i) cross-border positions <lb/>— for example, credits granted by the head office of a Spanish bank to a Mexican organisation — <lb/>and ii) local positions, managed, for example, by a Mexican branch of a Spanish bank. At the <lb/>same time, credits granted by local branches may be divided into those denominated in foreign <lb/>currencies and those denominated in local currency. The concept of Foreign Claims, as <lb/>developed by the BIS, includes all loans granted by one country to another, independent of the <lb/>currency in which they were made and also of where they were granted (either by the head office <lb/>or one of its branches). The BIS periodically publishes this data in their Consolidated Banking <lb/></body>

			<body>Statistics as well as what it defines as International Claims, where it only includes foreign currency <lb/>positions, independent of where they were granted <lb/>30 . <lb/>The 27 countries that report the international operations of their banks and deposit <lb/>institutions to the BIS are: Austria; Belgium; Brazil; Canada; Chile; Chinese Taipei; Denmark; <lb/>Finland; France; Germany; Hong Kong, China; India; Ireland; Italy; Japan; Luxembourg; <lb/>Norway; Panama; the Netherlands; Singapore; Spain; Sweden; Switzerland; Turkey, the UK and <lb/>the US. The respective banking authorities of these countries compile the information and send it <lb/>on a quarterly basis to the BIS 31 . <lb/>A detailed analysis of the data shows that international financing is dominated by a <lb/>limited number of countries. The 27 countries that report to the BIS issue overseas credits <lb/>totalling $23.5 trillion (2006). This is equivalent to approximately 95 per cent of total private <lb/>international loans according to the BIS. There are, however, other countries not included in the <lb/>list of those that report to the BIS which are net issuers of international loans, such as some oil <lb/>exporting countries (Russia, Saudi Arabia). The figures also show that the recipients of <lb/>international loans are strongly concentrated. <lb/>As well as being the main issuers of international loans, the more developed countries are <lb/>also the main recipients. That is to say, loans are made mainly between developed countries. In <lb/>2006, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Japan, the <lb/>Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, the UK and the US accounted for 81.5 per cent of the <lb/>total loans issued by the countries that report to the BIS, and in turn received 75 per cent of the <lb/>total. <lb/></body>

			<note place="footnote">30. It is possible to argue that when using for this paper the concept of Foreign Claims instead of <lb/>International Claims, we measure the degree of internationalisation of a particular bank in any country, <lb/>as well as the extent of its overseas lending. However, it is impossible to do it in any other way. Most of <lb/>the countries that report to the BIS do not segment their International Claims by country, as is the case <lb/>with Germany or Switzerland. Since these two countries are respectively the leading and third most <lb/>important sources of international financing, any analysis of international flows that is carried out <lb/>without including this data would fail to give a true picture of the situation. It should be pointed out <lb/>that the BIS statistics do not entirely reflect the liabilities incurred among different entities in different <lb/>countries. For example, if a Spanish bank issues debt abroad, it is entered in the statistics. But issues <lb/>carried out in Spain are not reflected in the statistics even though they were mainly taken up, for <lb/>example, by French banks. It is important not to forget that these statistics reflect the activity of private <lb/>entities, which by their nature are more sophisticated and complex than those of the State. For example, <lb/>if a Spanish organisation finances a French company, one could assume that one was dealing with a <lb/>credit flow from Spain to France. But if that credit is backed by guarantees issued by a third-party <lb/>resident in Brazil, what would appear to be exposure to French risk could be transformed under certain <lb/>conditions into Brazilian risk. For each one of these categories, the BIS compiles separate series of <lb/>statistics; such as its &quot;Signed International Syndicated Credit Facilities&quot;, &quot;International Debt Securities&quot; and its <lb/>&quot;Amounts Outstanding of Over-The-Counter (OTC) Derivatives &quot;. <lb/>31.

			<body>© OECD 2007 <lb/>During the 2000s, European banks have been the main financing organisations <lb/>worldwide. In 2006, Germany, the UK, Switzerland, France and the Netherlands accounted for <lb/>50.6 per cent of loans globally, with Germany the leading lender with 13.4 per cent of total loans <lb/>granted globally. On the other hand, the country that receives most private loans is the US, with <lb/>22.5 per cent of the total. The US is the main recipient of international funds, sourced mainly <lb/>from Europe. The five European countries mentioned above receive 32.9 per cent of total loans. <lb/>They therefore grant more loans than they receive, while the US grants only 5.23 per cent and <lb/>receives 22.5 per cent of the total. Since banks only grant loans when they believe the principal <lb/>and interest charges are recoverable, logic dictates that developed countries be the main <lb/>recipients of credit because of their better risk-return profile and repayment capacity. <lb/>France is a case of particular interest that deserves some specific attention. It is the major <lb/>source of finance for countries to which the US does not lend, for political or other reasons. In <lb/>2006, France was the principal lender to 37 countries, 20 of which receive no finance from the US <lb/>(out of the 67 countries to which the US does not provide loans). This means that 30 per cent of <lb/>the countries that receive no funding from the US rely on France as their main source of <lb/>financing (down from 40 per cent in 2004). Of the 47 remaining countries to which the US does <lb/>not grant loans, Germany is the main source of funding for 10 of them. In 2006, France and <lb/>Germany together therefore provided finance to approximately 45 per cent of these countries <lb/>(65 per cent in 2004). <lb/>France and Germany are also an important source of financing for countries that are, or <lb/>have been, on non-friendly terms with the US. In 2006, Germany, for example, was the main <lb/>lender to Syria and Libya, and France to Afghanistan, Cuba, Iran, Iraq, North Korea, Somalia and <lb/>Vietnam. <lb/></body>

A WORLD MAP OF INTERNATIONAL PRIVATE BANK LENDING <lb/>DIVISION OF LABOUR <lb/>Several conclusions may be drawn from a detailed study of the destination of bank loans <lb/>to emerging countries. By region, Latin America and the Caribbean were the main recipients of <lb/>private bank flows in the mid-1980s, a phenomenon that has since subsided somewhat. At the <lb/>end of 1984, Latin America and the Caribbean were receiving 47 per cent of the flows to <lb/>emerging countries, while Africa received about 21 per cent, Asia 20 per cent and Europe 12 per <lb/>cent (See Table 1 of Appendix 1). <lb/>Of all regions Africa has lost out most over the period, as the growth in loans it has <lb/>received has been below the rate of growth in loans to emerging markets as a whole. As a result, <lb/>the percentage of flows to emerging markets received by Africa has fallen over time. There is a <lb/>certain noticeable asymmetry over time between Asia and Latin America regarding the receipt of <lb/>foreign loans. During periods when Latin America&apos;s share of financing has fallen, Asia&apos;s share <lb/>has grown, and when Latin America has begun to recover, it has been Asia that has lost out. <lb/>Emerging European countries have seen a steady increase in bank inflows, especially from 1996 <lb/>onwards. <lb/>Up until the fourth quarter of 2003, Latin America was the biggest recipient of bank flows <lb/>towards emerging economies. Since the beginning of 2004, Asia is the region receiving the <lb/>biggest share of funding to emerging economies (31.4 per cent of the total in Q1 2006). In 2006, <lb/>Emerging Europe was the second biggest destination for loans to emerging countries with <lb/>31.1 per cent of the total, followed by Latin America with 24.5 per cent, and Africa bringing up <lb/>the rear with only 13 per cent. <lb/></body>

In addition, these countries are the individual <lb/>emerging economies that have received the most finance over the past two decades, with flows <lb/>exceeding those directed at Asian emerging economies, although Asia and Emerging Europe as <lb/>regions have obtained more financing than Latin America. This is due to the greater <lb/>32. See for a detailed analysis of the determinants and impacts of this boom of foreign bank claims <lb/>Martínez-Pería, Powell and Vladkova-Hollar, 2005.

Mexico and Brazil <lb/>received similar amounts of financing until the second half of the 1990s when Brazil grew in <lb/>importance as a destination for loans, while Mexico decreased. But from 2000 onwards, Mexico <lb/>became the emerging country that received most loans, with 10.5 per cent of the total in 2005 (a <lb/>percentage of total loans similar to that received by Africa and the Middle East in the same year). <lb/>On the other hand, Brazil&apos;s importance for banking investment fell considerably after 2002, with <lb/>its share of total emerging bank flows falling from 10.5 per cent at the end of 2001 to a mere <lb/>6.9 per cent in 2006. <lb/>Other Latin American countries such as Argentina and Venezuela have experienced a <lb/>considerable drop in the amount of financing received from foreign banks.

			<body>© OECD 2007 <lb/>The US is the second major financer of emerging countries, being the second biggest in <lb/>Asia and Latin America and the fourth largest in Africa. Spain is the fourth biggest lender to <lb/>emerging economies, and is the leading one in Latin America, where it is even bigger than the <lb/>US. However, there are a number of differences between the two. While the US is a big financer <lb/>of emerging economies, it does not assign a high proportion of its total lending to these <lb/>economies. Spain, however, is a major financing country for emerging markets and assigns more <lb/>loans to these economies in relative terms. In addition, Spanish bank loans to emerging countries <lb/>are heavily concentrated in Latin America (95.6 per cent of the total of Spanish bank loans to <lb/>emerging markets) (for a comparison between US and Spanish international foreign claims and <lb/>their determinants see García-Herrero and Martínez-Pería, 2007). <lb/>Table 4: Main countries of origin of Foreign Claims on Emerging Countries in 2004 and 2006 <lb/>W orld <lb/>% of total* <lb/>Germany <lb/>16.4 <lb/>Germany <lb/>13.4 <lb/>U.K. <lb/>10.8 <lb/>U.K. <lb/>11.7 <lb/>Switzerland <lb/>10.3 <lb/>Switzerland <lb/>9.1 <lb/>France <lb/>9.0 <lb/>France <lb/>8.5 <lb/>Netherlands <lb/>7.9 <lb/>Netherlands <lb/>7.9 <lb/>Japan <lb/>7.4 <lb/>Japan <lb/>7.0 <lb/>Emerging Countries <lb/>U.S.A. <lb/>15.6 <lb/>U.K. <lb/>14.9 <lb/>Germany <lb/>14.4 <lb/>U.S.A. <lb/>13.7 <lb/>U.K. <lb/>10.5 <lb/>Germany <lb/>9.9 <lb/>Spain <lb/>10.0 <lb/>Spain <lb/>9.1 <lb/>France <lb/>9.1 <lb/>France <lb/>7.3 <lb/>Netherlands <lb/>6.4 <lb/>Netherlands <lb/>6.0 <lb/>Asia &amp; Pacific <lb/>U.K. <lb/>22.7 <lb/>U.S.A. <lb/>21.3 <lb/>U.S.A. <lb/>18.6 <lb/>U.K. <lb/>15.7 <lb/>Japan <lb/>9.7 <lb/>Japan <lb/>10.4 <lb/>Germany <lb/>7.7 <lb/>Germany <lb/>10.2 <lb/>Switzerland <lb/>7.0 <lb/>France <lb/>8.4 <lb/>France <lb/>6.3 <lb/>Netherlands <lb/>7.7 <lb/>Emerging Europe <lb/>Austria <lb/>28.2 <lb/>Germany <lb/>28.2 <lb/>Germany <lb/>15.8 <lb/>Italy <lb/>11.5 <lb/>Italy <lb/>8.4 <lb/>Belgium <lb/>9.9 <lb/>Belgium <lb/>7.8 <lb/>France <lb/>8.7 <lb/>France <lb/>7.4 <lb/>Netherlands <lb/>6.3 <lb/>Switzerland <lb/>5.9 <lb/>Austria <lb/>6.3 <lb/>Latin America &amp; Caribbean <lb/>Spain <lb/>35.5 <lb/>Spain <lb/>34.3 <lb/>U.S.A. <lb/>22.6 <lb/>U.S.A. <lb/>22.3 <lb/>U.K. <lb/>9.0 <lb/>U.K. <lb/>8.0 <lb/>Netherlands <lb/>8.3 <lb/>Germany <lb/>6.4 <lb/>Canada <lb/>5.1 <lb/>Netherlands <lb/>6.4 <lb/>Germany <lb/>4.3 <lb/>Canada <lb/>5.5 <lb/>Africa &amp; Middle East <lb/>France <lb/>23.7 <lb/>U.K. <lb/>34.9 <lb/>U.K. <lb/>17.3 <lb/>France <lb/>17.6 <lb/>Germany <lb/>14.9 <lb/>Germany <lb/>11.5 <lb/>U.S.A. <lb/>7.2 <lb/>U.S.A. <lb/>7.3 <lb/>Switzerland <lb/>5.3 <lb/>Switzerland <lb/>3.7 <lb/>Japan <lb/>3.8 <lb/>Japan <lb/>3.3 <lb/>* of total investment <lb/>% of total* <lb/>2004 <lb/>2006 <lb/>Foreign claims by country of origin <lb/>(share of total foreign claims by destination) <lb/>Source: Authors, 2007; based on BIS data, 2006 <lb/></body>

			<body>The main financers of the US are the banks of politically neutral Switzerland, granting <lb/>22.3 per cent of the total bank funds received. This amount ($857 billion), which is higher than <lb/>Spain&apos;s GDP, accounts for 48.8 per cent of Switzerland&apos;s total foreign claims. The US in turn is <lb/>the second financer of Asia, although by country it focuses its financing on those that are closest <lb/>to it. It is the main lender to almost all of Central America (Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala and <lb/>Honduras), in addition to several islands in the Caribbean (Haiti, Jamaica) and to neighbouring <lb/>Canada. Normally, it is the second or third biggest lender to the rest of the countries bordering or <lb/>geographically close to it (Mexico, Nicaragua, Trinidad and Tobago). US banks are the main <lb/>financers of only one South American country: Uruguay. (See Table 2 of Appendix 1). <lb/>The US directs 40.5 per cent of its total private bank emerging market loans towards Latin <lb/>American countries. This level is below the 42.4 per cent that it assigns to Asia, but it is above the <lb/>average of 28.9 per cent that it disburses to all the countries of the world. Its emerging market <lb/>loans are focused on Mexico, which receives 22.7 per cent of the total (See Table 3 of Appendix 1). <lb/>In terms of foreign claims, for example, US banks are also particularly active in Mexico with the <lb/>ratio of US claims to total foreign claims reaching 97 per cent in 2003. Cross-border claims by US <lb/>banks have also been replaced over the past years by claims from US banks, branches and <lb/>subsidiaries located in Latin American countries themselves (Goldberg, 2006). <lb/>Spain is the major financing country of ten of the thirty Latin American countries that <lb/>appear in BIS statistics. The most important recipients are Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, <lb/>Mexico, Paraguay, Peru and Venezuela. In addition, it is the second biggest lender to Cuba and <lb/>Uruguay. Together, the US and Spain are the leading private bankers of 17 of the 30 countries in <lb/>Latin America. <lb/>With regards to the remaining thirteen countries in Latin America, Panama&apos;s importance <lb/>as the main financer of Costa Rica and Nicaragua merits mention. France is the main lender to <lb/>Cuba and Switzerland is the main banker of Belize and St. Vincent, whilst Germany is the main <lb/>banker of Trinidad and Tobago and the Netherlands is the main lender to Suriname. The UK and <lb/>Italy are not the main financing countries of any country in Latin America despite being among <lb/>the leading financers of the region. <lb/>Spain, as has already been indicated, directs 95.6 per cent of its loans towards Latin <lb/>American emerging markets, as underlined by Table 5. It is the highest concentration of bank <lb/>flows in Latin America after Mexico and Panama, with 98.5 per cent and 99.8 per cent, <lb/>respectively. Spanish loans are heavily biased towards Mexico where it grants 48.25 per cent of <lb/>its total loans. <lb/>Banking on Development: Private Banks and Aid Donors in Developing Countries <lb/>DEV/DOC(2007)6 <lb/>26 <lb/>© OECD 2007 <lb/>Table 5: Main countries of origin of Foreign Claims on Emerging Countries in 2004 and 2006 <lb/>EM Countries* % of total <lb/>Greece <lb/>51.2 <lb/>Panama <lb/>43.3 <lb/>Austria <lb/>46.4 <lb/>Spain <lb/>39.1 <lb/>Panama <lb/>46.3 <lb/>Chile <lb/>36.6 <lb/>Chile <lb/>30.8 <lb/>Austria <lb/>32.9 <lb/>U.S.A. <lb/>28.9 <lb/>Greece <lb/>31.1 <lb/>World average <lb/>11.0 <lb/>World average <lb/>9.8 <lb/>Latin America &amp; Caribbean* <lb/>Panama <lb/>46.3 <lb/>Panama <lb/>43.3 <lb/>Spain <lb/>25.6 <lb/>Spain <lb/>37.9 <lb/>Chile <lb/>23.9 <lb/>Chile <lb/>34.9 <lb/>U.S.A. <lb/>11.7 <lb/>U.S.A. <lb/>10.9 <lb/>Canada <lb/>6.2 <lb/>Canada <lb/>7.1 <lb/>World average <lb/>2.7 <lb/>World average <lb/>2.8 <lb/>Asia &amp; Pacific** <lb/>Australia <lb/>86.2 <lb/>Australia <lb/>81.1 <lb/>Taiwan <lb/>70.1 <lb/>Japan <lb/>71.6 <lb/>Japan <lb/>69.3 <lb/>Taiwan <lb/>70.2 <lb/>Switzerland <lb/>51.4 <lb/>U.K. <lb/>48.9 <lb/>U.K. <lb/>47.6 <lb/>U.S.A. <lb/>44.9 <lb/>World average <lb/>31.4 <lb/>World average <lb/>32.8 <lb/>Emerging Europe** <lb/>Austria <lb/>92.7 <lb/>Sweden <lb/>87.3 <lb/>Greece <lb/>89.6 <lb/>Greece <lb/>83.7 <lb/>Sweden <lb/>88.2 <lb/>Ireland <lb/>80.1 <lb/>Italy <lb/>88.0 <lb/>Austria <lb/>79.1 <lb/>Finland <lb/>87.4 <lb/>Belgium <lb/>78.2 <lb/>World average <lb/>31.1 <lb/>World average <lb/>26.3 <lb/>Latin America &amp; Caribbean** <lb/>Panama <lb/>99.8 <lb/>Mexico <lb/>100.0 <lb/>Mexico <lb/>98.5 <lb/>Panama <lb/>99.9 <lb/>Spain <lb/>95.6 <lb/>Spain <lb/>96.8 <lb/>Brazil <lb/>83.6 <lb/>Chile <lb/>95.4 <lb/>Chile <lb/>77.5 <lb/>Brazil <lb/>90.8 <lb/>World average <lb/>24.5 <lb/>World average <lb/>28.2 <lb/>Africa &amp; Middle East** <lb/>Norway <lb/>39.2 <lb/>Portugal <lb/>51.9 <lb/>France <lb/>31.3 <lb/>Norway <lb/>39.2 <lb/>U.K. <lb/>30.4 <lb/>France <lb/>33.1 <lb/>Portugal <lb/>22.7 <lb/>Taiwan <lb/>22.6 <lb/>Germany <lb/>15.2 <lb/>U.K. <lb/>20.9 <lb/>World average <lb/>13.0 <lb/>World average <lb/>12.7 <lb/>* % of country of origin total <lb/>** % of country of origin total to emerging markets <lb/>% of total <lb/>2004 <lb/>2006 <lb/>Destinations for Foreign Claims <lb/>(share of country of origin total) <lb/>Source: Authors, 2007; based on BIS data, 2006 <lb/>OECD Development Centre Working Paper No. 263 <lb/>DEV/DOC(2007)6 <lb/>© OECD 2007 <lb/>27 <lb/>A common feature of all financing economies is that an important part of their financing <lb/>goes to economies that are geographically close, share the same language or are former colonies. <lb/>Spain lends mainly to Latin America (ex-colonies and the same language), and to Portugal and <lb/>Andorra (proximity). The US concentrates on nearby and bordering countries in Central <lb/>America, the Caribbean and Canada. The UK is the main lender to Ireland (proximity), Kenya, <lb/>Zimbabwe and India (ex-colonies), and Australia (language) among others. It is the main lender <lb/>to Africa and Asia, and the third to Latin America. In addition, it is almost the leading financer of <lb/>the member countries of the Commonwealth, being the main lender of 50 per cent of the nations <lb/>that make up the bloc. <lb/>Like Spain and the UK, the countries where France occupies the leading position reflect <lb/>its current international ties, derived to a large extent from its past history. In a similar fashion to <lb/>the Commonwealth, the Francophonie groups together its ex-colonies (and a few other countries). <lb/>It is significant that of the 41 countries where France is the leading lender no fewer than 28 are <lb/>members of this organisation (2004). France is the second biggest lender to Africa and the Middle <lb/>East, where it accounts for 17.6 per cent of the international financing received by these regions. <lb/>Similarly, Austria and Japan are the top lenders to many of the countries that are <lb/>geographically close to them. Austria is the leader in the European emerging countries (Eastern <lb/>Europe) and the UK in Africa and the Middle East and Asia and Pacific countries. Japan is the <lb/>lead lender of several countries in South and East Asia. Italian banks, because of the recent <lb/>takeovers of German and Austrian entities, are also becoming major players in European <lb/>emerging economies. An interesting exception is Germany, which is a major lender to Eastern <lb/>European countries but also ranks relatively high in terms of lending activity in Asia, Africa and <lb/>Latin America (on foreign direct investment activities by German banks, see Buch and Lipponer, <lb/>2007). <lb/></body>

			<body>V. SUSTAINABLE BANKING IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES <lb/>As banks have been increasing their exposure to developing countries, both through <lb/>lending activities and foreign direct acquisitions, so have issues of sustainable development <lb/>increasingly come to the fore. For international development banks, this concern has been at the <lb/>core of their activities for many years. It is, however, only more recently that private, both <lb/>commercial and investment, banks around the world are taking on board sustainable <lb/>development issues, particularly in their lending practices. <lb/>This in turn has led to a much greater awareness of social and environmental issues <lb/>among the companies asking for project finance. Broadly speaking, this has meant more concern <lb/>for protecting environmental goods such as water, air and soil, human rights and social issues. <lb/>Reputation considerations, amid mounting evidence that seeking sustainable lending makes <lb/>sound commercial sense, have been driving this increasing interest (for corporations operating in <lb/>developing countries, see Colonomos and Santiso, 2005). The activism of NGOs and also <lb/>important international actors such as the IFC, the subsidiary and private sector lending arm of <lb/>the World Bank, has played a leading role in increasing the profile of these issues. Activist <lb/>investors have also pressured banks to move away from reputational risks 33 . The growth of <lb/>socially responsible investment funds has also added pressure on banks to account for aspects <lb/>beyond standard financial variables. Bank Sarasin, a private Swiss bank, for example, set up a <lb/>sustainable division in the early 1990s that now manages €2 billion in funds dedicated to <lb/>sustainable investments, targeting banks amongst other corporations. Dexia Asset Management, <lb/>the fund manager arm of Dexia Group, also became increasingly active in the emerging segment <lb/>of socially responsible funds. <lb/>Yes Bank, which is 20 per cent owned by Rabobank of the Netherlands, actively evaluates <lb/>the social and environmental risks when considering lending operations. While it is a rare <lb/>exception in the Asian banking landscape, Yes Bank also points to a trend of sustainable banking <lb/>in developing countries. Following the trends of their Western peers, Asian banks are <lb/>increasingly making public statements underlining the sustainable development aspect of their <lb/>lending practices. Like their Japanese counterparts, such as Mizuho Corporate Bank, financial <lb/>institutions like South Korea&apos;s Kookmin Bank, Woori Bank and Export Import Bank are joining <lb/>initiatives like the United Nations Environmental Program Financial Initiative. <lb/>33. See for example, the study Developer by Foreign &amp; Colonial Asset Management, one of the major fund <lb/>managers in emerging markets, F&amp;C Asset Management, Banking on human rights: confronting human <lb/>rights in the financial sector, London, F&amp;C Asset Management, 2004. <lb/></body>

			<body>In India, private sector players are also actively involved in socially responsible <lb/>investments. Recently Dutch ABN Amro&apos;s Indian asset management arm opened its Sustainable <lb/>Development Fund, a three-year closed-end scheme. The fund will invest in companies that rank <lb/>high on a number of attributes, such as environment compliance and compliance to corporate <lb/>governance rules etc., indicating a high level of social responsibility. Ratings major, CRISIL, will <lb/>establish the ranking based on a set of parameters and review the list annually. Thereafter, ABN <lb/>Amro&apos;s fund team will carry out financial analysis of the companies that make the cut for final <lb/>investment decision. Globally those types of funds categorised as socially responsible investment <lb/>(SRI) held over $2.3 trillion in assets in 2006 in the US alone, according to the Social Investment <lb/>Forum 34 , which represented an increase of 260 per cent since 1995, and nearly €1 trillion in 2006 <lb/>in Europe, according to Eurosif 35 (for more analysis on SRI developments see Santiso, 2005). <lb/>ABN Amro manages about $2 billion in about 24 SRI funds. The interest for socially responsible <lb/>investments within and towards emerging markets is increasing as suggested by the boom of <lb/>studies dedicated to this asset class of investments (see, for example, Eiris, 2006). <lb/>Asset management arms, either of banks or specialised institutions, through their <lb/>increasing interest for socially responsible investments, are other potential partners for aid <lb/>donors and/or NGOs willing to boost their impacts in developing countries and on development <lb/>issues. The same applies for pension funds, particularly the public funds and those managing the <lb/>assets of employees working in administrations. In California, Calpers <lb/>36 , an active $230 billion <lb/>fund manager providing retirement and health benefits for 1.5 million public sector employees, <lb/>deployed over the past decades a remarkable socially responsible strategy, applied not only to <lb/>investments made in developed countries but also in developing countries since the years 2000s. <lb/>In Europe another public pension fund active in socially responsibility is the Dutch ABP <lb/>Investments, a firm with more than €200 billion of assets under management 37 . Other important <lb/>European public pension funds at the forefront of these issues are AP2 from Sweden or <lb/>Metallrente from Germany. In France the Fonds de Réserve des Retraites also adopted in 2005 <lb/>socially responsible investment strategies for part of its €31 billion of assets under management, <lb/>following Calpers&apos; pioneering strategy 38 . Early in 2007, the Spanish public pension system also <lb/>operated a move in the same direction, although limiting its socially responsible investment <lb/>screening to developed countries only. <lb/>Another promising area is private banking, with certain wealthy individuals now <lb/>pressuring their private bankers not only to provide ethical investment products but also advice <lb/>for investments with &quot; social performance &quot; (on private banking see UNEP Finance Initiative, <lb/>2007). Topics at the core of the development agenda, whether poverty reduction, water or climate <lb/>change, has also moved up the agenda of private bankers, investors or insurers (see for example <lb/>34. See http://www.socialinvest.org/areas/research/trends/sri_trends_report_2005.pdf. It represents nearly <lb/>9 per cent of the total of assets under management in the US investment funds industry. <lb/>35.

We have seen that some European Development <lb/>Finance Institutions (EDFI), such as UK based CDC or Dutch based FMO, have already <lb/>developed effective partnerships while others are planning to team up with other public or <lb/>private institutions. Recently former Secretary of State, Madeleine Albright, created an emerging <lb/>markets fund. In 2007, Albright Capital Management and PGGM have come together to create a <lb/>long-term, multi asset class emerging markets fund 39 . PGGM is a Dutch pension fund that serves <lb/>the healthcare and social work sectors, and will serve as Albright Capital&apos;s strategic investor with <lb/>$329 million. <lb/>This initiative follows those of other recent US officials, like Nicholas Brady, the former <lb/>US Treasury Secretary who helped to address the debt crisis of the 1980s by creating the Brady <lb/>Bonds markets for emerging countries in the 1990s. In 1994, after his public career and position <lb/>as Chairman of the investment bank Dillon Read &amp; Co, he established a private equity, fixed <lb/>income and mezzanine finance investment company, Darby Overseas, specialising in developing <lb/>country projects. Nearly ten years later, in October 2003, the company was acquired by Franklin <lb/>Templeton Investments, one of the largest global investment management organisations. The <lb/>company manages nearly $1 billion through different investment vehicles and partnerships <lb/>40 . <lb/>One year later, another US political senior official, Al Gore, also helped to create an investment <lb/>company (Generation Investment Management) dedicated to long-term sustainable investments, <lb/>with former employees of Goldman Sachs Asset Management and Sustainable Asset <lb/>Management. <lb/>In developing countries, former senior officials have also been playing an active role in <lb/>setting up private equity firms and investment companies. In Brazil, for example, Arminio Fraga, <lb/>a former Central Bank Governor, created one of the most successful investment firms, Gavea <lb/>Investimentos 41 , following the example of Gustavo Franco, also a former Central Bank Governor <lb/>who created Rio Bravo 42 , another investment firm. Some of the private equity firms have already <lb/>reached a critical size in terms of asset under management like, for example, GP Investments 43 . <lb/>Also interesting, Brazilian pension funds, like Previ and Petros among others, have been active in <lb/>the socially responsible investment area, and are supporters of poverty reduction programs like <lb/>the one led by Lula&apos;s government Fome Zero 44 . This is also the case of Brazilian private banks like <lb/>39. See http://www.albrightcapital.com/ <lb/>40. See http://www.darbyoverseas.com/ <lb/>41. See http://www.gaveainvest.com.br/ <lb/>42.

			<body>Unibanco, Itaú or Bradesco, who, along with public banks or development banks like BNDES 45 , <lb/>are involved in development finance projects all around the country <lb/>46 . In Mexico, Pedro Aspe, a <lb/>former Minister of Finance, also created a successful investment and consulting firm, Protego, <lb/>specialising in medium size companies 47 . <lb/>Probably one of the most successful institutions is Fundación Chile, a privately owned, <lb/>non profit institution created in 1976 by the Chilean government and the US multinational ITT <lb/>(in 2005 the mining company BHP Billiton also became a co-founding member and boosted the <lb/>endowment of the institution). This institution pursues innovation, with special emphasis on <lb/>areas like agribusiness, marine resources, forestry, fruit biotechnology, quality management, <lb/>food technologies, etc. The development of the salmon industry is among one of the successes of <lb/>the Foundation. When it targeted that area, salmon exports from Chile barely existed. Now Chile <lb/>is, along with Norway, one of the top exporters of salmon in the world. <lb/>Private equity and investment firms operating in developing countries are common. It is <lb/>not rare for them to be created by former public officials or former senior officials of leading <lb/>international organisations involved in development 48 . They provide another set of potential <lb/>partners for aid donors willing to catalyse private investment in niche markets where the usual <lb/>bankers and investment firms are not looking. In 2006, private equity firms operating in <lb/>developing countries raised a record of more than $33 billion in capital commitments, a more <lb/>than five-fold increase over the $6 billion raised in 2004 <lb/>49 . A firm like the Washington-based <lb/>Emerging Markets Partners, created in the mid-nineties by former World Bank officers, is one of <lb/>largest private equity firms investing in emerging markets with seven funds holding around <lb/>$6 billion in cumulative capital commitments and investment operations spanning the globe <lb/>from Korea to South Africa to Argentina 50 . In Africa, Emerging Capital Partners (ECP) has been <lb/>the first private equity group to raise more than $1 billion for investment in companies across the <lb/>continent 51 . Major hedge funds and investment companies like Amber Capital, a New York-<lb/>based firm, also created in 2007 private equity instruments to invest in developing countries like <lb/>45. See http://www.bndes.gov.br/ <lb/>46. Unibanco <lb/>developed, <lb/>for <lb/>example, <lb/>a <lb/>social <lb/>arm, <lb/>Instituto <lb/>Unibanco: <lb/>http://www.unibanco.com.br/int/qsn/index.asp. Most of the banks developed important social activities <lb/>(education, health, poverty reduction, etc.) through their foundations like Bradesco, Itaú, or Banco do <lb/>Brasil <lb/>for <lb/>example. <lb/>Se <lb/>http://www.fb.org.br/institucional <lb/>; <lb/>http://www.fundacaoitausocial.org.br/home/index.htm, ; http://www.fbb.org.br/ <lb/>47. See http://protego.com.mx/ <lb/>48. Interesting examples are EMP Global, a private equity firm investing in emerging markets created by <lb/>former World Bank senior officials, or Emerging Markets Management, an investment firm created by <lb/>Antoine van Agtmael, a former IFC senior official. In 2007, the firm is a leading investor in emerging <lb/>economies, with more than $21 billion under management. See http://www.empglobal.com/; and <lb/>http://www.emi-emm.com/ <lb/>49.

			<body>VI. CONCLUSIONS AND POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS <lb/>Throughout history bankers and lenders in particular have been depicted as greedy and <lb/>callous. In Dante&apos;s Divine Comedy usurers are consigned within the seventh circle of hell, <lb/>peopled with vengeful Shylocks. Today&apos;s bankers and money lenders seem to be working in a <lb/>very different world. Examples abound of the increasing interest in sustainable banking over the <lb/>past years (see for example on Africa AICC Centre for Sustainability Investing, 2004). As <lb/>documented in a related working paper (Javier Rodríguez and Javier Santiso, 2007), private <lb/>banks play a pivotal role in economic development and — more surprisingly — can also lend a <lb/>helping hand in democratic consolidation, with cross border private banking flows tending to <lb/>increase in the years following a democratic transition 54 . <lb/>As underlined in this paper, private banks are actively involved in developing countries, <lb/>both through their lending activities from headquarters, and now increasingly from emerging <lb/>countries themselves, since they have been heavily investing in their economies, generating <lb/>employment, introducing best practices and many other positive outputs. <lb/>Banks manage their own performance and sustainability but they are also in a position to <lb/>influence socio-economic and environmental performances in client organisations. Banks&apos; <lb/>lending activities also have an important impact (see Accountability — Institute of Social and <lb/>Ethical Accountability, 2004). This paper stresses a major challenge, going well beyond aid <lb/>coordination: the increasing proliferation of actors, directly or indirectly involved in <lb/>development issues in low or middle income countries. <lb/>In order to tackle this issue, a deeper dialogue is required between aid donors and these <lb/>private actors. Banks, private equity and asset management firms are part of a much broader set <lb/>of private actors ranging from foundations to corporations. Mapping and coordinating this &quot; non <lb/>54. For a review, based on good practices and case studies, of how financial services are affected by and <lb/>manage the challenges associated with human rights, see also the study of European asset manager <lb/>F&amp;C Asset Management and KPMG, Banking on Human Rights: Confronting Human Rights in the Financial <lb/>Sector, London, September 2004 and the F&amp;C (Isis Asset Management) reports available online: <lb/>http://www.isisam.com/aboutus.asp?pageid=2.8.3.7#banking. All in all, a total of 8 private banks <lb/>voluntarily developed internal human rights policies, standards, guidelines or statements: ABN <lb/>AMRO, Barclays, HBOS, ING, Rabobank, Société Générale, Standard Chartered and Westpac. <lb/>Signatories to the UN Global Compact also pledge to avoid complicity in human rights violations. As of <lb/>March 2007, the Global Compact website indicates that 323 banking and insurance institutions are <lb/>members. For a systematic mapping of human rights treaties and norms that could be applied to <lb/>corporations and enforced by States, see the United Nations commissioned report written by the United <lb/>Nations Secretary General&apos;s Special Representative on Human Rights &amp; Business John Ruggie, 2007. <lb/></body>

			<body>© OECD 2007 <lb/>system &quot; of development finance is as challenging as it is important for those seeking to improve <lb/>the lot of less-developed parts of the world (see Mavrotas and Reisen, 2007; and, on the <lb/>fragmentation of aid and private foreign investment, see Harms and Lutz, 2006). <lb/>Public aid donors who are willing to innovate in order to deepen impacts will find <lb/>interested counterparties and partners. As documented, some of these actors tend to operate by <lb/>specific region. UK and French banks, for example, would seem to be good potential partners for <lb/>aid donors in Africa while Spanish banks or US counterparts might be more relevant for Latin <lb/>America, and German, Swiss 55 and Italian banks for Eastern Europe. Beyond international banks, <lb/>local private banks in India, South Africa, Morocco and other developing countries are also <lb/>potential partners, these banks also being increasingly aware and sensitive to economic, social <lb/>and environmental impacts. <lb/>In areas like remittances or microfinance, for example, banks operating in both recipient <lb/>countries like Latin America, and also in the sending countries, such as US and Spanish banks <lb/>could have an important role to play in public and private partnerships. In North Africa, French <lb/>players, along with local banks are also key potential partners. In infrastructure finance, whether <lb/>water, health or transport, public aid donors could play a pivotal role as a catalyst for deeper <lb/>involvement by private bankers, equity firms or asset managers in these sectors in developing <lb/>countries. <lb/>The partnerships can obviously go well beyond solely the banking sector, as underlined <lb/>by the recent initiative of Danone, a French multinational, and the French banking group Crédit <lb/>Agricole, who, in 2007, jointly created a novel mutual to invest in microfinance projects in the <lb/>world&apos;s poorest countries. The first test will be in Bangladesh where Danone have already <lb/>created a joint venture with the Grameen Group of Nobel Prize winner Mohammad Yunus, who <lb/>has pioneered microfinance lending to the very poor 56 . Former executives are also creating <lb/>innovative ways to pull financing into microfinance institutions, like Pierre Omidyar, the eBay <lb/>founder, that created Omidyar Network <lb/>57 . <lb/>In the future, it could be interesting to repeat the current exercise and to map cross-border <lb/>banking operations, either trade finance, bank lending or investment flows, from emerging <lb/>countries to other developing economies. According to The World Bank, development finance is <lb/>experiencing a major transformation as emerging market based banks, companies and <lb/>governments are becoming global heavyweights in international development finance. In 1995, <lb/>low-income country borrowers received a mere 3 per cent of their cross-border syndicated <lb/>lending flows from other emerging market banks. Ten years later that figure jumped to 17 per <lb/>cent. In 2005, a record of 27 per cent of all foreign banks in developing countries were owned by <lb/>55. See for example in the field of remittances in the Balkans the analysis conducted by the Swiss State <lb/>Secretariat for Economic Affairs (SECO, 2007). <lb/>56. See http://www.grameen-info.org/. More generally, on alliances and partnerships between a public aid <lb/>donor agency and private partners, see US Aid initiatives labeled The Global Development Alliance: <lb/>http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/global_partnerships/gda/report2006.html <lb/>57.

			<body>banks from other emerging economies. These numbers are particularly important in low income <lb/>countries where 47 per cent of foreign banks in terms of numbers and 27 per cent in terms of <lb/>assets are owned by other foreign banks from developing countries (IMF, 2007). <lb/>With emerging countries becoming emerging donors, identifying banks operating <lb/>overseas could be a positive dialogue in which to engage, both with &quot; emerged &quot; donors and <lb/>international banks. International NGOs such as the Netherlands based BankTrack 58 , involved in <lb/>tracking sustainable bank lending, has already started to address the growing role of emerging <lb/>markets based banks, new power players in development finance. In this regard, more <lb/>systematic analysis could complete BIS efforts to track lending operations from major emerging <lb/>countries&apos; banks, particularly those based in countries like Brazil, South Africa, Russia, India and <lb/>China. <lb/>Another important issue, related to bank lending in developing countries, are related to <lb/>Basel II rules obliging foreign banks to use risk sensitive models to determine the amount of <lb/>capital to be allocated for different types of borrowers. Many studies have underlined the <lb/>potential negative impacts of such new rules on development finance, private bank lending from <lb/>OECD developed countries to developing countries and private bank lending within the <lb/>developing countries themselves. For these countries, Basel II can raise the costs of and reduce <lb/>access to external financing, inducing more expensive and rationed credit to borrowers perceived <lb/>as higher risk, such as low income countries or small and medium size enterprises. Importantly, <lb/>Basel II may also exacerbate fluctuations in the availability of external financing, an unfortunate <lb/>outcome, given that developing countries already suffer from volatile capital flows <lb/>59 . Stepping <lb/>up collaboration with private banks might be a way of alleviating the impact of these new <lb/>banking rules for asset allocation, in particular in the lower income countries. <lb/>It is also important to stress this issue regarding the increasing presence in developing <lb/>countries not only of OECD foreign banks but also of foreign banks from other developing <lb/>countries. According to one estimate, using a large dataset on banking sector foreign direct <lb/>investment in developing countries (Van Horen, 2007; and for the determinants of locations and <lb/>competitive advantages see Claessens and Van Horen, 2007), 27 per cent of all foreign banks in <lb/>developing countries are owned by a bank from another developing country. This presence is <lb/>particularly striking in low income countries: in sub-Saharan Africa it is above all South Asian <lb/>and other sub-Saharan African banks that are present. This is a potential segment of bank <lb/>lending and bank activity within a developing country that could be considered when aid donors <lb/>are looking for public private partnerships in development finance. <lb/>One might envisage the creation of a Prize in Development Finance that would reward <lb/>best practices of public and private partnerships in the field. The OECD Global Forum on <lb/>Development could host such a prize, as it intends to strengthen the dialogue between aid <lb/>donors and private actors working on development issues and investing in developing countries. <lb/>The objective of the OECD Development Finance Prize would be to underline already existing <lb/>58. See http://www.banktrack.org/ <lb/>59.
