Between 2003 and mid-2008 the employment rate increased by 5 percentage points to<lb/> around 69%. With labour force participation roughly constant throughout this period the rise in aggregate<lb/> employment was mainly reflected in a fall in the unemployment rate which came down from 6.7% in 2003<lb/> to 4.2% in mid-2008.

            <figDesc>Slovenia has had a statutory minimum wage (which covers all sectors of the economy) since<lb/> 1995, when the tripartite social agreement determined a cash figure for the lowest permissible monthly<lb/> wage. Whilst the tripartite agreement concluded in 1997 raised the minimum wage by roughly the same<lb/> amount as pay in general, the agreement for the period 1999-2001 stipulated an extra increase with the aim<lb/> of gradually bringing the minimum wage up to 58% of the average wage in the manufacturing sector. 15<lb/> During 1999-2004, the minimum wage was also adjusted in line with forecast consumer price inflation and<lb/> 15.<lb/> The law implementing the provisions of the social agreement for 1999-2001 introduced, for the first time, a<lb/> national minimum wage in the proper sense as the validity of the part of the law that regulates the<lb/> minimum wage was not limited, as previously, by the duration of the social agreement.

As a result it increased to around 46.5% of the average<lb/> wage in the private sector (54% of the average wage in the manufacturing sector) by 2004 (Figure 14,<lb/> panel A). Since 2006, the increase in the minimum wage has been decided by the government after<lb/> consulting the social partners, based on forecast consumer price inflation. Since inflation came out higher<lb/> than forecast in 2008 the legislation was amended to provide for an additional increase in the minimum<lb/> wage of about 5¼ per cent in March 2008. When setting annual increases in the minimum wage, mistakes<lb/> in forecasting inflation should not only be corrected when underestimated but also when overestimated.</figDesc>
