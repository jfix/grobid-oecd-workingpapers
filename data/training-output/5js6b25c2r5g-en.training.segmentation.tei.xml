			<body>5 <lb/>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY <lb/>Embracing green growth can secure strong, stable and sustainable development. Green growth recognises <lb/>and integrates the value of natural capital into economic decision-making and development planning, <lb/>which is critical to avoid natural capital depletion, the worst of climate change and social and national <lb/>security risks (OECD, 2013). This is particularly true for developing countries, because of their <lb/>dependence on natural assets and acute exposure and vulnerability to environmental risks, ranging from <lb/>air, water and soil pollution, as well as natural resource scarcity and extreme weather events exacerbated <lb/>by climate change. A green growth policy framework recognises and aims to address both micro-and <lb/>macro-level pressures that countries face to grow their economies, while also managing environmental <lb/>risks. In poorer developing countries, micro-level pressures may include lack of access to basic services <lb/>such as shelter, fuel, water; while macro-level pressures are threats to stable livelihoods due to <lb/>unemployment, poverty, social inequality, or resource scarcity or mismanagement. Leaders in developing <lb/>countries today face clear choices to guide development towards a new growth model (OECD, 2013). <lb/>These countries have the opportunity to move away from conventional growth strategies – the &quot; grow now, <lb/>clean up later &quot; model – towards a green growth model, with the aim to build resilient and fairer economies <lb/>around a vision of sustainable development. <lb/>An increasing number of developing countries have formulated and/or implemented innovative policies to <lb/>pursue green growth, notably in Africa (AfDB, 2013; AfDB and OECD, 2013; OECD, 2013, 2014a). <lb/>Zambia, in particular, is committed to drawing up an Inclusive Green Growth Strategy (IGGS) that builds <lb/>upon a nationally-defined and comprehensive definition of green growth (Government of Zambia, 2012). <lb/>A preliminary understanding already exists on what green growth means in Zambia, namely inclusive <lb/>development that makes sustainable and equitable use of the country&apos;s natural resources within ecological <lb/>limits (Banda and Bass, 2014). This effort can draw from a solid set of initiatives and institutions where <lb/>green considerations are already beginning to be mainstreamed. Key among these are Zambia&apos;s National <lb/>Long Term Vision and the Fifth and Sixth National Development Plans (2006-10 and 2011-15 <lb/>respectively), and subsequent implementation through green programmes, policies, and processes i.e. <lb/>targeting biodiversity, climate change adaptation, climate change mitigation, desertification, and other <lb/>environmental objectives. <lb/></body>

			<body>This paper illustrates the foundations of green growth in Zambia and provides an overview of bilateral <lb/>green development co-operation efforts in the country from 2004 to 2012. Zambia is considered a <lb/> &quot; frontrunner &quot; with respect to green planning and policy (Pauw, 2014; UN-HABITAT, 2014), yet most of <lb/>the funding for its green programmes and initiatives has come from providers of development co-operation <lb/>(Aongola et al., 2009; Government of Zambia, 2011a). Bilateral Official Development Assistance (ODA) <lb/>targeting green objectives reached up to 30% of total bilateral ODA to Zambia over 2010-12 (USD 218 <lb/>million) (OECD DAC CRS, 2014). 1 Importantly, the volume of green bilateral commitments increased <lb/>steadily since 2004-06 (albeit part of this increase resulted from better reporting of green ODA flows by <lb/>members of the OECD&apos;s Development Assistance Committee (DAC)), but this happened in the context of <lb/>falling ODA flows to Zambia – bilateral ODA fell from USD 1.7 billion in 2004-06 to USD 738 million in <lb/>2010-12. 2 This illustrates the important role of green ODA in Zambia. <lb/>Green ODA to Zambia targets many of the leading sectors of the economy, namely agriculture, energy, <lb/>transport, and water supply and sanitation, and these are identified as key by the country&apos;s vision and plans <lb/>for its development pathway (Government of Zambia, 2006a, 2006b, 2011a). This suggests that green <lb/>interventions are relatively aligned with the government of Zambia&apos;s plans and that providers use these to <lb/>inform the priority sectors and types of technical support provided (Co-operating Partners to the JASZ I, <lb/>2007 and Co-operating Partners to the JASZ II, 2011). The Joint Assistance Strategy to Zambia (JASZ) has <lb/>been a key mechanism to co-ordinate across development co-operation activities of different providers. <lb/>With respect to green interventions, the JASZ has avoided duplication of provider activities, and has <lb/>improved the information flow between providers and the government of Zambia (Ministry of Foreign <lb/>Affairs of Denmark, 2010). Working closely with the government, several Nordic countries, which rank <lb/>among the most active providers of green ODA in Zambia and lead under the JASZ on green matters, have <lb/>established strategic plans in co-operation with the government to implement activities that support <lb/>mainstreaming green objectives into many areas of government operations and policy (e.g. agriculture, <lb/>forestry, water supply and sanitation). <lb/>The JASZ has potential to be the main forum for providers to support the implementation of any <lb/>forthcoming agenda on green growth led by the government of Zambia. To do so, and to further increase <lb/>the effectiveness of development co-operation in the Zambian context, the JASZ could continue aligning <lb/>the interests of providers and those of Zambia (Mulenga, 2013) in three respects: <lb/>• First, the government of Zambia targets poverty reduction as its chief priority in both <lb/>development planning and in its future inclusive green economy strategy (Banda and Bass, <lb/>2014). However, few green international projects have explicitly targeted or achieved the <lb/>objective of poverty reduction (Banda, 2013). Although the main aim of ODA is, by definition, to <lb/>promote the economic development and welfare of developing countries, poverty reduction <lb/>remains an aspect of green ODA that could be bolstered.<lb/>1 <lb/>In this paper, bilateral ODA targeting green objectives refers to those activities targeting biodiversity, climate <lb/>change adaptation, climate change mitigation, desertification, and other environmental objectives. <lb/>2 <lb/>The DAC currently has 29 members: Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Czech Republic, Denmark, European <lb/>Union, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Korea, Luxembourg, The Netherlands, New <lb/>Zealand, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Slovak Republic, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom and <lb/>United States. This paper covers the activities of these providers, except from Czech Republic, Iceland, Poland, <lb/>Slovak Republic, and Slovenia, which joined in 2013. Korea joined the DAC in 2009. <lb/></body>

			<body>• Second, a number of key sectors for the Zambian economy and its development receive virtually <lb/>no green ODA or relatively small volumes of green ODA and could benefit from increased <lb/>attention. These include key economic sectors, such as mining, industry or tourism (Telfer and <lb/>Sharpley, 2008; World Bank, 2014), which face a host of environment-related risks and are <lb/>important in Zambia&apos;s economic development (Government of Zambia, 2011a). Similarly, green <lb/>issues could also be further mainstreaming into local-level institutions and planning processes, <lb/>including in urban areas, where no projects could be identified targeting this level of governance <lb/>over 2010-12.<lb/>• Finally, the Zambian government has identified the need for a climate financing framework (e.g., <lb/>developing an in-country regulatory framework, human and institutional capacity and fiduciary <lb/>standards) to tap into international financing mechanisms and to use these funds to leverage <lb/>private sector investment into climate change (Government of Zambia, 2012). There is also an <lb/>opportunity to mobilise and allocate domestic resources – public and private – to some of the <lb/>core government functions to protect and promote environmental performance. Provider support <lb/>in this area could help with the government&apos;s objective to ease dependency on ODA and lessen <lb/>the reliance on foreign ODA in the green sector; while reducing the vulnerability of the country.<lb/></body>

			<body>INTRODUCTION <lb/>The African region has a comparatively low ecological footprint today (Thornton et al., 2011). However, <lb/>Africa is particularly vulnerable to climate change, with most of its crops likely to be negatively affected <lb/>by rising temperatures and shifting precipitation patterns (IPCC, 2014). These global changes interact with <lb/>local environmental issues such as land degradation, the depletion of natural resources, air and water <lb/>pollution. Development, urbanisation and population growth are also putting pressure on local <lb/>environments and increasing the ecological footprint of the region, while underlining the urgency of <lb/>strengthening the resilience of livelihoods and sustainably managing essential natural resources and related <lb/>ecosystem goods and services. This is particularly important in Africa, where the poorest of the poor rely <lb/>disproportionately on natural resources to sustain their livelihoods (OECD, 2013; IPCC, 2014) and where <lb/>it is becoming increasingly important to put green measures in place to manage and reduce the risks <lb/>associated with climate change and unsustainable development pathways (AfDB, 2013). <lb/>An increasing number of African countries have formulated or are formulating green growth strategies and <lb/>policies (AfDB; 2013; AfDB and OECD, 2013; OECD, 2013). Embracing green growth can secure a <lb/>strong, stable and sustainable future for developing countries because green growth rests on recognising <lb/>and integrating the value of natural capital into economic decision-making and development planning <lb/>(OECD, 2013), thus helping to tackle pressing social issues (e.g. lack of access to basic services and <lb/>infrastructure, high vulnerability and threats to stable livelihoods from resource scarcity or <lb/>mismanagement). <lb/>Realising the benefits of green growth, the Zambian government aims to develop an Inclusive Green <lb/>Growth Strategy (IGGS) (Government of Zambia, 2012). Although an official, comprehensive definition is <lb/>still to be developed, a preliminary understanding already exists on what green growth means in the <lb/>Zambian context, and which refers to inclusive development that makes sustainable and equitable use of <lb/>Zambia&apos;s natural resources within ecological limits (Banda and Bass, 2014). Developing the IGGS could <lb/>build upon substantial experience with mainstreaming green considerations across sectors and levels of <lb/>government and pre-existing green institutions, processes and policies (Banda, 2013; Banda and Bass, <lb/>2014). These explain why Zambia is considered a &quot; frontrunner &quot; in the green planning and policy space in <lb/>Africa (Pauw, 2014; UN-HABITAT, 2014). Notwithstanding this, most of Zambia&apos;s green activities have <lb/>been largely supported by international providers of development co-operation (Watson et al. 2013). Their <lb/>experience in this sphere can therefore also help the Zambian government support the IGGS process, for <lb/>example through sharing lessons learned and good practice, including from related experience elsewhere. <lb/>This paper illustrates the foundations of green growth in Zambia and provides an overview of green <lb/>development co-operation efforts in the country from 2004 to 2012. Section 2 discusses on-going efforts <lb/>towards greening growth in Zambia. Section 3 looks at total bilateral green Official Development <lb/>Assistance (ODA) flows from members of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and <lb/>Development&apos;s (OECD) Development Assistance Committee (DAC) member countries, i.e. targeting <lb/>biodiversity, climate change adaptation, climate change mitigation, desertification, and other <lb/>environmental objectives. This analysis draws on OECD DAC statistics, in particular the Creditor <lb/></body>

			<body>Reporting System (CRS). 3 It describes the sectors targeted, as well as the instruments used, and discusses <lb/>the degree of alignment between Zambian priorities and providers&apos; activities. Section 4 then explores <lb/>specific provider co-ordination efforts and strategies to support the mainstreaming of green issues in-<lb/>country. The paper concludes with a number of questions that could guide further research on this topic in <lb/>Zambia and beyond. <lb/>TOWARDS GREEN GROWTH IN ZAMBIA <lb/>Zambia&apos;s gross domestic product (GDP) grew on average by 6.3% over 2004-13 (World Bank, 2014) <lb/>stimulated by economic reforms, infrastructure investments, a better educated population and the <lb/>development of natural resources (Murray McIntire, 2014). A number of environmentally sensitive sectors <lb/>are responsible for this growth, notably mining (copper, cobalt, lead), tourism, agriculture (maize) or <lb/>forestry (Aongola et al., 2009; Banda and Bass, 2014). The mining sector, in particular, contributed to over <lb/>a third of Zambia&apos;s GDP and 70% of its export value on average during that period (Government of <lb/>Zambia, 2011a). Agriculture, forestry and fishing contributed another 15% and provided for up to 80% of <lb/>all livelihoods (FAO, 2009; Government of Zambia, 2010b). According to the World Bank, environmental <lb/>assets amount to 27% of all assets available for Zambia&apos;s development (with other assets being financial, <lb/>infrastructure, social, and human in nature). Cropland and forests are particularly abundant in Zambia <lb/>(World Bank, 2006), yet this figure may actually be underestimated as the measurement of environmental <lb/>assets excludes the value of many ecosystem services (Aongola et al., 2009). <lb/>The benefits of growth have not been widely shared across different income groups in Zambia. Poverty <lb/>stood at 64% of the population in 2013 (down from 68% in 1996; Government of Zambia, 2012), and the <lb/>poor largely depend on rapidly shrinking or vulnerable environmental assets to sustain their incomes and <lb/>livelihoods (Government of Zambia, 2012). This is especially the case in rural areas, which account for <lb/>60% of the population. Population growth, rural flight, rapid urbanisation and a growing middle-class are <lb/>further straining an already fragile environmental balance (Aongola et al., 2009). As a result, Zambia <lb/>appears unlikely to meet the Millennium Development Goal (MDG) 7 to provide adequate clean water and <lb/>sanitation, to slow the rate of deforestation, and to protect biodiversity by 2015 (Government of Zambia, <lb/>2012). <lb/>In other words, Zambia&apos;s recent growth has been natural resource intensive, leading to problems of <lb/>environmental degradation and heightened climate change-related risks (see Box 1). However, growth has <lb/>not translated into rapid poverty and inequality reduction rates (World Bank, 2014). Zambia aims to <lb/>become a middle-income country by 2030 (Government of Zambia, 2006b) but achieving this goal will <lb/>require a long-term strategy to manage its green assets in a sustainable manner. <lb/></body>

			<note place="footnote">3 <lb/>ODA refers to flows of official financing administered with the promotion of the economic development and welfare of <lb/>developing countries as the main objective, and which are concessional in character with a grant element of at least 25%. By <lb/>convention, ODA flows comprise contributions of provider government agencies, at all levels, to developing countries (bilateral <lb/>ODA) and to multilateral institutions (OECD, 2014b). <lb/></note>

			<body>Realising the potential benefits of green growth, the Zambian government aims to develop an Inclusive <lb/>Green Growth Strategy (IGGS) (Government of Zambia, 2012). Although an official, comprehensive <lb/>definition is still to be developed, a preliminary understanding has already emerged on what green growth <lb/>means in the Zambian context. Namely, green growth refers to inclusive development that makes <lb/>sustainable and equitable use of Zambia&apos;s natural resources within ecological limits (Banda and Bass, <lb/>2014). More specifically, green growth is seen as a deliberate, progressive and incremental move away <lb/>from a carbon intensive economic model of growth to one compatible with sustainable development; it <lb/>aims to fulfil short-and medium-term needs, such as reducing unemployment, poverty and inequality, and <lb/>long-term needs, such as overcoming infrastructure deficits, connecting to markets worldwide and <lb/>supporting urban growth (Government of Zambia 2012; Banda and Bass, 2014). <lb/></body>

			<body>Box 4. Climate change and deforestation in Zambia <lb/>Climate change is expected to have important impacts in Zambia. By the end of the first decade of the 21st <lb/>century, mean temperatures are estimated to be 1.3 degrees C warmer and precipitation patterns 2.3% <lb/>rainfall lower per decade on average since the 1960s (McSweeney et al., 2008). Temperatures are <lb/>projected to increase by another 1.2 -3.4 degrees C and rainfall to decrease by a further 8-10% by 2060 <lb/>(Hertel et al., 2010; Dell et al., 2012). This is likely to modify the catchment areas of the major Zambezi <lb/>river watershed (with lower levels in dry seasons and higher in wet seasons); to increase evaporation in <lb/>deep lakes (e.g. levels in the lake Tanganyika are decreasing due to the combined effect of drought, <lb/>warming and human activities; IPCC, 2014); to change the climate of the Zambian highlands, but to reduce <lb/>annual runoff by 30-50% under a scenario of warming above 2.7 degrees C by 2060-80 (Dell et al., 2012; <lb/>IPCC, 2014). Extreme weather events are also predicted to increase in frequency. Floods, droughts and <lb/>heavy rainfall are already increasing in intensity and frequency (Fumpa-Makano, 2011). Lusaka and other <lb/>urban areas of Zambia are increasingly vulnerable to extreme weather events such as severe heat, heavy <lb/>rainfall and flooding due to the growth of informal settlements, reliance on urban agriculture to sustain the <lb/>livelihoods of the urban poor, and low levels of piped water, sewerage and electricity access (Heath et al., <lb/>2010). <lb/>As a result, climate change impacts are expected to alter the prospects for sustainable development in <lb/>Zambia. In particular, unmitigated climate change is expected to: <lb/>compromise agricultural and livestock-based livelihood security by lowering agricultural growth by 1% p.a. <lb/>(AfDB, 2013), <lb/>negatively impact water quality and availability as well as human health (e.g. increased incidence of <lb/>climate-sensitive diseases such as malaria, cholera and dysentery; FAO, 2009; IPCC, 2014), <lb/>put at risk vital infrastructure, including hydro-power generation and at urban level (UN-HABITAT, 2014), <lb/>harm biological diversity, forestry and agricultural productivity and increase price volatility (e.g. reduction in <lb/>fish stocks, soil erosion, decreased soil fertility; Government of Zambia, 2012). <lb/>Since 2003, Zambia has suffered losses in GDP estimated at USD 13.8 billion due to floods and droughts <lb/>and is it is expected to lose over USD 2 billion per year (amounting to 0.9% to 1.5% of its annual GDP <lb/>growth) due to climate change through 2020 (Government of Zambia, 2011a), while lower agricultural <lb/>productivity due to climate change will cost USD 4.3 billion in GDP over the next decade (AfDB, 2013). The <lb/>estimated loss of agricultural potential due to climate variability is USD 2.2 -3.1 billion of GDP per year <lb/>until 2020 (representing up to 2% of its annual GDP growth; Government of Zambia, 2011a). <lb/>In Zambia, forests provide edible products (e.g. caterpillars, mushrooms, honey), fuel in the form of <lb/>firewood or charcoal and health services through medicinal plants. However, charcoal markets and <lb/>agricultural needs are driving deforestation (IDLO and FAO, 2011). The rate of deforestation is estimated <lb/>to be the second highest per capita in Africa and the fifth highest in the world (estimated at 4,000 km2 of <lb/>forests lost every year from 1990 to 2005; see UNDP 2008), causing further land degradation and <lb/>desertification (Government of Zambia, 2006a, 2011a; Watson et al., 2013). <lb/>Source: AfDB, (2013) African Development Report 2012: Towards Green Growth in Africa, Tunis, African Development Bank; Dell, <lb/>M. et al., (2012) Temperature Shocks and Economic Growth: Evidence from the Last Half Century, American Economic Journal: <lb/>Macroeconomics 4(3): 66-95; FAO (2009), Conservation Agriculture Scaling Up for Increased Productivity and Production, Rome: <lb/>FAO; Fumpa-Makano, R.

			<body>A Zambian IGGS could build upon previous experience in mainstreaming green considerations (Banda, <lb/>2013; Banda and Bass, 2014), especially into the country&apos;s National Long Term Vision 2030 (NLTV; <lb/>Government of Zambia, 2006b) and the Fifth and Sixth National Development Plans (2007-11 and 2011-<lb/>15 respectively; Government of Zambia, 2006a, 2010b). Over time, green issues, understood here to <lb/>encompass biodiversity, climate change adaptation, climate change mitigation, desertification and local <lb/>environmental issues, have progressively gained more space in these documents (see Table 1). As the <lb/>implementation of these documents is meant to guide further decision-and policy-making, a number of <lb/>green institutions and processes have been established to help with the mainstreaming process and have <lb/>supported the implementation of several programmes and policies at the national and local levels (Banda <lb/>and Bass, 2014; see Annex 1 for an overview). These developments are likely to inform the formulation of <lb/>a Zambian IGGS in the future. <lb/>Table 1.

			<body>In light of these strategies and plans, Zambia is considered a &quot; frontrunner &quot; with respect to green planning <lb/>and policy-making in Africa (Pauw, 2014; UN-HABITAT, 2014), displaying strong political will to <lb/>engage on green issues (Watson et al., 2013) and relatively high levels of awareness among decision <lb/>makers and the general public on these issues (Aongola et al., 2009). Looking forward, it is expected that <lb/>the Seventh NDP (2016-20) will serve as a framework for a Zambian IGGS once it is developed, bringing <lb/>more coherence and capacity to manage green issues at national and local levels (Banda and Bass, 2014). <lb/>To date, most of Zambia&apos;s environmental projects and programmes have been largely supported by the <lb/>international development co-operation community (Watson et al., 2013). It is widely understood that <lb/>providers of development assistance can help developing countries transition towards green growth (AfDB <lb/>and OECD, 2013; OECD, 2013). They can offer finance, help transfer knowledge, build capacity and <lb/>promote learning, open markets for green goods and services, as well as support reforms in legal <lb/>frameworks and collective action agreements to create a basis for new green activities at sectoral, local <lb/>and/or national level (Aongola et al., 2009; OECD, 2013). A Zambian IGGS could therefore also build <lb/>upon the support of providers of development co-operation and their experience in this space. <lb/>Zambian priorities and the increasing number of green activities have also provided a framework for <lb/>development co-operation providers to act in this area. In particular, alignment between providers&apos; <lb/>activities and Zambian priorities has been facilitated by the on-going work of the Joint Assistance Strategy <lb/>for Zambia (JASZ). The JASZ was created to co-ordinate the activities of providers in Zambia <lb/>(Government of Zambia, 2006a), and constitutes a response to the Paris Declaration on ODA Effectiveness <lb/>and its five principles (OECD, 2005) and the Accra Agenda of Action (OECD, 2008; see Box 2). <lb/></body>

			<page>15 <lb/></page>

			<body>Box 5. International principles on aid effectiveness and effective development co-operation <lb/>The Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness (OECD, 2005) outlines five fundamental principles for <lb/>making ODA more effective, born out of decades of experience of what works and what does not work <lb/>for development: <lb/>•  Ownership: Developing countries set their own strategies for poverty reduction, improve their<lb/>institutions and tackle corruption. <lb/>•  Alignment: Development co-operation providers align behind these objectives and use local<lb/>systems. <lb/>•  Harmonisation: Providers co-ordinate, simplify procedures and share information to avoid<lb/>duplication. <lb/>•  Results: Developing countries and providers shift focus to development results and results get<lb/>measured. <lb/>•  Mutual accountability: Providers and developing countries are accountable for results.<lb/>These principles are further elaborated by the Busan Declaration, which fleshed out some of these <lb/>to form the foundation of effective development co-operation, namely: <lb/>•  Ownership of development priorities by developing countries: Partnerships for<lb/>development can only succeed if they are led by developing countries, implementing <lb/>approaches that are tailored to country-specific situations and needs. <lb/>•  Focus on results: Investments and efforts must have a lasting impact on eradicating poverty<lb/>and reducing inequality, on sustainable development, and on enhancing developing countries&apos; <lb/>capacities, aligned with the priorities and policies set out by developing countries themselves. <lb/>•  Inclusive development partnerships: Openness, trust, and mutual respect and learning lie<lb/>at the core of effective partnerships in support of development goals, recognising the different <lb/>and complementary roles of all actors. <lb/>•  Transparency and accountability to each other: Mutual accountability and accountability to<lb/>the intended beneficiaries of co-operation efforts, as well as to respective citizens, <lb/>organisations, constituents and shareholders, is critical to delivering results. Transparent <lb/>practices form the basis for enhanced accountability. <lb/>All members of the OECD DAC have endorsed these principles, which are applicable to all <lb/>development co-operation activities. Implementation of these principles and commitments to integrate <lb/>them into development co-operation activities of DAC members is well under way and the OECD has <lb/>been monitoring progress since 2006 (OECD, 2011). <lb/>Source: OECD (2005), Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness, Paris: OECD; OECD (2011), Aid Effectiveness 2011: Progress <lb/>in Implementing the Paris Declaration, Paris: OECD. <lb/></body>

			<body>GENERAL TRENDS IN GREEN ODA IN ZAMBIA <lb/>Trends in total external development finance to Zambia <lb/>Zambia was classified as a Least Developed Country (LDC) in 1991. 4 It reached Lower Middle-Income <lb/>Country (LMIC) status in 2011 due to reductions in poverty and sustained growth (OECD, 2011a). 5 <lb/>Political stability and strong growth have improved investor confidence, as evidenced in the issue of two <lb/>oversubscribed Euro bonds raising USD 750 million (Watson et al., 2013), or the increase in Foreign <lb/>Direct Investment from USD 164 million in 2003 to USD 1.7 billion in 2010 (World Bank, 2012). In light <lb/>of this, Zambia is increasingly less reliant on ODA: total ODA as a percentage of Gross National Income <lb/>(GNI) steadily declined from 29% in 2004-06 to 11% in 2010-12 (Chart 1), in line with a general <lb/>downward trend of ODA to Sub-Saharan Africa in recent years (OECD, 2014c). <lb/>Chart 1.

			<body>Since 2004, total bilateral and multilateral ODA flows committed to Zambia have fallen from USD 1.9 <lb/>billion in 2004-06 to USD 1.1 billion in 2010-12 (Chart 1). 6 Bilateral ODA provided by DAC member <lb/>countries, including the European Union (EU) institutions, has generally been the largest source, <lb/>representing 68% of total ODA to Zambia over 2010-12 (USD 730 million), falling from USD 1.6 billion <lb/>in 2004-06 and 85% of total ODA commitments to Zambia. Multilateral commitments, in turn, reached <lb/>USD 350 million over 2010-12, growing by 16% compared to 2004-06. 7 <lb/>Total bilateral and multilateral ODA commitments to Zambia over 2010-12 primarily targeted the <lb/>following sectors: health and population (30.2%), transport and storage (13.2%), agriculture (10%), <lb/>government and civil society (7.4%), water supply and sanitation (5.2%) and education (5%); with 8.8% of <lb/>total commitments providing general budget support. Looking at bilateral and multilateral commitments, 6 <lb/>of the top 10 providers over 2010-12 were bilateral providers of development co-operation (Table 2). <lb/>6 <lb/>Commitments are firm obligations, expressed in writing and backed by the necessary funds, undertaken by an <lb/>official donor to provide specified assistance to a recipient country or a multilateral organisation (OECD, <lb/>2014b). <lb/>7 <lb/>The DAC CRS also recorded flows from Kuwait (USD 14.5 million) and the United Arab Emirates (USD 0.4 <lb/>million) to Zambia in 2010. <lb/></body>

Environmental protection, pollution control, environmental and climate change <lb/>mainstreaming represented only 3% of the national budget in 2011 (Government of Zambia, 2011b). By <lb/>contrast, governmental allocation to climate change adaptation and mitigation in the national budget was <lb/>on average 7% of total resources over 2008-2012 (Mulenga, 2013). With the Sixth National Development <lb/>Plan (SNDP), the government planned to increase its green funding by 33% for the 2011-15 period <lb/>compared to 2006-10 (Government of Zambia, 2011b). However, this would still leave green investments <lb/>heavily dependent on external support from providers of development co-operation (Government of <lb/>Zambia, 2006a, 2008; Mulenga, 2013). <lb/>Total green bilateral ODA committed by the members of the OECD DAC reached 30% of total ODA <lb/>commitments to the country over 2010-12 (USD 230 million), up from 6% of total bilateral ODA <lb/>commitments over 2004-06 (USD 90 million; Chart 2), increasing at a time when total ODA volumes were <lb/>8 <lb/>This paper only provides a partial picture of total green ODA flows to Zambia, based on the activities of bilateral <lb/>providers of development co-operation. An integrated, full picture including multilateral providers is still missing at <lb/>the time of writing. <lb/>9 <lb/>Total bilateral green ODA commitments are calculated using the OECD DAC CRS as being the total ODA <lb/>commitments marked as principal or significant with the environment marker, plus additional ODA to climate change <lb/>adaptation marked principal or significant, additional ODA to climate change mitigation marked principal or <lb/>significant, additional ODA to biodiversity marked principal or significant, and additional ODA to desertification <lb/>marked principal or significant. Care has been taken to aggregate these figures to ensure there is no double counting <lb/>where activities target multiple environmental objectives.

			<body>falling (Chart 1). These green flows include ODA targeting local environment objectives, as well as global <lb/>objectives enshrined in the three Rio Conventions (biodiversity, climate change and desertification). 10 <lb/>Chart 2. Trends in total green ODA to Zambia <lb/>2004-2012, bilateral commitments, USD million, constant 2012 prices, 3-year annual averages <lb/>Source: OECD DAC CRS, September 2014. Note: The adaptation marker was introduced in 2010 so reported figures over 2004-09 <lb/>may appear lower than in practice, and may reflect a break in the series given pre-2010 adaptation spend was not monitored; <lb/>Activities are classified as either having principal or significant green objectives (see Annex 1 for further <lb/>information on the Rio Markers methodology). On the one hand, principal activities are activities where <lb/>green issues are central and where the activity would not have gone ahead without having a green <lb/>dimension. The amount of ODA having green principal objectives is relatively low in Zambia, with <lb/>volumes varying over 2004-2012, and reaching USD 26 million over 2010-12 (see Chart 2). On the other <lb/>hand, activities that providers score as significant have other prime objectives but have been formulated or <lb/>adjusted to help meet green concerns, and failure to take this dimension into account would have not <lb/>prevented the activity from going ahead. In Zambia, the majority of green ODA is marked as having a <lb/>significant objective, accounting for 88% of all green ODA committed to the country over 2010-12 (USD <lb/>192 million), up from 2004-06 when it represented 77% of total ODA (USD 75 million). This suggests <lb/>high levels of mainstreaming of green concerns across the portfolios of development co-operation <lb/>providers. <lb/>10 <lb/>OECD DAC members did not monitor all their green development finance during 2004-09, e.g. monitoring climate <lb/>change mitigation only became mandatory in 2006, and climate change adaptation was only monitored after 2010. As <lb/>a result, part of the increase observed in Zambia also reflects improvements in the statistical coverage of green <lb/>development finance. <lb/></body>

Total ODA supporting environmental and Rio Convention objectives in Zambia <lb/>2004-12, bilateral commitments, USD million, constant 2012 prices, 3-year annual averages <lb/>Source: OECD DAC CRS, September 2014. Note: The ODA commitments to biodiversity, climate, desertification and local <lb/>environmental objectives displayed in this chart cannot be aggregated, as activities may target multiple objectives. Aggregated <lb/>figures, taking into account any overlaps between finance targeting multiple objectives have been taken into account for the <lb/>preparation of Chart 2. For further information on the methodology employed to avoid double counting, see Annex 1. <lb/>Looking at the components of green bilateral ODA commitments shows that the increase since 2004-06 <lb/>has been primarily driven by climate-related ODA (Chart 3). Climate change adaptation represented 14% <lb/>of total climate-related ODA in 2010-12, reaching USD 46 million per year on average, while climate <lb/>change mitigation-related ODA accounted for 0.4% or USD 1.5 million over 2010-12 on average per year. <lb/>The remainder, or over 85% or USD 272 million per year on average targeted both climate change <lb/>adaptation and mitigation. During the same period, too, biodiversity-and desertification-related ODA <lb/>halved in volume to USD 19 million and USD 10 million respectively. Providers are also seeking synergies <lb/>within and across their green portfolios (Chart 4). An estimated USD 10 million or 7% of environment-<lb/>related ODA also targets all other green objectives; USD 17 million or 13% of environment-related ODA <lb/>also targets climate change mitigation and adaptation objectives; and all of the biodiversity and <lb/>desertification-related ODA, and virtually all of the adaptation-related ODA targets at least one other green <lb/>objective. That being said, 70% of total green ODA still targets climate change mitigation alone (USD 54 <lb/>million); and 44% of environment-related ODA targets local environmental objectives only (USD 58 <lb/>million). <lb/></body>

			<body>Chart 4. Overlaps between OECD DAC members&apos; ODA green activities <lb/>Annual average, 2010-12, USD million, constant 2012 prices <lb/>Source: OECD DAC CRS, September 2014. <lb/>It is noteworthy that the climate-related development finance figures presented here may not be <lb/>comparable to those reported by Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change <lb/>(UNFCC) in their National Communications, Biennial Reports, or Biennial Update Reports. Reporting to <lb/>the UNFCCC is often based on, but may not be directly comparable to the OECD DAC Rio marker data <lb/>presented here as different methodologies are applied, in particular to account only for a certain share of <lb/>finance targeting climate change marked as a significant objective (Ockenden and Gaveau, 2014 <lb/>forthcoming). During 2008-12 (covering the 2010-12 period of Fast-start Finance period), climate <lb/>financing to Zambia amounted to USD 24 million, or USD 8 million on average per year. (Mulenga, 2013). <lb/>This has been primarily provided through grants originating from Germany&apos;s International Climate <lb/>Initiative, the Global Environmental Facility-Administered Trust Fund and the United Nations <lb/>Collaborative Programme on Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (UN <lb/>REDD+), aimed at climate change mitigation. In addition, a grant from Japan&apos;s Fast Start Finance focused <lb/>on climate change adaptation. The Climate Investment Funds (CFIs), in particular, have also been a key <lb/>international driver for the increase in climate change adaptation finance to Zambia, as the country was <lb/>included in its Pilot Program for Climate Resilience (PPCR; Box 3). <lb/></body>

			<page>22 <lb/></page>

			<body>Box 6. The Pilot Program for Climate Resilience in Zambia <lb/>The Pilot Program for Climate Resilience (PPCR) is funded by the Strategic Climate Fund, one of <lb/>the two Climate Investment Funds (CIFs). It is designed to demonstrate ways that developing countries <lb/>can make climate risk and resilience part of their core development planning. It helps countries build on <lb/>their National Adaptation Programs of Action and helps fund public and private sector investments <lb/>identified in climate resilient development plans. <lb/>In Zambia, the African Development Bank (AfDB) worked closely with the government and other <lb/>partners to develop a PPCR investment strategy in line with national development priorities, including <lb/>strengthening early warning weather systems, integrating climate resilience in infrastructure planning <lb/>and investments, and strengthening the adaptive capacity and livelihood of farmers and natural <lb/>ecosystems in the most affected areas of southern and western Zambia. <lb/>To date, Zambia has received a PPCR programme development grant of USD 1.5 million to <lb/>support preparation of its PPCR investment strategy, the Strategic Programme on Climate Resilience. <lb/>The AfDB is supporting this phase by providing input on mainstreaming climate resilience into national <lb/>development planning; strengthening institutional co-ordination, improving information for decision-<lb/>makers; and shaping targeted awareness and communication. This provided individual ministries the <lb/>mandate to work on climate change issues, because budget allocations were linked to the strategy; has <lb/>also strengthened country ownership and effectiveness by promoting institutional reforms on adaptation <lb/>planning; and succeeded to change and improve the political economy context through concessional <lb/>finance (Climate Investment Funds, 2014). Finally, this has also translated into three concrete <lb/>interventions covering a range of sectors, e.g. two projects on building resilience in land-based <lb/>livelihoods and infrastructure in two river sub-basins and a project on private sector support for climate <lb/>resilience in those same sub-basins. <lb/>Source: Climate Investment Funds (2014), Learning by Doing: The CIFs Contribution to Climate Finance; and CIFs website: <lb/>www.climateinvestmentfunds.org (accessed December 2014). <lb/>Sectors targeted by green ODA in Zambia <lb/>This section details the sectors that DAC member countries are targeting with their green ODA. This <lb/>analysis can be used to inform and assess the extent of alignment between the sectors prioritised by the <lb/>government of Zambia and those targeted by providers&apos; interventions. The issue of alignment has been <lb/>scantly studied in the case of green ODA (but see Thornston et al., 2011 who look at climate finance in <lb/>various African countries; Terpstra et al., 2013 who explore national adaptation priorities and international <lb/>adaptation finance flows in Zambia and other developing countries; or Drutschinin and Casado-Asensio, <lb/>forthcoming, who study biodiversity-related development co-operation in Zambia and other developing <lb/>countries). Alignment implies that providers base their support on partner countries&apos; national development <lb/>strategies, institutions and processes (see Box 2). For example, providers aim to increasingly use country <lb/>systems for programmes managed by the public sector. In return, partner countries improve the quality and <lb/>transparency of their public financial management systems. A lack of alignment leads to unsustainable <lb/>outcomes, as well as undermining national institutions and processes; while alignment reflects efforts to <lb/>build the institutional strength of partner countries (Birdsall and Kharas, 2014). By supporting this <lb/>dimension, providers signal their willingness to make a long-term investment in partners&apos; ability to develop <lb/>and implement their own strategies. <lb/>In the case of Zambia, there is alignment between the sectors targeted by providers and with those <lb/>highlighted by the Zambian government in the FNDP and SNDP. Inter alia, the FNDP (2006-10) <lb/>highlighted agriculture, while the SNDP (2011-15) also highlighted energy, fisheries, livestock, tourism, <lb/>transport and the water sectors (see Table 1). Providers have been consistently prioritising agriculture, <lb/></body>

			<page>23 <lb/></page>

			<body>forestry, fishing and rural development over 2010-12 (22% of all green ODA to Zambia, or USD 39 <lb/>million on average per year over that period, primarily driven by agriculture). Following this, are the <lb/>sectors of water supply and sanitation and energy (each accounting for 19%, or USD 35 million), transport <lb/>and storage (7%, or USD 14 million), general environmental protection (4%, or USD 7 million), other <lb/>social infrastructure and services (4%, or USD 6 million) and trade and tourism (3% or USD 6 million; see <lb/>Chart 5). <lb/>Chart 5. Total green-related ODA by sector <lb/>2010-2012, bilateral commitments <lb/>Source: OECD DAC CRS, September 2014. Note: 1) General budget support interventions are not targeted at a specific sector. In <lb/>principle, the Rio marker methodology cannot be applied to this &quot; sector &quot; , hence the data presented is only partial; 2) General <lb/>Environmental Protection includes support to environmental research, education, policy and administration management; 3) The <lb/>Other Social Infrastructure and Services category comprises social and welfare services, employment policy and administrative <lb/>management, housing policy and administrative management, low-cost housing, and multi-sector ODA for basic social services. <lb/>Priorities for allocating green ODA can also be assessed based on the extent to which environmental <lb/>considerations have been integrated into development co-operation support. Total sector support between <lb/>2004 and 2012 shows that environmental considerations are well integrated into ODA supporting a number <lb/>of key sectors for Zambia&apos;s development -based on the share of total ODA to each sectors that targets a <lb/>green objectives (Chart 6) -such as forestry (99%), energy (95%), water supply and sanitation (67%), <lb/>tourism (61%) or agriculture (54%). For example: <lb/>• Agriculture is a key sector in Zambia. It was declared the &quot; engine of income expansion in the <lb/>economy &quot; by both the FNDP and SNDP (Government of Zambia, 2006a, 2010a), yet is also seen <lb/>as being particularly vulnerable to climate change. The draft National Climate Change Response <lb/>Strategy (Government of Zambia, 2010b) and the Strategic Programme on Climate Resilience <lb/>(Climate Investment Funds, 2011), were in fact developed to implement the NDPs and to <lb/>prioritise agriculture (see Watson et al., 2012; UN-HABITAT, 2014).<lb/>• Green support to the forestry sector predominantly comes from Finland to build government <lb/>capacity to value, map and sustainably manage the country&apos;s forests (Leventon, et al., 2014). This <lb/>is aligned with the government&apos;s Zambia Forestry Action Plan and National Forest Policy of <lb/>1998 aiming to achieve Joint Forest Management in Zambia.<lb/></body>

			<page>24 <lb/></page>

			<body>• The high share of green ODA in the energy sector can be attributed to the expansion of energy <lb/>access from hydro-power (Zambia is a water rich-country, accounting for 40% of the water <lb/>resources of Southern Africa; UN-HABITAT, 2014), and to the government&apos;s intentions to <lb/>continue expanding hydro-power and biofuel plants during the SNDP period (Government of <lb/>Zambia, 2010a) and to climate-proof existing infrastructure (e.g. so that droughts do not impact <lb/>negatively on energy generation which in turn affects industrial production).<lb/>• ODA to water supply and sanitation, but also to the transport and storage sector, have a green <lb/>dimension in Zambia because providers have focused on climate-proofing existing infrastructure, <lb/>as prioritised by the government&apos;s SNDP (Government of Zambia, 2010a). For example, <lb/>transport interventions comprise three environmental assessments funded by the United States, <lb/>plus other activities focusing on road construction and rehabilitation funded by Denmark and <lb/>Japan to ensure that the increased frequency and severity of floods does not destroy roads as has <lb/>happened in the past.<lb/>Chart 6. Percentage of ODA targeting green objectives by sector <lb/>2010-12, bilateral commitments <lb/>Source: OECD DAC CRS, September 2014 <lb/></body>

			<page>25 <lb/></page>

			<body>Providers&apos; activities also coincide with respect to the emphasis placed upon capacity-building. Indeed, <lb/>many small-volume activities also focus on the General Environmental Protection sector, 11 which is <lb/>identified as the centrepiece to develop the FNDP, SNDP and the IGGS (Banda and Bass, 2014). In fact, <lb/>19% of all green ODA to Zambia over 2010-12 had capacity-building as its objective. 12 Three notable <lb/>activities in this sector are: <lb/>• A programme funded by the United Kingdom&apos;s Department for International Development <lb/>(DfID) to integrate climate resilience into development planning, and to provide support to <lb/>priority public and private climate-proofed investments. This programme ran over 2009-12 and <lb/>targeted climate change mitigation and biodiversity as principal objectives. The programme <lb/>included contracting a consultant to identify links between climate change and development, and <lb/>to suggest appropriate policies.<lb/>• A programme led by the Finnish Environmental Institute to support institutional capacity <lb/>building in the then Ministry of Tourism, Environment and Natural Resources (MTENR). The <lb/>programme was implemented during 2009-12 and comprised five mutually defined components: <lb/>improving human resource management (including training on environmental monitoring), <lb/>environmental information management, strategic environmental assessment, biodiversity and the <lb/>implementation of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna <lb/>and Flora and the Basel, Stockholm, and Rotterdam Conventions.<lb/>• Finally, in 2010, the United States Department of Agriculture provided support to reduce <lb/>pollution across multiple sectors. The initiative set out to improve environmental sustainability. <lb/>By reducing environmental risks, the programme aimed to reduce health costs and ecosystem <lb/>loss.<lb/>Notwithstanding the observed sectoral alignment and the emphasis placed to develop domestic-level <lb/>capacity, there are also a number of gaps, for example: <lb/>• Mining, which has a high impact on Zambia&apos;s economy and environment (Aongola et al., 2009). <lb/>Zambia&apos;s mining sector is specialised on the extraction of copper and cobalt. Mining activity <lb/>consumes substantial volumes of electricity (Kivyiro and Arminen, 2014), primarily relying on <lb/>hydro-power in Zambia and making the sector vulnerable to water scarcity and climate change. <lb/>Despite recent signs of a green transformation in this sector (AfDB and OECD, 2013) and the <lb/>fact that mining sites have to perform environmental impact assessments (Government of <lb/>Zambia, 2011a), change is slow and enforcement of environmental legislation poor (Leventon et <lb/>al., 2014); and the sector struggles to manage waste (AfDB and OECD, 2013).<lb/>• Tourism has the potential to be an effective means for achieving economic and social <lb/>development in destination areas, notably through community-based eco-tourism (Lachlan and <lb/>Binns, 2014). Although the data show that over 2010-12, 61% of all interventions had a green <lb/>objective, the volume devoted to the sector was small (under USD 100,000 over 2010-12), owing<lb/></body>

No <lb/>green intervention had been recorded in this sector previously, despite being mentioned already <lb/>in the FNDP; and the fact that tourism may help Zambia diversify its economy and decouple its <lb/>development from fluctuations in the world price of copper and other raw materials. <lb/>• Urban development, according to a recent review of DAC CRS data looking for interventions <lb/>targeting climate change adaptation at urban level for the years 2010-12, no explicit projects <lb/>could be identified on the matter in Lusaka, Ndola or Kitwe, despite high levels of vulnerability <lb/>and the prioritisation of interventions at this level by the government (UN-HABITAT, 2014). 13<lb/>Instruments used for green ODA <lb/>The majority of green ODA over 2004-12 (87%) is committed through grants (Chart 7). While ODA to <lb/>biodiversity, climate change adaptation, and desertification only takes the form of grants (see e.g. Teprstra <lb/>et al. 2013), 40% of the ODA targeting climate change mitigation takes the form of concessional loans. <lb/>This is in line with Zambia&apos;s Aid Policy and Strategy, which states that &quot; although it is the policy of the <lb/>country to progressively reduce its dependence on external assistance, the government shall give <lb/>preference to grants as opposed to loans &quot; (Government of Zambia, 2005). The government also targets <lb/>concessional finance and loans with a minimum 35% grant element (Government of Zambia, 2005). <lb/>Chart 7. Green-related ODA by instrument <lb/>2004-12, bilateral commitments <lb/>Source: OECD DAC CRS, September 2014 <lb/>The majority of green bilateral ODA consists of project-type interventions (57%). Green ODA is also <lb/>channelled through general budget support. Data collected within the OECD DAC CRS is only partial <lb/>reflecting that the &quot; Rio markers &quot; are not applicable to general budget support – but available data suggests <lb/>that at least USD 26 million per year on average over 2010-12 has been channelled as green ODA through <lb/>general budget support, consisting of four large Poverty Reduction Budget Support transfers from Finland <lb/>and Germany. <lb/>13 <lb/>This finding is based on a review of ODA activities within DAC members&apos; climate change adaptation portfolios <lb/>that target cities of over 500,000 inhabitants. Over 200 out of 1600 activities (above USD 50,000) were identified <lb/>as targeting urban areas, based on the methodological approach developed for this study. This number may be <lb/>considered a lower bound, owing to limited information available to identify the location of some ODA activities <lb/>(OECD, 2014d).

			<body>CO-ORDINATION AND MAINSTREAMING OF GREEN ODA IN ZAMBIA <lb/>Providers have made considerable progress in ensuring harmonisation amongst their green activities and to <lb/>align these with Zambia&apos;s priorities through a provider co-ordination group, the Joint Assistance Strategy <lb/>for Zambia (JASZ) (Aogonda et al. 2009). The JASZ responds to broader concerns from the development <lb/>co-operation community that providers&apos; practices did not always fit well with national development <lb/>priorities and systems such as budget, programme and project planning cycles (see Box 2). The demands <lb/>on partner countries to meet with different providers&apos; objectives, reporting processes and procedures, along <lb/>with uncoordinated country analytical work and missions may create excessive transaction costs and <lb/>reduce the effectiveness of development co-operation. Providers and partner countries therefore have <lb/>recognised that urgent, co-ordinated and sustained action is required to reduce overlap, waste and <lb/>fragmentation among providers and to reduce the burden placed upon partner countries (Birdsall and <lb/>Kharas, 2014). This section explores the green activities of the JASZ since 2007 and how this has helped <lb/>mainstream green activities into the portfolios of development co-operation providers. <lb/>Provider co-ordination efforts: the Joint Assistance Strategy for Zambia <lb/>The JASZ is an instrument developed by 16 DAC and multilateral providers to co-ordinate their activities <lb/>and align these with the country&apos;s national development priorities. The Strategy is periodically reviewed <lb/>and updated with the introduction of successive NDPs. There are no specific projects under the JASZ, <lb/>rather the co-operating partners use the JASZ to inform their development co-operation projects and <lb/>programmes in-country (Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Denmark, 2010). <lb/>Joint Assistance Strategy for Zambia I: 2007-2010 <lb/>The first JASZ I and its priority sectors were based on the FNDP. According to the agreed division of <lb/>labour, the Nordic countries were meant to work on green issues; the EU, the US, Sweden, and the <lb/>development banks supported the agriculture sector; while the Netherlands, development banks and the <lb/>UK supported private sector development (Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Finland, 2010). Co-operating <lb/>partners also committed to increase their funding of green issues. In line with the FNDP, the co-operating <lb/>partners together with the government of Zambia, civil society and the private sector identified the <lb/>following priority areas as a target for green ODA (Irish Aid, 2008; Aongola et al., 2009; Ministry of <lb/>Foreign Affairs of Denmark, 2010): <lb/>• increasing capacity building efforts and funding for environmental planning and mainstreaming;<lb/>• introducing strategic environmental assessments at the national and sector levels, and <lb/>strengthening the application of environmental impact assessments, including participatory <lb/>approaches, to ensure the effective mainstreaming of green issues;<lb/>• carrying out joint analytical work with the government to support knowledge management;<lb/>• focusing on fisheries, forests, land, renewable energy and wildlife, and ensuring sufficient <lb/>attention is paid to climate change adaptation.<lb/>The co-operating partners&apos; targeting of these priorities were meant to assist Zambia in achieving <lb/>Millennium Development Goal 7 (Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Denmark, 2010). Additionally, Zambia <lb/>worked to reform and enhance the capacity of its government institutions, including its statutory bodies <lb/></body>

			<body>aiming to help fulfil their mandates; to strengthen cross-sectoral co-ordination mechanisms; to address <lb/>equity and transparency issues in the access and control of resources; to capture the contribution of green <lb/>issues on the national economy and its impact in poverty alleviation; and to assess the impact of natural <lb/>resource base degradation on growth pillars such as agriculture and tourism (Ministry of Foreign Affairs of <lb/>Denmark, 2010). <lb/>The Strategy led to a more structured process to support the green dimension in Zambian development <lb/>policy and its strategy (Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Denmark, 2010). As a mechanism, the JASZ I <lb/>helped identify improvements in provider activity and in providing an effective model for greater sector-<lb/>level co-ordination on green issues (Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Denmark, 2010). Information sharing <lb/>through the JASZ I reduced duplication of activities and, where relevant, provided more co-ordinated <lb/>support to the development of government systems. The dialogue architecture that emerged from the <lb/>Strategy made a considerable contribution to encouraging harmonisation. Indeed, the co-operating <lb/>partners&apos; troika structure, whereby three co-operating partners represent the JASZ I signatories in dialogue <lb/>with the government of Zambia, was generally perceived as successful and as having improved the flow of <lb/>information (Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Denmark, 2010). <lb/>However, the co-operating partners identified generic drawbacks that significantly weakened its ability to <lb/>achieve its objectives (Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Denmark, 2010): <lb/>• The Strategy neither contains specific targets nor does it define indicators against which progress <lb/>can be measured. A work plan was developed in late 2007 and some of its elements were <lb/>implemented. However, no work plans and no systematic processes to follow up on the <lb/>commitments and actions were subsequently agreed.<lb/>• The government of Zambia was initially neither a signatory to the JASZ I nor to the work plan, <lb/>despite the success of the JASZ I depending on governmental actions. In addition, there were <lb/>doubts regarding the government&apos;s leadership in this process and the capacity for the Ministry of <lb/>Finance and National Planning (MoFNP) to manage ODA (Ministry of Foreign Affairs of <lb/>Denmark, 2010). The government is now aware of this and has taken steps to develop a <lb/>mechanism for taking an effective cross-sector strategic view on green ODA issues and has <lb/>anchored these responsibilities within the MoFNP.<lb/>• Existing consultative mechanisms are driven by co-operating partners and often do not respect <lb/>governmental processes. The requirements of providers still dictate many actions and a number <lb/>of important decisions are taken bilaterally, which undermine JASZ I processes. The risks were <lb/>that the JASZ I may have resulted in leaving green issues entirely up to a few providers to lead, <lb/>offering vague mainstreaming promises for the portfolio of other providers engaged with the <lb/>JASZ I but not leading on green issues (European Commission, 2007).<lb/></body>

			<page>29 <lb/></page>

			<body>Joint Assistance Strategy for Zambia II: 2011-2015 <lb/>JASZ II builds on the lessons learned from JASZ I, as well as on priorities identified in the SNDP. JASZ II <lb/>aims to channel co-operating partners&apos; investment in Zambia to: address rural poverty and inclusive <lb/>growth; support Zambia&apos;s longer term transition away from ODA; introduce a more robust focus on <lb/>performance measurement and ensure management accountability; and improve the flow and quality of <lb/>information and dialogue between co-operating partners and the government of Zambia and other local <lb/>non-state actors (Co-operating Partners to the JASZ II, 2011). In an effort to improve the effectiveness and <lb/>harmonisation of the JASZ with national processes, the government has committed to managing the <lb/>division of labour among co-operating partners in the various sectors (Co-operating Partners to the JASZ <lb/>II, 2011). <lb/>In the energy sector, co-operating partners commit to expanding generation capacity in the power sector <lb/>and to scaling up access to clean, modern energy, primarily in rural areas. Co-operating partners will focus <lb/>on supporting the government&apos;s efforts to exploit cost-effective hydro-power generation and transmission, <lb/>strengthening the framework of ensuring an efficient and effective fuel supply system, including through <lb/>locally produced, sustainable biofuels, in line with the SNDP (Co-operating Partners to the JASZ II, 2011). <lb/>Co-operating partners will also continue to support the development of policies and legislation, and <lb/>increase community, civil society and private sector participation in forestry, wildlife and national heritage <lb/>to enhance sustainable management of natural resources. Co-operating partners will focus on the following <lb/>key areas, namely: <lb/>• Mainstreaming green issues into the planning, programming and budgetary frameworks for <lb/>central economic growth sectors by promoting strategic policy dialogue, joint planning and <lb/>programming on green issues, in particular to develop the capacity for climate resilience and low <lb/>carbon development;<lb/>• Conducting ecosystem assessments to inform green decision making and investments;<lb/>• Developing monitoring and performance assessment indicators to track implementation of green <lb/>programmes across sectors;<lb/>• Supporting fiscal and market based incentive mechanisms to improve green management, in <lb/>particular in pollution control and waste management;<lb/>• Intensifying the implementation of adaptation and mitigation initiatives as well as positioning the <lb/>country to benefit from climate financing opportunities (e.g., the Green Climate Fund; Co-<lb/>operating Partners to the JASZ II, 2011).<lb/></body>

			<page>30 <lb/></page>

			<body>With the elections of 2011, however, ministerial portfolios and mandates changed, with implications for <lb/>the implementation of the JASZ II (Watson et al., 2013). For example, after a period of uncertainty the <lb/>Ministry of Tourism, Environment and Natural Resources (MTENR) became the Ministry of Lands, <lb/>Natural Resources and Environmental Protection. The MTENR had led the preparation of the National <lb/>Climate Change Response Strategy since 2010 and had received support from Norway and the United <lb/>Nations Development Programme (UNDP) to establish a Facilitation Unit to co-ordinate climate change <lb/>activities in-country. With the governmental change, departments were reshuffled and annual departmental <lb/>and line budgets were housed in different ministries (Watson et al., 2013). In turn, this has slowed the <lb/>drafting and implementation of many JASZ II proposals. Notwithstanding this, the government of Zambia <lb/>has remained engaged with the green agenda and created an Interim National Climate Change Secretariat, <lb/>now housed in the Ministry of Finance. The Secretariat is the focal point for developing the Zambian IGGS <lb/>and co-ordinates all international and domestic green programmes and projects with the JASZ II (e.g. the <lb/>USAID Low Emissions Development Strategy, the PPCR (see Box 3), or the UN Joint Climate Project <lb/>REDD-Low Emissions Capacity Building Programme). <lb/>Provider strategies to mainstream green issues into development co-operation <lb/>Green issues have been at the centre of many DAC providers&apos; ODA activities in Zambia. Chart 8 illustrates <lb/>the top nine green providers, accounting for 97% of total green bilateral ODA to Zambia over 2004-12. <lb/>Norway, Japan and Germany are the largest providers in absolute terms, and together account for 53% of <lb/>green ODA to Zambia. It is important to note that Japan, Norway, Denmark and Finland commit the <lb/>largest amount of ODA targeting green objectives as a principal objective over the same period. Green <lb/>ODA as a proportion of a provider&apos;s total ODA portfolio gives an indication of the priority that this <lb/>provider is placing on green issues. By this measure, Finland stands out in dedicating about 41% of its total <lb/>ODA commitments to Zambia to green issues, followed by Denmark and Norway (each 37%). This <lb/>reflects the division of labour of the JASZ I. <lb/>Chart 8.

			<body>CONCLUSION <lb/>Zambia aims to become a &quot; prosperous middle-income country &quot; by 2030 (Government of Zambia, 2006b). <lb/>Achieving this will likely depend upon how Zambia manages its natural assets, controls pollution and <lb/>prepares for the impacts of climate change. In addition to a range of existing green plans and policies, <lb/>Zambia aims to develop an explicit and comprehensive Inclusive Green Growth Strategy, to ensure that <lb/>future development and growth takes green considerations more centrally into account. Importantly, <lb/>Zambia aims to ensure that the green dimension of economic growth and well-being is fully integrated and <lb/>has a higher profile in its development plans (see OECD, 2013 on the rationale for doing so). The process <lb/>of formulating this Strategy provides an opportunity to assess the environmental sustainability of existing <lb/>growth patterns and to identify the structural changes needed in the economy to ensure growth and poverty <lb/>reduction, while also protecting the environment. This process could not only build upon past domestic <lb/>experience with green policy-making and mainstreaming of environmental objectives into sector policies, <lb/>but also upon the experience of the international development co-operation community. Indeed, support <lb/>from the international development co-operation community has been increasingly important in Zambia <lb/>since 2004. <lb/>This paper reviewed to what extent development co-operation activities are aligned with Zambian priorities <lb/>and needs. The statistical analysis provided here finds that green ODA has targeted some of the economic <lb/>engines of Zambia (e.g. agriculture, forestry) and has significantly contributed to &quot; greening &quot; other key <lb/>domestic sectors, such as energy, water supply and sanitation, or transport. Furthermore, providers have <lb/>supported a range of capacity building activities, including environmental policy and legislation <lb/>formulation, data management, resource valuing, community engagement and benefit-sharing in the green <lb/>space. These activities are strongly aligned with the country&apos;s Long-Term Vision and its various National <lb/>Development Plans (see also Co-operating Partners to the JASZ I, 2007; Co-operating Partners to the <lb/>JASZ II, 2011). There is evidence, too, that alignment was informed by the Joint Assistance Strategy for <lb/>Zambia (JASZ). The JASZ I and II has helped co-ordinate 16 DAC providers active in Zambia, has <lb/>avoided the duplication of green projects and programmes, and has improved the information flow with the <lb/>government (Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Denmark, 2010). <lb/>Despite strong alignment with Zambian priorities, the paper shows there is scope for further alignment <lb/>with Zambian priorities, and of co-ordination among providers and with the government (Mulenga, 2013). <lb/>First, virtually no green bilateral ODA flowed to a number of key sectors for the Zambian economy, such <lb/>as mining, industry or tourism. The mining sector, in particular, is crucial for it generates up to 30% of <lb/>Zambia&apos;s GDP, creates substantial amounts of waste and pollution, and is vulnerable to water scarcity and <lb/>climate change. Second, green ODA has not yet demonstrated a link to the overarching developmental goal <lb/>of reducing poverty in Zambia. Poverty reduction is expected to require a private sector role (Kivuitu et al., <lb/>2005), yet little is known about the activities of development co-operation providers to help make this link. <lb/>Third, development co-operation places relatively low emphasis on the mainstreaming of green issues into <lb/>local-level institutions and planning processes (Terpstra et al. 2013; UN-HABITAT, 2014). This is <lb/>especially true at the urban level, where no projects could be identified in 2010-12, despite heightened <lb/>vulnerability at this level. Finally, the JASZ worked in an iterative manner to refine its approach and align <lb/>its work with Zambian priorities but struggled with Zambian bureaucracy, staff rotation and delays in the <lb/>process of working with line ministries. Strengthening the capacity of the Zambian government and its <lb/>institutions to more closely work with the JASZ could help to make development co-operation more <lb/>effective. <lb/></body>

			<page>36 <lb/></page>

			<body>These findings can support and inform the national agenda for action in Zambia to advance its green <lb/>growth agenda and Inclusive Green Growth Strategy (IGGS). They can also assist providers of <lb/>development co-operation to better target their activities. Notwithstanding this, further analytical work <lb/>could benefit the IGGS process. First, it would be important to understand how ODA dependence on green <lb/>matters is perceived by the Zambian government (e.g. exploring if the government interested in building <lb/>sufficient capacity and political support for green goals, the potential for self-or co-financing such <lb/>activities over time using domestic resources, and the role that providers could take to support these <lb/>developments). Second, and relatedly, Zambia could work with providers to develop, implement, and <lb/>evaluate new types of goals that sustain the &quot; greening &quot; of policy and practice over time. By setting clear <lb/>goals, by tracking outcomes or impacts, gaps and improvements regarding the mainstreaming of green <lb/>issues, providers and the Zambian government could improve their ODA effectiveness and better <lb/>understand what green ODA is achieving on the ground. Finally, there is potential to work with Zambian <lb/>stakeholders to understand better the potential pathways to improve harmonisation and alignment of <lb/>development co-operation with Zambian priorities. This could provide lessons, for example, on the <lb/>potential use of country systems, beyond national planning, to channel support; and might begin by <lb/>monitoring and evaluating relevant systems (e.g. mechanisms for internal co-ordination, budgetary and <lb/>financial management, and procurement systems). <lb/></body>

			<body>ANNEX 1: THE OECD DAC CREDITOR REPORTING SYSTEM AND THE RIO MARKERS <lb/>Since 1998 the DAC has monitored development finance targeting the objectives of the Rio Conventions. <lb/>Data are reported by members of the OECD DAC, collected through the &quot;Creditor Reporting System&quot; <lb/>(CRS) and identified as using &quot; Rio markers &quot; , where providers are requested to indicate for each <lb/>development finance activity whether or not it targets environmental objectives. There are four Rio <lb/>markers, covering: biodiversity, desertification, climate change mitigation, and climate change adaptation. <lb/>A scoring system of three values is used, in which official development finance activities reported to the <lb/>DAC CRS are screened and &quot; marked &quot; as either (i) targeting the conventions as a &quot; principal &quot; objective or <lb/>(ii) as a &quot; significant &quot; objective, or (iii) not targeting the objective. These markers indicate donors&apos; policy <lb/>objectives in relation to each development finance activity. Activities marked as having a &quot; principal &quot; <lb/>objective would not have been funded but for that objective; activities marked &quot; significant &quot; have other <lb/>prime objectives but have been formulated or adjusted to help meet the relevant environmental concerns. <lb/>The markers provide an indication of the degree of mainstreaming of environmental considerations into <lb/>development co-operation portfolios. In marking the full value of development finance activities the <lb/>markers are considered descriptive rather than strictly quantitative, but allow for an approximate <lb/>quantification of development finance flows that target the Rio convention objectives. In marker data <lb/>presentations the figures for flows targeting objectives as principal or significant can be shown separately <lb/>and the sum referred to as the &quot; total &quot; or &quot; upper bound &quot; of environmental-related development finance. <lb/>Climate change mitigation is defined as activities that contribute to the objective of stabilisation of <lb/>greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous <lb/>anthropogenic interference with the climate system by promoting efforts to reduce or limit GHG emissions <lb/>or to enhance GHG sequestration. <lb/>Climate change adaptation is defined as activities that aim to reduce the vulnerability of human or <lb/>natural systems to the impacts of climate change and climate-related risks, by maintaining or increasing <lb/>adaptive capacity and resilience. This encompasses a range of activities from information and knowledge <lb/>generation, to capacity development, planning and the implementation of climate change adaptation <lb/>actions. <lb/>Biodiversity is defined as activities that promote at least one of the three objectives of the Convention on <lb/>Biological Diversity: the conservation of biodiversity; sustainable use of its components (ecosystems, <lb/>species or genetic resources); or fair and equitable sharing of the benefits of the utilisation of genetic <lb/>resources. <lb/>Desertification is defined as activities that aim at combating desertification or mitigating the effects of <lb/>drought in arid, semi-arid or dry sub-humid areas through prevention and/or reduction of land degradation, <lb/>rehabilitation of partly degraded land, or reclamation of desertified land. <lb/>Environment is defined as activities that are intended to produce an improvement, or something that is <lb/>diagnosed as an improvement, in the physical and/or biological environment of the recipient country, area <lb/></body>

			<page>43 <lb/></page>

			<body>or target group concerned, or activities that include specific action to integrate environmental concerns <lb/>with a range of development objectives through institution building and/or capacity development. <lb/>The Rio markers are applicable to Official Development Assistance (ODA) where reporting is mandatory, <lb/>for the mitigation marker from 2007 flows, and for the adaptation marker since 2010. Reporting is <lb/>voluntary on Other Official Flows (OOF) (i.e. non-concessional developmental flows, excluding export <lb/>credits) starting from 2010. <lb/>A key feature of the marker methodology is that one activity can address several policy objectives at the <lb/>same time. This reflects the fact that the three Rio conventions (targeting global environmental objectives) <lb/>and local environmental objectives are mutually reinforcing, but this overlap poses a problem when <lb/>aggregating data across several markers. <lb/>The same activity can be marked for e.g. biodiversity and climate change mitigation, or for mitigation and <lb/>adaptation. To avoid double or triple-counting the same activity, aggregate figures for biodiversity-, <lb/>climate change mitigation-, climate change adaptation-and desertification-related aid should not be added <lb/>up. Statistical presentations should either be prepared for one marker at a time, and resulting totals for each <lb/>marker should not be added up – or the overlap should be &quot; treated &quot; . &quot; Treating &quot; the overlap involves <lb/>identifying and deducting the &quot; overlap &quot; , and requires activity-level data. <lb/>For more information, see the user guide, available at http://oe.cd/Riomarkers. <lb/></body>
