			<p>Waiting times for elective (non-emergency) treatments are a key health policy concern in several<lb/> OECD countries. This study describes common measures on waiting times across OECD countries from<lb/> administrative data. It focuses on common elective procedures, like hip and knee replacement, and cataract<lb/> surgery, where waiting times are notoriously long. It provides comparative data on waiting times across<lb/> twelve OECD countries and presents trends in waiting times in the last decade. Waiting times appear to be<lb/> low in the Netherlands and Denmark. In the last decade the United Kingdom (in particular England),<lb/> Finland and the Netherlands have witnessed large reductions in waiting times which can be attributed to a<lb/> range of policy initiatives, including higher spending, waiting-times target schemes, and incentive<lb/> mechanisms which reward higher levels of activity. The negative trend in these countries has however<lb/> halted in recent years and in some cases reverted. The analysis also emphasizes systematic differences<lb/> across different waiting-time measures, in particular between the distribution of waiting times of patients<lb/> treated versus the one of patients on the list. For example, the mean waiting time of patients on the list is<lb/> generally higher than the mean waiting time of patients treated though we can find examples of the<lb/> opposite. Mean waiting times are systematically higher than median waiting times and the difference can<lb/> be quantitatively large.<lb/></p>

			<figure>Les délais d&apos;attente pour les traitements électifs (non urgents) constituent un problème majeur de la<lb/> politique de santé dans plusieurs pays de l&apos;OCDE. Cette étude fondée sur des données administratives<lb/> décrit les mesures courantes pour réduire les temps d&apos;attente dans les pays de l&apos;OCDE.

Elle<lb/> fournit des données comparatives sur les délais d&apos;attente dans douze pays de l&apos;OCDE et montre comment<lb/> ils ont évolué ces dix dernières années. Ainsi, ils paraissent être courts aux Pays-Bas et au Danemark. Ces<lb/> dix dernières années, le Royaume-Uni (en particulier l&apos;Angleterre), la Finlande et les Pays-Bas ont vu leurs<lb/> délais d&apos;attente se réduire considérablement, ceci pouvant être attribué à une série d&apos;initiatives stratégiques,<lb/> comme une hausse des dépenses, la mise en place de systèmes d&apos;objectif des délais d&apos;attente et des<lb/> mécanismes d&apos;incitation récompensant des niveaux d&apos;activité plus élevés.

			<p>1.<lb/> Waiting times for elective procedures are a major health policy concern in many OECD<lb/> countries. Policymakers across the world face considerable challenges in reducing waiting times. Policy<lb/> initiatives are regularly introduced to tackle excessive waiting times with varying success (Siciliani,<lb/> <ref type="biblio">Borowitz and Moran, 2013</ref>). *<lb/> 2.<lb/> This study aims at providing comparative evidence of waiting times across OECD countries and<lb/> explores trends in waiting times in the last decade. OECD countries tend to differ in the way waiting times<lb/> are measured and utilised for benchmarking or regulatory purposes. We identify the most common<lb/> measures and explain how these differ. We then compare waiting times across 12 OECD countries 1 for<lb/> common surgical procedures (such as hip and knee replacement and cataract). We compare mean and<lb/> median waiting times and their distribution. Finally, we illustrate time trends in waiting times and relate<lb/> sharp reductions in waiting times for some countries to specific policy initiatives. Comparative information<lb/> on waiting times can feed into policy discussion and contribute to assessment of the waiting time<lb/> phenomenon in each county. The analysis on time trends can help to identify countries that have been able<lb/> to successfully and significantly reduce waiting times.<lb/> 3.<lb/> The analysis is part of the Second OECD Waiting Time Project in 2011-12 whose objectives<lb/> were to compare policies across countries (see Siciliani, <ref type="biblio">Borowitz and Moran, 2013</ref>) and collect<lb/> comparative waiting times figures for specific procedures, which is the focus of this study.<lb/> 2 The analysis<lb/> relies on measures of waiting times from large administrative datasets for specific surgical procedures.<lb/> 4.<lb/> The existing evidence on comparative waiting times is very limited. <ref type="biblio">Siciliani and Hurst (2004)<lb/></ref> provide similar comparative data for the year 2000. These data are now out of date and are limited in that<lb/> they refer to only one of the three measures employed in this study (the inpatient waiting time of patient<lb/> treated) for one point in time. Our study updates such data, employs additional common measures (such as<lb/> the waiting time of patients on the list, and the waiting time from referral to treatment), explores the<lb/> distribution of waiting times and provides time trends covering a 10-year period. There is some limited<lb/> evidence on waiting times from survey data especially from Commonwealth countries (<ref type="biblio">Shoen et al., 2010</ref>).<lb/> However, these are aggregated for any elective procedure, are based on small samples and may suffer from<lb/> recall bias. Evidence on waiting times constructed from administrative data is based on large samples (in<lb/> most cases they include the whole population who received a treatment), using objective measures of<lb/> waiting times and suffer less from aggregation bias (since it focuses on specific procedures). Recent work<lb/> by the Swedish Association of Local Authorities and Regions (SALAR) (<ref type="biblio">SALAR, 2011, 2013</ref>) compares<lb/> Sweden with other countries. This work uses waiting times data sourced from secondary sources (not from<lb/> a direct questionnaire to countries as is the source of the data collection discussed in this paper), covers<lb/> only two procedures and refers to one point in time.<lb/> *<lb/> Luigi Siciliani and Valerie Moran, University of York; Michael Borowitz, Global Fund.<lb/> 1<lb/> <ref type="biblio">Australia, Canada, Denmark, Ireland, Finland, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Portugal, Slovenia, Spain</ref>,<lb/> Sweden and the United Kingdom.<lb/> 2<lb/> A summary of the First OECD Waiting Time Project is contained in <ref type="biblio">Siciliani and Hurst (2004, 2005</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<head>2. Data<lb/> Background: Measures of waiting times across OECD countries<lb/></head>

			<p>5.<lb/> The measurement of waiting times varies across OECD countries. Common measures from<lb/> administrative datasets are the &quot; inpatient waiting time &quot; (from specialist addition to the list to treatment)<lb/> and the &quot; referral-to-treatment waiting time &quot; (from GP/family doctor referral to treatment).<lb/> 6.<lb/> Common reported figures include the mean waiting times, the waiting time at different<lb/> percentiles of the distribution (at the 50 th percentile, i.e. the median, the 80 th or 90 th percentile), and the<lb/> number of patients waiting more than a threshold waiting time, for example three, six or nine months.<lb/> 7.<lb/> Waiting times are reported in most countries by procedure (e.g. hip and knee replacement,<lb/> cataract surgery) or by specialty (e.g. ophthalmology, orthopaedics). They refer mainly to two<lb/> distributions: i) the distribution of waiting times of patients treated in a given period (for example a<lb/> financial year); ii) the distribution of waiting times of the patients on the list at a point in time (a census<lb/> date).<lb/></p>

			<head>Data collection and waiting time definitions<lb/></head>

			<p>8.<lb/> The data were collected as part of the Second OECD Waiting Time Project in 2011-2012.<lb/> Waiting times were collected for the following common elective (non-emergency) surgical procedures: hip<lb/> replacement, knee replacement, cataract surgery, vaginal hysterectomy, prostatectomy, cholecystectomy,<lb/> inguinal and femoral hernia, percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) and coronary bypass.<lb/> To classify surgical procedures, we used ICD-9-CM codes as a reference (see Appendix). Data were<lb/> collected from 1999 to 2011. For a subset of measures data are available also for 2012.<lb/></p>

			<head>3<lb/></head>

			<p>9.<lb/> Our questionnaire asked countries to provide waiting times according to four different<lb/> definitions:<lb/> 1. Inpatient waiting times (from specialist addition to the list) of patients treated in a given year<lb/> (publicly funded patients)<lb/> 10.<lb/> This definition does not include &apos;the time elapsed from the date of referral of the general<lb/> practitioner to the date of specialist assessment&apos; (in some countries referred to as &apos;outpatient waiting<lb/> time&apos;). Inpatient waiting times were collected for all &apos;publicly-funded patients&apos; that received treatment<lb/> either by publicly or privately (non-profit and for-profit) owned providers. We do not focus on privately-<lb/>funded patients since waiting time data for these patients are generally not collected on a routine basis<lb/> through administrative data.<lb/> 2. Referral-to-treatment waiting times (from family doctor referral) of patients treated in a given<lb/> year (publicly funded patients)<lb/> 11.<lb/> Referral-to-treatment waiting times refer to &quot; the time elapsed from the family doctor (General<lb/> Practitioner) referral to the date patients added on the non-emergency (elective) surgery waiting list were<lb/> admitted to an inpatient or day-case surgical unit for the procedure &quot; . Therefore, compared to the first<lb/> measure, it includes also the time elapsed from the family doctor (general practitioner) referral to the<lb/> specialist visit. By definition it is longer than the inpatient waiting time.<lb/> 3. Inpatient waiting times (from specialist addition to the list) of patients on the list at a census date<lb/> (publicly funded patients)<lb/> 12.<lb/> This measure is analogous to Measure 1 but refers to the patients on the list at a given census date<lb/> (as opposed to the patients treated in a given year). Inpatient waiting times on the list includes &quot; the time<lb/> elapsed for a patient on the non-emergency (elective) surgery waiting list from the date they were added to<lb/> the waiting list for the procedure (following specialist assessment) to a designated census date &quot; .<lb/> 4. Referral-to-treatment waiting time (from family doctor referral to treatment) of patients on the<lb/> list at a census date (publicly funded patients)<lb/> 13.<lb/> This measure is analogous to Measure 3 but refers to the total waiting time of patients (starting<lb/> from GP/family doctor referral) on the list at a given census date (as opposed to the patients treated in a<lb/> given year).<lb/> 14.<lb/> Reported measures of waiting times refer to either of two distributions: i) the distribution of<lb/> waiting times of patients treated in a given period (for example, a financial year); ii) the distribution of<lb/> waiting times of the patients on the list at a point in time (a census date). The first distribution measures the<lb/> full duration of the patient&apos;s waiting time experience (from entering to exiting the list). The second<lb/> measure of waiting times of patients on the list is instead &quot; incomplete &quot; , since the patient&apos;s wait has yet to<lb/> come to an end. The waiting time of patients treated has the advantage of capturing the full duration of a<lb/> patient&apos;s journey, but obviously is retrospective in nature. The main advantage of the waiting time of<lb/> patients on the list is that it captures the experience of the patients who are still waiting at a point in time<lb/> (<ref type="biblio">Dixon and Siciliani, 2009</ref>).<lb/> 15.<lb/> For each measure, we have collected the mean and median waiting time. We also collected<lb/> information on the proportion of patients waiting 0-3 months, 4-6 months, 7-9 months, 10-12 months, over<lb/> 12 months. Although the mean and the median are more representative of the average patient&apos;s experience,<lb/> other measures, such as the proportion of patients waiting more than 9 months focus on patients who are<lb/> most disadvantaged, i.e. those with the longest wait (although if prioritisation works well, these are likely<lb/> to be patients with the lowest severity).<lb/> 16.<lb/> Eight countries provided inpatient waiting times data for patients treated; six for inpatient on the<lb/> list. Only one country (Denmark) provided data on referral to treatment for patients treated (measure 2).<lb/> No country could provide data on referral to treatment for patients on the list (measure 4). Note that<lb/> referral-to-treatment waiting times are collected in England but not by surgical procedure (only by<lb/> specialty or for all specialties; see Siciliani, Borowitz and Moran, 2013, chapter 2, for a general discussion<lb/> and example of different measures). We did not attempt to collect data at specialty level (ophthalmology,<lb/> orthopaedics, etc.) since definitions of specialties across OECD countries may differ significantly.<lb/></p>

			<head>3. Results<lb/> The mean waiting time can be substantially higher than the median<lb/></head>

			<p>17.<lb/> <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> provides mean and median waiting times, measured in days, according to our three<lb/> definitions. Most countries could provide both the mean and median wait though some countries provided<lb/> only the median (Australia, Canada and Sweden) and others only the mean (the Netherlands and Spain).<lb/></p>

			<p>18.<lb/> It is important to distinguish between the mean and the median for international comparisons<lb/> since, as expected, the mean waiting time is systematically higher than the median confirming the skewed<lb/> distribution of waiting times. Moreover, the difference can be quantitatively large. For example, in Finland<lb/> mean waiting times of patients treated for hip and knee replacement were 10-12% higher than the median;<lb/> it was 30% higher for cholecystectomy, and 39% higher for prostatectomy. In England and Scotland, the<lb/> mean waiting time was 8-34% higher depending on the procedure. In Portugal differences between mean<lb/> and median waiting times were generally higher than in other countries (as suggested below this may be<lb/> due a more significant proportion of long waiters).<lb/> 19.<lb/> Across the five countries that report both mean and median waiting time for patients treated in<lb/> 2011 (Finland, New Zealand, Portugal, England and Scotland) the correlation between mean and median<lb/> wait for a given procedure, e.g. cataract, is very high (above 0.9 for seven out of nine procedures; it is<lb/> above 0.8 for cholecystectomy and is 0.73 for hip replacement; the last result is due to the larger difference<lb/> between the mean and the median in Portugal). This is also the case when correlating mean and median<lb/> waiting time for patients on the list.<lb/></p>

			<head>Waiting times are low in the Netherlands and Denmark<lb/></head>

			<p>20.<lb/> Among the countries reporting inpatient waiting times of patients treated (upper part of <ref type="table">Table<lb/> 1a</ref>), the Netherlands exhibits the lowest waiting times: mean waiting times are below one month and a half.<lb/> Notice that, even though we do not have the median waiting time for the Netherlands, the mean waiting<lb/> time (which is generally higher than the median) is lower in the Netherlands than the median in the other<lb/> countries which report inpatient waiting time of patients treated.<lb/> 21.<lb/> Denmark, which measures waiting time from referral to treatment, also exhibits short waiting<lb/> times compared to the other countries that report the waiting times of patients treated. Despite their<lb/> measure including the additional wait from GP referral to specialist appointment, waiting times are lower<lb/> compared to most of the other countries. More precisely, if we exclude the Netherlands from the<lb/> comparison, Denmark has shorter waiting times for hip and knee replacement, hysterectomy and<lb/> cholecystectomy and hernia, compared to the countries reported in the upper part of <ref type="table">Table 1a</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<head>Waiting times of patients treated are systematically different from those of patients on the list<lb/></head>

			<p>22.<lb/> Three countries (New Zealand, Portugal and Spain) report inpatient waiting times both for<lb/> patients treated and for patients on the list. The results show how generally the two measures provide<lb/> different results and are therefore not comparable. For New Zealand, the mean/median waiting time of<lb/> patients treated is generally higher than for those on the list (with the exception of coronary bypass in 2011<lb/> and 2012 and median waiting time for PTCA in 2012). This is also the case for Spain. For Portugal this<lb/> holds only for one procedure in 2011 and 2012: knee replacement. The opposite holds for seven procedures<lb/> in 2011 and five procedures in 2012 with mean and median waiting time being lower for patients treated<lb/> than for those on the list. As mentioned above, the distribution of waiting times of patients on the list over-<lb/>samples long-waiting patients. Since Portugal has a longer tail of patients with long waiting times, this may<lb/> explain the different results for this country.<lb/> 23.<lb/> The difference between mean (or median) waiting time for patients treated versus patients on the<lb/> list can be quantitatively large. For New Zealand the mean (median) waiting time for patients treated was<lb/> 29-54% (35-66%) higher than the wait of patients on the list when including hip and knee replacement,<lb/> cataract surgery, hysterectomy and prostatectomy in 2012. In Spain it was 20-37% higher among the five<lb/> procedures available in 2011. Even when the waiting time of patients on the list is higher, as is the case for<lb/> Portugal, differences can be large: for example the mean (median) waiting time of patients on the list for<lb/> hip replacement, cataract and prostatectomy was 21-45% (15-35%) higher than the waiting time of patients<lb/> treated in 2012.<lb/> 24.<lb/> In Sweden waiting times are provided only for four procedures. They appear generally low<lb/> compared to the other countries with a median waiting time for hip, knee replacement, cataract surgery and<lb/> coronary bypass of 43, 45, 40 and 25 days respectively.<lb/> 25.<lb/> Slovenia reports relatively long waiting times compared to any other country, in particular for hip<lb/> and knee replacement, and PTCA. The mean waiting time for hip replacement is close to one year (354<lb/> days) and for knee replacement well above one year (512 days). Waiting times are lower for cataract<lb/> surgery and in line with other countries (63 days) and similarly for cholecystectomy and hernia<lb/> (comparable to Ireland and lower than Portugal).<lb/> 26.<lb/> Similarly, with respect to the distribution of waiting times of patients on the list the mean wait is<lb/> systematically higher than the median. For example, for hip replacement it was about 9-44% higher in<lb/> Ireland, New Zealand and Portugal in 2012. For cataract surgery it was 10-40% higher in the same<lb/> countries in 2012. In Slovenia the differences were smaller (1-33%) for hip and knee replacement, and<lb/> cataract surgery in 2012. The largest difference was for prostatectomy in Portugal where mean waiting<lb/> times were 98% higher than the median in 2012.<lb/></p>

			<head>There is evidence of prioritization across treatments<lb/></head>

			<p>27.<lb/> There is a clear evidence of prioritization across different treatments and procedures. Waiting<lb/> times for more urgent procedures, such as coronary bypass and PTCA, are generally lowest or among the<lb/> lowest (with median waiting times generally below one month and only occasionally below two months).<lb/> Instead, median waiting times are higher for less urgent procedures. At the other end of the spectrum,<lb/> median waiting times of three months are common across several countries for hip replacement, and in<lb/> some cases longer than three months for knee replacement which generally exhibits the longest wait.<lb/> Median waiting times are generally intermediate for hysterectomy and prostatectomy: they are above one<lb/> month though they can reach three months. These procedures are arguably more urgent than hip and knee<lb/> replacements but less urgent (on average) than coronary bypass. These results are not surprising. Doctors<lb/> are trained to prioritize patients on the waiting list. Moreover, there is an increasing policy focus on<lb/> developing guidelines to improve prioritization of patients on the list across the OECD countries, but in<lb/> particular New Zealand, Canada, Norway and other Nordic countries (Siciliani, Borowitz and Moran,<lb/> 2013, chapter 3).<lb/></p>

			<head>Waiting times are not always highly correlated across procedures<lb/></head>

			<p>28.<lb/> We may ponder the extent to which a country that has long waiting times for one particular<lb/> procedure (e.g. hip replacement) is also more likely to have long waiting times for other procedures (e.g.<lb/> cataract, coronary bypass), as a result for example, of a tighter capacity constraint across the whole system.<lb/> We show that in some instances such correlations are high but they are sensitive to the sample of countries<lb/> considered and the measure considered (e.g. the mean or median).<lb/> 29.<lb/> We computed the correlation across eight procedures (excluding PTCA since data coverage is<lb/> less compared to other procedures) for the six countries that reported mean waiting time for patients treated<lb/> (Finland, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Portugal, Scotland and England) in 2011. Excluding coronary<lb/> bypass and cataract surgery, the correlations among the remaining six procedures were relatively high -<lb/>above 0.65. Cataract surgery had a correlation that ranged between 0.44 (with cholecystectomy) and 0.82<lb/> (with hysterectomy). Coronary bypass generally exhibits low correlation with the other procedures and a<lb/> wide range -between -0.36 (with prostatectomy) and 0.50 (with cataract surgery). This is due to England<lb/> and Scotland having relatively longer waiting times for coronary bypass compared to the other countries,<lb/> while performing well on the other procedures. The results were similar when Spain was included in the<lb/> sample for the five procedures available for this country.<lb/> 30.<lb/> When using the median waiting time of patients treated correlations across procedures were<lb/> generally lower. When including six countries (Australia, Finland, New Zealand, Portugal, Scotland and<lb/> England), correlations were above 0.5 in only four out of 28 possible correlations among the eight<lb/> procedures (hip/knee, hip/cataract, knee/hernia, hernia/cholecystectomy). Correlations were in the range<lb/> 0.3-0.5 in seven instances, and otherwise lower than 0.3. Waiting times for coronary bypass were generally<lb/> negatively correlated with waiting times for other procedures.<lb/> 31.<lb/> The difference in the results between the correlations of mean waiting times across procedures<lb/> (highly correlated) and median waiting times across procedures (not highly correlated) is due to two<lb/> factors. First, the sample of countries considered is different (i.e. excluding/including the Netherlands in<lb/> the second/first measure and including/excluding Australia in the second/first measure). Second, Portugal<lb/> exhibits a much larger difference between mean and median waiting times compared to the other countries.<lb/> 32.<lb/> When considering the patients on the list, a similar picture generally emerges. For example, the<lb/> correlation between median waiting times for hip and knee replacement across five countries (Ireland, New<lb/> Zealand, Portugal, Sweden and Slovenia) in 2011 is 0.99 but the correlation between hip (or knee)<lb/> replacement and cataract is close to zero. This is due to Ireland having relatively longer waiting times for<lb/> cataract (118 days) against a similar wait for hip/knee replacement and Slovenia having relatively shorter<lb/> waiting times for cataracts (58 days) against waiting times close to or over a year for hip and knee<lb/> replacement. Similarly, the correlation between mean waiting times between hip replacement and cataract<lb/> is -0.2 across five countries (Ireland, New Zealand, Portugal, Spain and Slovenia; note inclusion of Spain<lb/> and exclusion of Sweden) in 2011. This is again due to Ireland having relatively longer waiting times (144<lb/> days) for cataract and Slovenia having relatively shorter waiting times (63 days).<lb/></p>

			<head>Distribution of waiting times<lb/></head>

			<p>33.<lb/> We can gain some further insights by looking at the distribution of waiting times. This allows<lb/> focusing also on the tail of the distribution and the long waiters. We provide histograms that show the<lb/> proportion of patients waiting less than 3 months, between 3 and 6 months, between 6 and 9 months,<lb/> between 9 and 12 months, and over 12 months. We focus on hip replacement and cataract surgery.<lb/> 34.<lb/> <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>.a shows the distribution of waiting times of patients treated for hip replacement. The<lb/> histograms show that the distribution of waiting times is skewed. Most patients get treatment quickly with<lb/> more than 50% of patients being treated within 3 months in the UK, Portugal and New Zealand (but not in<lb/> Finland). Most of the remaining patients are treated within 6 months (with the exception of Portugal).<lb/> There is a tail of patients waiting more than 6 months: it around 6-7% in the UK, 15-18% in New Zealand<lb/> and Finland, and 28% in Portugal.<lb/></p>

			<figure>Figure 1.a. Hip replacement. Patients treated (2011)<lb/></figure>

			<p>35.<lb/> The distribution can differ significantly across countries. An interesting comparison is between<lb/> Portugal and New Zealand. They both have a median waiting time for hip replacement of about 3 months.<lb/> However, the proportion of patients waiting over 6 months is 15% in New Zealand and 28% in Portugal<lb/> leading to a larger mean waiting time in Portugal (128 days) than in New Zealand (104 days). This<lb/> example shows how synthetic measures such as the median can hide significant variations in the<lb/> distribution.<lb/> 36.<lb/> We can also compare the distribution of patients treated (<ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>.a) versus the distribution of<lb/> patients on the list (<ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>.b). New Zealand and Portugal report both distributions. The comparison of<lb/> <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>.a with <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>.b for hip replacement show how these distributions differ. In New Zealand, the<lb/> proportion of patients treated waiting more than 6 months is about 15% but the proportion of patients on<lb/> the list waiting more than 6 months is only 6%. This is not surprising. As mentioned above, the distribution<lb/> of patients on the list suffers from &apos;interruption&apos; bias (it measures an incomplete wait), which biases the<lb/> measure downwards, and reflects &apos;oversampling&apos; of long-wait patients, which biases the measure upwards.<lb/> Although these biases go in opposite directions, there is no reason why these should be the same. Notice<lb/> however how in some cases the figures between the two distributions may not be too dissimilar. For<lb/> example, for Portugal the proportion of patients waiting more than 6 months is in the range 27-28% under<lb/> both distributions. Similarly, the proportion of patients waiting more than 12 months is around 11-12%.<lb/></p>

			<p>39.<lb/> Such distributions show different degrees of dispersions in waiting times across countries. These<lb/> can be the result of a range of factors including different prioritisation policies (which encourage a<lb/> reduction of waiting time for high-severity patients and an increase in waiting time for low-severity<lb/> patients) but also variations in demand (different age compositions within or across countries) and<lb/> variations in supply within a country (where hospitals differ more systematically in waiting times).<lb/></p>

			<table>%<lb/> % waiting 0-3 months<lb/> % of patients waiting 4-6 months<lb/> % of patients waiting 7-12 months<lb/> % of patients waiting over 12 months<lb/> Time trends<lb/> 40.<lb/> Time trends show that waiting times have been relatively stable in most countries and across<lb/> procedures. There are however several cases where waiting times have reduced. In particular, the United<lb/> Kingdom and Finland have experienced large reductions in waiting times from a relatively high level in the<lb/> early 2000s. There are also declining trends for the Netherlands, Denmark and Portugal although this trend<lb/> has reversed in recent years in Portugal.<lb/> 41.<lb/> In Finland waiting times are generally stable or increasing up to 2002 or 2003 and then<lb/> characterized by a sharp reduction the following years. The reduction is substantial: about 43-48% for hip<lb/> and knee replacement, 30-51% for prostatectomy, hysterectomy, cholecystectomy and hernia, 55% for<lb/> cataract and 24% for bypass. The reduction in waiting times follows the introduction of a National Health<lb/> Care Guarantee introduced into Finnish law in 2005 (<ref type="biblio">Jonsson, et al, 2013</ref>). For elective treatment the<lb/> guarantee was three months (with few exceptions). Hospitals that failed to comply with the guarantee were<lb/> scrutinized by the Supervisory Agency (known as Valvira) and were subject to a threat of penalty fines.<lb/> The reductions in waiting times were associated with an increase in health expenditure for municipalities in<lb/> the first years of the guarantee (<ref type="biblio">Jonsson, et al, 2013</ref>).<lb/> 42.<lb/> In the United Kingdom waiting times have been gradually falling starting from 2001/2002. Both<lb/></table>

			<p>England and Scotland experienced a large gradual reduction in waiting times over a ten-year span. In<lb/> England waiting times more than halved for several procedures. In Scotland reductions in waiting times<lb/> were of the order 25-40% for several procedures. In 1999 waiting times were generally longer in England<lb/> than in Scotland. By 2011 waiting times were comparable. Waiting times have therefore fallen more<lb/> rapidly in England than in Scotland. There are two main explanations for these results. First, the United<lb/> Kingdom has experienced a sustained growth in health expenditure in the last decade. In 2000 health<lb/> expenditure was recognized to be low compared to other European and OECD countries, and policymakers<lb/> committed to increase expenditure to catch up with the other countries. Second, both England and Scotland<lb/> made use of waiting-time targets. These were however introduced at different times and with different<lb/> degrees of penalties. In England, heavy sanctions for hospitals not respecting the waiting-time targets were<lb/> introduced from 2000, a policy known as &quot; targets and terror &quot; (<ref type="biblio">Propper et al, 2008, 2010</ref>): senior health<lb/> administrators were at risk of losing their jobs if targets were not met. This may explain why reductions in<lb/> waiting times in England were larger than for Scotland. Although in Scotland hospitals were not subject to<lb/> economic penalties, regional health boards from 2003-2004 were monitored monthly on the achievement<lb/> of waiting time targets. Individual breaches had to be reported to the Scottish Executive and were<lb/> investigated (<ref type="biblio">Smith and Sutton, 2013</ref>). The UK has also experienced moderate increases in recent years for<lb/> all procedures except hysterectomy.<lb/> 43.<lb/> In New Zealand waiting times of patients treated have been fairly stable over the period 2003-<lb/>2011 for several procedures. Hysterectomy, cholecystectomy and hernia experienced some increases, and<lb/> coronary bypass some reductions in recent years. The dynamics of waiting times for patients on the list<lb/> looks however rather different. Over the same period, the waiting time of the patients on the list has more<lb/> than halved for most procedures. One explanation for the different time trends is that the waiting time of<lb/> patients on the list includes also patients that ultimately do not receive treatment. As time passes, providers<lb/> may become more active at &apos;validating&apos; the waiting list and/or regularly checking that patients on the list<lb/> still require treatment, i.e. quickly removing patients from the list when it becomes apparent that treatment<lb/> is no longer necessary (see Cumming, 2013 for more details).<lb/> 44.<lb/> In the Netherlands, waiting times have reduced over the period 2006-2011 for hip and knee<lb/> replacement, cataract, and to a lower extent coronary bypass while they were stable for the remaining<lb/> procedures, and increased slightly for cholecystectomy and hernia. As mentioned above, waiting times in<lb/> the Netherlands are low compared to other countries and have been low for at least five years. Compared to<lb/> similar figures for year 2000 provided by <ref type="biblio">Siciliani and Hurst (2004)</ref>, waiting times have significantly<lb/> reduced and more than halved for several procedures. The reductions between 2000 and 2006 were<lb/> achieved following a radical change in the hospital financing system which switched from fixed budgets to<lb/> activity-based funding (<ref type="biblio">Schut and Varkevisser, 2013</ref>). Additional reductions in recent years can be<lb/> attributed to a reform of specialist payments leading to a change from lump-sum payments to activity-<lb/>based payments in 2008, and an expansion of price competition (as part of a broader managed competition<lb/> reform) since 2005 (<ref type="biblio">Schut and Varkevisser, 2013</ref>). As a result of these reforms, waiting times are not a<lb/> significant health policy issue as they were in the 1990s. Concerns have however, been raised about the<lb/> rapid growth in health expenditure that activity-based financing has promoted.<lb/> 45.<lb/> In Denmark, we observe reductions for hip and knee replacement (by more than 30%),<lb/> prostatectomy (about 20%) and some modest reductions for cholecystectomy over the period 2005-2011,<lb/> increases for cataract (by more than 50%), while are relatively constant for the other procedures. As<lb/> mentioned above, waiting times are generally low compared to other OECD countries. Waiting times have<lb/> been a persistent focus of Danish health policy. A key policy has been &quot; free choice &quot; of hospital provider<lb/> for patients. The scheme implies that if the hospital can foresee that the maximum waiting time cannot be<lb/> fulfilled, then the patient can choose another public or private hospital, either within or outside Denmark<lb/> (<ref type="biblio">Christiansen and Beck, 2013</ref>). In 2002 the maximum waiting time guarantee was two months (and<lb/> replaced a former guarantee of three months). The guarantee was further reduced to four weeks in 2007<lb/> (independent of disease type and severity). &quot; Free choice &quot; was suspended in 2008-09 due to a hospital<lb/> personnel strike (<ref type="biblio">Christiansen and Beck, 2013</ref>).<lb/> 46.<lb/> We also observe reductions in waiting times across most procedures for Portugal although these<lb/> reductions started to reverse in 2011 for most procedures with the exception of hysterectomy. The recent<lb/> increases in waiting times are most pronounced for patients treated. Reductions in waiting times were<lb/> obtained through a series of policy initiatives which included a new integrated information system<lb/> combined with a voucher system for patients reaching 75% of max waiting time guarantee (<ref type="biblio">Barros et al.,<lb/> 2013</ref>). We also note sharp reductions for the patients on the list between 2006 and 2007 which, similar to<lb/> the experience in New Zealand, were possibly obtained by more accurate validation of the waiting list (this<lb/> is also reminiscent of the English experience in the early eighties, see <ref type="biblio">Siciliani and Hurst, 2005</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<figure>47.<lb/> Ireland has witnessed considerable reductions in waiting times of patients on the list -<lb/>particularly over the time-period 2007-2008 – for hip and knee replacement, prostatectomy and<lb/> cholecystectomy. Similar to Portugal and New Zealand, these sharp decreases can in part be attributed to<lb/> some cleaning of the waiting list by removing patients no longer available for treatment from the list<lb/> (Moran et al., 2013). In contrast, there was an increase in waiting times for cataract surgery during 2010-<lb/>2012 and hysterectomy during 2010-2011. There was a particularly sharp increase for coronary bypass<lb/> surgery from 2009-2010 but this subsequently decreased in 2011 and rose again in 2012.<lb/> 48.<lb/> Waiting times in Spain have been either stable or reduced to some extent in recent years (2003-<lb/>2011) but have increased in 2012 for cataract, prostatectomy and hip replacement. This is reflected in both<lb/> the wait of patients treated and on the list. A number of policy initiatives have been introduced, mainly<lb/> targeting the supply side, and include extending working hours for health personnel, additional resources<lb/> and the introduction of ambulatory surgery centres (García-Goñi and Costa-Font, 2013).<lb/> 49.<lb/> In Australia, median waiting times for patients treated have generally gradually increased over<lb/> the period 2002-2012, sometimes significantly (knee replacement, hysterectomy, cholecystectomy by 32-<lb/>47%, prostatectomy and hernia by 41-58%) but have been stable for cataract and coronary bypass. In<lb/> Canada, data are available only over the 4-year period 2008-2011 for selected procedures. Median waiting<lb/> times for hip and knee replacement have been moderately increasing (by less than 10% over five years),<lb/> and have been relatively stable for cataract. In Sweden, data are available only for two years, 2010 and<lb/> 2011. They suggest reductions in median waiting time of patients on the list for hip and knee replacement,<lb/> and cataract surgery by 11-14%.<lb/> Figure 3.a.

Conclusions<lb/> 50.<lb/> The analysis provides new comparative evidence on waiting times across OECD countries.<lb/> Waiting times appear to be low in the Netherlands and Denmark. The United Kingdom (in particular<lb/> England), Finland and the Netherlands have witnessed large reductions in waiting times</table>

			<p>in the last decade<lb/> which can be attributed to a range of policy initiatives, including higher spending, waiting-times target<lb/> schemes, and incentive mechanisms which reward higher levels of activity.<lb/> 51.<lb/> The negative trend in waiting times seems however to have been halted and reverted in some<lb/> countries in recent years. These increases have been most pronounced for Portugal in 2011 and 2012 for<lb/> most procedures. The UK (England and Scotland) has also experienced increases in most procedures albeit<lb/> to a lesser extent than Portugal. There were increases in waiting times in Spain – particularly in 2012 – for<lb/> cataract, prostatectomy and hip replacement while Finland has also had increases in waiting times for<lb/> CABG, hernia and knee replacement in the latest available years.<lb/> 52.<lb/> Policymakers have at their disposal a range of measures to collect waiting times. The study<lb/> emphasizes the presence of systematic differences across different waiting time measures, in particular<lb/> between the distribution of waiting times of patients treated versus the distribution of patients on the list.<lb/> For example, the mean waiting time of patients on the list is generally higher than of patients treated<lb/> although we can find examples of the opposite (and similarly for other measures such as the proportion<lb/> waiting over a certain time threshold, e.g. six months). Mean waiting times are systematically higher than<lb/> median waiting times due to a skewed distribution and this difference can be quantitatively large in some<lb/> countries.<lb/></p>

			<head>APPENDIX<lb/> SECTION A1. DEFINITIONS<lb/></head>

			<figure>Measure 1: Inpatient waiting time of patients treated (publicly funded patients) and distribution of<lb/> waiting time by main surgical procedures<lb/></figure>

			<p>Inpatient waiting times at admission for treatment includes &quot; the time elapsed for a patient on the non-<lb/>emergency (elective) surgery waiting list from the date they were added to the waiting list for the<lb/> procedure (following specialist assessment) to the date they were admitted to an inpatient or day-case<lb/> surgical unit for the procedure to be carried out &quot; .<lb/> This definition of waiting time does NOT include &apos;the time elapsed from the date of referral of the<lb/> general practitioner to the date of specialist assessment&apos; (in some countries referred to as &apos;outpatient<lb/> waiting time&apos;).<lb/></p>

			<p>Inpatient waiting times are requested for 11 main surgical procedures (Cataract surgery, Percutaneous<lb/> transluminal coronary angioplasty, Coronary bypass, Cholecystectomy, Inguinal and femorial hernia,<lb/> Prostatectomy, Vaginal hysterectomy, Knee arthroscopy, Total and partial hip replacement, Knee<lb/> replacement, Ligation and stripping of varicose veins). To classify the surgical procedures, we follow the<lb/> international classification system ICD-9-CM. If you are not able to provide the data according to the ICD-<lb/>9-CM format, please specify which classification (national or international) you have used and, if possible,<lb/> provide cross-classification (codes of your national system and corresponding codes to ICD-9-CM).<lb/></p>

			<p>The inpatient waiting times should refer to all &apos;publicly funded patients&apos;. More precisely, the inpatient<lb/> waiting times refers to all &apos;publicly funded patients&apos; that received the treatment either by publicly or<lb/> privately (non-profit and for-profit) owned providers.<lb/></p>

			<p>Publicly funded patients include &quot; the patients whose expenditure is incurred by public funds (OECD<lb/> Health data definition, 2010). Public funds are state, regional and local Government bodies (included are<lb/> non-market, non-profit institutions that are controlled and mainly financed by government units) and social<lb/> security schemes. (Social security funds are social insurance programmes covering the community as a<lb/> whole or large sections of the community that are imposed and controlled by a government unit. They<lb/> generally involve compulsory contributions by employees or employers or both, and the terms on which<lb/> benefits are paid to recipients are determined by a government unit). Note that in some countries &apos;publicly<lb/> funded patients&apos; may receive the treatment also in private (non-profit or for-profit) institutions. &quot;<lb/></p>

			<p>Privately funded patients include &quot; the patients whose treatments are funded by private sources<lb/> including out-of-pocket payments, private insurance programmes, charities and occupational health care.<lb/> Expenditure on health incurred by private insurance funds includes both private social insurance and all<lb/> other private insurance funds &quot; .<lb/> The waiting times figures should cover the largest share of patients in the country, ideally the whole<lb/> population of publicly funded patients.<lb/></p>

			<figure>Measure 2: Total waiting times of patients treated (publicly-funded patients) and distribution of<lb/> total waiting time<lb/></figure>

			<p>We are interested in the measurement of total waiting times and distribution of total waiting time for<lb/> publicly funded patients, comprising both &apos;inpatient waiting time at admission&apos; and &apos;outpatient waiting<lb/> time&apos;:<lb/></p>

			<head>• Inpatient waiting times at admission for treatment includes</head>

			<p>&quot; the time elapsed for a patient on<lb/> the non-emergency (elective) surgery waiting list from the date they were added to the waiting<lb/> list for the procedure (after specialist assessment) to the date they were admitted to an inpatient or<lb/> day-case surgical unit for the procedure &quot; .<lb/></p>

			<figure>• Outpatient waiting times includes &quot; the time elapsed from the Family Doctor (General<lb/> Practitioner) referral to the specialist visit &quot; .<lb/> • Total waiting times (inpatient + outpatient waiting times) therefore includes &quot; the time elapsed<lb/> from the Family Doctor (General Practitioner) referral to the date patients added on the non-<lb/>emergency (elective) surgery waiting list were admitted to an inpatient or day-case surgical unit<lb/> for the procedure &quot; .<lb/> Measure 3: Inpatient waiting time of patients on the list (publicly funded patients) and distribution<lb/> of waiting time by main surgical procedures<lb/></figure>

			<p>This measure refers to the patients on the list at a given census date (as opposed to the patients treated<lb/> in a given year). Ideally the census date is the 1 st July (or any census date which is closest to this,<lb/> depending on data availability).<lb/> Inpatient waiting times on the list includes &quot; the time elapsed for a patient on the non-emergency<lb/> (elective) surgery waiting list from the date they were added to the waiting list for the procedure (following<lb/> specialist assessment) to a designated census date &quot; .<lb/></p>

This data is published in an annual CIHI wait times report. Each annual report can<lb/> be found at the following link: https://secure.cihi.ca/estore/productSeries.htm?pc=PCC395. These data are<lb/> also presented in a new wait time reporting system which can be found at the following link:<lb/> http://waittimes.cihi.ca/. The reports have been published for the past 7 years. However, Provinces began<lb/> submitting according to a standard definition in 2008 (4 years ago). Provinces submit data for wait times<lb/> for hip replacements, knee replacements, Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG), cataract surgery,<lb/> radiation therapy, MRI and CT scans. This data is from provincial registries or chart audits. Some<lb/> provinces such as Prince Edward Island and Newfoundland and Labrador do not have registries. The<lb/> reference period for the data is April 1st through September 30th of each year or the nearest 6 month proxy<lb/> for provinces unable to produce data for the reference period.<lb/> Coverage: Data coverage includes most provincial institutions or outpatient clinics where procedures<lb/> are performed. Population inclusions and exclusions are noted below for each procedure. CIHI calculates<lb/> provincial volumes for each procedure and cross-checks with volumes provided by provinces to ensure<lb/> coverage matches definitions agreed to.<lb/> Deviation from the definition: Data supplied is for the wait times for procedure from &apos;the booking<lb/> date of surgery to date of procedure.&apos; The booking date will be after assessment by a specialist but may<lb/> have a time lapse between this appointment (or the decision to treat) and the booking date. Provinces are<lb/> working towards reducing the time between &quot;ready to treat&quot; and &quot;booking date&quot; through system<lb/> efficiencies.<lb/> Estimation: The median waiting time is an estimation of weighted median for all procedures. The 10<lb/> provinces provide CIHI with summary level data and volumes. Using the volumes and summary level data<lb/> we calculate an &quot;all Canada&quot; median wait for hips, knees, CABG, cataracts, and radiation. Waiting times<lb/> are based on the ICD-10-CA/CCI Classification system. The codes are based on inclusions and exclusions<lb/> to the procedure definitions.

			<p>Estimation: This analysis is using SMR01 data so that procedure level analysis can be provided.<lb/> Waiting times analysis from SMR01 cannot be adjusted for self-deferrals or periods of medical /social<lb/> unavailability.

			<p>Estimation: We do not know the exact waiting times for any patient, and we therefore only give an<lb/> estimated number for the median, as we cannot compute either the mean or the median exactly. Mean<lb/> waiting time cannot be calculated. In Sweden waiting times are presented in intervals, in the sense that we<lb/> only know which of the intervals 0-30, 31-60, 61-90, 91-120, 121-180, 181-365 and 365-infinity a data<lb/> point belongs to. We do not know how many days each patient has been waiting and because of that we<lb/> cannot calculate mean waiting time. Estimation of the median waiting time. From the binned data we can<lb/> compute which interval the median belongs to, and we attempt to estimate if the median is in the lower,<lb/> middle, or upper part of the interval, which allows us to arrive at a number for the estimated median. We<lb/> do not have a well-defined procedure for the estimation of the median within the interval, and we have not<lb/> attempted to estimate the expected error in our procedure. The point in the interval at which the median lies<lb/> has been estimated on the assumption that waiting times are normally distributed within the interval.<lb/> The estimation of the median waiting time was done as follows:<lb/></p>

			<p>• The total number of patients waiting was divided by two. We thereafter identified in which<lb/> waiting-time interval the middle patient (the median) occurs.<lb/> • To get an estimation of the median waiting time we have put that number in relation to the ranges<lb/> around.<lb/></p>

			<p>• The following ICD-9-CM codes are used:<lb/></p>

			<figure>Cataract surgery:13.1-13.7 &amp; 13.90; Coronary bypass:36.1; Total and partial hip replacement<lb/> (includes the revision of hip replacement): 81.51-81.53; Knee replacement (includes the revision of knee<lb/> replacement): 81.54-81.55.<lb/></figure>
