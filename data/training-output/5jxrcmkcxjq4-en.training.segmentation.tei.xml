			<body>KEY MESSAGES <lb/>• It is estimated that 16 % of the working age population in the EU has some form of permanent or temporary disability, <lb/>and the number of people with some form of disability is likely to increase as the population ages.<lb/>• Disabilities vary widely in type, severity, stability, duration and time of onset. These characteristics influence individual <lb/>capacities and willingness to become entrepreneurs and to sustain such a status. Self-employment is appropriate for <lb/>many in this population because it can provide more flexibility than paid employment in terms of workload, work schedule <lb/>and work location, which can allow for better management of disability and lifestyle.<lb/>• Efforts are needed to increase awareness about the desirability and feasibility of entrepreneurship by people experiencing <lb/>disabilities, both among disabled and non-disabled populations.<lb/>• There is some evidence that targeted entrepreneurship training and start-up support programmes can be effective for <lb/>disabled people, but they are expensive to deliver and the size of the target group will not always justify separate provision.<lb/>• There is strong potential to adapt existing training and start-up programmes to the needs of the disabled. Business advisors <lb/>should be ready to recommend self-employment as a career option to the disabled, longer support should be available <lb/>if necessary, adapted formats (such as Braille) should be used, and language should be adapted to the realities of the <lb/>clients. Partnerships between business support organisations and specialist disabled support organisations can also help.<lb/>• The benefits trap problem should be addressed by ensuring that the welfare system does not cut benefits too quickly on <lb/>transition to entrepreneurship or discriminate unfairly against those disabled people who chose to become entrepreneurs.<lb/>• The use of assistive technologies and improvements in IT and Internet accessibility for disabled business users should be <lb/>encouraged. The use of assistive technologies for entrepreneurs (brain–computer interfaces, computer readers for blind <lb/>people, etc.) can be favoured through grants, loans and training in their use. The integration of technological interfaces <lb/>for disabled people in key accounting, taxation and other business management software can be encouraged. Better <lb/>interfaces for disabled people on Internet websites are also needed, starting with improvements in accessibility of online <lb/>government services, such as business registration and tax filing, and promotion of standards for the development of <lb/>private websites that are friendly to disabled people.<lb/>DISABILITY IN THE EUROPEAN UNION <lb/>Disability impacts a large number of people – approximately <lb/>16 % of the working age population in the EU is afflicted <lb/>with a long-standing health problem or disability (European <lb/>Commission, 2007). And this number will grow as the popu-<lb/>lation ages in industrialised countries due to the associated <lb/>increased susceptibility to mental and physical disorders (Lutz <lb/>et al., 2011; Pascarelli et al., 2001). Disabilities are extremely <lb/>diverse and are not a fixed characteristic of individuals. Many <lb/>disabilities are invisible to the eye yet popular stereotypes of <lb/>disabled people as permanent wheelchair users or as blind <lb/>from birth persist. <lb/>Disability affects a wide range of socioeconomic outcomes, <lb/>including labour market participation. People with disabilities <lb/>face many barriers in the labour market and disability is con-<lb/>sistently found to have a negative effect on labour market <lb/>outcomes, including employment rates and earnings (Jones, <lb/>2008; Berthoud, 2008; Meager and Higgins, 2011; Lechner <lb/>and Vazquez-Alvarez, 2011). Variations in disability (i.e. type, <lb/>severity, quantity) influence labour market participation rates, <lb/>types of occupation and earnings (Jones, 2008, 2011; Berthoud, <lb/>2008; Meager and Higgins, 2011). Locomotor impairments <lb/>exert a substantial negative impact on employment prospects <lb/>(Berthoud, 2008) as does mental health challenges and learning <lb/>difficulties (Berthoud, 2008; Meager and Higgins, 2011). <lb/>Employer discrimination is a strong influence on the supply of <lb/>jobs for disabled people (Meager and Higgins, 2011), although <lb/>employer perceptions about individuals&apos; capacity to work may <lb/>diverge considerably from their actual capacity to work. <lb/>The risk of poverty in the EU is significantly higher for disabled <lb/>people than for people without disabilities – 21.1 % of disabled <lb/>people face that risk, compared to 14.9 % of people without <lb/>disabilities (Hauben et al., 2012). The main reason for this dis-<lb/>parity can be found in the low employment rates of disabled <lb/>people, which are a cause for and/or a consequence of their <lb/>social exclusion (Greve, 2009; Hauben et al., 2012). <lb/>The European Union has taken a strong position to support <lb/>the active participation of people with disabilities in society <lb/>and the economy. This is evident in the Europe 2020 Strategy <lb/>(http://ec.europa.eu/europe2020/index_en.htm), which aims to <lb/>create smart, sustainable and inclusive growth to build a soci-<lb/>ety that includes everyone. In addition, the EU has developed <lb/>a disability strategy (European Commission, 2010), which <lb/>outlines actions to address specific barriers to full participa-<lb/>tion in society for people with disabilities (see Box 1 for more <lb/>information). <lb/></body>

			<page>4 <lb/></page>

			<body>Box 1 European Disability Strategy 2010–20 <lb/>The EU and its Member States have been given a strong mandate to address the social and economic situation of people <lb/>with disabilities by several charters, treaties and conventions, including: <lb/>• The Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union (http://www.europarl.europa.eu/charter/pdf/text_en.pdf), which <lb/>states the need to respect and protect human dignity, ensure the integration of people with disabilities in the community <lb/>(Article 26) and prohibit discrimination on the basis of disability (Article 21);<lb/>• The Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:12012E/ <lb/>TXT), which requires the Union to fight discrimination based on disability when drafting and implementing policies and <lb/>adopting legislation (Articles 10 and 19); and<lb/>• The United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (http://www.un.org/disabilities/convention/con-<lb/>ventionfull.shtml), which is a legally binding instrument that protects and safeguards human rights and fundamental <lb/>freedoms of persons with disabilities.<lb/>Following this mandate, the EU developed this strategy to empower people with disabilities to enjoy full rights and benefits <lb/>from participating in society. The strategy focuses on eliminating barriers for people with disabilities in eight action areas: <lb/>Accessibility, Participation, Equality, Employment, Education and training, Social protection, Health, and External action <lb/>(i.e. actions outside of the EU). To reduce barriers in these areas, a four-pronged strategy has been developed to raise <lb/>awareness; provide financial resources to support and research programmes; improve data collection and monitoring; and <lb/>implement the UN-required governance mechanisms across the Commission and with Member States. <lb/>Entrepreneurship is indirectly supported by this strategy through the reduction of barriers under the &apos;Participation&apos; and <lb/>&apos;Employment&apos; themes. <lb/>For more information, please refer to: http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=COM:2010:0636:FIN:EN:PDF <lb/>DEFINING DISABILITY <lb/>Definitions of disability are shaped by two contrasting concepts: <lb/>the medical model of disability and the social model of dis-<lb/>ability. In short, the medical model treats disability as a char-<lb/>acteristic of the person and restrictions in activity are explained <lb/>in terms of individuals&apos; bodily capabilities, with impairments <lb/>treated implicitly as a form of negative human capital. In con-<lb/>trast, the social model of disability, pioneered by Oliver (1990) <lb/>assumes that people with impairments are disabled by societal <lb/>attitudes, institutions and environmental barriers rather than <lb/>individual characteristics. This model distinguishes &apos;impair-<lb/>ment&apos; (i.e. a limitation of the mind and body) from &apos;disability&apos; <lb/>(i.e. social exclusion) (Shakespeare, 2006). These distinctions are <lb/>important because they influence the definition of &apos;disabled&apos; in <lb/>different contexts, especially within the context of eligibility for <lb/>support in public support and active labour market programmes. <lb/>There is no single definition of disability. The World Health <lb/>Organisation (WHO) International Classification of Functioning, <lb/>Disability and Health (http://www.who.int/classifications/icf/en <lb/>and http://www.who.int/classifications/icf/training/icfbeginners-<lb/>guide.pdf) defines &apos;disabilities&apos; as an umbrella term referring to <lb/>impairments, activity limitations, and participation restrictions: <lb/>• An impairment is a problem in body function or structure, <lb/>including physical impairments (e.g. dysfunction of the mus-<lb/>culoskeletal, neurological, cardiac, circulatory and respiratory <lb/>body systems); mental illness or disorder (e.g. schizophrenia, <lb/>neuroses and psychotic conditions, anxiety and emotional<lb/>disorders, phobias, depression); cognitive impairments <lb/>(e.g. brain injuries, dementia); sensory impairments (e.g. sight <lb/>loss or blindness); and intellectual or developmental impair-<lb/>ments (e.g. below average general intellectual function). <lb/>• An activity limitation is a difficulty encountered by an indi-<lb/>vidual in executing a task or action.<lb/>• A participation restriction is a problem experienced by an <lb/>individual in involvement in life situations.<lb/>Impairments, limitations and restrictions vary in terms of <lb/>numerous characteristics, i.e. type, severity, stability, duration <lb/>and time of onset. They may be stable, constituting a per-<lb/>manent condition, be slowly degenerative or impose episodic, <lb/>fluctuating or recurring restrictions on activities (Boyd, 2012). <lb/>Longitudinal survey panel data from the United Kingdom sug-<lb/>gests that the status of being &apos;disabled&apos; is, for most, a tempo-<lb/>rary one (Burchardt, 2000). The long-term disabled constitute <lb/>a relatively small proportion of working age people who experi-<lb/>ence disability; 27 % of those who reported a disability in the <lb/>UK indicated that they were impacted by the disability for seven <lb/>consecutive years (the length of the study) (Burchardt, 2000). <lb/>Individuals may suffer from multiple conditions or impairments. <lb/>The onset of impairments also varies between individuals. <lb/>Some are born with an impairment while others acquire them <lb/>during childhood or adult life as a consequence of accident, ill <lb/></body>

			<body>health or ageing. Impairment might occur suddenly or entail <lb/>a gradual deterioration in health over time. Evidence from the <lb/>UK indicates that only 11 % of the disabled adult population <lb/>is born with their disability, 12 % acquire it in childhood, and <lb/>75 % become disabled during their working life (Burchardt, <lb/>2003). This highlights that no two experiences of disability <lb/>are the same; nor are disabled people equally disadvantaged <lb/>in the labour market. <lb/>Disability is therefore a complex phenomenon involving inter-<lb/>action between a person&apos;s body and the society in which they <lb/>live. Diversity in impairment and disability should discourage <lb/>the use of a simple binary division between &apos;the disabled&apos; and <lb/>&apos;the non-disabled&apos; for two reasons. First, the two populations <lb/>are fluid rather than fixed. A significant proportion of people <lb/>are affected by disability at some point during their working <lb/>lives. Second, disabled people are a highly differentiated group, <lb/>varying not only in terms of impairment characteristics but <lb/>also in terms of other personal and household characteristics <lb/>(i.e. gender, ethnicity, age, education, family structure) and <lb/>socioeconomic circumstances that influence labour market <lb/>participation rates (e.g. educational attainment). <lb/>SELF-EMPLOYMENT ACTIVITIES OF PEOPLE <lb/>WITH DISABILITIES <lb/>Data on labour market activities of people with disabilities are <lb/>limited. Available data are quite dated and comparability across <lb/>Member States can be problematic due to the different defini-<lb/>tions of disability used in different labour force surveys (Greve, <lb/>2009). Nonetheless, the available data suggest that people <lb/>with disabilities are more likely to be unemployed or inactive <lb/>(Pagán, 2009; Greve, 2009; Applica/CESEP/European Centre, <lb/>2007). Those who are working are often employed in low-<lb/>skilled, low-paying occupations (Meager and Higgins, 2011). <lb/>Data from the European Union Statistics on Income and Living <lb/>Conditions (EU-SILC) suggest that across the EU, people with <lb/>disabilities are as likely as those without disabilities to be self-<lb/>employed. However, people with disabilities are more likely <lb/>to be inactive in the labour market. Between 22 % (Austria) <lb/>and 78 % (Poland) of the population with identified disabilities <lb/>are not active in the labour market (Applica/CESEP/European <lb/>Centre, 2007). This variation can be explained by several fac-<lb/>tors, including the generosity of disability benefits and the <lb/>ease of accessing them, the extent to which people with dis-<lb/>abilities are included or excluded from society and education, <lb/>employer discrimination, demographic factors and the incidence <lb/>of severe disabilities. <lb/>There is large variation in self-employment rates of people <lb/>with disabilities across Member States. The self-employment <lb/>rates of people with disabilities are relatively low in many <lb/>north-eastern EU countries and higher in southern EU countries <lb/>(see Figure 1). For example, the self-employment rates for peo-<lb/>ple with disabilities in Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Denmark, <lb/>Germany, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Slovenia and Slovakia were <lb/>below the 5 % level in 2007, while the rates exceed the 15 % <lb/>level in Greece, Italy, Cyprus, Poland, Portugal and Romania. <lb/>Caution is needed in interpreting these data because the differ-<lb/>ences in self-employment rates across countries are influenced <lb/>by a number of factors, including variation in the definition of <lb/>disability used in collecting the statistics. <lb/>However, these data are largely consistent with many studies <lb/>that measure self-employment rates across a small number of <lb/>countries and for specific disabilities (e.g. Blanck et al., 2000; <lb/>Boylan and Burchardt, 2002; Meager and Higgins, 2011). For <lb/>example, a study of 13 EU Member States using the European <lb/>Community Household Panel data for the period 1995–2001 <lb/>found that self-employment rates among disabled people were <lb/>higher than among people without disabilities (Pagán, 2009). <lb/>This study found that the self-employment rates for people <lb/>with a disability varied across countries and by gender. Men <lb/>with disabilities were 10.5 percentage points (p.p.) more likely <lb/>to be self-employed in Greece than those without disabili-<lb/>ties, 8.6 p.p. more likely in Portugal and 8.1 p.p. more likely in <lb/>Ireland. In Germany, Denmark and the Netherlands the rates <lb/>were the same for disabled and non-disabled men. The male <lb/>non-disabled self-employment rate was higher than the male <lb/>disabled self-employment rate (3.0 p.p. higher) only in Belgium. <lb/>For females, those with disabilities were 13.5 p.p. more likely <lb/>to be self-employed in Greece, 10.3 p.p. more likely in Portugal <lb/>and 8.2 p.p. more likely in Austria. There was no difference in <lb/>self-employment rates for women with and without disabilities <lb/>in Belgium, Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands and Finland. <lb/></body>

For exam-<lb/>ple, self-employment rates were higher among people who <lb/>were severely limited in their daily activities than among those <lb/>reporting some or no limitation in daily activities (Pagán, 2009; <lb/>Jones, 2011). There is some evidence from the UK to sug-<lb/>gest that men and women with musculoskeletal problems, and <lb/>women with mental health problems, are particularly likely to <lb/>be self-employed, while men with sensory impairments are <lb/>relatively unlikely to be self-employed (Boylan and Burchardt, <lb/>2002). Data from the UK also suggest that disabled entre-<lb/>preneurs are more likely to work alone, rather than employ <lb/>others. Nearly 80 % of the self-employed with disabilities have <lb/>no employees compared to 74 % of those without disabilities <lb/>and non-work-limited disabled men (Jones and Latreille, 2011). <lb/>Moreover, people with disabilities are more likely to operate as <lb/>a home-based business (East Midlands Development Agency – <lb/>EMDA, 2009). <lb/>THE BENEFITS OF ENTREPRENEURSHIP FOR PEOPLE <lb/>WITH DISABILITIES <lb/></body>

			<note place="footnote">People can be attracted to self-employment for any number of <lb/>reasons. While some enter self-employment out of necessity, <lb/>many seek to take advantage of an opportunity, gain independ-<lb/>ence and autonomy, improve their work–life balance, increase <lb/>their satisfaction for work activities and attempt to increase <lb/>their income and other material benefits. <lb/>While these reasons may also be a significant influence for <lb/>entrepreneurs with disabilities, they are also likely motivated <lb/>by different factors. One of the greatest benefits is that <lb/>self-employment provides an entry into the labour market <lb/>as employer discrimination is frequently reported (Blanck et <lb/>al., 2000; Boylan and Burchardt, 2002; Hagner and Davis, <lb/>2002; EMDA, 2009). Employer discrimination is often high-<lb/>est for those impairments or limitations that are subject to <lb/>greater prejudice by employers such as those with mental <lb/>and physical disabilities (Pagán, 2009). For these people, <lb/>self-employment might offer the only opportunity for active <lb/>labour market participation and with it, improved income and <lb/>living standard. <lb/></note>

			<page>7 <lb/></page>

			<body>Another important advantage of self-employment for those with <lb/>disabilities is that it provides a better adjustment between disabil-<lb/>ity status and working life through more flexibility in work pacing, <lb/>hours worked and location of work (Prescott-Clarke, 1990; Callahan <lb/>et al., 2002; Doyel, 2002; Pagán, 2009; Jones and Latreille, 2011; <lb/>Meager and Higgins, 2011). Thus, self-employment can provide a <lb/>sense of self-empowerment because entrepreneurship can provide <lb/>a person with the opportunity to take control of their disability <lb/>and labour market participation, and be socially and economically <lb/>active to the extent possible for their situation. <lb/>Inspiring entrepreneurs: Veronica Hedenmark, Sweden <lb/>Veronica Hedenmark is an entrepreneur from Gothenburg, Sweden. She has founded three companies, VH Assistants, <lb/>VH Action and VH Kids, which all specialise in providing personal assistance for children, youth and adults with disabilities. <lb/>Veronica was born with Osteogenesis Imperfecta, which is a congenital bone disorder characterised by brittle bones. By the <lb/>time that she had turned 9 years old, she had already suffered 152 bone fractures. Despite her condition, Veronica had a <lb/>very social upbringing and enjoyed attending public school. However, upon graduating from high school, Veronica watched <lb/>all of her friends move away to attend university or to work in foreign countries as au pairs. She was left behind, unsure <lb/>of how to take the next step in her life. Veronica was left confused and insulted when the Social Insurance Office offered <lb/>her an early retirement pension, implying that she would never be able to work. Rather than accepting it, she became more <lb/>determined to remain an active participant in society. Her boyfriend helped her understand the difference between having <lb/>a disability and being disabled, and this changed her perspective and outlook on life. The immediate result was a desire to <lb/>start and build a company. <lb/>In 1996 she founded VH Assistants to help and inspire others that had disabilities. With the success of this company, she <lb/>subsequently founded VH Action and VH Kids to expand the scale and scope of her work. Today the companies have more <lb/>than 600 employees across Sweden. <lb/>In addition to running successful businesses, Veronica is a successful advocate for people with disabilities and is a sought-<lb/>after speaker. In 2008 she was appointed ambassadress of the Swedish Minister for Enterprise and was a finalist for the <lb/>Göranpriset Prize. She won the Compass Rose in 2009, the King&apos;s award for young leaders and was named by Business <lb/>World magazine as one of the 100 Most Powerful leaders under the age of 40. <lb/>Inspiring entrepreneurs: Alan Broadbent, Spain <lb/></body>

			<note place="footnote">Mr Broadbent lives in Barcelona, Spain and operates a successful business that provides travel-related services for people <lb/>with disabilities. Mr Broadbent was diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis in 2000 and has a disability rating of 40 % (Government <lb/>of Catalunya). Multiple sclerosis is an inflammatory disease in which the covers of nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord <lb/>are damaged, disrupting communication within the nervous system. This can impact an individual&apos;s mobility and could also <lb/>result in mental and psychiatric problems. As he and his family adjusted to this condition, Alan founded his company in <lb/>2004 as a result of the challenges that he now faced pursuing his love of travel. The company&apos;s primary service is to provide <lb/>wheelchair-and scooter-accessible airport and cruise port transfers in Barcelona, Girona and Reus. <lb/>His travel company also provides wheelchair excursions for Mediterranean cruise ship passengers. The company partners <lb/>with major cruise lines to offer cruise passengers with mobility challenges the opportunity to enjoy shore excursions in <lb/>modern fully adapted accessible vehicles with English speaking driver/guides. Personal tour guides are also available for <lb/>major tour sites and museums. Alan has also written a book, Barcelona, a Wheelchair Users Guide. <lb/>In addition to running his businesses, Mr. Broadbent is an active advocate for people with disabilities and is a renowned <lb/>international speaker. He is one of the founders of the Global Network for Entrepreneurs with Disabilities, which acts as a <lb/>support network and information source (http://entrepreneurswithdisabilities.org). <lb/></note>

			<body>THE CHALLENGES FACED BY PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES <lb/>WHEN STARTING A BUSINESS <lb/></body>

			<note place="footnote">In addition to facing the general challenges to business start-<lb/>up that all entrepreneurs face, entrepreneurs with disabilities <lb/>are likely to face specific barriers to entering and sustaining <lb/>entrepreneurship activities. Some of these barriers, arguably, <lb/>are very deep-rooted social-structural constraints that impose <lb/>severe limits on life chances for certain groups of disabled <lb/>people. These barriers include: <lb/>• Lack of confidence and limited aspirations – people with <lb/>disabilities may have difficulty identifying a business oppor-<lb/>tunity, developing this business idea and engaging with the <lb/>available support infrastructure in a meaningful way, which <lb/>contributes to low levels of confidence related to business <lb/>start-up (Enabled4Enterprise, 2008; EMDA, 2009). This is <lb/>further compounded by the unsupportive role of family and <lb/>friends who often discourage start-up. This challenge is <lb/>especially relevant for those with mental health challenges.<lb/></note>

			<body>• The benefits trap – surveys indicate that there is often a fear <lb/>of losing the security of regular benefit income when other <lb/>income is generated (Boylan and Burchardt, 2002; Doyel, <lb/>2002; EMDA, 2009). Awareness of eligibility for benefits is <lb/>incomplete among the population of people with disabilities <lb/>and contributes to perceptions of self-employment as &apos;risky&apos;.<lb/>• Lack of relevant business knowledge and skills – people with <lb/>disabilities often lack specialist business management, legal <lb/>and financial skills and knowledge due to limited relevant <lb/>education and employment experience (Enabled4Enterprise, <lb/>2008).<lb/>• Access to start-up capital – people with disabilities often <lb/>experience difficulties financing new start-ups due to lim-<lb/>ited personal financial resources (savings, home ownership), <lb/>which, in turn, are partly due to poor education and the con-<lb/>centration of disabled employees in low-paid occupations; <lb/>poor credit rating after long-term benefit receipt; disinterest/ <lb/>discrimination on the part of banks; lack of accessible infor-<lb/>mation on sources of grants and loans (Boylan and Burchardt, <lb/>2002; EMDA, 2009).<lb/>• Consumer discrimination – self-employment can be deterred <lb/>by customer discrimination, reducing the demand for goods <lb/>and services produced, as well as the rewards to self-employ-<lb/>ment (Boylan and Burchardt, 2002; Jones and Latreille, <lb/>2011).<lb/>• Increased labour costs – some entrepreneurs with disabilities <lb/>need to hire assistants to help them undertake tasks that <lb/>many people without disabilities may be able to do on their <lb/>own (e.g. moving merchandise, inputting data into computer <lb/>software), which increases their labour costs and puts them <lb/>at a competitive disadvantage (Roni, 2009).<lb/>• Lack of appropriate business support services – this barrier <lb/>has a number of dimensions due to the individual nature <lb/>that disabilities have (Boylan and Burchardt, 2002; Doyel, <lb/>2002; Pavey, 2006; Enabled4Enterprise, 2008; EMDA, 2009). <lb/>First, business advisers are often reluctant to recommend <lb/>self-employment as a career option for disabled people and <lb/>sometimes actively attempt to dissuade them. Such views <lb/>might be a consequence of advisers&apos; inadequate or stereo-<lb/>typical understandings of the activity restrictions arising <lb/>from specific conditions and/or misperceptions of support <lb/>recipients&apos; capabilities as well as a genuine regard for the <lb/>risks disabled people face in starting and running businesses.<lb/>Second, and crucially, training is not always tailored to indi-<lb/>vidual needs and therefore of limited value to particular <lb/>programme recipients. For some, support might need to be <lb/>provided over an extended period of time for recipients with <lb/>recurring conditions or particular stresses. There is a percep-<lb/>tion among some support recipients that funders face pres-<lb/>sures to move quickly onto the next case rather than provide <lb/>longer-term support to those assisted (a &apos;tick-box culture&apos;). <lb/>Third, support services may not be available in particular <lb/>formats (e.g. Braille), which makes the support service inac-<lb/>cessible for certain segments of the population of people <lb/>with disabilities. This likely will also impact the awareness <lb/>level of available supports. <lb/>Fourth, premises where support is provided may not be <lb/>accessible for individuals with conditions and impairments <lb/>that impact their mobility. Moreover, this barrier can be <lb/>increased by challenges related to transport to and from <lb/>support centres for those with mobility challenges. <lb/>Fifth, support programmes may use language that is off-<lb/>putting to people with disabilities. For example, entrepreneurs <lb/>who experience disability often have lower growth aspira-<lb/>tions and may not identify with terms such as &apos;entrepreneur&apos; <lb/>because they do not see themselves as exploiting an oppor-<lb/>tunity or being innovative. <lb/>Sixth, the diversity of impairment and disability means that <lb/>some disabled entrepreneurs might not perceive themselves <lb/>as &apos;disabled&apos; and prefer to be supported under mainstream, <lb/>rather than disability-specific, services. <lb/>There is evidence that particular groups of disabled people face <lb/>multiple sources of disadvantage in European labour markets <lb/>(Greve, 2009). Disability is more likely to affect vulnerable <lb/>subgroups within society, for example, the old and the poor <lb/>(World Health Organisation/World Bank, 2011) and people who <lb/>experience disability may face multiple forms of social exclu-<lb/>sion and sources of labour market disadvantage (Berthoud, <lb/></body>

			<page>9 <lb/></page>

			<body>2008). Women, older people and ethnic minority and migrant <lb/>people who experience a disability are likely to face greater <lb/>levels of labour market disadvantage. Disability-related barriers <lb/>to entrepreneurship might, therefore, be compounded by gen-<lb/>der, ethnicity and age barriers as well as deprived socioeco-<lb/>nomic contexts. <lb/>Inspiring entrepreneurs: Yiota Michaelidou, Cyprus <lb/>Yiota Michaelidou is an entrepreneur in Limassol, Cyprus. She operates a baking and confectionery workshop called <lb/>Paradosiakes Dimiourgies that produces traditional Cypriot-baked goods. <lb/>Yiota started her career as a kindergarten teacher but attended night classes in bakery and confectionery for pleasure. <lb/>Soon after starting her career, she had an opportunity to put more time into baking while she was at home raising her two <lb/>children. It was around this time that Yiota began showing symptoms of Stargardt&apos;s Disease, a form of macular retinopa-<lb/>thy, a progressive eye disease that affects central vision. In recent years it has drastically reduced her vision to the point <lb/>where she can only read large print or read with the use of a closed-circuit television. She also uses special magnification <lb/>software to operate her computer. However, this does not impact her mobility greatly, except in unfamiliar environments <lb/>with bright daylight. <lb/>Despite the onset of Startgardt&apos;s Disease, Yiota continued to pursue her love of baking and sought employment at a con-<lb/>fectionery shop. She was successful in finding employment opportunities but never stayed long because she felt mistreated <lb/>due to her disability. This gave her the idea of starting her own business. <lb/>She had a workshop constructed in her parents&apos; house to meet health and safety requirements, as well as her vision needs. <lb/>For example, the stove and mixing bowl have large numbers and are contrasting colours. This new workshop started as a <lb/>trial business, serving two hotels, a kindergarten and a few individuals. At busy periods, Yiota&apos;s mother provided assistance, <lb/>along with other women that worked on an hourly basis. <lb/>Impressed with the start-up operation, a social worker suggested that Yiota attend business and computer training courses <lb/>to help her expand her business. Yiota underwent a needs assessment and participated in small business training for persons <lb/>with disabilities offered by the Ministry of Labour and Social Insurance. One of the first steps that she took in launching her <lb/>business was to apply for a grant so that she can invest in two industrial freezers, allowing her to store large quantities of <lb/>frozen products in order to serve more customers. Yiota continues to grow her business and is working on a cookbook with <lb/>traditional delicacies of Cyprus, for persons with vision impairment. <lb/>FACILITATING ENTREPRENEURSHIP WITH TECHNOLOGY <lb/>Technology can help people with disabilities maintain an active, <lb/>independent lifestyle and to participate fully in society (Sans-<lb/>Bobi et al., 2012). Within this context, these technologies are <lb/>referred to as assistive technologies, which are products that <lb/>increase, maintain, or improve functional capabilities of peo-<lb/>ple with disabilities. These technologies are wide-ranging and <lb/>include, for example, artificial limbs, retina implants and spe-<lb/>cialised computer software. The history of assistive technol-<lb/>ogy dates back to the early 1890s when the first hearing aid <lb/>was patented (Miltimore, 1892). In 1936, the first artificial <lb/>speech synthesizer was developed by H. W. Dudley for Bell <lb/>Laboratories (Green and Blair, 2011). Bell Laboratories also <lb/>developed the first speech recognition system in 1952. In 1975 <lb/>Kurzweil Technology invented the first optical character recog-<lb/>nition (OCR) technology, which allows the translation of written <lb/>text into digital language (Green and Blair, 2011). <lb/>Current research and development related to assistive technol-<lb/>ogies concentrates on, for example, gesture-based input devices <lb/>for interaction with information systems (Vatavu et al., 2009; <lb/>Christiansen et al., 2011), cloud-based assistive technologies <lb/>(e.g. screen readers or screen magnifiers) that allow disabled <lb/>people location-independent access to computer systems (Hill, <lb/>2011; Caldwell, 2011) and brain–computer interfaces that <lb/>allow the operation of computer systems or the control of <lb/>artificial limbs with one&apos;s mind (McCullagh et al., 2010; Wolpaw <lb/>and Wolpaw, 2012; Carmena, 2012). While the first two tech-<lb/>nologies already have been successfully commercialised the <lb/>latter is still to be explored extensively. <lb/>Assistive technologies are evolving at a rapid pace. Although <lb/>they are not directly aimed at supporting entrepreneurship, <lb/>these technologies can help someone in business creation in <lb/>three broad ways. First, improving an individual&apos;s ability to par-<lb/>ticipate in society increases their self-esteem and confidence, <lb/>increasing the likelihood of starting a business (Seelman, 2008). <lb/>Collecting and managing information is critical for full participa-<lb/>tion in today&apos;s society and various assistive technologies enable <lb/>people with different kinds of disabilities to have access to <lb/>computer systems. Blind people can use Braille keyboards or <lb/>touch screens to scan digital information. The latter requires the <lb/>application of screen reader software that is capable of reading <lb/>out loud all of the information displayed on the screen. People <lb/>with physical disabilities, who are not able to operate com-<lb/>puter systems by mouse and keyboard devices, can use wands <lb/>and sticks to simulate keyboard functionalities or trackballs to <lb/></body>

			<page>10 <lb/></page>

			<body>simulate mouse functionalities. Sip-and-puff systems allow <lb/>users to communicate with computer systems by using air pres-<lb/>sure on a straw, tube or wand (Microsoft Accessibility, 2013). A <lb/>promising technology, especially for physically disabled people, <lb/>is the execution of computer actions and commands by speech <lb/>or eye tracking. This allows a more convenient and efficient <lb/>way to scan and gather information for people with certain <lb/>disabilities. Research is continuously evolving these techniques <lb/>to provide more accurate solutions to end users (Paek et al., <lb/>2007; Beelders and Blignaut, 2010). <lb/>Second, assistive technologies can help people with disabilities <lb/>interact with customers and develop relationships with sup-<lb/>pliers, business partners and financers. Communication can <lb/>occur through different channels and the most disseminated <lb/>channels are e-mail, telephone or voicemail, face-to-face con-<lb/>versation, fax and letter (Guffey and Loewy, 2008). Depending <lb/>on one&apos;s disability, an individual will prefer one channel to the <lb/>other. For instance, a physically disabled entrepreneur using a <lb/>wheelchair may prefer e-mail or phone calls over face-to-face <lb/>conversations if they require the disabled entrepreneur to visit <lb/>the business partner in an unknown and possibly inaccessible <lb/>area or building. <lb/>Third, technologies can help entrepreneurs with disabilities to <lb/>manage and control their business processes. In addition to the <lb/>information and communication issues already discussed, the <lb/>achievement of business objectives needs continuous planning <lb/>and monitoring. Much work is still needed in this area because <lb/>many business process management applications or enterprise <lb/>resource planning systems are incompatible with many acces-<lb/>sible technologies (Vaziri and De Oliveira, 2012). <lb/>In addition to assistive technologies, information technolo-<lb/>gies (IT) can facilitate entrepreneurship for people with a dis-<lb/>ability. IT-accessibility became an important topic in the late <lb/>1990s, when the US government amended section 508 of <lb/>the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (Thatcher et al., 2006; Kline, <lb/>2011), which now requires all IT purchased by the US govern-<lb/>ment to comply with specific accessibility standards. This was <lb/>followed by similar action by other governments (Kline, 2011). <lb/>For example, the German government passed an equality act <lb/>in 2002, which summons the public sector to provide only <lb/>accessible websites and software applications (German Federal <lb/>Ministry of Justice, 2007). <lb/>Recent efforts on IT-accessibility focus on the generation and <lb/>acknowledgement of common international standards like Web <lb/>Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0 (WCAG, 2008; Kline, 2011), <lb/>which is a major prerequisite for the operation of many assis-<lb/>tive technologies. Even though EU policies were able to embody <lb/>laws that compel and standards that support public institutions <lb/>to provide IT-accessibility (United Nations, 2008; The National <lb/>Archives, 1995; German Federal Ministry of Justice, 2007; <lb/>WCAG, 2008; Kline, 2011; W3C, 2006), several studies on web <lb/>accessibility in the EU found that very few public sector web-<lb/>sites meet these international standards. For example, a study <lb/>conducted in 2009 tested the conformance level of 102 public <lb/>sector websites and found that none of them met the WCAG <lb/>standard (Cullen et al., 2009). An earlier study conducted by <lb/>the Disability Rights Commission in 2004 investigated 1 000 <lb/>private and public websites and found that 81 % of the inves-<lb/>tigated websites did not fulfil basic accessibility requirements <lb/>(Disability Rights Commission, 2004). These results have a <lb/>major impact on the individual person, information society <lb/>and business organisational perspective for disabled people. <lb/>They illustrate that current IT-accessibility is insufficient and <lb/>thereby does not support the inclusion of people with disabilities <lb/>in online activities. <lb/>Given the prominence of the Internet in today&apos;s society and <lb/>business environment, improving the accessibility of IT remains <lb/>a priority for the industry and government. Computer software <lb/>and the Internet are also increasingly essential for small busi-<lb/>nesses to help entrepreneurs manage tasks such as commu-<lb/>nication, inventory management and accounting. Furthermore, <lb/>many interactions between small businesses and governments <lb/>are now online. For example, in many EU countries business <lb/>registration and the filing of taxes can be completed online. <lb/>Governments and business support agencies also provide a <lb/>wealth of business support services and information through <lb/>online portals. <lb/>POLICY SUPPORT FOR ENTREPRENEURSHIP FOR PEOPLE <lb/>WITH DISABILITIES <lb/>Entrepreneurship can play a role in supporting participation in <lb/>the labour market and society for people with disabilities. While <lb/>entrepreneurship is not for everyone and may not be feasible <lb/>for those with severe or multiple disabilities, it is a feasible <lb/>option for many people with disabilities. <lb/>The approach taken to support labour market participation for <lb/>people with disabilities in the EU tends to favour increasing <lb/>participation through employment rather than self-employment <lb/>or business creation. A common approach in the EU is to use <lb/>employment quotas that require public and private organisa-<lb/>tions to employ a certain number or proportion of people with <lb/>disabilities; however, a number of countries such as Denmark, <lb/>Estonia, Latvia, the Netherlands, Finland, Sweden and the <lb/>United Kingdom do not use this approach (Greve, 2009). <lb/>Recognising the range of disabilities and impairments, there <lb/>are several examples of policy actions that support self-<lb/>employment and business creation for people with disabilities. <lb/>This includes the incorporation of self-employment in general <lb/></body>

			<page>11 <lb/></page>

			<body>active labour market programmes (e.g. Ridley et al., 2005) as <lb/>well as schemes that are dedicated to supporting people with <lb/>disabilities in business creation. The priority areas for policy <lb/>development are discussed below. <lb/>1. Increase awareness about <lb/>the feasibility of entrepreneurship <lb/>Goal <lb/>Relatively high self-employment rates for people with disabili-<lb/>ties in the EU suggest that there is an interest in entrepreneur-<lb/>ship and self-employment among this population. However, this <lb/>number in real terms is quite small because of the large number <lb/>of inactive people. Many people with disabilities are held back <lb/>to due a lack of awareness, lack of emotional support from <lb/>family and friends, low self-confidence and discouragement <lb/>from business advisors. Promoting the feasibility of entrepre-<lb/>neurship for people with disabilities will increase awareness <lb/>of entrepreneurship as a potential labour market activity, not <lb/>only for people with disabilities but also for others who have an <lb/>important role in supporting them. The aim of awareness crea-<lb/>tion should be to increase knowledge of self-employment and <lb/>small business ownership as a career option and the potential <lb/>benefits that it can offer. But it is equally important to increase <lb/>awareness of the challenges and risks that need to be consid-<lb/>ered so that individuals can decide whether it is appropriate <lb/>activity given their circumstances. <lb/>Approach <lb/>Promotion of entrepreneurship activities for people with dis-<lb/>abilities should aim to reach three target groups: people with <lb/>disabilities; their role models and support networks such as <lb/>family and friends; and business advisors. One method of <lb/>increasing awareness of entrepreneurship among people with <lb/>disabilities is to raise the profile of entrepreneurship and self-<lb/>employment in labour market support programmes. Many <lb/>labour market programmes for people with disabilities focus <lb/>exclusively on job placement, often within the public sector, <lb/>and ignore, or even discourage self-employment (Boylan and <lb/>Burchardt, 2002; Doyel, 2002; Pavey, 2006; Enabled4Enterprise, <lb/>2008; EMDA, 2009). It is important to provide enterprise aware-<lb/>ness training for advisers whose responsibilities include sup-<lb/>porting disabled individuals. This should be disability-specific <lb/>training rather than simply generic diversity training. This type <lb/>of training should seek to educate advisers on the possibilities <lb/>self-employment might afford disabled people as a work option <lb/>and must also cover the challenges and risks. In addition, it <lb/>should seek to overcome adviser reluctance to recommend self-<lb/>employment as a viable option. Increasing adviser confidence <lb/>to provide support to disabled entrepreneurs might, indirectly, <lb/>increase the confidence of the target group of entrepreneurs. <lb/>Policymakers can also promote business creation for peo-<lb/>ple with disabilities using role models with disabilities. It is <lb/>important to showcase these inspiring examples for potential <lb/>entrepreneurs with disabilities to demonstrate that business <lb/>creation and self-employment can be achievable. These role <lb/>models should also be included in broader promotional cam-<lb/>paigns related to entrepreneurship and self-employment to <lb/>show that self-employment is not an atypical activity for people <lb/>with disabilities. This is important not only to individuals with <lb/>disabilities but also for addressing negative stereotypes and <lb/>attitudes in society. <lb/>Another approach to increasing awareness is to promote entre-<lb/>preneurship through high profile awards for entrepreneurs with <lb/>disabilities. This provides public recognition for success and in <lb/>some cases financial rewards are provided to support further <lb/>business development. Awards are also an effective method <lb/>of attracting media attention to showcase success stories, <lb/>increase awareness of the potential for entrepreneurship <lb/>among people with disabilities and inspire potential entrepre-<lb/>neurs. An example of award programme is the Stelios Award <lb/>for Disabled Entrepreneurs (United Kingdom) which are admin-<lb/>istered in partnership with Leonard Cheshire Disability charity <lb/>(http://www.stelios.com/entrepreneurship/award-for-disabled-<lb/>entrepreneurs-in-the-uk.html). The awards receive considerable <lb/>media attention and provide financial rewards to help entre-<lb/>preneurs grow their business. The European Commission is also <lb/>active in this area, operating the European Enterprise Promotion <lb/>Awards (see Box 2) and sponsoring the First European Award <lb/>for Social Entrepreneurship and Disability (http://www.csr-d.eu/ <lb/>social-entrepreneurship-and-disability-award). <lb/></body>

			<body>Box 2 European Enterprise Promotion Awards <lb/>Target group: The European Commission, DG Enterprise and Industry operates the European Enterprise Promotion Awards, <lb/>which provide awards to entrepreneurs in six categories and a Jury&apos;s Grand Prize for the entry that is deemed to be the <lb/>most creative and inspiring entrepreneurship initiative in Europe. One of the six categories is for &apos;responsible and inclusive <lb/>entrepreneurship&apos;, which recognises regional or local actions promoting corporate social responsibility and sustainable <lb/>business practices. This includes support for people with disabilities and the 2012 winner of this category was a project <lb/>called &apos;Disabled at Work&apos; that was operated by a group of 16 organisations from Turkey and the Netherlands. It provides <lb/>training and mentoring for people with disabilities that seek to enter the workforce, either as an employee or through self-<lb/>employment. The 2013 winner in the inclusive entrepreneurship category was &apos;Integration of Disabled People&apos; in the Slovak <lb/>Republic, which provides driving training for people with disabilities. <lb/>Intervention type: Awards and recognition programme across the EU. <lb/>Objectives: The objectives of the European Enterprise Promotion Awards are to identify and recognise successful activities <lb/>and initiatives undertaken to promote enterprise and entrepreneurship; showcase and share examples of best entrepre-<lb/>neurship policies and practices; create a greater awareness of the role entrepreneurs play in society; and to encourage and <lb/>inspire potential entrepreneurs. <lb/>Entry requirements: Entries are made to national juries that each represent a Member State. Eligible entities can be national <lb/>organisations, towns, cities, regions and communities as well as public–private partnerships between public authorities and <lb/>entrepreneurs, educational programmes and business organisations. International initiatives are eligible as long as they are <lb/>nominated jointly by all countries involved. <lb/>Description: The competition has two stages. Applicants must first compete at the national level, where each country selects <lb/>two entries to be nominated for the EU competition. From these entries, a shortlist of nominees is chosen by the European jury. <lb/>Nominees for 2013 were selected based on the following criteria: (i) originality and feasibility; (ii) the impact that they have <lb/>on the local economy; (iii) the improvement of local stakeholder relations; and (iv) the transferability of the project to other <lb/>regions in Europe. All nominees from the national and European competitions were invited to attend an awards ceremony. <lb/>To raise awareness about the European Enterprise Awards, the European Commission works in partnership with several <lb/>European umbrella organisations, including the Assembly of European Regions, Committee of the Regions, Eurocities, European <lb/>Association of Economic Development Agencies, Eurochambres and the European Association of Craft, Small and Medium-<lb/>Sized Enterprises. Each organisation promotes the awards and nominees through their networks and communication channels. <lb/>Results achieved: Since the awards started in 2006, nearly 2 400 projects have participated in national competitions for <lb/>a chance to compete in the European Enterprise Promotion Awards. More than 30 projects have won awards and been <lb/>showcased across the EU to inspire others and to spread good practices. Together, nominated projects have created more <lb/>than 10 000 new companies. <lb/>For further information, please refer to: http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/policies/sme/best-practices/european-enterprise-awards <lb/>2. Develop entrepreneurship skills <lb/>Goal <lb/>Many people with disabilities have difficulty accessing educa-<lb/>tion and the labour market and, consequently, many have little <lb/>work experience and very few have experience with entrepre-<lb/>neurship. As a result, few people with disabilities have had the <lb/>opportunity to develop the skill-set needed to successfully start <lb/>and run a business. Supporting the acquisition of entrepreneur-<lb/>ship skills can help overcome this lack of experience. The goal <lb/>of entrepreneurship training for people with a disability is no <lb/>different than it is for the mainstream population – to increase <lb/>awareness of the potential of entrepreneurship, to deliver the <lb/>skills that will increase the chances of successfully starting <lb/>and operating a business and to develop an entrepreneurial <lb/>mind-set. <lb/>Approach <lb/>Policymakers can take two approaches to facilitate the develop-<lb/>ment of entrepreneurial skill-sets for people with disabilities. <lb/>One approach is to provide more support to people with dis-<lb/>abilities in the education system. People with disabilities are <lb/>only half as likely to complete vocational training or higher <lb/>education as people without disabilities and one of the principal <lb/>barriers is the lack, or inaccessibility, of assistive technolo-<lb/>gies which are rehabilitative, adaptive and assistive devices <lb/>that enable disabled people to perform particular tasks (e.g. <lb/>enabling mobility, allowing the use of specific artefacts such <lb/>as furniture and computer keyboards, facilitating communica-<lb/>tions) (Hanafin et al., 2007; Nochajski et al., 1999). Improving <lb/>the availability and accessibility of these technologies is a <lb/>first step to increasing educational attainment that will lead <lb/>to increased skill levels and other individual benefits such as <lb/></body>

			<page>13 <lb/></page>

			<body>higher self-confidence. This can have a positive influence for <lb/>entrepreneurship activities as higher educational attainment <lb/>for people with disabilities leads to better labour market out-<lb/>comes, including self-employment (Zwerling et al., 2002; Christ <lb/>and Stodden, 2005). <lb/>Policymakers can also examine the wide variety of existing <lb/>non-financial supports to ensure that they are accessible for <lb/>people with disabilities. This includes ensuring that the content <lb/>can be accessed in non-standard formats and that programmes <lb/>allow for some flexibility in their delivery. <lb/>Alternatively, tailored programmes for entrepreneurship <lb/>training can be developed such as &apos;Ready to Start&apos; in the <lb/>United Kingdom (see Box 3). This approach can overcome <lb/>the challenge of developing training programmes that <lb/>address the heterogeneity of impairment characteristics <lb/>(type, severity, stability, duration and time of onset). This <lb/>type of intensive, tailored, one-to-one, or small group sup-<lb/>port provision, has demonstrated the most successful out-<lb/>comes (Arnold and Ipsen, 2005; Enabled4Enterprise, 2009a, <lb/>b; EMDA, 2009; Dotson et al., 2013). Tailored approaches <lb/>need to assess individuals&apos; business potential, ensure the <lb/>feasibility of the business idea, address skill and knowledge <lb/>deficiencies with business education, training and technical <lb/>support, support the development of a realistic business plan <lb/>and support adjustments as the business is realised (Arnold <lb/>and Ipsen, 2005). While effective, such tailored approaches <lb/>are highly resource intensive and can therefore be difficult <lb/>to launch. An effective approach to overcome this challenge <lb/>is for policymakers to work with specialised organisations <lb/>who are already active in supporting people with disabilities. <lb/>In addition to leveraging external knowledge and support, <lb/>this will improve outreach to the target clients and allows <lb/>policymakers to benefit from the credibility and experience <lb/>of existing organisations. <lb/>Box 3 Ready to Start, United Kingdom <lb/>Target group: Ready to Start supported people with any form of disability. <lb/>Intervention type: It supported business start-up with skills training and individual business advisory services, matched <lb/>with direct financial support. <lb/>Description: The project operated between 2006 and 2009 and aimed to support 600 participants start businesses. A team <lb/>of regional coordinators recruited clients and developed relationships with partner organisations to gain their support and to <lb/>seek client referrals. Partner organisations provided mentoring and training, as well as one-to-one advice on non-business <lb/>matters including benefits, housing and self-management. Regional coordinators oversaw the support delivery to ensure that <lb/>clients received the full range of support services needed and organised face-to-face and virtual networking events. After <lb/>the project started, direct financial support was added in the form of a small development fund. It aimed to help participants <lb/>purchase equipment, insurance and marketing materials, computer refurbishment and assistive technologies and membership <lb/>of the Federation of Small Businesses or similar trade bodies to provide continuing support and networking opportunities. <lb/>The project was organised and operated by the Leonard Cheshire Disability charity and much of the financial support was <lb/>provide by Barclays Bank. Additional funding and support was provided by the Prince&apos;s Trust and other partner organisa-<lb/>tions such as Action for Blind People and Business Link London were crucial in recruiting and referring clients. These two <lb/>organisations were responsible for recruiting 43 % of the clients. Other partner organisations were important partners for <lb/>delivering training and advisory services, including Destiny, Northern Pintetree Trust and Meganexus. <lb/>Results achieved: The project recruited 1 382 potential entrepreneurs with disabilities and of these, 735 established new <lb/>businesses. Participant surveys indicate that 82 % of clients found the support to be useful, 75 % said they were satisfied with <lb/>programme management and delivery and 93 % stated they wanted it to continue. Participants reported that the develop-<lb/>ment fund was the most useful element of the support, followed by the mentoring offer. Project evaluations estimate that <lb/>the project saved the UK Treasury GBP 3.5 million (approximately EUR 4.3 million) in benefit payments. <lb/>Lessons for other initiatives: The project was successful because it provided intensive support that was tailored to <lb/>individual needs. However, this required a large amount of financial and human resources. The charity was able to lever-<lb/>age a combination of public and private sector funds and strategically partner with complementary organisations to recruit <lb/>participants and deliver the services. The project serves as a good example of how complementary, non-competitive rela-<lb/>tionships across a network of partners can successfully reach clients and deliver a service to a very narrow target base <lb/>across a wide geographic area. <lb/>For more information, please refer to: http://www.leonardcheshire.org/what-we-do/past-projects#.U6fzmRBLoyY <lb/></body>

			<body>3. Support the development, <lb/>acquisition and use of assistive <lb/>technologies <lb/>Goal <lb/>Assistive technology can be life changing for people with dis-<lb/>abilities. They are becoming more sophisticated, increasingly <lb/>portable, less expensive and easier to use, and as result, hold <lb/>greater potential for improving the inclusion of people with <lb/>disabilities in economic activities and in entrepreneurship <lb/>(Angelocci et al., 2008). Policymakers can play a significant role <lb/>in supporting the development of these technologies to ensure <lb/>continual improvement and support people with disabilities in <lb/>acquiring and using these technologies. <lb/>Approach <lb/>Existing European policy currently supports the development <lb/>of assistive technologies for a wide range of applications <lb/>such as, ambient living, accessible transport and accessible <lb/>computer-interaction. To further support technological devel-<lb/>opment in these areas, governments can take two actions. <lb/>First they can continue to support research in these areas <lb/>through research grants and R &amp; D incentives. In particu-<lb/>lar, more incentives could be provided to develop assistive <lb/>technologies that relate to business software and business <lb/>organisational tools. <lb/>Second, actions can be taken to improve standardisation <lb/>in the assistive technology market. Common standards <lb/>are needed to reduce complexity and incompatibility of <lb/>accessible technologies. The implementation of obligatory <lb/>standards has had a positive impact in the United States <lb/>(Stack et al., 2009) and as noted earlier, there is much <lb/>room for improvement in this regard in the EU. To address <lb/>this, the European Commission is supporting a number of <lb/>projects such as Cloud4all (see Box 4), which promotes the <lb/>development of assistive technologies related to informa-<lb/>tion technologies. <lb/>Box 4 Cloud4all <lb/>Intervention type: Cloud4all is a project that aims to advance the development of assistive technologies to allow people <lb/>with disabilities to better use information technologies such as computers and the Internet. <lb/>Objectives: People with disabilities often require assistive technologies to interact with computers and other information <lb/>technologies. One of the challenges faced by people with disabilities is that each time they use a new piece of equipment or <lb/>technology, the assistive technology must be downloaded, installed and configured prior to use. This can be a major barrier <lb/>for disabled people, for example when interacting with a public computer. Cloud4all provides solutions to store assistive <lb/>technologies and user profiles in a cloud for location-independent access (Cloud4all, 2013a). <lb/>Description: Cloud4all is an international project funded by the seventh framework programme (FP7) of the European Union <lb/>that advances the concept of the Global Public Inclusive Infrastructure (GPII) by improving the ability for assistive technolo-<lb/>gies to work across platforms, technologies and applications (Cloud4all, 2013). The GPII is a project of &apos;Raising the Floor&apos;, a <lb/>consortium of academic, industry and non-governmental organisations and individuals. The initiative applies a consortium as <lb/>legal form, composed of 27 members representing various types of public and private organisations from different European <lb/>countries. The project coordinator is Fundosa Technosite S.A. in Spain and it has the following objectives (Cloud4all, 2013): <lb/>• Simple, instant accessibility for all;<lb/>• Access anywhere, from any device;<lb/>• Better connect supply and demand; and<lb/>• Provide an affordable method that offers the diversity of needs.<lb/>Total costs of the project amount to approximately EUR 13.1 million, of which EUR 7.6 million are received from the European <lb/>Commission (European Commission, 2012). <lb/>Results expected: Cloud4all will allow the development of usable and accessible interfaces for people that face challenges <lb/>using information technology products due to disability, literacy or age-related barriers. The development of Cloud4all will <lb/>also have significant impacts for suppliers of assistive technologies and accessible information and communication tech-<lb/>nologies by providing an accessible platform for their products and services (Cloud4all, 2013a). <lb/></body>

			<body>In addition to supporting the development of these technolo-<lb/>gies, policymakers can also support the acquisition and use <lb/>of assistive technologies by entrepreneurs with disabilities. <lb/>This is often done by providing direct financial support, such <lb/>as a grant, that assists in the acquisition of special equip-<lb/>ment and technologies needed when starting a business. One <lb/>example of this approach can be found in Greece where the <lb/>European Social Fund supports a self-employment scheme <lb/>for the vulnerable unemployed, which provides grants to cover <lb/>business start-up costs for unemployed people from vulner-<lb/>able groups. Unemployed people with disabilities are also <lb/>eligible to receive additional grants to cover up to 90 % of <lb/>the cost of adapting their workplace to their disability. For <lb/>more information on this scheme, please refer to OECD/The <lb/>European Commission (2013). <lb/>This approach is also used in Austria. Labour market policy <lb/>related to disability in Austria focuses on vocational training <lb/>and job placement initiative. As part of these employment ini-<lb/>tiatives, the grants are provided by the Federal Social Welfare <lb/>Office to support people with disabilities in obtaining employ-<lb/>ment or entering self-employment (as well as offering incen-<lb/>tives to businesses to hire people with disabilities). The support <lb/>for self-employment includes an ongoing subsidy to address <lb/>disability-related performance constraints. This subsidy covers <lb/>the purchase of machinery, equipment or technologies that <lb/>address workplace (i.e. mobility-related), technical and ergo-<lb/>nomic challenges. It covers a minimum of half of the costs and <lb/>can be accessed on an ongoing basis. <lb/>Policy can also support training so that people with disabilities <lb/>know how to properly use assistive technologies and informa-<lb/>tion and communication technologies so that they can maxim-<lb/>ise participation in society and the labour market. One approach <lb/>is computer training offered by the Latvian Society for the <lb/>Blind (see Box 5). <lb/>Box 5 Latvian Society for the Blind <lb/>Target group: The Latvian Society for the Blind provides training and rehabilitation support for those who are fully or <lb/>partially visually impaired. <lb/>Intervention type: This organisation provides vocational and computer training. <lb/>Objectives: The goals of the society are (i) to cooperate with the Latvian parliament, government, local institutions and <lb/>non-governmental organisations to promote issues and concerns for visually impaired people; (ii) to raise awareness among <lb/>the general public about the causes and consequences of blindness, promoting methods of overcoming challenges to <lb/>achieve success in education, professional career, social and private life; (iii) to provide occupational training, rehabilitation <lb/>and integration into the labour market; and (iv) to provide assistance in obtaining assistive devices such as white canes, <lb/>magnifiers, talking watches, and other technologies. <lb/>Description: The Latvian Society for the Blind Rehabilitation Centre was established in 1993 and works in co-operation <lb/>with the Latvian state employment office to provide rehabilitation services for people with visual impairments. The services <lb/>include mobility training, Braille reading and writing, housekeeping, cooking and more. These are provided in two programmes <lb/>of either 50 or 400 hours, depending on the needs of the individual. This support includes occupational training to help <lb/>participants learn skills that can be used in employment to help them start their own business. There are currently two types <lb/>of training provided, wickerwork and massage. Starting in 1998, the Rehabilitation Centre started providing computer train-<lb/>ing. There are 10 places per course, of which four are reserved for people that are fully blind. The course helps participants <lb/>learn how to use synthesised speech tools, screen magnifiers and other technologies that allow them to use computers. <lb/>Results achieved: To date, 61 visually impaired people have received training in wickerwork and 75 % work as self-employed <lb/>craftspeople. An additional 61 people were trained in massage and nearly all continue to work in this field. <lb/>For more information, please refer to: http://www.lnbrc.lv <lb/></body>

			<body>4. Ensure access to appropriate <lb/>financial support <lb/>Goal <lb/>Access to finance for business start-up is often cited as one <lb/>of the greatest barriers to business start-up and this chal-<lb/>lenge can be even greater for entrepreneurs with disabilities. <lb/>Many potential entrepreneurs with disabilities have little work <lb/>experience and as a result often have low levels of savings <lb/>and collateral. It can also be more difficult for them to obtain <lb/>external financing because they can have difficulty accessing <lb/>information on financing and sources of investment. At the <lb/>same time, they may have a greater need for external financing <lb/>because they may have higher costs during business start-up <lb/>due to a need to purchase technology or equipment related to <lb/>their disability or a need to hire additional help to do tasks that <lb/>many entrepreneurs can do themselves. Public policy should <lb/>aim to ensure that entrepreneurs with disabilities can access <lb/>financing for business creation. In most instances there will not <lb/>be a sufficient base of potential entrepreneurs with disabilities <lb/>to warrant the creation of a specialised micro-finance scheme <lb/>for entrepreneurs with disabilities. Instead, policymakers should <lb/>aim to open up access to mainstream financing schemes to <lb/>entrepreneurs with disabilities. In addition, policymakers should <lb/>also ensure that funding is available to help people with dis-<lb/>abilities acquire and learn to use specialised equipment that <lb/>will facilitate business creation and management. <lb/>Approach <lb/>A good place for policymakers to start when looking to improve <lb/>access to finance for potential entrepreneurs with disabilities <lb/>is to ensure that existing financial supports are accessible and <lb/>available to people with disabilities. This includes ensuring that <lb/>information on sources of financing is available in accessible <lb/>formats and the financing programmes do not discriminate <lb/>based on disability. <lb/>Second, policymakers can help bridge the gap between potential <lb/>entrepreneurs and investors by helping disabled entrepreneurs <lb/>become investment-ready and by facilitating access to inves-<lb/>tors with networking events, &apos;pitching events&apos; and business <lb/>competitions. The aim is to help entrepreneurs understand <lb/>how the financial industry operates and the requirements <lb/>for receiving investment. Policymakers can go even further <lb/>by bringing investors and entrepreneurs together in special <lb/>events. Face-to-face contact is important to build networks <lb/>and relationships, and entrepreneurs can use the opportunity <lb/>to &apos;sell&apos; their entrepreneurial project. An example of such an <lb/>approach is &apos;Enabled4Growth&apos; which was a small project in <lb/>London, United Kingdom, that aimed to support disabled entre-<lb/>preneurs in accessing finance to expand their business. While it <lb/>did not directly provide funding for the participants, it provided <lb/>training entrepreneurs on how to be investment-ready, to help <lb/>with funding applications and to host networking events where <lb/>entrepreneurs could meet investors. <lb/>A third approach is to increase the availability of direct financ-<lb/>ing, either as small grants or repayable loans. There are a very <lb/>small number of policy schemes in the EU that provide targeted <lb/>financial support for entrepreneurs with disabilities but a lesson <lb/>to bear in mind when designing targeted financial support is <lb/>that financial support for business start-up is more effective <lb/>when delivered in parallel with skills training. An example of <lb/>this approach is &apos;Looking for another sense for entrepreneur-<lb/>ship&apos; in the Slovak Republic, which provides training and funding <lb/>through a business plan competition. See Box 6 for more details. <lb/>Financial support might also extend to the issue of benefits. In <lb/>particular, policymakers should ensure that those moving from <lb/>labour market inactivity, and a high reliance on various forms of <lb/>disability-related benefit, are not disadvantaged or discouraged <lb/>by a benefit system that either responds too quickly to cut ben-<lb/>efits before the transition to entrepreneurship has generated <lb/>any economic gain or by one that adapts too slowly where the <lb/>attempt at entrepreneurship proves unsuccessful. The benefit <lb/>system should be flexible enough to encourage individuals to <lb/>create new firms but also to support those unable to make <lb/>them work. This flexibility should be communicated effectively <lb/>to those at whom the system is targeted, so unjustified fears <lb/>are mitigated, reducing a key barrier to business start-up. <lb/></body>

			<body>Box 6 Looking for another sense (&apos;Hľadáme ďalší zmysel – PRE PODNIKANIE&apos;), Slovak Republic <lb/>Target group: &apos;Looking for another sense&apos; is a project for deaf entrepreneurs aged 18 to 55. <lb/>Intervention type: The project provides information, business consultancy and direct financial support. <lb/>Objectives: The project aims to help provide training and labour market support for deaf people in the Slovak Republic <lb/>because education opportunities and labour market support is limited to a small number of schools that offer specific train-<lb/>ing for a limited number of careers such as hairdressing, tailoring, carpentry or goldsmithing. Many skilled deaf people are <lb/>long-term unemployed and have difficulty accessing labour market information and appropriate training. <lb/>Description: The project is organised and implemented by the Endowment Fund Telekom at the Pontis Foundation, which <lb/>is largely funded by private donors but it also receives some government support. It offers self-employment training and <lb/>access to established entrepreneurs through an online forum, as well as other services such as sign language translators <lb/>and training. In 2012, EUR 50 000 was allocated to support deaf entrepreneurs on the programme. <lb/>Every year, 20 deaf people who are interested in self-employment are selected by an independent committee for a free <lb/>week-long course on business start-up. The course consists of 45 teaching hours that include short lectures, discussions and <lb/>case studies of successful entrepreneurs. During this training, participants learn about basic business finance, marketing and <lb/>regulation. The course is offered for free; participants only pay for travel expenses incurred to reach the training session. <lb/>Following the course, participants are eligible to receive additional mentoring support at no cost. This includes support in the <lb/>development of a business plan and business advisory services during the first 12 months of business operation. Participants <lb/>are eligible to receive a grant of up to EUR 3 320 to support their business start-up by applying to an independent committee <lb/>and successfully defending their business plan. The project also provides networking opportunities for participants to meet <lb/>and develop partnerships with other entrepreneurs. Finally, the project also offers free advertising space on an online portal. <lb/>Results achieved: Since the project started in 2008, more than 48 deaf entrepreneurs have successfully started their own <lb/>businesses, creating jobs for an 50 additional people with hearing impairments. Approximately half of these businesses <lb/>continue to operate. One of the most successful supported start-ups is Deaf Kebab, a kebab restaurant where customers <lb/>order using sign language. Deaf Kebab currently has four franchises and employees more than 10 employees with hearing <lb/>impairments. Other supported businesses operate in a wide variety of sectors, including parachute repairs. The online web <lb/>portal has also expanded to become a broader online business support resource for deaf entrepreneurs and now includes <lb/>pertinent business information and a business advisory forum. <lb/>Lessons for other initiatives: The success of the project is due to an integrated support package that provides entrepre-<lb/>neurship training before start-up and builds on this initial skill-set after business start-up through targeted business advisory <lb/>services and networking support. In addition, a competitive mechanism is used to award financial support which acts as an <lb/>incentive for participants and awards funding where it is most likely to be used successfully. Another feature that comple-<lb/>ments the support for the entrepreneur is the support that the online portal provides in reaching the market. This support <lb/>is intensive and costly. One of the ongoing challenges that the project faces is the need to find financial donors to ensure <lb/>that the support is provided free-of-charge to clients. <lb/>For more information, please refer to: http://www.nepocujucipodnikatelia.sk/grantovy-program/o-programe <lb/></body>

			<body>5. Continue to improve Internet <lb/>and IT accessibility <lb/>Goal <lb/>The Internet and mobile communication technologies have <lb/>become an integral part of society as they are now primary <lb/>methods of communication and accessing information. However <lb/>the benefits are not shared by all because many people with <lb/>disabilities have difficulty using many of these new technolo-<lb/>gies because they are often developed on different platforms <lb/>that are incompatible with assistive technologies. Policymakers <lb/>can do more to support the development and implementation <lb/>of accessibility standards that would improve access to these <lb/>technologies for people with disabilities. <lb/>Approach <lb/>The EU has made a commitment towards improving Internet <lb/>and IT accessibility by signing the Convention on the Rights <lb/>of Persons with Disabilities (United Nations, 2008). In addi-<lb/>tion, many EU countries passed laws and policies regarding <lb/>the accessibility of websites and software applications for the <lb/>public and private sector (W3C, 2006). However, evidence sug-<lb/>gests that there is still a long way to go towards achieving the <lb/>stated objectives in this regard. <lb/>The first area of action for policymakers is to improve the <lb/>IT-accessibility of public websites. The European Union supports <lb/>Member States in these improving the accessibility of their web-<lb/>sites with projects such as the Digital Agenda for Europe, which <lb/>aims to achieve full accessibility of public sector websites by <lb/>2015 (European Commission, 2013). This is critical for people <lb/>with disabilities who are considering self-employment because <lb/>many public services are now online. For example, information on <lb/>business start-up and self-employment is disseminated through <lb/>websites along with links to other supports. Moreover, improving <lb/>the accessibility of public websites will help people with dis-<lb/>abilities comply with obligations such as business registration <lb/>and filing taxes. Improving the accessibility of public websites is <lb/>also a necessary step for governments to take before considering <lb/>measures to improve accessibility for the private sector. <lb/>Another important area for action is to harmonise the standards <lb/>and obligations in IT-accessibility across the EU. The Internet <lb/>holds great potential for entrepreneurs with disabilities because <lb/>it can help them overcome challenges related to communica-<lb/>tion and mobility. However, the vast majority of websites are <lb/>not in accessible formats and are not compatible with assistive <lb/>technologies. To make a significant impact in this area, large <lb/>international efforts are required. There are a small number of <lb/>projects such as Veritas (see Box 7) that attempt to bring public <lb/>and private stakeholders together to address these issues. <lb/>Box 7 Virtual and augmented environments and realistic user interactions to achieve embedded <lb/>accessibility designs (Veritas), Germany <lb/>One of the significant challenges in the development of accessible technologies is the uncertainty of needs and requirements <lb/>by the end-users. In many cases major modifications occur after the product is developed, which adds a significant cost to <lb/>the process. The goal of Veritas project, which ran between 2010 to 2013, was to reduce the need for major modifications <lb/>after product development by identifying and comprehending user requirements more accurately and increasing the use of <lb/>standard technology platforms (Veritas, 2013). <lb/>The initiative was a consortium, composed of 31 organisations from across the EU. The project is coordinated by Fraunhofer <lb/>Corporation in Germany. The total costs of this project were approximately EUR 11.7 million and it received EUR 8.0 million <lb/>from the European Commission&apos;s Community Research and Development Information Service (European Commission, 2013b). <lb/>Veritas bridged the gap between clients and technology producers by increasing access to information on the development <lb/>of information and communication technologies (ICT) and non-ICT products, concerning application areas such as: home, <lb/>workplace and entertainment. In addition, it aimed to better understand the requirements of these applications needed by <lb/>people with disabilities and ensure that developers and producers have this information (Dangelmaier, 2010). For example, <lb/>the project developed several pilot applications that allow designers to better address the needs of various disabilities in <lb/>their products, including applications for automotive and motorcycle design, virtual simulators for home and office spaces <lb/>and simulators for healthcare products. In addition, Veritas advanced work in the entertainment field by developing multi-<lb/>modal interfacing tools that enable the conversion of the game content into information that is easily perceivable by users <lb/>with disabilities. Moreover, virtual reality technology was developed for games with therapeutic value for older people (i.e. <lb/>exercising cognitive and motor abilities) (Dangelmaier, 2010). <lb/>The project also aimed to provide a common platform for these technologies so that fewer modifications are needed once <lb/>the technologies are developed. This can also significantly enhance the dissemination of assistive technologies and new <lb/>services across the EU. People with disabilities will benefit from larger supplies of assistive technologies and innovative <lb/>services regarding their self-employment activities (Dangelmaier, 2010). <lb/>For more information, please refer to: http://veritas-project.eu/about-2 <lb/></body>

			<body>CONCLUSIONS <lb/>Approximately 16 % of the working age population in the EU is <lb/>impacted by disability and this proportion is likely to increase as <lb/>the population ages. Therefore, the issue of social and economic <lb/>participation of people with disabilities will become increasingly <lb/>important policy issue over the next decade and entrepreneurship <lb/>can be part of the solution for some members of this population. <lb/>People with disabilities are disproportionately inactive in the <lb/>labour market in all Member States (Applica/CESEP/European <lb/>Centre, 2007), but there is evidence to suggest that people <lb/>with disabilities that participate in the labour market are just <lb/>as likely as those without disabilities to be self-employed. Self-<lb/>employment can facilitate active social and economic participa-<lb/>tion and give control to the individual over their participation. <lb/>Entrepreneurship can allow flexibility in workload, work hours and <lb/>work location, providing more flexibility in coping with disability <lb/>than can be often found in paid employment. <lb/>While business creation and self-employment are not suitable <lb/>for all people with disabilities, there are several ways in which <lb/>policymakers can improve their support for entrepreneurship <lb/>for people with disabilities. A first approach is to review current <lb/>business start-up support offerings to ensure that it is available <lb/>in accessible formats and to educate business advisors on the <lb/>potential and risks that business start-up and self-employment <lb/>have for people with disabilities. It is a realistic career option <lb/>for many and they should not be discouraged based on dis-<lb/>ability alone. An important element of improving information <lb/>on business start-up for people with disabilities is to increase <lb/>the amount of information available on the impact of business <lb/>creation and self-employment income on benefit payments <lb/>received by individuals. Many people with disabilities receive <lb/>different forms of public support including disability insurance <lb/>payments, housing allowances, minimum income supports, <lb/>etc. and it is important for their decision to start a business. <lb/>A second area of action for governments is to support the devel-<lb/>opment and adoption of assistive technologies. Development of <lb/>these technologies is vitally important for much of this popu-<lb/>lation to more fully participate in daily life. Policymakers can <lb/>support these development efforts directly with funding and <lb/>tax incentives and offer financial incentives and support for <lb/>individuals to encourage the adoption of these technologies. <lb/>International cooperation is important in this field and gov-<lb/>ernments should seek partnerships with other governments, <lb/>international organisations and the business sector to ensure <lb/>common standards and platforms. <lb/>Third, there is a limited evidence base that supports the <lb/>development of targeted training and support that is tai-<lb/>lored to the needs and challenges of entrepreneurs and <lb/>potential entrepreneurs with various disabilities. There are <lb/>three important considerations for this policy approach. First, <lb/>the size of the potential client group is nearly always very <lb/>small given the heterogeneity of impairment characteristics <lb/>(e.g. type, severity, stability, duration and time of onset). <lb/>Consequently, policy may need to support entrepreneurs with <lb/>diverse impairment characteristics in different ways and over <lb/>varying timescales. Intensive, tailored, one-to-one, or small <lb/>group support provision, likely produces the most success-<lb/>ful outcomes (Arnold and Ipsen, 2005; Enabled4Enterprise, <lb/>2009a, b; EMDA, 2009; Dotson et al., 2013) but such tailored <lb/>approaches are highly resource intensive. Partnerships with <lb/>specialist organisations are often essential to the success <lb/>of targeted approaches because they already have credible <lb/>relationships with the target clients and policymakers can <lb/>leverage existing resources to make tailored approaches <lb/>more cost-effective. <lb/>Finally, governments should be doing more to ensure that all <lb/>public websites are accessible. With the Internet becoming <lb/>the primary way in which governments and citizens interact, <lb/>much more can be done to improve the accessibility of online <lb/>business services such as business registration, tax filing and <lb/>business information resources. <lb/></body>

			<div type="annex">This policy brief was produced by the OECD and the European Commission on entrepreneurship by people with disabilities. <lb/>It presents data on the scale of self-employment and entrepreneurship activities undertaken by people with disabilities and <lb/>discusses the barriers to entrepreneurship that are unique to people with disabilities. The policy brief also discusses policy <lb/>approaches to support entrepreneurship for people with disabilities, including increasing awareness about the feasibility <lb/>of entrepreneurship; developing entrepreneurship skills; supporting the development, acquisition and use of assistive tech-<lb/>nologies; ensuring access to appropriate financial support; and, improving Internet and IT accessibility.
