            <figDesc>As already noted, the Commission proposed directives relating to ELM prior the 2005 Policy<lb/> Plan; and although the failed horizontal proposal from 2001 counts as the first substantial one, important<lb/> ELM components were also included in the even earlier directive proposal (March 2001, EC 2001a)<lb/> concerning the status of third country nationals who are long-term residents, which was adopted in<lb/> November 2003. The Directive (Dir. 2003/109/EC) 13 establishes the conditions under which a member<lb/> state confers (and revokes) long-term resident status and accompanying rights to legally resident TCNs. 14</figDesc>

            <figDesc>Closely related to the Student Directive, the so-called Researchers Directive (Dir. 2005/71/EC) 17<lb/> was adopted in October 2005. Aiming to attract third country researchers to the EU and forming an integral<lb/> part of the creation of a European Research Area and the Lisbon Strategy&apos;s goal of turning the EU into &apos;the<lb/> most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world by 2010&apos;, this directive was also<lb/> launched for the more particular purpose of contributing to the target (set in 2003) of having an additional<lb/> 700 000 researchers working in the Union by 2010 (via a goal of earmarking 3% of GDP for investment in<lb/> research).</figDesc>

Of the directives dealt with here, this was the first to be adopted under the Lisbon Treaty and thus<lb/> 21<lb/> For more on the limited scope and impact of the Blue Card, see e.g. the contributions in Grütters and Strik<lb/> (eds, 2013); Cerna (2014); Gümüs (2010); Peers (2009).<lb/> 22<lb/> As stated by the Commission (2007: 6) in the directive proposal: &apos;Intra-EU mobility would be a strong<lb/> incentive for third-country highly qualified workers to enter the EU labour market, and could play a<lb/> primary role in relieving the labour shortages in certain areas/sectors.&apos;<lb/> 23<lb/> Directive 2011/98/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 December 2011 on a single<lb/> application procedure for a single permit for third-country nationals to reside and work in the territory of a<lb/> Member State and on a common set of rights for third-country workers legally residing in a Member State.<lb/> The UK, Ireland and Denmark do not take part in this directive.</figDesc>

Yet, as the Commission noted in its Annual Report (2014b: 14), by the end of 2013 only 8<lb/> members had complied, prompting the Commission to open infringements proceedings.<lb/> 24<lb/> Initially, the directive had its legal basis in the old Article 63, when the Community method did not apply,<lb/> but since it had not been adopted when the Lisbon Treaty (and the full scope of the Community method)<lb/> entered into force in December 2009, its legal basis was changed to Article 79.</figDesc>
