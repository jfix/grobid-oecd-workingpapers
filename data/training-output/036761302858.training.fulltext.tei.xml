			<head>Introduction<lb/></head>

			<p>Poor countries are and will remain for some time vulnerable to external<lb/> shocks, whether to export prices or from natural disasters. The lowest-income<lb/> countries have a higher incidence of shocks than other developing countries and<lb/> tend to suffer larger damages when shocks occur. For the poorest countries, the<lb/> average number of disasters between 1997 and 2001 has been one every<lb/> 2.5 years. Commodity price shocks are also more severe for poor countries.<lb/> Low-income countries experience this type of shock on average every 3.3 years.<lb/> About 26 highly-indebted countries have an export concentration of more than<lb/> 50 per cent in three or fewer commodities, while 62 per cent of the total exports<lb/> of the least developed countries are unprocessed primary commodities.<lb/> Exogenous shocks on commodity prices have significant direct adverse<lb/> effects on growth and the multiplier effects of negative terms of trade shocks can<lb/> also be large. <ref type="biblio">Collier and Sewn (2001)</ref> show, for a sample of cases where the<lb/> direct income loss averaged 6.8 per cent of GDP, the total correlated loss of<lb/> income amounted to about twice that much, to 14 per cent of GDP. Research<lb/> shows that these negative shocks increase the incidence of poverty. The shocks<lb/> also have a significant impact on fiscal and external balances. An IMF study shows<lb/> that terms-of-trade shocks and adverse weather conditions have played an<lb/> important role in exacerbating debt problems 3 .<lb/></p>

			<p>In theory, the desired adjustment to a shock depends on the nature of the<lb/> shock. The response to permanent and to transitory shocks should not be the<lb/> same. If the shock is expected to be permanent, countries should adjust as fast<lb/> as possible to the new environment. If instead a negative shock is expected to be<lb/> reversed by a positive shock, it makes sense to finance the bad years out of savings<lb/> or out of debt. Commodity prices, however, are usually very slow to recover<lb/> from adverse shocks. This is one of the reasons why it has proven so difficult<lb/> either to smooth their effect or to stabilise them. Countries that borrow when<lb/> prices are low are bound to face financial difficulties before prices recover to their<lb/> previous levels. In fact, even if a shock is deemed to be transitory, there can be<lb/> considerable uncertainty about how long it will take to be reversed. Over<lb/> optimism concerning the pace of a recovery has been a key factor behind the<lb/> excessive occurrence of debt by poor countries.<lb/></p>

			<p>Similarly, Commodity Funds that attempt to stabilise prices at a given level<lb/> are bound to fail. Either there is a negative shock and the Fund soon becomes<lb/> insolvent, or there is a positive shock and the Fund becomes so well-endowed<lb/> that the temptation to expropriate it becomes irresistible. This explains why<lb/> marketing boards have almost always failed, either through corruption or<lb/> through bankruptcy. As documented in a recent FAO study, however, the<lb/> dismantling of marketing boards has not been without creating new problems.<lb/> Uncertainty regarding their income, in particular, has created credit problems to<lb/> crop producers, so that input use has dropped significantly, explaining in part the<lb/> drop of quality of the products 4 .<lb/></p>

			<p>On the donor community, there have been two major compensatory financing<lb/> programmes for terms of trade shocks: the EU Stabex and Sysmin and the IMF&apos;s<lb/> Compensatory Financing Facility (CFF). The EU&apos;s programme covered agricultural<lb/> commodity exports and selected mineral exports. From 1975 to 2000, about<lb/> 6.1 billion euros was disbursed. The CFF provides financing when a country<lb/> experiences a &quot; temporary &quot; shortfall in export earnings or an excess in cereal import<lb/> costs. A total of SDR 25 billion has been disbursed in response to 344 requests for<lb/> assistance since 1963. Neither experience was deemed to be highly successful<lb/> however. As shown in <ref type="biblio">Guillaumont et al. (2003)</ref>, both mechanisms became<lb/> increasingly contingent on conditionalities of various sorts, which have lengthened<lb/> the delay between the occurrence of the shock and the need of the countries. Delays<lb/> in response have actually been so long that they turn out to be pro-cyclical, rather<lb/> than counter-cyclical as one would have expected (<ref type="biblio">Brun et al. 2001</ref>).<lb/> <ref type="biblio">Collier and Dehn (2001)</ref> also present evidence that aid allocations are not well<lb/> targeted to commodity price shocks. Commodity price shocks, they argue, are like<lb/> &quot; silent crises &quot; . Financial assistance in the event of a terms-of-trade shock appears<lb/> to be harder to design and target than that for natural disasters assistance (natural<lb/> disasters actually attract more external financing than commodity price shocks).<lb/> These failures explain the conclusion that not much can or should be done<lb/> to stabilise commodity prices. Exporting countries, it is sometimes argued,<lb/> should behave as if any commodity shock was bound to be permanent and adjust<lb/> accordingly. This is too extreme a conclusion. There is no reason why countries<lb/> should not find ways to protect themselves against adverse shocks, if not fully at<lb/> least partially. The idea developed in this Brief builds indeed upon the following<lb/> intuition: countries can get protection against commodity shocks, but for a while<lb/> only rather than indefinitely.<lb/></p>

			<p>Technically, the solution that we explore is the following. We propose to<lb/> create new Commodity Funds, with limited liabilities, to stabilise commodity<lb/> producers&apos; income around a reference price which is a moving average of past<lb/> prices. The reference price upon which the income of the producers is<lb/> calculated is known in advance to the producers and yet is allowed to follow<lb/> market trends smoothly. This avoids the pitfalls of past stabilisation based around<lb/> 6<lb/></p>

			<head>OECD Development Centre Policy Brief No. 32<lb/></head>

			<p>a given reference price, which is bound, sooner or later, to be out of touch with<lb/> market forces. In the simulations that we present, the reference price is a moving<lb/> average of previous prices over the past five years. Even in the event of a<lb/> permanent shock, this gives the country time to take the needed adjustment.<lb/> How much would it cost to create a Fund that protects producers against<lb/> deviations from such a five-year moving average? The answer is twofold. In the<lb/> worst case scenario where the Fund should stand ready to guarantee producers<lb/> against a total collapse of their prices, it would cost a one-off endowment worth<lb/> 2.7 times the yearly value of the exports that one seeks to protect. Note that this<lb/> is a finite number: even if prices were to stay indefinitely nil, the Fund would stop<lb/> guaranteeing producers after five years. In general, however, the Fund is bound<lb/> to cost less. Over a period of 50 years, the median cost would be worth about<lb/> six months exports. The Brief also presents the risk of default of the Fund<lb/> associated to lower levels of endowment than the maximum needed. One year<lb/> of exports would be associated to a risk of default of about 10 per cent over a<lb/> 50 years horizon.<lb/></p>

			<p>There are many ways by which the ideas involved in this mechanism could<lb/> be applied. One is simply to create a Fund in which producers would be free to<lb/> participate and which would be endowed accordingly. The Fund would act as an<lb/> insurer, which producers would draw upon or replenish according to the prices<lb/> that they face.<lb/></p>

			<p>Another idea would be to modulate traditional ODA according to the<lb/> moving average idea that we propose. Commodity exporters would receive<lb/> ODA that would vary inversely with deviations of commodity prices from past<lb/> averages. The computations that are performed in the Brief would then help<lb/> donors assess the cost to proceed along these lines.<lb/></p>

			<head>Empirical Investigation<lb/></head>

			<p>We seek to analyse how a Commodity Fund could guarantee a reference<lb/> price to an exporting country, where the reference prices is a moving average of<lb/> the price over the preceding years. In the sequel, we shall focus on a reference<lb/> price based on the average of the past five years. In the simulation that we offer,<lb/> the stabilisation is done through a Fund which is initially endowed with a given<lb/> amount of resources. The aim of this Policy Brief is to determine the probability<lb/> of depletion of the Fund and to investigate how much resources are needed to<lb/> avoid (with various degrees of probability) its bankruptcy.<lb/></p>

			<p>In order to calibrate the results, monthly commodity price data reported<lb/> in the International Monetary Fund&apos;s International</p>

			<figure>Financial Statistics, for the<lb/> period January 1957 to December 2003 are used. The commodities used for the<lb/> study are presented in Table 1. For each selected commodity, the table presents<lb/> the sample period used for the study, the spot price in July 2003, then a figure<lb/> which can be regarded as a rough estimate of the total exports of developing<lb/> countries in 2003. In the following analysis, all prices will be real prices, deflated<lb/> by a US producer price index, taking July 2003 as the reference.<lb/></figure>

			<table>Table 1. Selected Commodities<lb/> Commodities<lb/> Sample period<lb/> Price 7/2003<lb/> Annual Value<lb/> ($ million)<lb/> Bananas<lb/> 1/75-12/2003<lb/> 296.30 US$/ton<lb/> 3 438<lb/> Cocoa Beans<lb/> 1/1957-12/2003<lb/> 1 556.87 US$/ton<lb/> 43 287<lb/> Cotton<lb/> 1/1957-12/2003<lb/> 60.19 US cts/lb<lb/> 4 248<lb/> Rice<lb/> 1/1957-12/2003<lb/> 199.48 US$/ton<lb/> 3 970<lb/></table>

			<p>Figures 1 to 4 plot monthly spot prices, along with monthly moving averages<lb/> over 2, 5 and 10 years, with an initial lag of 1 year (i.e. the moving average is lagged<lb/> by one year). With the exception of bananas, one striking feature of price<lb/> movements is that the peaks appear to be more accentuated than the troughs,<lb/> a feature that is analysed in Deaton and Laroque (1992).<lb/></p>

			<head>Simulating the Fund 5<lb/></head>

			<p>There are many parameters which can be adjusted for the simulations. One<lb/> is the number of years over which the moving average is calculated. We present<lb/> simulations based on a 5 years moving average. Another parameter is the yearly<lb/> interest rate, which we take equal to 5 per cent. The other key parameter, which<lb/> we allow to vary in the simulations, is the initial endowment of the Fund, called 0<lb/> F .<lb/></p>

			<p>The first set of simulations has computed which endowments are needed<lb/> in order to reduce the risk of bankruptcy of the Fund below a given level. They<lb/> are presented in <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<head>12<lb/> OECD Development Centre Policy Brief No. 32<lb/></head>

			<p>For example, the line for cocoa refers to price stabilisation for cocoa beans.<lb/> With an initial endowment of 1.8 times the annual value of trade, the Fund will<lb/> remain always positive with a 90 per cent chance. With an initial endowment<lb/> worth 2.68 times the volume of trade, the Fund will never become negative, even<lb/> at an infinite time horizon. This is in fact a general statistical property: it never<lb/> takes more than 2.68 times the flows of trade volume to stabilise commodities<lb/> along the lines of our proposal. The intuition is in fact quite simple. The worst case<lb/> scenario is one in which the price of the commodity collapses to zero indefinitely.<lb/> In that case the Fund has to pay the exporters one full year of exports during the<lb/> first year, then 0.75, then 0.5 then 0.25 then nothing. That makes 2.5 years, given<lb/> the interest on the Fund borrowed, that makes a bit more.<lb/></p>

			<p>Clearly, however, the numbers in <ref type="table">Table 2</ref> are worst case scenarios. In<lb/> average, the Fund is much less costly. Ups and downs usually alternate, around<lb/> the moving average, so that the Fund sometimes recaptures part of the transfers.<lb/> The median cost of the Fund is simulated, when it is allowed to run for a period<lb/> of 50 years. The results are shown in</p>

			<table>Table 3 below.<lb/> Table 2. Endowment and Default Risk of a Commodity Fund<lb/> Default risk<lb/> 50%<lb/> 10%<lb/> 5%<lb/> 1%<lb/> 0%<lb/> Bananas<lb/> 0.39<lb/> 1.12<lb/> 1.36<lb/> 1.87<lb/> 2.68<lb/> Cocoa<lb/> 0.78<lb/> 1.80<lb/> 1.97<lb/> 2.19<lb/> 2.68<lb/> Cotton<lb/> 0.65<lb/> 1.26<lb/> 1.40<lb/> 1.62<lb/> 2.68<lb/> Rice<lb/> 0.93<lb/> 1.75<lb/> 1.90<lb/> 2.11<lb/> 2.68<lb/> Note: Endowments are measured as a fraction of yearly volumes.<lb/> Table 3.

			<p>The table shows that stabilizing the income of Cotton and Rice produces<lb/> would take about less than 6 months of exports in 50 per cent of cases. The<lb/> corresponding cost would be around 4 months for bananas. In the case of Cocoa,<lb/> the cost would actually be negative: in average one would gain by offering this<lb/> scheme to exporters.<lb/></p>

			<head>Other Options<lb/></head>

			<p>Two other alternative options were also tested. One is the operating cost<lb/> of a Fund which would pool all five commodities together. In the case of a 10 per<lb/> cent default risk and for a five-year moving average, a cost corresponding to 0.88<lb/> times the volume of trade to be insured is required. This is quite significantly less<lb/> than the amounts obtained for each individual fund, which varied from 1.12 to<lb/> 1.80 times the trade flows and shows that there would be some merit to form<lb/> a &quot; mega Fund &quot; rather than individual ones.<lb/> Another simulation is to calculate how large should be the endowment of<lb/> a Fund that would stabilise commodities on an asymmetric basis, that is which<lb/> would transfer resources in case of a bad shock but not to collect them in case<lb/> of a positive one? <ref type="table">Table 4</ref> presents the results corresponding to a 10 per cent<lb/> default risk.<lb/></p>

			<table>Table 4. Endowment Needed to Stabilise Prices<lb/> with Asymmetrical Payments<lb/> Bananas<lb/> 2.22<lb/> Cocoa<lb/> 6.56<lb/> Cotton<lb/> 1.87<lb/> Rice<lb/> 3.67<lb/> Note: As a fraction of trade volumes, with 10 per cent default risk.<lb/></table>

			<head>14<lb/> OECD Development Centre Policy Brief No. 32<lb/></head>

			<p>The asymmetrical scheme is clearly much more expensive than the<lb/> symmetric one. In the case of cocoa, for instance, the Fund would need to be<lb/> endowed with six times the corresponding volume of trade, while, under the<lb/> symmetric case, the amount was only 1.81 times the flows involved.<lb/> One important point should also be noted. As Fally (2004) demonstrates<lb/> theoretically, one should not seek to protect the entirety of the producers&apos;<lb/> income. Indeed, in that case, the scheme would be open to manipulation. In year t<lb/> for instance the producers could reduce production so as to let prices go up and<lb/> then in year t+1 flood the market at the stabilised price. If instead they receive<lb/> a protection for only the first x tons of their output, then the incentive to<lb/> manipulate prices disappear.<lb/></p>

			<head>Policy Implications<lb/></head>

			<p>There is a wide array of institutions and issues implicated in this problem.<lb/> The relevant institutions – whether IDA (the branch of the World Bank lending<lb/> to the poorest countries) or the IMF or other members of the international<lb/> donor community – could lend support to Commodity Funds. Currently, LIC<lb/> government finances absorb alone the risks and shocks associated with a range<lb/> of economic, geopolitical, epidemiological and climatic uncertainties.<lb/> One could first think of creating new debt instruments that explicitly take<lb/> account of exogenous risks. In September 1999, the World Bank introduced risk<lb/> management products linked to its loan exposure. These hedging products are:<lb/> interest rate swaps, caps and collars; currency swaps; and commodity price-<lb/>linked swaps. The Bank decided not to offer specific commodity-based loans at<lb/> that time because it would have been difficult to undertake the commodity-based<lb/> funding and liability management to match the disbursement periods of Bank<lb/> loans while managing associated risks.<lb/> The approach in this paper would help to overcome these difficulties. One<lb/> idea would be to set up a Fund aimed at smoothing the payments made by the<lb/> debtors to IDA for instance. (<ref type="biblio">Gilbert et al., 2004</ref>) have calibrated similar ideas).<lb/> The mechanism described here would not extinguish the debt in case of the<lb/> prices falling to zero. It would simply give time to adjust. On the other hand, this<lb/> would not be very costly. For a loan of 100 whose repayment is 5, all that would<lb/> be needed is a Fund endowed with say 15 (see <ref type="biblio">Cohen and Reisen, 2006</ref>, on a<lb/> similar idea). The fact that the Funds have limited liabilities has the merit of putting<lb/> a specific limit to the commitment of the donor community.<lb/> Making ODA counter-cyclical is another way of addressing the problem.<lb/> Although this has long been a theme of donor agencies, they often fail to recognise<lb/> that &quot; counter-cyclicality &quot; does not mean much when shocks are either long<lb/> lasting or permanent. The idea developed in this brief allows to give a more<lb/> precise content to this idea and to measure the corresponding cost of implementing<lb/> it. ODA could include a component that allows to smooth commodity exporters<lb/> incomes. Donors would commit a given amount of resources to a Commodity<lb/> Fund, whose endowments could be directly counted as ODA at the time when<lb/> they are granted by the donor.<lb/></p>

			<head>Conclusion<lb/></head>

			<p>This paper has presented a scheme which could be used in a variety of<lb/> fashions: either directly to help producers protect themselves against adverse<lb/> shocks, or to calibrate ODA to a government to dampen the impacts of price<lb/> volatility on GDP. The scheme could also help tailor new loans to commodity<lb/> dependent countries, smoothing their repayment pattern accordingly. The<lb/> orders of magnitude presented should give some indication of the costs of<lb/> supplying a revenue-smoothing mechanism.<lb/></p>
