Cross-country evidence from firm level data This paper exploits longitudinal data on firm performance and patenting activity for 23 OECD countries 
over the period 2003-2010 to explore the extent to which changes in the patent stock are associated with 
flows of capital and labour to patenting firms. While the finding that patenting is associated with real 
changes in economic activity at the firm level is in line with recent literature, new empirical evidence 
presented suggests that the impact of patenting on firm size is likely to be causal. Moreover, these data 
reveal important differences across OECD countries in the extent to which innovative firms can attract the 
complementary tangible resources that are required to implement and commercialise new ideas. In turn, the 
contribution of framework policies to explaining the observed cross-country differences in the magnitude 
of these flows is explored. While further research is required to establish causality, the results are 
consistent with the idea that well-functioning product, labour and capital markets; efficient judicial systems 
and bankruptcy laws that do not overly penalise failure can raise the returns to innovative activity. The 
paper also investigates the heterogeneous impacts of policies and finds that young firms – which are more 
likely to experiment with disruptive technologies and rely on external financing to implement and 
commercialise their ideas – disproportionately benefit from reforms to labour markets and more developed 
markets for credit and seed and early stage finance. JEL classification codes: O30, O31, O33, O34, L25 Keywords: Innovation, patents, reallocation, firm growth. *********************** Les ressources convergent-elles vers les entreprises brevetantes ? Éléments de comparaison entre pays à 
partir de données au niveau des entreprises Cette étude tire parti de données longitudinales sur les performances et l'activité de brevetage d'entreprises 
de 23 pays membres de l'OCDE sur la période 2003-2010 pour examiner dans quelle mesure des 
évolutions du stock de brevets sont associées à des flux de capitaux et de main-d'oeuvre en direction des 
entreprises brevetantes. Si l'observation que le brevetage est associé à des évolutions réelles de l'activité 
économique au niveau de l'entreprise concorde avec les publications récentes, les nouvelles observations 
empiriques présentées ici donnent à penser qu'il existe vraisemblablement un lien de causalité entre le 
dépôt de brevets et la taille de l'entreprise. De plus, ces données font apparaître d'importantes différences 
entre pays de l'OCDE quant à la mesure dans laquelle les entreprises innovantes peuvent attirer les 
ressources corporelles complémentaires requises pour mettre en oeuvre et commercialiser des idées 
nouvelles. L'étude explore ensuite la contribution de politiques cadres qui pourrait expliquer les 
différences observées entre pays dans l'ampleur de ces flux. Bien que des recherches complémentaires 
soient nécessaires pour établir une causalité, les résultats concordent avec l'idée que des marchés de 
produits, de main-d'oeuvre et de capitaux efficaces, des systèmes judiciaires efficients et des législations 
sur les faillites qui ne pénalisent pas indûment l'échec peuvent accroître les retours sur l'activité 
d'innovation. L'étude examine aussi les impacts hétérogènes des politiques et constate que les jeunes 
entreprises – qui sont davantage susceptibles d'expérimenter des technologies de rupture et de dépendre de 
financements externes pour la mise en oeuvre et la commercialisation de leurs idées – bénéficient 
beaucoup plus que les autres des réformes des marchés du travail et de marchés plus développés du crédit

CROSS-COUNTRY EVIDENCE FROM 
FIRM-LEVEL DATA By Dan Andrews, Chiara Criscuolo and Carlo Menon 1 1. 
Introduction 1. 
While innovation-based growth – underpinned by investments in knowledge-based capital 
(KBC) – is central to raising long-term living standards, there are important differences across OECD 
countries in investments in KBC and innovative capacity, which carry important implications for aggregate 
productivity performance (OECD 2010; Andrews and Criscuolo, 2013). One possible explanation for these 
patterns at the aggregate level is that the returns to innovation vary across OECD countries, which provide 
firms in some countries with a greater incentive to innovate. The returns to innovation are partly influenced 
by the ease with which innovative firms can attract sufficient tangible resources to underpin the 
implementation and commercialisation of new ideas, which will in turn reflect the ability of national 
economies to reallocate scarce resources toward the most innovative firms over time. In this context, 
adjustment frictions preventing the (re)allocation of resources towards their most productive use can 
significantly affect aggregate innovation and productivity outcomes (Bartelsman et al., 2013). 2 Given the 
potential for public policy to affect resource flows (Andrews and Cingano, 2014; Bravo-Biosca et al., 
2013), this paper explores the extent to which public policies shape the ability of innovative firms to attract 
capital and labour. 2. 
This paper draws on an emerging literature from the United States, which utilises firm level 
longitudinal data on firms' patenting activity and performance to examine what happens when firms patent. 
While patenting is an imperfect measure of innovation, these studies show that patenting tends to be 1

those of the authors and do not reflect those of the OECD and its member countries. 2 
For example, see Restuccia and Rogerson, (2008) and Hsieh and Klenow (2009). ECO/WKP(2014)23 6 associated with important economic changes within firms (Balasubramanian and Sivadasan, 2011) and 
demonstrate strong patterns of reallocation towards patenting firms and away from firms that do not 
innovate (Kogan et al., 2012). Despite the emergence of this literature, there is very little cross-country 
evidence on patterns of reallocation towards innovative firms. Accordingly, following the approach used 
by Balasubramanian and Sivadasan (2011) for the United States, this paper looks at 23 OECD countries 
over the period 2002-2010 using matched PATSTAT-ORBIS data, with a view to highlight cross-country 
differences in reallocation and innovation patterns. 3 To the best of the authors' knowledge, this paper is the 
first to explore cross-country differences in the extent to which resources flow to patenting firms. 3. 
Using this approach, it is possible to replicate a key message from the US studies: namely, that 
patenting is associated with real changes in economic activity at the firm level. For the average firm in the 
sample, the baseline estimates imply that a 10% increase in the firm patent stock is associated with a 1% 
increase in employment and a 1.3% increase in the capital stock. Moreover, instrumental variables 
estimation – which exploits data on patent litigation within technological fields to instrument patenting – 
suggests that the impact of patenting on firm size is likely to be causal, which is a significant contribution 
to this literature given that existing studies have ignored biases arising from the endogeneity of patenting 
activity. Beyond the direct positive effects of a firm's own patents, firms will also indirectly benefit from 
patenting of other firms in the same conglomerate, since firm performance measures also respond to the 
patents held by other affiliates within the same group, highlighting the importance of knowledge flows 
within broad organisational structures. Finally, while the baseline results suggest that patenting has a small 
or insignificant impact on productivity – consistent with the US literature – additional analysis suggests 
that the impact of patenting on productivity is realised with a lag. This is consistent with the idea that firms 
typically need to undergo organisational restructuring and attract complementary tangible resources before 
they can fully realise the benefits of new ideas (David and Wright, 2003). 4. 
The analysis also reveals some interesting cross-country patterns, which seem to suggest that 
some countries are more successful than others at reallocating tangible resources to innovative firms. For 
example, the extent to which labour flows to patenting firms in the United States is estimated to be more 
than twice as large as in Italy, and these differences become four-to-five-fold when looking at capital. 
These differences, in turn, motivate an analysis of the role of public policies in shaping the observed 
cross-country differences in resource flows to patenting firms – another key novelty of the paper. While 
further work is required to establish causality – and with the caveat related to the limitations of patenting 
as a measure of innovation – the results are consistent with the idea that well-functioning product, labour 
and capital markets, efficient judicial systems and bankruptcy laws that do not overly penalise failure can 
raise the expected returns to investing in KBC. These benefits are partly realised through stronger 
competitive pressures and more efficient reallocation, which make it easier for successful firms to 
implement and commercialise new ideas and, by lowering the costs of failure, encourage firms to 
experiment with uncertain growth opportunities. 5. 
More specifically, the results of the econometric analysis provide support for the following policy 
conclusions: @BULLET Stringent employment protection legislation (EPL) is associated with lower resource flows to 
patenting firms, reflecting the idea that stringent EPL raises the cost of reallocating resources. 
The estimated effect of EPL is economically large: a policy reform that reduced the stringency of 
EPL from the highest observed level (Portugal) to the average level (Norway) is estimated to 3 
The 23 OECD countries included are: Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, 
Germany, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Korea, Japan, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Slovak Republic, 
Spain, Slovenia, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom and the United States. ECO/WKP(2014)23 7 more than double the extent to which labour flows to patenting firms. Additional analysis 
suggests that the burden of stringent EPL falls disproportionately on young firms, which is 
consistent with existing studies showing that stringent EPL reduces the scope for experimentation 
with uncertain technologies. @BULLET Cumbersome product market regulations (PMR) are negatively associated with employment 
flows to patenting firms, which may reflect the tendency for such regulations to prolong the 
existence of inefficient firms in the market and to raise the cost structure of inputs that are 
required by innovative firms to underpin their expansion. The estimates imply that the 
responsiveness of firm employment to increases in the patent stock would more than double if the 
stringency of PMR was reduced from the highest observed level (Poland) to the sample mean 
value (Belgium). Similarly, more stringent barriers to trade and investment reduce the ability of 
patenting firms to attract capital: all else equal, reducing barriers to trade and investment from the 
most stringent setting (Slovak Republic) to sample average (Japan) is associated with a 70% 
increase in the extent to which capital flows to patenting firms. @BULLET Bankruptcy legislation that does not excessively penalise business failure can promote the flow 
of resources to more innovative firms by reducing entrepreneurs' expectations that they will be 
heavily penalised in case of failure and thus encouraging them to experiment with risky 
high-return high-failure type technologies. For instance, reducing the cost of bankruptcy 
procedures from the sample maximum (Italy) to the mean value (France) would be associated 
with a 30% increase in the capital flow to patenting firms. @BULLET In countries with more efficient judicial systems, capital and labour flow more readily to 
patenting firms, consistent with research showing that easier contract enforcement makes it less 
costly to hire the skilled workers necessary to underpin firm growth. All else equal, a policy 
reform that improved the civil justice system in the least efficient country (Czech Republic) to 
the average efficiency in the sample (Switzerland) would be associated with a 50% increase in 
the extent to which capital flows to patenting firms. @BULLET Resource flows to patenting firms tend to be stronger in countries with more developed financial 
markets, and this effect is particularly important for young firms. Thus, financial systems play an 
important role in helping credit-constrained firms to implement and commercialise new ideas, 
raising the returns to innovation. Similarly, resources flow more freely to young patenting firms 
in countries with more developed markets for seed and early stage venture capital. This suggests 
that seed and early stage venture capital plays an important role for ensuring the growth of young 
patenting firms and the development of radical innovations. For example, all else equal, 
increasing access to early stage venture capital from the lowest level (Greece) to the sample 
average (Belgium) implies that capital flows to patenting firms would be around one-third higher 
than otherwise. 6. 
The paper proceeds as follows. The next section places our study in the context of the existing 
literature and discusses the channels through which public policies may influence resource flows to 
innovative firms. Section 3 describes the underlying firm level data used in the analysis and presents some 
preliminary evidence on key economic differences between patenting and non-patenting firms. In 
Section 4, the empirical methodology utilised to estimate resource flows to patenting firms is outlined, as 
well as the approach to identify the impact of public policies on resource flows. Section 5 discusses the 
empirical results and highlights: i) that patenting is likely to cause real changes in economic activity at the 
firm level, both at the intensive and extensive margins; ii) some interesting cross-country differences in the 
extent to which resources flow to patenting firms; iii) that public policies can shape resource flows to 
innovative firms; iv) that these policy effects are stronger in sectors more exposed to the policies; and v) ECO/WKP(2014)23 8 that the burden of some policies fall disproportionately on young firms, which are shown to be key agents 
in the introduction of radical innovations. In Section 6, some robustness tests are performed, while 
Section 7 offers some concluding thoughts. 2. 
Innovation, resource reallocation and growth 7. 
Cross-country differences in aggregate-level productivity outcomes are increasingly being linked 
to the widespread asymmetry and heterogeneity in firm performance within sectors (Bartelsman et al., 
2013; Hsieh and Klenow, 2009). The distribution of firm productivity is typically not clustered around the 
mean (as would be the case with a normal distribution) but is instead characterised by many below-average 
performers and a smaller number of star performers. Moreover, the degree of heterogeneity is striking: 
even within narrowly defined industries in the United States, firms at the 90th percentile of the TFP 
distribution are twice as productive as firms at the 10th percentile (Syverson, 2004). 4 These findings 
suggest that the focus on average outcomes is misleading and thus heterogeneous firm models are 
becoming the main analytical workhouse and empirical research is increasingly focusing on the star 
performers which disproportionately drive productivity and job growth (Haltiwanger, 2013; Criscuolo et 
al., 2014). 8. 
Given the tendency for highly productive firms to coexist with low productivity firms within 
narrowly-defined sectors, the recent literature has focused on resource misallocation as a potential 
explanation for why some countries are more productive than others (Bartelsman et al., 2013; Hsieh and 
Klenow, 2009). A key observation is that in well-functioning economies, a firm's relative position in the 
productivity and size distributions is positively correlated, which means that on average relatively more 
productive firms should be larger (e.g. static allocative efficiency; see Olley and Pakes, 1996). Research on 
firm dynamics reveals large cross-country differences in the efficiency of resource allocation, which 
suggests that some economies are more successful at channelling resources to highly productive firms than 
others. For example, in the United States, manufacturing sector labour productivity is 50% higher due to 
the actual allocation of employment across firms, compared to a hypothetical situation where labour is 
uniformly allocated across firms, irrespective of their productivity (Bartelsman et al., 2013). While a 
similar pattern holds for some countries of Northern Europe such as Sweden, it turns out that static 
allocative efficiency is considerably lower in other OECD economies, particularly those of Southern 
Europe (Andrews and Cingano, 2014). 9. 
While there are likely to be many reasons why some countries are more successful than others at 
channelling resources to the most productive firms, static allocative efficiency can only be achieved if 
there is dynamic allocative efficiency that occurs when resources move towards more productive firms at 
the expense of less productive firms over time (Haltiwanger, 2011). Accordingly, the following section 
discusses empirical evidence on dynamic resource reallocation with a special reference to resource flows to 
patenting firms – the central issue explored in this paper. 2.1 
A healthy economy reallocates resources to their most productive use 10. 
The pace of reallocation of inputs and outputs is generally high in OECD countries: on average, 
about 15-20% of all firms and more than 20% of jobs are created or destroyed each year. 5 This is not to say 4 
The same is true with respect to the firm size distribution, with many small firms co-existing with a smaller 
number of very large firms (Bartelsman et al., 2013). 5 
Over the first-half of the 1990s, firm turnover rates (entry plus exit rates) in OECD countries were in the 
range of 15 to more than 20% in the business sector (see Bartelsman, Haltiwanger and Scarpetta 2004). 
Meanwhile, average annual gross job reallocation – the sum of job creation and job destruction between t– ECO/WKP(2014)23 9 that resource reallocation is always desirable – shifting resources also entails costs for firms, workers and 
governments – and excessive reallocation is no more desirable than the persistent trapping of resources in 
inefficient activities. Nevertheless, continuous reallocation is a key feature of well-functioning market 
economies and aggregate productivity will be improved if resources are reallocated away from less 
productive to more productive businesses and activities over time. The key mechanisms through which this 
process occurs are firm turnover (i.e. entry and exit), shifts in resources across incumbent firms and 
resource reallocation within firms. 11. 
Empirical evidence suggests that, over time, resources tend to be reallocated toward more 
productive activities. Most existing studies tend to focus on labour. For instance, while the leading 
cross-country study finds that within-firm improvements in performance account for the majority of 
aggregate labour productivity growth over a five-year window, the contribution from firm entry and exit is 
estimated to reach at least 20% in some OECD countries (the estimates are higher for emerging countries), 
while that from reallocation of labour across existing enterprises is generally small, but positive 
(Bartelsman et al., 2004; OECD, 2003). 6 Within-countries studies show the importance of reallocation 
through entry, exit and market share gains by more productive firms via market selection. For example, 
Disney et al., (2003) show that for the United Kingdom this reallocation accounts for more than 80% of 
aggregate total factor productivity growth in the manufacturing sector, while decompositions of labour 
productivity for the Canadian economy as a whole and the United States retail sector yield similar 
conclusions. 7 There is also considerable heterogeneity across firms in their ability to use capital 
productively and existing studies show that capital – as measured by acquisitions of property, plant and 
equipment – also tends to flow from less productive firms to more productive firms (Eisfeldt and Rampini, 
2006; Jovanovic and Rousseau, 2002). 12. 
Recent evidence suggests that resources flow towards firms that patent at the expense of non-
patenting firms. Studies exploiting firm level longitudinal data from the United States suggest that 
patenting – also a proxy for innovation – tends to be associated with important changes within firms, e.g., 
increases in firm size, scope, and skill and capital intensity observed after firms patent (see 
Balasubramanian and Sivadasan, 2011). With respect to the intensive margin (i.e. differences amongst 
patenting firms), a 10% increase in patent stock is associated with about a 1.5% increase in value added, a 
1.7% increase in capital stock, and a 1.4% increase in employment over the sample period 1975 to 1997. 
The impact of patenting on total factor productivity (TFP), however, tends to be small or insignificant. This 
may reflect the possibility that new ideas – as proxied by increases in the patent stock – take a longer time 
to affect productivity, since firms typically need to undertake organisational restructuring (Bloom and Van 
Reenen, 2010; David and Wright, 2003; Pozzi and Schivardi, 2012) and attract complementary tangible 
resources in order to implement and commercialise new ideas (Andrews and Criscuolo, 2013). 8 1 and t – was about 22% of dependent employment in the business sector between 1997 and 2004 (see 
OECD, 2009a) 6 
These estimates are likely to understate the contribution of reallocation since the direct contribution of net 
entry is reinforced by an indirect effect whereby incumbents raise their own productivity to maintain 
market share in the face of strong entry pressures (see Aghion, et al., 2007). And, the contribution from 
reallocation – particularly net entry – tends to increase when the analysis is conducted over longer time 
horizons (Foster et al., 2001; Bartelsman et al., 2004). 7 
Baldwin and Gu (2006) for Canada find that this reallocation accounts for about 70% of aggregate labour 
productivity growth. Foster et al. (2006) find that entry and exit explain almost all labour productivity 
growth of the US retail sector. 8 
This lagged response of TFP may also reflect the fact that the patent stock is based on the year of 
application as opposed to the year in which the patent is ultimately granted. ECO/WKP(2014)23 10 13. 
Since the model controls for industry specific year fixed effects, these elasticities provide an 
estimate of the extent to which patenting is associated with higher activity at the firm level, relative to the 
average firm in the sector in a particular year, and are thus informative from a reallocation perspective. 
Balasubramanian and Sivadasan (2011) also explore the extensive margin by analysing how firms' 
economic characteristics change when they switch status from being a non-patentee to a patentee. Using an 
event study and a matching estimator, they find that first-time patentees record significant growth along a 
range of firm economic indicators relative to a control group of non-patenting firms that displayed similar 
pre-treatment characteristics. 14. 
Looking at all factors of production, Kogan et al., (2012) find strong patterns of reallocation 
towards innovating firms (the extent of which is determined by the stock market response to news about 
patents), and away from firms that do not innovate as proxied by patenting activity. For instance, an 
increase in patenting by a firm from the 50th to the 90th percentile of the innovation distribution increases 
a firm's physical capital investment rate by 0.4-0.9 percentage points, which is economically significant 
given the sample median firm investment rate of 10% (see column 1 from Table below). Moreover, for 
firms that do not innovate, a one standard deviation increase in the level of innovation by a firm's 
competitor triggers a decline of 1.2-1.6 percentage points in that firm's investment rate. Innovation also 
triggers similar patterns of reallocation for both labour and financial capital (columns 2 and 3), and similar 
patterns have also been identified using data for Denmark (Lentz and Mortensen 2008). Table 1. Innovation and reallocation in the United States Notes: To estimate the economic magnitude of firm-level technological innovations, Kogan et al., (2012) use stock market responses 
to news about patents over the period 1926-2007. Net capital inflows are calculated as: debt issuance plus equity issuance minus 
payout (and are normalised by assets). Source: Kogan et al., (2012). 15. 
Before proceeding, it is important to note that while the results from both aforementioned studies 
demonstrate the important relationship between patenting and firm size, the authors are careful not to 
attach a causal interpretation to their findings. One specific concern is that increases in – latent or explicit – 
demand for certain products might spur growth in both patenting and firm size in some firms but not 
others. 9 As discussed in Section 4.1.3, there are also likely to be other sources of endogeneity and to the 
best of our knowledge, few – if any – papers in the literature control for such biases. Accordingly, a key 
contribution of this paper is to present instrumental variables estimates of the impact of patenting on firm 
size. 9 
The demand-pull channel for innovation was first proposed by Schmookler (1966) and is part of some 
models of endogenous technological change (for example, Acemoglu & Linn 2004). ECO/WKP(2014)23 11 2.2 
The links between reallocation and innovation 16. 
Despite the emergence of this US literature, cross-country evidence on the extent to which 
patenting firms can attract labour and capital is scarce. More systematic cross-country evidence on 
resource flows to innovative firms is clearly desirable, particularly in light of the close links between 
investments in knowledge-based capital (KBC) and innovation and reallocation mechanisms (see Andrews 
and Criscuolo, 2013). 17. 
Recent research demonstrates the growing importance of KBC as a potential source of 
productivity gains, and the contribution of efficient resource allocation to this process. Indeed, the non-
rivalrous nature of knowledge means that the initial cost incurred in developing new ideas – typically 
through R&D – does not get re-incurred as the latter are combined with other inputs in the production of 
goods or services. This gives rise to increasing returns to scale – the important property that makes ideas 
and knowledge an engine of growth (Jones, 2005). Realising this growth potential, however, depends on 
the ability to reallocate labour and capital to their most productive use. 18. 
Andrews and de Serres (2012) explore these ideas from the perspective of an intangible-based 
start-up firm, where profitability depends not only on technological success but crucially on the ability to 
leverage the fixed cost of investments in intangibles – which are subject to strong returns to scale – through 
increases in the scale of production (Bartelsman and Groot, 2004). The ability to rapidly reallocate tangible 
resources, such as labour and physical capital, in order to capture the value of the investment before 
imitation by followers is therefore crucial for such firms. Likewise, in the event of technological failure, it 
is vital that firms experimenting with innovative activities can rapidly scale down operations to facilitate 
exit and thereby release resources that can be used by other firms. 10 19. 
In fact, it is increasingly being recognised that the growth potential of innovative firms is 
inversely related to the amount of resources that are absorbed by other less productive firms. In a 
heterogeneous firm model calibrated to US data, Acemoglu et al., (2013) show that policy intervention 
such as R&D tax subsidies are only truly effective when policy-makers can encourage the exit of  " low-
type "  incumbent firms, in order to free-up R&D resources (i.e. skilled labour) for innovative  " high-type "  
incumbents and entrants. This reflects the idea that low-type firms – despite their lack of innovativeness – 
still employ skilled labour to cover the fixed costs of operation, such as management and back-office 
operations. One implication is that a R&D subsidy will be fully capitalised into the high skilled wage rate – 
without a concomitant rise in innovation output (as suggested by Goolsbee, 1998) – unless the effective 
supply of high skilled labour can rise to meet additional demand via the downsizing and/or exit of  " low-
type "  firms. 20. 
Finally, the ability to rapidly redeploy tangible resources not only influences the returns to 
innovation but also the type of strategy firms employ to boost their own productivity, which will be shaped 
by their perceptions of the expected costs of implementing and commercialising new ideas and the ability 
to capitalise on the expected benefits. If the costs of reallocation are deemed to be too high, entrepreneurs 
may have to focus on incremental innovations, rather than experiment with disruptive technologies, 
because it will be more difficult to realise the benefits of risky technologies when successful and contain 
losses when unsuccessful (Bartelsman, 2004). In turn, some entrepreneurs might decide not to even enter 
the market as it might not be profitable or sustainable to enter with just an incremental innovation (Shane, 
2001; Bhide, 2000). Hence, the extent of specialisation in sectors that rely more on reallocation – such as 10 
This process is also necessary to provide the entrepreneur with sufficient space in order to experiment with 
alternative ideas. Indeed, this is consistent with anecdotal evidence that suggests that the most successful 
entrepreneurs have experienced some form of business failure in the past. ECO/WKP(2014)23 12 more innovative or ICT-intensive sectors – may vary across countries (Bartelsman et al., 2010), partly as a 
result of the efficiency of reallocation mechanisms. In sum, efficient reallocation mechanisms are likely to 
be particularly important for patenting firms to the extent that they shape the returns to innovation but also 
determine the feasibility of various innovation strategies. 2.3 
Public policy and resource flows to innovative firms 21. 
Emerging empirical evidence suggests that public policies can have important effects on the 
efficiency of resource allocation (Arnold et al., 2011; Bartelsman et al., 2013; Andrews and Cingano, 
2014; Bravo-Biosca et al., 2013). Andrews and Cingano (2014) construct estimates of static allocative 
efficiency at the industry level for a large sample of OECD countries, and show that more stringent 
regulations affecting product and labour markets and bankruptcy laws that excessively penalise business 
failure are associated with less efficient resource allocation. Similarly, Bravo-Biosca et al., (2013) show 
that these policy settings as well as less developed financial markets tend to be associated with a less 
dynamic distribution of firm employment in a small sample of OECD countries, while Aghion et al., 
(2007) highlight the importance of financial development for post-entry employment growth. These 
papers, however, are unable to address the question of how policies shape the growth prospects of the most 
innovative firms, since they aggregate firm level data to the sectoral level. 22. 
With this background in mind, the strength of the link between resource flows to patenting firms 
and relevant policy and institutional factors is explored, with a specific focus on: @BULLET Product market regulations (PMR): cumbersome PMR might raise the cost structure of inputs 
and/or lower the quality of inputs that are required by innovative firms to underpin their 
expansion (Arnold et al., 2011). 11 More broadly, if regulations restrict the extent of competition 
through higher barriers to entry, there is likely to be less pressure on incumbent firms to allocate 
resources efficiently. Finally, PMR that create barriers to trade and investment may make it more 
difficult for patenting firms to attract capital. @BULLET Employment protection legislation (EPL): more stringent EPL may hinder the reallocation of 
workers across firms, thus making it more difficult for patenting firms to attract resources. By 
raising exit costs, strict EPL may also make firms less willing to rapidly scale-up production to 
capitalise on an idea which has uncertain returns (Bartelsman et al., 2010). Given their stage of 
development this implies that young firms may be particularly sensitive to stringent EPL, and this 
effect will be reinforced if such regulations impose a fixed cost on firms and younger firms have 
fewer resources to absorb such costs. @BULLET Bankruptcy legislation: by increasing the costs associated with firm exit, bankruptcy laws that 
overly penalise failure may make entrepreneurs less willing to rapidly scale up production and 
result in valuable resources being trapped in inefficient firms, thereby making it more difficult for 
innovative firms to attract resources. 12 On the other hand, tighter bankruptcy laws imply a 
stronger guarantee for creditors, which may improve the supply of credit, thereby implying a 
theoretically ambiguous impact of bankruptcy laws on resource flows. 11 
For example, cumbersome PMR could raise the cost of reallocating resources through land-use regulations 
and overly cumbersome permitting processes, which may raise the costs of expanding production (e.g. 
opening new factories etc.). 12 
This effect will be reinforced if tight bankruptcy laws hamper entrepreneurship (by posing a greater burden 
on firms in the event of failure) and result in less firm entry than otherwise, therefore implying less 
competitive pressure on incumbents. ECO/WKP(2014)23 13 @BULLET Judicial efficiency: Legal systems that clearly assign and protect property rights and robust public 
institutions that provide a strong rule of law and contain corruption can support efficient resource 
allocation (Haltiwanger, 2011) and raise the returns to innovation. @BULLET Financial market development: a range of studies demonstrate the importance of financial 
markets for the efficiency of reallocation and innovative firms more generally (Aghion et al., 
2005). For example, deeper financial systems can underpin the post-entry growth of successful 
firms (Aghion et al., 2007) and are associated with a more dynamic distribution of firm growth 
(i.e. more growing and shrinking firms and fewer static firms) in industries that are highly 
dependent on external financing (Bravo-Biosca et al., 2012). @BULLET Seed and early stage venture capital: A key barrier to the growth of many KBC-based start-up 
firms is the inability to obtain external finance, due to difficulties in collateralising KBC. In some 
countries, the financing gap of young entrepreneurial firms is partly bridged by highly-
specialised financial intermediaries such as venture capitalists or business angels, who address 
informational asymmetries by intensively scrutinising firms before providing capital and 
monitoring them afterwards (Hall and Lerner, 2009). 3. 
Data 3.1 
Firm level data 23. 
The empirical analysis is based on two large micro level databases. The first one is the EPO 
Worldwide Patent Statistics Database (PATSTAT), containing detailed information on patent applications 
for over 80 patent offices. The second one is the firm-level commercial database ORBIS, developed by 
Bureau Van Dijk. This paper benefits from valuable additional elaboration on both datasets. These are the 
HAN database, providing a sophisticated matching of patent applicants in PATSTAT with companies in 
ORBIS based on string similarity; and the harmonised firm level dataset based on ORBIS, developed by 
Gal (2013) and Gonnard and Ragoussis (2013). 24. 
While patenting activity – as a proxy for innovation – carries the advantage of being relatively 
easy to measure and comparable across countries, it entails only a specific component of firms' innovation 
activity. Firms also employ a range of different strategies to manage and protect their intellectual assets, 
either as an alternative or as a complement to formal intellectual property (IP) rights. These include 
secrecy, confidentiality agreements, lead-time, complexity of design, the incorporation of specialist know-
how and open source methods (OECD, 2011). However, reliable data on these alternative IP strategies and 
related assets at the firm level are unavailable. At the same time, while patents sometimes are filed for or 
acquired for strategic reasons that are unrelated to technological innovation, restricting the empirical 
analysis to companies with 20 employees or more minimises the risk that so-called  " patent trolls "  (Bessen 
et al., 2011) are included in the sample. 25. 
Furthermore, there is now large and consolidated evidence supporting the role of patent statistics 
as a meaningful indicator of innovative activity at the firm level (see Nagaoka et al., 2010, and Hall and 
Harhoff, 2012, for recent surveys). Since Pakes and Griliches (1980), a number of papers proved the 
existence of a robust correlation between R&D activity and patenting (see Griliches, 1990, for a survey). 
More recently, survey evidence shows that 55% of new products are patented in Japan while the 
corresponding figure for the United States is 60% (Goto and Nagata, 1997). Accordingly, this paper 
focuses on patents to proxy the innovative capacity of the firm, but the above caveats should be kept in 
mind when interpreting the policy conclusions arising from the analysis. ECO/WKP(2014)23 14 26. 
Other firm-level variables come from the ORBIS database. Along with many advantages, this 
commercial dataset also carries a number of caveats. First, there is evidence that ORBIS is not necessarily 
representative of the underlying business population within a country, and that coverage varies over 
countries and time without any clear patterns (see Bravo-Biosca et al., 2012). This in turn introduces an 
important selection bias in our estimates. The required assumption for our estimates to hold is that 
patenting intensity does not affect the probability of being selected into the sample, conditional on firm 
fixed effects and on the wide set of sector*year*country fixed effects included in the main regressions. In 
other words, this requires that companies that change their patent stock to a similar extent are equally 
likely to be, or not to be, included in the sample, within the same country, sector, and year. There is not a 
direct way to test this assumption, but it appears reasonably plausible, since other factors that are 
controlled for in the analysis – e.g. age – are more likely to explain selection. 27. 
Secondly, when looking at the matched ORBIS-PATSTAT database, the sophistication and 
accuracy of the matching technique might not be sufficient to rule out the possibility of some measurement 
error in the patent stock variable assigned to ORBIS firms (e.g. as the probabilistic matching may lead to 
some  " false negative "  or  " false positive "  patent assignments). To the extent that these errors are 
uncorrelated with firm performance, the matching errors lead to random measurement error, attenuating 
estimates of the effect of patenting on firm performance toward zero. 28. 
The resulting dataset is a large cross-country firm-level dataset covering 23 countries. 
Information on firms' accounts from ORBIS starts in 1998, but coverage increases significantly since 
2003; the analysis therefore starts in that year, as pre-2002 information is likely to be affected by a stronger 
selection bias (see Table B1 for country coverage). Patent information was retrieved since the year 1980, 
which allows us to build the firms' patent history over the longer time period. For the analysis, the sample 
is restricted to companies with 20 or more employees at the start of the sample, if they are reported already, 
or at the time they appear for the first time. This is preferable to using average employment over the period 
as the latter criterion may lead to selection issues and amplify the impact of successful entrants. 29. 
In order to avoid double counting, balance sheet information from ORBIS is restricted to 
unconsolidated accounts; for a detailed description of consolidation and related issues in ORBIS see Gal 
(2013) and Gonnard and Ragoussis (2013). However, it is worth noting that many patent applications are 
filed at the group level and are officially assigned to the headquarter company, which implies that they 
may be excluded from the analysis, given that consolidated accounts are dropped. Thus, it becomes 
important to also account for patents at the level of the group. While ownership information is only 
partially reported in ORBIS, many of the missing links can be logically inferred from reported links (for 
example, if the ownership link of firm C with firm A is missing, this could be inferred if we know that firm 
A owns firm B, and that firm B owns firm C). Appendix A describes the methodology used to develop an 
ad-hoc algorithm which iteratively exploits available information to reconstruct the ownership tree of each 
company. In this way, it was possible to create a group identifier linking companies belonging to the same 
group and to calculate the group-level patent stock. 30. 
The measure of patent stock is based on the number of (eventually granted) patent applications to 
the three main patent offices: the USTPO, the EPO, and the WIPO. Robustness tests were performed such 
as including patents from other important national patent offices for which reliable information is available 
(i.e. the British, Canadian, German, French, and Japanese patent offices). The year of reference is the 
application year. The patent stock is calculated as the cumulative sum of the depreciated yearly patent 
count since 1980. The depreciation rate is the one most frequently used in the literature, equal to 15% per 
year (Hall et al., 2005). Different patent applications, however, can arise from the same  " inventive steps " , 
as companies may seek protection for the same ideas in many countries by filing the same patent at several 
patent offices. All patent applications referring to the same  " priority "  patent are defined as a  " patent 
family " . In order to take this issue into account, the company-level patent stock is also estimated based on ECO/WKP(2014)23 15 the count of distinct patent families, rather than distinct patents; the International Patent Documentation 
Centre (INPADOC) family definition has been adopted. 3.2 
Preliminary evidence 31. 
This section presents some descriptive statistics drawn from our dataset. All in all, figures tend to 
confirm three key stylised facts that have emerged from the literature: i) only a small percentage of firms 
patent; ii) these firms are often concentrated in a few key sectors; and iii) on average, patenting firms are 
very different with respect to their non-patenting counterparts, especially in terms of size, but also 
productivity. It is worth stressing that these aggregate statistics are only suggestive and should be 
interpreted with caution, as they might be prone to selection bias (see discussion in section 3.1 on the 
limitations of ORBIS) and because the sample excludes firms with less than 20 employees. Finally, the 
descriptive statistics in this section are limited to countries for which a significant number of patenting 
firms over the 2003-2010 period is reported in the dataset, which corresponds to a total of around 
2.8 million firms across 13 countries. 32. 
The left panel of Figure 1 reports the share of firms that own at least one patent in 2009 by 
country. While the share of firms that patent is close to or above 20% in United States and Germany, this 
figure is around 5% for most other countries in Figure 1. The right panel reports the corresponding statistic 
by (NACE Rev. 1.1) 2-digit sectors. The graph shows that there is also large heterogeneity across sectors, 
with manufacturing of chemicals – including pharmaceuticals – (NACE 24), machinery and equipment 
(NACE 29), and electrical and optical (NACE 30-33) showing as expected the largest patenting rates, all 
reporting a share of patenting firms of around 20%. Another stylised fact is that industries in 
manufacturing generally show a much higher patenting rate than in the service sector. Figure 1. Share of firms that patent by country and by 2-digit sector Selected OECD countries Panel A: Country 
Panel B: Industry Note: the sample is limited to companies and that have at least 20 employees in 2003 or at the time of their first appearance in the 
dataset and to countries for which at least 500 firms applied for a patent over the 2003-2010 period. Source: PATSTAT, OECD HAN Database, and OECD ORBIS. 33. 
Table 2 reports some summary statistics comparing the group of patenting firms with non-
patentees. Patentees are systematically larger than non-patentees, irrespectively of the indicator used which 
is consistent with existing research from the United States (Balasubramanian and Sivadasan, 2011): on 
average, comparing the simple means of the size variables (columns 1 and 4), turnover is larger by a factor ECO/WKP(2014)23 16 of 4; capital stock by a factor of 5; and employment by a factor of roughly 3. 13 Not surprisingly, patenting 
firms are also more capital intensive and show a higher level of labour productivity than non-patentees. 14 Table 2. Mean firm characteristics: patentees versus non-patentees Selected OECD countries, 2003-2010 Notes: The sample is limited to firms that are observed at least once in the ORBIS database between 2003 and 2010 and that have at 
least 20 employees in 2003 or at the time of their first appearance in the dataset. Patentees are defined as companies that have had 
at least one patent granted from the USTPO, the EPO, the WIPO, or other important national patent offices for which reliable 
information is available (i.e. the British, Canadian, German, French, and Japanese patent offices). *** denotes statistical significance

Empirical methodology 4.1 
Patent stock and firm size 34. 
To understand whether these cross-sectional differences between patenting and non-patenting 
firms reflect self-selection on pre-existing differences, the longitudinal structure of the database is 
exploited to explore how changes in firms' patenting status over time are associated with changes in firms' 
characteristics. 4.1.1 
The baseline model 35. 
Following Balasubramanian and Sivadasan (2011), the within-firm elasticity of firm 
characteristics (e.g. employment, capital, etc.) with respect to changes – or more specifically, deviations 
from firm-average – in the patent stock is estimated, based on the following fixed effects regression 
specification: isct

isct 
isct PatS 
Y ε 
µ 
η 
β +

+

) 
ln( 
ln 1 [1] 13 
These variables are logarithms of the original values, and hence the factor, say, for employment is 
computed as e1.034 = 2.8. 14 
Note that 4,524 observations with zero real capital stock are excluded from the fixed assets statistics. The 
real capital stock is calculated using the perpetual inventory method. See Gal (2013) for detail. ECO/WKP(2014)23 17 where Y is the economic characteristic (employment, capital, turnover) for firm i, in sector s, in country c 
at time t and PatS is the depreciated patent stock. The specification also includes firm fixed effects and 
industry*country*year fixed effects. As a robustness test and to explore longer run impacts, we also 
estimated equation (1) in long difference form – i.e., on a cross-sectional dataset formed by the 2009-2003 
difference of all variables. 36. 
Since the log-log specification would exclude all firms that have zero patents, in order to include 
in the sample observations with PatS equal to zero, the standard technique of taking the logarithm of 
1+PatS is applied; this implies that we cannot strictly interpret the estimated coefficients as elasticities. 
Since this may introduce a non-negligible bias, additional robustness tests show that the sign and the 
magnitude of the results do not change when firms with no patents are excluded (see Table B2, Panel A). 
The inclusion of zeros also implies that the estimated coefficient from equation [1] is a joint estimate of the 
extensive (i.e. what happens to firms when they switch from non-patentee to patentee status) and intensive 
(i.e. differences amongst patenting firms) margin and thus motivates an exploration of the extensive 
margin through an event study methodology, as outlined in Section 4.1.2. 37. 
Two different PatS variables are included in the regression in turn – patent applications to 
national offices and applications to the three most important patent offices (EPO, USTPO, and 
WIPO/PCT) but the results are not particularly sensitive to this choice. The latter group of patents is 
defined as  " regional "  patents. Only applications which are eventually granted are considered. The 
coefficient β is the estimated sensitivity of firm characteristics (e.g. employment) to the patent stock. 
Although technically β does not correspond to the elasticity due to the transformation described above, the 
size of the coefficient can be approximately interpreted as such. If β>0, increases in the stock of patents are 
associated with increases in firm employment, relative to the country-industry-year average. While this 
provides an indicator of the extent to which resources flow to more innovative firms, the estimated effect 
will also reflect other factors, including the quality of the underlying idea that is patented and the 
characteristics of the national patenting system. Finally, in Section 5.1.1, we introduce another measure of 
patent stock based on the patent portfolio of the group the company belongs to, since firms belonging to 
the same group may access the patent stock – and the knowledge base – of other affiliated firms 4.1.2 
The extensive margin 38. 
As a complement to the baseline results, a propensity score matching exercise aimed at exploring 
the extensive margin effect of patenting – i.e. what happens to firms when they switch from non-patentee 
to patentee status – is also performed in Section 5.1.2. The analysis is limited to the 4308 firms that apply 
for a patent for the first time in the middle years of the database, i.e. 2005 and 2006, in order to balance the 
pre-and post-treatment observation years. 39. 
Following Balasubramanian and Sivadasan (2011), every patentee is matched with the  " most 
similar "  non-patentee, which results in a sample of 8616 firms (i.e. 4308 patenting firms and 4308  " nearest 
neighbour "  non-patenting firms). The  " nearest neighbour "  non-patentee is the firm with the closest  " patent 
propensity "  score, that is, the probability of being a first-time patentee. 15 The propensity score is estimated 
in the years the patenting firms apply for their first patent via a cross-sectional Probit regression of the 
first-patent dummy on one-year lagged employment, capital, and turnover (as in equation 2a): t

The sample is restricted to companies observed for at least 6 years over the period 2002-2009. ECO/WKP(2014)23 18 40. 
The estimation of the propensity score in equation [2a] allow matching each first-time patentee to 
its closest non-patenting counterpart in terms of employment, capital, and turnover levels; that is, with the 
non-patenting firm with the most similar propensity score in the same year, 3-digits sector, age class (less 
than or equal to 10 years, or 11 years or above) and country. Subsequently, the following second-stage

patentee/non patentee pair, and τ is a year fixed effect. The inclusion of the patentee/non patentee pair 
fixed effect (γ) implies that the model only exploits variation between the two matched firms. Index is a set 
of 9 dummy variables which are equal to one in the n th year before or after the patentee's patent is applied 
for, with n=(-4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4). Note that n is equal to 0 in the year the patent is applied for. These 
nine dummies take the same values for both patentees and non-patentees and control for time trends around 
the year of first patenting. Finally, the first term on the right-hand side of the equation – i.e. the interaction 
of the index dummies with the patentee dummy – are  " switched on "  only for patentees. Thus, β 1j – the 
main coefficients of interest – allow for different trends in the outcome variables both before and after the 
first patent is applied for. If, as it is the case in the estimates presented, the β 1j coefficients are significantly 
different from zero only for non-negative n, i.e. only from the year of application onward, on>0 this will 
confirm that significant patentee/non-patentee differences emerge only after the first patent has been 
applied for. 4.1.3 
Instrumental variables estimation 41. 
The baseline econometric model outlined in Section 4.1.1 quantifies the within-firm sensitivity 
of firm characteristics (e.g. employment, capital, etc.) with respect to changes – or more specifically, 
deviations from firm-average – in the patent stock, conditional on a wide set of time variant country-
industry dummies. However, this approach does not necessarily provide a causal estimate of the effect of 
patenting on firm size to the extent that the positive association might reflect the positive impact of 
unobservable or omitted factors on both patenting and firm size. For example, firms that are endowed with 
a more skilled workforce or have better management might patent more, and at the same time grow more 
for reasons independent from their patenting activity. Moreover, a reverse causality channel can also be in 
place: firms that manage to attract more resources for reasons which are unrelated to patenting might be 
able to funnel some of these resources into their patenting activity. 42. 
Controlling for these potential sources of endogeneity requires an instrumental variable that is 
correlated with changes in firms' patenting activity, but does not affect firm growth beyond its impact on 
patenting. A potentially promising approach to instrument firms' depreciated patent stock is to exploit 
yearly data on patent litigation in different technology fields. The working hypothesis underlying this 
approach is that the likelihood of patent litigation in the technological fields in which a firm specialises 
may negatively influence the firm's propensity to patent, since it might proxy for the expected exposure of 
a patent in that field to litigation and its associated costs. For an instrument to be valid, it has to be both 
relevant and exogenous. 43. 
In this case, the validity builds on the interplay between two factors: firms' technological inertia 
and the non-negligible time variation in litigation cases across different technologies. More specifically, 
firms tend to exhibit a fair degree of inertia in their technological specialization. Even if the environment in 
which they operate becomes significantly less profitable, it is generally not easy or cost-efficient to start 
innovating and patenting in different technological fields. At the same time, both data (see Figure B1 in 
Appendix B) and anecdotal evidence suggest that patent litigation has shown significantly different time ECO/WKP(2014)23 19 patterns across technologies in the last decade, with some technological classes experiencing sudden bursts 
in the number of litigation cases and others showing a more linear pattern. As a consequence of the 
interaction of those two factors – the technological inertia and the significant time variation in litigation 
across fields – some firms exogenously find their prospective patent portfolio potentially more exposed to 
litigation risks, which in turn decreases their incentives to develop new patents. The exogeneity assumption 
also requires that changes in litigation propensity do not affect changes in firm's employment and capital 
through other channels conditional on country-year and industry-year dummies – an assumption that seems 
plausible. 44. 
Therefore, we develop a two-stage least square (2SLS) estimation strategy, where in the first 
stage we regress the firm's patent stock on a firm-specific, time-variant measure of litigation propensity, 
which is our instrumental variable. Operationally, the instrument for firm i at time t is defined as: 񮽙񮽙 񮽙񮽙 = ∑ ℎ  *  _____ 񮽙񮽙 񮽙 [3] Where: @BULLET share is the share of patents in each 4-digit IPC class k within the firm's patent portfolio applied 
for before the start of the period of analysis. As most patents are allocated to more than one IPC 
class, the share is calculated on patent fractional count, where each patent is weighted 1/N, where 
N is the total number of IPC classes the patent is classified in. For those companies not patenting 
before 2003 (around 10% of the sample), we build the IPC shares based on patents applied for in 
the first year of the firm's patenting activity in which at least 3 different IPC classes appear in the 
PATSTAT dataset. @BULLET Litig_prop is the sum of all patents litigated in a given year, divided by the stock of patents 
applied for in the same years. For example, if in year 2005 the data show that 20 patents have 
been litigated, of which 10 have been applied for in 1995 and 10 in 2000, and the total number of 
patents applied for in 1995 and 2000 is 50 and 100, respectively, the value of Litig_prop for the 
year 2005 would be equal to 10/50+10/100=3/10. 45. 
Litigation data are sourced from a commercial database created and maintained by Darts-IP. 16 To 
the best of our knowledge, the dataset was first used and described by van Zeerbroeck and Graham (2011). 
Figure B1 (see Appendix B) illustrates the time trends in litigations over the period 2003-2009 for the top 
10% IPC 4-digit classes and clearly demonstrates that there is a significant variation over time in litigation 
events within technological classes. 16 
The Darts-IP dataset covers judgments across different Court levels (first instance, appeal, Supreme Court), 
based on manual collection in courts. As a consequence, the unit of observation is the court decision, not 
the case filing; in some countries some cases may be dropped before reaching a judgement, so the number 
of court decisions can be lower than the (unobserved) number of patent suit filings. According to the data 
provider, the coverage is not universal: while in bigger countries like US, France and UK the coverage is 
close to 100% of the decisions, in other countries it reaches the 70-80%, and increases over time. ECO/WKP(2014)23 20 4.2 
Identifying the role of public policies 4.2.1 
The baseline model 46. 
The role of policies in explaining the observed cross-country differences in the magnitude of 
these flows is explored by introducing interaction terms between the firm-level patent stock and framework

1 [3] where P refers to various framework policies (see Table 3), which are first included in the regression 
separately. For ease of interpretation, each policy variable (i.e. P) is re-scaled to equal zero for the United 
States (i.e. the US value has been subtracted from each observation of the policy variable) so that β 1 can be 
interpreted as the US-specific estimated effect. All other terms are identical to those in the baseline 
specification outlined in equation [1]. 47. 
While equation [3] explores how policies shape the impact of changes in the patenting stock on 
firm size for the average firm in the sample, there are reasons to suspect that the impact of policies may 
vary with the characteristics of the firm. For example, regulations that impose a fixed cost on firms may 
disproportionately affect young firms that typically have fewer resources to absorb such costs. Moreover, 
to the extent that younger firms have a comparative advantage in radical innovations (see Henderson, 
1993; Tushman and Anderson, 1986), evidence that policies have a disproportionate effect on younger 
firms is likely to be of particular interest to policymakers. Thus, to explore the extent to which policies 
have heterogeneous effects according to the firm's age, the following equation is estimated: isct

5 years of age in 2006, and zero otherwise. The age of a firm is based on a firm's date of incorporation in 
ORBIS. All other terms are identical to those in the baseline specification outlined in equation [3]. 4.2.2 
Differences in differences estimation 48. 
To test the robustness of the baseline policy estimates, we explore whether the magnitude of the 
impact of policies that shape the impact of patenting on firm size is stronger in sectors that are more likely 
to be exposed to the policy at hand, due to their inherent technological characteristics. This approach, 
popularised by Rajan and Zingales (1998), is based on the assumption that there exist industries that have 
'naturally' high exposure to a given policy (i.e. the treatment group), and such industries – to the extent 
that the policy is relevant to the outcome of interest – should be disproportionally more affected than other 
industries (i.e. the control group). In other words, identification will be obtained comparing the differential 
impact of patenting on firm characteristics (e.g. employment) between highly exposed industries and 
marginally exposed industries in countries with different policy settings. While this approach does not 
provide an estimate of the average effect of the policy of interest as in the baseline model (Section 4.2.1), it 
nonetheless represents a useful robustness test to the core policy conclusions. ECO/WKP(2014)23 21 Table 3. Policy variables, structural factors and relevant industry characteristics in difference-in-differences

1 [5] As is typical in this type of framework, the specification allows the impact of PatS on Y to vary according 
to the country and sector by including interaction terms between PatS and: (i) a vector of country dummies ECO/WKP(2014)23 22 (C); and (ii) a vector of sectoral dummies (S). The specification also controls for firm fixed effects and 
sector, country and year fixed effects. The parameter of interest is δ 1 . For example, if P corresponds to 
Employment Protection Legislation (EPL) and δ 1 <0, then the adverse effect of stringent EPL on the 
responsiveness of firm characteristics to patenting is stronger in more exposed sectors – such as those with 
high job layoff rates – than less exposed sectors. 50. 
Industry-level indexes of exposure are taken from the large literature exploiting a similar 
framework to infer the relevance of country-level policies on a number of economic outcomes. The 
exposure indexes are generally computed from US data to the extent that the United States is generally 
perceived to be a low regulation (i.e.  " frictionless " ) country. Accordingly, the United States is excluded 
from the analysis. See Table 3 for details on the country-level policy variables of interest and the 
corresponding industry-level exposure variables used in the difference-in-differences estimator. 4.3 
Identification concerns 51. 
Before proceeding, a number of caveats should be kept in mind when interpreting the results. 
First, the paper's primary aim is to highlight some potentially informative cross-country empirical 
regularities using the estimation approach in Balasubramanian and Sivadasan (2011), but this approach 
does not specifically address the issue of causality. While the instrumental variables estimator described in 
Section 4.1.3 makes some progress on this front, the results (discussed in Section 5.1.3) only focus on the 
link between patenting and firm size, and do not focus on how public policies might shape this 
relationship. That said, an effort is made to reproduce the main policy conclusions using alternative 
estimation frameworks – which might be less susceptible to endogeneity problems (such as differences-in-
differences estimation) – in order to improve the credibility of the policy recommendations, though further 
work in this area is clearly required. 52. 
Second, due to the nature of the underlying data, national borders are imposed on firms. For 
example, a firm is assigned to each country in which an unconsolidated account is published, and different 
accounts in different countries are treated as different firms. Although an alternative patent measure based 
on patents at group level is utilised (as described above), the increasingly international dimension of many 
businesses may still affect the results. For instance, countries with many multinational enterprises (MNEs) 
may see most of the occupational gains from patenting to occur in production sites located abroad, and the 
intensity of this effect may correlate negatively with the country's size and openness (assuming that small 
open economies are more likely to offshore production). Since an exploration of the within-firm and 
cross-country effect of patenting is beyond the scope of this paper, the effects studied in this paper are thus 
bounded by national borders, although as discussed in Section 6, we do make an (albeit crude) attempt to 
control for this issue. 53. 
Third, the number of variables used to proxy a firm's inputs and output is limited, and patenting 
may affect the firm's production structure along other unobserved dimensions (e.g. skill intensity, product 
scope or the within-firm wage distribution). This issue is difficult to address given existing data sources 
and thus the quantification of the extent to which firms adjust to the patent stock is limited to a set of 
standard variables. 54. 
Finally, the extent to which firms react to a change in patent stock may also depend on the quality 
of the patent system and the level of enforcement of IP rights. The former source of heterogeneity should 
not be a major concern, since the estimates are remarkably stable across specifications based on patents 
filed at international or national patent offices, respectively. The latter source of country heterogeneity is 
partly dealt with by the inclusion of measures of civil justice efficiency among the policy variables 
analysed; however, some countries have specialised courts for IP disputes, whose efficiency may not be 
correctly measured by the general civil justice indicators. ECO/WKP(2014)23 23 5. 
Empirical results 5.1 
Do resources flow to patenting firms? 5.1.1 
Baseline results 55. 
The upper panel of Table 4 shows the estimated sensitivity of firm characteristics with respect to 
the patent stock (based on a depreciated patent count). 17 The results show a statistically significant link 
between patenting and firm size. For example, for the average firm in the sample, the estimates imply that 
a 10% increase in the patent stock is associated with about a 1% increase in employment, a 1.3% increase 
in the capital stock, a 0.3% increase in capital intensity, a 1.2% increase in turnover, and a 0.5% rise in 
value-added. The association between patenting and productivity is small and positive, but not statistically 
significant, which is broadly consistent with Balasubramanian and Sivadasan (2011). Table 4. Sensitivity of firm characteristics with respect to the patent stock: baseline estimates Selected OECD countries, 2003-2010 using yearly variation Notes: Robust standard errors clustered at the firm level in parenthesis. Patent stock is calculated as the log(X+1) where X is the 
cumulated number of USTPO, EPO, or PCT granted patents since the 1980 depreciated at the rate 15% per year. Patent stock -
Families stock is calculated as the log(X+1) where X is the depreciated number of individual patent families (INPADOC classification). 
***, **, * denotes statistical significance at the 1%, 5% and 10% levels respectively. Data on value added is less widely available than 
turnover due to missing data on intermediate inputs; the lower coefficient for value-added compared to turnover largely reflects the 
more limited sample. The TFP estimates are based on Wooldridge (2009) procedure with imputations based on industry averages for 
missing data; see Gal (2013) for details. 56. 
As a robustness check of the estimates, equation [1] was re-estimated solely for the United States 
manufacturing sector and compared to the estimates in Balasubramanian and Sivadasan (2011). While 
analysis in this paper is based on a lower quality data set and refers to a later time period than in the 17 
Given the wide set of fixed effects included and the sheer size of the dataset, regressions are incomputable 
with a standard PC and traditional panel fixed-effect procedures. Therefore, estimates are obtained through 
an algorithm for estimation of a linear regression model with two high dimensional fixed effects 
implemented in STATA by Guimaraes and Portugal (2010). ECO/WKP(2014)23 24 aforementioned study, it is reassuring that the results from this exercise were in the same ballpark to those 
presented in Balasubramanian and Sivadasan (2011). 18 57. 
The lower panel of table 4 shows that the estimates are almost identical when an alternative 
measure of the patent stock, based on the depreciated count of distinct patent families, is employed. A 
patent family is a group of patents, granted by different patent offices, which share the same priority 
application. 19 Patent families may be a better proxy for innovative ideas, as companies generally tend to 
patent the same inventions to many distinct patent offices around the world. 58. 
Table 5 shows the results from a long difference specification – i.e. just a cross-section of 
2009-2003 differences. 20 Long differences might better pick up long-run effects to the extent that they are 
less subject to measurement error than year-to-year differences or fixed effects specifications, but they may 
also exacerbate selection bias since only surviving firms are included. While the coefficient estimates in 
the first four columns of Table 5 for employment, capital, capital intensity and turnover are similar or 
somewhat larger to the corresponding coefficients in Table 4, the coefficient on value added is two-to-three 
times larger in the long difference specification relative to the baseline estimates. At the same time, the 
coefficient on the patent stock in the TFP regression becomes statistically significant at conventional 
levels. The estimates imply that – for the average firm in the sample – a 10% increase in the patent stock is 
associated with a 2-2½% increase in TFP, depending on the specification (see Tables 5 and B3). This 
effect is significant at the 5% level in the specification based on the sample for which data is available for 
all firms (see Table B3). While these results should be interpreted with caution given the well-known 
problems with estimating TFP at the firm-level (see Gal, 2013), they are nonetheless consistent with the 
idea that the impact of new ideas on productivity may take some time to be realised, possibly reflecting the 
need for organisational restructuring. 18 
These results are not presented for sake of brevity and are available from the authors on request. 19 
The classification of patent families is based on the INPADOC definition. 20 
The year 2009 (rather than the latest available year 2010) was chosen in order to maximise the number of 
observations in the long differences equation. ECO/WKP(2014)23 25 Table 5. Sensitivity of firm characteristics with respect to the patent stock: long differences Selected OECD countries, 2003-2009 Notes: Robust standard errors clustered at the firm level in parenthesis. All variables are calculated as the difference between the 
2009 and the 2003 value, and the sample is limited to firms for which data are available in both years. Patent stock is calculated as 
the log(X+1) where X is the cumulated number of USTPO, EPO, or PCT granted patents since the 1980 depreciated at the rate 15% 
per year. Patent stock -Families stock is calculated as the log(X+1) where X is the depreciated number of individual patent families 
(INPADOC classification). ***, **, * denotes statistical significance at the 1%, 5% and 10% levels respectively. Data on value added is 
less widely available than turnover due to missing data on intermediate inputs; the lower coefficient for value-added compared to 
turnover largely reflects the more limited sample. The TFP estimates are based on Wooldridge (2009) procedure with imputations 
based on industry averages for missing data; see Gal (2013) for details. 59. 
Table 6 introduces another measure of patent stock based on the patent portfolio of the group the 
company belongs to. This is potentially important since firms belonging to the same group may access the 
patent stock – and the knowledge base – of other affiliated firms. While the resulting ownership structure is 
still likely to be incomplete due to the underlying data limitations, the results of this exercise show that 
patents at the group level are indeed positively associated with firm performance, although the coefficients 
of the firm's patent stock are not affected by the inclusion of the new variable. This result suggests that 
within-group knowledge flows provide an additional source of comparative advantage for firms belonging 
to a group. In fact, it is consistent with a large literature on multinational enterprises, which suggests that 
blueprints and knowledge that are replicable at a low cost within the group constitute the key advantage for 
these firms over and above the more intensive use of researchers and larger R&D expenditure (Dunning, 
1981; Markusen, 2004; Criscuolo et al., 2010). ECO/WKP(2014)23 26 Table 6. Sensitivity of firm characteristics with respect to the patent stock: group patents Selected OECD countries, 2003-2009 using yearly variation Notes: Robust standard errors clustered at the firm level in parenthesis. The patent stock is calculated as the log(X+1) where X is the 
cumulated number of USTPO, EPO and PCT granted patents since the 1980 depreciated at the rate 15% per year. The group patent 
variable is calculated in the same way based on the patent stock of other affiliates of the same group. See appendix B for details on 
the group definition. The sample is limited to the period 2003-2009 as ownership information is not available for the year 2010. ***, **, 
* denotes statistical significance at the 1%, 5% and 10% levels respectively. The TFP estimates are based on Wooldridge (2009) 
procedure with imputations based on industry averages for missing data procedure; see Gal (2013) for details. 60. 
Thus far, the results suggest that patenting is associated with real changes in economic activity at 
the firm level across a sample of selected OECD countries. If the observed increases in size are indeed 
linked to patenting, it is reasonable to expect a correlation between the magnitude of size increases and the 
underlying quality of the patent. To test this idea, an interaction between the patent stock and citation-
based measures of the average quality of patents filed by the firm are added to equation [1]. These 
measures include (see Squicciarini et al., 2010): i)  " Radicalness " : the number of different International 
Patent Classification (IPC) classes cited that are different from the one the patent belongs to (i.e. radical 
patents are those who bring insights from different technologies); and ii) the number of citations to the 
non-patent literature (NPL), which proxies for the closeness of patents to science. 61. 
The results are outlined in Table 7 in a relatively smaller sample of countries since it was not 
possible to construct patent quality measures for all countries (these estimates are based on EPO patents). 
Relative to the baseline estimates that utilise a simple measure of patent counts, the results show that 
increases in the radicalness-weighted patent stock is associated with larger increases in each firm 
characteristic considered. These results correspond closely to the findings presented later in the paper, 
which show that young firms are both more likely to file radical patents and demonstrate a higher 
sensitivity of firm size to patenting than older firms (see Table 10, Panel A). At the same time, the 
NPL-weighted patent stock is associated with a similar or marginally smaller impact on all size measures 
except the capital to labour ratio. Overall, these results are consistent with the interpretation that size 
changes accompanying patenting are related to innovation at the firm level. ECO/WKP(2014)23 27 Table 7. Sensitivity of firm characteristics with respect to the patent stock: controlling for patent quality European OECD countries, 2003-2010 using yearly variation Notes: Robust standard errors clustered at the firm level in parenthesis. The patent stock is calculated as the log(X+1) where X is the 
cumulated number of granted patents since the 1980 depreciated at the rate 15% per year. ***, **, * denotes statistical significance at 
the 1%, 5% and 10% levels respectively. The TFP estimates are based on Wooldridge (2009) procedure with imputations based on 
industry averages for missing data procedure; see Gal (2013) for details. 5.1.2 
An event study of the extensive margin 62. 
As a complement to the within-firm analysis presented in Section 5.1.1, this section reports 
results from the estimation of equation [2b] which compares the post-patent performance of the first-time 
patentees with a control group of non-patentee firms. This model essentially estimates the extensive margin 
of patenting, i.e., the change in firm performance associated with the switch from being a non-patentee to 
being a patentee firm. It is important to acknowledge that the data requirements of this exercise are quite 
stringent and as such, the sample size is much smaller than in the baseline analysis. 21 Partly for this reason, 
the results from this exercise should be treated only as suggestive and interpreted with some caution. 63. 
As explained in Section 4.1.2, the extensive margin is estimated by pairing each first time 
patentee with an otherwise similar non patentee, and by comparing their performance before and after the 
first patent has been filed for by the patentee. If significant differences emerge in the outcome variable 21 
The sample is limited to firms that appear at least 6 times between 2002 and 2009 and which belong to 
countries with at least 100 observations. Among those, there are 784 first time patentees in the year 2005 or 
2006. Each of them is matched to a similar non-patentee; the final sample therefore amounts to 1568 firms 
observed over a maximum of 9 years. ECO/WKP(2014)23 28 from the year in which the patent application is filed – but not in preceding years – this would suggest that 
resources tend to flow to firms that patent for the first time (in addition to firms that already patent and 
increase the size of their patent stock). 64. 
The coefficients' estimates are shown in Table B4 of Appendix B and are more intuitively 
illustrated in Figure 2. The figure shows that, one year after the first patent, patentees have on average 5% 
more employees and 10% more fixed capital than a non-patentee with similar inputs endowment over the 
four previous years. Two years after the first patent, the difference is around 9% for employment, and 12% 
for capital. These differences are statistically significant and increase over time, while in the years before 
patenting, there a no significant differences in these outcome variables. Overall, these results provide 
further support for the idea that the size changes accompanying patenting are related to innovation at the 
firm level. Figure 2. Event study analysis of first time patentees relative to closest peer Propensity score matching estimator based on first-time patent filers in 2005-2006; average effect across countries in

patentees and non-patentees. Dotted lines report 5% confidence interval. The estimated coefficients are reported in Table B4. 5.1.3 
Instrumental variables estimation 65. 
To check whether the link between patenting and firm size is causal, Table 8 presents the IV 
estimates where the firm patent stock is instrumented by the litigation propensity indicator developed in 
Section 4.1.3. The first stage regression output in Panel C shows a statistically significant relationship 
between the  " technological field weighted "  exposure of firms to litigation risk and the firm patent stock, 
thereby demonstrating the strength of the instrument. The IV estimates in Panel B confirm that there is a 
statistically significant relationship between the patent stock and firm size. As discussed in Appendix C, 
these results are robust to a falsification test (Panel D of Table 8), which suggests that the second stage 
results are unlikely to be biased by a long-run firm specific trend that is correlated with both the 
technological specialisation of the firm in the pre-sample period and its economic activity during the period 
of analysis. While this suggests that the baseline relationship can be interpreted as causal, the magnitude of 
the IV coefficients is larger than the OLS estimates shown in Panel A and the IV estimates are clearly less 
precise as demonstrated by the size of the standard errors. Nevertheless, the significance of the IV 
estimates is encouraging and future work will focus on further refining this approach. ECO/WKP(2014)23 29 Table 8.

For computation reasons, the sample is limited only to firms with

and 10% levels respectively. 5.2 
Cross-country differences in resource flows to patenting firms 66. 
The results in Section 5.1 show that on average across a sub-sample of OECD countries, 
patenting is associated with real changes in economic activity at the firm level. In this section, the extent to 
which resource flows to patenting firms vary across countries is explored. One simple – albeit relatively 
crude – way to do this is to interact the patent stock – i.e. PatS in equation (1) – with various country 
dummies. The estimated coefficients (reported in Table B5 of Appendix B) capture the average country-
specific relationship between patenting and resource flows over the sample period. Of course, it is 
important to note that this exercise is implemented for purely illustrative purposes and provides only an Capital /

ESTIMATION Patent stock (firm) -OLS Patent stock (firm) -IV Patent litigation propensity ECO/WKP(2014)23 30 average correlation over the period. When identifying the impact of policies in Section 5.3, what generally 
matters is how these relationships change over time at the firm level. 67. 
With the above caveats in mind, Figure 3 uses these estimated coefficients for a selected set of 
countries to calculate the association between a 10% change in the patent stock and the change in capital 
and employment, for the average firm in our sample. While not all country-specific estimates are 
statistically different from one another – that is, the standard errors are relatively wide in some cases – 
some interesting cross-country differences nonetheless emerge when the focus in narrowed to the more 
precisely estimated effects. For example, a 10% increase in the firm level patent stock is associated with 
about a 3% rise in firm capital in Sweden and the United States; a 1½-2% increase in firm capital in the 
UK, Japan and Germany; and a ½-¾ % rise in firm capital in Italy (Figure 3; Panel A). Similarly, the ease 
with which patenting firms in the United States can attract labour is roughly twice as large as the average 
OECD country (Figure 3; Panel B). Figure 3. Cross-country differences in resource flows to patenting firms? Change in firm inputs associated with a 10% change in patent stock; selected OECD countries (2003-2010) A: Capital B. Employment Notes: The black dot shows the country-specific point estimate of eq. (1), while the grey bands denote the 90% confidence interval 
(note that the confidence intervals vary across countries due to differences in the number of observations). The same estimates are 
reported in Table B5 of Appendix B. The sample is restricted to countries in which at least 300 new patents are granted over the 
sample period and/or the country-specific coefficients are statistically different from zero. ECO/WKP(2014)23 31 68. 
These patterns bear some resemblance to cross-country differences in post-entry employment 
dynamics, which illustrate that young firms in the United States – and to a lesser extent, Sweden – exhibit 
 " up-or-out "  dynamics (Haltiwanger et al., 2013; Criscuolo et al., 2014). That is, young firms either: 
i) grow very rapidly; or ii) they fail and exit the market rather than remaining in business as low-
performing small firms, suggesting that market selection is very harsh and reallocation significant in such 
environments. By contrast, the potential growth of firms in Southern European countries – particularly 
Italy – is much lower, which tends to manifest itself in a high share of old and small firms, which tend to 
be less innovative. From a policy perspective, this predominance of old and small firms raises the risk that 
valuable resources (e.g. human and physical capital) are clogged up in undersized and inefficient firms, 
which in turn makes it more difficult for high productivity firms to attract resources and grow (Acemoglu 
et al., 2013), bearing on aggregate productivity developments.69. At the same time, a number of somewhat 
surprising results emerge which may reflect the limitations of this analysis. For instance, the low sensitivity 
of resources to patenting in countries such as Denmark and Finland (see Table B5) may reflect the fact that 
firms in small open economies may expand abroad rather than domestically, but it is difficult to capture 
this margin of adjustment with the available data. Additional analysis suggests that patenting has a larger 
effect on average profitability and wages than firm size in these countries, but this cannot explain all of the 
observed differences. 5.3 
Role of public policy 5.3.1 
Baseline results 70. 
Table 9 summarises the estimation results of equation [3] for two dependent variables – 
employment and capital – when one policy interaction is included at a time. As already mentioned, each 
policy variable has been re-scaled to equal zero for the United States. Thus, the coefficient on PatS can be 
interpreted as the US-specific effect, while the interaction term PatS*Policy provides an estimate of the 
additional effect of an increase in the relevant policy index relative to the United States. 71. 
Overall, while causality is difficult to establish, the results are consistent with the idea that well 
designed framework policies can raise the expected returns to innovative activity, by making it easier for 
patenting firms to attract the tangible resources required to implement and commercialise new ideas. 
Focusing first on statistical significance, a number of results emerge: @BULLET Less efficient judicial systems – as measured by a higher cost of enforcing contracts – are 
associated with a lower responsiveness of firm employment and capital to patenting. This is 
consistent with research showing that difficulties in enforcing contracts lower the returns to 
innovation (Nunn, 2007) and make it more costly to hire the skilled workers necessary to 
underpin firm growth (Bloom et. al., 2012). @BULLET Bankruptcy regimes that more severely penalise failure – as measured by a higher cost to close a 
business – are associated with a lower responsiveness of firm employment and capital to 
patenting. This finding provides a dynamic perspective to existing research, which shows that 
stringent bankruptcy regimes disproportionately lower static allocative efficiency in sectors with 
naturally higher firm turnover rates where regulations affecting exit costs are most likely to bind 
(Andrews and Cingano, 2014). More broadly, by lowering the returns to innovation, the adverse 
effects of poorly designed bankruptcy regimes on the allocative efficiency could explain why less 
debtor-friendly bankruptcy codes have been associated with lower intensity of patent creation, 
patent citations and slower growth in countries relatively more specialised in innovative 
industries (Acharya and Subramanian, 2009). ECO/WKP(2014)23 32 Table 9.

The patent stock is calculated as the log(X+1) where

significant at 10%. The sample is limited to 21 OECD countries for which policy variables are available: Austria, Belgium, Czech 
Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Japan, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Slovak 
Republic, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom and the United States. @BULLET More cumbersome product market regulation (PMR) is associated with a lower responsiveness of 
firm employment to patenting. This may reflect the tendency for such regulations to raise the cost 
structure of inputs that are required by innovative firms to underpin their expansion (Bourlès et 
al., 2013). Similarly, in less competitive environments, valuable resources (e.g. skilled labour) 
may be more likely to be trapped in inefficient firms, making it more difficult for high potential 
firms to expand. @BULLET More stringent barriers to trade and investment are associated with a lower sensitivity of firm 
capital to changes in the patent stock. This is in line with existing research that shows that across 
OECD services sectors, higher restrictions on FDI are associated with lower static allocative 
efficiency (Andrews and Cingano, 2014). @BULLET More stringent employment protection legislation (EPL) is associated with a lower 
responsiveness of firm employment and capital to patenting. This is consistent with existing 
research which highlights the adverse effects of stringent EPL on reallocation mechanisms 
(Andrews and Cingano, 2014; Bravo-Biosca et al., 2013). ECO/WKP(2014)23 33 @BULLET The importance of finance to promoting the growth of patenting firms is affirmed by a number of 
results, which is in line with a host of studies that highlight the importance of financial 
development for firm growth (Aghion et al., 2007; Bravo-Biosca et al., 2013). For example: − More developed markets for seed and early stage venture capital (VC) are positively 
associated with resource flows (as measured by employment and capital) to patenting firms. − The same is true for deeper stock markets with respect to firm employment and VC markets 
at the expansion stage with respect to firm capital. 22 72. 
Table B6 explores the robustness of the baseline policy estimates in Table 9 to the inclusion of 
selected multiple policy interaction terms. Given the computational burdens involved, we implement a 
baseline specification that includes EPL and one product market regulation term (overall PMR for 
employment and barriers to trade and investment for capital) and then an additional policy interaction at 
time (these policies correspond to finance, bankruptcy and judicial inefficiency). While the baseline policy 
results are qualitatively robust to the inclusion of multiple policy interaction terms, in a few instances some 
coefficients become insignificant. This presumably reflects a multicollinearity issue, given the relatively 
high correlation between some of the policy variables in our analysis. This is particularly the case for the 
early stage finance term – strongly correlated with the two product market regulation variables (the 
correlation coefficient between this variable and PMR and BTI is around 0.6) – which becomes 
insignificant in the employment equation (Panel A, column 3) and in the capital equation (Panel B, 
column 2). The same is true for the overall PMR interaction (Panel A, column 2), which loses statistical 
significance when the stock market capitalisation interaction is included (the correlation between these two 
variables is around 0.7). 73. 
To provide a sense of the economic significance of these results, the policy experiments in 
Figure 4 illustrates how the estimated flow of resources to patenting firms varies with different public 
policy settings. Using the coefficients from Table 9, the figure shows the per cent change in employment 
and capital associated with a 10% increase in the patent stock when the policy variable of interest is set 
equal to the sample minimum, mean and maximum values respectively. For example, Panel A shows that 
the sensitivity of firm employment to changes in the patent stock is more than three times larger when 
PMR is relatively low (e.g. the United Kingdom), compared to when PMR is very stringent (e.g. in 
Poland). To the extent that these relationships can be interpreted as causal, these examples of comparative 
statics suggest that framework policies could significantly affect the extent to which patenting firms can 
attract the tangible resources required to implement and commercialise new ideas. 22 
However, the impact of banking regulation on resource flows to patenting firms is unclear. ECO/WKP(2014)23 34 Figure 4. Framework policies and resource flows to patenting firms, 2003-2010 A: Change in firm employment associated with a 10% change in the patent stock B: Change in firm capital associated with a 10% change in the patent stock Note: The chart shows that the sensitivity of firm employment and capital to changes in the patent stock varies according to the policy 
and institutional environment. To calculate the policy effects, coefficient estimates from Table 8 are combined with the average values 
of the policy indicators for each country over the sample period. The labels  " Minimum "  ( " Maximum) denotes the country with the 
lowest (highest) average value for the given policy indicator over the sample period. 5.3.2 
Heterogeneous effects: policies and firm age 74. 
Thus far, the estimated impact of framework policies on resource flows to patenting firms 
pertains to the average firm in the sample. However, to the extent that the characteristics of firms vary 
significantly, even within narrowly defined industries (Syverson 2011), policies that appear neutral in 
design may have non-neutral impacts on firms because of the diversity of firms characteristics. For 
example, firm age might be a particularly relevant characteristic to the extent that regulations that impose a 
fixed cost on firms may disproportionately affect young firms that typically have fewer resources to absorb 
such a cost. At the same time, emerging research highlights the importance of young firms for employment 
creation (see Haltiwanger et al., 2013; Criscuolo et al., 2014) and facilitating the expansion of successful 
innovative start-ups is particularly important for long-run growth. This is because firms that drive one 
technological wave often fail to continue to do so in the subsequent one, as they tend to concentrate on ECO/WKP(2014)23 35 incremental improvements (Benner and Tushman, 2002), and young firms possess a comparative 
advantage in commercialising radical innovations (Henderson, 1993; Tushman and Anderson, 1986). 23 
Indeed, these ideas are borne out in Table B7, which documents a robust negative relationship between 
firm age and the two indicators of the patent radicalness introduced in Table 7. The estimates in column 2 
imply that the number of citations to the non-patent literature (which proxies the closeness of patents to 
science) could be expected to be about 16% higher for a relatively young firm aged 5 years compared to a 
firm aged 30 years. Table 10. The heterogeneous impact of framework policies on resource flows to patenting firms: young 
versus old firms One policy interaction included in each regression; using yearly variation Notes: Robust standard errors clustered at country-industry level in parenthesis. The patent stock is calculated as the log(X+1) where 
X is the cumulated number of granted patents since the 1980 depreciated at the rate 15% per year. Young firms are defined as firms 
that are 5 years of age or less in 2006 – the midpoint of the sample. Firm and country-sector-year fixed effects are included in all 
regressions. *** significant at 1%, ** significant at 5%, * significant at 10%. 75. 
Accordingly, Table 10 explores the extent to which the estimated effects vary with the age of the 
firm (e.g. equation 4). The top left panel shows how the relationship between patenting and firm size varies 
with the age of the firm. The estimates suggest that the sensitivity of firm size with respect to changes in 
the patent stock is around twice as large for young firms than for older firms, and this difference is 
statistically significant at the 5% level (as illustrated by the F-test). The remaining panels of Table 10 
explore whether the impact of selected policies on the sensitivity of firm size to patenting varies according 
to the age of the firm. In most cases, the impact of policies does not vary with the age of the firm (and thus 
not all policy variables are reported in the Table). However, young firms appear to be particularly sensitive 
to EPL, with the positive effect of a one unit reduction in the OECD EPL Index (on the impact of patenting 
on capital) being about three times larger for young firms than older firms (the F-test suggests that this 23 
The same is true for implementing innovations that appear relatively incremental from a technological 
point of view but require fundamental organisational restructuring (Henderson and Clark, 1990). ECO/WKP(2014)23 36 difference is statistically significant for capital but not employment). 24 This may reflect the idea that young 
firms are more sensitive to rigidities in the reallocation process, given that they are more likely to 
experiment with uncertain technologies (see Andrews and Criscuolo, 2013). The same is true with respect 
to higher stock market capitalisation and, unsurprisingly, young firms are much more sensitive to the 
availability of seed and early stage financing than older firms. 5.3.3 
Heterogeneous effects: differences-in-differences estimation 76. 
If framework policies influence the ease with which innovative firms can attract tangible 
resources, it is reasonable to expect that the impact of policies should be more evident in sectors that, a 
priori, are likely to be more exposed to a given policy, owing to their technological characteristics for 
example. Accordingly, Tables 11 and B8 present the differences-in-differences coefficient estimates for the

in equation [5] for the firm employment 
and capital stock regressions respectively. To the extent that this specification is particularly demanding 
from a computational perspective, we limit the differences-in-differences estimation to focus on the subset 
of policy interaction terms that are statistically significant in Table 9. Since we are interested in testing the 
robustness of our baseline policy estimates, we focus on the sign and statistical significance of the 
differences-in-differences coefficient estimates, as opposed to their economic magnitude (which are more 
difficult to infer given that they measure indirect effects). 77. 
This exercise confirms many of the baseline findings from Table 9, and provides some useful 
insights into the channels through which our baseline policy effects may operate. For example: @BULLET In sectors that are particularly dynamic and have more intense reallocation needs (i.e. those with 
more firm entry, job layoffs and firm turnover rates), patenting firms can more easily attract 
resources in environments where: i) EPL is less stringent (see Columns 1-2 of Tables 11 and B8); 
ii) markets for seed and early stage venture capital are more developed (see Column 3 of Tables 
11 and B8); iii) bankruptcy legislation is less punishing of business failure (see Columns 4-5 of 
Tables 11 and B8); iv) judicial systems are more efficient (Column 6 of Table 11); and v) product 
market regulations are less cumbersome (Column 7 of Table 11). @BULLET In sectors more dependent on external financing, resource more readily flow to patenting firms in 
environments where stock market capitalisation to GDP is higher (Column 8 of Table 11) and 
bankruptcy legislation is less punishing of business failure (Columns 5 of Tables 11 and B8). @BULLET Finally, in sectors with higher trade intensity, more stringent barriers to international trade and 
investment are associated with a lower sensitivity of firm capital to patenting relative to other 
sectors (Column 7 of Table B8). 24 
A one unit reduction in the EPL index (on regular contracts) roughly corresponds to the difference between 
Switzerland and the United States in 2008. ECO/WKP(2014)23 37 Table 11. The impact of framework policies on employment flows to patenting firms: differences-in-

Extensions and robustness tests 78. 
The baseline results are robust to a number of sensitivity tests, including: 25 @BULLET Addressing the potential bias originating from the log(X+1) transformation. This is done in two 
different ways: − Estimating separately the coefficient on patent stock in two subsamples: only firms with a 
positive patent stock (Table B2, Panel A), and firms patenting for the first time (Table B2, 
Panel B). In the first case, the (always positive) patent stock can be expressed in simple 
logarithmic form (without adding one) and the coefficients are estimates of the intensive 
margin effect only. In the second case, the main dependent variable is a  " patentee "  dummy 
equal to one if the patent stock is positive, and zero otherwise. The sample is limited to zero-
patent firms and to  " switchers " , i.e., firms that change their status from non-patentee to 
patentee over the sample period, while always-patentees are dropped. Results are broadly 
consistent across the two samples, suggesting that the effect at the intensive and extensive 
margin is comparable. − Including a zero patent dummy to the baseline regressions. This method – already used in the 
patent literature (Klette, 1996) – tests whether the estimates are robust to accounting for a 25 
Some of these results are not reported for sake of brevity, but are available from the authors upon request. ECO/WKP(2014)23 38 potential heterogeneous effect at the intensive and extensive margin, respectively. The 
estimates coefficients are very similar to those obtained from the baseline regressions. @BULLET Controlling for some potentially confounding country factors that might be correlated with 
policies. These include: (a) interactions between the Patent Stock and real GDP (in level and per 
capita terms) to control for the possibility that small countries may be more likely to choose a 
certain set of policies; and (b) interactions between the patent stock and outward FDI flows to 
control for the possibility that in more globally oriented economies, firms might be more likely to 
expand their operations offshore following a change in the patent stock. These results are 
reported in Table B9, and most policy interactions retain their statistical significance. @BULLET Using a measure of the patent stock that is not depreciated and restricting the sample to the set of 
firms for which employment, capital, turnover, and valued added are all available. @BULLET Controlling for firm-level R&D expenditures: if the within-firm variation in R&D expenditures is 
positively correlated with changes in other inputs (namely employment and capital), then the 
estimated (positive) relationship between these variables and patenting activity could be partly 
spurious given the well-documented positive correlation between R&D and patenting. 
Unfortunately, R&D data in ORBIS are very incomplete (data are only available for about 35 000 
firm*year observations) so is not possible to control for R&D in the baseline specification. 
Nevertheless, estimation performed on this limited sub-sample of firms indicates that while the 
impact of R&D expenditures is positive and statistically significant, the coefficient on the patent 
variable is unaffected by either the sample reduction or the inclusion of the additional control. 7. 
Conclusions 79. 
This paper exploits a novel cross-country OECD database on firm performance and patenting 
activity to explore what happens when firms patent. The results suggest that changes in patenting are 
associated with real changes in economic activity at the firm level and new evidence is presented to 
suggest that the link between patenting and firm size is causal. 80. 
In turn, the paper highlights some interesting cross-country differences in patterns of reallocation 
toward patenting firms. Important differences emerge in the ease with which patenting firms can attract the 
tangible resources required to underpin the implementation and commercialisation of new ideas. Although 
patenting is an imperfect measure of innovation, these results points to a more general assessment of the 
role of national policies and framework condition in shaping the flow of resources to the most innovative 
firms. For instance, one interpretation is that the returns to innovation vary across OECD countries and the 
econometric analysis indicates that cross-country differences in the functioning of product, labour and 
capital markets, in the efficiency of judicial systems and in the design of bankruptcy laws can provide 
some explanation of why the expected returns from patenting activities may vary. The benefits of well-
designed policies in these areas are partly realised through stronger competitive pressures and more 
efficient reallocation, which make it easier for successful firms to implement and commercialise new ideas 
and, by lowering the costs of failure, encourage firms to experiment with uncertain growth opportunities. 81. 
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper to explore cross-country differences in 
resource flows to patenting firms and further research on this issue is required. Indeed, a number of 
avenues for future research emerge. First, the data underlying the current paper is based on matching 
administrative data on patents and the commercial database ORBIS. As discussed this raises issues related 
to sample representativeness and coverage, and it warrants some caution when interpreting some of the 
results presented, e.g. on young firms. Therefore, one avenue for further research is to use information ECO/WKP(2014)23 39 from matching patent data with business register data, which cover the whole population of businesses and 
survey data based on stratified random samples from National Statistical Offices. 82. 
Second, the paper currently considers only two specific characteristics of firms' patent portfolio: 
radicalness, defined as the number of different IPC classes cited, and closeness to science. Current OECD 
research (Squicciarini et al., 2013) is developing additional indicators of novelty and radicalness as well as 
other features of patents, such as scope and originality. 83. 
Third, the data used in this analysis only allow an investigation of the growth of firms within 
national boundaries. However, firms might grow and expand abroad, especially if they operate in small 
open economies and if they can replicate their ideas at a low cost. As discussed in the previous section, the 
relationship between patenting and firm size does not vary consistently with the extent of outward Foreign 
Direct Investment (FDI) at the aggregate level, but clearly firm-level data on FDI is required to test this 
hypothesis properly. ECO/WKP(2014)23 40 REFERENCES Acemoglu, D. and J. Linn (2004),  " Market Size in Innovation: Theory and evidence from the

This note describes the procedure implemented to refine the information available in the OECD-
ORBIS (June 2011) dataset on firms' ownership structure with the aim to create a group identifier. The 
identifier allows to significantly refining the information of firms' patenting, for several reasons. First, it is 
plausible to assume that firms belonging to a group can also access the patent stock – and the relative 
knowledge base – of other affiliated firms. Second, firms belonging to a group may be different from 
singleton firms in their ability to attract resources; this may be particularly relevant in the case of 
multinational groups. Third, identifying group patents may also limit the bias originating from the firm-
patent matching procedure. Such a matching is based on a probabilistic similarity score and whenever a 
patent is matched with similar probability to two firms some disambiguation rules need to be applied. One 
of these rules says that, in the case in which the disambiguation involves a headquarters and its affiliate, 
the former becomes the owner of the patent. This may introduce a relevant bias if the analysis is based on 
unconsolidated accounts (as it is the case in this paper). 2. 
The ORBIS June 2011 dataset contains information on ownership; however, further elaboration 
on this data is needed in order to obtain a meaningful, although approximate, group identifier for most 
companies. This appendix describes the procedure which was developed for this purpose. 3. 
ORBIS ownership information is organised in year-specific tables containing the following 
columns: the identifier of the owned firm (BVD_ID), the identifier of the shareowner firm (SH_BVD_ID), 
the kind of linkage (LINK_TYPE), the share of direct ownership (DIRECT), and the share of total 
ownership (TOTAL). Individual owned companies can have more than a shareholder, and owned-
shareholder pairs can appear with different linkages and ownership shares. LINK_TYPE can take the 
following values: GUO (global ultimate owner), DUO (domestic ultimate owner), ISH (intermediate 
shareholder), and ACT (active). 4. 
A first issue to address is that not all the owned companies are matched to a GUO; around 40% 
are matched to an ISH. However, some of those ISHs are listed themselves as owned companies; this 
implies that their ultimate owner is also the ultimate owner of the company they own. An example may 
clarify the problem: A is owned by B, and B is an ISH, not a GUO. In the ownership table there are no 
other owners of A listed companies. However, a few lines below, a record shows that B is owned by C, and 
C is defined as a GUO (see table A1). It logically follows that C is also the GUO of A, and that A, B, C all 
belong to the same group. It would therefore be useful to create a table like Table 2. Table A1 – Original table example BVD_ID SH_BVD_ID LINK_TYPE

In this simple case, only one step is needed to find the ultimate owner for company A. However, 
it could also be possible that the steps are more than one, because the owner of the first company is itself 
owned by an intermediate shareholder, and so on. Furthermore, each company can have more than one 
intermediate shareholder, thus different alternative paths may lead to different ultimate GUOs. As a 
consequence, if the ownership structure is not simplified at every step, the web of links may growth 
exponentially and the process may become unmanageable, also considering the sheer dimension of the 
dataset, which makes the whole procedure very computing intensive. 6. 
Therefore, the algorithm is based on three main assumptions aimed at simplifying the ownership 
structure. These assumptions are necessary to keep the process manageable but they are not neutral, and 
they should be customised according to the different scopes the grouping process. They could also be 
related to the size of the dataset: smaller datasets allow weaker assumptions, are the need to reduce the 
number of links by simplifying the ownership structure is less stringent. 7. 
In the specific case of the group identifier developed for this paper, the assumptions are the 
following: direct and total ownership conveys the same message; all the ownership links below a set 
threshold (25%) of ownership rate, or with missing information, are considered to be irrelevant and are 
therefore dropped; in the case of multiple ownership links defined as  " ultimate "  (i.e., where the owner is 
either a DUO or a GUO), only the one with the highest share (direct or total) is kept. 8. 
The algorithm is composed by three steps which are sequentially performed and are iteratively 
repeated until all companies have a final GUO, i.e., a non-owned owner, listed. – 
The first step simplifies the ownership links, by performing the following operations: a. All links where direct and total ownership shares are both below 25% are dropped. 
b. If there are multiple BVD_ID – SH_BVD_ID combinations and one of these is a GUO link, 
only the latter is kept. 
c. If there are multiple BVD_ID – SH_BVD_ID combinations and none of these is a GUO link, 
the one(s) with the highest total ownership share are kept. 
d. If there are multiple owners for the same BVD_ID and one of these is a GUO link, only the 
latter is kept. – 
The second step stores the BVD_ID which have a listed GUO already. – 
The third step joins the list of all companies which do not have a GUO yet with itself and with 
the list of all companies with a GUO which have been previously stored. The number of times 
each company is listed in the new joined table is equal to the number of owners of their owners: 
i.e., if company A has N owners which in turn have K owners each, it appears in N*K rows in the 
dataset. This step also updates the ownership shares (direct and total) with the product of the 
share of the first linkage with the share of the second linkage. – 
The procedure then restarts from step one. ECO/WKP(2014)23 46 APPENDIX B: ADDITIONAL EMPIRICAL TABLES AND CHARTS Figure B1. Litigation propensity varies significantly across time and IPC Human Necessities

One potential challenge to the validity of the IV strategy is the presence of a possible long-run, 
firm-specific trend that is correlated with both the technological specialisation of the firm in the pre-sample 
period (before 2003) and with its economic activity during the period of analysis (post 2003). This in turn 
would imply that the technology share weights used to build the instrumental variable and the output 
variable in the second-stage regression are correlated, violating the exclusion restriction. We therefore 
design a falsification test which, although not conclusive, may give an indication whether this could 
actually be an issue in our data. The test involves regressing the endogenous variable on a placebo 
instrumental variable. The latter is calculated as the interaction of the vector of a firm's technological 
shares with a randomly sorted vector of litigation propensity by technological class; i.e., while in the real 
IV each share is multiplied by the litigation propensity in the same technology, in the placebo IV the 
technological classes do not (necessarily) match: _ 񮽙񮽙 = ∑ ℎ  *  _____ 񮽙񮽙 񮽙 [4] 2. 
If the unobserved firm-specific trend is driving some of the correlation between the patent stock 
and the IV, then the placebo IV should turn out to be significant in the first-stage regressions. However, as 
reported in Panel D of Table 8, this is never the case. ECO/WKP(2014)23 57 WORKING PAPERS The full series of Economics Department Working Papers can be consulted at www.oecd.org/eco/workingpapers 1126.
