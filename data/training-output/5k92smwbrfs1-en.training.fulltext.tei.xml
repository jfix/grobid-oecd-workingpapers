			<head>ABSTRACT/RESUMÉ<lb/> Portugal: Solid foundations for a sustainable fiscal consolidation<lb/></head>

			<p>Owing to slow growth and a relatively weak fiscal position, Portugal&apos;s public debt had been rising for almost a<lb/> decade when the global crisis struck, sharply increasing the deficit. The loss of confidence in Portuguese and other<lb/> euro area sovereign bonds required international financial support. Weak fiscal performance reflects a wide range of<lb/> fiscal structural problems resulting in poor control of expenditure. At both the central and local levels, this was<lb/> compounded by the non-transparent accumulation of payment arrears, future spending obligations via Public-Private<lb/> Partnerships (PPPs) and off-balance sheet debt in state-owned enterprises (SOEs). In line with the EU-IMF<lb/> programme, the government is steadfastly implementing an ambitious front-loaded consolidation plan underpinned by<lb/> a wide range of structural reforms. In a context of weak private sector demand, the government&apos;s ability to regain<lb/> control over public debt dynamics depends crucially on avoiding spending overruns. This will require reinforcing the<lb/> fiscal framework to improve expenditure control, tackling payment arrears and avoiding further negative surprises<lb/> from loss-making SOEs, PPPs and local governments. The success of the programme will also require maintaining<lb/> social consensus around it, notably through continuous attention to its implications for the poorest. If growth is far<lb/> lower than projected in the programme, the automatic stabilisers could be allowed to operate at least partially to<lb/> reduce the risks of a deeper recession and higher unemployment. This Working Paper relates to the 2012 OECD<lb/> Economic Survey of Portugal (www.oecd.org/eco/surveys/portugal).<lb/> JEL classification: E62, H54, H61, H63, H70<lb/> Keywords: Portugal; public debt sustainability; automatic stabilisers; fiscal framework; fiscal rules; budgeting; fiscal<lb/> council; state-owned enterprises; public-private partnerships; local government; EU funds; Madeira<lb/> ************<lb/></p>

			<head>Portugal: Mettre en place des bases solides pour un assainissement budgétaire durable<lb/></head>

			<p>En raison de la lenteur de la croissance et d&apos;une situation budgétaire relativement médiocre, la dette publique du<lb/> Portugal était en augmentation depuis près d&apos;une décennie lorsque la crise mondiale a frappé,</p>

			<table>creusant sensiblement<lb/> le déficit. La perte de confiance dans les obligations souveraines du Portugal et des autres pays de la zone euro a<lb/> exigé un soutien financier international. Les mauvais résultats budgétaires reflètent un large éventail de problèmes<lb/> structurels se traduisant par un contrôle déficient des dépenses. Au niveau central comme au niveau local, ce dérapage<lb/> des dépenses a été aggravé par l&apos;accumulation non transparente d&apos;arriérés de paiement, d&apos;obligations de dépenses<lb/> futures au titre des partenariats public-privé (PPP) et de dettes extrabudgétaires contractées par les entreprises<lb/> publiques. En application du programme UE-FMI, les pouvoirs publics s&apos;emploient à mettre en oeuvre un plan<lb/> d&apos;assainissement ambitieux, intensif dans sa phase initiale et étayé par un large éventail de réformes structurelles.<lb/> Face à la faiblesse de la demande du secteur privé, la capacité des pouvoirs publics de regagner la maîtrise de<lb/> l&apos;évolution de la dette publique dépend de façon cruciale de la possibilité d&apos;éviter des dépassements de dépenses. Il<lb/> faudra pour cela renforcer le cadre budgétaire afin d&apos;améliorer le contrôle des dépenses, de limiter les arriérés de<lb/> paiement et d&apos;éviter d&apos;autres mauvaises surprises du côté des entreprises publiques déficitaires, des PPP et des<lb/> collectivités locales. Pour aboutir, le programme devra aussi préserver le consensus social dont il fait l&apos;objet,<lb/> notamment en tenant compte continument de ses incidences pour les pauvres. Si la croissance est bien inférieure aux<lb/> prévisions du programme, on pourrait laisser jouer les stabilisateurs automatiques au moins en partie pour réduire les<lb/> risques d&apos;un approfondissement de la récession et d&apos;une aggravation du chômage.

			<table>ECO/WKP(2012)62<lb/> Portugal: Solid foundations for a sustainable fiscal consolidation<lb/> by David Haugh and Stéphane Sorbe 1<lb/></table>

			<p>Portugal has a long record of fiscal deficits. In the past two decades, the fiscal deficit never fell<lb/> significantly below 3% of gross domestic product (GDP), despite resort to one-offs to improve headline<lb/> figures. This situation, combined with weak growth, resulted in a gradual but sustained rise in public debt<lb/> since 2000. In 2009, debt increase shifted to a much steeper path as the deficit deteriorated dramatically to<lb/> 10.2% of GDP (<ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>). Rising debt, weakening growth prospects and turmoil in the euro area led to a<lb/> loss of investor confidence and access to long-term market finance at sustainable interest rates. Portugal<lb/> entered a European Union-International Monetary Fund (EU-IMF) financial assistance programme<lb/> (hereafter referred as the programme) in <ref type="biblio">May 2011.<lb/></ref> This paper discusses Portugal&apos;s fiscal situation and progress in dealing with the underlying drivers of<lb/> the weak fiscal position. The first section analyses the risks around debt sustainability, and how<lb/> consolidation should be designed to minimise harm to medium-term growth and maintain public support<lb/> for the programme. This is followed by a discussion of the fiscal framework including measures to<lb/> improve expenditure control. A final section covers efforts to deal with the large off-balance sheet<lb/> liabilities and inefficiencies built up in state-owned enterprises (SOEs), public-private partnerships (PPPs)<lb/> and local government and with the use of EU structural funds.<lb/></p>

			<head>The speed of consolidation and risks around achieving debt sustainability<lb/></head>

			<p>The government aims to reduce the public deficit to 4½ per cent of GDP in 2012 and 3% in 2013 as<lb/> part of the EU-IMF programme, and projects the public debt ratio to peak at 116% of GDP in 2013 and<lb/> then start declining (<ref type="table">Table 1</ref>). Due to the need to make up for the large one-offs in 2011, such targets will<lb/> require a large underlying fiscal consolidation of about 3½ per cent of GDP in 2012 – almost twice as<lb/> much as in 2011 – and about 1½ per cent of GDP in 2013.. Under the OECD&apos;s central scenario of a<lb/> gradual economic recovery beginning in 2013, the ambitious fiscal stance envisaged by the authorities<lb/> would allow to rapidly regain control over public debt dynamics. However, there are risks of a deeper than<lb/> projected recession and lower government revenue, notably because of ongoing economic and financial<lb/> turbulence in the Euro Area, as well as the ongoing credit contraction in Portugal (<ref type="biblio">Pina and Abreu, 2012</ref>).<lb/> Indeed, first data for 2012 showed a budget deficit of 7.9% for the first quarter on a seasonally unadjusted<lb/> basis because of lower indirect tax revenues and higher social transfers. In the case of lower than projected<lb/> growth, the question is whether the government should stick to nominal deficit targets, which risks further<lb/> amplifying the recession and being potentially self-defeating, or let automatic stabilisers play, which would<lb/> delay public debt stabilisation, with a risk to investor confidence.<lb/></p>

			<p>Stochastic simulations carried out by the Secretariat illustrate the trade-off between sticking to<lb/> nominal deficit targets and letting automatic stabilisers play in an uncertain macroeconomic environment<lb/> (Sorbe, 2012), (<ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>). These simulations rely on a small-sized stylised macroeconomic model inspired<lb/> by <ref type="biblio">Lenain et al. (2010)</ref>, in which random shocks affect macroeconomic variables following the approach<lb/> developed by <ref type="biblio">Celasun et al. (2006)</ref>. The model captures the mutual interdependences between the fiscal<lb/> position, financial conditions and activity and notably the impact of public debt developments on investors&apos;<lb/> confidence and interest rates. The fiscal multiplier, which has a large influence on the results, is assumed to<lb/> be one – a level that would be considered rather high in normal times, reflecting that depressed private<lb/> demand and tight credit may amplify the impact of fiscal consolidation (<ref type="biblio">Corsetti et al., 2012; Boussard<lb/> et al., 2012</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<p>The simulation results suggest that sticking to nominal deficit targets would put debt on a declining<lb/> path, but with a significant risk of a deep recession and an associated sharp rise in unemployment. In this<lb/> case, meeting nominal deficit targets would require large additional consolidation measures, which would<lb/> risk undermining social support for the programme in a context of high and rising unemployment. In<lb/> contrast, letting automatic stabilisers play would limit the risk of an extreme recession, but at the cost of<lb/> abandoning certainty over debt control. On balance, this suggests that the government should aim at<lb/> meeting its nominal fiscal targets (without resorting to one-offs) as long as growth does not deviate<lb/> substantially from the programme to reap the associated credibility gains. Nevertheless, should output fall<lb/></p>

			<p>substantially more than projected, the automatic stabilisers should be allowed to play, at least partially.<lb/> Debt simulations also show that risks around the fiscal consolidation programme would be minimised by<lb/> stimulating potential growth through structural reforms (<ref type="biblio">Pina and Abreu, 2012</ref>) and by choosing &quot; growth<lb/> friendly &quot; fiscal consolidation instruments that would lower the fiscal multiplier (Annex A1).<lb/></p>

			<head>Consolidation instruments, growth, equity and the environment<lb/></head>

			<p>After a fiscal stimulus of around 1% of GDP in late 2008 and 2009, as part of the European economic<lb/> recovery plan, Portugal resumed fiscal consolidation in 2010 that gathered pace in 2011 and 2012. Two-<lb/>thirds of measures in 2011 and 2012 are on the expenditure side, largely through reductions in the public<lb/> sector wage bill via staff reductions as well as cuts in public sector wages. In addition the indexing of<lb/> pensions to inflation was suspended except for the lowest pensions. In early July 2012 the Portuguese<lb/> Constitutional Court ruled that the suspension of the 13th and 14th months paid to civil servants and<lb/> pensioners through to 2014 (accounting for approximately 1.1% of GDP of the consolidation package for<lb/> 2012) violated the constitution because it does not apply to all citizens. Given the country&apos;s deficit target<lb/> commitments, the Court has nonetheless accepted that the suspension, as currently defined, can be applied<lb/> in 2012. The government is currently analysing the possible alternatives scenarios to incorporate the Court<lb/> decision into the budgetary plans beyond 2012. On the revenue side, amongst other measures, a personal<lb/> income tax surcharge was imposed on higher incomes (those in the highest tax bracket), the state surcharge<lb/> on corporate profits was increased, social security contributions were raised and value-added tax (VAT)<lb/> increased both by lifting the main rate and abolishing a concessionary rate on electricity and many other<lb/> items in 2012 (e.g. restaurants). Tax expenditures have been further reduced by cutting and capping tax<lb/> allowances for health, mortgage and rent expenditure and abolishing all concessionary corporate tax rates.<lb/> User charges including road tolls and public transport fares have been increased.<lb/> Consolidation instruments should be chosen so as to ensure a lasting improvement in the fiscal<lb/> balance, minimise negative effects on activity, spread fairly the burden of adjustment across the population<lb/> and, when relevant, help preserve the environment. In this respect, on the one hand, concentrating<lb/> consolidation measures on the expenditure side would have a stronger negative effect on short-run activity<lb/> as the impact of expenditure cuts is generally considered higher than tax increases (OECD, 2009a). On the<lb/> other hand, international experience shows that expenditure based consolidations tend to be more<lb/> successful, notably in terms of sustainability (<ref type="biblio">Guichard et al., 2007</ref>).<lb/> On balance, the government will need to rely on both tax increases and expenditure restraints. Relying<lb/> on the least-distortive taxes will minimize the short-term cost of the adjustment. From that perspective, the<lb/> current consolidation package has a number of attractive features including raising revenue through<lb/> indirect tax increases (<ref type="biblio">Arnold, 2008</ref>), broadening the tax base through reducing tax expenditures rather<lb/> than raising tax rates, and harmonising tax rates by suppressing certain concessionary rates. However,<lb/> consolidation should put greater weight on expenditure measures since excessive growth in expenditure<lb/> has been the main source of poor fiscal performance. In times of fiscal restraint, the emphasis should be on<lb/> improving spending efficiency, notably concerning SOEs and local governments, and, as has been the case,<lb/> on cutting current rather than capital expenditures as short and medium-term negative growth effects are<lb/> lower.<lb/></p>

			<p>The burden of adjustment needs to be spread fairly to maintain social consensus around the<lb/> programme. In particular, continuing attention should be paid to its implications for the poorest. By design,<lb/> the reduction of certain tax credits, public sector pay cuts and income tax changes have affected high<lb/> income earners more, having clauses to protect the lowest income brackets. However, consolidations tend<lb/> to have adverse impacts on income distribution (<ref type="biblio">Ahrend et al., 2011</ref>). Recent research suggests that<lb/> (excluding increases in indirect tax other than VAT and cuts in public services), between 2009 and<lb/> mid-2011, Portugal&apos;s package may have been more regressive than in five other EU countries examined<lb/> (<ref type="biblio">Callan et al., 2011</ref>). Indeed, the combined effect of the measures considered in this study reduced<lb/> disposable incomes of the two lowest income deciles in Portugal proportionally more than those of higher<lb/> income deciles, mainly as a result of pension and benefit cuts which hit the poorest harder.<lb/></p>

			<p>The decision to impose tolls on formerly free highways is welcome as it raises revenue while also<lb/> benefiting the environment. The government is also planning, in tandem with municipalities, to develop a<lb/> package of measures to promote the use of public transport. Measures include extending bus lanes as well<lb/> as increasing parking restrictions and the cost of individual transport. The last is particularly welcome as<lb/> planned metro price increases would otherwise lead to passengers moving to other, more polluting,<lb/> transport forms. The authorities should be ambitious in this area, by for example widening the coverage of<lb/> and increasing parking fees, introducing congestion charges in Lisbon and making greater use of road tolls.<lb/> This would even up the competitive playing field between metro, rail and individual road transport, help to<lb/> reduce pollution and congestion, provide a source of funding for public transport and increase market<lb/> efficiency by bringing user costs closer to the social costs of individual road transport. Tolls should be set<lb/> as a part of a wider transport strategy that takes into account the environmental costs as well as the overall<lb/> costs and revenues arising from all transport state-owned enterprises including the rail companies.<lb/></p>

			<head>Improving the fiscal framework<lb/></head>

			<p>Portugal has a relatively poor record of achieving its budget targets, especially medium-term ones,<lb/> largely owing to a failure to adequately control expenditure. With the exception of the 2005-07<lb/> consolidation, public expenditure has been allowed to rise more rapidly than GDP since 1998, when<lb/> Portugal&apos;s entry to the euro was confirmed, undermining the fiscal position (<ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>). The failure to<lb/> control expenditure is partly a result of over-optimistic economic and revenue forecasts (Annex A2, which<lb/> is a widespread source of budgeting problems (OECD, 2011a), and assumptions on capital revenue<lb/> (<ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>). It also reflects spending overruns, compounded by a failure to minimise risks arising from local<lb/> and regional government, the state-owned enterprise sector and public-private partnerships, as discussed<lb/> below.<lb/> A stronger fiscal framework would help to solve these problems. By enhancing credibility, it can also<lb/> help to reduce the need for sharp fiscal corrections that increase volatility of GDP growth in the short-run,<lb/> which in turn undermines the economy&apos;s long-run growth rate (<ref type="biblio">Brzozowski and Siwinska-Gorzelak, 2010</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<figure>Portugal is overhauling its fiscal framework via the Budget Framework law of May 2011 and subsequent<lb/> legislation. The main elements include: a medium-term framework of budget planning that annually sets<lb/> expenditure ceilings for the central government for the next four years (November 2011); a general<lb/> government budget balance rule in line with European level requirements to have a structural deficit of no<lb/> more than 0.5% of GDP (after a transition period until 2014, during which the government will follow the<lb/> programme targets); establishing an independent fiscal council (October 2011); programme budgeting; and<lb/> expanding the State Budget to the whole of general government as defined in the national accounts.<lb/> Reforms of regional and local finances laws will also be presented before the end of 2012.<lb/> ECO/WKP(2012)62<lb/> Figure 3.

EMU: Economic and Monetary Union; SGP: Stability and Growth Pact.<lb/> 2.<lb/> Non-wage expenditure and other current payments.<lb/> Source: OECD (2012), OECD Economic Outlook: Statistics and Projections (database), May.<lb/></table>

			<p>While implementation challenges still lie ahead, the new framework is a major step forward and is<lb/> consistent with international best practice. Notably, the move towards a more medium-term focus is<lb/> welcome given that Portugal has hitherto been relatively weak in this area by international standards<lb/> (OECD, 2011a). However, ensuring that the framework really contributes to fiscal sustainability will<lb/> require meeting important implementation challenges. In addition, the framework would be more<lb/> transparent and easier to monitor if it were reinforced by a spending rule consistent with the structural<lb/> balance rule and the new European fiscal framework. An expenditure rule is easy to monitor, addresses<lb/> directly a major weakness of Portuguese fiscal policy, and would help to guide fiscal consolidation by<lb/> providing an overall expenditure envelope within which to plan programmes.<lb/></p>

			<head>Budget control and financial management<lb/></head>

			<p>The new framework will only be effective if the government is able to implement its budget plans and<lb/> prevent slippages (<ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref>). In the past, inadequate monitoring has undermined the government&apos;s ability<lb/> to achieve its targets, as evidenced by the generation of various contingent liabilities and payment arrears,<lb/> as well as the frequent need to pass supplementary budgets to cover expenditure overruns despite the<lb/> existence of a central budget contingency fund. Spending control efforts are hampered by the highly<lb/> fragmented nature of financial reporting even at the central government level. Over 500 individual central<lb/> government spending units report to the Ministry of Finance. The detailed monitoring and control of so<lb/> many spending units leaves very little resources for the Ministry of Finance to get an overall view of<lb/> individual ministries and major spending areas and therefore exercise effective budget control (OECD,<lb/> 2008a).<lb/></p>

			<p>Fragmentation of reporting has been amplified by an incomplete accounts reporting system. Reporting<lb/> has been long, confusing and often repetitive. In addition, the accounts are cash based and have not used<lb/> the same definition of the general government as that used in the national accounts produced by the<lb/> National Statistics Institute (Ministry of Finance, 2011a). The Ministry of Finance has also in the past not<lb/> had sufficient information about the sources of potential liabilities including SOEs and PPPs (particularly<lb/> at the local level) and local and regional government finances on a sufficiently frequent basis (OECD,<lb/> 2008a). Additionally, data on health spending and local and regional government accounts was previously<lb/> only available quarterly. This has prevented the government from being able to get a timely picture of the<lb/> overall general government position and risks to it.<lb/> Information flows are improving. The move to monthly reporting for all parts of general government<lb/> is welcome. The broadening of the reporting universe in the State Budget to all entities included in the<lb/> general government will also help the monitoring of the overall state of the government sector and improve<lb/> international comparability. The government also plans to overhaul the accounting system, moving to a set<lb/> of accrual based accounts containing results that can be compared across expenditure areas, which is<lb/> welcome. More recently the Ministry of Finance has produced annual and quarterly reports on SOEs and<lb/> PPPs at the central government level and some basic financial and operational information about individual<lb/> SOEs is also provided. In addition, in line with programme requirements, the government produced a range<lb/> of new reports including ones covering arrears, the 36 most important PPP contracts as well as<lb/> 24 concessions. This excluded the PPP programme in the autonomous region of Madeira, which ran into<lb/> serious difficulties in 2011 with one of the three PPPs in the region having been reclassified within general<lb/> government resulting in fiscal implications at the general government level.<lb/></p>

			<head>As recommended by the 2008 OECD Review of Budgeting in Portugal,</head>

			<p>the government is moving<lb/> towards a programme budgeting approach. The State Budget will be structured around 14 programmes,<lb/> each with a single implementing ministry. Also in line with OECD Budgeting Review recommendations,<lb/> each minister will be responsible for strict compliance with the budgetary limits set for their respective<lb/> ministry. Importantly, ministers will be liable for correcting any shortfall and failure to do so will result in<lb/> lower budget allowances in the following year. In addition, each minister has appointed a programme<lb/> financial controller to interact with the Ministry of Finance in monitoring and controlling budget<lb/> implementation (Ministry of <ref type="biblio">Finance, 2011a</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<figure>-3<lb/> -2<lb/> -1<lb/> 0<lb/> 1<lb/> 2<lb/> 3<lb/> 4<lb/> 5<lb/> 6<lb/> 7<lb/> -3<lb/> -2<lb/> -1<lb/> 0<lb/> 1<lb/> 2<lb/> 3<lb/> 4<lb/> 5<lb/> 6<lb/> 7<lb/> Jan.<lb/> 2001<lb/> Dec.<lb/> 2001<lb/> Jan.<lb/> 2003<lb/> Dec.<lb/> 2003<lb/> June<lb/> 2005<lb/> Dec.<lb/> 2005<lb/> Dec.<lb/> 2006<lb/> Dec.<lb/> 2007<lb/> Jan.<lb/> 2009<lb/> Mar.<lb/> 2010<lb/> Stability and Growth Programme<lb/> First year of forecast (t)¹<lb/> t + 1<lb/> t + 2<lb/> t + 3<lb/></figure>

			<p>The move to programme budgeting will help tackle the problem of fragmentation and assist the<lb/> Ministry of Finance to move away from detailed control of budget execution, which should reside with<lb/> individual ministries, towards more strategic global oversight and reviews of financial performance.<lb/> Programme budgeting will also complement the new medium-term expenditure framework discussed<lb/> below by providing a better system for ensuring spending remains within the framework limits.<lb/></p>

			<p>Once programme budgeting is fully embedded, the government should move towards improving<lb/> performance information. A new OECD index shows that Portugal has a relatively under-developed budget<lb/> performance information system by international standards (OECD, 2011a). Initial efforts should<lb/> concentrate on developing a small set of internationally comparable output and outcome indicators that can<lb/> be monitored over time against benchmarks in key expenditure areas such as health and education. This<lb/> information can be used to go beyond just controlling expenditure within set limits but assist in<lb/> reallocating expenditure to increase efficiency.<lb/> It is also important that the authorities fully implement the new system of intra-annual expenditure<lb/> commitment controls based around the 14 new budget programmes. In the past, spending slippage<lb/> occurred because spending units were allowed to spend excessively on the basis of over-optimistic<lb/> forecasts of their own revenues, while no corrective action was taken when these revenues failed to<lb/> materialise. The new system aims to remedy this. If spending exceeds the forecast revenue envelope in a<lb/> three month period, this will have to be offset by more ambitious spending targets to correct this over the<lb/> budget year. A potential issue is that the technical capability of programme financial controllers to carry<lb/> out these oversight functions and interact with the Ministry of Finance varies a lot across other ministries.<lb/> To instil a greater sense of responsibility, financial controllers should be appointments assigned to named<lb/> individuals rather than simply a function assigned to the head of the planning unit for example. In addition,<lb/> they should have sufficient time to properly carry out these functions and have access to analytical support<lb/> staff, which is not the case for all ministries.<lb/></p>

			<p>Further efforts are also needed to reduce payment arrears. Arrears of the general government sector,<lb/> as well as the SOEs outside the general government sector, are high by international standards. The 2011<lb/> European Payments Index showed that the average payment delay by the public sector was the fourth<lb/> highest out of 25 countries (<ref type="biblio">Intrum Justitia, 2011</ref>). In early 2012, total arrears including those of SOE<lb/> hospitals were around 3.2% of GDP. Controlling arrears is important as they are part of government debt in<lb/> the wider sense (although they are not directly accounted in Maastricht debt) and, are a burden on private<lb/> sector capital resources and thus on economic activity. The 2012 Supplementary Budget allocated<lb/> EUR 1.5 billion (0.9% of GDP) for the settlement of existing arrears for the hospital sector, which is<lb/> expected to be paid out by August. To prevent the build up of new arrears in 2012, the government has<lb/> concentrated on providing adequate allocations to the health sector, where around 40% of the arrears have<lb/> been concentrated. In addition, incentives are built into the newly introduced commitment control system<lb/> to pay back arrears, as entities with spending arrears are forced to adopt more ambitious spending targets.<lb/> The government has also committed to help local governments settle part of their existing arrears via a<lb/> EUR 1 billion (0.6% of GDP) credit line, as discussed below.<lb/></p>

			<head>Medium-term budgeting and anchoring the framework<lb/></head>

			<p>Medium term budgeting has been insufficient, as Portugal was ranked second lowest on this issue out<lb/> of 30 OECD countries in 2007 (OECD<ref type="biblio">, 2009b; OECD, 2011a</ref>). This ranking takes into account a set of<lb/> variables including the presence of multi-year expenditure estimates in the annual budget. The<lb/> government&apos;s move to a comprehensive medium-term expenditure framework is therefore welcome. The<lb/> medium-term expenditure framework can help to improve transparency in fiscal policy by showing how<lb/> targets will be achieved as well as the multi-year consequences of spending and revenue plans. The latter<lb/> restricts the scope to use expenditure shifting across years to hide unfavourable trends.<lb/> In the new framework, the government has committed to submit to parliament annually expenditure<lb/> ceilings for the following four years. In the first year (the budget year) these ceilings will be expressed by<lb/> the individual 14 programmes, for the second year they will be grouped by policy intervention areas, while<lb/> only an overall ceiling will apply for the third and fourth years. The government should extend the period<lb/> of individual programme ceilings beyond the first year. The extended ceilings could in addition be linked<lb/> to specific measures, thereby giving the framework more credibility. The medium-term expenditure<lb/> framework should be part of a broader medium-term economic and fiscal plan. Such a plan should include<lb/> estimates for expenditure and revenue year by year and the specific measures that will be used to achieve<lb/> targets. It is also important that the assumptions underpinning the plan are transparently laid out to give it<lb/> credibility and allow effective monitoring by the Fiscal Council, the Parliament and the wider public.<lb/></p>

			<head>Fiscal rules<lb/></head>

			<p>In the same way as an annual budget, a medium-term expenditure framework can be adjusted every<lb/> year, which limits its scope to discipline fiscal policy decision making. Thus, fiscal rules would be a useful<lb/> complement that could be used to enforce the framework and achieve a medium-term fiscal target. They<lb/> may also help to increase financial market confidence in the government&apos;s commitment to its medium-term<lb/> plan. However, a poor track record of compliance with fiscal rules so far (the Stability and Growth Pact)<lb/> means that the latter benefit may take some time to materialise for Portugal.<lb/> Recent and on-going decisions at the EU level in the context of the euro sovereign debt crisis have<lb/> increased the number and overall strictness of common fiscal rules. There is now a complex web of four<lb/> partially overlapping rules: the excessive deficit rule that requires the deficit to be below 3% of GDP; a<lb/> debt convergence rule requiring the gross debt in excess of 60% of GDP to be reduced on average by at<lb/> least 1/20th per year; an expenditure rule which constrains expenditure to increase by no more that the<lb/> growth of potential GDP (with a lower reference rate for countries with a structural deficit below the<lb/> medium-term objective – benchmark is a structural deficit of no more than 0.5% of GDP) unless there are<lb/> explicit revenue raising measures; and a structural balance rule to reduce the annual structural deficit to<lb/> below 0.5% of GDP in steps to be determined by the European Commission. In the case of Portugal these<lb/> steps are already pre-determined through to 2014 by the EU-IMF programme.<lb/> Which rule is the binding constraint depends on circumstances, but recent EU communication has<lb/> mainly focused on the structural balance rule (see European <ref type="biblio">Council, 2011</ref>), which Portugal has enshrined<lb/> in the new 2011 Budget Framework law. The new rule will apply from 2015 with the programme targets<lb/> governing the path for the fiscal balance up until 2014. Rules should tackle as directly as possible the<lb/> underlying source of the weak fiscal position (<ref type="biblio">Sutherland et al., 2012</ref>), which in the case of Portugal is a<lb/> failure to control primary expenditure (<ref type="biblio">Hauptmeier et al., 2011</ref>). Rules also need to be not unduly rigid<lb/> (<ref type="biblio">Schick, 2010</ref>), easily understood and monitored by the parliament and public, have broad coverage and be<lb/> operationalised easily. On this basis, Portugal should also legislate an explicit expenditure rule that limits<lb/> public expenditure growth relative to the estimated growth rate of potential nominal GDP (as estimated<lb/> ex ante), and use this to set enforceable nominal expenditure ceilings for general government to facilitate<lb/> monitoring.<lb/> ECO/WKP(2012)62<lb/> Historical experience suggests countries with multiple rules have been more successful in carrying out<lb/> consolidations and stabilising debt (<ref type="biblio">Guichard et al., 2007; IMF, 2009; Sutherland et al., 2012</ref>). Concerns<lb/> about over-determining fiscal policy with multiple rules can be mitigated by parameterising such a<lb/> numerical expenditure rule to be consistent with the structural balance rule obligation – the change in the<lb/> balance being approximately equal to the difference between the growth rate of expenditure and potential<lb/> nominal GDP weighted by the expenditure share in GDP. 2 With the current need to consolidate the fiscal<lb/> position, this would require setting expenditure growth below potential nominal GDP growth for many<lb/> years, which would be in line with the EU level expenditure rule obligation.<lb/></p>

			<p>An expenditure rule provides a way of making the structural balance rule operational because<lb/> performance against the expenditure rule can be judged against a simple observable target, expenditure,<lb/> whereas the structural balance cannot be observed, but only estimated, with estimates typically revised<lb/> significantly over time. Experience elsewhere suggests that the ease of observing compliance becomes an<lb/> important issue in practice. For example, the Swedish Fiscal Policy council found it difficult to assess<lb/> compliance with the government&apos;s target of a 1% surplus over the cycle (<ref type="biblio">Calmfors, 2010</ref>). Disputes over<lb/> when the cycle started and finished were among the most contentious aspects of the &quot; over the cycle &quot; rule<lb/> that operated in the United Kingdom until the end of 2008 (OECD, 2009c). The potential gains from an<lb/> expenditure rule are demonstrated by simulations showing that, if Portugal had followed this type of rule<lb/> from 1999 to 2009 using real time data and limited primary expenditure growth to an estimate of potential<lb/> nominal GDP growth, the debt-to-GDP ratio would have been 17 percentage points of GDP lower by 2009<lb/> (<ref type="biblio">Hauptmeier et al., 2011</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<head>Establishing a fiscal council<lb/></head>

			<p>A fiscal council can complement fiscal rules by providing a body to assess whether the government is<lb/> complying with them. A council can also help to give flexibility to fiscal rules and suggest improvements<lb/> to them (<ref type="biblio">Calmfors and Wren Lewis, 2011</ref>). In October 2011, the government passed legislation<lb/> establishing an independent fiscal council. This is welcome, as it will bring independent, intellectually<lb/> rigorous scrutiny to fiscal policy. The Council comprises five senior council members of which two may<lb/> be non-Portuguese citizens, as well as a secretariat of analytical support staff. The board members were<lb/> appointed by the end of 2011 with analytical staff appointments taking place in 2012. A first report was<lb/> issued in May 2012, focusing on the broad aspects of the government&apos;s budgetary strategy (<ref type="biblio">Portuguese<lb/> Public Finance Council, 2012</ref>). The Council&apos;s main recommendations were for the government to hand<lb/> over responsibility for macroeconomic forecasts to an independent institution and, as recommended in this<lb/> Survey, set expenditure ceilings for general government.<lb/> The Council has a very wide remit. In addition to what are becoming standard tasks for these<lb/> institutions internationally of assessing central government macroeconomic and fiscal forecasts and<lb/> compliance with fiscal rules, the Council also has responsibility for assessing the financial position of local<lb/> governments and state owned enterprises and analysing existing commitments including, pensions, health<lb/> care, public-private partnerships and tax expenditures. The government is required by law to provide to the<lb/> Council in a timely manner all economic and financial information it requires to complete its mission. The<lb/> law also requires the Council&apos;s reports to be sent to the President of the Republic, the government, the<lb/> 2.<lb/> More exactly, assuming a constant elasticity of revenue to GDP:<lb/></p>

			<p>where ∆sb is the change in the structural balance, EXP is expenditure, GDP is nominal potential GDP, g is the<lb/> growth rate of nominal potential GDP and α is the growth rate of total expenditure.<lb/> parliament, the Court of Auditors and the central bank. The Council is a complementary fiscal institution to<lb/> the Parliamentary technical budget support unit (UTAO) set up in 2006. In this context, it will be important<lb/> to ensure regular information exchanges with this unit. The design of the fiscal council has already drawn<lb/> on this unit&apos;s experience and should continue to do so, particularly in interacting with the parliament which<lb/> will be a key client of the Council.<lb/> The provision to allow for up to two non-Portuguese citizens on the board will widen the range of<lb/> perspectives. However, the government should relax the prohibition on board members having other paid<lb/> activity. Other countries allow board members to hold concurrent positions and the prohibition is a serious<lb/> constraint on recruitment where some of the potential candidates could be academics or economists in<lb/> policy organisations who would be reluctant to fully give up their current jobs.<lb/> The Council&apos;s broad remit appropriately recognises that fiscal problems at the general government<lb/> level can often arise outside the central government as has occurred in Portugal in recent years. However, it<lb/> will be important to ensure resources available to the Council are commensurate with its wide remit. The<lb/> Council will require significant analytic and specialised resources to meet the challenge of giving advice<lb/> across such a broad range of areas. In the first instance the Council should prioritise core functions,<lb/> including assessing the macroeconomic and fiscal projections, compliance with fiscal rules and giving<lb/> fiscal policy recommendations to the government. Assessing the forecasts is an important task as<lb/> international experience shows that over-optimistic macroeconomic forecasts are a notable source of<lb/> deficit bias (<ref type="biblio">Hagemann, 2010</ref>). Furthermore, there is evidence that Fiscal Councils that provide policy<lb/> recommendations rather than just analysis are more effective (<ref type="biblio">Debrun et al., 2009</ref>). Concentrating efforts<lb/> will also help the Council to establish a reputation for high quality non-partisan work and therefore cement<lb/> its role in the national debate and policy process.<lb/></p>

			<p>Giving the Council strong power to request information from the government is also welcome, as<lb/> limited access to important fiscal information has reduced the effectiveness of councils elsewhere (<ref type="biblio">Kopits,<lb/> 2011</ref>). The Council&apos;s role should be further embedded in the policy debate by requiring the Minister of<lb/> Finance to provide a formal response, including appearing before the Parliamentary Finance Committee, to<lb/> Fiscal Council reports. Finally, the Council should engage early in developing communication channels,<lb/> particularly with the media which are the main channel of influence of the Council as it can only persuade<lb/> and not coerce (<ref type="biblio">Kopits, 2011</ref>).<lb/> The budgetary process provides only short periods for scrutiny of the <ref type="biblio">Budget (OECD, 2008a</ref>). This is<lb/> inconsistent with OECD guidelines on budget transparency (<ref type="biblio">OECD, 2002</ref>), which suggest that the<lb/> parliament should have three months to scrutinise the budget rather than the current one and a half months.<lb/> This meant that the Parliamentary technical budget support unit (UTAO) had only ten calendar days to<lb/> analyse the State Budget and eight days for the Stability Programme annual update. This constraint will<lb/> also affect the new Fiscal Council as there have been no changes to extend the parliamentary timetables to<lb/> approve the budget. Given the complexity of the budget and the severe implications of mistakes, the<lb/> government should extend the time available to the Fiscal Council to analyse and report on the budget<lb/> beyond that which was available to UTAO. This will help to ensure the Council can properly fulfil its<lb/> functions.<lb/></p>

			<head>Public sector efficiency and off-balance sheet liabilities<lb/> Raising the game of the SOE sector<lb/></head>

			<p>Although previous privatisations have reduced the size of the state-owned enterprise (SOE) sector, in<lb/> 2010 it still accounted for 4.5% of GDP and 3.5% of employment (DGTF, 2011a), (<ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref>). The<lb/> corporatisation of a high proportion of hospitals partly explains this, as they represent more than half of<lb/> SOE employees. More recently restructuring in the SOE sector has seen staff levels decline in areas such<lb/> as the transport sector where personnel declined by 12% in the second half of 2011. The poor performance<lb/> of the SOE sector overall is illustrated by the EUR 1.9 billion (1.1% of GDP) loss by the sector in 2011 on<lb/> total assets of EUR 55.8 billion (32% of GDP). Poor performance of enterprises classified inside the<lb/> general government sector, which account for most of the losses, directly affects the government&apos;s<lb/> accounts. Those located outside general government represent a contingent liability, which may move on<lb/> budget in the case of their reclassification to the general government sector or trigger a need to support<lb/> them with debt guarantees or capital injections.<lb/></p>

			<figure>Figure 6. Employment in state-owned enterprises<lb/> Employees in SOEs in per cent of total employment, 2009<lb/> 1<lb/> 1.<lb/> Or latest year available. State-owned enterprises (SOEs) cover firms that are majority owned by the government or those where<lb/> the government owns at least 10% of the common share capital listed.<lb/></figure>

			<table>Source: H. Christiansen (2011), &quot; The Size and Composition of the SOE Sector in OECD Countries &quot; , OECD Corporate Governance<lb/> Working Papers, No. 5.<lb/></table>

			<p>Many SOEs have been financially underperforming. Losses have been large in the urban passenger<lb/> transport, rail and hospital sub-sectors (<ref type="figure">Figure 7</ref>). This partly reflects extremely high debt and associated<lb/> debt servicing costs. Several of these companies are technically insolvent and the SOE sector as a whole<lb/> has negative equity of EUR 2 billion. Nearly all of these loss-making companies (Carris, a public transport<lb/> company, is an exception) are also making losses on an EBITDA (earnings before interest taxes,<lb/> depreciation and amortisation) indicating that they are also operationally weak.<lb/> The reclassification by Eurostat of three SOEs as part of the general government sector has increased<lb/> the urgency of solving these problems as their losses now have an immediate impact on the fiscal balance<lb/> and debt. The reclassified companies are among the largest loss making SOEs (the rail track company,<lb/> REFER, and the Lisbon and Porto metro companies), adding around ½ per cent of GDP to the fiscal deficit<lb/> between 2007 and 2010 (<ref type="biblio">Statistics Portugal, 2011; Ministry of Finance, 2011b</ref>). Occasional capital<lb/> transfers from government to SOEs have been used to prop up ailing enterprises and prolong this process.<lb/> However, experience shows this former strategy is not sustainable in the medium-run as Eurostat will<lb/> reclassify particularly bad loss making enterprises as part of the general government sector, in which case<lb/> the liability is immediately made explicit.<lb/> Running SOEs at a loss in sectors such as urban transport and health care and building up off balance<lb/> sheet liabilities, including in the case of hospitals through payment arrears, reflected a non-transparent<lb/> subsidisation of government services. In the short-run, lower priced but potentially inefficient services are<lb/> delivered to the population without recognising explicitly the associated public cost. Alternatively, the debt<lb/> of the SOE may become so large that it does not have enough free cash flow to pay suppliers and creditors<lb/> and therefore to operate commercially. Operating the SOE sector in this way has also had negative<lb/> externalities in the form of creating government guaranteed debtors that crowd out private sector<lb/> borrowing and investment (<ref type="biblio">Pina and Abreu, 2012</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<p>Both the operation of SOEs and the policy framework that surrounds them should continue to be<lb/> reformed. At issue are which enterprises the government should continue to own and how the performance<lb/> and governance of these remaining companies can be improved. Part of the programme conditions are to<lb/> privatise a number of enterprises including Aeroportos de Portugal (ANA), the national airline (TAP), the<lb/> national postal service, Correios de Portugal (CTT), railway freight branch (CP Cargo), the insurance arm<lb/> of a government bank (Caixa Seguros). The sale timetable is ambitious, with all of these assets<lb/> programmed to be sold by early 2013. By mid-2012, the government had already executed the partial sale<lb/> of REN and the sale of its remaining stake in the former electricity generating incumbent (EDP) and<lb/> initiated the sale of ANA and TAP. The government had also announced that it intends to grant<lb/> concessions to run the newly merged Lisbon metro and road public transport services companies as well as<lb/> rail services. A partial sale of the television channel (RTP) along with a concession to run the water<lb/> company Águas de Portugal (AdP) is being considered.<lb/></p>

			<p>With the exception of the airline, TAP, the companies that are to be sold are profitable, which should<lb/> increase the chances of prompt sales. In addition, they are engaged in commercial activities that the private<lb/> sector can be expected to provide. The government should prioritise maximising the contribution to<lb/> Portugal&apos;s long-term growth potential from the sale of these assets over a quick sale, especially at a time of<lb/> crisis, when conditions for asset sales may not be the best. In any case, these are complex assets operating<lb/> in industries where a healthy competitive market cannot be taken for granted due to natural monopoly<lb/> characteristics and other barriers to entry. This means that a straight sale of these assets risks transforming<lb/> public monopolies into private ones, with no real possibility of competition entering the market. An<lb/> important part of privatisation will therefore be to ensure that the company structure and the regulatory<lb/> framework are pro-competitive prior to any sale. For example, the government should consider splitting<lb/> some of these firms into competing companies before selling them, even if this may delay sales. The<lb/> government should also involve the competition authority in the design of the sale and the regulatory<lb/> framework.<lb/></p>

			<p>In terms of operational performance the government is developing a strategy for all SOEs with<lb/> commercial activities (excluding the rail track company REFER and the health sector) to achieve<lb/> operational balance by the end of 2012. Part of this are plans to reduce operational costs by at least 15%<lb/> through decreasing the cost of supplies, external services and labour (DGTF, 2011a). The elimination of<lb/> the 13th and 14th month salaries for all public sector employees including those in SOEs plays a major role<lb/> in the latter. In the short-run redundancy costs resulting from cuts in staff will temporarily slowdown<lb/> improvement.<lb/></p>

			<p>The losses of the Lisbon and Porto metro companies are so large that they are noticeable at an overall<lb/> government budget level, with a combined net financial loss of EUR 980 million (0.5% of GDP) in 2011,<lb/> of which more than half represented an operational loss. For the Lisbon metro a fundamental problem is<lb/> that payments to suppliers and particularly staff have been increasing faster than sales revenue.</p>

			<figure>From 2005<lb/> to 2010 staff payments rose by 18% and revenue from sales only rose by 7%. To prevent further<lb/> deterioration in operational results, payments to staff will need to be far more tightly controlled. The Porto<lb/> metro has had more success in cutting supplier costs and operational revenue coverage of costs improved<lb/> between 2009 and 2010. To help close the gap between revenue and costs further, prices were significantly<lb/> increased (by around 20%) for urban public transport in 2011 and the government&apos;s strategy is to increase<lb/> them over time to comparable EU levels.<lb/></figure>

			<p>The national rail track company, REFER and the national operator of train services, Comboios de<lb/> Portugal (CP), are also making large operational losses. Durably improving their operational performance<lb/> may require further rationalising networks by closing underutilised and unprofitable lines and replacing<lb/> them with bus services (where these are viable). Indeed, most of CP passenger&apos;s past operational losses<lb/> have been incurred by CP regional in providing only 20% of CP&apos;s total available seat kilometres. Train<lb/> services should only be provided on lines with high traffic density as the large fixed costs incurred in<lb/> providing rail services mean the combined costs of CP and REFER per passenger kilometre rise drastically<lb/> as total passenger kilometres on a line fall. On this basis, four lines were closed in 2009 and replaced with<lb/> bus services that can be provided at a small fraction of the cost of train services (Ministry of the Economy,<lb/> 2011). From 2011 through to mid 2012 a further 410 kilometres of underperforming parts of the network<lb/> were deactivated. The government should continue to rationalise the network to eliminate remaining high<lb/> cost lines to further reduce operational losses. Improving CP operational performance would also give<lb/> more scope to raise infrastructure charges paid by the freight operation (scheduled for privatisation) to<lb/> REFER and thereby reduce the losses of REFER.<lb/></p>

			<p>Currently the revenue REFER earns from train operators is far below the costs of providing rail<lb/> infrastructure and does not even cover staff costs. By international comparison, REFER&apos;s charges for<lb/> utilising and managing infrastructure are below average overall and particularly for freight (<ref type="figure">Figure 8</ref>).<lb/> A constraint on improving the bottom-line are EU network access pricing rules which prevent REFER<lb/> from raising track access charges to recover the large investment costs it has incurred in recent times to<lb/> modernise the network. The company has announced it wants to reduce losses through a 35% cut in staff<lb/> and also other expenses in 2012. To help ensure this cost cutting is sustainable the government should<lb/> continue to close the most unprofitable tracks in tandem with the rationalisation of train services by CP.<lb/> However, cutting costs and raising prices may not close the financial gap of certain public transport<lb/> companies, meaning that they would have to rely on subsidies. This may be economically justifiable as<lb/> those travelling on public transport generate positive externalities relatively to travelling by car.<lb/> Nevertheless, in line with OECD Guidelines on Corporate Governance of State-Owned Enterprises, it is<lb/> important that this subsidy is explicitly set and shown in the government&apos;s accounts in return for an agreed<lb/> level of services, rather than via an accumulation of non-transparent losses. The public transport companies<lb/> should be required to achieve at least operational balance after subsidies under such an agreement or face<lb/> immediate corrective actions to restore balance.<lb/></p>

			<p>Even if operational balance is achieved in loss making SOEs, the legacy of past recurrent losses has<lb/> left them with a heavy debt burden that will continue to hinder financial performance. In some cases the<lb/> debt has reached such high levels that it cannot easily be repaid. To put these SOEs back in a commercially<lb/> viable position, their debt needs to be reduced to serviceable levels while avoiding future moral hazard<lb/> through a better governance regime. The government is preparing a plan to tackle the debt burden issue<lb/> that is due in July. To ensure this process is transparent the government should consider a one-off transfer<lb/> of part of SOE debt to a government entity charged with repaying it from government revenues assigned to<lb/> this entity for this purpose.<lb/></p>

			<p>The government is introducing a new legal framework for SOEs and has plans to improve SOE<lb/> governance. A new law changing the way SOE managers are recruited and remunerated was passed in<lb/> January 2012 and further reforms are planned. A draft law to be considered by the parliament and applying<lb/> to central and local SOEs envisages a new technical unit to monitor SOEs and to inter alia advise ex ante<lb/> on whether establishing new SOEs is in the public interest. The government&apos;s plan to ensure the new<lb/> framework also tackles the capability and authority of SOEs to enter into derivative contracts is welcome<lb/> as a large contributor to the losses of the metro companies is from bets on interest rate derivatives which<lb/> should have been used exclusively as a hedging tool.<lb/></p>

			<head>Public-private partnerships have created a significant future drain on fiscal resources<lb/></head>

			<p>From 1990 to 2010 Portugal was the third biggest user of public-private partnerships (PPPs) in<lb/> Europe, after the United Kingdom and Spain and the highest user relative to GDP (Kappeler and Nemoz,<lb/> 2010; EPEC, 2010; <ref type="figure">Figure 9</ref>). Accumulated investment in PPPs increased from EUR 9.3 billion in 2005 to<lb/> EUR 16.2 billion (9.5% of GDP) in 2011 (DGTF, 2011a). As elsewhere in continental Europe, the vast<lb/> bulk (79%) of these projects were roads, with rail (18%) and health (2%) accounting for most of the<lb/> remainder (<ref type="biblio">Kappeler and Nemoz, 2010</ref>).<lb/> Concerning roads, a variety of private-partnership models were introduced in three main waves<lb/> (<ref type="table">Table 2</ref>). Estradas de Portugal (EP), a 100% state-owned company that is classified within general<lb/> government, is the government&apos;s principal road concessionaire. EP has in turn granted sub-concessions to<lb/> private partners. In 2010 and 2011, the government negotiated with private partners to convert all the<lb/> &quot; shadow &quot; toll roads -where the government paid tolls on behalf of users -to standard toll roads where<lb/> users are charged a toll. This resulted in reclassification of the road investment as part of the general<lb/></p>

In essence the central<lb/> government is carrying most of the risk in the project and therefore the road is treated as a public asset.<lb/></p>

			<p>The large PPP programme has created a significant and growing payment obligation for the<lb/> government (<ref type="figure">Figure 10</ref>). The PPP payment obligations have a net present value of EUR 10.7 billion (6.3%<lb/> of GDP) in 2012 and yearly payments are projected to rise from EUR 1 billion in 2012 to EUR 1.5 billion<lb/> by 2015 as new roads currently under construction are completed. The payment problem has become more<lb/> acute with the sovereign debt crisis as EP can no longer access market finance (despite being operationally<lb/> profitable) and is therefore fully reliant on financing from the central government.<lb/></p>

			<p>Significant risk surrounds these net payment projections. Net payments by the government were 20%<lb/> higher than forecast in both 2011 and 2010 albeit essentially due to one-off factors. The largest risks lie in<lb/> transport PPPs (road and rail) arising from assumptions such as traffic flows (DGTF, 2011b). Indeed, there<lb/> are some signs that toll revenue projections could prove too optimistic. Although this is difficult to separate<lb/> from recessionary effects, demand appears to have reacted strongly to the introduction of real tolls on<lb/> former shadow toll roads, with traffic declining by half on one of them. The allocation of risk between<lb/> public and private parties is complex and depends on the particular PPP. In general, for road design,<lb/> building and maintenance, availability and raising finance risk usually lie with the private sector as well as<lb/> demand for private concessions for real toll roads (DGTF, 2011b).<lb/> The government carries demand risk in the case of EP sub-concessions where the government<lb/> receives toll revenue from users, which are now the dominant concession model. In addition, under<lb/> contracts signed prior to 2003 the government carried the risk of extra costs of having to relocate to<lb/> different land for a road corridor, for example due to environmental reasons, which was part of the reason<lb/> PPP payments exceeded forecasts in both 2010 and 2011. Generally the government should only transfer<lb/> risks to the private sector that the private sector can control such as construction risk (<ref type="biblio">Araújo and<lb/> Sutherland, 2010</ref>). In the case of roads it is arguable that the private partner can influence demand, for<lb/> example through road quality, and therefore should bear at least some of this risk rather than transferring<lb/> all of it to the government as has been done with the EP concessions.<lb/> As part of the programme, no new PPP contract will be signed in the short term and the pressing<lb/> policy issue is to reduce future costs and risks arising from existing PPPs. The government has already<lb/> taken action to start reducing its obligations. In the rail area, the three high speed train (TGV) projects<lb/> (Lisbon-Porto and Porto-Vigo and the link to Spain) have been cancelled. In the roads area, the conversion<lb/> of former shadow toll roads to toll roads is a welcome addition to revenue for these projects and the<lb/> government should extend coverage to the approximately 200 kilometres of highway that is currently not<lb/> designated for tolls yet. The government has also engaged an international accounting firm to report in<lb/> June in more detail the contingent liabilities under the PPPs and the probability of these materialising. It<lb/></p>

To resolve existing PPPs,<lb/> a mixture of measures could be taken, depending on the exact circumstances of each PPP including:<lb/> renegotiating terms; cancelling projects when still at an early stage; or the buying back of PPP roads<lb/> (Reis, 2012).<lb/></figure>

			<p>In the future, PPPs can still potentially be a useful model for delivery services, particularly when there<lb/> is a positive externality between the construction and operating phases, which gives incentives for the<lb/> private sector to internalise the costs of service provision and asset maintenance in its decisions at the<lb/> construction phase (<ref type="biblio">Araújo and Sutherland, 2010</ref>). However, they should be chosen because they represent<lb/> good value for money and not to postpone expenditure. The literature and international experience suggest<lb/> a number of factors that can help to ensure that a PPP is the right delivery model and maximises value for<lb/> money. These include specifying contracts in terms of outputs instead of inputs in order to maximise the<lb/> benefits of private sector technical expertise and management skills; an ex ante evaluation of PPP versus<lb/> public procurement; a public body obtaining planning and environmental permissions in advance of tender<lb/> to avoid delays; and proper fiscal accounting for PPPs including recording them in contingent liabilities<lb/> (<ref type="biblio">Araújo and Sutherland, 2010</ref>).<lb/> By international standards, the efficiency enhancing features of Portugal&apos;s PPP framework appear<lb/> relatively strong on paper and the government is intending further improvements (<ref type="figure">Figure 11</ref>). It is setting<lb/> up a technical unit of around ten PPP experts in the Ministry of Finance to advise the minister on all<lb/> aspects of launching, designing and monitoring PPP projects where investment exceeds EUR 25 million.<lb/> This is welcome, as expertise is a key constraint on getting the most out of the PPP model. Similar units<lb/> exist in Ireland and Italy. Such a unit can also have useful role in spreading knowledge to local<lb/> government, which has less experience in managing PPPs.<lb/></p>

Sutherland (2010), &quot; Public-Private Partnerships and Investment in Infrastructure &quot; , OECD Economics<lb/> Department Working Papers, No. 803.<lb/></figure>

			<p>However, past experience shows that it is important that the new framework is actually implemented<lb/> and in particular that analysis done by the unit is fully taken into account by political decisions. In this<lb/> regard, the government&apos;s intention that all PPP project proposals will be compared against an ordinary<lb/> public procurement alternative and the results made publicly available and presented to the parliament is<lb/> welcome. In addition, there is a need for a proper assessment of the full implications for the budget<lb/> position of PPPs over their whole life-cycle and the government should further reform how PPPs are<lb/> included in the budget planning by accounting for capital expenditure on them on the same basis as the<lb/> alternative of an ordinary public investment.<lb/></p>

			<head>Local and regional governments&apos; debt issues are leading the central government to step in<lb/></head>

			<p>Portugal is a fairly centralised country (Box 1), but subnational government nevertheless poses<lb/> important fiscal issues. Since 2009, local and regional authorities have faced declining revenues, due to<lb/> cuts in central government transfers and depressed tax receipts, particularly on housing transactions. They<lb/> reacted by cutting spending, but not rapidly enough to prevent the accumulation of debt (<ref type="figure">Figure 12</ref>). The<lb/> total deficit of local government (including autonomous regions) reached 0.8% of GDP in 2009-10, before<lb/> halving in 2011. Local debt has risen to a high international level (<ref type="figure">Figure 13</ref>) and local governments have<lb/> lost access to long-term bank credit in the wake of the sovereign debt crisis. As a result, a large number of<lb/> municipalities as well as the region of Madeira have accumulated unsustainable short-term debt and<lb/> payment arrears, notably through local public companies. This makes it difficult to assess the total extent<lb/> of their liabilities, although audits carried out by the central government in the first half of 2012 resulted in<lb/> significant progress in this direction.<lb/></p>

			<head>Box 1. The structure of Portuguese subnational government<lb/></head>

			<p>There are no elected regional governments on the mainland, meaning that local government is essentially<lb/> concentrated at the municipal level and in the two autonomous regions of the Azores and Madeira. Municipalities are<lb/> relatively large by European standards (34 000 inhabitants on average) and are subdivided into civil parishes in charge<lb/> of lower administrative functions. More precisely, Portugal is subdivided into:<lb/></p>

			<figure>• 2 autonomous regions: the Azores and Madeira, which enjoy a large autonomy guaranteed by the<lb/></figure>

			<p>Portuguese Constitution, elect their own regional government and legislative assembly and keep tax<lb/> receipts collected in their jurisdiction. In addition, the mainland is subdivided in five regions, which were<lb/> originally created to manage EU structural funds, and whose role has grown to include wider regional<lb/> development issues. Mainland regions have no elected government and are directly administered by central<lb/> government representatives – the so-called Commissions for Regional Coordination and Development<lb/> (CCDR).<lb/></p>

			<head>• 308 municipalities</head>

			<p>– mainly in charge of basic infrastructure and primary education. They are run by an<lb/> executive council and a municipal assembly, both elected for four years. In the past few years,<lb/> municipalities have been encouraged to associate into inter-municipal communities, which have the right to<lb/> collect certain taxes and have a bigger role in the management of EU funds.<lb/></p>

			<head>• 4 259 civil parishes (freguesias)</head>

			<p>– in charge of local current administration and maintenance of certain<lb/> basic infrastructure. The number of parishes per municipalities (14 on average) varies widely, from 1 to 89.<lb/> Parishes are managed by a local assembly and an elected local council, the president of which also sits in<lb/> the municipal assembly. Their economic weight is relatively small, with an overall budget of around<lb/> EUR 450 million (0.3% of GDP).<lb/></p>

			<head>Supporting local governments involves a trade-off<lb/></head>

			<p>Faced with severe fiscal problems in the autonomous region of Madeira, the central government<lb/> decided to step in with a EUR 1.5 billion (0.9% of GDP) financial assistance plan (Box 2). The<lb/> government also agreed to support distressed municipalities with a EUR 1 billion (0.6% of GDP) credit<lb/> line. This will allow municipalities to pay back part of their short-term debt and arrears, the total of which<lb/> for all local and regional authorities reached EUR 4 billion (2.3% of GDP) by the end of 2011. 3 In<lb/> exchange for this support, municipalities have notably committed to cut spending and increase taxes<lb/> (where possible) and fees. The government expects more than half of municipalities to apply for the credit<lb/> line. Applications will be examined by the government in mid-2012. In this context, it is important that the<lb/> conditions under which municipalities receive support, and how much support each municipality is entitled<lb/> to, follow strict and transparent guidelines, as envisaged, to ensure equal treatment of municipalities and<lb/> avoid political interference.<lb/> The central government does not explicitly guarantee local debts and faces a trade-off between<lb/> supporting distressed local authorities and letting them default. On the one hand, financial support to local<lb/> governments could generate significant fiscal costs for the central government at a time of scarce fiscal<lb/> resources. These costs would also risk increasing in the future if the economic outlook (and thus local<lb/> revenues) deteriorates further. Another drawback is moral hazard, as the possibility of financial assistance<lb/> could undermine prudence in future local policymaking, as occurred in Sweden in the 1970s-80s<lb/> (Pettersson-<ref type="biblio">Lidbom and Dahlberg, 2003</ref>). On the other hand, a wave of local defaults would impose losses<lb/> on Portuguese banks, thus augmenting already significant recapitalisation needs. In the current context, it<lb/> could also affect investors&apos; confidence in other public borrowers, including the central government itself.<lb/> Overall, this suggests that financial assistance should be provided to distressed local government in cases<lb/> of liquidity problems, i.e. when limited and temporary support would suffice to restore debt sustainability,<lb/> but that the government should be ready to accept defaults of insolvent authorities in some instances, so as<lb/> to reduce moral hazard issues.<lb/></p>

			<figure>3.<lb/> Combined arrears of local and regional governments reached EUR 2.8 billion by the end of 2011 (European<lb/> Commission, 2012), while their short term debt (less than one year) was EUR 1.3 billion (Bank of Portugal,<lb/> 2012).<lb/> 0<lb/> 50<lb/> 100<lb/> 150<lb/> 200<lb/> 250<lb/> 0<lb/> 50<lb/> 100<lb/> 150<lb/> 200<lb/> 250<lb/> Box 2.

			<p>Once Portugal&apos;s poorest region, Madeira has become the country&apos;s second richest over recent decades, thanks<lb/> notably to large subsidies from the central government and the EU. In 2008, regional GDP per capita was 30% higher<lb/> than the national average. Large infrastructure works have helped develop tourism – the island&apos;s main activity (20% of<lb/> regional GDP) – while a low-tax business zone has attracted important off-shore business activities (20% of regional<lb/> GDP). Over the past few years, subsidies have become less abundant as a result of the region&apos;s economic progress.<lb/> However, public spending has not slowed accordingly, leading to the rapid accumulation of debts as large construction<lb/> projects were still undertaken, including a marina and a heliport (both of which are out-of-use because of flawed<lb/> design).<lb/> Unsustainable debt dynamics resulted in Madeira&apos;s regional government looking for financial support. The central<lb/> government agreed in January 2012 to provide EUR 1.5 billion (0.9% of national GDP, 30% of regional GDP) of loans<lb/> to the region, with an interest rate comparable to the central government&apos;s financing costs. The fiscal consolidation<lb/> plan aimed at reducing the regional public deficit from 6% of regional GDP in 2011 (excluding negative one-offs of 11%<lb/> of regional GDP) to 3% of regional GDP in 2012, 1% in 2013 and to balance the budget by 2014. However, the 2011<lb/> deficit turned out higher than expected by 3½ per cent of regional GDP, putting these objectives at risk. The<lb/> consolidation relies mainly on the revenue side (two thirds of the adjustment).* Income tax and general corporate tax<lb/> rates will be aligned with mainland levels and the value-added tax rate will be raised from 16% to 21%, one percentage<lb/> point below the mainland level. The privileges of the low-tax business zone will be reduced, with a corporate tax rate<lb/> raised from 0% to 4%. On the spending side, measures include a cap on public investment at EUR 150 million per year<lb/> – roughly its underlying level in 2010-11 after correcting for one-offs – and lower public wages, mainly as a result of the<lb/> national level cut in the 13th and 14th month of civil servants&apos; salary.<lb/></p>

			<p>Financial assistance is conditional on a strong reinforcement of the fiscal framework. The budget will be subject<lb/> to central government approval before it is voted and its execution will be closely monitored. An audit on arrears, which<lb/> amount to 40% of regional GDP has been carried out in early 2012. However, the size of the region&apos;s total liabilities,<lb/> i.e. including all liabilities of local public companies, is still uncertain. These companies are planned to be restructured<lb/> and partly privatised. No new public-private partnership (PPP) can be contracted until existing PPPs are audited and<lb/> renegotiated. Disbursements of the central government loans will be spread over 2012-15 and conditional to the region<lb/> complying with the programme. Compliance will be assessed through quarterly mission reviews, starting in April 2012.<lb/> Such a strict conditionality is important, as the constitutional autonomy of the region otherwise restricts the central<lb/> government&apos;s ability to influence the region&apos;s policy, as illustrated by its inability in 2011 to stop construction projects<lb/> judged too costly.<lb/></p>

			<p>* However, against a no-policy change scenario, the programme contains more measures on the spending side than on the<lb/> revenue side, reflecting that a large planned increase in public investment in 2012 (EUR 400 million, excluding one-offs) was<lb/> cancelled as part of the programme, meaning that public investment will remain broadly stable between 2011 and 2012<lb/> (excluding one-offs).<lb/></p>

			<p>In the case of Madeira, there are significant risks to the programme as the 2011 deficit turned out<lb/> higher than expected and the region&apos;s total liabilities (including arrears and debt from local public<lb/> companies) are still unknown, but may be as high as 150% of regional GDP. In addition, the programme<lb/> assumption that the region will grow at the same pace as the country as a whole appears to be relatively<lb/> fragile, especially given the traditionally high reliance on public demand in the region. The programme&apos;s<lb/> success will depend on the region&apos;s capacity to find new sources of private growth despite the increase in<lb/> taxes and to respect expenditure targets, notably on public investment. This will require a strong<lb/> reinforcement of the regional fiscal framework. The central government should carefully monitor the<lb/> solvency of the region as there is a significant risk that the region may not be able to pay back all of its<lb/> debt, thereby making debt restructuring inevitable.<lb/></p>

			<head>Measures are needed to improve the local and regional fiscal framework<lb/></head>

			<p>It is also important that financial support to municipalities be accompanied by an enhanced local and<lb/> regional fiscal framework to ensure debt reduction in the medium-term. To this end, the government is<lb/> committed to presenting revised local and regional financing laws by the end of 2012. Important steps in<lb/> this area were already taken in the 2007 reform of the local finance law, which notably requires<lb/> municipalities to consolidate their accounts with those of local public companies and to submit them to<lb/> external auditing. However, implementation of these measures has been delayed by municipal opposition<lb/> (<ref type="biblio">Blöchliger and Vammalle, 2012</ref>). In the current context, implementing them rapidly should be a priority.<lb/> The 2007 reform also introduced limits on municipal total debt (125% of annual revenues) and short-term<lb/> debt (10% of annual revenues). In order to prevent any circumventing of these rules, their scope should be<lb/> broadened to include all liabilities of local authorities, such as payment arrears, debts of local public<lb/> companies and discounted future payments in PPP contracts. Additionally, a balanced budget rule could be<lb/> introduced, a relatively common feature across OECD local governments (<ref type="biblio">Sutherland et al., 2005</ref>) that<lb/> would offer the benefit of consistency with the general government&apos;s broader deficit rule.<lb/></p>

			<p>The local fiscal framework should also give incentives for local and regional authorities to pay back<lb/> arrears, which had accumulated to almost EUR 2.8 billion (1.6% of GDP) by the end of 2011 and were still<lb/> increasing in the first months of 2012. To this end, the government intends to apply to municipalities the<lb/> budgetary &quot; commitment control &quot; framework which has been put in place at the central level. In this<lb/> framework, entities are not allowed to spend more money than they project to receive and entities with<lb/> spending arrears are forced to adopt more ambitious spending limits. To make the framework fully<lb/> efficient, it will be necessary to prevent municipalities from relying on over-optimistic revenue forecasts, a<lb/> frequent practice in the past. This will require giving the Ministry of Finance a supervisory role in this<lb/> area, while the Fiscal Council could also be involved in monitoring tasks. In addition, municipalities<lb/> should be required to keep their funds in a dedicated account at the Treasury (instead of a private bank<lb/> account), as a way to facilitate monitoring and to reduce general government gross public debt (via more<lb/> debt consolidation).<lb/></p>

			<head>The cyclicality of local revenues should be reduced<lb/></head>

			<p>Local revenues are particularly cyclical and their abrupt decline in the last few years has been an<lb/> important factor behind the accumulation of local debt. Local revenues include a housing transaction tax<lb/> and a corporate tax, both of which are by nature very sensitive to the economic cycle (Box 3). For<lb/> example, transaction tax revenues have declined by 40% between 2007 and 2009 (<ref type="figure">Figure 14</ref>). Moreover,<lb/> transfers from the central government also decline in economic downturns. This revenue volatility is<lb/> problematic because local governments are generally less well-equipped to cope with revenue swings than<lb/> central governments (<ref type="biblio">Norregaard, 1997</ref>). In the eventuality a balanced budget rule for local authorities was<lb/> introduced, reducing this volatility would be even more important as local governments would otherwise<lb/> be forced into a very pro-cyclical spending behaviour.<lb/></p>

			<head>Box 3. Municipalities have cyclical resources and little fiscal autonomy<lb/></head>

			<p>Municipalities draw roughly half of their resources from local taxes and fees and the other half from transfers from<lb/> the central government and from EU structural funds. The poorest municipalities tend to be more dependent on<lb/> transfers as they have lower tax revenues. Local taxes are mainly housing related, concerning both property (30% of<lb/> local tax revenues) and transactions (20% of local tax revenues). Municipalities set rates for the former, within a<lb/> centrally defined range, but not for the latter. Other tax resources include a local corporate income tax (derrama) and a<lb/> fraction of the vehicle tax. Municipalities&apos; relatively low fiscal autonomy was slightly increased in 2007, by allowing<lb/> them to claim up to 5% of their residents&apos; personal income tax, the principle being that unclaimed receipts remain with<lb/> taxpayers.<lb/></p>

			<figure>Figure 14. Local government tax revenue in Portugal<lb/> Million euros<lb/> 1.<lb/> Since 1995 this tax is collected by central government but then transferred to local government.<lb/> Source: OECD (2012), &quot; Revenue Statistics: Portugal &quot; , OECD Tax Statistics (database), May.<lb/></figure>

			<p>Several measures would help to reduce the cyclicality of local revenues. Firstly, housing taxation<lb/> should be shifted from transactions to recurrent taxation of immovable property, as recommended in the<lb/> 2010 Survey. Such a measure would make local revenues less volatile but also foster labour mobility, thus<lb/> stimulating potential growth. Secondly, transfers from central to local governments should be set in<lb/> advance on a multi-year basis. This would reduce their volatility and give municipalities more certainty<lb/> about their future resources, which would represent a fair counterpart to stricter monitoring being imposed<lb/> by the central government. Another benefit of this would be that it would limit the scope for higher<lb/> transfers to local governments in election years, as there is evidence that, despite the existing rules,<lb/> electoral motives currently lead to such a bias (<ref type="biblio">Veiga and Veiga, 2011</ref>). A third option would be to<lb/> increase local authorities&apos; fiscal autonomy, which is low by international standards, to enable them to cope<lb/> with revenue declines by increasing local taxes. This could also lead to more efficient public service by<lb/> increasing local government&apos;s accountability to taxpayers (<ref type="biblio">Blöchliger and Pinero-Campos, 2011; Joumard<lb/> and Kongsrud, 2003</ref>). However, this option should only be considered once local efforts to rationalise<lb/> spending have been completed as the prospect of additional tax resources may undermine these efforts.<lb/> Finally, a common practice is that municipalities levy &quot; compensations &quot; from businesses (e.g. wind turbine<lb/> farms, retailers) establishing in their jurisdiction. This possibility should be reduced to make municipalities<lb/> less dependent on this uncertain revenue source, which is also harmful for the business environment.<lb/></p>

			<head>There is large scope to make local spending more efficient<lb/></head>

			<p>Enhancing the efficiency of local spending will be crucial to achieving successful consolidation as<lb/> heavy spending cuts are needed to balance local budgets in a context of declining revenues. Empirical<lb/> work suggests that there is large scope for efficiency gains, as high as 40% on the sample of municipalities<lb/> constituted by the Lisbon region (<ref type="biblio">Afonso and Fernandes, 2003</ref>). Indeed, municipalities have had few<lb/> incentives for efficiency over the past decade as a result of dynamic revenue growth, cheap credit and a<lb/> weak fiscal framework, notably in terms of local public companies, which has allowed them to pile up<lb/> debts. Excessive fragmentation is also a source of inefficiencies, with certain parishes containing only a<lb/> few hundred people and inter-municipal cooperation still nascent. Rigidities in terms of labour contracts,<lb/> which are required to be similar to central government contracts, may also have limited municipalities&apos;<lb/> flexibility in terms of staffing. However, this feature will now probably help reduce local spending as the<lb/> central government is implementing large cuts in public wages. Finally, local governments have a tendency<lb/> to invest excessively in infrastructure, despite basic needs in this area being already largely satisfied<lb/> (<ref type="biblio">da Silva, 2008, Pina and Abreu, 2012</ref>), which suggests that in the eventuality a local balanced budget rule<lb/> is introduced, it should include capital expenditures.<lb/></p>

			<figure>0<lb/> 200<lb/> 400<lb/> 600<lb/> 800<lb/> 1000<lb/> 1200<lb/> 0<lb/> 200<lb/> 400<lb/> 600<lb/> 800<lb/> 1000<lb/> 1200<lb/> 1990 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 2000 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 10<lb/> Corporate income<lb/> Personal income<lb/> Property (IMI)<lb/> Housing transactions¹ (IMT)<lb/> Other<lb/></figure>

			<p>To improve spending efficiency, the authorities are committed to presenting new laws, before the end<lb/> of 2012, concerning both municipalities and autonomous regions. Measures will include an assessment and<lb/> a restructuring of local public companies, a 30% cut in the number of parishes (with a stronger focus on<lb/> urban areas) and a facilitation of inter-municipal cooperation (<ref type="biblio">Portuguese Government, 2011</ref>). These<lb/> welcome measures should be complemented by the generalisation of benchmarking and performance<lb/> indicators, which can be powerful tools to foster local spending efficiency (<ref type="biblio">Mizell, 2006; OECD, 2009d</ref>) as<lb/> illustrated e.g. by the success of the &quot; Kostra &quot; system in Norway (OECD, 2008b, Box 3.11). In this area,<lb/> first efforts could concentrate on the domains of water, wastewater and waste management, where<lb/> indicators would facilitate efforts to streamline the local public corporate sector, while also bringing<lb/> environmental benefits (OECD 2011b). In addition, a purchasing cooperative could be created to take<lb/> advantage of economies of scale when purchasing supplies.<lb/></p>

			<head>Making better use of EU structural funds would mitigate fiscal consolidation<lb/></head>

			<p>EU structural and cohesion funds are a significant resource for the Portuguese economy, amounting to<lb/> around 2% of GDP per year (Box 4). Spending them efficiently is now all the more important that they are<lb/> one of the few remaining sources of financing for the economy in the current context of deleveraging and<lb/> fiscal consolidation. The first challenge is to ensure that all available funds are spent despite the serious<lb/> financing constraints faced by national partners, which have notably led to the cancellation of large<lb/> infrastructure projects (new Lisbon airport, high-speed Lisbon-Madrid train). The second and most<lb/> important challenge is to put funds to their most productive use. This notably implies reinforcing<lb/> governance to prevent efforts to absorb funds from undermining careful project selection and to reduce<lb/> scope for political interference as there is empirical evidence of electoral motivations influencing funds&apos;<lb/> allocation to municipalities (Veiga, 2010).<lb/> In terms of the absorption of EU funds, Portugal is doing better than in the preceding cycle<lb/> (<ref type="biblio">Marzinetto, 2011</ref>) and than most other big recipients of funds (<ref type="figure">Figure 15</ref>). By the end of 2011, 80% of the<lb/> funds allocated for 2007-13 – which have to be spent no later than 2015 – had already been committed to<lb/> selected projects, 40% had been effectively spent and 30% had already been reimbursed by the European<lb/> Commission (<ref type="biblio">Portuguese Government, 2012</ref>). To stimulate absorption, the Portuguese authorities are<lb/> progressively shifting money from transport and environment infrastructure programmes, where many<lb/> projects have been cancelled, to other programmes, notably related to education. To this end, an<lb/> assessment of inactive projects was carried out in April 2012, aiming to free up to EUR 1.5 billion of funds<lb/> for reallocation. The absorption of funds will also be increased by the EU decision in December 2011 to<lb/> reduce local co-financing rates in crisis countries, which, for Portugal, could bring it from an average 30%<lb/> down to 15%. This lower co-financing will apply for 2010-13, but only retroactively, i.e. on projects<lb/> already selected, to avoid attracting lower quality projects.<lb/> In this context, available EU funds should be strategically shifted towards two of Portugal&apos;s most<lb/> pressing economic priorities: alleviating the credit squeeze on small and medium-sized enterprises (SME)<lb/> and avoiding high unemployment becoming structural. Regarding the former, additional resources should<lb/> be devolved to provide financing or guarantees to viable SMEs, which may require further approval by the<lb/> European Commission to reallocate funds across programmes. In addition, measures should be taken to<lb/> facilitate SMEs&apos; participation in EU funded projects, e.g. by clarifying tender processes, providing SMEs<lb/> with support to comply with (cumbersome) administrative procedures and giving SMEs more say about the<lb/> strategic allocation of funds. To tackle the unemployment problem better, funds should be further shifted<lb/> towards active labour market policies such as targeted training programmes for (especially young)<lb/> unemployed, a move also encouraged by the European authorities (<ref type="biblio">European Council, 2012</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<head>Box 4. EU structural and cohesion funds in Portugal<lb/></head>

			<p>Portugal is the biggest recipient of EU structural and cohesion funds among &quot; old &quot; EU member States, with an<lb/> allocation of 1.8% of GDP per year for 2007-13 (<ref type="figure">Figure 15</ref>). Funds allocated to Portugal are split roughly evenly<lb/> between three priorities: &quot; territorial enhancement &quot; (mainly infrastructure investment), &quot; competitiveness &quot; (support to<lb/> companies and innovation) and &quot; human potential &quot; (education and training, including school infrastructures). When<lb/> compared with past programmes and other countries, this implies more focus on education and less on infrastructure,<lb/> reflecting that Portuguese basic infrastructure needs are now broadly satisfied while the lack of education remains an<lb/> important bottleneck to growth.<lb/></p>

			<figure>Figure 15. Absorption of EU structural and cohesion funds by end 2011<lb/></figure>

			<p>The selection of projects financed by EU funds is carried out by national and regional authorities within a<lb/> framework of operational programmes reflecting the three national priorities. Each programme can receive financing<lb/> from one or several of the three EU funds: the European Regional Development Fund for activities such as<lb/> infrastructure investment and support to small and medium-sized enterprises, the European Social Fund mostly for<lb/> education, and the Cohesion Fund for transport and environment related activities. In Portugal, private projects are<lb/> chosen by selection committees after public calls for projects, while public projects are either directly integrated into<lb/> public policy programmes (e.g. school building programmes) or selected by national authorities in accordance with<lb/> publicly disclosed guidelines agreed upon with local stakeholders. Large infrastructure projects (exceeding<lb/> EUR 50 million) also require ex ante cost-benefit analyses and explicit approval by the European Commission.<lb/> Monitoring is mainly a national responsibility, with the European Commission only in charge of monitoring national<lb/> governance frameworks and dedicating relatively low means to combat fraud.*<lb/></p>

			<figure>* Financial Times (2010), &quot; Net That Fails to Catch EUR 700m Errors &quot; , In depth Report on EU Structural Funds, 30 November.<lb/></figure>

			<p>In addition, further efforts are needed to improve governance, especially in a context of lower<lb/> co-financing rates. At the macro level, a ministerial coordination committee, chaired by the Finance<lb/> Minister, has recently been created. It may help address the need for high-level arbitration in the strategic<lb/> allocation of funds both across sectors and across regions (<ref type="biblio">Barca et al., 2012</ref>). A strategic monitoring<lb/> process is also being introduced to assess the efficiency of policies and reorient funds if needed. This is<lb/> welcome as continuous evaluation and benchmarking are essential to make an efficient use of funds<lb/> (OECD, 2009d). Such evaluation should be generalised, carried out by an independent body and its results<lb/> should be published. At a more micro level, there is also scope to rationalise the allocation of funds by<lb/> generalising ex ante economic analyses and by delegating the selection of public projects to more<lb/> independent and more accountable agencies in order to reduce political interference. In addition, more<lb/> means should be dedicated to combat fraud as &quot; soft &quot; investment projects such as training programmes tend<lb/> to be more difficult to monitor than infrastructure projects. Finally, more dialogue should be encouraged at<lb/></p>

			<p>• The government should aim to meet headline deficit targets in the programme, notably through abiding by<lb/> the budgeted expenditure at all levels of general government.

			<head>•</head>

			<figure>Introduce an explicit and easily enforceable public expenditure rule consistent with revenue projections and<lb/> medium-term fiscal objectives and in line with the European fiscal framework.<lb/> • The Fiscal Council should prioritise core functions, including assessing the macroeconomic and fiscal<lb/> projections, compliance with fiscal rules and giving fiscal policy recommendations to the government. Fiscal<lb/> council board members should be allowed to have other paid employment.<lb/></figure>

			<p>• The Minister of Finance should be required to provide a formal response to fiscal council reports to embed<lb/> the fiscal council&apos;s role in the policy debate.<lb/></p>

			<head>State-owned enterprises and public-private partnerships<lb/></head>

			<p>• To improve transparency around state-owned enterprises (SOE), explicitly set and show in the<lb/> government&apos;s accounts the subsidy paid to urban transport companies in return for an agreed level of<lb/> services and at least operational balance.<lb/> • Continue to rationalise the rail network and services replacing less frequented lines with bus services to<lb/> improve SOE performance.<lb/> • Future public-private partnerships (PPP) should be budgeted for in the same way as other investment to<lb/> avoid PPPs being used as a way to push expenditure into the future.<lb/></p>

			<head>Local government and EU structural funds<lb/></head>

			<p>• As envisaged, support to local and regional governments should come only under strict and transparent<lb/> guidelines and be accompanied by improvements in the fiscal framework. Municipalities should notably be<lb/> required to keep their funds in a dedicated account at the Treasury.<lb/></p>

			<head>•</head>

			<figure>Local government revenues should be made less volatile by shifting from taxing housing transactions to<lb/> higher recurrent taxation of immovable property and by setting government transfers on a multi-year basis.<lb/></figure>

			<p>• Local spending efficiency should be encouraged by the generalisation of benchmarking and performance<lb/> indicators.<lb/></p>

			<p>• Absorption of EU structural funds should be further stimulated by shifting available funds towards credit to<lb/> SMEs and targeted training programmes, while governance should be reinforced to enhance efficiency.<lb/></p>

			<head>Annex A2<lb/> THE STABILITY AND GROWTH PROGRAMMES OF PORTUGAL AND ACTUAL FISCAL<lb/> DEVELOPMENTS<lb/></head>

			<p>To further understand the factors behind fiscal policy underperformance, Stability and Growth<lb/> Programmes (SGPs) from 2000 to 2010 are analysed using the approach in Beynet and Leibfritz (2009) 4 .<lb/> The difference between the forecasted and actual fiscal balance is divided into the gaps between actual and<lb/> forecasted revenue-to-GDP ratio expenditure-to-GDP ratios. The gap between the actual and forecasted<lb/> revenue ratio is influenced by changes in tax elasticity and by new fiscal measures, although the precise<lb/> break-down is not computed due to a lack of data. The difference between the actual and forecasted<lb/> expenditure ratio is further divided into the gap that arises due to the difference in the actual and projected<lb/> nominal GDP growth and the gap attributable to differences between actual and projected nominal<lb/> expenditure. The results are presented by grouping programmes at different forecasting horizons. The main<lb/> findings (table) are that:<lb/> • As the forecasting horizon extends, over-optimistic nominal GDP forecasts become an<lb/> increasingly important and dominant cause of larger than expected deficits.<lb/></p>

			<figure>• In the programme reference year (for example 2010 for the 2010 programme) greater than<lb/> expected nominal expenditure (expenditure slippage against budgeted nominal amounts) is the<lb/> main reason for larger than projected fiscal deficits. It also plays an important role at longer time<lb/> horizons.<lb/></figure>

			<p>• The revenue ratio tends to be higher than forecast, partly due to new measures, such as VAT rate<lb/> increases, taken in response to the worse than expected fiscal situation. A notable exception is<lb/> 2009, where a break-down in the usual tax elasticities help explain the particularly large<lb/> deterioration in the balance in that year (OECD, 2010) 5 .<lb/></p>
