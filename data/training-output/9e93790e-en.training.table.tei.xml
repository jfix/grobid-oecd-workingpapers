            <head>. Data from bilateral and multilateral<lb/> development partners reporting to the DAC shows that concessional and non-concessional ODF commitments for infrastructure<lb/> increased at a compounded annual growth rate of 7% 5 in the period 2005-2014. In addition, the share of infrastructure in total<lb/> sector-allocable ODF 6 by development partners also grew from 20% to 26% in the same period.<lb/> </head>
<lb/> 
            <table>When estimated flows of development partners that do not report to the DAC are also included, total official support to infrastructure<lb/> amounted to USD 60 billion (see Figure 4) in 2014. In terms of breakdown, 56% was concessional finance (i.e ODA) and 44%<lb/> was non-concessional (i.e. OOF) in 2014. This amount does not include the USD 1.7 billion of commercially motivated official<lb/> export credit direct loans provided by OECD Members in the same year 7 . Of the 60 billion provided by development partners,<lb/> 43% was disbursed by bilateral development partners and 57% by multilaterals 8 , particularly the Multilateral Development Banks<lb/> (MDBs), which together accounted for half of the total disbursements. If only flows reported to the DAC are considered, ODF for<lb/> infrastructure increased by 6% – or USD 2.7 billion – when compared to 2013.<lb/> Figure 4.
