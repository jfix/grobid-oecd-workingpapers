			<body>Some contracts will often contain elements of one or more of the above types of con-<lb/>tract. Thus, a contract to construct a building might include design services and certain <lb/>necessary supplies. Similarly, a supply contract may include siting and installation ser-<lb/>vices. The Directive contains specific rules that are used to classify these &apos;mixed con-<lb/>tracts&apos;. <lb/>A number of contracts are entirely excluded from the scope of the Directives (but not <lb/>necessarily of the Treaty), either because of their nature so it would be inappropriate to <lb/>apply the provisions of the Directives or because they are the subject of different sys-<lb/>tems of regulation or administration. Some contracts, the new &apos;reserved contracts&apos;, re-<lb/>ceive special treatment as a result of the identity of those supplying the goods, works <lb/>or services under them. <lb/>Even if not excluded, contracts will only be subject to the provisions of the Directives <lb/>where their value exceeds the relevant monetary value set out in the Directives – the <lb/>EU financial threshold. These thresholds reflect the level at which it was assumed by <lb/>the Community Legislator that cross-border trade was likely (although it is possible <lb/>that, depending on the circumstances, tenderers may be interested in below-threshold <lb/>contracts in other EU Member States – it is to be recalled that the general principles <lb/>apply to the award of these contracts in any event). In order to prevent creative meth-<lb/>ods of calculating the value of the contracts to be awarded, the Directives also apply <lb/>rules and methods of calculation as well as prohibition of methods designed to circum-<lb/>vent the Directives by splitting, aggregating or packaging contracts in such a way that <lb/>the contracts do not properly fall within the appropriate provisions. For more discussion <lb/>on this issue see Public Procurement Brief 5: Understanding the EU Financial Thresh-<lb/>olds. <lb/>One important distinction made by the Directives is between &apos;contracts&apos; and &apos;conces-<lb/>sions&apos;, the latter being treated differently from contracts. Special rules apply to the <lb/>award of works concessions in the Public Sector Directive, while services concessions <lb/>are excluded from the scope of both the Public Sector Directive and the Utilities Di-<lb/>rective. <lb/>Common characteristics: There are some general characteristics that are common to <lb/>all types of contract covered by the Directives: <lb/>The Directives apply to contracts for pecuniary interest concluded in writing between an <lb/>economic operator and a contracting entity, as follows: <lb/>• The contract must be for pecuniary interest, i.e. for money or money&apos;s <lb/>worth. There must be a financial consideration, no matter how it is paid. <lb/>• The contract must be in writing. In the very unlikely event that a contract which <lb/>falls within the Directives is not in writing, it will be subject to the general applica-<lb/>tion of the rules contained in the Treaty <lb/>• The contract must be between two parties: the economic operator and the <lb/>contracting authority. <lb/>When does a contract arise? <lb/>When a new contract is awarded, there is normally little difficulty in identifying it. Some-<lb/>times, however, this is not obvious. For example, an existing contract might be amend-<lb/></body>

			<page>3 <lb/></page>

			<body>ed or renewed. A contract may also be amended during its execution. All of these sit-<lb/>uations give rise to new obligations between the parties and may change the terms of <lb/>the original contract. <lb/>If the result of the changes is so extensive that the renewed or amended contract is <lb/>fundamentally different from the original contract, then it may be the case that a new <lb/>contract will be established. If there is a new contract and all of the elements of a con-<lb/>tract are present, then the contract should be subject to the procurement rules, i.e. it <lb/>must be awarded according to the provisions of the Directives. This means that a sim-<lb/>ple extension, renewal or even amendment might not be permitted if it is made without <lb/>competition. <lb/>What is a works contract? <lb/>Works contracts are defined as those contracts that: <lb/>• have as their object either the execution or both the execution and design of <lb/>works related to one of the activities referred to in Annex I of the Public Sector <lb/>Directive (Annex XII of the Utilities Directive); or<lb/>• have as their object the realisation, by whatever means, of work corresponding <lb/>to the requirements specified by the contracting entity.<lb/>The possibility of including design works in a works contract means that &apos;design and <lb/>build&apos; contracts may fall within the definition of a works contract. This could include, for <lb/>example, contracts covering the planning and financing of a project as well as its exe-<lb/>cution. Where design and construction are awarded separately, the design services <lb/>would be a priority service or could, alternatively, be awarded by means of a design <lb/>contest. <lb/>For the second part of the definition, a &apos;work&apos; is the outcome of building or civil engi-<lb/>neering works taken as a whole that is sufficient in itself to fulfil an economic and tech-<lb/>nical function. This definition is relevant for a number of reasons, notably in the context <lb/>of the realisation of works by any means and for the purposes of assessing the thresh-<lb/>old values and, consequently, when deciding whether a single requirement for works <lb/>has been split up with a view to bringing contracts below the relevant threshold value. <lb/>What is a supplies contract? <lb/>The definition of supplies is rather more straightforward than that of works or services. <lb/>&apos;Public supply contracts&apos; are defined as contracts – other than works – involving the <lb/>purchase, lease, rental or hire purchase, with or without option to buy, of products. In <lb/>addition, the delivery of such products may include siting and installation operations. <lb/>The range of products covered by the Directives can be seen in the various nomencla-<lb/>tures used to describe products for the purposes of advertising. See, for example, the <lb/>Common Procurement Vocabulary (CPV). <lb/>What is a services contract? <lb/>SIGM A | Public Procurement Brief 4 <lb/>4 <lb/>The term &apos;service contracts&apos; essentially refers to contracts other than works or sup-<lb/>ply contracts that have as their object the provision of services referred to in Annex II of <lb/>the Public Sector Directive (Annex XVII of the Utilities Directive). A number of services <lb/>are specifically excluded, mainly because they are not amenable to purchase through <lb/>the rules provided by the Directives. <lb/>Services contracts: The two-tier approach <lb/>The Directives make a distinction between priority and non-priority services. This distinc-<lb/>tion is not made on the basis of the nature of the particular activity but rather on the po-<lb/>tential that exists for the provision of the services concerned across national borders and <lb/>on the clear capability of those services to affect trade between member states. <lb/>This distinction becomes most readily apparent in the case of services, where those <lb/>listed in Annex IIB as non-priority, whilst capable of attracting localised competition, are <lb/>less amenable to international competition, either because of the nature of the services <lb/>(e.g. legal and administrative services that are based on familiarity with national laws <lb/>and jurisdiction) or because of the location in which they need to be provided (e.g. hotel <lb/>and restaurant services). <lb/>This does not mean that competition for such contracts is not possible, certainly at local <lb/>or national level, or even that international competition for them is inconceivable, but <lb/>only that the nature of the services or their value is such that this is less likely. <lb/>The sixteen priority services, which are listed in Annex IIA of the Public Sector Di-<lb/>rective, are subject to the detailed award procedures and other provisions of the Direc-<lb/>tives. <lb/>The non-priority services are subject only to a basic transparency regime that requires <lb/>adherence to the Directives&apos; rules on non-discriminatory technical specifications and <lb/>the obligation to publish the results of the award. <lb/>How is a contract classified when it includes a mix of different elements? <lb/>Contracts do need to be classified as works, services or supplies contracts because <lb/>different provisions of the Directive apply to different types of contract. Problems may <lb/>arise in deciding how a contract is to be correctly classified where a contract is a com-<lb/>bination of works and/or supplies and/or services. The Directives contain provisions on <lb/>how this is dealt with, for example: <lb/>Mixed priority and non-priority services contracts – value test: The Directives ap-<lb/>ply an explicit value test to services contracts that contain both priority and non-priority <lb/>services. Contracts will be for priority services where the value of the priority services <lb/>contained in the contract is greater than the value of the non-priority services. Con-<lb/>tracts will be for non-priority services where the value of the non-priority services con-<lb/>tained in the contract is greater than the value of the priority services. <lb/>Supplies/services – value test: Essentially, contracts containing elements of both <lb/>supplies and services will be treated as one or the other type of contract depending on <lb/>the value represented by each element. <lb/>The contract will be considered to be a services contract where the value of the services <lb/>performed is greater than the value of the products supplied. Where the value is equal, it <lb/>SIGM A | Public Procurement Brief 4 <lb/>5 <lb/>will be considered as a supplies contract. The definition makes no distinction between <lb/>priority and non-priority services, with the effect that, where the value of non-priority ser-<lb/>vices in a mixed contract is greater than the value of supplies, the whole contract will be <lb/>treated as a contract for non-priority services. <lb/>Works/services – principal object test: In the case of works and services, the Direc-<lb/>tives do not provide for a value test but include a test based on the principal object of <lb/>the contract. Insert example <lb/>Works/supplies: Under the Directives, supplies contracts that also cover, as an inci-<lb/>dental matter, siting and installation operations, are defined as supplies contracts. For <lb/>example, in the case of the purchase of a crane to be installed on a dockside, the object of <lb/>the contract is the supply of the crane and not the works required to site it, even if those <lb/>works are considerable. <lb/>This &apos;principal object&apos; test, which mirrors the way in which works and services contracts <lb/>are to be distinguished, would appear to apply even if the value of siting or installation <lb/>services is greater than the value of the supplies itself, since it is a test based on the ob-<lb/>ject of the contract and not the value-based test applied to distinguish between supplies <lb/>and services. <lb/>Are there other types of contracts subject to the Directives? <lb/>Yes, the Directives apply to a number of other types of contract for which special award <lb/>procedures apply. These include subsidised works or subsidised services contracts, <lb/>contracts for subsidised housing schemes and works concession contracts. <lb/>Frequently Asked Question 1: <lb/>What is a PPP contract? The acronym PPP refers to &quot; Public-Private Partner-<lb/>ship &quot; . There is no single or simple definition of a PPP contract as the term covers <lb/>a range of different types of contracts and other delivery models. A PPP generally <lb/>involves an arrangement under which the contracting authority (the public sector) <lb/>enters into an agreement with a private sector organisation to deliver infrastruc-<lb/>ture or public services. The structure may be contractual or institutional, the latter <lb/>involving the setting up of a joint venture company or other joint venture organisa-<lb/>tion in which both the contracting authority and the private sector party participate <lb/>to deliver the infrastructure or services. <lb/>A key feature of PPPs tends to be the sharing or transfer of risk to the private <lb/>sector party and PPPs are often, but not always of long duration. Payment and <lb/>funding methods vary under PPPs. Payments may be by the contracting authority <lb/>or derived from third parties, such as users of the facilities, or be from a combina-<lb/>tion of sources. Funding may come from the contracting authority, the private <lb/>sector party, external funders such as banks or a combination of sources. <lb/>Most PPP contracts will be subject to the full application of the Directives. See <lb/>FAQ 2 for comments on concession contracts. <lb/></body>

			<body>Frequently Asked Question 2: <lb/>What is a concession and is it covered by the Directives? A concession is a <lb/>contract of the same type as the contracts defined in the Directives except that <lb/>consideration for the works or services to be carried out, for example, consists <lb/>either solely in the right to exploit the work or service or in this right together with <lb/>payment. <lb/>A concessionaire often accepts the operational and financial risk of providing a <lb/>public service, in the broadest sense, in return for the chance of making a profit <lb/>through the exploitation of the &apos;service&apos;. Concessions may sometimes be classi-<lb/>fied as a form of PPP. <lb/>Concessions are used, for example, to carry out and finance major infrastructure <lb/>projects, notably in respect of the construction of a road network, bridges or tun-<lb/>nels, where the concessionaire is remunerated by way of tolls charged to users. <lb/>They are also used, however, simply to provide for the operation and mainte-<lb/>nance (rather than construction) of facilities by concessionaires, such as where <lb/>an operator is given the concession to operate an existing railway or under-<lb/>ground railway infrastructure. The former types of concession are examples of <lb/>works concessions; the latter is an example of a services concession. <lb/>Only public works concessions are dealt with comprehensively in the Public <lb/>Sector Directive. <lb/>The Public Sector Directive explicitly excludes coverage of services conces-<lb/>sions. The general principles of the Treaty continue to apply, however. <lb/>Exemptions <lb/>Even where contracts fall within the general definition of a public contract, some of <lb/>these contracts will be excluded from the scope of the Directives for a number of rea-<lb/>sons. Some are excluded because they are not, by their nature, amenable to competi-<lb/>tion. Some of the exclusions apply only to contracts of a specific type. Some are <lb/>excluded because governments wish to exclude them from competition for specific <lb/>reasons. There is also a category of &apos;reserved&apos; contracts that, although not excluded, <lb/>do benefit from preferential treatment. <lb/>In addition the Public Sector Directive provides an exemption for those public contracts <lb/>that are otherwise covered by the Utilities Directive or for public contracts that, although <lb/>covered by the Utilities Directive in principle, are exempt from the provisions of that Di-<lb/>rective. <lb/>Exemptions due to the nature of the contract <lb/>Contracts for the acquisition of land: The Directives exclude contracts for the ac-<lb/>quisition or rental, by whatever financial means, of land, existing buildings or other im-<lb/>movable property, or for the acquisition of rights thereon. These contracts are excluded <lb/>because they relate to immovable property, which is naturally dependent on the geo-<lb/>graphic location. Such contracts take place essentially in local markets and their ob-<lb/>jects generally rule out any real prospect for cross-border competition. <lb/></body>

			<body>It is important to note that development agreements and other types of property deals <lb/>may not necessarily fall within this exemption, most commonly because a works con-<lb/>tract is awarded a part of the overall arrangement. <lb/>Exclusions relating specifically to services: These exclusions apply to specific cir-<lb/>cumstances, either based on the award of exclusive rights to certain authorities to carry <lb/>out certain services or on the nature of a number of specified services. <lb/>• Services contracts provided on the basis of exclusive rights <lb/> • Broadcasting material and time <lb/> • Arbitration and conciliation services <lb/> • Certain financial services <lb/> • Employment contracts <lb/> • Some research and development contracts<lb/>Exemptions by reason of choice <lb/>These exemptions relate to procurement of a military nature, procurement requiring <lb/>secrecy, and procurement that, by agreement, is subject to different procurement rules. <lb/>All three types of exemption concern the Public Sector Directive. <lb/>Defence procurement: for certain contracts awarded in the field of defence and secu-<lb/>rity, and not covered by the Defence Directive 2009/81, where it is necessary to protect <lb/>essential interests of security <lb/>Contracts requiring secrecy measures: The Directives do not apply to public con-<lb/>tracts (i) that are declared secret, or (ii) the execution of which must be accompanied <lb/>by special security measures in accordance with the laws, regulations or administrative <lb/>provisions in force in the member state concerned, or (iii) when the protection of the <lb/>essential interests of that state&apos;s security so requires. <lb/>Contracts governed by other rules: The Directives does not apply to contracts that <lb/>are governed by different procedural rules and awarded: <lb/>• pursuant to an international agreement concluded in conformity with the EEC <lb/>Treaty between a member state and one or more third countries and covering <lb/>works, supplies or services intended for the joint implementation or exploitation of <lb/>a project by the signatory states;<lb/>• to undertakings in a member state or a third country in pursuance of an interna-<lb/>tional agreement relating to the stationing of troops;<lb/>• pursuant to the particular procedure of an international organisation such as the <lb/>United Nations, European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, or World <lb/>Bank.<lb/>Reserved contracts <lb/>The Directives introduced a new category of &apos;reserved&apos; contracts, which are not excluded <lb/>from the scope of the Directive but are subject to specific conditions of eligibility being <lb/>imposed on the participants. <lb/></body>

			<body>EU Member States may reserve the right to participate in public contract award proce-<lb/>dures concerning sheltered workshops or may provide for such contracts to be per-<lb/>formed in the context of sheltered employment programmes, where most of the <lb/>employees concerned are handicapped persons who, by reason of the nature or seri-<lb/>ousness of their disabilities, cannot carry on occupations under normal conditions. <lb/>Utilities <lb/>Exemptions specific to the utilities sector <lb/>The Utilities Directive provides for sector-specific exemptions in a number of util-<lb/>ity sectors, based essentially on the degree of competition in these markets. Ex-<lb/>amples of these exemptions include contracts for the purchase of fuel for the <lb/>production of energy; purchases of water; bus transport services; and upstream <lb/>oil and gas exploration and exploitation. The Utilities Directive has also intro-<lb/>duced a new general exemption mechanism for activities exposed to competi-<lb/>tion in markets to which access is not restricted. <lb/>The Utilities Directive also contains a series of other exemptions specific to the <lb/>utilities sector including: <lb/>• Activities outside the Community: The Directive does not apply to con-<lb/>tracts awarded by contracting entities for purposes other than the pursuit of <lb/>their relevant activities, or the pursuit of such activities in a third country, in <lb/>conditions that do not involve the physical use of a network or geographical <lb/>area within the Community.<lb/>• Affiliated undertakings exemption: Where &apos;undertakings&apos; are made up of <lb/>a number of mutually owned or mutually dependant companies, the Utilities <lb/>Directive provides for a specific exemption for purchases made between <lb/>these companies under certain conditions. These purchases are treated as <lb/>&apos;in-house&apos; contracts, known as intra-group transactions. The contracts ex-<lb/>cluded, subject to meeting certain conditions, are those that have been <lb/>awarded to affiliates, whose essential purpose is to act as central service-<lb/>providers to the group to which they belong, rather than selling their ser-<lb/>vices commercially on the open market.<lb/>• Purchases for re-sale or hire: The Directive excludes from its scope of <lb/>application any contracts that have been awarded for purposes of re-sale or <lb/>hire to third parties. This exclusion is intended to include contracts for <lb/>goods where the contracting entity intends to sell or hire the equipment <lb/>purchased in a competitive market. These contracts will only be excluded if <lb/>the contracting entity enjoys no special or exclusive right to sell or hire the <lb/>subject of such contracts and if other entities are free to sell or hire the <lb/>same goods under the same conditions as the contracting entity.<lb/>Further reading: <lb/>SIGMA Public Procurement Training Manual </body>
