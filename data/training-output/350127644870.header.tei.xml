	<div type="abstract">ABSTRACT<lb/> Reflecting the desire for cleaner air, many developing countries have enacted clean air laws similar to<lb/> those of developed nations, although to date most of these laws have been poorly enforced. A key starting<lb/> point to better enforcement is obtaining comprehensive and reliable air-quality monitoring data. This report<lb/> explores the impacts of air quality monitoring programmes implemented over the last decade in five<lb/> developing countries: Morocco, the Philippines, Malaysia, Indonesia, and India. These case studies also<lb/> examine the role of procurement of specialised equipment, usually imported, associated with the various<lb/> air quality monitoring programmes.<lb/></div>
