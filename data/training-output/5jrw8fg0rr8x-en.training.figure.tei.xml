            <figDesc>The market for organic food and drinks was worth USD 63 billion in 2011. It has<lb/> expanded by 170% since 2002 (FiBL/IFOAM, 2013). Demand for organic products comes<lb/> mainly from North America and Europe, together with more than 90% of retail sales. The<lb/> United States, Germany and France are the three countries with the largest organic consumer<lb/> markets. Higher per capita consumption is found in Switzerland (USD 250 per capita per<lb/> year), Denmark (USD 226) and Luxembourg (USD 187).<lb/> In terms of production, estimates of agricultural land under organic production worldwide<lb/> in 2011, including land in-conversion, vary between 29.9 million (FAOSTAT) and<lb/> 37.2 million hectares (FiBL/IFOAM, 2013) (Table 2). According to the OECD Compendium<lb/> of Agri-environmental Indicators (OECD, 2013b), the OECD area represents 24.7 million ha<lb/> of agricultural land area under certified organic management in 2010. The OECD area<lb/> accounts for the majority of organic production and organic food consumption.<lb/> According to the FiBL/IFOAM survey, in 2013, 86 countries implemented regulations on<lb/> organic agriculture and foodstuffs, and 26 are in the process of drafting legislation. The<lb/> survey carried out by the Secretariat confirms that all OECD member countries have<lb/> implemented some official programme as regard to organic agriculture, although the approach<lb/> towards regulation differs from one country to another (See Annex 3). This is also the case of<lb/> most emerging economies: Argentina, Brazil, the People&apos;s Republic of China, India and<lb/> Indonesia. The Russian Federation and South Africa are in the process of drafting<lb/> legislation (FiBL/IFOAM, 2013).</figDesc>

            <figDesc>GLOBALGAP is an initiative from the food industry, founded as EurepGAP in 1997 by<lb/> the Euro-Retailer Produce Working Group (EUREP). The association declares a substantial<lb/> number of certified producers worldwide: 123 115 in December 2012 (of which 75% in<lb/> Europe), up from around 35 000 in 2005 (FoodPLUS, 2012). Launched by the National<lb/> Farmers&apos; Union, Assured Food Standards (AFS) is the largest farm assurance standard in the<lb/> United Kingdom with about 78 000 certified farms; the &quot; Red Tractor &quot; certification covers<lb/> food safety, animal welfare and to a lesser extent environmental matters. More than 10 000<lb/> producers worldwide are certified under the Nurture scheme developed by UK retailer Tesco<lb/> (Cox, 2007). In France, there were 25 892 producers engaged in retailer Carrefour&apos;s Quality<lb/> Line certification by the end of 2011.</figDesc>

            <figDesc>The RSPO certification has seen tremendous growth in the past years, from 106 kha of<lb/> certified palm trees in 2008 to 1 570 kha in 2012, mainly in Indonesia and Malaysia. In 2012,<lb/> RTRS certification reached 320 kha of soybean from 144 kha in 2011 (Argentina, Brazil,<lb/> Paraguay and India). Bonsucro reported 686 kha of certified sugarcane worldwide in 2012<lb/> (IISD/IIED, 2014). Certified production represented about 40% of worldwide production in<lb/> coffee in 2012, 22% in cocoa, 15% in palm oil and 12% in tea. The proportion is much lower<lb/> in cotton, bananas and sugar (3%) and soybeans (2%) (IISD/IIED, 2014).</figDesc>

            <figDesc>, increasing liability costs for the certifier in case of fraud would provide another<lb/> way to guarantee the quality of third-party certification. Jahn et al. (2005) note that this can<lb/> happen by increasing the probability of fraud detection, increasing the probability of liability,<lb/> and increasing the costs or fines in case of liability.</figDesc>

            <figDesc>Standard harmonisation alleviates barriers to trade and facilitates market access for<lb/> producers. In the United States, in 1990, the US Congress passed the Organic Food Protection<lb/> Act to facilitate interstate commerce in organically produced food. The USDA National<lb/> Organic Program (NOP) standards published in 2002 had an explicit goal of removing<lb/> variation amongst different organic certifications and State laws on organic labelling<lb/> (Schewe, 2011). In the European Union, Council Regulation (EEC) 2092/91 has been<lb/> implemented to harmonise existing national standards and facilitate market integration. The<lb/> revision of the EU regulation in 2005-2007 aimed at strengthening the common framework,<lb/> after a proliferation of derogations and divergent Member States&apos; interpretation of rules<lb/> (</figDesc>

            <figDesc>Examples of agri-environmental policies in this category include payments for land<lb/> retirement or for the adoption of environmentally-friendly practices. These can be a flat rate<lb/> payment per hectare of eligible land (e.g. agri-environment programs in the European Union,<lb/> Norway and Switzerland) or delivered through auctions (e.g. Conservation Reserve Program<lb/> in the United States, BushTender programme in Australia). Environmental taxes or charges<lb/> include e.g. input taxes levied on pesticides in Denmark, France, Italy, Norway and Sweden,<lb/> and the taxes on fertiliser applied in Italy, Sweden and some states of the United States.<lb/> Market-based tools include permit trading for carbon emissions, water quality (United States),<lb/> nutrients (Australia, Canada) and surplus phosphates from manure (The Netherlands) (OECD,<lb/> 2010).<lb/> 12.<lb/> A form of government failure, where vested interests from the private sector dominate over the<lb/> initial (societal) objectives of the regulatory agency.</figDesc>

            <figDesc>In the case of the Korea Certified Organic, elements of the IFOAM standard have been<lb/> incorporated into national regulations in the mid-1990s. Since then, Korea&apos;s organic<lb/> regulations have been amended several times under the authority of the Ministry of<lb/> Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs, last time in 2014 in the context of the Act on<lb/> Environment-friendly Agriculture and Fisheries and Organic Food Management Support. The<lb/> content of regulations has therefore evolved independently from the IFOAM standard.<lb/> 13.<lb/> The IFOAM standards have also been influential in the development of other organic regulations<lb/> in other countries, as well as of private standards.</figDesc>

            <figDesc>The 2006 Agricultural Orientation Law established an income tax credit for organic<lb/> farmers. The support to organic agriculture was reinforced in 2007, with an ambitious<lb/> quantitative target of 6% of organically managed agricultural land by 2012 and 20% in 2020.<lb/> In support of these aims, a second Action Plan for organic agriculture was released in 2008<lb/> for the period going to 2012.</figDesc>

            <figDesc>July 2011 and January 2014, several voluntary schemes were recognised by the<lb/> European Commission, including the Biomass Biofuels Sustainability voluntary scheme<lb/> (2BSvs). The 2BSvs scheme was developed by a consortium of French producer associations<lb/> representing the bioethanol and biodiesel industries, from biomass to biofuels. Private<lb/> standards were developed to allow farmers, biomass collectors (e.g. feedstuff cooperatives<lb/> and traders) and other economic operators along the supply chain to demonstrate the<lb/> compliance of their product with the sustainability criteria of the RED and Fuel Quality<lb/> Directives. The scheme was approved by the European Commission on 19 July 2011. It<lb/> supports sustainability claims, with respect to the Directive, for biomass used as raw material<lb/> and biofuels processed from that biomass.</figDesc>

            <figDesc>Additional examples of synergies between public and private standards in monitoring<lb/> compliance are found in the case studies of Bio Suisse in Switzerland and the EKO Quality<lb/> Mark in the Netherlands. The two countries have implemented national organic rules in the<lb/> 1990s; the Netherlands in 1991 to fulfil Council Regulation (EEC) 2092/91, and Switzerland<lb/> in 1997 with the Federal Ordinance 910.18. In both countries, more stringent private organic<lb/> standards are coexisting with the public standard embedded in regulation.</figDesc>
