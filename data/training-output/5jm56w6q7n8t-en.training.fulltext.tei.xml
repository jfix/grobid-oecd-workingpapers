			<table>Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) are currently<lb/> negotiating a new agreement, under the auspices of the Ad hoc Working Group on the Durban<lb/> Platform for Enhanced Action (ADP). This new agreement is to be adopted at the 21st Conference of<lb/> the Parties (COP 21) in December 2015, and to take effect from 2020. At</table>

			<p>the centre of the new<lb/> agreement are nationally determined contributions (NDCs). These are the national objectives and<lb/> actions that countries are willing to put forward to the international community, and be bound by in<lb/> some way. To date, all proposed intended NDCs (INDCs) include a mitigation component, most an<lb/> adaptation component as well, while only some quantify the financial support required for<lb/> implementation. The mitigation component of INDCs generally cover five to ten year periods. For the<lb/> post-2020 period, the current ADP draft agreement text distinguishes between nationally determined<lb/> mitigation contributions or commitments (NDMCs), and other types of undertakings, actions and<lb/> communications in non-mitigation areas, such as adaptation, or the provision and mobilisation of<lb/> climate finance.<lb/></p>

			<p>Within the climate negotiations, Parties are discussing mechanisms that would allow NDMCs to be<lb/> updated and communicated regularly. Such regular communications may be accompanied and<lb/> bolstered by one or more multilateral processes, some of which may play the role of assessing<lb/> whether NDMCs are collectively or individually consistent with collectively-agreed climate<lb/> objectives. The process of submitting a national contribution or commitment, and its potential passage<lb/> through these international processes, is referred to as a &quot; cycle &quot; . The aim of having a cycle is to<lb/> encourage greater ambition from NDCs over time, and to enable an agreement that remains dynamic<lb/> in the longer term. Dynamism is understood as a process that allows mitigation contributions or<lb/> commitments under the new agreement to respond and adapt to changing needs, circumstances,<lb/> technology changes, and knowledge.<lb/> This paper focuses on nationally determined mitigation contributions or commitments. The &quot; cycle &quot;<lb/> primarily refers to the phases of NDMCs, e.g. how they are communicated internationally, and what<lb/> multilateral assessment processes they may be subject to. Discussions during the course of the ADP<lb/> negotiations in 2015 have sought to balance the national flexibility inherent in NDMCs with<lb/> international responsibility and environmental integrity, by setting out a process for how and how<lb/> often NDMCs are put forward, and proposing potential multilateral review or stocktake exercises.<lb/> Ways of encouraging the dynamism and ambition of NDMCs can be grouped in three broad<lb/> categories that are currently included in different articles of the draft agreement text:<lb/> • The international procedures applied to the mitigation contributions or commitments<lb/> themselves, such as when they are formulated and communicated, whether they can be<lb/> adjusted, and any conditions or requirements they should meet (Article 3).<lb/> • Multilateral processes that would examine NDMCs collectively, such as an aggregation<lb/> exercise (Article 3) and the global stocktake (Article 10).<lb/> • Multilateral processes that would examine individual NDMCs, such as a clarification<lb/> exercise (Article 3), various exercises as part of the transparency or measurement, reporting<lb/> and verification (MRV) system (Article 9), and potential review processes included in any<lb/> facilitative compliance and implementation system (Article 11).<lb/> Provisions for the dynamism and ambition of NDMCs are currently contained mostly in two<lb/> provisions: first, a requirement that NDMCs become more ambitious over time, and represent a<lb/> Party&apos;s highest level of ambition; second, the option that NDMCs are communicated at regular<lb/> intervals, with every five years proposed in the text. There are implementation challenges associated<lb/> with both elements, including how the notion of ambition and progression can concretely be defined<lb/> or determined. Overall, these provisions could encourage countries to increase their mitigation efforts,<lb/> and provide a formal opportunity for countries to revise and update their contributions and<lb/> commitments at regular intervals. Already, several Parties have indicated that they may unilaterally<lb/> revise their INDCs.<lb/> One of the multilateral processes proposed at the collective level, the aggregation exercise, does not<lb/> appear aimed at influencing the individual NDMCs. The terminology used is similar to that of the<lb/> current synthesis report on INDCs, which despite significant information gaps, presents the aggregate<lb/> effect of INDCs on future emissions trajectories. The global stocktake is described as a process to<lb/> examine how Parties are implementing the agreement and meeting its objectives. There are proposals<lb/> in the draft text that accounting for the outcomes of the global stocktake should be a feature of<lb/> NDMCs. Meant to cover all aspects of the agreement, including mitigation, the specifics of how the<lb/> global stocktake will consider all elements is unclear. An assessment of collective progress towards<lb/> mitigation objectives should help guide action at a national level, though may not provide specific<lb/> insight into how an individual country might adjust its objectives and maximise mitigation<lb/> opportunities. Currently, the existing 2013-2-15 Review process – designed to assess both the<lb/> adequacy of the long-term global temperature goal and progress towards achieving it – may provide a<lb/> basis for parts of a global stocktake exercise.<lb/></p>

			<p>In terms of multilateral processes for individual NDMCs, the draft agreement text proposes that these<lb/> undergo a clarification exercise once they are communicated, but beyond this individual review<lb/> processes are mentioned mostly within text on a transparency framework. Current review and<lb/> consultation processes under the UNFCCC provide a basis for tracking progress with the<lb/> implementation of NDMCs, notably through biennial reporting, technical review of reports, and peer-<lb/>to-peer consultations. Such processes will likely evolve going forward, and could assess the<lb/> implementation of individual NDMCs, as well as feed into their potential adjustment or revision.<lb/> Assessment and review processes can be thought of as opportunities for feedback and reflection,<lb/> aligned with moments within a cycle when countries have the opportunity to adjust or update their<lb/> NDMCs. They may play an important role within a potential facilitative compliance and<lb/> implementation system, though how specifically this would operate remains to be decided.<lb/></p>

			<p>Figure ES-1 presents a possible simplified process for communicating NDMCs, and the multilateral<lb/> processes that could support both communication and implementation of these NDMCs. Boxes in<lb/> dashed outlines represent possible options, as these are currently proposals among others within the<lb/> text. The dotted lines represent potential lines of influence. Where the text proposes a time interval<lb/> between communication and finalisation of a NDMC, this would likely not be long enough to allow a<lb/> country to adjust its NDMC. Any multilateral processes taking place in this time interval are therefore<lb/> not presented as potentially influencing individual NDMCs.<lb/></p>

			<head>1. Introduction<lb/></head>

			<table>Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) are currently<lb/> negotiating a new agreement under the Convention, to be adopted at the 21st Conference of the<lb/> Parties (COP 21) in December 2015, and to take effect from 2020. This negotiation is taking place<lb/> under the auspices of the Ad hoc Working Group on the Durban Platform for Enhanced Action<lb/> (ADP). The new agreement aims to provide a framework for enhancing and accelerating<lb/> implementation</table>

			<p>of UNFCCC, in all relevant areas, namely adaptation, mitigation, finance, technology,<lb/> capacity building and transparency. An important element of this new framework is that its provisions<lb/> will apply to all Parties (unlike the Kyoto Protocol for example); it therefore needs to allow for<lb/> diversity. This has led to a &quot; bottom-up &quot; approach, whereby countries determine the actions they are<lb/> willing to be bound by. If the agreement is to be durable over time, it will also need to be flexible and<lb/> dynamic, and be able to evolve. It is in this context that current negotiations have discussed various<lb/> ways of ensuring that climate goals undertaken by Parties are dynamic and progressively more<lb/> ambitious over time.<lb/> At the centre of the new agreement are nationally determined contributions (NDCs). These are the<lb/> objectives and actions relating to mitigation or other aspects of climate change responses that<lb/> countries are willing to put forward internationally and be bound by in some way, as part of the 2105<lb/> agreement (pending decisions on legal form). In the course of 2015, countries have been submitting<lb/> intended nationally determined contributions (INDCs), ahead of a decision on how they will be<lb/> formalised and anchored in the new agreement. The mitigation component of current INDCs cover<lb/> either a five-or ten-year time period starting from 2020, setting a greenhouse gas (GHG) target to be<lb/> achieved in either 2030 or 2025, with most selecting a 2025 target.<lb/></p>

			<p>This paper focuses on nationally determined mitigation contributions or commitments (NDMCs) 1 for<lb/> several reasons. First, because the notion of &quot; progress &quot; and &quot; greater ambition &quot; are easily understood<lb/> in these terms. This is in part because there is experience with expressing a collective, long-term<lb/> objective for mitigation that progress can be assessed against. It is also easier to understand the<lb/> general direction of travel implied by &quot; greater ambition &quot; in a mitigation context, i.e. fewer GHG<lb/> emissions. Second, mitigation is an area in which collective action problems are most pressing.<lb/></p>

			<p>Dynamism in this paper is understood as a process that allows contributions or commitments under<lb/> the new agreement to respond and adapt to changing needs, circumstances, technologies and<lb/> knowledge. Dynamism includes the notion of flexibility, acknowledging that countries are starting<lb/> from different places and need the flexibility to appropriately enhance and adjust their contributions.<lb/></p>

			<p>This paper seeks to clarify and discuss ideas contained in the draft agreement and draft decision text<lb/> for the 2015 agreement that may serve to enhance the dynamism and ambition of NDMCs. This paper<lb/> does not deal with differentiation, a broader political issue that will shape all aspects of the 2015<lb/> agreement. Further, it does not address areas directly related to the legal nature of contributions and<lb/> other &quot; undertakings &quot; within the 2015 agreement, such as compliance and enforcement, nor does it<lb/> focus on adaptation or support.<lb/></p>

			<p>Section 2 of the paper provides some background and context to how and why dynamism and<lb/> ambition have emerged as important elements within negotiations toward the 2015 agreement. Section<lb/> 3 examines the procedures applied to mitigation contributions or commitments, and how these can<lb/> impact dynamism and ambition. Section 4 looks at how various multilateral assessment and review<lb/> processes may also enhance the ambition of mitigation contributions or commitments. The paper aims<lb/> to explore the various concepts proposed, and indicate key questions and options to guide decision<lb/> 9<lb/> making. Section 5 concludes with some initial thoughts on areas that will require decisions from<lb/> Parties at COP 21 and shortly thereafter.<lb/></p>

			<head>2. Dynamism and ambition in the current negotiations<lb/></head>

			<p>The need of diversity and flexibility is integrated into NDCs, as these are &quot; nationally determined &quot; and<lb/> therefore vary according to the capacities and circumstances of each individual Party. The notion<lb/> commonly referred to as &quot; cycles &quot; in the negotiations has centred on NDCs, referring to procedures<lb/> and processes that would allow NDCs to evolve, and encourage them to become more ambitious,<lb/> thereby allowing countries to meet collectively-agreed climate objectives.<lb/></p>

			<p>The scope of NDCs themselves will influence these cycles. Current INDCs cover mitigation, and<lb/> several also cover adaptation and other aspects. For example, some countries specify the amount of<lb/> financing, including external support, needed to implement their INDCs (e.g. Benin, Kenya, Trinidad<lb/> and Tobago). No submission to date includes the amount of support (financial, technology and<lb/> capacity building) that a country might provide over the INDC&apos;s time period, which some Parties had<lb/> suggested should be included in the NDCs of developed countries (FCCC/ADP/2015/1).<lb/> Following the adoption of the 2015 agreement, more specific terminology may emerge that<lb/> distinguishes mitigation contributions or commitments and other types of contributions, commitments<lb/> or actions, such as on adaptation or support. The current draft agreement text suggests that &quot; nationally<lb/> determined &quot; mitigation contributions or commitments (NDMC), or the mitigation component of<lb/> nationally determined contributions, would be distinct from adaptation &quot; communications &quot; or<lb/> &quot; undertakings &quot; that could include adaptation plans, priorities and needs (ADP, 2015a). Processes for<lb/> determining how commitments, contributions and communications are updated, and at what<lb/> frequency, will likely also differ for mitigation and adaptation.<lb/> Some countries have explicitly reserved the right to adjust their INDCs prior to 2020 (e.g. Morocco,<lb/> New Zealand). There are many reasons countries might wish to do so. For developed countries, most<lb/> conditionality in current INDCs is related to the finalisation of rules governing the initial round of<lb/> NDCs (on accounting, for example), which should be addressed by the second round of NDCs.<lb/> Several developing countries have also presented INDCs that are wholly or partly conditional on the<lb/> provision of support. In addition, some countries may adjust their INDCs pending political decisions<lb/> (e.g. Swaziland, Lao PDR) or when more information becomes available (e.g. Philippines). Countries<lb/> with mitigation targets set against business-as-usual emissions may also wish to update these<lb/> scenarios and assumptions. Even where the mitigation component of an INDC is presented as a<lb/> package of policies and measures, the short timeframe in which many countries have had to develop<lb/> their INDC means ensuring its coherence and implementability may also be a challenge. As such,<lb/> many may benefit from being able to clarify, update, augment or otherwise hone their INDC ahead of<lb/> its expected implementation date.<lb/></p>

			<p>Discussions during ADP negotiations in 2015 have sought to balance the &quot; bottom up &quot; national<lb/> flexibility inherent in NDCs with international credibility, responsibility and environmental integrity,<lb/> through more &quot; top down &quot; procedures for how and how often NDMCs are put forward, along with<lb/> multilateral review or stocktake processes. A range of ideas on different processes were put forward<lb/> in February 2015, some of which are now reflected in the draft agreement text. The means put in<lb/> place to encourage the dynamism and ambition of NDMCs can be grouped in three broad categories<lb/> that are currently included in different articles of the draft agreement text:<lb/> 10<lb/> • The international procedures applied to the mitigation contributions or commitments<lb/> themselves, such as when they are formulated and communicated, whether they can be<lb/> adjusted, and any conditions or requirements they should meet (Article 3).<lb/> • Multilateral processes that would examine NDMCs collectively, such as an aggregation<lb/> exercise (Article 3) and the global stocktake (Article 10).<lb/> • Multilateral processes that would examine individual NDMCs, such as a clarification<lb/> exercise (Article 3), various exercises as part of the transparency or measurement, reporting<lb/> and verification (MRV) system (Article 9), and potential review processes included in any<lb/> facilitative compliance and implementation system (Article 11).<lb/> Maximising the potential of NDMCs to increase in ambition over time is important for several<lb/> reasons. First, because based on the mitigation component of current INDCs, the first set of NDMCs<lb/> will likely be insufficiently ambitious from a mitigation perspective (Hood, Adkins and Levina,<lb/> 2015). The new climate agreement would therefore aim to set a basis for action that would become<lb/> more ambitious over time. Second, countries will be starting from very different points; as such, it is<lb/> important that countries are able to revise and adjust actions in line with changing circumstances,<lb/> priorities, technologies, capacities and needs. Some countries have already revised some aspects of<lb/> their INDCs (e.g. Benin), and the current draft agreement includes the option for countries to adjust<lb/> their NDMCs at any time so long as ambition is increased. Flexibility is enhanced if countries can<lb/> update or revise their contributions regularly, e.g. every five years, and potentially have the<lb/> opportunity to adjust them at other times as well. Implementing ambitious climate policy is a<lb/> continuous learning process. Economic circumstances change and are dynamic, and so effective<lb/> policy responses will also be dynamic. International review and stocktake processes can act as<lb/> feedback points to support the revision and updating of national policies, to account for successes,<lb/> new challenges, and evolving priorities, as well as identify areas for improvement.<lb/></p>

			<p>Third, at a collective level, it is useful for countries to know whether nationally determined mitigation<lb/> contributions or commitments are broadly consistent with what is needed to meet longer-term<lb/> collective climate objectives. Dynamic NDMCs would ideally fit within longer-term indicative<lb/> pathways, such as low-emission development strategies, and allow for shorter term actions that would<lb/> lead to the longer-term, transformational changes required (Hood, <ref type="biblio">Briner and Rocha, 2014; Spencer et<lb/> al., 2014</ref>). NDMCs and longer-term pathways should generally be consistent with any global, long-<lb/>term climate objective expressed within the 2015 agreement. For mitigation this could be the<lb/> previously stated objective of limiting average global surface temperature warming to 2°C above pre-<lb/>industrial levels by the end of the century, or a different formulation of this objective (e.g. net zero<lb/> emissions over the course of the century).<lb/></p>

			<head>3. Procedures applied to mitigation contributions or commitments<lb/></head>

			<p>While the current draft negotiating text remains under debate (ADP, 2015a), options for the<lb/> framework and procedures applying to nationally determined mitigation contributions or<lb/> commitments include ideas that impact their responsiveness and their evolution.<lb/></p>

			<p>The substance of NDMCs themselves may be framed in such a way as to encourage ambition over<lb/> time. For example, the draft text contains language that would require or expect each NDMC to<lb/> reflect a given country&apos;s highest possible ambition, reflect a progression beyond the Party&apos;s previous<lb/> efforts, or be progressively more ambitious over time. Contributions or commitments would therefore<lb/> need to become more ambitious as part of how they are formulated. Other framing elements also<lb/> present both opportunities for enhancing action, as well as challenges in terms of their implications<lb/> for implementation and their feasibility (</p>

			<table>Table 1).<lb/> Table 1. Options for NDMC framing elements along with opportunities and challenges<lb/> Options<lb/> Opportunities<lb/> Challenges<lb/> Common<lb/> timeframe for<lb/> NDMCs?<lb/> (Option in text<lb/> for common<lb/> timeframe from<lb/> 2030)<lb/> Make communicating along regular timeframe<lb/> simpler; momentum created if all Parties<lb/> formulating and implementing NDMCs at<lb/> similar moments.<lb/> Could be difficult to agree upon, may<lb/> infringe on &quot; nationally determined &quot; aspect of<lb/> NDMCs. May not be essential if regular<lb/> intervals for communication, independent of<lb/> NDMC length, given current INDCs span 5<lb/> or 10 years.<lb/> NDMCs linked<lb/> to long-term<lb/> collective<lb/> goal?<lb/></table>

			<p>Can help ensure coherence of NDMCs and<lb/> long-term objectives. Even if not directly<lb/> linked, countries could be encouraged to link<lb/> NDMCs to their own relevant long-term goals<lb/> (low emissions, sustainable development,<lb/> poverty reduction, etc.), or indicate how<lb/> domestic long-term goals are consistent with<lb/> collective ones. Could be a feature of NDMCs,<lb/> or included in the information provided with<lb/> their communication (e.g. reporting on how the<lb/> NDMC links to long-term goals).<lb/> Quantitatively establishing such a link can be<lb/> challenging, and is less relevant for small<lb/> emitters.<lb/> NDMCs to<lb/> have specific<lb/> features?<lb/> List of various features in the text, some of<lb/> which may facilitate monitoring of NDMC<lb/> (e.g. should be quantifiable, have real and<lb/> verifiable data for baselines), or encourage<lb/> linking these to multilateral processes (e.g.<lb/> take into account global stocktake, process to<lb/> facilitate implementation).<lb/> Given the diversity of NDMCs and national<lb/> circumstances, could be difficult to agree on<lb/> a list of features. May also imply that<lb/> reporting and review processes will also<lb/> consider whether NDMCs do actually<lb/> contain these features, which could be<lb/> complex (e.g. assessing whether the NDMC<lb/> maximises adaptation co-benefits).<lb/> Requirements<lb/> for progression<lb/> and ambition<lb/> in successive<lb/> NDMCs?<lb/></p>

			<p>Important for steady increases in ambition over<lb/> time; allows for different starting points and<lb/> diversity of action.<lb/> How specifically the notion is expressed, and<lb/> how broad or narrow the meaning of &quot; more<lb/> ambitious &quot; or &quot; highest possible ambition &quot; is,<lb/> can have a significant impact (e.g. An<lb/> increase in headline numbers? Expanding<lb/> coverage of activities? Addressing gaps in<lb/> previous implementation?). May have<lb/> implications for transparency system, if<lb/> answering such questions included in<lb/> consultation or review processes. Parties may<lb/> need reassurance that there can exceptions to<lb/> the rule, in cases of force majeure.<lb/> Adjustments at<lb/> any time?<lb/></p>

			<p>Can be important to allow countries to refine<lb/> and update NDMCs in light of changed<lb/> circumstances, shifting priorities, previous<lb/> implementation, etc. Option currently included<lb/> in the text allows for updates to NDMCs so<lb/> long as they meet the requirement of<lb/> progression in ambition.<lb/></p>

			<p>An adjustment or update process may need<lb/> accompanying transparency provisions.<lb/> While potentially sensitive, the agreement<lb/> may also benefit from allowing countries to<lb/> decrease the ambition of their NDMCs in<lb/> certain circumstances, to allow for a more<lb/> flexible and durable regime (Briner, <ref type="biblio">Kato and<lb/> Hattori, 2014</ref>). Special provisions are likely<lb/> needed in these cases.<lb/></p>

			<p>The primary means by which dynamism is introduced is the notion that contributions or commitments<lb/> are communicated along regular intervals, every five years. These intervals could be independent of<lb/> the length of each contribution or commitment, with either a successive NDMC communicated if its<lb/> period length is five years, or an updated NDMC communicated if it spans ten years. The text<lb/> includes the option of communication occurring either before the end of the period of implementation<lb/></p>

			<figure>(e.g. before 2030 for the period 2021-2030), or after the completion of the current implementation<lb/> cycle (e.g. after 2030 for the same period). These options appears distinct from that of regularly<lb/> communicating NDMCs every five years; as such, if the time periods covered by contributions or<lb/> commitments vary (either five or ten years), this would mean countries would communicate their<lb/></figure>

			<p>NDMCs at different moments in time. Different options for the communication of NDMCs, along<lb/> with the advantages and challenges they present, are outlined in <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>.<lb/></p>

Parties may<lb/> communicate at differing intervals,<lb/> reducing collective momentum.<lb/> Communication to<lb/> occur after end of<lb/> NDMC period<lb/> Potentially simpler for Party, as above. In<lb/> addition, may have more information on<lb/> implementation and outcomes of previous<lb/> NDMC period.<lb/> implementation of mitigation contributions or commitments remains important, including for guiding<lb/> domestic policy and economic activity (see e.g. OECD, 2015). Various analysts had suggested a<lb/> similar procedure for NDCs under the 2015 agreement, with countries determining their contributions<lb/> or commitments several years before their official implementation date. Spencer, Zhang et al. (2015)<lb/> suggested Parties propose new contributions for the 2030-35 period in 2019-20, and Morgan, Dagnet<lb/> and Tirpak (2014) similarly suggested that Parties communicate contributions for the 2025-30 period<lb/> in 2018-19</table>

			<p>, and then formalise or anchor these by 2020. The text does retain the option for Parties to<lb/> provide an indicative or intended NDMC for the period after the submitted contribution or<lb/> commitment, e.g. for the 2035-40 period if a NDMC for 2030-35 has been communicated.<lb/> Providing a longer-term trajectory within which to place NDMCs, particularly if these span five years,<lb/> can facilitate both domestic planning and a collective assessment of emissions trajectories. However,<lb/> there can also be challenges associated with proposing targets ten or fifteen years ahead of time for<lb/> many countries, especially when economic growth trajectories are rapid and uncertain. Successive<lb/> NDMCs are likely to be communicated before the end of the current NDMC&apos;s implementation period.<lb/> A country would therefore need to propose a contribution or commitment for a future period before<lb/> knowing the final results of how its current NDMC had been implemented, due to delays in the<lb/> production of official GHG emissions statistics. Allowing countries to adjust proposed contributions<lb/> prior to and during their implementation period may therefore be necessary. The current text includes<lb/> an option for Parties to be able to update their NDMC at any time, if it &quot; represents a progression in<lb/> ambition beyond its previous efforts &quot; . For INDCs, various proposals within the accompanying draft<lb/> decision text propose or encourage updates or adjustments to INDCs prior to when the agreement<lb/> takes effect.<lb/> How much time elapses between communication, finalisation and the contribution or commitment<lb/> start date – and the prevalence of opportunities for deliberation, assessment and feedback – might<lb/> impact the dynamism of contributions or commitments. Once a contribution is agreed upon<lb/> domestically, it may be difficult to modify it in the short term. If countries are to finalise their<lb/> NDMCs 12-18 months after initial communication, it is unlikely that any significant revisions to the<lb/> contribution or commitment itself could be made. The focus would therefore be on successive<lb/> contributions or commitments, and ensuring these are as ambitious as possible when communicated.<lb/> However, assessment and feedback opportunities could also play a role in strengthening<lb/> implementation of the NDMC, which is another means of enhancing ambition, for example, by<lb/> facilitating over-achievement of NDMC objectives. Several assessment and review processes<lb/> mentioned in the draft negotiating text could play this role.<lb/></p>

			<head>4. Multilateral review and assessment processes related to NDMCs<lb/> 4.1<lb/> Existing multilateral processes under the UNFCCC and elsewhere<lb/></head>

			<p>Multilateral review and/or assessment processes could enable dynamism and encourage greater<lb/> ambition of mitigation contributions or commitments, by providing opportunities for feedback and<lb/> reflection that can assist with domestic policy processes. These processes can take various forms, and<lb/> certain terms and ideas are distinguished in Box 1 for the purposes of this paper.<lb/></p>

			<p>Various multilateral review processes exist in other international regimes; some examples are<lb/> provided in Box 2. These focus on implementation of previously agreed commitments and do not seek<lb/> to influence their content, since the commitments themselves are negotiated rather than proposed by<lb/> each individual country. Most of these are neither constraining nor punitive. Where separate<lb/> compliance processes are in place, they can play a facilitative role, flagging issues that are likely to<lb/> develop into compliance problems. For example, issues identified under WTO Trade Policy Reviews<lb/> can be an indicator of issues brought up under the Dispute Settlement Process (<ref type="biblio">Chaisse and<lb/> Chakraborty, 2007</ref>). An important question to consider is also that of resources: thorough assessment<lb/> and review processes are expensive, time-consuming and require expertise (<ref type="biblio">Ellis et al., 2011; Halle,<lb/> Najam and Wolfe, 2014</ref>). Approximately half of the IMF&apos;s operating budget, for example, is devoted<lb/> to surveillance activities (Pew Center, 2010).<lb/></p>

			<head>4.2<lb/> Proposals contained within the draft agreement text<lb/></head>

			<p>The draft agreement text (ADP, 2015a) proposes that NDMCs may be subject to various multilateral<lb/> processes. Some of these might examine NDMCs at a collective level (aggregation exercise and<lb/> global stocktake), and others at the individual level (clarification exercise; transparency system;<lb/> facilitative compliance and implementation system). Previously, the Geneva negotiating text<lb/> contained proposals for multilateral review or assessment processes that would explicitly aim to<lb/> influence or encourage greater ambition in NDMCs themselves, and some analysts suggested that<lb/> contributions or commitments be reviewed ex ante for this purpose, prior to their inscription and<lb/> implementation (Morgan, <ref type="biblio">Dagnet and Tirpak, 2014</ref>). No such language is included in the current draft<lb/> agreement text.<lb/></p>

			<head>Box 2: Multilateral review processes in other international regimes<lb/></head>

			<p>Many other major multilateral processes that examine countries&apos; performances with meeting commitments and<lb/> obligations use &quot; reviews &quot; to do so (<ref type="biblio">Pew Center, 2010; Bell et al., 2012</ref>). This includes:<lb/></p>

			<table>• The IMF Bilateral Surveillance (in which the Secretariat&apos;s report includes recommendations)<lb/> • The UN Human Rights Council Universal Periodic Review (under which countries are to implement<lb/> recommendations)<lb/> • The Montreal Protocol Implementation Review (where the Implementation Committee can issue<lb/> recommendations)<lb/> • The WTO Trade Policy Review Mechanism (TPRM)<lb/></table>

			<p>The TPRM does not result in specific recommendations, but aims to provide a factual evaluation of progress with<lb/> national implementation of trade and investment policies, as well as their effectiveness and potential impact on the<lb/> multilateral trading system. It includes a consultation process in which countries can ask questions of the country<lb/> under review, which can be quite intense for major trading countries. The country must, within a specified<lb/> deadline, answer all questions put forward in writing (bearing in mind that major trading countries can receive<lb/> over a thousand questions), and a summary statement is prepared outlining the implicit assessment by the<lb/> country&apos;s trading partners, highlighting progress, areas of improvement, concerns and questions.<lb/> All of the above processes apply to all countries without distinction; flexibility is provided through less frequent<lb/> reviews in the case of the IMF bilateral surveillance and WTO TPRM (where frequency is based on share of world<lb/> trade). Under the Montreal Protocol, developing countries benefit from more flexible phase-out schedule for<lb/> controlled substances, but implementation remains subject to annual review. The Montreal Protocol review<lb/> process is both collective and individual. Individual country reports are reviewed and specific issues can be<lb/> referred to the Implementation Committee. At the same time, the Meeting of the Parties discusses collective, rather<lb/> than country specific, implementation of the Protocol.<lb/></p>

			<p>The current draft agreement text does not propose a review or assessment process for communicated<lb/> NDMCs themselves; nor would the interval proposed between communication and finalisation in any<lb/> case appear sufficient for a Party to adjust its contributions or commitments during the interval. A<lb/> country could potentially, however, adjust its NDMC at any time, and may formally be encouraged to<lb/> do so every five years in the case of a regular communication cycle, though not within the context of<lb/> multilateral process allowing for feedback and reflection.<lb/></p>

			<p>Only two multilateral processes mentioned in Article 3 of the draft agreement text on Mitigation<lb/> appear expected to have an impact on the content of successive NDMCs: the global stocktake (Article<lb/> 10), a collective assessment, and the process to facilitate implementation (Article 11), which could<lb/> include individual assessments. These are potentially to be taken &quot; into account &quot; as part of the features<lb/> of a NDMC.<lb/></p>

			<p>In terms of collective processes, an assessment of the aggregate effect of communicated NDMCs in<lb/> light of the temperature goal is proposed. The language used, &quot; production of an aggregate synthesis<lb/> report &quot; , suggests the recent synthesis report prepared by the UNFCCC Secretariat, examining the<lb/> aggregate effect of INDCs (UNFCCC, 2015b). Producing such a report in the future would be greatly<lb/> facilitated by greater clarity on NDMCs and the common use of metrics and accounting. The global<lb/> stocktake is presented in a separate article of the draft agreement, underlining its importance. The role<lb/> of the global stocktake will likely require some more detailed thinking. It is important because it links<lb/> aggregate longer-term goals with individual NDMCs, which are shorter term. Overall, such an<lb/> assessment would be greatly facilitated if individual countries also linked their NDMCs with their<lb/> own long-term low emission development strategies, or other relevant long-term development<lb/> strategies (e.g. sustainable development, green growth, poverty reduction). The use of non-GHG<lb/> metrics to track the actual drivers of low-emission development, as mentioned in Hood, Briner and<lb/> Rocha (2014), could be usefully integrated into NDCs, long-term strategies, and global assessments<lb/> (e.g. average emissions intensity of new power plants installed during the contribution period,<lb/> implementation of low-emission urban planning guidelines). Some design questions regarding a<lb/> global stocktake in relation to mitigation are presented in <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<p>As described in the draft agreement text, the global stocktake would be a broad exercise, taking stock<lb/> of the implementation of the agreement, and assessing Parties&apos; progress with achieving the purpose of<lb/> the agreement. It may be difficult to determine whether and how to either combine or distinguish<lb/> mitigation and non-mitigation areas, such as the implementation of mitigation actions and their<lb/> effects, alongside progress with actions conditional on support, and the provision or mobilisation of<lb/> such support. Currently in non-mitigation areas, the UNFCCC&apos;s Standing Committee on Finance<lb/> (SCF) undertakes a biennial assessment on global climate finance flows, identifying gaps and areas<lb/> for further work (SCF, 2013). Ideas for a collective adaptation objective are being explored, as well as<lb/> how progress against this can be tracked in some way (UNEP<ref type="biblio">, 2014; Magnan et al., 2014; Fisher and<lb/> Craft, 2015</ref>), despite this being both conceptually and practically challenging (<ref type="biblio">Ellis and Helgeson,<lb/> 2015</ref>). It is unclear how progress with any global objective would be assessed, but the Adaptation<lb/> Committee&apos;s current examination of how the Cancun Adaptation Framework has been implemented<lb/> might offer some lessons (UNFCCC, 2013). The monitoring of progress with implementing the UN<lb/> Sustainable Development Goals may also usefully provide a global stocktake of progress with<lb/> reducing risks and enhancing resilience 2 . The monitoring of global progress with the Sendai<lb/> Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030, may also provide helpful inputs.<lb/></p>

			<p>Multilateral processes could potentially facilitate implementation of NDMCs, which could in turn<lb/> increase ambition, for example, if a country was able to over achieve its NDMC targets. Other than a<lb/> &quot; preparatory process &quot; to facilitate the clarity of communicated NDMCs, most multilateral processes<lb/> examining individual NDMCs could potentially provide insights and feedback to improve<lb/> implementation, and indirectly impact the content of successive NDMCs. Proposals for the<lb/> transparency system (Article 9) include provisions for review of progress made in implementing and<lb/> achieving nationally determined mitigation contributions or commitments. This would allow for<lb/> regular feedback on implementation, particularly if a biennial review process continued to be in place.<lb/> It is suggested that outcomes of a system to facilitate implementation, proposed in Article 11, be<lb/> accounted for in NDMCs. Review processes within such a system could also help with addressing<lb/> challenges that hinder achievement of NDMC objectives. Depending on how this was designed, it<lb/> might do so only on an ad hoc or irregular basis, when Parties have problems with implementation or<lb/> with fulfilling their NDMCs, rather than providing regular, in-depth assessment that might facilitate<lb/> enhanced national action. <ref type="table">Table 4</ref>			<table>provides an overview of some advantages and disadvantages<lb/> associated with proposed multilateral processes that may impact the dynamism and ambition of<lb/> NDMCs, whether in their development/revision or implementation.<lb/> 18<lb/> A &quot; preparatory process &quot; or clarification exercise, for example, may be less useful if Parties agree to<lb/> specific types of information that will need to accompany communication of NDMCs. This<lb/> information could be reviewed as part of regular transparency system processes. It is unclear,<lb/> however, if the clarification is also meant as a political process to discuss the information provided, or<lb/> to gauge how well Parties&apos; NDMCs also meet other requirements, such as being as ambitious as<lb/> possible, or representing a progression from their previous contribution or commitment.<lb/> Table 4.

			<p>International reporting and review<lb/> allows for information sharing,<lb/> feedback, and identification of<lb/> areas where financial support or<lb/> other forms of cooperation may<lb/> be needed.<lb/> facilitative compliance and implementation system. The global stocktake, meant to assess<lb/> implementation and progress for all elements of the agreement, will need to be more clearly defined.<lb/> It would somehow need to consider overall implementation of mitigation, adaptation and means of<lb/> implementation provisions, while also taking into account the specificities of each issue. Future global<lb/> stocktakes could potentially draw on the experience of the Standing Committee on Finance, the<lb/> Adaptation Committee&apos;s ongoing work to examine progress with implementation of the Cancun<lb/> Adaptation Framework, the 2013-15 Review, as well as various external stocktaking processes (e.g.<lb/> UNEP gap reports, implementation of Sustainable Development Goals, Sendai framework, IPCC,<lb/> etc.).<lb/> Clarity on any international procedures and processes applying to NDMCs will be needed rapidly.<lb/> This will enable countries to understand and feel comfortable with any assessment, review and<lb/> stocktake processes they establish going forward, and can legally formalise the 2015 agreement as<lb/> early as possible ahead of 2020. In particular, countries will need to understand:<lb/> • when multilateral processes will take place;<lb/> • their aim, i.e. whether they will be assessments, reviews, or other facilitative exchanges;<lb/> • their scope, i.e. if they apply to individual countries or in aggregate;<lb/></p>

			<p>• what needs to be developed as stand-alone processes (e.g. global stocktake), what can be<lb/> integrated into current transparency systems or a future facilitative implementation<lb/> mechanism (e.g. review of implementation), and what could build on existing review<lb/> processes (e.g. the review of the long-term global goal) ;<lb/> • what inputs they need (with potential implications for transparency systems); and<lb/> • what the outcomes of these processes might be.<lb/> As part of a cycle of mitigation contributions or commitments, Parties would require appropriate<lb/> resources devoted to the type of assessment and review processes that could usefully facilitate NDMC<lb/> implementation, and provide confidence to all that Parties are making progress. Such processes,<lb/> which ideally need to link any assessment and recommendations to domestic decision-making<lb/> processes, tend to be resource intensive and require expertise. Existing assessment and review<lb/> processes may need to be adapted to better match the timing of NDMC implementation periods, and<lb/> any new information needs raised by the global stocktake.<lb/> At COP21, Parties might also need to decide on the status of INDCs submitted in the course of 2015.<lb/> Namely, on whether and how they may have the opportunity for international review, assessment or<lb/> consultation (even if it may be different in nature than the process outlined as part of the agreement),<lb/> particularly given that some countries have already indicated they will be revising or updating their<lb/> INDCs.<lb/></p>

			<p>Under an international agreement, it is essential that specific national mitigation contributions or<lb/> commitments put forward be achieved (and ideally overachieved), and that progress with meeting<lb/> these objectives be tracked. While contributions or commitments will be nationally determined,<lb/> international procedures and processes that carry these through a &quot; cycle &quot; can help support and<lb/> encourage increases in ambition over time. Over the next few years, Parties will need to agree on the<lb/> technical details of such processes so these are functional from 2020. In doing so, the domestic<lb/> benefits of well-designed international processes should be kept in mind. Systems that integrate<lb/> reviews, assessments and consultations between Parties all offer opportunities to emphasise, highlight<lb/> and encourage consistency with longer-term sustainable development pathways.<lb/></p>
