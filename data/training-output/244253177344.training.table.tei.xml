            <table>– see SNB (2007b, pp. 11-13). in 2006 alone, when the financial account recorded an outflow of CHF 91 billion and the current account a<lb/> surplus of CHF 72 billion the SNB shows that the net investment position rose by only CHF 3 billion.<lb/> A number of possible explanations come to mind:<lb/>  Valuation changes. Changing exchange rates clearly prevent the change in the stocks from<lb/> equalling the flows. Since most assets are in foreign currency and most liabilities in francs, it is<lb/> clear that if the franc appreciates the value of Swiss holdings will suffer the consequences. From<lb/> 1999 to 2006 an increase of the exchange rate was indeed observed. According to the<lb/> SNB (2007b), such exchange-rate losses have been worth an average of CHF 28 billion since<lb/> 2002. Secondly, and this may be the major explanation for the outcomes in 2005 and 2006, there<lb/> are valuation gains and losses on foreign holdings of equity in Switzerland and on Swiss holdings<lb/> of equity abroad. In a longer-term perspective, according to Stoffels and Tille (2007), such<lb/> valuation effects can explain only a part (around 30%) of the discrepancy on the net position<lb/> (with 23% and 7% attributable to exchange rates and asset prices fluctuations, respectively). With<lb/> direct investment at estimated market values (and not at book values as in international<lb/> investment position statistics), their calculations show that valuation effects are somewhat more<lb/> successful, accounting for almost exactly half of the total to be explained. For its part, the<lb/> SNB (2007b) attributes more than CHF 20 billion per year to such capital losses (about one-third<lb/> of the total).<lb/>  Measurement problems. One obvious distortion is that official Swiss data are calculated using<lb/> only book-value estimates for foreign direct investment. However, Stoffels and Tille (2007)<lb/> attempt an approximation to a market-value adjustment and find that the correction would go the<lb/> wrong way: the net position would actually worsen by 33.8% of 2005 GDP, rather than the small<lb/> improvement in the official data. 15 Other methodological questions arise from the SNB&apos;s periodic<lb/> improvements to their procedures. For example, the survey used to estimate direct investment<lb/> positions was broadened in 2004, resulting in a CHF 11.3 billion reduction in net foreign assets<lb/> (some 2.5 % of 2005 GDP), without any corresponding change in the financial flows (Stoffels<lb/> and Tille</table>

Swiss franc futures contracts on the Chicago Mercantile<lb/> Exchange (CME) were showing a substantial net non-commercial short position outstanding in 2005-07.<lb/> Indeed, the magnitude of that net position reached a record level of nearly 80 000 contracts on<lb/> 19 June 2007, which, at a value of CHF 125 000 per contract, implied a bet of nearly CHF 10 billion<lb/> against the franc. Higher CME short positions have tended to presage downward movements in the<lb/> currency against the dollar.<lb/> 27.<lb/> Tzanninis (2005) points out that loans to Austrian households in foreign currencies have surged since the<lb/> mid-1990s, reaching nearly 30 billion euros (30% of outstanding loans) by early 2005. Nearly all of these<lb/> loans are in Swiss francs. Franc-denominated loans to all non-banks totalled more than 40 billion euros<lb/> already at that point.</table>
