			<p>As part of a wider project on mental health in OECD countries, a series of descriptive profiles have<lb/> been prepared, intended to provide descriptive, easily comprehensible, highly informative accounts of the<lb/> mental health systems of OECD countries. These profiles, entitled &apos;Mental Health Analysis Profiles&apos;<lb/> (MHAPs), will be able to inform discussion and reflection and provide an introduction to and a synthesised<lb/> account of mental health in a given country. Each MHAP follows the same template, and whilst the<lb/> MHAPs are stand-alone profiles, loose cross-country comparison using the MHAPs is possible and<lb/> encouraged.<lb/></p>

			<p>The recent history of mental health in Italy has been one of de-institutionalisation. The significant<lb/> overhaul undertaken with regards to mental health over the last years is an example of this process: as it<lb/> moved away from the century-long tradition of restrictive mental health asylums (manicomi) from the late<lb/> 1970s with the recent process of closures of judicial psychiatric hospitals (Ospedali Psichiatrici Giudiziari<lb/> – OPG), Italy progressively managed to integrate mental health services within community-based facilities.<lb/> Focus was no longer on security and on isolating citizens suffering from mental disorders, but rather on<lb/> patients&apos; needs and moving towards social integration and rehabilitation.<lb/></p>

			<head>RÉSUMÉ<lb/></head>

			<figure>Lancée dans le cadre d&apos;un projet plus vaste consacré à la santé mentale dans les pays de l&apos;OCDE, la<lb/> série de profils « Santé mentale : profils d&apos;analyse » (Mental Health Analysis Profiles -MHAP) vise à<lb/> décrire de manière simple et détaillée les systèmes de santé mentale des pays de l&apos;OCDE. Ces profils, qui<lb/> étayeront les examens et les réflexions qui seront menés, feront le point sur la situation d&apos;un pays donné<lb/> dans le domaine de la santé mentale. Les profils MHAP sont indépendants les uns des autres mais suivent<lb/> le même modèle : il est donc possible, et recommandé, de les utiliser pour procéder à des comparaisons<lb/> entre pays.<lb/> L&apos;histoire récente de la santé mentale en Italie a été marquée par la désinstitutionalisation, comme en<lb/> témoignent les réformes importantes entreprises au cours des dernières années : en abandonnant peu à peu<lb/> le placement traditionnel en hôpital psychiatrique (manicomi) à partir de la fin des années 1970 et en<lb/> procédant depuis peu à la fermeture des hôpitaux psychiatriques judiciaires (Ospedali Psichiatrici<lb/> Giudiziari -OPG), l&apos;Italie est parvenue progressivement à intégrer des services de santé mentale dans les<lb/> services de proximité. La priorité n&apos;est plus accordée à la sécurité et à l&apos;isolement des patients souffrant de<lb/> troubles mentaux, mais plutôt aux besoins des patients, à leur insertion sociale et à leur réadaptation.<lb/></figure>

			<p>This report is part of a series of descriptive profiles – Mental Health Analysis Profiles (MHAPs),<lb/> produced by the OECD to give key insights into the mental health systems of select OECD countries.<lb/> Following a set framework, these profiles give a detailed introduction to the history, mental health needs,<lb/> and organisation and payment of care in select mental health systems. Countries have been selected so as<lb/> to give an overview of different ways of approaching mental health care system organisation across the<lb/> OECD, as well as to highlight examples of particularly innovative practice.<lb/></p>

			<p>2.<lb/> Having been one of the first countries to embark on the process of de-institutionalisation, Italy<lb/> remains a world leader and a great innovator in care for mental disorders. Replacing psychiatric asylums<lb/> with community-based services started in the 1960s and 1970s with the antipsychiatry movement led by<lb/> Franco Basaglia, and was formalised with the adoption of Law 180 in 1978, and consolidated in 1999 with<lb/> the actual closure of all mental hospitals in Italy. The Ministry of Health is committed to continuing to<lb/> reducing the use of inpatient psychiatric treatment, and to shortening the length of stay in Residential<lb/> Facilities, as part of the on-going de-institutionalisation process.<lb/></p>

			<p>3.<lb/> The federal organisation of Italy&apos;s health system, and mental health system, also makes Italy a<lb/> particularly interesting example. The Federal system gives regions significant autonomy to organise,<lb/> finance, deliver and monitor mental health services independently of central government, and to identify<lb/> priorities in the mental health sector outside of a standardised national approach. As a consequence of this<lb/> system, significant differences exist across regions in terms of the quality and quantity of mental health<lb/> services, with examples of striking innovation and successful care delivery found alongside much less<lb/> successful practices.<lb/> 4.<lb/> This report is designed to describe how mental health care is provided across the Italian<lb/> population, from service provision for children and young people to available mental health care for older<lb/> people. Attention is also paid to any groups in the population who may have difficulties accessing<lb/> appropriate mental health care, for example minority ethnic groups. The report begins with a short history<lb/> of the evolution of the Italian mental health system alongside a summary of the mental health<lb/> characteristics of the population. The report goes on to describe the design of the Italian mental health<lb/> system, recent mental health policy and legislation and a detailed examination of the mental health services<lb/> and financing in the country. Examples of national, regional and local mental health initiatives and group-<lb/>specific programmes are also explored.<lb/></p>

			<head>1. MENTAL HEALTH HISTORY, LEGISLATION AND HUMAN RIGHTS<lb/> 1.1. History and development of the mental health system<lb/></head>

			<p>5.<lb/> Stemming back to well before the unification of Italy in 1861, the mental health system was<lb/> fragmented into numerous mental health facilities and lacked unified regulation. Despite the contribution<lb/> of the Italian physician Vincenzo Chiarugi (1759-1820), who drew up the regulations of the S. Bonifacio<lb/> Hospital in Florence (1789) (<ref type="biblio">Burti, 2001</ref>), the first steps towards a more regulated mental health system<lb/> occurred only at the beginning of the 20 th century. As a result of the increasing number of people suffering<lb/> from some kind of mental disorder and seeking admission to mental hospitals, in 1901 a committee of<lb/> provincial councillors headed by Professor Belmondo was appointed by the provincial deputation of<lb/> Venice in order to inspect the region&apos;s mental health facilities. At the time of the inspection, there was still<lb/> no legislation regulating and unifying the variety of mental health facilities in the territory. Provincial<lb/> asylums, charitable institutions, hospital wards devoted to mental health and private asylums constituted<lb/> the spectrum of mental health services offered by localities, although substantial differences existed across<lb/> the regions. Management responsibilities differed significantly across asylums, with cases where physician<lb/> directors were given full health and administrative powers and other cases where they retained no major<lb/> responsibilities over expenses and financing. Common to all services were shortages of medical and<lb/> nursing staff, insufficient food provisions for inpatients, a lack of adequate hygienic conditions, the use of<lb/> brutal means of restraint and overcrowded facilities due to increasing inpatient admissions coupled with<lb/> decreasing discharge rates. The evaluation report that followed the inspection triggered questioning within<lb/> provincial councils, with substantial changes being promptly introduced: the harshest means of restraint<lb/> were abolished, health care personnel were replaced and some of the serving asylum directors were<lb/> relieved of duty (<ref type="biblio">Babini, 2009</ref>).<lb/> 6.<lb/> This restructuring process culminated in the adoption in 1904 of a mental health bill by the<lb/> Government, then headed by Prime Minister Giolitti. The Law 36 of 1904 ( &quot; Provisions on Public and<lb/> Private Mental Hospitals &quot; ) was the first mental health law in Italy aiming to regulate the development and<lb/> management of mental health facilities. The law gave psychiatrists full authority over the management and<lb/> administration of mental health services, including disciplinary and enforcement responsibilities.<lb/> Nevertheless, Law 36 was mainly centred on social control measures rather than on patients&apos; health needs.<lb/> Being labelled a danger to themselves and others, patients were committed against their will by physicians<lb/> and police magistrates. These compulsory admissions could be ruled as permanent by a court of justice,<lb/> and led to the loss of civil and political rights (<ref type="biblio">Lo Scalzo et al., 2009</ref>). In 1880, Enrico Morselli, an<lb/> illustrious Italian psychiatrist, had already highlighted the tricky nature of the mental health asylum<lb/> institution, which stems from its dual purpose of healing mentally disordered people whilst protecting<lb/> society from potential harm. Only with the adoption of Law 180 in 1978 and the progressive closure of<lb/> mental health hospitals in Italy did mental health treatment and social security embark on two clearly<lb/> distinct paths. The conditions that led to the development, approval and implementation of Law 180 have<lb/> to be sought in the years between 1904 and 1978.<lb/> 7.<lb/> In most European countries, the period between the First and Second World Wars saw the<lb/> development of somatic therapies mainly used for the treatment of schizophrenic patients, namely shock<lb/> therapies, e.g. insulin shock (<ref type="biblio">Sakel in Austria 1933</ref>), cardiazolic shock (1935), psychosurgery (<ref type="biblio">Moniz in<lb/> Portugal; Fiamberti in Italy, 1935</ref>), acetylcholine shock (1937) and finally electroshock (<ref type="biblio">Cerletti in Italy,<lb/> 1938</ref>) (<ref type="biblio">Babini, 2009</ref>). In the aftermath of the two world wars, these therapies became a valid and<lb/> inexpensive means of control over mentally disordered patients. The development of the first psychiatric<lb/> drugs from 1951 onwards in Italy and in other Western countries significantly transformed the approach to<lb/> patients&apos; mental health care and the way mental hospitals were managed. On the one hand, the use of<lb/> psychotropic pharmaceuticals substantially changed the relationship between patients and nurses, whose<lb/> tasks passed from control, restraint and coercion to assistance and education. On the other hand, this<lb/> dramatically transformed the relationship between patients and psychiatrists, allowing medical staff to<lb/> adopt forms of therapy, including psychotherapy, other than shock therapies and restraint measures.<lb/> 8.<lb/> Running in parallel with the development of psychotropic drugs was the revision of mental health<lb/> legislation in most Western countries. e.g. Portugal (1945), Norway (1949), Sweden (1949), <ref type="biblio">England<lb/> (1948-1959)</ref>, United States (1951), France (1953-1954) and Germany (1952). In Italy, even though many<lb/> proposals for the renovation of mental health legislation were introduced, ultimately they were never<lb/> adopted by the Parliament.<lb/> 9.<lb/> However, in 1962 the Ministry of Health published &quot; The Annals of Public Health &quot; (Annali della<lb/> Sanità Pubblica), a report devoted entirely to a description of Italy&apos;s mental health system. The outcomes<lb/> of the investigation revealed serious deficiencies within the provision of mental health services across the<lb/> country: a complete absence of any type of mental health facility in some regions; major differences in<lb/> terms of provision from region to region, with northern Italy being significantly more equipped than the<lb/> south; shortages in psychiatric bed provision; and insufficient availability of medical and nurse mental<lb/> health staff (<ref type="biblio">Babini, 2009</ref>).<lb/> 10.<lb/> As it became increasingly apparent that Law 36 was anachronistic, some initial experiments with<lb/> mental health institutions were conducted in the 1960s. The state mental hospital of Gorizia (Friuli-<lb/>Venezia-Giulia) headed by Franco Basaglia, a psychiatrist with a phenomenological orientation, was the<lb/> first example of the progressive de-institutionalisation process that later unfolded in other mental health<lb/> asylums across Italy. Psychiatric wards were progressively opened, allowing patients more freedom to<lb/> circulate both in the hospital and the municipality; excessively restrictive measures were abandoned (<ref type="biblio">Burti,<lb/> 2001</ref>); contact between physicians and patients was encouraged and strengthened; several activity clubs, an<lb/> internal journal named &quot; Il Picchio &quot; , as well as domestic &quot; committees &quot; integrating patients in the<lb/> management process of the asylum were established; medical uniforms were abolished. For the first time<lb/> in the history of mental health in Italy, even patients suffering from the most serious disorders were<lb/> entrusted with responsibilities within the hospital (<ref type="biblio">Basaglia, 1968</ref>). In addition, the Gorizia mental health<lb/> institution implemented a vast programme of discharge. Far from being an isolated event, the Gorizia pilot<lb/> trial served as an example for the development of similar experiments in democratisation and de-<lb/>institutionalisation across state mental health hospitals in Italy, e.g. <ref type="biblio">Perugia (1965), Parma (1965)</ref>, Cividale<lb/> del Friuli (1968) and Nocera Superiore (1969) (<ref type="biblio">Babini, 2009</ref>). Overall the Gorizia experiment contributed<lb/> to eradicating the belief that mentally disordered individuals were dangerous for the society and led to<lb/> replacing old-fashioned custodial care with alternative community care (<ref type="biblio">Transella, 1986</ref>).<lb/> 11.<lb/> In 1968, the Minister of Health, Luigi Mariotti, after comparing mental health asylums to<lb/> concentration camps ( &quot; Manicomi come lager &quot; ) (<ref type="biblio">Babini, 2009</ref>), approved the law excerpt n. 431 (otherwise<lb/> called the Mariotti Law), which made some substantial changes to the 1904 Law. Law excerpt 431 allowed<lb/> for voluntary hospitalisation in mental health hospitals that did not entail the loss of political and civil<lb/> rights; it eliminated the inscription of mentally disordered people onto criminal records (as established by<lb/> the Rocco Code under the Government of Mussolini), a formal stigma preventing mentally disordered<lb/> individuals for accessing public jobs once released from the asylum.<lb/> 12.<lb/> The years following the adoption of law 431 in 1968 saw the growth of the anti-psychiatry<lb/> movement, a political and cultural movement some of whose major exponents included, amongst others,<lb/> Michel Foucault in France, R.D. Laing in Scotland, Thomas Szasz in Hungary and Franco Basaglia in<lb/></p>

			<p>Italy. Mistrusting the attribution of mental illness to its biological components, the anti-psychiatry<lb/> movement claimed that the origin of mental disorders had to be sought in political, family, social and<lb/> relational roots, and subsequently criticised the the use of contention to deal with mental health disordered<lb/> individuals (<ref type="biblio">Bersani, 2009</ref>). Concretely, the movement aimed at creating two-way streets between the<lb/> mental health system and the broader community, establishing social cooperatives by joining forces with<lb/> other citizens&apos; groups, and working toward community inclusion on a person-by-person basis (<ref type="biblio">Davidson et<lb/> al., 2010</ref>). Designed like this, the process involves all its subjects as active participants, transforms the<lb/> power relationship existing between the patient (and citizen) and the institution, and creates mental health<lb/> services that completely replace detention in mental hospitals by deconstructing them and reconverting the<lb/> material and human resources found in them (<ref type="biblio">De Leonardis et al., 1986</ref>). In the wake of the Gorizia<lb/> experiment and with the impetus of the anti-psychiatry protest, other mental health asylums started<lb/> following the Gorizia example. One of the most representative instances of the anti-psychiatry movement<lb/> was the mental hospital of San Giovanni, based in Trieste and headed by Franco Basaglia (see Box 1).<lb/></p>

			<head>Box 1. San Giovanni psychiatric hospital in Trieste<lb/></head>

			<p>The San Giovanni psychiatric hospital was built in 1908 in Trieste. In Italy at that time, the San Giovanni<lb/> psychiatric hospital was considered an exemplary model of mental health asylum, but from the 1930s security<lb/> measures were introduced. In 1971, the then president of the provincial administration, the left-wing Christian<lb/> Democrat Michele Zanetti appointed Franco Basaglia director of the San Giovanni asylum, with the idea of renovating<lb/> psychiatric care, requalifying the medical and nurse personnel and raising funds for the psychiatric hospital. As director<lb/> of the San Giovanni hospital, which at that time hosted approximately 1200 inpatients, 90% of whom were mandatory,<lb/> Basaglia started a process of criticism of the mental health institution (<ref type="biblio">Dell&apos;Acqua, 2010</ref>).<lb/> As soon as Basaglia became the director of the asylum, the Mariotti Law was implemented in the hospital, with<lb/> the aim of increasing and strengthening the medical personnel. Basaglia preferred to train young physicians rather<lb/> than hiring psychiatrists already active in other mental health asylums. Together with nurses and future psychiatrists, a<lb/> large number of volunteers, including students and workers, were also integrated into the asylum&apos;s community life.<lb/> Volunteers actively participated in the hospital&apos;s decision-making process, contributed to organising activities for<lb/> inpatients and followed patients on an individual basis. Even patients suffering from severe mental health disorders<lb/> were entrusted with responsibilities within the hospital. It was a patient who used to swallow every type of metallic<lb/> object, provoking serious injuries to his person, to whom Basaglia gave managing responsibilities over the coffee bar<lb/> within the hospital; and a group of women were allowed to conduct autonomous lives in the apartment that was<lb/> previously used by the asylum&apos;s director (<ref type="biblio">Basaglia, 1968</ref>).<lb/> As in the Gorizia experiment, constraint measures were abolished, the use of electroshock was suppressed, the<lb/> barriers enclosing the wards were removed and the hospital doors and gates opened. In 1972, a programme of<lb/> financial subsidies was launched. Grants were assigned to former patients who were unemployed in order to avoid<lb/> renewed hospitalisation and to escape the vicious cycle binding poverty with seclusion. At the beginning of 1973, Art. 4<lb/> of the Mariotti law was implemented within the hospital, according to which voluntary admissions allowed a patient (the<lb/> &quot; host &quot; ) to be hospitalised without losing civil and political rights.<lb/> Running in parallel to this vast range of democratisation and de-institutionalisation was the idea that further<lb/> initiatives should be undertaken in order to look beyond the asylum walls and towards the community, by putting in<lb/> contact &quot; sane &quot; people living in the city with &quot; mentally ill &quot; patients living in the hospital. A group of patients started to<lb/> increasingly participate in parties and activities within the city of Trieste. On February 1973, a blue-painted horse of<lb/> paper-machè and wood, called &quot; Marco Cavallo &quot; , together with a long procession of patients, physicians, nurses and<lb/> health workers, paraded the streets of Trieste. The wooden horse was built by the patients in the course of a<lb/> painting/sculpture/theatre/writing workshop within the hospital, and the name &quot; Marco Cavallo &quot; was adopted in honour<lb/> of the horse that for years had been transporting the patient&apos;s linen from the hospital to the laundry. &quot; Marco Cavallo &quot;<lb/> became the symbol of the process of liberation of inpatients, bringing the mentally disordered people into the social life<lb/> of Trieste.<lb/> In September 1973, the United Workers Cooperative (Cooperativa dei Lavoratori Uniti), composed of San<lb/> Giovanni inpatients, was legally recognised. The members of the Cooperative were given a paid contract for the<lb/> cleaning and maintenance of the hospital, putting an end to the use of occupational therapy within the hospital.<lb/> Following these developments at the San Giovanni hospital, in October 1973 the WHO declared Trieste a &quot; pilot<lb/> zone &quot; for psychiatry (<ref type="biblio">Babini, 2009</ref>). The de-institutionalisation process culminated with the opening of the first<lb/> community-based mental health centres in areas surrounding the San Giovanni hospital in 1975-1976, actually shifting<lb/> the axis of mental health care from the hospital to the community (<ref type="biblio">Dell&apos;Acqua, 2010</ref>). Following the inception of Law<lb/> 180 in 1978, the hospital of Trieste was closed in 1980. The San Giovanni mental health hospital of Trieste was the<lb/> first hospital that has been closed in Italy, paving the way for the de-institutionalisation of mental patients and the<lb/> establishment of an alternative model of community-based services, performing all the functions and providing all the<lb/> services that were previously provided by asylums (<ref type="biblio">Russo &amp; Carelli, 2009</ref>).<lb/> &quot; <ref type="biblio">[…]</ref> the important thing is that we have shown that the impossible becomes possible. Ten, fifteen, twenty<lb/> years ago, it was unthinkable that an asylum could be dismantled. Asylums could become closed, and more<lb/> closed than before – I do not know – but, at any account, we have shown that the mad can be assisted in<lb/> another way, and this evidence is basic &quot; (<ref type="biblio">Basaglia, 1979</ref>).<lb/> 13.<lb/> In 1978, Law 180 (also called Law Basaglia) was approved, with the mental hospital of Trieste<lb/> being the first asylum to be closed in Italy. Law 180 in fact forbade new admissions to mental health<lb/> institutes and the construction of new mental hospitals. Law 180 aimed at progressively closing existing<lb/> mental hospitals, thus operating a translation from old mental health facilities, isolated from other health<lb/> departments, to new fully integrated psychiatric services. Prevention, care and rehabilitation represented an<lb/> important new feature of the 1978 law, in place of the aforementioned restrictive social control measures,<lb/> with the new mental health facilities being in charge of the full array of mental health care, i.e. providing<lb/> appropriate care to patients through community-based services, outpatient interventions and/or exceptional<lb/> and temporary compulsory admissions (<ref type="biblio">Lo Scalzo, 2009</ref>). Law 180 represented undisputed progress<lb/> towards de-institutionalisation in Italy and abroad, and led to the progressive closure of mental health<lb/> hospitals, the recognition of civil rights for people suffering from some kind of mental disorder, the<lb/> transformation of the century-long relationship between psychiatry and justice, and the establishment of a<lb/> variety of community-based mental health facilities within the territory. The inception of the de-<lb/>institutionalisation of mental health in Italy also coincided with the creation of the National Health Service<lb/> (NHS) (<ref type="biblio">Servizio Sanitario Nazionale -SSN) in 1978.<lb/></ref> 14.<lb/> This transition from old-style mental hospitals to new community-based facilities was, however,<lb/> a slow process, with the 1978 law failing to design a precise framework and timeline for this transition and<lb/> with all mental health hospitals being eventually closed only in 1999 (<ref type="biblio">WHO, 2011</ref>) (for further information<lb/> on the closure of mental hospitals, see Box 2).<lb/></p>

			<head>Box 2. The process of closure of mental hospitals<lb/></head>

			<p>There are currently no mental hospitals in Italy, as all of them have progressively been replaced by the<lb/> Departments of Mental Health (DMHs) (Dipartimento di Salute Mentale –DSM) and a set of mental health services<lb/> and facilities including Community Mental Health Centres (CMHCs), the General Hospital Psychiatric Units (GHPU),<lb/> semi-residential facilities and residential facilities (Ministry of Health, 2011c; Ministry of Health, 2011d).<lb/> Before the de-institutionalisation process brought about by Law 180, in 1978 there were 76 mental hospitals in<lb/> Italy with a total of 78 538 mental health residents (<ref type="biblio">De Girolamo et al., 2007a</ref>). Law 180 enforced the compulsory<lb/> closure of all existing mental hospitals and the discharge of all patients committed to asylums. Further legislation<lb/> established the Department of Mental Health as the community-based service in charge of mental health care in each<lb/> Local Health Authority (ASL), and thus devolved care for mental illness to ASLs. This was, however, a slow and<lb/> difficult process, as precise guidelines for the transition from asylums to community-based facilities were not provided<lb/> in Law 180. The financial law 724 of 1994 established a deadline for the final closure of all former mental health<lb/> hospitals (December 31st 1996). A committee for monitoring the progressive closure of mental hospitals was<lb/> appointed, but the process was nonetheless gradual and slow. Other financial laws in 1996 (Law 662) and 1997 (Law<lb/> 449) reaffirmed the necessity of the planned closure of mental hospitals, a task that was eventually postponed until<lb/> 1998 and finally completed in 1999 (<ref type="biblio">Lo Scalzo et al., 2009</ref>).<lb/> 15.<lb/> A set of two mental health national plans implemented in 1994 and 1998 further specified<lb/> guidelines for service organisation, personnel training and transitional supervision (Ministry of Health,<lb/> 1994; Ministry of Health, 2008a). A number of initiatives for monitoring the process were also promoted<lb/> by the Ministry of Health and offered support to the regions to complete the transition.<lb/> 16.<lb/> The first Targeted Mental Health Care Plan (Progetto Obiettivo per la Tutela della Salute<lb/> Mentale 1994-1996) (Ministry of Health<ref type="biblio">, 1994</ref>) was implemented in the mid-1990s and created the<lb/> Department of Mental Health (DMH), a network of mental health services responsible for mental health<lb/> interventions and planning in each Local Health Authority. Guidelines on training personnel were defined<lb/> and the final closure of old mental institutions was planned, but completed only in 1999.<lb/> 17.<lb/> A second national plan for mental health was then adopted for the period 1998-2000 in order to<lb/> further define guidelines for residential facilities, which were to provide services for the last patients still<lb/> committed in the old mental institutions, and for health interventions, social integration and rehabilitation.<lb/> In this respect, the <ref type="table">Targeted</ref>			<table>Mental Health Care Plan 1998-2000 (Progetto Obiettivo Tutela Salute Mentale<lb/> 1998-2000) (Ministry of Health<ref type="biblio">, 1998a</ref>) focused mainly on providing for better integration of existing<lb/> mental health services (<ref type="biblio">Burti, 2001</ref>) and for quality of care. The Targeted Mental Health Care Plan 1998-<lb/>2000 aims at designing coverage for people affected by severe mental disorders and thus unable to live<lb/> autonomously or exercise fully their citizenship rights. This population constitutes the core of priority<lb/> health interventions that must be undertaken with the full cooperation and collaboration of mental health<lb/> services, families and associations. The goals of the Targeted Mental Health Care Plan 1998-2000 were:<lb/> • To promote mental health in throughout the life cycle, even in the heart of medical prevention<lb/> programmes and health education programmes;<lb/> • To prevent mental disorders at primary and secondary levels, with particular focus on high-risk<lb/> sub-populations through the early mapping of difficult situations (especially among young<lb/> people) and therapeutic-preventive interventions;<lb/> • To prevent mental disorders in public health, i.e. effectively decreasing disabling consequences<lb/> via the reconstruction of personal, relational and social interconnections for people with severe<lb/> mental disorders (with a focus on rehabilitation through work). This reconstructive mission takes<lb/> place through resource activation;<lb/> • To maintain mental health and quality of life within the family nucleus to acceptable levels,<lb/> improving the global functioning of family nuclei with serious relational issues, reducing the<lb/> figures on suicide and attempted suicide in high-risk populations (i.e. specific mental pathologies<lb/> or age-groups, like adolescents and seniors);<lb/></p>

			<p>• To achieve better integration of mental health services with other services (universities, local<lb/> administrations, non-profit organisations, etc.) and encourage participation of non-public actors<lb/> (user and family associations);<lb/></p>

			<table>• To promote better and more comprehensive information for patients and families, along with<lb/> evidence-based medicine, standards for the certification of services and quality assurance;<lb/> • To evaluate the efficacy and effectiveness of interventions;<lb/> • To reorganise the delivery system of mental health services for children and adolescents.<lb/> 18.<lb/> Strategies to attain these goals aimed at specifying the organisation of the mental health services,<lb/> since prior legislation had failed to do so. The Targeted Mental Health Care Plan 1998-2000 set out the<lb/> characteristics of the Departments of Mental Health (DMHs) (Dipartimento Salute Mentale – DSM) that<lb/> resulted from the first national plan for mental health for the period 1994-1998. In particular, the 1998-<lb/>2000 Targeted Mental Health Care Plan stated</table>

			<p>that each of the then 196 Local Health Authorities in Italy<lb/> should have its own Department of Mental Health, with coverage of a population of at most 150 000<lb/> inhabitants. There should be one Director for each DMH, in charge of managing the human and financial<lb/> resources allocated to the module, organising a Monitoring and Evaluation System, and contributing to the<lb/> promotion of quality assurance and the provision of ongoing personnel training. There should be an<lb/> average ratio of one Department of Mental Health professional for every 1 500 inhabitants. Moreover, the<lb/> <ref type="table">Targeted</ref>			<figure>Mental Health Care Plan 1998-2000 specified the functions of each mental health service<lb/> provided by the Department of Mental Health (Ministry of Health, 1998a) (for further information on<lb/> mental health services provided by DMHs, see section 4.1.).<lb/> 19.<lb/> A new policy document, the National Strategic Plan for Mental Health (Linee di indirizzo<lb/> nazionali per la salute mentale) (Ministry of Health, 2008a), was issued in March 2008, with the approval<lb/> of the Standing Conference on the Relations between the State, the Regions and the Autonomous<lb/> Provinces (hereafter the Standing Conference between State and Regions) (Conferenza Stato/Regioni).<lb/> This document updated the priorities and underlined the critical areas where intervention was required,<lb/> especially concerning the Departments of Mental Health and the necessity to homogenise their services<lb/> across the territory. Local and regional collaboration are also pointed out as key elements for improving<lb/> equity of access to mental health services and overall quality, with the Departments of Mental Health being<lb/> responsible for organising consultation roundtables (tavolo di concertazione locale) on priority objectives.<lb/> The Local Health Authorities also were required to be equipped with their own Local Plan for Mental<lb/> Health (Piano di Azione Locale per la Salute Mentale) obtained through consultation with all local actors.<lb/> However, at the moment only a few regions have formally included the 2008 National Strategic Plan for<lb/> Mental Health into their regional planning.<lb/> 20.<lb/> The last national mental health strategy was released in January 2013 – the Italian Mental Health<lb/> Action Plan (IMHAP) (Linee di Azioni Nazionale per la Salute Mentale) (Ministry of Health, 2013) (see<lb/> section 6.2 for further information).<lb/> 21.<lb/> Although the core of mental health strategies are settled within national mental health plans,<lb/> every two years a National Health Plan (Piano Sanitario Nazionale) is released by the Ministry of Health<lb/> with a special section devoted to mental health as a priority area – as did, for example, the National Health<lb/> Plan 2006-2008 (Ministry of Health<ref type="biblio">, 2006</ref>). The plan individuated the weaknesses of the mental health<lb/> system in Italy and identified the priority areas for joint focus by the Government and regions. Overall staff<lb/> shortages and the need to manage deficiencies in the Departments of Mental Health (DMHs) resulted in an<lb/> inability to provide adequate services for individuals with mental illness; the general population is unaware<lb/> of the meaning of mental illness; there is little knowledge about the existence of mental health facilities<lb/> and how they work; and there is a general lack of early intervention in severe mental health cases. The<lb/> overall goals of the 2006 National Health Plan were:<lb/></p>

			<table>• Reducing stigma;<lb/> • Actuating early intervention programmes for the treatment of schizophrenia;<lb/> • Guaranteeing therapeutic continuity between mental health services for children, adolescents,<lb/> adults and older people;<lb/> • Establishing recovery and reintegration programmes for mentally disordered offenders;<lb/> • Developing a National Mental Health Information System.<lb/> 22.<lb/> The last release of the National Health Plan covered the period 2011-2013 (Piano Sanitario<lb/> Nazionale 2011-2013) (Ministry of Health, 2011a). At the time of writing, this last release is still in draft<lb/> form. In the section devoted to mental health, some key areas were pinpointed:<lb/> • Children and adolescents&apos; mental health;<lb/> • Old people&apos;s mental health;<lb/> • Suicides;<lb/> • Mental disorders related to substance abuse;<lb/> • Mental health within prisons and security services;<lb/></table>

			<p>• The physical well-being of mentally disordered individuals.<lb/></p>

Mental health legislation<lb/> 23.<lb/> Italy&apos;s mental health legislation comprises one national law on the principles of mental health<lb/> provision, twenty separate regional laws and separate legislation from two autonomous Provinces,<lb/> consistent with the fact that the planning, management and administration of health services are<lb/> constitutionally devolved to the regions.<lb/> 24.<lb/> National Mental Health Law 180/1978: The national law on mental health, Law 180 (or Law<lb/> Basaglia), was approved on 13 May 1978. From 1978, the broad national law has remained unchanged,<lb/> whereas regional laws have been revised several times.<lb/> 25.<lb/> The 1978 national law on mental health covered four principal elements:<lb/> • The immediately effective ban on new admissions to existing mental hospitals and on the<lb/> building of new mental hospitals or similar facilities; a planned gradual closure of existing mental<lb/> hospitals;<lb/> • The establishment of psychiatric wards within general hospitals, with a maximum of 15 beds<lb/> each;<lb/> • The promotion of community-based services – Community-based Mental Health Centres – put in<lb/> charge of the full array of mental health needs in the community (prevention, care and<lb/> rehabilitation);<lb/> • The establishment of the CTO, the Compulsory Treatment Orders (Trattamento Sanitario<lb/> Obbligatorio, TSO), which asserted that compulsory admissions for mental illness would focus<lb/> on patients&apos; health needs and should be temporary, exceptional and highly monitored by medical<lb/> staff and a court of Justice (see below).<lb/> 26.<lb/> Law 180 was incorporated as Articles 33, 34, 35 and 64 into Law 833 of 31 December 1978<lb/> (hereafter, Law 833/1978). Law 833/1978 reformed Italy&apos;s entire health system.<lb/> 27.<lb/> Art. 33-35 of Law 833/1978: The Compulsory Treatment Order (CTO) (Trattamento Sanitario<lb/> Obbligatorio – TSO) was introduced with Law 180 and is currently regulated by Law 833/1978 (Art.33-<lb/>35). It covers</table>

			<p>carrying out assessments and providing treatments to mentally disordered individuals who<lb/> refuse to be treated. There are three major conditions under which the CTO could apply: the person is<lb/> affected by some kind of mental health illness and subsequently needs urgent medical treatment; the person<lb/> refuses to be treated; besides hospitalisation, there is no other timely and appropriate measure that could be<lb/> undertaken to treat the person. The implementation of a CTO occurs both at the medical and judicial level:<lb/> after two medical doctors make a formal request to the relevant Local Health Authority for the patient to<lb/> receive the CTO, the mayor of the city (Sindaco) approves or denies it within 10 days from the referral.<lb/> Though extendable, the CTO has a maximum duration of seven days (see section 1.2. on seclusion and<lb/> restraint).<lb/> 28.<lb/> Law 68/1999: Law 68 on the right to work for people with disabilities (Norme per il Diritto al<lb/> Lavoro dei Disabili) implemented a system of integration into the employment market. This legislation<lb/> triggered a significant change, as Law 482 of 1968 focused mainly on a charitable philosophy that did not<lb/> allow disabled people to feel integrated into the employment market and entitled to a proper wage for their<lb/> work. In this respect, Law 68 focused on matching the work potentialities of disabled people with a work<lb/> position, while not putting an additional burden on the firms concerned. This legislation was adopted after<lb/> several trials were conducted in some Local Health Authorities in the Northern regions, as professional<lb/> training and work integration were devolved to the regions and local authorities.<lb/></p>

			<table>29.<lb/> Law 67/2006: &quot; Measures for the safeguard of disabled people who are victims of discrimination &quot;<lb/> (Misure per la tutela giudiziaria delle persone con disabilità vittime di discriminazioni) is a legal<lb/> framework aiming to protect the civil and political and economic rights of disabled individuals and protect<lb/> them from stigma and discrimination.<lb/> 30.<lb/> Prime Ministerial Decree/2008 (Decreto Presidente del Consiglio dei Ministri – DPCM):<lb/> approved on 1 April 2008, the 2008 DPCM requires the eventual transfer of health care responsibilities<lb/> from the prison service (Department of prison administration; Department of Juvenile Justice) to the NHS.<lb/> The Prime Ministerial Decree/2008 specifies which clinical-rehabilitative interventions should be<lb/> considered health interventions to be provided and monitored by the Ministry of Health and which ones<lb/> were security measures that were to remain under the responsibility of the Ministry of Justice. It also<lb/> reaffirmed that care and mental health interventions were provided through territorial and regional bodies,<lb/> as was first implemented by Law 180 for civil psychiatry (see section 4.3. for further information).<lb/> 31.<lb/> Decree of 15 October 2010: Most recently, the decree of 15 October 2010 made way for the<lb/> implementation of the long-awaited national Mental Health Information System (Sistema Informativo<lb/> Salute Mentale -SISM) in order to ensure the viability of the Essential Levels of Assistance (Levelli<lb/> Essenziali di Assistenza -LEA) and especially to:<lb/></table>

			<p>• Monitor the activity of mental health services and analyse their volume and treatment patterns;<lb/> • Support the managerial activity of the Departments of Mental Health, in order to evaluate their<lb/> efficiency and utilisation of resources;<lb/> • Support the process of elaborating structural indicators on both regional and national levels.<lb/></p>

			<head>Detainment, restraint and seclusion rates<lb/></head>

			<figure>32.<lb/> CTOs accounted for 50% of total admissions in 1975 (3 years before the introduction of Law<lb/> 180), whilst the figure dropped to 20% in 1984 and to approximately 14% in recent years (De Girolamo et<lb/> al., 2006a). CTOs (as a percentage of total psychiatric discharges) have increased slightly across the period<lb/> 2005-2008, from 14.16% of total psychiatric discharges in 2005 to 14.55% in 2008 (ISTAT, 2011). In<lb/> regions where public beds are scarce (Sicilia, Valle d&apos;Aosta, Emilia Romagna and Sardegna), CTOs are<lb/> twice as frequent as in other regions (De Girolamo et al., 2006a; Ministry of Health, 2011b) (see Figure 1).<lb/> Figure 1.

			<p>population are ascribable to neuropsychiatric disorders, representing approximately 25% of the<lb/> overall burden of disease in Italy. In 2001, depression represented 7% of the total burden, substance abuse<lb/> accounted for 5% (with alcohol use disorders representing 3% and drug use disorders 2%) and dementia<lb/> 4%. Bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, obsessive-compulsive disorder and panic disorder each represented<lb/> 1% of the total burden in Italy (<ref type="biblio">Lopez et al., 2006</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<head>Prevalence of mild to moderate mental ill health<lb/></head>

			<p>34.<lb/> Two main mental health epidemiology studies were conducted in Italy over the last ten years: the<lb/> &quot; European Study on the Epidemiology of Mental Disorders &quot; (ESEMeD) (<ref type="biblio">Alonso et al., 2003; De Girolamo<lb/> et al., 2006a; De Girolamo et al., 2006b</ref>) and the Sesto Fiorentino Study (<ref type="biblio">Faravelli et al., 2004</ref>). Other<lb/> epidemiology studies were conducted by the National Institute of Statistics (ISTAT, 2010) and the<lb/> National Institute of Health (ISS, 2012a).<lb/> 35.<lb/> The ESEMeD is an international mental health survey of six countries (France, Germany,<lb/> Belgium, Italy, Spain and Holland) conducted by the WHO in 2001-2002 (<ref type="biblio">Alonso et al., 2003</ref>). Managed<lb/> by the National Institute of Health (Istituto Superiore di Sanità – ISS) and conducted among 4 712 Italian<lb/> citizens, the survey found that the annual prevalence of mild to moderate mental illness was 7.3% in Italy<lb/> in 2001 (<ref type="biblio">De Girolamo et al., 2006a</ref>).<lb/> 36.<lb/> Major depression, specific phobias and dysthymia (chronic depression) were the most common<lb/> mental illnesses, with a lifetime prevalence in Italy of respectively 10.1%, 5.7% and 3.4%. Post-traumatic<lb/> disorder, social phobia and general anxiety disorders had a lifetime prevalence of approximately 2%. Other<lb/> mental illnesses covered by the survey (panic attacks, agoraphobia and alcoholism) had a relatively low<lb/> prevalence (below 2%) (<ref type="biblio">De Girolamo et al., 2006a</ref>). Women presented a higher risk of exposure to mental<lb/> disorders, although alcohol use disorders were more common among men. High-risk populations included<lb/> separated/divorced people and widowers, along with unemployed people (twice as likely to suffer from<lb/> depression), housewives (twice as likely to suffer from any kind of mental disorder) and physically<lb/> disabled people (eight times as likely to suffer from mental disorders). Moreover, the ESEMeD study gave<lb/> evidence that people are likely to suffer from different mental disorders at the same time (co-morbidity).<lb/> About 40% of people who suffered from depression in the considered year also experienced anxiety<lb/> disorders, and 27% of people who suffered from anxiety disorders also suffered from depression. Although<lb/> the statistical significance is questionable, the ESEMeD study also found that the prevalence of mental<lb/> illness (especially depression and anxiety disorders) was higher in Southern Italy and the Islands (Sicilia<lb/> and Sardegna) than in Northern and Central Italy (<ref type="biblio">De Girolamo et al., 2006a</ref>).<lb/> 37.<lb/> The second epidemiological study was conducted over 2 363 residents in Sesto Fiorentino<lb/> (Toscana), and reported that 8.6% of people were suffering from some kind of mental illness, with anxiety<lb/> (3.5%) and depression (3.4%) being the most frequent type (<ref type="biblio">Faravelli et al., 2004</ref>).<lb/> 1<lb/> &quot; Disability-adjusted life years &quot; (DALY) is a measure of the population&apos;s health that combines into a single<lb/> indicator the &quot; years of life lost due to premature mortality and the years of life lost due to time lived in<lb/> states of less than full health &quot; (WHO).<lb/> 38.<lb/> More recently, ISTAT published data on mental health prevalence indicating that 4.3% of the<lb/> total population suffers from some kind of &quot; neurosis &quot; , whilst the figure is more than double (9.8%) for<lb/> people aged over 65 (ISTAT, 2010).<lb/> 39.<lb/> According to a national survey conducted by the Cnesps of the National Institute of Health<lb/> (Istituto Superiore di Sanità – ISS) over a pool of Local Health Authorities in Italy (85% of all ASLs) in<lb/> the period 2009-2012, 6.6% of people (adults aged 18-64) referred with probable symptoms of depression<lb/> (see below), although differences exist across regions (see <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>). Of these individuals, 58.2% sought<lb/> some kind of help: 32.5% consulted a doctor (GP or specialist), 18.2% turned to their family and 7.5%<lb/> asked for help from both a doctor and their family, whilst the remaining 41.8% did not seek any help (ISS,<lb/> 2012a). The instrument used to screen for depression symptoms was the Patient Health Questionnaire-2<lb/> (Phq-2). The purpose of the Phq-2 is not to establish a final diagnosis or to monitor the severity of<lb/> symptoms, but rather to individuate people with probable symptoms of depression to be referred to mental<lb/> health specialist services (<ref type="biblio">Kroenke et al., 2003</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<p>40.<lb/> The CNESPS-ISS study showed that the frequency of symptoms of depression increases with<lb/> age, and in general women, people with a low level of education, people with lower incomes, individuals<lb/> with no regular employment, people suffering from at least one chronic pathology (ictus, cardiovascular<lb/> diseases, cancer, diabetes, respiratory diseases and chronic liver illness), and people living alone are more<lb/> likely to show symptoms of depression (see <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>), as are Italian citizens when compared with foreign<lb/> residents.

			<head>Prevalence of severe mental ill health<lb/></head>

			<p>42.<lb/> The project PROGRES-CSM found that, in 2004, there were approximately 32 000 new cases of<lb/> schizophrenia in Italy, representing an annual incidence of 73.6 per 100 000 population. This figure was<lb/> calculated on 541 Community Mental Health Centres (CMHCs) and on a population of 43 539 857<lb/> inhabitants. However, significant differences were registered across regions, with Calabria, Tuscany and<lb/> Sicily registering a much higher incidence compared to Lazio, Liguria and Lombardia (<ref type="biblio">Gonella et al.,<lb/> 2008</ref>).<lb/> 43.<lb/> The project S.E.M.E. on the epidemiological surveillance of severe mental illness (Sorveglianza<lb/> epidemiologica dei disturbi mentali gravi) (CCM, 2011) was started in May 2009 and is organised and<lb/> managed by the National Institute of Health (Istituto Superiore Sanità – ISS). The aim of the S.E.M.E.<lb/> project is to determine the prevalence of severe mental illness in Italy by gathering data from<lb/> 22 Community Mental Health Centres (CMHCs) (Centro Salute Mentale – CSM) across 15 regions in<lb/> Italy.<lb/> 44.<lb/> During the first year of implementation, 17.7 individuals per 100 000 population were treated for<lb/> a severe mental health problem within the 22 CMHCs selected. This figure, however, is likely to<lb/> underestimate the actual prevalence of severe mental illness within the population, in that it does not take<lb/> into account patients treated by private mental health specialists, patients hospitalised within psychiatric<lb/> wards in general hospitals, or patients who are not receiving any treatment. Psychotic disorders, including<lb/> schizophrenia, represent the majority of cases (40%), followed by bipolar disorder (30%), major depressive<lb/> disorder (19%) and nervous anorexia. Data from the first year of the implementation also show that 48% of<lb/> patients with severe mental illness have a low level of education (&lt; 8 years of education), 48% live with<lb/> their families, 40% are unemployed, and 87% live in very poor or modest economic conditions. The study<lb/> 1<lb/> 2<lb/> 2<lb/> 7<lb/> 17<lb/> 10<lb/> 0<lb/> 5<lb/> 10<lb/> 15<lb/> 20<lb/> Days with limited activity<lb/> Days with bad mental health status<lb/> Days with bad physical health status<lb/> With depression<lb/> Without depression<lb/></figure>

			<p>found that the median period between the first symptoms and the first contact with a CSM is 4 years<lb/> (<ref type="biblio">CCM, 2011</ref>), suggesting the failure of the mental health system in Italy to promptly intervene at the first<lb/> stages of severe mental health problems.<lb/> 45.<lb/> Studies exist on the estimation of severe mental illness also at the regional level. For instance, in<lb/> 2006 a study estimated the prevalence of severe mental health problems across 10 Departments of Mental<lb/> Health (DMHs) in the Lombardy region, using the HoNOS (Health of the Nation Outcome Scales) to<lb/> assess patients&apos; mental health status. It was estimated that, within mental health services in the Lombardy<lb/> region, there were 3.1 per 1 000 suffering from some kind of severe mental illness every year (aged over<lb/> 14) (<ref type="biblio">Lora et al., 2006</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<head>Children and adolescents&apos; mental health status<lb/></head>

			<p>46.<lb/> The Italian pre-adolescent mental health project (PrISMA) is a two-phase study that was<lb/> conducted on 3 418 participants using the child behaviour checklist/6–18 (CBCL) 2 and the development<lb/> and well-being assessment (DAWBA) 3 with the aim of estimating the prevalence of mental disorders<lb/> among pre-adolescents living in urban areas. The results showed an overall prevalence of mental disorders<lb/> among children and adolescents of 8.2% for the CBCL and 9.8% for the DAWBA. Internalising disorders<lb/> (anxiety, panic, depression disorders and other inner-directed states) were significantly more frequent<lb/> (6.5%) than externalising disorders (negative, destructive beheaviours) (1.2%). An older age, having<lb/> repeated a grade, living with a single parent, a lower level of maternal and paternal education or lower<lb/> socio-economic status or income were positively correlated with a higher prevalence of mental health<lb/> problems. It is noteworthy that 80% of the participants with some kind of mental disorder, however, did<lb/> not seek professional help (<ref type="biblio">Frigerio et al., 2009</ref>), suggesting that the treatment gap is, as was the case for<lb/> adults (De <ref type="biblio">Girolamo et al., 2006</ref>), an issue of paramount importance that needs to be addressed in Italy.<lb/></p>

			<head>Elderly population mental health status<lb/></head>

			<p>47.<lb/> The CNESPS-ISS conducted a study on &quot; Mental Health and Social Seclusion across people over<lb/> age 64 &quot; (ISS, 2012b). The percentage of individuals showing probable symptoms of depression is higher<lb/> for elderly people than for adults, and the frequency of probable symptoms significantly increases with<lb/> age. In fact, in the period between 2009 and 2010, over 20% of old people had probable symptoms of<lb/> depression compared to 7% of adults aged 64 and younger, with an even higher rate for people 75 and over<lb/> (25.3%) than for people between 65 and 74 (18.8%). In general, women (25.1%) are more likely to show<lb/> probable symptoms of depression than men (22.3%) (ISS, 2012b).<lb/> 48.<lb/> Depression is highly disabling among old people, as people with probable symptoms of<lb/> depression reported to have, in the 30 days preceding the survey, approximately 15 days with limited<lb/> activity against 3 days reported by individuals not suffering from any depressive symptoms. Two out of<lb/> three people sought help from the family or a doctor, whilst the remaining 33% did not. It is noteworthy<lb/> that social seclusion is a topic of paramount importance, especially across the eldest population. Almost<lb/> 9% of the people interviewed neither participate in any collective meeting nor have any kind of contact<lb/> with society (telephone call, meeting, etc.) during a &quot; normal week &quot; . As shown in the CNESPS-ISS,<lb/> women, people over age 75, individuals with a lower level of education and people with lower incomes<lb/> 2<lb/> CBCL is a questionnaire filled out by parents designed to assess social competence and behavioural<lb/> problems in children and adolescents aged 6-18.<lb/></p>

			<p>were more likely to be socially isolated, with subsequent concern for their health and mental health status<lb/> (ISS, 2012b).<lb/> 49.<lb/> The results of the Health Watch Report (Rapporto Osservasalute) showed that almost 30% of<lb/> people over age 65 were living alone in 2009, with women being significantly above the average (<ref type="biblio">Sabetta,<lb/> 2012</ref>) (see <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>). However, living alone does not necessarily mean being isolated, as it could also be a<lb/> sign of autonomy.<lb/></p>

In line with other OECD<lb/> countries, suicide rates are higher for men than for women (<ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<head>2.3. Other indicators<lb/></head>

			<p>52.<lb/> The Ministry of Health, through the Mental Health Information System (SISM), is working on<lb/> the development of national indicators for mental health, including clinical indicators. However, at the time<lb/> of writing clinical or outcome indicators for mental health do not exist at the national level (see<lb/> section 3.5.).<lb/></p>

POLICY AND GOVERNANCE<lb/> 3.1. Governance and organisation of the health system<lb/> 53.<lb/> The National Health Service (hereafter NHS) (Servizio Sanitario Nazionale – SSN), established<lb/> in 1978, provides universal coverage free of charge at the point of use to all Italian citizens. Under the<lb/> Italian Constitution, the organisation and administration of the health system in Italy is run at the national,<lb/> regional and local levels.<lb/> 54.<lb/> At the national level, the central government is responsible for providing framework legislation<lb/> that draws up general principles of organising, financing and monitoring the NHS. The Ministries involved<lb/> in the provision of health care are responsible for ensuring the general principles of the national health care<lb/> system. The central government is also responsible for setting the Essential Levels of Assistance (Livelli<lb/> Essenziali di Assistenza – LEA), a basic health care package that must be available to all residents<lb/> throughout the country (see section 3.5.).<lb/></figure>

			<p>55.<lb/> The Ministry of Health is the main central institution responsible for health care planning,<lb/> financing, and monitoring and for setting the healthcare regulatory framework. The Ministry of Health<lb/> currently oversees three major departments: 1) the Department for the Planning and Organisation of the<lb/> NHS, responsible for the planning of health policies dealing with the organisation of NHS services, which<lb/> is in charge of the administration of the Italian Information System (SIS), including the Mental Health<lb/> Information System (SISM), and for providing pharmaceuticals and medical devices; 2) the Department of<lb/> Public Health and Innovation, in charge of safeguarding health and well-being of all Italian citizens,<lb/> communicating with institutional and international bodies, and promoting scientific and technological<lb/> research; 3) the Department of Veterinary Care and Food Safety, with Italy being one of the few countries<lb/> in the world in which veterinary care is managed by the NHS (see <ref type="figure">Figure 8</ref>). However, the organisation of<lb/> the Ministry of Health is currently under revision.<lb/></p>

The Ministry of the Economy and Finance has a critical role in defining the<lb/> health care budget and subsequently allocating resources across regions. The Ministry of Social Affairs is<lb/> involved in the administration of social services provided within NHS infrastructures. The National Health<lb/> Council (Consiglio Superiore di Sanità), established in 1847 by the Edict of Carlo Alberto, provides<lb/> scientific and technical advice to the Ministry of Health. The Directorate General for the Coordination of<lb/> Mental Health Consulting Bodies (Direzione generale degli organi collegiali per la tutela della salute)<lb/> coordinates the work between the Ministry and other health care and scientific health bodies, including the<lb/> National Institute of Health (Istituto Superiore di Sanità</table>

			<p>– ISS) and the Italian Pharmaceutical Agency<lb/> (Agenzia Italiana del Farmaco – AIFA). The ISS, founded in 1934 and currently accountable to the<lb/> Ministry of Health, is the main national public institution conducting technical and scientific research in<lb/> the health field. The AIFA, founded in 2003 under the authority of the Ministry of Health and the Ministry<lb/> of the Economy and Finance, coordinates all activities related to pharmaceuticals, including public and<lb/> private research, production, distribution and monitoring, pricing and reimbursing policies.<lb/> 57.<lb/> The core of regulatory, planning, delivery and monitoring activity is, however, directly managed<lb/> at the regional level. The regions have gained prominence following the adoption of legislative Decree<lb/> No. 229/1999, which increased the legal power devolved to regional governments. In fact, under the<lb/> umbrella of national legislation, legislative functions are left under the control of regions, which provide<lb/> regulatory frameworks for financing, organising and monitoring the health sector. Regional governments<lb/> are responsible for delivering a health care benefits package through a network of Local Health Authorities<lb/> (Azienda Sanitaria Locale – ASL) as well as public and private licenced hospitals. Regional governments<lb/> directly set the resources to be allocated across the Local Health Authorities, define their geographical<lb/> boundaries and appoint general managers. Based on the National Health Plan and on local needs, the<lb/> regions are also responsible for designing a three-year health plan and monitoring activities on health care<lb/> delivery across the territory.<lb/></p>

			<figure>58.<lb/> A range of intermediary bodies are responsible for ensuring continuous connections between the<lb/> central Government and the regions.<lb/> 59.<lb/> The Standing Conference on the Relations between the State, the Regions and the Autonomous<lb/> Provinces (Conferenza Stato Regioni et Unificata), established in 1988, promotes collaboration between<lb/> the regions and the central government. Composed of the representatives of the government and the<lb/> presidents of the regions, the Standing Conference is the major consultative body for legislative activities<lb/> involving a regional dimension.<lb/> 60.<lb/> The National Agency for Regional Healthcare (Agenzia Nazionale per i Servizi Sanitari<lb/> Regionali – AGENAS) plays an important role in giving technical and operational support to the Ministry<lb/> of Health and the regions in the work to develop NHS strategies. Among other tasks, the AGENAS carries<lb/> out monitoring of the NHS, provides evaluative analysis of the efficacy of the LEAs and makes<lb/> recommendations for the organisation of the NHS.<lb/> 3.2. Governance and organisation of the mental health system<lb/> 61.<lb/> At the local level, each Local Health Authority integrates a Department of Mental Health (DMH),<lb/> which is in charge of mental health prevention, care and rehabilitation within defined catchment areas.<lb/> Special focus is devoted to crisis situations and rehabilitation, although the DMHs are in fact in charge of<lb/> the full array of mental health care provision.<lb/> 62.<lb/> The DMHs refer to a population of 150 000 inhabitants, as set in the Targeted Mental Health<lb/> Care Plan 1998-2000 (Ministry of Health, 1998a); in 2010, there were 208 DMHs in the whole Italian<lb/> territory (Ministry of Health<ref type="biblio">, 2011c</ref>). The DMHs embed multi-disciplinary teams composed of<lb/> psychiatrists, psychologists, nurses, social workers, educators, occupational therapists, personnel with<lb/> specific training therapists, personnel with specific training in psychosocial rehabilitation and secretarial<lb/> staff. National standards for mental health staff require at least one professional per every 1 500 inhabitants<lb/> (Ministry of <ref type="biblio">Health, 1998a</ref>), and although regional differences exist, these standards are met in almost<lb/> every Italian region. The DMHs manage a variety of inpatient and outpatient mental health services,<lb/> including Community Mental Health Centres (CMHCs), Day Care Facilities (DCF), General Hospital<lb/> Psychiatric Units (GHPUs), and Semi-residential and Residential Facilities (RFs) (see <ref type="figure">Figure 9</ref>). The<lb/> Director of the DMH is responsible for coordinating the activities performed by all services belonging to<lb/> the DMH&apos;s network.<lb/> • Community mental health centre – CMHCs (Centro di Salute Mentale – CSM). In charge of<lb/> planning and coordinating interventions, this service is accessible to patients, even without a<lb/> general practitioner&apos;s referral, at least 12 hours a day from Monday to Friday and half a day on<lb/> Saturday. The CMHC evaluates demand from patients and can thus direct them to appropriate<lb/> mental health services or provide direct intervention. It also arranges domiciliary visits and is<lb/> involved in consultation–liaison interventions at the local level (see section 4.1.).<lb/> • General Hospital Psychiatric Units (GHPUs) – Servizi Psichiatrici di Diagnosi Cura (SPDC).<lb/> Located in hospitals that have an emergency department, this service is in charge of short-term<lb/> crisis interventions and eventually refers patients to the CMHC for outpatient care and other<lb/> interventions. Patients are admitted either on a voluntary basis or under CTOs. National standards<lb/> require that a maximum of 1 bed per 10 000 inhabitants is provided (Ministry of <ref type="biblio">Health, 1998a</ref>),<lb/> and each GHPU provides a maximum of 16 psychiatric beds (for CTO rates, see section 1.2.i; for<lb/> further information on GHPUs, see section 4.1.).<lb/></p>

			<head>• Semi-residential facilities – Day-centres and Day hospitals (Centri Diurni e Day-Hospital).</head>

			<p>These<lb/> facilities have therapeutic and rehabilitative functions, with programmes promoting self-care,<lb/> everyday-life activities and individual or collective interpersonal relations in day centres. The day<lb/> centres are open at least eight hours a day six days a week and have their own medical team,<lb/> sometimes complemented by social workers and volunteers. Day centres can be managed either<lb/> by the Department of Mental Health or by private partners, in which case conventions with the<lb/> Department of Mental Health guarantee the continuity of care. The main goal of Day Hospitals is<lb/> to reduce the number and length of hospitalisations by providing comprehensive diagnostic<lb/> evaluations and health interventions in the short and medium term. Day Hospitals can be located<lb/> within the hospital or in external structures linked with the Department of Mental Health (see<lb/> section 4.1.).<lb/> • Residential facilities – RFs (Strutture residenziali). RFs are separate from hospital facilities and<lb/> are in charge of part of the therapeutic-rehabilitative programme for patients with strictly<lb/> psychiatric needs. These rehabilitative programmes are conceived to help people utilising local<lb/> resources in order to better integrate into the community. In this respect, residential facilities<lb/> must not constitute a long-term housing solution. By law, they must comprise a specific number<lb/> of beds linked to the intensity of care – but not more than 20 – and must be located in easily<lb/> accessible urban areas in order to avoid social isolation (see section 4.1.).<lb/> 63.<lb/> Together with the aforementioned mental health services provided through DMHs, there are<lb/> other mental health facilities that collaborate with the DMHs but are not directly dependent on them. These<lb/> include Psychiatric Clinics attached to universities (Cliniche Psichiatriche Universitarie) and psychiatric<lb/> wards in general hospitals, which both provide mental health inpatient services.<lb/></p>

The<lb/> IMHAP identifies four priority areas, including: early intervention, mild to moderate mental illness, severe<lb/> mental illness and children and adolescents mental health. In order to deal with these priorities<lb/> successfully, a set of strategies and a variety of relevant indicators has been developed. For each priority<lb/> area, the IMHAP identifies the key objectives to be achieved, the related actions to be undertaken, the<lb/> evaluation tools to be used, as well as a set of indicators for monitoring whether the objectives are being<lb/> met (Ministry of <ref type="biblio">Health, 2013</ref>).<lb/></p>

Besides the need to<lb/> develop a uniform provision of children&apos;s mental health services across the territory, there is also the need<lb/> for better integration of the services, especially between children&apos;s and adults&apos; mental health services.<lb/> Adult mental health priorities include: early interventions, mild to moderate and severe mental illnesses,<lb/> suicide prevention and the fight against stigma (Ministry of Health, 2013).<lb/></p>

			<head>3.4. Mental health strategic initiatives<lb/> Stigma campaign<lb/> National initiatives<lb/></head>

			<p>66.<lb/> The Italian Ministry of Health has conducted several anti-stigma campaigns in order to draw<lb/> attention to mental health care. The first one, in 2005, focused on the exclusion of people suffering from<lb/> mental illnesses and aimed at fighting stigma attached to mental illnesses with slogans such as &quot; He&apos;s not<lb/> different than you. Mental illness can be cured &quot; ( &quot; Non è diverso da te. Curare i disturbi mentali si può. &quot; )<lb/> and &quot; No prejudice, no exclusion &quot; ( &quot; Nessun pregiudizio, nessuna esclusione &quot; ), featured in a television spot.<lb/> Family/users associations played a major role in this first campaign, with each segment of the<lb/> communication programme being devolved to them under general supervision by the Italian Ministry of<lb/> Health: the television spot was managed by the UNASAM; the national day for mental health and several<lb/> other events around the country were hosted by the Idea foundation (Fondazione Idea); the informative<lb/> brochures were encharged to the Diapsigra association, and a website www.fuoridallombra.it was created<lb/> by the Arap association.<lb/> 67.<lb/> The second stigma campaign on mental health – &quot; Mental health disorders can be cured: more<lb/> information, less discrimination &quot; (I disturbi mentali si possono curare: più informazione meno<lb/> discriminazione) – was conducted on April 2006 with the aim of fighting discrimination against people<lb/> suffering from mental illness and informing the youth about mental health issues. In order to do this, the<lb/> campaign was managed jointly by the Italian Ministry of Health and the Italian Ministry of Education, as<lb/> well as by universities. The campaign&apos;s main objectives were to:<lb/></p>

			<figure>• Stimulate creativity by allowing students and university staff to participate in the making of the<lb/> campaign;<lb/> • Encourage interest about mental health in schools and in education programmes;<lb/> • Increase knowledge about and an understanding of mental illness and how it can be treated and<lb/> cured;<lb/> • Promote initiatives to improve behaviour towards mental illness;<lb/> • Promote specific actions in order to prevent and fight discrimination and prejudice in targeted<lb/> social groups.<lb/> 68.<lb/> The tools used to realise the 2006 campaign against stigma included the publication of an<lb/> informative brochure in the widely circulated newspaper La Repubblica and the distribution of the<lb/> campaign message across major websites specifically addressed to young people through internet banners.<lb/> 69.<lb/> Apart from national initiatives against stigma, the core stigma campaigns in Italy have taken<lb/> place at the regional and local levels. To quote but a few, The &quot; Regional Network of Mental Health Users<lb/> of Tuscany &quot; ( &quot; Rete Regionale Toscana Utenti Salute Mentale &quot; ) (for further information on the Regional<lb/> Network in the Toscana region, see section 3.6.), or Mental Health Week in Emilia Romagna, promoted by<lb/> the Local Health Authority of Reggio Emilia</figure>

			<p>in collaboration with the municipality of Reggio Emilia, is<lb/> now in its 7 th edition. During Mental Health Week, debates and lectures are organised and movies and<lb/> books on mental health are presented. The events are attended by &quot; sane &quot; individuals as well as people with<lb/> mental disorders who have an opportunity to share their experiences and participate in the public debate.<lb/></p>

			<figure>Box 3. Stories of recovery (Storie di guarigione)<lb/> The literary competition &quot; Stories of Recovery &quot; (Storie di Guarigione) has been organised in Biella (Piemonte<lb/> region) through the involvement of all the local institutions and the local groups active in the promotion of mental health<lb/> and well-being. Two outstanding artists in Italy (the poet Alda Merini – with a personal history of schizophrenia – and<lb/> Michelangelo Pistoletto – painter and sculptor) accepted to serve as Presidents of the Jury. The competition was<lb/> dedicated to Emanuele Lomonaco, head of the Mental Health Department in Biella, who promoted the competition and<lb/> died of heart failure during the early development phases of this initiative.<lb/></figure>

			<p>All the Community Mental Health Centres (CMHCs) in Italy, along with all the local groups already involved in<lb/> editing or publishing poems or tales written by users or ex-users, were invited to participate in the literary competition.<lb/> A web campaign was developed to promote the initiative. The organising committee received more than 550<lb/> contributions (poems, tales or autobiographies) from all Italian regions. The Jury selected nine winners, who were all<lb/> invited to the closing ceremony in the main theatre in Biella. All the winners received a financial reward and their<lb/> manuscripts were published in the book La scrittura della guarigione <ref type="biblio">[</ref>Writing the Recovery] (Storie di guarigione,<lb/> 2009).<lb/> Most of the funds raised to carry out the initiative came from local institutions and foundations. The estimated<lb/> direct cost (excluding personnel in the local institutions) of the initiative was EUR 35 000.<lb/></figure>

			<p>This initiative promoted the participation of all the family and user organisations in Italy, raised awareness on<lb/> recovery issues among mental health professionals, and gave a voice to mental health services users, offering them<lb/> an opportunity to write their personal stories. The initiative received formal acknowledgements by the President of the<lb/> Italian Republic, who awarded the programme with a silver medal for its high social value. Also, the Italian Ministry of<lb/> Health and Ministry of Culture as well as a variety of sectors within the regional administration in Piemonte formally<lb/> supported the initiative.<lb/></p>

			<head>Box 4. Stigma across medical professionals<lb/></head>

			<p>Stigma and discrimination towards individuals suffering from mental health problems is also present among<lb/> medical professionals (<ref type="biblio">Sartorius, 2002; Magliano et al., 2004</ref>). This is of particular importance, considering that mental<lb/> illness is often associated with cancer and cardiovascular and metabolic diseases (WFMH, 2010). Several authors<lb/> pointed out that the care needs of patients with mental illness are not always taken seriously. There is a general<lb/> tendency among medical professionals to associate patients&apos; physical complaint with their mental health problems, to<lb/> underestimate the severity of their symptoms and suspect that they are imaginary. When admitted to a hospital<lb/> department for a physical illness, these patients are treated with disrespect by professionals, wait longer for a<lb/> specialist consultation and are soon transferred to a psychiatric unit (<ref type="biblio">Aydin et al., 2003</ref>). This situation negatively<lb/> influences the quality and appropriateness of medical care provided to patients with mental disorders and makes it<lb/> more difficult for these patients to talk about their own physical problems with medical staff.<lb/> For the above-mentioned reasons, exploring beliefs about mental illness among medical professionals is<lb/> important in order to devise strategies for modifying prejudices and discriminating behaviours toward persons with<lb/> mental illness.<lb/> A study was conducted in 2010 in order to examine the beliefs of medical students about the causes of<lb/> schizophrenia and the possibility of treatment and recovery. The study was carried out during the period April-June<lb/> 2010 on 194 medical students attending the last two years (5th and 6th) of their training course at the Second<lb/> University of Naples and was supported by all the professors involved in lessons in the reference period. Attitudes<lb/> were assessed by using a validated questionnaire (<ref type="biblio">Magliano et al., 2011; Magliano et al., 2012</ref>).<lb/> The results showed that 159 students (82%) identified schizophrenia in the case-vignette. As for the causes of<lb/> the case-vignette disorder, the students most frequently cited heredity (81%), stress (69%), psychological trauma<lb/> (45%) and misuse of street drugs (44%). Heredity was considered the most important and the most frequent cause of<lb/> the case-vignette condition by 53% and 33% of the respondents, respectively. Only 24% of respondents firmly believed<lb/> that persons with the considered disorder could completely recover in the future. At the same time, 73% of<lb/> respondents said that it was completely or partially true that individuals with the case-vignette condition were<lb/> dangerous and 86% that they were unpredictable. Moreover, 57% firmly believed that people are frightened by<lb/> persons with this disorder and 56% stated that people don&apos;t know how to behave with them, nor understand the<lb/> difficulties experienced by these patients (<ref type="biblio">Magliano et al., 2011; Magliano et al., 2012</ref>).<lb/> These findings clearly suggest that stigma is present among the &quot; future doctors &quot; as it is in the general population.<lb/> As a consequence, tailored measures are currently being implemented in order to respond to this situation, i.e. &quot; ad-<lb/>hoc &quot; lessons on recovery and prejudices towards persons with mental disorders, especially schizophrenia, have been<lb/> planned, involving both medical students and professors from several physical and surgical disciplines; a participatory<lb/> research group of students from different medical disciplines has been created and trained to devise peer-to-peer<lb/> strategies to raise awareness among students about stigma in mental illness.<lb/></p>

			<figure>Box 5. C&apos;era una volta la città dei matti<lb/> &quot; C&apos;era una volta la città dei matti &quot; ( &quot; Once upon a time there was the town of fools &quot; ) is a movie directed by Marco<lb/> Turco, which was broadcast by the Italian national public broadcasting organisation (RAI) and watched by over<lb/> 7 million people. The movie is based on the true story of Franco Basaglia and his experience in two mental hospitals,<lb/> Gorizia and Trieste, where the process of closing all the mental hospitals in Italy began. The object of the movie is to<lb/> provide an overview of the changing approach towards mental illness that eventually led to the approval of Law 180 in<lb/> 1978.<lb/> The Department of Mental Health in Trieste consulted on the preparation of the script by defining the historical<lb/> context and assessing the scientific contents of the movie. The movie is currently available with English subtitles, and it<lb/> has already won 3 international Prizes (Shanghai, Monte Carlo and Rome Film Festivals) for its ability to address the<lb/> issues of stigma and prejudice.<lb/></figure>

			<p>The movie triggered a public debate on stigma, inclusion and the rights of people with mental illness, e.g. it has<lb/> been used by WHO Offices, Italian Institutes of Culture and other countries to promote the debate on de-<lb/>institutionalisation.<lb/></p>

			<head>Mental Health in the workplace<lb/></head>

			<figure>70.<lb/> Pro.P – Programme for the reintegration into the workplace of people suffering from mental<lb/> health disorders – was launched in 2006 with the aim of facilitating the integration of mentally disordered<lb/> people into the labour market. The programme was started by the ISFOL (Institute for the development of<lb/> Vocational Training – Istituto per lo sviluppo della formazione professionale dei lavoratori) and supported<lb/> by the Ministry of Labour and Social Policies. Since its establishment, the programme has implemented a<lb/> vast range of activities, including: the establishment of institutional networks within regions; training<lb/> programmes for operators within regional mental health facilities; integration plans for mentally disordered<lb/> people into the labour market; and the development of a comprehensive information system. Whilst some<lb/> regions – Lazio, Piemonte, Puglia, Toscana and Umbria – were part of the programme since its inception,<lb/> other regions have joined later, such as Veneto, Campania and Sardegna in 2010, Marche in 2011 and<lb/> Molise in 2012.<lb/></figure>

			<p>71.<lb/> However, it is worth saying that programmes aiming to include mental health disordered people<lb/> in the workplace are routinely performed by CMHCs, whilst Pro.P is only a research project aimed at<lb/> optimising and improving these activities.<lb/></p>

			<head>3.5. Monitoring and good practice guidelines in the health and mental health services<lb/></head>

			<p>72.<lb/> The current Italian mental health system is not so easy to fully evaluate and monitor, since<lb/> provision of care is presently delegated to regions and Local Health Authorities that operate in an<lb/> autonomous way under national &quot; framework legislation &quot; . Nevertheless, in recent years, monitoring has<lb/> been reaffirmed as a crucial objective by the Italian Ministry of Health.<lb/></p>

			<head>Information systems and registers<lb/> 73.<lb/> The Targeted Mental Health Care Plan 1998-2000 required that each Department of Mental<lb/></head>

			<p>Health (DMH) in Italy provides an information system to gather data on mental health prevalence and the<lb/> services provided (Ministry of <ref type="biblio">Health, 1998a</ref>). The 1999 Decree (D. L. 229/99) also required that regions<lb/> have health information systems.<lb/> 74.<lb/> A thorough information system was recently developed to improve the monitoring of health<lb/> services in Italy: in this respect, the National Health Information System (Sistema Informativo Sanitario -<lb/>SIS) developed by the Ministry of Health is currently in charge of collecting aggregated data and<lb/> information on services on a yearly basis. An additional recent promising tool for monitoring mental health<lb/> services is the National Mental Health Information System (Sistema Informativo Salute Mentale -SISM),<lb/> which is based on individual user&apos;s records. The SISM has been officially approved through a National<lb/> Decree in October 2010 and is being implemented in all Italian regions, some of which already have prior<lb/> experience of gathering aggregated information concerning mental health. The SISM is designed primarily<lb/> to guarantee the Essential Levels of Assistance and provides information on services, personnel and some<lb/> characteristics of clients and treatments. Moreover, the SISM is moving towards the establishment of a set<lb/> of national mental health indicators, including clinical indicators.<lb/> 75.<lb/> However, at the time of writing there are different stages of development of regional mental<lb/> health information systems, with information systems in some regions – such as Piemonte, Lombardia,<lb/> Lazio, Emilia-Romagna and Toscana – being relatively more developed than other regions. For instance, in<lb/> some southern regions, not all DMHs provide a mental health information system, as set by the current<lb/> legislation. Because the development of a mental health information system is not expensive per se, the<lb/> obstacles to implementation should be sought in the differing cultural environments across regions rather<lb/> than in the existence of economic constraints.<lb/></p>

			<head>Outcomes and indicators<lb/></head>

			<p>76.<lb/> Given that there are different stages of development of regional mental health information<lb/> systems, and that some regions are unable to provide good mental health data, there are currently not many<lb/> mental health indicators available at the national level, whilst mental health indicators at a regional and<lb/> local level are more available (see Box 6).<lb/> 77.<lb/> Some information on the prevalence of mental ill health as well as the performance of mental<lb/> health facilities at the national level is being provided by studies conducted by the National Institute of<lb/> <ref type="biblio">Health (ISS, 2012a; ISS, 2012b; ISS, 2012c</ref>), the National Centre for Prevention and Control of Diseases<lb/> (<ref type="biblio">CCM, 2011</ref>) and other international studies, e.g. the EseMED study (<ref type="biblio">De Girolamo et al., 2006a</ref>).<lb/> Moreover, Italy has experience of routine outcome measurements that have used the Health of the Nation<lb/> Outcome Scales (HoNOS) at the national level, involving about twenty DMHs in Italy, e.g. in the<lb/> Lombardy region, Tuscany, Liguria and Lazio. The results of the last two studies, <ref type="biblio">covering 2009-2010 and<lb/> 2010-2011, will</ref> be published in the near future.<lb/> 78.<lb/> In recent years, regional efforts have been undertaken to obviate the dearth of mental health<lb/> indicators at the national level. Regions such as Piemonte, Lombardia, Lazio, Emilia-Romagna and<lb/> Toscana, which are endowed with a qualitative mental health information system, have been able to<lb/> provide evidence-based reports on the state of mental health in the population and on the quality of<lb/> services provided (<ref type="biblio">Tibaldi et al., 2008; Gaddini et al., 2008; Lora, 2006; Bignami et al., 2008; Lora &amp;<lb/> Monzani, 2013</ref>). Some regions have developed a set of clinical indicators for mental health. For instance,<lb/> the Italian Society of Psychiatric Epidemiology (Società Italiana di Epidemiologia Psichiatrica – SIEP),<lb/> has developed a set of clinical indicators for schizophrenia, depression and bipolar disorders in the<lb/> Lombardy region. The indicators were defined based on available data from a vast range of information<lb/> systems in Lombardy, including pharmaceutical indicators, the general health care system and the<lb/> psychiatric information system (<ref type="biblio">Lora &amp; Monzani, 2013</ref>). The Lombardy region has relatively more<lb/> sophisticated information systems than other Italian regions, so while other regions may not yet be in a<lb/> position to replicate this study, it is hoped that the presentation of the results will at least provide an<lb/> impetus for them to do so in the not too distant future.<lb/></p>

			<head>Essential Levels of Assistance (Livelli Essenziali di Assistenza – LEA)<lb/></head>

			<table>79.<lb/> Following the release of the Prime Ministerial Decree of 29 November 2001 (Decreto del<lb/> Presidente del Consiglio dei Ministri), the Government established Essential Levels of Assistance (Livelli<lb/> Essenziali di Assistenza – LEA), defined as services and facilities</table>

			<p>that the NHS is responsible for ensuring,<lb/> free or with users&apos; co-payments, to all Italian citizens.<lb/> 80.<lb/> The implementation of LEAs has led to the reinforcement of a &quot; target culture &quot; and the setting of<lb/> health-related performance indicators in Italy. Monitoring the levels of assistance reflects the performance<lb/> of all health care providers regarding the quality, appropriateness and cost-effectiveness of care. In 2008,<lb/> further legislation redefined the LEAs, which now include over 5 700 types of public health services for<lb/> prevention, treatment and rehabilitation. Chapter IV, Art. 25, 26, 32 of the LEAs directly refers to mental<lb/> health. Particular focus is given to mental health community-based services and to children&apos;s and<lb/> adolescents&apos; mental health care.<lb/> 81.<lb/> Besides their standard-setting functions, LEAs are also a monitoring tool that is used both to<lb/> measure the performance of the health services and to efficiently allocate resources across regions. The<lb/> Standing Conference between State and Regions of March 2005 gave powers to the LEA Committee to<lb/> verify whether the regions are complying with their obligations to deliver the Essential Levels of<lb/> Assistance (LEAs) to their inhabitants. In order to do this, the LEA Committee developed the &quot; LEAs grid &quot; ,<lb/> a set of indicators that assign a score to each of the LEAs delivered across regions. For each indicator, an<lb/> optimal and a minimal value is set, and the more the value moves away from the optimal value, the lower<lb/> the score given to the service. The LEAs grid allows decision-makers to make comparisons between<lb/> regions by giving a broad picture of the strengths and weaknesses of each region in delivering the LEAs.<lb/> 82.<lb/> The last evaluation of LEAs was released in 2012 (Ministry of <ref type="biblio">Health, 2012a</ref>), with indicators<lb/> based on data collected in 2010. At the time of writing there is only one indicator designed to capture the<lb/> delivery of LEAs for mental health, although the set of indicators is revised annually and might change in<lb/> the near future. The mental health indicator is designed to capture the activities of the CMHCs and is<lb/> defined as &quot; the number of patients per 100 000 population taken over by Community Mental Health<lb/> Centres &quot; . The optimal level includes values equal or superior to 1 000, whilst values equal or inferior to<lb/> 500 are deemed inadequate (see <ref type="figure">Figure 10</ref>). With this design, however, the mental health indicator is<lb/> unlikely to describe the quantity or the quality of mental health services provision, in that it does not take<lb/> into consideration epidemiological and demographic differences across regions and does not give any<lb/> indication about the quality of the services provided and the clinical results achieved.<lb/></p>

South Verona Community Psychiatric Service (CSP)<lb/> The South Verona Community Psychiatric Service (CSP) was first established in 1978 by the Department of<lb/> Psychiatry (DoP) of the University of Verona. Since 1987, the DoP of Verona and the CSP of South Verona have<lb/> functioned as the Collaborating Centre for Research and Training in Mental Health of the WHO.<lb/></figure>

			<p>In the 30 years since its establishment, the CSP has been providing a comprehensive range of services,<lb/> including a Community Mental Health Centre, a psychiatric ward located in the Academic general hospital, today with<lb/> 15 beds, an outpatient service, an emergency service, home visits and the Service of Psychosomatics and Clinical<lb/> Psychology and the Service of Psychotherapy (an outpatient and a home service, respectively). The CSP of South<lb/> Verona is totally funded and run by the NHS.<lb/> Starting as a long-term research project for monitoring and evaluating the new system of care established after<lb/> the implementation of Law 180, the CSP managed to couple innovative psychiatric care with scientific research and<lb/> academic education. One of the major peculiarities of the academic community-based mental health service is the<lb/> paramount importance given to monitoring and evaluation, making the CSP of South Verona one of the most<lb/> intensively evaluated mental health services in the world. The CSP also represents the major centre for psychiatric<lb/> research in Italy, including research on epidemiological and social psychiatry, economics and geography of mental<lb/> health studies, genetics and neuroimaging of schizophrenic and bipolar disorders, clinical psychopharmacology,<lb/> communication in medicine and evaluation of mental health services. The CPS has conducted a large number of<lb/> research studies, including work on the following areas:<lb/></p>

			<head>•</head>

			<figure>Service costs associated with clinical, social and service history variables;<lb/> • The effects of ssocioeconomic status (SES), accessibility and geographic distance from mental health<lb/> services on the use of community-based psychiatric services;<lb/> • Predictions about patient drop-out from mental health care;<lb/> • Differences in the mortality of psychiatric patients between areas with a community-based system and the<lb/> general population;<lb/> • The South Verona Outcome Project (SVOP) – an outcome evaluation of mental health care provided by the<lb/> South Verona CSP;<lb/> • Predictions of clinical and social outcomes of patients in touch with community-based services;<lb/> • Predictions of the changing needs of psychiatric care;<lb/> 0<lb/> 1000<lb/> 2000<lb/> 3000<lb/> 2008<lb/> 2009<lb/> 2010<lb/> optimal level<lb/> unacceptable level<lb/> • The relationship between satisfaction with psychiatric care [measured through the Verona service<lb/> satisfaction scale (VSSS)] and a number of mental health indicators (including socio-demographic, clinical<lb/> and service intervention indicators).<lb/></figure>

			<p>After the adoption of Law 180, the CSP of South Verona experienced a shift from institutionalisation towards<lb/> community-based mental health services. From 1979 to 2007, data show that hospital inpatient health care has<lb/> dramatically decreased in favour of increasing outpatient and community care, home visits, number of day care<lb/> contacts, attendance at the day hospital and number of days in sheltered accommodation run by the CPS (see<lb/> <ref type="figure">Figure 11</ref>). In fact, from 1977 to 2007, there was a decrease of 6% in inpatient admissions, with a 69% fall in<lb/> compulsory admissions. The mean number of occupied beds fell significantly to 72%, mainly due to the closure of state<lb/> mental health hospitals (<ref type="biblio">Amaddeo et al., 2009</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<head>National Guidelines for Mental Health (Linee Guida per la Salute Mentale) (2008)<lb/></head>

			<p>88.<lb/> The 2008 National Guidelines for Mental Health reaffirmed the necessity to enforce the effective<lb/> integration of people suffering from mental illness into the employment market through the concerted<lb/> action of all Departments of Mental Health. DMHs should in this respect be in charge of ongoing<lb/> professional training, assistance in the search and obtaining of a job opportunity, promotion of social firms<lb/> and social cooperatives as well as innovative social projects involving e.g. microcredit (Ministry of Health,<lb/> 2008b).<lb/></p>

			<head>3.6. User involvement: consumer associations, family associations and other NGOs<lb/></head>

			<p>90.<lb/> National legislation highlights the importance of citizens&apos; involvement in the decision-making<lb/> process and promotes the establishment of consumer and family associations. The 1978 law establishing<lb/> the NHS, for instance, promoted community involvement in the decision-making process. At the regional<lb/> level, Local Health Authorities have established a complaint system for citizens to make complaints and<lb/> suggestions and thus to participate in improving the health system. Following legislation in 1995, all public<lb/> and most private health care providers are obliged to release an annual Health Service Chart (Carta dei<lb/> Servizi), which is designed to inform the public about waiting times, complaint systems and quality<lb/> indicators. In addition, in 2003 further legislation required that all public administration institutions,<lb/> including health care institutions, establish an Office for Public Relations (Ufficio Relazioni con il<lb/> Pubblico (URP)) to provide information to the public and monitoring the quality of services from the<lb/> users&apos; point of view. Although national legislation has highlighted the importance of citizens&apos; involvement<lb/> in the decision-making process and encouraged the establishment of consumer associations, each region<lb/> has reacted differently to these directives (<ref type="biblio">Lo Scalzo et al., 2009</ref>).<lb/> 91.<lb/> With respect to mental health, human rights for people suffering from mental disorders were a<lb/> central issue addressed by Law 180, as previous legislation had implied that a person committed to an<lb/> asylum would automatically have their civil and political rights suspended and could be permanently<lb/> committed against their will without judicial consent and generally not allowed to leave the mental<lb/> hospital. However, there is currently no public body in Italy, whether national or regional, in charge of<lb/> monitoring and assessing the human rights protection of patients in mental health services. This task has<lb/> been progressively devolved to patient and family associations, which have in fact always collaborated<lb/> with the Italian Ministry of Health. 5<lb/> 92.<lb/> Italy has several national and regional user/consumer and family associations spread out across<lb/> the country. Some of them have been active since the 1960s, although most started to become more<lb/> involved in the 1980s, after Law 180 was promoted. Over 150 of these associations have gathered since<lb/> 1993 under the umbrella of the Italian National Union of Associations for Mental Health (Unione<lb/> Nazionale delle Associazioni per la Salute Mentale, UNASAM), which now stands as the main<lb/> association/federation of families concerned with mental health issues. The UNASAM aims to promote<lb/> and defend the rights of mentally ill people by getting involved in policy-making and the<lb/> legislative/regulation process on the local, regional and national levels. The federation was in fact actively<lb/> involved in developing the two National Plans for Mental Health and contributed to the organisation of the<lb/></p>

Another goal</table>

			<p>of the association is to connect the<lb/> families of people suffering from mental disorders and get them involved in regular events hosted by the<lb/> association in collaboration with the mental health services. It also works to eliminate prejudice and stigma<lb/> about mental illness by informing the general public (<ref type="biblio">Muggia, 2009</ref>) through active participation in broad<lb/> communication campaigns, as with the Ministry of Health campaign on mental health in 2005. One of the<lb/> main points made by the UNASAM in its 2010 address is that involuntary admissions, when they are<lb/> accompanied by excessive restraint and a &quot; closed-doors &quot; policy, constitute an infringement of a patient&apos;s<lb/> human rights, especially when these measures are met with accidental death as has been reported in<lb/> Sardegna, Puglia, <ref type="biblio">Campania</ref> and Emilia-Romagna 6 in recent years. In addition to being present in all 20<lb/> Italian regions, the UNASAM is also on the board of international associations such as the European<lb/> Association of Families of Mentally Ill People (EUFAMI) and the World Association for Psychosocial<lb/> Rehabilitation (WAPR) (Muggia, 2009).<lb/> 93.<lb/> In addition to collaborating with the associations, the Italian Ministry of Health has also worked<lb/> in close interaction with the Council of Europe in order to issue the Council&apos;s recommendations 7 for the<lb/> protection of the human rights and dignity of people with mental disorders (adopted by the Committee of<lb/> Ministers on 22 September 2004 at the 896 th meeting of the Ministers&apos; deputies).<lb/> 94.<lb/> Associations of users/consumers are also developing in several regions. Among them, the<lb/> &quot; Regional Network of Mental Health Users of Tuscany &quot; (Rete Regionale Toscana Utenti Salute Mentale)<lb/> (hereafter the Regional Network) stands, since its establishment in 2006, as one of the most active<lb/> associations on mental health issues, including patients&apos; rights and the social exclusion of people suffering<lb/> from mental disorders (the link to the website is http://www.retetoscanausm.org/sito/).<lb/> 95.<lb/> All activities undertaken by the Regional network have been developed in the different Provinces<lb/> of the region, with the general aim of creating a network of support and exchanges among patients. The<lb/> Regional Network is part of the Regional and National Councils and as such takes part in the definition of<lb/> strategies and policies at both the regional and national levels.<lb/></figure>

			<p>96.<lb/> So far the Regional Network&apos;s programme has led to a structured activity aimed at combating<lb/> stigma by helping the population to recognise the dignity of persons with mental problems. The promotion<lb/> of rights and citizenship has been pursued by favouring the search for jobs (patient cooperatives are now<lb/> active in the labour market), by supporting housing (many independent group-apartments have been<lb/> created) and by advocating patients&apos; right to an education and to create their own families. The experience<lb/> is being repeated in other Italian regions (i.e. Liguria), and some projects are moving towards a European<lb/> dimension (i.e. the sports programme in Livorno has started to set up a European network).<lb/></p>

			<head>6<lb/></head>

			<p>In this respect, the case of Franco Mastrogiovanni (which received significant media coverage), a Sicilian<lb/> teacher who died in a psychiatric inpatient ward after being constrained for 4 days in August 2009, is<lb/> especially emblematic of the human rights issues raised by the UNASAM.<lb/></p>

			<head>4. ORGANISATION AND DELIVERY OF SERVICES<lb/></head>

			<p>97.<lb/> The level of use of mental health services by people with mental disorders is relatively low in<lb/> Italy. According to <ref type="biblio">Wang et al. (2007)</ref>, half of the people suffering from a severe mental illness, a quarter<lb/> of those suffering from moderate disorders and a fifth of those with mild disorders used the health services.<lb/> 98.<lb/> Another study conducted in three Italian regions (Friuli Venezia Giulia, Emilia Romagna and<lb/> Lombardia) showed that the estimated treatment gap – the percentage of people needing treatment but not<lb/> receiving it – accounted for 79% for mood disorders, whilst a lower rate (57%) was recorded for<lb/> schizophrenia (Lora, 2009).<lb/></p>

			<head>4.1. Adult mental health<lb/> Primary care<lb/> General Practitioners (GPs)<lb/></head>

			<p>99.<lb/> Primary care in Italy is of paramount importance for mental health care, especially for the<lb/> treatment of patients with mild to moderate mental health problems. Usually General Practitioners directly<lb/> treat symptoms of depression and anxiety, whilst patients with severe mental health disorders are generally<lb/> treated by secondary care. Unlike in other health care systems, in Italy GPs do not act as gatekeepers to<lb/> secondary care, as there is open access to all levels of care (primary, secondary and tertiary care) (WHO,<lb/> 2011). For instance, Community Mental Health Centres, which represent the core of intervention planning<lb/> in the Department of Mental Health, are freely accessible to patients without the necessity of being referred<lb/> first. It was found in the WHO ESEMeD study (<ref type="biblio">2001-2002</ref>) that 38% of the people who have had contact<lb/> with the NHS for mild to moderate mental health symptoms consulted their GP, while 21% consulted a<lb/> psychiatrist, 6% consulted a psychologist and 28% consulted a GP and a mental health professional jointly<lb/> (<ref type="biblio">De Girolamo et al., 2006a</ref>). These figures give evidence of the importance of GPs in treating mental<lb/> illness, as over half of contacts about mental issues were made with a GP. This in part results from the fact<lb/> that current legislation in Italy allows GPs to prescribe psychotherapeutic medicines (WHO, 2011). Italy is<lb/> among the OECD countries with the lowest rates of <ref type="biblio">GPs</ref> per population: in 2011, there were 45 878<lb/> General Practitioners, i.e. 0.76 per 100 000 population. This figure has decreased slightly over the last 15<lb/> years, as there were 47 157 GPs in 1995 (0.83 rate per 100 000 population) (OECD health database 2013).<lb/></figure>

			<p>100.<lb/> Recently, Law 189/2012, approved on 8 November 2012, set out &quot; urgent measures to promote<lb/> the development of the country through a better health care system &quot; . The Law defines precise guidelines<lb/> on the work of GPs and their relations with secondary care services. Italian GPs do not work in group<lb/> practices or in looser networks, but generally practice individually. However, the importance of integration<lb/> between the general practitioner and mental health services was acknowledged in Italy with the<lb/> implementation of several pilot experiments, leading to the adoption of a primary care consultation-liaison<lb/> model in 1999 that was first tested in the city of Bologna (<ref type="biblio">Emilia</ref>-Romagna) (see Box 7).<lb/> Box 7. Mental health and primary care: the &quot; Leggieri &quot; programme – Emilia Romagna<lb/></figure>

			<p>The programme &quot; G. Leggieri &quot; was first implemented in a Community Mental Health Centre (CMHC) in Bologna<lb/> (Emilia Romagna) in 1999, and in 2002 the service was implemented in the metropolitan area. The model aims<lb/> primarily at building cooperation between GPs and a dedicated team of consultant psychiatrists, resident psychiatrists,<lb/> psychologists and nurses; improving the quality of treatment of all mental health problems; and modifying the pathways<lb/> of care, by treating mild to moderate mental health problems in primary care and severe mental health problems in<lb/> secondary care.<lb/></p>

			<p>The consultation-liaison system was designed as a &quot; go-between &quot; for general practitioners and mental health<lb/> services and often takes place in CMHCs. According to the &quot; stepped care &quot; model adopted by the Leggieri programme,<lb/> three different approaches could be implemented, depending on the severity of the case. Individuals with mild mental<lb/> health problems are directly treated by GPs. People with moderate mental health problems are treated by GPs in<lb/> conjunction with the support of CMHCs, which provide either a simple consultation or suggest a treatment. People with<lb/> severe mental illness are treated by CMHCs, and there is a follow-up consultation with patients by GPs after the<lb/> treatment is finished (<ref type="biblio">Menchetti et al., 2006</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<figure>In order to monitor the outcomes of the programme on Local Health Authorities in the Emilia-Romagna region, a<lb/> questionnaire is regularly submitted to all Local Health Authorities across the region. The latest results show that the<lb/> number of GPs in contact with CMHCs has increased steadily from 2009 to 2011 by 16% (Regione Emilia-Romagna,<lb/> 2012).<lb/></figure>

			<head>Secondary care<lb/></head>

			<p>101.<lb/> Secondary care in Italy is of crucial importance for the treatment of people suffering from some<lb/> kind of mental disorder, especially severe mental health problems. Individuals can access secondary care<lb/> (both inpatient and outpatient) services without a referral from a GP. Since the approval of Law 180,<lb/> inpatient mental health services have been gradually replaced by outpatient mental health facilities, in line<lb/> with the decade-long process of de-institutionalisation and the closure of all mental hospitals.<lb/> 102.<lb/> Following the closure of all mental hospitals in Italy, the core of inpatient mental health services<lb/> is currently provided by residential facilities, psychiatric wards in general hospitals, Psychiatric Clinics<lb/> attached to universities (Cliniche Psichiatriche Universitarie) and General Hospital Psychiatric Units.<lb/> Among outpatient facilities there are Community Mental Health Centres and Semi-residential facilities.<lb/></p>

			<head>Outpatient care<lb/> Community Mental Health Centre (CMHCs) – Centro di Salute Mentale (CSM)<lb/></head>

			<p>103.<lb/> Community Mental Health Centres (CMHCs) represent the core of outpatient interventions and<lb/> are primarily responsible for planning and coordination.</p>

			<figure>In 2009, there were 1 387 CMHCs in Italy, a rate<lb/> of 4.17 per 150 000 population (over 18) (Ministry of Health, 2011c). However the variability from one<lb/> region to another is sometimes very significant (for instance, Valle d&apos;Aosta has 11.27 CMHCs per 150 000<lb/> population, whereas Molise has only 1.11 per 150 000 population) (see Table 3).<lb/> 104.<lb/> During the years 2005-2006, a national survey including 20 of 21 regions (except Molise) and<lb/> covering 211 Departments of Mental Health and 707 CMHCs (about 95% of existing CMHCs) was<lb/> conducted with the aim of evaluating the compliance of CMHCs with the national standards set within the<lb/> Targeted Mental Health Care Plan 1998-2000 (<ref type="biblio">Gonella et al., 2008; Munizza et al., 2011; Ministry of<lb/> Health, 1998a</ref>).</p>

			<figure>The 2005-2006 PROG-CSM survey found that the proportion of female users in CMHCs<lb/> amounted to 57% in the considered sample. Diagnoses of users of CMHCs included: psychotic disorders<lb/> such as schizophrenic disorders (about 29% of sample), mood disorders (25% of sample), anxiety disorders<lb/> (22.5% of sample) and other disorders (23.5%). For the new cases treated by CMHCs: psychotic disorders<lb/> amounted to 14% of the sample, mood disorders 20%, and anxiety disorders and other disorders were each<lb/> about 26%. 25% of treatments, such as home visits and intervention in the community, took place outside<lb/> the CMHCs.<lb/></figure>

			<p>105.<lb/> Contacts with CMHCs (especially integration and care continuity) and with other Department of<lb/> Mental Health services were satisfactory for about 69% of the facilities, while they were considered<lb/> inadequate in about 10% of CMHCs. With respect to follow-up community care, the study showed that<lb/> about 37% of the CMHCs in the considered sample were involved in developing high-quality programmes<lb/> focusing on continuity and care coordination for severe mental disorders. Tthese programmes included, for<lb/> instance, intensive home care and drop-out prevention programmes. However, promotion and prevention<lb/> programmes remained quite absent from most CMHCs, as only 18% had developed such programmes to a<lb/> satisfactory level (<ref type="biblio">Gonella et al., 2008</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<head>Inpatient care<lb/></head>

			<p>108.<lb/> Overall, inpatient mental health activities have decreased over the past decade, in line with the<lb/> parallel increase in outpatient mental health services. Within inpatient mental health care, the number of<lb/> public psychiatric beds has dropped steadily since 1975, along with the number of admissions and the<lb/> average length of stay for all diagnosis groups. The situation of Residential Facilities (RFs) is significantly<lb/> different. The number of RFs and RF psychiatric beds has increased over time, parallel to a decrease in<lb/> assistance days per user, with subsequent concern about the quality of mental health care being delivered<lb/> within these facilities. Moreover, the average length of stay is particularly high in RFs, which too often<lb/> provide assistance with daily activities rather than therapeutic support.<lb/></p>

			<figure>117.<lb/> In 2000, a broad national survey – the PROGRES study – conducted by the Italian National<lb/> Institute of Health (ISS) investigated the network of RFs in Italy. During phase 2 of the study, data was<lb/> gathered on 267 facilities accommodating 3 005 patients in 20 out of 21 regions (except Molise).<lb/> According to the second phase, 36.8% of patients residing at the time in the sample RFs were female<lb/> (<ref type="biblio">Munizza et al., 2011</ref>).<lb/> 118.<lb/> RFs accommodate patients mostly for long-term stays: 35% of patients residing in RFs were<lb/> there for the past 3 years or more and 75% had no formal limitation on the length of their stay. Resident<lb/> turnover is particularly low, with few new admissions and fewer discharges (on the sample considered for<lb/> phase 2, 25% of RFs hadn&apos;t discharged any patient in 2000 and 25% discharged only 1 to 2 patients in<lb/> 2000) (<ref type="biblio">Munizza et al., 2011</ref>). As a result, for many chronic patients RFs represent a permanent home<lb/> ( &quot; home for life &quot; ) instead of a temporary housing solution. This feature sometimes makes it difficult to<lb/> assess the transition from old-style mental institutions to residential mental health facilities, although there<lb/> has been substantial change in the background culture, the reduced number of patients and the type of care<lb/> provided.<lb/></p>

			<head>Complementary/alternative/traditional practitioners<lb/></head>

			<p>119.<lb/> Most of the complementary/alternative/traditional practitioners contacted by people suffering<lb/> from a mental illness in Italy are religious officials. Religion, a traditional source of relief from pain and<lb/> distress, is an important feature in the lives of many Italians, fewer than 15% of whom declare being<lb/> agnostic or atheist (ARDA, 2013). Italy appears to be the most religious country in the WHO ESEMeD<lb/> study, with religious advisors being the most involved in providing help for mental health issues. The use<lb/> of religious advisors indicates both the preeminent role of religion in Italy and a certain reluctance to label<lb/> one&apos;s issues as mental problems. According to the ESEMeD study, during the year preceding the survey<lb/> 0.4% of respondents had contacted a religious advisor to help with psychological distress (this figure is<lb/> equal to that of France and Belgium). Among people seeking help with a mental health problem, 3.6%<lb/> addressed religious advisers exclusively, while 5.5% used both religious and formal help (<ref type="biblio">De Girolamo et<lb/> al., 2006a</ref>).<lb/> 120.<lb/> For a practical example of the organisation of the adult mental health system, see Box 8.<lb/></p>

			<figure>Box 8. Organisation of mental health services in the city of Trieste<lb/> The organisation of psychiatric services in the city of Trieste (201 814 inhabitants) has beentransformed since<lb/> 1971, following the activities of Franco Basaglia and his team and resulted in the closure of the San Giovanni<lb/> psychiatric hospital in 1980 along with the setting up of a network of community-based services. This model of<lb/> community-based mental health services has been implemented acrossthe whole Region Friuli Venezia Giulia (1 217<lb/> 864 population) as a regional model, focussed on &quot; strong &quot; comprehensive 24 hour Community Mental Health Centres,<lb/> equippedto respondto the most severe conditions and psychiatric episodes and to support clients in their ordinary life in<lb/> a view of recovery and social inclusion. Recognised as an experimental pilot area of mental health de-<lb/>institutionalisation by the WHO in 1974 (Babini, 2009), considered as an example of proven success in 2001 (WHO,<lb/> 2001), the DMH of Trieste has been first appointed Collaborating Centre by the WHO in 1987 and most recently it was<lb/> designated the WHO Lead Collaborating Centre for Service Development in the framework of WHO-Euro Helsinki<lb/> Declaration and Action Plan in 2005 (<ref type="biblio">Rosen et al., 2012</ref>).<lb/> Currently the Department of Mental Health (DMH) in Trieste manages four Community Mental Health Centres<lb/> (CMHCs) – open 24 hours/7 days a week and provided with 4-8 beds each – each competent for a catchment area of<lb/> approximately 60 000 inhabitant. Started with the aim of reducing psychiatric hospital admissions and promoting<lb/> rehabilitation and social re-integration, the four CMHCs provide the core of mental health services in Trieste. The<lb/> General Hospital Psychiatric Unit (GHPU) provides inpatient mental health services, but its 6 beds are mainly used as a<lb/> filter for emergency situations at night, and normally do not admit patients for more than 24 hours. Instead, patients are<lb/> referred to the CMHC of the area where they live or to other appropriate services as soon as possible. In addition to the<lb/> four CMHCs and the GHPU, the DMH also includes a rehabilitation and residential support service, where there are<lb/> about 45 beds in group-homes and supported housing schemes whose main aim is to encourage users to move from<lb/> living together towards an individual home with the required daily support. In addition, there is a network of 15 social<lb/> cooperatives and also associations encompassing carers and users as well as other lay people involved.<lb/> Available indicators suggest that Trieste is delivering effective care that contributes to good patient outcomes.<lb/> Compulsory Treatment Orders (CTOs) discharge rates in the Region Friuli Venezia Giulia are one of the lowest in Italy,<lb/> with 5 cases per 100 000 population per year compared to a national average of 17 (see <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>) (Ministry of Health,<lb/> 2011b). Moreover, two thirds of people under the CTOs were treated within CMHCs rather than in inpatient facilities in<lb/> 2005 in Trieste (<ref type="biblio">Mezzina &amp; Johnsons, 2008</ref>). Suicide rates have decreased from 25 to 11 per 100 000 in the city of<lb/> Trieste over the last 15 years, possibly as a result of a proactive preventionprogramme (<ref type="biblio">Dell&apos;Acqua et al, 2003</ref>).Mental<lb/> health services in Trieste do not make use of restraint measures, such as locked doors and mechanical restraint<lb/> (<ref type="biblio">Rosen et al., 2012; De Girolamo, et al 2007</ref>).<lb/> 160 clients per year receive a personal budget in order to fulfil the aims of a joint and shared plan of recovery in<lb/> the areas of housing, work and social relationships. This represented about 18% of the overall budget of the DMH in<lb/> 2011, while about 4% is devoted to economic aid, training grants, leisure and projects with NGOs (extra-clinical<lb/> activities) (see <ref type="table">Table 6</ref>). About 180 people are in professional training every year on work grants, and 20-25 of these<lb/> find paid employments each year in the Trieste job market, many in the field of social cooperation and about a third in<lb/> private firms. The remaining budget was spent on personnel (about 55%), health budget (more than 17%) and<lb/> pharmaceuticals (almost 6% of total expenditures) in 2011 (Mezzina R., in Fioritti &amp; Amaddeo, forthcoming).<lb/></p>

			<head>4.2 Children and adolescent mental health<lb/></head>

			<p>121.<lb/> Infant Neuropsychiatry Services (Servizi di Neuropsichiatria Infantile) are today the core of<lb/> young people&apos;s mental health care in Italy, although these facilities are reported to have significant<lb/> limitations in terms of management, finance and human resources. According to the Targeted Mental<lb/> Health Care Plan 1998-2000, the Departments of Mental Health (DMHs) should also integrate the care of<lb/> child/adolescent mental health in the Infant Neuropsychiatry Services (Ministry of <ref type="biblio">Health, 1998a</ref>).<lb/> However, not all Local Health Authorities have put their DMHs in charge of child/adolescent mental<lb/> health, and some have devolved this mission to maternal/infant care departments and others have yet to<lb/> present a comprehensive plan for taking care of child and adolescent mental health.<lb/></p>

			<head>122.<lb/> In 2007, the Italian Child and Adolescent Neuropsychiatry Association (Società Italiana di<lb/> Neuropsichiatria dell&apos;Infanzia e dell&apos;Adolescenza</head>

			<p>– SINPIA) ran a national survey in all Italian regions to<lb/> gauge the state of mental health services for children and adolescents (<ref type="biblio">Nardocci, 2009</ref>). The outcome<lb/> showed the inappropriateness of child and adolescent mental health services provision, in that only<lb/> 12 regions out of 20 have established formal neuropsychiatry services, of which 8 have a clear<lb/> denomination, 7 have a specific strategic plan for their catchment area and only 3 have a fixed<lb/> organisational structure. Moreover, management responsibilities are in most regions ambiguous: in<lb/> 4 regions neuropsychiatry services merge with Departments of Mental Health, in 4 regions they merge<lb/> with Mother/Infant Departments and in the remaining 12 regions they are managed by a variety of services<lb/> (<ref type="biblio">Nardocci, 2009</ref>).<lb/> 123.<lb/> The current deficiencies in the provision of mental health services for the youngest population<lb/> groups have historical roots. Law 180 disregarded child and adolescent mental health care. For instance, on<lb/> 31 December 1960 there were 310 326 children hospitalised in isolated institutions (<ref type="biblio">ISTAT, 1963</ref>):<lb/> 112 956 in orphanages; 87 594 in &quot; institutes for poor and abandoned children &quot; ; 61 402 in permanent<lb/> colonies, i.e. &quot; institutes that accommodate lymphatic, anemic and TBC prone children, etc. &quot; ; 18 464 in<lb/> institutes for &quot; other categories of patients &quot; ; 10 081 in institutes for &quot; mentally disabled people &quot; ; 8 699 in the<lb/> new orphanages for &quot; internal upbringing &quot; ; 7 624 in institutes for the &quot; sensory impaired &quot; ; and 3 506 in<lb/> institutes for the &quot; physically impaired &quot; . Running in parallel with these institutions was a system of special<lb/> schools and &quot; different &quot; classes for socially deprived children and children with medium intellect or<lb/> language deficiencies (ISTAT, 1963). Following a variety of well-documented scandals in child and<lb/> adolescent mental health institutions, Law 104 on the rights of disabled people, including children and<lb/> adolescents, was approved in 1992. Although most regions have fully implemented Law 104, some are still<lb/> lagging (<ref type="biblio">Nardocci, 2009</ref>).<lb/> 124.<lb/> The draft National Health Plan 2011-2013, along with the most recent Italian Mental Health<lb/> Action Plan, highlighted the unsatisfactory state of the provision of child and adolescent mental health<lb/> services in Italy and called for an integrated and coordinated response at the national, regional and local<lb/> levels. In particular, there is the need to: establish a comprehensive monitoring system for child and<lb/> adolescent mental health; reorganise neuropsychiatric services in a homogeneous and efficient way<lb/> throughout Italy; encourage early intervention on the onset of the mental health illness; and facilitate<lb/> cooperation and coordination between mental health services and pediatric services, schools, community<lb/> social services and commissioned private health services (Ministry of <ref type="biblio">Health, 2011a</ref>; Ministry of Health,<lb/> 2013).<lb/> 125.<lb/> Although falling beyond the scope of this paper, recent strategies are being promoted to provide<lb/> policy direction in the field of autism disorders, e.g. the &quot; Action Plan for the improvement and promotion<lb/> of qualitative and appropriate interventions in developmental disorders, with a particular reference to<lb/> autism disorders &quot; (Linee di indirizzo per la promozione ed il miglioramento della qualità e<lb/> dell&apos;appropriatezza degli interventi assistenziali nel settore dei Disturbi pervasivi dello sviluppo, con<lb/> particolare riferimento ai disturbi dello spettro autistico) (Ministry of Health, 2012b).<lb/></table>

			<figure>4.3. Forensic mental health<lb/> 126.<lb/> Since the mid-1970s, &quot; Judiciary Psychiatric Hospitals &quot; (Ospedali Psichiatrici Giudiziari – OPG,<lb/> forensic inpatient units) have replaced the former criminal asylums in Italy. Despite the aim of Law<lb/> Basaglia to close all former mental hospitals in 1978, the protection and health care of mentally disordered<lb/> offenders was disregarded by Law 180. As a consequence, forensic inpatient units established in 1975 were<lb/> kept open and remained more or less unchanged. There are currently 6 forensic inpatient units in Italy: the<lb/> Judiciary Psychiatric Hospital of Barcellona Pozzo di Gotto (Sicilia); the Judiciary Psychiatric Hospital of<lb/> Reggio Emilia (Emilia Romagna); the Judiciary Psychiatric Hospital of Montelupo Fiorentino (Toscana);<lb/> the Judiciary Psychiatric Hospital of Castiglione delle Stiviere (Lombardia); the Judiciary Psychiatric<lb/> Hospital of Napoli (Campania) and the Judiciary Psychiatric Hospital of Aversa (Campania). Due to the<lb/> implementation of Law 9 (see below) and the current process of closure of all OPGs, the number of<lb/> inmates decreased from 1 378 in July 2011 to 972 in June 2012, and the figure is continuing to fall.<lb/> 127.<lb/> The Italian Penal Code (hereafter p.c.) is a binary code, requiring detention for &quot; sane &quot; offenders<lb/> and security measures for mentally disabled people. As established by Art. 88 and 89 p.c., offenders are<lb/> not criminally liable if, at the moment of the offence, they were not capable of &quot; understanding and intent &quot;<lb/> (capacità di intendere e di volere) because of mental impairment. Inmates who experienced mental health<lb/> impairment during the execution of the sentence (Art. 148 p.c.), people with a severe mental handicap<lb/> (Art. 111 D.P.R. 230/2000) and people with partial mental disorder (Art. 219) are also eligible for being<lb/> detained in an OPG, upon verification that they are socially dangerous (Art. 203 p.c.). Under Art. 222 p.c.,<lb/> security measures consist in at least 2, 5 or 10 years detention in Judiciary Psychiatric Hospitals<lb/> (depending on the severity of the crime committed), after which, under Art. 208 p.c., the patient is subject<lb/> to re-examination of his/her social dangerousness by the surveillance judge, rather than being<lb/> automatically discharged after the sentence is served, as is the case for sane inmates.<lb/> 128.<lb/> As of July 2011, the legal status of patients was as follows: 534 patients declared criminally<lb/> irresponsible and involuntarily placed in an OPG under section 222 of the Penal Code; 338 patients whose<lb/> provisional placement in an OPG had been ordered under section 206 of the Penal Code (Temporary<lb/> Security Measures); 68 sentenced prisoners requiring psychiatric care placed in the OPG under section 148<lb/> of the Penal Code; 364 patients declared partially criminally irresponsible and placed in a &quot; care and<lb/> detention centre &quot; (Casa di Cura e Custodia) under section 219 of the Penal Code; and 45 patients declared<lb/> mentally handicapped under section 111 c5 DPR 230/00 of the Penal Code (see Figure 21).<lb/> Figure 21.

More precisely, Prime Ministerial Decree/2008, which took effect on 14 June<lb/> 2008, entrusted the regions and Local Health Authorities with health care responsibilities over prisons,<lb/> juvenile justice services, as well as the OPGs (Ministry of Health &amp; Ministry of Justice, 2008a).</figure>

The former identifies optimal<lb/> paths for the prevention and treatment of mentally disordered offenders, in order to achieve the LEAs; the<lb/> latter is a programmatic document that defines a three-phase process for the harmonisation of safety and<lb/> sanitary requirements within OPGs (Ministry of Health &amp; Ministry of Justice, 2008b). Nevertheless, the<lb/> implementation of Prime Ministerial Decree/2008 was disregarded by the Sicily region, which has not<lb/> transferred health competencies to the NHS for the administration of the Psychiatric Hospital of Barcellona<lb/> Pozzo di Gotto.<lb/> 130.<lb/> The National Strategic Plan for Mental Health (Ministry of Health, 2008a) mentioned forensic<lb/> inpatient units as one of the elements in mental health services that required special attention. In this<lb/> respect the National Strategic Plan for Mental Health suggested that:<lb/></table>

			<p>• The discharge of inmates who have come to the end of their security measure should be planned<lb/> with the concerned regions and local actors in order to ensure effective social inclusion;<lb/> • All necessary actions must be taken on a regional level to enforce alternative projects to the<lb/> admission in OPGs through the continuity of the relationship between the Departments of Mental<lb/> Health and the Courts of Justice;<lb/></p>

			<p>• Inmates formerly sent to penitentiary facilities before being admitted to OPGs should reintegrate<lb/> their former facilities with a guarantee that all health interventions and rehabilitative programmes<lb/> would be performed in the penal institutions.<lb/></p>

			<figure>131.<lb/> In 2010, the European Council for the Prevention of Torture (CPT) published a Report<lb/> summarising the outcomes of the inspections conducted into some security facilities in Italy, including<lb/> prisons, mental health wards within general hospitals and OPGs (Council of Europe, 2010). The Council<lb/> visited the OPG of Aversa and concluded that &quot; [t]he gravity of the situation observed at the Aversa OPG<lb/> calls for a more determined response from the Italian authorities, preferably at national level &quot; (Council of<lb/> Europe, 2010:62). Other visits into OPGs were conducted in 1992, 1996 and 2000 and reported more or<lb/> less the same situation.<lb/> 132.<lb/> Under Art. 82 of the Italian Constitution, a Parliamentary Commission of Inquiry into the<lb/> efficacy and the efficiency of the National Health Service (Commissione Parlamentare di Inchiesta<lb/> sull&apos;efficacia e l&apos;efficienza del Servizio Sanitario Nazionale) (hereafter the &quot; Commission &quot; ), was set up in<lb/> 2008 to monitor the quality of both public and private health services provided in the whole territory and to<lb/> control the actual implementation of health policies, thus providing the Parliament and the Public<lb/> Administration with comprehensive indications on the state of health services provision in Italy. The<lb/> Commission was composed of 20 senators and 1 President and holds, for the entire period of the legislature<lb/> (5 years), the same powers and limitations conferred on the legal authorities. Following the above-<lb/>mentioned recommendations of the National Strategic Plan for Mental Health (Ministry of Health, 2008a),<lb/> part of the work undertaken by the Commission was devoted to the investigation of the operation of Italy&apos;s<lb/> OPGs. The Commission organised regular unannounced on-the-spot inspections during the years 2008-<lb/>2011 into each of the 6 OPGs and carried out interviews with OPG directors and with consumer<lb/> associations (such as Psychiatric Democracy – Democrazia Psichiatrica and StopOPG).<lb/></figure>

			<p>133.<lb/> The outcome of the investigation revealed the inadequacy of primary and secondary health care<lb/> provision in all OPGs, with the exception of the Judiciary Psychiatric Hospital of Castiglione delle<lb/> Stiviere, and in particular: &quot; severe and unacceptable &quot; hygienic and sanitary conditions, with a structural<lb/> setting more similar to prisons than average psychiatric services provided in Italy; health and social care<lb/> personnel shortages; and inadequate clinical treatments, including improper use of physical and<lb/> pharmacological restraint. In some extreme cases, the rooms/cells were overcrowded (some even had bunk<lb/> beds, contrary to the prison authorities&apos; guidelines); for half of the structures, the number of inmates<lb/> exceeded the facility&apos;s regulatory capacity, whilst in one case the number of inmates exceeded the<lb/> structure&apos;s tolerated capacity (see <ref type="figure">Figure 22</ref>); the management of cleaning services was unclear and<lb/> remained undelivered or left to patients; insufficient basic primary health care and specialist mental health<lb/> care was provided, with significant staff shortages of physicians and nurses and a complete absence of<lb/> psychiatrists and/or psychologists; the use of drugs was not duly certified or appropriately recorded, with<lb/> evident breaches of current legislation (art. 60 e ss. del D.P.R. 309/199); and brutal restraint measures,<lb/> besides being contrary to Art. 32 of the Italian Constitution – &quot; the law can in no case violate the limits<lb/> imposed by respect for the human person &quot; – were not regularly reported in the patient&apos;s clinical diary<lb/> (<ref type="biblio">Italian Parliament, 2011</ref>).<lb/></p>

Regulatory capacity, tolerated capacity and actual presence of inmates in the 6 OPGs – July 2011<lb/> Source: Italian Parliament (2011), Revisione sulle condizioni di vita e di cura all&apos;interno degli Ospedali Psichiatrici Giudiziari [Review<lb/> on life conditions and health care standards within OPGs],<lb/> Available: http://www.senato.it/documenti/repository/commissioni/servizio_sanitario16/Relazione_OOPPGG_doc_XXII-bis_4.pdf<lb/> Italian Parliament, Senate, 2011.<lb/> 134.<lb/> Following the inspections, in July 2011 the Commission published an evidence-based &quot; Review of<lb/> life conditions and health care standards within OPGs &quot; (Revisione sulle condizioni di vita e di cura<lb/> all&apos;interno degli Ospedali Psichiatrici Giudiziari) (Italian Parliament, 2011). In addition to encouraging<lb/> the actual transfer of responsibilities from the penitentiary administration to the NHS in the Psychiatric<lb/> Hospital of Barcellona Pozzo di Gotto (Sicily) as required by Prime Ministerial Decree/2008, the review<lb/> provided a number of recommendations for the renewal of mental health legislation and the subsequent<lb/> overrun of the OPG model.<lb/> • Specific legislation on mentally disordered offenders should be approved as a complement to<lb/> Law 180. The new model should couple mental health treatment with adequate security<lb/> measures.<lb/></figure>

			<p>• The Departments of Mental Health (DMH) should be directly responsible for taking charge of<lb/> mentally disordered offenders. The new model should be based on the provision of evidence-<lb/>based mental health treatment used as a form of health care, rather than restraint and control<lb/> measures used as a form of punishment. For this to happen, additional resources should be<lb/> allocated to DMHs. With these financial and human resources, the DMHs should provide<lb/> mentally disordered offenders with small therapeutic communities (maximum 20 hosts) across a<lb/> range of security levels in the whole territory.<lb/></p>

			<figure>0<lb/> 100<lb/> 200<lb/> 300<lb/> 400<lb/> 500<lb/> 600<lb/> Regulatory Capacity<lb/> Tolerated Capacity<lb/> Actual Presence<lb/></figure>

			<p>• In order to avoid the perpetual extension of temporary security measures, which in some cases<lb/> results in the so-called &quot; ergastolo bianco &quot; 9 , the Penal Code should be substantially modified. In<lb/> this respect, the length of security measures should be clearly defined when the sentence is<lb/> pronounced, as is the case in Spain. This is in line with the broader idea that the length of the<lb/> detention period within an OPG should not exceed the penalty provided in prison for the same<lb/> violation. A valuable alternative to this proposal would be to ensure that the level of social<lb/> danger posed by inmates is established by an adequate psychiatric medical board, rather than by<lb/> the surveillance judge.<lb/></p>

			<p>• Going even beyond the scope and legal powers of the Commission, the Review suggests that the<lb/> actual duality of the Penal Code, adopting distinct custodial measures with respect to sane and<lb/> insane patients, should be replaced by a univocal approach.<lb/></p>

			<head>135.<lb/> Other concrete actions were undertaken between 2009 and 2011 in Italy to overrun OPGs,<lb/> through the establishment of National Committees (Tavolo di Consultazione permanente sull&apos;attuazione<lb/> del DPCM 1 aprile 2008 and the Comitato Paritetico per le problematiche degli Ospedali psichiatrici<lb/> giudiziari).<lb/></head>

			<figure>136.<lb/> Legislation was approved in February 2012 (Law 9) by the Italian Government, according to<lb/> which all OPGs should be closed by 31 March 2013. Law 9 also required that, following the closure of the<lb/> OPGs, people who are no longer considered to be socially dangerous should be taken over by Departments<lb/> of Mental Health, whilst other patients are integrated into new security mental health facilities of smaller<lb/> size (20 hosts). The Ministry of Health established a working group with the aim of defining the structural,<lb/> technological and organisational requirements for the construction of the new secure mental health<lb/> facilities. Suggested by the aforementioned National Committees and approved by the Parliament, further<lb/> legislation settled that:<lb/> • The new structures should be differentiated by the severity of the pathology;<lb/></figure>

			<p>• The new facilities should be publicly owned, in virtue of the fact that in Italy the execution of a<lb/> penal sentence is under the responsibility of the public administration;<lb/> • The new services should host a maximum of 20 inmates.<lb/> 137.<lb/> In order for the legislation to be implemented in a timely way, the Italian Government earmarked<lb/> funding totalling EUR 272 million, with EUR 174 million for the construction of new infrastructures<lb/> destined to host socially dangerous OPG inmates and the remaining EUR 38 million for 2012 and<lb/> EUR 55 million for 2013 to be allocated to regions and provinces for running and managing activities.<lb/> 138.<lb/> Due to the impossibility of creating alternative mental health infrastructures on time, the closure<lb/> of the OPGs was postponed to spring 2015.<lb/></p>

			<head>4.4. Minority and excluded groups<lb/> Elderly population<lb/></head>

			<p>139.<lb/> Due to a low fertility rate and high life expectancy at birth, Italy has the highest ratio of elderly<lb/> people to the total population of any country in Europe and comes second country in the world after Japan<lb/> 9<lb/></p>

			<head>Ergastolo</head>

			<p>Bianco, literally &quot; white life sentence &quot; . It is the situation under which security measures are<lb/> continuously extended up until the point that detained people are in security facilities for their entire lives.<lb/></p>

			<p>(<ref type="biblio">Altis, 2013</ref>). People aged 65 and over represented approximately 20% of the total population in 2009,<lb/> with the 65-74 age group representing 10% and those over 75 another 10% of the ratio (<ref type="biblio">Sabetta, 2012</ref>).<lb/> 140.<lb/> The prevalence of depression among older people (over 64) is higher compared to adults<lb/> (18-64 years). Between 2009 and 2010, over 20% of the elderly were suffering from depression, compared<lb/> to 7% of adults in general, with a higher rate for people over 75 (25.3%) than for people from 65 to 74<lb/> (18.8%) (<ref type="biblio">ISS, 2012b</ref>) (for further information see section 2 on prevalence).<lb/> 141.<lb/> Mental health services for people aged above 64 are not differentiated from adult mental health<lb/> services, so that services described in section 4.1 are also available to older people.<lb/></p>

			<head>142.<lb/> The Italian Psychogeriatrics Society (Società Italiana di Psicogeriatria, AIP</head>

			<p>) is a non-profit<lb/> organisation aiming to tackle mental health problems among the eldest population. The AIP promotes<lb/> training programmes among medical (GPs and psychiatrists) and non-medical (nurses, psychologists)<lb/> personnel; promotes and undertakes research studies; organises national conferences and meetings and<lb/> promotes the dissemination of knowledge through magazines, books, newspapers and its website<lb/> (http://www.psicogeriatria.it/home/); helps in developing programmes and policies for the improvement of<lb/> the mental health status of the eldest population; and provides consultancy to both private and public<lb/> organisations.<lb/></p>

			<figure>Migrant population<lb/> 143.<lb/> From 2002 to 2011, approximately 3.5 million foreigners immigrated into Italy, a rise from 200<lb/> 000 in 2002 to more than 500 000 in 2007 and 300 000 in 2012 (ISTAT, 2012b). Since February 2011, an<lb/> increasing number of people from North Africa migrated to Italy following the Arab Spring. Differences in<lb/> immigration rates exist across regions, with northern and central regions – Lombardy (80 000) Lazio<lb/> (47 000), Emilia-Romagna (35 000) and Veneto (32 000) – having a higher number of foreign immigrants<lb/> compared to other regions (ISTAT, 2012b). These figures do not take into account all the &quot; irregular &quot;<lb/> immigrants who do not have permission to stay in the territory. It was estimated that 150 000 irregular<lb/> immigrants were living in the Lombardy region in 2009 (<ref type="biblio">Civenti et al., 2012</ref>).<lb/> 144.<lb/> The mental health agenda in Italy is giving increasing importance to the recent intensification of<lb/> migration flows and the significant increase of immigrant populations residing in the territory.<lb/> Multiculturalism is a key point of the National Strategic Plans for Mental Health, with the policy document<lb/> emphasising the importance of integrating linguistic/cultural mediation in the range of services provided by<lb/> mental health facilities (Ministry of Health, 2008a).<lb/> 145.<lb/> Today, access to health care services for irregular immigrants is incomplete and uncertain,<lb/> whereas regular immigrants have the same rights to access health services as citizens. Nonetheless, the<lb/> latter do not benefit from the services in the same way as citizens do, a phenomenon that in the literature is<lb/> called the &quot; implementation deficit &quot; . This is mainly due to the characteristics of the services (community<lb/> services, as opposed to hospitals), the stigma related to the utilisation of mental health facilities and the<lb/> absence of multicultural specialistis able to decode mental health symptoms while taking into account<lb/> cultural differences (<ref type="biblio">Civenti et al., 2012</ref>).<lb/> 146.<lb/> Regional programmes have been implemented in recent years to gauge the state of mental health<lb/> among immigrants in Italy and to adapt mental health facilities to provide services more suited to this<lb/> population group. A concrete instance of this process is the project on &quot; Migration and psychiatric disorders<lb/> in child, adolescent and adult mental health &quot; (Migrazione e disagio psichico nell&apos;età evolutiva e verso l&apos;età<lb/> adulta), which was developed and implemented in 2007 in the Lombardy region following evidence that<lb/> over the past years child and adolescent immigrants accessed mental health services twice as much as<lb/></p>

			<p>Italian citizens, that they dropped out from mental health services very frequently and that they dropped<lb/> out of school three times as frequently as Italian children and adolescents. As mentioned above, the<lb/> Lombardy region has the highest number of immigrants of any region, and this holds for young immigrants<lb/> as well. In Milan, for instance, 20% of all adolescents have a history of migration (e.g. immigrant minors<lb/> without their parents, first-and second-generation immigrants).<lb/> 147.<lb/> The project &quot; Migration and psychiatric disorders in child, adolescent and adult mental health &quot;<lb/> aims at improving mental health services for the immigrant population through a variety of different<lb/> activities, including the following: linking mental health services with other services, i.e. schools, in order<lb/> to ensure prompt intervention in the early stages of mental health disorders; providing qualitative and<lb/> pertinent hospitalisations for immigrants (both in mental health and other health sectors); providing<lb/> prompt, cross-cultural responses, through the development of multicultural teams within mental health<lb/> services, as well as the provision of informative brochures in different languages; providing mental health<lb/> services for immigrant offenders suffering from mental health problems; and linking child and adolescent<lb/> mental health services with adult mental health services in order to guarantee the continuity of mental<lb/> health assistance. Moreover, since 2010 mental health services in the Lombardy region have organised an<lb/> ad hoc information system in order to gather epidemiological data from immigrants who access mental<lb/> health services for the first time.<lb/> 148.<lb/> Running in parallel with the regional initiatives is a national discussion among experts, including<lb/> mental health experts, on the topic of migration. The National Focal Point Italian Infectious Diseases and<lb/> Migrant (NFP) is a network of experts in the field of infectious diseases within the migrant population. The<lb/> working groups were established in 1997 in the context of the &quot; AIDS &amp; Mobility &quot; project and today are<lb/> coordinated by the National Institute of Health (ISS). During the XI Conference, which took place in 2012,<lb/> the NFP focused on the correlation between mental health, culture and infectious diseases within the<lb/> immigrant population in Italy. The Conference concluded that mental health control could have a positive<lb/> effect on infectious disease control within the immigrant population (ISS, 2012c).<lb/></p>

			<head>Post-earthquake organisation and delivery of mental health services in L&apos;Aquila<lb/></head>

			<p>149.<lb/> On 6 April 2009, an earthquake (6.3 Mw) hit the city of L&apos;Aquila (Abruzzo) – in central Italy – a<lb/> town with 72 000 inhabitants and a health district of 105 000 residents. The earthquake caused the death of<lb/> 309 people, with more than 1 600 individuals injured, among whom 200 were severely injured and<lb/> hospitalised and 66 000 displaced. Approximately 44 000 found an accommodation in tented camps close<lb/> to their place of residence, and a further 20 000 were housed in hotels on the Abruzzo Adriatic Sea coast.<lb/> Others stayed with friends and relatives throughout Italy (<ref type="biblio">Casacchia et al., 2012</ref>).<lb/> 150.<lb/> Natural disasters like earthquakes are traumatic events that can cause severe psychological<lb/> distress. A study was conducted between April 2009 and January 2010 among 187 young people seeking<lb/> help at the Service for Monitoring and early Intervention against psychological and mental suffering in<lb/> young people (SMILE) at the L&apos;Aquila University Psychiatric Department. The aim was to evaluate the<lb/> presence of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) in the sample. 44.2% and 37.4% respectively showed<lb/> high and moderate levels of psychological distress. 66.7% reported the presence of a significant post-<lb/>traumatic symptom (Post-traumatic Syndrome), while a diagnosis of PTSD was made in 13.8% of the<lb/> sample (<ref type="biblio">Pollice et al., 2010</ref>). This is in line with other studies showing that natural disasters produce high<lb/> psychological distress. A study assessing the prevalence of Acute Stress Disorder (ASD) among<lb/> individuals seeking help at the General Hospital Psychiatric Unit of the San Salvatore Hospital following<lb/> the earthquake showed that, despite the high level of psychological distress (GHQ-12 ≥20, cut-off value)<lb/> found in 65.6% of the subjects, only 6 subjects (4.9%) could be considered affected by &quot; full &quot; ASD,<lb/> whereas 48 subjects (39.3%) could be considered affected by &quot; partial &quot; ASD (<ref type="biblio">Casacchia et al., 2013</ref>). A<lb/> study conducted on some 1 078 young adults (mean age 21.4 ± 5.6) to assess mental health status and the<lb/> increase in substance use (tobacco, alcohol and cannabis) after the earthquake, showed that 314 people<lb/> (29.1% of the sample) had an ICD-10 diagnosis of anxiety disorders (43%), mood disorders (34%), PTSD<lb/> (16%) and psychosis (7%). 57% of these 314 people increased their consumption of alcohol, 41% of<lb/> tobacco and 22% of cannabis (<ref type="biblio">Pollice et al., 2011a</ref>). Another study gave evidence of a significant increase<lb/> of first episode psychosis (FEP) after the earthquake (<ref type="biblio">Pollice et al., 2011b</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<head>151.<lb/> The project Programma di Supporto Psicosociale Emergenza Sisma</head>

			<p>(SPES) (Psychosocial<lb/> Support and Earthquake Emergency) was establish to give mental health support to people seeking help<lb/> after the earthquake in L&apos;Aquila. Approved on May 2009 and granted by the Italian Ministry of Health, the<lb/> project was carried out in a tent. SPES currently includes three main areas of intervention: (1) assessment<lb/> of the earthquake&apos;s impact on the general population; (2) cooperation with GPs i.e. training of GPs in the<lb/> identification and psychological management of traumatic events; (3) support of secondary mental health<lb/> services in the region, such as training in Evidence-Based Medicine (EBM) and treatments for PTSD. After<lb/> the earthquake, it was hypothesised that most residents had found a way to recover through &quot; writing and<lb/> telling the story &quot; . As a consequence, a large number of materials (books, web-blogs, videos) were<lb/> produced by residents and a database of memories was implemented. Many collective demonstrations were<lb/> organised and showed the will to actively participate in the process of reconstructing the civil and scientific<lb/> life of the town (<ref type="biblio">Casacchia et al., 2012</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<head>4.5. Human resources and training<lb/></head>

			<p>153.<lb/> Medical students can become psychiatrists after obtaining their medical degree (5-year<lb/> programme, with a special focus on communication skills, role-playing and empirical know-how since<lb/> 1996) by completing a 4-year postgraduate training in a university or in mental health services under<lb/></p>

The training specifically requires that aspiring psychiatrists<lb/> treat at least 80 patients; provide psychotherapy to at least 20 patients under supervision; give<lb/> psychometric tests to at least 40 patients; take part in at least 10 rehabilitation programmes and 5 controlled<lb/> clinical trials on psychotropics; give at least 20 psychiatric consultations; be on call 50 times; and become<lb/> familiar with forensic psychiatry.<lb/></table>

			<p>154.<lb/> Guidelines and approaches, especially concerning training in psychotherapy, forensic psychiatry<lb/> and psychiatric rehabilitation, can vary from one school of psychiatry to another, and psychotherapy is<lb/> much less used than a strictly biological approach. Despite psychotherapy training being relatively<lb/> insufficient to ensure proper know-how, students who have completed the 4-year training are considered<lb/> licensed psychotherapists.<lb/></p>

			<figure>Psychologists<lb/> 155.<lb/> Psychologists play an active role in the consultation-liaison process set up to link GPs to mental<lb/> health professionals (see Box 7). The WHO Mental Health Atlas (WHO, 2011) has reported that Italy as<lb/> having one of the lowest numbers of clinician psychologists in Europe, with a ratio of 2.58 psychologists<lb/> for 100 000 inhabitants in 2011.<lb/></figure>

			<p>156.<lb/> Contact with psychologists is low overall in Italy. For instance, the ESEMeD study found that<lb/> only 6% of people had addressed a psychologist with the NHS for a psychological issue (<ref type="biblio">De Girolamo et<lb/> al., 2006a</ref>) with the general impression being that psychotherapy is costly: concretely, the Bersani decree<lb/> of 2006 (D.L. 4/7/2006 n. 233 c.d.) has abolished minimum tariffs for psychotherapy sessions, with<lb/> regional orders of psychologists setting up varied rates for consultancy and therapy sessions (usually from<lb/> EUR 35 up to EUR 115) (for further information on tariffs see http://www.psy.it/tariffario.html ).<lb/> 157.<lb/> Aspiring psychologists have to complete a 3-year programme (bachelor&apos;s degree) followed by a<lb/> 2-year programme (master&apos;s degree) in psychological specialties. In order to be licensed within the NHS<lb/> system, students must then complete an additional 4-year postgraduate training. Aspiring psychotherapists<lb/> must complete a 4-year postgraduate training in a university with a psychotherapy programme or in<lb/> certified private facilities.<lb/></p>

			<head>Mental health nurses<lb/></head>

			<head>5. MENTAL HEALTH CARE FINANCING AND EXPENDITURE<lb/> 5.1. Financing of mental health services<lb/></head>

			<p>160.<lb/> In 1978, the NHS introduced a fully tax-based public health care system founded on the principle<lb/> of universal coverage, whilst a narrower share was left to users&apos; out-of-pocket payments (co-payments for<lb/> public services and the purchase of private services) and voluntary health insurance. Funds are allocated by<lb/> the Government as a general health budget to the regions, and then the regions allocate their budget to<lb/> Local Health Authorities according to their needs and priorities. The allocation of financial resources to<lb/> health sectors, including mental health, is made at the regional level, resulting in a wide variability across<lb/> regions. Each region in Italy has financial and managerial autonomy, resulting in Local Health Authorities<lb/> being responsible for their own budget and financing mental health services that they consider appropriate<lb/> and responsive to local needs.<lb/> 161.<lb/> The formula for allocating financial resources has always been a source of debate in Italy. On the<lb/> one hand, focus was given to the &quot; horizontal &quot; equity of access of health services, on the other hand there<lb/> was concern about agreeing an allocation formula that could take into account regional and local peculiar<lb/> needs ( &quot; vertical equity &quot; ). The progressive establishment of a system of fiscal federalism resulted in the<lb/> abolition of social insurance contributions in 1998 and the subsequent inception of a regionally collected<lb/> system of tax financing. General taxation started playing an increasingly marginal role, redistributing<lb/> resources across regions with a more contracted tax base in order to ensure equal provision of health care<lb/> services across the 20 regions (<ref type="biblio">Lo Scalzo et al., 2009</ref>). Moving away from a system based on historical<lb/> spending, a weighted capitation rate was eventually introduced in 2003. The allocation formula took into<lb/> consideration the Essential Levels of Assistance – defined as the minimum level of care that the NHS must<lb/> guarantee to all citizens – and specific population characteristics, such as the size of the weighted<lb/> population, demographic density, epidemiology, infant mortality rates and the number of health facilities<lb/> (<ref type="biblio">Tibaldi et al., 2006</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<head>5.2. Provider payment mechanisms<lb/></head>

			<p>162.<lb/> In Italy the public health care sector is composed of public facilities and private accredited<lb/> facilities. Private accredited facilities are considered as fully public structures, as they are financed by the<lb/> NHS and provide services on behalf of the NHS (see Box 9).<lb/></p>

			<figure>Box 9. The process of accrediting private facilities<lb/> The Law regarding NHS accreditation in Italy was adopted on 14 January 1997 (Dpr. 14.01.1997). Most recently,<lb/> a new legal framework – Disciplinare sulla revisione della normativa dell&apos;Accreditamento – was approved on 20<lb/> December 2012, which slightly reformed the 1997 Law. The 1997 Law defined the minimum structural, technological<lb/> and organisational standards that need to be fulfilled by any health facility in order to be accredited to the public sector.<lb/> Although the accreditation process has to comply with the national guidelines outlined by the Ministry of Health, the<lb/> 1997 Law devolves to regions the responsibility to define quality standards for the accreditation process. Regional<lb/> criteria are often stricter than national standards. The 1998-2000 National Health Plan deemed the accreditation<lb/> process to be the best way to select health services providers on the basis of quality standards, in that it certifies that<lb/> accredited facilities are in compliance with the standards in force and requires accredited structures to be regularly<lb/> monitored (Ministry of Health, 1998b).<lb/></figure>

			<head>163</head>

			<p>.<lb/> A tailored budget is established for inpatient, outpatient and long-term residential and semi-<lb/>residential facilities. Some inpatient facilities (psychiatric wards in general hospitals, GHPUs) are<lb/> reimbursed for the hospitalisation of patients with mental illness on the basis of the diagnosis-related group<lb/> (DRG) system. Post-hospitalisation rehabilitation activities are reimbursed on the basis of national tariffs.<lb/> For most outpatient facilities (e.g. CMHCs), specialist mental health care tariffs are established at the<lb/> national level. The daily tariffs of residential and semi-residential facilities depend on the type of<lb/> assistance provided (intensive, extensive care). In particular, tariffs for residential facilities vary<lb/> significantly across regions (OECD Mental Health Questionnaire, 2012). However, a document reviewing<lb/> cost standards and tariffs in RFs has been drafted and should be approved in the near future.<lb/></p>

			<head>General Practitioners (GPs)<lb/></head>

			<p>164.<lb/> Before the inception of the NHS in 1978, GPs were remunerated through the patient&apos;s mutual<lb/> fund. Charging a fee for each given service, a GP&apos;s salary depended directly on the number of services<lb/> provided. Since the establishment of the NHS, GPs can decide whether to work full-time or part-time for<lb/> the NHS, and they are remunerated by Local Health Authorities on a capitation basis. The capitation<lb/> formula is calculated by multiplying the number of patients enrolled on a GP&apos;s list by the payment per<lb/> capita. Treating patients privately on a fee-for-service basis could also represent an additional source of<lb/> revenue, provided that the provision of private services does not interfere with the time devoted to the<lb/> regular provision of primary care services for NHS patients (WHO, 2011).<lb/> 165.<lb/> Every three years an agreement is signed between the central government and the GP trade<lb/> unions. The agreement determines the terms and conditions of the contract, including payment levels,<lb/> duties, GP responsibilities, in addition to the maximum number of patients enrolled on a GP&apos;s list<lb/> (<ref type="biblio">Lo Scalzo et al., 2009</ref>). Apart from the national agreement, GPs also sign regional contracts, which define<lb/> the conditions for delivering supplementary services and earning incentives and for participating in<lb/> targeted training programmes.<lb/></p>

			<head>5.3. Mental health care expenditure<lb/></head>

			<p>166.<lb/> There is no data available on mental health care spending at the national level. This is due to the<lb/> fact that the regions and Local Health Authorities are totally autonomous in the allocation of financial<lb/> resources to health care sectors. However, it was established through the Conference of Regions<lb/> (Conferenza delle Regioni) that no less than 5% of the local health budget should be allocated to mental<lb/> health services (WHO, 2011). Nonetheless, this is a general guideline rather than the actual mental health<lb/> care expenditure at the regional level, with some regions consistently allocating more than 5% of their<lb/> health budget to mental health care, and other regions less.<lb/> 167.<lb/> Although national data on mental health expenditure is not available, regional and local studies<lb/> have been performed to track mental health spending. For instance, the city of Trieste regularly tracks the<lb/> financial resources used for providing mental health services, a model that has been implemented in the<lb/> entire region of Friuli-Venezia-Giulia (see Box 8).<lb/></p>

			<head>Pharmaceutical expenditures and consumption<lb/></head>

			<p>168.<lb/> The pricing and reimbursement of pharmaceuticals are handled by the Italian Pharmaceutical<lb/> Agency (Agenzia Italiana del Farmaco – AIFA). The negotiations on drug pricing/reimbursement are<lb/> subject to several criteria:<lb/> • The cost/effectiveness ratio must be positive for a new drug to be covered by the NHS (i.e. a new<lb/> drug must present an adequate alternative treatment for a pathology compared to other available<lb/> treatments for the same therapeutic indications);<lb/></p>

			<p>• The risk/benefit ratio must be higher than that of other available drugs for the same therapeutic<lb/> indications;<lb/> • The economic and financial impact on the National Health Service must be evaluated;<lb/></p>

			<p>• The cost of the therapy must be preferable compared to other products of the same effectiveness;<lb/></p>

			<table>• Market shares must be evaluated;<lb/> • A comparison of the drug&apos;s price and consumption in other EU countries must be made.<lb/> 169.<lb/> Pharmaceuticals under class A and H 10 are fully reimbursed by the NHS, with the user paying a<lb/> fixed price per box, whereas pharmaceuticals under class C and C-bis 11 are paid entirely by users&apos; out-of-<lb/>pocket fees.<lb/> 170.<lb/> Total spending for Central Nervous System pharmaceuticals accounted for EUR 3.410 million in<lb/> 2011, representing the second-highest pharmaceutical national spend. 42.5% of this figure was entirely<lb/> financed by the NHS, 17.5% was refunded by public institutions and the remaining 40% was financed by<lb/> users through out-of-pocket payments (70% of which belongs to class C) (OsMed, 2012).<lb/> 171.<lb/> The consumption (in DDD/1 000 population) of anxiolytics in Italy is stable since 2000, and<lb/> slightly above the OECD average in 2011 (see Figures 25).<lb/></table>

			<figure>Figure 25. DDD of anxiolytics per 1 000 population in OECD countries, 2010 or latest year available<lb/> Source: OECD (2013), Health at a Glance 2013: OECD Indicators, OECD Publishing<lb/></figure>

			<p>172.<lb/> Conversely, in 2011 the consumption of antidepressants was lower in Italy compared to the<lb/> OECD average. In line with all OECD countries, the consumption of antidepressants has increased over the<lb/> past decade in Italy (see <ref type="figure">Figure 26</ref>).<lb/></p>

The OsMed (2012) study also provides an<lb/> analysis of the use of antidepressants. It was estimated that only 1 out of 4 people being treated with<lb/> antidepressants has exceeded the 2009 Nice guidelines on depression and used the treatment for more than<lb/> 56<lb/> 42<lb/> 0<lb/> 2 0<lb/> 4 0<lb/> 6 0<lb/> 8 0<lb/> 1 0 0<lb/> 1 2 0<lb/> Iceland<lb/> Australia<lb/> Canada<lb/> Denmark<lb/> Sweden<lb/> Portugal<lb/> United Kingdom<lb/> Finland<lb/> Belgium<lb/> Spain<lb/> Norway<lb/> OECD<lb/> Luxembourg<lb/> Germany<lb/> Slovenia<lb/> France<lb/> Czech Republic<lb/> Netherlands<lb/> Italy<lb/> Slovak Republic<lb/> Hungary<lb/> Estonia<lb/> Chile<lb/> Korea<lb/> Defined daily dose, per 1 000 people per day<lb/> 2011<lb/> 2000<lb/> 106<lb/> 6 months. Bolzano, Trento and Friuli Venezia Giulia were the most compliant with the Nice guidelines,<lb/> whilst Basilicata and Calabria were the less compliant (OsMed, 2012).<lb/> 174.<lb/> Unlike antidepressants, the consumption of antipsychotic drugs decreased in 2010 from the<lb/> previous year (from 3.01 in 2009 to 2.80 DDD/1000 population per day), in line with the steady decrease<lb/> that has been observed since 2001 (Sabetta, 2012).<lb/></figure>

			<head>6. DISCUSSION, INNOVATIVE PRACTICES AND CONCLUSION<lb/> 6.1. Discussion and key messages<lb/></head>

			<p>175.<lb/> One of the most important peculiarities of the mental health system in Italy is the shift from<lb/> hospital-centred services to community-based mental health facilities that occurred over the last thirty<lb/> years. This de-institutionalisation process abandoned old approaches of social seclusion and stigmatisation<lb/> of people with mental health disorders in favour of their social re-integration into the community<lb/> (<ref type="biblio">Mezzina, 2005</ref>). Italy&apos;s long history of de-institutionalisation is now culminating in the process of closing<lb/> all the Judicial Psychiatric Hospitals, which are the last form of mental health institutions still found in<lb/> Italy. The next step towards the accomplishment of this de-institutionalisation process would be the<lb/> improvement and reorganisation of Residential Facilities (RFs), which in some cases provide mental health<lb/> assistance rather than therapeutic care, without a real connection with the community or limits on the<lb/> length of stay. This is of particular interest in that an important portion of mental health financial resources<lb/> are allocated to RFs, with a reduced budget allocated to other mental health services, e.g. CMHCs. Whilst<lb/> there is an urgent necessity to re-define national standards, a document addressing these issues is under<lb/> approval by State and Regions.<lb/> 176.<lb/> Running in parallel with de-institutionalisation was the process of federalisation, with regions<lb/> gaining growing responsibilities with respect to the central Government in the management of financial<lb/> resources, the settling of regional standards, the definition of regional policies and the management of<lb/> services. If on the one hand regional autonomy promotes tailored interventions based on local needs, on the<lb/> other hand it also intensifies existing differences across regions in terms of the provision of mental health<lb/> services, the efficacy of information systems, tariffs and organisation. This is particularly true with respect<lb/> to child and adolescent mental health services, whose organisation differs particularly from region to<lb/> region and where in some cases psychiatric services do not always collaborate with Infant Neuropsychiatry<lb/> Services. Whilst there are increasing efforts towards the development of a more bilanced relationship<lb/> between the Ministry of Health – whose objective is to set National standards – and the regions – whose<lb/> scope is to organise and manage mental health services – there is still the need to guarantee greater<lb/> homogeneity across regions.<lb/> 177.<lb/> As discussed earlier in this chapter, progress is being made in the development of mental health<lb/> information systems. However, mental health information systems should be implemented throughout all<lb/> Italy&apos;s regions, and benchmark indicators on the quality of mental health services should also be<lb/> developed. Moreover, a second step for the development of mental health information systems would be to<lb/> include epidemiological data in addition to data on the services provided. The development of efficient<lb/> information systems would also allow the Ministry of Health to develop a set of clinical and outcome<lb/> indicators on mental health at the national level. Although the Ministry of Health is currently moving in<lb/> this direction, there is still progress to be made at the regional level to collect qualitative data.<lb/> 178.<lb/> Although epidemiological studies have been conducted on the prevalence and incidence of<lb/> mental health problems in specific areas or selected population groups, there is still the need to conduct<lb/> epidemiological studies on the general population at the national level. So far the focus has been on the<lb/> population accessing a sample of mental health services. However, the results of such epidemiological<lb/> studies are unlikely to represent the general population, first of all because people not accessing mental<lb/> health services are not being represented, and second because the population sample is not drawn from the<lb/> entire population but from specific pilot areas, thereby biasing the results of the estimation. The existence<lb/> of national epidemiological data on the general population would allow the Ministry of Health to adopt<lb/> targeted interventions, to promote tailored mental health policies and to develop outcomes and clinical<lb/> indicators to allow benchmarking both domestically within the country and internationally across<lb/> countries.<lb/> 179.<lb/> Last but not least, data and indicators on mental health outcomes should be accompanied with<lb/> data and indicators on mental health inputs. There is still the urgent need in Italy to provide qualitative and<lb/> reliable information on mental health expenditures both at the regional and national level, in order to fully<lb/> evaluate the performance of the mental health system and measure whether resources are being allocated in<lb/> an efficient and optimal way.<lb/></p>

			<head>6.2. Ongoing mental</head>

			<figure>health agenda<lb/> 180.<lb/> Besides defining a set of priority areas, as is discussed in section 3.3., the Italian Mental Health<lb/> Action Plan (IMHAP) (Linee di Azioni Nazionale per la Salute Mentale) (Ministry of Health, 2013) also<lb/> suggests a variety of mental health areas to be included in the mental health agenda in the upcoming<lb/> months/years. The IMHAP proposes developing a set of national guidelines and/or specific action plans<lb/> on: suicide prevention; personality, mood and eating disorders; mental health in migrants and residential<lb/> and day treatment facilities; and autism disorders, which was very recently addressed by a national<lb/> guideline (SNLG, 2011), and an action plan approved by the Ministry of Health and the Regions (Ministry<lb/> of Health, 2012b).<lb/> 6.3. Outstanding and innovative initiatives: best practice examples<lb/> • The formal process of closing all the Judicial Psychiatric Hospitals, promoted by the joint efforts<lb/> of the Ministry of Health, the Ministry of Justice and the Regions, and accelerated by the<lb/> Parliamentary Commission of Inquiry into the efficacy and efficiency of the National Health<lb/> Service (Commissione Parlamentare di Inchiesta sull&apos;efficacia e l&apos;efficienza del Servizio<lb/> Sanitario Nazionale) (section 4.3).<lb/></figure>

			<p>• The development by the SIEP of a set of clinical indicators for depression, schizophrenia and<lb/> bipolar disorders. These clinical indicators are a crucial tool for improving the quality of care and<lb/> carrying out evidence-based interventions to treat severe mental health disorders (section 2.3).<lb/> • The experience of the South Verona community psychiatric service (CPS) (section 4.5).<lb/> • Local activities undertaken to fight stigma (section 4.5.).<lb/></p>

			<p>• The development of a more structured approach to the treatment of mild to moderate mental<lb/> health disorders in primary care, e.g. the consultation-liaison model developed in Emilia<lb/> Romagna (section 4.1.).<lb/></p>

			<head>GLOSSARY<lb/></head>

			<p>• Governance refers to the exercise of political, economic and administrative authority in the<lb/> management of a country&apos;s affairs at all levels (WHO).<lb/> • Mild generally refers to relatively few core symptoms (although sufficient to achieve a<lb/> diagnosis), a limited duration and little impact on day-to-day functioning (NICE, 2011).<lb/> • Moderate refers to the presence of all core symptoms of the disorder plus several other related<lb/> symptoms, duration beyond that required by minimum diagnostic criteria, and a clear impact on<lb/> functioning (NICE, 2011).<lb/> • Severe refers to the presence of most or all symptoms of the disorder, often of long duration and<lb/> with very marked impact on functioning (for example, an inability to participate in work-related<lb/> activities and withdrawal from interpersonal activities) (NICE, 2011).<lb/> • A user / consumer / patient is a person receiving mental health care. These terms are used in<lb/> different places and by different groups of practitioners and people with mental disorders (WHO,<lb/> 2011).<lb/> • Family comprises members of the families of persons with mental disorders who act as carers<lb/> (WHO, 2011).<lb/> • Mental health policy: The official statement of a government conveying an organized set of<lb/> values, principles, objectives and areas for action to improve the mental health of a population<lb/> (WHO, 2011).<lb/> • Mental health strategy/plan: A detailed pre-formulated scheme that details the strategies and<lb/> activities that will be implemented to realize the objectives of the policy. It also specifies other<lb/> crucial elements such as the budget and timeframe for implementing strategies and activities and<lb/> specific targets that will be met. The plan also clarifies the roles of different stakeholders<lb/> involved in the implementation of activities defined within the mental health plan. Mental health<lb/> programmes are included within the mental health plan category. A mental health programme is a<lb/> targeted intervention, usually short-term, with a highly focused objective for the promotion of<lb/> mental health, the prevention of mental disorders, and treatment and rehabilitation (WHO, 2011).<lb/> • Mental health legislation: Mental health legislation may cover a broad array of issues including<lb/> access to mental health care and other services, quality of mental health care, admission to mental<lb/> health facilities, consent to treatment, freedom from cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment,<lb/> freedom from discrimination, the enjoyment of a full range of civil, cultural, economic, political<lb/> and social rights, and provisions for legal mechanisms to promote and protect human rights (e.g.<lb/> review bodies to oversee admission and treatment to mental health facilities, monitoring bodies to<lb/> inspect human rights conditions in facilities and complaints mechanisms) (WHO, 2011).<lb/> • Psychiatrist: A medical doctor who has had at least two years of post-graduate training in<lb/> psychiatry at a recognized teaching institution leading to a recognized degree or diploma (WHO,<lb/> 2011).<lb/> • Nurse: A health professional who has completed formal training in nursing at a recognized,<lb/> university-level school for a diploma or degree in nursing (WHO, 2011).<lb/> • Psychologist: A health professional who has completed formal training in psychology at a<lb/> recognized, university-level school for a diploma or degree in psychology (WHO, 2011).<lb/> • Social worker: A health professional who has completed formal training in social work at a<lb/> recognized, university-level school for a diploma or degree in social work (WHO, 2011).<lb/> • Mental health outpatient facility: A facility that specifically focuses on the management of<lb/> mental disorders and related clinical problems on an outpatient basis. These facilities are staffed<lb/> with health care providers specifically trained in mental health (WHO, 2011).<lb/> • Mental health day treatment facility: A facility that provides care for users during the day. The<lb/> facilities are generally available to groups of users at the same time and expect users to stay at the<lb/> facilities beyond the periods during which they have face-to-face contact with staff and / or<lb/> participate in therapy activities. Attendance typically ranges from a half to one full day (4 – 8<lb/> hours), for one or more days of the week (WHO, 2011).<lb/> • Psychiatric ward in a general hospital: A ward within a general hospital that is reserved for the<lb/> care of persons with mental disorders (WHO, 2011).<lb/> • Community residential facility: A non-hospital, community based mental health facility that<lb/> provides overnight residence for people with mental disorders. Usually these facilities serve users<lb/> with relatively stable mental disorders not requiring intensive medical interventions (WHO,<lb/> 2011).<lb/> • Mental hospital: A specialized hospital-based facility that provides inpatient care and long-stay<lb/> residential services for people with severe mental disorders. Usually these facilities are<lb/> independent and standalone, although they may have some links with the rest of the health care<lb/> system. The level of specialization varies considerably; in some cases only long stay custodial<lb/> services are offered, in others specialized and short-term services are also available (WHO,<lb/> 2011).<lb/> • Forensic units: forensic units care for people with mental disorders who have come into contact<lb/> with the criminal justice system. They may also be called secure units or special hospitals (WHO,<lb/> 2008).<lb/> • Community mental health services: secondary or specialist care (care that cannot be provided by<lb/> a primary care physician). At its most basic, it may be office-based private care or, more often,<lb/> outpatient clinic (polyclinic) provision for assessing and treating mental illness by a trained<lb/> mental health professional (such as a psychiatrist or psychologist). It can also be provided by a<lb/> multidisciplinary team (community mental health team) comprising psychiatrists, mental health<lb/> nurses and often psychologists and social workers. They usually provide care for the inhabitants<lb/> of a clearly defined catchment area (such as a borough or town). Care is provided in a variety of<lb/> settings (such as clinics, people&apos;s homes and day centres). An alternative structure is the<lb/> community mental health centre, where several teams run a range of services, one of which is<lb/> assessment and care outside the hospital (WHO, 2008).<lb/> • Secure psychiatric beds &quot; Secure mental health services provide accommodation, treatment and<lb/> support for people with severe mental health problems who pose a risk to the public. Sometimes<lb/> known as &apos;forensic&apos; mental health services, secure services work predominantly with people who<lb/> have been imprisoned or admitted &quot; directly to hospital through the 1983 Mental Health Act<lb/> following a criminal offence.</p>

			<head>(Centre for Mental Health, 2011)<lb/></head>

			<p>• Stigma: A stigma is a distinguishing mark establishing a demarcation between the stigmatized<lb/> person and others attributing negative characteristics to this person. The stigma attached to<lb/> mental illness often leads to social exclusion and discrimination and creates an additional burden<lb/> for the affected individual (WHO, 2008).<lb/> • Prevention: Mental disorder prevention focuses on reducing risk factors and enhancing protective<lb/> factors associated with mental ill health with the aim of reducing the risk, incidence, prevalence<lb/> and recurrence of mental disorders (WHO, 2008).<lb/> • Primary health care (PHC): Encompasses any health clinic that offers the first point of entry into<lb/> the health system. These clinics usually provide initial assessment and treatment for common<lb/> health conditions and refer those requiring more specialized diagnosis and treatment to facilities<lb/> with staff with a higher level of training and resources (WHO, 2011).<lb/></p>
