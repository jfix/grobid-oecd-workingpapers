            <table>Overall, these Active Learning Classrooms yielded very positive responses from instructors and<lb/> students. The instructors who were interviewed enjoyed teaching in the rooms so much that their only<lb/> concern was a fear of not being able to continue to teach in these new learning spaces. Similarly, more<lb/> than 85% of students recommended the Active Learning Classrooms for other classes. Instructors and<lb/> students overwhelmingly found that this space made a difference for them. &quot; I love this space! It makes<lb/> me feel appreciated as a student, and I feel intellectually invigorated when I work and learn in it. 9<lb/> The studio space is also a significant investment and so must clearly improve learning outcomes:<lb/> engagement, attitude and collaboration in addition to absorption of the curriculum. Measures of<lb/> those outcomes are necessarily qualitative at this point, but based on comments from student and<lb/> faculty who actually learned and taught in the space, we would cautiously say that the studio has<lb/> met those goals. Of course we will need to continue to evaluate progress in outcomes as people gain<lb/> experience with using the space. 10</table>
