			<head>RÉSUMÉ<lb/></head>

			<figure>Les matières premières sont essentielles pour l&apos;économie mondiale et le développement futur dépend<lb/> de leur approvisionnement continu. Comme les combustibles fossiles, les minerais ne sont pas<lb/> renouvelables. Par ailleurs, leurs dépôts dans la croûte terrestre sont, en général, regroupés<lb/> géographiquement, faisant ainsi de la sécurité de l&apos;approvisionnement un risque potentiel. Dans de<lb/> nombreux cas en effet, pour ce qui est des pays industrialisés, l&apos;épuisement des réserves en minerais<lb/> économiquement compétitifs a rendu l&apos;approvisionnement en matières premières une activité de plus en<lb/> plus dépendante de la stabilité politique des pays émergents riches en minerais. Dans le même temps, la<lb/> demande croissante de ces marchés émergents, mais aussi les nouvelles technologies qui nécessitent de<lb/> grandes quantités de minerais rares, ainsi qu&apos;une faible substituabilité dans leurs applications concrètes et<lb/> des taux de recyclage faibles, ont rendu les économies plus vulnérables aux éventuelles ruptures<lb/> d&apos;approvisionnement. Par conséquent les décideurs dans plusieurs pays et régions de l&apos;OCDE ont<lb/> commandé des rapports qui évaluent la vulnérabilité de leurs économies respectives face à des<lb/> perturbations dans l&apos;approvisionnement en minerais. L&apos;objectif commun d&apos;un grand nombre de ces études<lb/> est l&apos;identification d&apos;une liste de soi-disant «minerais critiques», définis comme les minerais pour lesquels<lb/> le risque de perturbations de l&apos;approvisionnement est relativement élevé et pour lesquels les ruptures en<lb/> approvisionnement seront associées à de grands impacts économiques.<lb/> Le but de ce rapport est de réaliser pour la première fois une analyse des minerais essentiels pour les<lb/> pays de l&apos;OCDE dans son ensemble. Cette analyse est un état des lieux à la date d&apos;aujourd&apos;hui, comme les<lb/> rapports précédents l&apos;ont fait. En outre, l&apos;étude propose aussi une projection à l&apos;an 2030 afin d&apos;analyser<lb/> quelle incidence peuvent avoir les tendances dans le développement économique sur tel ou tel minerai à<lb/> long terme. 51 minerais différents sont inclus dans notre analyse. Trois mesures d&apos;analyse du risque<lb/> d&apos;approvisionnement en minerais sont utilisées: la substituabilité, les taux de recyclage et la concentration<lb/> de la production dans les pays qui sont jugés par les ensembles de données internationales pour être<lb/> relativement instables politiquement. La rareté physique d&apos;un minerai ne doit pas être considérée comme<lb/> une source de risque pour l&apos;approvisionnement, au moins à court terme. Bien que la nature non<lb/> renouvelable d&apos;un minerai soit une contrainte éventuelle sur les quantités qui peuvent être extraites, les<lb/> réserves sont généralement de grande taille et les mécanismes du marché fonctionnent pour atténuer le<lb/> problème. Les perturbations potentielles sont plutôt à anticiper du côté du lien qui existe entre la<lb/> concentration de la production et les risques géopolitiques. Il est également peu probable que la rareté<lb/> physique d&apos;un minerai ait une incidence sur le risque d&apos;approvisionnement, au moins pour ce qui est de la<lb/> période allant jusqu&apos;à 2030, mais le rapport prévoit toutefois un tel scénario en introduisant à l&apos;indice de<lb/> risque d&apos;approvisionnement une mesure du nombre d&apos;années pour prévoir l&apos;épuisement des réserves. La<lb/> vulnérabilité en matière de risque d&apos;approvisionnement -à savoir « l&apos;importance économique» d&apos;un minerai<lb/> -est plus difficile à estimer et il n&apos;y a pas de consensus entre les études existantes. Ce rapport examine<lb/> comment chaque minerai est utilisé dans différents secteurs et il montre ainsi l&apos;importance économique de<lb/> ces secteurs sur l&apos;économie dans son ensemble.<lb/> L&apos;analyse identifie autour de 12 à 20 minerais ou groupes de minerais qui sont essentiels aux pays de<lb/> l&apos;OCDE aujourd&apos;hui. Des minerais comme les terres rares (aussi bien lourds que légères), le germanium et<lb/> le graphite naturel présentent un risque particulièrement élevé en approvisionnement, tandis que les<lb/> minerais tels que la barytine, le tungstène et le vanadium sont particulièrement importants sur le plan<lb/> économique. A l&apos;horizon 2030, on peut supposer qu&apos;un rôle plus important sera accordé à la disponibilité<lb/> physique des réserves pour déterminer les lieux de production, ce qui entraînera un risque accru en<lb/> approvisionnement pour la baryte, le borate, le phosphate et le molybdène. En outre, le développement<lb/> économique basé sur un scénario de référence qui suppose une dépendance continue aux combustibles<lb/> fossiles pour l&apos;approvisionnement en énergie ne change pas de manière significative le modèle de<lb/> développement économique des différents minerais concernés. Les travaux futurs devraient évaluer si cela<lb/> ENV/WKP(2015)12<lb/> est également vrai si l&apos;on s&apos;engage vers une croissance verte à faible émission en carbone. Enfin, le rapport<lb/> montre quel amélioration de la substituabilité des minerais et de leur taux de recyclage seraient nécessaire<lb/> aujourd&apos;hui et plus important encore en 2030 pour atténuer les risques d&apos;approvisionnement et de la<lb/> vulnérabilité face à cela. Cela pourrait être une priorité pour l&apos;investissement public en R &amp; D au sein des<lb/> pays de l&apos;OCDE. Les résultats restent toutefois très spécifiques pour chaque minerai car certains minerais<lb/> ayant de très faibles sources d&apos;approvisionnement nécessitent d&apos;énormes augmentations de substituabilité et<lb/> / ou de recyclage tandis que d&apos;autres ne nécessitent que de petites améliorations dans leur exploitation.<lb/> Mots clés : Matériaux critiques, minéraux critiques, rareté des ressources, recyclage, récupération des<lb/> matériaux, sécurité matérielle, économie circulaire<lb/> Classification JEL: Q320, Q370, O130, F690<lb/> ENV/WKP(2015)12<lb/></figure>

			<head>1. INTRODUCTION 1<lb/></head>

			<p>Raw materials are essential for the global economy and future development depends on their<lb/> continued supply. Covering a large variety of resources from metals to fossil fuels, raw materials enter the<lb/> economic system through a similarly large variety of applications. Coal, oil and natural gas continue to<lb/> dominate the global economy&apos;s primary energy mix. Tin is used in steel containers and electrical circuits,<lb/> nickel for plating and copper for electrical applications, phosphorus and potassium are used as soil<lb/> fertilizers, rare earth elements (REEs) are central in information and communications technologies and<lb/> green technologies, and germanium, gallium and antimony are used in semi-conductors.<lb/> While much attention has been paid to whether the supply of fossil fuels can (and should) meet energy<lb/> demand now and in the future, global consumption of non-energy minerals increased markedly in the<lb/> second half of the 20 th century and particularly during the last two to three decades, where it outstripped<lb/> growth in fossil energy carriers (<ref type="biblio">Krausmann et al., 2009</ref>). This trend is likely to accelerate with demands<lb/> for a green-growth transition, as many environmental technologies depend crucially on rare minerals.<lb/> Like fossil fuels, minerals are non-renewable. In general, their deposits in the Earth&apos;s crust are also<lb/> geographically clustered, making security of supply a potential risk. In many cases, the exhaustion of<lb/> economically competitive minerals deposits in industrialised countries has made supplies increasingly<lb/> dependent on the political stability of mineral-rich emerging economies. At the same time, increasing<lb/> demand from these emerging markets, new technologies that require large amounts of rare minerals<lb/> (DERA, 2012), low substitutability in applications and low rates of recycling have made economies more<lb/> vulnerable to potential supply disruptions.<lb/></p>

			<head>Box1</head>

			<table>.<lb/> What is the relevance of material criticality to the CIRCLE project<lb/> Further degradation of the environment and natural capital compromises prospects for future economic growth<lb/> and human well-being. Without more ambitious policies, the costs and consequences of inaction on important<lb/> environmental challenges such as climate change, biodiversity loss, water scarcity and health impacts of pollution will<lb/> be significant.<lb/> The OECD&apos;s &quot; Cost of Inaction and Resource Scarcity; Consequences for Long-term Economic Growth &quot;<lb/> (CIRCLE) project aims at identifying how feedbacks from poor environmental quality, climatic change and natural<lb/> resource scarcity are likely to affect economic growth in the coming decades.<lb/> This report contributes to the resource scarcity track of the CIRCLE project. Considerations of material criticality<lb/> are relevant to this work, as supply shocks resulting from disruptions of trade, or sudden surges in demand for certain<lb/> minerals resulting from technological innovation can be expected to impact economic outcomes. This report provides<lb/> insights into the materials and sectors that may potentially be affected by such shocks, as well as the policies that may<lb/> be helpful in mitigating their effects.<lb/></table>

			<p>Consequently policy-makers in several countries and regions – for example, France, Germany, the<lb/> EU, UK and US – have commissioned reports to assess the vulnerability of their respective economies to<lb/> disruptions in the supply of minerals. A common aim of many of these studies is the identification of a list<lb/> of so-called &apos;critical minerals&apos;, defined as minerals for which the risk of disruptions in supply is relatively<lb/> high and for which supply disruptions will be associated with large economic impacts, i.e. high<lb/> vulnerability. The purpose of this report is to perform for the first time an analysis of critical minerals for<lb/> the OECD countries as a whole. In addition, this is done not only today, as previous reports have done, but<lb/> also in 2030, in order to form an initial picture of how possible trends in economic development will affect<lb/> which minerals are critical in the long-run future. 51 different minerals are included in our analysis, listed<lb/> in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<p>Three measures of mineral supply risk are used: substitutability, recycling rates and the concentration<lb/> of production in countries that are judged by international datasets to be relatively politically unstable.<lb/> Physical scarcity is not considered to be a source of supply risk, certainly in the short term. While the non-<lb/>renewable nature of minerals is an eventual constraint on what can be extracted, reserves are generally<lb/> large and market mechanisms work to alleviate the problem. Increased scarcity stimulates price<lb/> adjustments, which trigger technological development, new exploration, higher recycling efforts and the<lb/> search for substitutes. Potential disruptions are instead perceived to come from the nexus of production<lb/> concentration and geopolitical risks. It is also rather unlikely that physical scarcity will affect supply risk in<lb/> the period up to 2030, but the report does allow for such a scenario by introducing to the index of supply<lb/> risk a measure of the number of years to forecast depletion of reserves.<lb/> Vulnerability to supply risk – i.e. the &apos;economic importance&apos; of a mineral – is more challenging to<lb/> estimate and there is no consensus among existing studies. One key study quantified economic importance<lb/> ENV/WKP(2015)12<lb/> specific, with some minerals requiring huge increases in substitutability and/or recycling from a low base,<lb/> while others require only small improvements.<lb/></p>

			<p>There are numerous limitations to this analysis and it should consequently be seen as exploratory.<lb/> Measuring economic importance convincingly on the one hand and systematically for large numbers of<lb/> minerals across many countries on the other hand, appears vital. An important message to emerge from an<lb/> evaluation of the limitations of the report is that most of them stem from a severe shortage of data on<lb/> minerals supply and use, which makes a systematic comparison of criticality across a wide range of<lb/> minerals very difficult to achieve. Economic importance is the leading example of this.<lb/></p>

			<p>Therefore a key conclusion of the report is that there is an urgent need to improve the availability to<lb/> researchers and public policy-makers of data on the main components of minerals supply risk and use,<lb/> globally.<lb/></p>

			<head>2. IDENTIFYING CRITICAL MINERALS<lb/> 2.1 An emerging framework for identifying critical minerals: supply risk versus economic<lb/> importance<lb/></head>

			<p>In recent years, the rapid increase in minerals use has motivated significant interest in systematically<lb/> analysing their scarcity. As a consequence, several studies have been published, which attempt to do so<lb/> across a wide range of minerals and for a particular economy in focus.<lb/></p>

			<p>These studies by and large share a common framework that defines a mineral as critical, relative to<lb/> other minerals, if it is characterised by both high supply risks and high vulnerability to a restriction on<lb/> supply (<ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>). Some studies add a third dimension that accounts for the environmental implications of<lb/> mineral extraction and use (see <ref type="biblio">Graedel et al., 2012</ref>).<lb/> The philosophy behind this approach seeks to strike a balance between using &apos;hard&apos; data and rigorous<lb/> theory on the one hand and exercising judgement on the other hand, because at the heart of the analyst&apos;s<lb/> problem in identifying critical minerals is the disconnect between the scope of what policy-makers would<lb/> like to know and the severe shortage of comparable data on minerals. In the words of one of the chief<lb/> developers of the framework, &quot; a balance has been sought between analytical rigor and data availability to<lb/> evaluate the criticality of as many metals as possible and to draw attention to cases for which data are<lb/> simply not adequate &quot; (<ref type="biblio">Graedel et al., 2012, p1064</ref>).<lb/> Minerals, Critical Minerals, and the US Economy was a report by the specially established<lb/> &apos;Committee on Critical Mineral Impacts on the U.S. Economy&apos; of the National Research Council of the<lb/> National Academies (2008). The motivation behind the study is typical of this emerging literature, namely<lb/> the concern &quot; that the impacts of potential restrictions on the supply of nonfuel minerals to different sectors<lb/> of the US economy were not adequately articulated in the national discussion on natural resource use &quot; (p2).<lb/> To analyse minerals criticality, the Committee proposed a &apos;Criticality Matrix&apos; much like <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>, placing<lb/> a measure of supply risk on one axis and a measure of the impact of a supply fluctuation (i.e. whether the<lb/> mineral is essential in use) on the other axis. Having analysed a set of 11 minerals within this framework,<lb/> the study found that for the US economy at the time, indium, manganese, niobium, platinum group metals<lb/> (PGMs), and the rare earth elements were critical.<lb/></p>

			<p>The European Commission published its own analysis of minerals criticality in 2010 – Critical Raw<lb/> Materials for the EU (<ref type="biblio">European Commission, 2010</ref>) – and updated it in 2014 (<ref type="biblio">European Commission,<lb/> 2014</ref>). The 2010 report proposed a framework for identifying critical minerals that comprised three<lb/> dimensions. Like the US study it analysed supply risk on the one hand and a measure of the &apos;economic<lb/> importance&apos; – to use the EU terminology – of a mineral on the other hand, but in addition it included a<lb/> third measure, environmental risk. To be precise, this was an indicator of &quot; the risks that measures might be<lb/> taken by countries with the intention of protecting the environment and by doing so endangering the supply<lb/> of raw materials to the European Union &quot; (<ref type="biblio">European Commission, 2010, p29</ref>). 2 A critical mineral was then<lb/> a mineral that scored highly on the measure of economic importance, as well as on the measure of supply<lb/> risk and/or environmental risk. However, since environmental risk was not found in practice to<lb/> significantly determine minerals criticality, it was dropped in the 2014 update. Out of 54 materials studied<lb/> in 2014, 20 were identified as critical for the EU: antimony, beryllium, borates, chromium, cobalt, coking<lb/> coal, fluorspar, gallium, germanium, indium, magnesite, magnesium, natural graphite, niobium, PGMs,<lb/> phosphate rock, heavy and light rare earth elements, silicon metal, and tungsten.<lb/> Another study in this tradition was carried out for the UK economy by Oakdene Hollins (2008);<lb/> Material Security: Ensuring Resource Availability for the UK Economy. This report relied on a two-<lb/>dimensional analysis of supply risk against &apos;material risk&apos;, where material risk can be given various<lb/> interpretations or indicators, including those in line with measuring economic vulnerability to fluctuations<lb/> in supply, i.e. global consumption levels and availability of substitutes, and those more similar to<lb/> environmental risk, i.e. contribution to global warming (in terms of Global Warming Potential). Out of<lb/> ENV/WKP(2015)12<lb/> 69 materials analysed, seven were identified as being most critical or &apos;insecure&apos; in the language of the<lb/> report. These were gold, rhodium, platinum, strontium, silver, antimony and tin.<lb/></p>

			<p>The sets of minerals identified as being critical differ across these studies depending not only on the<lb/> economy in focus (e.g. UK versus US), but also on the specific research design, i.e. how the general<lb/> framework introduced at the start of this section is put into operation. A key difference between the studies<lb/> is the number of dimensions (two or three) and in what each dimension is taken to mean. In addition,<lb/> another important source of difference is in how the performance of a mineral on each dimension is<lb/> quantified. Erdmann and Graedel (2011) provide a review.<lb/></p>

			<head>2.2 This study<lb/></head>

			<p>This study of critical minerals for the OECD countries builds upon the framework discussed above. A<lb/> mineral is defined as critical if it is of high economic importance and its supply is associated with<lb/> significant risk. The reportparticularly draws on the latest report for the EU (<ref type="biblio">European Commission, 2014</ref>),<lb/> because it is relatively well rooted in &apos;objective&apos;, quantitative data, and because the approach is practicable<lb/> for large numbers of minerals and many countries, given the current availability of data. However, because<lb/> the scope of the analysis extends beyond the present day to 2030, the report builds on the framework by<lb/> incorporating dynamic considerations, i.e. changes over time in the supply risk attending to and economic<lb/> importance of minerals.<lb/></p>

			<p>Several robustness checks are also carried-out, analysing how different measures of supply risk relate<lb/> to each other, how the analysis changes if alternative measures of political stability are used, and how it<lb/> might change if an alternative measure of economic importance would be used for all minerals (we can<lb/> only make this particular comparison for a limited number of minerals and only for the US). The general<lb/> methodology is represented in <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<head>2.2.1 Supply risk<lb/></head>

			<p>Following the European Commission (2014) study, supply risk is quantified on the basis of the<lb/> following formula:<lb/></p>

			<table>ENV/WKP(2015)12<lb/> 14<lb/> (1) í µí±í µí±í µí±í µí±í µí±í µí± í µí±í µí±í µí±í µí± í µí± = í µí¼ í µí± (1 − í µí¼ í µí± ) ∑ (í µí± í µí± í µí± ) 2 í µí±í µí±í µí±í µí±í µí±í µí±í µí± í µí±<lb/> í µí±<lb/> where:<lb/> i – mineral<lb/> s – sector<lb/> c – country<lb/> í µí¼ í µí± – Substitutability = ∑ í µí°´íµí°´í µí±í µí± í µí¼ í µí±í µí±<lb/> í µí±<lb/> , where í µí°´íµí°´í µí±í µí± is the share of consumption of mineral I in end-use<lb/> sector s<lb/> í µí¼ í µí± – Recycling rate<lb/> í µí± í µí±í µí± – Production shares by country<lb/> í µí±í µí±í µí±í µí±í µí±í µí±í µí± í µí± – Economic and political stability by country<lb/></table>

			<p>The supply risk index is high if a mineral has few substitutes (a high í µí¼ í µí± means that few substitutes<lb/> exist), if its rate of recycling is low, and if its production is concentrated in politically unstable countries.<lb/></p>

			<figure>Substitutability and recycling: two major factors that can mitigate supply risk in the framework<lb/> introduced above are substitutability and recycling. The existence of substitutes reduces suppliers&apos; market<lb/> power, while high recycling rates create an alternative source of supply. 3 Both substitutability and<lb/> recycling depend heavily on R&amp;D, which can be strongly influenced by policy-makers.<lb/> Recycling rates are defined as the &apos;End-of-life Recycling Input Rate&apos;. This is a measure of &quot; the<lb/> proportion of metal and metal products that are produced from End-of-Life scrap and other metal-bearing<lb/> low grade residues worldwide &quot; (European Commission, 2014). 4 The substitutability index is based on<lb/> expert judgment, with values taken from European Commission (2014). In that study, substitutes are not<lb/> explicitly identified for each material.<lb/></figure>

			<p>In attempting to project the set of critical minerals in 2030, the substitutability and recycling rates for<lb/> all minerals are held constant at current levels. This assumption is very unlikely to hold as a description of<lb/> the economic baseline, but it allows for an important policy question to be explored: by separating out the<lb/> impact of baseline changes in exogenous production and political-risk factors, which might be seen to be<lb/> reasonably outside the control of OECD resources policies, &quot; necessary &quot; rates of substitutability and<lb/> recycling can be identified in order to make critical minerals less critical. These &quot; necessary &quot; rates are thus<lb/> not predicted values; instead they serve as targets for policies aiming at mitigating criticality (coming from<lb/> high supply risk).<lb/></p>

			<head>Production shares by country</head>

			<p>: the supply-risk index of this report accounts for the concentration of<lb/> production/reserves by incorporating a modified Herfindahl-Hirschman index for each mineral. The<lb/> Herfindahl-Hirschman index is traditionally used as a measure of the size of firms with respect to the<lb/> industry they belong to. Here we consider countries rather than firms.<lb/></p>

			<p>The global distribution of economically exploitable mineral deposits (reserves) is highly asymmetric<lb/> due to the lack of homogeneity of geological structures in the Earth&apos;s crust. These natural differences mean<lb/> that production is often concentrated, which in turn can lead to strategic limitations to trade, creating large<lb/> economic uncertainties. China, for instance, accounts for 91% of REE production, 84% of tungsten<lb/> production and South Africa represents 73% of platinum production (USGS, 2014). <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>			<figure>presents an<lb/> extended list of minerals, where production is highly concentrated.<lb/> 3<lb/> It should be noted, however, that attention must be given to the criticality of substitutes.<lb/> 4<lb/> As Graedel et al. (2011) discuss, the calculation of EOL-RIRs is difficult at the country level due to the<lb/> lack of information about the recycled content of imported produced metals. This measure is also known as<lb/> &quot; Recycled Content &quot; .<lb/> ENV/WKP(2015)12<lb/></figure>

			<p>A particular challenge is to project the global distribution of production of minerals in 2030. The size<lb/> of reserves is a candidate for quantifying the longer-run availability of a mineral, especially when<lb/> compared to the level of current production/consumption. In particular, one possibility is a static lifetime<lb/> measure, which identifies how many years of reserves are left given current rates of<lb/> production/consumption.<lb/> Most minerals are abundant on the planet, but technology only allows extraction from the Earth&apos;s<lb/> crust. This substantially reduces the total recoverable resources. Resources represent the entire physical<lb/> quantity of a mineral. They thus include already discovered, estimated stocks, as well as undiscovered<lb/> resources. Reserves are generally understood as the proven quantity of a resource that is recoverable at<lb/> today&apos;s prices with today&apos;s technology and which is legally mineable. The relationship between<lb/> undiscovered resources, identified resources, and reserves is illustrated in <ref type="figure">Figure</ref> 3.<lb/> ENV/WKP(2015)12<lb/> Figure 3. Relationship between reserves and resources<lb/></figure>

			<p>A widely recognised problem with using reserves and static lifetime measures is, however, that they<lb/> can motivate misleading conclusions. Reserves are by definition endogenously determined and therefore<lb/> they are not fixed. They can thus grow over time, for example tungsten reserves grew by a factor of one<lb/> and a half, and REEs by 27%, between 2000 and 2013 (USGS, 2014). Forecasts based on such measures<lb/> are as a consequence highly unreliable, as <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref> illustrates for copper and nickel.<lb/> In fact, both reserves and resource estimates are subject to upward revision due to exploration and<lb/> discoveries. Exploration depends on the expected benefits of discoveries that vary with future minerals<lb/> prices, on the probability of finding new deposits (which is negatively correlated with past exploration),<lb/> and on exploration costs. High minerals prices thus stimulate both exploration and extraction. Discoveries<lb/> and technical progress in extractive technologies explain why the reserves estimates of most minerals<lb/> increased over the course of the last century, despite massive extraction.<lb/></p>

			<head>Source: Critical Metals Handbook (2014) &quot; Metal Resources, Use and Criticality<lb/></head>

			<p>Complete depletion is currently irrelevant for most minerals (see e.g. <ref type="biblio">Cathles, 2010</ref>). As a<lb/> consequence, existing studies do not put much emphasis on physical availability per se. The EU and UK<lb/> studies do not include the measure in their estimates, while the US study concludes that physical<lb/> availability is only meaningful in combination with other parameters.<lb/></p>

			<p>Given all of this, the report takes two different approaches to projecting production shares by country<lb/> in 2030. First, it uses the distribution of reserves instead of the distribution of production, on the grounds<lb/> that, in the longer run, production-related supply risks can be predicted by the current distribution of<lb/> reserves. However, since using reserve measures in isolation can be a misleading indicator of resource<lb/> scarcity as just discussed, the report augments formula (1) with the current production/reserves ratio:<lb/></p>

			<figure>(2) í µí±í µí±í µí±í µí±í µí±í µí± í µí±í µí±í µí±í µí± í µí± = í µí¼ í µí± (1 − í µí¼ í µí± ) ∑ (í µí± í µí± í µí± ) 2 í µí±í µí±í µí±í µí±í µí±í µí±í µí± í µí±<lb/> í µí±<lb/> (50 *<lb/> í µí±í µí±í µí±í µí±í µí±í µí±í µí±í µí± í µí±í µí± í µí±<lb/> í µí±í µí±í µí±í µí±í µí±í µí±í µí±í µí± í µí±<lb/> ) 1/2<lb/></figure>

			<p>This approach assumes that countries continue to produce the same share of their reserves, meaning<lb/> that the distribution of production gradually converges towards the distribution of reserves as resources are<lb/> depleted. This specific functional form was chosen in order to keep results comparable to the original index<lb/> values. The added multiplying factor thus ensures that the index remains unchanged if the production-to-<lb/>reserves ratio equals 1/50, implying that existing reserves are enough to satisfy the current rate of<lb/> production rate for exactly 50 more years. Minerals with less than 50 years of reserves will, in other words,<lb/> be given a relatively higher supply risk value and vice versa.<lb/></p>

			<head>Economic and political stability</head>

			<p>: in recent years, production of minerals and the concentration of<lb/> remaining reserves have shifted from Europe and the United States to emerging and developing economies.<lb/> This trend can be explained by the increasing minerals requirements of emerging economies, as well as the<lb/> depletion of competitive resource deposits in countries that industrialised first. But some developing<lb/> economies are less politically stable than their industrialised counterparts. This shift in production has<lb/> ENV/WKP(2015)12<lb/> therefore meant that the political stability of producer countries has become an important parameter when<lb/> quantifying the supply security of minerals.<lb/></p>

			<table>Three different indices are being used to measure political stability and limits to minerals trade:<lb/> 1.<lb/> World Government Indicators (WGI, 2014): this source, which is used for the main results in<lb/> Section 3, includes indicators on: voice and accountability; political stability; government<lb/> effectiveness; regulatory quality; rule of law, and; control of corruption. Data are from the World<lb/> Bank.<lb/> 2.<lb/> Political Risk Services (PRS<ref type="biblio">, 2014</ref>) from the International Country Risk Guide (ICRG): the ICRG<lb/> offers an index on government stability. This index, which is introduced when carrying out<lb/> robustness checks in Section 4, is based on expert assessments of both the government&apos;s ability to<lb/> carry out its declared program, and its ability to stay in office.<lb/> 3.<lb/></p>

			<table>The Open Market Index (OMI, 2014): this measures openness to trade and consists of the following<lb/> subcomponents: trade openness; trade policy; Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) openness, and; trade<lb/> enabling infrastructure. The International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) provides the data. Again,<lb/> this measure isused in performing robustness checks in Section 4.<lb/></table>

			<head>2.2.2 Economic importance<lb/></head>

			<p>Again taking the European Commission (2014) study as the starting point, the economic importance<lb/> of minerals is defined as follows:<lb/></p>

			<p>(</p>

			<table>3) í µí°¸í µí°¸í µí±í µí°¸í µí±í µí°¸í µí±í µí°¸íµí°¸í µí°¼í µí°¸í µí±í µí±í µí°¼í µí±í µí±í µí°¸í µí°¸í µí°¼ í µí± =<lb/> 1<lb/> ∑ í µí± í µí±<lb/> í µí±<lb/> ∑ í µí°´íµí°´í µí±í µí± í µí± í µí±<lb/> í µí±<lb/> where:<lb/> i – mineral<lb/> s – sector<lb/> í µí± í µí± -Gross value added (GVA) of sector s<lb/> í µí°´íµí°´í µí±í µí± -The share of consumption of mineral i in end–use sector s<lb/></table>

			<p>A mineral that is used heavily in a sector that constitutes a large part of the economy will thus have a<lb/> relatively high economic importance index value.<lb/> It is important to note that this methodology does not directly capture the value added by specific<lb/> minerals and the economic importance index should therefore be interpreted with caution. A mineral can<lb/> thus in practice be very important for a sector&apos;s output, despite the sector only accounting for a relatively<lb/> small share of the total quantity consumed.<lb/> To make the economic importance measure dynamic, the report uses OECD modelling of baseline<lb/> economic growth to 2030, performed with the ENV-LINKAGES computable general equilibrium model,<lb/> to project structural change and the future sectoral composition of the OECD economies. The relative<lb/> importance of sectors thus changes and this alters the economic importance of minerals. The end-use<lb/> breakdown of minerals by sector is assumed fixed at current levels.<lb/> ENV/WKP(2015)12<lb/></p>

			<head>2.2.3 Long-list of minerals, and data sources<lb/></head>

			<p>The report assesses which of 51 minerals are critical for the OECD countries. The long-list of<lb/> minerals includes: aluminium, antimony, barytes, bauxite, bentonite, beryllium, borate, chromium, clays,<lb/> cobalt, coking coal, copper, diatomite, feldspar, fluorspar, gallium, germanium, gold, gypsum, hafnium,<lb/> indium, iron ore, limestone, lithium, magnesite, magnesium, manganese, molybdenum, natural graphite,<lb/> nickel, niobium, perlite, PGMs, phosphate rock, potash, REE (heavy), REE (light), rhenium, scandium,<lb/> selenium, silica sand, silicon metal, silver, talc, tantalum, tellurium, tin, titanium, tungsten, vanadium, and<lb/> zinc.<lb/> Following the US study (National Research Council of the National <ref type="biblio">Academies, 2008</ref>) and the EU<lb/> studies (<ref type="biblio">European Commission, 2010; 2014)</ref>, some elements are grouped together into the Platinum Group<lb/> Metals (PGMs), and some into the Rare Earth Elements (REE). PGMs include iridium, osmium, palladium,<lb/> platinum, rhodium and ruthenium. The REE group is divided into three groups: heavy rare earth elements,<lb/> light rare earth elements and scandium, following again the EU reports. The heavy rare earth elements are<lb/> europium, gadolinium, terbium, dysprosium, erbium, yttrium, holmium, thulium, ytterbium, and lutetium.<lb/> The light rare Earth elements are lanthanum, cerium, praseodymium, neodymium and samarium. While<lb/> similar properties and/or market characteristics may justify this grouping in part, a more careful analysis<lb/> would require analysing each element separately, to take account of the different levels of criticality within<lb/> these groups. Disaggregating the PGM and REE groups would require specific data for each element that is<lb/> not currently available.<lb/> Data for the analysis are taken from a range of different sources. <ref type="table">Table 3</ref> provides an overview.<lb/></p>

			<head>3. RESULTS<lb/></head>

			<p>This section presents the results of the analysis. First, estimates of the set of critical minerals today are<lb/> introduced, using the most up-to-date data (for 2012). These are built-up from estimates of supply risk,<lb/> which are then united with estimates of economic importance to obtain an overall mapping of criticality.<lb/> This serves as a benchmark for presenting changes in the set of critical minerals that are projected to occur<lb/> between now and 2030. The section concludes with a series of policy thought-experiments concerning<lb/> what recycling and substitutability changes would be needed to make critical minerals non-critical, today<lb/> and in the future.<lb/></p>

			<head>3.1 Critical minerals in OECD countries today<lb/> 3.1.1 Supply risk today<lb/></head>

			<p>The analysis begins with the index of supply risk, described above in Equation (1). <ref type="table">Table 4</ref> identifies<lb/> the ten minerals in the set of 51 with the highest value on the supply-risk index, and compares these with<lb/> some characteristics of the whole set of minerals. Supply risk data for each of the 51 minerals are listed in<lb/> Appendix 1.<lb/></p>

			<p>The minerals group with, by some margin, the highest supply risk for OECD countries today is the<lb/> heavy rare earth elements. Its value on the index is over five times that of the median (iron ore and tin<lb/> ENV/WKP(2015)12<lb/> share the median value). The heavy rare earth elements are followed by germanium, natural graphite and<lb/> the light rare earth elements.<lb/> <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref> plots the 51 minerals on two dimensions: substitutability on the one hand and political risk<lb/> on the other hand. Those minerals classified in the top ten for supply risk as per <ref type="table">Table 4</ref> are highlighted.<lb/> The minerals with the highest supply risk correspond closely with a group characterised by high<lb/> political risk, at the same time as low substitutability (i.e. a high substitutability index value). 5 This<lb/> indicates that the main drivers of supply risk are indeed these two elements of the index, rather than<lb/> recycling rates.<lb/></p>

			<figure>Figure 5. Minerals as a function of production concentration and substitutability<lb/></figure>

			<head>3.1.2 Economic importance and overall criticality today<lb/></head>

			<p>Figure 6 combines estimates of supply risk with estimates of economic importance, to achieve an<lb/> overall mapping of minerals criticality in OECD countries today. Recall that the measure of economic<lb/> importance seeks to identify minerals used heavily in sectors comprising a large share of aggregate OECD<lb/> 5<lb/></p>

			<p>Within the cluster of minerals highlighted as belonging to the top ten in terms of supply risk is tungsten,<lb/> which in fact lies just outside the top ten, i.e. twelfth.<lb/> ENV/WKP(2015)12<lb/> output. Minerals located towards the top right of <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref> are relatively critical according to the<lb/> framework.<lb/> While the heavy rare earth elements stand out in terms of supply risk, they lie only around the middle<lb/> of the distribution on the economic importance dimension. It is a similar story for germanium and the light<lb/> rare earth elements. Natural graphite is relatively more economically important, but still does not stand out<lb/> in this regard.<lb/> By contrast, the most economically important minerals in OECD countries today (i.e. the top ten) are,<lb/> in descending order: barytes; tungsten; vanadium; coking coal; chromium; zinc; bauxite; nickel; potash,<lb/> and; magnesite. But of these, only magnesite lies within the top ten on supply risk.<lb/> Some examples of where these economically important minerals are used include barytes of which<lb/> over three quarters are used in drilling fluids in oil and gas exploration; tungsten is a metal with a wide<lb/> range of uses, the largest of which is as tungsten carbide in cemented carbides, which are wear-resistant<lb/> materials used by the metalworking, mining and construction industries; vanadium is used in automobiles<lb/> and machinery as an alloy. It is also used together with aluminium in jet engines and high-speed airframes.<lb/></p>

			<p>In a framework such as this, the boundary between what is critical and what is non-critical is arbitrary.<lb/> From visual inspection of the figure, there is an axis of minerals starting with the outliers on supply risk<lb/> (most notably the heavy rare earth elements), which swings to the southeast to take in those with high, but<lb/> not extremely high, supply risk, but that have extremely high economic importance, such as barytes and<lb/> tungsten.<lb/></p>

			<p>Another approach to demarcating the set of critical minerals is to make a comparison with previous<lb/> work that has set thresholds as such, in particular the previous EU studies that identified as critical those<lb/> minerals with an economic importance index value above 0.05 and a supply risk index value above 1<lb/> (<ref type="biblio">European Commission, 2010; 2014)</ref>. Doing so identifies 21 minerals as critical for the OECD on<lb/> aggregate today: antimony; barytes; beryllium; borate; chromium; cobalt; fluorspar; gallium; germanium;<lb/> indium; magnesite; magnesium; natural graphite; niobium; PGMs; phosphate rock; REE (heavy); REE<lb/> (light); silicon metal; tungsten, and; vanadium.<lb/> ENV/WKP(2015)12<lb/> Figure 6. Critical minerals in OECD countries today<lb/></figure>

			<p>Most of the analysis is carried out for the OECD economy on aggregate, yet it is clearly important for<lb/> each OECD country to understand which minerals are critical for it alone. Our measure of supply risk is<lb/> the same for each and all OECD countries (more on this below), but economic importance may differ<lb/> across countries and regions depending on the sectoral composition of their economies. While a country-<lb/>by-country analysis is beyond the scope of this report, criticality can be compared for three major OECD<lb/> countries/regions, namely the US, Japan and the EU. The results of this analysis are presented in <ref type="figure">Figures</ref> 7<lb/> to 9.<lb/> On the horizontal axis these figures show economic importance calculated for the entire OECD, while<lb/> on the vertical axis they show economic importance for the US, Japan and EU respectively. Minerals<lb/> above (below) the 45-degree line are more (less) economically important for a given country/region than<lb/> for the OECD as a whole.<lb/> ENV/WKP(2015)12<lb/> Figure 7. Economic importance for the USA vs. the OECD as a whole, today<lb/></figure>

			<p>As <ref type="figure">Figure 7</ref> shows, there is a close relationship between which minerals are economically important<lb/> for the OECD as a whole and which are economically important for the US alone. This is explained by the<lb/> large aggregate size of the US economy relative to the rest of the OECD. The clear exception to this is<lb/> barytes, which is much more economically important for the US than it is for the aggregate OECD<lb/> economy, being heavily used in the US&apos;s large, economically important oil-extraction industry. Indeed,<lb/> from a US perspective barytes is by a long way the most economically important of the 51 minerals<lb/> analysed, according to the method we use.<lb/></p>

			<figure>ENV/WKP(2015)12<lb/> Figure 8. Economic importance for Japan vs. the OECD as a whole, today<lb/> <ref type="figure">Figure 8</ref> shows the difference between economic importance for Japan and for the OECD as a whole.<lb/> Barytes is again an outlier, for the same reason; the economic importance of this mineral to the US<lb/> dominates the OECD aggregate. Otherwise the remaining 50 minerals are much closer to the 45-degree<lb/> line that marks out a perfect correspondence between economic importance in Japan and in the aggregate<lb/> OECD, except that a trend emerges, whereby most minerals – all, in fact, except molybdenum and niobium<lb/> – are more economically important for Japan than they are for the aggregate OECD. Indeed the difference<lb/> grows, the more economically important the mineral is. That is to say, apart from barytes the largest<lb/> disparities are for minerals like coking coal and chromium, which are also among the most economically<lb/> important minerals to either the OECD or Japan.<lb/></p>

			<p>To complete this set of regional comparisons, <ref type="figure">Figure 9</ref> plots economic importance today for the EU<lb/> versus the OECD. With the by-now familiar exception of barytes, it is clear that there is a particularly close<lb/> correspondence between which minerals are economically important in the EU and which are<lb/> economically important for the aggregate OECD, with most data points close to the 45-degree line. Like<lb/> for Japan, the majority of minerals are marginally more economically important for the EU than they are<lb/> for the aggregate OECD. This is the converse of what we observe for the US, showing how some of the<lb/> large OECD economies offset each other in the aggregate data.<lb/></p>

			<figure>ENV/WKP(2015)12<lb/> Figure 9. Economic importance for the EU vs. the OECD as a whole, today<lb/></figure>

			<p>Figures 7 to 9 suggest that estimates of which minerals are economically important do vary across<lb/> OECD countries according to the structure of their economies and these country/region differences should<lb/> be understood by policy-makers and accounted for when evaluating the consequences of supply<lb/> disruptions. Nonetheless only a relatively few major disparities are apparent, most notably barytes.<lb/> It is important to note, however, that one of the limitations associated with the measure of economic<lb/> importance is the country-invariant breakdown of minerals by end-use sectors, which may differ across<lb/> countries in reality. For example, barytes is extensively used as a weighting agent in oil-and gas-well<lb/> drilling fluids and thus is especially important for the mining sector in economies rich in oil. But its share<lb/> in this sector may be lower in other economies. Following this logic, barytes may be even less<lb/> economically important in the EU and Japan than Figures 8 and 9 suggest.<lb/></p>

			<head>3.1.3 An alternative measure of supply risk today<lb/></head>

			<p>The introduction of a static lifetime measure (production-to-reserves ratio) to the supply risk formula<lb/> allows to account for physical constraints to extraction. The ratio of production to reserves varies across<lb/> minerals, as <ref type="figure">Figure 10</ref> shows. Minerals with high values on this ratio will have higher supply risk<lb/> according to formula (2). In particular, minerals with a production-to-reserves ratio to the right of the red<lb/> ENV/WKP(2015)12<lb/> line can be treated as relatively scarce, as they have less than 50 years of reserves at current levels of<lb/> production.<lb/></p>

			<head>Figure 10.<lb/> Production-to-reserves ratio<lb/></head>

			<p>Where reserves data were available, supply risk was estimated based on equation (2) and the results<lb/> are presented in <ref type="figure">Figure 11</ref>. From this figure it can be seen that antimony becomes much more critical and<lb/> heavy rare earth elements become much less critical from a supply risk perspective, reflecting very<lb/> different production-to-reserves ratios. However, otherwise there is not a major difference between supply<lb/> risk as estimated by the two approaches.<lb/></p>

			<head>3.2 Critical minerals in OECD countries in 2030<lb/></head>

			<p>Future criticality of minerals depends on a range of unknowns. Some of these are very difficult to<lb/> forecast, especially future technologies. This affects both supply risk, through discoveries and expansion of<lb/> reserves, substitutability and recycling opportunities, and economic importance, through applications of<lb/> minerals in different sectors, and the weight of different sectors in the whole economy. It is impossible to<lb/> predict with a high degree of confidence which minerals will be critical in the future. Incorporating<lb/> credible dynamics into the criticality assessment can, however, give an indication of possible directions of<lb/> change based on current information.<lb/></p>

			<head>3.2.1 Future supply risks<lb/></head>

			<p>Political risk and the distribution of minerals production are important factors determining supply risk<lb/> and consequently the set of critical minerals. Future changes in political risk are difficult to predict, so for<lb/> the purposes of this report current risk estimates are assumed to apply up until 2030. Thus it is assumed<lb/> that currently relatively unstable countries will remain so.<lb/></p>

			<figure>ENV/WKP(2015)12<lb/></figure>

			<p>Attention therefore turns to predicting the future distribution of production. To capture the range of<lb/> potential outcomes, three scenarios are proposed. First, as a baseline scenario production shares are<lb/> assumed to remain constant, in which case supply risk estimates will not change. Second, as discussed in<lb/> Section 2, the distribution of production is assumed to converge gradually towards the distribution of<lb/> reserves as they are depleted. In practice it is assumed that countries continue to produce the same share of<lb/> their reserves every year up to 2030. This naturally motivates a gradual shift of production towards<lb/> reserve-rich countries as deposits are reduced.<lb/></p>

			<p>Conducting this exercise for the minerals with available and reliable reserves data yields the results<lb/> presented in <ref type="figure">Figure 12</ref> Supply risk in 2030 using the current distribution of production is on the horizontal<lb/> axis – i.e. current supply risk – while supply risk in 2030 using the production-to-reserves ratio method is<lb/> on the vertical axis.<lb/></p>

			<p>Barytes, borate and molybdenum see the greatest increase in supply risk. For both borate and<lb/> molybdenum, production is predicted to move to China, which is associated with a relatively higher<lb/> political risk according to the baseline measure from the World Governance Index of the World Bank.<lb/> Phosphate rock also sees a significant increase in supply risk, as reserves are extremely concentrated (see<lb/> Box 2). At the same time, some relatively critical minerals are predicted to become less so by 2030,<lb/> notably cobalt, fluorspar and tungsten.<lb/></p>

			<figure>Figure 12.<lb/> Supply risk predictions for 2030 using the production-to-reserves ratio method<lb/> ENV/WKP(2015)12<lb/></figure>

			<p>The third scenario assumes that future production occurs where reserves are currently present,<lb/> meaning that the production distribution in 2030 will equal the current distribution of reserves. This is<lb/> considered to be the extreme scenario of future supply risk. <ref type="figure">Figure 13</ref> compares supply risk according to<lb/> this measure with supply risk according to today&apos;s distribution of production, in a manner analogous to the<lb/> previous <ref type="figure">figure.<lb/></ref> As can be seen, the supply risk attending to phosphate rock is particularly large according to the<lb/> reserves-based measure, due to its concentration in Morocco and Western Sahara (Box 2). By contrast, the<lb/> supply risk index value is markedly lower than today for natural graphite, although this mineral remains<lb/> among the most risky from a supply perspective, fluorspar, antimony, cobalt, tungsten and, interestingly,<lb/> barytes.<lb/></p>

			<table>Box 2.<lb/> Production and reserves of phosphate rock<lb/> Phosphate rock is a sedimentary rock containing large amounts of phosphate-bearing minerals. It is<lb/> currently the only economically viable source of phosphorus for nitrogen-phosphorus-potassium fertilizers,<lb/> which are used widely on food crops. Phosphate rock is also used in animal feed supplements, food<lb/> preservatives, anti-corrosion agents, cosmetics, fungicides, ceramics, water treatment and metallurgy.<lb/> Phosphate rock is fairly common and found worldwide, but reserves are concentrated in Morocco and<lb/> Western Sahara (75% of all reserves), while production is concentrated in China (45%).<lb/> An extremely high concentration of reserves in a rather unstable region explains why supply risk increases<lb/> significantly in the period up to 2030 (<ref type="figure">Figure 11</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<head>3.2.2 Future economic importance<lb/></head>

			<p>Economic Importance in 2030 depends on how the consumption of minerals in the future will be<lb/> shared between different end-use sectors, as well as the relative economic importance of these sectors. The<lb/> mineral consumption of a specific end-use sector depends heavily on technology. It is therefore difficult to<lb/> predict which sectors will use which minerals in 2030. In the context of this report, consumption shares are<lb/> therefore assumed constant. As an example, this means that since 26% of aluminium is currently going to<lb/> the Construction Materials sector, it will remain so in 2030.<lb/></p>

			<p>The second component determining economic importance is the relative value added by sector. As<lb/> discussed in Section 2, we use the results of macroeconomic modelling with OECD&apos;s ENV-LINKAGES<lb/> model to project the sectoral composition of OECD economies in 2030.<lb/></p>

			<figure>Conducting the criticality analysis with the model-based forecast of sectoral composition in 2030<lb/> yields the results presented in Figure 14 below.<lb/> ENV/WKP(2015)12<lb/> Figure 14.<lb/> Economic Importance in 2030<lb/></figure>

			<p>In comparison with the changes observed when making supply risk dynamic, the estimates of<lb/> economic importance in 2030 are relatively similar to those today.<lb/></p>

			<head>3.3 Recycling and substitutability needs<lb/></head>

			<p>Substitutability and recycling rates were kept constant in the analysis presented above. This was done<lb/> for two reasons. First, it is difficult to predict how they will develop over time, as they depend on<lb/> technological innovation, relative prices and future policy initiatives, among other things. Second, keeping<lb/> them constant in the baseline, in order to then evaluate what changes to substitutability and recycling rates<lb/> are needed to mitigate criticality, serves as an interesting exercise in policy analysis. OECD policy-makers<lb/> have to take many market conditions – such as the location of production of minerals – as given, but they<lb/> can influence domestic and international R&amp;D towards the development of substitutes, as well as national<lb/> recycling policies.<lb/> This section first calculates the increase in the level of substitutability that is necessary to make<lb/> critical minerals non-critical according to the application of the thresholds from the EU studies (<ref type="biblio">European<lb/> Commission, 2010; 2014)</ref>, while holding constant recycling rates, as well, of course, as political stability<lb/> and the concentration of production. This exercise is conducted both for critical minerals today, and for<lb/> ENV/WKP(2015)12<lb/> minerals that are critical according to the 2030-scenario in which production converges gradually towards<lb/> the distribution of reserves as they are depleted.<lb/> <ref type="figure">Figure 15</ref> presents the results for today and <ref type="figure">Figure 16</ref> those for 2030. Note that not all minerals are<lb/> present in the estimates for 2030, as reserves data are only available for a subset. Recall that a high value<lb/> on the substitutability measure indicates that a mineral is relatively difficult to substitute.<lb/> Focusing on 2030, a timescale in which R&amp;D policies could be reasonably expected to deliver results,<lb/> <ref type="figure">Figure 15</ref> shows that the improvements required to mineral substitutability vary widely. For minerals such<lb/> as borate, barytes, phosphate rock and molybdenum, very large increases in substitutability will be required<lb/> from a very low starting point, suggesting that significant investments in R&amp;D would be necessary for<lb/> these minerals. By contrast, only small improvements would be required for manganese, bauxite, copper<lb/> and potash, although again in the cases of manganese and bauxite substitutability is currently very low, so<lb/> gains may not be won easily.<lb/></p>

			<figure>Figure 15.<lb/> Changes in substitutability needed to mitigate criticality today<lb/></figure>

			<table>Notes:<lb/> A higher value on the substitutability axis implies that the mineral is less substitutable and thus associated w ith high supply risk.<lb/> At the substitutability levels indicated by the end-point of the arrow s, currently critical minerals w ould be non-critical.<lb/> ENV/WKP(2015)12<lb/> Figure 16.<lb/> Changes in substitutability needed to mitigate criticality in 2030<lb/> Notes:<lb/> A higher value on the substitutability axis implies that the mineral is less substitutable and thus associated w ith high supply risk.<lb/> At the substitutability levels indicated by the end-point of the arrow s, currently critical minerals w ould be non-critical.<lb/></table>

			<p>The same procedure is also applied to the case of recycling rates. Necessary recycling rates to mitigate<lb/> criticality today and in 2030 are presented in Figures 17 and 18. Most of the minerals analysed in this<lb/> report currently have recycling rates at zero, in particular: barytes; borate; fluorspar; gallium; germanium;<lb/> indium; magnesite; phosphate rock; heavy rare earth elements; light rare earth elements; silicon metal, and;<lb/> vanadium. Achieving lower supply risk for these minerals via recycling could thus require inventing new<lb/> technologies. However, this is not the case for a range of minerals where recycling is currently taking<lb/> place, in particular: antimony; beryllium; chromium; cobalt; iron ore; magnesium; molybdenum; niobium;<lb/> PGMs; scandium, and; tungsten. For these minerals, higher recycling rates require either using existing<lb/> technologies more efficiently or developing new ones.<lb/></p>

			<figure>ENV/WKP(2015)12<lb/> Figure 17.<lb/> Changes in recycling needed to mitigate criticality today<lb/></figure>

			<p>From both Figures 17 and 18, it is important to notice that for some minerals recycling requirements<lb/> are especially high (assuming no improvements in substitutability). To mitigate criticality today, it would<lb/> be necessary to have recycling rates of over 60% for magnesium, REEs (heavy and light), germanium,<lb/> natural graphite, niobium, cobalt, antimony and tungsten. On the other hand, scandium, borate, chromium,<lb/> gallium and especially vanadium require relatively low recycling rates today in order to change status and<lb/> become non-critical (less than 20%).<lb/> In 2030, it is copper, fluorspar, manganese, potash, tin and bauxite that require relatively low rates of<lb/> recycling in order to change status from critical to non-critical according to the thresholds from the EU<lb/> studies, whereas for barytes, borate, molybdenum, natural graphite, antimony and phosphate rock huge<lb/> improvements would still be required. Tungsten would also need to be recycled to a high degree in 2030<lb/> (over 50%), but the recycling rate for this mineral is already at about 40%.<lb/> Section 2 explained that, in this study, recycling rates are defined as the End-of-life Recycling Input<lb/> Rate (EOL-RIR). Increases in EOL-RIRs to mitigate criticality might be infeasible in practice. For a given<lb/> ENV/WKP(2015)12<lb/> utilisation of metals, increasing the recycling rate would require either increasing the collection rate of old<lb/> scrap, and/or increasing the recycling efficiency of old scrap (the percentage of metals or materials in end-<lb/>of-life products that is recycled). However, ultimately EOL-RIR values depend on the current demand for<lb/> metals compared to past metal production. Even with perfect recycling of metals embodied in old products,<lb/> an EOL-RIR value for a metal can still be low, if the demand for this metal is increasing through time.<lb/> It is difficult to forecast improvements in recycling, and to define recycling rates that could be<lb/> considered feasible in the future. Looking at past achievements may give a hint of the potential for<lb/> improvement, but unfortunately historical data on recycling rates are available only for a very few major<lb/> metals. It is unlikely that trends observed for major metals such as iron and copper apply to other metals,<lb/> because each metal has specific properties that make its recycling more or less complex. <ref type="biblio">Graedel et al.<lb/> (2011)</ref> stress that recycling efficiency largely depends on &quot; the form in which a metal is used (pure, alloyed,<lb/> etc.), the quantity of a metal in a specific product, <ref type="biblio">[and]</ref> the design of a product (easy or hard to<lb/> disassemble) &quot; . In the short term, recycling is constrained by the availability of recycling installations, and<lb/> recycling efforts and installations are impacted by the market value of metals. In addition, as mentioned<lb/> earlier, EOL-RIR measures also rely on current demand for metals. If current demand is large compared to<lb/> past production, recycled metal cannot match current needs.<lb/></p>

			<p>Therefore it is important to conclude this section by reminding that the analysis has merely mapped<lb/> out the extremes of what might be required from recycling and improvements in substitutability.<lb/></p>

			<head>4. ROBUSTNESS CHECKS<lb/></head>

			<p>This section tests the robustness of the results obtained to various key methodological choices.<lb/> Section 4.1 discusses how criticality depends on the weighting of the different components of the supply<lb/> risk index. Section 4.2 evaluates alternative measures of political risk. Section 4.3 compares the results of<lb/> the estimation of economic importance with the results of two studies that use an alternative method.<lb/></p>

			<head>4.1 Weighting factors<lb/></head>

			<p>In this report, supply risk is a compound index aggregating three dimensions multiplicatively:<lb/> substitutability, recycling rates and the concentration of production in politically unstable countries<lb/> (formulae (1) and (2)</p>

			<p>). Alternative weightings of these dimensions would lead to different values of the<lb/> aggregate index.<lb/> <ref type="table">Table 5</ref> presents correlation coefficients between the different components of the supply risk index, as<lb/> well as with overall supply risk, for our sample of minerals. A very tight positive correlation between<lb/> political risk and the overall index of supply risk can be observed, as well as a negative correlation between<lb/> substitutability and overall supply risk (more substitutable means lower supply risk). Putting more weight<lb/> on political risk and/or substitutability would hence not change the relative ranking of materials according<lb/> to supply risk by very much. This echoes what was shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref>, namely that political risk and<lb/> substitutability are the main drivers of supply risk. However, the correlation between recycling rates and<lb/> the overall index of supply risk is low. Putting more weight on recycling rates could change significantly<lb/> the relative ranking of materials according to supply risk.<lb/></p>

			<head>4.2 Alternative risk measures<lb/></head>

			<p>Geographical concentration of production is weighted by an index measuring political stability to<lb/> produce the overall estimate of political risk attending to each mineral in the sample used in this report.<lb/> The analysis relies primarily on the World Governance Index (WGI) of political stability provided by the<lb/> World Bank. The index is constructed based on expert assessments, but is not necessarily a correct<lb/> representation of the risks facing minerals production and export. The index describes the political<lb/> situation based on three different sub-indices, including Government Effectiveness and the Rule of Law. It<lb/> is therefore useful to determine how sensitive our findings are to using this particular measure of political<lb/> risk.<lb/> Two alternative measures of risk are applied and compared the resulting estimates of supply risk with<lb/> our main findings computed using the WGI. The first alternative candidate is the Political Risk Services<lb/> Group&apos;s (PRS) index of government stability. This index is an expert assessment of both the government&apos;s<lb/> capability to carry out its declared program, and its ability to stay in office. The rationale behind using this<lb/> is that government stability is the foundation for providing minerals to the world market. The second<lb/> alternative candidate for quantifying risks facing minerals production and export is the Open Markets<lb/> Index (OMI) provided by the International Chamber of Commerce. This index captures the extent to which<lb/> countries are genuinely open economies. It consists of three sub-indices describing trade openness, trade<lb/> policy and trade-enabling infrastructure. The principle behind using this index is that the openness of<lb/> economies is an important factor that mitigates supply risk. <ref type="figure">Figures</ref> 19 and 20 present the results of this<lb/> robustness check.<lb/> ENV/WKP(2015)12<lb/> Figure 19.<lb/> Supply risk based on PRS vs. Supply risk based on WGI (Supply risk predictions for 2030)<lb/></figure>

			<p>In general, minerals have lower supply risk according to the PRS index than according to the WGI<lb/> (with the exception of a handful of minerals, most notably lithium, rhenium and beryllium). The important<lb/> factor here is that China is considered more stable according to the PRS index than according to the WGI<lb/> index. This is quantitatively important for the most risky minerals from a supply perspective, notably<lb/> heavy rare earth elements, germanium, natural graphite and light rare earth elements, but, despite shifting<lb/> downwards on the supply risk index, these minerals remain the most risky. That is to say, our results are<lb/> qualitatively robust to substituting the PRS index for the WGI index.<lb/> Reviewing the OMI findings (<ref type="figure">Figure 20</ref>) shows that supply risk is generally higher when using<lb/> openness to trade rather than when using the WGI index of political stability. The exception to this trend is<lb/> cobalt, for which supply risk is significantly lower. Generally, however, there are only minor differences,<lb/> and findings are thus also robust to using the OMI index rather than the WGI index.<lb/></p>

			<head>4.3 An alternative approach to economic importance<lb/></head>

			<p>The report&apos;s estimates of economic importance are based on how heavily a particular mineral is used<lb/> in each of a set of economic sectors, and what is the share of these sectors in the Gross Value Added of the<lb/> economy. The analysis comprises 17 sectors, sometimes called &apos;megasectors&apos; (originally by the European<lb/> Commission, 2010), because they are constructed in such a way as to approximate value chains for<lb/> minerals use. With only 17 sectors, this is a fairly coarse aggregation of different economic activities.<lb/></p>

			<p>The megasectors approach is a practicable way to obtain consistent estimates of economic importance<lb/> for a large set of minerals and a large group of countries such as the OECD, but it comes with problems.<lb/> Principally, while a megasector might be economically important, a mineral might only be used in some<lb/> sub-sectors of this megasector, so that greater disaggregation, were it possible, would reveal a different<lb/> picture. In particular, the economic importance of minerals with highly specialised uses may be<lb/> exaggerated. 6<lb/></p>

			<p>Here we compare our estimates with those obtained by <ref type="biblio">Harper</ref> et al. (forthcoming) and Nuss et al.<lb/> (2014), both of which use an alternative approach. According to this alternative approach, economic<lb/> importance (at the national level) is the sum of the value of a mineral on a measure of national economic<lb/> importance and of its value on a measure of so-called &apos;material assets&apos;. National economic importance is<lb/> measured as the value of the mineral used as a share of national GDP, converted to a 1-100 scale. The<lb/> material assets measure is obtained from a transformation of the ratio of the national per-capita in-use<lb/> stock of a mineral to the sum of the national in-use stock and national reserves.<lb/> The estimates from Harper et al. (forthcoming) and Nuss et al. (2014) are only available for a total of<lb/> nine of the minerals we analyse, and only for the US. Figure 21 presents this limited comparison. The two<lb/> approaches lead to estimates on two different</figure>

			<p>scales, therefore the estimates are not easy to compare, but<lb/> what we would hope to see is that the ordering of minerals is the same, whichever approach is taken.<lb/> However, what the figure shows is that in fact the two different approaches give a quite different ordering.<lb/> For instance, while according to the megasectors method vanadium is the most economically important<lb/> mineral for the US, according to the alternative method it is only 7/9. Conversely iron ore is the most<lb/> economically important mineral according to the alternative method, but according to the megasectors<lb/> method it is the joint least important.<lb/></p>

			<p>Therefore it cannot be concluded that the analysis of economic importance is robust to the use of<lb/> alternative approaches, but at the same time an enormous data-gathering effort would be required to roll<lb/> out alternative approaches to a large set of minerals and to the whole OECD.<lb/></p>

			<head>5. LIMITATIONS<lb/></head>

			<p>This section focuses on further limitations to the methodology and discusses potential improvements.<lb/></p>

			<head>Production and transport costs: understanding</head>

			<p>the dynamics of production and transport costs is<lb/> important, in order to have an insight into future price increases of key minerals. To determine long-term<lb/> minerals prices, two opposing effects play a major role. On the one hand, because of extensive past<lb/> extraction, new production is usually from deeper layers of the Earth&apos;s crust. This tends to increase<lb/> extraction costs. In addition, because of extensive past production, new production is located in areas<lb/> remote from the places of consumption, and competition between different land-uses also pushes mines<lb/> away from production centers, increasing transportation costs. On the other hand, technical progress tends<lb/> to decrease investments costs (all else equal), making more deposits profitable. In the short-term,<lb/> extraction costs are increasing with the extraction flow, reflecting short-term capital constraints and the<lb/> fact that less-productive capacities have to be used to meet demand. Data concerning these costs are<lb/> difficult to obtain, and forecasts are particularly complicated. The US study (Natural Resource Council of<lb/> the National Academies, 2008) accounts for cost parameters in technological availability criteria, while<lb/> other studies do not take these considerations into account, as is the case of this report.<lb/></p>

			<head>By-products:</head>

			<p>many minerals are produced as by-products of the production of other major minerals<lb/> (e.g. iron, copper and tin) and their market characteristics are therefore unconventional. The elasticity of<lb/> supply of by-products is difficult to assess. Their supply depends on the production of major minerals, the<lb/> concentration of by-products in deposits, economic incentives, and capacities to separate these by-products<lb/> from main minerals. Demand for a by-product and its associated major mineral can evolve in different<lb/> ways, putting at risk the supply of by-products. As a result, these by-products can exhibit strong price<lb/> volatility, jeopardising supply security in the short run.<lb/> Previous studies (<ref type="biblio">Nassar et al., 2012; Nuss et al., 2014</ref>) have pointed out that there is no clear<lb/> distinction between host metals, only produced for themselves, and companion metals, entirely produced<lb/> as by-products. Both of these studies apply the methodology developed in <ref type="biblio">Graedel et al. (2012)</ref> and use<lb/> &quot; the companion metal fraction &quot; for each metal they analyse. This measure represents &quot; the fraction of an<lb/> element obtained as a by-product with another metal &quot; (<ref type="biblio">Nuss et al., 2014</ref>). <ref type="biblio">Nassar et al. (2012)</ref> assess the<lb/> criticality of copper and its companion metals: arsenic, gold, selenium, silver, and tellurium. Whereas<lb/> copper and gold are mostly produced as main metals, the other elements (arsenic, selenium, silver, and<lb/> tellurium) are mostly produced as by-products. Following a similar approach, <ref type="biblio">Nuss et al. (2014)</ref> study the<lb/> criticality of iron and its principal alloying elements: vanadium, chromium, manganese and niobium. The<lb/> companion metal fraction differs substantially between these different elements. About 82% of vanadium,<lb/> but only 13% of niobium and 4% of manganese, was produced as a companion metal in 2008. The<lb/> production of chromium and iron from chromium-rich and iron-rich ores respectively accounted for all of<lb/> their production in 2008.<lb/></p>

			<p>The US study (National Resource Council of the National <ref type="biblio">Academies, 2008</ref>) also considered by-<lb/>products. It focused on 11 minerals or mineral groups: copper; PGMs; REEs; niobium; gallium; indium;<lb/> lithium; manganese; tantalum; titanium, and; vanadium. It found that by-product production, so to speak,<lb/> of gallium, indium and vanadium represented &quot; most &quot; or all of their total world primary production, while<lb/> PGMs and REEs are primarily co-products.<lb/> It is commonly acknowledged that data concerning companion metals are difficult to obtain. In the<lb/> US study, fractions of by-product production come from &quot; judgment based on published descriptions of<lb/> production. &quot; <ref type="biblio">Nassar et al. (2012</ref>) and Nuss et al. (2014) have focused on a relatively small number of<lb/> ENV/WKP(2015)12<lb/> elements (six and five respectively) for their more data-driven approach. The present study considers a<lb/> larger number of minerals and mineral groups. Obtaining companion metal fractions for each metal would<lb/> require extensive data collection. Therefore This report does not introduce a measure of the companion<lb/> metal fraction in the analysis. This extension is left for future investigation.<lb/></figure>

			<p>Externalities: accounting for externalities associated with the extraction of minerals and/or the use of<lb/> these resources can be important for correctly identifying criticality. These externalities can be local,<lb/> regional or global and are not necessarily internalised by regulators. An example of a local externality is<lb/> the radioactive by-products of REE processing. In these cases, accounting for environmental costs might<lb/> be necessary. Taking account of these externalities can threaten supply and increase minerals production<lb/> costs, and consequently influence the location of their production. Variations across countries in standards<lb/> of environmental protection could thus explain why some countries specialise themselves in highly<lb/> polluting minerals extraction. Most studies recognise the importance of externalities. The European<lb/> Commission (2010) study considered environmental risk as a separate dimension of criticality, though it<lb/> was dropped in the 2014 study as it did not change results. The US study (National Resource Council of<lb/> the National <ref type="biblio">Academies, 2008</ref>) considered an environmental availability parameter as one criterion of<lb/> availability and the UK study (<ref type="biblio">Oakdene Hollins, 2008</ref>) accounted for both Global Warming Potential in<lb/> mineral risk and vulnerability to the effects of climate change in key supplying regions as a part of supply<lb/> risk.<lb/> ENV/WKP(2015)12<lb/></p>

			<head>6. CONCLUSION<lb/></head>

			<p>The purpose of this report has been to analyse critical minerals for the OECD countries as a whole,<lb/> today and in 2030. The analysis identified around 12 to 20 minerals or mineral groups, which are critical in<lb/> the OECD today. Minerals like the rare earth elements (heavy and light), germanium and natural graphite<lb/> have a particularly high supply risk, while minerals such as barytes, tungsten and vanadium are particularly<lb/> economically important.<lb/> While it is beyond the scope of this report to assess which minerals are critical for OECD countries<lb/> individually, the analysis was broken down for the EU, Japan and the United States and found at most<lb/> small differences between these countries/regions individually and the OECD on aggregate. The one<lb/> exception was barytes, the significant economic importance of which is due to its use in the oil and gas<lb/> industry in the United States.<lb/> Using an alternative measure of the concentration of production that accounts for physical constraints<lb/> to minerals extraction (i.e. the production-to-reserves ratio), the report found that antimony has a much<lb/> higher supply risk in the OECD today, while the group of heavy rare earth elements has a much lower<lb/> supply risk.<lb/> Looking out to 2030, a stronger role for the physical availability of reserves was assumed in<lb/> determining where production takes place and the analysis found that the supply risk attending to barytes,<lb/> borate, phosphate rock and molybdenum consequently increases. It was found that economic development<lb/> along a baseline scenario that assumes continued reliance on fossil fuels for energy does not change<lb/> significantly the pattern of economic importance of the various minerals concerned. Future work should<lb/> evaluate whether this also holds true for a pathway towards green, low-carbon growth.<lb/></p>

			<p>Lastly the report showed what improvements in the substitutability of minerals and in their recycling<lb/> rates would be sufficient today and more importantly by 2030 to mitigate supply risks and vulnerability to<lb/> them. This could be a focus for public support for R&amp;D in the OECD. The results were highly mineral-<lb/>specific, with some minerals requiring huge increases in substitutability and/or recycling from a low base,<lb/> while others require only small improvements.<lb/></p>

			<p>There are numerous limitations to this analysis and it should consequently be seen as exploratory.<lb/> Measuring economic importance convincingly on the one hand and systematically for large numbers of<lb/> minerals across many countries on the other hand, appears vital. This and other limitations essentially stem<lb/> from a severe shortage of data on minerals supply and use, which makes a systematic comparison of<lb/> criticality across a wide range of minerals very difficult to achieve. Therefore a key conclusion of the<lb/> report is that there is an urgent need to improve the availability to researchers and public policy-makers of<lb/> data on the main components of minerals supply risk and use, globally.<lb/></p>
