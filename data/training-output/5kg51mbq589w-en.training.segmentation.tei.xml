			<front>ABSTRACT/RESUME <lb/>Greener growth in the Belgian federation <lb/>The degradation of the environment due to climate change and pollution can harm living standards and <lb/>damage growth prospects. In Belgium, one of the most densely populated OECD countries, pressure on the <lb/>environment is particularly strong, and is reinforced by the high energy intensity of the economy and <lb/>concentrated agriculture. Environmental policy backlogs accumulated over the years highlight the <lb/>challenges of reducing greenhouse gas emissions and water pollution in a cost-efficient way. To achieve <lb/>environmental goals at minimum cost across the economy the polluters should face the marginal costs of <lb/>the externalities they impose, which should be achieved by increasing reliance on environmental taxation. <lb/>Potential adverse effects on income distribution could then be addressed in the tax benefit system. <lb/>Moreover, where environmental responsibilities are better dealt with at the regional level, regions should <lb/>have the most efficient tools, such as taxation powers. Where, due to economies of scale and scope or <lb/>important cross-regional effects, environmental issues are better dealt with at the national level (for <lb/>instance in renewable energy sources and transport policies), better co-ordination among regions or a <lb/>greater role of the federal level should be envisaged. This Working Paper relates to the 2011 OECD <lb/>Economic Review of Belgium (www.oecd.org/eco/surveys/Belgium). <lb/>JEL classification codes: Q28, Q48, Q53, Q54, Q58, R41, R48. <lb/>Keywords: Belgium; green growth; environmental policies; greenhouse gas emissions; energy efficiency; pollution; <lb/>renewable energy; transport policies; road pricing; federalism <lb/>******* <lb/>Une croissance plus verte en Belgique <lb/>La dégradation de l&apos;environnement due au changement climatique et à la pollution peut porter atteinte au niveau de <lb/>vie et aux perspectives de croissance. En Belgique, l&apos;un des pays de l&apos;OCDE les plus densément peuplés, la pression <lb/>sur l&apos;environnement est particulièrement forte, et encore aggravée par la haute intensité énergétique de l&apos;économie et la <lb/>concentration de l&apos;agriculture. Les retards accumulés par la politique environnementale au fil des années accentuent <lb/>encore le défi qui consiste à réduire, avec un bon rapport coût-efficacité, les émissions de gaz à effet de serre et la <lb/>pollution de l&apos;eau. Pour que les objectifs environnementaux soient atteints pour un coût minimal dans l&apos;ensemble de <lb/>l&apos;économie, les pollueurs devraient supporter le coût marginal des externalités qu&apos;ils imposent, ce qui devrait être <lb/>obtenu par un recours accru à la taxation environnementale. Les conséquences indésirables qui pourraient en découler <lb/>pour la répartition des revenus pourraient alors trouver une solution dans le cadre du système de prélèvements et de <lb/>prestations. De plus, dans les cas où les responsabilités environnementales sont mieux prises en charge au niveau <lb/>régional, les régions devraient disposer des outils les plus efficaces, tels que le pouvoir de taxation. Lorsque, en <lb/>raison d&apos;économies d&apos;échelle et de gamme ou de la présence d&apos;importants effets transrégionaux, les questions <lb/>d&apos;environnement relèvent davantage de l&apos;échelon national (par exemple, les sources d&apos;énergie renouvelables et les <lb/>politiques de transport), une meilleure coordination des régions ou un rôle accru des autorités fédérales devraient <lb/>être envisagés.

			<body>Greener growth in the Belgian federation <lb/>By Tomasz Koźluk 1 <lb/>Over the past decade progress has been made in assuring sustainable development and a better and <lb/>healthier life for Belgians (OECD, 2007a), but environmental performance is still often judged as <lb/>disappointing. 2 As further objectives are being set, the challenge for the coming years will be to meet them <lb/>in a cost-efficient way. This paper goes through the areas of environmental policies where the problems are <lb/>most pressing, starting from the goal of reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in this energy intensive <lb/>economy. The slow development of renewable energy is also addressed in the context of climate change. <lb/>Air quality, a particular problem in the main cities, is reviewed within this context of GHG emissions due <lb/>to the interrelations between the two areas. Next, water pollution issues are discussed against the <lb/>background of years of failing to meet European standards, and the intensive use of water resources. <lb/>Finally, the division of environmental responsibilities is discussed, with the aim of assuring cost-efficient <lb/>policies. <lb/>The greenhouse gas emission targets are becoming increasingly challenging <lb/>Belgium, as many OECD countries, is likely to fulfil its Kyoto commitments for 2008-12 (Figure 1). <lb/>In the Kyoto protocol Belgium committed to a reduction of 2008-12 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions <lb/>by 7.5% with respect to 1990, slightly less than the EU15 overall target of –8%. The federal government <lb/>and the three regions signed an agreement specifying individual targets for each of them (Table 1). <lb/>Together the regional targets yield a national reduction of emissions of 5.8% and the remainder is to be <lb/>achieved by the federal government through the so-called Kyoto flexible mechanisms, such as the purchase <lb/>of emission rights and emission-offsetting investments abroad. The regions may also use the flexible <lb/>mechanisms to achieve their targets. 3 The 2008-09 emissions have turned out significantly lower than <lb/>initially expected, owing to the drop in activity due to the global crisis – in particular low capacity <lb/>utilisation in industry and slower transport growth (Figure 1 and Table 1). <lb/>1. <lb/>The Working Paper is based on Chapter 3 of the OECD&apos;s 2011 Survey of Belgium which was prepared <lb/>under the responsibility of the Economic and Development Review Committee. The author is grateful for <lb/>the valuable comments received on earlier drafts of this text from Jens Høj, Pierre Beynet, Alain de Serres, <lb/>Andrew Dean, Robert Ford, Jean-Luc Schneider and Balazs Egert from the Economics Department. In <lb/>addition, the author would like to thank Nils-Axel Braathen and Gerard Bonnis from the Environmental <lb/>Directorate, Bert Brys from the Centre for Tax Policy and Administration, Kurt Van Dender and Stephen <lb/>Perkins from the International Transport Forum and Maria Sicilia from the International Energy Agency <lb/>for their valuable discussions and comments. Special thanks go to Agnès Cavaciuti for statistical assistance <lb/>and to Maartje Michelson for editorial support. <lb/>2. <lb/>For instance, the Environmental Performance Index, which ranks countries according to fulfilment of <lb/>established environmental goals, puts Belgium in 88 th place among 163 countries – the lowest of all OECD <lb/>and EU countries (EPI, 2010). According to WWF, Belgium&apos;s ecological footprint – a proxy for the <lb/>unsustainability of resource use – is the fourth highest in the world (WWF, 2010). <lb/>3. <lb/>Regional governments can finance the purchase of carbon emission permits (on the EU ETS market) by <lb/>emitters, in excess of the allocated permits. In 2010, the Walloon government planned to finance permits <lb/>for a total of EUR 40-60 million for Arcelor Mittal to restart a blast furnace. <lb/></body>

It covers about 10 000 installations in the energy and <lb/>industrial sectors, which generate over 40% of GHG emissions in the countries concerned. Emission rights <lb/>are allocated according to internationally agreed national caps and within the country according to national <lb/>allocation plans (NAPs) – 96% through grandfathering. The Belgian NAP covers over 40% of projected <lb/>emissions: roughly 80% of industrial emissions and 97% of emissions from the energy sector. The NAP <lb/>reserves 8% of emission rights for new entrants. From 2012, the EU scheme will include air transport and <lb/>increase the emphasis on auctioning (over 50% of permits throughout 2013-20) over grandfathering. <lb/></body>

			<body>reducing its non-ETS emissions by 15% (with respect to 2005) and increasing the share of renewable in <lb/>energy consumption to 13%. Additionally, Belgium has adopted a 2020 target of a reduction of primary <lb/>energy consumption by 18% with respect to a 2007 baseline. These targets appear challenging since the <lb/>baseline scenario (assuming no policy change) is an overall 13% increase in GHG emissions by 2020 <lb/>relative to 2005 (Bossier et al., 2008). The non-ETS segment is to see a 4% increase. More recent <lb/>estimates show that the crisis has slowed the increase in emissions (FPB, 2010), but even so the targets for <lb/>2020 and beyond are unlikely to be fulfilled without substantial new measures. <lb/>Table 1.

If such an agreement will mean different ad hoc targets in each region, implying different <lb/>carbon prices, it will make abatement at minimum cost difficult, due to limited price equalisation <lb/>mechanisms for the non-ETS segment.

			<body>Box 1. The European climate change targets for 2020 and beyond <lb/>For 2020 and beyond, all EU countries committed under the climate and energy package (so called 20/20/20) to: <lb/>•  Reducing EU-wide GHG emissions by 20% relative to 1990. This includes a 21% cut (relative to 2005) in<lb/>industries under the ETS and a 10% cut in non-ETS sectors (transport, residential, services and agriculture). <lb/>Each country has an individual target -Belgium committed to the new cuts under the ETS and to cutting <lb/>emissions by 15% in the non-ETS sectors. <lb/>•  Doubling the overall EU share of renewable energy in final energy consumption to 20% (10% specifically in<lb/>the transport sector). The Belgian commitment is to increase its share of renewables to 13%. <lb/>•  Improving energy efficiency by 20%, on the EU level.<lb/>The EU climate change and energy package also contains a commitment to further reduce emissions (in total <lb/>by 30%) if an international agreement with other major emitters is reached. <lb/>There are a number of direct consequences of the package for Belgium (as well as for other EU countries). <lb/>Firstly, the effective separation between the ETS and non-ETS targets combined with a lack of market mechanisms <lb/>between the two segments means that it is likely that abatement costs are going to differ between the ETS and the <lb/>non-ETS segments. Hence, pure minimum-cost abatement will not be possible, meaning that there is likely to be too <lb/>much abatement in one segment, while cheaper abatement possibilities in the other will not be exploited. Second, the <lb/>individual targets are characterised by strong interactions. For instance, increasing the (Belgian) share of renewable <lb/>energy in terms of electricity production, while likely to reduce the CO2-intensity of the Belgian economy, may not lead <lb/>to any reduction in EU-wide CO2 emissions, as long as the ETS cap remains fixed. In a similar manner, improvements <lb/>in, for example, household energy efficiency that reduce (Belgian) electricity use, will only decrease the price of <lb/>emission permits on the ETS, but not reduce EU-wide emissions (OECD, 2011b). <lb/>Box 2. Federal climate change policies and the planned phase-out of nuclear energy <lb/>Over half of Belgian electricity production takes place in nuclear power plants which constitute the majority of <lb/>base load capacity. On current plans (a 2003 law) nuclear energy is to be phased out between 2015 and 2025. In 2009 <lb/>the government took a decision to postpone the phase-out of the three oldest nuclear reactors by 10 years, but the bill <lb/>has not yet been voted. The full depreciation of the nuclear reactors creates a windfall profit for nuclear producers, <lb/>which the government is attempting to tax away. The level of the tax is under discussion, <lb/>Federal strategies regarding climate change and energy policies focus on increasing the role of renewable <lb/>energy sources – from below 4% of total energy consumption currently to 13% by 2020. As smaller scale renewable <lb/>energy sources are a regional competence, the main plans are for off-shore wind energy (2000 MW of windmill parks <lb/>in the North Sea), biomass (adapting two major coal plants) and bio fuels (encouraging the share in fuel transport via a <lb/>quota system). These measures are to reduce emissions by 4%. For the moment, implementation of the plans is <lb/>lagging – for example windmill developments are delayed because of regulatory issues (capacity constraints on the <lb/>connection to the grid and bureaucratic procedures). The government also plans to increase interconnection capacity <lb/>with neighbouring countries (in 2008 net imports of electricity were over 10% of total electricity use). Other measures <lb/>will yield minor effects. <lb/>The replacement of nuclear energy is likely to result in increasing overall CO2 emissions by 12-20%, depending <lb/>on the assumptions. The phase-out may not be directly relevant for the 20/20/20 targets, since there is no &quot; Belgian &quot; <lb/>target for the ETS segment -replacing nuclear with fossil fuel plants will increase the ETS price of emission permits, <lb/>inducing more abatement somewhere across the EU. The resulting increase in electricity prices may have some <lb/>secondary effects on the composition of energy demand, as the relative price of high-emission fossil fuels will <lb/>decrease. Still, there are currently no clear plans on how to replace nuclear. According to a sustainable development <lb/>scenario (GEMIX simulations), a full phase out of nuclear energy would imply an energy mix with about 40% of energy <lb/>coming from windmill farms by 2050. Such an outcome is likely to be expensive due to the limited physical space for <lb/>off-shore windmill plants, and problematic in practice due to their poor reliability to provide base or peak load. <lb/></body>

			<body>The high energy intensity of the economy leads to a large amount of emissions <lb/>Despite a slight decrease over the past decade, Belgium&apos;s energy intensity of GDP remains above the <lb/>OECD average (Figure 2). The reliance on no-emission nuclear energy reduces overall GHG emission-<lb/>intensity, but is offset by the widespread use of oil products and one of the lowest shares of renewable <lb/>energy in the OECD. Overall, emission intensity is above the EU average. Energy-intensive industry <lb/>generates almost a third of overall GHG emissions, a higher share than in the majority of OECD countries <lb/>(Figure 3). Road transport contributes a fifth of emissions (roughly the EU average) while residential <lb/>emissions have the second highest share in the OECD. <lb/>Figure 2.

			<body>The development of renewable energy sources is expensive <lb/>A particular challenge that faces the Belgian economy, in terms of climate change targets, is the <lb/>development of renewable energy. At the current state of technology, Belgium has limited natural <lb/>advantages in terms of renewable energy: the marine territory is limited reducing the potential for off-shore <lb/>windmills, while the largely flat landscape and moderate climate limit the potential for hydropower and <lb/>solar energy. Furthermore, legal and regulatory problems, such as the fact that grid operators in Flanders <lb/>regularly refuse to connect renewable energy producers and disputes on who should bear the connection <lb/>costs, appear to raise entry costs to higher levels than in other countries (AEON, 2010). The result is one of <lb/>the lowest shares of renewables in electricity production in the OECD, coming mainly from biomass, <lb/>mostly imported from overseas. Pre-crisis simulations showed that the share of energy from renewable <lb/>sources was to reach about 7.5% by 2020 -just above half of the Belgian target (Bossier et al., 2008). The <lb/>effect of the crisis (lower overall energy consumption) and measures taken since 2008 should have a <lb/>positive effect on the share of renewables, nevertheless, without further measures, it seems highly unlikely <lb/>Belgium will meet its renewable targets. <lb/>To encourage the production of electricity from renewable sources, the federal and regional <lb/>governments have introduced green certificates (GC&apos;s, Table 2). In line with the division of environmental <lb/>(and energy) responsibilities, the federal level is responsible for certificates concerning energy producers <lb/>connected to the high voltage grid, while the regional certificates concern the low voltage grid. 6 Green <lb/>certificates are issued to renewable energy producers by the relevant energy regulators. Each electricity <lb/>grid operator is obliged to purchase all electricity from renewable producers at a market wholesale price. <lb/>As the costs of renewable energy are generally higher than the wholesale market price, the green producers <lb/>are compensated with gains from selling the GC&apos;s (either on the secondary GC market or to the grid <lb/>operator directly for a minimum price). The grid operator also places the acquired certificates on the <lb/>secondary market and can recuperate the difference between the cost of purchase of the GC&apos;s on the <lb/>primary market and the secondary market price through distribution tariffs. On the secondary market, the <lb/>GC&apos;s are purchased by the final electricity suppliers, each of which is obliged to acquire a certain <lb/>minimum share of its electricity from renewable sources (in 2010 these were 2.8% in BCR, 6% in Flanders <lb/>and 10% in Wallonia). This is done symbolically by acquiring a sufficient amount of GC&apos;s. <lb/>The renewable policies are poorly co-ordinated across governments, resulting in five <lb/>separate GC markets and making renewable policy unnecessarily expensive. The national programme <lb/>(National Action Plan) for renewable energy is effectively a compilation of federal and regional <lb/>programmes with little mention of intranational spillovers and coordination of the strategies on how to <lb/>achieve the 2020 target. In practice, regions set their own objectives and use different tools to achieve <lb/>them, choosing individually the winning technologies and disregarding the marginal abatement costs. In <lb/>the absence of a price equalisation mechanism, market separation fails to exploit economies of scale and <lb/>scope – regional GC&apos;s do not guarantee that investments in renewables are done where it is economically <lb/>most viable (across the country), raising the costs of achieving the overall objective. The existence of five <lb/>(relatively small) separate GC markets also raises administrative costs, and remains an international <lb/>peculiarity; for instance Norway and Sweden are taking steps to create a common market. 7 <lb/>6. <lb/>The federal government certificates cover the grid above 70 kV. <lb/>7. <lb/>The fifth separate market exists for combined heat and power production in Flanders. The separation is <lb/>complete aside the agreement to accept Walloon GC&apos;s in Brussels on certain conditions. <lb/></body>

The minimum price for a GC in Wallonia is EUR 65.

Reduced annually by EUR 20/MWh until 2013 and by EUR 40/MWh onwards. The contracted price is guaranteed for 20 years. <lb/>Source: CREG and BRUGEL. <lb/>The fact that federal certificates are not accepted on the regional markets effectively excludes large <lb/>scale production of renewable energy from the regional quotas and thus favours smaller, and likely less-<lb/>efficient, producers at the regional level. Indeed, when compared with the 55 EUR per MWh estimated <lb/>increase in energy prices necessary to achieve the 2020 renewable targets (by making renewable energy <lb/>economically viable), the regional GC&apos;s appear significantly overpriced, while the majority of the <lb/>federal GC&apos;s are too cheap ( Bossier et al., 2008). 8 The former provide massive returns on low-risk <lb/>investments in technologies with poor efficiency, 9 and have practically no effect on EU-wide <lb/>CO 2 emissions (Box 1). The excessive prices may have negative environmental consequences, as by <lb/>raising the final consumers&apos; electricity bill they increase the incentives to switch to more polluting fossil <lb/>fuels. Therefore, a common GC could be an efficient solution (De Serres et al., 2010). <lb/>Mandatory minimum prices for certain renewable energy technologies mean that governments are <lb/>heavily involved in picking winning technologies (particularly photovoltaic) and risk limiting the <lb/>incentives to improve their efficiency. To avoid a bias to expensive sources, the single GC market should <lb/>not be bound by minimum prices. Instead, the price of renewable energy, and consequently the <lb/>development of the cheapest and most appropriate technologies, should be left to the market under the <lb/>constraint of a credible national path for the mandatory minimum share of renewable energy. The <lb/>reductions in GC&apos;s requirements for suppliers of large clients (currently in place in all regions) are <lb/>effectively a subsidy to these clients, that is, to large energy consumers, and should be abolished. <lb/>8. <lb/>Recalculated to 2010 prices, the scenario also requires a carbon price. <lb/>9. <lb/>CREG (2010b) takes into account all implicit and explicit (federal and regional) government aid in <lb/>Flanders – tax deductions, investment subsidies, and GC&apos;s to calculate the annual returns on equity of 55% <lb/>for PV, over 100% for onshore wind and biomass and in excess of 1 000% for biomass co-combustion in <lb/>existing coal plants. A similar study for Wallonia was not possible due to the lack of data. <lb/></body>

			<body>Renewable energy is also encouraged through a number of investment subsidies and tax reductions. <lb/>At the federal level, households can deduct up to 40% of their investment in renewable energy from <lb/>income tax. Enterprises can deduct 13.5% of their investment in renewable energy from the taxable profits. <lb/>The federal government also provides implicit subsidies to off-shore wind – through minimum prices on <lb/>the GC market, connector cables, covering part of balancing costs and government-backed loans from the <lb/>European Investment Bank (CREG, 2010a). The Flemish government provides investment subsidies to <lb/>enterprises – 10-20% (to double in the future) of the additional costs of investments in renewables 10 <lb/>(Guisson and Marchal, 2008). Wallonia provides specific grants for small biomass and combined heat and <lb/>power plants (IEA, 2010). A common, well-designed GC scheme and low market entry barriers would <lb/>ensure the viability of investments in the most efficient renewable technologies across the country and <lb/>improve incentives for R&amp;D in this area. <lb/>Transport is imposing an increasing burden on the environment <lb/>The transport sector, as in most EU countries, has undergone the largest growth in emissions since <lb/>1990 (Figure 6), reflecting increases in traffic volumes (among the highest in the EU15) only partly offset <lb/>by better emission performance of vehicles. Particularly high growth of freight transport volumes mirrors <lb/>increases in world trade as half of the freight traffic is international (Hertveldt et al., 2009). Passenger <lb/>transport reflects intensive commuting, mostly by car with the use per capita among the highest in <lb/>the OECD. Inland freight transport is mainly on roads, with an internationally high share of inland <lb/>waterways. The road, motorway and rail networks are well developed and among the most dense in <lb/>the OECD, but congestion is a frequent feature in bottleneck areas, in particular in the area of Brussels <lb/>(among the most congested cities in Europe; Le Soir, 2010) and Antwerp. On current policies, emissions <lb/>from transport are expected to continue growing over the next decade (Bossier et al., 2008). <lb/>Figure 6.

			<body>Source: United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change Database. <lb/>A particular feature is the internationally high share of diesel use (Figure 7), reflecting the diesel-<lb/>dominance of Belgian passenger cars (57%, second only to Luxembourg in the OECD, driving some <lb/>70% of the vehicle-kilometres) and an important role of international transport. This results, to a large <lb/>extent, from the relatively low taxation of diesel fuels (Figure 8), which is some 40% lower (excise <lb/>taxation, per litre) than gasoline, despite its 15% higher carbon content and higher related emissions of <lb/>other pollutants such as NO x and particulate matter. The two latter are a major problem, in particular in <lb/>Brussels (Box 3). Furthermore, low diesel prices lead to a &quot; diesel illusion &quot; – one in four Belgians that opt <lb/>for diesel do not drive enough to make this choice financially viable and would be better off buying a <lb/>gasoline car (VAB, 2008). <lb/>Figure 7.

Air pollution is linked to transport and household heating <lb/>The two main problems with air quality in Belgium are nitrogen di-oxide (NO2) emissions and particulate matter (particularly <lb/>PM10), both largely due to the widespread use of diesel fuels in transport and heating. In the case of particulate matter, the agricultural <lb/>sector is also an important emission source. As most EU countries, Belgium is likely to have met the 2010 EU targets for all pollutants <lb/>apart from nitrogen oxides (NOx) but the margin by which the NOx target has been missed is among the highest (Figure 9). For <lb/>particulate matter, excess concentration is among the most widespread among the EU15 with almost all the monitored zones <lb/>exceeding the daily (though not the annual) limits. The problems are particularly acute in Brussels and Antwerp. Overall, the problems <lb/>with complying with the EU&apos;s daily limit values for PM10 are likely to persist for many years to come (Fierens et al., 2006, Deutsch et <lb/>al., 2010). <lb/>ECO/WKP(2011)63 <lb/></body>

Still, even the most recent EURO 5 emission norms for passenger cars permit three times higher <lb/>NOx emissions for diesel than for gasoline cars, with particularly high freight emissions.

Moreover, there remains a large stock of <lb/>old vehicles, which do not comply with the stricter recent norms -it will take another 10 years till EURO 5 vehicles drive more than <lb/>older cars (TML, 2006). Finally, since their introduction the EURO norms have not been effective in reducing NOx emissions per litre <lb/>of fuels, in part as they concern emissions under very specific test-conditions, while in practice values can often be significantly higher <lb/>and concern new cars while emission performance may deteriorate significantly over vehicle life (DEFRA, 2011). <lb/>Figure 8.

			<body>Additional incentives for car use and ownership arise from the tax treatment of company cars and <lb/>purchase subsidies for &quot; environmentally friendly &quot; vehicles. 11 Company cars provided by employers are <lb/>strongly encouraged. Private use is treated as a lump sum in-kind benefit, with the taxable value between <lb/>EUR 630 and EUR 2 400 per year depending on emission class. As a result, employers have been treating <lb/>company cars as cheap non-wage compensation cost and the number of company cars is estimated at 22% <lb/>of the passenger car fleet, of which a third are considered as in-kind benefits (Mossakowski, 2011). The <lb/>cars are often provided with a so-called fuel card, a benefit which effectively facilitates the treatment of <lb/>fuel expenditures as company costs. Over the past years, the federal government made steps to green the <lb/>company car fleet by linking fiscal deductibility of the cars to their CO 2 emissions and, in 2010, reducing <lb/>the deductibility of fuel cards to 75%. These measures should have positive environmental effects, but do <lb/>not go far enough to repair the damage done by underpriced car use. The tax treatment of such in-kind <lb/>benefits should be the same as of standard income. <lb/>The federal government also encourages the purchase of low-emission vehicles through a tax rebate <lb/>of 15% or 3% of the price for cars with CO 2 emissions below 105 g/km and 115 g/km respectively. 12 <lb/>Intended to green the car fleet, the bonus also encourages the purchase of small diesel cars aggravating the <lb/>problem of NO x and particulate emissions in city centres, while its abatement cost is rather high -EUR 446 <lb/>and EUR 817 per tonne of CO 2 for the two categories respectively (HCF, 2009). In the Walloon region, the <lb/>effects are amplified by an environmental bonus/malus system for car purchase. At the same time, car <lb/>purchase and annual ownership taxes seem to be among the least discriminatory with respect to CO 2 across <lb/>EU countries (see Braathen, 2011 for a comparison of Walloon numbers with other EU countries). All such <lb/>subsidies have a high deadweight cost, as they are also given to people who would opt for a low-emission <lb/>car anyway, a high fiscal cost (over EUR 200 million in 2010) and should be scrapped. The objective of <lb/>greening transport should be pursued through marginal externality taxation of fuels, in particular a carbon <lb/>tax (see below). 13 <lb/>The federal government supports commuting through relatively complicated and generous commuting <lb/>allowances which lower the marginal costs of travelling to work by all modes of transport (Table 3). <lb/>Particular benefits concern public transport and collective transport and no distance limits are imposed on <lb/>car travel. The system provides disincentives for moving closer to the workplace. Hence, the commuting <lb/>allowance, particularly for road transport, should be either targeted to low-income workers, who otherwise <lb/>risk falling out of the labour market, or replaced by a lump sum subsidy for such groups. <lb/>11. <lb/>Ownership taxes (registration and annual road tax) are moderate relative to other EU countries. <lb/>Registration and annual road tax are based related to the engine size and power (so-called fiscal power). <lb/>Even for very polluting cars the registration tax falls with age. <lb/>12. <lb/>The federal rebate is limited to EUR 4 500 per car. The total cost of the measure in 2010 was <lb/>EUR 208 million (double that of 2009) – on average almost EUR 2 000 per car. Given the limited <lb/>availability of cars with low emissions, a large share of the rebate may be pocketed by the producers <lb/>(HCF, 2009). <lb/>13. <lb/>To the extent there may be an overall case for encouraging the purchase of more fuel-efficient vehicles, as <lb/>consumers may tend to undervalue the (far-in – the-future) fuel savings relative to purchase costs (OECD, <lb/>2009b) – this can be done through purchase taxation (or registration fees) rather than subsidies. <lb/></body>

The government refunds 20% of the <lb/>commuting cost if the employer pays the rest. Despite this, only about 9% of Flemish and Walloon <lb/>residents use public transport for commuting (the share is about 50% for Brussels residents), reflecting that <lb/>public transport lacks flexibility to substitute the car on a wider basis (SPF Mobility, 2010). One factor <lb/>may be that public bus transport is organised by a separate body in each of the regions and trains are the <lb/>competence of a federal body, making co-ordination complicated. Moreover, at the regional level, land <lb/>regulation issues and financing issues play a role, as for instance visible in the lagging setup of the regional <lb/>express rail for Brussels. <lb/>The limited ability of public transport to adapt to changes in demand, points to the need for flexibility <lb/>and more competitive pressure. More co-ordination among the regional and local governments is a must <lb/>and bus schedules and routes should be made more flexible to accommodate demand. Tendering of <lb/>services, currently used to a limited extent in Flanders, should be encouraged. Operators should be able to <lb/>propose new routes, and entry barriers need to be lowered, by guaranteeing access to infrastructure. Ticket <lb/>prices should remain regulated, due to the limited scope for competition, but subsidies should be <lb/>transparent and follow a clearly identified benefit (e.g. mobility, equity, urban reasons). The government <lb/>wishing to impose obligations (e.g. free tickets for elderly) should pay the full cost directly. Finally, in <lb/>order to green public transport by improving load factors, more flexibility should be coupled with exposing <lb/>operators to price signals to encourage emission reductions – they should pay the full (external) costs of <lb/>their activity (e.g. fuel taxes). <lb/></body>

			<body>External costs can be internalised through fuel taxation and a congestion charge <lb/>Fuel taxation is generally well below the external costs generated by road transport, encouraging the <lb/>demand for transport and relatively high fuel consumption (McKinsey, 2009). As in most countries, fuel <lb/>taxation is generally higher than most estimates of marginal environmental externalities generated by <lb/>transport. However, the costs incurred by transport through fuel taxation are disproportionately large for <lb/>gasoline powered passenger cars, compared to diesel powered cars and in particular freight vehicles. This <lb/>is largely due to lower relative taxation of diesel, which is associated with external costs of a magnitude <lb/>higher than gasoline, mainly due to NO x and PM x emissions. Moreover, if the non-environmental <lb/>externalities, such as road wear and tear, accident costs and in particular congestion, are taken into account, <lb/>fuel taxation appears too low, in particular for freight. Both of these arguments are strengthened in <lb/>Belgium by the low taxation of diesel (see CE Delft, 2008, Koźluk, 2010, for international examples and <lb/>Hertveldt et al., 2009, for a Belgian specific study). The arguments against higher fuel taxation are mainly <lb/>related to competitiveness (of the freight sector and the port of Antwerp) and fiscal revenue leakage. Low <lb/>taxation of diesel diminishes the incentives provided by the government subsidies for shifting freight from <lb/>road to rail and inland waterways (IWW). At the same time, empirical analysis generally fails to find <lb/>evidence of a significant effect of changes in fuel prices relative to neighbouring countries on fiscal <lb/>revenues (Schmitz, 2011), though the importance of international traffic means that a substantial unilateral <lb/>increase is sure to have some consequences. Nevertheless, the overall effects of higher fuel prices on fuel <lb/>consumption are likely to be limited in the short to medium term – estimates show that a 1% increase in <lb/>fuel prices would lead to about a 0.2-0.3% decrease in fuel demand (Schmitz, 2011). Long-term effects are <lb/>likely to be higher as car owners switch to more fuel efficient vehicles (Goodwin et al., 2004). <lb/>Fuel taxation should be adjusted in line with the marginal externalities – the users who emit pollutants <lb/>should pay the marginal costs of their activity, so that they face the adequate incentives to reduce pollution. <lb/>This means primarily increasing the relative taxation of the more polluting diesel, which should reduce the <lb/>Belgian diesel bias, thereby lowering NO x and particulate emissions. Such a reform was recommended in <lb/>the 2009 Survey, and the federal government made a step in this direction by increasing the excise on <lb/>diesel in 2010. To boost the effectiveness of price-related measures, Belgium-specific price regulations <lb/>should be scrapped: the price cap on automotive fuels, the automatic adjustment of excise taxes to <lb/>accommodate large fuel price changes (inverse cliquet) and special refund of part of the excise tax for <lb/>vans, buses, taxis and trucks (professional diesel). <lb/>A particular externality of road transport is congestion. The estimates of the cost of congestion in <lb/>Belgium range from 0.05% of GDP (Hoornaert et al., 2009) to 2% of GDP (INFRAS, 2004), largely <lb/>concentrated in bottlenecks around Brussels and Antwerp. An efficient instrument to tackle this issue, in <lb/>particular given the concentrated nature of congestion in Belgium, is a congestion charge for each <lb/>kilometre driven in bottleneck areas and times (Fosgerau and Van Dender, 2010; Eliasson, 2010) or a <lb/>simpler version such as city access charges (urban tolls) introduced in several cities in the OECD <lb/>(e.g. London, Oslo, Stockholm). Such charges are well targeted to deal with local problems at a limited <lb/>overall cost. A congestion charge is likely to be a viable solution to the traffic problems of Brussels, <lb/>reducing queues, travel time and improving air quality, but its introduction encounters a major obstacle due <lb/>to the regional division of powers in transport policies, as the outer ring road passes through Wallonia and <lb/>Flanders. <lb/>Road pricing can be a viable solution <lb/>A more comprehensive, if ambitious, solution would be a nation-wide GPS-based road charge, such <lb/>as the system recently proposed in the Netherlands (Koźluk, 2010). 14 Such a scheme should include a <lb/>14. <lb/>In late 2009 the Dutch government (unsuccessfully) attempted to introduce a road pricing scheme to cover <lb/>all roads and (almost) all vehicles, moving away from fixed vehicle taxation (registration and annual <lb/>ownership taxes) to a user-pays system of charging road transport. A fixed vehicle-related per-kilometre <lb/></body>

			<body>per-kilometre charge linked to the externalities generated by different categories of vehicles and a <lb/>congestion surcharge in bottleneck areas. The system could bring about substantial reductions in <lb/>GHG emissions from transport and air pollutants while limiting the negative impact on economic activity <lb/>(for instance, contrary to fuel taxation road pricing does not discriminate between domestic transport <lb/>services and transit transport, and does not encourage fuelling up abroad). If the externalities linked to fuel <lb/>consumption (such as CO 2 ) would be embodied in fuel taxes, the per-kilometre prices could take care of <lb/>the other externalities, in particular those linked to the driven distance (e.g. road wear and tear), <lb/>discriminating by category of vehicle. The price-discrimination across categories would also improve the <lb/>NO x and particulate emission performance (Box 3). It could first be rolled out for freight (as in Germany <lb/>and Slovakia) and utility vehicles, as this is likely to be more politically feasible. For the same reason, road <lb/>pricing in Belgium might first apply to company cars, and as the scheme gains more public acceptance, it <lb/>can subsequently be extended to all traffic. <lb/>In 2011, the three regions agreed on introducing a common GPS-based per-kilometre road charge for <lb/>freight, though at the moment of writing details were not available. Such a system can only be efficient if <lb/>introduced uniformly across the country, and even more so, if introduced across neighbouring countries. <lb/>Moreover, when introduced for passenger transport, road pricing or congestion charges are likely to <lb/>increase the demand for public transport, in particular in peak hours, raising the importance of making <lb/>services more responsive to demand. <lb/>Household energy efficiency is poor due to weak incentives <lb/>The housing stock is poorly insulated (Table 4), contributing to household energy use (per square <lb/>metre) 70% above the EU average (twice that in the neighbouring Netherlands) and residential emissions <lb/>per capita twice the OECD average (Table 5 and McKinsey, 2009). A third of the housing stock pre-dates <lb/>1945 (particularly in Brussels and Wallonia) and heating systems tend to be old (HCF, 2009). Non-<lb/>compliance with building norms means that the problems are not limited to old buildings (OECD, 2007a). <lb/>Given the relatively high prices of electricity (Koźluk, 2009), the main source of household heating is <lb/>natural gas. Heating oil, roughly a third more emission-intensive than gas (CO 2 per GJ), plays an important <lb/>role (half of the energy use in Wallonia, a third in Flanders and Brussels). <lb/>Table 4.

As lower energy tariffs discourage energy saving, they should be scrapped, while social <lb/>objectives should be pursued through social policies, such as a lump-sum income subsidy targeted at low-<lb/>income households, coupled with measures to increase the accessibility of energy-efficiency investments <lb/>for such groups (see below). Another group not directly exposed to energy prices are those subject to the <lb/>in-kind benefit, whereby the employer pays the electricity and heating bills. Such benefits are taxed as a <lb/>lump-sum, regardless of the actual amount, 15 making them a cheap non-wage benefit. These benefits have <lb/>negative environmental effects as concerned households face zero marginal costs of energy and are more <lb/>likely to benefit higher income groups. Such benefits should be taxed as any other wage income. <lb/>Box 4. Social energy policies and the incentives for saving energy <lb/>Heating affordability for low-income households is guaranteed through the Social Heating Fund – a lump sum subsidy of <lb/>up to EUR 300 per year (heating oil and natural gas bill). In addition, there is the so-called social energy (electricity and gas) <lb/>tariff, equal to the lowest commercial (i.e. industry) tariff in the area and available to almost 7% (electricity) and over 5% (gas) <lb/>of households. Since 2009, the attribution of social tariffs became automatic. Households eligible for social tariffs are also <lb/>exempt from the federal surcharge on energy and face a price that can be well below half of the market tariff, hence providing <lb/>much lower marginal incentives to save energy. <lb/>The reduced VAT rate (12%) on coal for households can also be regarded as a social policy, given that low-income <lb/>households are the most likely to be heated with coal. Despite a large decrease, coal still heats some 2% of households in <lb/>Flanders, and the lower VAT effectively decreases the incentives to change to alternative fuels. <lb/>In Flanders, all households are eligible for a free electricity quota for each household member. This may further <lb/>decrease the saving incentive for households eligible for social tariffs (by reducing the total energy bill), but the effect on other <lb/>households is unclear. The free quota has to be incorporated into retailers&apos; pricing strategies and hence forces a higher tariff <lb/>on the remaining consumption – potentially increasing the incentive to save. <lb/>15. <lb/>The employer pays the annual bills, and the employees are taxes as if they received a lump sum income of <lb/>EUR 370 in case of electricity, EUR 740 for heating. In case of management personnel the amount subject <lb/>to taxation is twice as high. This amount has been increasing fairly rapidly in the recent years. <lb/></body>

			<body>To counter the weak energy saving incentives and promote energy efficiency, the governments have <lb/>stepped up measures to directly encourage investment in improvement of housing. The federal government <lb/>offers numerous tax reductions (e.g. for the replacement or improvement of boilers, windows, insulation of <lb/>roofs, walls and ceilings, energy-saving devices, installation of heat pumps, solar heaters and solar panels) <lb/>of up to EUR 2 650 per household per year (40% of expenses). The regions top these up by a multitude of <lb/>subsidies: 22 in Wallonia (down from 48 in 2009), 20 in Brussels and 18 in Flanders, some of which are <lb/>decided upon an annual basis. <lb/>The focus on energy efficiency improvements is commendable, in particular given the <lb/>20/20/20 objectives, but the actual outcomes are rather disappointing (HCF, 2009). One reason is that <lb/>government measures tend to pick &quot; winning &quot; technologies, disregarding the relative cost efficiency and <lb/>despite the explicit advice from government-financed energy audits of households. The lowest subsidies <lb/>are provided for measures most efficient in energy saving: roof, wall and ground insulation, window <lb/>replacement (Renard,2008 and De Coninck and Verbeeck, 2006). A simple calculation based on 2008 data <lb/>shows that due to federal and regional fiscal incentives, a Walloon homeowner would choose to install <lb/>photovoltaic panels (PV) over wall insulation, where the latter would be six times more cost-efficient in <lb/>reducing CO 2 (Spies and Buxant, 2008). The cost of CO 2 avoidance for the taxpayer would be EUR 23 per <lb/>tonne in the case of wall insulation, but EUR 1 600 for PV, with similar outcomes in the other regions. <lb/>Notably, the situation in Wallonia itself has improved somewhat, due to the reforms of Walloon measures, <lb/>including scrapping of some of the regional subsidies to PV The strong public support for PV resulted in <lb/>increasing take up in 2010, but is questionable given the climate conditions and no cost/benefit assessment <lb/>of the policies (IEA, 2010). Similarly, fiscal incentives support both the replacement of old boilers as well <lb/>as their maintenance. Most old boilers are subject to quasi-mandatory replacement (because of government <lb/>or insurance norms), implying an effective subsidy to comply. 16 Finally, many existing subsidies concern <lb/>also new housing, where measures could be implemented more effectively through stricter building <lb/>standards. <lb/>The incentives for insulation are more complicated for rented housing, which constitutes roughly a <lb/>quarter of Belgian housing. Tenants are likely to be less willing to invest in energy improvements of their <lb/>housing, not being able to reclaim the full benefits from the investment. Similarly, owners of rented <lb/>property have limited possibility to recuperate the cost of the investment because of rent regulation. In <lb/>principle, rent regulation foresees a phased-in increase of the rent due to an increase in property value (for <lb/>instance due to an investment in energy efficiency). Still, the quality and energy efficiency of rented <lb/>property remains rather poor, and a reviewing rent regulation in this respect, to introduce stronger <lb/>incentives, should be considered. 17 <lb/>Price signals provide the most straightforward incentives, while awareness could be improved, <lb/>The importance of nuclear energy in providing base load electricity capacity means that base load is <lb/>relatively CO 2 -free compared with gas-and coal-powered peak load. This distinction may not be <lb/>straightforward in a unified EU energy market, but due to capacity constraints on the Belgian international <lb/>connection grid, it is possible to assume that peak load is largely supplied by local producers. Hence, the <lb/>16. <lb/>HCF also noted that given the very limited competition in many of the subsidised areas (e.g. energy audits, <lb/>installation of equipment) suppliers are likely to take over a large part of the subsidy – reducing the effect <lb/>on households&apos; behaviour. Moreover, the division of powers obstructs the flow of these services -licenses <lb/>for installation of facilities (e.g. PV) and audits issued in one region are not recognised in the other. <lb/>17. <lb/>For example in Wallonia, 70% of owner occupied housing and only 50% of rented housing is classified as <lb/>good or very good standard (Carlier et al., 2007). <lb/></body>

			<body>governments also aim at smoothing electricity consumption, particularly through the 24-hour day. This can <lb/>be done by encouraging meters with day/night tariff readings or the more costly so-called smart meters <lb/>with real time readings. The Flemish government is planning smart metering by 2018, while tests are <lb/>underway in Wallonia. As emphasised, such measures will not affect CO 2 emissions in the EU, as long as <lb/>the ETS cap remains unchanged (Box 1). <lb/>Households&apos; energy efficiency awareness is poor. The data for Brussels reveals that many households <lb/>are unaware of the state of insulation of their houses and thus is unlikely to take up subsidies (of which <lb/>many households have not heard) or in general to improve the energy efficiency of housing (Table 4). 18 <lb/>The rental and secondary markets are also likely to suffer from the asymmetry of information, if the <lb/>owners do not reveal the energy efficiency of houses put on the market. The governments have recently <lb/>taken steps to reduce asymmetry by increasing energy awareness by making energy certificates (PEB) an <lb/>obligatory document for the placement of houses on the market. Other measures include labelling of <lb/>products (e.g. domestic appliances) but arguably, households&apos; incentives would increase with the energy <lb/>price. <lb/>Overall, the existing subsidies for energy saving should be scrapped and the incentives should be <lb/>provided through energy prices. Government policies should focus on fixing market failures in the areas <lb/>where efficiency can be improved in economically viable ways: <lb/>• Internalising the costs of externalities associated with energy use into the prices (through an <lb/>externality tax, such as a carbon tax on heating fuels).<lb/>• Reducing uncertainty for investments which are likely to break-even in years, by providing <lb/>credible paths for externality taxation.<lb/>• Supporting liquidity constrained low-income households to make such investments, (through <lb/>targeted investment subsidies or cheap loans) to exploit relatively cheap abatement possibilities, <lb/>as low-income households are likely to live in poorly insulated housing. In this line, the federal <lb/>government has recently set aside funds to promote third-party financing and cheap loans for <lb/>energy efficiency improvements of low-income households (FRCE/FRGE), while the regions are <lb/>providing cheap loans.<lb/>• Improving energy-efficiency awareness. <lb/> • Enforcing minimum building standards for new housing.<lb/>Notably, a number of the measures proposed above will also encourage more cost-efficient abatement <lb/>in the remainder of the non-ETS segment: small industry, services and agriculture. <lb/>Purchasing emission rights abroad may slow adjustment to a less carbon-intensive economy <lb/>The national burden-sharing agreement foresees that the federal government offsets emissions <lb/>purchasing carbon credits through Kyoto flexible mechanisms (Table 1). Almost half of the overall amount <lb/>of carbon credits for 2008-12 has already been delivered by mid-2011 (of which a third through emission <lb/>rights purchases and two-thirds through projects reducing CO 2 emissions in developing countries). The <lb/>carbon prices paid are confidential. As mentioned, regions can also use flexible mechanisms. Such <lb/>investments are a viable Kyoto tool that encourages emission reductions in developing countries, where <lb/>they are likely to be cheaper. However, there is a risk that the strategy may be short-sighted. Such <lb/>18. <lb/>Part of is be due to Brussels-specific reasons – an urban character of housing (more blocks of flats), more <lb/>rented housing and more social tariff benefiters. Data for Flanders show that just above half of survey <lb/>respondents heard of the federal tax reductions, most of them in the higher income groups (Cour des <lb/>Comptes, 2009). <lb/></body>

			<body>purchases are financed through the federal surcharge on energy which is subject to a reduction for large <lb/>users, effectively shielding large emitters from external costs at the expense of small users. The result is <lb/>reduced incentives for restructuring towards a less polluting technology mix and &quot; green &quot; R&amp;D, which may <lb/>delay the necessary adjustment to a less carbon intensive economy. <lb/>Polluters must face the marginal cost of damages to ensure cost-efficient abatement <lb/>Environmental taxation is used far less than in other OECD countries (Figure 10). Fossil fuels taxes <lb/>are among the lowest in Europe (Table 6) resulting in a very low implicit CO 2 prices (Table 7) and a higher <lb/>than optimal use of fuels, likely skewing the production mix from labour to energy and dampening <lb/>incentives for energy-saving and environmentally friendly R&amp;D.

Eco-taxes – limited environmental effect so far <lb/>The eco-tax law (1993) introduced product taxes to discourage consumption of certain (environmentally <lb/>harmful) goods by encouraging a switch to less harmful substitutes; hence in principle the taxes were to yield <lb/>minimal revenues. The law included a first list of products subject to eco-taxation while further decisions were <lb/>left to a committee of experts established for this purpose. The proposed products were drink containers, some <lb/>types of industrial packaging, some disposable products (disposable razors till 1997 and cameras), batteries, <lb/>pesticides (abolished in 2001) and paper. Most products would be exempt if a collection and recycling scheme <lb/>was organised. <lb/>The main problems with these eco-taxes concern industry opposition to placing individual products on the <lb/>list, the lack of transparency and clarity of the motivation and the exclusion of major users of pesticides <lb/>(agriculture) from taxation. As a result, the goods subject to eco-taxes were mainly marginal yielding doubtful <lb/>environmental gains. Few products added to the list in due course: disposable plastic crockery, plastic bags, and <lb/>containers of ink, glue and solvent for professional use. The revenue from the eco-taxes is indeed negligible <lb/>(EUR 0.2 million in 2010) aside the tax on drink containers (EUR 200 million). <lb/>A country-wide carbon tax would reduce emissions and improve energy efficiency <lb/>Increasing the overall taxation of energy should bring about a cost-efficient reduction in emissions. <lb/>Well-designed energy taxation would entail pricing the associated emissions (or generally, pollution), <lb/>thereby giving polluters the appropriate and straightforward incentives to reduce harmful activity in a <lb/>cost-effective way (Box 6). This should be achieved by realigning excise taxes and introducing a carbon <lb/>tax on fuels. Current excise taxes on fuels have no relation to the environmental externalities – the implicit <lb/>carbon prices differ vastly among fuels and among different uses of the same fuel (Table 7).

			<body>neutrality should be introduced if the associated externalities do not differ too widely (there may be a <lb/>special case for transport fuels, see above). To ensure efficient abatement at minimum cost marginal <lb/>externalities should be built into prices. In particular, GHG externalities should be addressed with a carbon <lb/>price. As the ETS segment of the economy is de facto subject to a carbon price, a carbon tax should be <lb/>introduced for the non-ETS segment of the economy (primarily transport and housing, but also small <lb/>industry, services and agriculture), particularly as this is where emissions have been increasing over the <lb/>past two decades. 19 Given the high uncertainty about the optimal carbon price, the level of the carbon tax <lb/>should be chosen with the aim of achieving the Belgian GHG 20/20/20 objective. 20 In this light, the <lb/>government should establish a clear, credible timetable for the carbon tax (with some adjustment <lb/>possibilities) in order to provide sufficient incentives to invest in greener technologies and R&amp;D, as such <lb/>investment is likely to break-even only over a long time frame. The new carbon tax may need to be <lb/>adjusted to respect to EU guidelines, given recent EU Commission&apos;s proposals regarding changes in <lb/>energy taxations (EC, 2011). <lb/>Box 6. Cost-efficient &quot; green &quot; policies – polluters should face the marginal cost of externalities <lb/> &quot; Green-growth &quot; policies should aim at overcoming the market failures arising from: the environment being a <lb/>public good; the costs of monitoring and enforcement; imperfect or asymmetric information; and capital market <lb/>imperfections (De Serres et al., 2010, Duval, 2008). The main principles for choosing instruments to reach climate <lb/>change and environmental goals entail: <lb/>•  equalising the marginal abatement cost across emission sources to ensure lowest-cost abatement; <lb/> •  fostering an efficient level of innovation, in order to lower future abatement costs; <lb/> •  coping effectively with future risks and uncertainties.<lb/></body>

			<note place="footnote">Putting a price on the pollution source or over-exploitation of a scarce resource should improve the competitive <lb/>position of clean(er) technologies and goods and incentives to invest into green R&amp;D as the costs of pollution will be <lb/>integrated in the final prices. Pricing externalities can be done, for example, through a cap-and-trade scheme or a <lb/>polluter-pays (marginal) externality tax. In the presence of high monitoring and information costs, in particular when <lb/>emission sources are small and numerous (such as in transport or residential heating), the taxation of proxies (i.e. <lb/>fuels) can be a viable solution, conditional on a sufficiently robust link with the externality. <lb/></note>

			<body>Externality taxation usually meets opposition on competitiveness grounds and, in the case of <lb/>GHG emissions, because of the fear of carbon leakage. However, there is no obvious relation between <lb/>environmental tax revenues and competitiveness (HCF, 2009) in particular within a co-ordinated <lb/>EU approach. The ETS segment will face a carbon price by default, while the rest of the economy (mainly <lb/>transport and residential) is less directly exposed to international competition. As all EU countries <lb/>introduce measures to fulfil the 20/20/20 objectives, they impose a carbon price, explicit or implicit. The <lb/>wider the coverage of a uniform carbon price, the more likely that emissions are reduced at the lowest cost. <lb/>Carbon taxation will burden particularly heavy emission sources, but indeed this is the point of reorienting <lb/>the economy to a greener path. A balance, though, must be found between a gradual introduction, which <lb/>19. <lb/>During 1990-2009, Belgian non-ETS GHG emissions grew by 2.5%, while ETS emissions fell by 21%. <lb/>20. <lb/>Establishing an optimal carbon price is subject to the enormous uncertainty surrounding the economic <lb/>effects of GHG emissions and climate change, to materialize decades and centuries ahead. Meta-analyses <lb/>show a vast range of estimates – a mean price of a tonne of CO 2 from a survey of 232 estimates is around <lb/>EUR 60 (2010 prices) and the median around EUR 30, with extreme values not being uncommon (Tol, <lb/>2009, Kuik et al, 2009). Simulations performed for Belgium show that achieving 2020 goals would require <lb/>a carbon price of EUR 37 per tonne in the ETS segment and EUR 28 per tonne in the non-ETS segment <lb/>(Bassiliere et al., 2008, adjusted to 2010 prices). <lb/></body>

			<body>gives polluters time for less abrupt adjustment, and an excessively long phase-in which would punish <lb/>cleaner technologies and risk the failure of meeting international obligations. <lb/>At the moment, practically all Belgian ETS emission permits are grandfathered (granted for free based <lb/>on historical emissions) providing windfall profits to heavy polluters. This should not prevent an efficient <lb/>allocation of emission rights, as rights are tradable. However, it does imply transfers from energy <lb/>consumers to producers. Moreover, empirical evidence show producers passing on the opportunity costs of <lb/>holding CO 2 permits (obtained for free) to the wholesale price in most EU countries (Sijm et al., 2008) and <lb/>in particular in Belgium (CREG, 2008) where estimated windfall gains for electricity producers are in the <lb/>area of ½ per cent of GDP for 2005-07. Increasing the scope of auctioning would reduce windfall gains, <lb/>yield revenue and improve the governments&apos; experience in the auctioning system, but for the next few <lb/>years the effects will remain minute under EU limits on auctioning. In this case, the federal government <lb/>should consider fully taxing away the windfall profit gained from grandfathering of permits. 21 <lb/>A carbon tax would also encourage energy efficiency – currently promoted through tax reductions for <lb/>industry, voluntary agreements and requirements on utility suppliers. The federal government grants higher <lb/>corporate income tax deductions for energy-efficiency and green investments, while the regions revert to <lb/>voluntary agreements. Flanders and Wallonia have signed agreements with enterprises covering over 90% <lb/>of emissions, rewarding participants with tax benefits (such as exemptions from the federal excise tax on <lb/>fossil fuels), exemptions from selected regulatory requirements and financial aid. Electricity suppliers have <lb/>a public service obligation of saving energy (IEA, 2010) under which they are to achieve annual reductions <lb/>in final consumers&apos; energy use under the threat of a fine (Flanders and Brussels) or in return for a premium <lb/>(Wallonia). None of the measures seem a first best solution in a national context: tax breaks (CIT and <lb/>excise) come at a high fiscal cost, while voluntary agreements are generally unlikely to be very effective in <lb/>reducing emissions (De Serres et al., 2010) in particular if lower energy prices are granted in return. <lb/>Moreover, such measures may have undesirable effects on emissions if electricity (and gas) is substituted <lb/>with e.g. heating oil. Appropriate energy saving incentives should come from a national carbon tax. <lb/>Revenues from environmental taxation could be used to lower taxes on labour <lb/>The revenues from environmental taxation can be used to reduce more growth-distorting taxation, <lb/>such as on labour, aiding the transition from an energy-intensive economy and potentially preserving the <lb/>competitiveness of Belgian companies (see for example Bassilière et al., 2009). A well-designed shift in <lb/>the taxation burden from labour to energy would be likely to increase employment (Bassilière et al., 2005 <lb/>and 2009) but admittedly, with automatic wage indexation (OECD, 2011a), this effect may be limited if the <lb/>higher prices (due to environmental taxation, though potentially offset by lower labour costs) are translated <lb/>into wage increases. Simple static calculations show that revenues equal to 10-15% of labour taxation <lb/>could be obtained from a combination of: increasing environmental taxation to the EU average level; a <lb/>carbon tax (non-ETS segment); and taxing away of windfall gains from free permits (ETS) and scrapping <lb/>subsidies and tax reductions for transport, energy prices and energy-efficiency investments. Concerns <lb/>about the regressive nature of environmental taxes (poorer households tend to have a higher share of <lb/>energy in the consumption basket) could be addressed by focusing the reductions in labour taxation on the <lb/>lower end of the income distribution. Still, many of the existing measures (in-kind benefits such as <lb/>company cars, fuel cards, energy bills; energy efficiency subsidies) benefit mostly higher-income <lb/>households; hence their scrapping could increase the progressivity of fiscal policies (HCF, 2009). Finally, <lb/>21. <lb/>One of the concerns with electricity producers paying the price of CO 2 emissions is that wholesale <lb/>electricity prices are set reflecting the marginal price of the most expensive production site operating. The <lb/>carbon price increases this marginal price and thus creates a windfall gain for nuclear producers. In <lb/>principle, (part of) this profit can be taxed away, but in practice not for imported energy. <lb/></body>

			<body>higher revenues could also allow for more spending to improve the poor state of nature preservation <lb/>(Box 7). <lb/>Box 7. Environmental protection is costly, but should play a more important role <lb/>The strong pressure on the environment comes from dense population, intensive industry, agriculture and <lb/>transport. Land use reflects the high population density – residential and commercial services take up 19% of land use, <lb/>second in the EU and two-and-a-half times the EU average. Industry and transport use 6% of land area, twice the <lb/>EU average. Agriculture takes up 53%, leaving little space for nature. Despite progress in the recent years, Belgium is <lb/>the OECD country with the lowest surface of protected environmental areas per capita, and among the lowest in terms <lb/>of protected areas relative to total surface (the first and so far only national park of 57 square km was opened in <lb/>Flanders in 2006). The level of protection of these areas is generally lower than elsewhere. Together with years of <lb/>extremely poor surface water quality this has contributed to a situation where the share of threatened species among <lb/>indigenous fauna and flora are well above that in most OECD countries. The heavy implicit and explicit subsidies to <lb/>agriculture and land use policies have placed Belgium among the handful of OECD countries where the share of forest <lb/>land has not grown since 1990, reflecting in part poor take-up of EU agricultural land forestation programmes <lb/>(OECD, 2007a). <lb/>Source: OECD Environmental Data Compendium, World Database on Protected Areas, UN Millennium Development Goal Indicators. <lb/>Improvements in the area of water quality are visible, but suffer from a large backlog <lb/>Significant attention was devoted to water quality in a previous environmental chapter (OECD, 2001), <lb/>in part as the exploitation of water resources is among the most intensive in the EU. At the time, both <lb/>surface and underground water quality were among the poorest in the EU, due to the effective lack of <lb/>treatment of urban wastewater and very intensive agriculture. Brussels, with roughly 1 million inhabitants, <lb/>dumped its urban sewage directly to the Senne river. Since then, government efforts have reduced the <lb/>backlog in urban wastewater treatment. In 2001 the first treatment plant for Brussels, treating a third of its <lb/>sewage, was put in place. The unsatisfactory situation of the mid-2000s (Figure 11) has improved <lb/>significantly and by 2010 the number of agglomerations with insufficient treatment was reduced to 1 in <lb/>Flanders and halved to 30 in Wallonia. 22 A large part of the success in Flanders was due to large regional <lb/>subsidies to municipalities and a special-purpose public private partnership (OECD, 2007c). In 2009, a <lb/>second treatment plant for Brussels was operational, ensuring that the majority of households in the area is <lb/>connected to treatment. Nevertheless, by 2010, Belgium still had not implemented the urban wastewater <lb/>treatment directive, for which it is to be fined. 23 Full compliance is not expected before 2013. <lb/>22. <lb/>The assessment is done by the European Commission in light of the 1991 Urban Wastewater Treatment <lb/>Directive. Under the legislation, all urban waste water generated by agglomerations of over <lb/>10 000 inhabitants should be collected and treated before being discharged. Belgium has designated its <lb/>entire national territory as a &quot; sensitive area &quot; , the treatment must be more stringent to significantly reduce <lb/>phosphorous and nitrate levels in waters before they are discharged. <lb/>23. <lb/>In June 2010 the Commission has asked the Court to impose a lump-sum fine of more than € 15 million <lb/>and a daily penalty payment of nearly € 62 000. <lb/>ECO/WKP(2011)63 <lb/></body>

The use of such data <lb/>by the OECD is without prejudice to the status of the Golan Heights, East Jerusalem and Israeli settlements in the West Bank <lb/>under the terms of international law. <lb/>Source: OECD, Environment Database. <lb/>Water quality remains poor, with the EU water framework directive not being implemented due to <lb/>gaps in the harmonisation of definitions (among regions), in monitoring and in measures taken. Less than a <lb/>fifth of surface waters were classified as not at risk of fulfilling EU ( &quot; good status &quot; ) targets for 2015, one of <lb/>the poorest performances of the EU15 (EC, 2007 and EEB, 2010). National classifications for 2007-09 <lb/>show very poor surface and ground water quality, particularly in Flanders (UNECE, 2010). After an <lb/>improvement in the early 2000s, non-costal bathing water quality returned to poor levels with 13% of areas <lb/>nationwide (primarily in the south of the country) below minimum standards and monitoring problems <lb/>(EEA, 2009). <lb/>The regional division of powers may complicate the conduct of effective water policies, given that the <lb/>two main river basins do not follow regional borders. While the Belgian governments are co-operating <lb/>within international basin bodies, internal co-ordination failure is particularly visible in the Scheldt basin, <lb/>the recipient of Brussels wastewater (EEB, 2010). Hence, there is a need for either a national body or inter-<lb/>regional bodies responsible for river basins to be created in order to ensure cross-border co-ordination and <lb/>facilitate international co-operation. Such a reform would be in line with the requirements of the EU Water <lb/>directive, which stipulates basin-based river management, but would avoid bureaucratic complications <lb/>arising from separate river-basin authorities in each of the regions. <lb/>Water provision (and sanitation) is a municipality responsibility which is usually delegated to inter-<lb/>municipal organisations. Currently, all three regions have different water pricing schemes, with a free <lb/>quota in Flanders and cheap quotas in the two other regions. All three pricing strategies are based on a <lb/>fixed fee and a variable per-cubic-metre price aimed at reflecting costs of distribution, capital and <lb/>wastewater treatment. The variable price is lower for large users in all three regions. Given the persistent <lb/></body>

			<body>problems with assuring adequate treatment, it is likely that the incentives for private investors to provide <lb/>the services are insufficient. This can be improved by reviewing the charges for treatment to ensure <lb/>polluters pay for the marginal generated externality in the case of (large) enterprises (basing the charge on <lb/>pollution content of the discharge, as currently done in Flanders). For households, where monitoring and <lb/>enforcement are likely to be costly, but the pollution load relatively uniform, wastewater treatment charges <lb/>should remain incorporated in the water price, but transferred directly to the treatment provider (which is <lb/>already the case in Flanders) rather than to the general regional budget. Overall this may result in <lb/>increasing the tariff-financing of wastewater collection and treatment infrastructure. Finally, more <lb/>competitive forces in treatment provision should be encouraged by lower barriers to entry and wider public <lb/>tendering of contracts. <lb/>Agriculture is a major source of water pollution <lb/>Belgian agriculture is among the most intensive in the OECD, with particularly intensive animal <lb/>husbandry and pesticide and synthetic fertiliser use having a negative impact on water quality. Despite <lb/>being a heavy polluter, the sector benefits from extensive subsidies and preferential tax treatment, to a <lb/>higher degree than in many OECD countries (OECD, 2010). In particular, federal subsidies aimed at <lb/>increasing the reliance on bio-fuels (in line with the 20/20/20 goals) come at a high abatement costs (per <lb/>tonne of CO 2 ): EUR 200 in the case of biofuels and EUR 600-800 in the case of ethanol (with extreme <lb/>cases of up to EUR 2 000-4 400, Kutas et al., 2007). A more efficient strategy would be to impose a strict <lb/>mandatory share of biofuels in the fuel mix, similarly as in the GC market, and allow the market to <lb/>establish the price of individual biofuels. The sector is also fully exempt from excise taxation on fuels and <lb/>road and motor vehicle taxation, hence is exposed to lower incentives in terms of GHG reduction targets. 24 <lb/>In the area of water pollution, to combat phosphorus and nitrogen pollution from fertilisers regional <lb/>manure management systems introduced over the past decade and have led to substantial improvement <lb/>(Gybels et al., 2009). Additional benefits could be gained from a common system across the country, <lb/>particularly if, as has been proposed in Flanders, a system of tradable manure rights is introduced. In this <lb/>respect, a uniform, country-wide balancing system, with farm-level nutrient (nitrogen and phosphorus) <lb/>accounts and quotas, could prove an effective way to curb excessive manure and use of synthetic fertiliser. <lb/>Nutrient surplus above the quota would be subject to taxation. A system of this type is in place in Denmark <lb/>(OECD, 2007b). Finally, excessive pesticide use should be curbed through an externality tax. In the 1990s, <lb/>the eco-tax on pesticides in place in the 1990s, exempted the agricultural sector. This was replaced by a <lb/>federal tax on pesticides, linked to pollution content (by category), which can be considered a step in the <lb/>right direction, and by stricter command and control regulation, with some visible shifts to less polluting <lb/>pesticide. However, the pesticide tax is several times lower for professional users (that is the bulk of users) <lb/>and generally fairly low, in part due to cross-border leakage considerations. 25 As the effectiveness of a <lb/>sales tax on pesticide may be mitigated by cross-border trade due to the small country size, it would ideally <lb/>be co-ordinated with neighbouring countries. If this is not possible, taxing the use of pesticide (rather than <lb/>purchase) should be considered. <lb/>Environmental tools and policies should be co-ordinated and realigned <lb/>As mentioned throughout the paper, the division of environment-related powers and responsibilities in <lb/>Belgium is complex and fragmented. The three regions have a large share of responsibilities concerning <lb/>environmental policies and directly related areas: agriculture, economic policy, energy, transport and R&amp;D <lb/>24. <lb/>Nevertheless, the majority of agricultural GHG emissions take the form of methane (from enteric <lb/>fermentation and manure management) and nitric oxide (soil and manure management). <lb/>25. <lb/>A reason sometimes cited to back a higher tax for non-professionals is the fact that they may use pesticides <lb/>in a more harmful way (e.g. due to poor awareness). <lb/>ECO/WKP(2011)63 <lb/></body>

			<body>• The bodies responsible for environmental policies do not have the powers to use the most cost-<lb/>efficient tools. The regions lack of taxation power, prevents widespread use of externality <lb/>taxation. Instead regions revert to more costly and less effective subsidy measures, which often <lb/>reduce R&amp;D incentives by choosing winning technologies (De Serres et al., 2010). The result – a <lb/>multitude of instruments often leading to disappointing results, such as in energy efficiency <lb/>investments in housing.<lb/>• The administrative borders inhibit the implementation of efficient nationwide policies. In areas <lb/>such as water policies, air pollution management or transport policies, regional borders are <lb/>unlikely optimal boundaries.<lb/>• Smaller markets prevent the exploitation of the economies of scale and scope in environmental <lb/>policies, as visible for instance in the existence of (five) separate regional markets for green <lb/>power certificates, hindering cost-equalisation of renewable energy use across the country.<lb/>The division of environment-related responsibilities in a federation has been reviewed in a general <lb/>context in the previous Survey (OECD, 2009a). As a conclusion: i) an appropriate division of powers <lb/>should follow the division of responsibilities so that each government body can fulfil its tasks optimally; <lb/>and ii) in areas where significant economies of scale or scope can be reaped, at the minimum close and <lb/>swift co-operation should be ensured and moving competencies to the national level could be beneficial. <lb/>An example of such nation-wide co-operation can be found in case of waste-management (batteries) where <lb/>a single national entity takes care of collection and recycling (OECD, 2007a). <lb/>More rigour in planning and decision-making could facilitate choosing the optimal solutions for <lb/>reaching environmental goals. According to a review of federal climate change policies, the lack of proper <lb/>evaluation of the costs and effects of (federal) measures means that decisions have little to do with <lb/>economic reasoning (Cour des Comptes, 2009). Independent critical evaluations of regional environmental <lb/>policies and the interaction with policies at different levels are hardly available. In order to introduce more <lb/>economic rationale into environmental policy design, comparable cost benefit analysis (CBA) of all <lb/>important environment-related policies (and major investments above a certain threshold) should become <lb/>mandatory. 26 The independent analysis should apply national guidelines on parameters and methodology <lb/>and include the evaluation and assignment of monetary values to environmental effects, for example on <lb/>human health. Decisions to deviate from the CBA conclusions should be necessarily publicly explained. <lb/>Ex post analysis should follow up on existing and future projects and policies to provide feedback for <lb/>improvement of the CBA tool itself. <lb/>26. <lb/>At the moment cost benefit analysis (CBA) is generally done at the regional level for investment major <lb/>projects (as this is where they usually occur). Environmental Impact Assessment, an EU requirement, is <lb/>less analytically rigorous and concerns only environmental impact. <lb/></body>

Consider scrapping the <lb/>minimum prices for various types of renewable energy in order not to promote inefficient technologies and allow the <lb/>market (under the GC scheme) to decide the price and mix of renewable energy. <lb/>•  Encourage investment in renewable energy by removing regulatory obstacles and publishing credible paths for the<lb/>minimum requirements in the energy mix. Consider pursuing the targets for biofuels in a similar system. <lb/>•  Realign excise taxes on fuels with environmental marginal externalities. Take steps towards more uniform taxation of<lb/>different uses of the same fuels. Increase the relative taxation of diesel with respect to gasoline to reduce the diesel bias <lb/>and the associated environmental externalities. Scrap the reimbursement of part of the diesel price for professional use. <lb/>•  Implement country-wide road pricing for freight. Link distance-based user charges to associate externalities, including<lb/>pollution (by class of vehicle). Extend the scheme to company cars, and eventually including passenger cars. The <lb/>scheme would benefit from co-ordination with neighbouring countries. Consider congestion charges, particularly around <lb/>Brussels, either independently or as part of road pricing. <lb/>•  Phase out the numerous subsidies to private transport in order not to encourage moving away from the workplace or the<lb/>excessive use of cars. The commuting allowance, particularly for road transport, should be focused on persons otherwise <lb/>at risk of dropping out of the job market, and could take the form of a lump-sum allowance. <lb/>•  Increase the flexibility and demand-responsiveness of public transport to increase its attractiveness through better<lb/>co-ordination among regions and the federal train system, lower entry barriers, public tendering and the possibility for <lb/>operators to propose new routes. <lb/>•  Drastically reduce the numerous subsidies for energy efficiency investment in housing and for industry. At the least, make<lb/>sure that measures at different levels of government are co-ordinated in order to reach targets. Focus measures on <lb/>liquidity constrained low-income households. Improve the energy efficiency awareness among households. <lb/>•  Phase out the social energy tariffs and VAT reductions in order to expose households to the same marginal energy<lb/>saving incentives. Replace these with income subsidies for low income households. <lb/>Improve water quality <lb/>•  Delegate responsibilities for water policies to an independent national authority or river-basin authorities.<lb/>•  Review wastewater treatment charges to ensure polluters pay the full marginal costs of environmental externalities.<lb/>Encourage more competitive provision of wastewater treatment. <lb/>•  Introduce a pollution-content based pesticide tax on sales or application. Consider a country-wide manure and synthetic<lb/>fertiliser management scheme, with balancing farm-level accounts and quotas for nutrients. <lb/>The organisation of environmental policies needs to promote cost-efficiency <lb/>•  Increase the reliance on taxation of environmental externalities (rather than subsidies or command and control measures)<lb/>to implement environmental policies. <lb/>•  Reconsider the division of environmental responsibilities and powers in the federation with an aim of assuring: that the<lb/>responsible bodies have the most cost-efficient tools to achieve their goals (e.g. taxation powers); and the exploitation of <lb/>the economies of scale and scope (e.g. in renewable energy). <lb/>•  Increase the role of economic considerations in environmental policies by introducing compulsory cost-benefit analysis for<lb/>major investment projects and policies. Agree on national guidelines on parameters and methodology and follow up with <lb/>ex post analysis. <lb/></body>
