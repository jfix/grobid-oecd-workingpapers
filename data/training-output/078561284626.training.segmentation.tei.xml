			<front>REFORMING THE VALUATION AND FUNDING OF PENSION PROMISES: ARE <lb/>OCCUPATIONAL PENSION PLANS SAFER? <lb/>by Juan Yermo 1 <lb/>I. Introduction <lb/>Since 2001, occupational 2 defined benefit (DB) pension plans in OECD countries have experienced <lb/>an adverse funding situation, that is, a low ratio of assets to liabilities. The decline in funding ratios can be <lb/>traced to the low interest rate environment and poor equity market returns, together with longer term <lb/>pressures such as revisions in life expectancy assumptions. 3 Various regulatory initiatives have been <lb/>undertaken to address these funding gaps, some providing forbearance to plan sponsors, others aiming at <lb/>improving benefit protection outright. 4 At the same time, new accounting standards have been introduced <lb/>which aim at shining a bright light on what has been historically a rather obscure but major component of <lb/>the balance sheet of pension plan sponsors. <lb/>Policymakers face a difficult dilemma. If funding rules are tightened too much, employers may <lb/>altogether abandon DB plans. On the other hand, lax funding rules may expose workers to benefit losses if <lb/>underfunded plans are terminated by insolvent employers. A key question for policymakers (and the <lb/>actuarial and accounting professions) is to determine whether certain valuation methods used by regulators <lb/>and accountants may portray a misleading picture of the health of DB plans. In addition, it may be asked <lb/>why funding ratios were not higher in the good years, like the 1990s, given the possibility of adverse <lb/>developments in asset values and interest rates. Policymakers need to consider how regulations should be <lb/>reformed in order to best protect pension promises. Such deliberations should also take into consideration <lb/>the reform in accounting standards, as shareholders can be a powerful agent of change. <lb/>This chapter extends the discussion on funding by assessing current regulatory and accounting <lb/>developments in the OECD area against their purported goals. It specifically considers the different <lb/>approaches to valuing pension liabilities and questions the possibility of convergence between funding and <lb/>business accountants&apos; valuation standards for pension liabilities. The main conclusions are as follows: <lb/> Valuation methods for funding and business accounting purposes are likely to continue moving <lb/>towards a market-based model. Given this trend, policymakers should be all the more cautious in <lb/>1 The author is principal administrator of the private pensions unit at the OECD. He would like to thank the Delegates <lb/>to the OECD Working Party on Private Pensions, André Laboul (OECD), Chinu Patel (Watson Wyatt) and <lb/>Colin Pugh (independent consultant) for their comments on previous versions of this paper. The views <lb/>expressed are the sole responsibility of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of the OECD or its <lb/>member countries. <lb/>2 According to the OECD pensions taxonomy, an occupational pension plan is linked to an employment relationship <lb/>between the plan member and the entity that establishes the plan (the plan sponsor). Occupational plans <lb/>may be established by employers or groups of employers (e.g. industry associations), professional and <lb/>labour associations (e.g. trade unions). Generally, the plan sponsor is responsible for making contributions <lb/>under the terms of occupational pension plans, but employees may be also required to contribute. Sponsors <lb/>may also have administrative or oversight responsibilities for these plans. <lb/>3 See, for example, Schich (2005). Funding ratios recovered in 2006 as a result of rising long-term interest rates. <lb/>4 See Pugh (2007) in this volume for a description of recent reforms to funding regulations. The OECD <lb/>Recommendation on Guidelines on Funding and Benefit Security in Occupational Pension Plans is the <lb/>international standard on these regulatory issues (OECD (2007)). <lb/></front>

			<body>setting funding regulations so as to provide sufficient flexibility to pension funds in covering <lb/>funding deficits while providing incentives to establish funding buffers in good economic times. <lb/> While market-based valuation methods are becoming more prevalent, the measure of the pension <lb/>liability used for funding rules is likely to differ from that used in business accounting, because <lb/>of their different objectives. In particular, pension regulators are most concerned with the value <lb/>of accrued benefits (the accumulated benefit obligation or ABO), ignoring the impact of salary <lb/>increases. Accounting standards, on the other hand, take salary increases into account in order to <lb/>develop a measure of liabilities (the projected benefit obligation, or PBO) consistent with the <lb/>view of the enterprise as an ongoing concern. <lb/> The current application of fair value principles 5 to pension accounting standards is the subject of <lb/>much controversy. There is an ongoing debate about the right measure of liabilities (ABO or <lb/>PBO), the extent to which pension benefits are a debt of employers or can be adjusted, the <lb/>appropriate discount rate to be used, and the way to recognise actuarial gains and losses. Given <lb/>the uncertainty surrounding valuations based on ―mark-to-model‖ principles, accounting <lb/>disclosures by sponsoring companies should be at least accompanied with information about the <lb/>assumptions made and a sensitivity analysis. Policymakers should also consider the impact of the <lb/>volatility created by market-based valuations on companies&apos; balance sheets and income <lb/>statement. In particular, the removal of the smoothing options currently permitted by <lb/>international accounting standards could have an adverse impact on DB pension provision, the <lb/>application of efficient risk management strategies, and could potentially lead to procyclical <lb/>investment behaviour by pension funds. <lb/>This chapter is structured as follows. Section I provides a comparison of valuation methods for <lb/>pension assets and liabilities for both funding and business accounting purposes. There is special focus on <lb/>selected OECD countries (Denmark, Japan, Netherlands, Sweden, United Kingdom and the United States) <lb/>that have already or are in the process of moving towards a market-based approach to measuring pension <lb/>fund liabilities for regulatory funding purposes (insurance purposes in the UK case). Asset valuation <lb/>methodologies, which have been traditionally market-based but allowed some degree of smoothing, are <lb/>also moving towards a fair-value model. Market-based valuations have made even greater in-roads in the <lb/>domain of business accounting, as most OECD countries have implemented some variation of the <lb/>International Accounting Standards Board&apos;s pension standard (IAS 19). <lb/>Section II describes the recent trends in funding levels and recent regulatory initiatives in this sample <lb/>of OECD countries. There are substantial differences in many aspects of the regulation, namely what the <lb/>funding target should be, how quickly funding gaps should be eliminated (the recovery period), and what <lb/>the maximum funding level may be. These differences can be explained by a variety of factors. In <lb/>particular, it is argued that the regime of funding rules cannot be discussed in isolation from other policy <lb/>initiatives that affect benefit security, such as insolvency guarantee funds and priority rights in bankruptcy. <lb/>Funding rules should also take into consideration the extent to which pension funds have an automatic <lb/>claim on sponsor contributions from the plan sponsor, the extent to which benefit promises can be cut back <lb/>(in particular, revaluation and indexation factors), and whether employees may also be asked to make <lb/>additional contributions to the fund. <lb/>Section III reviews the aftermath of the funding gaps and these regulatory and accounting initiatives. <lb/>Changes in valuation standards (for both funding and accounting purposes) and the reform of funding rules <lb/>are likely to bring about higher funding levels, greater protection of pension rights and greater use of asset-<lb/></body>

			<body>liability modelling techniques. At the same time, it is quite possible that these initiatives will push some <lb/>plan sponsors to terminate their defined benefit plans. The demise of defined benefit plans may not be a <lb/>problem in itself if new arrangements appear that maintain some of the attractive features of those plans <lb/>(such as the targeting of salary related benefits via ―protected‖ defined contribution plans). However, in <lb/>some countries the emerging plan model is of the ―unprotected‖ defined contribution type, which offers <lb/>members investment choice and correspondingly lays all investment risks on individual members. <lb/>II. Measuring pension fund assets and liabilities for funding and accounting purposes <lb/>A transparent, consistent measurement of DB pension fund assets and liabilities is essential to ensure <lb/>good governance and effective supervision. While pricing pension fund assets is normally straight forward <lb/>(as long as they are traded in liquid markets), there are different views as to what is the relevant measure of <lb/>pension fund liabilities as (i) they are not traded in markets, (ii) they have special design characteristics <lb/>stemming from wage-benefit bargaining which can cause discretionary changes in future (and, in some <lb/>cases, even accrued) benefits, and (iii) there are no hedging assets that closely match the cashflows of <lb/>pension funds, which could be used to price their liabilities. <lb/>Various observers (e.g. Bader and Gold (2003), Exley (2006)) argue that such characteristics are not <lb/>obstacles to calculating ―market-equivalent‖ values of DB pension funds, applying what is referred to as <lb/>the fair value principle. Others (e.g. Day (2003), Plantin et al. (2005)) have argued that attempts at <lb/>―marking to market‖ pension fund liabilities can lead to a narrow focus on the short-term impact of <lb/>financial decisions, inducing sub-optimal long-term results. While the academic debate on the application <lb/>of fair valuation principles to pension funds (or indeed banks and insurance companies) is far from closed, <lb/>there is a general shift towards some form of fair value among pension fund regulators and accounting <lb/>standard-setters. <lb/>In most countries, there are at least two statutory measures of liabilities, one designated by the <lb/>pension regulator for funding purposes 6 and another one used by plan sponsors for business accounting <lb/>purposes. In addition, some countries like the United Kingdom and the United States require other <lb/>measures to be calculated for purposes of determining premiums to a guarantee fund (the Pension <lb/>Protection Fund – PPF – in the United Kingdom and the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation – PBGC -<lb/>in the United States). A market measure of the liabilities may also exist in the quoted premia that life <lb/>insurance companies charge for taking over pension liabilities. This so-called buy-out market has gained <lb/>importance in the United Kingdom in recent years and has established a fourth measure of pension <lb/>liabilities. <lb/>The difference between these measures can be significant. One rating agency, using the PBO measure <lb/>estimated a shortfall in the United States for the S&amp;P 500 companies of US$140billion (a funding ratio of <lb/>90.4 percent) in 2005, as against a surplus of some $250billion five years earlier. 7 On the other hand, the <lb/>PBGC – which uses a measure similar to the ABO to calculate funding ratios – estimated a shortfall for all <lb/>insured single-employer DB plans of a record US$339billion as of December 2005, for an average funding <lb/>ratio of 72 percent 8 . The funding deficit in multi-employer plans was over US$170bn, meaning a total <lb/>funding gap (for single and multi-employer plans) in the country of over US$500bn. <lb/></body>

			<note place="footnote">6 Some jurisdictions, such as most Canadian provinces, require a minimum funding valuation and an ongoing funding <lb/>valuation. This paper discusses only the minimum funding valuation, which is the main concern for <lb/>regulators.

			<body>The main differences between regulatory and accounting measures of liabilities relate to: <lb/> the actuarial cost method to be used; <lb/> the benefits to be considered, including benefit revaluation (for early leavers) and indexation (for <lb/>retirees) factors, and assumptions over the rate of withdrawal from the plan; <lb/> the choice of discount rate to calculate the present value of accrued benefits; and <lb/> the mortality tables and the adjustments to be made for future mortality trends, including those <lb/>specific to the plan. <lb/>With respect to the actuarial cost method, benefit allocation methods are becoming increasingly <lb/>popular over cost allocation methods, but different approaches exist with respect to other aspects of the <lb/>cost method. Regulators usually calculate benefits on the basis of current salaries (as in the current unit <lb/>credit method used to calculate the ABO) 9 while business accountants do so on the basis of future, <lb/>projected salaries (as in the projected unit credit method used to calculate the PBO). Actuarial cost <lb/>methods also differ in the extent to which extent actuarial gains and losses 10 and other supplemental <lb/>liabilities (like plan amendments and initial plan liabilities) may be amortised (spread) over time. 11 <lb/>Regulators and accountants also differ on the type of benefits that they include in their liability <lb/>measures. Regulators normally exclude revaluation and indexation factors from their measure of liabilities <lb/>unless they are required by law (as in Ireland – revaluation only -and the United Kingdom). Business <lb/>accountants, on the other hand, tend to account for these factors if they are considered a ―constructive‖ <lb/>obligation on the plan sponsor, where ―constructive‖ is defined as a reasonable expectation on the basis of <lb/>past behaviour or informal agreements. Regulators and accountants also make different assumptions with <lb/>respect to employees that leave the plan early. Regulators usually require that measures of liabilities <lb/>exclude withdrawal from service, while accountants use withdrawal rate assumptions. <lb/>The choice of discount rate also varies between regulators and business accountants. Many regulators <lb/>still apply a maximum discount rate, while accounting standards are based on market yields of fixed <lb/>income securities, typically those of corporate bonds. As shown in Table 1, the differences in discount <lb/>rates are substantial in most countries, the accountants&apos; discount rate being normally higher than that used <lb/>by regulators. The recent trend towards market-based discount rates among regulators is likely to bring <lb/>about some convergence in this key parameter. In particular, at the beginning of 2007, the Netherlands <lb/>joined Japan and the United States in linking the regulatory discount rate to the market yield of fixed <lb/>income securities. <lb/>9 The main exception is Spain, where regulators require DB plans to use a PBO measure of pension liabilities. <lb/>10 Actuarial gains (losses) are assets (liabilities) created by a positive (negative) departure of the experience of the <lb/>plan from the assumptions that underlie the actuarial cost estimates. They include both changes in actuarial <lb/>assumptions and experience gains and losses, the latter being deviations of actual from expected <lb/>experience. <lb/></body>

Few regulators require pension plans to take into account the expected <lb/>future evolution of mortality or to use the latest mortality data available. However, the main differences in <lb/>mortality assumptions occur not between regulatory and accounting measures in the same country but <lb/>across countries. A study by Cass Business School (2005) shows that only in some countries do pension <lb/>plans incorporate an allowance for expected future improvements in mortality. Most use tables that relate <lb/>to mortality observed over a period in the past. As shown in Figure 1, countries like Denmark and <lb/>Switzerland use mortality assumptions based on the national population mortality tables, without allowing <lb/>for expected future increases in life expectancy. The implications of these different assumptions for <lb/>liability measures are substantial. Antolin (2007) shows that an unexpected improvement in life expectancy <lb/>at birth of 1 year per decade would increase the liabilities of a typical pension fund by 10 percent, and up <lb/>to 20 percent for a fund with mainly young workers. <lb/></body>

In particular, regulators are increasingly requiring the use of discount rates that reflect market yields <lb/>of government bonds. This move towards market-based valuation is consistent with the regulator&apos;s goal of <lb/>promoting funding levels high enough to cover benefit promises in the case of plan termination. However, <lb/>the situation in some countries is still one where regulatory measures of pension liabilities are below the <lb/>plan termination liability. Like the termination liability and the ABO, the regulatory measure of pension <lb/>liabilities is based on accrued benefits, where no allowance is made for future salary increases. 13 However, <lb/>at termination, some countries like the United Kingdom and the United States require the pension fund&apos;s <lb/>assets to be used to buy deferred annuities (from a guarantee fund or from a private insurance company 14 , <lb/></body>

			<note place="footnote">12 Throughout this paper we refer to pension fund assets and liabilities, even though in some countries the liabilities <lb/>are assigned to the pension plan, rather the pension fund itself (which is only a vehicle to hold the plan <lb/>assets). The term pension plan is not used because a plan can be funded through vehicles other than <lb/>pension funds, such as pension insurance contracts. These funding vehicles are not the subject of this <lb/>paper. <lb/>13 Like the PBO, the ABO accounting measure is based on assumptions about employee turnover and death for a <lb/>continuing plan. Pension regulators, on the other hand, require the use of assumptions that reflect to a <lb/>greater extent the conditions of plan termination. <lb/>14 In the United Kingdom, it is also possible to use the newer ―buy-out‖ firms, most of which have been set up as <lb/>single-line insurers but can also be authorised as pension companies. <lb/></note>

			<body>depending on whether the termination was caused by the insolvency of the plan sponsor). As annuities are <lb/>priced above the regulator&apos;s liability measure, funding rules can give a false sense of security. The <lb/>elimination of the minimum funding requirement in the United Kingdom in 2005, and its replacement by a <lb/>scheme-specific funding standard is in part an answer to this concern. <lb/>Benefit allocation methods that projects benefits by taking into account future salary growth (PUC <lb/>method used to calculate the PBO) are more likely to value the actuarial liability above the plan <lb/>termination liability (all else, such as amortisation periods, actuarial assumptions and discount rates, being <lb/>equal). Yet even this method is the subject of some controversy. This method still creates a climbing ratio <lb/>of contributions to salary (contribution rate) over the service period of the worker. Before accounting <lb/>standards were adopted based on this method, employers in some countries used cost allocation methods <lb/>that aimed at a roughly constant contribution rate over the service period. In the United States, for <lb/>example, the percentage of large final pay plans using cost allocation methods declined from 90 percent in <lb/>1983 to 31 percent by 2002, while the percentage using a PUC-based benefit allocation method increased <lb/>from 10 percent to 69 percent (McGill et al (2005)). <lb/>A key aspect of the valuation of pension liabilities is the choice of discount rate. Regulatory <lb/>authorities often specify the discount rate to be used for calculating the present value of such accrued <lb/>benefits (i.e. the accrued liabilities). The prescribed discount rate usually takes the form of (i) a specific or <lb/>maximum rate, (ii) the current market yield on an identifiable group of securities or (iii) the rates implicit <lb/>in the purchase from insurance companies of immediate and deferred annuities. The choice of discount rate <lb/>can make a large difference to the measured value of accrued liabilities. A decrease of one percent in the <lb/>discount rate can lead to as much as a 30 percent increase in the liability. Market valuation methods usually <lb/>rely on bond yields as discount rates, instead of fixed rates set on a discretionary basis by the authorities. <lb/>Market discount rates can also be chosen to reflect the nature of the plan&apos;s liabilities such as the maturity of <lb/>the fund or the extent of benefit indexation. The new funding rules introduced in the United States under <lb/>the 2006 Pension protection Act, for example, require that discount rates are based on the high-quality <lb/>corporate bond yield curve, choosing maturities consistent with the duration of the plan&apos;s liabilities. <lb/>The main OECD countries that have introduced market-based liability valuations of DB pension funds <lb/>are Japan, the Netherlands, and the United States, while the United Kingdom has introduced such <lb/>valuations for purposes of calculating the insurance premia (levy) to be paid to the PPF. Discount rates in <lb/>all these countries are based on spot or a historic average of bond yields or equivalent swap rates. <lb/>In Japan, funding rules were reformed in 1997. Prior to this date, the discount rate used for calculating <lb/>liabilities was prescribed. Since then, the fund can decide its discount rate, which must within 80% to <lb/>120% of the average yield of 10-year government bonds issued during the previous five years. The <lb/>measure of accrued benefits also excludes future salary increases and early withdrawals from the plan by <lb/>departing employees. <lb/>In the Netherlands, the Financial Assessment Framework (Financieel Toetsings Kader --FTK) <lb/>introduced in January 2007 requires a market-based valuation of pension liabilities for funding purposes, <lb/>without any amortisation or smoothing options. As in other countries, estimated future salary growth is not <lb/>to be considered in the measure of accrued liabilities. Future benefits are discounted using the current yield <lb/>curve on default-free capital market instruments, rather than the fixed rate of 4 percent as has been <lb/>historically the case. 15 The market yield is corrected for expected inflation if indexation of accrued <lb/>pensions is ―unconditional‖, that is, if it does not depend on the performance of the pension fund. Liability <lb/>measures are also expected to take into account further increases in longevity. Sponsor companies are also <lb/></body>

			<body>required to separate the liabilities that are &quot;conditional&quot; on the investment performance of the pension fund <lb/>from those that are &quot;unconditional&quot;. Funding requirements are applied only to unconditional liabilities. <lb/>In the United States, one measure of pension liabilities is used for minimum funding requirements <lb/>while a different one is calculated by the PBGC. The PBGC&apos;s measure assumes plan termination and is <lb/>therefore market-based. The measure for funding purposes, on the other hand, has historically allowed long <lb/>amortisation periods 16 and the smoothing of both asset returns and discount rates over many years. 17 It also <lb/>relies on the current unit credit method (current salaries). The Pension Protection Act of 2006 has <lb/>overhauled funding requirements, including changes to pension liability measures. Transition measures <lb/>have been introduced for 2006 and 2007, but starting January 1st 2008, pension benefits will be discounted <lb/>using a corporate bond yield curve, where the timing of future benefit payments would determine the yield <lb/>to be used (based on the actual curve or three main rates for different maturity segments). The actual <lb/>discount rate used must be between 90% and 100% of the average over the last two years. Plan assets <lb/>under the new rules are also based on market value with permitted smoothing over 24 months. Smoothed <lb/>assets must be within 10% of market value. The Act has also introduced a true termination measure for <lb/>plans with funding ratios below 80%. Such plans are required to measure their at-risk liability which takes <lb/>into account additional costs incurred when a plan terminates. These costs are calculated by assuming that <lb/>workers eligible to retire within the next ten years will do so as early as possible and assuming that <lb/>beneficiaries choose the benefit option that creates the highest liability. Also, if a plan were at risk for at <lb/>least two of the preceding four years, its funding target would be increased by the administrative costs of <lb/>group annuity contracts. 18 <lb/>Meanwhile, in the United Kingdom, the new guarantee fund, the PPF, relies on market values of <lb/>pension fund assets and liabilities when calculating premiums to insure pension plans against the <lb/>bankruptcy of the plan sponsor. On the other hand, the new funding framework from the Pensions <lb/>Regulator (released in 2005) does not make any specific requirements with respect to valuation methods of <lb/>assets or liabilities, other than requiring trustees, under the advice of actuaries, to decide on the funding <lb/>objective appropriate for their plan and choose the actuarial assumptions prudently. 19 The flexibility of the <lb/>UK approach stems from their elimination of statutory funding rules. However, disclosure requirements <lb/>have been strengthened, and trustees are now required to instruct their scheme actuary to draw up at least <lb/>two actuarial valuations: one reflecting the liabilities as an ongoing concern and another one reflecting the <lb/>cost of securing benefits by the purchase of insurance policies. <lb/>In several other OECD countries that have not yet moved to market-based valuations of DB pension <lb/>fund liabilities, policymakers have at least required a change in the fixed or maximum discount rates used <lb/></body>

			<note place="footnote">16 The initial unfunded liability and plan amendments could be amortised over 30 years. Experience gains and losses <lb/>could be amortised over 5 years in the case of single-employer plans and 15 years in the case of multi-<lb/>employer plans. Changes in actuarial assumptions could be amortised over 15 years in the case of single-<lb/>employer plans and 15 years in the case of multi-employer plans. Neither statutes nor regulations defined <lb/>the amortisation period applicable to changes in unfunded liabilities resulting from changes in actuarial <lb/>cost methods and asset valuation methods. <lb/>17 Since 2004, the discount rate can be chosen from a range between 90 and 105 percent of the weighted average yield <lb/>of 30-year Treasury securities during the four-year period preceding the plan year. Between 2001-5, when <lb/>issuance of this bond stopped, the Treasury used a proxy monthly interest rate that attempted to mimic <lb/>what this rate would have been. <lb/>18 See Warshawsky (2007). <lb/>19 When choosing discount rates, trustees should take into account either or both the yield on assets held by the fund <lb/>to pay for future benefits and the anticipated future returns on those assets and the market redemption <lb/>yields on government or other high-quality bonds. <lb/></note>

			<body>in line with market developments. In Switzerland, for example, it is regulated that for the calculation of <lb/>accrued benefits the discount rate must be set at 3.5 to 4.5%. In practice, a specially authorized second <lb/>pillar expert sets this parameter according to the long-term return rate of a low-risk instrument (e.g. the <lb/>Swiss Confederation bond with a maturity of 10 years) or according to the average return of the pension <lb/>fund minus a safety margin. In Germany, the discount rate for calculating Pensionskassen liabilities was <lb/>lowered from 3.25 percent in 2003 to 2.75 percent in 2004 (same as for other pension insurance contracts). <lb/>A further lowering to 2.25 percent is envisaged from 2007 onwards. In Austria, the discount rate was <lb/>lowered to 3.5 percent in 2003. In Finland, the statutory discount rate is being reduced gradually from 4 <lb/>percent in 2003 to 3.5 by 2013. Countries where discount rates have not been changed in recent years <lb/>include Spain (4 percent) and Portugal (4.5 percent). <lb/>The move towards market-based valuations has also taken place in countries such as Denmark where <lb/>occupational pensions are DC from an accounting (sponsor) perspective, but the pension funds offer <lb/>minimum return and benefit guarantees. Industry-wide pension funds (and other pension companies 20 ) <lb/>have been able to present their account on the basis of fair values since 1 January 2002. Starting on 1 <lb/>January 2003, this has been made compulsory. The main features of the Danish market-based approach are <lb/>the use of an adjusted yield curve of euro swap rates to set discount rates 21 , the immediate recognition of <lb/>actuarial gains and losses and the use of current salaries to calculate benefits (CUC method). <lb/>Similarly, in Sweden, the move to market valuation came into force on January 1, 2006 for life <lb/>insurance companies and other insurance undertakings qualifying as institutions for occupational pension <lb/>provision as defined under the EU Directive. The reform to valuations took place together with the <lb/>adoption of the prudent person rule for regulating investments. Starting 1 January 2007, market discount <lb/>rates are set based on an average of government bond yields and swap rates, replacing the current fixed 3 <lb/>percent rate (3.5 percent until April 2003). <lb/>Valuation methods for accounting purposes <lb/>In the past, business accounting standards in some OECD countries (e.g. the Netherlands, <lb/>Switzerland) did not require companies that sponsor DB pension plans 22 to show on their balance sheet the <lb/>net balance of the pension fund&apos;s assets and liabilities. Sometimes, disclosure was only required in the <lb/>notes to the accounts, as was the case in the United States until the reform by the Financial Accounting <lb/>Standards Board (FASB) in September 2006. Even where disclosure was required, local accounting <lb/>standards permitted a significant degree of flexibility in the recognition of certain liabilities, with long <lb/>amortisation periods for initial plan liabilities, plan amendments, and actuarial gains and losses. Assets <lb/>were sometimes measured at book values, or market values smoothed over some years. In addition to the <lb/></body>

			<note place="footnote">20 Other pension companies include life-insurance companies and labour-market related life-insurance companies. All <lb/>these pension companies are subject to the Act on Insurance Companies. Other pension providers, e.g. the <lb/>Danish Labour Market Supplementary Pension Scheme (ATP) and LD Pensions, and company pension <lb/>funds are subject to separate acts. <lb/>21 The spread allows for the difference between euro rates and swap rates in Danish krone. Until the beginning of <lb/>2009, pension funds will be able to use instead a flat discount rate based on the average yield on three <lb/>government bonds with an average duration of 10 years. <lb/>22 The accounting definition of defined benefit plans is similar to that of the OECD and includes all plans in which the <lb/>sponsor has a legal or constructive obligation to pay further contributions to an ongoing plan in the event of <lb/>unfavourable plan experience. Following this definition, so-called hybrid plans (such as cash balance <lb/>plans), where the sponsor is responsible for meeting a minimum of fixed rate of return on investment <lb/>investments, are classified as defined benefit.

			<body>opaqueness of reporting, the lack of an international valuation standard for pension expensing hampered <lb/>cross-country comparison of company accounts by investors. <lb/>This situation has been changing rapidly in recent years with the advent of international accounting <lb/>standards for post-employment benefits, including pensions. There is currently a high degree of <lb/>convergence in business accounting standards towards market-based valuation, driven by the efforts of the <lb/>International Accounting Standard Board (IASB) and FASB. IASB&apos;s standard for net pension liabilities, <lb/>the so-called IAS19 standard, was approved in May 1999 and has been gradually adopted by many OECD <lb/>countries. A new standard based on IAS19 was introduced in Japan in April 2000, while in the United <lb/>Kingdom the new standard FRS17 was introduced in November 2001. The European Council adopted a <lb/>resolution in June 2002 which required all listed companies based in the European Union to comply with <lb/>this IASB accounting standard (and other International Financial Reporting Standards) in the preparation <lb/>of their consolidated group accounts for years commencing on or after 1 January 2005. 23 <lb/>IAS19 is based on market valuation principles, using the PBO measure of pension liabilities <lb/>(projecting benefits including the effect of future salary growth). Benefits are discounted at a suitable <lb/>corporate bond rate and actuarial gains and losses may be either amortised over the remaining service <lb/>period of plan members (above a 10 percent corridor) or immediately recognised in the profit and loss <lb/>account (see Box 1). A revision in December 2004 introduced a third option, immediate recognition in a <lb/>separate income statement (see Box 1). The latter is actually the only method permitted under the United <lb/>Kingdom&apos;s own accounting standard, the so-called FRS17. Under FRS 17, actuarial gains and losses are <lb/>fully and immediately recognised in a Statement of Recognised Gains and Losses (STRGL), which can be <lb/>viewed as a supplementary profit and loss account. <lb/>The IAS 19 standard has been integrated into other EU countries&apos; national accounting standard for <lb/>listed companies. However, some countries permit a rather different accounting for non-listed companies. <lb/>This is the case in Germany, which may be explained by the book reserving method which is still popular <lb/>among mid-sized employers 24 . Although local German accounting rules (HGB) permit pension obligations <lb/>incurred prior to 1987 to be ignored entirely for balance sheet accrual purposes (they must be disclosed in <lb/>the notes to the accounts), almost all companies fully recognize pension plan liabilities on the balance <lb/>sheet. The actuarial valuation method and the assumptions (e.g. a discount rate of 6 percent) are usually <lb/>transposed unaltered from the tax accounts to the financial statements primarily on the grounds of <lb/>simplification and the desire not to have diverging tax and financial statements. Under German accounting <lb/>rules, the valuation of liabilities is made on the basis of current salaries and there is a requirement for <lb/>immediate recognition of past services costs as well as actuarial gains and losses. This contrasts with the <lb/>valuation method under IAS 19 (projected salaries and option to defer recognition of actuarial gains and <lb/>losses). Hence, the actual liability reported on the balance sheet under German accounting standards may <lb/>be higher or lower than that recognized under IAS 19. The German accounting standards board recently <lb/>rejected a draft accounting standard (E-DRS 19) that followed similar principles to those of IAS 19, but <lb/>required immediate recognition of actuarial gains and losses in annual expense. <lb/>The implementation of IAS19 was smoother in the Netherlands, although there has been some debate <lb/>over the classification of some Dutch pension plans. Dutch accounting guideline RJ 271, while based on <lb/>IAS 19, leaves some discretion when determining whether a plan is defined benefit or defined contribution. <lb/>In 2003, the Dutch accounting standards board, RJ, ruled that the sponsoring company only bears the <lb/>defined benefit liability if that fact is specifically stipulated in its financial agreement with the pension <lb/></body>

			<body>foundation. This contrasts with IAS 19 which requires plans to be classified as defined benefit (and <lb/>liabilities to be recognised on the sponsor&apos;s balance sheet) if there is a ―constructive‖ obligation on the part <lb/>of the plan sponsor to meet pension promises. Following this debate, the government has proposed that <lb/>plan documents specify whether benefit promises are conditional (on pension fund performance) or not and <lb/>whether the plan sponsor is responsible for meeting any funding shortfalls. This should help clarify the <lb/>accounting treatment of pension fund liabilities. <lb/>Box 1. International pension accounting standard IAS19 <lb/>IAS 19 prescribes the accounting and disclosure rules with respect to employers&apos; benefits, in particular &quot;post-<lb/>employment benefits such as pensions, other retirement benefits, post-employment life insurance and post-<lb/>employment medical care&quot;. Post employment benefits plans are classified as either defined contribution plans or <lb/>defined benefit plans. Under IAS 19 recommendations, unfunded pension benefits are to be recorded, as a general <lb/>rule, as liabilities in the balance sheet of the sponsoring employer. The International Accounting Standards Board <lb/>(IASB) clearly distinguishes two categories: defined contribution plans and defined benefits plans. In defined <lb/>contribution plans, the employer&apos;s annual contribution under the terms of the occupational plan should be recognised <lb/>as an expense. For defined benefit plans, the rule&apos;s most noteworthy aspects are the following: <lb/> In general, unfunded pension benefits in defined benefit plans should be recorded as a pension liability in <lb/>the employer&apos;s balance sheet (see amortisation rules below). Actuarial gains and losses (including <lb/>investment) can be either (i) immediately recognized in the earnings statement, (ii) not reflected on the <lb/>balance sheet if within a range of 10% of plan assets or obligations (actuarial gains and losses above/below <lb/>this level can be amortised over the working life of employees.), or (iii) immediately recognised in a special, <lb/>below-the-line statement. <lb/> The projected unit credit method should be used for valuing pension liabilities, as in the PBO measure. <lb/>Under IAS19, these pension liabilities are referred to as the defined benefit obligation (DBO). The valuation <lb/>method involves the projection of salaries to the estimated time of realisation of the insured event <lb/>(retirement, disability, death, departure from company, etc). The discount rate to value liabilities should be <lb/>based on high quality corporate bond yields at the balance sheet date. Indexation and other benefit <lb/>increases should be taken into account to the extent that they are part of the formal or constructive terms of <lb/>the plan. <lb/> Pension plan assets should be valued at fair value (smoothing is not permitted). Discount cash flows should <lb/>not be used if market values exist. A pension plan surplus may be deemed as an asset of the sponsoring <lb/>employer to the extent the surplus might be refunded to the company or used to reduce future contributions. <lb/>Accounting reform has also taken place outside the EU. The Japanese accounting standard (ASRB) <lb/>was introduced in 1998 and became operative for financial years starting April 1, 2000. As is the case <lb/>under IAS 19, Japanese employers must recognise their pension liabilities on the balance sheet. The main <lb/>difference with IAS 19 is that the Japanese standard does not use the corridor method for actuarial gains <lb/>and losses. Also, the discount rate used to calculate the pension liabilities can be based on yield <lb/>fluctuations during the previous five years of long-term government or high quality corporate bonds. In <lb/>practice, the 5-year average of the 30-year government bond yield is often used as the reference rate, as <lb/>annuity conversion rates used by the Pension Fund Association for members who leave their employer or <lb/>at plan termination are based on this rate. <lb/>A new pension accounting standard was also introduced in Australia in January 2006, while in March <lb/>2007, the Korean Financial Supervisory Commission and the Korea Accounting Institute made a similar <lb/>announcement. Both standards are largely consistent with IAS 19, requiring the recognition of the net <lb/>value of DB pension plans on the company&apos;s balance sheet and changes therein in the profit and loss <lb/>statement. The implications for the Australian pension system, however, are quite limited, as DB pension <lb/>funds represent only a small part of the overall market. <lb/></body>

			<page>14 <lb/></page>

			<body>The other main pension accounting standard, the United States&apos; FAS 87, was reformed in September <lb/>2006 as a result of FASB&apos;s approval of the Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 158 (SFAS <lb/>158). The reformed standard is very close to the United Kingdom&apos;s FRS17, as immediate recognition of <lb/>actuarial gains and losses is now required (see Table 2). The other main features of the US standard, such <lb/>as the use of the PBO as the measure of pension liabilities and the use fair values for the investment <lb/>portfolio are also in line with FRS 17 and IAS 19. A new pension accounting standard is also expected to <lb/>be introduced in Canada by the end of 2007 which would bring it into line with the new US standard. <lb/>Among the main changes, the new standard would bring the difference between the pension assets and <lb/>liabilities onto the balance sheet. <lb/>Table 2.

International efforts to create convergence in national pension <lb/>standards and to improve the transparency of pension disclosures are to be commended and further <lb/>encouraged. However, it is essential that the standards also promote the reliability and relevance of <lb/>accounts for investors and company managers. <lb/>The new pension accounting standards are expected to portray more accurately the exposure that <lb/>shareholders have to unfunded pension liabilities by calculating their ―fair value‖. Yet, DB pension funds <lb/>exist precisely because there is no security in the market with a similar pay-off schedule as the cashflows <lb/>generated by a DB pension fund. 25 Pension liabilities have very long durations and are related to economic <lb/>variables (such as prices, salaries, and labour turnover rates) and demographic factors (such as mortality <lb/>rates), that, with the exception of inflation, are not incorporated into existing securities. Hence, attempts at <lb/></body>

			<note place="footnote">25 As argued by Whittington (2006), laying off a salary-linked DB liability to a third party would raise a moral hazard <lb/>problem because the sponsoring employer retains control over salaries and hence over the debt. <lb/></note>

			<page>15 <lb/></page>

			<body>―marking-to-market‖ pension liabilities represent modelled predictions of value, rather than observed <lb/>market prices. 26 <lb/>The application of market valuation to pension liabilities can nevertheless be facilitated if pension <lb/>liabilities can be sold to third parties. The development in the United Kingdom of the bulk annuity market <lb/>for pension buyouts could therefore lend further support to the application of market-based valuations. 27 <lb/>However, accounting standards must first solve the internal inconsistency of attempting to derive a market <lb/>value for pension liabilities while at the same time aiming at estimating the value of liabilities as an <lb/>ongoing concern. In particular, the PBO, which is the required measure of pension liabilities by IAS 19 and <lb/>other accounting bodies, does not correspond to the liability that would be sold by an employer to a third <lb/>party. The liability at termination should not take into account the effect of future salary increases (like the <lb/>ABO), but should normally be based on insurance company valuations. In most cases, such valuations <lb/>would be higher than the accounting measure. <lb/>The choice of discount rate under IAS 19 is also the subject of controversy. In principle, the discount <lb/>rate should reflect the duration of pension liabilities and take into the account their stochastic nature. If <lb/>assets are measured at fair values, benefits should be discounted using stochastic, not fixed discount rates. <lb/>For the purpose of pricing pension liabilities, the level of the discount rate should be determined by factors <lb/>such as the covariance between wage inflation (the driver of defined benefit pension liabilities) and <lb/>financial asset prices. Yet, under international accounting standards the market value of corporate bond <lb/>yields are used to discount liabilities, without any allowance for the riskiness of pension liabilities and their <lb/>covariance with equity returns. While it may be argued that the use of corporate, rather than government, <lb/>bond yields already provide an allowance for risk (as corporate yields are normally above government <lb/>ones), the adjustment may not be appropriate for pension liabilities. 28 Moreover, if fair valuation was <lb/>strictly applied, each pension fund&apos;s liabilities should require a specific discount rate adjustment to reflect <lb/>the risk of default of the specific sponsor. <lb/>A final area of contention is that in some countries the net pension liability of the plan sponsor may be <lb/>lowered via additional employee contributions or reductions in benefits. In a few countries pension <lb/>liabilities take the form of promises, rather than contractual obligations. 29 These promises may be adjusted <lb/>in adverse states of the world, creating embedded options that are open to subjective valuation. It is only <lb/>through the initiative of pension regulators that some of these promises have become a true debt on the <lb/>plan sponsor. For example, regulators in many OECD countries prohibit reductions in accrued benefits in <lb/>nominal terms, and some (e.g. in Ireland and the United Kingdom) even require the protection of benefits <lb/>in real terms for employees that depart before retirement (up to a specific revaluation factor). <lb/></body>

			<note place="footnote">26 This type of valuation method is also referred to as ―marking-to-model‖. <lb/>27 There are limits to bulk buy-outs stemming in the first instance from price considerations, because insurers are <lb/>subject to stricter prudential standards in their valuations than pension funds (and must return a competitive <lb/>return to their shareholders&apos; capital). Buy-out valuations of pension liabilities are even higher than those <lb/>under FRS17 (by 20-30 percent, according to market sources). Furthermore, there are practical problems <lb/>with buy-outs of the larger funds. The market pricing of these termination liabilities may therefore not be <lb/>ascertainable. <lb/>28 Khorasanee (2004) has estimated the equilibrium risk premium for discounting UK defined benefit liabilities at <lb/>about 0.4% per annum. This small risk premium is caused by the low standard deviation of real salary <lb/>growth and the relatively high long-term correlation between equity returns and salary growth. <lb/>29 This is the case of nominal benefits in Japan and Portugal and of revaluation and indexation factors in the <lb/>Netherlands. <lb/></note>

			<page>16 <lb/></page>

			<body>Given all these considerations, it may be questioned whether the move towards market-based <lb/>valuations has been correctly undertaken by accounting bodies. Moreover, it is not clear that the volatility <lb/>created on the sponsoring company&apos;s balance sheet and income statement (especially with immediate <lb/>recognition of actuarial gains and losses, as under FRS 17 and the reformed US standard, SFAS87) is <lb/>conducive to better decision-making by company managers or better asset allocation decisions by pension <lb/>funds. 30 In mature industries, with large pension funds, even small changes in the pension fund&apos;s funding <lb/>status can cause wide swings in the reported earnings of the firm. There is actually little evidence that fair <lb/>value accounting of pension plans better meets the information needs of investors. 31 Even if it did, the <lb/>impact of fair valuation on companies&apos; willingness to sponsor DB pension funds should be carefully <lb/>considered by policymakers, as pension funds offer retirement income products that are not available in the <lb/>market. 32 There are also important ramifications for financial stability and the possible procyclical <lb/>behaviour induced by fair value accounting standards that should also be carefully considered. 33 <lb/>Given the uncertainty surrounding market-based valuation of pension liabilities for accounting <lb/>purposes, it seems as a minimum necessary to carry out a thorough assessment of the risks underlying <lb/>pension funds, to provide a detailed description of the assumptions behind any valuation model, and to <lb/>subject any estimates to sensitivity analysis. 34 Such sensitivity analysis, based on stochastic modelling of <lb/>the cashflow streams, can provide more relevant information about the funding status of a pension fund <lb/>than the static deficit measure required by international accounting standards. 35 Such information, which <lb/>may be incorporated in the notes to the company&apos;s annual report, may improve investors&apos;, company <lb/>managers&apos;, and pension fund members&apos; understanding of the relevance and reliability of the accountants&apos; <lb/>estimates. <lb/>Accounting standard-setters also need to resolve the various approaches currently permitted for <lb/>recognising actuarial gains and losses (see Box 1). The spreading of actuarial gains and losses over time <lb/>and the use of 10% ―corridor‖ may be justified by the limited reliability of the ―mark-to-model‖ valuation <lb/>approach. However, the possibility of smoothing values also gives an incentive to companies to make <lb/>unrealistic assumptions about rates of return on invested assets. Under international accounting standards, <lb/>the assumed rate of return on assets should reflect historic investment performance of the pension fund. <lb/>However, accounting rules often do not provide detailed instructions for picking each year&apos;s rate. In the <lb/>United States, the use of high assumed rates of return helped companies smooth out the impact of <lb/>investment risk on the company&apos;s financial performance. Throughout the 1990s, investment rate <lb/>assumptions of over 8 percent were common. Since the bursting of the stock market bubble, however, most <lb/>30 Borio and Tsatsaronis (2005) argue that ―accounting standards might distort valuations and induce ―artificial‖ <lb/>volatility in a firm&apos;s financial statement, thereby also influencing its behaviour, not least its risk <lb/>management decisions, in ways that are contrary to economic logic.‖ Groome et al (2006) argue that ―it is <lb/>not clear that the volatility associated with fair value accounting measures properly focuses insurance <lb/>companies or pension funds on effective risk management objectives‖. <lb/>31 See Hann et al. (2004). <lb/>32 This argument applies even if fair value valuation methods can be reliably applied (see Kortleve and Ponds (2006). <lb/>33 Burkhardt and Strausz (2004) and Plantin et al. (2005) show how fair value accounting may heighten incentives for <lb/>procyclical investment behaviour among banks and insurance companies. A similar argument can be made <lb/>about pension funds. <lb/>34 Borio and Tsatsaronis (2005) also suggest disclosing information on ―measurement error, be this as a result of <lb/>model error or of intentional misreporting‖. <lb/>35 A report by the Association of British Insurers (2007) models a pension fund&apos;s cash flows and compares them <lb/>against the FRS 17 pension deficit measure. It finds that ―there is no clear correlation between the size of <lb/>the FRS 17 deficit and the financial health of the plan. A decrease in staff turnover, for example, had the <lb/>largest impact on the FRS 17 deficit even though the scheme remained financially solvent‖. <lb/></body>

			<page>17 <lb/></page>

			<body>companies have continued to use such assumptions despite the fact that returns have been substantially <lb/>lower for the past five years. According to Coronado and Sharpe (2003), return smoothing contributed to <lb/>an overvaluation of equity prices of 5% on average after the bubble burst in 2000. Gold (2001) argues that <lb/>the ―opaque‖ pension accounting system has encouraged an overexposure to equities that would be <lb/>corrected if it was based on a fair value methodology. <lb/>A priori, market-based valuation of pension liabilities seems more relevant for regulatory purposes. <lb/>The regulator&apos;s focus is on the value of accrued benefits if the plan is terminated (or ―frozen‖ -accruals are <lb/>discontinued) as well as the transfer value of accrued benefits for workers that switch to a different pension <lb/>fund. Market-based valuations can provide a more realistic picture of the pension fund&apos;s solvency and can <lb/>be used to calculate transfer values in a fair, independent manner. However, some of the concerns raised <lb/>over the potential for short-termist and procyclical investment behaviour also arise in a regulatory context, <lb/>especially if regulations require pension funds to restore full funding -measured on a market-basis -or the <lb/>build-up of buffers (or solvency margins) over relatively short periods. <lb/>The regulators&apos; concern solvency contrasts with the accountant&apos;s goal of assessing as accurately as <lb/>possible the present value of these long-term commitments as an ongoing concern. In particular, regulators <lb/>are increasingly concerned about the termination value of liabilities and are often taking this measure of <lb/>liabilities into account when designing funding rules. For regulators, therefore, the ABO, rather than the <lb/>accountants&apos; PBO, is the relevant measure of pension liabilities. <lb/>There are other important differences between accounting and funding perspectives on pension fund <lb/>liabilities. First, from a funding perspective, the valuation of liabilities is also an issue for defined <lb/>contribution plans that carry some return or benefit collectively guaranteed by the plan members or the <lb/>pension fund, without any risk on the plan sponsor. 36 Regulators of these so-called pooled-risk or collective <lb/>defined contribution plans, which exist in countries like Denmark and Iceland and are becoming popular in <lb/>the Netherlands, require measures of their liabilities, but they have no impact on the balance sheet of the <lb/>plan sponsor. The accounting treatment of the sponsoring employer is that of a defined contribution plan <lb/>under both the OECD and IASB definitions. Hence, the difference between the pension fund&apos;s liabilities <lb/>and assets should not be shown on the sponsor&apos;s balance sheet. <lb/>Second, pension regulators do not allow pension funds to make an allowance for sponsor default risk <lb/>when calculating pension liabilities for funding purposes, as it would defeat the purpose of funding <lb/>requirements. 37 Regulators also tend to prefer a conservative estimate of pension liabilities, rather than one <lb/>purely reflecting market conditions in an unbiased manner. For these reasons, regulators&apos; discount rates <lb/>tend to be below those stipulated by accounting standards. Regulators also tend to make more conservative <lb/>assumptions about vesting and withdrawal rates. <lb/>For these reasons, and despite the potential advantages in terms of lower administrative burdens and <lb/>higher transparency, single-track reporting for accounting and funding purposes seems rather far-fetched. <lb/>On the other hand, establishing coherence between funding and accounting requirements should be on the <lb/>36 The EU Directive on Institutions for Occupational Pension Provision actually requires that pension entities that <lb/>underwrite any investment or biometric risk are subject to the solvency regulations contained in the Third <lb/>Life Insurance Directive. The OECD Recommendation on Guidelines on Funding and Benefit Security in <lb/>Occupational Pension Plans (OECD (2007)) also refers to the need for additional buffers or a solvency <lb/>margin in such cases. <lb/></body>

			<note place="footnote">37 If a higher discount rate is used to value pension liabilities linked to weak plan sponsors, the resulting required <lb/>funding level will be lower. An adjustment for default risk would be made in a true market-based system. <lb/>Accounting standards require the use of a common discount rate, based on AA corporate discount rates, <lb/>while regulators tend to prefer government bond discount rates. <lb/></note>

			<body>agenda as one of the key objectives of any future reform to international accounting standards and <lb/>regulators&apos; valuation rules. In particular, the economic and demographic assumptions used for funding and <lb/>accounting purposes should be consistent, and where relevant (e.g. wage or inflation forecast or mortality <lb/>risk estimates over a common period for the same group of individuals) they should be identical. Such <lb/>objectives call for closer cooperation between accounting standard setters, the actuarial profession, and <lb/>pension regulators. <lb/>III. Revisiting funding gaps and the public policy reaction <lb/>The funding status of DB pension funds deteriorated throughout the OECD after 2000. 38 Figure 2 <lb/>below shows the two main accounting measures of pension liabilities, the ABO and PBO, for a sample of <lb/>pension funds in selected OECD countries. On a PBO basis, the highest funding ratios in 2005 were <lb/>observed in Australia and Norway, while the lowest ones were those of pension funds in Japan. As <lb/>expected, also, ABO funding ratios are substantially higher than PBO ones. On the basis of ABO <lb/>measures, pension fund solvency is mainly a concern in Japan, though funding ratios were also low in <lb/>Canada, Switzerland and the United Kingdom (around 0.90). <lb/>Figure 2.

At the same time, regulators should act with moderation at times of market distress and <lb/>unusual, transitory valuations, such as those observed on long-term bonds in recent years. <lb/>As accountants and regulators adopt market-based valuation standards, the volatility in security prices <lb/>means that funding levels can fluctuate drastically in relatively short periods. It is therefore even more <lb/>important to reform maximum funding rules so that they take into account this inherent volatility of <lb/>security prices and in particular the infrequent, but big risks, the so-called ―fat tails‖ of frequency <lb/>distributions. Maximum funding rules may need to be relaxed while minimum funding requirements may <lb/>need to be tightened. One particularly astonishing statistic is that approximately one quarter of UK <lb/>companies with defined benefit schemes were still enjoying contribution holidays at the beginning of 2003, <lb/>despite the growing funding hole. <lb/>Policymakers also need to consider the impact of other regulations that are intended to protect the <lb/>rights of beneficiaries but may make DB pension provision excessively costly for employers, especially <lb/>under the new regulatory and accounting environment. Employers in most OECD countries have an <lb/>additional disincentive to overfund their pension liabilities stemming from the plan members&apos; ownership of <lb/>any plan surplus in case of plan termination. The main exceptions are Portugal, the United Kingdom and <lb/>the United States, where employers can seek a refund, but there are hefty taxes involved (especially in the <lb/>United States). To the extent that employers bear the downside risk but do not ultimately benefit from the <lb/>upward potential it is unlikely that they will aim at high funding levels, irrespective of the presence of <lb/>maximum funding rules. Other regulations that increase the cost of pension provision for employers <lb/>include those requiring the revaluation and indexation of benefits. Such rules reduce employers&apos; incentives <lb/>to fund benefits above what is required by minimum funding rules, as they reduce the value of DB plans to <lb/>employers in managing labour turnover. <lb/>Even worse, such regulations may be diminishing companies&apos; willingness to sponsor defined benefit <lb/>plans altogether if they feel that they are faced with an asymmetric risk: funding shortfalls are the <lb/>employer&apos;s problem while funding excesses belong to the members. Key plan design decisions such as the <lb/>division of contributions between employers and employees, responsibility for underfunding and the <lb/>reaction to overfunding should ideally be left to market participants, as the parties to each pension plan <lb/>may find solutions best suited to their particular circumstances. Pension regulations should not impair <lb/>employers&apos; and employees&apos; ability to adapt the pension plan&apos;s design and operation to their specific needs <lb/>and objectives, especially where such plans are established on a voluntary basis. Instead, what pension <lb/>regulations should do is to require clarity in the plan documents over rights and responsibilities in cases of <lb/>overfunding and underfunding. Regulations should also limit benefit enhancements, contribution holidays, <lb/>and asset reversions to the plan sponsor in a way that encourages high funding levels and the build-up of <lb/>substantial buffers during favourable periods. <lb/>Reforming funding regulations <lb/>Minimum funding standards aim at ensuring that the pension plan&apos;s assets at least match and, <lb/>preferably, exceed by some margin the plan&apos;s accrued liabilities. Countries differ on the extent to which <lb/>they aim at this goal at every measurement date rather than over time. Indeed, in countries where <lb/>bankruptcy is a rare event, policymakers may be more willing to permit underfunding over long periods of <lb/>time. On the other hand, increasing competition in world markets makes market positions and profitability <lb/>increasingly unstable. A company sponsoring a defined benefit plan runs the risk of assuming liabilities <lb/>that can grow dramatically relative to its revenues. By running a pension plan in an underfunded manner, a <lb/>healthy, profitable company can expose itself to a heavy double blow to its earnings if its market position <lb/>deteriorates at the same time as its workforce ages and the drawdown of benefits intensifies. This is <lb/>precisely what happened to the steel and airline companies that went bankrupt over the last decade in the <lb/>United States. <lb/></body>

			<page>20 <lb/></page>

			<body>The presence of insolvency guarantee funds also affects the design of funding requirements. If <lb/>premiums to the guarantee fund are risk-based, taking into account the market value of liabilities if the plan <lb/>was to be terminated, funding rules could theoretically be superfluous. This seems to be the rationale <lb/>behind the elimination of the minimum funding requirement in the United Kingdom and its replacement by <lb/>risk-based premiums to the PPF. The level of protection afforded by the PPF could, if the premiums were <lb/>truly risk-based, be as high as it would be under a strict funding requirement. In practice, however, it is <lb/>very difficult to set fully risk-based premiums as they typically imply higher costs for sponsoring <lb/>employers with lower credit ratings (often smaller companies). Any departure from risk-based premiums <lb/>creates incentives for underfunding (moral hazard) that are best corrected with funding rules. <lb/>The level of minimum funding required by regulators also depends on how accrued benefits are <lb/>defined and how assets and liabilities are measured. In general, regulators use an ABO-type measure, the <lb/>main exception being Spain where a PBO-type measure is used. Most countries also assume that all <lb/>workers in the plan will qualify for full vesting of their accrued rights and exclude withdrawals from the <lb/>plan. This produces a more conservative (higher) measure of liabilities than on a plan termination liability, <lb/>all else being equal. <lb/>The valuation method must also be considered when determining the funding requirement. A fully-<lb/>funded pension plan may reveal itself underfunded on a plan termination basis and therefore insolvent if a <lb/>―slow‖ actuarial cost method is used to allocate liabilities or discount rates are above market values. In <lb/>such cases, a higher funding target may be established, although a better solution may be to reform the <lb/>valuation method. In general, the valuation method used for funding purposes should not lead to a measure <lb/>of liabilities lower than that calculated on a plan termination basis. Otherwise, the funding ratio will give a <lb/>false impression of the solvency of the plan. <lb/></body>

			<note place="footnote">The move towards market-based measures of liabilities, and in particular the use of discount rates <lb/>based on bond yields, also calls for gradualism in correcting underfunding. Otherwise, an unnecessary and <lb/>counterproductive degree of contribution volatility will be introduced. Regulatory forbearance may be <lb/>specially required at times of market distress. Good examples of this are the province of Quebec in Canada <lb/>and Ireland, where recovery periods were extended after the 2000 market downturn. <lb/>In general, countries where DB funding shortfalls are solely or largely the responsibility of the <lb/>sponsoring employer tend to allow longer recovery periods (e.g. 5 years in Canada, 7 years in Japan and <lb/>the United States, between 3 and 10 years in Ireland, depending on the pension fund). As pension benefits <lb/>are effectively backed by the sponsoring employer&apos;s capital, funding rules can be more lenient than in <lb/>countries where pension funds effectively operate independently of the sponsors, receiving contributions <lb/>from both employers and workers. <lb/>Industry-wide pension funds in countries such as Denmark and Iceland cannot fall back on the <lb/>sponsoring employer to cover funding shortfalls. Employers&apos; liabilities are limited to specified <lb/>contributions (contribution rates are fixed), which means that pension fund members collectively bear <lb/>investment and longevity risks. As a result of pension funds&apos; arms-length relationship with their sponsors, <lb/>regulators in these countries require relatively rapid recovery of funding shortfalls and also require a <lb/>―buffer‖ or solvency margin above the full funding level, as is the case for insurance undertakings. In <lb/>Denmark, for example, the market value of the euro swap curve is used to value pension fund liabilities <lb/>every six months. Pension funds must at all times have sufficient assets to cover their technical provisions <lb/>(the pension fund&apos;s liabilities) and a solvency margin which can be no less than 4 percent of technical <lb/>provisions plus 0.3 percent of a measure of the investment risk exposure. If funding levels decline below <lb/>the stipulated solvency margin, the institution must draw up a plan to restore its financial position. The <lb/>supervisor decides the maximum recovery period, depending on the size of the shortfall. When the pension <lb/>fund&apos;s capital is less than one third of the solvency margin (or less than the minimum capital requirement), <lb/></note>

			<page>21 <lb/></page>

			<note place="footnote">the recovery period is usually stated in months and does not normally exceed one year. The recovery plan <lb/>may include raising employee contributions, cutting bonus reserves and, ultimately, reductions in <lb/>minimum benefit or return guarantees (as happened in 1994 and 1999). <lb/>In the Netherlands, pension funds are in intermediate situation with respect to their independence <lb/>from the sponsors. The revaluation and indexation of benefits is the responsibility of the pension fund, <lb/>which can alter it in line with the funding level. Hence, this risk is borne collectively by plan members. On <lb/>the other hand, nominal benefits are a shared responsibility of plan sponsors and workers. This situation is <lb/>reflected in the regulatory approach. Under the FTK, as long as indexation is conditional (on the funding <lb/>ratio, normally), nominal pension commitments are measured once a year using the market value of the <lb/>Euro swap curve for discounting. The funding ratio must be at least 105% at any time and the DNB must <lb/>be informed immediately of any shortfall. A strategy must be developed within three months, and actions <lb/>must be taken within three years to enable the asset value to be brought back up to the 105% level. Pension <lb/>funds are also required to meet a solvency test; the probability of underfunding within one year cannot be <lb/>higher than 2.5 percent. Pension funds have 15 years to correct funding levels if the test is not met. Finally, <lb/>pension funds must provide evidence to the supervisor that their funding and investment strategy is <lb/>consistent with their indexation ambition, under a so-called continuity test. <lb/>IV. Implications for occupational pension provision and pension funds&apos; investment behaviour <lb/>The most immediate effect of the emergence of funding gaps in various OECD countries since 2000 <lb/>has been the need to increase contributions to occupational pension plans. In countries like the United <lb/>Kingdom or the United States where employers had been taking contribution holidays throughout most of <lb/>the 90s, the sudden jump in pension contributions has dealt a severe blow to company cash flows and in <lb/>some cases may have contributed to debt downgrades. Yet, some corporations have been able to dampen <lb/>the impact of funding requirements by borrowing in capital markets and transferring the proceeds to the <lb/>pension fund or allocating physical assets owned by the company to it. For example, in the United States <lb/>an airline can plug a funding gap by transferring a plane to the pension fund and leasing it back from the <lb/>fund. <lb/>The largest increases in contribution rate have actually taken place in Canada the Netherlands. As <lb/>shown in Figure 1, pension fund contributions in Canada went up from 0.5 percent of GDP in 2001 to 2.2 <lb/>percent in 2005. In the Netherlands, contributions went up from 2.8 percent of GDP in to 4.5 percent over <lb/>the same period. <lb/></note>

Three in particular are noteworthy. First, the move to funding in what <lb/>have been traditionally occupational pension systems dominated by book reserve systems. Second, the <lb/>increased popularity of asset-liability risk management techniques by pension funds. Third, the closure of <lb/>defined benefit plans and their substitution by a whole spectrum of new plans with different degrees of risk <lb/>sharing features. <lb/>New funding initiatives in book reserve systems <lb/>In countries like Germany that have traditionally financed significant parts of their occupational <lb/>pension liabilities through book reserves, the move towards market-based accounting standards has driven <lb/>some sponsors to separate pension assets into special purpose entities called contractual trust agreements <lb/>(CTAs). 39 These entities are not subject to any of the regulations that apply to the two main types of <lb/>German pension funds (Pensionskassen and Pensionsfonds) and other financing vehicles (e.g. direct <lb/>insurance with a life insurance undertaking). For local German accounting purposes they are treated on-<lb/>balance sheet as occupational pension plan assets. Under international accounting standards, CTAs are <lb/>treated as plan assets if it can be shown that they enable protection against the insolvency of the sponsor. <lb/>Among other factors, sponsors&apos; preference of CTAs over Pensionskassen or Pensionsfonds has been <lb/>influenced by the higher discount rates applied under the CTA-book reserve system, typically 6 percent. <lb/>The other two financing vehicles, on the other hand, are required to use a 2.75 percent discount rate. <lb/>39 The first major German company to set up a CTA in Germany was Hewlett Packard in the 1980s. By December <lb/>2006, all the 30 companies that make up the DAX stock market index all used off-balance-sheet funding <lb/>for their pension liabilities, with the CTA being the most popular vehicle. A recent survey by Towers <lb/>Perrin (2007) has estimated that nearly two-thirds (65%) of the pension liabilities at these firms were <lb/>externally funded in 2006. <lb/></body>

			<body>The growth in ALM, changes in pension fund investment, and financial stability considerations <lb/>A largely positive upshot of the move to market valuations for both funding and accounting purposes <lb/>is that pension funds will need to take a closer look at their liabilities when deciding on their investment <lb/>strategy. This is leading to a significant departure from standard practice in countries like the United <lb/>Kingdom or the United States, where the investment focus was on benchmarking performance relative to a <lb/>market index, with little regard to variations in the funding ratio. While asset-liability management (ALM) <lb/>has been used for some time, it had not played such a central role in the assessment of pension fund <lb/>investments. <lb/>In the United Kingdom, investment policies are being revised paying due regard to market valuations <lb/>of the pension fund&apos;s liabilities. Of all OECD countries, the United Kingdom used to have the highest <lb/>pension fund allocation to equities, up to 70 per cent on average. This allocation has been coming down in <lb/>recent years (to less than 60 percent by December 2005 40 ), largely as a result of the reform of accounting <lb/>standards and the introduction of the PPF. However, it is unlikely that pension funds will go as far as one <lb/>large pension fund (Boots), which in 2000 shifted to a fully fixed income-based portfolio, as it was felt that <lb/>it was the closest match to the fund&apos;s liabilities and maximised tax benefits for the sponsoring employer. 41 <lb/>Most pension fund trustees, employers and consultants consider that there is no perfect match for DB <lb/>pension liabilities (especially for active workers) and that some exposure to equities and alternative asset <lb/>classes is worth the risk involved. <lb/>A similar shift towards bonds (especially inflation-indexed) has also taken place in Canada in recent <lb/>years. In Denmark, after the new fair valuation system and risk-based supervision were introduced in 2001, <lb/>pension funds increased their exposure to bonds by up to 40 percent (and increased their duration) and <lb/>decreased their allocation to equities by approximately 70 percent. In Switzerland, where fixed discount <lb/>rates are still being used, there is also evidence of a significant effect of the nature of liabilities on pension <lb/>fund portfolios (Gerber (2005)). <lb/>Even in other countries like the Netherlands, where ALM techniques have been in use for some years, <lb/>the arrival of new funding rules and accounting standards has also caused some changes in pension fund <lb/>portfolios. While the percentage allocation to bonds by pension funds has hardly increased, there has been <lb/>a rise in the duration of the bond portfolio. (Kakes and Broeders (2006)). This has improved the matching <lb/>with the pension funds&apos; liabilities, though the current duration gap is still about ten years, according to the <lb/>central bank (DnB). <lb/>An investment strategy consistent with the pension fund&apos;s liabilities (including those aiming at <lb/>cashflow matching, so-called liability-driven investment or LDI) is in principle a desirable outcome of <lb/>market-based funding and accounting valuations. However, the potential implications for the long-term <lb/>efficiency of the asset allocation and financial stability need to be carefully considered. When accompanied <lb/>with strict funding rules, the result may be suboptimal long-term asset allocation, higher funding costs 42 , <lb/>and a decrease in financial stability. The potential disruptive effect of rapid changes in pension fund asset <lb/>allocation is exemplified by the sharp decline of yields on UK inflation-indexed bonds (gilts) between <lb/>2004 and 2006, substantially below those in the euro area. UK pension funds were largely responsible for <lb/>this phenomenon, together with the ―scarcity‖ of these bonds. 43 This evidence highlights the potential for <lb/>40 See OECD (2006) for data on pension fund asset allocation in OECD countries. <lb/>41 Recently, the Boots&apos; pension fund decided to shift back up to 15% of its portfolio to other assets. <lb/>42 See Blome et al. (2007) in this volume. <lb/>43 See the report by the Committee on the Global Financial System (2007) of the Bank for International Settlements <lb/>and Ervin and Schich (2007). <lb/></body>

			<body>procyclical behaviour among pension funds. New regulations, such as the Dutch FTK, remain to be tested <lb/>in this regard. Up to now, Dutch pension funds have tended to steer changes in their asset allocation by <lb/>altering the ratio of net purchases of different asset classes, rather than through net sales. 44 <lb/>The increasing popularity of ALM and LDI strategies also calls increasingly into question regulatory <lb/>frameworks based on portfolio limits as certain asset classes may be a best match for pension funds trying <lb/>to immunise their liabilities. While diversification within asset classes is still a relevant investment <lb/>principle, diversification applied to assets classes needs to be considered in the context of the liabilities of <lb/>long term investors like pension funds. Asset allocations should be based on liabilities, and in some cases, <lb/>a high investment in certain assets classes may be in order. <lb/>Further policy focus is also needed in the implications of ALM and LDI strategies for public debt <lb/>management. The government is the only entity capable of issuing riskless (i.e. inflation-linked) long-term <lb/>paper that employers can use to match long-term interest rate guarantees. Bonds indexed to wages or <lb/>economic growth would be even more attractive for DB pension funds, given the link of their liabilities to <lb/>real variables. In addition, policymakers need to pay more attention to the measurement and management <lb/>of mortality risk by pension funds. ALM-based investment strategies need as much a focus on <lb/>demographic risks as on investments. <lb/>The decline in DB plans <lb/>Ironically, while funding concerns in occupational DB systems are in the vanguard of the public <lb/>policy debate, their constituency is slowly (or rapidly in some cases) shrinking. Only a few countries like <lb/>Germany, the Netherlands and Japan have experienced some resistance to the decline in the number and <lb/>coverage of defined benefit plans that has affected other countries like Australia, Canada, the United <lb/>Kingdom, and the United States. Even in these countries, it is not clear how long their popularity will last. <lb/>Changes have taken place already in the Netherlands, with the shift over the last few years from final <lb/>salary to career average plans with conditional indexation, and a further shift to pooled-risk or collective <lb/>defined contribution arrangements expected. In Japan, most defined benefit plans have been transformed <lb/>into cash balance arrangements (still treated as defined benefit under both the IASB and the OECD <lb/>classifications, as the sponsoring employer bears investment risk until up to retirement). <lb/>Underlying changes in the economy, such as the shift in jobs to the service sector appear to explain <lb/>much of the decline in DB plan coverage in some countries like the United Kingdom or the United States. <lb/>The service sector in these countries has been traditionally less unionised and there was therefore weaker <lb/>pressure for DB type pension provision. However, the more recent decline in coverage over the last decade <lb/>in the United Kingdom appears to be linked to the impact of market-based accounting standards and the <lb/>increasing cost of regulations (such as the revaluation and indexation requirements). 45 In particular, the <lb/>introduction of FRS 17 seems to have been an important factor in some firm&apos;s decision to terminate DB <lb/>plans, especially highly leveraged ones (Klumpes and Whittington (2003)). <lb/>The introduction of the PPF may also affect DB provision. The portfolios shift to bonds by pension <lb/>funds in the UK since 2003 appears to be at least partly related to the decision by corporate treasurers <lb/>acting as scheme trustees to avoid hikes in the PPF levy by locking in as far as possible the funding status <lb/>of the plan through better matching of the FRS17 value of their assets and liabilities (pension funds with <lb/></body>

			<note place="footnote">44 See Kakes and Broeders (2006). <lb/>45 By April 2005, almost half of all UK DB plans active members were in a plan closed to new entrants (Government <lb/>Actuary&apos;s Department (2006)). <lb/></note>

			<page>25 <lb/></page>

			<body>funding ratios above 130 percent do not pay the levy 46 ). The PPF introduced risk-based premiums in <lb/>2006/7 47 and raised the total value of the levy in 2007/8. Some employers, especially smaller ones, may <lb/>find the additional cost of sponsoring DB plans exacting. However, if premiums are unrelated to risks, the <lb/>danger would be potentially undesirable subsidies and inefficient allocation of capital. <lb/>In the United States, tax regulations setting low ceilings on overfunding and rules over the ownership <lb/>of any funding excess (such as the tax on reversion to the sponsoring employer) may have reduced the <lb/>attractiveness of prudent funding. In addition, the presence of a guarantee fund (the PBGC) may have also <lb/>facilitated employers&apos; withdrawal from DB pension provision. This moral hazard risk is being addressed <lb/>with changes to the premium charged and new regulations that limit benefit increases by underfunded <lb/>plans. <lb/>The impact of minimum funding requirements on DB pension provision is more complex. Employers <lb/>have an interest in stable contribution rates, so a funding requirement based on an economically <lb/>meaningful funding target is likely to be consistent with their own funding objectives, while at the same <lb/>time enhancing the retirement benefit security for workers. However, complex funding rules and short <lb/>recovery periods can raise the cost of DB pension provision dramatically, especially as additional <lb/>contributions may be required during bad economic times. <lb/>The new pension landscape <lb/>As DB plans decline in importance, the question needs to be raised whether workers are better served <lb/>by the new DC arrangements being put in place. Certainly, for employees in the growing service sector and <lb/>in dynamic industries such as information technology DB arrangements may not be attractive if they <lb/>expose them to benefit losses because of the lack of portability of accrued benefits and the absence of <lb/>revaluation regulations (as is the case in the United States, for example). However, portable DB plans such <lb/>as those in place in the Netherlands (at least for workers who move within the same industry), would seem <lb/>to be superior in a welfare sense to ―pure‖ (unprotected) defined contribution plans where all risks and <lb/>costs are borne individually by workers. 48 <lb/>Ultimately, employers and policymakers need to focus on solutions that provide for efficient risk <lb/>sharing of the two main risks in retirement provision: investment and longevity. Solutions that are in <lb/>between traditional DB plan and ―pure‖ DC plans (where members bear investment and longevity risks on <lb/>an individual basis) have been around for some time. In the US, for example, employers can sponsor cash <lb/>balance plans that can offer protection against investment risk (through an interest rate guarantee) but lay <lb/>all longevity risk on the individual (since benefits are usually paid as a lump-sum). Employers in the UK <lb/>and other countries are exploring similar arrangements to replace their traditional DB arrangements. <lb/>It is also possible to design a defined benefit plan where only nominal benefits are guaranteed, while <lb/>revaluation and indexation are adjusted on the basis of the performance of the fund, as is the case in the <lb/>Netherlands. The risks of a defined benefit plan can also be shifted to the members on a collective basis by <lb/></body>

			<note place="footnote">46 Since 2006, any plan that is more than 125% funded on a Pension Protection Fund basis will not be liable to pay <lb/>the risk based element of the pension protection levy. <lb/>47 See Stewart (2007). The risk-based part of the levy makes up 80% of the total. It is based on a plan&apos;s underfunding <lb/>risk and the sponsoring company&apos;s insolvency risk. The main risk that is not considered in the levy is <lb/>investment risk. <lb/>48 Forcing portability of DB plans in countries like the United States by introducing statutory revaluation of accrued <lb/>benefits by departing employees does not appear the right solution. Such policies simply shift portability <lb/>costs to a single company, rather than sharing them among different companies, as in the Dutch industy-<lb/>wide arrangements. <lb/></note>

			<body>transforming the pension fund into a mutual insurance entity that provides guarantees similar to those of a <lb/>defined benefit plan. Such entities are wide-spread in countries like Denmark and Iceland and are also <lb/>common for public sector workers in Spain. Such plans are treated as defined contribution under <lb/>accounting standards but provide some degree of protection against market volatility and longevity risk. In <lb/>the Netherlands, some listed companies that have adopted international financial reporting standards have <lb/>also had their plans classified as defined contribution by fixing their contribution rate over long periods. <lb/>These ―protected‖ DC plans (including the mutual insurance model of Denmark and Iceland and the <lb/>―collective‖ DC plans of the Netherlands) may be superior – in a welfare sense -not just to ―unprotected‖ <lb/>DC arrangements but also to traditional and hybrid DB plans, as they offer a higher level of protection <lb/>against sponsor insolvency and greater flexibility to address investment and longevity risks. Pension funds <lb/>in these countries offer an efficient form of intergenerational risk sharing between different generations of <lb/>workers tied to the same fund through their employment contract. Such risk sharing cannot be replicated <lb/>via ―unprotected‖ DC plans, because of the general requirement to grant members choice of investment. <lb/>The shift to ―pure‖ or unprotected DC plans also raises additional challenges for policymakers. In <lb/>countries that have had a marked shift from DB to such DC plans, employer contributions to the latter tend <lb/>to be much lower. This has been widely reported in the United Kingdom, a country where private pension <lb/>plans are expected to account for a large portion of retirement income. In the United States DB plans tend <lb/>to be offered as part of the employment contract and have automatic enrolment, while employees must <lb/>specifically request membership of DC plans. DC plans also involve investment decisions that may not be <lb/>easily understood by plan members. In addition to difficult risk-return analysis, plan members must be able <lb/>to compare different fee structures. Financial education is clearly necessary to overcome some of these <lb/>deficiencies. Policymakers also need to play a role to ensure that the latest academic wisdom on retirement <lb/>saving quickly filters through to the financial industry. Employers, too, can play a key role in educating <lb/>their employees, in facilitating investment choice among a few suitable investment options, and providing <lb/>low cost default alternatives that meet as best as possible the retirement benefit security goal of workers. <lb/>The risk transfer to individual households is all the more worrying given the decreased appetite <lb/>among insurers for bearing long term risks such as those underlying pension products like annuities. In the <lb/>United Kingdom, for example, despite the requirement to buy annuities before 75, there are only two main <lb/>annuity providers. The possible move towards fair valuation of life insurance companies could lead to a <lb/>further retrenchment from these markets. The controversy over accounting of life insurance companies 49 , <lb/>which mirrors that of DB pension plans, calls at least for a closer scrutiny by policymakers of its potential <lb/>consequences for private pension provision and a reassessment of the importance of social security <lb/>systems. <lb/>V. Conclusion <lb/>The trend towards market-based valuation of pension plan liabilities is in general a welcome <lb/>development as it may offer a more realistic picture of the solvency position of DB pension funds and <lb/>improve the transparency and international comparability of company accounts. For financially weak plan <lb/>sponsors, market-based measures of the plan termination liability can help supervisors decide on <lb/>appropriate remedial action. Market valuations should also help improve the coherence between valuations <lb/>for funding and accounting purposes, particularly with respect to the choice of economic and demographic <lb/>assumptions. Differences in actuarial cost methods are likely to remain, however, as pension regulators and <lb/>accountants often take different perspectives when valuing pension liabilities. In particular, pension <lb/>regulators are increasingly concerned about the termination value of benefits (ABO), tend to make more <lb/>conservative assumptions about vesting and withdrawal rates and use lower discount rates. <lb/></body>

			<note place="footnote">49 See e.g. Fore (2003). <lb/></note>

			<page>27 <lb/></page>

			<body>Both accountants and regulators should also require that economic and demographic assumptions are <lb/>based on best estimate points, with the necessary sensitivity analysis and risk (prudent) margins built into <lb/>the valuation framework. The assumptions used for calculating pension benefits and comparing assets and <lb/>liabilities should also be tailored for each fund in order to take into account the specific economic and <lb/>demographic experience of the covered population. These best estimate assumptions should be updated in <lb/>each reporting period to reflect new information on the actual experience of the pension plan over that <lb/>period that is expected to continue into the future. <lb/>The review of valuation methods has also shown some inconsistencies in the accounting standard for <lb/>pension liabilities (IAS19), which has been implemented in most OECD countries. Business accountants <lb/>value pension liabilities for the firm as an ongoing concern, using the PBO measure which includes salary <lb/>increases up to retirement. Yet, market prices for such long-term, non-traded liabilities cannot be found. If <lb/>employers were to sell their liabilities, as has been occurring in the United Kingdom recently, they would <lb/>pay a price based on the ABO measure, which is based on accrued benefits. A move to fair value <lb/>accounting, where smoothing or amortisation of actuarial liabilities over time is no longer possible, <lb/>therefore risks misrepresenting the long-term economic cost of pensions as an ongoing concern. It can also <lb/>lead to sub-optimal asset allocation decisions and have negative implications for financial stability as <lb/>employers and pension funds overreact to short term changes in asset values and engage in procyclical <lb/>investment behaviour. <lb/>The introduction of market-based valuation also calls for a different approach to funding regulations. <lb/>A certain moderation in rectifying underfunding problems is in order. When setting maximum recovery <lb/>periods, regulators should take into account the potential disruption to long-term investment. At the same <lb/>time, regulators need to provide the necessary incentives for the build-up of buffers in good economic <lb/>times. The goal of high funding specifically calls for higher overfunding ceilings than is currently the case <lb/>in some countries. <lb/>Ultimately, however, many sponsors may prefer to move away from defined benefit plans that expose <lb/>them to significant risks without any upside potential, as ―surpluses‖ cannot normally be recovered by the <lb/>sponsoring employer, and when they can they are often subject to heavy taxes. New pension arrangements, <lb/>like cash balance and other hybrid pension plans, can encourage more meaningful risk sharing, where, in <lb/>particular, the cost of anticipated increases in life expectancy are borne by each generation of workers. The <lb/>transformation of pension funds into mutual-type entities that underwrite retirement risks may also be <lb/>attractive in some countries, as long as it can mean the reclassification of the pension plan as a defined <lb/>contribution one for business accounting purposes. In some OECD countries, however, the main type of <lb/>plan replacing defined benefit ones are ―pure‖ defined contribution ones, where members bear the full <lb/>weight of investment and longevity risk, at least until retirement. Further analysis of these plans and their <lb/>policy implications is needed to avoid their pitfalls. <lb/></body>
