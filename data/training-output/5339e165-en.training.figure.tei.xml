Some PROs (EMBRAPA, 2015) provide aggregated data, very often in the form<lb/> of a single figure of one type of impact (e.g. economic) based on the summation of quantified impacts with a<lb/> comparable unit. Such a figure is easy to communicate. The downside is that this communicability may hide<lb/> the knowledge characterising the complexity of the various pathways to impact. Other approaches (Payback<lb/> Framework and SIAMPI) develop indicators that allow cross-case comparisons. All these approaches hardly<lb/> consider a reduced number of impact pathways at the level of an organisation, and do not generate data to<lb/> highlight these impacts. Referring to the R&amp;D Value Mapping approach, Kingsley et al. (1996) underline that<lb/> the quantification of elements across cases can lead to generalisable data.</figDesc>

ARS research is organised into 17 National Programs. These programmes serve<lb/> to bring co-ordination, communication, and empowerment to approximately 750 research projects. Programme<lb/> performance against targets is monitored annually. Each National Program Team (NPT) prepares an annual<lb/> report featuring the National Program major accomplishments. At the end of each national programme&apos;s five-year cycle, an accomplishment report is prepared by the NPT, and a retrospective Review by an external<lb/> panel is carried out.<lb/> INRA<lb/> The French National Institute for Agricultural Research (INRA) employs 8 300 people (of which<lb/> 1 800 researchers and 2 500 engineers) and is organised into 13 scientific divisions. INRA&apos;s scientific priorities<lb/> are set every ten years in a strategic guidelines document (presently 2010-20). Before 2009, while science<lb/> quality was monitored and evaluated there was no system in place to evaluate societal impact.

INRA managers funded a research project to design a methodology for the Analysis of the<lb/> Socio-economic Impacts of the Public Agricultural Research (ASIRPA) that could be tested by INRA, the<lb/> project was launched in 2011. In 2013-15, after a two-year pilot phase, half of INRA&apos;s scientific divisions were<lb/> involved and tested the approach in real assessment conditions. The resulting impact assessment system was<lb/> officially institutionalised in 2015. In parallel, in 2014, INRA&apos;s economists calculated the Internal Rate of Return<lb/> of the French agricultural research, using standard economic methods described in Section 2 of this report.<lb/> CSIRO<lb/> In Australia, the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization (CSIRO) employs over<lb/> 5 000 people, and is funded by the Department of Industry, Innovation and Science. CSIRO is organised into<lb/> three Lines of Business (LoB)<lb/> 13 : 1) Impact Science; 2) National Facilities and Collections; and 3) CSIRO<lb/> Services. Within its Impact Science LoB, there are nine Business Units (BU, previously known as Flagships),<lb/> focusing on the largest issues facing the nation across key sectors: Agriculture, Health and Biosecurity,<lb/> Data 61, Food and Nutrition, Land and Water, Mineral Resources, Manufacturing, Energy, and Oceans and<lb/> Atmosphere.</figDesc>
