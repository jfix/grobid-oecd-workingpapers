            <figDesc>In many countries, less experienced teachers (those with less than five years&apos; teaching experience) are<lb/> more likely to work in challenging schools and less likely to report confidence in their teaching abilities<lb/> than more experienced teachers.<lb/> • Most countries have activities in place aimed at preparing teachers for work, such as induction and<lb/> mentoring programmes.<lb/> • Approximately 44% of teachers work in schools where principals report that all new teachers have access<lb/> to formal induction programmes; 76% work in schools with access to informal induction; and 22% work<lb/> in schools that only have programmes for teachers new to teaching.<lb/> • Fewer teachers report participation in induction and mentoring programmes than principals report<lb/> the existence of such programmes.</figDesc>
