			<body>This report presents the findings of a review of current strategies and practices in <lb/>entrepreneurship support provision at the University of Applied Sciences Schmalkalden. The report <lb/>also presents a selection of international learning models with the aim of providing inspiration for new <lb/>approaches at the University of Applied Sciences Schmalkalden. <lb/>The following questions have been investigated: <lb/> What are current strategies and practices in university entrepreneurship support? <lb/> How accessible is entrepreneurship support for students and graduates? <lb/> How well is the university entrepreneurship support integrated into the wider local <lb/>entrepreneurship support system? <lb/>The report presents achievements and challenges in light of the above questions and advances <lb/>recommendations for future action. The assessment framework employed for the review is presented <lb/>in the Annex of this report. <lb/>The report is based on a background report prepared by region+projekt, interviews held during a <lb/>study visit to the University of Applied Sciences Schmalkalden on 29-30 June 2011, and comparisons <lb/>with international experiences and good practices in university entrepreneurship support. The <lb/>University of Applied Sciences Schmalkalden is one of six case-study higher education institutions <lb/>that are reviewed as part of an on-going joint project between the LEED Programme of the OECD and <lb/>the German Federal Ministry of Interior.

			<body>STUDY ISSUES AND FINDINGS <lb/>Rationale for university entrepreneurship support <lb/> &quot; We pour considerable amounts of money into our educational systems, but we haven &quot; t been <lb/>able to create schools and institutions of higher education that develop people &quot; s innate <lb/>capacity to sense and shape their future, which I view as the single most important capability <lb/>for this century &quot; s knowledge and co-creation economy &quot; . (Scharmer, 2007, p. 3) 1 <lb/>Many different inputs are required for successful entrepreneurship, one of the most important being <lb/>entrepreneurship skills. Motivated people need the right skills to identify entrepreneurial opportunities <lb/>and to turn their entrepreneurial projects into successful ventures. Successful entrepreneurs follow a <lb/>learning journey, which starts in education and continues through continuation are learning-by-doing <lb/>processes and both formal and informal learning inside and outside the firm. <lb/>Higher education institutions provide unique environments for nascent entrepreneurship. Tailored <lb/>practices have emerged in educating future entrepreneurs and in helping them to take their first steps <lb/>in starting-up and growing a business (OECD 2010) 2 . To best support entrepreneurship, universities <lb/>themselves need to be entrepreneurial. Promoting entrepreneurship is very likely to have an impact on <lb/>what most universities today perceive as their &quot; first &quot; , &quot; second &quot; and &quot; third &quot; missions, and what the best <lb/>linkages are between education, research, and promoting social and economic development in terms of <lb/>internal governance, positioning in local, national and global levels and strategic partnerships. <lb/>University entrepreneurship support 3 , considered on its own, has its limits. It prepares students for <lb/>future entrepreneurial careers and promotes the commercialisation of research results. However, <lb/>success depends upon the close co-operation and integration of the university internal support with the <lb/>external entrepreneurship support system. <lb/>Assisting the establishment of new firms is a key objective of university entrepreneurship support, but <lb/>not its only one. The co-existence of tangible outputs (e.g., number of assisted new ventures) and <lb/>intangible outcomes, such as the spread of entrepreneurial culture and the creation of entrepreneurial <lb/>mindsets, renders assessing the impact of university entrepreneurship support a challenge that requires <lb/>tailored approaches and systematic, long-term evaluation efforts. <lb/>Entrepreneurship education can play at least three legitimate roles in the development of an <lb/>entrepreneurial society. First, it can present students with entrepreneurship as a possible career choice <lb/>in addition to acting as a general advocate for the mindset and type of creativity employed in <lb/>entrepreneurial endeavours. Second, it can assist students in developing the technical and business <lb/>skill-set necessary to have a successful entrepreneurial career. Third, professional educators can <lb/>assume the responsibility of advancing the body of knowledge associated with the entrepreneurial <lb/>1 <lb/>Scharmer, C.O. (2007): &quot; Theory U. Leading from the Future as it Emerges &quot; , The Society for <lb/>Organizational Learning. <lb/>2 <lb/>OECD (2010), &quot; Universities, Innovation and Entrepreneurship: Criteria and Examples of Good <lb/>Practice &quot; , OECD Publishing. http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/5km7rq0pq00q-en <lb/>3 <lb/>In this report, the term &quot; university &quot; is used for both universities and universities of applied sciences. <lb/></body>

			<body>phenomenon. Their findings should not only be disseminated to students but also to policy-makers and <lb/>the public at large (Redford, 2006). 4 <lb/>When launching a new venture, the entrepreneur can either have a (somewhat) precise venture idea, <lb/>or, instead, a set of competences, skills, resources, and contacts to dwell on. Moving from an either-or <lb/>situation to a greater coincidence of ideas and competences is what entrepreneurship education <lb/>programmes aim to achieve. <lb/>Education and training contribute to the development of the entrepreneur &quot; s knowledge of what <lb/>Sarasvathy (2001) calls the &quot; three categories of means &quot; . Ideally, entrepreneurs, firstly, know who they <lb/>are, what they know, and whom they know. They are, secondly, aware of their own traits, tastes, and <lb/>abilities, and thirdly they have realised the knowledge corridors they are in and the social networks <lb/>they are a part of. For Sarasvathy the entrepreneur that possesses all three knowledge-means is an <lb/>effectuation entrepreneur. 5 She or he is less likely to use traditional types of market research (such as <lb/>carefully designed surveys), but reverts to &quot; seat-of-the-pants marketing &quot; and selling alliances. Instead <lb/>of on long-term planning and net-present-value analyses, preference is on short term planning, and <lb/>hierarchical structures based on power-related procedures are replaced by strong participatory cultures <lb/>nurturing the entrepreneur &quot; s relational capital. Finally, despite the greater likelihood of failure, <lb/>effectuation entrepreneurs are more likely to effectively manage failures, to re-start, and to create more <lb/>successful firms in the long run. Hence, the idea is to take advantage of three core elements rooted in <lb/>the individual rather than the product or the market: <lb/> Who I am? <lb/> What I know? <lb/> Who I know? <lb/>There is an increasing awareness amongst universities and local entrepreneurship support providers to <lb/>put more emphasis on action plans rather than business plans. The importance of drive and energy <lb/>based on proactive conduct is more valued than academic and written intentions. What you do rather <lb/>than what you would like to do is a big difference. Although market analysis and other relevant tasks <lb/>and preparations surely could be proved valid and very important, the emphasis should be on the <lb/>constant drive and development of the venture. Entrepreneurs are often not in it for the writing of long <lb/>reports – they want development and results. Thus the looking at the start-up as an organic, ever-<lb/>changing entity should be supported. The following quote illustrates this: <lb/> &quot; The major difficulty that may arise when functional inputs are dominant – as they seem to <lb/>be in many programmes – is that they may deny the capacity for development of the kind of <lb/>holistic management that is central to the entrepreneur. Entrepreneurial managers are <lb/>managers of the &quot; total &quot; business and thus able constantly to &quot; feel &quot; it. Entrepreneurs seek <lb/>knowledge on a &quot; need to know &quot; , &quot; know how &quot; and &quot; know who &quot; basis and, in the experience of <lb/>the author working with many groups of entrepreneurs, will enthusiastically embrace new <lb/>knowledge when it brings forward future recognisable contextual experience to them and <lb/>4 <lb/>Redford, D. T. (2006). Entrepreneurship Education in Portugal: 2004/2005 National survey. <lb/>Comportamento Organizacional e Gestão, Special Issue: &quot; New Challenges in Entrepreneurship &quot; , <lb/>12(1), 19 -41. <lb/>5 <lb/>The website www.effectuation.org provides concrete ideas, article and papers, best practices as well <lb/>as relevant perspectives for different stakeholders such as researchers, entrepreneurs, and investors. <lb/></body>

			<body>helps them to conceptualise and give broader meaning to their existing problems and <lb/>opportunities. &quot; (Gibb, 2005) 6 <lb/>Often business plans are invalid after just a short amount of time and/or actions. Instead a systematic, <lb/>holistic &quot; are-we-on-the-right-track &quot; description is needed. Investors and other resources wanted for <lb/>developing the venture are often much more interested in progress than prophecies. This way of <lb/>looking at start-ups therefore also needs to be communicated to those involved in financing, mainly <lb/>banks. In contrasts to banks, (private) business angels and early seed venture capitalists are advocating <lb/>this as they see their investment in a more reliable view than based on presumptions. A belief in the <lb/>team and the ability to follow the day-to-day actions and developments of the business gives better <lb/>reassurance for the investment. <lb/>The emphasis in university entrepreneurship support, to date, has mainly been on entrepreneurship <lb/>education, but the concept of the university as main reference point in the entrepreneurial process <lb/>chain awareness creation→competence building→action is gaining more and more ground. Students <lb/>participating in entrepreneurship education are encouraged to undertake entrepreneurial activities <lb/>whilst they are studying. Entrepreneurship education can not stand alone if universities want to create <lb/>the right environment for nascent entrepreneurs and dedicated spaces, such as &quot; hatcheries &quot; or <lb/>incubators. This implies, however, close interaction and co-operation between higher education <lb/>institutions and private and public support structures outside university. Successful local <lb/>entrepreneurship support systems rely on easy access, through clear referral, and tailored support. <lb/>Facilitating the access to financing, premises and networks and enhancing teambuilding, mentoring <lb/>and access to research results are key pillars of start-up support provided by universities. This requires, <lb/>alumni have to be engaged as mentors and secure access to established companies. Local businesses <lb/>have to co-operate more with universities in regards of guest lecturing, project work, access to real-life <lb/>cases, interaction with student start-ups, developing of new solutions for existing challenges etc. <lb/>Banks, business angels and VCs should frequently be present at campus and close contacts to other <lb/>higher education institutions should be facilitated with regard to creating platforms for teambuilding <lb/>and networks are essential. <lb/>Finally, entrepreneurship is a concept that can benefit not only those that wish to create new <lb/>organisations but also those that wish to work in existing organisations. Organisational renewal that <lb/>incorporates innovation, venturing and risk-taking relates to the concept of intrapreneurship. The <lb/>pursuit of intrapreneurship in established organisations arises from the need to avoid stagnation and <lb/>decline by helping companies deal with change, develop innovation, and improve their adaptive <lb/>capacity in servicing the marketplace. Developing mindsets and skill sets of intrapreneurship with <lb/>students can broaden their focus to incorporate leadership, innovation, changing the culture of <lb/>organisations and furthering customer relationship development. <lb/>Key achievements <lb/>A strong brand in the region. The university is seen as an important stakeholder in collaboration with <lb/>the local and regional business life and industry. The skills, knowledge, and research present and <lb/>developed at the university are foundations for the continuing growth in the region. The fact that many <lb/>students are being offered job even before graduation is a sign of strong technical skills and desired <lb/>knowledge. This can be used as a lever for more enterprising behaviour related to both <lb/>entrepreneurship and intrapreneurship. <lb/></body>

			<body>Dedicated and locally anchored students. The size of FH Schmalkalden, the size of the city itself, and <lb/>the – after all – rather limited possibilities to travel easily to other cities should make it possible for <lb/>students to engage with the local community in an entrepreneurial manner. The students often stay on <lb/>campus, which gives room for a rich campus life and prepares the ground for promoting activities to <lb/>promote entrepreneurial intentions amongst students. The local anchoring of FH Schmalkalden also <lb/>makes way for exploring and exploiting new entrepreneurial opportunities to the benefit of the region, <lb/>for instance within tourism and the experience economy. <lb/>Size matters. Even though size sometimes is an important factor in terms of the critical mass notion, <lb/>the size of FH Schmalkalden offers possibilities to create a local initiative that is able to move faster <lb/>and more progressively than bigger institutions. It calls for cross-disciplinary action that also is deeply <lb/>rooted in the university &quot; s tradition of working with practical problems together with the business life <lb/>and industry. <lb/>A sublime concentration of support initiatives. Efforts to promote entrepreneurship Schmalkalden are <lb/>immense, and FH Schmalkalden is in an obvious position to take good advantage of this. Start-up <lb/>support is prioritised on many levels (locally, regionally, and nationally) and can be accessed easily <lb/>through a wide range of services and organisations providing them. <lb/>Key challenges <lb/>The awareness of entrepreneurship. Promoting entrepreneurial intentions amongst students and <lb/>developing competences for entrepreneurship is not a priority for FH Schmalkalden &quot; s top-<lb/>management. Graduate entrepreneurship is understood as a minor employment opportunity compared <lb/>to dependent employment. Hence, the strategic understanding of entrepreneurship as profession <lb/>dominated by a low proactive demand from student side which, in turn, does not request strategic <lb/>interventions by the top-management. A lack of new (graduate) start-ups will in the long run not <lb/>provide the region with enough new businesses needed to stimulate modernisation and innovation in <lb/>the local business base. Business succession was not mentioned as an issue for the region, but this <lb/>might change in the near future. <lb/>High-tech start-ups as the only solution? The range of areas in which graduate start-ups can emerge <lb/>and which forms this can take should be reconsidered. Even though FH Schmalkalden is a university <lb/>of applied sciences, the range of faculties and teaching subjects opens possibilities to think more cross-<lb/>disciplinary and to establish a novel perspective of entrepreneurial opportunities in the region. <lb/>Lower position of entrepreneurship education than in the past. At FH Schmalkalden it appears that <lb/>entrepreneurship education had previously been more of a priority than it is currently. There exists a <lb/>relatively limited offering of courses for students related to entrepreneurship and few connections <lb/>between the faculties. There is clearly entrepreneurship competencies within the faculty membership <lb/>that can be further strengthened through creating more strategic emphasis on entrepreneurship <lb/>education. Previously courses at FH Schmalkalden had a more interdisciplinary character and students <lb/>from different faculties could participate in lectures and seminars that were not in their respective <lb/>Faculties. At present, FH does not offer a general or interdisciplinary entrepreneurship education <lb/>programme. Non-business students who take courses in entrepreneurship may require educators to <lb/>emphasize different skill-sets than the courses more commonly developed for business majors. <lb/>Through the interviews it was clear that the faculty at FH Schmalkalden understands this and are in the <lb/>process of adjusting their programs accordingly. <lb/>Teambuilding. Cross-and interdisciplinary teambuilding is not yet facilitated. Even though FH <lb/>Schmalkalden is seen as a technical university, the range of academic fields is varied and the faculties <lb/></body>

			<page>10 <lb/></page>

			<body>should be co-operating in securing an approach to entrepreneurship building on all the university &quot; s <lb/>disciplines. Cross-disciplinary courses and activities has previously been a part of the curricula, but are <lb/>not offered at the moment. A re-thinking of the blending of students at courses and at entrepreneurial <lb/>events at the university is needed. <lb/>No institutional structure that can influence how entrepreneurship support is organised at FH <lb/>Schmalkalden. Currently, there is one person in the Rectory working at 50% of Full-Time Equivalent <lb/>on entrepreneurship, but there is no institutional structure, where, for example, interdisciplinary <lb/>initiatives in entrepreneurship education are housed. As of yet there is no consolidated strategic plan in <lb/>regard to entrepreneurship education or start-up support. There have been several initiatives but little <lb/>integration between the faculty members and courses that do exist. Furthermore the university is <lb/>missing an infrastructure that would promote co-operation within the organisation and with external <lb/>stakeholders in entrepreneurship support. <lb/>Who is who in the zoo? Even though the region is blessed with a vast range of services and support <lb/>initiatives covering many aspects of start-up support, the comprehensive view of the offering seem to <lb/>be missing. The initiatives and institutions offering support do not co-operate sufficiently, and the <lb/>offerings are not exposed clearly enough at the university. There exists some integration with the local <lb/>network of incubators, regional and city government. <lb/>No physical space for entrepreneurship on campus. Premises for students to work on projects and <lb/>start-ups are also at the moment not sufficiently present. Physical premises and facilities for <lb/>entrepreneurial activities and the visibility of the efforts at FH Schmalkalden are strongly needed. <lb/>Even though the existing actions are still to be further developed, an initial visualization of the efforts <lb/>can cause further attention and interest among the students. The access to knowledge and information <lb/>(resources, i.e. dedicated people and professors) is missing. <lb/>Low student engagement. There is no entrepreneurship club for students, nor is there a plan to create <lb/>one. The development of furthering ties between external actors and the University could be beneficial <lb/>in helping graduate entrepreneurs find funding and opportunities in the region. Student engagement in <lb/>entrepreneurship is relatively low for the overall student population. Clear incentives and reward <lb/>structures for those professors and staff members that are involved in entrepreneurship education <lb/>would be helpful in re-launching entrepreneurship as an area of strategic importance. <lb/>Financing. The access to finance seems to be one area that the region puts a great deal of attention to <lb/>and has many good initiatives for, but the overall picture of where to get access, what it takes, how <lb/>much can one apply for, what are the long-term conditions etc. is missing. This area also has to be <lb/>better coordinated to the benefit of the start-ups. The start-up grants provided by local government are <lb/>an excellent initiative, yet not enough known to student and graduate entrepreneurs. <lb/>Mentoring. A network of voluntary mentors is missing. The access to mentors with experience from <lb/>real-life ventures and companies is needed on a regularly basis for impartial and moral support of <lb/>individuals and teams involved in start-ups. The use of professors and formal initiatives can be very <lb/>helpful and rewarding, but as regarding the professors their experience of running real-life businesses <lb/>is often limited and additionally the existence of the educator/student-relationship can provide <lb/>complications regarding academic standards wanted by the university (the professor) and the start-up <lb/>ambitions sought by the student(s). <lb/></body>

			<page>11 <lb/></page>

			<body>Recommendations <lb/>Prioritising entrepreneurship in internal and external communications. A crucial way to enhance and <lb/>develop the area within entrepreneurship is to make it visible. Internal as well as external <lb/>communication has to be prioritised by the university. As an integrated part of the university &quot; s general <lb/>work, access to the area must be available on the website. Here the main focus could be on the <lb/>university &quot; s already existing efforts, i.e. what courses are offered, whom to contact in case of interest <lb/>in the area (the university contact person), links and information about the start-up support initiatives <lb/>and so on. This should be an integrated part of the university &quot; s communication in line with the <lb/>information regarding the educations, research and other of the &quot; normal &quot; information present at the <lb/>website. From here the efforts can develop into other areas and platforms, e.g. student networks, <lb/>educator networks, entrepreneurship events at campus etc. The official website &quot; s information is the <lb/>responsibility of the university – the underlying layers and links are to be developed more autonomous <lb/>and organically. Most important is that the one-door-entry is very observable on the front-page of the <lb/>website. Another simple way of creating awareness and pass on information about entrepreneurship is <lb/>to scan the &quot; market &quot; for events, activities, seminars, workshops or the like and gather them centrally at <lb/>the university &quot; s (or sub-page &quot; s) website. Often students are only exposed to creativity camps, relevant <lb/>workshops etc. by &quot; accident &quot; (word of mouth). An enhanced effort to try to map and publish all <lb/>relevant activities taking place and being offered by the whole start-up support community <lb/>(universities, public, private) is a way to draw attention to the manifold possibilities there in fact are <lb/>present to sustain the development of ventures. This also gives a more diverse picture of what is really <lb/>happening in the region and thus engage students from backgrounds other than from business or <lb/>technical studies. Teambuilding should be used as a way to develop knowledge and concrete projects. <lb/>Promoting entrepreneurial opportunity recognition. Looking at FH Schmalkalden &quot; technical and <lb/>scientific strengths, there seems to be many good possibilities as to enter into low and high tech start-<lb/>ups for the graduates. But even though the tradition should build on this, there could be more options <lb/>to pursue regarding more cross-disciplinary start-ups and business opportunities. The cross-<lb/>fertilisation of subjects, courses, students, faculty, and external support initiatives could open up new <lb/>insights for development. The city and the district would probably be more than willing to engage into <lb/>a 360° study of Schmalkalden and the region as to look into what possibilities the region could benefit <lb/>from regarding the focus of new start-ups. For instance a more detailed survey on the possibilities to <lb/>enhance the tourism and experience economy-efforts to attract not only more inhabitants, tourist, and <lb/>students, but also getting the faculty and graduates to choose Schmalkalden as their base and not <lb/>commuting to Erfurt or other cities and to stay in Schmalkalden after graduation. Future enterprises <lb/>and ventures are more likely to consist of multi-diverse teams that combine many subjects and <lb/>backgrounds and therefore not provide an existing market with a product, but also provide and develop <lb/>whole new markets that are able to take in radically innovative products and services. <lb/>Expanding entrepreneurship education activities towards all students at FH Schmalkalden. All <lb/>students at FH Schmalkalden should ideally have access to a wide range of entrepreneurial learning <lb/>opportunities. Making students aware of entrepreneurial opportunities in their close environment may <lb/>help in them in the city and region. To secure a cross-disciplinary approach to entrepreneurship the <lb/>university needs to develop more cross-faculty initiatives. Successful start-ups are often based in <lb/>complementary competencies, skills, and knowledge among the participants. To develop a business, <lb/>define a product/service, and entering the market calls for diverse perspectives and cultural <lb/>differences. This can be achieved in multiple ways. Cross-disciplinary courses and electives is one <lb/>obvious way to get this started and to encourage and stimulate the blending of the students. <lb/>Furthermore the renewed status of FH Schmalkalden as an entrepreneurial university needs to be <lb/>embedded at all faculties at the university. Extra-curricular activities and events taking place at FH <lb/>Schmalkalden have to be open and relevant for all students regarding their academic fields or other <lb/></body>

			<page>12 <lb/></page>

			<body>preferences. This is not to say that all such activities at all time should be aimed to attract all kinds of <lb/>students. The range of the university &quot; s offers could profitably incorporate the local and regional <lb/>support organizations as co-arrangers. This would further strengthen FH Schmalkalden as the local <lb/>platform within entrepreneurship and enhance the cooperation with authorities and support <lb/>organizations. <lb/>Mapping the existing local and regional initiatives. A thorough mapping of the initiatives and efforts <lb/>regarding start-up support in the region can be a lever of the awareness towards innovation and <lb/>entrepreneurship at the university. Such a task should be carried out by students in close collaboration <lb/>with the university and the surrounding society. Besides the advantage of using such a study to create <lb/>awareness at campus, the mapping should also provide the different stakeholders with concrete <lb/>knowledge and recommendations of how to secure a more coherent system that allows all stakeholders <lb/>to revise and explore new possibilities for action and co-operation as well as strategic partnerships. <lb/>Even though many of the initiatives are not entirely aimed at graduate start-ups, but at start-ups in <lb/>general, the awareness among graduates, university, and the involved organisations and/or initiatives <lb/>could offer new insights of how to support and assist in the establishing of an entrepreneurial <lb/>university. <lb/>Showcasing and celebrating successes. One way of creating awareness and stimulate the knowledge <lb/>about entrepreneurship is to show the successes form within the region. Activities such as &quot; Career <lb/>Days &quot; where (local) companies visit the university to tell about their company (and eventually recruit <lb/>future employees) are common at many universities world-wide, but a way to stimulate <lb/>entrepreneurship is to create &quot; Start-up Days &quot; where local and graduate start-ups tell their story and by <lb/>that stimulate enterprising behaviour as well as creating networks and connections between possible <lb/>future partnerships and/or co-operation. This could be arranged in a co-operation between the local <lb/>authorities and organisations, the university, and graduates/alumni. It is important though that the <lb/>venue is FH Schmalkalden. The familiarity with the venue and the faculty present will support the <lb/>credibility and integrity of the event. The visibility of such initiatives for the students (and faculty in <lb/>that matter) is extremely important when an entrepreneurial culture is to be established. Another way <lb/>is to invite start-ups and alumni on a more individual basis as part of courses and classes to act as role <lb/>models for the students. This should be done as part of the curriculum where the interaction with and <lb/>practical approach to business and industry make sense. The close collaboration in which the students <lb/>interact with companies (private or public) is an excellent way of gaining insights in what &quot; s needed to <lb/>create and develop a venture. Many of the skills needed for launching a start-up are the same needed to <lb/>act as an enterprising employee in an existing organisation, so the fundamental knowledge of how to <lb/>take risks, generate ideas, act upon possibilities as well as securing resources for your scheme are <lb/>identical. By this the focus on value creation and the individual &quot; s ability to go forward with his/her <lb/>idea are not only limited to start-up skills, but also as a creator of value in other (job) situations. <lb/>Establishing more links with the wider graduate entrepreneurship support network in Thurignia. FH <lb/>Schmalkalden could make better use of the Thuringian networks that support entrepreneurship. <lb/>Students and researchers could use some of the business start-up services at the Friedrich Schiller <lb/>University in Jena, the business start-up initiative &quot; Neudeli &quot; at Bauhaus University in Weimar and the <lb/> &quot; Auftakt &quot; initiative at Technology University Ilmenau. <lb/>Engaging alumni as mentors. To secure a balanced and more unrestrained line of advice for graduate <lb/>start-ups, a more voluntary basis of consultancy and mentoring can be initiated by use of FH <lb/>Schmalkalden alumni. The will and urge to &quot; give back &quot; to university (and society) from experienced <lb/>business people (but also from the public sector) is a way to create relations and secure knowledge <lb/>sharing that is not biased by any organization &quot; s or governmental point of view. The existing Alumni-<lb/></body>

			<page>13 <lb/></page>

			<body>Portal initiative at FH Schmalkalden should therefore also include information about the <lb/>entrepreneurship support offer. <lb/>Increasing the involvement of entrepreneurs in the education offer. FH Schmalkalden would greatly <lb/>benefit by further integration of stakeholders, such as alumni founders, entrepreneurship support <lb/>organisations as well as funders such as business angels, venture capitalists and administrators of <lb/>government-sponsored programs. Although there is already some involvement of individuals from <lb/>these organizations, an effort to strengthen further ties could be made. Alumni could act as guest <lb/>teachers from time to time, present real-life experience and know-how at events, and most importantly <lb/>act as non-partial mentors and as providers of one of the crucial aspects within entrepreneurship <lb/>support namely the &quot; know-who &quot; -facet. Often the most valuable support and advice to receive as an <lb/>entrepreneur is the knowledge of whom to go to next in regards of gaining further resources for the <lb/>development of the business. <lb/></body>

			<body>INTERNATIONAL LEARNING MODELS <lb/>In the following three learning models are presented. These are policy initiatives or university-based <lb/>actions that seek to promote action-oriented approaches in entrepreneurship support. The emphasis of <lb/>these initiatives is on the development of a university-based support infrastructure which reflects the <lb/>current set-up and capacities and enhances their continuous improvement. Such an infrastructure also <lb/>allows for a fruitful partnership between university internal and external entrepreneurship support <lb/>organisations and actors. <lb/>The table below gives the reader a quick overview of which of the learning models provides <lb/>inspiration for action and practical hints in light of the above presented recommendations. <lb/>Prioritising entrepreneurship in internal and <lb/>external communications. <lb/> The StartupWheel <lb/>Promoting <lb/>entrepreneurial <lb/>opportunity <lb/>recognition. <lb/> New cross-disciplinary education at <lb/>Aalborg University <lb/>Expanding entrepreneurship education activities <lb/>towards all students at FH Schmalkalden. <lb/> New cross-disciplinary education at <lb/>Aalborg University <lb/>Mapping the existing local and regional <lb/>initiatives. <lb/> The StartupWheel <lb/> The &quot; One-door-in &quot; -approach – <lb/>Copenhagen School of Entrepreneurship <lb/>Showcasing and celebrating successes. <lb/> The StartupWheel <lb/>Establishing more links with the wider graduate <lb/>entrepreneurship support network in Thurignia. <lb/> The StartupWheel <lb/> The &quot; One-door-in &quot; -approach – <lb/>Copenhagen School of Entrepreneurship <lb/>Engaging alumni as mentors. <lb/> The &quot; One-door-in &quot; -approach – <lb/>Copenhagen School of Entrepreneurship <lb/> The StartupWheel <lb/>Increasing the involvement of entrepreneurs in <lb/>the education offer. <lb/> The StartupWheel <lb/> The &quot; One-door-in &quot; -approach – <lb/>Copenhagen School of Entrepreneurship <lb/></body>

			<body>Box 1. The StartupWheel <lb/>A Danish developed tool to organise and cultivate the progress of the start-up is the so-called StartupWheel <lb/>(http://www.startupcompany.com/). <lb/>The inventor David Madié has started more then 25+ successful businesses and has never written a <lb/>business plan, and has had long experience of working with universities and graduate start-ups. As stated above <lb/>the rationale for business plans are often that of control and security for investors rather than to be used to <lb/>support the development of the venture. That is the justification of the development of this tool; a tool for decision-<lb/>making in start-up and growth companies that helps entrepreneurs and advisors get focus, set agenda, and take <lb/>the next step. <lb/>The StartupWheel is being used as a platform for dialogue with start-ups as well as a concrete tool for the <lb/>single start-up. It provides the start-up, investors as well as start-up support organisations with thorough insight <lb/>and ability to change directions when needed. The constant changing environment for start-ups demands for the <lb/>ability to rapidly change plans and/or already made actions. The focus is therefore made on four categories for <lb/>the start-up, namely Business Concepts, Customer Relations, Organisation, and Operations. Subcategories <lb/>define details and actions needed to be taken, so that the whole organisations and its stakeholders are aligned in <lb/>the development. Relevant resources and stakeholders involved do by this tool have an excellent indication of the <lb/>development of the venture. Working with the tool needs certification and at the moment business advisors and <lb/>educators in many different organisations from incubators to government agencies and universities are certified. <lb/>They all customise the StartupWheel to their specific needs and the types of entrepreneurs they are working with. <lb/>Today more than 50 of these kinds of organisations use the tool, including The Danish Enterprise and <lb/>Construction Authority and universities all over the world. <lb/></body>

			<note place="footnote">One of the main advantages is the ability to use it as a one-to-one dialogue session tool between <lb/>entrepreneur and the consultant/certified person, but also as an instrument for the &quot; homework &quot; (development) of <lb/>the start-up and for networking. Thus the incentive and possibility to move forward is present and obvious for the <lb/>entrepreneur (and the team behind it) and saves time, money and secures focus only on relevant stuff. The use of <lb/>the StartupWheel at universities provides the institutions with a tool that has credibility due to the many users <lb/>worldwide. Of course other tools and initiatives are known worldwide as to put the emphasis on &quot; action &quot; rather <lb/>than a traditional business plan that often is a descriptive exercise, and many of these tools are also good <lb/>instruments, but the extension worldwide of this particular tool shows the viability and credibility as a significant <lb/>lever for start-ups. <lb/>For more information, see http://www.startupcompany.com/. Free webinars are frequently offered for insight <lb/>and as introduction to the product. <lb/></note>

			<body>Box 2. The &quot; One-door-in &quot; -approach – Copenhagen School of Entrepreneurship (CSE) <lb/>An initiative that started as a bottom-up project is the Copenhagen School of Entrepreneurship <lb/>(http://cse.cbs.dk/) at Copenhagen Business School in Copenhagen, Denmark. As a student interested in <lb/>entrepreneurship (in this case entrepreneurship means all aspects, including intrapreneurship, social <lb/>entrepreneurship, creativity etc.), this is where you go and get concrete knowledge, help, and inspiration. <lb/>The initiative existing of originally six different entrepreneurship-oriented organisations gained and achieved <lb/>in dialogue with university management access to physical premises at the university from where the idea could <lb/>develop. The rationale was to create a visible and tangible environment for building the university &quot; s platform for <lb/>entrepreneurship including incubator, event, educations, and research.Each organisation kept on focusing on <lb/>their own speciality (e.g. dealing with business plan competitions, the development of network among educators, <lb/>the development of entrepreneurship education, getting students interested in entrepreneurship and the like), but <lb/>by working together and communicate the overall purpose of the unified effort rather than sub optimise the work, <lb/>a coherent effort was made as to change the mindset and attitudes among all the stakeholders at the university. <lb/>The organisations brought into the work their own resources and objectives, so the extra resources provided from <lb/>the university was not substantial, but the moral support from management meant that a long term basis for <lb/>development was secured. In the beginning, the main target groups were the students at the university, but over <lb/>the last couple of years the initiative is now targeting faculty and business too. <lb/>Today CSE is the melting pot and meeting point of most entrepreneurship interested students in the Greater <lb/>Copenhagen area as it is at the time the only university offering an almost full range of services regarding <lb/>graduate start-up. Events, seminars, teambuilding, access to mentors, law experts, office space etc. are included <lb/>in the offering. One of the aspects of the success has been the visibility of the activities, a focused communication <lb/>strategy, and the access to a critical mass of students. In the beginning it was merely students from Copenhagen <lb/>Business School attending (and quite interesting a great amount of international students – they are a very <lb/>interesting resource in getting awareness created at campus), but over time the rumor and greater awareness of <lb/>activities attracted students from other universities. This cross-fertilisation meant even better possibilities for <lb/>different backgrounds to team up in venture creations, and consequently a positive spiral effect took place. From <lb/>being a bottom-up initiative, the awareness eventually got to educators, researchers, and management and has <lb/>now lead to two more highly esteemed and heavily financially supported joint ventures in the region between <lb/>three universities, one being Next Generation (http://www.nxtgen.dk/en/), that also includes the educator and <lb/>research element as well as an enhanced interaction with businesses, society, and start-up support organisations. <lb/>The challenge was from the beginning getting faculty to engage in the initiative, as entrepreneurship was <lb/>(and still is in certain ways) regarded as an &quot; add-on &quot; to education and research rather than an (possibly) <lb/>integrated part of education. In that respect it has been a bottom up-initiative supported by (in the beginning) few <lb/>engaged professors and educators, but as the initiative showed progress and successes, got the management &quot; s <lb/>attention and the &quot; winds of change &quot; regarding entrepreneurship at university level became talk of the town over <lb/>the last couple of years, the formalisation and development of innovation and entrepreneurship support is now <lb/>well integrated at Copenhagen Business School in close co-operation with others of the biggest universities in the <lb/>Greater Copenhagen area. <lb/>This exercise can probably be possible elsewhere as well, also at TU Ilmenau and FHS. The keywords are <lb/>access to physical premises, engaged student organisation(s), support from top management and close <lb/>interaction with the external support structures in the local area. <lb/>For more information, see http://cse.cbs.dk/. <lb/></body>

			<body>Box 3. Creation of new cross-disciplinary educations as platforms for new ventures <lb/>At Aalborg University in Denmark the tradition of creating new cross-and inter-disciplinary educations is one <lb/>of the backbones of the university. The pedagogical and didactical principles of Aalborg University are the <lb/>problem based and the project based way of learning, called &quot; PBL – The Aalborg model &quot; . <lb/>The combination of new insights aimed at the ever changing world and the cooperation between faculties <lb/>opens the door for new blending of technical skills. Examples of this are the educations Medialogy that combines <lb/>technology and new media platforms and Technoanthropology that combines technology and the insight in <lb/>human behaviour. These combinations are developed to create understanding and implementation of new <lb/>knowledge and markets in the global society (www.aau.dk). <lb/>Aalborg University &quot; s tradition of having close collaboration and contact with business life and society when it <lb/>comes to education and research is one of the reasons and rationales for a proactive and somewhat foresighted <lb/>approach towards education as to secure high employability among its students. The dialogue and contact with <lb/>the surrounding society makes way for the creation and implementation (and accreditation) of relevant and up-to-<lb/>date educations that deliver candidates that are ready for the inter-disciplinary tasks and environment in today &quot; s <lb/>businesses and organisations. Aalborg University strives to create cross-disciplinary education and research thus <lb/>having the faculties working cross disciplines and traditional subject areas. Still maintaining the need and <lb/>education for specialisation, the students are throughout their time at university working with real life problems <lb/>and projects in groups. This give them both theoretical depth and understanding as well as broad competencies <lb/>within for instance group dynamics, cross-disciplinarity, and an ability to relate to given challenges and task rather <lb/>than theoretical exercises. <lb/>This pedagogical and didactical approach has two conspicuously results: Aalborg University &quot; s students are <lb/>by far the students in the country to graduate within the official duration of their study programme, and they are <lb/>also the ones who get a job quickest after graduation. This calls for the different faculties within the FH <lb/>Schmalkalden to join forces and develop new cross-disciplinary educations. As more and more faculties offer <lb/>project oriented education in cooperation with business and industry, a closer look at new study combinations <lb/>could be an option. Especially if the university act upon the recommendation of an enhanced look at the region &quot; s <lb/>need and wishes for a development structure within new and undiscovered areas and lines of business. <lb/>For more information regarding Aalborg university &quot; s model for problem based learning (pbl), see here <lb/>http://www.en.aau.dk/about+aalborg+university/the+aalborg+model+for+problem+based+learning+%28pbl%29/ <lb/>and <lb/>for <lb/>a <lb/>closer <lb/>look <lb/>at <lb/>the <lb/>university &quot; s <lb/>cross-disciplinary <lb/>education, <lb/>see <lb/>here <lb/>http://www.en.aau.dk/education+%26+programmes/ <lb/></body>

			<body>ASSESSMENT FRAMEWORK <lb/>The OECD LEED Programme has developed from previous international case study work on <lb/>university entrepreneurship support and the theoretical debate of the role of universities in generating <lb/>entrepreneurial motivations, intentions, and competences below presented Criteria List of good <lb/>practice. <lb/>The Criteria List served as assessment framework for the here presented findings and <lb/>recommendations. <lb/>At the same time the Criteria List is a &apos;tool&apos;, which allows universities to self-assess and re-orient <lb/>their strategy in supporting entrepreneurship, their current pool of financial and human resources, the <lb/>existing support infrastructure, current practices in, and evaluation of, entrepreneurship education and <lb/>start-up support. <lb/>Strategy and top-management support <lb/>A university needs a clear vision and strategy that responds to what is entrepreneurship, why does the <lb/>university promote entrepreneurship, who are target groups, what does the support consists of, how it is <lb/>delivered and by whom. Clear incentives and rewards are needed for professors, researchers and students to <lb/>engage. The internal and external communication of a university with regard to entrepreneurship matters; <lb/>information needs to be easily accessible. <lb/>Criteria <lb/> There is a clear vision and strategy behind the university provided entrepreneurship support. <lb/> Objectives of entrepreneurship education and start-up support include generating <lb/>entrepreneurial attitudes, behaviour and competences, as well as enhancing growth <lb/>entrepreneurship (both high-tech and low-tech). <lb/> There are clear incentives and rewards for entrepreneurship educators, professors and <lb/>researchers, who actively support graduate entrepreneurship (mentoring, sharing of <lb/>research results, etc.). <lb/> Recruitment and career development of academic staff takes into account entrepreneurial <lb/>attitudes, behaviour, prior experience as well as current entrepreneurship support activities. <lb/>Financial resources <lb/>Public kick-off funding for entrepreneurship support infrastructure is common practice today. Yet, it is the <lb/>balance between a minimum long-term financing for staff costs and overheads and the openness to private <lb/>sector involvement in the financing of Entrepreneurship Chairs and incubation facilities which proves to be <lb/>successful in an international comparison. <lb/>Criteria <lb/> A minimum long-term financing of staff costs and overheads for graduate entrepreneurship is <lb/>agreed as part of the university &quot; s budget. <lb/> Self-sufficiency of university internal entrepreneurship support is a goal. <lb/></body>

			<page>19 <lb/></page>

			<body>Human resources <lb/>Entrepreneurship support in universities, in particular entrepreneurship education, is demanding reinforcement <lb/>and development of existing human resources and employing new staff. Working with entrepreneurs, chief <lb/>executives, bankers, venture capitalists and business angels is important to link theory with practice. <lb/>Criteria <lb/> Regular, relevant training for staff involved in entrepreneurship education is in place. <lb/> Regular, relevant for staff involved in start-up support is in place. <lb/>Support infrastructure <lb/>Moving towards greater cross-faculty collaboration in entrepreneurship support and greater connection <lb/>between entrepreneurship education and start-up support provision will require a co-ordination unit. <lb/>Universities will need to find their place in existing start-up and entrepreneurship support systems. Networking <lb/>and incentives for clear referral systems are needed to increase the effectiveness of start-up support and <lb/>reduce duplication, confusion and waste of resources. <lb/>Criteria <lb/> An entrepreneurship dedicated structure within the university (chair, department, support <lb/>centre) is in place, which closely collaborates, co-ordinates and integrates faculty-internal <lb/>entrepreneurship support and ensures viable cross-faculty collaboration. <lb/> Facilities for business incubation either exist on the campus or assistance is offered to gain <lb/>access to external facilities. <lb/> There is close co-operation and referral between university-internal and external business <lb/>start-up and entrepreneurship support organisations; roles are clearly defined. <lb/>Entrepreneurship education <lb/>Ideally all students should have access to a wide range of entrepreneurial learning opportunities inside and <lb/>outside their courses of study. Increasing take-up rates will require both expanding and tailoring the offer in <lb/>entrepreneurship education. The goal is to generate entrepreneurial intentions and to develop competences for <lb/>entrepreneurship. Progressively the offer in entrepreneurship education should be expanded and tailored to <lb/>the different interests and needs of participants. Engaging in exchange of good practices in creative teaching <lb/>methods at wider regional, local and international levels will facilitate improvement and innovation. <lb/>Criteria <lb/> Entrepreneurship education is progressively integrated into curricula and the use of <lb/>entrepreneurial pedagogies is advocated across faculties. <lb/> The entrepreneurship education offer is widely communicated, and measures are <lb/>undertaken to increase the rate and capacity of take-up. <lb/> A suite of courses exists, which uses creative teaching methods and is tailored to the needs <lb/>of undergraduate, graduate and post-graduate students. <lb/> The suite of courses has a differentiated offer that covers the pre-start-up phase, the start-up <lb/>phase and the growth phase. For certain courses active recruitment is practiced. <lb/> Out-reach to Alumni, business support organisations and firms is a key component of <lb/>entrepreneurship education. <lb/> Results of entrepreneurship research are integrated into entrepreneurship education. <lb/></body>

			<body>Start-up support <lb/>Start-up support is providing a helping hand in business start-up without taking away the &quot; do it on your own &quot; . It <lb/>is all about making, entrepreneurship support systems accessible and attractive for future entrepreneurs, and <lb/>about rectifying market and system failures in financing and premises. A key success factor lies in private <lb/>sector collaboration. Universities can create a protected environment for nascent entrepreneurship. This can <lb/>be an important stimulus for students and researchers to make a first step towards the creation of a venture. <lb/>Yet, in order to avoid &apos;over protection&apos;, early exposure to market conditions is advisable. <lb/>Criteria <lb/> Entrepreneurship education activities and start-up support are closely integrated. <lb/> Team building is actively facilitated by university staff. <lb/> Access to public and private financing is facilitated through networking and dedicated events. <lb/> Mentoring by professors and entrepreneurs is facilitated. <lb/> University-internal business start-up support is closely integrated into external business <lb/>support partnerships and networks, and maintains close relationships with firms and Alumni. <lb/>Evaluation <lb/>Assisting the establishment of new firms is a key objective of university entrepreneurship support, but not its <lb/>only one. For entrepreneurship education creating entrepreneurial mindsets that drive, for example, <lb/>modernisation and innovation in existing firms, is of equal importance, yet success is much more difficult to <lb/>measure. Hence, the co-existence of tangible outputs (e.g., number of assisted new ventures) and intangible <lb/>outcomes, such as the spread of entrepreneurial culture and the creation of entrepreneurial mindsets, renders <lb/>assessing the impact of university entrepreneurship support a challenge that requires tailored approaches and <lb/>systematic, long-term evaluation efforts. <lb/>Criteria <lb/> Regular stock-taking and performance checking of entrepreneurship education activities is <lb/>undertaken. <lb/> Regular stock-taking and performance checking of start-up support is undertaken. <lb/> There is systematic evaluation of entrepreneurship education activities in terms of their <lb/>impact on achievement of prior defined objectives. <lb/> There is systematic evaluation of start-up support provision. <lb/>Source: OECD (2010), &quot; Universities, Innovation and Entrepreneurship: Criteria and Examples of Good <lb/>Practice &quot; , OECD Publishing. http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/5km7rq0pq00q-en, adapted. <lb/></body>
