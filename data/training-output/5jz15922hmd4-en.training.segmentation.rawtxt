been prepared, intended to provide descriptive, easily comprehensible, highly informative accounts of the 
mental health systems of OECD countries. These profiles, entitled 'Mental Health Analysis Profiles' 
(MHAPs), will be able to inform discussion and reflection and provide an introduction to and a synthesised 
account of mental health in a given country. Each MHAP follows the same template, and whilst the 
MHAPs are stand-alone profiles, loose cross-country comparison using the MHAPs is possible and 
encouraged. The recent history of mental health in Italy has been one of de-institutionalisation. The significant 
overhaul undertaken with regards to mental health over the last years is an example of this process: as it 
moved away from the century-long tradition of restrictive mental health asylums (manicomi) from the late 
1970s with the recent process of closures of judicial psychiatric hospitals (Ospedali Psichiatrici Giudiziari 
– OPG), Italy progressively managed to integrate mental health services within community-based facilities. 
Focus was no longer on security and on isolating citizens suffering from mental disorders, but rather on 
patients' needs and moving towards social integration and rehabilitation. RÉSUMÉ Lancée dans le cadre d'un projet plus vaste consacré à la santé mentale dans les pays de l'OCDE, la 
série de profils « Santé mentale : profils d'analyse » (Mental Health Analysis Profiles -MHAP) vise à 
décrire de manière simple et détaillée les systèmes de santé mentale des pays de l'OCDE. Ces profils, qui 
étayeront les examens et les réflexions qui seront menés, feront le point sur la situation d'un pays donné 
dans le domaine de la santé mentale. Les profils MHAP sont indépendants les uns des autres mais suivent 
le même modèle : il est donc possible, et recommandé, de les utiliser pour procéder à des comparaisons 
entre pays. L'histoire récente de la santé mentale en Italie a été marquée par la désinstitutionalisation, comme en 
témoignent les réformes importantes entreprises au cours des dernières années : en abandonnant peu à peu 
le placement traditionnel en hôpital psychiatrique (manicomi) à partir de la fin des années 1970 et en 
procédant depuis peu à la fermeture des hôpitaux psychiatriques judiciaires (Ospedali Psichiatrici 
Giudiziari -OPG), l'Italie est parvenue progressivement à intégrer des services de santé mentale dans les 
services de proximité. La priorité n'est plus accordée à la sécurité et à l'isolement des patients souffrant de 
troubles mentaux, mais plutôt aux besoins des patients, à leur insertion sociale et à leur réadaptation. DELSA/HEA/WD/HWP(2014)4 5 LIST OF ACRONYMS AGENAS: National Agency for Regional Healthcare (Agenzia per i Servizi Sanitari Regionali)

This report is part of a series of descriptive profiles – Mental Health Analysis Profiles (MHAPs), 
produced by the OECD to give key insights into the mental health systems of select OECD countries. 
Following a set framework, these profiles give a detailed introduction to the history, mental health needs, 
and organisation and payment of care in select mental health systems. Countries have been selected so as 
to give an overview of different ways of approaching mental health care system organisation across the 
OECD, as well as to highlight examples of particularly innovative practice. 2. 
Having been one of the first countries to embark on the process of de-institutionalisation, Italy 
remains a world leader and a great innovator in care for mental disorders. Replacing psychiatric asylums 
with community-based services started in the 1960s and 1970s with the antipsychiatry movement led by 
Franco Basaglia, and was formalised with the adoption of Law 180 in 1978, and consolidated in 1999 with 
the actual closure of all mental hospitals in Italy. The Ministry of Health is committed to continuing to 
reducing the use of inpatient psychiatric treatment, and to shortening the length of stay in Residential 
Facilities, as part of the on-going de-institutionalisation process. 3. 
The federal organisation of Italy's health system, and mental health system, also makes Italy a 
particularly interesting example. The Federal system gives regions significant autonomy to organise, 
finance, deliver and monitor mental health services independently of central government, and to identify 
priorities in the mental health sector outside of a standardised national approach. As a consequence of this 
system, significant differences exist across regions in terms of the quality and quantity of mental health 
services, with examples of striking innovation and successful care delivery found alongside much less 
successful practices. 4. 
This report is designed to describe how mental health care is provided across the Italian 
population, from service provision for children and young people to available mental health care for older 
people. Attention is also paid to any groups in the population who may have difficulties accessing 
appropriate mental health care, for example minority ethnic groups. The report begins with a short history 
of the evolution of the Italian mental health system alongside a summary of the mental health 
characteristics of the population. The report goes on to describe the design of the Italian mental health 
system, recent mental health policy and legislation and a detailed examination of the mental health services 
and financing in the country. Examples of national, regional and local mental health initiatives and group-
specific programmes are also explored. DELSA/HEA/WD/HWP(2014)4 10 1. MENTAL HEALTH HISTORY, LEGISLATION AND HUMAN RIGHTS 1.1. History and development of the mental health system 5. 
Stemming back to well before the unification of Italy in 1861, the mental health system was 
fragmented into numerous mental health facilities and lacked unified regulation. Despite the contribution 
of the Italian physician Vincenzo Chiarugi (1759-1820), who drew up the regulations of the S. Bonifacio 
Hospital in Florence (1789) (Burti, 2001), the first steps towards a more regulated mental health system 
occurred only at the beginning of the 20 th century. As a result of the increasing number of people suffering 
from some kind of mental disorder and seeking admission to mental hospitals, in 1901 a committee of 
provincial councillors headed by Professor Belmondo was appointed by the provincial deputation of 
Venice in order to inspect the region's mental health facilities. At the time of the inspection, there was still 
no legislation regulating and unifying the variety of mental health facilities in the territory. Provincial 
asylums, charitable institutions, hospital wards devoted to mental health and private asylums constituted 
the spectrum of mental health services offered by localities, although substantial differences existed across 
the regions. Management responsibilities differed significantly across asylums, with cases where physician 
directors were given full health and administrative powers and other cases where they retained no major 
responsibilities over expenses and financing. Common to all services were shortages of medical and 
nursing staff, insufficient food provisions for inpatients, a lack of adequate hygienic conditions, the use of 
brutal means of restraint and overcrowded facilities due to increasing inpatient admissions coupled with 
decreasing discharge rates. The evaluation report that followed the inspection triggered questioning within 
provincial councils, with substantial changes being promptly introduced: the harshest means of restraint 
were abolished, health care personnel were replaced and some of the serving asylum directors were 
relieved of duty (Babini, 2009). 6. 
This restructuring process culminated in the adoption in 1904 of a mental health bill by the 
Government, then headed by Prime Minister Giolitti. The Law 36 of 1904 ( " Provisions on Public and 
Private Mental Hospitals " ) was the first mental health law in Italy aiming to regulate the development and 
management of mental health facilities. The law gave psychiatrists full authority over the management and 
administration of mental health services, including disciplinary and enforcement responsibilities. 
Nevertheless, Law 36 was mainly centred on social control measures rather than on patients' health needs. 
Being labelled a danger to themselves and others, patients were committed against their will by physicians 
and police magistrates. These compulsory admissions could be ruled as permanent by a court of justice, 
and led to the loss of civil and political rights (Lo Scalzo et al., 2009). In 1880, Enrico Morselli, an 
illustrious Italian psychiatrist, had already highlighted the tricky nature of the mental health asylum 
institution, which stems from its dual purpose of healing mentally disordered people whilst protecting 
society from potential harm. Only with the adoption of Law 180 in 1978 and the progressive closure of 
mental health hospitals in Italy did mental health treatment and social security embark on two clearly 
distinct paths. The conditions that led to the development, approval and implementation of Law 180 have 
to be sought in the years between 1904 and 1978. 7. 
In most European countries, the period between the First and Second World Wars saw the 
development of somatic therapies mainly used for the treatment of schizophrenic patients, namely shock 
therapies, e.g. insulin shock (Sakel in Austria 1933), cardiazolic shock (1935), psychosurgery (Moniz in 
Portugal; Fiamberti in Italy, 1935), acetylcholine shock (1937) and finally electroshock (Cerletti in Italy, 
1938) (Babini, 2009). In the aftermath of the two world wars, these therapies became a valid and DELSA/HEA/WD/HWP(2014)4 11 inexpensive means of control over mentally disordered patients. The development of the first psychiatric 
drugs from 1951 onwards in Italy and in other Western countries significantly transformed the approach to 
patients' mental health care and the way mental hospitals were managed. On the one hand, the use of 
psychotropic pharmaceuticals substantially changed the relationship between patients and nurses, whose 
tasks passed from control, restraint and coercion to assistance and education. On the other hand, this 
dramatically transformed the relationship between patients and psychiatrists, allowing medical staff to 
adopt forms of therapy, including psychotherapy, other than shock therapies and restraint measures. 8. 
Running in parallel with the development of psychotropic drugs was the revision of mental health 
legislation in most Western countries. e.g. Portugal (1945), Norway (1949), Sweden (1949), England 
(1948-1959), United States (1951), France (1953-1954) and Germany (1952). In Italy, even though many 
proposals for the renovation of mental health legislation were introduced, ultimately they were never 
adopted by the Parliament. 9. 
However, in 1962 the Ministry of Health published  " The Annals of Public Health "  (Annali della 
Sanità Pubblica), a report devoted entirely to a description of Italy's mental health system. The outcomes 
of the investigation revealed serious deficiencies within the provision of mental health services across the 
country: a complete absence of any type of mental health facility in some regions; major differences in 
terms of provision from region to region, with northern Italy being significantly more equipped than the 
south; shortages in psychiatric bed provision; and insufficient availability of medical and nurse mental 
health staff (Babini, 2009). 10. 
As it became increasingly apparent that Law 36 was anachronistic, some initial experiments with 
mental health institutions were conducted in the 1960s. The state mental hospital of Gorizia (Friuli-
Venezia-Giulia) headed by Franco Basaglia, a psychiatrist with a phenomenological orientation, was the 
first example of the progressive de-institutionalisation process that later unfolded in other mental health 
asylums across Italy. Psychiatric wards were progressively opened, allowing patients more freedom to 
circulate both in the hospital and the municipality; excessively restrictive measures were abandoned (Burti, 
2001); contact between physicians and patients was encouraged and strengthened; several activity clubs, an 
internal journal named  " Il Picchio " , as well as domestic  " committees "  integrating patients in the 
management process of the asylum were established; medical uniforms were abolished. For the first time 
in the history of mental health in Italy, even patients suffering from the most serious disorders were 
entrusted with responsibilities within the hospital (Basaglia, 1968). In addition, the Gorizia mental health 
institution implemented a vast programme of discharge. Far from being an isolated event, the Gorizia pilot 
trial served as an example for the development of similar experiments in democratisation and de-
institutionalisation across state mental health hospitals in Italy, e.g. Perugia (1965), Parma (1965), Cividale 
del Friuli (1968) and Nocera Superiore (1969) (Babini, 2009). Overall the Gorizia experiment contributed 
to eradicating the belief that mentally disordered individuals were dangerous for the society and led to 
replacing old-fashioned custodial care with alternative community care (Transella, 1986). 11. 
In 1968, the Minister of Health, Luigi Mariotti, after comparing mental health asylums to 
concentration camps ( " Manicomi come lager " ) (Babini, 2009), approved the law excerpt n. 431 (otherwise 
called the Mariotti Law), which made some substantial changes to the 1904 Law. Law excerpt 431 allowed 
for voluntary hospitalisation in mental health hospitals that did not entail the loss of political and civil 
rights; it eliminated the inscription of mentally disordered people onto criminal records (as established by 
the Rocco Code under the Government of Mussolini), a formal stigma preventing mentally disordered 
individuals for accessing public jobs once released from the asylum. 12. 
The years following the adoption of law 431 in 1968 saw the growth of the anti-psychiatry 
movement, a political and cultural movement some of whose major exponents included, amongst others, 
Michel Foucault in France, R.D. Laing in Scotland, Thomas Szasz in Hungary and Franco Basaglia in DELSA/HEA/WD/HWP(2014)4 12 Italy. Mistrusting the attribution of mental illness to its biological components, the anti-psychiatry 
movement claimed that the origin of mental disorders had to be sought in political, family, social and 
relational roots, and subsequently criticised the the use of contention to deal with mental health disordered 
individuals (Bersani, 2009). Concretely, the movement aimed at creating two-way streets between the 
mental health system and the broader community, establishing social cooperatives by joining forces with 
other citizens' groups, and working toward community inclusion on a person-by-person basis (Davidson et 
al., 2010). Designed like this, the process involves all its subjects as active participants, transforms the 
power relationship existing between the patient (and citizen) and the institution, and creates mental health 
services that completely replace detention in mental hospitals by deconstructing them and reconverting the 
material and human resources found in them (De Leonardis et al., 1986). In the wake of the Gorizia 
experiment and with the impetus of the anti-psychiatry protest, other mental health asylums started 
following the Gorizia example. One of the most representative instances of the anti-psychiatry movement 
was the mental hospital of San Giovanni, based in Trieste and headed by Franco Basaglia (see Box 1). Box 1. San Giovanni psychiatric hospital in Trieste The San Giovanni psychiatric hospital was built in 1908 in Trieste. In Italy at that time, the San Giovanni 
psychiatric hospital was considered an exemplary model of mental health asylum, but from the 1930s security 
measures were introduced. In 1971, the then president of the provincial administration, the left-wing Christian 
Democrat Michele Zanetti appointed Franco Basaglia director of the San Giovanni asylum, with the idea of renovating 
psychiatric care, requalifying the medical and nurse personnel and raising funds for the psychiatric hospital. As director 
of the San Giovanni hospital, which at that time hosted approximately 1200 inpatients, 90% of whom were mandatory, 
Basaglia started a process of criticism of the mental health institution (Dell'Acqua, 2010). As soon as Basaglia became the director of the asylum, the Mariotti Law was implemented in the hospital, with 
the aim of increasing and strengthening the medical personnel. Basaglia preferred to train young physicians rather 
than hiring psychiatrists already active in other mental health asylums. Together with nurses and future psychiatrists, a 
large number of volunteers, including students and workers, were also integrated into the asylum's community life. 
Volunteers actively participated in the hospital's decision-making process, contributed to organising activities for 
inpatients and followed patients on an individual basis. Even patients suffering from severe mental health disorders 
were entrusted with responsibilities within the hospital. It was a patient who used to swallow every type of metallic 
object, provoking serious injuries to his person, to whom Basaglia gave managing responsibilities over the coffee bar 
within the hospital; and a group of women were allowed to conduct autonomous lives in the apartment that was 
previously used by the asylum's director (Basaglia, 1968). As in the Gorizia experiment, constraint measures were abolished, the use of electroshock was suppressed, the 
barriers enclosing the wards were removed and the hospital doors and gates opened. In 1972, a programme of 
financial subsidies was launched. Grants were assigned to former patients who were unemployed in order to avoid 
renewed hospitalisation and to escape the vicious cycle binding poverty with seclusion. At the beginning of 1973, Art. 4 
of the Mariotti law was implemented within the hospital, according to which voluntary admissions allowed a patient (the 
 " host " ) to be hospitalised without losing civil and political rights. Running in parallel to this vast range of democratisation and de-institutionalisation was the idea that further 
initiatives should be undertaken in order to look beyond the asylum walls and towards the community, by putting in 
contact  " sane "  people living in the city with  " mentally ill "  patients living in the hospital. A group of patients started to 
increasingly participate in parties and activities within the city of Trieste. On February 1973, a blue-painted horse of 
paper-machè and wood, called  " Marco Cavallo " , together with a long procession of patients, physicians, nurses and 
health workers, paraded the streets of Trieste. The wooden horse was built by the patients in the course of a 
painting/sculpture/theatre/writing workshop within the hospital, and the name  " Marco Cavallo "  was adopted in honour 
of the horse that for years had been transporting the patient's linen from the hospital to the laundry.  " Marco Cavallo "  
became the symbol of the process of liberation of inpatients, bringing the mentally disordered people into the social life 
of Trieste. In September 1973, the United Workers Cooperative (Cooperativa dei Lavoratori Uniti), composed of San 
Giovanni inpatients, was legally recognised. The members of the Cooperative were given a paid contract for the 
cleaning and maintenance of the hospital, putting an end to the use of occupational therapy within the hospital. DELSA/HEA/WD/HWP(2014)4 13 Following these developments at the San Giovanni hospital, in October 1973 the WHO declared Trieste a  " pilot 
zone "  for psychiatry (Babini, 2009). The de-institutionalisation process culminated with the opening of the first 
community-based mental health centres in areas surrounding the San Giovanni hospital in 1975-1976, actually shifting 
the axis of mental health care from the hospital to the community (Dell'Acqua, 2010). Following the inception of Law 
180 in 1978, the hospital of Trieste was closed in 1980. The San Giovanni mental health hospital of Trieste was the 
first hospital that has been closed in Italy, paving the way for the de-institutionalisation of mental patients and the 
establishment of an alternative model of community-based services, performing all the functions and providing all the 
services that were previously provided by asylums (Russo & Carelli, 2009).  " […] the important thing is that we have shown that the impossible becomes possible. Ten, fifteen, twenty 
years ago, it was unthinkable that an asylum could be dismantled. Asylums could become closed, and more 
closed than before – I do not know – but, at any account, we have shown that the mad can be assisted in 
another way, and this evidence is basic "  (Basaglia, 1979). 13. 
In 1978, Law 180 (also called Law Basaglia) was approved, with the mental hospital of Trieste 
being the first asylum to be closed in Italy. Law 180 in fact forbade new admissions to mental health 
institutes and the construction of new mental hospitals. Law 180 aimed at progressively closing existing 
mental hospitals, thus operating a translation from old mental health facilities, isolated from other health 
departments, to new fully integrated psychiatric services. Prevention, care and rehabilitation represented an 
important new feature of the 1978 law, in place of the aforementioned restrictive social control measures, 
with the new mental health facilities being in charge of the full array of mental health care, i.e. providing 
appropriate care to patients through community-based services, outpatient interventions and/or exceptional 
and temporary compulsory admissions (Lo Scalzo, 2009). Law 180 represented undisputed progress 
towards de-institutionalisation in Italy and abroad, and led to the progressive closure of mental health 
hospitals, the recognition of civil rights for people suffering from some kind of mental disorder, the 
transformation of the century-long relationship between psychiatry and justice, and the establishment of a 
variety of community-based mental health facilities within the territory. The inception of the de-
institutionalisation of mental health in Italy also coincided with the creation of the National Health Service 
(NHS) (Servizio Sanitario Nazionale -SSN) in 1978. 14. 
This transition from old-style mental hospitals to new community-based facilities was, however, 
a slow process, with the 1978 law failing to design a precise framework and timeline for this transition and 
with all mental health hospitals being eventually closed only in 1999 (WHO, 2011) (for further information 
on the closure of mental hospitals, see Box 2). Box 2. The process of closure of mental hospitals There are currently no mental hospitals in Italy, as all of them have progressively been replaced by the 
Departments of Mental Health (DMHs) (Dipartimento di Salute Mentale –DSM) and a set of mental health services 
and facilities including Community Mental Health Centres (CMHCs), the General Hospital Psychiatric Units (GHPU), 
semi-residential facilities and residential facilities (Ministry of Health, 2011c; Ministry of Health, 2011d). Before the de-institutionalisation process brought about by Law 180, in 1978 there were 76 mental hospitals in 
Italy with a total of 78 538 mental health residents (De Girolamo et al., 2007a). Law 180 enforced the compulsory 
closure of all existing mental hospitals and the discharge of all patients committed to asylums. Further legislation 
established the Department of Mental Health as the community-based service in charge of mental health care in each 
Local Health Authority (ASL), and thus devolved care for mental illness to ASLs. This was, however, a slow and 
difficult process, as precise guidelines for the transition from asylums to community-based facilities were not provided 
in Law 180. The financial law 724 of 1994 established a deadline for the final closure of all former mental health 
hospitals (December 31st 1996). A committee for monitoring the progressive closure of mental hospitals was 
appointed, but the process was nonetheless gradual and slow. Other financial laws in 1996 (Law 662) and 1997 (Law 
449) reaffirmed the necessity of the planned closure of mental hospitals, a task that was eventually postponed until 
1998 and finally completed in 1999 (Lo Scalzo et al., 2009). DELSA/HEA/WD/HWP(2014)4 14 15. 
A set of two mental health national plans implemented in 1994 and 1998 further specified 
guidelines for service organisation, personnel training and transitional supervision (Ministry of Health, 
1994; Ministry of Health, 2008a). A number of initiatives for monitoring the process were also promoted 
by the Ministry of Health and offered support to the regions to complete the transition. 16. 
The first Targeted Mental Health Care Plan (Progetto Obiettivo per la Tutela della Salute 
Mentale 1994-1996) (Ministry of Health, 1994) was implemented in the mid-1990s and created the 
Department of Mental Health (DMH), a network of mental health services responsible for mental health 
interventions and planning in each Local Health Authority. Guidelines on training personnel were defined 
and the final closure of old mental institutions was planned, but completed only in 1999. 17. 
A second national plan for mental health was then adopted for the period 1998-2000 in order to 
further define guidelines for residential facilities, which were to provide services for the last patients still 
committed in the old mental institutions, and for health interventions, social integration and rehabilitation. 
In this respect, the Targeted Mental Health Care Plan 1998-2000 (Progetto Obiettivo Tutela Salute Mentale 
1998-2000) (Ministry of Health, 1998a) focused mainly on providing for better integration of existing 
mental health services (Burti, 2001) and for quality of care. The Targeted Mental Health Care Plan 1998-
2000 aims at designing coverage for people affected by severe mental disorders and thus unable to live 
autonomously or exercise fully their citizenship rights. This population constitutes the core of priority 
health interventions that must be undertaken with the full cooperation and collaboration of mental health 
services, families and associations. The goals of the Targeted Mental Health Care Plan 1998-2000 were: @BULLET To promote mental health in throughout the life cycle, even in the heart of medical prevention 
programmes and health education programmes; @BULLET To prevent mental disorders at primary and secondary levels, with particular focus on high-risk 
sub-populations through the early mapping of difficult situations (especially among young 
people) and therapeutic-preventive interventions; @BULLET To prevent mental disorders in public health, i.e. effectively decreasing disabling consequences 
via the reconstruction of personal, relational and social interconnections for people with severe 
mental disorders (with a focus on rehabilitation through work). This reconstructive mission takes 
place through resource activation; @BULLET To maintain mental health and quality of life within the family nucleus to acceptable levels, 
improving the global functioning of family nuclei with serious relational issues, reducing the 
figures on suicide and attempted suicide in high-risk populations (i.e. specific mental pathologies 
or age-groups, like adolescents and seniors); @BULLET To achieve better integration of mental health services with other services (universities, local 
administrations, non-profit organisations, etc.) and encourage participation of non-public actors 
(user and family associations); @BULLET To promote better and more comprehensive information for patients and families, along with 
evidence-based medicine, standards for the certification of services and quality assurance; @BULLET To evaluate the efficacy and effectiveness of interventions; @BULLET To reorganise the delivery system of mental health services for children and adolescents. DELSA/HEA/WD/HWP(2014)4 15 18. 
Strategies to attain these goals aimed at specifying the organisation of the mental health services, 
since prior legislation had failed to do so. The Targeted Mental Health Care Plan 1998-2000 set out the 
characteristics of the Departments of Mental Health (DMHs) (Dipartimento Salute Mentale – DSM) that 
resulted from the first national plan for mental health for the period 1994-1998. In particular, the 1998-
2000 Targeted Mental Health Care Plan stated that each of the then 196 Local Health Authorities in Italy 
should have its own Department of Mental Health, with coverage of a population of at most 150 000 
inhabitants. There should be one Director for each DMH, in charge of managing the human and financial 
resources allocated to the module, organising a Monitoring and Evaluation System, and contributing to the 
promotion of quality assurance and the provision of ongoing personnel training. There should be an 
average ratio of one Department of Mental Health professional for every 1 500 inhabitants. Moreover, the 
Targeted Mental Health Care Plan 1998-2000 specified the functions of each mental health service 
provided by the Department of Mental Health (Ministry of Health, 1998a) (for further information on 
mental health services provided by DMHs, see section 4.1.). 19. 
A new policy document, the National Strategic Plan for Mental Health (Linee di indirizzo 
nazionali per la salute mentale) (Ministry of Health, 2008a), was issued in March 2008, with the approval 
of the Standing Conference on the Relations between the State, the Regions and the Autonomous 
Provinces (hereafter the Standing Conference between State and Regions) (Conferenza Stato/Regioni). 
This document updated the priorities and underlined the critical areas where intervention was required, 
especially concerning the Departments of Mental Health and the necessity to homogenise their services 
across the territory. Local and regional collaboration are also pointed out as key elements for improving 
equity of access to mental health services and overall quality, with the Departments of Mental Health being 
responsible for organising consultation roundtables (tavolo di concertazione locale) on priority objectives. 
The Local Health Authorities also were required to be equipped with their own Local Plan for Mental 
Health (Piano di Azione Locale per la Salute Mentale) obtained through consultation with all local actors. 
However, at the moment only a few regions have formally included the 2008 National Strategic Plan for 
Mental Health into their regional planning. 20. 
The last national mental health strategy was released in January 2013 – the Italian Mental Health 
Action Plan (IMHAP) (Linee di Azioni Nazionale per la Salute Mentale) (Ministry of Health, 2013) (see 
section 6.2 for further information). 21. 
Although the core of mental health strategies are settled within national mental health plans, 
every two years a National Health Plan (Piano Sanitario Nazionale) is released by the Ministry of Health 
with a special section devoted to mental health as a priority area – as did, for example, the National Health 
Plan 2006-2008 (Ministry of Health, 2006). The plan individuated the weaknesses of the mental health 
system in Italy and identified the priority areas for joint focus by the Government and regions. Overall staff 
shortages and the need to manage deficiencies in the Departments of Mental Health (DMHs) resulted in an 
inability to provide adequate services for individuals with mental illness; the general population is unaware 
of the meaning of mental illness; there is little knowledge about the existence of mental health facilities 
and how they work; and there is a general lack of early intervention in severe mental health cases. The 
overall goals of the 2006 National Health Plan were: @BULLET Reducing stigma; @BULLET Actuating early intervention programmes for the treatment of schizophrenia; @BULLET Guaranteeing therapeutic continuity between mental health services for children, adolescents, 
adults and older people; @BULLET Establishing recovery and reintegration programmes for mentally disordered offenders; DELSA/HEA/WD/HWP(2014)4 16 @BULLET Developing a National Mental Health Information System. 22. 
The last release of the National Health Plan covered the period 2011-2013 (Piano Sanitario 
Nazionale 2011-2013) (Ministry of Health, 2011a). At the time of writing, this last release is still in draft 
form. In the section devoted to mental health, some key areas were pinpointed: @BULLET Children and adolescents' mental health; @BULLET Old people's mental health; @BULLET Suicides; @BULLET Mental disorders related to substance abuse; @BULLET Mental health within prisons and security services; @BULLET The physical well-being of mentally disordered individuals.

Italy's mental health legislation comprises one national law on the principles of mental health 
provision, twenty separate regional laws and separate legislation from two autonomous Provinces, 
consistent with the fact that the planning, management and administration of health services are 
constitutionally devolved to the regions. 24. 
National Mental Health Law 180/1978: The national law on mental health, Law 180 (or Law 
Basaglia), was approved on 13 May 1978. From 1978, the broad national law has remained unchanged, 
whereas regional laws have been revised several times. DELSA/HEA/WD/HWP(2014)4 17 25. 
The 1978 national law on mental health covered four principal elements: @BULLET The immediately effective ban on new admissions to existing mental hospitals and on the 
building of new mental hospitals or similar facilities; a planned gradual closure of existing mental 
hospitals; @BULLET The establishment of psychiatric wards within general hospitals, with a maximum of 15 beds 
each; @BULLET The promotion of community-based services – Community-based Mental Health Centres – put in 
charge of the full array of mental health needs in the community (prevention, care and 
rehabilitation); @BULLET The establishment of the CTO, the Compulsory Treatment Orders (Trattamento Sanitario 
Obbligatorio, TSO), which asserted that compulsory admissions for mental illness would focus 
on patients' health needs and should be temporary, exceptional and highly monitored by medical 
staff and a court of Justice (see below). 26. 
Law 180 was incorporated as Articles 33, 34, 35 and 64 into Law 833 of 31 December 1978 
(hereafter, Law 833/1978). Law 833/1978 reformed Italy's entire health system. 27. 
Art. 33-35 of Law 833/1978: The Compulsory Treatment Order (CTO) (Trattamento Sanitario 
Obbligatorio – TSO) was introduced with Law 180 and is currently regulated by Law 833/1978 (Art.33-
35). It covers carrying out assessments and providing treatments to mentally disordered individuals who 
refuse to be treated. There are three major conditions under which the CTO could apply: the person is 
affected by some kind of mental health illness and subsequently needs urgent medical treatment; the person 
refuses to be treated; besides hospitalisation, there is no other timely and appropriate measure that could be 
undertaken to treat the person. The implementation of a CTO occurs both at the medical and judicial level: 
after two medical doctors make a formal request to the relevant Local Health Authority for the patient to 
receive the CTO, the mayor of the city (Sindaco) approves or denies it within 10 days from the referral. 
Though extendable, the CTO has a maximum duration of seven days (see section 1.2. on seclusion and 
restraint). 28. 
Law 68/1999: Law 68 on the right to work for people with disabilities (Norme per il Diritto al 
Lavoro dei Disabili) implemented a system of integration into the employment market. This legislation 
triggered a significant change, as Law 482 of 1968 focused mainly on a charitable philosophy that did not 
allow disabled people to feel integrated into the employment market and entitled to a proper wage for their 
work. In this respect, Law 68 focused on matching the work potentialities of disabled people with a work 
position, while not putting an additional burden on the firms concerned. This legislation was adopted after 
several trials were conducted in some Local Health Authorities in the Northern regions, as professional 
training and work integration were devolved to the regions and local authorities. 29. 
Law 67/2006:  " Measures for the safeguard of disabled people who are victims of discrimination "  
(Misure per la tutela giudiziaria delle persone con disabilità vittime di discriminazioni) is a legal 
framework aiming to protect the civil and political and economic rights of disabled individuals and protect 
them from stigma and discrimination. 30. 
Prime Ministerial Decree/2008 (Decreto Presidente del Consiglio dei Ministri – DPCM): 
approved on 1 April 2008, the 2008 DPCM requires the eventual transfer of health care responsibilities 
from the prison service (Department of prison administration; Department of Juvenile Justice) to the NHS. 
The Prime Ministerial Decree/2008 specifies which clinical-rehabilitative interventions should be DELSA/HEA/WD/HWP(2014)4 18 considered health interventions to be provided and monitored by the Ministry of Health and which ones 
were security measures that were to remain under the responsibility of the Ministry of Justice. It also 
reaffirmed that care and mental health interventions were provided through territorial and regional bodies, 
as was first implemented by Law 180 for civil psychiatry (see section 4.3. for further information). 31. 
Decree of 15 October 2010: Most recently, the decree of 15 October 2010 made way for the 
implementation of the long-awaited national Mental Health Information System (Sistema Informativo 
Salute Mentale -SISM) in order to ensure the viability of the Essential Levels of Assistance (Levelli 
Essenziali di Assistenza -LEA) and especially to: @BULLET Monitor the activity of mental health services and analyse their volume and treatment patterns; @BULLET Support the managerial activity of the Departments of Mental Health, in order to evaluate their 
efficiency and utilisation of resources; @BULLET Support the process of elaborating structural indicators on both regional and national levels. (For further information on the mental health information system see section 3.5.). Detainment, restraint and seclusion rates 32. 
CTOs accounted for 50% of total admissions in 1975 (3 years before the introduction of Law 
180), whilst the figure dropped to 20% in 1984 and to approximately 14% in recent years (De Girolamo et 
al., 2006a). CTOs (as a percentage of total psychiatric discharges) have increased slightly across the period 
2005-2008, from 14.16% of total psychiatric discharges in 2005 to 14.55% in 2008 (ISTAT, 2011). In 
regions where public beds are scarce (Sicilia, Valle d'Aosta, Emilia Romagna and Sardegna), CTOs are 
twice as frequent as in other regions (De Girolamo et al., 2006a; Ministry of Health, 2011b) (see Figure 1). Figure 1. CTOs discharge rates per 100 000 population, by region – 2010 Source: Ministry of Health (2011b). Rapporto annuale sull'attivita di ricovero ospedaliero. Dati SDO 2010. [Annual Report on

The WHO Global Burden of Disease Project estimated that, in Italy in 2001, 2 978 DALYs 1 per 
100 000 population are ascribable to neuropsychiatric disorders, representing approximately 25% of the 
overall burden of disease in Italy. In 2001, depression represented 7% of the total burden, substance abuse 
accounted for 5% (with alcohol use disorders representing 3% and drug use disorders 2%) and dementia 
4%. Bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, obsessive-compulsive disorder and panic disorder each represented 
1% of the total burden in Italy (Lopez et al., 2006). Prevalence of mild to moderate mental ill health 34. 
Two main mental health epidemiology studies were conducted in Italy over the last ten years: the 
 " European Study on the Epidemiology of Mental Disorders "  (ESEMeD) (Alonso et al., 2003; De Girolamo 
et al., 2006a; De Girolamo et al., 2006b) and the Sesto Fiorentino Study (Faravelli et al., 2004). Other 
epidemiology studies were conducted by the National Institute of Statistics (ISTAT, 2010) and the 
National Institute of Health (ISS, 2012a). 35. 
The ESEMeD is an international mental health survey of six countries (France, Germany, 
Belgium, Italy, Spain and Holland) conducted by the WHO in 2001-2002 (Alonso et al., 2003). Managed 
by the National Institute of Health (Istituto Superiore di Sanità – ISS) and conducted among 4 712 Italian 
citizens, the survey found that the annual prevalence of mild to moderate mental illness was 7.3% in Italy 
in 2001 (De Girolamo et al., 2006a). 36. 
Major depression, specific phobias and dysthymia (chronic depression) were the most common 
mental illnesses, with a lifetime prevalence in Italy of respectively 10.1%, 5.7% and 3.4%. Post-traumatic 
disorder, social phobia and general anxiety disorders had a lifetime prevalence of approximately 2%. Other 
mental illnesses covered by the survey (panic attacks, agoraphobia and alcoholism) had a relatively low 
prevalence (below 2%) (De Girolamo et al., 2006a). Women presented a higher risk of exposure to mental 
disorders, although alcohol use disorders were more common among men. High-risk populations included 
separated/divorced people and widowers, along with unemployed people (twice as likely to suffer from 
depression), housewives (twice as likely to suffer from any kind of mental disorder) and physically 
disabled people (eight times as likely to suffer from mental disorders). Moreover, the ESEMeD study gave 
evidence that people are likely to suffer from different mental disorders at the same time (co-morbidity). 
About 40% of people who suffered from depression in the considered year also experienced anxiety 
disorders, and 27% of people who suffered from anxiety disorders also suffered from depression. Although 
the statistical significance is questionable, the ESEMeD study also found that the prevalence of mental 
illness (especially depression and anxiety disorders) was higher in Southern Italy and the Islands (Sicilia 
and Sardegna) than in Northern and Central Italy (De Girolamo et al., 2006a). 37. 
The second epidemiological study was conducted over 2 363 residents in Sesto Fiorentino 
(Toscana), and reported that 8.6% of people were suffering from some kind of mental illness, with anxiety 
(3.5%) and depression (3.4%) being the most frequent type (Faravelli et al., 2004). 1  " Disability-adjusted life years "  (DALY) is a measure of the population's health that combines into a single 
indicator the  " years of life lost due to premature mortality and the years of life lost due to time lived in 
states of less than full health "  (WHO). DELSA/HEA/WD/HWP(2014)4 20 38. 
More recently, ISTAT published data on mental health prevalence indicating that 4.3% of the 
total population suffers from some kind of  " neurosis " , whilst the figure is more than double (9.8%) for 
people aged over 65 (ISTAT, 2010). 39. 
According to a national survey conducted by the Cnesps of the National Institute of Health 
(Istituto Superiore di Sanità – ISS) over a pool of Local Health Authorities in Italy (85% of all ASLs) in 
the period 2009-2012, 6.6% of people (adults aged 18-64) referred with probable symptoms of depression 
(see below), although differences exist across regions (see Figure 2). Of these individuals, 58.2% sought 
some kind of help: 32.5% consulted a doctor (GP or specialist), 18.2% turned to their family and 7.5% 
asked for help from both a doctor and their family, whilst the remaining 41.8% did not seek any help (ISS, 
2012a). The instrument used to screen for depression symptoms was the Patient Health Questionnaire-2 
(Phq-2). The purpose of the Phq-2 is not to establish a final diagnosis or to monitor the severity of 
symptoms, but rather to individuate people with probable symptoms of depression to be referred to mental 
health specialist services (Kroenke et al., 2003). Figure 2.

Accessed 06/11/2013. 40. 
The CNESPS-ISS study showed that the frequency of symptoms of depression increases with 
age, and in general women, people with a low level of education, people with lower incomes, individuals 
with no regular employment, people suffering from at least one chronic pathology (ictus, cardiovascular 
diseases, cancer, diabetes, respiratory diseases and chronic liver illness), and people living alone are more 
likely to show symptoms of depression (see Figure 3), as are Italian citizens when compared with foreign 
residents. However, it is often observed that these characteristics are correlated. A further analysis 6.6 0.0 2.0 4.0 6.0 8.0 10.0 12.0 DELSA/HEA/WD/HWP(2014)4 21 conducted by the CNESPS-ISS confirmed the association of depression with all the aforementioned 
characteristics, with the exception of age (ISS, 2012a). Figure 3.

The project PROGRES-CSM found that, in 2004, there were approximately 32 000 new cases of 
schizophrenia in Italy, representing an annual incidence of 73.6 per 100 000 population. This figure was 
calculated on 541 Community Mental Health Centres (CMHCs) and on a population of 43 539 857 
inhabitants. However, significant differences were registered across regions, with Calabria, Tuscany and 
Sicily registering a much higher incidence compared to Lazio, Liguria and Lombardia (Gonella et al., 
2008). 43. 
The project S.E.M.E. on the epidemiological surveillance of severe mental illness (Sorveglianza 
epidemiologica dei disturbi mentali gravi) (CCM, 2011) was started in May 2009 and is organised and 
managed by the National Institute of Health (Istituto Superiore Sanità – ISS). The aim of the S.E.M.E. 
project is to determine the prevalence of severe mental illness in Italy by gathering data from 
22 Community Mental Health Centres (CMHCs) (Centro Salute Mentale – CSM) across 15 regions in 
Italy. 44. 
During the first year of implementation, 17.7 individuals per 100 000 population were treated for 
a severe mental health problem within the 22 CMHCs selected. This figure, however, is likely to 
underestimate the actual prevalence of severe mental illness within the population, in that it does not take 
into account patients treated by private mental health specialists, patients hospitalised within psychiatric 
wards in general hospitals, or patients who are not receiving any treatment. Psychotic disorders, including 
schizophrenia, represent the majority of cases (40%), followed by bipolar disorder (30%), major depressive 
disorder (19%) and nervous anorexia. Data from the first year of the implementation also show that 48% of 
patients with severe mental illness have a low level of education (< 8 years of education), 48% live with 
their families, 40% are unemployed, and 87% live in very poor or modest economic conditions. The study 1 2 2 7 17 10 0

(CCM, 2011), suggesting the failure of the mental health system in Italy to promptly intervene at the first 
stages of severe mental health problems. 45. 
Studies exist on the estimation of severe mental illness also at the regional level. For instance, in 
2006 a study estimated the prevalence of severe mental health problems across 10 Departments of Mental 
Health (DMHs) in the Lombardy region, using the HoNOS (Health of the Nation Outcome Scales) to 
assess patients' mental health status. It was estimated that, within mental health services in the Lombardy 
region, there were 3.1 per 1 000 suffering from some kind of severe mental illness every year (aged over 
14) (Lora et al., 2006). Children and adolescents' mental health status 46. 
The Italian pre-adolescent mental health project (PrISMA) is a two-phase study that was 
conducted on 3 418 participants using the child behaviour checklist/6–18 (CBCL) 2 and the development 
and well-being assessment (DAWBA) 3 with the aim of estimating the prevalence of mental disorders 
among pre-adolescents living in urban areas. The results showed an overall prevalence of mental disorders 
among children and adolescents of 8.2% for the CBCL and 9.8% for the DAWBA. Internalising disorders 
(anxiety, panic, depression disorders and other inner-directed states) were significantly more frequent 
(6.5%) than externalising disorders (negative, destructive beheaviours) (1.2%). An older age, having 
repeated a grade, living with a single parent, a lower level of maternal and paternal education or lower 
socio-economic status or income were positively correlated with a higher prevalence of mental health 
problems. It is noteworthy that 80% of the participants with some kind of mental disorder, however, did 
not seek professional help (Frigerio et al., 2009), suggesting that the treatment gap is, as was the case for 
adults (De Girolamo et al., 2006), an issue of paramount importance that needs to be addressed in Italy. Elderly population mental health status 47. 
The CNESPS-ISS conducted a study on  " Mental Health and Social Seclusion across people over 
age 64 "  (ISS, 2012b). The percentage of individuals showing probable symptoms of depression is higher 
for elderly people than for adults, and the frequency of probable symptoms significantly increases with 
age. In fact, in the period between 2009 and 2010, over 20% of old people had probable symptoms of 
depression compared to 7% of adults aged 64 and younger, with an even higher rate for people 75 and over 
(25.3%) than for people between 65 and 74 (18.8%). In general, women (25.1%) are more likely to show 
probable symptoms of depression than men (22.3%) (ISS, 2012b). 48. 
Depression is highly disabling among old people, as people with probable symptoms of 
depression reported to have, in the 30 days preceding the survey, approximately 15 days with limited 
activity against 3 days reported by individuals not suffering from any depressive symptoms. Two out of 
three people sought help from the family or a doctor, whilst the remaining 33% did not. It is noteworthy 
that social seclusion is a topic of paramount importance, especially across the eldest population. Almost 
9% of the people interviewed neither participate in any collective meeting nor have any kind of contact 
with society (telephone call, meeting, etc.) during a  " normal week " . As shown in the CNESPS-ISS, 
women, people over age 75, individuals with a lower level of education and people with lower incomes 2 CBCL is a questionnaire filled out by parents designed to assess social competence and behavioural 
problems in children and adolescents aged 6-18. 3 The DAWBA explores the following psychopathological areas: separation anxiety, simple phobia, social 
phobia, panic disorder with/without agoraphobia, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), obsessive-
compulsive disorder, generalised anxiety disorder, major depression, attention deficit and hyperactivity 
disorder, beheavioural disorder, and less common disorders. DELSA/HEA/WD/HWP(2014)4 24 were more likely to be socially isolated, with subsequent concern for their health and mental health status 
(ISS, 2012b). 49. 
The results of the Health Watch Report (Rapporto Osservasalute) showed that almost 30% of 
people over age 65 were living alone in 2009, with women being significantly above the average (Sabetta, 
2012) (see Table 2). However, living alone does not necessarily mean being isolated, as it could also be a 
sign of autonomy. Table 2. Percentage of people over age 65 living alone, by region and gender, 2009 Regions

Italy has one of the lowest suicide rates within OECD countries, with 5.8 suicides per 100 000 
population in 2010 compared to an OECD average of 12.4 (see Figure 5). In line with other OECD 
countries, suicide rates are higher for men than for women (Figure 6). DELSA/HEA/WD/HWP(2014)4 25 Figure 5.

Males DELSA/HEA/WD/HWP(2014)4 26 In 2010, there were 3 048 deaths from suicide in Italy, representing 5.9 suicides per 100 000 population 
(ISTAT, 2012a). One in three people who committed suicide during 2010 were reported to be suffering 
from some kind of mental health problem (1 100 cases) (ISTAT, 2012a). The suicide rate has decreased 
considerably, from 8.3 per 100 000 population in 1993 to 5.1 per 100 000 in 2010. Southern regions (such 
as Campania, Puglia, Sicilia, and Calabria) show clearly lower suicide rates compared to the national 
average (see Figure 7). Figure 7. Suicide and suicide attempt rates per 100 000 population by region – 2010 Source: ISTAT (2012a), Suicidi in Italia: Tendenze e confronti, come usare le statistiche [Suicides in Italy: Tendencies and 
comparisons, how to use statistics], Istituto Nazionale di Statistica, Roma, 2012. 51. 
The ESEMed Study investigated suicide according to three phenomena: suicide ideation, suicide 
planning and suicide attempt. The lifetime prevalence of suicide ideation was 3%, the prevalence of 
suicide planning 0.7% and the prevalence of a suicide attempt 0.5% (De Girolamo et al., 2006a). 2.3. Other indicators 52. 
The Ministry of Health, through the Mental Health Information System (SISM), is working on 
the development of national indicators for mental health, including clinical indicators. However, at the time 
of writing clinical or outcome indicators for mental health do not exist at the national level (see 
section 3.5.). 5.9 6.5 0.0 2.0 4.0 6.0 8.0 10.0 12.0 14.0 16.0 Suicide rates per 100 000 population

The National Health Service (hereafter NHS) (Servizio Sanitario Nazionale – SSN), established 
in 1978, provides universal coverage free of charge at the point of use to all Italian citizens. Under the 
Italian Constitution, the organisation and administration of the health system in Italy is run at the national, 
regional and local levels. 54. 
At the national level, the central government is responsible for providing framework legislation 
that draws up general principles of organising, financing and monitoring the NHS. The Ministries involved 
in the provision of health care are responsible for ensuring the general principles of the national health care 
system. The central government is also responsible for setting the Essential Levels of Assistance (Livelli 
Essenziali di Assistenza – LEA), a basic health care package that must be available to all residents 
throughout the country (see section 3.5.). 55. 
The Ministry of Health is the main central institution responsible for health care planning, 
financing, and monitoring and for setting the healthcare regulatory framework. The Ministry of Health 
currently oversees three major departments: 1) the Department for the Planning and Organisation of the 
NHS, responsible for the planning of health policies dealing with the organisation of NHS services, which 
is in charge of the administration of the Italian Information System (SIS), including the Mental Health 
Information System (SISM), and for providing pharmaceuticals and medical devices; 2) the Department of 
Public Health and Innovation, in charge of safeguarding health and well-being of all Italian citizens, 
communicating with institutional and international bodies, and promoting scientific and technological 
research; 3) the Department of Veterinary Care and Food Safety, with Italy being one of the few countries 
in the world in which veterinary care is managed by the NHS (see Figure 8). However, the organisation of 
the Ministry of Health is currently under revision. DELSA/HEA/WD/HWP(2014)4 28 Figure 8. Organisational chart of the Ministry of Health The Ministry of Health Department of Public Health and

Other public bodies, including the Ministries and national institutions, also play a pivotal role 
within the health care sector. The Ministry of the Economy and Finance has a critical role in defining the 
health care budget and subsequently allocating resources across regions. The Ministry of Social Affairs is 
involved in the administration of social services provided within NHS infrastructures. The National Health 
Council (Consiglio Superiore di Sanità), established in 1847 by the Edict of Carlo Alberto, provides 
scientific and technical advice to the Ministry of Health. The Directorate General for the Coordination of 
Mental Health Consulting Bodies (Direzione generale degli organi collegiali per la tutela della salute) 
coordinates the work between the Ministry and other health care and scientific health bodies, including the 
National Institute of Health (Istituto Superiore di Sanità – ISS) and the Italian Pharmaceutical Agency 
(Agenzia Italiana del Farmaco – AIFA). The ISS, founded in 1934 and currently accountable to the 
Ministry of Health, is the main national public institution conducting technical and scientific research in 
the health field. The AIFA, founded in 2003 under the authority of the Ministry of Health and the Ministry 
of the Economy and Finance, coordinates all activities related to pharmaceuticals, including public and 
private research, production, distribution and monitoring, pricing and reimbursing policies. 57. 
The core of regulatory, planning, delivery and monitoring activity is, however, directly managed 
at the regional level. The regions have gained prominence following the adoption of legislative Decree 
No. 229/1999, which increased the legal power devolved to regional governments. In fact, under the 
umbrella of national legislation, legislative functions are left under the control of regions, which provide 
regulatory frameworks for financing, organising and monitoring the health sector. Regional governments 
are responsible for delivering a health care benefits package through a network of Local Health Authorities 
(Azienda Sanitaria Locale – ASL) as well as public and private licenced hospitals. Regional governments 
directly set the resources to be allocated across the Local Health Authorities, define their geographical 
boundaries and appoint general managers. Based on the National Health Plan and on local needs, the 
regions are also responsible for designing a three-year health plan and monitoring activities on health care 
delivery across the territory. 58. 
A range of intermediary bodies are responsible for ensuring continuous connections between the 
central Government and the regions. 59. 
The Standing Conference on the Relations between the State, the Regions and the Autonomous 
Provinces (Conferenza Stato Regioni et Unificata), established in 1988, promotes collaboration between 
the regions and the central government. Composed of the representatives of the government and the 
presidents of the regions, the Standing Conference is the major consultative body for legislative activities 
involving a regional dimension. 60. 
The National Agency for Regional Healthcare (Agenzia Nazionale per i Servizi Sanitari 
Regionali – AGENAS) plays an important role in giving technical and operational support to the Ministry 
of Health and the regions in the work to develop NHS strategies. Among other tasks, the AGENAS carries 
out monitoring of the NHS, provides evaluative analysis of the efficacy of the LEAs and makes 
recommendations for the organisation of the NHS. 3.2. Governance and organisation of the mental health system 61. 
At the local level, each Local Health Authority integrates a Department of Mental Health (DMH), 
which is in charge of mental health prevention, care and rehabilitation within defined catchment areas. 
Special focus is devoted to crisis situations and rehabilitation, although the DMHs are in fact in charge of 
the full array of mental health care provision. 62. 
The DMHs refer to a population of 150 000 inhabitants, as set in the Targeted Mental Health 
Care Plan 1998-2000 (Ministry of Health, 1998a); in 2010, there were 208 DMHs in the whole Italian DELSA/HEA/WD/HWP(2014)4 30 territory (Ministry of Health, 2011c). The DMHs embed multi-disciplinary teams composed of 
psychiatrists, psychologists, nurses, social workers, educators, occupational therapists, personnel with 
specific training therapists, personnel with specific training in psychosocial rehabilitation and secretarial 
staff. National standards for mental health staff require at least one professional per every 1 500 inhabitants 
(Ministry of Health, 1998a), and although regional differences exist, these standards are met in almost 
every Italian region. The DMHs manage a variety of inpatient and outpatient mental health services, 
including Community Mental Health Centres (CMHCs), Day Care Facilities (DCF), General Hospital 
Psychiatric Units (GHPUs), and Semi-residential and Residential Facilities (RFs) (see Figure 9). The 
Director of the DMH is responsible for coordinating the activities performed by all services belonging to 
the DMH's network. @BULLET Community mental health centre – CMHCs (Centro di Salute Mentale – CSM). In charge of 
planning and coordinating interventions, this service is accessible to patients, even without a 
general practitioner's referral, at least 12 hours a day from Monday to Friday and half a day on 
Saturday. The CMHC evaluates demand from patients and can thus direct them to appropriate 
mental health services or provide direct intervention. It also arranges domiciliary visits and is 
involved in consultation–liaison interventions at the local level (see section 4.1.). @BULLET General Hospital Psychiatric Units (GHPUs) – Servizi Psichiatrici di Diagnosi Cura (SPDC). 
Located in hospitals that have an emergency department, this service is in charge of short-term 
crisis interventions and eventually refers patients to the CMHC for outpatient care and other 
interventions. Patients are admitted either on a voluntary basis or under CTOs. National standards 
require that a maximum of 1 bed per 10 000 inhabitants is provided (Ministry of Health, 1998a), 
and each GHPU provides a maximum of 16 psychiatric beds (for CTO rates, see section 1.2.i; for 
further information on GHPUs, see section 4.1.). @BULLET Semi-residential facilities – Day-centres and Day hospitals (Centri Diurni e Day-Hospital). These 
facilities have therapeutic and rehabilitative functions, with programmes promoting self-care, 
everyday-life activities and individual or collective interpersonal relations in day centres. The day 
centres are open at least eight hours a day six days a week and have their own medical team, 
sometimes complemented by social workers and volunteers. Day centres can be managed either 
by the Department of Mental Health or by private partners, in which case conventions with the 
Department of Mental Health guarantee the continuity of care. The main goal of Day Hospitals is 
to reduce the number and length of hospitalisations by providing comprehensive diagnostic 
evaluations and health interventions in the short and medium term. Day Hospitals can be located 
within the hospital or in external structures linked with the Department of Mental Health (see 
section 4.1.). @BULLET Residential facilities – RFs (Strutture residenziali). RFs are separate from hospital facilities and 
are in charge of part of the therapeutic-rehabilitative programme for patients with strictly 
psychiatric needs. These rehabilitative programmes are conceived to help people utilising local 
resources in order to better integrate into the community. In this respect, residential facilities 
must not constitute a long-term housing solution. By law, they must comprise a specific number 
of beds linked to the intensity of care – but not more than 20 – and must be located in easily 
accessible urban areas in order to avoid social isolation (see section 4.1.). 63. 
Together with the aforementioned mental health services provided through DMHs, there are 
other mental health facilities that collaborate with the DMHs but are not directly dependent on them. These 
include Psychiatric Clinics attached to universities (Cliniche Psichiatriche Universitarie) and psychiatric 
wards in general hospitals, which both provide mental health inpatient services. DELSA/HEA/WD/HWP(2014)4 31 Figure 9. Organisation of secondary mental health care 3.3. Current mental health strategy and recent mental health policy 64. 
The last national mental health plan was released in January 2013 – The Italian Mental Health 
Action Plan (IMHAP) (Linee di Azioni Nazionale per la Salute Mentale) (Ministry of Health, 2013). The 
IMHAP identifies four priority areas, including: early intervention, mild to moderate mental illness, severe 
mental illness and children and adolescents mental health. In order to deal with these priorities 
successfully, a set of strategies and a variety of relevant indicators has been developed. For each priority 
area, the IMHAP identifies the key objectives to be achieved, the related actions to be undertaken, the 
evaluation tools to be used, as well as a set of indicators for monitoring whether the objectives are being 
met (Ministry of Health, 2013). Department of

Despite the recommendations of the 2008 National Strategic Plan for Mental Health (Linee di 
indirizzo nazionali per la salute mentale) (Ministry of Health, 2008a), children's mental health services 
differ substantially across regions in terms of the quality and quantity of facilities. Besides the need to 
develop a uniform provision of children's mental health services across the territory, there is also the need 
for better integration of the services, especially between children's and adults' mental health services. 
Adult mental health priorities include: early interventions, mild to moderate and severe mental illnesses, 
suicide prevention and the fight against stigma (Ministry of Health, 2013). 3.4. Mental health strategic initiatives Stigma campaign National initiatives 66. 
The Italian Ministry of Health has conducted several anti-stigma campaigns in order to draw 
attention to mental health care. The first one, in 2005, focused on the exclusion of people suffering from 
mental illnesses and aimed at fighting stigma attached to mental illnesses with slogans such as  " He's not 
different than you. Mental illness can be cured "  ( " Non è diverso da te. Curare i disturbi mentali si può. " ) 
and  " No prejudice, no exclusion "  ( " Nessun pregiudizio, nessuna esclusione " ), featured in a television spot. 
Family/users associations played a major role in this first campaign, with each segment of the 
communication programme being devolved to them under general supervision by the Italian Ministry of 
Health: the television spot was managed by the UNASAM; the national day for mental health and several 
other events around the country were hosted by the Idea foundation (Fondazione Idea); the informative 
brochures were encharged to the Diapsigra association, and a website www.fuoridallombra.it was created 
by the Arap association. 67. 
The second stigma campaign on mental health –  " Mental health disorders can be cured: more 
information, less discrimination "  (I disturbi mentali si possono curare: più informazione meno 
discriminazione) – was conducted on April 2006 with the aim of fighting discrimination against people 
suffering from mental illness and informing the youth about mental health issues. In order to do this, the 
campaign was managed jointly by the Italian Ministry of Health and the Italian Ministry of Education, as 
well as by universities. The campaign's main objectives were to: @BULLET Stimulate creativity by allowing students and university staff to participate in the making of the 
campaign; @BULLET Encourage interest about mental health in schools and in education programmes; @BULLET Increase knowledge about and an understanding of mental illness and how it can be treated and 
cured; @BULLET Promote initiatives to improve behaviour towards mental illness; @BULLET Promote specific actions in order to prevent and fight discrimination and prejudice in targeted 
social groups. 68. 
The tools used to realise the 2006 campaign against stigma included the publication of an 
informative brochure in the widely circulated newspaper La Repubblica and the distribution of the 
campaign message across major websites specifically addressed to young people through internet banners. DELSA/HEA/WD/HWP(2014)4 33 69. 
Apart from national initiatives against stigma, the core stigma campaigns in Italy have taken 
place at the regional and local levels. To quote but a few, The  " Regional Network of Mental Health Users 
of Tuscany "  ( " Rete Regionale Toscana Utenti Salute Mentale " ) (for further information on the Regional 
Network in the Toscana region, see section 3.6.), or Mental Health Week in Emilia Romagna, promoted by 
the Local Health Authority of Reggio Emilia in collaboration with the municipality of Reggio Emilia, is 
now in its 7 th edition. During Mental Health Week, debates and lectures are organised and movies and 
books on mental health are presented. The events are attended by  " sane "  individuals as well as people with 
mental disorders who have an opportunity to share their experiences and participate in the public debate. Regional and local best practices Box 3. Stories of recovery (Storie di guarigione) The literary competition  " Stories of Recovery "  (Storie di Guarigione) has been organised in Biella (Piemonte 
region) through the involvement of all the local institutions and the local groups active in the promotion of mental health 
and well-being. Two outstanding artists in Italy (the poet Alda Merini – with a personal history of schizophrenia – and 
Michelangelo Pistoletto – painter and sculptor) accepted to serve as Presidents of the Jury. The competition was 
dedicated to Emanuele Lomonaco, head of the Mental Health Department in Biella, who promoted the competition and 
died of heart failure during the early development phases of this initiative. All the Community Mental Health Centres (CMHCs) in Italy, along with all the local groups already involved in 
editing or publishing poems or tales written by users or ex-users, were invited to participate in the literary competition. 
A web campaign was developed to promote the initiative. The organising committee received more than 550 
contributions (poems, tales or autobiographies) from all Italian regions. The Jury selected nine winners, who were all 
invited to the closing ceremony in the main theatre in Biella. All the winners received a financial reward and their 
manuscripts were published in the book La scrittura della guarigione [Writing the Recovery] (Storie di guarigione, 
2009). Most of the funds raised to carry out the initiative came from local institutions and foundations. The estimated 
direct cost (excluding personnel in the local institutions) of the initiative was EUR 35 000. This initiative promoted the participation of all the family and user organisations in Italy, raised awareness on 
recovery issues among mental health professionals, and gave a voice to mental health services users, offering them 
an opportunity to write their personal stories. The initiative received formal acknowledgements by the President of the 
Italian Republic, who awarded the programme with a silver medal for its high social value. Also, the Italian Ministry of 
Health and Ministry of Culture as well as a variety of sectors within the regional administration in Piemonte formally 
supported the initiative. (For further information, see www.provincia.biella.it/docCatPolitichesociali.407.201.25.2.2.html). DELSA/HEA/WD/HWP(2014)4 34 Box 4. Stigma across medical professionals Stigma and discrimination towards individuals suffering from mental health problems is also present among 
medical professionals (Sartorius, 2002; Magliano et al., 2004). This is of particular importance, considering that mental 
illness is often associated with cancer and cardiovascular and metabolic diseases (WFMH, 2010). Several authors 
pointed out that the care needs of patients with mental illness are not always taken seriously. There is a general 
tendency among medical professionals to associate patients' physical complaint with their mental health problems, to 
underestimate the severity of their symptoms and suspect that they are imaginary. When admitted to a hospital 
department for a physical illness, these patients are treated with disrespect by professionals, wait longer for a 
specialist consultation and are soon transferred to a psychiatric unit (Aydin et al., 2003). This situation negatively 
influences the quality and appropriateness of medical care provided to patients with mental disorders and makes it 
more difficult for these patients to talk about their own physical problems with medical staff. For the above-mentioned reasons, exploring beliefs about mental illness among medical professionals is 
important in order to devise strategies for modifying prejudices and discriminating behaviours toward persons with 
mental illness. A study was conducted in 2010 in order to examine the beliefs of medical students about the causes of 
schizophrenia and the possibility of treatment and recovery. The study was carried out during the period April-June 
2010 on 194 medical students attending the last two years (5th and 6th) of their training course at the Second 
University of Naples and was supported by all the professors involved in lessons in the reference period. Attitudes 
were assessed by using a validated questionnaire (Magliano et al., 2011; Magliano et al., 2012). The results showed that 159 students (82%) identified schizophrenia in the case-vignette. As for the causes of 
the case-vignette disorder, the students most frequently cited heredity (81%), stress (69%), psychological trauma 
(45%) and misuse of street drugs (44%). Heredity was considered the most important and the most frequent cause of 
the case-vignette condition by 53% and 33% of the respondents, respectively. Only 24% of respondents firmly believed 
that persons with the considered disorder could completely recover in the future. At the same time, 73% of 
respondents said that it was completely or partially true that individuals with the case-vignette condition were 
dangerous and 86% that they were unpredictable. Moreover, 57% firmly believed that people are frightened by 
persons with this disorder and 56% stated that people don't know how to behave with them, nor understand the 
difficulties experienced by these patients (Magliano et al., 2011; Magliano et al., 2012). These findings clearly suggest that stigma is present among the  " future doctors "  as it is in the general population. 
As a consequence, tailored measures are currently being implemented in order to respond to this situation, i.e.  " ad-
hoc "  lessons on recovery and prejudices towards persons with mental disorders, especially schizophrenia, have been 
planned, involving both medical students and professors from several physical and surgical disciplines; a participatory 
research group of students from different medical disciplines has been created and trained to devise peer-to-peer 
strategies to raise awareness among students about stigma in mental illness. DELSA/HEA/WD/HWP(2014)4 35 Box 5. C'era una volta la città dei matti  " C'era una volta la città dei matti "  ( " Once upon a time there was the town of fools " ) is a movie directed by Marco 
Turco, which was broadcast by the Italian national public broadcasting organisation (RAI) and watched by over 
7 million people. The movie is based on the true story of Franco Basaglia and his experience in two mental hospitals, 
Gorizia and Trieste, where the process of closing all the mental hospitals in Italy began. The object of the movie is to 
provide an overview of the changing approach towards mental illness that eventually led to the approval of Law 180 in 
1978. The Department of Mental Health in Trieste consulted on the preparation of the script by defining the historical 
context and assessing the scientific contents of the movie. The movie is currently available with English subtitles, and it 
has already won 3 international Prizes (Shanghai, Monte Carlo and Rome Film Festivals) for its ability to address the 
issues of stigma and prejudice. The movie triggered a public debate on stigma, inclusion and the rights of people with mental illness, e.g. it has 
been used by WHO Offices, Italian Institutes of Culture and other countries to promote the debate on de-
institutionalisation. Mental Health in the workplace 70. 
Pro.P – Programme for the reintegration into the workplace of people suffering from mental 
health disorders – was launched in 2006 with the aim of facilitating the integration of mentally disordered 
people into the labour market. The programme was started by the ISFOL (Institute for the development of 
Vocational Training – Istituto per lo sviluppo della formazione professionale dei lavoratori) and supported 
by the Ministry of Labour and Social Policies. Since its establishment, the programme has implemented a 
vast range of activities, including: the establishment of institutional networks within regions; training 
programmes for operators within regional mental health facilities; integration plans for mentally disordered 
people into the labour market; and the development of a comprehensive information system. Whilst some 
regions – Lazio, Piemonte, Puglia, Toscana and Umbria – were part of the programme since its inception, 
other regions have joined later, such as Veneto, Campania and Sardegna in 2010, Marche in 2011 and 
Molise in 2012. 71. 
However, it is worth saying that programmes aiming to include mental health disordered people 
in the workplace are routinely performed by CMHCs, whilst Pro.P is only a research project aimed at 
optimising and improving these activities. 3.5. Monitoring and good practice guidelines in the health and mental health services 72. 
The current Italian mental health system is not so easy to fully evaluate and monitor, since 
provision of care is presently delegated to regions and Local Health Authorities that operate in an 
autonomous way under national  " framework legislation " . Nevertheless, in recent years, monitoring has 
been reaffirmed as a crucial objective by the Italian Ministry of Health. Information systems and registers 73. 
The Targeted Mental Health Care Plan 1998-2000 required that each Department of Mental 
Health (DMH) in Italy provides an information system to gather data on mental health prevalence and the 
services provided (Ministry of Health, 1998a). The 1999 Decree (D. L. 229/99) also required that regions 
have health information systems. DELSA/HEA/WD/HWP(2014)4 36 74. 
A thorough information system was recently developed to improve the monitoring of health 
services in Italy: in this respect, the National Health Information System (Sistema Informativo Sanitario -
SIS) developed by the Ministry of Health is currently in charge of collecting aggregated data and 
information on services on a yearly basis. An additional recent promising tool for monitoring mental health 
services is the National Mental Health Information System (Sistema Informativo Salute Mentale -SISM), 
which is based on individual user's records. The SISM has been officially approved through a National 
Decree in October 2010 and is being implemented in all Italian regions, some of which already have prior 
experience of gathering aggregated information concerning mental health. The SISM is designed primarily 
to guarantee the Essential Levels of Assistance and provides information on services, personnel and some 
characteristics of clients and treatments. Moreover, the SISM is moving towards the establishment of a set 
of national mental health indicators, including clinical indicators. 75. 
However, at the time of writing there are different stages of development of regional mental 
health information systems, with information systems in some regions – such as Piemonte, Lombardia, 
Lazio, Emilia-Romagna and Toscana – being relatively more developed than other regions. For instance, in 
some southern regions, not all DMHs provide a mental health information system, as set by the current 
legislation. Because the development of a mental health information system is not expensive per se, the 
obstacles to implementation should be sought in the differing cultural environments across regions rather 
than in the existence of economic constraints. Outcomes and indicators 76. 
Given that there are different stages of development of regional mental health information 
systems, and that some regions are unable to provide good mental health data, there are currently not many 
mental health indicators available at the national level, whilst mental health indicators at a regional and 
local level are more available (see Box 6). 77. 
Some information on the prevalence of mental ill health as well as the performance of mental 
health facilities at the national level is being provided by studies conducted by the National Institute of 
Health (ISS, 2012a; ISS, 2012b; ISS, 2012c), the National Centre for Prevention and Control of Diseases 
(CCM, 2011) and other international studies, e.g. the EseMED study (De Girolamo et al., 2006a). 
Moreover, Italy has experience of routine outcome measurements that have used the Health of the Nation 
Outcome Scales (HoNOS) at the national level, involving about twenty DMHs in Italy, e.g. in the 
Lombardy region, Tuscany, Liguria and Lazio. The results of the last two studies, covering 2009-2010 and 
2010-2011, will be published in the near future. 78. 
In recent years, regional efforts have been undertaken to obviate the dearth of mental health 
indicators at the national level. Regions such as Piemonte, Lombardia, Lazio, Emilia-Romagna and 
Toscana, which are endowed with a qualitative mental health information system, have been able to 
provide evidence-based reports on the state of mental health in the population and on the quality of 
services provided (Tibaldi et al., 2008; Gaddini et al., 2008; Lora, 2006; Bignami et al., 2008; Lora & 
Monzani, 2013). Some regions have developed a set of clinical indicators for mental health. For instance, 
the Italian Society of Psychiatric Epidemiology (Società Italiana di Epidemiologia Psichiatrica – SIEP), 
has developed a set of clinical indicators for schizophrenia, depression and bipolar disorders in the 
Lombardy region. The indicators were defined based on available data from a vast range of information 
systems in Lombardy, including pharmaceutical indicators, the general health care system and the 
psychiatric information system (Lora & Monzani, 2013). The Lombardy region has relatively more 
sophisticated information systems than other Italian regions, so while other regions may not yet be in a 
position to replicate this study, it is hoped that the presentation of the results will at least provide an 
impetus for them to do so in the not too distant future. DELSA/HEA/WD/HWP(2014)4 37 Essential Levels of Assistance (Livelli Essenziali di Assistenza – LEA) 79. 
Following the release of the Prime Ministerial Decree of 29 November 2001 (Decreto del 
Presidente del Consiglio dei Ministri), the Government established Essential Levels of Assistance (Livelli 
Essenziali di Assistenza – LEA), defined as services and facilities that the NHS is responsible for ensuring, 
free or with users' co-payments, to all Italian citizens. 80. 
The implementation of LEAs has led to the reinforcement of a  " target culture "  and the setting of 
health-related performance indicators in Italy. Monitoring the levels of assistance reflects the performance 
of all health care providers regarding the quality, appropriateness and cost-effectiveness of care. In 2008, 
further legislation redefined the LEAs, which now include over 5 700 types of public health services for 
prevention, treatment and rehabilitation. Chapter IV, Art. 25, 26, 32 of the LEAs directly refers to mental 
health. Particular focus is given to mental health community-based services and to children's and 
adolescents' mental health care. 81. 
Besides their standard-setting functions, LEAs are also a monitoring tool that is used both to 
measure the performance of the health services and to efficiently allocate resources across regions. The 
Standing Conference between State and Regions of March 2005 gave powers to the LEA Committee to 
verify whether the regions are complying with their obligations to deliver the Essential Levels of 
Assistance (LEAs) to their inhabitants. In order to do this, the LEA Committee developed the  " LEAs grid " , 
a set of indicators that assign a score to each of the LEAs delivered across regions. For each indicator, an 
optimal and a minimal value is set, and the more the value moves away from the optimal value, the lower 
the score given to the service. The LEAs grid allows decision-makers to make comparisons between 
regions by giving a broad picture of the strengths and weaknesses of each region in delivering the LEAs. 82. 
The last evaluation of LEAs was released in 2012 (Ministry of Health, 2012a), with indicators 
based on data collected in 2010. At the time of writing there is only one indicator designed to capture the 
delivery of LEAs for mental health, although the set of indicators is revised annually and might change in 
the near future. The mental health indicator is designed to capture the activities of the CMHCs and is 
defined as  " the number of patients per 100 000 population taken over by Community Mental Health 
Centres " . The optimal level includes values equal or superior to 1 000, whilst values equal or inferior to 
500 are deemed inadequate (see Figure 10). With this design, however, the mental health indicator is 
unlikely to describe the quantity or the quality of mental health services provision, in that it does not take 
into consideration epidemiological and demographic differences across regions and does not give any 
indication about the quality of the services provided and the clinical results achieved. DELSA/HEA/WD/HWP(2014)4 38 Figure 10. Number of patients per 100 000 population taken over by Community Mental Health Centres by

Psychiatry (DoP) of the University of Verona. Since 1987, the DoP of Verona and the CSP of South Verona have 
functioned as the Collaborating Centre for Research and Training in Mental Health of the WHO. In the 30 years since its establishment, the CSP has been providing a comprehensive range of services, 
including a Community Mental Health Centre, a psychiatric ward located in the Academic general hospital, today with 
15 beds, an outpatient service, an emergency service, home visits and the Service of Psychosomatics and Clinical 
Psychology and the Service of Psychotherapy (an outpatient and a home service, respectively). The CSP of South 
Verona is totally funded and run by the NHS. Starting as a long-term research project for monitoring and evaluating the new system of care established after 
the implementation of Law 180, the CSP managed to couple innovative psychiatric care with scientific research and 
academic education. One of the major peculiarities of the academic community-based mental health service is the 
paramount importance given to monitoring and evaluation, making the CSP of South Verona one of the most 
intensively evaluated mental health services in the world. The CSP also represents the major centre for psychiatric 
research in Italy, including research on epidemiological and social psychiatry, economics and geography of mental 
health studies, genetics and neuroimaging of schizophrenic and bipolar disorders, clinical psychopharmacology, 
communication in medicine and evaluation of mental health services. The CPS has conducted a large number of 
research studies, including work on the following areas: @BULLET Service costs associated with clinical, social and service history variables; @BULLET The effects of ssocioeconomic status (SES), accessibility and geographic distance from mental health services on the use of community-based psychiatric services; @BULLET Predictions about patient drop-out from mental health care; @BULLET Differences in the mortality of psychiatric patients between areas with a community-based system and the general population; @BULLET The South Verona Outcome Project (SVOP) – an outcome evaluation of mental health care provided by the South Verona CSP; @BULLET Predictions of clinical and social outcomes of patients in touch with community-based services; @BULLET Predictions of the changing needs of psychiatric care; 0 1000 2000 3000

and service intervention indicators). After the adoption of Law 180, the CSP of South Verona experienced a shift from institutionalisation towards 
community-based mental health services. From 1979 to 2007, data show that hospital inpatient health care has 
dramatically decreased in favour of increasing outpatient and community care, home visits, number of day care 
contacts, attendance at the day hospital and number of days in sheltered accommodation run by the CPS (see 
Figure 11). In fact, from 1977 to 2007, there was a decrease of 6% in inpatient admissions, with a 69% fall in 
compulsory admissions. The mean number of occupied beds fell significantly to 72%, mainly due to the closure of state 
mental health hospitals (Amaddeo et al., 2009). Figure 11. Patterns of care (ratios per 1000 adult South Verona residents) – 1979-2007 Source: Amaddeo, F., L. Burti, M. Ruggeri and M. Tansella (2009),  " Long-term monitoring and evaluation of a new system of

Sanità 2009| Vol. 45, No. 1: 43-53, Italy. Health and mental health research 83. 
Health research is an important focus for the Italian Ministry of Health: the first Conference on 
Health Research was held in Cernobbio in November 2010 and represents a first step in a long-lasting 
process. The conference aimed at encouraging networking and collaboration between all of Italy's research 
bodies and at promoting the work of the Italian Health Research Network, an agency that is designed to 
connect Italian researchers working abroad with researchers working in Italy. 84. 
Italian agencies involved with health (and mental health) research in Italy include the Italian 
Ministry of Health, the Italian National Institute for Health (Istituto Superiore di Sanità – ISS), the local 
Scientific Institutes for Admission and Care (Istituti di Ricovero e Cura a Carattere Scientifico – IRCCS 4 ), 
the National Research Council (Consiglio Nazionale di Ricerca – CNR), the universities, and the 4 The IRCCS are top research hospitals (16 public hospitals and 16 private ones) funded by and under the

(Commissione Nazionale per la Ricerca Sanitaria) is in charge of drafting and elaborating research 
projects and guidelines for national scientific and sanitary research as well as suggesting research topics to 
international and European research programmes. The National Centre for Disease Prevention and Control 
(Centro Nazionale per la Prevenzione e il Controllo delle Malattie – CCM) has also implemented several 
research projects concerning mental health (for further information on research activities undertaken by the 
CCM, see http://www.ccm-network.it/en_what_is_CCM). Both the National Commission for Health 
Research and the CCM are national bodies directly attached to the Ministry of Health. 85. 
Italy's participation in the international epidemiological survey conducted by the WHO in 2001-
2002 among six countries (Italy, France, Germany, Belgium, Spain and the Netherlands) demonstrates the 
country's significant contribution to mental health research. The ESEMeD study has in fact provided 
invaluable information on mental illness prevalence, the utilisation of mental health services and 
pharmaceutical use. 86. 
From a domestic point of view, in 2003 the Italian Ministry of Health also implemented a 
National plan to encourage the regions and autonomous provinces to implement projects for prevention in 
mental health: from December 2005 to June 2006, the Ministry of Health held several seminars to present 
the results of these projects for each theme. National guidelines Guidelines for Early Intervention for Schizophrenia (Linee Guida: Gli interventi precoci nella 
schizofrenia) (2007) 87. 
Following evidence that reducing the duration of untreated psychosis is related to a more benign 
disease course, in 2007 the National System for Guidelines (Il Sistema nazionale delle Linee Guida – 
SNLG) of the National Institute of Health (Istituto superiore di Sanità – ISS) issued the Early Intervention 
for Schizophrenia Guidelines (Linee Guida – Gli interventi precoci nella schizofrenia) (SNLG, 2007), 
whose aim is to provide a set of directives giving support to all occupational groups engaged in providing 
assistance to these patients. National Guidelines for Mental Health (Linee Guida per la Salute Mentale) (2008) 88. 
The 2008 National Guidelines for Mental Health reaffirmed the necessity to enforce the effective 
integration of people suffering from mental illness into the employment market through the concerted 
action of all Departments of Mental Health. DMHs should in this respect be in charge of ongoing 
professional training, assistance in the search and obtaining of a job opportunity, promotion of social firms 
and social cooperatives as well as innovative social projects involving e.g. microcredit (Ministry of Health, 
2008b). DELSA/HEA/WD/HWP(2014)4 41 Autism spectrum disorder guidelines 89. 
Albeit autism falls beyond the scope of this analysis, it has gained growing interest from policy-
makers over the past decade in Italy. A national guideline – Treatment guidelines for the autism spectrum 
disorder (ASD) in children and adolescents (Il trattamento dei disturbi dello spettro autistico nei bambini e 
negli adolescenti) (SNLG, 2011) – was recently published, with the aim of providing direction on the use 
of evidence-based treatments and defining best practices for appropriate interventions with children and 
adolescents (0-18 years old) suffering from developmental disorders, including autism. 3.6. User involvement: consumer associations, family associations and other NGOs 90. 
National legislation highlights the importance of citizens' involvement in the decision-making 
process and promotes the establishment of consumer and family associations. The 1978 law establishing 
the NHS, for instance, promoted community involvement in the decision-making process. At the regional 
level, Local Health Authorities have established a complaint system for citizens to make complaints and 
suggestions and thus to participate in improving the health system. Following legislation in 1995, all public 
and most private health care providers are obliged to release an annual Health Service Chart (Carta dei 
Servizi), which is designed to inform the public about waiting times, complaint systems and quality 
indicators. In addition, in 2003 further legislation required that all public administration institutions, 
including health care institutions, establish an Office for Public Relations (Ufficio Relazioni con il 
Pubblico (URP)) to provide information to the public and monitoring the quality of services from the 
users' point of view. Although national legislation has highlighted the importance of citizens' involvement 
in the decision-making process and encouraged the establishment of consumer associations, each region 
has reacted differently to these directives (Lo Scalzo et al., 2009). 91. 
With respect to mental health, human rights for people suffering from mental disorders were a 
central issue addressed by Law 180, as previous legislation had implied that a person committed to an 
asylum would automatically have their civil and political rights suspended and could be permanently 
committed against their will without judicial consent and generally not allowed to leave the mental 
hospital. However, there is currently no public body in Italy, whether national or regional, in charge of 
monitoring and assessing the human rights protection of patients in mental health services. This task has 
been progressively devolved to patient and family associations, which have in fact always collaborated 
with the Italian Ministry of Health. 5 92. 
Italy has several national and regional user/consumer and family associations spread out across 
the country. Some of them have been active since the 1960s, although most started to become more 
involved in the 1980s, after Law 180 was promoted. Over 150 of these associations have gathered since 
1993 under the umbrella of the Italian National Union of Associations for Mental Health (Unione 
Nazionale delle Associazioni per la Salute Mentale, UNASAM), which now stands as the main 
association/federation of families concerned with mental health issues. The UNASAM aims to promote 
and defend the rights of mentally ill people by getting involved in policy-making and the 
legislative/regulation process on the local, regional and national levels. The federation was in fact actively 
involved in developing the two National Plans for Mental Health and contributed to the organisation of the 5 The Ministry of Health's website lists the following associations: Psicologi-Psicoterapeuti, Psichiatria 
Democratica (PD) , Unione Nazionale delle Associazioni per la Salute Mentale (UNASAM), Associazione 
Difesa Ammalati Psichici Gravi (DIAPSIGRA), Associazione Riforma Assistenza Psichiatrica (ARAP), 
Associazione Italiana Tutela Salute Mentale (AITSAM), Fondazione IDEA , Fondazione Italiana per il 
Volontariato (FIVOL), Caritas Italiana, Comunità di S. Egidio, Comunità di Capodarco, Lega italiana

(WPA), Forum della Salute Mentale. DELSA/HEA/WD/HWP(2014)4 42 first Government Conference on mental health in 2001. Another goal of the association is to connect the 
families of people suffering from mental disorders and get them involved in regular events hosted by the 
association in collaboration with the mental health services. It also works to eliminate prejudice and stigma 
about mental illness by informing the general public (Muggia, 2009) through active participation in broad 
communication campaigns, as with the Ministry of Health campaign on mental health in 2005. One of the 
main points made by the UNASAM in its 2010 address is that involuntary admissions, when they are 
accompanied by excessive restraint and a  " closed-doors "  policy, constitute an infringement of a patient's 
human rights, especially when these measures are met with accidental death as has been reported in 
Sardegna, Puglia, Campania and Emilia-Romagna 6 in recent years. In addition to being present in all 20 
Italian regions, the UNASAM is also on the board of international associations such as the European 
Association of Families of Mentally Ill People (EUFAMI) and the World Association for Psychosocial 
Rehabilitation (WAPR) (Muggia, 2009). 93. 
In addition to collaborating with the associations, the Italian Ministry of Health has also worked 
in close interaction with the Council of Europe in order to issue the Council's recommendations 7 for the 
protection of the human rights and dignity of people with mental disorders (adopted by the Committee of 
Ministers on 22 September 2004 at the 896 th meeting of the Ministers' deputies). 94. 
Associations of users/consumers are also developing in several regions. Among them, the 
 " Regional Network of Mental Health Users of Tuscany "  (Rete Regionale Toscana Utenti Salute Mentale) 
(hereafter the Regional Network) stands, since its establishment in 2006, as one of the most active 
associations on mental health issues, including patients' rights and the social exclusion of people suffering 
from mental disorders (the link to the website is http://www.retetoscanausm.org/sito/). 95. 
All activities undertaken by the Regional network have been developed in the different Provinces 
of the region, with the general aim of creating a network of support and exchanges among patients. The 
Regional Network is part of the Regional and National Councils and as such takes part in the definition of 
strategies and policies at both the regional and national levels. 96. 
So far the Regional Network's programme has led to a structured activity aimed at combating 
stigma by helping the population to recognise the dignity of persons with mental problems. The promotion 
of rights and citizenship has been pursued by favouring the search for jobs (patient cooperatives are now 
active in the labour market), by supporting housing (many independent group-apartments have been 
created) and by advocating patients' right to an education and to create their own families. The experience 
is being repeated in other Italian regions (i.e. Liguria), and some projects are moving towards a European 
dimension (i.e. the sports programme in Livorno has started to set up a European network). 6 In this respect, the case of Franco Mastrogiovanni (which received significant media coverage), a Sicilian 
teacher who died in a psychiatric inpatient ward after being constrained for 4 days in August 2009, is 
especially emblematic of the human rights issues raised by the UNASAM. 7 The Council of Europe's recommendations concerning the protection of the human rights and dignity of 
people with mental disorders, and its explanatory memorandum (2004). DELSA/HEA/WD/HWP(2014)4 43 4. ORGANISATION AND DELIVERY OF SERVICES 97. 
The level of use of mental health services by people with mental disorders is relatively low in 
Italy. According to Wang et al. (2007), half of the people suffering from a severe mental illness, a quarter 
of those suffering from moderate disorders and a fifth of those with mild disorders used the health services. 98. 
Another study conducted in three Italian regions (Friuli Venezia Giulia, Emilia Romagna and 
Lombardia) showed that the estimated treatment gap – the percentage of people needing treatment but not 
receiving it – accounted for 79% for mood disorders, whilst a lower rate (57%) was recorded for 
schizophrenia (Lora, 2009). 4.1. Adult mental health Primary care General Practitioners (GPs) 99. 
Primary care in Italy is of paramount importance for mental health care, especially for the 
treatment of patients with mild to moderate mental health problems. Usually General Practitioners directly 
treat symptoms of depression and anxiety, whilst patients with severe mental health disorders are generally 
treated by secondary care. Unlike in other health care systems, in Italy GPs do not act as gatekeepers to 
secondary care, as there is open access to all levels of care (primary, secondary and tertiary care) (WHO, 
2011). For instance, Community Mental Health Centres, which represent the core of intervention planning 
in the Department of Mental Health, are freely accessible to patients without the necessity of being referred 
first. It was found in the WHO ESEMeD study (2001-2002) that 38% of the people who have had contact 
with the NHS for mild to moderate mental health symptoms consulted their GP, while 21% consulted a 
psychiatrist, 6% consulted a psychologist and 28% consulted a GP and a mental health professional jointly 
(De Girolamo et al., 2006a). These figures give evidence of the importance of GPs in treating mental 
illness, as over half of contacts about mental issues were made with a GP. This in part results from the fact 
that current legislation in Italy allows GPs to prescribe psychotherapeutic medicines (WHO, 2011). Italy is 
among the OECD countries with the lowest rates of GPs per population: in 2011, there were 45 878 
General Practitioners, i.e. 0.76 per 100 000 population. This figure has decreased slightly over the last 15 
years, as there were 47 157 GPs in 1995 (0.83 rate per 100 000 population) (OECD health database 2013). 100. 
Recently, Law 189/2012, approved on 8 November 2012, set out  " urgent measures to promote 
the development of the country through a better health care system " . The Law defines precise guidelines 
on the work of GPs and their relations with secondary care services. Italian GPs do not work in group 
practices or in looser networks, but generally practice individually. However, the importance of integration 
between the general practitioner and mental health services was acknowledged in Italy with the 
implementation of several pilot experiments, leading to the adoption of a primary care consultation-liaison 
model in 1999 that was first tested in the city of Bologna (Emilia-Romagna) (see Box 7). DELSA/HEA/WD/HWP(2014)4 44 Box 7. Mental health and primary care: the  " Leggieri "  programme – Emilia Romagna The programme  " G. Leggieri "  was first implemented in a Community Mental Health Centre (CMHC) in Bologna 
(Emilia Romagna) in 1999, and in 2002 the service was implemented in the metropolitan area. The model aims 
primarily at building cooperation between GPs and a dedicated team of consultant psychiatrists, resident psychiatrists, 
psychologists and nurses; improving the quality of treatment of all mental health problems; and modifying the pathways 
of care, by treating mild to moderate mental health problems in primary care and severe mental health problems in 
secondary care. The consultation-liaison system was designed as a  " go-between "  for general practitioners and mental health 
services and often takes place in CMHCs. According to the  " stepped care "  model adopted by the Leggieri programme, 
three different approaches could be implemented, depending on the severity of the case. Individuals with mild mental 
health problems are directly treated by GPs. People with moderate mental health problems are treated by GPs in 
conjunction with the support of CMHCs, which provide either a simple consultation or suggest a treatment. People with 
severe mental illness are treated by CMHCs, and there is a follow-up consultation with patients by GPs after the 
treatment is finished (Menchetti et al., 2006). In order to monitor the outcomes of the programme on Local Health Authorities in the Emilia-Romagna region, a 
questionnaire is regularly submitted to all Local Health Authorities across the region. The latest results show that the 
number of GPs in contact with CMHCs has increased steadily from 2009 to 2011 by 16% (Regione Emilia-Romagna, 
2012). Secondary care 101. 
Secondary care in Italy is of crucial importance for the treatment of people suffering from some 
kind of mental disorder, especially severe mental health problems. Individuals can access secondary care 
(both inpatient and outpatient) services without a referral from a GP. Since the approval of Law 180, 
inpatient mental health services have been gradually replaced by outpatient mental health facilities, in line 
with the decade-long process of de-institutionalisation and the closure of all mental hospitals. 102. 
Following the closure of all mental hospitals in Italy, the core of inpatient mental health services 
is currently provided by residential facilities, psychiatric wards in general hospitals, Psychiatric Clinics 
attached to universities (Cliniche Psichiatriche Universitarie) and General Hospital Psychiatric Units. 
Among outpatient facilities there are Community Mental Health Centres and Semi-residential facilities. Outpatient care Community Mental Health Centre (CMHCs) – Centro di Salute Mentale (CSM) 103. 
Community Mental Health Centres (CMHCs) represent the core of outpatient interventions and 
are primarily responsible for planning and coordination. In 2009, there were 1 387 CMHCs in Italy, a rate 
of 4.17 per 150 000 population (over 18) (Ministry of Health, 2011c). However the variability from one 
region to another is sometimes very significant (for instance, Valle d'Aosta has 11.27 CMHCs per 150 000 
population, whereas Molise has only 1.11 per 150 000 population) (see Table 3). 104. 
During the years 2005-2006, a national survey including 20 of 21 regions (except Molise) and 
covering 211 Departments of Mental Health and 707 CMHCs (about 95% of existing CMHCs) was 
conducted with the aim of evaluating the compliance of CMHCs with the national standards set within the 
Targeted Mental Health Care Plan 1998-2000 (Gonella et al., 2008; Munizza et al., 2011; Ministry of 
Health, 1998a). The 2005-2006 PROG-CSM survey found that the proportion of female users in CMHCs 
amounted to 57% in the considered sample. Diagnoses of users of CMHCs included: psychotic disorders 
such as schizophrenic disorders (about 29% of sample), mood disorders (25% of sample), anxiety disorders 
(22.5% of sample) and other disorders (23.5%). For the new cases treated by CMHCs: psychotic disorders DELSA/HEA/WD/HWP(2014)4 45 amounted to 14% of the sample, mood disorders 20%, and anxiety disorders and other disorders were each 
about 26%. 25% of treatments, such as home visits and intervention in the community, took place outside 
the CMHCs. 105. 
Contacts with CMHCs (especially integration and care continuity) and with other Department of 
Mental Health services were satisfactory for about 69% of the facilities, while they were considered 
inadequate in about 10% of CMHCs. With respect to follow-up community care, the study showed that 
about 37% of the CMHCs in the considered sample were involved in developing high-quality programmes 
focusing on continuity and care coordination for severe mental disorders. Tthese programmes included, for 
instance, intensive home care and drop-out prevention programmes. However, promotion and prevention 
programmes remained quite absent from most CMHCs, as only 18% had developed such programmes to a 
satisfactory level (Gonella et al., 2008). Table 3. CMHCs per 150 000 population, number of DMHs and number of DMH users, by region Region Community Mental Health

Overall, inpatient mental health activities have decreased over the past decade, in line with the 
parallel increase in outpatient mental health services. Within inpatient mental health care, the number of 
public psychiatric beds has dropped steadily since 1975, along with the number of admissions and the 
average length of stay for all diagnosis groups. The situation of Residential Facilities (RFs) is significantly 
different. The number of RFs and RF psychiatric beds has increased over time, parallel to a decrease in 
assistance days per user, with subsequent concern about the quality of mental health care being delivered 
within these facilities. Moreover, the average length of stay is particularly high in RFs, which too often 
provide assistance with daily activities rather than therapeutic support. General Hospital Psychiatric Units (GHPUs) – Servizi Psichiatrici di Diagnosi Cura (SPDC) 109. 
The PROGRES-Acute Project conducted by the ISS evaluated the network of acute mental health 
inpatient facilities in all regions (except Sicily) during the period 2002-2003. Psychiatric beds were located 
in GHPUs (88%), and Psychiatric Clinics attached to universities (Cliniche Psichiatriche Universitarie) 
(10%) and Day Hospitals (2%) (De Girolamo et al., 2007b). 110. 
With a rate of 1.08 total psychiatric beds 8 per 10 000 inhabitants (over 18) (0.97 public and 0.11 
private accredited beds), the availability of public acute beds in Italy was slightly above the national 
standards in 2009 (1 bed per 10 000 population) (Ministry of Health, 2011c) (See Table 4). 8 Private psychiatric beds are not included. Private accredited beds – which are considered as public beds –

Parallel to the increase in community-based mental health services, the number of psychiatric 
beds in Italy has dramatically decreased over the last 35 years (see Figure 14), in line with the decrease in 
the overall number of hospital beds (OECD health database 2013). Figure 14. Number of psychiatric beds per 1 000 population – Italy 1975-2011 Source: OECD health database, [Online] Available http://stats.oecd.org/ Accessed 06/11/2013. 112. 
The decrease in the number of psychiatric beds in Italy is in line with the decrease in the number

The unplanned re-admission rate is an indicator measuring the quality of inpatient mental health 
services, in that it captures the percentage of people who are re-hospitalised within 30 days of discharge. 
The OECD is currently using this mental health indicator for schizophrenia and bipolar disorders to make 
comparisons across countries. Data show that, compared to other OECD countries, Italy is faring well for 
both schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, with a rate below the OECD average. However, differences exist 
across regions, as shown in Figures 18 and 19 (Ministry of Health, 2011b). Figure 18. Unplanned schizophrenia re-admission rate* (same hospital) (out of total schizophrenia discharges)

Parallel to the decrease in the number of psychiatric beds in inpatient facilities, the number of 
residential facilities has increased from 1 577 in 2007 to 1 679 in 2009, along with an increase in the 
number of psychiatric beds in RFs (passing from 15 351 in 2005 to 19 299 in 2009). However, the number 
of assistance days per user has decreased by 16% in RFs from 2005 to 2009 (see Figure 20) (Ministry of 
Health, 2011c). Figure 20. Number of assistance days per user and psychiatric beds provided in RFs, 2005-2009 Source: Ministry of Health (2011c), Relazione sullo stato sanitario del paese 2009-2010 [Report on the health status of the country 
2009-2010], Ministry of Health, Directorate General for health information, communication technology and statistics, 2011. 116. 
The overall number of Residential Facilities is much higher compared to the number of Semi-
residential facilities in Italy. This might be due to the fact that the core of outpatient services is provided by 
CMHCs. However, the overall number of users is higher in Semi-residential facilities compared to RFs, 
and this is due to the nature of the services provided (outpatient and inpatient respectively) (Ministry of 
Health, 2011c). Significant differences exist across regions in terms of the number of assistance days per 
user provided, with 91 days per user in Emilia Romagna compared to 312 days in Puglia within RFs and 
26 days per user in Calabria compared to 333 in Molise within Semi-residential Facilities (Ministry of 
Health 2011c) (see Table 5). 15,351 16,760

In 2000, a broad national survey – the PROGRES study – conducted by the Italian National 
Institute of Health (ISS) investigated the network of RFs in Italy. During phase 2 of the study, data was 
gathered on 267 facilities accommodating 3 005 patients in 20 out of 21 regions (except Molise). 
According to the second phase, 36.8% of patients residing at the time in the sample RFs were female 
(Munizza et al., 2011). 118. 
RFs accommodate patients mostly for long-term stays: 35% of patients residing in RFs were 
there for the past 3 years or more and 75% had no formal limitation on the length of their stay. Resident 
turnover is particularly low, with few new admissions and fewer discharges (on the sample considered for 
phase 2, 25% of RFs hadn't discharged any patient in 2000 and 25% discharged only 1 to 2 patients in 
2000) (Munizza et al., 2011). As a result, for many chronic patients RFs represent a permanent home 
( " home for life " ) instead of a temporary housing solution. This feature sometimes makes it difficult to 
assess the transition from old-style mental institutions to residential mental health facilities, although there 
has been substantial change in the background culture, the reduced number of patients and the type of care 
provided. Complementary/alternative/traditional practitioners 119. 
Most of the complementary/alternative/traditional practitioners contacted by people suffering 
from a mental illness in Italy are religious officials. Religion, a traditional source of relief from pain and 
distress, is an important feature in the lives of many Italians, fewer than 15% of whom declare being 
agnostic or atheist (ARDA, 2013). Italy appears to be the most religious country in the WHO ESEMeD 
study, with religious advisors being the most involved in providing help for mental health issues. The use 
of religious advisors indicates both the preeminent role of religion in Italy and a certain reluctance to label 
one's issues as mental problems. According to the ESEMeD study, during the year preceding the survey DELSA/HEA/WD/HWP(2014)4 55 0.4% of respondents had contacted a religious advisor to help with psychological distress (this figure is 
equal to that of France and Belgium). Among people seeking help with a mental health problem, 3.6% 
addressed religious advisers exclusively, while 5.5% used both religious and formal help (De Girolamo et 
al., 2006a). 120. 
For a practical example of the organisation of the adult mental health system, see Box 8. Box 8. Organisation of mental health services in the city of Trieste The organisation of psychiatric services in the city of Trieste (201 814 inhabitants) has beentransformed since 
1971, following the activities of Franco Basaglia and his team and resulted in the closure of the San Giovanni 
psychiatric hospital in 1980 along with the setting up of a network of community-based services. This model of 
community-based mental health services has been implemented acrossthe whole Region Friuli Venezia Giulia (1 217 
864 population) as a regional model, focussed on  " strong "  comprehensive 24 hour Community Mental Health Centres, 
equippedto respondto the most severe conditions and psychiatric episodes and to support clients in their ordinary life in 
a view of recovery and social inclusion. Recognised as an experimental pilot area of mental health de-
institutionalisation by the WHO in 1974 (Babini, 2009), considered as an example of proven success in 2001 (WHO, 
2001), the DMH of Trieste has been first appointed Collaborating Centre by the WHO in 1987 and most recently it was 
designated the WHO Lead Collaborating Centre for Service Development in the framework of WHO-Euro Helsinki 
Declaration and Action Plan in 2005 (Rosen et al., 2012). Currently the Department of Mental Health (DMH) in Trieste manages four Community Mental Health Centres 
(CMHCs) – open 24 hours/7 days a week and provided with 4-8 beds each – each competent for a catchment area of 
approximately 60 000 inhabitant. Started with the aim of reducing psychiatric hospital admissions and promoting 
rehabilitation and social re-integration, the four CMHCs provide the core of mental health services in Trieste. The 
General Hospital Psychiatric Unit (GHPU) provides inpatient mental health services, but its 6 beds are mainly used as a 
filter for emergency situations at night, and normally do not admit patients for more than 24 hours. Instead, patients are 
referred to the CMHC of the area where they live or to other appropriate services as soon as possible. In addition to the 
four CMHCs and the GHPU, the DMH also includes a rehabilitation and residential support service, where there are 
about 45 beds in group-homes and supported housing schemes whose main aim is to encourage users to move from 
living together towards an individual home with the required daily support. In addition, there is a network of 15 social 
cooperatives and also associations encompassing carers and users as well as other lay people involved. Available indicators suggest that Trieste is delivering effective care that contributes to good patient outcomes. 
Compulsory Treatment Orders (CTOs) discharge rates in the Region Friuli Venezia Giulia are one of the lowest in Italy, 
with 5 cases per 100 000 population per year compared to a national average of 17 (see Figure 1) (Ministry of Health, 
2011b). Moreover, two thirds of people under the CTOs were treated within CMHCs rather than in inpatient facilities in 
2005 in Trieste (Mezzina & Johnsons, 2008). Suicide rates have decreased from 25 to 11 per 100 000 in the city of 
Trieste over the last 15 years, possibly as a result of a proactive preventionprogramme (Dell'Acqua et al, 2003).Mental 
health services in Trieste do not make use of restraint measures, such as locked doors and mechanical restraint 
(Rosen et al., 2012; De Girolamo, et al 2007). 160 clients per year receive a personal budget in order to fulfil the aims of a joint and shared plan of recovery in 
the areas of housing, work and social relationships. This represented about 18% of the overall budget of the DMH in 
2011, while about 4% is devoted to economic aid, training grants, leisure and projects with NGOs (extra-clinical 
activities) (see Table 6). About 180 people are in professional training every year on work grants, and 20-25 of these 
find paid employments each year in the Trieste job market, many in the field of social cooperation and about a third in 
private firms. The remaining budget was spent on personnel (about 55%), health budget (more than 17%) and 
pharmaceuticals (almost 6% of total expenditures) in 2011 (Mezzina R., in Fioritti & Amaddeo, forthcoming). Table 6. Cost of mental health care by sector, Trieste, 2011 Sector

Infant Neuropsychiatry Services (Servizi di Neuropsichiatria Infantile) are today the core of 
young people's mental health care in Italy, although these facilities are reported to have significant 
limitations in terms of management, finance and human resources. According to the Targeted Mental 
Health Care Plan 1998-2000, the Departments of Mental Health (DMHs) should also integrate the care of 
child/adolescent mental health in the Infant Neuropsychiatry Services (Ministry of Health, 1998a). 
However, not all Local Health Authorities have put their DMHs in charge of child/adolescent mental 
health, and some have devolved this mission to maternal/infant care departments and others have yet to 
present a comprehensive plan for taking care of child and adolescent mental health. 122. 
In 2007, the Italian Child and Adolescent Neuropsychiatry Association (Società Italiana di 
Neuropsichiatria dell'Infanzia e dell'Adolescenza – SINPIA) ran a national survey in all Italian regions to 
gauge the state of mental health services for children and adolescents (Nardocci, 2009). The outcome 
showed the inappropriateness of child and adolescent mental health services provision, in that only 
12 regions out of 20 have established formal neuropsychiatry services, of which 8 have a clear 
denomination, 7 have a specific strategic plan for their catchment area and only 3 have a fixed 
organisational structure. Moreover, management responsibilities are in most regions ambiguous: in 
4 regions neuropsychiatry services merge with Departments of Mental Health, in 4 regions they merge 
with Mother/Infant Departments and in the remaining 12 regions they are managed by a variety of services 
(Nardocci, 2009). 123. 
The current deficiencies in the provision of mental health services for the youngest population 
groups have historical roots. Law 180 disregarded child and adolescent mental health care. For instance, on 
31 December 1960 there were 310 326 children hospitalised in isolated institutions (ISTAT, 1963): 
112 956 in orphanages; 87 594 in  " institutes for poor and abandoned children " ; 61 402 in permanent 
colonies, i.e.  " institutes that accommodate lymphatic, anemic and TBC prone children, etc. " ; 18 464 in 
institutes for  " other categories of patients " ; 10 081 in institutes for  " mentally disabled people " ; 8 699 in the 
new orphanages for  " internal upbringing " ; 7 624 in institutes for the  " sensory impaired " ; and 3 506 in 
institutes for the  " physically impaired " . Running in parallel with these institutions was a system of special 
schools and  " different "  classes for socially deprived children and children with medium intellect or 
language deficiencies (ISTAT, 1963). Following a variety of well-documented scandals in child and 
adolescent mental health institutions, Law 104 on the rights of disabled people, including children and 
adolescents, was approved in 1992. Although most regions have fully implemented Law 104, some are still 
lagging (Nardocci, 2009). 124. 
The draft National Health Plan 2011-2013, along with the most recent Italian Mental Health 
Action Plan, highlighted the unsatisfactory state of the provision of child and adolescent mental health 
services in Italy and called for an integrated and coordinated response at the national, regional and local 
levels. In particular, there is the need to: establish a comprehensive monitoring system for child and 
adolescent mental health; reorganise neuropsychiatric services in a homogeneous and efficient way 
throughout Italy; encourage early intervention on the onset of the mental health illness; and facilitate 
cooperation and coordination between mental health services and pediatric services, schools, community 
social services and commissioned private health services (Ministry of Health, 2011a; Ministry of Health, 
2013). 125. 
Although falling beyond the scope of this paper, recent strategies are being promoted to provide 
policy direction in the field of autism disorders, e.g. the  " Action Plan for the improvement and promotion 
of qualitative and appropriate interventions in developmental disorders, with a particular reference to 
autism disorders "  (Linee di indirizzo per la promozione ed il miglioramento della qualità e DELSA/HEA/WD/HWP(2014)4 57 dell'appropriatezza degli interventi assistenziali nel settore dei Disturbi pervasivi dello sviluppo, con 
particolare riferimento ai disturbi dello spettro autistico) (Ministry of Health, 2012b). 4.3. Forensic mental health 126. 
Since the mid-1970s,  " Judiciary Psychiatric Hospitals "  (Ospedali Psichiatrici Giudiziari – OPG, 
forensic inpatient units) have replaced the former criminal asylums in Italy. Despite the aim of Law 
Basaglia to close all former mental hospitals in 1978, the protection and health care of mentally disordered 
offenders was disregarded by Law 180. As a consequence, forensic inpatient units established in 1975 were 
kept open and remained more or less unchanged. There are currently 6 forensic inpatient units in Italy: the 
Judiciary Psychiatric Hospital of Barcellona Pozzo di Gotto (Sicilia); the Judiciary Psychiatric Hospital of 
Reggio Emilia (Emilia Romagna); the Judiciary Psychiatric Hospital of Montelupo Fiorentino (Toscana); 
the Judiciary Psychiatric Hospital of Castiglione delle Stiviere (Lombardia); the Judiciary Psychiatric 
Hospital of Napoli (Campania) and the Judiciary Psychiatric Hospital of Aversa (Campania). Due to the 
implementation of Law 9 (see below) and the current process of closure of all OPGs, the number of 
inmates decreased from 1 378 in July 2011 to 972 in June 2012, and the figure is continuing to fall. 127. 
The Italian Penal Code (hereafter p.c.) is a binary code, requiring detention for  " sane "  offenders 
and security measures for mentally disabled people. As established by Art. 88 and 89 p.c., offenders are 
not criminally liable if, at the moment of the offence, they were not capable of  " understanding and intent "  
(capacità di intendere e di volere) because of mental impairment. Inmates who experienced mental health 
impairment during the execution of the sentence (Art. 148 p.c.), people with a severe mental handicap 
(Art. 111 D.P.R. 230/2000) and people with partial mental disorder (Art. 219) are also eligible for being 
detained in an OPG, upon verification that they are socially dangerous (Art. 203 p.c.). Under Art. 222 p.c., 
security measures consist in at least 2, 5 or 10 years detention in Judiciary Psychiatric Hospitals 
(depending on the severity of the crime committed), after which, under Art. 208 p.c., the patient is subject 
to re-examination of his/her social dangerousness by the surveillance judge, rather than being 
automatically discharged after the sentence is served, as is the case for sane inmates. 128. 
As of July 2011, the legal status of patients was as follows: 534 patients declared criminally 
irresponsible and involuntarily placed in an OPG under section 222 of the Penal Code; 338 patients whose 
provisional placement in an OPG had been ordered under section 206 of the Penal Code (Temporary 
Security Measures); 68 sentenced prisoners requiring psychiatric care placed in the OPG under section 148 
of the Penal Code; 364 patients declared partially criminally irresponsible and placed in a  " care and 
detention centre "  (Casa di Cura e Custodia) under section 219 of the Penal Code; and 45 patients declared 
mentally handicapped under section 111 c5 DPR 230/00 of the Penal Code (see Figure 21). DELSA/HEA/WD/HWP(2014)4 58 Figure 21.

Formerly linked to the Penitentiary Administration, the Italian forensic inpatient units were put 
under the responsibility of the Ministry of Health by Prime Ministerial Decree/2008 (Ministry of Health & 
Ministry of Justice, 2008a). More precisely, Prime Ministerial Decree/2008, which took effect on 14 June 
2008, entrusted the regions and Local Health Authorities with health care responsibilities over prisons, 
juvenile justice services, as well as the OPGs (Ministry of Health & Ministry of Justice, 2008a). The 
 " Guidelines for the operations of the NHS to protect the health of detainees and inmates in prisons and 
minors subjected to penal measures "  (Linee di indirizzo per gli interventi del Servizio sanitario nazionale a 
tutela della salute dei detenuti e degli internati negli istituti penitenziari, e dei minorenni sottoposti a 
provvedimento penale) (Ministry of Health & Ministry of Justice, 2008a) and the  " Guidelines for the 
interventions in Judicial Psychiatric Hospitals and Care Homes "  (Linee di indirizzo per gli interventi negli 
Ospedali Psichiatrici Giudiziari e nelle case di cura e custodia) (Ministry of Health & Ministry of Justice, 
2008b) were approved as a complement to Prime Ministerial Decree/2008. The former identifies optimal 
paths for the prevention and treatment of mentally disordered offenders, in order to achieve the LEAs; the 
latter is a programmatic document that defines a three-phase process for the harmonisation of safety and 
sanitary requirements within OPGs (Ministry of Health & Ministry of Justice, 2008b). Nevertheless, the 
implementation of Prime Ministerial Decree/2008 was disregarded by the Sicily region, which has not 
transferred health competencies to the NHS for the administration of the Psychiatric Hospital of Barcellona 
Pozzo di Gotto. 130. 
The National Strategic Plan for Mental Health (Ministry of Health, 2008a) mentioned forensic 
inpatient units as one of the elements in mental health services that required special attention. In this 
respect the National Strategic Plan for Mental Health suggested that: 3% 38% 5% 25% 27% 2% Mental Handicap -Art 111 c5 DPR

219 Others DELSA/HEA/WD/HWP(2014)4 59 @BULLET People admitted in OPGs (especially people acquitted with total/partial mental disorder) should

the NHS services, especially mental health services; @BULLET Inmates should be taken care of from their first admission to an OPG from the perspective of 
managing their rehabilitation and social reintegration, with active collaboration with the 
concerned Departments of Mental Health; @BULLET The discharge of inmates who have come to the end of their security measure should be planned 
with the concerned regions and local actors in order to ensure effective social inclusion; @BULLET All necessary actions must be taken on a regional level to enforce alternative projects to the 
admission in OPGs through the continuity of the relationship between the Departments of Mental 
Health and the Courts of Justice; @BULLET Inmates formerly sent to penitentiary facilities before being admitted to OPGs should reintegrate 
their former facilities with a guarantee that all health interventions and rehabilitative programmes 
would be performed in the penal institutions. 131. 
In 2010, the European Council for the Prevention of Torture (CPT) published a Report 
summarising the outcomes of the inspections conducted into some security facilities in Italy, including 
prisons, mental health wards within general hospitals and OPGs (Council of Europe, 2010). The Council 
visited the OPG of Aversa and concluded that  " [t]he gravity of the situation observed at the Aversa OPG 
calls for a more determined response from the Italian authorities, preferably at national level "  (Council of 
Europe, 2010:62). Other visits into OPGs were conducted in 1992, 1996 and 2000 and reported more or 
less the same situation. 132. 
Under Art. 82 of the Italian Constitution, a Parliamentary Commission of Inquiry into the 
efficacy and the efficiency of the National Health Service (Commissione Parlamentare di Inchiesta 
sull'efficacia e l'efficienza del Servizio Sanitario Nazionale) (hereafter the  " Commission " ), was set up in 
2008 to monitor the quality of both public and private health services provided in the whole territory and to 
control the actual implementation of health policies, thus providing the Parliament and the Public 
Administration with comprehensive indications on the state of health services provision in Italy. The 
Commission was composed of 20 senators and 1 President and holds, for the entire period of the legislature 
(5 years), the same powers and limitations conferred on the legal authorities. Following the above-
mentioned recommendations of the National Strategic Plan for Mental Health (Ministry of Health, 2008a), 
part of the work undertaken by the Commission was devoted to the investigation of the operation of Italy's 
OPGs. The Commission organised regular unannounced on-the-spot inspections during the years 2008-
2011 into each of the 6 OPGs and carried out interviews with OPG directors and with consumer 
associations (such as Psychiatric Democracy – Democrazia Psichiatrica and StopOPG). 133. 
The outcome of the investigation revealed the inadequacy of primary and secondary health care 
provision in all OPGs, with the exception of the Judiciary Psychiatric Hospital of Castiglione delle 
Stiviere, and in particular:  " severe and unacceptable "  hygienic and sanitary conditions, with a structural 
setting more similar to prisons than average psychiatric services provided in Italy; health and social care 
personnel shortages; and inadequate clinical treatments, including improper use of physical and 
pharmacological restraint. In some extreme cases, the rooms/cells were overcrowded (some even had bunk 
beds, contrary to the prison authorities' guidelines); for half of the structures, the number of inmates 
exceeded the facility's regulatory capacity, whilst in one case the number of inmates exceeded the 
structure's tolerated capacity (see Figure 22); the management of cleaning services was unclear and 
remained undelivered or left to patients; insufficient basic primary health care and specialist mental health DELSA/HEA/WD/HWP(2014)4 60 care was provided, with significant staff shortages of physicians and nurses and a complete absence of 
psychiatrists and/or psychologists; the use of drugs was not duly certified or appropriately recorded, with 
evident breaches of current legislation (art. 60 e ss. del D.P.R. 309/199); and brutal restraint measures, 
besides being contrary to Art. 32 of the Italian Constitution –  " the law can in no case violate the limits 
imposed by respect for the human person "  – were not regularly reported in the patient's clinical diary 
(Italian Parliament, 2011). Figure 22. Regulatory capacity, tolerated capacity and actual presence of inmates in the 6 OPGs – July 2011 Source: Italian Parliament (2011), Revisione sulle condizioni di vita e di cura all'interno degli Ospedali Psichiatrici Giudiziari [Review

Italian Parliament, Senate, 2011. 134. 
Following the inspections, in July 2011 the Commission published an evidence-based  " Review of 
life conditions and health care standards within OPGs "  (Revisione sulle condizioni di vita e di cura 
all'interno degli Ospedali Psichiatrici Giudiziari) (Italian Parliament, 2011). In addition to encouraging 
the actual transfer of responsibilities from the penitentiary administration to the NHS in the Psychiatric 
Hospital of Barcellona Pozzo di Gotto (Sicily) as required by Prime Ministerial Decree/2008, the review 
provided a number of recommendations for the renewal of mental health legislation and the subsequent 
overrun of the OPG model. @BULLET Specific legislation on mentally disordered offenders should be approved as a complement to 
Law 180. The new model should couple mental health treatment with adequate security 
measures. @BULLET The Departments of Mental Health (DMH) should be directly responsible for taking charge of 
mentally disordered offenders. The new model should be based on the provision of evidence-
based mental health treatment used as a form of health care, rather than restraint and control 
measures used as a form of punishment. For this to happen, additional resources should be 
allocated to DMHs. With these financial and human resources, the DMHs should provide 
mentally disordered offenders with small therapeutic communities (maximum 20 hosts) across a 
range of security levels in the whole territory. 0 100 200 300 400 500 600 Regulatory Capacity Tolerated Capacity Actual Presence DELSA/HEA/WD/HWP(2014)4 61 @BULLET In order to avoid the perpetual extension of temporary security measures, which in some cases 
results in the so-called  " ergastolo bianco "  9 , the Penal Code should be substantially modified. In 
this respect, the length of security measures should be clearly defined when the sentence is 
pronounced, as is the case in Spain. This is in line with the broader idea that the length of the 
detention period within an OPG should not exceed the penalty provided in prison for the same 
violation. A valuable alternative to this proposal would be to ensure that the level of social 
danger posed by inmates is established by an adequate psychiatric medical board, rather than by 
the surveillance judge. @BULLET Going even beyond the scope and legal powers of the Commission, the Review suggests that the 
actual duality of the Penal Code, adopting distinct custodial measures with respect to sane and 
insane patients, should be replaced by a univocal approach. 135. 
Other concrete actions were undertaken between 2009 and 2011 in Italy to overrun OPGs, 
through the establishment of National Committees (Tavolo di Consultazione permanente sull'attuazione 
del DPCM 1 aprile 2008 and the Comitato Paritetico per le problematiche degli Ospedali psichiatrici 
giudiziari). 136. 
Legislation was approved in February 2012 (Law 9) by the Italian Government, according to 
which all OPGs should be closed by 31 March 2013. Law 9 also required that, following the closure of the 
OPGs, people who are no longer considered to be socially dangerous should be taken over by Departments 
of Mental Health, whilst other patients are integrated into new security mental health facilities of smaller 
size (20 hosts). The Ministry of Health established a working group with the aim of defining the structural, 
technological and organisational requirements for the construction of the new secure mental health 
facilities. Suggested by the aforementioned National Committees and approved by the Parliament, further 
legislation settled that: @BULLET The new structures should be differentiated by the severity of the pathology; @BULLET The new facilities should be publicly owned, in virtue of the fact that in Italy the execution of a 
penal sentence is under the responsibility of the public administration; @BULLET The new services should host a maximum of 20 inmates. 137. 
In order for the legislation to be implemented in a timely way, the Italian Government earmarked 
funding totalling EUR 272 million, with EUR 174 million for the construction of new infrastructures 
destined to host socially dangerous OPG inmates and the remaining EUR 38 million for 2012 and 
EUR 55 million for 2013 to be allocated to regions and provinces for running and managing activities. 138. 
Due to the impossibility of creating alternative mental health infrastructures on time, the closure 
of the OPGs was postponed to spring 2015. 4.4. Minority and excluded groups Elderly population 139. 
Due to a low fertility rate and high life expectancy at birth, Italy has the highest ratio of elderly 
people to the total population of any country in Europe and comes second country in the world after Japan 9 Ergastolo Bianco, literally  " white life sentence " . It is the situation under which security measures are 
continuously extended up until the point that detained people are in security facilities for their entire lives. DELSA/HEA/WD/HWP(2014)4 62 (Altis, 2013). People aged 65 and over represented approximately 20% of the total population in 2009, 
with the 65-74 age group representing 10% and those over 75 another 10% of the ratio (Sabetta, 2012). 140. 
The prevalence of depression among older people (over 64) is higher compared to adults 
(18-64 years). Between 2009 and 2010, over 20% of the elderly were suffering from depression, compared 
to 7% of adults in general, with a higher rate for people over 75 (25.3%) than for people from 65 to 74 
(18.8%) (ISS, 2012b) (for further information see section 2 on prevalence). 141. 
Mental health services for people aged above 64 are not differentiated from adult mental health 
services, so that services described in section 4.1 are also available to older people. 142. 
The Italian Psychogeriatrics Society (Società Italiana di Psicogeriatria, AIP) is a non-profit 
organisation aiming to tackle mental health problems among the eldest population. The AIP promotes 
training programmes among medical (GPs and psychiatrists) and non-medical (nurses, psychologists) 
personnel; promotes and undertakes research studies; organises national conferences and meetings and 
promotes the dissemination of knowledge through magazines, books, newspapers and its website 
(http://www.psicogeriatria.it/home/); helps in developing programmes and policies for the improvement of 
the mental health status of the eldest population; and provides consultancy to both private and public 
organisations. Migrant population 143. 
From 2002 to 2011, approximately 3.5 million foreigners immigrated into Italy, a rise from 200 
000 in 2002 to more than 500 000 in 2007 and 300 000 in 2012 (ISTAT, 2012b). Since February 2011, an 
increasing number of people from North Africa migrated to Italy following the Arab Spring. Differences in 
immigration rates exist across regions, with northern and central regions – Lombardy (80 000) Lazio 
(47 000), Emilia-Romagna (35 000) and Veneto (32 000) – having a higher number of foreign immigrants 
compared to other regions (ISTAT, 2012b). These figures do not take into account all the  " irregular "  
immigrants who do not have permission to stay in the territory. It was estimated that 150 000 irregular 
immigrants were living in the Lombardy region in 2009 (Civenti et al., 2012). 144. 
The mental health agenda in Italy is giving increasing importance to the recent intensification of 
migration flows and the significant increase of immigrant populations residing in the territory. 
Multiculturalism is a key point of the National Strategic Plans for Mental Health, with the policy document 
emphasising the importance of integrating linguistic/cultural mediation in the range of services provided by 
mental health facilities (Ministry of Health, 2008a). 145. 
Today, access to health care services for irregular immigrants is incomplete and uncertain, 
whereas regular immigrants have the same rights to access health services as citizens. Nonetheless, the 
latter do not benefit from the services in the same way as citizens do, a phenomenon that in the literature is 
called the  " implementation deficit " . This is mainly due to the characteristics of the services (community 
services, as opposed to hospitals), the stigma related to the utilisation of mental health facilities and the 
absence of multicultural specialistis able to decode mental health symptoms while taking into account 
cultural differences (Civenti et al., 2012). 146. 
Regional programmes have been implemented in recent years to gauge the state of mental health 
among immigrants in Italy and to adapt mental health facilities to provide services more suited to this 
population group. A concrete instance of this process is the project on  " Migration and psychiatric disorders 
in child, adolescent and adult mental health "  (Migrazione e disagio psichico nell'età evolutiva e verso l'età 
adulta), which was developed and implemented in 2007 in the Lombardy region following evidence that 
over the past years child and adolescent immigrants accessed mental health services twice as much as DELSA/HEA/WD/HWP(2014)4 63 Italian citizens, that they dropped out from mental health services very frequently and that they dropped 
out of school three times as frequently as Italian children and adolescents. As mentioned above, the 
Lombardy region has the highest number of immigrants of any region, and this holds for young immigrants 
as well. In Milan, for instance, 20% of all adolescents have a history of migration (e.g. immigrant minors 
without their parents, first-and second-generation immigrants). 147. 
The project  " Migration and psychiatric disorders in child, adolescent and adult mental health "  
aims at improving mental health services for the immigrant population through a variety of different 
activities, including the following: linking mental health services with other services, i.e. schools, in order 
to ensure prompt intervention in the early stages of mental health disorders; providing qualitative and 
pertinent hospitalisations for immigrants (both in mental health and other health sectors); providing 
prompt, cross-cultural responses, through the development of multicultural teams within mental health 
services, as well as the provision of informative brochures in different languages; providing mental health 
services for immigrant offenders suffering from mental health problems; and linking child and adolescent 
mental health services with adult mental health services in order to guarantee the continuity of mental 
health assistance. Moreover, since 2010 mental health services in the Lombardy region have organised an 
ad hoc information system in order to gather epidemiological data from immigrants who access mental 
health services for the first time. 148. 
Running in parallel with the regional initiatives is a national discussion among experts, including 
mental health experts, on the topic of migration. The National Focal Point Italian Infectious Diseases and 
Migrant (NFP) is a network of experts in the field of infectious diseases within the migrant population. The 
working groups were established in 1997 in the context of the  " AIDS & Mobility "  project and today are 
coordinated by the National Institute of Health (ISS). During the XI Conference, which took place in 2012, 
the NFP focused on the correlation between mental health, culture and infectious diseases within the 
immigrant population in Italy. The Conference concluded that mental health control could have a positive 
effect on infectious disease control within the immigrant population (ISS, 2012c). Post-earthquake organisation and delivery of mental health services in L'Aquila 149. 
On 6 April 2009, an earthquake (6.3 Mw) hit the city of L'Aquila (Abruzzo) – in central Italy – a 
town with 72 000 inhabitants and a health district of 105 000 residents. The earthquake caused the death of 
309 people, with more than 1 600 individuals injured, among whom 200 were severely injured and 
hospitalised and 66 000 displaced. Approximately 44 000 found an accommodation in tented camps close 
to their place of residence, and a further 20 000 were housed in hotels on the Abruzzo Adriatic Sea coast. 
Others stayed with friends and relatives throughout Italy (Casacchia et al., 2012). 150. 
Natural disasters like earthquakes are traumatic events that can cause severe psychological 
distress. A study was conducted between April 2009 and January 2010 among 187 young people seeking 
help at the Service for Monitoring and early Intervention against psychological and mental suffering in 
young people (SMILE) at the L'Aquila University Psychiatric Department. The aim was to evaluate the 
presence of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) in the sample. 44.2% and 37.4% respectively showed 
high and moderate levels of psychological distress. 66.7% reported the presence of a significant post-
traumatic symptom (Post-traumatic Syndrome), while a diagnosis of PTSD was made in 13.8% of the 
sample (Pollice et al., 2010). This is in line with other studies showing that natural disasters produce high 
psychological distress. A study assessing the prevalence of Acute Stress Disorder (ASD) among 
individuals seeking help at the General Hospital Psychiatric Unit of the San Salvatore Hospital following 
the earthquake showed that, despite the high level of psychological distress (GHQ-12 ≥20, cut-off value) 
found in 65.6% of the subjects, only 6 subjects (4.9%) could be considered affected by  " full "  ASD, 
whereas 48 subjects (39.3%) could be considered affected by  " partial "  ASD (Casacchia et al., 2013). A 
study conducted on some 1 078 young adults (mean age 21.4 ± 5.6) to assess mental health status and the DELSA/HEA/WD/HWP(2014)4 64 increase in substance use (tobacco, alcohol and cannabis) after the earthquake, showed that 314 people 
(29.1% of the sample) had an ICD-10 diagnosis of anxiety disorders (43%), mood disorders (34%), PTSD 
(16%) and psychosis (7%). 57% of these 314 people increased their consumption of alcohol, 41% of 
tobacco and 22% of cannabis (Pollice et al., 2011a). Another study gave evidence of a significant increase 
of first episode psychosis (FEP) after the earthquake (Pollice et al., 2011b). 151. 
The project Programma di Supporto Psicosociale Emergenza Sisma (SPES) (Psychosocial 
Support and Earthquake Emergency) was establish to give mental health support to people seeking help 
after the earthquake in L'Aquila. Approved on May 2009 and granted by the Italian Ministry of Health, the 
project was carried out in a tent. SPES currently includes three main areas of intervention: (1) assessment 
of the earthquake's impact on the general population; (2) cooperation with GPs i.e. training of GPs in the 
identification and psychological management of traumatic events; (3) support of secondary mental health 
services in the region, such as training in Evidence-Based Medicine (EBM) and treatments for PTSD. After 
the earthquake, it was hypothesised that most residents had found a way to recover through  " writing and 
telling the story " . As a consequence, a large number of materials (books, web-blogs, videos) were 
produced by residents and a database of memories was implemented. Many collective demonstrations were 
organised and showed the will to actively participate in the process of reconstructing the civil and scientific 
life of the town (Casacchia et al., 2012). 4.5. Human resources and training Psychiatrists 152. 
In Italy there were 18 per 100 000 population, placing Italy slightly above the OECD average 
(see Figure23). Figure 23. Psychiatrists per 100 000 population in OECD countries, 2011 (or nearest year available) Source: OECD health database, [Online] Available http://stats.oecd.org/ Accessed 18/03/2013. 153. 
Medical students can become psychiatrists after obtaining their medical degree (5-year 
programme, with a special focus on communication skills, role-playing and empirical know-how since 
1996) by completing a 4-year postgraduate training in a university or in mental health services under 18

Mexico DELSA/HEA/WD/HWP(2014)4 65 proper agreement with a school of psychiatry. The training specifically requires that aspiring psychiatrists 
treat at least 80 patients; provide psychotherapy to at least 20 patients under supervision; give 
psychometric tests to at least 40 patients; take part in at least 10 rehabilitation programmes and 5 controlled 
clinical trials on psychotropics; give at least 20 psychiatric consultations; be on call 50 times; and become 
familiar with forensic psychiatry. 154. 
Guidelines and approaches, especially concerning training in psychotherapy, forensic psychiatry 
and psychiatric rehabilitation, can vary from one school of psychiatry to another, and psychotherapy is 
much less used than a strictly biological approach. Despite psychotherapy training being relatively 
insufficient to ensure proper know-how, students who have completed the 4-year training are considered 
licensed psychotherapists. Psychologists 155. 
Psychologists play an active role in the consultation-liaison process set up to link GPs to mental 
health professionals (see Box 7). The WHO Mental Health Atlas (WHO, 2011) has reported that Italy as 
having one of the lowest numbers of clinician psychologists in Europe, with a ratio of 2.58 psychologists 
for 100 000 inhabitants in 2011. 156. 
Contact with psychologists is low overall in Italy. For instance, the ESEMeD study found that 
only 6% of people had addressed a psychologist with the NHS for a psychological issue (De Girolamo et 
al., 2006a) with the general impression being that psychotherapy is costly: concretely, the Bersani decree 
of 2006 (D.L. 4/7/2006 n. 233 c.d.) has abolished minimum tariffs for psychotherapy sessions, with 
regional orders of psychologists setting up varied rates for consultancy and therapy sessions (usually from 
EUR 35 up to EUR 115) (for further information on tariffs see http://www.psy.it/tariffario.html ). 157. 
Aspiring psychologists have to complete a 3-year programme (bachelor's degree) followed by a 
2-year programme (master's degree) in psychological specialties. In order to be licensed within the NHS 
system, students must then complete an additional 4-year postgraduate training. Aspiring psychotherapists 
must complete a 4-year postgraduate training in a university with a psychotherapy programme or in 
certified private facilities. Mental health nurses 158. 
The number of mental health nurses (relative to the population) was well below the OECD 
average in 2011, with approximately 19 mental health nurses per 100 000 population in Italy in 2011 (see 
Figure 24). DELSA/HEA/WD/HWP(2014)4 66 Figure 24. Mental health nurses per 100 000 population, 2011 (or nearest year) Source: OECD (2013), Health at a Glance 2013: OECD Indicators, OECD Publishing. 159. 
Aspiring nurses must complete a 3-year university-based programme, resulting in a bachelor's 
degree in nursing. Seminars covering psychological and psychiatric topics constitute a small part of the 
overall training (total of 105 hours out of 1 500 hours), as does practical training in mental health facilities 
(total of 100 hours out of 3 000 hours). Accumulating a certain amount of credits can also make students 
eligible for a master's degree in mental health. 49.7 19.3 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 Netherlands

In 1978, the NHS introduced a fully tax-based public health care system founded on the principle 
of universal coverage, whilst a narrower share was left to users' out-of-pocket payments (co-payments for 
public services and the purchase of private services) and voluntary health insurance. Funds are allocated by 
the Government as a general health budget to the regions, and then the regions allocate their budget to 
Local Health Authorities according to their needs and priorities. The allocation of financial resources to 
health sectors, including mental health, is made at the regional level, resulting in a wide variability across 
regions. Each region in Italy has financial and managerial autonomy, resulting in Local Health Authorities 
being responsible for their own budget and financing mental health services that they consider appropriate 
and responsive to local needs. 161. 
The formula for allocating financial resources has always been a source of debate in Italy. On the 
one hand, focus was given to the  " horizontal "  equity of access of health services, on the other hand there 
was concern about agreeing an allocation formula that could take into account regional and local peculiar 
needs ( " vertical equity " ). The progressive establishment of a system of fiscal federalism resulted in the 
abolition of social insurance contributions in 1998 and the subsequent inception of a regionally collected 
system of tax financing. General taxation started playing an increasingly marginal role, redistributing 
resources across regions with a more contracted tax base in order to ensure equal provision of health care 
services across the 20 regions (Lo Scalzo et al., 2009). Moving away from a system based on historical 
spending, a weighted capitation rate was eventually introduced in 2003. The allocation formula took into 
consideration the Essential Levels of Assistance – defined as the minimum level of care that the NHS must 
guarantee to all citizens – and specific population characteristics, such as the size of the weighted 
population, demographic density, epidemiology, infant mortality rates and the number of health facilities 
(Tibaldi et al., 2006). 5.2. Provider payment mechanisms 162. 
In Italy the public health care sector is composed of public facilities and private accredited 
facilities. Private accredited facilities are considered as fully public structures, as they are financed by the 
NHS and provide services on behalf of the NHS (see Box 9). Box 9. The process of accrediting private facilities The Law regarding NHS accreditation in Italy was adopted on 14 January 1997 (Dpr. 14.01.1997). Most recently, 
a new legal framework – Disciplinare sulla revisione della normativa dell'Accreditamento – was approved on 20 
December 2012, which slightly reformed the 1997 Law. The 1997 Law defined the minimum structural, technological 
and organisational standards that need to be fulfilled by any health facility in order to be accredited to the public sector. 
Although the accreditation process has to comply with the national guidelines outlined by the Ministry of Health, the 
1997 Law devolves to regions the responsibility to define quality standards for the accreditation process. Regional 
criteria are often stricter than national standards. The 1998-2000 National Health Plan deemed the accreditation 
process to be the best way to select health services providers on the basis of quality standards, in that it certifies that 
accredited facilities are in compliance with the standards in force and requires accredited structures to be regularly 
monitored (Ministry of Health, 1998b). DELSA/HEA/WD/HWP(2014)4 68 163. 
A tailored budget is established for inpatient, outpatient and long-term residential and semi-
residential facilities. Some inpatient facilities (psychiatric wards in general hospitals, GHPUs) are 
reimbursed for the hospitalisation of patients with mental illness on the basis of the diagnosis-related group 
(DRG) system. Post-hospitalisation rehabilitation activities are reimbursed on the basis of national tariffs. 
For most outpatient facilities (e.g. CMHCs), specialist mental health care tariffs are established at the 
national level. The daily tariffs of residential and semi-residential facilities depend on the type of 
assistance provided (intensive, extensive care). In particular, tariffs for residential facilities vary 
significantly across regions (OECD Mental Health Questionnaire, 2012). However, a document reviewing 
cost standards and tariffs in RFs has been drafted and should be approved in the near future. General Practitioners (GPs) 164. 
Before the inception of the NHS in 1978, GPs were remunerated through the patient's mutual 
fund. Charging a fee for each given service, a GP's salary depended directly on the number of services 
provided. Since the establishment of the NHS, GPs can decide whether to work full-time or part-time for 
the NHS, and they are remunerated by Local Health Authorities on a capitation basis. The capitation 
formula is calculated by multiplying the number of patients enrolled on a GP's list by the payment per 
capita. Treating patients privately on a fee-for-service basis could also represent an additional source of 
revenue, provided that the provision of private services does not interfere with the time devoted to the 
regular provision of primary care services for NHS patients (WHO, 2011). 165. 
Every three years an agreement is signed between the central government and the GP trade 
unions. The agreement determines the terms and conditions of the contract, including payment levels, 
duties, GP responsibilities, in addition to the maximum number of patients enrolled on a GP's list 
(Lo Scalzo et al., 2009). Apart from the national agreement, GPs also sign regional contracts, which define 
the conditions for delivering supplementary services and earning incentives and for participating in 
targeted training programmes. 5.3. Mental health care expenditure 166. 
There is no data available on mental health care spending at the national level. This is due to the 
fact that the regions and Local Health Authorities are totally autonomous in the allocation of financial 
resources to health care sectors. However, it was established through the Conference of Regions 
(Conferenza delle Regioni) that no less than 5% of the local health budget should be allocated to mental 
health services (WHO, 2011). Nonetheless, this is a general guideline rather than the actual mental health 
care expenditure at the regional level, with some regions consistently allocating more than 5% of their 
health budget to mental health care, and other regions less. 167. 
Although national data on mental health expenditure is not available, regional and local studies 
have been performed to track mental health spending. For instance, the city of Trieste regularly tracks the 
financial resources used for providing mental health services, a model that has been implemented in the 
entire region of Friuli-Venezia-Giulia (see Box 8). Pharmaceutical expenditures and consumption 168. 
The pricing and reimbursement of pharmaceuticals are handled by the Italian Pharmaceutical 
Agency (Agenzia Italiana del Farmaco – AIFA). The negotiations on drug pricing/reimbursement are 
subject to several criteria: DELSA/HEA/WD/HWP(2014)4 69 @BULLET The cost/effectiveness ratio must be positive for a new drug to be covered by the NHS (i.e. a new 
drug must present an adequate alternative treatment for a pathology compared to other available 
treatments for the same therapeutic indications); @BULLET The risk/benefit ratio must be higher than that of other available drugs for the same therapeutic 
indications; @BULLET The economic and financial impact on the National Health Service must be evaluated; @BULLET The cost of the therapy must be preferable compared to other products of the same effectiveness; @BULLET Market shares must be evaluated; @BULLET A comparison of the drug's price and consumption in other EU countries must be made. 169. 
Pharmaceuticals under class A and H 10 are fully reimbursed by the NHS, with the user paying a 
fixed price per box, whereas pharmaceuticals under class C and C-bis 11 are paid entirely by users' out-of-
pocket fees. 170. 
Total spending for Central Nervous System pharmaceuticals accounted for EUR 3.410 million in 
2011, representing the second-highest pharmaceutical national spend. 42.5% of this figure was entirely 
financed by the NHS, 17.5% was refunded by public institutions and the remaining 40% was financed by 
users through out-of-pocket payments (70% of which belongs to class C) (OsMed, 2012). 171. 
The consumption (in DDD/1 000 population) of anxiolytics in Italy is stable since 2000, and 
slightly above the OECD average in 2011 (see Figures 25). 10 Pharmaceuticals under class A are dispensed in pharmacies, whereas those under class H are dispensed in 
hospitals and health care clinics only. 11 Pharmaceuticals under class C require a medical prescription, whereas those under class C-bis don't. DELSA/HEA/WD/HWP(2014)4 70 Figure 25. DDD of anxiolytics per 1 000 population in OECD countries, 2010 or latest year available Source: OECD (2013), Health at a Glance 2013: OECD Indicators, OECD Publishing 172. 
Conversely, in 2011 the consumption of antidepressants was lower in Italy compared to the 
OECD average. In line with all OECD countries, the consumption of antidepressants has increased over the 
past decade in Italy (see Figure 26). 31 24.6 0

This increase in the consumption of antidepressants could be explained by a variety of factors: 
increased cases of depression within the general population, and the growing attention that primary health 
care specialists are devoting to mental health (OsMED, 2012). The OsMed (2012) study also provides an 
analysis of the use of antidepressants. It was estimated that only 1 out of 4 people being treated with 
antidepressants has exceeded the 2009 Nice guidelines on depression and used the treatment for more than 56 42 0

whilst Basilicata and Calabria were the less compliant (OsMed, 2012). 174. 
Unlike antidepressants, the consumption of antipsychotic drugs decreased in 2010 from the 
previous year (from 3.01 in 2009 to 2.80 DDD/1000 population per day), in line with the steady decrease 
that has been observed since 2001 (Sabetta, 2012). DELSA/HEA/WD/HWP(2014)4 73 6. DISCUSSION, INNOVATIVE PRACTICES AND CONCLUSION 6.1. Discussion and key messages 175. 
One of the most important peculiarities of the mental health system in Italy is the shift from 
hospital-centred services to community-based mental health facilities that occurred over the last thirty 
years. This de-institutionalisation process abandoned old approaches of social seclusion and stigmatisation 
of people with mental health disorders in favour of their social re-integration into the community 
(Mezzina, 2005). Italy's long history of de-institutionalisation is now culminating in the process of closing 
all the Judicial Psychiatric Hospitals, which are the last form of mental health institutions still found in 
Italy. The next step towards the accomplishment of this de-institutionalisation process would be the 
improvement and reorganisation of Residential Facilities (RFs), which in some cases provide mental health 
assistance rather than therapeutic care, without a real connection with the community or limits on the 
length of stay. This is of particular interest in that an important portion of mental health financial resources 
are allocated to RFs, with a reduced budget allocated to other mental health services, e.g. CMHCs. Whilst 
there is an urgent necessity to re-define national standards, a document addressing these issues is under 
approval by State and Regions. 176. 
Running in parallel with de-institutionalisation was the process of federalisation, with regions 
gaining growing responsibilities with respect to the central Government in the management of financial 
resources, the settling of regional standards, the definition of regional policies and the management of 
services. If on the one hand regional autonomy promotes tailored interventions based on local needs, on the 
other hand it also intensifies existing differences across regions in terms of the provision of mental health 
services, the efficacy of information systems, tariffs and organisation. This is particularly true with respect 
to child and adolescent mental health services, whose organisation differs particularly from region to 
region and where in some cases psychiatric services do not always collaborate with Infant Neuropsychiatry 
Services. Whilst there are increasing efforts towards the development of a more bilanced relationship 
between the Ministry of Health – whose objective is to set National standards – and the regions – whose 
scope is to organise and manage mental health services – there is still the need to guarantee greater 
homogeneity across regions. 177. 
As discussed earlier in this chapter, progress is being made in the development of mental health 
information systems. However, mental health information systems should be implemented throughout all 
Italy's regions, and benchmark indicators on the quality of mental health services should also be 
developed. Moreover, a second step for the development of mental health information systems would be to 
include epidemiological data in addition to data on the services provided. The development of efficient 
information systems would also allow the Ministry of Health to develop a set of clinical and outcome 
indicators on mental health at the national level. Although the Ministry of Health is currently moving in 
this direction, there is still progress to be made at the regional level to collect qualitative data. 178. 
Although epidemiological studies have been conducted on the prevalence and incidence of 
mental health problems in specific areas or selected population groups, there is still the need to conduct 
epidemiological studies on the general population at the national level. So far the focus has been on the 
population accessing a sample of mental health services. However, the results of such epidemiological 
studies are unlikely to represent the general population, first of all because people not accessing mental 
health services are not being represented, and second because the population sample is not drawn from the DELSA/HEA/WD/HWP(2014)4 74 entire population but from specific pilot areas, thereby biasing the results of the estimation. The existence 
of national epidemiological data on the general population would allow the Ministry of Health to adopt 
targeted interventions, to promote tailored mental health policies and to develop outcomes and clinical 
indicators to allow benchmarking both domestically within the country and internationally across 
countries. 179. 
Last but not least, data and indicators on mental health outcomes should be accompanied with 
data and indicators on mental health inputs. There is still the urgent need in Italy to provide qualitative and 
reliable information on mental health expenditures both at the regional and national level, in order to fully 
evaluate the performance of the mental health system and measure whether resources are being allocated in 
an efficient and optimal way. 6.2. Ongoing mental health agenda 180. 
Besides defining a set of priority areas, as is discussed in section 3.3., the Italian Mental Health 
Action Plan (IMHAP) (Linee di Azioni Nazionale per la Salute Mentale) (Ministry of Health, 2013) also 
suggests a variety of mental health areas to be included in the mental health agenda in the upcoming 
months/years. The IMHAP proposes developing a set of national guidelines and/or specific action plans 
on: suicide prevention; personality, mood and eating disorders; mental health in migrants and residential 
and day treatment facilities; and autism disorders, which was very recently addressed by a national 
guideline (SNLG, 2011), and an action plan approved by the Ministry of Health and the Regions (Ministry 
of Health, 2012b). 6.3. Outstanding and innovative initiatives: best practice examples @BULLET The formal process of closing all the Judicial Psychiatric Hospitals, promoted by the joint efforts 
of the Ministry of Health, the Ministry of Justice and the Regions, and accelerated by the 
Parliamentary Commission of Inquiry into the efficacy and efficiency of the National Health 
Service (Commissione Parlamentare di Inchiesta sull'efficacia e l'efficienza del Servizio 
Sanitario Nazionale) (section 4.3). @BULLET The development by the SIEP of a set of clinical indicators for depression, schizophrenia and 
bipolar disorders. These clinical indicators are a crucial tool for improving the quality of care and 
carrying out evidence-based interventions to treat severe mental health disorders (section 2.3). @BULLET The experience of the South Verona community psychiatric service (CPS) (section 4.5). @BULLET Local activities undertaken to fight stigma (section 4.5.). @BULLET The development of a more structured approach to the treatment of mild to moderate mental 
health disorders in primary care, e.g. the consultation-liaison model developed in Emilia 
Romagna (section 4.1.). DELSA/HEA/WD/HWP(2014)4 75 GLOSSARY @BULLET Governance refers to the exercise of political, economic and administrative authority in the 
management of a country's affairs at all levels (WHO). @BULLET Mild generally refers to relatively few core symptoms (although sufficient to achieve a 
diagnosis), a limited duration and little impact on day-to-day functioning (NICE, 2011). @BULLET Moderate refers to the presence of all core symptoms of the disorder plus several other related 
symptoms, duration beyond that required by minimum diagnostic criteria, and a clear impact on 
functioning (NICE, 2011). @BULLET Severe refers to the presence of most or all symptoms of the disorder, often of long duration and 
with very marked impact on functioning (for example, an inability to participate in work-related 
activities and withdrawal from interpersonal activities) (NICE, 2011). @BULLET A user / consumer / patient is a person receiving mental health care. These terms are used in 
different places and by different groups of practitioners and people with mental disorders (WHO, 
2011). @BULLET Family comprises members of the families of persons with mental disorders who act as carers 
(WHO, 2011). @BULLET Mental health policy: The official statement of a government conveying an organized set of 
values, principles, objectives and areas for action to improve the mental health of a population 
(WHO, 2011). @BULLET Mental health strategy/plan: A detailed pre-formulated scheme that details the strategies and 
activities that will be implemented to realize the objectives of the policy. It also specifies other 
crucial elements such as the budget and timeframe for implementing strategies and activities and 
specific targets that will be met. The plan also clarifies the roles of different stakeholders 
involved in the implementation of activities defined within the mental health plan. Mental health 
programmes are included within the mental health plan category. A mental health programme is a 
targeted intervention, usually short-term, with a highly focused objective for the promotion of 
mental health, the prevention of mental disorders, and treatment and rehabilitation (WHO, 2011). @BULLET Mental health legislation: Mental health legislation may cover a broad array of issues including 
access to mental health care and other services, quality of mental health care, admission to mental 
health facilities, consent to treatment, freedom from cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment, 
freedom from discrimination, the enjoyment of a full range of civil, cultural, economic, political 
and social rights, and provisions for legal mechanisms to promote and protect human rights (e.g. 
review bodies to oversee admission and treatment to mental health facilities, monitoring bodies to 
inspect human rights conditions in facilities and complaints mechanisms) (WHO, 2011). DELSA/HEA/WD/HWP(2014)4 76 @BULLET Psychiatrist: A medical doctor who has had at least two years of post-graduate training in 
psychiatry at a recognized teaching institution leading to a recognized degree or diploma (WHO, 
2011). @BULLET Nurse: A health professional who has completed formal training in nursing at a recognized, 
university-level school for a diploma or degree in nursing (WHO, 2011). @BULLET Psychologist: A health professional who has completed formal training in psychology at a 
recognized, university-level school for a diploma or degree in psychology (WHO, 2011). @BULLET Social worker: A health professional who has completed formal training in social work at a 
recognized, university-level school for a diploma or degree in social work (WHO, 2011). @BULLET Mental health outpatient facility: A facility that specifically focuses on the management of 
mental disorders and related clinical problems on an outpatient basis. These facilities are staffed 
with health care providers specifically trained in mental health (WHO, 2011). @BULLET Mental health day treatment facility: A facility that provides care for users during the day. The 
facilities are generally available to groups of users at the same time and expect users to stay at the 
facilities beyond the periods during which they have face-to-face contact with staff and / or 
participate in therapy activities. Attendance typically ranges from a half to one full day (4 – 8 
hours), for one or more days of the week (WHO, 2011). @BULLET Psychiatric ward in a general hospital: A ward within a general hospital that is reserved for the 
care of persons with mental disorders (WHO, 2011). @BULLET Community residential facility: A non-hospital, community based mental health facility that 
provides overnight residence for people with mental disorders. Usually these facilities serve users 
with relatively stable mental disorders not requiring intensive medical interventions (WHO, 
2011). @BULLET Mental hospital: A specialized hospital-based facility that provides inpatient care and long-stay 
residential services for people with severe mental disorders. Usually these facilities are 
independent and standalone, although they may have some links with the rest of the health care 
system. The level of specialization varies considerably; in some cases only long stay custodial 
services are offered, in others specialized and short-term services are also available (WHO, 
2011). @BULLET Forensic units: forensic units care for people with mental disorders who have come into contact 
with the criminal justice system. They may also be called secure units or special hospitals (WHO, 
2008). @BULLET Community mental health services: secondary or specialist care (care that cannot be provided by 
a primary care physician). At its most basic, it may be office-based private care or, more often, 
outpatient clinic (polyclinic) provision for assessing and treating mental illness by a trained 
mental health professional (such as a psychiatrist or psychologist). It can also be provided by a 
multidisciplinary team (community mental health team) comprising psychiatrists, mental health 
nurses and often psychologists and social workers. They usually provide care for the inhabitants 
of a clearly defined catchment area (such as a borough or town). Care is provided in a variety of 
settings (such as clinics, people's homes and day centres). An alternative structure is the DELSA/HEA/WD/HWP(2014)4 77 community mental health centre, where several teams run a range of services, one of which is 
assessment and care outside the hospital (WHO, 2008). @BULLET Secure psychiatric beds  " Secure mental health services provide accommodation, treatment and 
support for people with severe mental health problems who pose a risk to the public. Sometimes 
known as 'forensic' mental health services, secure services work predominantly with people who 
have been imprisoned or admitted "  directly to hospital through the 1983 Mental Health Act 
following a criminal offence. (Centre for Mental Health, 2011) @BULLET Stigma: A stigma is a distinguishing mark establishing a demarcation between the stigmatized 
person and others attributing negative characteristics to this person. The stigma attached to 
mental illness often leads to social exclusion and discrimination and creates an additional burden 
for the affected individual (WHO, 2008). @BULLET Prevention: Mental disorder prevention focuses on reducing risk factors and enhancing protective 
factors associated with mental ill health with the aim of reducing the risk, incidence, prevalence 
and recurrence of mental disorders (WHO, 2008). @BULLET Primary health care (PHC): Encompasses any health clinic that offers the first point of entry into 
the health system. These clinics usually provide initial assessment and treatment for common 
health conditions and refer those requiring more specialized diagnosis and treatment to facilities 
with staff with a higher level of training and resources (WHO, 2011). DELSA/HEA/WD/HWP(2014)4 78 REFERENCES Alonso, J., M.C. Angermeyer, S. Bernert et al. (2003),  " The European Study of the Epidemiology of
