			<head>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY<lb/></head>

			<p>The following analysis of what is needed to support social entrepreneurship in Serbia is based on a<lb/> fact-finding mission by the OECD team at the end of February 2012. The OECD team interviewed a wide<lb/> range of actors, including senior government officials, representatives from the new and established social<lb/> economy, representatives from the business community, academia and experts and the international donor<lb/> community; the mission also extended to examine the regional context through a visit to Novi Sad. The<lb/> policy analysis also draws on considerable and diverse international experience, not as a model for<lb/> implementation, but as a basis for comparison to critically assess the current policy framework in relation<lb/> to the current specificities of the Serbian context. The policy options and recommendations are offered as<lb/> a basis for debate and discussion with key stakeholders concerned with taking forward the development of<lb/> social enterprise and social entrepreneurship in Serbia.<lb/></p>

			<head>Serbia: Economy and Society in Transition<lb/></head>

			<p>Serbia has emerged from a turbulent period of its history and made important progress towards<lb/> democracy and a market economy. Unfortunately the global economic crisis has brought new problems of<lb/> stagnation, with high public and private debt. Numerous political, economic, and institutional reforms have<lb/> been carried out, but further structural reforms are required, including: administrative reforms, addressing<lb/> corruption in procurement, further privatisation, measures to strengthen small and medium sized<lb/> enterprises (SMEs) and the agricultural sector; these include better access to bank finance, and improving<lb/> the functioning of micro-finance – so that jobs can be created and entrepreneurship supported. This is<lb/> important because the employment rate is low, particularly amongst young people, and there are a variety<lb/> of groups facing social exclusion (including Roma, people with disabilities, refugees and internally<lb/> displaced people), together with considerable regional disparities. At the same time, there is a substantial<lb/> informal economy. Thus, entrepreneurship and work integration need to be more fully addressed. Visits by<lb/> the International Monetary Fund, and the programme of reforms leading to EU accession, will further<lb/> increase pressure for these reforms to be implemented.<lb/></p>

			<head>The Contribution of Social Entrepreneurship<lb/></head>

			<p>Despite some cultural barriers in Serbia, social entrepreneurship could make an important contribution<lb/> to many of these areas, as it has in many other countries in Europe, through work integration for<lb/> employment and social inclusion, through more socially cohesive welfare services, rural development and<lb/> through its contributions to civil society by building trust and social capital. The context for social<lb/> entrepreneurship has been considerably enhanced by a wide range of institutional reforms, but despite a<lb/> range of legislative reforms in Serbia, the only legally recognised form of social enterprise is the company<lb/> for the disabled, and each of the other legal structures relevant to social entrepreneurship (non-profits,<lb/> foundations, and co-operatives), face some difficulties. So far the opportunities for social entrepreneurship<lb/> have been rather limited, with some work integration initiatives and some welfare service provision, albeit<lb/> within a framework of rather limited access to public procurement markets. This provides clear indications<lb/> of the potential of social entrepreneurship, but in order to develop a more sustainable sector more needs to<lb/> be done if that potential is to be fulfilled. The emerging networks supporting social entrepreneurship,<lb/> though weak, are energetic and capable, and with some focused government support there is some<lb/> optimism for the future.<lb/> Government support could most effectively target the following areas: pre-conditions, infrastructure,<lb/> governance in policy, finance, skills, and access to markets.<lb/></p>

			<head>Pre-conditions<lb/></head>

			<p>In terms of cultural pre-conditions, one of the legacies of the Yugoslav socialist period is a public<lb/> distrust of forms of social ownership (as emphasised by participants in the study visit), which has<lb/> hampered both the acceptance of recognition of new forms of social entrepreneurship, and the capacity<lb/> building of entrepreneurial forms of non-profit structures, as well as the reform of other existing social<lb/> enterprise, in particular co-operatives. The situation is further exacerbated by a public attitude of strong<lb/> dependence on the state alongside great distrust of it. Social entrepreneurship has great potential for<lb/> addressing social problems within continuing severe budgetary constraints whilst strengthening trust in<lb/> civil society, thereby overcoming this heritage of distrust and state dependency.<lb/></p>

			<p>The attitudes of various institutions to social entrepreneurship could be improved. In general, banks<lb/> have a conservative and risk averse approach to all forms of SMEs, including social enterprise. Despite<lb/> some good practice there is considerable scope for improving the profile of social entrepreneurship in<lb/> corporate social responsibility programmes of financial services and other multinationals operating in<lb/> Serbia. This would include orienting the National Strategy for Development and Promotion of CSR in the<lb/> Republic of Serbia 2010-2015 much more strongly to social entrepreneurship. This could include a much<lb/> firmer emphasis on all larger enterprises adopting more favourable attitudes in their subcontracting<lb/> relationships both for public procurement and in other markets.<lb/></p>

			<p>There is also scope for greater vertical and horizontal integration of public administration policy to<lb/> ensure that public services (including business support) and procurement practices operate in a fair and<lb/> even-handed way towards social enterprise. This could be strengthened through, for example,<lb/> communication/education about policy frameworks with local officials.<lb/></p>

			<p>There are issues about developing an entrepreneurial and self-help culture (and linked to this, there is<lb/> some evidence that the bankruptcy laws are not conducive to taking entrepreneurial risks). Despite some<lb/> highly capable people associated with the emerging sector of social entrepreneurship, its support networks<lb/> are still weak, and would benefit from strengthening relationships with other key institutions such as<lb/> universities, research institutes, and the media. Similarly, while international donors have been important<lb/> in supporting the climate for social entrepreneurship, there is still scope for focusing their activities, whilst<lb/> EU programmes become available in Serbia&apos;s progress towards accession, and specific EU like the Social<lb/> Business Initiative and the European Platform against Poverty and Social Exclusion give strong support for<lb/> social entrepreneurship. In addition, the informal economy is large, particularly in certain sectors, and this<lb/> hampers prospects for developing social entrepreneurship. It is important to develop measures to address<lb/> this, including more effective regulation and monitoring systems.<lb/></p>

			<head>Infrastructure<lb/></head>

			<p>Currently the only legally recognised form of social enterprise is the company for the disabled.<lb/> However, it appears that their functioning could be better incentivised and regulated, and their financing<lb/> through the Budget Fund, although regulated by government, could be made more clearer. Co-operatives<lb/> suffer considerably from their socialist era heritage, and their long overdue reform through new legislation<lb/> (including for social co-operatives) has been continually delayed. Thus, the considerable potential for<lb/> social co-operatives that has been seen in many other European countries is not institutionally supported in<lb/> Serbia, and has to rely on ad hoc adaptations of existing co-operative legislation. NGOs/associations are<lb/> the other most prominent legal forms for social entrepreneurship in Europe, and are limited in their<lb/> potential in Serbia, due to the need to clarify the condition of &quot; relatedness &quot; (to purpose), and eliminate the<lb/> restrictive conditions placed on allowable economic activity, in that it should be of &quot; small-scale &quot; . In these<lb/> circumstances foundations also appear to have some possibilities as a legal structure for social<lb/> entrepreneurship, but clarification is also required about how to specify &quot; related economic activity &quot; to<lb/> comply with the law, and the &quot; extent of economic activity &quot; allowable, given that it may only be a non-core<lb/> activity (<ref type="biblio">Group 484, 2011</ref>). Thus, both of these structures may allow further development of social<lb/> entrepreneurship, provided guidance can be formulated on the implementation of policy. The limited<lb/> company legal structure is open to exploitation by opportunists, but model bye-laws 1 and a strictly<lb/> regulated social enterprise marque could allow some fruitful development of social entrepreneurship.<lb/> Social entrepreneurship typically links with policy via a variety of government bodies and ministries:<lb/> including the Ministry of Finance and Economy, which is responsible for entrepreneurship in general. The<lb/> Ministry of Labour, Employment and Social Policy is responsible for companies for the disabled, and for<lb/> the administration of the Budget Fund. These, and the National Employment Service and the Public Works<lb/> Programme 2 , are important for work integration. Also, this Ministry provides support for NGOs from the<lb/> administration of the Lottery Fund; Local Governments (with administrative support from the Centres for<lb/> Social Work) establish the framework for social entrepreneurship in community-based welfare services,<lb/> including procurement markets for new services. The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Water<lb/> Management, together with the Ministry of Finance and Economy is responsible for co-operative where<lb/> there is potential for combating rural deprivation through rural development, and agro-tourism, etc. Thus<lb/> for the reasons outlined above, it is important to have an inter-ministerial coordinative function for social<lb/> entrepreneurship – at this stage such a new function could be located in bodies such as the Social Inclusion<lb/> and Poverty Reduction Unit (SIPRU) and the Office for Co-operation with Civil Society (OCCS). There<lb/> are also various systems of business support for social entrepreneurship, including training programmes<lb/> and access to start-up loans and subsidies. However, it is not clear to social entrepreneurs as to whether<lb/> social enterprise have full access to the same system of support for SMEs (which in any case is not well<lb/> developed support), or whether there is sufficient start-up and capacity building support for the social<lb/> enterprise across the whole country. Frequently the tender system for different policy measures, while<lb/> important, needs to be complemented with more substantial support and capacity building if sustainability<lb/> is to be achieved.<lb/> International donors such as United National Development Programme, USAID, the International<lb/> Labour Organisation, the International Organisation for Migration, and the British Council, as well as<lb/> various national governments, and the EU, have all made important contributions to the emerging field of<lb/> social entrepreneurship. The UN Global Compact has helped focus corporate social responsibility activity,<lb/> where some of the banks have been prominent, but there is clearly potential for more support, whilst access<lb/> to new sources of EU funding emerges and develops.<lb/> The sector has a voice through a dynamic, albeit weak, Coalition for the Development of Social<lb/> Entrepreneurship, and also through a similar body: the Social Economy Network Serbia (SENS). Whilst<lb/> the organisations representing the traditional social economy remain rather separate, they also have the<lb/> potential to support the social enterprise sector alongside government actors. Thus, there is scope for<lb/> improving structures of governance to strengthen the emerging sector and link with and capacity build the<lb/> established social economy.<lb/></p>

			<head>Governance in Policy<lb/></head>

			<p>For social entrepreneurship policy to have a good fit with the needs of the emerging sector, there<lb/> needs to be a meaningful system of consultation and policy co-development, which is a system of policy<lb/> co-governance. The preconditions for this are vertically and horizontally integrated policy systems which<lb/> are transparent and effectively administered. As recognised in the Needs Assessment Document to support<lb/> the sustainable socio-economic development and European integration of the Republic of Serbia through<lb/> international development assistance (Government of Republic of Serbia, 2011a) strategy for EU<lb/> accession, Serbia still has some progress to make in order to achieve this. SIPRU and OCCS are important<lb/> institutional innovations to help improve vertical and horizontal policy integration and these need to be<lb/> combined with improving the governance of the emerging sector and its links with the established social<lb/> economy.<lb/></p>

			<head>Finance<lb/></head>

			<p>Social entrepreneurship attempts to generate a spirit of self-help amongst disadvantaged individuals<lb/> and communities. By definition these are not well resourced communities, thus developing a portfolio of<lb/> appropriate resources is essential. In general the banking system for SMEs (including social enterprise) is<lb/> conservative and risk averse. In addition, micro-finance, which is so important for assisting the<lb/> disadvantaged, is severely constrained and over-regulated by international standards, due to its over-<lb/>dependence on the banks. Similarly credit unions, member-based financial co-operatives, are not allowed<lb/> in Serbia. On the other hand the Budget Fund, Public Works, and the Lottery Fund are all important in<lb/> providing complementary sources of funding to that of the banks; and there may be scope for improving<lb/> the access, orientation, and extent of these resources. The Development Fund is also relevant. EU<lb/> accession will also bring with it various EU programmes that will, to some extent, compensate for the<lb/> decline in support from international donors. But there is no substitute for a comprehensive framework<lb/> that supports the financial needs of social entrepreneurs during start-up, development and growth of their<lb/> social enterprises.<lb/></p>

			<head>Skills<lb/></head>

			<p>The following range of skills is required for the development of social entrepreneurship:<lb/></p>

			<p> Skills for social inclusion (and other sector related skills – for example in community<lb/> development, and welfare services). This includes life skills, social skills, and work skills to<lb/> support entry into the labour market. This relies on some sources of funding and the work<lb/> programmes identified above, however skills development is generally under-emphasised in<lb/> Serbian labour market programmes.<lb/>  Skills for entrepreneurship and management (marketing and finance, business planning and<lb/> development and also skills for growth and scaling). This is a key area for social entrepreneurs,<lb/> since business skills are crucial for sustainability, particularly for marketing and financial control.<lb/> In Serbia training provision in this area exists but not to a high level. Instead social entrepreneurs<lb/> rely on: accessing the support for SMEs and the self-employed; the support of international donor<lb/> organisations; and, the growing use of EU programmes. Although there has been some progress<lb/> in supporting entrepreneurship training, social entrepreneurship training could be more strongly<lb/> supported through the education and training system.<lb/></p>

			<head> Skills for meeting regulatory and reporting requirements and negotiating with bureaucracies.<lb/></head>

			<p>These higher-level skills are not generally seen as a high priority in Serbia until more state<lb/> contracting takes place and the micro-credit regime is liberalised. Such skills provision could<lb/> come from international donor organisations, although their supply of resources is declining.<lb/></p>

			<head> Skills for the development of social enterprise</head>

			<p>(development workers): this aspect of skills<lb/> development is essential to achieve a sustainable and growing sector; it currently takes place<lb/> through informal learning in the networks of groups supporting social entrepreneurship; greater<lb/> emphasis on developing these skills will be required as the sector develops and moves towards<lb/> growth and sustainability.<lb/></p>

			<head>Access to Markets<lb/></head>

			<p>Public procurement markets are potentially one of the most important for supporting the development<lb/> of social enterprise. However, this is unlikely to take place until the distinctive contribution of social<lb/> enterprise is more fully recognised, and social enterprise themselves have become more established and<lb/> sustainable. There are various ways in which this &quot; chicken and egg &quot; situation could develop. As noted<lb/> earlier, certain preconditions about establishing a better enabling framework for procurement via social<lb/> enterprise needs to be developed at municipal and other levels. The tendering system for projects offers<lb/> short-term service providing opportunities, but the challenge is to find better access to regular markets for<lb/> public service provision. There are some encouraging developments, for example Meals on Wheels in<lb/> Belgrade and the waste recycling initiatives. But an exploratory niche strategy for public service provision<lb/> of social enterprise could be the most fruitful future strategy (with regard to public procurement). In<lb/> addition, accessing diaspora funds as private sources of finance for welfare services may be an important<lb/> complementary source of funding. Similarly the markets for donations and legacies are relatively<lb/> undeveloped, but could have substantial potential. Corporate social responsibility markets could also be<lb/> addressed more professionally.<lb/></p>

			<p>The development of social entrepreneurship in other markets may be more straightforward –<lb/> particularly for ethical goods and services and for environmental services – areas where the distinctive<lb/> values and structures of social enterprise provide clear advantages.<lb/></p>

			<head>Policy Recommendations<lb/></head>

			<p>The approach adopted here is a cautious one with the aim of establishing the emerging sector on a<lb/> sound foundation and gradually building its reputation as a distinctive social but entrepreneurial<lb/> innovation. Thus, many of the recommendations should be seen in the perspective of gradually building an<lb/> appropriate framework, alongside an emerging movement, with the development of new social enterprise<lb/> law being seen as a medium term objective.<lb/></p>

			<p>The section on legislation explores the options in more depth, but to summarise: foundations seem to<lb/> have some potential, albeit with clarificatory guidance required on permissible &quot; related economic activity &quot; .<lb/> Such guidance has been used in countries, including Turkey and the United Kingdom (UK). In Turkey,<lb/> TUSEV, an advocacy organisation, following consulting with the relevant departments of the Ministry of<lb/> Finance and Ministry of Development reached the conclusion that best way to create a better legal<lb/> environment for social enterprises was not by new laws, but by regulating the existing framework through<lb/> circulars and communications made by Ministries. Whilst in the UK, the Charity Commission provides a<lb/> range of online guidance documents – which clarify the guidelines operated by officials as well as<lb/> providing valuable guidance on sometimes difficult legislative conditions for social entrepreneurs<lb/> (http://www.charity-commission.gov.uk/Charity_requirements_guidance/Charity_essentials/default.aspx).<lb/> A socially entrepreneurial culture could be developed by encouraging small-scale entrepreneurship by<lb/> associations, and co-operatives are also clearly relevant, particularly if they could be supported and linked<lb/> in a new distinctive network, with a well regulated social enterprise marquee. There may be scope for<lb/> using social enterprise model constitutions with the limited company form, though there are risks in the<lb/> medium term due to exploitation by opportunists.<lb/></p>

			<p>The policy analysis and recommendations draw on considerable and diverse international experience,<lb/> not as a model for implementation, but as a basis for comparison to critically assess the current policy<lb/> framework in relation to the current specificities of the Serbian context. The policy options and<lb/> recommendations are offered as a basis for debate and discussion with key stakeholders concerned to take<lb/> forward the development of social enterprise and social entrepreneurship in Serbia.<lb/></p>

			<p>There are some underlying principles regarding developing appropriate frameworks for social<lb/> entrepreneurship. Firstly, that it is important to develop a level playing field with regard to other types of<lb/> organisations in the market, particularly SMEs. Secondly, that legal frameworks should be well adapted to<lb/> the distinctive needs of social enterprise, combining social and economic objectives, and it is important to<lb/> recognise that in many countries legislation has followed innovation over a number of years by social<lb/> entrepreneurs who have adapted existing legislation to their requirements. Thirdly, there should be a well<lb/> supported institutional and policy framework that matches well with the relevant types of legal forms of<lb/> social enterprise. Finally, in developing such policy frameworks, it is important that the public/social<lb/> benefit dimension of social enterprise is not only properly recognised, but also financially supported – as it<lb/> would be in the context of state funded benefits.<lb/></p>

			<p>The policy recommendations follow the same thematic as above: Preconditions, Infrastructure,<lb/> Governance, Finance, Skills, and Access to Markets. Taken together these comprise a strategy for social<lb/> entrepreneurship, which requires a new coordinative function to be established to negotiate with relevant<lb/> government and sector bodies and ensure the strategy is supported and implemented; such a function<lb/> would need to operate at the inter-ministerial level and could be located in existing bodies such as SIPRU<lb/> or OCCS.<lb/></p>

			<head>Recommendations to Improve Preconditions<lb/></head>

			<p>Develop a public relations strategy for social entrepreneurship, which could include:<lb/>  promoting models of good practices;<lb/>  attracting public figures and celebrities to social entrepreneurship, including via corporate social<lb/> responsibility;<lb/>  competitions for best social enterprise and best social entrepreneurs of the year;<lb/>  the use of online media (Group 484&apos;s electronic &quot; Newsletter on Social Entrepreneurship &quot; :<lb/> http://www.grupa484.org.rs/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=406&amp;lang=english)<lb/> is one such example;<lb/>  strengthening research/policy/media networking so that sympathetic journalists are properly<lb/> briefed;<lb/>  raising the profile of social entrepreneurship in corporate social responsibility programmes; and,<lb/>  a few sector strategies be developed as exemplars of effective social enterprise approaches to the<lb/> informal economy, for example, in recycling, homecare, childcare, local food markets.<lb/></p>

			<head>Recommendations to Improve Infrastructure<lb/> Legal Frameworks<lb/></head>

			<p> Foundations:<lb/>  examine the potential of the foundation as a model for social entrepreneurship, especially the<lb/> issue around relatedness to mission – registered activity;<lb/>  clarify how to specify related economic activity in order to comply with the law, and the<lb/> extent of economic activity, given it may only be a non-core activity;<lb/>  explore the extent to which Guidance Notes by registrars could be produced for public<lb/> official and social entrepreneurs; and,<lb/>  allow flexibility in the choice of economic activities and potentially link the issue of mission<lb/> versus non-mission relatedness to different fiscal regimes.<lb/></p>

			<head> NGOs/associations:<lb/></head>

			<p> clarify the permissible limit of &quot; small-scale &quot; economic activity, such as through guidance<lb/> notes, to facilitate flexible and larger scale entrepreneurial activity; and,<lb/>  encourage them to engage in entrepreneurial activity up to this limit;<lb/>  consider inclusion of asset locks 3 for both NGOs/associations and foundations;<lb/>  using company law develop model constitutions and bye-laws, but limit their access to public<lb/> funds;<lb/>  develop a sector body to introduce and oversee a social enterprise marque renewable annually,<lb/> with quality checks (partly to guard against opportunism by limited companies); this might best<lb/> be undertaken by an independent member-based trade association.<lb/></p>

			<head> Co-operatives:<lb/></head>

			<p> press for resolution to the social/public property issue and the adoption of new draft<lb/> legislation on co-operatives and the inclusion of articles or separate law for social co-<lb/>operatives;<lb/>  consideration could be given to ensuring these articles/laws are relevant to both work<lb/> integration and welfare service operatives, and that they function as non-profit organisations<lb/> and that they allow multi-stakeholder structures;<lb/>  press for a change in the law allowing a reduction in the numbers required to form a co-<lb/>operative (to the same number as for associations (3) – to equalise the incentives for<lb/> formation in two comparable member-based organisations; and in line with recent legislative<lb/> trends: Italian social co-ops/enterprise, Finnish co-ops/social enterprise, Belgium co-<lb/>ops/social enterprise, Spain, France; but not Poland/Portugal (5 minimum); and<lb/>  press for a change in the law to allow secondary co-operatives to be formed;<lb/>  support the development of a network assisting new socially entrepreneurial co-operative<lb/> could also be provided.<lb/>  as a medium-term goal, develop legislation for social enterprise (which develops a broad<lb/> inclusive definition of the field); and,<lb/>  examine increased incentivised fiscal measures linked to each legal structure as a way of<lb/> improving the chances of sustainability.<lb/></p>

			<head>Recommendations to Improve Institutional Capabilities (Governmental, Donor Community)<lb/></head>

			<p>Gradually reshape each of the relevant government programmes, by:<lb/></p>

			<p> taking forward the proposals in this document with relevant local/national government and sector<lb/> stakeholders to establish a strategy for social entrepreneurship;<lb/>  establishing a new social entrepreneurship coordinative function to negotiate with relevant<lb/> responsible bodies and ensure the strategy is supported and implemented; such a function would<lb/> need to operate at the inter-ministerial level and could be located in existing bodies such as<lb/> SIPRU or OCCS;<lb/>  developing a work integration social enterprise strategy (with appropriate models and<lb/> mechanisms, and a protected budget) linked both to the National Employment Service, and to the<lb/> Public Works Programme, and other relevant programmes;<lb/>  capacity building of NGOs for social enterprise activity financed by the Lottery Fund;<lb/>  developing a social enterprise strategy for welfare service provision with Local Governments,<lb/> alongside developing a social clause niche/quota social enterprise in procurement contracts;<lb/></p>

			<p> developing a coherent framework and strategy for integrating the diversity of support measures<lb/> and potential support; and,<lb/>  co-ordinating donor communities (international and private sector) in a strategy to support social<lb/> entrepreneurship, and capacity building of NGOs towards social enterprise, through co-ordinated<lb/> action of relevant Sector Working Groups.<lb/></p>

			<head>Recommendations to Improve the Institutionalisation of the New Social Enterprise Sector<lb/></head>

			<p> for the emerging networks of social entrepreneurship, help develop governance structures that<lb/> give a prominent place to new social enterprise; and,<lb/>  strengthen the relationship between the new and the established social enterprise sectors, for<lb/> example through a chamber of commerce type model.<lb/></p>

			<head>Recommendations to Improve the Development of the Institutions of the Established Social Enterprise<lb/> Sector<lb/></head>

			<p> develop the capacity of NGOs, particularly of medium and large NGOs, to generate income<lb/> streams and engage in welfare service provision and procurement contracts (such as the UK<lb/> Futurebuilders programme mentioned below);<lb/>  explore the extent to which foundations could be a useful interim structure for social enterprise,<lb/> and, support medium and large foundations to develop brands and donation potential – possibly<lb/> through partnership with international charitable organisations;<lb/>  build the entrepreneurial capacity of new co-operatives, such as through development bodies; and<lb/> federal structures (also to promote good practices in governance, etc.); and,<lb/>  with regard to companies for the disabled, address the issue of delayed payments and, at the same<lb/> time, undertake a review of their performance with regard to the effective integration of disabled<lb/> people into work.<lb/></p>

			<head>Recommendations to Improve Business Support Infrastructure<lb/></head>

			<p> ensure that social enterprises have full access to SME programmes of support at national and<lb/> local levels;<lb/>  develop the capacity for &quot; braided &quot; 4 support of social enterprise, for example by developing a<lb/> network of social enterprise trainers; and,<lb/>  make full use of available EU funding streams to establish projects for the development of social<lb/> enterprise (including training/education at various levels).<lb/></p>

			<head>Recommendations to Improve Governance<lb/></head>

			<p> develop good practice partnership projects between municipalities and social enterprise, such as<lb/> with EU funding for developing good practice in the use of social clauses for social<lb/> entrepreneurship in welfare provision;<lb/></p>

			<p> consider support for the development of a social economy coalition that brings together NGOs,<lb/> foundations and co-operatives, initially at the municipal level through the development of<lb/> horizontal networks across these pillars of the social economy with EU programme funding; and,<lb/>  improve vertical and horizontal policy integration for social entrepreneurship through briefing<lb/> documents and administrative guidelines;<lb/>  capacity building, communication, education and training of relevant administrative officials<lb/> about relevant policy frameworks; and,<lb/>  gradually develop a system of co-governance with municipal and regional bodies together with<lb/> social economy organisations.<lb/></p>

			<head>Recommendations to Improve Finance<lb/></head>

			<p>Design a comprehensive framework of financial institutions and instruments to support the different<lb/> phases of social enterprise development, including:<lb/></p>

				<formula></formula>

			<table>link activities/support from Budget and Lottery Funds enabling access for NGOs, social<lb/> enterprises and companies for the disabled;<lb/>  measures to address the conservative attitude of banks, possibly through government-sponsored<lb/> loan guarantee systems;<lb/>  promote legislation to establish a comprehensive framework for micro-finance, so that it does not<lb/> need to be channelled through the banks and is appropriately regulated in line with international<lb/> experience;<lb/>  develop a comprehensive framework to support the financial needs of social entrepreneurs during<lb/> start-up, development and growth of social enterprise;<lb/>  design a system of grants for feasibility studies and the development of business plans, low cost<lb/> rents in incubators for the first 18 months of business development, loan guarantee systems, and<lb/> specialist financial institutions to act in a venture capitalist type role supporting growth of the<lb/> social enterprise;<lb/>  consider programmes to support social entrepreneurs, such as funding through a foundation;<lb/> (with a possible endowment through international donor/CSR partnership);<lb/>  consider the development of community development finance initiatives (supported through<lb/> fiscal measures); and,<lb/>  examine asset transfer policies by municipalities and other public bodies to provide buildings for<lb/> low rent incubators.<lb/></table>

			<head>INTRODUCTION<lb/></head>

			<p>This report initially provides a summary of the context for social entrepreneurship in Serbia, before<lb/> examining the institutional framework and policies for social entrepreneurship. It is structured thematically<lb/> drawing on extensive experience of the OECD LEED Programme which has identified six key themes:<lb/> preconditions, infrastructure including legal frameworks, governance policy, finance, skills, and access to<lb/> markets. A SWOT analysis completes this section of the report. There follow policy recommendations and<lb/> an action plan to provide a staged approach of recommended actions concerned with promoting and<lb/> developing an appropriate framework for social entrepreneurship in Serbia.<lb/> The focus of the study is on policy and institutional frameworks for supporting the development of<lb/> social entrepreneurship and social enterprise. Social entrepreneurship refers to the creation of social<lb/> enterprise, which is both the more socially oriented and the more entrepreneurial part of the social<lb/> economy – that sector of society operating between the private market led business operating in the market<lb/> and the state – comprising co-operatives, mutuals and associations (not-for-profit or voluntary<lb/> organisations) and foundations.<lb/> A significant feature of this study is that it draws extensively on a wide range of international<lb/> experiences as a comparator for critical analysis of the current policy framework and experiences.<lb/> However, this international experience should in no way be considered as providing models for<lb/> implementation, rather they are an inspiration for policy solutions that are uniquely adapted to the Serbian<lb/> context, and which are developed through appropriate consultation processes with a diverse range of<lb/> stakeholders.<lb/></p>

			<p>The key challenges addressed in this study relate to the how social entrepreneurship can help address<lb/> some of the issues it faces as it comes out of a turbulent period of its history, and moves forward with<lb/> democratic and market reforms towards EU membership.<lb/></p>

			<p>The recent of history in Serbia has been rather difficult – the break-up of the former Yugoslavia, and<lb/> ensuing conflicts, UN sanctions, and the end of the Milosevic regime in October 2000, followed by the<lb/> lifting of EU/US economic sanctions; and then further political adjustment as Montenegro became<lb/> independent in 2006. The war and international isolation led to an extended current economic crisis (with<lb/> hyperinflation during the 1990s) all of which posed considerable challenges to Serbian government policy,<lb/> but the country enjoyed a period of high growth during the first few years after sanctions ended (with GDP<lb/> growth averaging just over 6% p.a. from 2000-2008). However, the world economic crisis has had a major<lb/> impact, with a gradual process of recovery underway as the country, and its people, move towards full<lb/> membership of the European Union.<lb/></p>

			<p>The report firstly analyses the current context in Serbia relevant to major issues of social inclusion,<lb/> employment, and the development of civil society; secondly, it highlights the distinctive contribution that<lb/> may be made by social entrepreneurship and social enterprise alongside classic measures for reinvigorating<lb/> the market and reconstructing the role of the state; and, thirdly it reviews the policy framework in order to<lb/> specify ways in which this could be made more conducive to vigorous development of social<lb/> entrepreneurship. International experience confirms that appropriate policies to stimulate the social<lb/> economy, can play an important role not only in providing a diverse ecosystem of organisations and actors,<lb/> but also in improving the performance of the other main pillars of policy: the state and the market.<lb/></p>

			<head>CHAPTER 1: CONTEXT<lb/></head>

			<p>This Chapter briefly reviews historical and current perspectives on the socio-economic situation in<lb/> Serbia, the current landscape of social entrepreneurship, and its benefits, so that the thematic analysis of<lb/> the main part of the report can be contextualised.<lb/></p>

			<head>Historical and Current Perspective<lb/></head>

			<p>In the recent transitional phase of development during the last decade, Serbia has made important<lb/> steps towards democracy and the market economy, in terms of economic political and institutional reforms.<lb/> Prior to the recent economic crisis growth was good, but GDP declined by just under five per cent in the<lb/> two years after the 2008 crisis. Government expenditure is high and debt (both public and private) is a<lb/> concern, although Serbia&apos;s credit rating improved during this period. These factors conspired to bring about<lb/> a visit from the International Monetary Fund in early February 2012. With growth in 2012 anticipated to be<lb/> only half a percent, and with rising unemployment (22.4% in October, 2012, LFS), there is concern about<lb/> the fiscal deficit being higher than the target of a 2012 budget; particularly when public debt is projected to<lb/> be above 45% of GDP by the end of 2012. A return visit by the IMF is scheduled to discuss a<lb/> supplementary budget for fiscal consolidation and growth enhancing structural reforms (<ref type="biblio">Economist<lb/> Intelligence Unit, 2012</ref>).<lb/> Government is structured as follows: National, Provincial, County, and Municipal or local self-<lb/>government levels. One important public administration reform is programme budgeting – in 2005, five<lb/> ministries began the pilot process of moving towards programme budgeting (which will be fully adopted<lb/> for the 2015 Budget process), as a way of improving policy analysis and strategic input into the budgeting<lb/> process, as well as improving non-financial performance information.<lb/> The service sector has grown substantially, particularly in the financial services sector. However,<lb/> there has been stagnation in the manufacturing sector; although foreign direct investment in manufacturing<lb/> has picked up more recently a key issue is that of raising quality standards, particularly for the export<lb/> markets. The agricultural sector is important in Serbia (around 20% of GDP), but it is weak and not very<lb/> competitive. Nevertheless, the World Bank (2006) regards it as having considerable potential as an engine<lb/> of growth in Serbia.<lb/></p>

			<p>The privatisation programme has been extensive, particularly through foreign direct investment in<lb/> finance, transport, storage, communication, and manufacturing (EUR 12 billion between 2001 and 2009)<lb/> (Government of the Republic of Serbia European Integration Office, 2011). But according to the National<lb/> Programme for Integration of Serbia into the EU, further privatisation needs to be carried out, including<lb/> that of state and socially owned organisations (Government of the Republic of Serbia European Integration<lb/> <ref type="biblio">Office, 2011</ref>). This might include state-owned tourist offices and most companies with socially owned<lb/> capital.<lb/></p>

			<head>SME Policy<lb/></head>

			<p>Serbia has made major improvements to its SME environment, and in the last decade has seen<lb/> substantial growth in the sector (OECD, 2011). However, this was based on excessive public and personal<lb/> consumption, with increasing differences in regional development evident, alongside a trend to de-<lb/>industrialisation, and there has been a decline in jobs in the sector after the 2008 crisis. There are also still<lb/> some competition issues to be addressed, particularly where powerful companies dominate markets. It is<lb/> argued that future growth and policy needs to be more strategic, focusing on competitive and innovative<lb/> SME potential for growth (<ref type="biblio">Hadzic and Pavlović, 2011</ref>). Moreover, the development of the sector also<lb/> relies on further improvements to its institutional environment: in the recent Global Competitiveness<lb/> Report (<ref type="biblio">Word Economic Forum, 2011</ref>) Serbia ranks particularly low on the quality and efficiency of its<lb/> institutional environment, its macroeconomic environment, goods market efficiency, and business<lb/> sophistication. It ranks relatively highly on its higher education, health and primary education (with<lb/> relatively high rankings on the following subsidiary items: telephone lines, internet bandwidth, and time to<lb/> register a business).<lb/></p>

			<p>The SME sector accounts for two-thirds of all employees and is skewed towards micro-enterprises.<lb/> Other important issues that need addressing are excessive red tape and an excessive administrative burden,<lb/> complex legislation, and a lack of enforcement of business regulation. SMEs also confront inadequate<lb/> access to financial resources and the lack of appropriate financial instruments – these result in low levels of<lb/> investment in innovation (Government of the Republic of Serbia European Integration Office, 2011). This<lb/> is despite measures by Ministry of Finance and Economy and the National Agency for Regional<lb/> Development to put in place a number of programs to strengthen SMEs.<lb/></p>

			<p>Despite a good GDP growth trend until the recent crisis, this has not led to lower levels of<lb/> unemployment and a better employment rate – in fact the reverse has occurred, and Serbia currently has an<lb/> extremely low employment rate at below 50%. Of particular concern is youth unemployment and their<lb/> employment rate. The IMF estimates that the unemployment rate (15-64) will peak at 23.9% in 2012,<lb/> before declining to 21.5% in 2015 (<ref type="biblio">International Monetary Fund, 2011</ref>); whilst for young people (15-24)<lb/> the optimistic projection is for the estimated rate of 37.4% (2012) to decline to 31.5% by 2015<lb/> (<ref type="biblio">Arandarenko, 2010</ref>). In addition long-term unemployment remained static during this recent decade, the<lb/> inactivity rate of 40.3% (2012) is amongst the highest in Europe 5 , and a substantial number of people still<lb/> operate within the informal sector (estimated to be about one third of the total employment). There is some<lb/> evidence, in manufacturing, that this paradox of good growth but declining employment may be due to the<lb/> working through of underemployment in many firms and the increased productivity of continuing<lb/> employed workers in increasingly competitive national and international markets.<lb/> The Serbian government has attempted to reform its labour markets through various measures to<lb/> improve labour market flexibility, including reducing social contributions to remove obstacles to new<lb/> employment, introducing active labour market programmes (ALMPs – which form only a minority of<lb/> expenditure), and providing support programmes for redundant workers. However, in a later measure<lb/> intended to conform more closely to EU labour market regimes, the Government also increased<lb/> substantially the level of redundancy payments and thus, to a certain extent, countered earlier measures to<lb/> increase labour flexibility. It should also be noted that there have been budgetary constraints on the flexible<lb/> labour market policies, thus for example the ALMP budget was only 0.110% of <ref type="biblio">GDP in 2009, 0</ref>.128% in<lb/> 2010, and 0.123% in 2011.<lb/> The main elements of ALMPs are job-matching, counselling, and development of entrepreneurship<lb/> and employment programs (employment subsidies) – but training programmes are insufficiently developed<lb/> and targeted in the National Employment Service programme (Government of the Republic of Serbia,<lb/> 2011). Funds for the Public Works Programme were doubled in 2009 to help address the crisis and led to<lb/> the employment of about 10,000 people.<lb/></table>

			<head>Social Inclusion<lb/></head>

			<p>During the growth period of the last decade, progress was made in rural and urban areas in combating<lb/> poverty – thus as a result of economic growth absolute poverty declined, but this was also due to poverty<lb/> reduction measures (although the Gini coefficient, a measure of inequality, typically of income<lb/> distribution, increased). The poverty reduction measures comprised social welfare cash benefits (with the<lb/> major ones means tested) and social welfare services. The Centres for Social Work are largely responsible<lb/> for implementing the social protection measures, identifying needs, and matching them with community-<lb/>based services. Over half the municipalities funded day care services for elderly homecare and/or<lb/> childcare; and there are a few non-profit providers, including the Red Cross and Caritas. Social inclusion<lb/> policy benefits from inter-ministerial co-ordination through the Social Inclusion and Poverty Reduction<lb/> Unit and this can bring an important value in terms of the coherence of policies to reduce social exclusion.<lb/> The current legislation clearly establishes a framework for a European style support system, where the<lb/> state is the major player, with only the limited development of a mixed economy of provision so far.<lb/></p>

			<p>Other issues relevant to social inclusion include policies for Roma, refugees and internally displaced<lb/> people, and disabled people. Based on the Serbian 2011 Census, there were 147,604 Roma in Serbia, but<lb/> estimates from NGOs and international organisations put the figure between 300,000 and 460,000, that is<lb/> around 5% of the population (<ref type="biblio">Bodewig and Sethis (2005)</ref>; Report of the OSCE-ODHIR <ref type="biblio">Roundtable<lb/> (2010)</ref>). There are substantial numbers of refugees (70,707), and around 228,215 internally displaced<lb/> people in Serbia (UNHCR, January 2012 http://www.unhcr.org/pages/49e48d9f6.html); many of these face<lb/> problems of housing and employment. The example of RISE in the UK (Box 1) highlights the potential of<lb/> the social economy in addressing such issues.<lb/> enterprise, social entrepreneurship, and the social economy, face considerable difficulties in establishing<lb/> their hard-won credentials in the mind&apos;s eye of many Serbs. The OECD research team heard that it was a<lb/> common Serbian view that they had done the &quot; social economy &quot; unsuccessfully, and consequently there<lb/> was a fear about returning to the past; that the social economy could be confused with passive social<lb/> support and active labour market programmes; and that old social enterprises, such as agricultural co-<lb/>operatives, are regarded as informally privatised. But it was also recognised that a clear definition of social<lb/> enterprise would help re-establish the value of the social entrepreneurship approach.<lb/> In this context it is worth mentioning that this is not unique to Serbia, but is a common issue in<lb/> many formerly socialist countries. However, this should not detract from the internationally recognised<lb/> contribution of social economy organisations.<lb/> Note that a wide variety of legal forms are used by social enterprises in Serbia; these will be placed<lb/> within the traditional typology of the social economy – CMAF (co-operatives, mutuals, associations,<lb/> foundations) – or related to other boundary categories. This report continues by examining how this<lb/> framework of social entrepreneurship/social economy can be applied to the Serbian context, using<lb/> terminology that seems most relevant to the Serbian situation – as background, it may be interesting to<lb/> review the work of the EMES Network in a study for UNDP which included an extensive case study on<lb/> Serbia (EMES, 2008).<lb/></p>

			<head>Companies for the Disabled<lb/></head>

			<p>These are the only officially recognised legal form of social enterprise in Serbia; they comprise about<lb/> 40 companies for vocational rehabilitation and employment of people with disabilities. They employ 1700<lb/> people and are supported through the Budget Fund. About half of these are majority state owned, and half<lb/> privately owned. At least 50% of employees should have disabilities, including 10% with severe<lb/> disabilities. During the study visits it was reported to the OECD team that there were some issues about<lb/> late payments for disabled people working in these companies; this appears to be due to a clause in the law<lb/> which refers to refunds rather than subsidies; this has the effect of inhibiting employment, as well as<lb/> creating ambiguities about eligibility for refunds for those that have been employed. However there could<lb/> also be issues about establishing a framework for monitoring and rewarding progress to sustainability.<lb/></p>

			<head>Non-Profit Organisations/Associations/NGOs<lb/></head>

			<p>The term NGO is the term most commonly encountered by the OECD team to describe different<lb/> forms of non-profit organisations, such as associations and civil society organisations. Associations are<lb/> documented in the statistics and comprise a diverse range of more than 15,000 organisations (registered<lb/> under the new law by August 2011), with a further 2000 in the process of registering (although originally<lb/> there were 28,500 in the statistics), including a large number of sports clubs, and others covering<lb/> humanitarian issues, community development, culture and arts, education and research, environment, and<lb/> religious organisations, etc. 6<lb/> A survey of NGOs in <ref type="biblio">Serbia in 2005 (Civic Initiatives, 2005</ref>) noted a number of problems, including:<lb/> a lack of state support and the withdrawal of international donors, but also inadequate co-operation with<lb/> the business community, barriers in the legal regulations, and insufficient co-operation with local<lb/> authorities, etc. More recently public trust was cited as an issue, with a call for: &quot; More transparent work,<lb/> including a clearer presentation of goals and activities, but also of financing and the way NGOs &apos;earn&apos; and<lb/> spend their money would certainly help improve their relations to the public &quot; (<ref type="biblio">Bertelsmann Stiftung,<lb/> 2011</ref>).<lb/> The recent Law on Associations (adopted in 2009) has improved some of the issues, by establishing a<lb/> legislative framework closer to international standards and regional best practices, and this may lead to a<lb/> more accurate and up-to-date record of their activities, but it seems only a small proportion of these are<lb/> engaged in social entrepreneurial activities. A recent survey (Civil Initiatives in conjunction with Office for<lb/> Co-operation with Civil Society of the Government of Serbia, 2011) of &quot; civil society organisations &quot; &apos;<lb/> (based on the Register of Citizens Associations, which was established by the Law on Associations in<lb/> 2009) used a different classification of activity and found over a quarter in the field of social services –<lb/> many of which are likely to be older associations of disadvantaged groups. Most of the organisations<lb/> surveyed are small with low levels of income mainly from donations and membership/service fees.<lb/> NGOs already have a presence in welfare provision, particularly in the field of children and youth<lb/> with disabilities – the Lottery Fund plays an important funding role. Despite the small size and weak<lb/> capacity, NGOs are developing further in welfare service provision (a field currently dominated by state<lb/> providers), albeit partly through the enthusiasm of international donors; however capacity building<lb/> measures would be required to increase the trust and confidence of municipalities to the point where they<lb/> are ready to contract with them. Donor project funding, and previously the use of the Social Innovation<lb/> Fund 7 are assisting this process of capacity building. Larger non-profit organisations, such as Caritas and<lb/> the Ecumenical Humanitarian Organisation, are also active in the field of welfare service provision, whilst<lb/> as yet the private sector appears limited to nursing homes for the elderly.<lb/> Similarly new integrated policies for these groups combining labour market measures with social<lb/> protection measures, currently through pilot programmes and project funding (from international donors,<lb/> and within the framework of the National Action Plan for Employment for 2012), are opening the field for<lb/> innovative NGO activity (e.g. the YEM project mentioned below) – particularly in recycling and waste<lb/> management.<lb/></p>

			<head>Foundations and Charitable Trusts<lb/></head>

			<p>This type of organisation has also benefited from the wave of legislative reforms recently enacted to<lb/> modernise civil society, and open some options for social entrepreneurship. The Law on Charitable Trusts<lb/> and Foundations was passed in 2010 and appropriately registered. Prior to this there were only about 50<lb/> active charitable trusts, and currently there are around 90 foundations (active, registering, or adapting to<lb/> the new law).<lb/> Thus, this form of organisation has not proved so popular as a vehicle for social entrepreneurship in<lb/> Serbia. It remains to be seen whether the new legislation will herald increased use of this form, a trend<lb/> apparent in some Eastern European countries – for example in Poland, where they form about one quarter<lb/> of potential social enterprise, as &quot; this status is more convenient for commercially oriented organisations &quot;<lb/> (<ref type="biblio">EMES, 2008</ref>); this includes the renowned Barka Foundation.<lb/></p>

			<head>Co-operatives<lb/></head>

			<p>Data from Satellite Accounts for Co-operative Economy in Serbia (2009) indicates that there was a<lb/> total of 2126 co-operatives, and 18 co-operative unions, and that there has been a general decline in<lb/> numbers of co-operatives, members and employees over a number of years prior to that. Co-operatives<lb/> (and co-operative unions) declined from 2337 in 2007 to 2140 in 2009 and the number of co-operative<lb/> members declined from 125551 in 2007 to 122192 in 2009. Most of these were agricultural co-operatives,<lb/> followed by youth and student co-operatives, followed by housing.<lb/> Co-operatives suffer from a poor reputation for a number of reasons. During the post-socialist period<lb/> many have lost or have been unable to re-establish active membership, and in the process ownership has<lb/> fallen into the hands of a few members and directors – with the result that they operate like conventional<lb/> for-profit business, and thus may be ambiguously seen as pseudo-co-operatives. It was suggested during<lb/> the study visit, that this appears to have happened in the more established agricultural co-operatives, yet it<lb/> has not prevented substantial numbers of new co-operatives being formed, partly as a result of donor<lb/> support, but these suffer the problems of being in a developmental phase, being small with a lack of<lb/> capital. The youth and student co-operatives, which in effect are a job matching service which benefits<lb/> from tax advantages, seem to have suffered a similar fate, with young people more interested in getting<lb/> casual/short term work rather than regaining their membership rights. The third largest segment of the co-<lb/>operative sector, housing co-operatives, seem to have also been exploited by managers and building<lb/> companies to the detriment of members. On the other hand there are some positive signs which could be<lb/> built on – in their survey of 239 co-operatives, <ref type="biblio">Simmons et al. (2009)</ref> report that two thirds of the co-<lb/>operatives in their sample thought themselves very democratic; and other indicators of member<lb/> involvement were reported – indeed in 60% of co-operatives, members felt the co-operative had helped<lb/> raise their incomes. But there are a number of barriers to improving their capacity – credit co-operatives<lb/> are illegal (being in a similar position to micro-finance), co-operative unions are not fully controlled by<lb/> member co-operatives, and secondary co-operatives are not allowed – so limiting the potential for co-<lb/>operatives moving up the value chain – a development which might also increase competition in food<lb/> processing, where high price hikes by a &quot; processed food oligopoly &quot; have been reported (EBRD, 2011).<lb/></p>

			<p>Unlike other parts of the social economy, co-operatives have not enjoyed modernisation of their legal<lb/> framework. This is largely due to the lack of resolution of problems associated with the restitution of<lb/> socially owned assets to members, co-operatives, or the state. This is blocking acceptance of the proposed<lb/> new law on co-operatives which would allow the development of social co-operatives. Also with reforms<lb/> and better organisation, they could contribute much more to rural development in deprived areas, and<lb/> Serbian agricultural output (currently only 20% is produced for the market, compared to 80% for<lb/> subsistence).<lb/></p>

			<head>Quasi-social enterprise using company structures<lb/></head>

			<p>In many countries it is not unusual for the dominant business form (limited company) to be used also<lb/> for social entrepreneurship. This is particularly the case where the concept of social enterprise and social<lb/> entrepreneurship is not generally recognised or institutionalised. The privatisation law reinforced this<lb/> tendency by insisting that privatisations were required to transform into joint stock companies, even if their<lb/> social mission would be better adapted to some form of social enterprise – for example Rudo, a<lb/> manufacturer of orthopaedic appliances. Ambiguities and uncertainties about the choice of business form<lb/> were seen by the OECD team in interviews with social entrepreneurs relating to &quot; Green and Clean &quot; , a<lb/> commercial cleaning company established by two social economy organisations, which seems to be a<lb/> social enterprise. Such hybrid structures appear to be common where foundations or NGOs wholly owned<lb/> a trading subsidiary, thereby combining social mission with economic activity.<lb/></p>

			<head>Emerging social enterprise (informal sector)<lb/></head>

			<p>Social enterprises often play a role in moving informal sector workers into the formal economy. In<lb/> some cases this may involve enterprises that act as agencies for people who are self-employed and who<lb/> may or may not pay taxes (that is, they may in effect remain part of the informal sector). But this mixed<lb/> mode of operation seems more common in the conventional business sector, where for example an SME<lb/> may employ its cleaners from the informal sector, in effect employing them illegally. Thus, emerging<lb/> social enterprise attempting to operate by formally employing people may face this kind of unfair<lb/> competition – as reported to the OECD team with regard to &quot; Green and Clean &quot; social enterprise. Similarly<lb/> social enterprise could employ disadvantaged workers illegally or as self-employed workers, but choosing<lb/> to employ them legal, may result in losing a competitive advantage – unless the illegal informal<lb/> employment is addressed (see Box 2).<lb/></p>

			<head>Box 2. Social Entrepreneurship for the informal sector<lb/></head>

			<p>It is clear that in many countries there is a lot of entrepreneurship in the informal sector. The challenge for policy-<lb/>makers is to regulate this, to recognise such activity can generate essential income in disadvantaged communities, but<lb/> also to channel its dynamism towards the formal sector where it can be more easily supported. There are a number of<lb/> social entrepreneurship initiatives which have facilitated such developments: Local Exchange Trading Systems (LETS)<lb/> allow people to build up entrepreneurial activity by trading informally before they go formal. See:<lb/> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_exchange_trading_system. Other initiatives led by trade unions help provide<lb/> services to support self-employed workers such as health insurance schemes.<lb/> In Serbia, the project SWIFT (Sustainable Waste Management Initiative for a Healthier Tomorrow) illustrates an<lb/> innovative path for assisting disadvantaged Roma in the informal sector. It has received substantial international and<lb/> national support to develop a recycling centre and co-operative (at the end of 2010) to provide work and training for<lb/> disadvantaged workers, through recycling and waste management; and it is also linked with the Belgrade waste<lb/> management system. SWIFT&apos;s overall objective is to convert current informal waste &quot; scavenging &quot; into an effective<lb/> source of income; a secondary objective is to increase access of their workers from vulnerable populations and<lb/> communities to health, education and social services; and indirectly enable better access to public services and<lb/> integration in civil society in general. It has yet to achieve sustainability, but indicates the kind of innovation which is<lb/> needed to improve the position of disadvantaged informal sector workers.<lb/> Source : http://www.swift.rs/eng<lb/></p>

			<head>Benefits of Social Entrepreneurship<lb/></head>

			<p>This section emphasises the benefits of pursuing policies to support social entrepreneurship, such as<lb/> the way in which it builds on a self-help dynamic for jobs/services, develops social capital, helps<lb/> strengthen civil society, is an essential part of an inclusion strategy; and contributes to local economic<lb/> development, etc.<lb/> Social enterprises are considered to operate more flexibly than the public sector, and have a trust<lb/> advantage over for-profits (<ref type="biblio">Spear, 2004</ref>); this is because their structure means they are not designed to<lb/> make private profit from addressing social problems, and they typically provide various externalities that<lb/> add social value to an economic exchange. These added values are due to their typical operating<lb/> characteristics: participative structures giving users and staff greater involvement (as well as supporting<lb/> active citizenship), multi-stakeholder structures providing more social cohesion, and proximity services<lb/> (locally based, close to users and the community).<lb/></p>

			<p>The benefits of social entrepreneurship can also be seen in policy, where several policy themes<lb/> emphasise the value of social enterprise and social entrepreneurship:<lb/></p>

			<p> Employment and economic competitiveness – social enterprises contribute to help build an<lb/> enterprise society in which small firms of all kinds thrive and reduce the persistent gap in growth<lb/> rates between regions. They are an important source of entrepreneurship and jobs, particularly<lb/> for more disadvantaged individuals and communities, where they help to develop a self-help<lb/> dynamic.<lb/></p>

			<head> Social inclusion and social cohesion</head>

			<p>– social enterprises, through multi-stakeholder structures<lb/> and user involvement, help build social cohesion and provide a strong basis for self-help,<lb/> assisting both economic and social development of disadvantaged communities in urban and rural<lb/> areas.<lb/></p>

			<head> Social capital</head>

			<p>– social economy organisations build trust relations and civic engagement leading<lb/> to a more involved and active citizenship – this is because they are typically membership<lb/> organisations linking people together in democratic structures; and they often have multi-<lb/>stakeholder governance systems which help strengthen inter-group relations. It is widely<lb/> recognised that building trust makes the whole economy and society function better.<lb/></p>

			<head> Service provision</head>

			<p>– social economy organisations improve the quality and efficiency of<lb/> (public/welfare) service delivery, through greater trust, proximity to users, and through their<lb/> social mission.<lb/></p>

			<p>And there are two market rationales that recognise the benefits of social enterprise:<lb/></p>

			<p> Service provision – social enterprise fill a gap in the market (addressing market failures) to meet<lb/> community needs or to add value to existing public service delivery.<lb/></p>

			<p> Social enterprise combine social and economic dimensions and are thereby uniquely placed to<lb/> support the rise of new ethical markets; in fair trade and environmentally friendly goods and<lb/> services.<lb/></p>

			<p>In terms of European policy debate, it is also recognised that social economy makes key contributions<lb/> to major policy themes: public services, general interest, social cohesion, and employment (e.g. <ref type="biblio">Ciriec,<lb/> 2007</ref>); and that it is central to certain values in welfare/health services that need to be preserved: values of<lb/> equality, solidarity, respect for human dignity, and the principles of accessibility, universal service,<lb/> continuity, proximity to service users (user involvement). Further emphasis on some of these themes was<lb/> seen in the EU Social Business Initiative, launched in October 2011. Three themes were emphasised:<lb/> encouraging responsible business through better corporate social responsibility, including more<lb/> transparency and accountability, and facilitating social entrepreneurship, particularly through social<lb/> investment; and cutting red tape for SMEs. The Social Business Initiative was launched because it was<lb/> argued that social business would contribute to EU2020 strategy, by developing inclusive growth (through<lb/> sustainable jobs, work integration, better quality of social and healthcare services), moving towards<lb/> sustainable growth (by reducing emissions and waste, and using natural resources and energy more<lb/> efficiently), and developing smart growth (through innovation and participatory internet use). See Annex 1<lb/> for more details.<lb/> It is also important to locate policy for social enterprise within meta-narratives of policy discourse,<lb/> which locate their benefits in a wider framework. Thus for example in the UK, the Labour Government<lb/> under Tony <ref type="biblio">Blair (1997-2007</ref>) pursued the so-called &quot; Third Way &quot; had a broad societal agenda aimed at<lb/> the renewal of social democracy, with an emphasis on social justice, but strongly emphasising the market;<lb/> it also provided legitimacy and laid the foundations for subsequent policy on social enterprise.<lb/> In Europe, social enterprises operate in a number of fields, and legislation has been used in a number<lb/> of countries to give recognition and support development of this emerging field: Work Integration Social<lb/> Enterprise (WISE) have become increasingly recognised in legislation as an area of social enterprise<lb/> effectiveness. However, social enterprises have also gained recognition in legislation in service provision:<lb/> proximity/community services, health/social services, and in recent Italian legislation, even more broadly<lb/> in social utility: which includes environmental/ecological activities, culture, heritage, social tourism,<lb/> research, and education. With regard to model legislation, the Italian social co-operatives have been a<lb/> model in many countries. These are classified as two types: type A for social services and type B for labour<lb/> market or work integration services; and the 2006 legislation for social enterprise is a model for a broader<lb/> range of services (aiming for social utility).<lb/> However, it is clear that there is varying effectiveness of different legislations – with widely varying<lb/> numbers of registrations. The reasons appear to be: overly restrictive requirements or the new legislation<lb/> does not provide sufficient advantage compared to relevant existing legislation. Thus, for example,<lb/> relatively few have been formed in each of the following countries: Greece, France, Finland, and Sweden<lb/> (where the &quot; Firm with Limited Profit Distribution &quot; (2006) has attracted little interest). The most popular<lb/> structures are in Italy and the UK. In many countries it is still the case that most social enterprise use the<lb/> most flexible legal form available – for example: in Belgium, the non-profit (association sans but<lb/> lucrative, a.s.b.l.), and in Sweden, the co-operative.<lb/></p>

			<p>Accordingly, when considering the need for new legislation for social enterprise it is important to<lb/> consider: fields of activities, its adaptability/flexibility, effectiveness of current legislation, regulatory<lb/> framework; and it is noteworthy that one rationale for legislation is to gain an increased recognition of<lb/> social enterprises as a &quot; brand &quot; .<lb/></p>

			<head>Brief Summary<lb/></head>

			<p>Serbia has emerged from a turbulent period of its history and made important progress towards<lb/> democracy and a market economy. Unfortunately the global economic crisis has brought new problems of<lb/> stagnation with high public and private debt and increasing unemployment. Numerous political, economic,<lb/> and institutional reforms have been carried out, but further structural reforms or required, including:<lb/> administrative reforms, addressing corruption in procurement, further privatisation, measures to strengthen<lb/> SMEs and the agricultural sector, which include better access to bank finance, and improving the<lb/> functioning of micro-finance -so that jobs can be created and entrepreneurship supported. This is<lb/> particularly important because the employment rate is low amongst young people, and there are a variety<lb/> of groups facing social exclusion (including Roma, people with disabilities, and refugees and internally<lb/> displaced people), together with considerable regional disparities; and there is a substantial informal<lb/> economy. Thus, entrepreneurship and work integration need to be more fully addressed. A return visit by<lb/> the IMF, and the programme of reforms leading to EU accession, will both increase pressure for these<lb/> reforms.<lb/></p>

			<p>Despite some cultural barriers in Serbia, social entrepreneurship could make an important contribution<lb/> to many of these areas, as it has in many other countries in Europe – through work integration for<lb/> employment and social inclusion, through more socially cohesive welfare services, and through its<lb/> contributions to civil society by building trust and social capital. The context for social entrepreneurship<lb/> has been considerably enhanced through a wide range of institutional reforms, but despite legislative<lb/> reforms, each of the legal structures relevant to social entrepreneurship face some difficulties. So far the<lb/> opportunities for social entrepreneurship have been rather limited with some work integration initiatives<lb/> and some welfare service provision, albeit within a framework of rather limited access to public<lb/> procurement markets. This provides clear indications of the potential of social entrepreneurship, but in<lb/> order to develop a more sustainable sector more needs to be done if that potential is to be fulfilled. The<lb/> emerging networks supporting social entrepreneurship, though weak, are energetic and capable, and with<lb/> some focused government support there is some optimism for the future.<lb/></p>

			<head>CHAPTER 2: INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK AND POLICIES: PRE-CONDITIONS,<lb/> INFRASTRUCTURE AND GOVERNANCE<lb/></head>

			<p>The next two chapters in this analysis are structured around six themes. This chapter addresses:<lb/> Preconditions, Infrastructure and Governance; whilst the following chapter addresses: Finance, Access to<lb/> Markets, and Skills. This chapter begins with an overall assessment of existing measures and policies and<lb/> their effectiveness, challenges, barriers, and issues for development before moving into the first three<lb/> themes: Pre-conditions, Infrastructure, and Governance.<lb/></p>

			<p>The opening section of this report provided a brief overview of the main policy contexts relevant to<lb/> the development of social entrepreneurship in Serbia. The major policy areas which link with social<lb/> enterprise are: labour market policy, social inclusion policy, and welfare service policy. However, social<lb/> enterprise can make important contributions in other areas of the economy and society; in Serbia these<lb/> include agriculture, rural development and the environment. In addition, appropriate policy for social<lb/> enterprise needs to integrate with SME policy and as a result touches on financial services policy.<lb/></p>

			<p>In general terms, Serbia has taken an impressive number of measures to establish a modern<lb/> framework for the development of social entrepreneurship. This applies particularly to laying the<lb/> foundations of that development through appropriate legislative measures, such as new laws for<lb/> foundations and associations. It has also made important strides in developing national institutions which<lb/> can co-ordinate policy and the development of the sector. However, the sector is still weak and emerging in<lb/> an environment which, if not hostile, is not particularly supportive. At the same time, the institutional<lb/> framework while quite well developed at the national level still needs to be fully integrated so that it is<lb/> visible and operational for social enterprise on the ground. Policy and institutions also need to be<lb/> developed strategically and operationally to support the start-up of new social enterprise and capacity<lb/> building of existing social enterprise, nationally. Given this picture, and the considerable progress made in<lb/> overcoming the challenges of a recent difficult past, it would be surprising if there were not a number of<lb/> policy gaps and barriers to development that remain to be addressed. These will be discussed in more depth<lb/> below.<lb/></p>

			<head>Pre-conditions<lb/></head>

			<p>As noted in the introduction, the post-war era of Yugoslav socialism has left some unfavourable<lb/> legacies in the form of public distrust of forms of social ownership 8 , with the result that new initiatives of<lb/> social entrepreneurship, social enterprise and the social economy which are so highly valued in other parts<lb/> of Europe and the world, are either misunderstood or distrusted at the current time in Serbia; and this<lb/> applies even more so to co-operatives. Changing the cultural dimension of social enterprise and social<lb/> entrepreneurship is a key challenge.<lb/></p>

			<p>Another heritage of the Yugoslav era is a strong dependency on the state alongside strong distrust of<lb/> the state. Thus, there remains a strong belief among many people, including some met during the OECD<lb/> study visit, that when a social need has been articulated the next step is advocacy, persuasion, and<lb/> networking to get the state to provide. Indeed, the OECD team met in Novi Sad one potential social<lb/> entrepreneur with great drive and innovation who had established a project which transported people with<lb/> disabilities (to school, etc.), who vigorously proposed that the state should take this on as a regular service,<lb/> and equally vigorously rejected any thoughts that generating income from the project might facilitate that<lb/> development.<lb/></p>

			<p>In the context of recovering from the economic crisis all over Europe, and the forthcoming visit of the<lb/> IMF, budgetary constraints are likely to continue for several years and these aspirations for better welfare<lb/> services, labour market programmes, and social inclusion programmes will not be met without new<lb/> thinking about other strategies such as social entrepreneurship. Shifting this pattern of thinking towards<lb/> social entrepreneurship is clearly one challenge.<lb/> Developing an entrepreneurial culture has been an important theme in many countries since it was<lb/> recognised that growth, in particular job growth, relies strongly on the formation and development of small<lb/> and medium enterprises. Thus, entrepreneurship is an important theme in policy including through<lb/> education and training programmes (also in business schools), and through support measures for new<lb/> entrepreneurs.<lb/></p>

			<p>The scale of the informal sector, currently over 30% of the economy (<ref type="biblio">Bertelsmann Stiftung, 2011</ref>) and<lb/> apparently significantly higher in recent years, indicates that something entrepreneurial is happening. At<lb/> the same time, the skewing of SME activity towards micro-enterprise also reinforces the idea that the<lb/> challenge is firstly to support the formalisation of initiatives (bringing them into the formal economy), and<lb/> secondly in a parallel measure to support the strengthening of the micro-enterprises; identifying winners or<lb/> &quot; gazelles &quot; is also regarded as an important policy challenge.<lb/></p>

			<p>The Global Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM) studies provide a useful international comparative<lb/> perspective on the level of entrepreneurship in Serbia. As Radojevich-Kelley (2011) reports:<lb/> &quot; a recent GEM report (2009) indicates that Serbia is highly necessity driven as far as<lb/> entrepreneurship and relies heavily on established business ownership rather than on early stage,<lb/> nascent entrepreneurial activities (<ref type="biblio">Bosma and Levie, 2009</ref>). Over the past several years, Serbia<lb/> has seen a decline in the nascent entrepreneurship rate, new business ownership rates, early stage<lb/> entrepreneurship rates compared to other similar efficiency driven economies (<ref type="biblio">Bosma and Levie,<lb/> 2009</ref>). &quot;<lb/></p>

			<p>This is clearly a concern, although Radojevich-Kelley (2011) later in the same article argues that the tide<lb/> has turned and entrepreneurship is gaining ground in Serbia in the belief that it leads to a better life.<lb/></p>

			<p>Nonetheless, this climate is also likely to influence approaches to social entrepreneurship, and the<lb/> challenge is to change culture and attitudes both towards conventional entrepreneurship as well as to social<lb/> entrepreneurship. It is also important to recognise the importance of social entrepreneurship in addressing<lb/> socio-economic development, through different kinds of policy measures from start-up, from the informal<lb/> sector, and for growth. Arguments for developing policy for social entrepreneurship were recognised, for<lb/> example, by the British government at the time of the 2008 economic crisis when it awarded approximately<lb/> EUR 600 000 to the School for Social Entrepreneurs in order for it to build its capacity for training social<lb/> entrepreneurs (although the scale of this intervention may not be so relevant to the currently constrained<lb/> public budgets in Serbia).<lb/> Despite some impressive examples of social entrepreneurship, the OECD team encountered social<lb/> entrepreneurs who were not positive about their potential for development. This appeared to be partly due<lb/> to issues addressed in this chapter and the next (unfair competition with the informal sector, poor access to<lb/> procurement markets, etc.) but possibly also due to the need to establish realistic expectations of social<lb/> entrepreneurship in this time of economic crisis and budgetary restraint.<lb/></p>

			<p>There are other cultural issues that appear more linked to fundamental views about trust and fairness<lb/> in society. In other words the extent to which success and achievement can be seen as the result of hard<lb/> work, knowledge and skill, or the result of preferential treatment and good connections.<lb/></p>

			<head>Attitudes of Institutions to Social Entrepreneurship<lb/></head>

			<p>It is well documented that there are general issues about the banks&apos; relationship with SMEs in Serbia.<lb/> The situation is likely to be even more difficult for social enterprise, and it was stated to the OECD team<lb/> that legal recognition would help banks understand social enterprises better. There has been a large amount<lb/> of foreign direct investment into the financial services in the last decade, and the sector is now dominated<lb/> by international banks. It is notable that international banks can, through their corporate social<lb/> responsibility (CSR) programmes, be very supportive of social enterprise – as the example of Erste Bank in<lb/> Serbia demonstrates.<lb/> It was reported to the OECD team that multi-nationals operating in Serbia do not show the same level<lb/> of CSR generosity as in their headquarter country. This notwithstanding, there is some evidence of good<lb/> practices developing: the Global Compact Network in Serbia had 57 signatories (including 32 companies<lb/> and 17 NGOs) in 2010, with six working groups including one on CSR in banking and finance. Its current<lb/> focus appears rather limited: on financial education, and developing new products for the Serbian market<lb/> (green projects, charity donation savings scheme, affinity cards) and the working group for social inclusion<lb/> and persons with disabilities has developed partnerships between private sector and organisations for<lb/> people with disabilities. However, in a broad survey in 2006 (World Bank), financial services companies<lb/> (in Serbia and Montenegro) were the only ones that thought correcting social inequalities was a part of<lb/> CSR (and this was only supported by about 5% of the sample); nonetheless 83% had carried out social<lb/> projects in the previous three years, and about half of these were in partnership with NGOs. There are<lb/> some exemplary practices amongst international banks in Serbia: UniCredit Bank Serbia (third largest bank<lb/> in Serbia) and UniCredit Foundation support Group 484 and the social enterprise financing project<lb/> &quot; Financial and Technical Assistance for Sustainable Social Economy of Serbia &quot; . Crédit Agricole Serbia<lb/> has CSR projects supporting children&apos;s rights. But the shining example is Erste Bank which has a wide<lb/> range of projects supporting social entrepreneurship. The government strategy for taking CSR forward has<lb/> been established in the National Strategy on CSR 2010-2015, however its implementation is still in the<lb/> early phase, and it could be more closely oriented to social entrepreneurship, which is only mentioned once<lb/> in the draft document in relation to procurement supply chains (<ref type="biblio">Working Group, 2010</ref>).<lb/> As the above examples of exemplary practices demonstrate the procurement supply chain strategy,<lb/> while important, is not the only one of relevance to social entrepreneurship. At the same time, the supply<lb/> chain opportunity refers more generally to relations between SMEs and large companies not just in<lb/> procurement, but in the overall economy. Here it appears that there are insufficient linkages which make<lb/> use of the capabilities of SMEs in sub-contracting supply chains. This reduces the potential of SMEs to<lb/> develop a stronger position in the economy. This is also likely to limit the potential social enterprise<lb/> contract with larger companies (e.g. &quot; Green and Clean &quot; for cleaning services), and may influence CSR<lb/> related contracting too.<lb/> As far as the attitude of public institutions, especially at local level, such as in relation to policies<lb/> related to procurement, two issues were reported to the OECD team. Firstly, although there may be a<lb/> national policy framework relevant to social entrepreneurial activity, local officials did not necessarily<lb/> know about it or know how it should be implemented. Secondly, if they did know about it they might not<lb/> be disposed to adopting and implementing the policy for various reasons which might be budgetary or<lb/> political; as one group interviewed stated &quot; politics is important for public procurement &quot; . This issue seems<lb/> partly to do with communication and integration of policy at all levels of government, and partly to do with<lb/> the fragmented nature of government in Serbia.<lb/> It is important also to develop the role of other institutions in creating a climate favourable to social<lb/> entrepreneurship. This applies particularly to the intellectual sphere of society: universities, research<lb/> institutes, and think tanks. The OECD team was impressed by the high calibre of many young people<lb/> attracted to developing the social entrepreneurship sector; we also met some very well-informed academics<lb/> and consultants, and subsequent research has shown a significant amount of research on social<lb/> entrepreneurship in Serbia also taking place outside the country. These diverse actors in some cases are<lb/> networked but in others they are less integrated; thus, the potential for building and exploiting a knowledge<lb/> base for social entrepreneurship in Serbia could be improved, and thereby play a role in strengthening the<lb/> climate for social entrepreneurship. Developing good links with the media is another important area, where<lb/> international experience confirms that investment of time and effort has clearly paid off.<lb/> International donors also play an important role in shaping agendas and creating a climate for social<lb/> entrepreneurship. Several of these appear to have developed an impressive focus of activity around the<lb/> social enterprise/social entrepreneurship theme – including British Council, UNDP and USAID. Through<lb/> project funding, this has created a number of model social enterprises which have proved important in<lb/> raising the profile of the field. While there appears to be a downward trend in international donor support,<lb/> the roadmap towards EU accession clearly needs to emphasise the importance of social enterprise, the<lb/> social economy, and social entrepreneurship.<lb/></p>

			<head>Informal Economy<lb/></head>

			<p>The OECD team on a number of occasions encountered the view that the informal economy<lb/> frequently hampered the legitimate activities of social enterprise. This appears to be a theme which is also<lb/> relevant to the performance of SMEs, and continues to be an important concern for policymakers. Recent<lb/> research finds that the informal economy is most prominent in the following sectors: trade in goods and<lb/> services, building and construction, small-scale subcontracting services, household services, and<lb/> agriculture (<ref type="biblio">Andrić and Mijović, 2010</ref>). Reforms on labour taxes and social security contributions in 2007<lb/> may contribute to a reduction in the size of the informal sector – but exploitation of inadequate monitoring<lb/> systems by SMEs and larger enterprises may need firmer measures; similarly the apparent ease in &quot; gaining<lb/> access to a range of social benefits through the simple act of registering as unemployed with the<lb/> unemployment service, while actually working in the informal economy &quot; (<ref type="biblio">Krstic and Sanfey, 2010</ref>)<lb/> remains an important issue to be addressed. The following case study (Box 3) shows how local<lb/> municipalities can create a framework for supporting the transition from exclusion in the informal sector,<lb/> to employment and access to services.<lb/></p>

			<head>Box 3. Capacity Building Informal Economy and Transitioning to Social Enterprise: ASMARE (Associação dos<lb/> Catadores de Papel, Papelão e Material Reaproveitável or the Association of Paper, Carton and Recyclable<lb/> Material Pickers)<lb/></head>

			<p>ASMARE, in the city of Belo Horizonte (Brazil), originated in 1990 as an organised group of waste pickers,<lb/> although they had gained recognition in earlier years when they resisted official harassment with some support from<lb/> church based organisations especially the Pastoral de Rua. Waste pickers, mainly men, sort and scavenge urban<lb/> waste for re-useable material which they can sell or re-use. They came together initially to demand legal right to work<lb/> as waste pickers in the city and to have secure places to store materials.<lb/> ASMARE is now governed by a statute agreed with the city authority which sets out membership criteria and<lb/> some rules to govern its operation. A monthly membership fee gives pickers access to certain entitlements such as<lb/> use of public transport, access to childcare, and health insurance. They can also participate in regular meetings of the<lb/> organisation to discuss accounts, profit sharing and there are different committees which tackle various aspects of the<lb/> work. It has over time taken on additional programmes such as literacy, adult education, health, and childcare. It has<lb/> retained partnerships with church groups and expanded its network of connections over a 20 year period and<lb/> developed its organisational expertise (with assistance from Pastoral de Rua and others who provided technical<lb/> assistance). Nevertheless for some pickers this degree of formalisation has been too much and not all have joined<lb/> ASMARE (<ref type="biblio">Carrasco, 2009</ref>). Estimates suggest that ASMARE has up to 380 members and collects about 450 tons of<lb/> waste each month including paper, cardboard, aluminium and plastics. ASMARE, is categorised in some reports as a<lb/> non-government organisation (WISER) although it shares more traits with a social enterprise which distributes profits<lb/> and elects its own leaders.<lb/></p>

			<head>Infrastructure<lb/></head>

			<p>This section examines legal frameworks, reviewing the current possibilities and assessing the<lb/> rationale for new legislation, it goes on to review institutional capabilities at different levels (government<lb/> departments, regions, municipalities), and it examines institutions for the social economy, including social<lb/> enterprises, as well as considering issues of representation and advocacy and the role of existing social<lb/> entrepreneurship coalitions and networks. Finally, it discusses business support structures relevant to the<lb/> SME and social entrepreneurship sectors.<lb/></p>

			<head>Legal Frameworks<lb/></head>

			<p>Currently social enterprises are formed using a variety of legal frameworks with varying strengths and<lb/> weaknesses. The section begins by briefly reviewing the relevant legislation:<lb/></p>

			<head>Companies for the disabled<lb/> The Law on Professional Rehabilitation and Employment of Persons with Disabilities specifies</head>

			<p>the<lb/> term social enterprise as a separate subcategory and links it to addressing the needs of people with<lb/> disabilities. The implication of this is that a social enterprise provides services for people disabilities, and<lb/> should employ at least one person with a disability. At the same time, the law requires that at least five<lb/> people with disabilities should be employed and the proportion of employees with disabilities should be at<lb/> least 50% including 10% with special employment needs. However, the law as it relates to social enterprise<lb/> does not specify the proportion of income that should be allocated for the integration of people with<lb/> disabilities (nor whether wage subsidy is standard irrespective of degree of disability) and there appears to<lb/> be some need for clarity about precisely how the tax exemptions should apply (<ref type="biblio">Group 484, 2011</ref>).<lb/> The system is self funding through the Budget Fund (which supports companies for disabled directly<lb/> and through funds transferred and implemented by the National Employment Service) but there appears to<lb/> be a lack of clarity over the extent of any surplus, and policy over what it might be used for. Any surplus<lb/> might provide some potential for extending the model beyond disabled people to disadvantaged groups.<lb/> Furthermore, the functioning of the Lottery Fund provides a useful model for managing this fund to ensure<lb/> it is closer to target organisations, and more openly responsive through the competitive system of open<lb/> calls.<lb/></p>

			<head>Co-operatives<lb/></head>

			<p>The law on co-operatives dates from 1996 and was last modified in 2006. A draft proposal for a new<lb/> law was prepared in 2010, and a public consultation undertaken. This draft legislation included provision<lb/> for social co-operatives, however little progress has been made since public consultation, possibly due to<lb/> the issue of restitution of social property. Currently ten people are required to form a co-operative, but this<lb/> is likely to be reduced to five if the new legislation is passed. Co-operatives enjoy the same tax regime as<lb/> associations (10% corporation tax), which is the same as that for private business. Information provided in<lb/> English about the proposed new legislation on social co-operatives (article 11 in the draft law on co-<lb/>operatives) (<ref type="biblio">Group 484, 2011</ref>) does not seem to specify that social co-operatives should be non-profit or<lb/> have limited distribution constraints and although it specifies that there should be a proportion of profits be<lb/> used for social purposes, the draft law currently does not seem to specify what proportion (such as 5% or<lb/> 50% or 75%). Nor is there an asset lock. These features would be more consistent with legislation adopted<lb/> in other countries, such as the Italian law. Indeed, it is worth noting that internationally the co-operative<lb/> form has been frequently used or adapted for social enterprise, as in the case of Italy or Sweden with their<lb/> well-established social co-operative forms, which has been a model for legislation in a number of other<lb/> countries in Europe.<lb/></p>

			<head>Associations/NGOs<lb/></head>

			<p>These are democratic member-based structures. The new Law on Associations was passed in 2009.<lb/> One of the changes was to make registration easier, since associations no longer had to register with<lb/> ministries but with the Serbian Business Registers Agency. The law requires that a minimum of three<lb/> people are required to form an association. It specifies the goals of the association should be general<lb/> interest and not for profit. However, it does allow associations to engage in economic activity as an<lb/> additional activity provided it is related to the purpose of the organisation, and that it is &quot; small-scale &quot; and<lb/> limited to the extent necessary for the achievement of the purposes of the association (which is in fact an<lb/> ambiguous requirement). The law allows for associations to establish and own companies to undertake<lb/> commercial activities. There may need to be some clarification with regard to the condition of<lb/> &quot; relatedness &quot; (to purpose), and the condition of &quot; small-scale &quot; , since there are significant fines (EUR 500-<lb/>5000 for the Association, and EUR 50-500 for directors) where the boundary with regard to the above<lb/> conditions is overstepped. The law allows any profit to be used for the general interest specified in the<lb/> constitution of the organisation. Questions have been raised about the suitability of this structure to engage<lb/> in economic activity (<ref type="biblio">Group 484, 2011</ref>): firstly because of access to bank funding (possibly due to banks<lb/> unfamiliarity with this form); and, secondly, with regard to scale of economic activity (relatedness seems<lb/> less of an issue), and the extent to which it can engage in tender procedures due to these economic activity<lb/> considerations.<lb/></p>

			<p>Two recent developments are likely to strengthen the NGO sector: the new Law on Associations<lb/> (many existing active associations have re-registered under this law); and the establishment of an<lb/> institutional framework for co-operation with civil society through the Office for Co-operation with Civil<lb/> Society which was established in 2010, their early work involves developing a Strategy for Civil Society<lb/> Development.<lb/></p>

			<head>Foundations<lb/></head>

			<p>These are non-profit NGOs and compared to associations this legal structure allows a much tighter<lb/> control by the founding members. The new Law on Endowments and Foundations became operational in<lb/> 2011; with regard to economic activity, it may undertake this provided it is related to the goals of the<lb/> foundation, and that it is a non-core activity – but it needs to be a registered activity. A foundation may<lb/> establish and own a company that conducts economic activities; and, as with associations, there are<lb/> significant fines (EUR 3000 to EUR 6000) if the economic activity is not related to its goals, and it is not<lb/> specified in the register of activities. A crucial issue is how specific a statement of registered activities<lb/> needs to be (relief of poverty, for example, would allow a wide scope of entrepreneurial activities). It<lb/> appears that in comparison to associations, the condition of small-scale of economic activity does not apply<lb/> in the legislation and so it appears that foundations have some advantages over associations in engaging in<lb/> economic activities. In some other countries foundations are favoured by individual or a few social<lb/> entrepreneurs since they are not accountable to a wider membership, but this is a disadvantage for building<lb/> social enterprises strongly rooted in civil society. Although not currently seen as a model for social<lb/> enterprise in Serbia, in some other European countries, such as Poland (EMES, 2008), they are seen as<lb/> very relevant and useful, with well-established exemplary cases, such as the Barka Foundation.<lb/> However, neither associations nor foundations are without difficulties in operating flexibly as a social<lb/> enterprise. The co-operative structure is more favourable and flexible, but the requirement to have ten<lb/> founding members in Serbia limits its attractiveness as a start-up legal form, since many social<lb/> entrepreneurs would be likely to start with fewer numbers. Whilst the idea of sleeping partners (members)<lb/> may be one way around this, it hardly contributes to creating a democratic culture.<lb/></p>

			<head>Limited liability company<lb/></head>

			<p>The remaining alternative is the limited liability company form (d.o.o in Serbian), which is flexible<lb/> and well recognised; but it is neither member-based, nor non-profit (or profit limited). It may, however, be<lb/> possible to write model constitutions and bye-laws which approximate to these conditions. As noted above<lb/> there may be quasi-social enterprise that make use of company structures.<lb/></p>

			<head>Institutional Capabilities<lb/> Governmental capabilities<lb/></head>

			<p>There are different institutional capabilities at different levels: government departments, regions,<lb/> municipalities. Although there is no single governmental body representing the social economy, there are<lb/> a number of bodies and structures of representation. Thus, responsibilities for the co-operatives (and SMEs<lb/> and company policies) lie with the Ministry of Finance and Economy. Also, the Ministry Labour,<lb/> Employment and Social Policy is responsible for companies for the disabled, administration of the Budget<lb/> Fund, social services and people with disabilities, as well as support for NGOs and the administration of<lb/> the Lottery Fund. The Office for Co-operation with Civil Society was established in 2010 with the aim of<lb/> establishing the institutional framework for organised co-operation with the civil sector and providing a<lb/> communication channel between the government and the civil society. SIPRU, which was established in<lb/> 2009, plays an essential policy co-ordinating role in the field of social inclusion and poverty reduction.<lb/> However, social enterprise typically cuts across a number of ministerial responsibilities.<lb/> Some of the policy measures relevant for the social economy are as follows:<lb/></p>

			<p> the National Action Employment Plan, includes a training programme for social entrepreneurs,<lb/> and is implemented through National Employment Service measures for vulnerable groups;<lb/></p>

			<table> Budget Fund and support to people with disabilities;<lb/>  Ministry of Finance and Economy programmes for SMEs and co-operatives;<lb/>  Training held by National Agency for Regional Development and regional development<lb/> agencies;<lb/></table>

			<p> Also, The Ministry of Labour, Employment and Social Policy uses the Lottery Fund for a support<lb/> programme for more than 500 NGOs supporting people with disabilities; priorities are jointly set<lb/> with the Serbian National Organisation of People with Disabilities; they fund at three levels:<lb/></p>

			<p> 34 national umbrella organisations with 526 local branches that receive money for their<lb/> activities;<lb/>  various associations receive funding annually based on previous year&apos;s performance; and,<lb/>  funding for ad hoc projects (via monthly calls/tenders).<lb/></p>

			<p>The lottery money has five funding areas: disability, youth and sport, the Red Cross, local<lb/> municipalities for social protection (receiving 19% each), and rare diseases (5%).<lb/></p>

			<p>Other key areas of funding for social entrepreneurship are: the Public Works programme, various<lb/> active labour market programmes, local government which influences the commissioning of welfare<lb/> services, and calls by different ministries through the system of project based tenders.<lb/> Many of these support measures are temporary, and are best suited to support a start up activity to<lb/> explore if it can achieve viability through subsequent income generating strategies.<lb/></p>

			<head>International donor community capabilities<lb/></head>

			<p>Although a declining force, a number of international donors have been quite influential in supporting<lb/> and shaping the social entrepreneurship agenda, and may continue to be an important alternative source of<lb/> inspiration and resources. In principle their activities are linked though co-ordination agreements (the<lb/> Serbian EU Integration Office plays a major role; and there are other government bodies negotiating co-<lb/>ordination, including through Sector Working Groups) (Government of the Republic of Serbia European<lb/> Integration Office, 2011b), and they often operate through partnerships. However, donor agencies have<lb/> their own agenda, so the extent of co-ordination has limits. The following are some examples of<lb/> international bodies and their projects: the British Council, with a focus on skills and capacity building<lb/> currently engaged in training and development of social enterprise business plans – &quot; Think Social, Act<lb/> Business &quot; Programme; UNDP, which has had a focus on social entrepreneurship, especially co-operatives,<lb/> and gender equality issues; USAID, with its interest in micro-finance; EU funded pilot project on Satellite<lb/> Accounts for Co-operatives and Mutuals in Serbia; and, the Canadian Embassy, with a project advocating<lb/> social co-operatives. Several other major international bodies, including the International Labour<lb/> Organisation and the International Organisation for Migration are also involved in various ways with<lb/> projects relevant to social enterprise, including the YEM project, and many others through the work of the<lb/> European Movement in Serbia. The now completed YEM project (a UN joint programme for Youth,<lb/> Employment and Migrants); provides an interesting model led locally by the Ministry of Labor,<lb/> Employment and Social Policy, with several other ministries and government bodies involved. It focused<lb/> on youth employment and migrants, and included support for social entrepreneurship. As the OECD team<lb/> heard this led to capacity building of 12 social enterprise.<lb/></p>

			<head>Corporate and associated bodies<lb/></head>

			<p>In addition, there are donors from the private sector: Erste bank with a well developed three year CSR<lb/> strategy; Foundation Ana and Vlade Divac (a successful basketball player&apos;s foundation supporting various<lb/> projects), UniCredit bank (with the project Financial and Technical Assistance for a Sustainable Social<lb/> Economy of Serbia) and with Consorzio Gino Mattarelli it also supported the implementation of the project<lb/> &quot; Forum of Social Enterprises &quot; ; the National Alliance for Local Economic Development (NALED -<lb/>http://www.naled-serbia.org/index.php?lang=english) with its &quot; Civil Society Sector Organisation for<lb/> Competitiveness &quot; programme and CSR certification developed with its partners – Smart Kolektiv and<lb/> Balkan Community Initiative Fund; as well as Global Compact Serbia which brings together a range of<lb/> CSR organisations and actions. With appropriate strategic engagement, such bodies could prove to be a<lb/> growing source of support for social entrepreneurship in Serbia. This could most effectively take place by<lb/> more strongly emphasising social entrepreneurship in the National Strategy on Corporate Social<lb/> Responsibility, and fully implementing it.<lb/></p>

			<head>Bodies representing/developing the social enterprise sector<lb/></head>

			<p>A</p>

			<table>number of NGOs are founding members of the Coalition for the Development of Social<lb/> Entrepreneurship; this informal network consists of a number of development organisations that tend to<lb/> rely on donor funding. They include:<lb/>  Group 484 (focus on migrants, social services and social enterprise);<lb/>  European Movement in Serbia (research and advocacy; support for social entrepreneurship; and<lb/> capacity building civil society);<lb/></table>

			<p> Smart Kolektiv (CSR and socially responsible companies);<lb/></p>

			<p> Balkan Community Initiative Fund (supports development of local organisations); and,<lb/>  Initiative for Development and Co-operation (migrants and vulnerable groups);<lb/></p>

			<p>The goals of the Coalition are to contribute to:<lb/></p>

			<p> create an enabling environment for social entrepreneurship;<lb/>  define the legal framework for the successful operation of social enterprises;<lb/>  strengthen the capacity of existing &quot; social enterprises &quot; ; and,<lb/>  raise awareness of key stakeholders about the potential and social importance of social<lb/> enterprises.<lb/></p>

			<p>Another body with some members in common also supports the development of social enterprise: the<lb/> Social Economy Network Serbia (SENS) was set up in February 2011 at a meeting of social enterprises,<lb/> gathered together by Group 484. The network has 27 members who agreed to co-operate to improve<lb/> existing social enterprises, form a small internal market, and promote social entrepreneurship as an<lb/> innovative solution for the problems of poverty and social exclusion. Networks are also forming around<lb/> particular areas of activity, for example the Green Initiative Network (involving 22 associations involved<lb/> with waste collection).<lb/> Although these bodies represent an energetic and dynamic face of the new emerging social enterprise<lb/> sector, they are also rather weak, and dependent on donor funding and support for their work and approach.<lb/> Currently, they are more concerned with advocacy to improve the framework for social entrepreneurship<lb/> and civil society. But in time they may also face questions of legitimacy, and to what extent their voice<lb/> represents this new emerging sector. That is: how accountable and representative are they? As the sector<lb/> grows there will also be issues of how to integrate the new social enterprises within the bodies representing<lb/> the established social economy, parts of which are being reconfigured in a new dynamic of social<lb/> entrepreneurship, largely through market relations. In other words, an important issue will be how to bring<lb/> together these new bodies with those representing the more established sectors of associations,<lb/> foundations, and co-operatives (as they face the challenge of being reformed).<lb/></p>

			<head>Support bodies for traditional social economy<lb/></head>

			<p>There are a number of bodies representing traditional parts of the social economy, these include:<lb/></p>

			<figure> NGO umbrella/support bodies such as:<lb/>  Federation of NGOs in Serbia (FENS);<lb/>  The Center for the Development of Non-profit Sector: this is a non-governmental,<lb/> independent, non-profit institution supporting the non-profit sector, by providing information<lb/> and documentation, communication, counselling, and education and research;<lb/>  The Association of Charitable Trusts and Foundations;<lb/>  18 Co-operative Unions (The Center for the Development of the Non-Profit Sector, 2001;<lb/> Ševarlić et al. 2010), including regional federations of co-operatives, and the Co-operative<lb/> Alliance of Serbia. (Note that the Co-operative Union of Serbia is the national association of<lb/> agricultural co-operatives in Serbia.); and,<lb/>  Association of Disability Companies (UIPS).<lb/></figure>

			<p>In Serbia, the general picture is one of an emerging sector of new social entrepreneurship, which also<lb/> has emerging development and representative structures. This new sector has some links, although not<lb/> particularly strong links with the traditional structures of the social economy. This may be contrasted with<lb/> some international experiences where social enterprise leadership structures try to build a broader base in<lb/> civil society with the traditional social economy (see Box 4). Creating a national body that integrates old<lb/> and new parts of the social economy will allow a system of co-governance of policy with the diverse state<lb/> ministries and agencies concerned with policy development. It will also allow capacity building at the<lb/> national level for support, self-regulation, and developing best practices.<lb/></p>

			<head>Box 4. Co-governance: The Standing Conference on the Social Economy (SKES)<lb/></head>

			<p>The Standing Conference on the Social Economy (SKES) was an idea that arose from representatives of Polish<lb/> practitioner organisations taking part in the 2nd European Social Economy Conference held in Kraków in 2004. Its aim<lb/> was to establish a national forum in Poland to connect the various social economy organisations in a still emerging<lb/> network. A secretariat was provided by a foundation, FISE, to co-ordinate meetings.<lb/> SKES has two main aims. First, it aimed to open discussion and exchange between the variety of social economy<lb/> organisations (these included social enterprises, foundations and associations, co-operatives and mutual societies).<lb/> These had emerged since the fall of communism and the entry into the European Union in 2004. In some cases these<lb/> new organisations built on a thriving co-operative structure from the interwar years. Second, it aimed to come to<lb/> agreements about issues affecting the social economy in Poland.<lb/></p>

			<p>In pursuit of these aims it has organised regular national meetings amongst its members, developed proposals<lb/> and collaborated with other actors including government bodies, and economic and research institutions such as the<lb/> Institute of Public Affairs. A notable achievement of SKES was to contribute to the development of the Polish Social<lb/> Economy Manifesto which was presented at the &quot; Solidarity Economy Conference &quot; in Gdańsk in June 2008. Developing<lb/> legal structures for social economy organisations and a support structure for practitioners have remained central<lb/> activities. Today, with the growing importance of the social economy in the public sphere SKES has identified<lb/> emerging challenges in relation to legislation and regulation; strategy and planning; support mechanisms; and the role<lb/> in public policy. Hence SKES is now working to develop a &quot; Pact for Social Economy &quot; to set out agreed roles and<lb/> obligations between the government and social economy organisations.<lb/></p>

			<p>Another international example provides an illustration of how the governance system of a<lb/> representative body for social entrepreneurship might be structured: in the UK, the Social Enterprise<lb/> Coalition (SEC) was formed in 2003, and aims to promote, develop and lobby for the social enterprise<lb/> sector. It is a member based organisation, and helps develop policy with government as well as<lb/> networking, and co-ordinating development activities. The governance of the Coalition is based on<lb/> different categories of members electing a small Board of 12 members alongside an elected Council of 46<lb/> members that provides a forum for shaping policy. The Board comprises the chair (a social enterprise<lb/> practitioner), six members elected from the council (three of which should be practitioners), three members<lb/> selected through open advert (two of whom should be social enterprise practitioners), and two executive<lb/> directors (chief executive and finance director of the Coalition). The Council comprises 46 elected<lb/> members, including the Chair of the Board drawn from the 4 different categories of membership: 23<lb/> members from social enterprises, 12 members from regional and national networks, 6 members from social<lb/> enterprise umbrella organisations, and 4 members from partner organisations.<lb/></p>

			<p>Looking more broadly at international experience of the development of social enterprise, in the early<lb/> phase when there were relatively few social enterprises to exercise leadership in the sector, it is important<lb/> to bring together the major actors (network and umbrella organisations) in the social economy to ensure<lb/> coherence, influence and legitimacy – these included the co-operative sector (workers, consumers,<lb/> housing, etc.) and various strands of the voluntary or non-profit sector. As the sector develops the<lb/> relevance of small local umbrella bodies (like consorzi) grows – as in the following example (Box 5).<lb/></p>

			<head>Box 5. Italian Consorzi: Co and So Firenze – Member of the CGM Network of Social Enterprises<lb/></head>

			<p>The Co and So Firenze (Consortium for Co-operation and Solidarity) is based in Florence (Italy). It was formed in<lb/> 1998 and is now the largest consortium of social enterprises in the Province of Florence; it comprises 40 organisations<lb/> which in total employ more than 1,500 people. It was established, under the Florence legal statute Article 5, with the<lb/> general goal of advancing the common interests of citizens in the town and to support social integration. In effect the<lb/> Consortium provides support, training, research, development, knowledge transfer, innovation, contracting,<lb/> communication and advocacy functions for, and with, its members as well as being able to co-design policy to some<lb/> extent with the public sector. However it has broader social roles as well which include: promoting co-operation<lb/> between co-operatives within Florence and also nationally; building the internal democracy of the organisation; and<lb/> encouraging moral values and social co-operation in society generally. Indeed, the National Law 381 passed in 1991,<lb/> recognises at a legislative level the role of social co-operatives in promoting the general interest of the community.<lb/></p>

			<p>To remain flexible and close to the interests of the territory, in 2002 it adopted an enterprise organisational model<lb/> focused on specialisation. Since then, the Consortium offers its members a variety of services including assistance<lb/> with contract bidding and management, organisational development support, brand development, quality assurance<lb/> and social responsibility processes. The membership comprises nine type A co-operatives (which undertake<lb/> educational outreach and social services) seven type B co-operatives (which aim to integrate unemployed people back<lb/> into work) and two producer co-operatives. Co and So is well connected: it maintains close relations with trade unions,<lb/> associations and foundations, public authorities, religious organisations, universities and banks. It is governed by a<lb/> board of a dozen people; however there is an important internal democratic structure.<lb/> Because of the volume of work, the Consortium can help integrate members&apos; work across sectoral boundaries. In<lb/> this sense, a type B co-operative could gain employment opportunities for disadvantaged workers by providing entry<lb/> level work such as laundry cleaning services to a type A co-operative engaged in educational projects. The member<lb/> organisations contribute to the Consortium&apos;s budget, in recognition of the bargaining strength and services it provides<lb/> them.<lb/> The Co and So Florence is itself one member amongst 79 other networks, which together form a national<lb/> umbrella known as Consorzio Gino Mattarelli (CGM). This was founded in 1987 and now lays claim to being the largest<lb/> network of social enterprises in Italy. Its member organisations provide services across the country&apos;s regions,<lb/> provinces and communes. Over 700,000 families benefit from services CGM members provide either directly – or<lb/> indirectly in conjunction with local authorities. These services might include educational services, health care,<lb/> rehabilitation, social, educational or cultural activities. In view of its size and importance CGM has devised a<lb/> sophisticated democratic decision making structure which, from 2009, involved various layers including a participative<lb/> assembly, special group assemblies, special group committees as well as territorial groups.<lb/> Source : Co and So Firenze: http://www.coeso.org/index.html and CGM: http://www.consorziocgm.org/<lb/></p>

			<head>Business Support Structures Relevant to be SME and Social Entrepreneurship Sectors<lb/></head>

			<p>In Serbia the main system of support for entrepreneurship in SMEs consists of the following elements:<lb/>  financial support through start-up loans from the Serbian Development Fund, and subsidies from<lb/> the National Employment Service for self-employment or job creation;<lb/>  training programmes administered by the National Agency for Regional Development with a<lb/> network of regional agencies and centres. There are various training programmes, including some<lb/> for three days, and a five day programme for young people, and there has been a pilot mentoring<lb/> programme;<lb/>  the same agency also supports a schools programme for entrepreneurship; and,<lb/>  the National Employment Service also provides the largest training programme on starting a<lb/> business for over 13,000 unemployed people in their Business Centres.<lb/> It is not clear whether social enterprises have easy access to the same system of support as SMEs,<lb/> although there is access to financial support from the National Employment Service. As noted above, there<lb/> is a small ecology of donor-sponsored training and project funding which has undoubtedly contributed to<lb/> the development of some good examples of social enterprise. There are also various government funds,<lb/> such as the Budget Fund and Lottery Fund, which are generally used to support different types of social<lb/> entrepreneurship. The tender system associated with different policy measures to initiate support for<lb/> various projects has also been important for the development of social enterprise. However, if social<lb/> enterprise is not to be disadvantaged in relation to SME support for entrepreneurship, there needs to be a<lb/> similar level of training and mentoring for start-up social enterprise. Thus, opening the SME system<lb/> provision to social enterprise is an important step, but it may also be worthwhile to develop &quot; braided &quot;<lb/> support which recognises that social enterprises have some distinctive training requirements which demand<lb/> specialist support; combining access to state SME services with specialist social enterprise support services<lb/> may ensure a good geographical coverage of support. In addition, it should be noted that in some countries<lb/> specialist social enterprise development agencies have proved effective at regional and local levels, such as<lb/> in Brazil (Box 6).<lb/></p>

			<figure>Box 6. Business Support for Social Entrepreneurship in Brazil<lb/> Artemisia (São Paulo, Brazil) is a social business founded in 2003 by Potencia Ventures – an organisation<lb/> backed by entrepreneurs with interests in the US and developing economies. It aims to support the most promising<lb/> start-up social businesses. Social businesses are seen as organisations which combine a dual logic – operating a for-<lb/>profit core business which seeks both to tackle the social needs of the low income population and reduce poverty.<lb/></figure>

			<p>Artemisia supports initiatives which are seeking to help low income groups in any of three ways: offering job<lb/> opportunities; providing products or services which can help low income people (including housing, health, water); and,<lb/> delivering services which can help them progress economically (such as appropriate credit or technology). Artemisia<lb/> does this by offering a staged series of training programmes which focus in turn on aspects important for<lb/> entrepreneurship. It also offers a social business accelerator to those who have already engaged with previous training<lb/> and now want to tackle strategic challenges in their existing social business. At present Artemisia does not offer loans<lb/> or finance although it can provide links to partners who can do this.<lb/> Artemisia has a tight group of local partners in Brazil engaged in different fields including: an organisation which<lb/> can source risk capital; a hub where creative and professional people gather; private/public organisation interested in<lb/> developing entrepreneurs; research, education, training and consultancy agencies. It also has links with international<lb/> organisations interested in entrepreneurship such as Ashoka. Artemisia has 13 staff, including interns, as well as a<lb/> team of business network experts.<lb/> Source : Artemisia: http://www.artemisia.org.br/eng/artemisia.php<lb/></p>

			<head>Governance in Policy<lb/></head>

			<p>The report produced by Serbia&apos;s European Integration Office (2011a) on the Needs of <ref type="biblio">Serbia for<lb/> International Assistance 2011-2013, identified</ref> four mid-term priorities:<lb/>  enhance professional development and institutional capacity of civil service at all levels;<lb/>  improve development and implementation of efficient public policies;<lb/>  ensure the transparent and accountable functioning of public administration; and,<lb/>  re-engineer administrative processes through introduction of new IT solutions.<lb/> The first three of these were mentioned to the OECD study team, on several occasions, as issues<lb/> which hampered the development of social enterprise. Thus, local civil servants did not know about<lb/> national policy and how it applied, nor were budgets there to support the policy. It was reported to the<lb/> OECD team that local level capacity is weak, that communication and co-operation could be strengthened,<lb/> and that the role of regional development agencies remains unclear. In other words, there are issues around<lb/> vertical and horizontal policy integration. Furthermore, it was not clear that the implementation of policy<lb/> was always fair and above board. Horizontally, the establishment of SIPRU in 2009, and the Office for Co-<lb/>operation with Civil Society in 2010, are major steps in co-ordinating policy and channels of<lb/> communication for social entrepreneurship which typically faces considerable problems of &quot; silo &quot; thinking<lb/> and resource allocation from different ministries associated with the field. Some of these problems have<lb/> also been emphasised in other reports:<lb/></p>

			<p>The role of the General Secretariat of the Government, however, is still essentially limited to<lb/> administrative rather than policy co-ordination. It does not have an independent capacity to<lb/> review policies and monitor the implementation of cabinet decisions. Ministries do not<lb/> sufficiently consult their draft bills with other ministries, which shifts co-ordination tasks to the<lb/> political level, overburdens cabinet meetings with essentially administrative work and contributes<lb/> to the production of low quality legislation (<ref type="biblio">Bertelsmann Stiftung, 2009</ref>).<lb/> In Serbia, horizontally, this is exacerbated by difficulties in relation to different political parties<lb/> controlling different ministries (<ref type="biblio">Pesic, 2007</ref>). However, a process of depoliticisation has been underway for<lb/> some years, and it is an important part of public administration reform leading up to EU accession.<lb/> (Government of the Republic of Serbia European Integration Office, 2011b)<lb/> Despite these difficulties, and the rather limited development of structures and networks representing<lb/> new social enterprise, the OECD team did note good linkages and a good level of understanding between<lb/> networks for new social enterprise and relevant government bodies. This can also be seen in documents<lb/> produced by the sector reviewing legislation for social entrepreneurship, and documents produced by<lb/> networks and conferences (<ref type="biblio">Group 484, 2010</ref>) as inputs to sector strategy. There also appeared to be good<lb/> consultation practices with relevant networks of the new social enterprise sector.<lb/> This appeared to be less obvious with regard to parts of the traditional social economy. Thus,<lb/> representatives from the co-operatives met by the OECD team had long-standing grievances about the lack<lb/> of progress of the new law, whilst the companies for the disabled raised issues about delays and<lb/> ambiguities in payments for the employment of disabled people.<lb/> However, the representative bodies of new sector for social entrepreneurship are still very young and<lb/> small, and do not appear to have governance structures that would give them legitimacy within the whole<lb/> new sector. SIPRU currently plays an important role in linking with these emerging networks for the social<lb/> entrepreneurship field. But at some point, as the sector grows, it would be important to move to a<lb/> governance structure for the new sector that can be seen to be legitimately representative. Similarly, at<lb/> some point it would seem important to try to bring in new and traditional parts of the social economy<lb/> closer together in partnership or joint governance structures, so that a process of co-governance of policy<lb/> can be more broadly based.<lb/></p>

			<head>Summary<lb/></head>

			<p>In terms of cultural pre-conditions, there has been a heritage of distrust and state dependency, with<lb/> continuing emphasis on state provision at a time of severe budgetary constraints. There are also issues<lb/> about developing an entrepreneurial and self-help culture and linked to this there was some evidence that<lb/> the bankruptcy laws are not conducive to taking entrepreneurial risks. There are continuing issues of<lb/> addressing corruption and lack of transparency; some relevant policy measures have been developed (albeit<lb/> some temporary and/or competitive), but not in sufficient scale, and as social enterprise typically cut across<lb/> different ministerial responsibilities, vertical and horizontal policy integration also is problematic –<lb/> requiring for example communication and education about policy frameworks to local officials. Some<lb/> business support may be available via SME programmes, but it is generally not adapted to the specific<lb/> needs of social enterprise. Research, policy and media networking could be enhanced. The profile of social<lb/> entrepreneurship in CSR programmes could be improved and relations strengthened in order improve large<lb/> firm contracting/CSR relations between SMEs and social enterprise. For social entrepreneurship to achieve<lb/> sustainability more effort is also required for building on donor project initiatives. It will also be important<lb/> to develop measures to address the size of the informal economy. Each of the potentially useable legal<lb/> structures relevant to social entrepreneurship have some difficulties of use, particularly regarding economic<lb/> activity in the non-profit sector. While overall policy governance is good for an emerging sector, it requires<lb/> considerable development to move social entrepreneurship to the next stage – both in terms of<lb/> representation by relevant civil society bodies, and in terms of a new coordinative inter-ministerial function<lb/> in government.<lb/></p>

			<figure>CHAPTER 3: INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK AND POLICIES: FINANCE, SKILLS AND<lb/> ACCESS TO MARKETS<lb/></figure>

			<p>This Chapter continues with an examination of the three remaining themes: Finance, Skills, and<lb/> Access to Markets.<lb/></p>

			<head>Finance<lb/></head>

			<p>Finance for conventional business development is a central issue, but it is even more so for social<lb/> enterprise which face barriers in conventional financial markets, and face declining alternative sources<lb/> with the trend towards the withdrawal of international donors, until EU funding takes their place (and there<lb/> could be more than EUR 100 million to support social entrepreneurship through such programmes).<lb/> Finance for social entrepreneurship may be differentiated according to the source of funding, whether it is<lb/> from conventional sources in the private sector, from the state, or from social economy institutions. It may<lb/> also be differentiated according to what aspect or stage of entrepreneurship it is linked with: start-up,<lb/> consolidation, or growth/scaling. The classic sources of finance are: family and friends (and fools). Social<lb/> enterprises often arise in more deprived communities or where private sources of funding are not so<lb/> plentiful. This means that it is often important to have &quot; soft &quot; funding available to overcome this<lb/> disadvantage. Typically this involves grants and subsidies in the early stages of start-up, including for<lb/> business planning, feasibility studies, and subsidies during the first period to break even (18 months).<lb/></p>

			<head>Banks<lb/></head>

			<p>During the last decade international banks have taken a prominent position in Serbian financial<lb/> services. However, they are generally regarded as conservative and risk averse; to quote a recent<lb/> government report regarding the main development problems of SMEs:<lb/> unfavourable conditions for financing and inappropriate types and scope of financial support –<lb/> banks with expensive loan offer and short loan period are dominating. At the national and<lb/> regional level there is a lack of better developed micro-credit institutions as well as of other<lb/> financial instruments which serve real financial needs of SMEs and their economic strength<lb/> (Ministry of <ref type="biblio">Finance and Economy, 2011</ref>).<lb/> This accords with views expressed to the OECD team, that social enterprises suffer additional barriers<lb/> due to banks unfamiliarity with the legal forms used by social enterprise (particularly that of civil society<lb/> organisations). Some banks are well oriented towards the needs of social enterprise, and the OECD team<lb/> met Erste Bank which has a good portfolio of activities oriented towards the sector, as does UniCredit<lb/> bank. However, it is not clear even with these banks where their corporate social responsibility activity<lb/> ends, and where their business banking begins. That is, although they are undoubtedly doing well, they<lb/> have also identified market failures.<lb/></p>

			<head>Micro-finance<lb/></head>

			<p>Another important issue linked to the banks, is that of micro-finance, which in Serbia suffers from an<lb/> inferior position in the financial services sector. Micro-finance is legally required to be conducted through<lb/> conventional banks, rather than directly with the client base. This leads to higher costs and greater numbers<lb/> of transactions – bank charges mean that about half the micro-finance institutions interest income goes to<lb/> the bank. Micro-finance is particularly important for poorer people who are generally financially excluded<lb/> from the banking system, and so rely on alternative systems of credit, like micro-finance, to get themselves<lb/> out of poverty and become more entrepreneurial. According to a survey in the south of Serbia (<ref type="biblio">Gies, 2010</ref>)<lb/> 250,000 households would benefit from a micro-loan of about EUR 1000. This compares with the current<lb/> situation where only three micro-finance institutions operate (under the constrained circumstances<lb/> described above) with only 19 000 borrowers (Microfinance Working <ref type="biblio">Group, 2011</ref>). Estimates indicate<lb/> that about three times that amount could be supplied through micro-finance investors. Several efforts to<lb/> change the situation (with international support) have failed due to the national banks fear of &quot; financial<lb/> sector instability &quot; . International experience indicates that established micro-finance institutions could meet<lb/> appropriate standards of transparency, liquidity, capital and governance. The Microfinance Working Group<lb/> for Serbia has drafted a law on micro-credit companies based on best practices, and has found expressed<lb/> interest from current and potential micro-finance investors in placing about EUR 50 million in Serbia if an<lb/> appropriate law is in place (Microfinance Working Group, 2011).<lb/></p>

			<head>Box 7. Micro-Finance and Credit Unions:<lb/></head>

			<p>Since 1976 when Mohammad Yunus founded the Grameen Bank to lend to the poor, microfinance has proved a<lb/> highly effective model for socio-economic development. (Yunus subsequently won the Nobel Prize for his work).<lb/> Grameen operates by lending mainly to groups of poor women who take responsibility for assisting each of their group<lb/> to meet repayments – leading to very good debt repayment ratios. Since then micro-finance has become a world-wide<lb/> tool for combating social and economic exclusion, in many countries all over the world.<lb/> Inicjatywa Mikro (IM) is a medium-size micro-finance institution providing loans to micro-entrepreneurs in<lb/> Southern Poland with the objective of enterprise job creation. Evaluation of its effectiveness showed: higher growth in<lb/> enterprise employment, sales and revenue.<lb/></p>

			<p>Poland had traditional credit unions, these were effectively closed from the Second World War, until with the<lb/> assistance of the World Council of Credit Unions, they re-emerged when the rise of the Solidarity movement led to a<lb/> new government. The Polish credit union system – known as SKOK, is one of the fastest-growing and successful in<lb/> the world with 59 credit unions, assets of USD 4.8 billion, and with 2.2 million members, served through 1870<lb/> branches. It now assists development in other countries, such as Belarus, Moldova and Ukraine.<lb/> Source: http://www.cuinsight.com/media/community/lessons_learned_from_polandandrsquos_credit_unions.html<lb/></p>

			<head>Budget Fund<lb/></head>

			<p>As noted above the Budget Fund draws its income from penalty payments by employers who do not<lb/> comply with the obligation to employ a certain proportion of people with disabilities. Since being<lb/> established this fund has acquired about EUR 35 million, which may be used in a variety of ways to<lb/> support the employment and vocational rehabilitation of people with disabilities: priorities are companies<lb/> for the disabled – refunds of their salaries and improving working process; finance for improving working<lb/> conditions of people with disabilities and production process are distributed according to calls for<lb/> proposals for assisting unemployed people with disabilities, improving working conditions, workplace<lb/> modifications, etc. In some cases this involves direct funding, in other cases transfers to other bodies like<lb/> the National Employment Service for them to conduct activities in support of people with disabilities.<lb/> There has been some criticism of the performance of vocational rehabilitation companies for the disabled,<lb/> and it would appear that this fund could be used in new and innovative ways – either to upgrade the<lb/> performance of the established vocational rehabilitation companies, or to explore whether other forms of<lb/> work integration social enterprise might innovatively address the employment and rehabilitation needs of<lb/> people with disabilities (e.g. WISEs).<lb/></p>

			<head>Public Works Programme<lb/></head>

			<p>These are a labour market measures providing employment subsidies to employers who take on<lb/> unemployed, disadvantaged people for short periods of time. They are available from the National<lb/> Employment Service on the basis of public tenders in order to carry out social, humanitarian, cultural and<lb/> other activities, maintenance and rehabilitation of public infrastructure, and maintenance and protection of<lb/> environment and nature. Approximately 6000 people took part in public works in 2011. Public works (with<lb/> funding typically for six months) represents an opportunity for social enterprise to gain finance for work<lb/> integration.<lb/></p>

			<head>Lottery Fund<lb/></head>

			<p>The Law on Games of Chance (2004) has resulted in funds being raised for various social projects,<lb/> with (as noted above) five funding areas: disability, youth and sport, Red Cross, local municipalities (social<lb/> protection), and rare diseases. Since 2009 State Lottery of Serbia has been implementing the model of<lb/> engaging a non-profit organisation (Balkan Community Initiatives Fund – BCIF) for administration of its<lb/> funds devoted to supporting civil society initiatives. This model of co-operation ensures transparent and<lb/> accountable distribution of funds since it is done through open calls for proposals – in the last reported<lb/> open call (for Dobrota program) about 3.3 million dinars (EUR 28 000) was administered to nine projects.<lb/> This has also drawn on the lessons and practices of the Social Innovation Fund.<lb/> Lotteries can be a very important source of funding for good causes, and although dependent on<lb/> economic conditions, they are a growing market: revenue from gaming licences in Serbia for 2008 was<lb/> EUR 50 million, which was EUR 500 000 more than the previous year. There are different lottery models<lb/> (<ref type="biblio">Hadzi-Miceva Evans, 2010</ref>) for generating and distributing funds for social purposes – one typology is<lb/> based on who decides how the funds are allocated: state distributed, distribution by another entity<lb/> (including non-profit organisations), by lottery operators, and distribution specified by law. In some<lb/> countries charities may use lotteries as fund-raising tools. The proportions going to good causes is variable<lb/> (for example, in the Czech Republic it varies between 6% and 20% of profits; in the UK it is 28%; whilst<lb/> in the Irish lottery it amounts to 32% – in 2011 it raised EUR 231.9 million (in the UK and Ireland the<lb/> lottery is operated under state licence by limited companies). An asset based model, based on the<lb/> endowment of a very large sum for social purposes, is outlined in the Box below.<lb/></p>

			<head>Box 8. The National Foundation for Civil Society Development, Croatia<lb/></head>

			<p>The National Foundation for Civil Society Development (NFCSD) in Croatia was founded in 2003 with proceeds<lb/> from the Croatian lottery (founding assets were: HRK 2m (EUR 275 000) and by 2008 assets had reached HRK 46m<lb/> (EUR 6.3m), of which HRK 43m (EUR 5.9m) had come from games of chance).<lb/> Each year a governmental decree is issued which sets out the criteria for programmes to which 50% of the<lb/> process from games of chance are allocated. Of that 50%, 14.1% is allocated for the development of civil society with<lb/> the remainder distributed by ministries in areas including sport; social and humanitarian activities; meeting the needs of<lb/> people with disabilities; and, culture.<lb/></p>

			<p>The NFCSD receives over 96% of the total funding allocated for the development of civil society and implements<lb/> activities as well as making grants. Multi-year institutional funding is also available. Associations, foundations,<lb/> institutions, local government units, and other organisations, in the areas of human rights, rule of law, non-institutional<lb/> education, environmental protection, and youth have all received funding.<lb/> A management body, appointed by the government and composed of members of the state administration,<lb/> local/regional government units, and organisations and experts in civil society, is responsible for the decision-making<lb/> processes.<lb/> Source : Hadzi-Miceva Evans (2010)<lb/></p>

			<head>Development Fund<lb/></head>

			<p>This is the main source of state funded credit for businesses and new business start-ups, including<lb/> small entrepreneurs and crafts shops. Besides its own funds which operate within budgetary constraints, it<lb/> also acts as a channel for funds from particular ministries; and works with National Agency for Regional<lb/> Development and regional development agencies supporting start-ups. It provides credit over a range of<lb/> periods at attractive interest rates; it also supports less-developed areas through for example credits for the<lb/> unemployed and micro-credits. Social enterprises can also apply for these programmes.<lb/></p>

			<head>Social Innovation Fund<lb/></head>

			<p>With joint financing from donors and the Republic of Serbia budget, the Social Innovation Fund was<lb/> established in 2003. It was based within the Ministry of Labour, Employment and Social Policy, but many<lb/> donors were also actively involved in various forms of assistance. During its life, the Social Innovation<lb/> Fund supported just under 300 projects in over 100 municipalities, from its accumulated funds of EUR 7<lb/> million. Its main innovation was developing a funding mechanism (via tenders) to encourage a plurality of<lb/> service providers, with the aim of welfare service reform -reduce disadvantage and broadening choices for<lb/> service users. The aim was also use this project funding to help develop sustainable social services funded<lb/> by municipalities (<ref type="biblio">Golicin and Ognjanov, 2010</ref>). The Social Innovation Fund has provided some<lb/> inspiration for the functioning of the Lottery Fund. There are some suggestions that it could be a model for<lb/> a new Social Inclusion Fund – rather like a national version of the European Social Fund – focusing on<lb/> beneficiaries, and governed by an inter-ministerial body.<lb/></p>

			<p>The development of innovative forms of social finance is a key area in supporting social<lb/> entrepreneurship; and there is great potential for rethinking existing models in a particular country, by<lb/> drawing on international best practices. The discussion above about different lottery models reveals a wide<lb/> range of possibilities, and there follows another interesting example of social finance.<lb/></p>

			<figure>Box 9. Innovative Funding Arrangements for Social Enterprises<lb/> Big Society Capital: a social investment bank.<lb/></figure>

			<p>This was established with government funding of GBP 400 million together with GBP 200 million from several of<lb/> the big banks in the UK. The government funding came from unclaimed assets – basically bank accounts that had<lb/> become dormant. It was only launched in 2012, so the range of products and services it offers is still under<lb/> development, but it aims to help develop the social investment market by providing finance in the form of loans, equity<lb/> and quasi-equity. It will not lend directly to social enterprise, rather through &quot; social investment financial intermediaries &quot;<lb/> which may be social banks, non-bank social investors, or support providing organisations.<lb/></p>

			<head>Bridges Ventures: a commercial model with social mission<lb/></head>

			<p>Bridges Ventures began its operation as a private sector company, but received 50% of its GBP 50million starting<lb/> capital coming from UK government. This support was due to Bridges social and environmental mission, which is<lb/> based on the idea that there are market failures in various aspects of conventional finance, for example in less<lb/> developed regions, and with less conventional enterprises, like social enterprise. It operates as a venture capital fund,<lb/> thus if it wants to grow its portfolio of investments it has to continue to raise finance from capital markets – it has<lb/> subsequently raised an additional GBP 75m for a second fund, and has invested GBP 55m in 36 companies across<lb/> both funds. It also has to exit from its investments after they have achieved sustainable growth. This philosophy of<lb/> attempting to use capital markets to support the development of social enterprises is more prominent in Anglo-Saxon<lb/> countries, and it is relatively new, so needs further evaluation, but Bridges appears to have achieved some real social<lb/> and economic successes:<lb/></p>

			<p>For example SimplySwitch which promoted switching to renewable energy (subsequently sold to The Daily Mail<lb/> and General Trust plc) proved a very successful social and economic investment. It provided 80 jobs, the majority<lb/> being women and ethnic minorities, and 60% of these had been unemployed; the company has raised over GBP 0.5m<lb/> for charity partners.<lb/> Source : http://www.open.ac.uk/oubs/socialinvestmentseminars/p5_4.shtml<lb/></p>

			<head>Potential Growth of EU Funding<lb/></head>

			<p>With the path to EU accession by Serbia now approved, more finance should become available from<lb/> different EU funding streams, these include:<lb/> Instrument for Pre-Accession – IPA assistance has five themes: support for transition and institution<lb/> building, cross-border co-operation, regional development, human resource development, and rural<lb/> development. EU financial support under this instrument was around EUR 198 million for 2010, EUR 202<lb/> million for 2011, EUR 202 million for 2012, rising to EUR 215million for 2013 (<ref type="biblio">European Commission,<lb/> 2012</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<head>European Investment Bank</head>

			<p>– the EIB is the long-term lending bank of the EU, with these priorities:<lb/> cohesion and convergence; support for SMEs; environmental sustainability; implementation of innovation<lb/> 2010 initiative; development of trans-European networks in transport and energy; and, sustainable<lb/> competitive and secure energy. Part of their programme of support includes (jointly with the European<lb/> Commission) JEREMIE which targets micro to medium-sized enterprises particularly financial support, for<lb/> start-ups, technology and innovation, microcredit, etc. The EIB operates in the Western Balkans, especially<lb/> through the Western Balkans Investment Framework.<lb/></p>

			<head>European Bank for Reconstruction and Development</head>

			<p>– the EBRD aims at developing transitions to an open<lb/> democratic market economy, primarily focused on the private sector, aiming to fill gaps in the market for<lb/> finance; it is open to social enterprise projects. Similarly the Council of Europe Development Bank (CEB:<lb/> http://www.coebank.org/index.asp?ChangeLangue=) lends within the 40 member states of Europe for<lb/> social integration, environmental, and infrastructural projects which have included the third sector e.g.<lb/> supporting social infrastructure for elder care in France.<lb/></p>

			<head>Progress Programme</head>

			<p>– this has five themes: employment; social inclusion and social protection; working<lb/> conditions; anti-discrimination; and gender equality; this programme is well suited to non-profits, and<lb/> social enterprise. This programme is open to candidate countries and Serbia has very good record in using<lb/> this programme. [Note that only intermediaries in EU-27 Member States are eligible to apply for support<lb/> under the European Progress Microfinance <ref type="biblio">Facility.]<lb/></ref> Lifelong learning – this includes Comenius for schools, Erasmus for higher education, Leonardo da Vinci<lb/> for vocational training, and Grundtvig for adult education; partnerships should be across several countries<lb/> and involve co-operation, networks, information exchange, and training; this has proved an important<lb/> source of funding for social economy organisations in the past, particularly Leonardo for development of<lb/> training programmes. The main programme for accession countries to access is the TEMPUS programme<lb/> which is specifically for modernising higher education in countries outside the EU including the Western<lb/> Balkans. But there are elements of the other programmes (such as Erasmus Mundus for example to develop<lb/> joint masters courses). These programmes could be basis for developing a range of educational and<lb/> training provision, for example a Slovenia business school developed a training course for social<lb/> entrepreneurs through Leonardo.<lb/></p>

			<head>Competitiveness and Innovation Framework programme (CIP)</head>

			<p>– this is available for innovation in<lb/> enterprises, IT and energy; there are three sub programmes: entrepreneurship and innovation (including<lb/> access to finance, innovation and entrepreneurship culture); ICT support; and sustainable development<lb/> regarding energy. Projects should involve several partner countries, and social enterprises can apply,<lb/> although there appears to be a strong emphasis on science and technology rather than broader<lb/> conceptualisations of innovation. Serbia is already participating in the Entrepreneurship and Innovation<lb/> Programme (EIP), as well as the ICT Policy Support Programme (ICT-PSP).<lb/></p>

			<head>European Regional Development Fund (ERDF)</head>

			<p>– this is a large programme aimed at improving<lb/> entrepreneurship, innovation and competitiveness of SMEs, and reduced regional disparities; it should be<lb/> available to social enterprise, but is currently only available to EU27. The Rural Development Fund – this<lb/> is aimed at improving competitiveness for farming and forestry, improving the environment, and<lb/> diversification of the rural economy; it also includes LEADER programme which can provide small-scale<lb/> grants to farmers and rural businesses and community organisations – thus should be readily accessible to<lb/> rural social enterprise. Not currently available to accession countries.<lb/></p>

			<head>The European Social Fund</head>

			<p>– the ESF is well known as a source of funds for social economy aimed at<lb/> developing a skilled and adaptable workforce. But the EQUAL Community Initiative (funded by ESF and<lb/> Member States) could serve as a useful model since it supported innovative, transnational projects aimed at<lb/> tackling discrimination and disadvantage in the labour market, including a theme on &quot; inclusive<lb/> entrepreneurship &quot; ,<lb/> for<lb/> an<lb/> evaluation,<lb/> see:<lb/> http://ec.europa.eu/employment_social/equal_consolidated/about/evaluation.html. Not currently available<lb/> to candidate countries.<lb/></p>

			<head>Business Angels<lb/></head>

			<p>These are individuals with funds and know-how who wish to invest in early-stage businesses to<lb/> support their growth. In Serbia, they may not be well developed since a recent government report on<lb/> SMEs found no evidence of them. However, a network was set up in 2009, the Serbian Business Angels<lb/> Network, with a web portal for matching businesses with investors. Web-based systems for social<lb/> investment have been developed elsewhere, for example MyC4 in Denmark for investment in African<lb/> projects and SMEs. In a similar vein, some countries have engaged celebrities both in promoting social<lb/> enterprise, but also investing in the sector – one example is the UK chef, Jamie Oliver, and his group of<lb/> &quot; 15 &quot; restaurants for training disadvantaged people in the catering business.<lb/></p>

			<p>There is no surprise in noting that the Serbian financial framework of SME and social enterprise<lb/> development is lacking in a number of important respects. This includes addressing the conservative<lb/> attitude of the banks and the fact that only banks can lend money and improving the possibilities for micro-<lb/>finance; a number of government funds could be reoriented toward social enterprise. The trend towards the<lb/> withdrawal of international donors is compensated, to a certain extent, with EU funds gradually being<lb/> opened up; but both these are oriented towards project funding, which valuable though it is, is no substitute<lb/> for a comprehensive framework that supports the financial needs of social entrepreneurs (and SME<lb/> entrepreneurs) during start-up development and growth of their social enterprises.<lb/></p>

			<head>Skills<lb/></head>

			<p>Skills development was mentioned on many occasions to the OECD team as a key issue for the<lb/> development of social entrepreneurship in Serbia. In this respect the social enterprise sector shares many<lb/> common features with the SME sector, since it is also recognised that lack of skills is a key problem in the<lb/> SME sector in Serbia. A recent report states the main development problems of SMEs include:<lb/> insufficient knowledge and skills of entrepreneurs and employees – lack of human resources of<lb/> certain skills, as well as insufficient management skills for solving strategic and operational<lb/> problems in order to maintain continuity in business <ref type="biblio">[and]</ref> insufficient promotion of skills<lb/> development in companies – management skills, R&amp;D skills, and skills related to export through<lb/> appropriate training (Ministry of Finance and Economy and National Agency for Regional<lb/> <ref type="biblio">Development, 2011</ref>).<lb/> It is important to differentiate between the different categories of skills required in relation to aspects<lb/> of social entrepreneurship:<lb/>  skills for social inclusion (and other sector related skills – for example in community<lb/> development, and welfare services);<lb/></p>

			<p> skills for entrepreneurship and management (marketing and finance in particular, and business<lb/> planning and development); these include skills for growth and scaling (capacity building);<lb/></p>

			<p> skills for meeting regulatory, reporting requirements and negotiating with bureaucracies; and,<lb/>  skills for the development of social enterprise (development workers).<lb/></p>

			<p>Note that skills development includes building capacity of administrative officials through communication,<lb/> education, and training, which is discussed under the infrastructure theme.<lb/></p>

			<figure>Box 10. Capacity Building for Emerging Social Enterprise Networks: ESENSEE (Eco Social Economy Network<lb/> South and East Europe)<lb/></figure>

			<p>The ESENSEE project was launched at the start of 2011 with financial support from the European Union and a<lb/> project base in Croatia. It is a network consisting of organisations and networks in East Europe, as well as in southern<lb/> European countries, including Italy. Members of the network share a common aim of encouraging creative,<lb/> enterprising and responsible action towards sustainable development. The network is committed to the &quot; eco-social<lb/> economy &quot; and to developing the capacity of the civic sector in society. The working method entails co-operation and<lb/> exchange at local, national and European levels and it welcomes partnership with public, private and civic<lb/> organisations to further its work.<lb/> ESENSEE&apos;s focus includes: reducing employment and poverty, developing social entrepreneurship and eco<lb/> businesses, encouraging social enterprises and co-operatives, and fostering education on eco issues. It undertakes its<lb/> work mainly through networking and capacity building. These activities target civil society organisations and individual<lb/> entrepreneurs. In particular it is seeking the formation of co-operative clusters and pilot projects as well as the<lb/> establishment of a creative academy to train and develop future generations of social entrepreneurs.<lb/></p>

			<p>The steering committee members include representatives from those working in areas concerned with: civil society<lb/> development, art and eco-social economy (Croatia), training and sustainable development (Macedonia), dignity of<lb/> disabled people (Kosovo), social entrepreneurship, creative design and development (Croatia), migrants and youth<lb/> (Serbia), European co-operatives (Italy). A Healthy City Initiative (Croatia) is also a partner in addition to one associate<lb/> (United Nations Development Programme).<lb/> Source : http://www.esensee.org/project.php?l=fr<lb/></p>

			<head>Social Inclusion Skills<lb/></head>

			<p>Skills development for disadvantaged people to gain social inclusion has to address a number of areas:<lb/> from life skills and social skills to work skills, including skills to support entry into the labour market<lb/> (CVs, job applications, interview practice, job searching, etc.) The OECD team visited a women&apos;s centre in<lb/> Novi Sad and heard about the project Iz Kruga (Out of Circle) to support women with disabilities; the<lb/> programme covered employment, health, legal rights, awareness/confidence and work skills and involved<lb/> individual and group work, as well as mentor support. A visit by the OECD team to the Milan Petrovic<lb/> School provided a highly impressive example of good practices for skills development amongst wide range<lb/> of age groups of people with disabilities, from very young to adult. It would be wonderful to imagine that<lb/> such provision could be replicated across Serbia, but given the budgetary constraints this is likely to remain<lb/> an aspirational example for many.<lb/></p>

			<p>But social inclusion is just one of the areas of social enterprise operates within, and there are many<lb/> ways that need to be employed in order to address social inclusion. Thus, a large area of social inclusion<lb/> activity is associated with working with individuals on employability and integration into the labour<lb/> market. However, social inclusion also involves working with disadvantaged communities and here there is<lb/> a need for skill sets for community work and community development. Similarly, in welfare services there<lb/> are a specific skill sets associated with providing services to disabled, children, and elderly clients. There<lb/> are important quality standards that have to be met in welfare services. For specific sectors where social<lb/> enterprise have a strong current or potential presence, there is scope for skills development and training<lb/> programs.<lb/> In Serbia, training provision in this area relies to a large extent on current labour market policy for<lb/> people with disabilities where there is a regular level of provision; but for people with disadvantages<lb/> training provision relies on National Employment Service funding, and project-based funding via the<lb/> Public Works Programme. The new, 2011 Law on Social Protection has a training element for activation<lb/> and independent living (to help people get supportive housing; personal assistance, and training for<lb/> independent life); and the Lottery Fund supports training activities in this area, again on a project basis.<lb/></p>

			<head>Box 11. Elder Services by Social Enterprise: Sunderland Homecare Care Associates Ltd and the Sister<lb/> Organisation: CASA Ltd Social Franchise<lb/></head>

			<p>Sunderland Homecare Care Associates (Sunderland, UK) began in its current form in 1994 but has roots in a<lb/> previous not-for-profit organisation, The Little Women Co-op, founded in 1976. It is an employee-owned social<lb/> enterprise which offers care services to elderly, disabled or mental health sufferers in their own home. The service<lb/> strives to deliver high quality support which respects the independence of individuals receiving care. It can help with<lb/> shopping, washing and bathing, preparing meals and household jobs. Students with disabilities at a local university<lb/> who need support can also use the service. It delivers contract to local authorities and can provide packages of<lb/> support through the Direct Payments and Individual Budgets provisions available to local councils as part of current UK<lb/> policy relating to people with care needs.<lb/> It had a turnover in 2011 of over GBP 3.5 million, and is owned by over 300 staff employed in the company. The<lb/> democratic ownership structure means the employees, who co-own the company, can vote for the managing board of<lb/> directors<lb/> Sunderland Homecare Care Associates is a sister organisation to the social franchise, Care and Share<lb/> Associates Ltd (CASA), a limited company formed in 2004 and based in Stanley, Durham (UK) which oversees a<lb/> group of six employee owned health and social care organisations around the north of England. CASA is built on the<lb/> Sunderland model and aims to deliver high quality care with fully trained staff. It seeks to work in close collaboration<lb/> with the public sector while competing strongly with the private sector for contracts to deliver care services. CASA is<lb/> managed by a six person board highly experienced in the care and health field. It works closely with the six franchise<lb/> organisations, has at least one person on each of their boards and owns 26% of the shares in each of them. The<lb/> remaining proportion of the shares is held in Employee Benefit Trusts. CASA, like Sunderland Care Homes and the six<lb/> franchises are all employee-owned businesses – the employees jointly own the business and there are no external<lb/> shareholders. CASA is backed financially by Bridges Ventures – a private investment firm owned by its directors and<lb/> the Bridges Charitable Trust – which has specialised in investments and advice to social and environmental<lb/> organisations for over 10 years.<lb/></p>

			<head>Skills for Entrepreneurship and Management<lb/></head>

			<p>It was frequently reported to the OECD team that there was a managerial skills deficit among social<lb/> enterprise and that marketing, financial, and management skills (training) were particularly important for<lb/> social enterprise. In relation to those organisations funded through the Lottery Fund the issue of skills<lb/> development to improve performance was emphasised. Many international donors also focused on skills<lb/> development, both in the above areas as well as skills for entrepreneurship, which is for starting a social<lb/> business. As one person commented &quot; poor business planning skills on the part of social entrepreneurs is<lb/> the key issue &quot; . An orientation to business may not come naturally to people who strongly want to address<lb/> social change and it is interesting that successful social enterprise often emphasise the crucial feature of<lb/> developing professional management e.g. by employing a business manager.<lb/> In the difficult context of raising finance for social enterprise, skills for business planning and fund-<lb/>raising are particularly important. Capacity building is required for business skills to achieve sustainable<lb/> social enterprise; as well as skills for growth and scaling. As someone commented to the OECD team: &quot; business skills, and lack thereof, marketing, budgeting are the main problems for social enterprise &quot; with<lb/> another comment, from an international donor organisation noting that: &quot; &apos;skills for social entrepreneurship&apos;<lb/> is a very important area of activity – and one with real impact potential. &quot; Skills for quality control are also<lb/> important, particularly in public contracting, and where the engagement of local people in the delivery of<lb/> municipal services is required.<lb/></p>

			<p>There are also attitudinal problems to do with a lack of entrepreneurship spirit or culture which could<lb/> be addressed partly through training. It is noteworthy that in the SME sector human resource development<lb/> includes policies for lifelong entrepreneurial education – involving primary and secondary and vocational<lb/> schools, and universities, and this continues with support for associations of entrepreneurs.<lb/> It is also important to recognise that social enterprise need skills associated with the social dimension<lb/> of the operation. This includes understanding governance often in a multi-stakeholder context and strategic<lb/> skills for social/community and economic performance. But it also useful to remember that these skills set<lb/> should be distributed among key actors in the social enterprise.<lb/> In Serbia the provision in this area has three main strands of support: firstly the access of social<lb/> entrepreneurs to the support for SMEs and the self-employed, as noted above (in the section on<lb/> institutional capabilities); secondly, an important area of provision is that of international donor<lb/> organisations; and, thirdly, a growing use of EU programmes could also play an important and growing<lb/> role here. In addition, a parallel development of social entrepreneurship training could find a place at<lb/> several levels within the education and training system. Finally, one well established approach to<lb/> supporting skills development is through business incubators, as in the Box 12.<lb/></p>

			<figure>Box 12. Incubators: Urban N.O.S.E (Network of Social Enterprises)<lb/></figure>

			<p>URBAN N.O.S.E (the URBAN Network of Social Enterprises) was funded as part of the URBACT II European<lb/> Union learning and exchange programme aimed at sustainable urban development. The URBAN N.O.S.E project<lb/> involved co-operation between social enterprises and their partners in nine European cities in order to exchange good<lb/> practices in relation to developing economic sustainability. A particular feature was to understand models of best<lb/> practice for incubators – tools, structures or institutional processes -which could support social enterprise development<lb/> in different country contexts. URBAN N.O.S.E was a two year project which produced its conclusions – drawn from<lb/> Cyprus, Finland, France, Greece, Italy, Portugal, Spain and the UK – in a report published in May 2011.<lb/> Some examples of social enterprise incubators discussed in depth include MCAE (Grenoble, France), an<lb/> association financed primarily from a mixture of public bodies which offers advice, diagnosis, training and start-up<lb/> loans to social enterprises – particularly those seeking to offer jobs to disadvantaged people. D.Y.E.K.O. (Koropi,<lb/> Greece) provides a virtual service and represents the first specialist incubator of social enterprise in Greece, where the<lb/> idea is not well known there. Its work with women social entrepreneurs has been positive although the target group<lb/> (unemployed people) may not always have access to suitable computers. A &quot; More than Profit &quot; network of social<lb/> enterprises (Brighton and Hove, UK) provides another model where a partnership between the public, private, and the<lb/> social economy sectors seeks to provide practical advice, training, networking and to develop supportive local policy<lb/> aimed at developing social enterprises. A &quot; House of Voluntary Service &quot; called CESVOP (Gela, Italy) provides a<lb/> physical location for social economy organisations linked to advice and consultancy.<lb/> The cross-networking of case studies and experiences and knowledge transfer about incubator structures across<lb/> nations was itself an important part of the project. The conclusions suggests that there are lessons for cities engaging<lb/> in setting up social enterprise incubators (for example, on governance, partners, promoting advice and financing<lb/> structures, and involving all sectors) as well as for decision makers (such as on creating a legal framework for<lb/> incubators, decentralised funding support, investment in local &apos;micro&apos; finance packages, and supporting both start-up<lb/> as well as spin-off enterprises).<lb/></p>

			<head>Skills for Meeting Regulatory, Reporting Requirements and Negotiating with Bureaucracy<lb/></head>

			<p>Clearly business skills and capacity building are vital for social enterprise. But since social enterprise<lb/> often have to operate simultaneously in a number of fields (product/service market, financial market, soft<lb/> money market), and negotiate some state support they often need the skills and capacity to deal with<lb/> bureaucracy and with reporting requirements. Social enterprises are often called on to assess the impact<lb/> and value of work done and report on it to stakeholders and the public, including triple bottom line<lb/> reporting. In discussions with the OECD team about the area of micro-credit, it was mentioned that<lb/> compliance with the law would require skills training to meet the standards. It is noteworthy that, as in the<lb/> SME sector, developing a quality approach and meeting quality standards is an important area that needs<lb/> addressing, and there are substantial regional disparities.<lb/> At the moment in Serbia this is not a high priority area until more state contracting takes place and the<lb/> micro-credit regime is liberalised; provision could come from international donor organisations, although<lb/> their supply of resources is declining.<lb/></p>

			<head>Skills for the development of social enterprise (development workers)<lb/></head>

			<p>When it comes to developing appropriate business support for social enterprise, building the<lb/> competencies of a network of trainers and development workers is just as important as developing skills<lb/> within the social enterprise. Much of this currently takes place through informal learning in the networks of<lb/> groups supporting social entrepreneurship.<lb/> And if training social enterprise is to be accessed via the SME system of business support, then<lb/> consideration needs to be given to programmes for training these potential trainers.<lb/></p>

			<head>Access to Markets<lb/></head>

			<p>This section is focused largely on public procurement markets and the level of access by social<lb/> enterprise to projects in the tendering system, as well as more regular formal contracts for delivery of<lb/> public/welfare services. It also considers the extent of use of social clauses in procurement in Serbia and<lb/> internationally. Finally, it considers other relevant markets such as ethical consumer markets, markets for<lb/> donations and legacies, and the CSR market.<lb/> In relation to complying with EU guidelines 9 it is vital that public bodies carefully specify the criteria<lb/> for awarding a contract in the tender specification, in order to measure the social or public benefit which<lb/> the contract requires (BEST Procurement Development Partnership, 2007).<lb/></p>

			<head>The European Commission&apos;s Buying Social: A Guide to Taking Account of Social Considerations in<lb/> Public Procurement provides guidelines</head>

			<p>on how public procurement can be used to meet social goals.<lb/> Whilst in general &quot; reserving &quot; public procurement contracts for specific organisational forms, such as social<lb/> enterprises, is not allowed, so securing a protected market for sheltered workshops employing disabled or<lb/> disadvantaged people would not be possible. However, it is possible to specify conditions like<lb/> &quot; employment of 30% disadvantaged &quot; and avoid conditions which act as impediments to social enterprise,<lb/> such as capital requirements, so that social enterprise have a good chance of demonstrating their ability to<lb/> win public procurement contracts. In Sweden, the Swedish Social Insurance Agency, has involved social<lb/> economy organisations, voluntary organisations and SMEs in their initial studies for procurement, and in<lb/> this way they have both helped orient social enterprise to this public market and facilitated the<lb/> identification of specific problems/hindrances they may face in preparing tender documents<lb/> (http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=IP/11/105).<lb/> At the same time, public procurement which specifically seeks to meet local social and economic<lb/> goals, such as integration and inclusion, quality employment, etc. can also benefit social enterprises who<lb/> are working with disadvantaged and vulnerable groups, such as through work integration activities.<lb/></p>

			<head>Box 13. Social Clauses in Public Procurement: France<lb/></head>

			<p>In France, there are some 250,000 public tenders with around two-thirds of them, worth EUR 115 billion, by local<lb/> authorities. In 2003 the French &quot; public markets code &quot; was amended, in line with EU requirements, in order to enhance<lb/> transparency and enable all firms to participate equally in tendering for contracts. Article 14 of the code focuses on<lb/> integration and employment issues: the code makes it possible for contracts to detail a process of integration, rather<lb/> than a specific type of enterprise. Authorities can decide on a percentage of disadvantage people who should be<lb/> employed by a contractor (although this should not be at a point where competition is not possible). For service<lb/> contracts, a figure of 40% would allow work integration social enterprises to participate. Furthermore, there is the<lb/> potential to use such percentages as a way of encouraging closer relationships between social enterprises and the<lb/> private sector. For example, a figure of 10% appears reasonable for works contracts and this could come from a<lb/> partnership between a conventional firm and a work integration social enterprise.<lb/> Some general contextual factors were noted above in relation to this issue: for example governance<lb/> (vertical integration of policy at the local level), and communication/education about policy frameworks to<lb/> local officials; with the result that opportunities may be varied in different municipalities. Similarly, the<lb/> emerging mixed economy of welfare provision is currently dominated by state providers, with only a few<lb/> opportunities for social enterprise. The tendering system for projects generally offers opportunities for<lb/> short-term service provision, whereas the challenge is to find alternative sources for sustainable provision –<lb/> one option is protected markets, such as that used in Taiwan (Box 14).<lb/></p>

			<head>Box 14. Use of Protected Markets (Taiwan)<lb/></head>

			<p>An important model for social enterprise has been developed in Taiwan, where the government grants NPOs<lb/> (non-profit organisations) the right to operate in protected markets, by providing the space and facilities.<lb/> NPOs engage in commercial activities by means of outsourcing contracts such as, for instance, the coffee shop<lb/> of the Taipei and Kaohsiung government. Taipei government&apos;s Enjoy Coffee was formerly run by the Children Are Us<lb/> Foundation and subsequently by the Taipei Victory Centre for Enhancing the Potential of the Disabled People. The<lb/> Kaohsiung government&apos;s Smile Coffee is now operated by the Children Are Us Foundation. As well, the government<lb/> also periodically allocates public space to NPOs for their commercial undertakings. The best examples in this case are<lb/> the gasoline stations entrusted to NPOs by the Taipei government. The land was formerly controlled by the Labour<lb/> Bureau of Taipei and the gasoline stations were operated by China National Petroleum. With the aim to increase<lb/> employment opportunities for disabled people, China National Petroleum donated the facilities and the government<lb/> opened these to public bidding in 2002. Seven NPO welfare agencies submitted 11 working plans. In the end, it was<lb/> the Sunshine Social Welfare Foundation and the Syinlu Social Welfare Foundation that acquired rights to the gasoline<lb/> stations for three years. Eighty percent of the entire staff must be disabled. In the past, disabled people had to engage<lb/> in physical labour with low added-value jobs including cleaning, washing cars, transporting heavy loads, etc. &quot;<lb/></p>

			<p>The 2008 2 Law on Public Procurement provides a framework for considering competitive bids in<lb/> public procurement markets; and it gives some priority to local providers in competition with foreign<lb/> providers. Article 8 opens the possibility for the public body to define additional conditions relating to<lb/> social and environmental criteria, but it seems this has not yet been explored, although it could offer some<lb/> priority to social enterprises (and the new draft law could enhance this possibility). It should be noted that<lb/> this should not privilege an organisational form, but rather it needs to recognise the qualities and<lb/> experience in delivering social/environmental performance and thus provide a procurement niche/quota for<lb/> social enterprises. Internationally, there is some experience of how to specify such social clauses to make<lb/> them readily accessible to social enterprises.<lb/></p>

			<head>Box 15. Niche Strategies in Public Procurement: Brisbane City Council Procurement Process<lb/></head>

			<p>The public procurement policies of Brisbane City Council in Queensland, Australia, have given high priority to<lb/> developing social procurement clauses. This was consistent with its stated aspirations to build the local economy by<lb/> actively seeking service providers from the community and social enterprise sector. The policy also sought to increase<lb/> the Council&apos;s knowledge and database of information about local groups and to build social enterprises&apos; capacity to<lb/> improve their performance. Overall, the policy recognised the need to prioritise and support the sector to enable it to<lb/> realise its potential.<lb/></p>

			<head>The Annual Procurement Policy and Contracting Plan for 2011/12 emphasised</head>

			<p>in the first of six overall objectives<lb/> for procurement &quot; a commitment to advancing the social needs and requirements of Brisbane communities to advance<lb/> the quality of life for all. &quot; This was followed up in detail in schedule (D) where &quot; social procurement objectives &quot; were set<lb/> out. This entailed a commitment to: (a) maintaining the existing size of council spend with social enterprises; (b)<lb/> increasing the number of social enterprise suppliers to the council; and, (c) working to increase the awareness of other<lb/> public and private sector organisations about contracting with social enterprises. A target was set whereby certain<lb/> services would be reserved purely for social enterprise contractors by conducting a &quot; social enterprise only procurement<lb/> exercise in which social enterprises compete to provide services &quot; .<lb/> In addition, the Council has taken steps to separate out some components of larger contracts so that there is<lb/> scope for smaller elements to be offered, by means of a special &quot; memorandum of understanding &quot; to social enterprises<lb/> which employ people disadvantaged in the labour market. Once established in this way these organisations can bid for<lb/> the contracts reserved for social enterprises. This offers a development ladder which, it is anticipated, could enable<lb/> social enterprises to gradually bid for larger contracts for the benefit of the local economy and disadvantaged groups.<lb/></p>

			<figure>Brisbane is a city with an estimated population of just under 1 080 000 people in 2011, the Council has had a<lb/> Community Engagement Policy since 2008 seeking high levels of public participation. It is governed by 27 elected<lb/> councillors and an elected mayor and had an annual budget of AUD 2.92 billion in 2011/12.<lb/></figure>

			<p>In many countries non-profit organisations, and social enterprise, are highly active in markets for<lb/> donations and legacies. In some cases this is facilitated through a sympathetic fiscal regime. In Serbia the<lb/> law gives certain exemptions on the payment of income tax for expenditures on health care, education,<lb/> science, humanitarian purposes, religious, environmental protection and sports: the amounts exempted is<lb/> 3.5%. In addition value added tax is not payable on donated goods imported for humanitarian assistance.<lb/> Donations and legacies could be a substantial source of income for larger charities and social enterprise –<lb/> particularly those able to promote a brand. Systems of web based donations have proved very effective for<lb/> smaller and medium-sized charities.<lb/></p>

			<head>Other Private Markets<lb/></head>

			<p>Funds from diaspora Serbs are a potential source of income for SMEs and could be the basis for<lb/> funding welfare services for elderly family members. More generally the repatriation of diaspora funds to<lb/> family and own business interests has been an important driver of economic development, and social<lb/> entrepreneurship can play an important role in enhancing the possibilities for this (Box 16).<lb/></p>

			<head>Box 16. Diaspora Involvement Through NGOs and Social Enterprises<lb/></head>

			<p>With globalisation, there has been an increasing recognition of the importance of engaging with, and supporting,<lb/> the contribution of diasporas to their country of origin. In Africa for example in 2010 migrants sent home an estimated<lb/> UDS 40 billion in remittances. Such remittances might go to purchase of agricultural equipment, enhancing a domestic<lb/> property or investing in entrepreneurship or education. These remittances may be stable and even countercyclical –<lb/> with more finance being returned at difficult times.<lb/> Policy makers used to focus on the loss of skills, but now regard it as providing opportunities for developing trade<lb/> and investment projects and acquiring new knowledge.<lb/> Most contributions of a diaspora are financial – in the form of remittances, donations, bonds (appealing to a<lb/> sense of patriotism), and various forms of business investments (including venture capital). But knowledge networks<lb/> are also important, and so are international educational exchanges -note that a major spin-off of Asian students<lb/> studying business and technology in California has been new east-west patterns of entrepreneurship, leading in some<lb/> cases to the development of major international multi-nationals.<lb/> In Israel much of this activity is supported by NGOs (in home country and overseas), but the government<lb/> facilitates developments by approving and validating programmes. There have even been Israeli venture capital funds<lb/> set up for high-tech entrepreneurship, which have proved very successful.<lb/> Another NGO example is Afford-UK (Africa Foundation for Development) which is based in London, United<lb/> Kingdom, with a mission to support and promote the capacity of the African diaspora to contribute to development in<lb/> that continent. It was established in 1994 by Africans living in the UK and has a particular focus on the creation of<lb/> small, micro and medium sized enterprises to create employment for young people in central African states. Part of<lb/> their programme has included projects to support remittances for employment creation.<lb/></p>

			<figure>Source : http://www.remitplus.org/; http://www.afford-uk.org/index.php; Aikins et al. (2009).<lb/></figure>

			<p>Another relevant market is that for corporate social responsibility, either through the development of<lb/> projects or of social enterprise (see the earlier mention of the</p>

			<head>National Strategy for Development and<lb/> Promotion on Corporate Social Responsibility 2010-2015).</head>

			<p>This is an opportunity that social entrepreneurs<lb/> already recognise, but one where there is scope for influencing multinationals in local markets to take their<lb/> social responsibilities more seriously. Corporate social responsibility generally represents a market worth<lb/> targeting for social enterprise, with substantial evidence of successes internationally. For example the<lb/> Royal Bank of Scotland Group established and invested GBP 5 million into the RBSG Micro-finance<lb/> Fund, an independent charity, which has launched a GBP 5 million Community Business Loan Fund for<lb/> social enterprises and community organisations, because such organisations often have difficulty accessing<lb/> business finance.<lb/></p>

			<head>Summary<lb/></head>

			<p>Sustainable social entrepreneurship requires good access to adequate financial resources adapted to<lb/> the needs of social enterprise both at start up and for growth. In Serbia conventional funds (banks) are<lb/> conservative and risk averse for SME funding, and more so for social enterprise. There are some<lb/> government funds available but generally they are limited, sometimes specific (such as to companies for<lb/> the disables), and temporary (based on competitive calls). A key area for assisting disadvantaged<lb/> individuals and communities is micro-finance and credit unions both of which face considerable problems<lb/> in Serbia currently. Development of social entrepreneurial skills is recognized as a key problem in Serbia;<lb/> there is some provision but it is insufficient and not properly tailored to the needs of social<lb/> entrepreneurship, for example through &quot; braided &quot; provision; EU funding will be a major resource in this<lb/> area, taking over from international donors who are already withdrawing. Finally, due to their values and<lb/> added value social enterprise could play an increasingly useful role in public service delivery. Currently<lb/> their access to public procurement markets is ad-hoc, temporary and partial. Social clauses could be used<lb/> to support a niche strategy which would give possibilities of sustainability and growth of social enterprise<lb/> public service providers.<lb/></p>

			<head>SWOT ANALYSIS OF SERBIAN SITUATION<lb/></head>

			<p>Acknowledging the challenges which exist in Serbia with regard to the significant presence of an<lb/> informal economy, low levels of employment and high levels of long-term unemployment and youth<lb/> unemployment, the difficulties which disadvantaged groups, including Roma, people with disabilities,<lb/> refugees and internally displaced persons and the need for greater transparency and accountability, the<lb/> following provides an overview of the strengths and weaknesses, opportunities and threats relevant to the<lb/> development of social entrepreneurship in Serbia.<lb/></p>

			<head>Strengths<lb/> Weaknesses<lb/></head>

			<p> favourable framework supporting the employment of<lb/> people with disabilities;<lb/>  EU accession recently approved, thereby opening<lb/> access to various programmes for financial support;<lb/>  donor<lb/> strategies<lb/> firmly<lb/> supporting<lb/> social<lb/> entrepreneurship;<lb/>  EU policy firmly supporting social enterprise and the<lb/> social economy;<lb/>  capable and energetic new groups/networks<lb/> supporting social entrepreneurship (albeit emerging);<lb/>  recent modernisation of legislation and policy<lb/> relevant to social entrepreneurship (associations,<lb/> foundations, etc).<lb/>  various government bodies supportive of social<lb/> entrepreneurship;<lb/>  some government funds accessible to social<lb/> enterprise;<lb/>  some innovative and successful social enterprise<lb/> models<lb/>  conservative attitude of the banks, and barriers to<lb/> micro-finance;<lb/>  lack of comprehensive framework for financial and<lb/> support needs of social entrepreneurs during start-<lb/>up, development, and growth of their social<lb/> enterprises;<lb/>  heritage of distrust and state dependency;<lb/>  continuing emphasis on state provision at a time of<lb/> severe budgetary constraints; that is, it is difficult to<lb/> progress towards a mixed economy of public service<lb/> provision and thus there are limited opportunities for<lb/> procurement;<lb/>  some evidence that the bankruptcy laws are not<lb/> conducive to taking entrepreneurial risks;<lb/>  vertical integration policy and local officials not<lb/> always well informed about policy frameworks;<lb/>  some negative attitudes to social enterprise, social<lb/> entrepreneurship and the social economy;<lb/>  new social entrepreneurship network is not well<lb/> linked to traditional social enterprise sectors;<lb/>  access to SME support structures not well developed<lb/>  business/management skills deficit in new social<lb/> enterprises;<lb/>  tenders and projects as main development path for<lb/> social entrepreneurs, which bring with it issues<lb/> around sustainability;<lb/>  lack of a wider law on social entrepreneurship<lb/> (although this could soon be addressed with a<lb/> proposed law before parliament).<lb/>  social/public property issue hampering reform of co-<lb/>operatives; and the approval of new co-operative law,<lb/> including that for social co-operatives (unless it<lb/> becomes a separate law);<lb/>  performance and funding issues of disability<lb/> companies; and,<lb/>  weak, although dynamic, NGO sector<lb/></p>

			<head>Opportunities<lb/> Threats<lb/></head>

			<p> donations and legacies as a potential source of<lb/> income – e.g. for large socially entrepreneurial<lb/> charities/foundations;<lb/>  diaspora relations and services (especially for<lb/> elderly);<lb/>  CSR relations and improving large firm contracting;<lb/>  improving the possibilities for micro-finance;<lb/>  government funds could be reoriented toward social<lb/> enterprise;<lb/>  EU funds gradually opening up (oriented to project<lb/> funding);<lb/>  raising profile of social entrepreneurship in CSR<lb/> programmes;<lb/>  strengthening research/policy/media networking;<lb/>  building on donor project initiatives for sustainability;<lb/>  social entrepreneurship role in addressing the size of<lb/> the informal economy; and,<lb/>  niche/quota strategy for procurement could use social<lb/> clauses in current legislation;<lb/>  new measures open to /opportunistic exploitation;<lb/> and consequent reputation risks;<lb/>  trends towards withdrawal of international donors;<lb/>  continuing<lb/> budgetary<lb/> constraints<lb/> limiting<lb/> opportunities; and,<lb/>  sustainability risks for new social enterprises.<lb/></p>

			<p>The SWOT analysis provides a useful way of briefly summarising the current situation, some of the<lb/> ways forward, and some of the issues. In this way it provides a useful point of reflection prior to policy<lb/> recommendations in the next chapter.<lb/></p>

			<head>CHAPTER 4: POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS<lb/></head>

			<p>Given the concerns about the misuse of status and funds raised during the OECD visit, and given also<lb/> the need to clearly carve a space for social enterprises, we propose a cautious approach with the aim of<lb/> establishing the emerging sector on a sound foundation, and gradually building its reputation as a<lb/> distinctive social but entrepreneurial innovation. This means that many of the recommendations should<lb/> also be seen in this perspective: that of gradually building a framework, alongside an emerging movement<lb/> – keeping in mind the development of new social enterprise law being seen as a medium term objective.<lb/></p>

			<p>The section on legislation explores the options in more depth, but to summarise: foundations seem to<lb/> have considerable potential (but clarificatory Guidance Notes by registrars would be needed), co-<lb/>operatives are clearly relevant, particularly if they could be supported and linked in a new distinctive<lb/> network; and there may be scope for using social enterprise model constitutions with the limited company<lb/> form, though there are risks in the medium term here.<lb/></p>

			<p>There are some underlying principles regarding developing appropriate frameworks for social<lb/> entrepreneurship. Firstly, that it is important to develop a level playing field with regard to other types of<lb/> organisations in the market, particularly SMEs. Secondly, legal frameworks should be well adapted to the<lb/> distinctive needs of social enterprise, combining social and economic objectives – and it is important to<lb/> recognise that in many countries legislation has followed innovation over a number of years by social<lb/> entrepreneurs who have adapted existing legislation to their requirements; and, thirdly, there should be a<lb/> well supported institutional and policy framework that matches well with the relevant types of legal forms<lb/> of social enterprise. Finally, in developing such policy frameworks, it is important that the public/social<lb/> benefit dimension of social enterprise is not only properly recognised, but also financially supported – as it<lb/> would be in the context of state funded benefits.<lb/></p>

			<head>POLICY OPTIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS<lb/></head>

			<p>The policy options and recommendations follow the same thematic structure as in Chapters 2 and 3:<lb/> Preconditions, Infrastructure, Governance, Finance, Skills, and Access to Markets. Taken together these<lb/> comprise a strategy for social entrepreneurship, which requires a new co-ordinative function to be<lb/> established to negotiate with relevant government and sector bodies and ensure the strategy is supported<lb/> and implemented; such a function would need to operate at the inter-ministerial level and could be located<lb/> in existing bodies such as SIPRU or OCCS.<lb/></p>

			<p>The rationale for the policy options arises from the detailed analysis in the previous chapters. The<lb/> feasibility and desirability of policy options is considered as a basis for formulating recommendations,<lb/> which are specified at the end of each section. A key underlying theme in these policy recommendations is<lb/> that they should be integral with other relevant policy measures, rather than separate, for example<lb/> whenever policy for SMEs is developed, policy documents should be adapted to: &quot; SMEs and Social<lb/> Enterprises &quot; .<lb/></p>

			<head>Recommendations to Improve Preconditions<lb/></head>

			<p>Many of the issues discussed under this theme in an earlier section relates to generic issues across<lb/> many fields of policy. The EU accession process has a clear focus on addressing many of these issues<lb/> (Government of the Republic of Serbia European Integration Office, 2011a). However, some measures<lb/> specific to social entrepreneurship may also help improve the wider environment for social enterprises to<lb/> develop in. These include developing a public relations strategy for social entrepreneurship, which applies<lb/> as much to governments, at all levels, as to the general public. Such a strategy could include:<lb/>  promoting models of good practices;<lb/>  attracting public figures and celebrities to social entrepreneurship, including via corporate social<lb/> responsibility;<lb/>  competitions for best social enterprise and best social entrepreneurs of the year;<lb/>  the use of online media (Group 484&apos;s electronic Newsletter on Social Entrepreneurship,<lb/> http://www.grupa484.org.rs/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=406&amp;lang=english<lb/> is one such example);<lb/></p>

			<p> strengthening research/policy/media networking so that sympathetic journalists are properly<lb/> briefed; and,<lb/>  raising the profile of social entrepreneurship in corporate social responsibility programmes.<lb/></p>

			<p>Other measures related to improving preconditions include the important issue of the boundary<lb/> between social enterprise and the informal economy and whether social enterprise can provide a pathway<lb/> to the formal economy. This might be linked to specific sector strategies for developing social enterprise;<lb/> and this could be complemented with a strategy that offers additional benefits (including accessing health<lb/> and welfare services) thereby provide greater incentives for people to move out of the informal economy.<lb/> Accordingly, it is recommended that:<lb/>  a few sector strategies be developed as exemplars of effective social enterprise approaches to the<lb/> informal economy, for example, in waste recycling, homecare, childcare, local food markets.<lb/></p>

			<head>Recommendations to Improve Infrastructure<lb/> Legal frameworks<lb/></head>

			<p>The first issue to address is the suitability of current frameworks to social entrepreneurship whilst the<lb/> development of new legislation for social enterprise should be a medium-term goal. In Europe social<lb/> enterprise generally use (social) co-operative structures or non-profit structures (usually associations but<lb/> sometimes foundations) depending on the flexibility of each form and different traditions in each country –<lb/> so Belgium generally uses non-profit forms while Italy and Sweden generally use (social) co-operative<lb/> structures. As noted previously, each of the currently available legal structures has some problems: the co-<lb/>operative structure is generally highly suitable except that it requires ten members for formation, and their<lb/> reputation is poor 10 ; the association form has issues around scale of operation and relatedness to mission<lb/> with penalties if these are not complied with; and the foundation has an issue around relatedness to its<lb/> mission or registered activity, although how tightly this needs to be specified could be examined, but it is<lb/> not so suitable for developing firm roots in civil society. Nonetheless, of these three legal structures<lb/> currently available the foundation appears more suitable for social entrepreneurship. The alternative is to<lb/> develop model constitutions and bye-laws using company law (see endnote 2), which might be supported<lb/> by a sector body and a badging system to develop a social enterprise marque; this might best be undertaken<lb/> by an independent, member-based trade association. This approach has risks since there may be potential<lb/> for opportunists to get social enterprise support and then change to a for-profit when the support ends.<lb/> Given these risks, company social enterprises should not receive public funds, but legally there would be<lb/> no barrier to them engaging in public contracts (as SMEs)<lb/></p>

			<p>The final issue to address in relation to legislative frameworks for social enterprise is whether, having<lb/> developed legal structures that are non-profit or have limited profit distribution constraints so that they are<lb/> relatively unattractive for corrupt/opportunistic exploitation, these legal structures can be incentivised<lb/> through fiscal measures without attracting opportunistic entrepreneurs. The current tax break is low and<lb/> could be revised to make the structures not so much financially attractive as improving the chances of<lb/> sustainability.<lb/> Recommendations to improve the legal framework infrastructure are:<lb/>  Foundations:<lb/>  examine the potential of the foundation as a model for social entrepreneurship, especially the<lb/> issue around relatedness to mission – registered activity;<lb/>  clarification is also required about how to specify related economic activity to comply with<lb/> the law, and extent of economic activity, given it may only be a non-core activity;<lb/>  explore the extent to which Guidance Notes by registrars could be produced for public<lb/> official and social entrepreneurs; and,<lb/>  allow flexibility in the choice of economic activities and potentially link the issue of mission<lb/> versus non-mission relatedness to different fiscal regimes.<lb/></p>

			<head> NGOs/associations:<lb/></head>

			<p> clarify the permissible limit of &quot; small-scale &quot; economic activity, such as through Guidance<lb/> Notes, to facilitate flexible and larger scale entrepreneurial activity; and,<lb/>  encourage them to engage in entrepreneurial activity up to this limit;<lb/>  consider inclusion of asset locks for both NGOs/associations and foundations;<lb/>  using limited company law develop model constitutions and bye-laws, but limit their access to<lb/> public funds;<lb/>  develop a sector body to introduce and oversee a social enterprise marque renewable annually,<lb/> with quality checks (partly to guard against opportunism by limited companies); this might best<lb/> be undertaken by an independent member-based trade association.<lb/></p>

			<head> Co-operatives:<lb/></head>

			<p> press for resolution to the social/public property issue and the adoption of new draft<lb/> legislation on co-operatives and the inclusion of articles or separate law for social co-<lb/>operatives;<lb/>  consideration could be given to ensuring these articles/law are relevant to both work<lb/> integration and welfare service operatives, and that they function as non-profit organisations<lb/> and that they allow multi-stakeholder structures;<lb/>  press for a change in the law allowing a reduction in the numbers required to form a co-<lb/>operative (to the same number as for associations, that is. three people), to equalise the<lb/> incentives for formation in two comparable member-based organisations; and in line with<lb/> recent legislative trends: Italian social co-operatives/social enterprises, Finnish co-<lb/>operatives/social enterprises, Belgium co-operatives/social enterprises, Spain and France; but<lb/> not Poland/Portugal (five minimum); and,<lb/>  press for a change in the law to allow secondary co-operatives to be formed;<lb/>  support the development of a network assisting new socially entrepreneurial co-operatives<lb/> could also be provided.<lb/>  as a medium-term goal, develop legislation for social enterprise; (which develops a broad<lb/> inclusive definition of the field); and,<lb/>  examine increased incentivised fiscal measures linked to each legal structure as a way of<lb/> improving the chances of sustainability.<lb/></p>

			<head>Institutional Capabilities (Governmental, Donor Community)<lb/></head>

			<p>There are a number of useful policy measures that are currently relevant to the development of social<lb/> entrepreneurship and at the national level there is a recognition of the role of social enterprise could play,<lb/> although the work integration role is dominant, and the welfare service provision role could be better<lb/> established. However, it appears that although there is a growing trend in developing institutional<lb/> capabilities to support social enterprise, most of this is relatively small-scale. Nonetheless, it may be<lb/> difficult to develop immediately a co-ordinated strategy across several ministries and programs, it may be<lb/> possible to gradually reshape each of the relevant programmes. Similarly, local government could make<lb/> important contributions to the development of social entrepreneurship. Accordingly, the gradual reshaping<lb/> of the relevant national/local government programmes could be done by:<lb/></p>

			<p> taking forward the proposals in this document with relevant local/national government and sector<lb/> stakeholders to establish a strategy for social entrepreneurship;<lb/>  establishing a new social entrepreneurship coordinative function to negotiate with relevant<lb/> responsible bodies and ensure the strategy is supported and implemented; such a function would<lb/> need to operate at the inter-ministerial level and could be located in existing bodies such as<lb/> SIPRU or OCCS;<lb/>  developing a work integration social enterprise strategy (with appropriate models and<lb/> mechanisms, with protected budget) linked both to the National Employment Service, and to the<lb/> Public Works Programme;<lb/>  capacity building of NGOs for social enterprise activity financed by the Lottery Fund;<lb/></p>

			<p> developing a social enterprise strategy for welfare service provision with local government<lb/> alongside developing a social clause niche/quota social enterprise in procurement contracts;<lb/></p>

			<p> developing a coherent framework and strategy for integrating the diversity of support measures<lb/> and potential support; and,<lb/>  co-ordinating donor communities and corporate actors in a strategy to support social<lb/> entrepreneurship, and capacity building of NGOs towards social enterprise through co-ordinated<lb/> action of relevant Sector Working Groups.<lb/></p>

			<head>Institutionalising the New Social Enterprise Sector<lb/></head>

			<p>The emerging networks for social entrepreneurship have strengths and weaknesses: they are capable<lb/> and impressive, albeit very dependent on donor support. However, as the sector grows it will be important<lb/> to legitimise these networks by developing governance structures that give a prominent place to new social<lb/> enterprise. Alongside this development it will be important to strengthen the relationship between the new<lb/> and the established social enterprise sectors.<lb/>  for the emerging networks of social entrepreneurship, help develop governance structures that<lb/> give a prominent place to new social enterprise; and,<lb/>  strengthen the relationship between the new and the established social enterprise sectors, for<lb/> example through independent chamber of commerce type model.<lb/></p>

			<head>Developing the Institutions of the Established Social Enterprise Sector<lb/></head>

			<p>The issues associated with each of the component parts of the established social enterprise sector are<lb/> different. For example, new co-operatives are being formed, with the support of international donors.<lb/> These could make a substantial contribution to addressing rural/regional inequalities, as well as support the<lb/> development of social co-operative type initiatives. There may be scope for capacity building such<lb/> entrepreneurial activity (<ref type="biblio">Ševarlić et al. 2010</ref>). This model could be adapted to social enterprise support.<lb/></p>

			<p>The following measures could improve their capacity and orientation towards social enterprise and social<lb/> entrepreneurship:<lb/>  develop the capacity of NGOs, particularly of medium and large NGOs, to generate income<lb/> streams and engage in welfare service provision and procurement contracts (such as the UK<lb/> Futurebuilders programme mentioned below);<lb/>  explore the extent to which foundations could be a useful interim structure for social enterprise,<lb/> and, support medium and large foundations to develop brands and donation potential – possibly<lb/> through partnership with international charitable organisations;<lb/>  build the entrepreneurial capacity of new co-operatives, such as through development bodies, and<lb/> federal structures (also to promote good practices in governance, etc.); and,<lb/>  with regard to companies for the disabled, address the issue of delayed payments and, at the<lb/> same time, undertake a review of their performance with regard to the effective integration of<lb/> disabled people into work.<lb/></p>

			<head>Improve Business Support Infrastructure<lb/></head>

			<p>It is important to ensure that social enterprise have full access to SME programmes of support. In fact,<lb/> as a principle of achieving equitable support with the SME sector, it is important to ensure that most<lb/> elements of policy and legislation referring to SME support are fully and explicitly inclusive of social<lb/> enterprise and their distinctive requirements. Develop the capacity for &quot; braided &quot; support of social<lb/> enterprise, for example by developing a network of social enterprise trainers.<lb/>  ensure that social enterprises have full access to SME programmes of support at national and<lb/> local levels;<lb/>  develop the capacity for &quot; braided &quot; support of social enterprise, for example by developing a<lb/> network of social enterprise trainers; and,<lb/>  make full use of available EU funding streams to establish projects for the development of social<lb/> enterprise (including training/education at various levels).<lb/></p>

			<head>Recommendations to Improve Governance<lb/></head>

			<p>The issue of vertical integration of policy, including the development of well functioning and well-<lb/>informed public officials at the local level has been mentioned, and this clearly a generic issue, although<lb/> one that is likely to affect activities that are not so mainstream such as social enterprise and social<lb/> entrepreneurship. Serbia is not unique in this respect, and in many countries strategies to develop<lb/> recognition and legitimacy for social enterprise are necessary. Effective strategies have included<lb/> developing local examples of good practices through partnership projects between municipalities and<lb/> social enterprise. For example, one such project was EU funded for developing good practice in the use of<lb/> social clauses for social entrepreneurship in welfare provision.<lb/></p>

			<p>Another important governance issue is strengthening the relationship with the social enterprise sector<lb/> and government at different levels. It is important to gradually develop a system of co-governance at all<lb/> levels, between national, municipal and regional bodies, and social economy organisations. This was<lb/> mentioned above with regard to the new social enterprise sector; but is equally important to develop this<lb/> capability with the established social economy sector. Thus, this might include support for the<lb/> development of a social economy coalition that brings together the NGOs, foundations and co-operatives;<lb/> the development of horizontal networks across these pillars of the social economy may initially function<lb/> better at the municipal level around areas of common interest, and where networks of learning and good<lb/> practice might be supported by EU programme funding. As outlined above, it is important to have an inter-<lb/>ministerial co-ordinative function for social entrepreneurship which would play a key role in policy<lb/> governance in this area.<lb/>  develop good practice partnership projects between municipalities and social enterprise, such as<lb/> with EU funding, for developing good practice in the use of social clauses for social<lb/> entrepreneurship in welfare provision;<lb/></p>

			<p> consider support for the development of a social economy coalition that brings together NGOs,<lb/> foundations and co-operatives, initially at the municipal level through the development of<lb/> horizontal networks across these pillars of the social economy with EU programme funding;<lb/>  improve vertical and horizontal policy integration for social entrepreneurship through<lb/> administrative guidelines;<lb/>  capacity building, communication, education and training of relevant administrative officials<lb/> about relevant policy frameworks; and,<lb/>  gradually develop a system of co-governance with municipal and regional bodies together with<lb/> social economy organisations.<lb/></p>

			<head>Recommendations to Improve Finance<lb/></head>

			<p>Finance is a central issue for social entrepreneurship, firstly because social enterprise needs to access<lb/> conventional sources of finance, and typically there are barriers there which need to be removed; secondly<lb/> because social enterprise generally support the most disadvantaged in society, some form of subsidy or<lb/> preferential financial arrangement is often required; and, thirdly, because the transition from project<lb/> funding for start-up to sustainable social enterprise requires careful design of a comprehensive framework<lb/> of financial institutions and instruments to support the different phases of social enterprise development.<lb/> This might include grants for feasibility studies and the development of business plans, low costs rose in<lb/> incubators for the first 18 months of business development, loan guarantee systems, and specialist financial<lb/> institutions to act in a venture capitalist type role supporting growth of the social enterprise. EU funds and<lb/> funding institutions will play an increasingly important role in this area. In addition, consideration could<lb/> be given to programmes to support social entrepreneurs, such as the business support grants of UnLtd 11<lb/> (UK) which are funded through a foundation.<lb/> Access to an efficient and lower cost micro-finance system is a very important issue for social<lb/> enterprise, particularly when helping disadvantaged individuals and communities improve their lives<lb/> through economic activity.<lb/> Not all these measures need to be derived from state funds; the development of community/social<lb/> investment funds can be promoted through fiscal measures which might motivate corporations to donate<lb/> finance to specialist funds from their corporate social responsibility budgets. In addition asset transfer<lb/> policies by municipalities and other public bodies may provide buildings that can be used as low rent<lb/> incubators giving financial and developmental support to newly-formed social enterprise.<lb/> A comprehensive framework of financial institutions and instruments to support the different phases<lb/> of social enterprise development could be designed including:<lb/>  link activities/support from Budget and Lottery Funds enabling access for NGOs, social<lb/> enterprises and companies for the disabled;<lb/>  the recently announced consultation on the establishment of a Social Inclusion Fund in the<lb/> Republic of Serbia could also play an important role by strategically coordinating national and<lb/> future EU funds for social inclusion;<lb/>  measures to address the conservative attitude of banks, possibly through government-sponsored<lb/> loan guarantee systems;<lb/>  promote legislation to establish a comprehensive framework for micro-finance, so that it does not<lb/> need to be channelled through the banks and is appropriately regulated in line with international<lb/> experience;<lb/>  develop a comprehensive framework to support the financial needs of social entrepreneurs during<lb/> start-up, development and growth of social enterprise;<lb/>  design a system of grants for feasibility studies and the development of business plans, low cost<lb/> rents in incubators for the first 18 months of business development, loan guarantee systems, and<lb/> specialist financial institutions to act in a venture capitalist type role supporting growth of the<lb/> social enterprise;<lb/>  consider programmes to support social entrepreneurs, such as funding through a foundation;<lb/> (with a possible endowment through international donor/CSR partnership);<lb/>  consider the development of credit unions community development finance initiatives (supported<lb/> through fiscal measures); and,<lb/>  examine asset transfer policies by municipalities and other public bodies to provide buildings for<lb/> low rent incubators.<lb/></p>

			<head>Recommendations to Improve Skills<lb/></head>

			<p>Chapter 3 developed a typology of skills relevant for social entrepreneurship. It appears that the first<lb/> area of skills – skills for social inclusion – is relatively well-developed in Serbia, particularly in the area of<lb/> disability. But the skill sets associated with integrating disadvantaged people may need more support from<lb/> education and training institutions. Thus, vocational training institutions may be able to develop short<lb/> courses for social enterprises working in this area, and this may be an area where EU funding would be<lb/> appropriate, for example through Leonardo da Vinci funding – see for example the Leonardo funded<lb/> Ariadne project for training managers in the social economy (http://www.social-economy-training.eu/).<lb/> The second category, skills for entrepreneurship and management (marketing, finance in particular,<lb/> business planning and development), is the most important area. It would seem essential to ensure that<lb/> social entrepreneurs have full access to SME training and mentoring programs – particularly government<lb/> programs, but also CSR, and donor partnership programs. This requires ensuring associated legislation and<lb/> policy is inclusive of social enterprise, and that the training is customised to the distinctive needs of social<lb/> enterprise, and that this is communicated to the social entrepreneurs.<lb/></p>

			<p>In addition to this, the distinctive features of social enterprise imply that specialist training<lb/> programmes would be required to cope with what is available from SME training facilities. If this is well-<lb/>designed it should become an integrated system of braided support.<lb/></p>

			<p>There is currently an emphasis in SME development on identifying &quot; gazelles &quot;<lb/> – those enterprises with high growth potential (10% per annum); a similar programme to that being<lb/> developed for SMEs could be designed for social enterprise. However, there is also extensive international<lb/> experience of capacity building agreements between public bodies and social enterprise; this has led to<lb/> well-developed capacity building programmes over a number of years, such as UK Futurebuilders – this<lb/> programme ran for eight years working with medium and large social enterprises to develop their<lb/> managerial capabilities in order to engage in public service contracts. There are other initiatives that go<lb/> beyond capacity building to develop skills for growth and scaling, and develop models such as social<lb/> franchising which may also be relevant in Serbia.<lb/></p>

			<p>The third category of skills – skills for meeting regulatory, reporting requirements, advocacy, and<lb/> negotiating with bureaucracy – is clearly important, but might best be addressed through partnership<lb/> projects between public bodies and social enterprise development agents. The EU funded EQUAL<lb/> programme gave support to social procurement involving public bodies and social enterprise – some of the<lb/> useful documents from this programme are still relevant and available online, and could be useful to<lb/> explore.<lb/> The same applies to the final category of skills – skills for development of social enterprise – since<lb/> development workers within projects and networks and ministries/municipalities would benefit most from<lb/> developing networks amongst themselves so that they can become a community of practitioners, and share<lb/> understandings of best practices. Such a network is also likely to benefit from international exchanges and<lb/> partnerships through EU projects. Note that skills development includes building capacity of<lb/> administrative officials through communication, education, and training, which is discussed under the<lb/> infrastructure theme.<lb/> Recommendations:<lb/>  ensure that social entrepreneurs are made aware of, and have full access to, SME training and<lb/> mentoring programmes that are properly tailored to their specific needs; particularly government<lb/> programs, but also CSR, and donor partnership programs;<lb/>  ensure that SME related legislation and policy is inclusive of social enterprise;<lb/>  explore the development specialist training programmes specifically for social enterprise needs;<lb/>  examine the policy of picking winners, that is of identifying high growth social enterprise<lb/> &quot; gazelles &quot; ;<lb/>  develop capacity building agreements between public bodies and social enterprise for medium<lb/> sized social enterprise;<lb/>  examine the potential to develop scaling models such as social franchising;<lb/>  explore project funding for skills aimed at meeting regulatory, reporting requirements, advocacy,<lb/> and negotiating with bureaucracy – such as through available EU programmes; and,<lb/>  explore project funding for skills aimed at social enterprise development workers, for example<lb/> through available EU funding.<lb/></p>

			<head>Recommendations to Improve Access to Markets<lb/></head>

			<p>This is a major strategic area in the development of social enterprise in Serbia. Having designed<lb/> appropriate legal, fiscal and policy frameworks for social entrepreneurship, the issue is whether public<lb/> service niche/quotas (protected markets) can be opened for social enterprise under social clause policies,<lb/> without attracting opportunists. The 2008 Law on Public Procurement has provided a framework for<lb/> designing such an arrangement of social clauses in public procurement markets, but it appears not to have<lb/> been explored (the new draft law could enhance this possibility, building on SIPRU&apos;s consultative<lb/> contribution). It would seem appropriate to initiate some pilot projects to explore this option on a small<lb/> scale in sectors relevant to current social enterprise activity such as homecare, or eldercare (for example,<lb/> meals on wheels). The other areas for the development of strategy and policy are in support of social<lb/> enterprise operating in ethical markets; improving access to donations and legacies; and strengthening CSR<lb/> relations. Measures might include:<lb/>  examining the potential of using the</p>

			<table>2008 Law on Public Procurement (the new draft law<lb/> discussed in 2012 could enhance this possibility) as a framework for designing social clauses in<lb/> public procurement markets, by initiating some pilot projects in key areas such as homecare or<lb/> eldercare (for example, Meals on Wheels);<lb/>  building partnerships with international organisations operating in ethical markets;<lb/>  building capacity of large NGOs for acquisition of donations and legacies;<lb/>  considering increasing tax breaks for donations;<lb/>  considering give-as-you-earn charitable donation systems through payroll deductions; and,<lb/>  strengthening relationships between social enterprise and corporate social responsibility<lb/> institutions.<lb/></table>

			<figure>CHAPTER 5: ACTION PLAN – A STAGED APPROACH OF DEVELOPMENTS FROM<lb/> FEASIBLE TO DESIRABLE<lb/></figure>

			<p>This chapter briefly outlines a staged approach of recommended actions for: short term, medium term,<lb/> and longer term. The logic of the timings is partly what is more important, but also that some<lb/> recommendations, though important take time, such as new legislation.<lb/></p>

			<p>The action plan follows the same theme as the main study: Preconditions, Infrastructure, Governance,<lb/> Finance, Skills, and</p>

			<table>Access to Markets. Taken together these comprise a strategy for social<lb/> entrepreneurship, which requires a new co-ordinative function to be established to negotiate with<lb/> relevant government and sector bodies and ensure the strategy is supported and implemented; such a<lb/> function would need to operate at the inter-ministerial level and could be located in existing bodies such as<lb/> SIPRU (Social Inclusion and Poverty Reduction Unit) or OCCS (Office for Co-operation with Civil<lb/> Society).<lb/> The main priorities for the short, medium and long term action are:<lb/> Recommendations to Improve Preconditions<lb/> What<lb/> How<lb/> Who<lb/> Short to Medium-Term<lb/> Develop a public<lb/> relations strategy<lb/> for social<lb/> entrepreneurship,<lb/> which could include:<lb/>  promoting models of good practices;<lb/>  attracting public figures and celebrities to social<lb/> entrepreneurship,<lb/> including<lb/> via<lb/> corporate<lb/> social<lb/> responsibility;<lb/>  competitions for best social enterprise and best social<lb/> entrepreneurs of the year;<lb/>  the use of online media (Group 484&apos;s electronic<lb/> &quot; Newsletter on Social Entrepreneurship &quot; is one such<lb/> example);<lb/>  strengthening research/policy/media networking so that<lb/> sympathetic journalists are properly briefed; and,<lb/>  raising the profile of social entrepreneurship in corporate<lb/> social responsibility programmes.<lb/> SIPRU in collaboration with<lb/> the Coalition for the<lb/> Development of Social<lb/> Entrepreneurship<lb/>  developing a few sector strategies as exemplars of<lb/> effective social enterprise approaches to the informal<lb/> economy, such as in recycling;.<lb/> Coalition<lb/> for<lb/> the<lb/> Development<lb/> of<lb/> Social<lb/> Entrepreneurship<lb/> with<lb/> sponsors,<lb/> such<lb/> as<lb/> international donors.<lb/></table>

			<p> press for resolution to the social/public property issue and the<lb/> adoption of new draft legislation on co-operatives and the inclusion of<lb/> the articles or separate law for social co-operatives;<lb/>  consideration could be given to ensuring these articles/law are<lb/> relevant to both work integration and welfare service operatives, and<lb/> that they function as non-profit organisations and that they allow<lb/> multi-stakeholder structures;<lb/>  press for a change in the law allowing a reduction in the numbers<lb/> required to form a co-operative (to the same number as for<lb/> associations);<lb/>  press for a change in the law to allow secondary co-operatives to be<lb/> formed;<lb/>  support the development of a network assisting new socially<lb/> entrepreneurial co-operative could also be provided.<lb/></p>

			<head>GLOSSARY<lb/></head>

			<p>Charity: An organisation, trust or foundation established to pursue philanthropic objectives and<lb/> providing some kind of public benefit. Charities are not owned by anyone, and are governed by trustees<lb/> who are required to pursue the purposes for which the charity was established. In many countries, charities<lb/> have certain tax privileges.<lb/></p>

			<head>Civil society:</head>

			<p>Civil society may be defined as a space or arena between households and the state,<lb/> which affords possibilities of concerted action and social organisation. Thus, it encompasses all voluntary<lb/> associations of citizens, whether politically motivated or active or not (although the term carries an<lb/> implication of political consciousness and activity): business, labour, non-governmental organisations,<lb/> churches, special interest or purpose groups. These elements are the constituents of civil society, but none<lb/> can individually be representative of it. Business is often excluded, although the OECD does include it,<lb/> given that channels of communication between traditional organised business and labour and government<lb/> are generally well established. Most frequently the term is used interchangeably with &quot; NGOs &quot; where the<lb/> term &quot; NGO &quot; refers specifically to activist groups, although these are simply one category of civil society<lb/> as a whole.<lb/></p>

			<head>Collective enterprise:</head>

			<p>A short-hand term for collectively owned enterprises: co-operatives, mutuals,<lb/> non-profit organisations and foundations.<lb/></p>

			<head>Companies for the disabled:</head>

			<p>These are the only officially recognised legal form of social enterprise<lb/> in Serbia; they provide vocational rehabilitation and employment for people with disabilities. About half of<lb/> these are majority state owned, and half privately owned.</p>

			<head>The Law on Professional Rehabilitation and<lb/> Employment of Persons with Disabilities specifies</head>

			<p>the term social enterprise as a separate subcategory and<lb/> links it to addressing the needs of people with disabilities. The implication of this is that a social enterprise<lb/> provides services for people disabilities, and should employ at least one person with a disability. At the<lb/> same time, the Law requires that at least five people with disabilities should be employed and the<lb/> proportion of employees with disabilities should be at least 50% including 10% with special employment<lb/> needs. The law gives tax relief on profits proportionate to the numbers with disabilities (Article 46).<lb/></p>

			<head>Co-operative:</head>

			<p>A co-operative is an association of persons united voluntarily to meet their common<lb/> economic, social and cultural needs and aspirations through a jointly-owned and democratically-controlled<lb/> enterprise. Examples of co-operatives in Europe can be traced back to the 19th century. The International<lb/> Labour Organisation has suggested that co-operatives should be based on the values of self-help, self-<lb/>responsibility, democracy, equality, equity, and solidarity and share the principles of: voluntary and open<lb/> membership; democratic member control; member economic participation; autonomy and independence;<lb/> education, training and information; co-operation among co-operatives; and, concern for the community,<lb/> which were identified by the International Co-operative Alliance in 1995. A co-operative includes one or<lb/> more kinds of users or stakeholders: 1) consumers who use the enterprise to acquire products or services<lb/> (such as a retail co-operative, housing, healthcare or day-care co-operatives); 2) producers (such as<lb/> independent entrepreneurs, artisans, or farmers) who use the enterprise to process and market the goods or<lb/> services they produce, or to buy products or services necessary to their professional activities; and, 3)<lb/> workers who use the enterprise to secure their employment and control their working conditions. Co-<lb/>operatives operate democratically (one person, one vote) through two bodies (general meeting of the<lb/> members or delegates, and a board of directors, which is composed of members elected at a general<lb/> meeting). The delegate structure may be required to reflect the size of the organisation or the distance<lb/> covered by the co-operative. The co-operative&apos;s start-up capital usually comes from co-operative shares<lb/> purchased by members. Since 1980, special co-operatives, known as social co-operatives, have become<lb/> more widespread in OECD member countries.<lb/></p>

			<head>Foundation(s):</head>

			<p>Foundations are philanthropic organisations, organised and operated primarily as a<lb/> permanent collection of endowed funds, the earnings of which are used for the long-term benefit of a<lb/> defined geographical community or non-profit sector activity. Foundations operate as grant-making<lb/> institutions, and also as providers of social, health and cultural services. They thus provide a significant<lb/> link between the private and non-profit sectors, acting as a recipient of private capital and a funder of non-<lb/>profit organisations. Foundations are tax-exempt; incorporated; not-for-profit; organisationally<lb/> autonomous; and, cannot be controlled directly or indirectly by government at any level, corporations,<lb/> associations and their members, or individuals. They occupy a unique and central place in the non-profit<lb/> sector and therefore the development of foundations will strongly affect the future of the sector as a whole.<lb/></p>

			<head>Mutual organisations/societies:</head>

			<p>A mutual organisation is an organisation owned and managed by its<lb/> members and that serves the interests of its members. Mutual organisations can take the form of self-help<lb/> groups, friendly societies and co-operatives. Mutual organisations exclude shareholding as they bring<lb/> together members who seek to provide a shared service from which they all benefit. They are widely<lb/> represented in the insurance sector.<lb/></p>

			<head>Non-governmental Organisation (NGO):</head>

			<p>An NGO is a legally constituted organisation with no direct<lb/> representation or participation by government. Even if many NGOs receive funding from government, they<lb/> retain their &quot; non-government &quot; identity because of their autonomy. Today, there are numerous national and<lb/> international NGOs with an increased role in poverty reduction, social inclusion, environmental protection,<lb/> social justice, to name a few. Many NGOs rely also on private contributions in the form of donations.<lb/> NGOs include many civil society organisations directly and/or indirectly. The work of NGOs has increased<lb/> substantially in the last two decades as has their fragility given their reliance on public funding in most<lb/> cases. Most NGOs are organisationally and legally equivalent to non-profit organisations (NPOs), although<lb/> a small minority may have not-just-for-profit corporate structures.<lb/></p>

			<head>Non-profit sector:</head>

			<p>The best known definition, while not commonly shared, particularly in European<lb/> countries, is undoubtedly that supplied by the Johns Hopkins University (www.jhu.edu/~cnp/). According<lb/> to this definition, the sector includes organisations which are voluntary, formal, private, self-governing and<lb/> which do not distribute profits, such as hospitals, universities, social clubs, professional organisations, day-<lb/>care centres, environmental groups, family counselling agencies, sports clubs, job training centres, human<lb/> rights organisations, and others. In fact, entities belonging to the non-profit sector can vary from country to<lb/> country according to national history and tradition. The term non-profit, emanating from the USA, refers<lb/> mainly to the absence of profit distribution. This is substantially different to the European approach of<lb/> &quot; social economy &quot; , which includes co-operatives. However, this difference is less significant when<lb/> investigated through empirical research. Borzaga and Defourny (The Emergence of Social Enterprise,<lb/> 2001, Routledge, London) argue that the distribution of profits is, in any case, limited by internal and<lb/> external regulations in co-operatives and mutual organisations in European countries.<lb/></p>

			<head>Social economy:</head>

			<p>The term &quot; social economy &quot; first appeared at the beginning of the 19 th century in<lb/> France. It was, nevertheless, only at the beginning of the 20 th century that it began to be used to indicate<lb/> various entities aimed at improving collective working conditions and individual lives. This concept is now<lb/> also used by Anglo-Saxon countries to refer to the production of goods and services provided not solely by<lb/> the non-profit sector, but also, in some cases, by private enterprises with shareholder agreements that force<lb/> the majority of shareholders to agree to social objectives undertaken by the firm. Among the organisations<lb/> belonging to the social economy, one can find associations, co-operatives, mutual organisations and<lb/> foundations. This type of economy is essentially regulated by the stakeholder principle, which stands in<lb/> stark contrast to the notion of shareholder capitalism. The &quot; social economy &quot; is a broader concept than the<lb/> non-profit sector, as it is less strictly bound to the non-distributional constraint, according to which<lb/> organisations cannot legally redistribute their surplus to their owners (see also &quot; third sector &quot; ).<lb/></p>

			<head>Social enterprise: Social</head>

			<p>enterprise refers to an organisation form which has flourished in recent years<lb/> and for which various definitions exist. Alongside academic definitions, and those elaborated by<lb/> international organisations, which are built around general criteria, there are definitions used within<lb/> countries that are specific to the national understanding of the phenomenon of social enterprise.<lb/> Increasingly countries are developing formal legal definitions of social enterprise. Generally, this concept<lb/> refers to any private activity conducted in the public interest, organised with an entrepreneurial strategy<lb/> and whose main purpose is not the maximisation of profit, but the attainment of certain economic and<lb/> social goals, and which, through the production of goods and services, brings innovative solutions to<lb/> problems such as social exclusion and unemployment (see Social Enterprises, OECD, 1999). In this way,<lb/> social enterprises combine the entrepreneurial skills of the private sector with a strong social mission that<lb/> is characteristic of the social economy as a whole. Social enterprises are part of the thriving and growing<lb/> collection of organisations that exist between the private and public sectors. They come in a variety of<lb/> forms including employee owned businesses, credit unions, co-operatives, social co-operatives,<lb/> development trusts, social firms, intermediate labour market organisations, community businesses, or<lb/> charities&apos; trading arms. They mainly operate in two fields of activity: the training and integration into<lb/> employment of persons excluded from the labour market, and the delivery of personal and welfare<lb/> services.<lb/></p>

			<head>Third sector:</head>

			<p>The concept of &quot; third sector &quot; is often used as a synonym to the non-profit sector and,<lb/> more recently, also to &quot; social economy &quot; , notably in the British literature. The term was chosen to reflect<lb/> the idea that the sector assembles these otherwise disjointed entities, and that it sits between the public and<lb/> private sectors and follows unique social goals and internal organisational rules. Its mode of financing is<lb/> mixed, as it can seek both private and public funding. The idea of establishing a distinct &quot; third sector &quot; has<lb/> given rise to many hefty debates, which have centred upon the danger of using the third sector as a residual<lb/> sphere or &quot; dumping ground &quot; for those individuals excluded from the private and public sectors. To avoid<lb/> the danger of social polarisation, the third sector should not merely be seen as an alternative route or<lb/> juxtaposition to the public and private sectors, but as an interactive and reflexive component of economy<lb/> and society. Others have argued that the boundaries of the third sector cannot be established with certainty,<lb/> and for this controversial reason the European Commission preferred the use of the term &quot; Third System &quot; .<lb/></p>

			<head>ANNEX 1: EU SOCIAL BUSINESS INITIATIVE<lb/></head>

			<p>With regard to social entrepreneurship, the EU proposes to create a favourable climate for social<lb/> enterprises, key stakeholders in the social economy, and innovation, through the following action plan:<lb/></p>

			<figure>To support social entrepreneurship in Europe:<lb/>  Improving access to funding<lb/>  Facilitating access to private funding<lb/>  Mobilisation of EU funds<lb/>  Increasing the visibility of social entrepreneurship<lb/>  Developing tools to gain a better understanding of the sector and increase the visibility of<lb/> social entrepreneurship<lb/>  Reinforcing the managerial capacities, professionalism and networking of social businesses<lb/>  Improving the legal environment<lb/>  Developing appropriate European legal forms which could be used in European social<lb/> entrepreneurship<lb/>  Public procurement<lb/>  State aid<lb/> (European Commission, 2011b)<lb/></figure>

				<formula>NOTES<lb/> 1<lb/></formula>

			<p>The UK&apos;s Community Interest Company legislation provides some indications of the kinds of measures<lb/> that might be incorporated into bye-laws to constrain opportunistic behavior – such as asset lock, dividend<lb/> caps, and an annual community interest report;<lb/> (see http://www.bis.gov.uk/cicregulator and http://www.cicassociation.org.uk/about/what-is-a-cic; however<lb/> bye-laws can be changed by a company, thus some form of continuing branding such as a social enterprise<lb/> marque<lb/> (brand)<lb/> could<lb/> help<lb/> to<lb/> reduce<lb/> the<lb/> risk<lb/> of<lb/> opportunistic<lb/> behavior<lb/> http://www.socialenterprisemark.org.uk/the-mark/get-the-<lb/>mark/?gclid=CK21oInm4bECFRGBfAodmzUAQA)<lb/> 2<lb/> This operates through the National Employment Service to provide employment for disadvantaged people<lb/> through public tenders to conduct activities in: social, humanitarian, cultural and other sectors,<lb/> maintenance and rehabilitation of public infrastructure, maintenance and protection of environment and<lb/> nature.<lb/></p>

			<head>3<lb/></head>

			<p>An asset lock is used in the UK&apos;s Community Interest Company legislation, as well as in many European<lb/> Co-operative laws. An asset lock prevents profits from being distributed to its members or shareholders<lb/> other than in certain limited circumstances. It also means that all assets must be used for the community<lb/> purpose or, if they are sold, open market value must be obtained for them and the proceeds used for the<lb/> community purpose. In addition, if the CIC is wound up, its assets must be transferred to another, similarly<lb/> asset-locked body.<lb/> 4<lb/> &quot; Braided &quot; business support is based on the view that SME business support caters for the typical business<lb/> and the typical entrepreneur; and the need to recognise firstly that disadvantaged groups have special<lb/> support requirements, and social enterprise have distinctive features that need specialist advice – thus<lb/> &quot; braided &quot; support combines standard mainstream provision with specialist support (<ref type="biblio">GHK et al., 2006</ref>).<lb/> 5<lb/> However, current research argues that the design of Serbia&apos;s employment tax and benefit system helps<lb/> explain this, by effectively excluding low wage and part-time workers:<lb/> &quot; The reason for the high tax wedge at lower wage levels in Serbia are the minimum social security<lb/> contributions that employees and employers have to pay. The minimum social security contribution is not<lb/> adjusted for hours actually worked, so also part-time workers are subject to it. Additionally, once a person<lb/> has a formal work on his record there is a sudden withdrawal of social assistance and family benefits. The<lb/> marginal effective tax shows that, at low wage levels (below 10 percent of average wage), every dinar<lb/> earned is subtracted from entitlements to social assistance. Hence, 100 percent of any additional dinar<lb/> earned is taxed away. Therefore, the so-called mini-jobs and midi-jobs (mainly part-time jobs) are not<lb/> economically viable for low-wage earners. This effectively excludes a substantial part of the Serbian<lb/> working-age population from formal employment and social security coverage &quot; (<ref type="biblio">Randjelovic et al., 2012</ref>).<lb/> 6<lb/> The picture is complicated due to re-registrations under the new law; 28 448 associations were registered in<lb/> 2011, about 15 000 of which were re-registering under the new law; there were about 8000 sports clubs,<lb/> and approximately 5000 are associations that are not autonomous.<lb/> 7<lb/> The Social Innovation Fund was based in the Ministry of Labour and Social Policy, with support from<lb/> UNDP, the EU, other governments and NGOs. From 2003 to 2009 EUR 6 million were invested in the<lb/> development of local social welfare services.<lb/> 8<lb/> For example in January 2011 at a conference discussing draft legislation for co-operatives in Serbia, Ms.<lb/> Dragijana Radonjic Petrovic, State Secretary at the Ministry of Economy and Regional Development<lb/> stated: &quot; The main issue with the co-operatives is related to public property. We hope that the new law will<lb/> solve this issue. In addition to existing youth and agricultural cooperatives, new law will also introduce<lb/> social co-operatives. &quot;<lb/> (see:<lb/> http://www.undp.org.rs/index.cfm?event=public.newsDetails&amp;revid=47EDC346-956A-5522-<lb/>548E8EC321461E3F)<lb/> 9<lb/> New EU proposals for procurement which if approved will come into effect in 2014 will reduce the<lb/> transactions costs of tendering for SMEs (relevant also to social enterprise), and broaden the scope for<lb/> sheltered workshops for disabled and disadvantaged workers;<lb/> (see: http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/publicprocurement/modernising_rules/reform_proposals_en.htm)<lb/> 10<lb/> As reported to the OECD team on several occasions, and documented in the literature: &quot; This may reflect a<lb/> resistance to the idea of co-operatives, which are often identified as being part of the &apos;old regime&apos; in<lb/> Serbia. It may also reflect a low level of understanding of what genuine co-operatives can achieve (as<lb/> demonstrated widely throughout the world) &quot; (<ref type="biblio">Simmons et al. 2010</ref>) and &quot; a bad image of cooperatives<lb/> inherited from socialist time, which prevents the establishment of new cooperatives. &quot; (EMES<ref type="biblio">, 2008)<lb/></ref> 11<lb/> UnLtd, the Foundation for Social Entrepreneurs, is a charity which was endowed with GBP 100 million<lb/> from UK lottery money in 2002. It uses the income from this endowment to fund awards to different types<lb/> of awards for projects and people with growth potential.</p>
