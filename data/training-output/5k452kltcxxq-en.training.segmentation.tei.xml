			<body>ABSTRACT/RÉSUMÉ <lb/>Challenges to sustain Poland&apos;s growth model <lb/>Notwithstanding a very strong economic performance over the past decade or so, Poland&apos;s per capita <lb/>income is substantially lower in comparison with the United States and per capita income growth will be <lb/>sharply slowing down over the coming decades under the scenario of gradual policy changes mostly <lb/>because of population ageing. Bold structural reforms are needed to boost labour productivity and labour <lb/>resource utilisation. This paper argues that in order to increase labour resource utilisation, policy action <lb/>should focus on raising the effective retirement age, encourage childbearing and lower high unemployment <lb/>rates for young people and the unskilled via increased and more efficient active labour market policies. <lb/>Labour productivity could be boosted via rendering the tax system more growth friendly, reducing product <lb/>market regulation (including heavy government involvement in the economy, high administrative costs of <lb/>running and starting businesses and increasing competition in uncompetitive segments of the economy). <lb/>Investing in human capital and encouraging innovation are also essential for long-term productivity <lb/>growth. <lb/>JEL classification codes: E6 ; F3 ; F4 ; N4 <lb/>Keywords: Poland; economic growth; potential growth; structural reforms <lb/>************ <lb/>Les défis pour soutenir le modèle de croissance économique en Pologne <lb/>En dépit d&apos;une performance économique remarquable au cours de la dernière décennie, le PIB par habitant <lb/>de la Pologne est nettement plus faible en comparaison avec les États-Unis et la croissance du PIB par tête <lb/>va fortement ralentir au cours des prochaines décennies, selon un scénario de changements progressifs de <lb/>politiques économiques essentiellement en raison du vieillissement de la population.

			<body>Challenges to sustain Poland&apos;s growth model <lb/>By <lb/>Balázs Égert and Rafał Kierzenkowski 1 <lb/>Past growth performance has been strong <lb/>Poland has recorded robust GDP growth since the beginning of the transition process and a strong <lb/>resilience during the global crisis, which led to pronounced gains in the standards of living. The average <lb/>annual growth rate in GDP per capita reached 4.0% between 2000 and 2011, against 1.8% for the OECD <lb/>average, and was higher than in other Central and Eastern European countries (Figure 1). Between 2000 <lb/>and 2011, rises in labour productivity fed the catch-up process mainly owing to advances in multi-factor <lb/>productivity, whose contribution to per capita income growth was more than 3 percentage points. The <lb/>liberalisation of the domestic economy coupled with greater knowledge and technology transfers from <lb/>abroad led to major improvements in labour efficiency. However, despite significant increases in the <lb/>capital stock, capital intensity subtracted 0.5 percentage point from annual growth in GDP per capita. This <lb/>was similar to the Slovak Republic but in contrast with a positive contribution recorded in Estonia, <lb/>Hungary and Slovenia. Poland&apos;s growth model benefitted comparatively less from foreign direct <lb/>investment inflows and from a business climate and regulations less conducive to greater investments. <lb/>Human capital contributed positively to growth by almost 0.5 percentage point, more than for other <lb/>regional peers. This reflects Poland&apos;s progress in educational attainment and the quality of its secondary <lb/>education as confirmed by good PISA (Programme for International Student Assessment) scores, in <lb/>particular in mathematics and science. Finally, steady decreases in the unemployment rate underpinned <lb/>employment rises and growth, notably driven by better training of the unemployed, a higher share of <lb/>workers with better qualifications and less labour market mismatch (Kierzenkowski et al., 2008). <lb/>But there is a long way to go to close the per capita income gap to the most advanced OECD nations <lb/>Despite a strong performance over the recent past, per capita income is almost 90% lower than in the <lb/>United States, and this gap is mainly explained by a shortfall in labour productivity (Figure 2). 2 Even <lb/>though overall labour resource utilisation is not significantly lagging, its breakdown shows that average <lb/>annual hours worked are high and the activity rate is low. The combination of low labour market <lb/>participation and high unemployment results in a low employment rate. The participation rate of the <lb/>working-age population (15 to 64 years) in Poland is among the lowest in Europe: around 65% against <lb/>rates close or even beyond 80% in the Nordic countries. The major explanation is reduced activity of older <lb/>workers, low-skilled workers and women. Figure 3 shows that only every second individual between <lb/>1. <lb/>The authors are members of the Economics Department of the OECD. The authors are thankful to <lb/>Mee-Lan Frank for excellent editorial support. The views expressed herein in no way represent those of the <lb/>OECD nor its Member countries. <lb/>2. <lb/>Per capita income (GDP per person) can be broken down into labour productivity (GDP per hour worked) <lb/>and labour utilisation (total hours worked per person). <lb/></body>

Activity rate in working-age population and specific groups in the European Union <lb/>2012:Q3 <lb/>Source: Eurostat. <lb/>the age of 50 to 6 years is active against four out of five in Iceland and Sweden. Even more striking is the <lb/>fact that fewer than one-third of those with low educational attainment participates in the labour market, <lb/>which compares with nearly 80% in Iceland and 70% in Switzerland. Female participation is also low in a <lb/>European context, even though the absolute level of 60% is less striking. <lb/>These low participation rates are a heritage of transition from central planning to a market economy: <lb/>the collapse of heavy industry after the start of the economic transformation left behind a mass of <lb/>low-skilled middle-aged men and women, who did not have the ability to update their human capital. <lb/>Disability and early retirement pension schemes offered them an escape route to withdraw from the labour <lb/>market. OECD data indicate that the effective retirement age in Poland is among the lowest in the OECD, <lb/>especially for women, and that the gap between the effective and the official retirement age is substantial. <lb/>In addition, public spending on incapacity benefits amounted to almost 3% of GDP in 2007, above the <lb/>OECD average, but close to figures of fellow transition countries, indicating the large number of <lb/>individuals involved. <lb/>Population ageing is a major challenge for growth <lb/>Recent OECD long-term projections suggest that Poland&apos;s growth model will face major challenges <lb/>as the population ages owing to declines in fertility and overall gains in longevity (Johansson et al., 2012). <lb/>These projections indicate that per capita income growth will be among the lowest over the decades to <lb/>come (Figure 4). The share of the working-age population (15-64) in the total, currently above 70%, is <lb/>projected to drop to below 55% by 2060. In parallel, the old-age dependency ratio measuring the share of <lb/>the population older than 65 to working-age population (15-64) is expected to jump from around 20% in <lb/>0.0 <lb/>10.0 <lb/>20.0 <lb/>30.0 <lb/>40.0 <lb/>50.0 <lb/>60.0 <lb/>70.0 <lb/>80.0 <lb/>90.0 <lb/>Italy <lb/>Malta <lb/>Hungary <lb/>Romania <lb/>Luxembourg <lb/>Poland <lb/>Greece <lb/>Belgium <lb/>Bulgaria <lb/>Ireland <lb/>Slovakia <lb/>Slovenia <lb/>France <lb/>Czech Republic <lb/>Lithuania <lb/>Spain <lb/>Portugal <lb/>Latvia <lb/>Estonia <lb/>Finland <lb/>United Kingdom <lb/>Austria <lb/>Germany… <lb/>Norway <lb/>Denmark <lb/>Netherlands <lb/>Sweden <lb/>Switzerland <lb/>Iceland <lb/>Croatia <lb/>activity rate, 15 to 64 <lb/>years <lb/>0.0 <lb/>10.0 <lb/>20.0 <lb/>30.0 <lb/>40.0 <lb/>50.0 <lb/>60.0 <lb/>70.0 <lb/>80.0 <lb/>90.0 <lb/>100.0 <lb/>Malta <lb/>Slovenia <lb/>Greece <lb/>Italy <lb/>Romania <lb/>Luxembourg <lb/>Hungary <lb/>Poland <lb/>Belgium <lb/>Austria <lb/>France <lb/>Bulgaria <lb/>Slovakia <lb/>Ireland <lb/>Spain <lb/>Portugal <lb/>Czech Republic <lb/>United Kingdom <lb/>Netherlands <lb/>Finland <lb/>Lithuania <lb/>Latvia <lb/>Denmark <lb/>Germany <lb/>Estonia <lb/>Norway <lb/>Switzerland <lb/>Sweden <lb/>Iceland <lb/>activity rates, older workers (50 to 64 years) <lb/>0 <lb/>10 <lb/>20 <lb/>30 <lb/>40 <lb/>50 <lb/>60 <lb/>70 <lb/>80 <lb/>90 <lb/>Lithuania <lb/>Slovakia <lb/>Poland <lb/>Czech… <lb/>Croatia <lb/>Hungary <lb/>Bulgaria <lb/>Former… <lb/>Slovenia <lb/>Estonia <lb/>Belgium <lb/>Latvia <lb/>Ireland <lb/>Romania <lb/>Turkey <lb/>Finland <lb/>Italy <lb/>Luxembourg <lb/>Germany <lb/>Malta <lb/>France <lb/>Greece <lb/>Austria <lb/>Sweden <lb/>Norway <lb/>United… <lb/>Denmark <lb/>Netherlands <lb/>Spain <lb/>Portugal <lb/>Switzerland <lb/>Iceland <lb/>activity rate, pre-primary, primary and lower secondary education <lb/>0.0 <lb/>10.0 <lb/>20.0 <lb/>30.0 <lb/>40.0 <lb/>50.0 <lb/>60.0 <lb/>70.0 <lb/>80.0 <lb/>90.0 <lb/>Malta <lb/>Italy <lb/>Romania <lb/>Greece <lb/>Hungary <lb/>Poland <lb/>Luxembourg <lb/>Ireland <lb/>Slovakia <lb/>Belgium <lb/>Czech Republic <lb/>Bulgaria <lb/>Spain <lb/>Slovenia <lb/>France <lb/>Portugal <lb/>Lithuania <lb/>United Kingdom <lb/>Latvia <lb/>Austria <lb/>Estonia <lb/>Germany <lb/>Finland <lb/>Netherlands <lb/>Norway <lb/>Denmark <lb/>Switzerland <lb/>Sweden <lb/>Iceland <lb/>activity rate, female workers <lb/>ECO/WKP(2013)46 <lb/></body>

			<body>2011 to close to 35% in 2030 and should exceed 60% in 2060. At unchanged policies, these developments <lb/>should lead to one of the largest declines in labour force participation in the OECD over the next 50 years, <lb/>by more than 10 percentage points among the population older than 15 years. They would only be slightly <lb/>contained by gradual structural reforms in the baseline scenario, notably built under the assumption of <lb/>further trend expansion in educational attainment, an indexation of the legal pensionable age to life <lb/>expectancy and a convergence of comparatively stringent product market regulations to the average <lb/>regulatory stance observed in the OECD. As a result, population ageing will be a major drag on trend <lb/>growth, which should be mainly driven by efficiency improvements and, to a much smaller extent, <lb/>improvements in human capital. More precisely, Poland&apos;s growth in GDP per capita is projected to fall in <lb/>the baseline scenario from 4.4% between 1995 and 2011 to 2.6% over the next 20 years and to only 1.4% <lb/>between 2030 and 2060. The catching-up should be slow: the gap in GDP per capita vis-à-vis the <lb/>United States would shrink by about 20 percentage points over the next 50 years but still be as high as 70% <lb/>in 2060. <lb/>Figure 4. Average annual GDP per capita growth in OECD countries, 2030-60 <lb/>Note: as for Figure 1. <lb/>Source: Johansson et al. (2012). <lb/>Policy measures are needed to sustain Poland&apos;s high economic growth <lb/>Bold policies are needed to counteract the adverse effects of population ageing as we saw that per <lb/>capita income growth will be sharply slowing down in Poland over the coming decades under the scenario <lb/>of gradual policy changes. To head off such daunting developments, policymakers have to act more <lb/>forcefully to boost labour productivity and labour resource utilisation. <lb/>Increasing labour resource utilisation <lb/>Poland&apos;s population ageing is projected to be one of the most pronounced in the OECD, and an <lb/>increasing dependency ratio will reduce labour utilisation. Let us start by looking at ways how policies <lb/>could counteract such developments in Poland. <lb/>The first avenue for policy action is to keep people longer at work by increasing the effective <lb/>retirement age. Poland implemented, in a very well thought out manner, a comprehensive pension system <lb/>reform in 1999: the first pillar based on notional accounts, and the accompanying fully-funded second <lb/>pillar, both ensuring actuarial neutrality. Such a system offers people the choice to work longer and receive <lb/>0.0 <lb/>0.5 <lb/>1.0 <lb/>1.5 <lb/>2.0 <lb/>2.5 <lb/>3.0 <lb/>3.5 <lb/>4.0 <lb/>Luxembourg <lb/>Ireland <lb/>France <lb/>Spain <lb/>Greece <lb/>Austria <lb/>Korea <lb/>Norway <lb/>Poland <lb/>Germany <lb/>Finland <lb/>Italy <lb/>Sweden <lb/>United States <lb/>Israel <lb/>Portugal <lb/>Australia <lb/>Belgium <lb/>Netherlands <lb/>Slovakia <lb/>Russia <lb/>Saudi Arabia <lb/>Canada <lb/>Switzerland <lb/>United Kingdom <lb/>Slovenia <lb/>Turkey <lb/>Czech Rep <lb/>Iceland <lb/>Japan <lb/>Argentina <lb/>Chile <lb/>Denmark <lb/>Hungary <lb/>Brazil <lb/>New Zealand <lb/>Estonia <lb/>South Africa <lb/>Mexico <lb/>China <lb/>Indonesia <lb/>India <lb/>ECO/WKP(2013)46 <lb/></body>

			<body>higher pension benefits or to retire earlier but at the expense of a lower pension. Because the calculation of <lb/>pension benefits is related, in an automatic fashion, to life expectancy, longer lives would mean that people <lb/>would need to work longer to get decent old-age pensions. Nevertheless, the legal retirement age serves as <lb/>an important social benchmark and influences people&apos;s retirement decisions. Also, people may be short <lb/>sighted and realise that they should have worked longer only when they receive the pension benefits. <lb/>Hence, it is important for the government to increase the legal retirement age in line with or even beyond <lb/>gains in life expectancy and to improve the population&apos;s financial education so that people understand they <lb/>should work longer (OECD, 2012). The 2012 pension reform raised the legal retirement age to 67 both for <lb/>men (from 65) and women (from 62) – even though some potentially generous early retirement <lb/>possibilities were opened up to mitigate this increase (OECD, 2013). This reform was welcome but <lb/>additional policy steps are needed to reduce the negative impact of declining labour utilisation on growth. <lb/>But people will be able to work longer only if they age in a healthy manner. In order to improve the <lb/>relatively poor health status of the Polish population (which can be partly explained by the country&apos;s level <lb/>of economic development), OECD (2012) recommended among other things that the authorities: <lb/>i) improve access to health care, ii) enhance hospital management, iii) carefully design new private health <lb/>insurance and iv) develop a long-term-care strategy. <lb/>Policymakers could further increase participation rates by effectively closing channels of early <lb/>retirement. In particular, the government should continue to further align, following the 2012 pension <lb/>reform, the generous early retirement schemes of members of the uniformed services and eliminate those <lb/>for judges and miners (OECD, 2013). An important driver of the low female activity rate at older ages are <lb/>generous survivors&apos; pension benefits. Women do not need to have a full career to benefit from an old-age <lb/>pension, especially if their partners pass away earlier (which is likely given men&apos;s lower life expectancy). <lb/>According to the OECD&apos;s social expenditure database, spending on survivors&apos; benefits accounted for 2% <lb/>of GDP in 2007, well above the OECD average of 1%. The costs of survivors&apos; benefits should be <lb/>internalised either via higher contribution rates imposed on the primary earner or through a lower pension <lb/>benefit if the pension is to be passed on to the survivor partner. Internalising these costs would incentivise <lb/>women to work longer. Female labour market participation is also limited by the fact that in 2008 the <lb/>length of the post-maternity parental leave in Poland was almost three years and the highest in the entire <lb/>OECD. This keeps mothers too long away from the labour market, especially in the case of consecutive <lb/>childbearing, and thus permanently lowers female participation. <lb/>The dependency ratio will rise not only because people will live longer but also because Poland&apos;s <lb/>fertility rate is about 1.4, well below the level needed to stabilise the population. Low fertility rates will <lb/>determine the size of the working-age population for the coming decades. Yet, looking further ahead, <lb/>policymakers should start to consider how to encourage childbearing. Empirical studies find that family <lb/>policies that diminish the cost of raising children via a combination of financial and non-financial <lb/>incentives, have a significant effect on fertility rates in the OECD (D&apos;Addio and Mira D&apos;Ercole, 2005; <lb/>Luci and Thévenon, 2012). In Poland, financial incentives are not particularly generous. Also, the <lb/>insufficient number of places in pre-school childcare makes it difficult to reconcile family life with work <lb/>and discourages childbearing. But the insufficient provision of pre-school childcare also contributes to the <lb/>low female participation rate as the opportunity cost of staying at home is low especially for low-income <lb/>women. Therefore, the government would be well advised to come up with a coherent family policy <lb/>framework and in particular to develop pre-school childcare infrastructure (OECD, 2013). <lb/>Persistently high unemployment rates are also an important factor of subdued labour utilisation. The <lb/>unemployment rate is high for young people and the unskilled. Active labour market policies, including <lb/>activation and retraining, are essential to get back people into jobs. Poland clearly has a deficit in this area. <lb/>The taxation of labour income can also act as a drag on the demand for and the supply of labour. The cuts <lb/>in personal income taxes and social security contributions decided in 2008 lowered the tax wedge relative <lb/>to the OECD average but were partly offset by a rise in the disability pension contributions and the <lb/></body>

			<body>nominal freeze of the personal income tax schedule. In fact, the OECD has for a long time advocated <lb/>changing the tax mix by shifting taxes from labour (and capital) to those that penalise growth less: green <lb/>taxes and property taxes. <lb/>Boosting labour productivity <lb/>The government should consider reforming the tax system also because shifting the tax burden to less <lb/>harmful taxes would spur productivity gains via capital deepening (more investment). Eliminating many <lb/>tax expenditures and ensuring more neutrality across different asset classes would also contribute to a <lb/>better allocation of productive resources and reduce administrative and tax-compliance costs. The <lb/>preferential tax treatment and the generous health insurance system for farmers (KRUS) lead to resource <lb/>misallocation and inefficiencies in the agricultural sector. Insufficient supply of private housing rentals in <lb/>urban areas impedes workers&apos; geographical mobility and thus efficient resource reallocation. <lb/>Another important aspect policymakers need to look into in Poland is product market regulation. <lb/>Despite successive privatisation programmes launched in 2008, the State still plays an important role in the <lb/>economy. There is indeed no economic reason why the government should be involved in potentially <lb/>competitive segments of network industries, the financial sector, airport operators, and the mining and <lb/>chemical industries. Less government involvement would improve allocative efficiency and thus boost <lb/>productivity. But indirect government interference via complicated regulations also puts an unnecessary <lb/>burden on doing business. According to government estimates, the costs of regulation for businesses <lb/>amounts to 5% of GDP per year. Against this background, the authorities launched a programme to cut red <lb/>tape and to simplify legislation governing the economy. Yet, according to the World Bank&apos;s Doing <lb/>Business 2012 report, it takes a month to set up a business and almost a year to obtain construction permits, <lb/>and it is very complicated to pay taxes (OECD, 2012). The government is aware of these difficulties but it <lb/>should push ahead more firmly in these areas. It is welcome that it intends to liberalise a large number of <lb/>professional services. <lb/>Competition in mining, electricity, gas and telecommunications is unsatisfactory. Beyond government <lb/>disengagement from these sectors, an improved overall regulatory framework would enforce more <lb/>competition (including in broadband internet), which in turn could help spur productivity. Financial <lb/>deepening, essential for better access to credit, could be promoted via a consolidation of the fragmented <lb/>landscape of co-operative banks and an improved legal framework for the use of collateral (OECD, 2012). <lb/>Network infrastructures are still not very well developed. Despite considerable efforts to expand the <lb/>motorway and highway networks, to a large extent financed by EU funds, there is scope to improve the <lb/>road network. Similarly, the railway network needs to be upgraded further. The World Bank&apos;s Doing <lb/>Business 2012 argues that it is not easy for firms to get connected to the electricity network. This is partly <lb/>so because of the poor state of the distribution network, which critically needs investment. Because of the <lb/>relative underdevelopment of these networks, additional investment would most likely improve <lb/>productivity. <lb/>Upgrading human capital is crucial for long-term productivity growth. Skill mismatches remain <lb/>significant in the Polish economy, despite rising educational attainment. Against this background, the <lb/>government recently announced that more emphasis will be put on hard sciences in tertiary education. The <lb/>primary and secondary educational system has gained strength over time, reflected in improved PISA <lb/>scores. The 2011 tertiary education reform aims to develop vocational education. Further improvement <lb/>could be achieved by enhancing the adult training system and encouraging lifelong learning, increasing a <lb/>feedback loop between the education system and the economy&apos;s needs. Raising the quality of the tertiary <lb/>education system through reinforced quality assessment of higher education institutions and giving more <lb/>ECO/WKP(2013)46 <lb/></body>

			<listBibl>weight to competition and transparency in the promotion of staff are needed as well (OECD, 2012; <lb/>OECD, 2013). <lb/>Policies aimed at boosting productivity should encourage innovation to push out the technology <lb/>frontier and/or, more importantly in Poland&apos;s nearer future, to close the gap to the global technology <lb/>frontier. How smoothly technology adoption goes depends on the interplay between education, <lb/>infrastructure and product and labour market regulation. Poland could rely more heavily on tax credits to <lb/>encourage innovative activities. Research funds should be spent in a way to create critical mass and <lb/>maximise spillover effects in academia and the economy. Giving more autonomy to universities in terms of <lb/>budgeting and human resources would underpin the emergence of research centres. The government <lb/>should also better integrate academia with businesses and create the necessary frameworks for an increased <lb/>mobility of researchers between the private and public sectors (OECD, 2010). <lb/>Bibliography <lb/>D&apos;Addio, C.A. and M.
