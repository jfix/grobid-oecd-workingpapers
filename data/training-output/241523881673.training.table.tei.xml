            <table>New<lb/> Zealand. New Zealand has the highest ratios of foreign-born and foreign-trained doctors in<lb/> OECD countries (respectively 52% and 36% in 2005-06) and among the highest for nurses (29%<lb/> and 24%, respectively). New Zealand also has the third highest and the second highest<lb/> expatriation rates for doctors and nurses (28.5% and 23%, respectively).<lb/> • The number of New Zealand-born doctors living in other OECD countries represents half the<lb/> number of foreign-born doctors in New Zealand. The number of New Zealand-born nurses living<lb/> in other OECD countries is matched by the number of foreign-born nurses in New Zealand<lb/> (about 7 500). • There is no specific immigration policy for health professionals, although the permanent and<lb/> temporary routes make it relatively easy for doctors and nurses who can get their qualification<lb/> recognised to immigrate in New Zealand.<lb/> • The increasing use of temporary migration gives rise to a large number of short-term stays of<lb/> health workers in New Zealand, in particular for doctors. While this is certainly a good policy to<lb/> address workforce shortages in rural areas, short-term migration raises issues in terms of<lb/> turnover. More generally, in the New Zealand context, retention of health professionals is a key<lb/> issue because attrition rates (for doctors) and turnover rates (for nurses) tend to be quite high.</table>
