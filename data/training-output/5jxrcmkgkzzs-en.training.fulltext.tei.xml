			<p>• People disadvantaged in the labour market or underrepresented in the entrepreneurial population are disproportionally<lb/> impacted by difficulties in access to finance for business start-ups. Low-educated and young people, in particular, are<lb/> more likely to mention financing problems as a major constraint to starting a business. Women and young entrepreneurs<lb/> rely more on the support of family, friends and public authorities. The low educated, on the other hand, are less likely<lb/> to receive public financing.<lb/> • Traditional financing mechanisms such as grants and subsidised loans have supported in the past the self-employment<lb/> of disadvantaged groups. However, given the current constraints to government budgets, they are expensive policy solu-<lb/>tions. New emerging financing instruments can complement the role of traditional policies, including loan guarantees,<lb/> microcredit, crowdfunding, peer-to-peer lending and business angel investment. It is important that policy makers introduce<lb/> appropriate policy actions to extend the reach of these mechanisms.<lb/></p>

			<p>• Loan guarantees have mainly been used so far by traditional small firms, but they can also play a role in supporting<lb/> inclusive entrepreneurship. Targeted microcredit programmes are warranted to make microcredit more socially inclusive,<lb/> as there are signs that microcredit in the EU might not be serving adequately the needs of traditional clients such as<lb/> women and migrants. Awareness should be raised and appropriate regulations introduced to support Internet-based<lb/> mechanisms such as crowdfunding and peer-to-peer lending. Business angel investment, while traditionally associated<lb/> with high-impact entrepreneurship, can also positively affect the development of inclusive entrepreneurship, provided<lb/> that appropriate adjustments are adopted.<lb/></p>

			<p>• Barriers to access to finance are not only of market nature. Supply-side interventions should be integrated by others<lb/> aimed at upgrading the skills of disadvantaged entrepreneurs, including financial education. Financial education must be<lb/> practice-oriented and is most likely to have an impact if its provision is integrated with the supply of finance.<lb/></p>

			<head>INTRODUCTION<lb/></head>

			<p>More than one-third of the European Union&apos;s adult population<lb/> would rather be self-employed than an employee if given the<lb/> chance to choose, according to the 2012 Flash Eurobarometer<lb/> survey. At the same time, there is a large entrepreneurial poten-<lb/>tial in social groups that are either disadvantaged in the labour<lb/> market (e.g. youth, migrants, and the low-skilled) or under-<lb/>represented in the entrepreneurial population (e.g. women and<lb/> seniors). Inclusive entrepreneurship policies aim to give the<lb/> opportunity for people from these groups to start-up in busi-<lb/>ness and self-employment both for economic reasons and to<lb/> support the goal of social inclusion.<lb/> One of the critical areas for policy action involves improving access<lb/> to finance. Lack of finance is a common barrier for most new<lb/> enterprises, which is magnified among the most disadvantaged<lb/> and under-represented groups (with the exception of senior entre-<lb/>preneurs), reflecting in large part the relative lack of collateral<lb/> assets and own financial resources in these groups. Some of these<lb/> groups may additionally face social discrimination in credit mar-<lb/>kets. Policies and programmes that favour access to finance for<lb/> disadvantaged or underrepresented entrepreneurs have, therefore,<lb/> both a social and economic dimension. They help beneficiaries<lb/> to integrate in the labour market through an income-generating<lb/> activity either in the form of a start-up or through increased<lb/> employability. The ultimate goal of interventions should be that<lb/> everyone, irrespective of sex, age or ethnic background, has access<lb/> to business financing tools available in the market.<lb/></p>

			<p>Inclusive financing programmes should be flexible to accom-<lb/>modate for the different, sometimes unconventional, types of<lb/> business that disadvantaged entrepreneurs run. Women may<lb/> start a business and strive to reconcile work and family, thus<lb/> spending less time at work than the average entrepreneur. They<lb/> may also need to run a business from home, something which<lb/> also applies to entrepreneurs with physical disabilities. Migrants<lb/> often combine different activities together to guarantee their<lb/> livelihood, with the physical and legal boundaries between<lb/> different activities not always clear. Financing schemes for<lb/> inclusive entrepreneurship should adapt to these peculiarities<lb/> because they reflect some of the barriers that prevent female,<lb/> disabled and migrant entrepreneurs from access to traditional<lb/> sources of enterprise finance.<lb/></p>

			<p>New sets of finance products have emerged in the market<lb/> that can serve the needs of disadvantaged entrepreneurs.<lb/> This policy brief focuses on these new tools, which offer a<lb/> more sustainable approach than traditional grants to finance<lb/> inclusive entrepreneurship. Some of these instruments (e.g.<lb/> crowdfunding and peer-to-peer lending) use the power of the<lb/> Internet to shorten the distance between lenders and borrow-<lb/>ers and wipe out possible discrimination effects. Others (e.g.<lb/> loan guarantees, microcredit, alternative debt finance, and<lb/> business angels) address market failures that are more likely<lb/> to affect entrepreneurs from disadvantaged groups. Still oth-<lb/>ers by-pass the market to rely on forms of self-support (e.g.<lb/> self-financing groups) or try to dovetail market rules with moral<lb/> principles (e.g. Islamic finance). Supply-side interventions need<lb/> to be combined with financial education to improve the financial<lb/> literacy skills of disadvantaged entrepreneurs. In the case of<lb/> our target groups, barriers to access to finance are in fact not<lb/> only of market nature, but also involve limited understanding of<lb/> the credit market (e.g. loan application process, interest rates,<lb/> time value of money, etc.).<lb/></p>

			<p>The policy brief proceeds as follow. First, data on access to<lb/> finance by women, young and low-educated entrepreneurs<lb/> are presented to give an overview of the challenge facing<lb/> policy makers who want to promote access to finance for<lb/> disadvantaged entrepreneurs. Second, the main types of<lb/> barriers in access to finance for these target groups are<lb/> discussed. Third, policies to finance inclusive entrepreneur-<lb/>ship are discussed at length. The focus is mainly on emerging<lb/> mechanisms, with an emphasis also on operational aspects<lb/> that can help policy makers to introduce these schemes.<lb/> Conclusions restate the main findings and policy recom-<lb/>mendations of the brief.<lb/></p>

			<head>THE SCALE AND NATURE OF THE FINANCING CHALLENGE<lb/></head>

			<p>External finance as a start-</p>

			<head>up barrier<lb/></head>

			<p>Survey evidence from across the European Union indicates<lb/> that obtaining external finance is a major barrier to business<lb/> start-up across all socio-demographic groups (<ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>). (1)<lb/> More than one-half of new entrepreneurs across all groups<lb/> consider obtaining finance to be an important problem, the<lb/> only exceptions being entrepreneurs aged above 40 and those<lb/> with post-secondary education. The low-educated and young<lb/> entrepreneurs have the greatest problems in this respect. More<lb/> men than women entrepreneurs report obtaining financing as<lb/></p>

			<p>(</p>

			<table>1 )<lb/> One of the best sources of data on access to finance by socio-<lb/>demographic groups is the EUROSTAT Factors of Business Success<lb/> (FOBS) survey, which was unfortunately conducted only in 2005 on<lb/> business founders from 15 EU countries participating on a voluntary<lb/> basis. The survey covered enterprises born in 2002, that had survived<lb/> to 2005, and that were still managed by the founder at the time of the<lb/> survey. It covered Austria, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia,<lb/> France, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia,<lb/> Slovenia and Sweden. Dating back to 2005, the survey does not take<lb/> into account the consequences of the global economic crisis (2008)<lb/> and of the largest EU enlargement to Eastern Europe (2004).<lb/></table>

			<p>having been a major problem in the start-up phase, although<lb/> the difference is minimal. This possibly reflects the nature of<lb/> the enterprises women tend to start. Women entrepreneurs<lb/> are disproportionally present in the services sector, which has<lb/> lower entry costs, and are more likely to start a business driven<lb/> by the need to combine family and work (OECD, 2012). Thus,<lb/> women entrepreneurs have lower financial needs on average<lb/> than male entrepreneurs. On the other hand, there is evidence<lb/> of undercapitalisation of many women-owned businesses, and<lb/> greater reliance on bootstrapping and short-term loans, which<lb/> tend to increase vulnerability to bankruptcy (OECD, 2012).</p>

The 3Fs of founder,<lb/> family and friends are the main source of start-up finance for all<lb/> groups. However, thanks to greater savings or possibly greater risk<lb/> propensity, male, older and higher-educated entrepreneurs are more<lb/> likely than others to draw on their own personal resources to set up a<lb/> business activity. This is confirmed by a country-based examination<lb/> of &quot; nascent entrepreneurs &quot; (<ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>), (3) which shows how in most EU<lb/> countries senior nascent entrepreneurs are more likely than junior<lb/> nascent entrepreneurs to expect financing their business without<lb/> any external contribution. The median value for nascent entrepre-<lb/>neurs that foresee to fully self-finance their business is 53% for<lb/> senior entrepreneurs (Italy), but only 38% for young entrepreneurs<lb/> (Slovenia). With respect to women and low-educated entrepreneurs,<lb/> the median value stands respectively at 51% (Finland) and 45%<lb/> (Greece). Given the overwhelming role that personal resources play<lb/> in the financing of start-ups, this enables men and older people<lb/> to get more easily involved in entrepreneurship and develop stur-<lb/>dier businesses. At the same time, this signals a problem for other<lb/> groups, which tend to be forced to make greater use of &quot; financial<lb/> assistance from family and friends &quot; . Women and young people and,<lb/> to a lesser extent, low-educated entrepreneurs, are more likely than<lb/> others to resort to this source of start-up finance (<ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>).<lb/> Apart from use of own funds and funds from family and friends,<lb/> the main sources of funding are bank loans, public authorities,<lb/> capital contributions from other enterprises and venture capital<lb/></p>

				<formula>( 3 )<lb/></formula>

			<p>Based on the definition of the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor report,<lb/> nascent entrepreneurs are people actively involved in setting up a<lb/> business they will own or co-own.<lb/></p>

			<p>(<ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>). Access to these sources can be vital to the ability of<lb/> entrepreneurs to make the necessary start-up investments and<lb/> to cover operating costs until revenues flow in. However, there<lb/> are important differences across socio-demographic groups in<lb/> their abilities to access external funding sources.<lb/> For example, male entrepreneurs are more likely than female entre-<lb/>preneurs to use bank loans to fuel the start-up process. Interestingly,<lb/> the gender gap is bigger for uncollateralised loans than for collater-<lb/>alised loans. On the other hand, the level of education is not a strong<lb/> determinant of access to loans. Business founders with primary and<lb/> lower secondary education are those more likely to have used both<lb/> uncollateralised and collateralised loans to launch an enterprise.<lb/></p>

			<p>Other financial sources are less important on average. However,<lb/> public financial support has made a contribution to business start-up<lb/> by a significant group of entrepreneurs. Women and youth are the<lb/> categories of entrepreneurs most likely to be targeted by public<lb/> financial support. Results on levels of education are again not as<lb/> straightforward as for sex and age, with entrepreneurs with upper<lb/> secondary and tertiary education more likely to receive financial aid.<lb/> One explanation could lie in the better ability of higher-educated<lb/> entrepreneurs to disentangle themselves in the twists and turns of<lb/> the bureaucracy involving access to public financial support.<lb/> &quot; Access to venture capital &quot; gives very similar results. Male, senior<lb/> and higher-educated entrepreneurs report considerably more often<lb/> than the others the use of venture capital to set out a business,<lb/> although the percentages remain small across all social groups.<lb/></p>

The graph shows that a substantial minority of people<lb/> start up their business using entirely their own funding in all coun-<lb/>tries, but that self-funding tends to be higher in certain countries<lb/> like the Netherlands and Denmark than others such as Austria,<lb/> Latvia and Romania. However, the interpretation is complicated by<lb/> the fact that two separate issues are likely to be in play. On the one<lb/> hand, people with substantial own resources may decide to finance<lb/> themselves rather than seek external finance. On the other hand,<lb/> people who are refused external finance, or are discouraged from<lb/> seeking it, will be forced to use their own resources even though<lb/> this may constrain the development of their business. In terms<lb/> of specific target groups, seniors used self-financing more than<lb/> youth in fourteen of the nineteen countries. This is likely to reflect<lb/> the greater resources available to seniors. In northern European<lb/> economies such as Denmark, Netherlands, Germany, and Sweden,<lb/> a very large proportion of women fully self-finance their business<lb/> start-up, which may be the result either of sufficient personal sav-<lb/>ings or of lower capital needs required by the business they set out<lb/> (e.g. part time business or in low-cost services), whereas in eastern<lb/> and southern European countries the proportion of self-sufficient<lb/> women entrepreneurs is lower, pointing to limited personal savings<lb/> possibly due to lower participation in the labour market.<lb/></p>

			<p>The use of start-up loans across countries<lb/> The <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref> shows that there are some significant differences<lb/> in the use of start-up loans by entrepreneurs from disadvan-<lb/>taged and under-represented groups. The highest proportions<lb/> of loan beneficiaries are in Denmark and Austria, where the<lb/> percentages of women, youth and low-educated people receiv-<lb/>ing bank loans to set out an enterprise were much higher than<lb/> those in, for example, the Czech Republic, Romania and Slovakia.<lb/></p>

			<p>Wide national differences point to the importance of targeted<lb/> approaches to financing inclusive entrepreneurship. Since Eastern<lb/> Europe does worse than Western Europe, there is scope for using<lb/> the European Social Fund to make strides in strengthening inclu-<lb/>sive entrepreneurship. It may well be possible that within-country<lb/> differences are deeper than cross-country ones, which would sug-<lb/>gest the need for a place-based approach where regional authori-<lb/>ties design bespoke programmes to enhance access to finance by<lb/> social target groups and where national programmes are flexible<lb/> enough to be tailored to different local economic contexts.<lb/> EU western countries should also take action. National compar-<lb/>ative data on resort to start-up loans would show that women,<lb/> young, and low-educated entrepreneurs perform worse than<lb/> male, senior and high-educated entrepreneurs also in the west<lb/> of the EU (Austria, Denmark, Italy, Luxembourg, Portugal and<lb/> Sweden). In fact, across the whole range of FOBS-surveyed<lb/> countries, the biggest gender gap (47.3% for men vs. 38.9% for<lb/> women) and the biggest age gap (28.8% for senior vs. 20.3%<lb/> for young) were respectively found in Denmark and Italy.<lb/></p>

			<head>Market exit due to problems<lb/> in obtaining finance<lb/></head>

			<p>Problems in obtaining external finance are one of the possible<lb/> reasons for entrepreneurs to exit the market. Its importance<lb/> has increased following the 2008 global economic crisis and<lb/> the 2011 sovereign debt crisis that have resulted in a credit<lb/> crunch forcing many entrepreneurs to shut down their business<lb/> (see Box 2). <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref>, based on Global Entrepreneurship Monitor<lb/> (GEM) data, confirms, but to a lower extent, the divide between<lb/> Eastern and Western Europe with respect to access to finance<lb/> for disadvantaged entrepreneurs. Since GEM data are more<lb/> recent than FOBS data, this might signal that the east-west<lb/> gap is being bridged.<lb/></p>

			<p>With respect to gender, Hungary is the country where the<lb/> highest share of women ex-entrepreneurs reports problems<lb/> in obtaining finance as having been the most important reason<lb/> for exit (40.2%), although the proportion for men is also high<lb/> (37.4%).</p>

			<table>(4) Best performers are Sweden and the UK, where<lb/> only 1.9% and 3.6% of female respondents mentioned lack<lb/> of external finance as the main reason to close their business.<lb/> Positive situations are also found in Eastern Europe. The Czech<lb/> Republic and Slovakia, for example, do better than France,<lb/> Spain or Belgium.<lb/></table>

			<p>Within-country gaps are also important. In the case of gender,<lb/> women are less likely to search for external finance and are<lb/> conditions in Eastern Europe. The gap between the proportion<lb/> of low-educated and high-educated (post-secondary degree)<lb/> ex-entrepreneurs who report lack of external finance as the<lb/> principal motivation to have closed their business is 27.9 per-<lb/>centage points in Latvia and 13.6 percentage points in Poland.<lb/> In some countries such as Spain and France, however, the trend<lb/> is reversed, thus confirming that the entrepreneur&apos;s level of edu-<lb/>cation is not always a strong determinant of access to finance.<lb/> To wrap up, there is much heterogeneity across countries and<lb/> socio-demographic groups. Some countries in Eastern Europe<lb/> do better than others in the region or even in Western Europe.<lb/> However, low-educated entrepreneurs are still faced with generally<lb/> adverse conditions in most of Eastern Europe. This signals a policy<lb/> priority area for the entire region. In Western Europe the group that<lb/> needs most attention is the youth. The situation is very negative in<lb/> the Netherlands, possibly because of the effects of the crisis, but<lb/> large countries such as France, Italy and Spain also see the youth<lb/> at a disadvantage when looking for finance to save their business.<lb/> On the other hand, in these countries low-educated entrepreneurs<lb/> are not more likely than high-educated entrepreneurs to report lack<lb/> of finance as the main reason to close their business.<lb/></p>

The crisis has had a severe impact on small business financing. Loan rejections at<lb/> EU-27 aggregate level rose from 12% to 18% between the first and second half of 2009 and then fell back to 11% in 2010 and<lb/> 2011. Loan terms for small firms also worsened comparatively to large firms, and the interest rate spread between SMEs and<lb/> large enterprises widened (OECD, 2012).<lb/> The crisis has had a disproportionate impact on SMEs in southern Europe and Ireland. Between 2007 and 2010 there was a<lb/> drop in fully successful loan applications by SMEs from 97% to 53% in Ireland, from 87% to 59% in Spain and from 88%<lb/> to 60% in Greece (Eurostat, 2011). The outbreak of the sovereign debt crisis in summer 2011 is likely to have made access<lb/> to SME loans even more difficult, and SMEs in Greece, Portugal and Italy reported strong increases in their need for bank<lb/> loans over the period from October 2012 to March 2013 (ECB, 2013).<lb/></table>

			<p>In addition to suffering a credit crunch, SMEs in southern Europe and Ireland have also experienced a deterioration of credit<lb/> conditions. Between 2010 and 2011, both the average SME interest rate and the interest rate spread between loans for<lb/> SMEs and loans for large firms increased in Ireland, Spain and Italy. In Portugal, the interest rate spread marginally decreased<lb/> only because the average interest rate for large companies augmented comparatively more than the average SME interest<lb/> rate, which nonetheless rose by over 1% (OECD, forthcoming).<lb/> The crisis also seems to be having an impact on the inflow of new entrepreneurs. The Flash Eurobarometer surveys show<lb/> that lack of available financial support was considered a difficulty to business start-up by 79% of EU-27 respondents in<lb/> 2012, 4 percentage points higher than in 2007 (75%), although this had dropped by 2 percentage points from the peak in<lb/> 2009 (81%). The biggest toll on entrepreneurship activity appears to be in those countries hit hardest by the crisis (Greece,<lb/> Ireland, Italy, Spain and Portugal), while others (Germany and Finland) have advanced well along the road to recovery.<lb/></p>

			<p>Banking reforms are to be introduced across Europe in the form of minimum capital requirements and liquidity management<lb/> – commonly known as Basel III – which could have an impact on access to debt finance for new start-up enterprises. While<lb/> the entire reform will become fully operational only in 2019 and it cannot be predicted how banks will react to increased<lb/> capital requirements, there are two issues which will need to be monitored.<lb/> First, the banks&apos; ratio of core Tier-1 capital (common equity and retained earnings) to risk-weighted assets will increase from<lb/> 2% to 7%, with a counter-cyclical buffer of 0%-2.5% that can be added at a national level if the country&apos;s macroeconomic<lb/> conditions require it. Second, for most banks the risk of assets will be assessed by standard external credit ratings that<lb/> typically provide a risk weight of 75%-100% for business loans versus a credit risk of 20% for AAA to AA-rated products<lb/> and 50% for A+ to A-rated products such as sovereign debt and inter-bank claims (OECD, 2012). These reforms, which are<lb/> aimed at strengthening the resilience of the financial system, could reduce the willingness of banks to advance loans for new<lb/> business start-ups and may call for a public policy response such as through increasing credit guarantees and microcredit.<lb/></p>

			<head>BARRIERS TO OBTAINING FINANCE FOR DISADVANTAGED<lb/> AND UNDER-REPRESENTED GROUPS IN ENTREPRENEURSHIP<lb/></head>

			<p>The barriers that make access to finance difficult for entre-<lb/>preneurs from social inclusion target groups fall in four main<lb/> areas: market barriers, cultural barriers, skills barriers and<lb/> institutional barriers:<lb/></p>

			<p>Market barriers. Credit markets suffer from information asym-<lb/>metries between lenders and borrowers. Often, banks do not<lb/> have sufficient information to judge the viability of business<lb/> proposals, especially in the case of new firms. Thus, they pro-<lb/>vide credit against the provision of collateral that can be seized<lb/> in the case of loan defaults (i.e. asset-based lending). Since<lb/> members of disadvantaged and under-represented groups in<lb/> entrepreneurship tend to own fewer collateral assets (e.g. real<lb/> estate property, vehicles, etc.), their loan requests are more<lb/> likely to be rejected. There is also evidence that banks supply<lb/> more finance to people with large personal wealth (<ref type="biblio">Avery et<lb/> al., 1998</ref>), which further penalises women, young and ethnic-<lb/>minority entrepreneurs. In principle, banks could apply higher<lb/> interest rates to compensate for the higher risk-profile of disad-<lb/>vantaged entrepreneurs. However, such a strategy would attract<lb/> risk-prone borrowers, leading to adverse selection. Borrowers<lb/> might also be induced into riskier projects to pay back larger<lb/> loan instalments, which would also result in higher chances of<lb/> loan defaults (i.e. moral hazard). The result of these market<lb/> failures is to prevent equal access to finance by entrepreneurs<lb/> from socially excluded populations.<lb/></p>

			<head>Cultural barriers.</head>

			<p>Bank loan officers are trained to deal with<lb/> a type of business in which the entrepreneur works full-time.<lb/> Migrant entrepreneurs who manage different businesses at<lb/> the same time or women entrepreneurs working part-time<lb/> in their enterprise may be credit-rationed because they fall<lb/> out of this prototype of client. Cases of social discrimination<lb/> towards ethnic minority or female entrepreneurs are also pos-<lb/>sible, although there is not strong evidence of this in EU credit<lb/> markets (OECD/EC, 2013). Cultural barriers also occur on the<lb/> demand side of credit markets. Migrant and ethnic minority<lb/> entrepreneurs may face language and social barriers to building<lb/> a close and confident relationship with banks. Some groups,<lb/> for example, may be unwilling to share full information on<lb/> personal revenues and indebtedness with loan officers, who are<lb/> perceived as outsiders. Women and youth may not approach<lb/> banks because they think that on average female and young<lb/> entrepreneurs are less likely to obtain a loan than male and<lb/> senior entrepreneurs, thus turning into &quot; discouraged borrowers &quot;<lb/> (<ref type="biblio">Kon and Storey, 2003</ref>). This is especially true when members<lb/> of these groups have experienced prolonged periods of labour<lb/> market inactivity.<lb/></p>

			<head>Skills barriers.</head>

			<p>Most loan applications are rejected because the<lb/> information submitted is incomplete or wrong. This happens<lb/> more often for entrepreneurs that do not belong to the male<lb/> white mainstream group. Three common skills barriers involve<lb/> business planning, business management and financial literacy.<lb/> Many of the people from disadvantaged and under-represented<lb/> groups in entrepreneurship who first approach external sup-<lb/>pliers of finance have never developed a business plan and<lb/> have never managed an enterprise before, whereas these are<lb/> common requirements of lending institutions to give credit.<lb/> Members of some social target groups (such as low-educated,<lb/> migrant and senior entrepreneurs) may also lack a good grasp<lb/> of business finance concepts that are key to understanding<lb/> the risks and opportunities associated with an entrepreneurial<lb/> venture (e.g. interest rates, time value of money, etc.). Skills<lb/> barriers can be addressed through business advice, mentoring<lb/> schemes and financial education programmes.<lb/></p>

			<head>Institutional barriers.</head>

			<p>There are a number of potential problems<lb/> in the way that finance institutions operate that can affect entre-<lb/>preneurs from disadvantaged and under-represented groups.<lb/> For example, some forms of microcredit do not enable ben-<lb/>eficiaries to build a credit history, which could eventually help<lb/> them to obtain loans from senior lending institutions at lower<lb/> interest rates than those offered in the microfinance sector. Lack<lb/> of legislation about new sources of finance relevant to disad-<lb/>vantaged entrepreneurs is another example of an institutional<lb/> barrier. The diffusion of the Internet has made new sources of<lb/> finance possible (e.g. crowdfunding and peer-to-peer lending),<lb/> but only recently have policy makers started to legislate on these<lb/> new channels of business finance. Furthermore, it is generally<lb/> not enough to enforce a law or introduce a new programme<lb/> to improve the provision of finance, but it is also important to<lb/> inform would-be beneficiaries about the change. Information and<lb/> awareness-raising initiatives are key to overcoming this barrier.<lb/></p>

			<head>TRADITIONAL POLICIES FOR FINANCING BUSINESS<lb/> START-UP BY EXCLUDED GROUPS<lb/></head>

			<p>Given the difficulties people from disadvantaged and under-<lb/>represented groups in entrepreneurship face in obtaining<lb/> finance for business start-ups, governments and develop-<lb/>ment agencies have traditionally provided support to correct<lb/> or compensate for the finance gap. The commonly employed<lb/> tools have been grants and soft loans. These remain highly<lb/> relevant today and can work together with or in place of some<lb/> of the new financing mechanisms that are beginning to emerge.<lb/></p>

			<head>Grants and income subsidies<lb/></head>

			<p>Grants and income subsidies are capital transfers by which<lb/> money ownership is transferred from one party (i.e. the gran-<lb/>tor) to another (i.e. the grantee). It is not uncommon for public<lb/> programmes to transfer grants and subsidies under certain con-<lb/>ditions, for example with respect to the final use of the grant.<lb/> Conditionalities are set to prevent misuse of public resources.<lb/></p>

			<p>Grants and subsidies have traditionally been used by policy<lb/> makers to help deprived groups to integrate or re-integrate<lb/> in the labour market (e.g. job creation schemes and wage<lb/> subsidies). More recently, they have also been employed to<lb/> stimulate entrepreneurial activity. The best known example of<lb/> an income-subsidy policy for nascent entrepreneurs is from<lb/> Germany, which since the mid-1980s has experimented with<lb/> schemes that foster business creation among the unemployed.<lb/></p>

			<head>Box 2 Germany&apos;s New Start-Up Subsidy<lb/></head>

			<figure>Target Group: People eligible for unemployment benefits under Germany&apos;s federal legislation.<lb/> Intervention type: Income-subsidy policy, combined with additional support services such as business planning and coaching.<lb/> It provides an income subsidy (i.e. the unemployment benefit) and a small grant to secure the livelihood of the unemployed<lb/> person starting a business and partly overcome the capital constraints associated with the start-up phase.<lb/></figure>

			<p>Objectives: Help unemployed people to enter the labour market via self-employment. It is especially conceived for those<lb/> groups that are faced with discrimination in the labour market or whose skills and competencies suffer from low demand,<lb/> as well as for regions and industries undergoing structural change.<lb/></p>

			<figure>Entry requirements: Being eligible for unemployment benefits under German federal legislation and approval of a business<lb/> plan by an external source (e.g. Chambers of Commerce).<lb/> Programme length: 9 months.<lb/></figure>

			<p>Description: The new Start-Up Subsidy (New SUS) was created in 2006 to merge the two previous programmes targeting<lb/> self-employment by the unemployed in Germany: the Bridging Allowance and the Start-up Subsidy. It provides the unem-<lb/>ployed with the benefit she or he would otherwise be eligible for over the first 9 months of the start-up phase. A monthly<lb/> lump sum of EUR 300 is also transferred for the same time period to cover social contribution requirements; the latter can<lb/> also be extended for another 6 months.<lb/></p>

			<p>Results achieved: Robust evaluation results are available for the former Bridging Allowance, which was subsequently<lb/> merged into the new Start-Up Subsidy with a very similar design. By comparing the performance of participants with non-<lb/>participants eligible for the programme, the evaluation points to positive income and employment effects especially for<lb/> the low-educated, the youth and women, reaching the conclusion that the approach is more effective for groups that are<lb/> disadvantaged in the labour market or in areas where opportunities for wage employment are scarce. The evaluation study<lb/> also shows that businesses created by the unemployed are not necessarily structurally weak. Even after 5 years from the<lb/> intervention, as many as 70% of male participants in East Germany and 68% of those in West Germany were still in business,<lb/> while the lowest survival rate was for women participants in East Germany (56%). Between 30-40% of business founders<lb/> also created additional jobs beyond their own.<lb/></p>

			<p>Lessons for other initiatives: Unemployment benefits can be used to subsidise self-employment by the unemployed,<lb/> provided that the right set of incentives for the unemployed is in place. For example, social security contributions may have<lb/> to be paid on top of the subsidy, which should be given on a monthly basis rather than as a lump sum. Similar schemes also<lb/> work better for members of social groups that are discriminated in labour markets or in regions where wage employment<lb/> opportunities are scarce.<lb/></p>

			<head>Soft loans<lb/></head>

			<p>While not every entrepreneur applies for a bank loan, there<lb/> are many that do and whose request is rejected. This is<lb/> where government may intervene by targeting loans on<lb/> to people who would otherwise find it difficult to obtain<lb/> them, but who nonetheless have a viable business project<lb/> (or one that can be made viable with complementary policy<lb/> support). At the policy level many EU countries have intro-<lb/>duced subsidised loan schemes. An example is so-called<lb/> &quot; Honour Loans &quot; , which have provided many generations of<lb/> young and female entrepreneurs in Italy and France with<lb/> a combination of grants and interest-free loans. Honour<lb/> loans are called so because they are conceded against the<lb/> borrower&apos;s word of honour, without requiring collaterals or<lb/> other forms of guarantee.<lb/></p>

			<head>NEW AND EMERGING POLICY ACTIONS FOR FINANCING<lb/> BUSINESS START-UPS IN SOCIAL INCLUSION TARGET GROUPS<lb/></head>

			<p>New financing mechanisms have recently emerged that can<lb/> help bridge the gap between lenders and investors, on the one<lb/> hand, and disadvantaged entrepreneurs, on the other. Some<lb/> (e.g. loan guarantees, business angels and Islamic finance),<lb/> have long been in place, but their potential for inclusive entre-<lb/>preneurship has not yet been fully tapped. Others (e.g. micro-<lb/>credit and self-financing groups) are relatively new but with<lb/> a certain tradition in the policy area of financing inclusive<lb/> entrepreneurship. Still others have only recently arisen thanks<lb/> to the diffusion of the Internet (e.g. crowdfunding and peer-<lb/>to-peer lending).<lb/></p>

			<head>Loan guarantees<lb/></head>

			<p>Loan guarantees tackle market barriers such as the lack of<lb/> collateral assets and higher risk profile of new and small enter-<lb/>prises. Loan guarantees have received increasing attention by<lb/> governments because of their advantages relative to traditional<lb/> loans and grants, namely the fact that they leverage private<lb/> sector know-how and resources through the banks participat-<lb/>ing in the programme to favour the access of disadvantaged<lb/> entrepreneurs to traditional sources of debt finance. The main<lb/> driver of banks&apos; participation in this policy is the lower credit<lb/> risk associated with publicly-or privately-guaranteed loans.<lb/></p>

			<p>There are three main different models of loan guarantee pro-<lb/>grammes, often called also credit guarantee schemes (CGSs):<lb/> public, public-private and mutual (OECD, forthcoming).<lb/> • Public schemes: they can be either managed directly by the<lb/> government or implemented in a more decentralised man-<lb/>ner via the banking system. The first approach, which is<lb/> more common of Eastern Europe (Slovenia and Slovakia),<lb/> tends to see a stronger involvement of government agen-<lb/>cies in the decision-making process about the provision of<lb/> the loan guarantee. The second approach, shared by the<lb/> United Kingdom and the Netherlands, is implemented via<lb/> the banking sector with little if any direction on how the<lb/> guarantee scheme is managed and for which loans the public<lb/> guarantee is used.<lb/></p>

			<p>• Public-private schemes: they involve both public and pri-<lb/>vate sector players. The government&apos;s role can be more or<lb/> less active, for example in facilitating the creation of the<lb/> programme. Irrespective of the degree of public sector<lb/> involvement, the management of the programme (e.g. risk<lb/> assessment and monitoring of the loan) is left to the lending<lb/> institutions. An example of more active involvement is given<lb/> by the Hungarian government, which sought the involvement<lb/> of both lending institutions and SME associations when it<lb/> launched its national guarantee Fund.<lb/> • Private schemes: they see the strongest commitment by<lb/> the private sector, generally through bottom-up mutual<lb/> guarantee associations that group entrepreneurs from the<lb/> same local business community (e.g. Italy) or from the same<lb/> industry (e.g. Spain). In this type of CGS, it is the mutual<lb/> guarantee associations that provide a first assessment of<lb/> the member who intends to borrow and that are involved in<lb/> the recovery of losses in case of default. The final lending<lb/> choice, nonetheless, remains with the bank, which carries out<lb/> its own full credit risk assessment. The role of the govern-<lb/>ment is limited to setting the regulatory and legal framework<lb/> and supplying financial assistance, which can take the form<lb/> of direct funding or counter-guarantees. An example of pri-<lb/>vate CGS is Italy, where the government provides a sizeable<lb/> last-resort counter-guarantee to banks on top of first-level<lb/> guarantees offered by local mutual guarantee associations<lb/> (i.e. called confidi in Italy).<lb/> A key characteristic of loan guarantee programmes is that<lb/> the final lending choice is left with banks because they<lb/> still carry a part of the risk of default, generally anything<lb/> between 20% and 50% of the loan amount. The risk profile<lb/> of guarantee-backed loans will not therefore diverge too<lb/> much from the bank&apos;s average client risk profile. As a result,<lb/> disadvantaged entrepreneurs are at risk of being left out of<lb/> mainstream CGSs.<lb/></p>

			<p>If the government is to use CGSs to encourage inclusive entre-<lb/>preneurship, its role should thus go beyond setting the legal<lb/> framework and giving counter-guarantees. Guarantee pro-<lb/>grammes exclusively designed for entrepreneurs from target<lb/> groups (e.g. young, women, ethnic minorities) are an option,<lb/> as is the encouragement through public subsidies (e.g. con-<lb/>tributions to the registered capital, payments for the running<lb/> costs of the association, etc.) of mutual guarantee associations<lb/> among members of target groups working in similar sectors.<lb/> In both cases, governments should rely on the expertise of<lb/> private sector lending institutions for credit risk assessment.<lb/> Lenders, on their part, should continue to carry a small part of<lb/> the default risk (e.g. 10-20%), so that they have an incentive<lb/> to apply due diligence in the assessment of loan applications.<lb/> Maximum default rates should be set beforehand to make CGSs<lb/> financially sustainable for public finances.<lb/></p>

			<head>Box 3 Key criteria in setting up a loan guarantee programme for disadvantaged entrepreneurs<lb/></head>

			<p>Different operational parameters need to be considered by policy makers interested in setting up credit guarantee schemes<lb/> for disadvantaged entrepreneurs.<lb/></p>

			<figure>Firm</figure>

			<p>eligibility: the main eligibility criterion would be affinity to the target group. An age threshold of 3-5 years can also<lb/> be included to ensure that the programme caters for new entrepreneurs. A size limit can equally be applied to increase the<lb/> additionality of the programme, since larger SMEs should be able to obtain credit via traditional credit channels.<lb/> Guarantee assignment process: guarantees can be assigned mainly on a retail or portfolio basis. In the first case, credit risk<lb/> assessment is done on a personal basis, which implies in-depth knowledge of borrowers but also higher administrative costs.<lb/> In the second case, guarantees are provided based on some common characteristics of applicants (e.g. sector, locality, etc.).<lb/></p>

			<head>Coverage ratio: it expresses</head>

			<p>the degree of protection over defaulted loans provided to lending institutions and can range<lb/> anywhere between 20% and 100%. Even in the case of disadvantaged entrepreneurs it is, however, recommended that a<lb/> coverage ratio above 90% is not enforced, since this will reduce the incentive for lending institutions to carry out a proper<lb/> credit risk assessment. The EU State Aid Framework sets an 80% coverage ratio when public funding is involved in the<lb/> guarantee coverage, although this threshold has been increased during the crisis up to 90%. A median coverage ratio of 80%<lb/> was also found in a survey of 76 schemes worldwide (<ref type="biblio">Beck et al., 2010</ref>). A coverage ratio between 80% and 90% could be<lb/> envisaged for our target groups, depending on the hardships they are faced with and evolution of EU State Aid legislation.<lb/> Average guarantee period: it is often below 5 years and hardly ever above 10 years. In the case of new businesses, policy<lb/> makers should acknowledge that the risk associated with start-up loans tend to decrease over time, so long guarantee<lb/> periods should not be the norm (i.e. less than 5 years). In principle, borrowers who have proven to be reliable or who have<lb/> meanwhile acquired collaterals should be phased out and turned to traditional credit channels.<lb/></p>

			<table>Pricing: CGSs typically generate revenues by applying entry fees, annual fees and loan guarantee application fees. Given<lb/> the restrained personal resources of disadvantaged entrepreneurs, policy makers should envisage a strong subsidisation<lb/> element to encourage applications and enrolment into programmes by target groups.<lb/></table>

			<p>Additional services: CGS for entrepreneurs unable to receive credit through commercial channels should finally consider<lb/> matching the supply of credit with additional services, such as financial education (see below), to increase the likelihood<lb/> of repayment.<lb/></p>

			<p>The following summary provides an overview of what a loan guarantee programme for disadvantaged entrepreneurs could<lb/> resemble to:<lb/></p>

			<table>• Entrepreneur eligibility: Based on affinity to target groups and credit worthiness.<lb/> • Assignment process: Retail or portfolio-based.<lb/> • Coverage ratio: High, 80%-90% of the loan amount, but in line with EU legislation.<lb/> • Average guarantee period: Less than 5 years.<lb/> • Pricing: Strong subsidy component should be envisaged.<lb/> • Additional services: Financial education and business development advice to boost chances of repayment.<lb/></table>

			<p>Loan guarantee programmes have several advantages from<lb/> a government point of view. They leverage on the expertise<lb/> of the banking sector for credit risk assessment, which lowers<lb/> the risks of government failures. Their cost is in large part pro-<lb/>portional to the loan default rate, so that if the programme is<lb/> run properly it will be a low-cost policy option (although large<lb/> funds will have to be set aside to cover for possible defaults<lb/> and convince banks to participate). They favour the integration<lb/> of marginal groups into the mainstream credit system and show<lb/> to commercial banks that disadvantaged entrepreneurs can<lb/> be profitable clients. On the downside, CGSs have traditionally<lb/> been conceived for the average small firm, so that their use by<lb/> disadvantaged entrepreneurs requires some tweaks. Moreover,<lb/> if the default risk is not fairly shared among the parties, the<lb/> scheme lends itself to opportunistic behaviours by lenders<lb/> and borrowers. Finally, public schemes where the government<lb/> plays an active role in the monitoring and assessment of loan<lb/> guarantees present higher operating costs and are subject to<lb/> picking-winner problems.<lb/></p>

			<p>The pros and cons of loan guarantee programmes are con-<lb/>firmed by existing empirical evidence. Loan guarantees have<lb/> been found to improve credit conditions for SMEs (e.g. the size,<lb/> maturity and interest rates of the loans), but the evidence for<lb/> an impact on increasing the number of loan beneficiaries and<lb/> business start-ups is less conclusive. In France, the guarantee<lb/> programme operated by OSEO, the government SME financing<lb/> agency, throughout the 1990s resulted in increased loan vol-<lb/>umes and sales growth for the beneficiaries, but did not affect<lb/> the overall start-up rate in the economy (<ref type="biblio">Lelarge et al., 2010</ref>).<lb/> Since then, OSEO has recalibrated the scheme towards the<lb/> needs of start-ups, which came to represent 75% of the ben-<lb/>eficiary firms and 35% of total funding in 2011 (OECD, 2013).<lb/> A series of studies on the Italian loan guarantee system also<lb/> suggest that the impact of loan guarantee policy is stronger<lb/> on credit conditions than on credit expansion (<ref type="biblio">Columba et al,<lb/> 2010; D&apos;Ignazio and Menon, 2013</ref>). In Italy, the schemes have<lb/> lowered interest rates, lengthened loan maturity and increased<lb/> loan volumes, but they have not favoured the creation of new<lb/> firms. In addition, the positive effect of affiliation to a mutual<lb/> guarantee scheme has been larger for those firms with shorter<lb/> lending relationships with banks. In the United Kingdom, on<lb/> the other hand, participation in the national Small Firm Loan<lb/> Guarantee Scheme has made beneficiary firms more likely<lb/> to export and hire new workers than similar non-borrowing<lb/> firms (<ref type="biblio">Cowling, 2010</ref>). Moreover, ethnic minority businesses<lb/> and businesses located in disadvantaged areas have been over-<lb/>represented in this scheme, which has therefore strengthened<lb/> inclusive entrepreneurship in the country.<lb/> The European Commission supports loan guarantee pro-<lb/>grammes through the Joint European Resources for Micro to<lb/> Medium Enterprises (JEREMIE) initiative. Policy makers can use<lb/> EU structural funds to invest in revolving financing instruments<lb/> such as venture capital, loan or guarantee funds that promote,<lb/> among other things, the creation of new businesses. One of the<lb/> main benefits of the JEREMIE initiative is its portfolio-based<lb/> approach. National and regional Funds can allocate JEREMIE<lb/> resources to instruments with different risk profiles, thus<lb/> spreading risk across the portfolio of instruments, although<lb/> JEREMIE also requires national and local Funds to be able to<lb/> generate revenues out of the whole range of products and<lb/> become self-sustainable. This leaves policy makers with some<lb/> room for introducing relatively riskier products such as CGSs for<lb/> disadvantaged entrepreneurs, which can eventually be cross-<lb/>subsidised by safer products generating stronger revenues.<lb/></p>

			<head>Microcredit<lb/></head>

			<p>Microcredit aims to tackle market barriers and cultural barri-<lb/>ers at the same time, for commercial banks lend against the<lb/> provision of collateral and with a type of business in mind<lb/> that does not necessarily fit the one run by migrants, women<lb/> or young entrepreneurs. If combined with financial education<lb/> and business advice, microcredit can address skills barriers in<lb/> access to finance as well.<lb/></p>

			<p>In the European Union microcredit refers to loans of less than<lb/> EUR 25 000 for micro-enterprises employing less than 10 employ-<lb/>ees, self-employed or unemployed and inactive people who want<lb/> to move into self-employment but do not have access to tra-<lb/>ditional banking services (</p>

			<table>EIF, 2009). Microcredit first emerged<lb/> in developing countries and reached Europe only more recently.<lb/> The first microfinance institutions (MFIs) date back to the 1980s<lb/> in Eastern Europe and to the 2000s in Western Europe. (5) This<lb/> different timing has led to a divide in the EU microcredit model.<lb/> In eastern countries, for-profit organisations and credit unions<lb/> dominate the sector, whereas in western countries the market<lb/> mainly consists of non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and<lb/> non-banking financial institutions (NBFIs).<lb/> With respect to the services offer, most MFIs combine credit<lb/> with business support and other financial services (e.g. con-<lb/>sumer credit, insurances, etc.); only between 25%-30% of<lb/> European MFIs implement microcredit without additional sup-<lb/>port services (Underwood, 2006; EMN, 2010). The business<lb/> model of MFIs, therefore, relies on a combined product offer,<lb/> higher-than-average interest rates, and loan application fees.<lb/> Nonetheless, the sector still largely depends on public support<lb/> to cover both operational costs and the loan capital, as shown<lb/> by the 63% average repayment ratio of the EMN-surveyed<lb/> MFIs (EMN, 2010). (6)<lb/> Disadvantaged and underrepresented entrepreneurs are impor-<lb/>tant targets of MFIs, but less than it could be expected. Of<lb/> the 170 microcredit institutions covered by the most recent<lb/> EMN survey (EMN<ref type="biblio">, 2010</ref>), as many as 44% reported targeting<lb/> women, 41% ethnic minorities and migrants, 32% the unem-<lb/>ployed, 29% the youth, and 21% the disabled. However, when<lb/> looking at the proportions of microloan clients, only 27% were<lb/> women, 13% were immigrants or members of ethnic minorities,<lb/> and 10% were young people (aged 15-24), despite the stated<lb/> desire of many MFIs to cater for these groups. The propor-<lb/>tion of women is far lower than the corresponding share in<lb/> the developing world, while immigrants and ethnic minorities<lb/> are underrepresented compared to their incidence in the EU<lb/> entrepreneurial population.<lb/></p>

			<p>Digging more deeply into the reasons for this inconsistency sug-<lb/>gests that one issue could be discrimination against disadvan-<lb/>taged and under-represented groups, even among microcredit<lb/> providers. In the case of France, there is some evidence that<lb/> microcredit conditions (e.g. size of the loan and interest rate)<lb/> for women are worse than for men, and cannot be explained<lb/> by either the characteristics of the entrepreneur (e.g. age, work<lb/> experience, education, etc.) or those of the firm (e.g. business<lb/> size, business age, industry, etc.) (<ref type="biblio">Brana, 2013</ref>).<lb/></p>

				<formula>( 5 )<lb/></formula>

			<p>There are, however, some exceptions. For example, ADIE in France was<lb/> set up in 1989.<lb/></p>

				<formula>( 6 )<lb/></formula>

			<p>The EMN survey provides a snapshot about the MFIs that have<lb/> responded to the questionnaire; thus this picture does not necessarily<lb/> reflect that of the EU&apos;s microcredit market as a whole.<lb/></p>

			<head>Box 4 Setting up a microcredit programme<lb/></head>

			<p>Policy makers are faced with important choices when setting up a microcredit scheme. One concerns the Fund operator, which can<lb/> either be selected through a public call for tender or be chosen without any tender among existing public institutions with experience<lb/> in Fund management. The first option has the advantage of drawing on the most cost-effective solution to the government. The<lb/> second option will ensure better coherence between the Fund&apos;s operations and the government&apos;s strategic objectives (COPIE, undated).<lb/> A second choice regards the financial intermediary organisation that will deliver the scheme, which can be an ad-hoc govern-<lb/>ment body or be chosen among existing players in the credit market (e.g. commercial banks, non-bank financial institutions,<lb/> credit unions, etc.), generally through a call for tender. The first option will have the main benefit of building an organisation<lb/> tailored to its mission, but which will have high overhead costs, especially if the microcredit programme is only temporary.<lb/> The second will have the main advantage of leveraging on the expertise of players already active in the credit market, but<lb/> who may not devote the same level of attention to microcredit than to their other activities.<lb/> Microcredit schemes require an attentive distribution of costs among participants, namely government, providers and clients.<lb/> There are several fixed costs involved in a microcredit scheme, including the loan capital, operating and refinancing costs,<lb/> loan assessment and monitoring costs, etc. Additional services such as interest rebates, financial advice and education, and<lb/> business development training also imply costs for microcredit providers.<lb/> Microcredit initiatives are, therefore, unlikely to become fully self-sustainable, and policy makers should expect a strong<lb/> element of subsidisation. This will be especially true for programmes for disadvantaged entrepreneurs who may need com-<lb/>plementary services such as interest rebates and business training to be pulled in the scheme. The provision of additional<lb/> services, together with better communication targeting both disadvantaged entrepreneurs and MFIs, should be part of a<lb/> comprehensive strategy aimed at making microcredit more inclusive than has been so far.<lb/></p>

			<p>The main advantage of microcredit is that, unlike other products<lb/> (e.g. guarantees, crowdfunding, etc.), it is a mechanism specifically<lb/> devised for entrepreneurs who experience difficulties in the credit<lb/> market. Microcredit also helps build the credit history of its clients,<lb/> thus favouring their access to traditional sources of finance. On the<lb/> other hand, microcredit is unlikely to become financially self-sustain-<lb/>able. The harder-to-reach is the target group, the stronger will be the<lb/> degree of subsidisation. A marginal risk is also that microcredit, rather<lb/> than strengthening the credit history of clients, further marginalises<lb/> them into a segmented credit market due to social stigma attributed<lb/> to microcredit clients by senior lending institutions.<lb/></p>

			<p>There are many microcredit initiatives in the EU that deserve<lb/> attention. The case of Fair Finance in London and Crédal in<lb/> Belgium are reported in Boxes 5 and 6 to show how two dif-<lb/>ferent approaches work.<lb/></p>

			<head>Box 5 The UK Fair Finance Microcredit Programme<lb/></head>

			<figure>Target Group: Unbankable clients who have fallen prey to money lenders applying usury loan terms.<lb/> Intervention type: Microcredit and financial education together. UK Fair Finance benefits from guarantees by the European<lb/> Progress Microfinance Facility.<lb/> Objectives: To help unbankable clients out of usury loans through fair credit conditions and financial education. Clients also<lb/> include disadvantaged entrepreneurs through loans up to GBP 10 000.<lb/> Entry requirements: Clients must present feasible financing requests, e.g. repayment of the micro loan must be possible.<lb/> Financial education is accessible for selected target groups.<lb/></figure>

			<p>Description: Fair Finance was launched in 2005 as a spin-off of two successful microcredit and debt advice programmes. The first<lb/> helped over 600 women on peer group circles and made over 300 loans to excluded women in East London. The second worked with<lb/> Local Housing Associations to provide debt advice to indebted house tenants. Today Fair Finance is a not-for-profit social enterprise that<lb/> works with unbankable clients to provide them with fair credit conditions and advice on debt management. The ultimate goal is to prevent<lb/> clients from resorting to usury loans in the black credit market that would further worsen their financial debt situation. The programme<lb/> also develops relationship with traditional banks so that unbankable clients can open bank accounts in the Fair Finance&apos;s offices. To sum<lb/> up, the range of products offered are: i) personal loans of up to GBP 2 000 at affordable rates to help clients out of usury loans; ii) loans<lb/> of up to GBP 10 000 to entrepreneurs unable to access mainstream finance to develop their business idea; iii) debt advice and financial<lb/> capability workshop to local residents to improve their financial management skills; iv) bank account access for people without one.<lb/></p>

			<figure>Results achieved: in 2011 Fair Finance secured investments from a range of social investors to build its business across<lb/> London, and commercial finance from 3 banks to expand its loan capital.<lb/></figure>

			<p>Lessons for other initiatives: Strong leadership and strict administrative procedures are needed to launch effective<lb/> microcredit programmes; targeted approaches in microcredit result in bringing excluded groups into mainstream economy;<lb/> access to microcredit can reduce financial burdens, but not necessarily results in business development; transparency in<lb/> financing (for instance through open information on websites) is an effective tool for promotion and marketing; consider-<lb/>able time needed to attract funding from private sources for the expansion of the model; support services such as financial<lb/> education are effective in improving the general understanding of the borrowing process and can reduce over-indebtedness.<lb/></p>

			<head>Box 6 Belgium&apos;s Crédal Microfinance Co-operative<lb/></head>

			<figure>Target Group: Financially excluded people due to low income, lack of guarantees or bad credit history.<lb/> Intervention type: Start-up microloans and social credit, with the participation of the European Social Fund, the Walloon<lb/> region, the Brussels region, and the banking sector. Crédal also benefits from guarantees by the European Progress<lb/> Microfinance Facility.<lb/> Objectives: To strengthen the financial inclusion of non-bankable people that would not be able to receive credit from<lb/> senior lending institutions.<lb/> Entry requirements: For start-up microloans, being interested in becoming self-employed but having been rejected by a<lb/> senior lending institution.<lb/> Programme length: Repayment period for microloans is up to 48 months.<lb/></figure>

			<p>Description: Crédal was founded in 1984 with the vision of reinforcing social cohesion. Its first activity was to finance non-<lb/>profit organisations and cooperatives through various traditional credit mechanisms at low interest rates. In 2000, Crédal<lb/> started a microcredit programme targeting credit-excluded people who wanted to start a business but could not obtain<lb/> suitable finance from traditional banks. The size of loans ranges from EUR 500 to EUR 12 500, repayment is due within 48<lb/> months, and the charged interest rate is 5%. Microcredit is combined with other microfinance instruments such as &quot; social<lb/> credit &quot; , which addresses the transport, training or health-related needs of low-income.<lb/></p>

			<figure>Results achieved: In 2012, Crédal granted 642 microloans for business start-ups and 2 032 social loans.<lb/> Lessons for other initiatives: Target group approach is effective; multi-stakeholder support in terms of financing is needed<lb/> in the start-up and expansion phases of the microcredit activity; subsidies for operational costs and supporting services are<lb/> justified to ensure that a fair (but still market-level) interest rate is charged.<lb/></figure>

			<p>Microcredit plays a central role in the European Union&apos;s strat-<lb/>egy for financial inclusion and inclusive growth. In 2010, the<lb/> Commission&apos;s Directorate General for Employment, Social Affairs<lb/> and Inclusion set up the European &quot; Progress Microfinance &quot;<lb/> Facility, which absorbed previous smaller initiatives in the field<lb/> and represents the first EU-wide initiative designed specifically<lb/> for the microfinance sector (EC, 2013b). (7) Jointly funded by<lb/> the European Commission and the European Investment Bank,<lb/> &quot; Progress Microfinance &quot; follows a two-pronged approach. On<lb/> the one hand, it provides guarantees and counter-guarantees<lb/> to lending institutions (banks, microcredit providers, etc.) to<lb/> support their portfolios of microloans. On the other, it offers<lb/> the same eligible institutions four types of funded instruments:<lb/> senior loans, subordinated loans, risk-sharing loans and equity<lb/> participations. The guarantee mechanism has been allocated<lb/> EUR 25 million by the European Commission, while the four<lb/> funded instruments are jointly supported by the European<lb/> Commission (EUR 80 million) and the European Investment<lb/> Bank (EUR 100 million) (EIF, 2012).<lb/> In June 2013, it was decided to further integrate &quot; Progress<lb/> Microfinance &quot; into a wider EU initiative for employment and<lb/> social cohesion; the EU programme for &quot; Employment and<lb/> Social Innovation &quot; (EaSI). EASI integrates and extends the cov-<lb/>erage of three existing programmes: i) Progress (Programme<lb/> for Employment and Social Solidarity); ii) EURES (European<lb/> Employment Services); and iii) &quot; Progress Microfinance &quot; . The<lb/> latter will receive 21% of the overall EaSI budget. There will<lb/> also be extended coverage for social enterprises and funding<lb/> for capacity-building in microfinance institutions.<lb/></p>

			<head>Alternative debt finance<lb/></head>

			<p>Overdrafts, factoring, leasing and trade credit are important<lb/> sources of debt finance alternative to bank loans. There is<lb/> evidence that small businesses use these sources of finance<lb/> extensively, with more than one-quarter using trade credit,<lb/> more than one-third using leasing, hire purchase and factor-<lb/>ing, and more than one-third using credit lines and overdrafts<lb/> (<ref type="biblio">European Central Bank, 2013; European Commission, 2011</ref>).<lb/> With the possible exception of trade credit, alternative sources<lb/> of debt finance are more expensive than loans and are gleaned<lb/> mainly when bank credit is unavailable or difficult to obtain.<lb/> From a policy perspective, alternative credit financing can<lb/> be influenced by national (and sometimes local) regulatory<lb/> reforms impacting on leasing contracts, factoring legislation,<lb/> fees and interest rates on overdrafts, etc. Factoring can also<lb/> be affected by public procurement to the extent that the public<lb/> administration represents an important player in this industry.<lb/> For example, one-third of transferred receivables in Italy are<lb/> from the public sector.</p>

				<formula>(8)<lb/></formula>

			<p>Since entrepreneurs from disadvantaged groups find it difficult<lb/> to obtain commercial bank loans, alternative debt finance is<lb/> relevant to them. Policy can help by pointing disadvantaged<lb/> and under-represented entrepreneurs to these sources of<lb/> finance, e.g. through information, advice and mentoring. It can<lb/> also lobby with banks, especially community-based ones (e.g.<lb/> savings banks and cooperative banks), to help disadvantaged<lb/></p>

			<p>entrepreneurs obtain a bank account and credit line. Credit lines<lb/> can be subsidised through interest rebates, which will lower the<lb/> debt burden on those who may already have limited assets and<lb/> a negative credit history. Trade credit is also relevant because<lb/> it is common in the retailing industry, where migrant and ethnic<lb/> entrepreneurs are disproportionally represented. There is scope<lb/> for raising awareness among this target group about the role<lb/> of trade credit for enterprise financing.<lb/></p>

			<head>Crowdfunding<lb/></head>

			<p>Crowdfunding addresses market, cultural and institutional bar-<lb/>riers in access to finance by disadvantaged entrepreneurs and<lb/> responds to the idea that enterprise financing comes from a<lb/> multitude of people who invest (small) sums, rather than from a<lb/> single large institution, usually via the Internet. The main advan-<lb/>tage for both entrepreneurs and investors lie in the low interme-<lb/>diation costs of crowdfunding, which makes it a cheaper source<lb/> of finance compared to loan and loan guarantees. Intermediation<lb/> costs are dropped for three reasons. First, the assessment of<lb/> business proposals is less thorough than for bank loans because<lb/> crowdfunding companies do not carry the risk of failure related<lb/> to the proposals they post on their web portal. Although a health-<lb/>check of business pitches is common to many platforms, there<lb/> is no incentive for them to undertake a systematic risk analy-<lb/>sis. Second, the project follow-up (i.e. monitoring costs) is also<lb/> minimal and generally left to the direct contact between the<lb/> entrepreneur and the investors, with the crowdfunding website<lb/> acting as a virtual meeting point. Third, relying strongly on the<lb/> Internet, crowdfunding portals have low fixed costs (e.g. staff<lb/> and office space).<lb/> Crowdfunding comes under four main categories, although<lb/> variants and hybrid forms co-exist (<ref type="biblio">De Buysere et al., 2012</ref>):<lb/></p>

			<p>• Donations: in crowdfunding donations are collected and ear-<lb/>marked for specific projects, which have often a social nature.<lb/></p>

			<p>• Rewards: the investee provides the investor with a reward<lb/> that can be of non-monetary nature (e.g. the product that<lb/> the investor is financing) and which is of lower value than<lb/> the sum offered.<lb/> • Lending: thanks to lower intermediation costs, borrowers<lb/> pay a lower interest rate than for bank loans, while lenders<lb/> receive a higher interest rate than for savings deposits.<lb/> • Equity: this is less common than the other three options and<lb/> involves larger sums. Equity crowdfunding is rather similar<lb/> to the activity of business angels, although in crowdfunding<lb/> the local dimension of the investment and its business advice<lb/> component are less strong (<ref type="biblio">Agrawal et al., 2011</ref>).<lb/> In the first three types of crowdfunding, suppliers of finance<lb/> are often not only motivated by profit-seeking but also by<lb/> emotional and social objectives. This, together with the<lb/> small sums involved, makes crowdfunding relevant to inclu-<lb/>sive entrepreneurship.<lb/></p>

			<p>Crowdfunding is a very new market and estimates of its size<lb/> need to be taken with caution. De <ref type="biblio">Buysere et al. (2012)</ref> report<lb/> that in 2011 there were around 200 platforms in Europe which<lb/> had raised EUR 300 million of funding. This corresponded to<lb/> one-half of the total number of platforms worldwide and<lb/> one-fourth of the global crowdfunding market (EUR 1.2 billion).<lb/> The average platform in Europe therefore raises less funding<lb/> than the global average.<lb/></table>

			<p>The average size of the business pitch changes greatly in Europe<lb/> depending on the type of crowdfunding. It is approximately<lb/> EUR 500 for donations, EUR 3 000 for rewards, EUR 4 500 for<lb/> lending, and EUR 50 000 for equity-based crowdfunding. All<lb/> these forms of crowdfunding are on the rise in Europe, although<lb/> donations take the lion&apos;s share with respect to the absolute<lb/> number of crowdfunding campaigns.<lb/> Policy-wise, there is an increasing request for better regulation<lb/> of crowdfunding. The downside of low intermediation costs is,<lb/> in fact, low control by crowdfunding platforms on the viability<lb/> and progress of the business proposals they host. Similarly,<lb/> information on business projects is limited to what entrepre-<lb/>neurs are willing to disclose, whereas more structured and<lb/> homogenous information requirements would help investors<lb/> to make a better choice.<lb/> Since crowdfunding is a very new market and disadvantaged<lb/> entrepreneurs are not always up-to-date with the latest evo-<lb/>lutions in business financing, there is scope for strengthening<lb/> information about this financing mechanism. Financial education<lb/> of both entrepreneurs and investors will help them to understand<lb/> mutual expectations and obligations related to crowdfunding<lb/> transactions. Training and advice for disadvantaged entrepre-<lb/>neurs will have to focus on debt management issues or, should<lb/> crowdfunding be equity-based, on the implications of exter-<lb/>nal equity for business ownership and business management.<lb/> Investors, too, would benefit from help in the assessment of<lb/> business pitches. Since much of crowdfunding is also driven by<lb/> social considerations, advice will need to go beyond traditional<lb/> concepts such as returns on investment (ROI).<lb/> The relevance of crowdfunding is also related to being one<lb/> of the few equity options available to disadvantaged entre-<lb/>preneurs. Small sums of equity will be especially useful to<lb/> innovative entrepreneurial projects run by young or migrant<lb/> entrepreneurs or that address societal challenges (e.g. popula-<lb/>tion ageing, global warming, etc.). The support of equity-based<lb/> crowdfunding, however, also calls for the parallel development<lb/> of senior investors (e.g. business angels) and secondary mar-<lb/>kets to guarantee exit options for those who have invested<lb/> through equity-based crowdfunding.<lb/> Seedmatch provides an example of the potential of equity-<lb/>based crowdfunding for youth entrepreneurship.<lb/></p>

			<head>Box 7 Germany&apos;s Seedmatch Crowdfunding Platform<lb/></head>

			<figure>Target Group: Start-ups looking for small sums of equity finance.<lb/> Objectives: To strengthen the capitalisation of new start-ups by making access to external equity finance possible.<lb/> Intervention type: Equity-based investment.<lb/> Programme length: Between 5 and 7 years.<lb/></figure>

			<p>Description: Seedmatch is one of the few equity-based platforms in Europe, enabling funders to invest in new start-ups<lb/> and receive shares in return. Seedmatch carries out an in-depth assessment of the business proposals, which abide by<lb/> transparency requirements, and only posts on the platform those that consider worth of investment. This means that they<lb/> target companies with innovation potential and scalable business models. They receive around 1 000 applications per year,<lb/> long-list 200, short-list no more than 50 for interview, and finally post online for investment around 25. Minimum investment<lb/> is EUR 200, while the average investment is EUR 600. From a demographic point of view, young entrepreneurs are quite<lb/> strongly represented among the business founders admitted to the stage of investment, possibly because of the &quot; new &quot; and<lb/> Internet-based nature of this model of business financing.<lb/></p>

			<p>Results: Until now the platform counts approximately 12 500 registered users and has funded 34 business start-ups for<lb/> an investment capital of EUR 3.85 million.<lb/></p>

			<head>Lessons for other initiatives:</head>

			<p>Entrepreneurs must be able to clearly present their business plans and ideas to potential<lb/> investors; crowdfunding through subordinated loans and equity investments can be an effective tool for innovative start-ups;<lb/> investment exit strategies need to be in place at the outset of the funding campaign; platforms have difficulty in becoming<lb/> self-sustainable if the number and volume of transactions remain small.<lb/></p>

			<p>Peer-to-peer lending<lb/> Peer-to-peer (P2P) lending is similar to lending-based crowd-<lb/>funding. Interest rates in these transactions are higher than<lb/> for bank loans, this being the main rationale for the involve-<lb/>ment of lenders. However, it is not uncommon for P2P lend-<lb/>ing to be based on subordinated loans, i.e. loans that in<lb/> case of liquidation can only be claimed after borrowers<lb/> have paid senior lenders. On the borrower&apos;s side, P2P lend-<lb/>ing requires fewer personal securities than bank lending,<lb/> although higher-than-average interest rates will result in<lb/> higher levels of indebtedness. Interest rates in P2P lending<lb/> are set by managing platforms and funds, based on the<lb/> financial information and personal securities of the borrower.<lb/> In some innovative cases, peer-to-peer platforms can carry<lb/> part of the default risk or provide partial insurance against<lb/> loan defaults.<lb/></p>

			<p>The volume of peer-to-peer lending is appraised at<lb/> EUR 20 million per month in Europe (<ref type="biblio">De Buysere et al., 2012</ref>),<lb/> although estimates are only approximate. Success stories in<lb/> P2P lending platforms include Funding Circle in the UK and<lb/> Smava in Germany.<lb/> The business angel market in Europe is estimated at EUR 5 billion,<lb/> only 10% of which is visible through the 460 business angel<lb/> networks identified by the European Trade Association for<lb/> Business Angels (EBAN). The five biggest markets in the EU<lb/> are the UK, Spain, France, Finland and Germany, and the aver-<lb/>age investment per company is EUR 175 000. (10)<lb/></table>

			<p>Although business angels are often associated with high-growth<lb/> entrepreneurship, they can play a role in inclusive entrepreneur-<lb/>ship, too. It should, however, be recalled that profit-making is<lb/> one of the main drivers of business angel investment, which<lb/> is therefore naturally geared towards growth-oriented sectors.<lb/> This is shown by the sector bias of business angel investment<lb/> in Europe, 70% of which goes to information and communica-<lb/>tions technologies and biotech together, while less than 10%<lb/> is directed to consumer goods and services and retail.<lb/> This helps explain why women-owned businesses, which are<lb/> less growth-oriented than men-owned businesses even within<lb/> high-tech sectors, only capture a very small fraction of busi-<lb/>ness angel investment and equity finance. (11) Women are also<lb/> less likely to become business angels, representing less than<lb/> 5% of the business angel population, which may help explain<lb/> the low proportion of business angel investment directed to<lb/> women-owned businesses, although female business angels<lb/> are not particularly influenced by gender considerations in their<lb/> investment decisions (<ref type="biblio">Harrison and Mason, 2007</ref>).<lb/> When female entrepreneurs look for external equity investment,<lb/> they rely extensively on their personal networks of family and<lb/> friends to reach out to business angels and win their trust<lb/> (<ref type="biblio">Amatucci and Sohl, 2004</ref>). This pattern is common to the<lb/> entire business angel sector, which is small-sized and driven<lb/> by personal and affinity relationships. But it means that female<lb/> and young entrepreneurs, who have typically less extensive<lb/> personal networks, will be at a disadvantage compared to their<lb/> male and senior counterparts. For the same reasons, immigrant<lb/> entrepreneurs can benefit from business angel investment from<lb/> investors in their home countries provided that they keep ties<lb/> with the country of origin. Silicon Valley in the United States is<lb/> a case in point of a place where social networks of migrants<lb/> have evolved into professional and business associations, which<lb/> have helped build a two-way bridge where equity investments<lb/> flow between host and home countries (<ref type="biblio">Saxenian, 2006</ref>).<lb/> Policy makers in the EU can support business angel investment<lb/> for socially excluded entrepreneurs in various ways. First, the<lb/></p>

			<head>Islamic finance<lb/></head>

			<p>Muslims in Europe are estimated at 44 million (6% of the<lb/> overall population) and projected to increase to 58 million<lb/> within the next 20 years. (12) Within the European Union, esti-<lb/>mates point to about 19 million of Muslims, 3.8% of the<lb/> EU population (<ref type="biblio">Pew Forum, 2011</ref>). The presence of Muslims<lb/> is stronger in Western and Northern Europe, particularly in<lb/> the Netherlands, Belgium, France and the United Kingdom<lb/> due to the inflow of Muslim migrants and second-generation<lb/> Muslim Europeans. Muslims are especially concentrated in<lb/> urban areas. They are 24% of the population in Amsterdam,<lb/> 17% in Brussels, 10-15% in the Paris region and 8.5% in<lb/> Greater London. (13) Islamic finance, which refers to financing<lb/> tools complying with Sharia-law that forbids interest rates,<lb/> could help the promotion of migrant and ethnic minority entre-<lb/>preneurship in certain countries and regions.<lb/></p>

This principle can apply both to bank deposits and business financing. Eventual losses are<lb/> suffered by the provider of capital.<lb/> • Cost plus (i.e. murabahah): This transaction involves the sale of goods at a price which includes a profit margin agreed<lb/> by both parties. However, in Murabahah, sellers must let buyers know the actual cost of the assets at the time of the<lb/> initial agreement.<lb/></table>

			<p>• Joint venture (i.e. musharakah): It refers to a partnership in which profits will be shared based on an agreed ratio which<lb/> may not be in the same proportion of the invested amounts. On the other hand, incurred losses will be shared according<lb/> to the original ratio invested by each partner.<lb/> • Agency (i.e. wakalah): This is a contract whereby a person (principal) asks another to act on his/her behalf for a specific<lb/> task. The person who takes on the task is an agent who will be paid a fee for the service.<lb/></p>

			<p>• Interest-free financing (i.e. quard): financing is given for a fixed period on a goodwill basis and the borrower is only required<lb/> to repay the amount borrowed. However, borrowers may pay an extra amount as a way to thank the lender if they wish so.<lb/></p>

			<p>There has been a recent surge in the number of Islamic finan-<lb/>cial institutions worldwide, mainly banks and funds, although<lb/> they have so far privileged large investment operations over<lb/> lending to entrepreneurs. Many countries are behind the game<lb/> in terms of the number of Islamic finance institutions and the<lb/> volume of their lending.<lb/> Policy makers in Europe can contribute to reversing this trend<lb/> by supporting the introduction of Sharia-compliant financial<lb/> products within major commercial banks. This will most likely<lb/> require the training of loan officers charged with the offer of<lb/> Islamic finance products. Awareness-raising campaigns will also<lb/> be important on both the demand and supply sides. Muslim<lb/> entrepreneurs may be unaware of new Sharia-compliant prod-<lb/>ucts in the credit market, while financial institutions that offer<lb/> these products need to be ushered into lending to entrepreneurs.<lb/> Community-based organisations can help spread the voice about<lb/> Islamic finance opportunities among Muslim entrepreneurs.<lb/></p>

			<p>Islamic finance can positively impact on the integration of hard-<lb/>to-reach entrepreneurs who would not look for credit unless it<lb/> abides by their religious beliefs. However, policy makers should<lb/> be aware that recent experiments to introduce Islamic finance<lb/> products have not always been successful in Europe, partly<lb/> because of the low income and low activity rates of the target<lb/> population (<ref type="biblio">Stressman Foundation, 2012</ref>).<lb/> The UK is the country in the European Union where Islamic finance<lb/> has advanced the most, with the Islamic Bank of Britain stand-<lb/>ing out as the only fully Sharia-compliant bank in the country.<lb/></p>

			<head>Box 9 Islamic Bank of Britain<lb/></head>

			<figure>Target Group: Muslims interested in financial products, not only related to business financing, compliant with Sharia law.<lb/></figure>

			<p>Objectives: To offer alternative sources of financing to segments of the UK population who, for religious beliefs, are not<lb/> willing to pay interest rates on borrowed money.<lb/></p>

			<figure>Intervention type: retail banking, mainly savings products and overdrafts facilities.<lb/> Programme length: Authorised to operate under UK banking law since 2004, including credit facilities.<lb/></figure>

			<p>Description: The Islamic Bank of Britain (IBB) offers the largest range of Sharia-compliant financial products in the UK, including<lb/> mortgage alternatives, current accounts, savings accounts, and assets management solutions. The major shareholder is Qatar<lb/> International Islamic Bank (over 80%), with the remaining 20% shared between large private investors and the general public.<lb/></p>

			<p>Results: IBB has opened up new banking opportunities for the UK Muslim population, although the share of portfolio covered<lb/> by small businesses and individual clients remains marginal. Most business financing is still concentrated in large operations.<lb/></p>

			<head>Lessons for other initiatives:</head>

			<p>Faith-based schemes operate in closed target markets and are therefore subject to less<lb/> competition and to reliance on standard products; if Islamic finance is to be used for entrepreneurship financing, clear<lb/> promotion campaigns are required; Islamic banks need to devise appropriate services packages to cater for small business<lb/> owners; Islamic finance products are typically more expensive than traditional bank products.<lb/></p>

			<head>Self-financing groups<lb/></head>

			<p>Self-financing groups are community-based systems in which<lb/> members lend to each other. They have originally arisen in<lb/> developing countries, where the most common form has<lb/> been Rotating Savings and Credit Associations (ROSCA). More<lb/> recently, they have also mushroomed in Europe, namely in<lb/> Spain, Italy, Portugal, Hungary, Belgium and the Netherlands<lb/> (<ref type="biblio">Molenaar, 2013</ref>).<lb/> Loans in self-financing groups are proportional to the deposits<lb/> of members. An interest rate can be applied, in which case<lb/> profits are re-invested in the group. Loans are in the range<lb/> of EUR 5 000, with repayment periods often within 6 months<lb/> and never longer than a year. The evidence from developing<lb/> countries points to high repayment rates in group lending<lb/> (<ref type="biblio">Ledgerwood, 1998</ref>), although some argue that by self-select-<lb/>ing their members self-financing groups exclude those at the<lb/> very margins of the society (<ref type="biblio">Green, 2005</ref>).<lb/> Self-financing groups have the potential to enhance the resil-<lb/>ience of vulnerable entrepreneurs (e.g. migrants and disabled<lb/> people), although linkages with more structured forms of<lb/> public support are important to avoid the marginalisation of<lb/> members. Policy-wise, it will therefore be important to encour-<lb/>age ties between self-financing groups and, for example,<lb/> microcredit institutions to support the financial inclusion of<lb/> group members.<lb/></p>

			<p>Target Group: Low-income people who are financially and socially excluded, often with a migrant background.<lb/></p>

			<p>Objectives: To offer alternative sources of debt finance to non-bankable people.<lb/></p>

			<figure>Intervention type: Small sums of debt finance for income-generating activities.<lb/> Programme length: Continuous cycles of one year.<lb/></figure>

			<p>Description: Since 2004 the Spanish foundation Associación de Comunidades Autofinanciadas (ACAF) has gained expe-<lb/>rience in setting up and managing self-funded groups. Partners in ACAF involve the large-scale NGO Ashoka, the Levi<lb/> Strauss Foundation and the Catalonian regional government. Each &quot; self-funded &quot; community (CAF) can be composed of 10<lb/> to 30 people who, through the investment of small sums, become the owners and customers of the organisation. CAFs<lb/> provide services to their members, such as credit and insurance, while generating revenues through interests applied to<lb/> loans. The model differs from traditional microcredit because it does not rely on external funds. More recently, through<lb/> the creation of the Winkomun platform (www.winkomun.org), the organisation has aimed to disseminate more effectively<lb/> the experience of CAFs, facilitate access to the methodology of how to build a CAF, and promote interaction between<lb/> members of CAF communities.<lb/></p>

			<p>Results: Since 2004, ACAF has assisted the foundation of about 80 self-financed groups, with more than 3 500 indi-<lb/>rect beneficiaries.<lb/></p>

			<p>Lessons for other initiatives: Self-financing groups are an effective tool to promote social inclusion, including through<lb/> start-up funding; complementary social orientation and mobilisation programmes are needed to trigger the creation of self-<lb/>help groups; a clear structure helps accelerate the establishment and operations of self-financing groups.<lb/></p>

			<p>THE ROLE OF FINANCIAL EDUCATION<lb/> The discussion has hitherto focused on how policy can<lb/> strengthen the supply of finance, based on evidence that some<lb/> groups of entrepreneurs are disadvantaged, if not discrimi-<lb/>nated, in credit markets (<ref type="biblio">Muravyev et al. 2009; Alesina et al.,<lb/> 2013; Fairlie, 2010</ref>). These initiatives should be coupled with<lb/> financial education interventions aimed at overcoming skills<lb/> barriers in access to finance. The objective should be to make<lb/> disadvantaged entrepreneurs ready to receive a loan or invest-<lb/>ment at</p>

			<table>market conditions.<lb/> A recent OECD survey on knowledge, attitudes and behav-<lb/>iours around financial issues points to significant knowledge<lb/> gaps within the adult population (Atkinson and Messy, 2012).<lb/> The proportion of the population with high scores in financial<lb/> knowledge ranges between 40% in Norway and 69% in Hungary<lb/> among the EU countries covered by the survey. (14)<lb/></table>

			<p>Strong differences in financial knowledge are observed across<lb/> different socio-demographic groups. Women have on average<lb/> lower scores than men, with a gender gap above 20 per-<lb/>centage points in Norway, Poland and the UK. While 67% of<lb/> men in Germany and the United Kingdom reach a high score<lb/> in financial knowledge, the share for women is respectively<lb/> 50% and 40%.<lb/></p>

				<formula>( 14 )</formula>

			<p>The category of financial knowledge included non-specialist questions on<lb/> &quot; division &quot; , &quot; time value of money &quot; , &quot; interest paid on loan &quot; , &quot; calculation of<lb/> interest plus principle &quot; , &quot; compound interest &quot; , &quot; risk and return &quot; , &quot; definition<lb/> of inflation &quot; , &quot; diversification &quot; .<lb/></p>

			<p>Age, income and level of education also matter. Respondents<lb/> with high scores in financial knowledge are most likely to be in<lb/> the age group between 30 and 60 years old, while the youngest<lb/> and oldest respondents do comparatively worse. People with<lb/> high levels of education also obtain better scores in financial<lb/> knowledge, with the largest education-based gap in financial<lb/> knowledge in Germany and Poland. Yet, people with little or no<lb/> formal education also achieve high scores, which suggests that<lb/> financial education can be delivered across a wide range of<lb/> social groups. Finally, those with high income have better finan-<lb/>cial knowledge than those with low income, although income<lb/> is also positively correlated with age and level of education<lb/> (<ref type="biblio">Atkinson and Messy, 2012</ref>).<lb/> Financial knowledge influences financial attitudes and behav-<lb/>iours. Those who rank high in financial knowledge will also<lb/> show stronger propensity to saving and to appropriate financial<lb/> behaviours (e.g. sound budget management, timely payment of<lb/> bills, etc.). An exception is represented by women, who do better<lb/> than men with respect to financial attitudes and behaviours in<lb/> spite of lower scores in financial knowledge.<lb/></p>

			<p>Improving financial literacy skills through financial education<lb/> is, therefore, an important policy area. This is especially true<lb/> for entrepreneurs from disadvantaged groups, since the way<lb/> they manage their business and connect with credit markets<lb/> will affect their livelihood and that of their families. In this<lb/> respect, it is generally recommended that financial educa-<lb/>tion programmes be strongly tailored, because initial financial<lb/> knowledge will vary a great deal among participants (OECD,<lb/> 2012b). Programmes should also be of hands-on nature, draw-<lb/>ing on experiential and interactive methodologies. The ulti-<lb/>mate goal should be to influence attitudes and behaviours,<lb/> rather than focus on financial concepts and principles. Timing<lb/> is also important and should be close to when education is<lb/> most likely to have an impact. Including financial education<lb/> principles in vocational education colleges, self-employment<lb/> training courses or still in active labour market programmes for<lb/> the unemployed can make inclusive entrepreneurship stronger.<lb/> Policy makers should also work on the qualification and accredi-<lb/>tation of financial education providers to guarantee quality in<lb/> the offer of training, while banks and other financial institu-<lb/>tions should be encouraged to communicate with clients in a<lb/> language that is as simple as possible (OECD, 2005).<lb/> In addition to being offered through bespoke programmes,<lb/> financial education can be integrated into other schemes. This<lb/> is, in fact, the best way to deliver financial education because<lb/> training will have a practical end and will be delivered at a<lb/> time when it is most likely to have an impact. Some micro-<lb/>finance programmes (e.g.</p>

			<table>Bulgaria&apos;s JOBS Financial Leasing<lb/> – see Box 11), income-subsidy programmes (e.g. Germany&apos;s<lb/> Start-up Subsidy) and subsidised credit programmes (e.g. Italy&apos;s<lb/> Honour Loans) provide good practice examples, but still too<lb/> often financing schemes do not foresee a component that<lb/> strengthens the financial knowledge of participants. Expected<lb/> benefits from this policy change would include lower rejections<lb/> in loan applications and lower rates of loan default.<lb/> Box 11 &quot; Job Opportunities through Business Support &quot; (JOBS) Financial Leasing Project, Bulgaria<lb/> Target Group: Unbankable low-income people who already run a micro or small business or intend to start a new one. The<lb/> project mainly operates in rural areas (40% of the leases are granted to agricultural producers) that display high rates of<lb/> unemployment and high proportions of minority groups (e.g. Turkish and Roma minorities).<lb/> Objectives: To provide subsidised leasing for the purchase of equipment to entrepreneurs from marginalised groups, thus<lb/> favouring their social integration.<lb/></table>

			<p>Intervention type: The provision of finance – leasing in this case – is combined with financial education and business<lb/> management training. The training component is compulsory and the leased equipment is only received after participants<lb/> have passed a test assessing their understanding of basic financial and management principles. Ownership of the leased<lb/> good is attained after full repayment of the lease.<lb/></p>

			<figure>Programme length: It varies depending on the value of the leased equipment.<lb/></figure>

			<p>Description: The JOBS Financial Leasing Project&apos;s offer has been comprehensive and flexible. It combines the supply of<lb/> leasing finance with business support services such as financial education and business management training. Future<lb/> entrepreneurs must complete 20 hours of training, after which they sit an examination where they have to answer correctly<lb/> 80% of the questions. However, those who already manage a business can try to pass the test without going through the<lb/> full training course.<lb/></p>

			<p>The JOBS Financial Leasing Project caters for both existing and future entrepreneurs. The latter are targeted through the<lb/> Start-with-Leasing programme. For new entrepreneurs the only condition to receive support is to have a viable business<lb/> idea that will result into the hiring of at least one additional person. The programme is also tailored to the special needs of<lb/> Roma entrepreneurs, who receive longer repayment terms and grace periods and are requested a smaller advance payment.<lb/></p>

			<p>The programme is delivered by 42 business centres and 10 business incubators, which have been set up at local level by<lb/> local labour offices, municipalities and other public and private-sector organisations. Centres and incubators take the legal<lb/> status of not-for-profit organisations and are in charge of the purchase of the leased equipment and of the financial educa-<lb/>tion and business development courses.<lb/></p>

			<figure>Results: From 2000 to 2008, 1 985 companies were supported by the scheme through EUR 10.4 million in leasing finance,<lb/> 34 660 people obtained stable employment, and nearly 53 500 benefitted from training courses. The programme has grown<lb/> in popularity throughout the 1990s, and business incubators and business centres have become able to generate revenues<lb/> by leasing equipment to participants.<lb/></figure>

			<p>Lessons for other initiatives: Financial education, together with business development training, should be a key component<lb/> of programmes that supply finance for entrepreneurs from disadvantaged and under-represented groups; business support<lb/> services such as training and advice should be delivered both before and during the period of financial support; leasing can<lb/> be an important component of microfinance programmes, provided that adequate measures are taken to prevent frauds<lb/> (e.g. public registration of equipment) and intense marketing of clients is undertaken.<lb/> Source: http://goodpracticeroma.ppa.coe.int/en/pdf/110<lb/></p>

			<head>CONCLUSIONS<lb/></head>

			<p>Women, migrant, young and low-educated entrepreneurs expe-<lb/>rience difficult access to credit and credit conditions. Although<lb/> cases of open discrimination are possible, this is more often<lb/> the outgrowth of firm-specific and market-specific factors: e.g.<lb/> low entrepreneurial and financial literacy skills of the entre-<lb/>preneur and undercapitalisation or low growth prospects of<lb/> the business. The mere supply of finance is unlikely to solve<lb/> alone a condition of multifaceted disadvantage. Programmes<lb/> financing inclusive entrepreneurship should be aligned with<lb/> other initiatives supporting entrepreneurial skills and market<lb/> development skills.<lb/></p>

			<p>Grants and subsidised credit have proven effective in the past<lb/> in helping the self-employment of hard-to-reach groups (e.g.<lb/> the unemployed and the youth), although they are an expensive<lb/> policy in a time of public budget constraints. Emerging financing<lb/> schemes can complement traditional policies. Loan guarantee<lb/> programmes have been applied in many EU countries (e.g. Italy,<lb/> France, Denmark, the Netherlands, etc.). However, the main<lb/> focus of credit guarantee schemes has been on traditional small<lb/> enterprises, while their ability to reach disadvantaged new<lb/> entrepreneurs needs be strengthened. This recommendation<lb/> also applies to microcredit. At the EU level, women and migrants<lb/> are underrepresented among the clients of MFIs compared to<lb/> the share they represent in the entrepreneurial population.<lb/> Targeted microcredit programmes are warranted to ensure that<lb/> these groups are not excluded from a financing mechanism<lb/> that is important for the goals of inclusive entrepreneurship.<lb/> New Internet-based sources of finance (e.g. crowdfunding and<lb/> peer-to-peer lending) hold the potential to foster inclusive<lb/> entrepreneurship mainly in light of the small sums they provide<lb/> and the emotional drive that motivate investors. Nonetheless,<lb/> EU and national legislations ruling these platforms will have<lb/> to be strengthened to prevent frauds and provide investors<lb/> with more transparent information on the companies seek-<lb/>ing finance.<lb/> Finally, supply-side interventions need to be coupled with others<lb/> that improve the skills of the entrepreneur. Financial educa-<lb/>tion will help disadvantaged entrepreneurs to achieve a better<lb/> understanding of the credit system and increase their chance<lb/> to have loan requests approved.<lb/></p>

			<p>The following recommendations are put forward:<lb/> • Monitor the extent to which entrepreneurs from groups<lb/> disadvantaged in the labour market (e.g. youth, migrant,<lb/> low-educated) or underrepresented in the entrepre-<lb/>neurial population (e.g. women and seniors) experi-<lb/>ence more difficult access to finance than mainstream<lb/> male entrepreneurs.<lb/></p>

			<p>• Ensure that government-supported loan guarantee pro-<lb/>grammes and microcredit schemes adequately reach socially<lb/> disadvantaged entrepreneurs and, if this is not the case,<lb/> take remedial action by either setting up special sections<lb/> in mainstream schemes, or by launching new targeted pro-<lb/>grammes aimed at disadvantaged entrepreneurs (women<lb/> and youth entrepreneurs).<lb/> • Expect to provide a strong subsidy component to loan guar-<lb/>antee and microcredit programmes that specifically target<lb/> entrepreneurs from disadvantaged groups.<lb/></p>

			<p>• Raise awareness among entrepreneurs about the potential of<lb/> Internet-based financing tools (e.g. crowdfunding and peer-<lb/>to-peer lending), but also introduce adequate legislation to<lb/> avoid misuse and protect investors.<lb/></p>

			<p>• Encourage linkages between community-based tools, such<lb/> as self-financing groups, and more structured government<lb/> programmes aimed at strengthening general access to finance<lb/> for entrepreneurs.<lb/> • Combine supply-side policies with improved financial literacy<lb/> skills amongst disadvantaged entrepreneurs to enhance their<lb/> chances of obtaining finance in credit markets.<lb/></p>

			<head>GLOSSARY<lb/> Basel III</head>

			<p>– Set of new rules and regulations governing the banking sector introduced in the aftermath of the 2008 global economic<lb/> crisis and that will become fully operational by 2018. These rules mainly provide for higher capital and liquidity requirements,<lb/> with the aim of making banks more resilient to future economic crises.<lb/></p>

			<head>Collateral assets</head>

			<p>– Assets required of borrowers by lenders to issue a loan. They usually include goods (real estate,<lb/> vehicles, etc.) that can be seized, totally or partly, by the lender in the event of loan default.<lb/></p>

			<p>Crowdfunding – A collective transfer of relatively small resources through lending or equity investment into an entrepreneurial<lb/> project. This is usually done with the help of an Internet platform acting as a virtual meeting point between entrepreneurs<lb/> and investors.<lb/></p>

			<head>Factoring</head>

			<p>– The sale of accounts receivable by an enterprise to a factoring company at a discounted value. It is used to cope<lb/> with cash-flow emergencies when entrepreneurs prefer receiving a discounted payment immediately rather than await the full<lb/> payment of receivables later.<lb/></p>

			<head>Financial education</head>

			<p>– The process by which financial consumers/investors improve their understanding of financial products,<lb/> concepts and risks and, through information, instruction and/or objective advice develop the skills and confidence to become more<lb/> aware of financial risks and opportunities to make informed choices, to know where to go for help, and take other effective actions<lb/> to improve their financial well-being (OECD, 2005).<lb/></p>

			<head>Islamic Finance</head>

			<p>– Financing activity in compliance with Sharia law that forbids the charge of interest rates by lenders on<lb/> borrowers. Lending is not ruled out, but lenders are treated as stakeholders. It has so far been more commonly used by large<lb/> investment funds than to support entrepreneurs.<lb/></p>

			<head>Loan guarantee</head>

			<p>– Commitment by a third party to cover part of the losses related to a loan default. It can be provided by the<lb/> government and/or or by a private business association. It is backed up by a fund acting as collateral.<lb/></p>

			<p>Leasing – Rental of work-related equipment against a monthly fee. The entrepreneur resorting to leasing may or may not become<lb/> owner of the equipment at the end of the leasing period, depending on the terms of the contract.<lb/></p>

			<head>Microcredit</head>

			<p>– Small-sized loans to borrowers who find it difficult to obtain credit from traditional banks. It consists in small<lb/> sums generally at higher interest rates than those available at traditional banks to reflect the riskier profile of the borrower. In<lb/> the EU, the microcredit threshold is set at EUR 25 000.<lb/></p>

			<head>Overdrafts</head>

			<p>– Lines of credit by which lending institutions allow borrowers to withdraw beyond their deposits. They have typically<lb/> a ceiling that reflects the perception of risk that the banks ascribe to borrowers. A very expensive source of external finance, it<lb/> is nonetheless common among entrepreneurs.<lb/></p>

			<head>Self-financing groups</head>

			<p>– Community-based systems in which members make deposits and lend to each other. They are not dependent<lb/> on external support from philanthropic or financial institutions and lend only up to the limit of the resources they own.<lb/></p>

			<head>Trade credit</head>

			<p>– Lenders are not financial institutions but company suppliers, who let buyers pay invoices within an agreed delay<lb/> period (usually between 30 and 90 days). Entrepreneurs can therefore use part of the revenues to pay for the supply. It is com-<lb/>mon in retail.<lb/></p>
