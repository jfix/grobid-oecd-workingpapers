			<head>This article examines the emergence of technology-enabled active learning environments and the<lb/> reasons for their appearance. It explores three case studies and considers how effective they are in<lb/> enhancing teaching and learning outcomes.<lb/></head>

			<p>The recent advent of wireless broadband Internet access and mobile communications devices<lb/> has provided remarkable opportunities for 21 st century blended learning models – simultaneous<lb/> online and face-to-face – and seriously called into question the industrial-age traditional &quot; egg crate<lb/> classroom &quot; model of teaching and learning. It has also enabled the emergence of a true synchronous/<lb/> asynchronous and virtual/physical matrix of learning opportunities for which our existing built learning<lb/> environment infrastructure is not well suited. 1<lb/></p>

			<p>In response to these developments, many innovative learning environments are being trialed. These<lb/> include an increasing focus on the &quot; third space &quot; which supports social forms of student interaction.<lb/> The important issue here, especially in universities, is that students can now learn off-campus on line.<lb/></p>

			<p>This is forcing us to rethink the nature of the 21 st century campus, and more specifically what physical<lb/> attributes need to be provided to encourage students to attend campuses and to actually meet face-to-<lb/>face with their colleagues, rather than interacting through the now prevalent social networking tools.<lb/> Interestingly, many of these spatial developments are being instigated – through initiatives lead by<lb/> information technology and communications departments – particularly in universities and increasingly<lb/> in further education and schools. 2<lb/></p>

			<head>LeARning technoLogieS<lb/></head>

			<p>The above developments are blurring the boundaries between what has traditionally been seen as the<lb/> &quot; built learning environment &quot; and the information and communications technologies that support those<lb/> spaces. The rapidly emerging models of &quot; technology enhanced learning environments &quot; (TEAL) – first<lb/> introduced at MIT in 2003 3 – emphasises that acoustics, furniture, lighting (both natural and artificial),<lb/> mobility, flexibility, air temperature and security must support the educational technologies being<lb/> designed for those spaces. The traditional physical elements are technologies as well, but increasingly<lb/> these are interdependent with ICTs and audio-visual educational technologies.<lb/></p>

			<p>In my view, all of these elements should be integrated under the one heading of &quot; learning technologies &quot;<lb/> and be considered within the same framework, whether it be budget, design, maintenance or flexibility.<lb/> The key issue is that the life cycle of each element and how these vary must be attended to in such a way<lb/> that all elements are up to date. 4 &quot; Stuff &quot; , as Brand calls the moveable elements, includes technologies<lb/> such as computers which tend to have a life cycle of 3 years. The space plan may well be 7 years, the<lb/> services 10-20 years whilst the structure could be in excess of 100 years. We are, of course, finding that<lb/> inserting these new technologies into existing buildings, and especially heritage buildings, is complex.<lb/></p>

			<p>It is paramount that these new innovations align the physical space with the educational technologies<lb/> so that both can support the pedagogies envisaged for those spaces. It is critical that this happen; after<lb/> all, the traditional classroom had to evolve from simply meeting the didactive teaching methods which<lb/> predominated prior to the emergence of significant educational technology.<lb/> I believe that the limitations of the traditional classroom in supporting these learning approaches is a cause<lb/> of concern, whether they be in the form of lecture theatres and seminar/tutorial rooms in universities,<lb/> or closed boxes for 25-35-40-45 students in schools (depending on the relevant country). The closed<lb/> classroom represents a physically outdated teaching model which does not match the inter-connected<lb/> virtual world we now live in. Students are learning collaboratively through a vast array of informal learning<lb/> spaces both on and off campus, yet are still crammed into outdated traditional models. What we know as<lb/> the &quot; knowledge age &quot; is rapidly morphing into a &quot; creative age &quot; yet classrooms, according to the students<lb/> I have surveyed, are the least creative space they can learn in.<lb/></p>

			<p>These learning spaces need to adapt to meet the emerging needs of a wide range of pedagogies.<lb/> This concept is reflected in the Australian Learning and Teaching Council&apos;s 5 recent appointment of<lb/> 15 discipline-specific teaching and learning advisors.<lb/></p>

			<p>Although the original TEAL model noted above was launched to rejuvenate the teaching of Physics 1 at<lb/> MIT, many versions of it have proliferated in geology, chemistry, engineering, education, architecture<lb/> and some other disciplines. It is in engineering that the most advances have been made and this is<lb/> largely because of the need for engineers to have a wide range of competencies than cannot be assessed<lb/> solely in the examination room.<lb/></p>

			<p>About the same time as TEAL, MIT&apos;s Aeronautical School initiated a new pedagogical model called<lb/> CDIO (conceive, design, implement and operate). This approach has now taken off across the globe. Its<lb/> wide use and variations in practice can be seen at www.cdio.org.<lb/></p>

			<p>These issues are important because engineering schools are preparing students who, as professional<lb/> engineers, will be required to work in self-directed ways through problem solving and collaborative<lb/> team work. 6<lb/> A critical notion to understand is the concept of graduate attributes or graduate competencies. For<lb/> engineers, these might be expanded to include critical thinking, communicating to peers and the wider<lb/> community, working in multi-disciplinary teams and environmental literacy. Engineers are involved<lb/> in complex projects involving infrastructure which means they will have to work across – and in<lb/> collaboration with – a range of disciplines. To continue to learn in a didactive,</p>

			<table>teacher-centred way will<lb/> not provide students with those competencies.<lb/> 5. See http://www.altc.edu.au/april2009-altc-discipline-scholars-begin.<lb/> 6.

			<p>This was first understood in the teaching of medical students. For some 30 years medical students have<lb/> been taught in a collaborative way with groups of ten students being supported by a tutor. This model<lb/> is difficult to achieve across all disciplines because of budget constraints, but the approach can be<lb/> modeled using the TEAL concept.<lb/></p>

			<p>In order to illustrate how effective they are in enhancing teaching and learning outcomes, three case<lb/> studies have been selected and are presented in chronological order, from 2003 to 2010.<lb/></p>

			<head>the Australian Science and Mathematics School (ASMS) 8<lb/></head>

			<p>Opened in 2003, this public senior high school for pupils aged 15-18 (the final three years of secondary<lb/> school) has been featured in many publications and received many international visitors because of its<lb/> innovative design which meets what was then seen as a &quot; radical &quot; pedagogical approach. This school<lb/> was planned around the CDIO concept before that concept became common knowledge.<lb/></p>

			<head>Technology-enabled active learning environments: an appraisal<lb/> 4 th Year and doctoral engineering design Studio, the University of new South Wales<lb/></head>

			<p>This facility, opened in April 2010, was designed for 100 4 th year and 30 doctoral engineering students.<lb/></p>

			<figure>Figure 4. 3d view of the concept showing collaborative learning, research students,<lb/> gallery space and café informal learning area<lb/></figure>

			<p>The key elements of the studio are as follows:<lb/></p>

			<p>• It offers integrated collaborative learning for undergraduates, postgraduates and partners in industry<lb/> in research-led pedagogy where students work actively on projects with industry.<lb/> • It facilitates interaction between undergraduate, postgraduate and academic staff based on real-<lb/>world design and research projects.<lb/></p>

			<p>• It simulates the project-based type of environment students will face when entering industry.<lb/> • It comprises a studio, study spaces for 30 doctoral students, a gallery/foyer and functions space, café/<lb/> kitchenette for social and other functions involving project partners from the world of industry.<lb/></p>

			<p>• No fixed technology is used other than plasma screens at the perimeters: the technology used by<lb/> students consists of state-of-the-art wireless and battery-powered devices eliminating the need for<lb/> clumsy power and data connections which limit flexibility.<lb/> • It can accommodate 96 students in groups of 8; its 12 tables fold away to allow alternative uses for<lb/> the space.<lb/></p>

			<p>• It allows students to work collaboratively on project-based activities in three-hour sessions. Not all<lb/> students use the practical studio or laboratory at the same time, but they work on specific set projects<lb/> in small groups.<lb/></p>

			<p>• Social spaces and reflective spaces surround the studios for informal and collaborative study.<lb/></p>

			<p>• It is used by the Faculty of Architecture, Building and Planning for construction students.<lb/> • Students now feel part of a community of learners and are observed within the Faculty for greater<lb/> periods of time on campus, including weekends and evenings<lb/></p>

			<head>evALUAtion oF teAL<lb/></head>

			<p>These emerging TEAL models which proliferated since MIT first launched the concept in 2003 are in<lb/> the early stages of evaluation. Some publically available articles on evaluation show that these spaces<lb/> work well. Although it is difficult to argue that the physical learning environment by itself can enhance<lb/> teaching and learning, it is clear that the physical learning environment can inhibit the practice of<lb/> some forms of effective pedagogy and therefore limit the extent to which graduate competencies can<lb/> be delivered to students.<lb/> For example, on average 90% of ASMS&apos;s students go on to university, and yet it has no classrooms. However,<lb/> another equivalent but independent senior secondary school, which only has classrooms and uses a tutor<lb/> model (but with equally motivated teachers and students) also results in 90% entry to university. The key<lb/> question, still to be researched, is whether these respective students are successful at the end of the first<lb/> year and can then move effectively through the university system. Specifically, is the TEAL approach more<lb/> effective in creating life-long learners compared to the 19 th century traditional classroom model?<lb/></p>

			<head>Technology-enabled active learning environments: an appraisal<lb/></head>

			<p>Some studies suggest that there are significant improvements to learning outcomes in adopting this<lb/> approach.<lb/></p>

			<table>Overall, these Active Learning Classrooms yielded very positive responses from instructors and<lb/> students. The instructors who were interviewed enjoyed teaching in the rooms so much that their only<lb/> concern was a fear of not being able to continue to teach in these new learning spaces. Similarly, more<lb/> than 85% of students recommended the Active Learning Classrooms for other classes. Instructors and<lb/> students overwhelmingly found that this space made a difference for them. &quot; I love this space! It makes<lb/> me feel appreciated as a student, and I feel intellectually invigorated when I work and learn in it. 9<lb/> The studio space is also a significant investment and so must clearly improve learning outcomes:<lb/> engagement, attitude and collaboration in addition to absorption of the curriculum. Measures of<lb/> those outcomes are necessarily qualitative at this point, but based on comments from student and<lb/> faculty who actually learned and taught in the space, we would cautiously say that the studio has<lb/> met those goals. Of course we will need to continue to evaluate progress in outcomes as people gain<lb/> experience with using the space. 10<lb/></table>

			<p>In evaluating teachers&apos; learning at the ASMS, a recent doctoral graduate found significant connections<lb/> between the pedagogical process and the flexibility of the ASMS school design. 11 Clearly, evaluation<lb/> of the TEAL approach involves both quantitative and qualitative examination. It is also evident that<lb/> qualitative studies show significant support for the TEAL model from both teachers and students. Further<lb/> quantitative study is required to support these qualitative findings and this work is currently underway at<lb/> the University of Melbourne&apos;s LEARN centre. 12 Findings will be made available as they become public.<lb/> What is most pleasing from my viewpoint is that there are exciting alternatives emerging to the traditional<lb/> closed classroom and these are gaining increasing acceptance. I certainly look forward to evaluating<lb/> and using these findings in future projects and research.<lb/></p>
