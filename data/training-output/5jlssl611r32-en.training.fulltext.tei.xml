			<head>1. MOTIVATION AND OVERVIEW<lb/> 1.1. Water in the Global Economy<lb/></head>

			<p>The links between water scarcity and economic growth are complex and are only gradually<lb/> becoming apparent. There is relatively little literature that convincingly links water scarcity to economic<lb/> growth; the seminal work in this respect is <ref type="biblio">Sadoff et al. (2015)</ref>. They find a strong relationship between<lb/> water insecurity and growth, using a 113 country panel data analysis. The OECD Environmental Outlook<lb/> Baseline projects future demand for global freshwater (or more precisely &quot; blue water &quot; excluding rainfed<lb/> agriculture) to increase by 55% between 2000 and 2050 and this is expected to make water one of the<lb/> most fiercely contested resources on the face of the planet (OECD, 2012). However, the projected pattern<lb/> of growth in demand for water is quite varied, with water use in the OECD countries declining over this<lb/> period, while growth in the BRIICS region is expected to nearly double (<ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref>.4, OECD, 2012). The<lb/> same report also identifies the complex channels through which water affects economic growth. Sorting<lb/> these out requires a more complete model of the global economy. The purpose of this report is to provide<lb/> background information useful for such a quantitative global assessment of the impact of water scarcity<lb/> on growth using a multi-region, recursive-dynamic, Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) model, such<lb/> as the OECD&apos;s ENV-Linkages model. Issues related to the quality of water are beyond the scope of this<lb/> report.<lb/></p>

			<head>1.2. Implications for economic growth<lb/></head>

			<p>Before embarking on a detailed review of the literature on water, water scarcity, sectoral activity and<lb/> economic growth, it is useful to revisit several strands of economic theory to put this issue in context.<lb/> This report explores three different aggregate economic models, each of which treats water in a different<lb/> way. In so doing, it sheds light on several dimensions of water&apos;s impacts on economic growth which will<lb/> need to be taken into account as we move forward with the incorporation of water into a CGE framework.<lb/></p>

			<head>1.2.1. Water as a publicly provided good, subject to congestion<lb/></head>

			<p>A suitable starting point is the framework developed by <ref type="biblio">Barbier (2004)</ref> who views water as a<lb/> publicly provided input into economic production. Individual firms&apos; draw on a common pool of water for<lb/> their activities so that their firm level output depends on the aggregate rate of water withdrawal. If<lb/> decision makers wish to make more water available to individual firms, the aggregate rate of withdrawal<lb/> must rise, relative to aggregate output. Furthermore, since this publicly provided input is subject to<lb/> congestion, as the rate of withdrawal rises, relative to aggregate output, the marginal productivity of that<lb/> water in any individual firms&apos; production declines. This is a clever way of dealing with the reuse problem<lb/> which will be discussed in more detail later in this report. Reuse presents a great challenge in regional and<lb/> national scale modelling, since water passing through one use is often reused downstream – after<lb/> appropriate treatment. On the supply side, the cost of providing additional water increases at an increasing<lb/> rate in Barbier&apos;s model, before eventually reaching some maximum rate of withdrawals determined by the<lb/> region&apos;s hydrological limits.<lb/></p>

			<figure>ENV/WKP(2016)11<lb/> 9<lb/> Figure 1. The optimal rate of water utilisation<lb/> Source: Reproduced from Barbier (2004)<lb/></figure>

			<p>When embedded within an optimal growth model, which accounts for the fact that resources devoted<lb/> to water extraction cannot be used to accumulate productive capital, an inverted-U shaped relationship<lb/> emerges between water withdrawals and economic growth (<ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>). On the horizontal axis is the rate of<lb/> water utilisation, relative to total fresh water availability, and on the vertical axis is the economy&apos;s growth<lb/> rate. Within this framework, at any given point in time, there is an optimal rate of water withdrawal at<lb/> which the overall growth rate is maximised. Anything to the left of the optimal rate of withdrawal<lb/> suggests that the economy could benefit from greater public investment in water infrastructure since, at<lb/> the margin, the marginal cost of provision is lower than the marginal benefits conferred from greater<lb/> availability for firms or households in the economy. On the other hand, economies that find themselves to<lb/> the right of the optimum are devoting too many resources to water extraction. This could be either due to<lb/> very low water availability, or to an economy which is overly intensive in its use of water.<lb/></p>

			<p>Having developed this model, Barbier proceeds to estimate its key parameters using cross-section<lb/> data for 163 countries in the 1990&apos;s. The model shows the expected properties (inverted U-shaped<lb/> relationship), and the parameter values imply a positive elasticity of growth with respect to withdrawals.<lb/> For example, a 10% increase in the rate of water utilisation could increase the average growth rate in the<lb/> sample of countries from 1.3 % per capita to 1.33 % per capita. He concludes: &quot; Our estimations of this<lb/> relationship also suggest that current rates of fresh water utilisation in the vast majority of countries are<lb/> not constraining economic growth. To the contrary, most countries may be able to increase growth by<lb/> utilising more of their fresh water resources, although there are obvious limits on how much additional<lb/> growth can be generated in this way. &quot; Barbier does find that sixteen of the countries in his sample (about<lb/> 10 % of the observations) do face conditions of extreme water scarcity, and in these cases, further<lb/> statistical tests suggest that growth may be adversely affected by lack of water. This suggests that, during<lb/> the historical period examined, and when assessed at national scale, the problem of water scarcity<lb/> constraining economic growth was likely quite limited.<lb/> However, in practice, water supply and demand rarely respect national boundaries and so the<lb/> analysis of water scarcity and economic growth is not naturally amenable to country-level analysis. It may<lb/> be that the growth of subnational entities are more obviously constrained by water scarcity, but this fact<lb/> gets obscured when they are aggregated with unconstrained river basins. This is likely to be particularly<lb/> problematic for large countries and countries which draw on many river basins. Suffice it to say, at this<lb/> point, that, while Barbier finds little evidence of water scarcity constraining growth at the national level,<lb/> ENV/WKP(2016)11<lb/> 10<lb/> this does not preclude water scarcity being more widespread at the sub-national level. Subnational<lb/> analyses are also important due to the imperfect substitutability of ground for surface water (OECD,<lb/> 2015a). Some regions rely heavily on one or the other, and, as shown below this can have important<lb/> consequences for economic growth.<lb/></p>

			<head>1.2.2. Aggregate Production Function Approach<lb/></head>

			<p>Continuing in the spirit of Barbier&apos;s work, but now thinking about water as an input (W) into a<lb/> national production function, GDP (denoted as y) can be written as a function of water and a composite<lb/> input comprising both physical and human capital (K):<lb/> ( , )<lb/> y f K W<lb/> <lb/> . For simplicity let us assume that<lb/> this production function is of the Constant Elasticity of Substitution (CES) variety so that substitution<lb/> possibilities in this economy can be characterised by a constant elasticity of substitution,  . As society<lb/> accumulates additional capital, one expects the capital/water ratio: /<lb/> KW to rise, thereby inducing relative<lb/> scarcity of water – assuming that the overall supply of water is limited by the hydrological cycle. In such<lb/> an economy, the value of  is critical to the potential for long run growth in this economy. If firms and<lb/> households can take advantage of the increasingly abundant capital to invest in water-saving or reuse<lb/> technologies, and if these technologies are sufficiently effective, then growth will proceed apace. This is<lb/> indicative of an economy with a large value of  . Indeed, provided<lb/> 1<lb/>   , even in the absence of water-<lb/>saving technological change, the share of water in GDP will diminish over time as the economy becomes<lb/> more and more water-efficient through capital-water substitution. On the other hand, in an economy<lb/> where output per gallon of water cannot be increased via capital investment (<lb/> 0<lb/>   ), growth will be<lb/> curtailed if water supplies cannot be increased through additional capital investment. Therefore, from an<lb/> empirical point of view, it is important to obtain accurate estimates of the sectoral elasticity of<lb/> substitution between other inputs and water.<lb/> In practice the economy comprises many sectors, each with many different end uses for water. Water<lb/> can also be processed and reused in many cases. Therefore, an economy-wide estimate of  needs to<lb/> reflect the possibility of such reuse. In addition, it must reflect not only the ability to become more<lb/> efficient in specific end uses, but also the possibility of eliminating some end uses altogether. The<lb/> economy-wide estimate of  must also incorporate the potential to substitute away from products<lb/> produced by particularly water-intensive technologies. These types of intra-and inter-sector substitution<lb/> relationships are difficult to capture in a single aggregate economic model. However, the goal of<lb/> multisector Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) models is to capture these effects. By including<lb/> within the model the potential for technical substitution and innovations at a disaggregated level, as well<lb/> as the potential to substitute away from water intensive intermediate and final goods, CGE models allow<lb/> for an accurate assessment of the economy-wide potential for substitution of capital and other inputs for<lb/> water. This is why CGE models will be a focal point of this survey of water scarcity and economic<lb/> growth.<lb/></p>

			<head>1.2.3. Water and Growth in a CGE Framework<lb/></head>

			<p>A natural way to think about economic growth within a CGE framework is to track the per capita<lb/> utility of a representative household in the economy. From a policy perspective, changes in utility are<lb/> typically translated into monetary terms (e.g. USD) using the concept of equivalent variation (EV), or the<lb/> change in real income associated with a reduction in water availability. EV is likely to be affected via a<lb/> number of different channels. This section explores these channels in some detail, as they will determine<lb/> the ultimate impact of water scarcity on economic growth and welfare. As this discussion requires some<lb/> technical background, the following sub-section develops these ideas in detail. The reader solely<lb/> interested in policy implications can skip over this sub-section and go immediately to the policy sub-<lb/>section.<lb/> ENV/WKP(2016)11<lb/> Technical Preliminaries: Equation (1) provides a stylised decomposition of regional economic<lb/> welfare in the context of a global CGE model (Huff and Hertel 2001). (Notation will be introduced as we<lb/> discuss this equation.) For the sake of compactness, this expression abstracts from the impact of emerging<lb/> new economic activities, increased scale of production, and endogenous productivity, as would be found<lb/> in many contemporary CGE applications. These are readily incorporated in an extended welfare<lb/> decomposition. However, water scarcity is unlikely to play a large role in any of these components of<lb/> economic growth. Equation (1) also abstracts from capital depreciation, taxes/subsidies on intermediate<lb/> inputs, and exogenous changes in efficiency. All of these considerations are typically also included in<lb/> global CGE analyses – in particular those based on the GTAP framework. However, they are not required<lb/> to make the key points under consideration<lb/> here.<lb/></p>

			<p>Before proceeding, note that the EV<lb/> decomposition in equation (1) refers to the<lb/> change in welfare in region s – just one<lb/> region of the many in the global economy<lb/> where r denotes a trading partner region<lb/> which is the source of imports into our<lb/> focus region, s. s<lb/>  is a scaling factor which<lb/> is normalised to one initially, but changes as<lb/> a function of the marginal cost of utility in<lb/> the presence of non-homothetic preferences<lb/> (<ref type="biblio">McDougall 2003</ref>). The subscripts i refer to<lb/> produced commodities, of which there are<lb/> N in total. As shown below, in most CGE<lb/> models, this is where municipal water<lb/> shows up since the municipal water supply<lb/> is provided by a public utility using scarce<lb/> resources. Water can also appear as an<lb/> endowment, alongside capital, labour and<lb/> land, of which there are E endowments in<lb/> total, each potentially employed in any of<lb/> the J sectors. In this case, one thinks of the<lb/> sector in question extracting the water as part of its sectoral production function. Obviously this would be<lb/> the case for the municipal utility providing water as an intermediate input to other sectors. However, it<lb/> also applies to farms which pump groundwater for use in irrigating their crops, and industries which<lb/> supply their own water. In this case, the capital, labour and energy used in groundwater pumping<lb/> embedded in the production function for the irrigated sector. So water can show up in several places in<lb/> this welfare decomposition. Ultimately water availability traces back to physical endowments of water<lb/> and it is the scarcity of this water endowment which will be our focus here.<lb/></p>

			<p>The first way in which water scarcity affects welfare in this economy is the most obvious, direct<lb/> channel – namely there is less water available for use! In the case of water endowments, this is captured<lb/> by the first term in brackets <lb/> <lb/></p>

			<p>. So if the contribution of water to the regional economy is USD<lb/> 1billion, and there is a 10% reduction in its availability, then a first-order guess at the welfare cost would<lb/> be 0.10*USD 1bill. = USD 100mill. This is just a first-order estimate, since any reduction in available<lb/> water will affect the marginal value product of water. It is also the kind of estimate which can be<lb/> generated without resource to an economy-wide model. Of course, such a shortage will also interact with<lb/> other features of the economy – hence the need for economic modelling in the context of the CIRCLE<lb/> project. The subsequent discussion draws out the most important types of interactions which the<lb/> economic model will need to capture.<lb/> In a market-based model (the problem presented by the absence of water markets will be discussed<lb/> shortly), the valuation of water is embedded in the market price, which is expected to rise with increasing<lb/> scarcity. Whether or not the proportionate rise in price exceeds the proportionate decline in water<lb/> availability can be related directly back to the economy-wide elasticity of substitution discussed above. If<lb/> 1<lb/>   , then price will rise less than quantity, and the value pre-multiplying the proportional change in<lb/> water availability to the economy will fall. On the other hand, if water is essential to household and firm<lb/> production processes ( 1<lb/>   ), then price will rise faster than the quantity reduction and the valuation of<lb/> water in the economy will rise as water becomes more scarce. In this case, the penalty for the first 1% cut<lb/> in water will be less than that which applies when cumulative reductions have reached 10%. The<lb/> empirical literature on the price elasticity of demand for water discussed throughout this survey provides<lb/> support for the hypothesis that, in many cases,<lb/> 1<lb/>   is observed – at least at the level of individual firms<lb/> and households.<lb/> This direct impact of water scarcity on per capita regional welfare notwithstanding, there are quite a<lb/> number of other ways in which water scarcity can affect welfare in region s. The first is via reallocation of<lb/> water. As seen for example with the frequent droughts in California, water scarcity can result in<lb/> significant shifts in different sectors&apos; claims on the diminished water resources. 2 When the marginal value<lb/> product of water in different uses differs greatly within an economy, there is considerable potential for<lb/> &apos;second best&apos; efficiency effects from such reallocations. Consider the situation portrayed in <ref type="figure">Figure 2a</ref> in<lb/> which a pre-determined amount of water withdrawals, W , is allocated between sectors A and B, as<lb/> reflected by the initial allocations: A<lb/> W and B<lb/> W . This pattern of water allocation reflects the presence of an<lb/> implicit subsidy on water use in sector A – or equivalently – a tax on Endowment Water use in sector B<lb/> of region s: EWBs<lb/> <lb/> --since the marginal value product of water in A (read off the *<lb/> Aasegment) is lower<lb/> than that in B (read off the *<lb/> Bbsegment) at the initial equilibrium denoted by point e. Without the<lb/> tax/subsidy, the equilibrium allocation would be *<lb/> W . The loss in economic efficiency to this economy<lb/> from this distorted use of water is measured by the shaded area in <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>.<lb/> 1 .<lb/> This expression offers a local approximation to EV, for large changes, the price and quantity levels must<lb/> also change. The ensuing numerical integration is what allows us to compute the sources of EV for large<lb/> shocks.<lb/> 2 .<lb/> The substitutability between surface water and groundwater also matters when considering reallocation.<lb/> ENV/WKP(2016)11<lb/> 13<lb/></table>

			<figure>Figure 2. Welfare cost of an implicit subsidy on water used in Agriculture (A)<lb/> Source: Authors&apos; own elaboration<lb/></figure>

			<p>Several CGE studies have sought to quantify this loss in efficiency. For example, in a recent study of<lb/> water and economic growth in South Africa, Hassan and Thurlow (2011) estimate that the benefits of<lb/> reallocation of water within the agricultural sector and across water board regions within the country<lb/> would amount to a recurring economic gain equal to 4.5% of agricultural GDP. This effect is captured in<lb/></p>

			<table>Equation (1) by the term: <lb/> <lb/> Eijs<lb/> ijs<lb/> ijs<lb/> PFE dQFE<lb/> <lb/> , wherein the implicit subsidy of endowment i to a specific<lb/> crop (j) in region s is captured by the term <lb/>  0<lb/> Eijs<lb/> ijs<lb/> PFE<lb/> <lb/>  due to the presence of a subsidy (negative<lb/> tax), so that when the amount of water allocated to this use falls,<lb/> ijs<lb/> dQFE &lt;0</table>

			<p>, there is a welfare gain, as<lb/> anticipated by <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>. The same concept applies to the other terms in Equation (1), which refer to output<lb/> subsidies/taxes, as well as consumption subsidies/taxes. (Intermediate inputs have been excluded from<lb/> Equation (1) for the sake of simplicity, but can also play a key role.) In short, the larger the initial<lb/></p>

				<formula>distortion <lb/> <lb/> Eijs<lb/> ijs<lb/> PFE<lb/> <lb/></formula>

			<p>, and the larger the reallocation of water <lb/> <lb/> ijs<lb/> dQFE , the greater the potential gain<lb/> from a reallocation. In her review of the empirical literature on water use and allocation, Olmstead (2013)<lb/> cites intersectoral price differentials between agriculture and urban uses in the United States wherein the<lb/> latter can be paying as much as 100 times as much as the former sector pays for water. This suggests that<lb/> such reallocation effects could be very large indeed.<lb/></p>

			<p>To the extent that increasing water scarcity induces such reallocations of water amongst competing<lb/> uses, then some of this area can be recouped as an efficiency gain, thereby offsetting some of the loss<lb/> associated with the water reduction. Another way of thinking about this is to consider a situation in which<lb/> all of the water shortage is absorbed by sector A. Since the MVP of water in A is less than the average<lb/> valuation of water in the economy, part of the loss calculated in the first term of Equation (1) will be<lb/> made up through the reallocation effect captured in the second term of (1). This outcome is consistent<lb/> with the view of some water analysts that irrigated agriculture is the residual claimant on regional water<lb/> resources, and it is this sector which will suffer most of the reductions if and when water use is curtailed.<lb/></p>

			<figure>ENV/WKP(2016)11<lb/> 14<lb/> Figure 3. Welfare implications of a rise in world food prices facing an agricultural exporter<lb/> Source: Authors&apos; own elaboration<lb/></figure>

			<p>Even if there is not an explicit decision to reallocate water between the two sectors, the presence of<lb/> this factor market distortion can give rise to unanticipated efficiency changes, provided the allocation of<lb/> water between the two sectors is subject to adjustment at the margin, as would be the case if this is<lb/> achieved via a subsidy, a tax, or a quota which is periodically re-evaluated. Consider, for example, the<lb/> case in which there is an improvement in nonfarm technology over time, such that the marginal value<lb/> product of water schedule associated with production in sector B rises from *<lb/> Bb to *<lb/> Bb  . Then region s<lb/> will firstly benefit from improved technology (the shaded technology gain area in <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>), and it will<lb/> also gain from the induced reallocation of water from sector A to sector B (efficiency gain area in<lb/> <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>). This kind of interplay between economic growth and water scarcity on the one hand, and pre-<lb/>existing distortions on the other hand, is evidenced in the next three terms in Equation (1). The presence<lb/> of output subsidies or taxes, consumption taxes on domestic and imported goods, as well as tariffs on<lb/> imports, will likely interact with the quantity changes induced by water scarcity and sometimes give rise<lb/> to significant welfare effects at the regional level (<ref type="biblio">Liu et al. 2014</ref>).<lb/> Of course, when the inter-sectoral allocation of water is controlled by quotas, and these quotas are<lb/> not adjusted over time, then the efficiency change component of <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref> will not materialise. However,<lb/> if the pressure caused by the economic growth in sector B eventually results in a reallocation of quotas,<lb/> then this principle is applicable. There is an additional efficiency gain, relative to baseline welfare in the<lb/> economy and it is larger, the greater the initial distortion in the water market EWBs<lb/> <lb/> , and the larger the<lb/> reallocation of water from sector A to sector B ( dW ).<lb/> The final two terms in equation (1) refer to the terms of trade effects alluded to above. In practice,<lb/> most countries engage in two-way trade, such that they are both exporters and importers of most product<lb/> categories. This makes the terms of trade calculations more complex. It is no longer sufficient to simply<lb/> focus on a region&apos;s net exports. The effect of bilateral changes in export prices (<lb/></p>

			<head>irs<lb/> PFOB</head>

			<p>) and import<lb/> prices (<lb/></p>

			<head>irs<lb/> PCIF</head>

			<p>) for all goods traded with all partner regions must now be considered. Indeed, in an<lb/> investigation of the trade impacts of projected water scarcity, <ref type="biblio">Liu et al. (2014)</ref> find that trading countries<lb/> are differentially affected depending on how intensively they trade with the economies affected by water<lb/> scarcity.<lb/> Policy Implications: From the point of view of policy analysis, the key point of the preceding<lb/> technical discussion is that water scarcity and economic growth can interact in a variety of ways. Most<lb/> decision makers think first and foremost about the direct effect: The economy now has fewer resources to<lb/> work with, therefore growth is expected to slow down, with the extent of this lost welfare depending on<lb/> the marginal economic value of water to the economy and the size of the shortfall. However, there are<lb/> many other potential avenues through which water scarcity can affect the economy. By raising the cost of<lb/> production for water intensive goods and services, water scarcity sends a signal to reduce the output of<lb/> these sectors. If this releases water to higher value uses, such that most of the adjustment in use occurs in<lb/> low value (subsidised) sectors, then the losses may not be as great as initially thought. The size of such<lb/> offsetting gains increases with the size of the initial disparity in effective prices paid for water and the<lb/> quantity of reallocation which occurs. In her review of the empirical literature on water use and<lb/> allocation, Olmstead (2013) cites intersectoral price differentials between agriculture and urban uses in<lb/> the United States where the latter can be paying as much as 100 times as much as the former sector pays<lb/> for water. 3 This suggests that such reallocation benefits could be very large indeed – especially if the<lb/> water crisis led this distortion to be reduced.<lb/></p>

			<p>In a global economy, water scarcity also affects the price of traded goods and services. For countries<lb/> which rely heavily on water-intensive imports, future water scarcity can result in terms of trade losses – or<lb/> gains in the case of net exporters of these products. If, in addition, these activities are themselves<lb/> recipients of other sorts of taxes and subsidies, there is potential for additional &apos;second best&apos; effects. For<lb/> example, in their analysis of the impact of future water scarcity on global trade and economic welfare, <ref type="biblio">Liu<lb/> et al. (2014)</ref> find that global welfare losses in their 2030 scenario are exacerbated by the increase, relative<lb/> to baseline, in subsidised agricultural production in the EU and the US – two regions which experience<lb/> relatively less long run scarcity in water in the aggregate according to the long run projections (<ref type="biblio">Rosegrant<lb/> et al. 2013</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<head>1.2.4. Virtual Water Trade<lb/></head>

			<p>With water scarcity increasingly influencing commodity trade patterns, a new body of literature has<lb/> arisen around the concept of &apos;virtual water trade&apos;. The idea is that nearly all commodities require water in<lb/> their production process – irrigated agriculture being one of the most striking examples. When water is<lb/> physically consumed in one region to produce commodities which are themselves exported and consumed<lb/> in another region, this implicit transfer of water resources is dubbed &apos;virtual water&apos;. 4 The volume of<lb/> virtual water trade has grown, along with growth in global trade, and it is estimated to have risen from<lb/> 259 cubic km in 1986 to 567 cubic km in 2007 (<ref type="biblio">Dalin et al., 2012</ref>). The concept of virtual water trade is<lb/> fully consistent with global CGE modelling. Water-augmented global CGE models allow for both the<lb/> calculation of water embodied in production at a given location, as well as the tracking of bilateral flows<lb/> from the region of production to the region of consumption. Therefore, they offer an ideal vehicle for<lb/> predicting how virtual water flows are likely to evolve in the future, including under scenarios of<lb/> economic reform or climate change (<ref type="biblio">Konar et al., 2013</ref>).<lb/> ENV/WKP(2016)11<lb/> 16<lb/></p>

			<head>1.2.5. Implications for the Modelling of Water Scarcity and Growth<lb/></head>

			<p>This brief overview of some of the basic principles behind water scarcity and economic growth<lb/> provides some important guidelines as it reviews the literature pertaining to specific sectors of the<lb/> economy. The first point is that the costs of increasing water withdrawals must be factored in, and this<lb/> cost function should be convex, such that costs rise at an increasing rate. There is empirical support for<lb/> this characterisation of costs; if they are not present in the model, one risks greatly overstating the benefits<lb/> from increasing withdrawals. A second point relates to the importance of understanding the extent to<lb/> which capital, and other inputs, can be substituted for water in response to scarcity. This could come in<lb/> the form of more efficient equipment, improved recycling of water, or enhanced extraction.<lb/> Underestimating this potential for capital-water substitution could lead to overstating the costs of water<lb/> scarcity to the economy. In addition to this type of factor substitution, it is also possible to conserve<lb/> scarce water through the modification of the mix of products produced and consumed in an economy.<lb/> Capturing this effect requires understanding how water scarcity feeds through to higher prices for water-<lb/>intensive goods and services, and ultimately alters household consumption patterns. Finally, as water<lb/> scarcity will affect different parts of the economy, and these different parts are all linked, a multi-sectoral<lb/> economy-wide analysis using e.g. CGE models, is the suitable tool for investigating how the costs of<lb/> water scarcity are influenced by feedbacks from scarcity to economic growth.<lb/></p>

			<p>The welfare decomposition discussed above underscores the critical importance of accurately<lb/> estimating the marginal value product of water in different uses and understanding the mechanism by<lb/> which water shortfalls are allocated across uses. While quotas are a common vehicle for allocating water<lb/> to different uses, these are themselves likely to change in response to long run market conditions and<lb/> these changes must be part of any long run analysis as they will have important implications for economic<lb/> efficiency and hence economic growth.<lb/></p>

			<p>Finally, it must be borne in mind that CGE models in general, and global CGE models in particular,<lb/> are only one of many approaches to analysing the impacts of water scarcity. Indeed, as shown in the<lb/> ensuing literature review, the accurate specification of global CGE models relies heavily on more<lb/> disaggregated studies of water supply and demand. Most of these studies are partial equilibrium in nature,<lb/> assuming economic growth is exogenously specified and instead delving into the complexities of water<lb/> supply and demand in a given watershed or river basin. Such studies are essential inputs into the type of<lb/> global CGE analysis proposed in the ensuing report.<lb/></p>

			<head>2. AGRICULTURE: THE LARGEST CONSUMER OF WATER<lb/></head>

			<p>How much water is used to produce food each year? Crop evapotranspiration alone (not including<lb/> water for food processing and preparation) consumes about one litre of water to produce one calorie<lb/> (<ref type="biblio">Molden 2007</ref>). Using this metric, one can calculate that the total amount of water vaporised in a year to<lb/> feed today&apos;s 7.1 billion people amounts to 7.7 cubic kilometres. One fifth of this water total comes from<lb/> the application of irrigation water which, in turn, accounts for 70 % of total annual global freshwater<lb/> withdrawals (<ref type="biblio">Molden 2007</ref>). Even though agriculture withdrawals have decreased in some regions over<lb/> the past decade, they still represented 44% of total freshwater withdrawals of OECD countries (OECD,<lb/> 2013). Although it faces increasingly stiff competition for water from other uses in many parts of the<lb/> world, agriculture is therefore the largest consumer of water in the global economy and will remain so in<lb/> ENV/WKP(2016)11<lb/> 17<lb/> the foreseeable future (<ref type="biblio">Faures et al. 2007</ref>). This suggests that water use for irrigation deserves special<lb/> attention in any analysis of the implications of future water scarcity for the global economy.<lb/></p>

			<head>2.1. Extent of irrigation<lb/> 2.1.1. Global irrigated area<lb/></head>

			<p>According to the most recent assessment by the FAO, 16% of the world&apos;s cultivated cropland is<lb/> equipped for irrigation (Alexandratos and Bruinsma 2012). Since the use of irrigation is subject to<lb/> multiple factors including investment, climate condition and water endowment, the extent of irrigation<lb/> varies considerably across regions (<ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>). About 70% of the area equipped for irrigation is located in<lb/> 15 Asian countries, 16% in America, 8% in Europe, 5% in Africa and 1% in Oceania (<ref type="biblio">Siebert et al. 2010</ref>).<lb/> The dependency on irrigation can either enhance or impair a country&apos;s agricultural comparative<lb/> advantage, depending on the costs of irrigation and how well irrigation needs can be satisfied. On the<lb/> beneficial side, reliable and sufficient irrigation boosts yields and reduces agriculture&apos;s vulnerability to<lb/> climate variability. Nonetheless, agriculture that is highly dependent on irrigation may become more<lb/> fragile under the circumstance of irrigation shortfall. <ref type="biblio">Liu et al. (2014)</ref> find that intensively irrigated<lb/> regions like India, China and Middle East/North Africa may experience increased food imports in the<lb/> coming decades as water is diverted from agricultural to non-agricultural uses due to rising income<lb/> growth and urbanisation.<lb/></p>

			<figure>Figure 4. Percent of cropland that is irrigated, by grid cell area, globally. Total irrigated area is 285 Mha<lb/> Source: Siebert et al. (2010)<lb/></figure>

			<p>Between the present and 2050, it is expected that net global irrigated area will continue to expand,<lb/> but more slowly compared with the historical growth, as a result of overall adequacy of current food<lb/> supply, increasing scarcity of suitable areas for irrigation, more intense competition for water and rising<lb/> importance of investment in other sectors (<ref type="biblio">Alexandratos and Bruinsma 2012</ref>). The estimated 20 million<lb/> ha net expansion by mid-century is expected to occur almost exclusively in land-scarce developing<lb/> countries (<ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref>) where increases in agricultural output will depend heavily on yield increases<lb/> (<ref type="biblio">Bruinsma 2009</ref>). Unfortunately, the cropping areas most in need of irrigation are often located in regions<lb/> where water resources are naturally scarce and facing increasingly stiff competition from other uses. This<lb/> points to rising opportunity costs of water devoted to irrigation and greater pressure to conserve irrigation<lb/> water.<lb/></p>

			<figure>Figure 5. Area equipped for irrigation: historical and projected (Mha).<lb/> Source: Bruinsma (2009)<lb/></figure>

			<p>In the preceding discussion, and in much of the global agriculture literature, the extent of irrigation is<lb/> characterised by the area equipped for irrigation. A more relevant indicator tracks the area where<lb/> irrigation is actually in use. The FAO estimated this fraction to average about 85% (ranging from<lb/> 40-100%, depending on the region) of the global 302 million ha equipped area, during the period 2005/07<lb/> (<ref type="biblio">Alexandratos and Bruinsma, 2012</ref>). The distinction between the two immediately leads to the problem of<lb/> how to model expansion of irrigation. One suggestion would be to differentiate harvested and physical<lb/> irrigated area. Expansion reflected by newly irrigated area is typically lower than expansion measured by<lb/> the growth of areas actually irrigated (10% vs. 12% from 2005/07 to 2050, according to <ref type="biblio">Alexandratos and<lb/> Bruinsma, 2012</ref>), due to the continuing increase in multiple cropping under irrigated conditions.<lb/> Additionally, the expansion estimated by the FAO is expressed in net terms, thus not taking into account<lb/> the rehabilitation of existing irrigated areas. Including or excluding this portion of the expansion makes a<lb/> substantial difference in estimating the investment required to sustain irrigated agriculture.<lb/></p>

			<head>2.1.2. Water supply for irrigation:<lb/></head>

			<p>Increasing water supply for irrigation is subject to infrastructure constraints (storage and withdrawal<lb/> facilities) and water source limits (<ref type="biblio">Rosegrant and Cai 2002</ref>). The latter is determined by both hydrological<lb/> flows and the residential, industrial and environmental demands for water. Indeed, agriculture is often the<lb/> residual claimant of water within a given basin although water allocation regimes vary greatly across<lb/> countries (e.g., OECD, 2015b). Keeping infrastructure capacity and water use efficiency unchanged, the<lb/> water budget for irrigation is likely to dwindle as the economy and populations grow. Strzepek and<lb/> <ref type="biblio">Boehlert (2010)</ref> predict an 18% reduction in worldwide water available for agriculture by 2050, mainly<lb/> caused by increasing environmental flow requirements and larger municipal and industrial demands.<lb/> OECD (2012) also foresees a lower water demand for irrigation due to increasing competition from other<lb/> sectors. In hotspots like northern Africa, India, China, parts of Europe, the western United States and<lb/> eastern Australia, the reduction in water for irrigation could be dramatic.<lb/> Forty-two percent of world irrigation water withdrawals come from groundwater, and the rest from<lb/> surface water (<ref type="biblio">Döll et al. 2012</ref>). The two sources of water, however, are rarely distinguished in economic<lb/> models, yet their fundamental characteristics are quite different as are the growth rates and potential<lb/> hydrological constraints (OECD, 2015a). Groundwater is generally less vulnerable to climate variability<lb/> than surface water. The two sources of water also compete with different uses. Groundwater, contributes a<lb/> smaller fraction to public uses: on average, globally, 36% and 27% for households and manufacturing<lb/> versus 42% for irrigation (<ref type="biblio">Döll et al. 2012</ref>). Therefore, it may face less intense competition from non-<lb/>ENV/WKP(2016)11<lb/> 19<lb/> agricultural uses. 5 Finally, the two sources of irrigation have different environmental impacts, as will be<lb/> discussed below.<lb/></p>

			<head>Ground water irrigation<lb/></head>

			<p>Groundwater has a number of valuable characteristics. First of all, it is less sensitive to annual<lb/> climate events as it responds more slowly to meteorological conditions than does surface water.<lb/></p>

			<figure>Figure 6. Groundwater withdrawals in selected countries<lb/> Source: Burke and Villholth (2007)<lb/></figure>

			<p>Therefore, the expectation is that the importance of ground water with regard to irrigation supply<lb/> will intensify as more frequent and severe extreme weather events increase variability in precipitation,<lb/> soil moisture and surface water (<ref type="biblio">Taylor et al. 2012</ref>). During the 2013-15 drought in California, for<lb/> example, farmers largely turned to groundwater for irrigation, fulfilling up to 70% of lost rain water<lb/> supplies and contributing to strong agricultural revenues (<ref type="biblio">Gruere, 2015; Medellin-Azuara et al., 2015</ref>).<lb/> However, the slow recovery of groundwater to a dynamic equilibrium state means withdrawal can easily<lb/> surpass replenishment and lead to groundwater depletion. Over-drafting, especially in the regions that are<lb/> becoming heavily dependent on groundwater, weakens its buffering effect, potentially making agriculture<lb/> even more fragile to longer drought duration. Groundwater intensive use also can lead to major<lb/> environmental externalities, from saline intrusion to land subsidence (OECD, 2015a). <ref type="biblio">Pavelic et al. (2012)<lb/></ref> show that the average residence time of shallow, accessible groundwater ranges from less than one year to<lb/> four years, which explains why two or more years of continuous drought could pose a serious problem to<lb/> farmers relying on groundwater for irrigation.<lb/> 5 .<lb/> While agriculture groundwater use is very high in some regions, the overall average share is under 10%,<lb/> and often minimal in most OECD countries (OECD, 2015b).<lb/></p>

			<figure>ENV/WKP(2016)11<lb/> <ref type="table">20<lb/></ref> Although groundwater availability is much less sensitive to climatic conditions compared with<lb/> surface water, the rate of groundwater recharge could be modified by the altered precipitation pattern<lb/> under the same aquifer conditions. Regions with high transmissivity and storage volume generally have a<lb/> higher reliance on groundwater irrigation, especially when climate conditions are favourable to<lb/> groundwater recharge (<ref type="biblio">Siebert et al. 2010</ref>). In low recharge areas, leakages from inefficient irrigation<lb/> systems actually play a significant role in recharge (OECD, 2015b). In some cases, the linkage between<lb/> groundwater recharge and geophysical conditions could be complicated by land use change. For example,<lb/> in the West African semiarid belt, clearing savannah for cropland modified soil properties and infiltration<lb/> capacities, which substantially increased groundwater recharge (<ref type="biblio">Leblanc et al. 2008</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<p>Another advantage of groundwater has to do with accessibility by farmers, and their ability to use it<lb/> &quot; on demand &quot; (OECD, 2015a). While surface water rights are often predetermined and access involves<lb/> engagement with other institutions, groundwater can in many cases be accessed by simply drilling a well<lb/> – something under direct control of the farmer. Both of these factors have contributed to rapid growth in<lb/> groundwater withdrawals in many regions.</p>

			<figure>Figure 6, taken from Burke and Villholth (2007) shows the<lb/> recent evolution of ground water use in various regions around the world. The growth in India since the<lb/> inception of the Green Revolution is staggering. Bangladesh, China, Mexico and Tunisia also show very<lb/> strong growth. Furthermore, some of the strongest growth has been in regions with low recharge rates as<lb/> shown in Figure 7 (Burke and Villholth 2007).<lb/> Figure 7. Long term average groundwater recharge rates (mm/year)<lb/> Source: Burke and Villholth (2007) based on Döll and Flörke (2005)<lb/></figure>

			<head>Surface water supplies<lb/></head>

			<p>Global water withdrawal from surface sources has been slowing down recently, from a growth rate<lb/> of 2% in the 1980s to -1% during 1990-2010 (<ref type="biblio">Wada et al. 2013</ref>), largely due to the fact that surface water<lb/> has already been heavily exploited and that the construction of new reservoirs has been declining since<lb/> the 1980s (<ref type="biblio">Chao, Wu, and</ref> Li 2008; M. W. Rosegrant, Cai, and Cline 2002). Nevertheless, surface water<lb/> ENV/WKP(2016)11<lb/> 21<lb/> remains the dominant source of irrigation in Europe (70%)</figure>

			<p>, Southeast Asia (more than 80%) and South<lb/> America (<ref type="biblio">Wada et al. 2013</ref>). In OECD, surface water occupies two third of irrigated areas (OECD,<lb/> 2015a).<lb/> Surface water supply is highly climate-dependent. Watershed responses to reduced precipitation<lb/> (including rain-and snowfall) and higher temperatures are typically amplified, due to vegetation<lb/> interception and transmission loss (<ref type="biblio">Arnell 2004</ref>). Thus, for instance a 20% reduction in rainfall might<lb/> yield a 50% reduction in runoff (Turral, Svendsen, and Faures 2010). Although warming tends to increase<lb/> total precipitation and water discharge at the global level (<ref type="biblio">Füssel et al. 2012; Milly, Dunne, and Vecchia<lb/> 2005</ref>), this tendency may not translate directly into a more beneficial effect on surface water irrigation in<lb/> critical regions. This is due to the fact that climate models are predicting an uneven spatial and temporal<lb/> distribution of precipitation, in which the wet areas get wetter and the dry areas drier. Besides, even where<lb/> annual precipitation is not expected to decline, seasonal shifts may cause substantial problems if the<lb/> increased water runoff in rainy season cannot be impounded due to limited storage capacity.<lb/></p>

			<p>The economic literature concerning stochastic surface water supply mainly focuses on its impact on<lb/> the flow of agricultural goods (e.g. crop output) and services (e.g. crop insurance), but there is much less<lb/> emphasis on the stock of capital (e.g. infrastructure). A theoretical analysis performed by <ref type="biblio">Fisher and<lb/> Rubio (1997)</ref> shows that a larger variance of the surface water resource caused by climate uncertainty<lb/> provides an incentive to invest in water reserve infrastructure. In the long-run, the equilibrium level of the<lb/> capital stock (or water storage capacity) will likely increase in the face of a changing climate.<lb/></p>

			<head>2.1.3. Water use in agriculture<lb/></head>

			<p>It is common in the irrigation management literature to divide water applied to soil into two main<lb/> &quot; fractions &quot; , each with two &quot; sub-fractions &quot; . The consumed fraction contains beneficial transpiration and<lb/> non-beneficial evaporation; the non-consumed fraction can be further split into recoverable seepage and<lb/> non-recoverable seepage (Foster and Perry 2010). Distinguishing between these water categories is useful<lb/> when studying irrigation efficiency and water productivity, and their interaction with agriculture,<lb/> resources and environment.<lb/></p>

			<head>Crop consumptive use<lb/></head>

			<p>Consumptive use of water refers to any use that permanently removes water from the natural cycle,<lb/> such that this portion of water is no longer available for immediate reuse. Water is consumed by crops<lb/> when it is transpired, evaporated, or incorporated into products, plant tissue and animal tissue.<lb/> Consumptive water use includes both the beneficial transpiration by crops and the non-beneficial<lb/> evaporation from wet soil (including weed transpiration). Only the beneficial crop consumptive use<lb/> contributes directly to biomass generation. To use water in agriculture more efficiently, one can either<lb/> increase the capacity of crops to utilise water or increase the share of consumptive use relative to non-<lb/>consumptive use.<lb/></p>

			<p>Agricultural water conservation is by no means equivalent to reducing water extraction for irrigation,<lb/> or making water resources available for non-agricultural uses. However, it does relate directly to increases<lb/> in the &quot; output per drop &quot; of consumptive water use in agriculture. In practice, output has been measured<lb/> both by quantity and value, which correspond, respectively, to the physical and economic productivity of<lb/> water. Regions like Sub-Saharan Africa still have great potential to boost yields, thereby increasing<lb/> physical water productivity; while in some Asian countries, where the yield gap is already small, there<lb/> appears to be wider scope to increase economic water productivity than to increase physical water<lb/> productivity (<ref type="biblio">Molden et al., 2007</ref>). For these regions, the objective will likely shift to maximising the<lb/> &quot; value per drop &quot; , or the economic productivity of consumptive water.<lb/> ENV/WKP(2016)11<lb/> 22<lb/></p>

			<head>Losses associated with water storage and delivery<lb/></head>

			<p>This category of use of irrigation water use refers to the portion of water that is withdrawn but not<lb/> directly consumed by the crop. Therefore, this includes evaporation from water storage, which accounts<lb/> for a significant fraction in some regions. For example, reservoir evaporation in Texas amounts to about<lb/> 61% of total agricultural irrigation use during the year 2010 (<ref type="biblio">Wurbs and Ayala, 2014</ref>). In Australia, Craig<lb/> (2005) estimated this loss to be about 40% of the total storage volume. This evaporative loss could<lb/> increase by about 15% by 2080, due to the effect of higher surface temperatures in the face of climate<lb/> change (Helfer, <ref type="biblio">Lemckert and Zhang, 2012</ref>). Increasing total usable water storage by reducing this type of<lb/> loss depends on the adoption of evaporation suppression technology, which is driven by the marginal<lb/> value product of the water to be saved.<lb/></p>

			<p>Another form of non-consumptive use of water in cropland irrigation derives from the water stored<lb/> in soils. This can be further split into recoverable seepage that infiltrates freshwater aquifers as &quot; return<lb/> flows &quot; , as well as the non-recoverable seepage infiltrating a saline aquifer. Much of the water used to<lb/> flood rice fields or to support fish are also not consumed and is returned to the streamflow.<lb/> From the point view of farmers and irrigation engineers, the fraction of water use which does not<lb/> directly contribute to crop production is typically deemed a waste of water. However, when viewed from<lb/> the perspective of the overall watershed, the non-consumptive crop use is not always a loss (<ref type="biblio">Molden<lb/> et al. 2010</ref>). Rather, in many cases, it appears to be a necessity, and even beneficial to soil and crops. One<lb/> example is the process called &quot; salt leaching &quot; . As water evaporates, salts contained in water concentrate in<lb/> the soil and must be displaced by the movement of water applied in excess of evapotranspiration. Thus,<lb/> some of the non-consumptive use is unavoidable and needed to maintain the salt balance in the soil<lb/> (<ref type="biblio">Fereres and Soriano 2007</ref>). Infiltration from surface water irrigation in excess of crop requirements also<lb/> recharges underground water, and downstream water users can benefit from the return flows of upper<lb/> stream users (<ref type="biblio">Molden et al. 2010</ref>). In Japan, irrigation-induced groundwater recharge from paddy rice<lb/> cultivation is very significant; multiple cities use it as a key to reduce aquifer depletion and mitigate the<lb/> risk of land subsidence (OECD, 2015a). Understanding these trade-offs is important for building<lb/> economic models, especially for properly formulating objective functions and constraints. Under certain<lb/> circumstances, the motivation is probably not to save water or to boost yields, but to obtain benefits like<lb/> environmental services, or perhaps simply to save on labour and energy.<lb/></p>

			<head>2.2. Water in livestock production<lb/></head>

			<p>Water for livestock production accounts for 20% of total water used by agriculture (<ref type="biblio">de Fraiture<lb/> et al. 2007</ref>). This includes both the direct use like animal drinking, feed-mixing and service as well as the<lb/> indirect use for grazing and growing feed crops, but 98% of the water consumption is attributed to the<lb/> latter-evapotranspiration of blue and green water in the production of feedstuffs. Producing livestock is<lb/> generally believed to be much more water intensive than producing crops (Mekonnen and Hoekstra<lb/> 2012). For example, the global average water footprint per ton of beef is about 50 times that of vegetables<lb/> and 10 times to that of cereals. However, water for livestock would be considered to be relatively less<lb/> costly compared to the nutritional value of livestock and crops. To continue the previous example, the<lb/> water footprint per gram of beef protein is 5 times of that for cereal protein, and water footprint per gram<lb/> ENV/WKP(2016)11<lb/> 23<lb/> of beef fat is 3 times of that for nuts fat. 6 Nevertheless, meat-based diets do have a larger water footprint<lb/> than a vegetarian diet and therefore place additional burdens on limited water resources.<lb/> Demand for meat will continue to expand in the coming decades, largely driven by world population<lb/> growth and the nutrition transition taking place in many developing countries. It is likely that aggregate<lb/> water use in livestock will increase accordingly. There are several factors at work here. One is related to<lb/> the composition of meat demands due to differences in feed conversion ratios. Beef has a much lower<lb/> conversion rate (11 times more feed per kilogram meat) than chicken, thus leading to a larger total water<lb/> footprint. Nevertheless, only 5% of beef feed comes from concentrates (e.g. cereals), as compared with<lb/> the 73% of chicken feed (<ref type="biblio">Mekonnen and Hoekstra, 2012</ref>). This means, in terms of blue water content, the<lb/> difference between raising beef and chicken is much smaller. As consumer preferences evolve, it is likely<lb/> that the share of chicken in meat consumption will rise, thereby having indirect impacts on the green and<lb/> blue water footprints.<lb/></p>

			<p>Another important consideration is the degree of industrialisation in livestock sectors. The three<lb/> major production systems – grazing, industrial and mixed – have different water requirement profiles.<lb/> Extensive grazing systems are less efficient in feed conversion and therefore require more land resources<lb/> than the industrial systems, but grazing systems require a lower fraction of concentrate feeds, they place<lb/> less stress on blue water, and generate less water pollution than industrial systems for livestock<lb/> production. Over time, the livestock sector has been shifting away from the extensive grazing systems and<lb/> towards industrial systems (<ref type="biblio">Taheripour et al., 2013b</ref>) – a fact which will have important implications for<lb/> future water consumption.<lb/></p>

			<head>2.3. Contribution of irrigation to agricultural production, by region<lb/></head>

			<p>Irrigation was key to the success of the Green Revolution. It contributed substantially to producing<lb/> more food by boosting yields, increasing cropping intensities (i.e., multiple crops grown sequentially on<lb/> the same land throughout the year), and enlarging cropped areas; it also enhances the use of<lb/> complementary inputs (e.g. new cultivars and agrochemicals), thus improving total factor productivity<lb/> (<ref type="biblio">Evenson and Gollin 2003; Hanjra, Ferede, and Gutta 2009; Huang et al. 2006</ref>). In the next few decades,<lb/> the role of irrigation in maintaining high agricultural productivity will remain critical in the context of<lb/> growing food demand, limited resources, and more variable climate. Moreover, investment in irrigation<lb/> can have a multiplier effect – in addition to providing stable output and food at affordable prices, it<lb/> improves nonfarm employment gain, thereby boosting regional incomes and spending (<ref type="biblio">Namara<lb/> et al. 2010</ref>).<lb/> In the developing world, irrigation shows a strong linkage with more productive agriculture and<lb/> poverty reduction. Based on a review of 120 studies that examine agricultural performance in South and<lb/> Southeast Asian countries, Hussain and <ref type="biblio">Hanjra (2003)</ref> show that cropping intensities are generally higher<lb/> for irrigated than for rain-fed areas (111%-242% vs. 100%-168%). Besides, irrigation often leads to<lb/> higher cereal crop yield. For example, paddy rice, if it is irrigated, can yield a maximum of 5.5 tons per<lb/> hectares in the sampled fields, but without irrigation the yield rarely goes above 4 tons per hectares. A<lb/> recently released report by IFPRI (<ref type="biblio">Svendsen, Ewing, and Msangi 2009)</ref> finds that irrigated yields in<lb/> Africa are typically 1.5 to 3 times of those of rainfed yields.<lb/> 6 .<lb/> It should be noted that water footprint measurements do not necessarily relate to the opportunity cost of<lb/> water, which can lead to blatant misinterpretations. For instance, Anderson and Sumner (2016) show that<lb/> the actual drought-related footprint (rather than total water footprint) of a serving of beef is lower than<lb/> that of a serving of almonds or a glass of wine in the California context.<lb/> ENV/WKP(2016)11<lb/> 24<lb/></p>

			<p>In addition to examining the direct effect of water accessibility on agriculture, a large number of<lb/> studies examine the multiplier effect that spreads the benefits of irrigation to other aspects of rural<lb/> development and to the broader economy (<ref type="biblio">Hanjra, Ferede, and Gutta 2009; Mukherji and Facon 2009;<lb/> Smith 2004</ref>). <ref type="biblio">Hussain and Hanjra (2003)</ref> report in their review that irrigated settings often feature higher<lb/> incomes (e.g., a 50% boost), less income inequality (the upper bound Gini of 0.53 versus 0.61 for rainfed<lb/> areas), and lower poverty prevalence (18-53% versus 21-66%).<lb/></p>

			<p>In both developing and developed countries, the value of irrigation is also reflected in how it helps<lb/> agriculture adapt to climate variability and change. Kucharik and Ramankutty (2005) study corn yield in<lb/> counties of Nebraska and Kansas during 1947–2001, and find that irrigation reduced corn yield variability<lb/> by a factor of three. Mendelsohn and Dinar (2003) apply a Ricardian analysis to compare the sensitivity<lb/> of land value to climate. They report that countries rich in surface water resources generally have a higher<lb/> tolerance to warmer and drier weather. Besides, the value of irrigated farm land increases faster than rain-<lb/>fed farm land, probably because irrigation becomes more valuable as climate gets warmer. Recent<lb/> research by <ref type="biblio">Lobell et al. (2014)</ref> highlights the rising sensitivity of non-irrigated crops to drought in the<lb/> Midwest of the US, thus emphasising the importance of supplementary irrigation.<lb/></p>

			<head>2.4. Scope for improvements in water use efficiency<lb/></head>

			<p>The terminology underpinning discussion of water use efficiency in the water management literature<lb/> has undergone incremental improvements since 1950s (<ref type="biblio">Perry, 2007</ref>). This section focuses on two<lb/> concepts – irrigation efficiency and water productivity. Irrigation efficiency is concerned with the reliable<lb/> and precise delivery of water to plants, while water productivity describes the fraction of applied water<lb/> which is actually consumed by crops. In an economic model with water, the former speaks to irrigation<lb/> water supply, while the latter has to do with irrigation water demand, especially the demand shift induced<lb/> by technological change. The two concepts represent different approaches, but both aim to quantify the<lb/> extent to which water is used more efficiently in agriculture.<lb/></p>

			<p>Water use efficiency is critical in determining how the goal of providing sufficient food for the<lb/> world will be achieved. <ref type="biblio">Plusquellec (2002)</ref> estimates that 60% of the additional food in the next few<lb/> decades will be provided by irrigated agriculture. To support such an expansion in irrigated output, world<lb/> agriculture needs to consume additional water, or use the current extraction in a more productive way, or<lb/> both. If irrigation efficiency remains at today&apos;s level, the annual agricultural evapotranspiration may need<lb/> to double in order to feed the world in 2050. But with appropriate agricultural practices, this increase<lb/> could be held down to 60% (<ref type="biblio">Rockström et al., 2007</ref>). The scope for improving irrigation efficiency and<lb/> water productivity will be discussed below.<lb/></p>

			<head>2.4.1. Improvements to irrigation efficiency<lb/></head>

			<p>Irrigation efficiency can be defined as the ratio of crop water requirement to irrigation water<lb/> withdrawal. Here water requirement includes both crop uptake and other beneficial uses like microclimate<lb/> cooling and salt leaching. According to the FAO, average world irrigation efficiency was around 50% in<lb/> 2005/2007. In other words, about one-half of the water withdrawal is &quot; lost &quot; between the source and the<lb/> destination. Among all the regions, sub-Saharan Africa has the lowest irrigation efficiency, averaging<lb/> about half of global efficiency (<ref type="biblio">Alexandratos and Bruinsma, 2012</ref>).<lb/> In the context of economic analyses, irrigation use is affected both by exogenous technological<lb/> changes (pure efficiency gains) and endogenous economic responses to the ensuing changes in relative<lb/> input scarcity and profitability. In terms of production economics, exogenous technological progress<lb/> captures those factors which result in a pure outward shift of the production function. This can only be<lb/> endogenised by incorporating a link between research and development and productivity growth. On the<lb/></p>

			<figure>ENV/WKP(2016)11<lb/> 25<lb/> other hand, changing economic conditions, and water scarcity in particular, can lead to changes in relative<lb/> input prices which also dictate improvements in water use efficiency – but this time due to new<lb/> investments based on existing knowledge.<lb/></figure>

			<p>The interplay between exogenous technological change and endogenous, profit-driven responses on<lb/> the part of individual firms can result in counter-intuitive outcomes. For example, one would expect that<lb/> the exogenous introduction of more efficient irrigation technology would conserve water use in<lb/> agriculture. However, several studies have found evidence in contrast to this widely-held belief (OECD,<lb/> 2016b). For example, Pfeiffer and Lin (2014) find that farmers tended to irrigate larger areas and shifted<lb/> towards more water intensive crops after switching to a more efficient irrigation technology which proved<lb/> more profitable. In natural resource and energy economics, this phenomenon is referred to as &quot; Jevon&apos;s<lb/> paradox &quot; . This is the case where the increase in overall use, following the introduction of a new<lb/> technology, more than offsets the resource saving impact of increasing efficiency per unit of output.<lb/> Another example comes from a simulation study conducted by Ward and Pulido-Velazquez (2008) based<lb/> on the Upper Rio Grande Basin. They illustrate a situation where a drip irrigation subsidy for upper<lb/> stream irrigators reduces return flow, leading to larger depletion of downstream water. The overall<lb/> withdrawal from the basin turns out to be larger than before the subsidy for drip irrigation was provided. 7<lb/></p>

			<p>One implication from these cases is that, when the goal is to conserve water, technological change<lb/> needs to be accompanied by corresponding institutional and legislative changes (e.g. extraction quotas or<lb/> taxes) if one wishes to avoid expansion in overall use. Furthermore, an integrated perspective is needed in<lb/> public policy debates. Taking the Upper Rio Grande Basin study for example, upper stream farmers<lb/> definitely win with yield gains and savings in energy for pumping and delivering water, but at the cost of<lb/> impairing the water rights of downstream users. If from the national view, the evaluation should also<lb/> consider whether the net income gains can compensate the cost to taxpayers and the forgone<lb/> environmental benefits.<lb/></p>

			<head>2.4.2. Improving the efficiency of crop utilisation of water: Water productivity<lb/></head>

			<p>Unlike irrigation efficiency that measures the share of the diverted water finally applied to plants,<lb/> crop utilisation efficiency measures water productivity, or &quot; output per drop &quot; . More output per drop can be<lb/> achieved through two pathways – raising yields (increasing the numerator) and reducing non-beneficial<lb/> consumptive water use (decreasing the denominator). Increasing water productivity places emphasis on<lb/> agricultural practices. For example, limiting non-beneficial evaporative loss could boost yields from 1 to<lb/> 3 t/ha; limiting deep percolation of rainfall could further boost yields by another 2 t/ha (<ref type="biblio">Rockström et al.,<lb/> 2010</ref>). In other cases, the efficiency-enhancing practice may not directly relate to water. Increasing the<lb/> harvest index, better pest and disease control, and adopting drought-tolerant cultivars all contribute to<lb/> raising yield relative to evapotranspiration, and therefore result in more crop per drop. Given political-<lb/>economy issues, it may, however, not be easy for governments to re-allocate the water rights currently<lb/> assigned to high water users when these improve their management practices, and hence policies to<lb/> improve water productivity need to be well aligned with other measures to ensure that total water use is<lb/> reduced.<lb/> It is well recognised that there is considerable room to improve water productivity. <ref type="biblio">Rockström et al.,<lb/> (2010a)</ref> hold the view that current food security concerns related to water are not an issue of water<lb/> scarcity per se, but rather a consequence of the ineffective management of water, soils and crops. Indeed,<lb/> 7 .<lb/> Water efficiency investments can also incite farmers to follow a path of specialisation in irrigated crops,<lb/> which in the end would make them more dependent on water resources and the risks associated with<lb/> climate change (OECD, 2016b).<lb/> ENV/WKP(2016)11<lb/> 26<lb/> a number of recent findings confirm a nonlinear relationship between water productivity and yields (see<lb/> the summary in <ref type="biblio">Rockström et al., 2007</ref>). At a lower level of yield, even a small yield gain can<lb/> significantly increase water productivity. But when the farm moves to a higher level of yield, water use<lb/> tends to rise in direct proportion to output, providing much less incentive for farmers to save water. The<lb/> threshold for this non-linearity is around 3 t/ha, and most small-scale farmers in developing countries<lb/> operate below this threshold, suggesting that they could significantly increase water efficiency<lb/> (<ref type="biblio">Rockström et al., 2007</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<head>2.5. Irrigation stress resulting from climate change<lb/></head>

			<p>In the context of a changing climate, irrigated agriculture is likely to experience significant changes<lb/> due to a combination of factors affecting both the demand and supply sides (OECD, 2014). Irrigation<lb/> stress is a relative measurement, which reflects the proportion of potential irrigation demand that is<lb/> satisfied by actual water consumption. The larger is the gap between the two, the greater the stress on the<lb/> irrigated crop. It was discussed earlier in section 2.1.2 how the supply of irrigation water can be affected<lb/> by climate change. In this subsection, the emphasis is placed on the stress arising from the changing<lb/> demand for irrigation due to climate change.<lb/></p>

			<p>The agricultural sector is highly exposed to climate change, and rising temperatures are likely to<lb/> increase the demand for water as rates of evapotranspiration rise, thereby depleting soil moisture more<lb/> rapidly. It is true that warming also tends to increase precipitation at least in some regions, but <ref type="biblio">Wada et al.<lb/> (2013)</ref> argue that the enhancement of evaporative demand may outweigh the effect of increasing<lb/> precipitation under the more severe emissions scenario (e.g., above 4˚C warming), thereby leading to<lb/> larger irrigation requirements. Moreover, higher temperatures tend to reduce crop water use efficiency,<lb/> which means less beneficial consumptive use relative to the non-beneficial counterparts.<lb/></p>

			<p>In addition to warmer temperatures, climate change is also likely to increase the variability and<lb/> occurrence of extreme events (OECD, 2014 and 2016b). For the same long-term average climatic<lb/> condition, regions with a higher inter-annual variability typically suffer more from water scarcity than<lb/> comparable regions with a more even climate (<ref type="biblio">Döll 2002</ref>), thus requiring more irrigation. Where climate<lb/> change stretches the intervals between precipitation events, crops which used to be rainfed may have to be<lb/> cultivated with supplementary irrigation during the highest stress periods. Finally, climate change-<lb/>induced changes in temperature and precipitation conditions may shift the cropping calendar and growing<lb/> season. This shifts the seasonality of peak irrigation requirements, and may exacerbate the already severe<lb/> water stress during the summer and major crop growing season in some regions.<lb/></p>

			<p>Climate change could also affect both the extensive and intensive margins of water demand for<lb/> irrigation. On the extensive margin, total demand for irrigation is driven up by the increasing area<lb/> requiring irrigation. On the intensive margin, a larger amount of water may need to be applied per hectare<lb/> per year. If represented in net terms, it is likely that the extensive margin will be less dominant.</p>

			<figure>Much of<lb/> the future irrigation investment will be in rehabilitating existing systems. Döll (2002) estimates that<lb/> climate change may cause global total irrigation requirement to increase by 5-8% until the 2070s. About<lb/> two-thirds of the area equipped for irrigation in 1995 will experience an increase in irrigation demand.<lb/> Fischer et al. (2007) find an even large increase of 20% in global irrigation needs by 2080. About two-<lb/>thirds of the increase results from higher irrigation intensity.<lb/></figure>

			<p>It is important to note the considerable uncertainty associated with these estimates. The main source<lb/> of uncertainty is of course the projection of future climate (OECD, 2014). <ref type="biblio">Wada et al. (2013)</ref> compare the<lb/> multi-model projections and find substantial variations among inferences derived from different climate<lb/> and hydrological models. Second, the atmospheric CO 2 enrichment effect on irrigation requirements is<lb/> still unclear. Specifically, on the one hand, a higher CO 2 concentration reduces transpiration at the leaf<lb/> ENV/WKP(2016)11<lb/> 27<lb/> level, (the physiological effect); on the other hand, the subsequent increase in biomass leads to higher<lb/> transpiration at the regional scale (the structural CO 2 effect) (<ref type="biblio">Betts et al. 1997</ref>). Which effect will be<lb/> dominant at regional and global levels remains uncertain.<lb/></p>

			<head>2.6. Modelling irrigated cropping in a global CGE framework<lb/> 2.6.1. Competition for land<lb/></head>

			<p>Land for agriculture and forestry is typically classified into three categories – cropland, pasture land<lb/> and managed forest (<ref type="biblio">Ramankutty et al. 2008</ref>). Most of the CGE models allow land use transformation<lb/> from one type to the other at some conversion cost, while keeping total land supply fixed (Hertel, Rose,<lb/> and Tol 2009). Some models (e.g., MAGNET, ENV-Linkages) focus solely on agricultural land and<lb/> allow the total supply of land to vary depending on returns to farming. Competition for land can take<lb/> place at several levels – first among broad land cover types such as crops, pasture and forestry, followed<lb/> by the competition for cropland among different crop sectors. Demand for land is typically derived from a<lb/> production function, in which land enters as an independent input with a certain degree of substitutability<lb/> with other input factors. Land use is driven by the demand for land based products, as well as the<lb/> opportunity cost of alternative uses. Global CGE models recently have paid more attention to within-<lb/>region land productivity variation and tend to limit the competition to land with similar soil quality and<lb/> growing conditions. Some commonly used classification standards are by climate zones (boreal,<lb/> temperate, and tropical) or by agro-ecological characteristics such as Agro-Ecological Zones (AEZs).<lb/> An overview of land use in CGE models is provided by Hertel, Rose and Tol (2009). One commonly<lb/> applied structure designed to capture the imperfect mobility of land across uses within an AEZ is the<lb/> simple Constant Elasticity of Transformation (CET) function, in which an aggregate endowment of land<lb/> is transformed into different uses. The mobility of land is governed by a set of transformation parameters<lb/> that describe the responsiveness of land supply relative to returns from alternative uses. The major<lb/> problem with a CET structure is that it does not constrain the sum of actual hectares, but rather it<lb/> constrains the land rental share-weighted sum of hectares to remain constant in the aggregate. Also, this<lb/> approach does not provide an explicit link between yields and the heterogeneity of land, making it<lb/> difficult to be validated against the observed data (Hertel, Rose, and Tol 2009). An alternative approach is<lb/> represented by the AgLU model (R. Sands and Kim 2008; R. D. Sands and Leimbach 2003). AgLU<lb/> resembles a CET function in that it is subject to profit maximisation and supply response. What makes it<lb/> more appealing is the explicit modelling of yield heterogeneity and the linkage of supply response to<lb/> yield. However, AgLU is also criticised for its restrictive functional form assumption. Another approach<lb/> altogether involves the explicit modelling of conversion costs (Gurgel, Reilly, and Paltsev 2007). This<lb/> implicitly assumes that additional land can always be &apos;produced&apos; provided sufficient resources are<lb/> applied. As a consequence some kind of &apos;brake&apos; must be incorporated to prevent excessive conversion of<lb/> land in response to changing relative returns.<lb/> While the theoretical framework used to model land supply is indeed important, even more<lb/> important are the empirical estimates of land supply to which these different model structures are<lb/> calibrated. All of them seek to embody external estimates of the responsiveness of land from different<lb/> sources to a change in the relative returns to agricultural land. Yet there are very few solid estimates of<lb/> these land supply elasticities, and those that exist are typically from the more developed regions of the<lb/> world, where cropland expansion is less of a factor (<ref type="biblio">Ahmed, Hertel, and Lubowski 2008</ref>). There is an<lb/> urgent need for additional empirical work on this problem.<lb/> ENV/WKP(2016)11<lb/> 28<lb/></p>

			<head>2.6.2. Competition for water<lb/></head>

			<p>The major interest of the CGE models concerned with water centres on the role of water as a primary<lb/> production factor, although a few exceptions examine water as a tradable good or intermediate input.<lb/> Water can be incorporated into a CGE model either implicitly or explicitly. If implicitly, the model does<lb/> not control water directly, but allocates irrigated land which itself embodies water. Modelling water<lb/> explicitly is more difficult due to the lack of information on water use, its valuation and market pricing.<lb/> Different strategies have been pursued to circumvent this challenge. The global FARM model (<ref type="biblio">Darwin et<lb/> al. 1995</ref>) explicitly assigns to water a price and a value share based on estimations undertaken in the US.<lb/> <ref type="biblio">Berrittella et al. (2007)</ref> use the degree of water supply falling short of demand to signal the presence of<lb/> economic rents associated with water. Recent studies argue that an increase in yield on irrigated land must<lb/> be achieved to pay for the returns to water. Thus, the shadow price corresponding to the water constraint<lb/> should be equated to the gains driven by the yield gap between irrigated and non-irrigated production<lb/></p>

			<figure>(EPPA-IRC model by Baker, 2011; GTAP-W by Calzadilla et al., 2011; GTAP-BIO-W by Taheripour et<lb/> al., 2013a).<lb/></figure>

			<head>2.6.3. Structure of the production function<lb/></head>

			<p>In biophysically-oriented models, irrigation demand is calculated as that portion of the crop water<lb/> requirement (determined by simulation of a crop growth model) which is not satisfied by precipitation or<lb/> soil moisture (<ref type="biblio">Rosegrant et al. 2008</ref>). This is further adjusted for basin efficiency, which recognises that<lb/> not all irrigation water depletion is delivered and used in a beneficial fashion. This approach to modelling<lb/> irrigation demand requires more spatially detailed data than is typically available to global CGE<lb/> modellers. It also requires the economic model to be simulated in concert with hydrological and crop<lb/> growth models. Finally, it assumes that the full irrigation requirement is supplied to the irrigated crops –<lb/> so there is no trade-off between price and quantity consumed. All of these assumptions pose problems for<lb/> a CGE model. Therefore, an alternative approach is required.<lb/></p>

			<p>In the tradition of CGE models, irrigated agricultural production is generally represented by the<lb/> nested CES function. A very early global CGE model with water GTAP-W developed by <ref type="biblio">Berrittella et al.<lb/> (2007)</ref> has a Leontief production function, which is a special case of the CES function with zero elasticity<lb/> of substitution. Water and other inputs enter into the final output production function in fixed proportion.<lb/> Sectoral demand for water responds to a water rent, which is triggered once water supply falls short of<lb/> demand. The rent increases proportionally with the water gap.<lb/> <ref type="biblio">Calzadilla et al. (2011)</ref> revised the original GTAP-W model and adopt a more flexible three-level<lb/> CES production function. The bottom level combines land and irrigation water to produce an irrigable<lb/> land-water composite. In the middle, this composite is further combined with rainfed land and other<lb/> primary inputs to produce a value-added input composite. The final output is produced from aggregated<lb/> value-added and intermediates at the top level of the nesting. Such a multi-level nesting structure permits<lb/> differing degrees of substitutability between inputs at each layer. This model creates two pathways for<lb/> water to be reallocated between competing uses as water becomes scarce. One is to substitute other inputs<lb/> for water (a direct effect on water demand); the other is to reduce the demand for water-intensive products<lb/> (an indirect effect on water demand). However, this pioneering work has significant limitations. The<lb/> fundamental weakness is that rainfed and irrigated production are treated as part of the same aggregate,<lb/> national production function. So it is not possible to shut down irrigation in one region in favour of<lb/> rainfed agriculture, or expanding irrigation in another region. As will be discussed below, based on<lb/> experience with the TERM-H2O model in Australia, it appears to be the case that such a specification<lb/> results in an understatement of the potential for reductions in irrigated water use in the face of prolonged<lb/> drought.<lb/> ENV/WKP(2016)11<lb/> 29<lb/> A recently developed model, GTAP-BIO-W, was introduced by <ref type="biblio">Taheripour et al. (2013a)</ref>. It retains<lb/> the advantages of GTAP-W, i.e. the multi-level CES structure and irrigated/rainfed crop production, but<lb/> overcomes some of its shortcomings. The most marked difference is that GTAP-BIO-W permits<lb/> competition for resources to take place at two different levels – competition for water within river basins<lb/> and competition for land within agro-ecological zones (AEZs). This design significantly improves the<lb/> adaptability of the model. For example, the irrigated and rainfed production functions operate<lb/> independently from one another. That means irrigated crop production can be completely removed from a<lb/> certain part of the country if water supply for irrigation falls short. Moreover, in GTAP-BIO-W,<lb/> intersections between different river-basins and AEZs are featured by different technologies (i.e.<lb/> production functions) that reflect water availability, growing condition and soil quality peculiar to that<lb/> area (<ref type="figure">Figure 8</ref>).<lb/> The shadow value of water in the GTAP-BIO-W model is obtain from the higher return to land in<lb/> the irrigated sector as opposed to its rainfed counterpart. This approach is founded upon the assumption<lb/> that both sectors have the same basic cost structure for non-land inputs. This follows from the assumption<lb/> of identical input-output ratios (e.g., identical kg. nitrogen fertiliser/ton of crop output) and the same non-<lb/>land input prices. Subtracting the aggregated non-land input cost share (which is therefore equal for<lb/> rainfed and irrigation agriculture) from the total (which equals one) yields the cost share of land and water<lb/> in both sectors. Further, because output per unit of land (tons of crop/hectare) is higher when irrigation is<lb/> applied, land rent per unit of irrigated land is also higher, given the same cost share of land and water. 8<lb/> The &apos;bonus&apos; rent is then attributed to the contribution of irrigation water to total production.<lb/></p>

			<figure>Figure 8. Competition for land and water in the GTAP-BIO-W model<lb/> Source: Taheripour et al. (2013a)<lb/></figure>

			<table>8.<lb/> See the derivation in (Hertel and al., 2009).<lb/> ENV/WKP(2016)11<lb/> 30<lb/> GTAP-W, its revised version, and GTAP-BIO-W are among the few global CGE models with water<lb/> broken out. Incorporating water into a CGE framework has been more extensively explored in studies at<lb/> country and regional level (Darwin et al. 1995; Decaluwe, Patry, and Savard 1999; Dixon, Rimmer, and<lb/> Wittwer 2011; Gómez, Tirado, and Rey-Maquieira 2004; Peterson et al. 2004; van Heerden, Blignaut, and<lb/> Horridge 2008). Most of them still favor the multi-level CES structures. Reviews of these models and the<lb/> related applications can be found in Calzadilla et al. (2011), Dudu and Chumi (2008) and Ponce et al.<lb/> (2012).</table>

			<p>Here, it is useful to draw on one of these single-region studies, namely that of <ref type="biblio">Dixon et al. (2011)</ref>,<lb/> who use the TERM-H2O CGE model to examine the economy-wide impacts of a water buy-back policy<lb/> in the Murray-Darling River Basin of Australia.<lb/> <ref type="figure">Figure 9</ref> displays the key portion of a representative agricultural production in the TERM-H2O<lb/> model. Irrigated activities combine water with un-watered, irrigable land in fixed proportions to produce<lb/> irrigated land. Irrigated land substitutes for dry land (there is little of this in the irrigated sector) and un-<lb/>watered, irrigable land, which can also be used in production, albeit with much lower productivity. When<lb/> a water shortage arises, due to a temporary drought, or a permanent buy-back scheme by which the<lb/> government reduces the amount of water available for irrigation, then less irrigable land can be irrigated.<lb/> This increases the availability of un-watered, irrigable land, which is now likely to move into a dry land<lb/> sector given the prospect of rising commodity prices. The dry land sector uses no irrigated land (by<lb/> definition) but it can substitute the un-watered irrigable land for dry land, thereby expanding the area of<lb/> rainfed production.<lb/></p>

			<figure>Figure 9. Agricultural land composite in TERM-H2O<lb/> Source: Dixon et al., (2011)<lb/></figure>

			<p>It should be noted that the presence of un-watered, irrigable land in the irrigation production function<lb/> does not mean that the authors of TERM-H2O can avoid the simultaneous specification of rainfed<lb/> production sectors. Indeed, as with GTAP-BIO-W, the authors carry along in the model both rainfed and<lb/> irrigated sectors for all agricultural commodities produced in each of the model regions where irrigation is<lb/> present. However, the separate identification of currently irrigated, and potentially irrigable land, gives<lb/> their model a level of nuance which does not exist in GTAP-BIO-W. In the latter model, there are only<lb/> two types of land, with the land mobility parameter doing double-duty as a regulator of land movement as<lb/> well as irrigation preparation. In practice, obtaining separate estimates of land equipped for irrigation and<lb/> ENV/WKP(2016)11<lb/> 31<lb/> actively irrigated land, at global scale, is not currently possible. But doing so would enrich the analysis of<lb/> water scarcity.<lb/> By separating rainfed and irrigated sectors, the authors of TERM-H2O and GTAP-BIO-W increase<lb/> the dimensions of their models considerably (2x the number of irrigated sectors). This raises a natural<lb/> question: What is gained by this added dimensionality? Some valuable insights are offered in the context<lb/> of the TERM-H2O model (Glyn Wittwer 2012). Early versions of that model did not distinguish irrigated<lb/> and dry land sectors. In the context of water availability reductions due to drought, separate analyses were<lb/> undertaken and the productivity of the agricultural sectors was exogenously shocked on that basis. The<lb/> authors found that the ensuing model greatly underestimated the observed change in composition of farm<lb/> output in response to the drought. For example, in the context of a 2002-03 drought in the Murray-Darling<lb/> Basin in which total water usage in the Basin dropped by 29%, the model predicted modest declines in<lb/> rice output and water use. However, in practice, water usage for rice production dropped by 70% during<lb/> this drought! The subsequent modifications to TERM-H2O aimed to improve on this performance by<lb/> separating irrigated and dry land activities and allowing for greater factor mobility between them (Glyn<lb/> Wittwer 2012).<lb/></p>

			<head>3. WATER USE IN ENERGY PRODUCTION<lb/></head>

			<p>The role of water in energy production has been attracting considerable attention recently –<lb/> particularly in the emerging economies where energy demand has been growing most strongly. Consider,<lb/> for example, the following quote from 2014 by Rachel Kyte, then World Bank Group Vice President and<lb/> Special Envoy for Climate Change:<lb/> &quot; The world&apos;s energy and water are inextricably linked. With demand rising for both resources and<lb/> increasing challenges from climate change, water scarcity can threaten the long-term viability of<lb/> energy projects and hinder development &quot; . 9<lb/></p>

			<p>The accompanying report notes that &quot; In the past five years, more than 50% of the world&apos;s power<lb/> utility and energy companies have experienced water-related business impacts. At least two-thirds<lb/> indicate that water is a substantive risk to business operations. &quot; In India, South Africa, Australia and the<lb/> United States, power plants have recently experienced shut-downs due to water shortages for cooling<lb/> purposes.<lb/> IEA (2012) describes the main uses of water for energy production. Panel A in <ref type="figure">Figure 10</ref> shows the<lb/> ranges in water use and consumption for different technologies used in &quot; source-to-carrier &quot; primary energy<lb/> production, including withdrawal and consumption for extraction, processing and transport. The panel<lb/> clearly shows that water use in gas production is substantially lower than for other fossil fuels. Panel B<lb/> provides ranges for estimated withdrawal and consumption for electricity generation (excluding water use<lb/> for producing the input fuel). This panel shows how cooling technologies are essential for understanding<lb/> water use in electricity generation.<lb/></p>

			<p>While water is increasingly used in the extraction of fossil fuels, its main use remains in electricity<lb/> production. Hydropower is the most obvious application of water to generate electricity. However, much<lb/> of the water used to generate hydropower passes through the system and remains available for<lb/> downstream use and so it has long been thought that this source of power is not consumptive in nature.<lb/> <ref type="biblio">Meldrum et al.

			<p>that: &quot; water used for cooling of thermoelectric power plants dominates the<lb/> life cycle water use in most cases; the coal, natural gas, and nuclear fuel cycles require substantial water<lb/> per megawatt-hour in most cases; and, a substantial proportion of life cycle water use per megawatt-hour<lb/> is required for the manufacturing and construction of concentrating solar, geothermal, photovoltaic, and<lb/> wind power facilities. On the basis of the best available evidence for the evaluated technologies, total life<lb/> cycle water use appears lowest for electricity generated by photovoltaics and wind, and highest for<lb/> thermoelectric generation technologies. &quot; Therefore, attention is focused here on water for cooling in<lb/> thermoelectric power generation – with a particular emphasis on the emerging markets where most of<lb/> these new power plants are being constructed. Water use in hydropower production will also be<lb/> considered (for obvious reasons). Finally, water use for the growth and processing of biofuels has also<lb/> recently received increased attention. Each of these topics will be tackled in turn.<lb/></p>

			<head>3.1. Water use for hydropower production<lb/></head>

			<p>The revelation that hydropower production can, in some cases, result in a significant water footprint<lb/> has only recently gained traction. Indeed, in the 2011 World Congress of the International Hydropower<lb/> Association, a special session was devoted to the question: &quot; Does hydropower consume water? &quot; (M. M.<lb/> Mekonnen and Hoekstra 2011). The key point is that hydro-electric dams hold water in a reservoir from<lb/> which water subsequently evaporates. The rate of evaporation depends on the temperature, moisture<lb/> content of the air and a variety of other factors which can vary significantly by location and climate. In<lb/> their study, Mekonnen and Hoekstra (2011) use the Penman-Monteith equation to predict evaporation<lb/> losses for 35 hydropower facilities around the world. They find an average water &apos;footprint&apos; of hydro<lb/> power generation of 68 cubic meters/GJ of power generated. However, this varies greatly depending on<lb/> the size of the reservoir surface, relative to installed capacity. The smallest footprint is 0.3 cubic<lb/> meters/GJ in Colombia, and the largest is 846 cubic meters/GJ in Ghana. Overall, the 35 plants studied,<lb/> which account for just 8% of global capacity, have a water footprint of 90 Giga-cubic meters/year, which<lb/> is a very significant use of water. This is also a use which is unlikely to adjust in response to water<lb/> scarcity – short of dismantling the reservoir. Of course in those cases where the reservoir is also being<lb/> used for recreation, water supply or flood control, it is not appropriate to &apos;charge&apos; the hydropower<lb/> generation with all the attendant evaporation. In short, this is a dimension of water usage which is more<lb/> nuanced than conveyed by simple calculation of evaporative losses. Additional work will be required to<lb/> make a proper assessment of this aspect of water consumption by the power sector.<lb/></p>

			<p>Implications for CGE modelling: Expansion of hydro-power in the future will depend on a host of<lb/> factors, including, suitable sites for such plants, the cost of fossil fuels and conventional power generated<lb/> based on fossil fuels, and, perhaps most significantly, environmental considerations. Construction of a<lb/> new hydro-power facility is inherently a &apos;lumpy&apos; decision, with large elements of irreversibility. For this<lb/> reason, hydro-power is likely to be scenario-driven – as opposed to a continuously variable response to<lb/> future developments in energy prices. From the point of view of water scarcity and economic growth, it is<lb/> critical to factor in the potential losses from evaporation under future scenarios involving significant<lb/> additions to (or subtractions from) hydro-power. Such estimates could be computed endogenously using<lb/> the Penman-Monteith equation, as in <ref type="biblio">Mekonnen and Hoekstra (2011)</ref>, provided the underlying<lb/> biophysical data are available, or, more practically, one could map any new facilities to the set of 35<lb/> facilities for which such calculations have already been done in order to get an idea of how this will likely<lb/> affect water availability downstream from the facility.<lb/></p>

			<head>3.2. Water consumption by conventional power plants<lb/></head>

			<p>Rapid economic growth in many developing countries is contributing to significant growth in the<lb/> demand for electricity, so this source of water demand is projected to greatly increase in the coming<lb/> decades. And it is mainly with the construction of new facilities that opportunities for significant water<lb/> ENV/WKP(2016)11<lb/> 34<lb/> conservation arise. Therefore, the focus here is on emerging markets. <ref type="biblio">Mitra and Bhattacharya (2012)<lb/></ref> project that conventional power generation could boost its claim on total utilisable water in India from 4%<lb/> in 2010 to 20% in 2050. Since it is the choice of technique for new power plants which offers the greatest<lb/> scope for improved water use efficiency (once the plant is built, there is little scope for modification), this<lb/> section focuses on water consumption by conventional power plants in those emerging markets where<lb/> rapid growth in demand and increasing water scarcity appear to be setting the stage for a perfect storm.<lb/> India presents a particularly interesting case since it has been growing relatively rapidly and it is<lb/> destined to become the most populous country in the world (UN Population Division 2013). In response<lb/> to this rapid growth, India is expected to add considerably to its capacity for producing electric power in<lb/> the coming decades. This is important, due to the near irreversibility of conventional power generation<lb/> technologies. If India chooses a water efficient path for its new power generation capacity, this could<lb/> greatly reduce future water requirements in this sector. Bhattacharya and Bijon (2013) estimate that<lb/> simply by switching from the open loop wet cooling systems favoured historically to a more efficient,<lb/> closed loop system, India could reduce its requirements from 20% to just 7.5% of total utilisable water.<lb/> These potential water savings are a concrete manifestation of the potential for capital-water substitution of<lb/> the sort discussed in the overview section of this report. By investing more in the new technology, very<lb/> significant water savings can be achieved. However, these large gains are only economical if they are<lb/> designed in when the plant is built.<lb/> About two-thirds of the water use by a typical coal-fired thermal power plant in India is for cooling<lb/> purposes (<ref type="biblio">Bhattacharya and Bijon 2013</ref>). The remaining uses for water include: ash-handling (25%) and<lb/> service and potable water (5%), together with a few residual uses. Focusing on water for cooling, turn to<lb/> <ref type="figure">Figure 10</ref>, taken from Bhattacharya and <ref type="biblio">Bijon (2013)</ref>, which outlines the cooling technologies available<lb/> to those investing in electric power generation capacity in India today. As those authors point out, new<lb/> open loop (once-through) cooling technologies, which return the water to its source following its use as a<lb/> coolant, have been banned since 1999. So, while some are still in use, this is no longer an option for new<lb/> plants. Of the closed loop systems, there are two main alternatives: wet and dry cooling. The wet cooling<lb/> technology circulates water in a cooling tower where evaporation occurs, resulting in cooling of the<lb/> circulated water. The dry cooling systems rely on air circulation to cool the water so that they avoid the<lb/> evaporative losses associated with the wet cooling system. This results in very large reductions in water<lb/> requirements.<lb/></p>

			<p>Implications for CGE modelling: In order to capture the key aspects of water use in electric power<lb/> generation described above, there are two critical requirements in a CGE model. The first is a distinction<lb/> between old and new capital – often described as a &apos;putty-clay&apos; model. In the case of the existing power<lb/></p>

			<table>Natural draft<lb/> Cooling<lb/> technologies<lb/> Open loop<lb/> Closed loop<lb/> Wet cooling<lb/> Dry cooling<lb/> Hybrid<lb/> system<lb/> Induced<lb/> draft<lb/> Direct<lb/> Indirect<lb/> Natural draft<lb/> Induced<lb/> draft<lb/> ENV/WKP(2016)11<lb/> 35<lb/> plant infrastructure, there is little that can be done to conserve water use. However, for new power plants,<lb/> modest increases in capital expenditures can result in significant water savings, as one moves from open<lb/> to closed loop systems and from wet to dry cooling technologies. Using the estimates taken from<lb/> Bhattacharya and Bijon (2013), <ref type="figure">Figure 11</ref> is created which shows a marginal cost of abatement schedule<lb/> to which a CGE model could readily be calibrated. This schedule passes through two points (wet cooling<lb/> and dry cooling), exhibits the desired convex structure, and could include an asymptote reflecting the<lb/> physical limits on water conservation in such a power plant.<lb/></p>

			<p>Given the cost shares of capital and water in the initial data base, one can choose the elasticity of<lb/> substitution between capital and water to mirror this abatement cost curve. (This is most readily achieved<lb/> by simulating the CES function in &apos;partial equilibrium&apos; mode, i.e. as a cost minimisation problem, with<lb/> output level and input prices fixed. See <ref type="biblio">Golub et al. (2009)</ref> for examples in the context of GHG<lb/> mitigation costs.) In this way, as water becomes scarce, the model will capture endogenous switching to<lb/> greater water use efficiency. Of course, at the plant level this is a discrete choice and therefore will not<lb/> resemble <ref type="figure">Figure 11</ref>. However, the continuum of possibilities shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 11</ref> is more appropriate<lb/> given the distribution of power plants in India – some using the old technologies and some using the new<lb/> technologies. It is also likely that any adoption will not occur all at once. Indeed, this technology choice is<lb/> really only possible when new plants are being built. Given the shape of the curve in <ref type="figure">Figure 11</ref>, it appears<lb/> that very substantial gains in water use efficiency are available at modest cost in the electric power sector<lb/> in India. For this reason, trend projections based on current water intensities are surely overly pessimistic<lb/> and not very useful for serious economic analysis.<lb/></p>

			<head>3.3. Water for biofuels<lb/></head>

			<p>The most important contribution of water to the production of biofuels is through the production of<lb/> the feedstock. <ref type="biblio">Gerbens-Leenes et al. (2009)</ref> explore the water footprint of biofuels for transportation<lb/> under the IEA&apos;s Alternative Policy Scenario. By current standards, this looks like a high-end scenario,<lb/> with 11% of global energy consumption in 2030 supplied by bioenergy. Bioenthanol and biodiesel<lb/> dominate the IEA projections, with USA and Brazil leading ethanol consumption in 2030, followed by<lb/> China and then Germany. Biodiesel consumption is led by Malaysia, followed by USA, France and<lb/> China, in that order. Overall, this scenario appears to be more indicative of the biofuels boom years of<lb/> 2006 – 2011 than of the current era, which is characterised by waning interest in biofuels in the EU and<lb/> the USA where mandates are being rolled back in light of flat prices for fossil fuels and growing<lb/> environmental concerns about biofuels. Nonetheless, the calculations by <ref type="biblio">Geerbens-Leenes et al. (2009)<lb/></ref> are instructive, and, given the right combination of high oil prices and climate regulation, this scenario<lb/> could once again become likely. Based on this IEA scenario, the authors find that biofuels could boost<lb/> their blue water footprint from 0.5% of available blue water worldwide to 5.5% of available water by<lb/> 2030. This tenfold increase is quite striking and reflects a strong utilisation of irrigation assumed by the<lb/> authors.<lb/></p>

			<head>3.4. Implications for CGE modelling<lb/></head>

			<p>Unlike the study by <ref type="biblio">Geerbens-Leenes et al. (2009)</ref>, global CGE models offer the possibility to<lb/> endogenise production, consumption and trade in biofuels. If future oil prices remain flat, and biofuel<lb/> mandates are reduced, then the amount of feedstock required for biofuels in 2030 may be very modest.<lb/> This, in turn, will reduce the blue water footprint of biofuels. Similarly, by endogenising the choice of<lb/> technique for production of the feedstocks, a CGE model can allow the extent of irrigation to be<lb/> determined by the model as a function of future water scarcity, as well as competition for land with food<lb/> crops. Therefore, to capture the water footprint of biofuels, the main requirement is to do a good job<lb/> modelling crop production, including the irrigation choice, as well as the competition between biofuels<lb/> and petroleum in the transportation sector which will ultimately determine the penetration of biofuels in<lb/> this sector.<lb/></p>

			<head>4. RESIDENTIAL DEMAND FOR WATER<lb/></head>

			<p>When compared to other sectors, the residential demand for water in industrialised countries is<lb/> relatively well understood. This is due in large part to the ready availability of data on quantity consumed<lb/> and pricing of water from public utilities. Water use by households is highly seasonal, with outdoor water<lb/> requirements peaking in the summer, and during the times of day/week, when household members are at<lb/> home (Parker and Wilby 2013). So the challenge, as with electric utilities, is to design a system to meet<lb/> these peak demands.<lb/></p>

			<head>4.1. Residential Demand in Industrialised Economies<lb/></head>

			<p>Residential demand for water can be broken into indoor and outdoor demand. Outdoor demand for<lb/> water is quite sensitive to the type of landscape in place, and there is often great scope for reducing this<lb/> type of water use, as currently observed in California. The three most important end uses of indoor water<lb/> ENV/WKP(2016)11<lb/> 37<lb/> are toilets, showers and washers (<ref type="biblio">Mayer and DeOreo 1999</ref>) and some studies focus specifically on these<lb/> end uses. <ref type="biblio">Lee et al. (2011)</ref> examine the impact of water conservation practices in Miami-Dade county on<lb/> these and other household end uses of water and find that this program, which focused on getting high<lb/> efficiency appliances into households had a very significant impact on household water consumption.<lb/> This suggests that the price elasticity of demand for household water consumption is likely significant –<lb/> as households appear to have considerable scope for achieving water conservation, given sufficient<lb/> economic incentive. Due to the high level of aggregation in CGE models, this kind of summary measure<lb/> of price response will be more useful than end-use specific information. Therefore, it is useful to review<lb/> the evidence on the price elasticity of demand for water in residential use.<lb/></p>

			<p>There are now a large number of published econometric studies of the price elasticity of demand for<lb/> water in residential use. <ref type="biblio">Griffin (2006)</ref> summarises the results of these studies in the following histogram,<lb/> which reports the number of estimates falling within each range. (He first eliminates the outliers.) The<lb/> average of these estimates is -0.38, with a most likely range between -0.35 and -0.45. Griffin also<lb/> distinguishes between short and long run responses – the latter factoring in households&apos; capital stock<lb/> response to sustained price changes. After examining the literature, he suggests adding 0.2 to 0.3 points to<lb/> the elasticity to account for these long run changes. This gives a long run (capital stock fully adjusted)<lb/> household price elasticity of demand for water of -0.55 to -0.75.<lb/></p>

			<figure>Figure 13.<lb/> Distribution of estimates of residential price elasticity of demand for water (number of<lb/> estimates falling within a given interval)<lb/> Source: Griffin (2006)<lb/></figure>

			<head>4.2. Residential Demand in Developing Economies<lb/></head>

			<p>While residential water demand in the industrialised countries is reasonably well understood, the<lb/> same cannot be said of household water demand in the developing countries. This is due to the fact that,<lb/> in low income countries, households have access to multiple sources of water, including tap water, wells,<lb/> water vendors, tanker trucks, rainwater and surface water collected from streams, etc. (<ref type="biblio">Nauges and<lb/> Whittington 2012</ref>). Thus it is unclear what price the household actually pays for the water (much of the<lb/> cost may be attributable to labour) and the quantity consumed is also much more difficult to measure than<lb/> in the industrialised countries.<lb/> <ref type="biblio">Nauges and Whittington (2012)</ref> suggest dividing consumers in developing countries into three broad<lb/> groups for purposes of demand analysis. The first group comprises the emerging middle class and upper<lb/> income urban residents, who have, or will soon have, access to indoor tap water and therefore are likely to<lb/> ENV/WKP(2016)11<lb/> 38<lb/> be moving in the direction of industrialised country demands. The second group comprises the slum<lb/> dwellers who have inadequate water and sewerage services and obtain their water from a variety of<lb/> sources. In this case, it may be a long time before they have access to municipal water services and so<lb/> public sector pricing of water is likely to have less impact on them. Key factors in their consumption<lb/> decisions will likely be the opportunity cost of their time, as well as the price charged by private water<lb/> vendors. The third group are the rural poor, who are generally underserved and also often the object of<lb/> misguided, large scale water projects which are costly and deliver services which rural households often<lb/> don&apos;t want and can&apos;t maintain (Nauges and Whittington 2012).<lb/> While estimation of water demand in the context of developing countries is extremely challenging,<lb/> Nauges and Whittington (2012) conclude their survey by suggesting that &quot; most estimates of own-price<lb/> elasticity of water from private connections are in the ranges from -0.3 to -0.6, close to what is usually<lb/> reported for industrialised countries &quot; (p.264). Those authors conclude their survey by highlighting the<lb/> need to understand the potential role of dual use networks – one network for drinking water and one for<lb/> low-quality uses.<lb/></p>

			<head>4.3. Implications for CGE modelling<lb/></head>

			<p>In principle, it is relatively straightforward to incorporate existing estimates of the price elasticity of<lb/> the residential demand for water into a CGE model. To do so, one needs a functional form with sufficient<lb/> flexibility to accommodate this information. The Constant Difference in Elasticities expenditure function<lb/> is one such option (<ref type="biblio">Hanoch 1975</ref>). In this case one would like to calibrate the model to match the long run<lb/> price elasticity of demand if the goal was to undertake long run growth analysis. The CDE functional<lb/> form has been successfully employed in the GTAP model over the past two decades (<ref type="biblio">Hertel 1997</ref>).<lb/> As an alternative, or perhaps in addition to the specification of a household consumption response to<lb/> water prices, it could be useful to treat water consumption as part of a household production function. In<lb/> this case, residential consumers would invest in household appliances – with attendant implications for<lb/> energy and water use efficiency, and then consume the services supplied by this capital stock. In the<lb/> context of a putty-clay model, such a specification would allow for incorporation of the distinction<lb/> between short and long run demand responses to water price changes highlighted by Griffin. In the short<lb/> run there would be limited substitutability between water and other consumption items, but in the long<lb/> run appliance choice (household capital stock replacement) would have a more profound impact on water<lb/> conservation.<lb/></p>

			<p>Another important lesson from this review is the potential value of disaggregating households in<lb/> developing countries. As Nauges and Whittington (2012) point out, rural and urban households have very<lb/> different water consumption requirements and the supply of that water has quite different characteristics.<lb/> Therefore, as demographic change occurs, and the mix of rural and urban households evolves, so too, will<lb/> the characteristics of aggregate residential demand for water. Breaking out the third group (slum dwellers)<lb/> would likely be more challenging. Another possibility would be to have a separate module outside of the<lb/> CGE model which can be used to develop long term projections of household water use and provide an<lb/> overall summary measure of price response for use in the CGE model. Once the model solution is<lb/> obtained, one could return to the water consumption module to deduce the impact on rural and urban<lb/> households.<lb/> ENV/WKP(2016)11<lb/> 39<lb/></p>

			<head>5. COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL DEMAND FOR WATER<lb/> 5.1. Commercial water demand<lb/></head>

			<p>As noted by <ref type="biblio">Griffin (2006)</ref>, industrial and commercial water demand is much less intensively studied<lb/> than residential demand. In the case of commercial demand, while these establishments generally obtain<lb/> their water from a public utility, the heterogeneity of operations makes estimation of demand difficult in<lb/> this case. By way of example, Kim and McCuen (1979) highlight the importance of gross store area,<lb/> length of display windows and drinking fountains in predicting commercial water use. This is a level of<lb/> detail that is not available to global CGE modellers. Furthermore, even this detailed study did not include<lb/> estimates of price response. Yet, the rapid growth of the service sector means that it will become<lb/> increasingly important in overall water use and so its economic behaviour in the face of water scarcity<lb/> will become increasingly significant. Lacking further information, it seems most reasonable to adapt price<lb/> elasticities of demand from residential use, as many of the same appliances will be important in<lb/> commercial use.<lb/></p>

			<head>5.2. Industrial water demand<lb/></head>

			<p>In the case of industrial demand, the challenge lies in the fact that factories are often &apos;self-supplied&apos;,<lb/> investing in their own infrastructure to access surface or ground water for use in their production<lb/> processes. Therefore, water use is not monitored, and the relevant price for the water consumed is<lb/> unobserved. In addition, much of the industrial demand is used for cooling purposes, so that the water<lb/> flows through the facility and is potentially available for other, downstream uses. Thus it is common in<lb/> global simulation models to omit the price responsiveness of industrial water demand altogether, as in the<lb/> IMPACT-WATER model (<ref type="biblio">Mark W. Rosegrant et al. 2008</ref>).<lb/> When it comes to consumptive uses, many different production processes rely on some form of<lb/> steam. Masanet and <ref type="biblio">Walker (2013)</ref> investigate in detail the opportunities for reducing steam requirements<lb/> – which has the great advantage of also reducing energy requirements (since energy is required to convert<lb/> water to steam) – in the major steam-using sectors of the manufacturing economy: chemicals, paper,<lb/> petroleum refining and food production. They find ample opportunities for harvesting &apos;low-hanging fruit&apos;<lb/> and significantly reducing energy and water usage in these sectors through more efficient use of steam in<lb/> manufacturing.<lb/></p>

			<p>What these more efficient engineering processes imply for price responsiveness of the sector is a<lb/> more challenging question. The approach to demand analysis in the case of industrial use is often through<lb/> mathematical programming of the industrial operation (<ref type="biblio">Griffin 2006</ref>). Such studies may or may not report<lb/> the implied price elasticity of demand. <ref type="biblio">Griffin (2006)</ref> has compiled the following table for industrial and<lb/> commercial price elasticities of demand, based on the work of Renzetti (2002a). For purposes of CGE<lb/> modelling, the most appealing estimates are those undertaken at the two-digit SIC level which range from<lb/> -0.15 to -0.59 (see also <ref type="biblio">Renzetti (1992)</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<head>5.3. Implications for CGE modelling<lb/></head>

			<p>It is relatively straightforward to &apos;nest&apos; water in a CES production function in order to elicit a given,<lb/> output-constant demand response to water prices. A key question is: how should this nesting be done? In<lb/> many cases conservation of industrial water also results in conservation of energy, suggesting that for<lb/> some industries these two inputs might be bundled together. And much like energy conservation,<lb/> improved water efficiency is typically obtained through capital investments. Therefore, nesting water with<lb/> capital, much as is currently done in energy-oriented CGE models makes sense. Furthermore, allowing<lb/> some differentiation between short run (clay) and long run (putty) responses would seem appropriate.<lb/> ENV/WKP(2016)11<lb/> 40<lb/></p>

			<head>6. ENVIRONMENTAL DEMANDS<lb/></head>

			<p>It is widely recognised in the water modelling literature that environmental uses of water are of<lb/> critical importance and that outcomes such as biodiversity, depend not only on the total volume of water,<lb/> but also on the timing and magnitude of high and low flow events (<ref type="biblio">Bell et al. 2014</ref>). These can include<lb/> both in-stream uses, as well as out-of-stream diversion of water into wetlands. However, the portion of<lb/> river flow to be set aside for environmental requirements varies greatly across studies, ranging from 10%<lb/> in the case of IMPACT-WATER (Mark W. Rosegrant and The IMPACT Development Team 2012) to as<lb/> much as 50% in the IWMI analysis of <ref type="biblio">Smakhtin et al. (2004)</ref>. The latter team of authors argue that &quot; the<lb/> services that freshwater ecosystems provide to humans … are worth trillions of US dollars annually &quot; .<lb/> They go on to estimate the global distribution of Ecological Water Requirements (EWR) as a percentage<lb/> of long term mean annual river flow, and this is reproduced in <ref type="figure">Figure 13</ref>. They acknowledge that this<lb/> calculation is extremely simplistic and that much more information must be brought to bear before<lb/> measures which can inform management decisions are brought to bear at global scale.<lb/></p>

			<p>Implications for CGE Modelling: From a CGE modelling perspective, it would be attractive to move<lb/> beyond the current approach in which some, apparently arbitrary, percentage of stream flow is set aside as<lb/> an environmental reserve. A natural way to begin to incorporate the trade-off between environmental<lb/> quality and the consumption of other goods and services would be to bring these environmental services<lb/> into the utility function. One approach, taken by <ref type="biblio">Tsigas et al. (2001)</ref> involves specifying a total<lb/> endowment of environmental quality (in this case, that obtained from maximum stream flow) and then<lb/> accounting for the use of some of this environmental good (stream flow) for other purposes. What<lb/> remains is &apos;consumed&apos; by households as an in-stream use of the water. In the initial equilibrium, this in-<lb/>stream use may not be priced – but rather provided by the government as part of its public services. This<lb/> specification allows for explicit competition between environmental and commercial uses of water and<lb/> captures the welfare benefits of improved environmental quality as some of the water is left in-stream for<lb/> environmental &apos;consumption&apos; by households. However, the implementation challenge for such extensions<lb/> is to properly parameterise the utility function. Further empirical work will be required before such<lb/> approaches will be widely accepted.<lb/></p>

			<head>7. WATER SUPPLY AND ALLOCATION<lb/> 7.1. Reuse of water<lb/></head>

			<p>Water is rarely fully consumed in its various uses. Rather, some of the water withdrawn for a<lb/> particular use is released and becomes a candidate for re-cycling and reuse. <ref type="biblio">Seckler et al. (1998)</ref> conclude<lb/> their report on the future of water supply and demand by suggesting that water reuse may be one of the<lb/> most important sources of water supply in the coming decades. One of the main barriers to water reuse is<lb/> pollution, which can build up rapidly as water is recycled. Therefore, the authors emphasise (p. 18) that<lb/> &quot; pollution control is one of the most basic ways of increasing water supply &quot; . In contrast, they find that, at<lb/> the time of their writing (1998), most international data sets &quot; simply assumed that once water is<lb/> withdrawn it is lost to further use &quot; . This clearly leads to an understatement of water availability.<lb/> <ref type="biblio">Luckman et al. (2014)</ref> take account of water reuse in their analysis of water shortages in Israel. Their<lb/> modelling of reuse suggests a useful way forward for incorporating this aspect of water into a global CGE<lb/> model. A first step is that, rather than having just one type of water, one must distinguish multiple types,<lb/> of which only one is freshwater. The other types relate to joint products of water-using sectors. Thus the<lb/> residential sector might produce a type of effluent which, after suitable processing, might be reused as<lb/> potable water, or perhaps water suitable for irrigation. Given their research on Israel, those authors also<lb/> consider seawater as an input to the desalinisation industry, which, in turn produces potable water. They<lb/> also include brackish groundwater in their model, which is suitable for some uses. In short, adding more<lb/> types of water to reflect these differing qualities and allowing sectors to draw on, and add to, these<lb/> different water resources, as appropriate, results in a much richer treatment of the resource. <ref type="biblio">Luckman et<lb/> al. (2014)</ref> find that the intensities of use of these different types of water vary greatly across sectors, and,<lb/> in many cases, they substitute in use. Thus when freshwater supplies are restricted, there is some potential<lb/> for shifting to other types of water, albeit at higher cost. In their study, they consider the impacts of<lb/> ENV/WKP(2016)11<lb/> 42<lb/> reducing freshwater availability by 50%, with desalinisation as one option for bridging some of the<lb/> ensuing shortfall. Due to its high cost, the provision of desalinisation in this case does little to mitigate the<lb/> negative outcomes of the water shortfall.<lb/></p>

			<head>7.2. Economy-wide water Supply<lb/></head>

			<p>As previously noted, in the IMPACT-WATER model, surface water availability is determined by<lb/> runoff within the river basin, as well as inflow from the upstream basins (<ref type="biblio">Rosegrant et al., 2012</ref>). In<lb/> deference to environmental, ecological and navigational needs, only a portion of this total surface water<lb/> flow is available to agricultural, residential, commercial and industrial demands. Groundwater availability<lb/> is dictated exogenously based on historic pumping rates and potential groundwater sources and recharge<lb/> rates. A storage model is used to smooth out water consumption at monthly duration. How should water<lb/> supply be handled in the context of a global CGE model?<lb/> A first question is that of regional detail. How much is required? Clearly more detail is better, as<lb/> acute water shortages tend to be seasonal and local. But at some point the costs of disaggregation exceed<lb/> the benefits. <ref type="figure">Figure 14</ref> taken from Liu et al. (2014) sheds some useful light on this question. This maps<lb/> the world&apos;s major river basins and colour codes them according to projected water scarcity for irrigation<lb/> in 2030. These results are taken from the IMPACT-WATER model (Mark W. <ref type="biblio">Rosegrant et al. 2013</ref>) in<lb/> which irrigation is the residual claimant on water use, so this index of water availability is a good<lb/> indicator of overall water scarcity in the river basin. The first point to note is that water scarcity is not a<lb/> global phenomenon; rather, it is concentrated in certain regions. Furthermore, these regions do not<lb/> necessarily coincide with national boundaries. In China, for example, the northeast shows significant<lb/> water scarcity, but the Southeast does not. Similarly, the impacts in South Asia are also markedly<lb/> different within the sub-regional boundaries. In short, it appears to be quite important that water supplies<lb/> be modelled at the river basin level, as opposed to the national scale, as might normally be done in a<lb/> global CGE model.<lb/></p>

			<p>ENV/WKP(2016)11<lb/> 43<lb/> A second question which arises in the context of CGE modelling of water scarcity and economic<lb/> growth is whether or not to model the hydrological processes underpinning water supply. Since<lb/> &apos;unassisted&apos; water naturally flows downhill, a &apos;flow routing model&apos; is required to understand how<lb/> different users are spatially connected with supplies. However, it is common in economic models to use<lb/> the &apos;tank modelling&apos; approach in which routing is ignored (<ref type="biblio">Bell et al. 2014</ref>). In our opinion, this is better<lb/> left outside the model, with hydrological experts producing estimates of water availability at the river<lb/> basin level. Of course, these estimates will depend to some degree on growth rates in the global economy,<lb/> and these assumptions should be synchronised between the two models.<lb/> Once overall water availability at the river basin level has been determined, there remains the<lb/> question of how this water gets supplied to users. Residential, commercial, and, to some extent industrial<lb/> users in the typical industrialised economy will obtain their water from a municipal utility. The municipal<lb/> supply of water to these sectors can be modelled via a production function of the usual sort. The cost<lb/> shares for this activity should be available from the national input-output table or social accounting<lb/> matrix. Valuing the water input into this public utility will be a challenge, and will ultimately require an<lb/> assumption about the price of water in the region. This &apos;raw water&apos; input may come from either surface<lb/> water or ground water and its overall availability will be derived from the hydrological model.<lb/> A further challenge for CGE models is how to spatially allocate the non-agricultural water uses.<lb/> Distributing manufacturing and service activities across river basins globally would present a major<lb/> challenge. Therefore, it is probably easiest to simply require that non-agricultural demands at the river<lb/> basin scale move in fixed proportion to national activity levels, so these can be viewed as inputs into the<lb/> single, national production function.<lb/> Finally, there is the question of how to model ground water and surface water supplies. <ref type="biblio">Diao et al.<lb/> (2008)</ref> seek to model the conjunctive use to ground and surface water supplies in the context of a CGE<lb/> model of the Moroccan economy. They point out that ground water has a clear buffering value when<lb/> surface water supplies are uncertain and that it is important to incorporate both ground and surface water<lb/> as distinct sources of water supply into any economy-wide analysis.<lb/></p>

			<p>In the context of a recursive-dynamic analysis, the supply of surface water to agriculture will depend<lb/> on pre-existing investments in reservoirs, canals and delivery systems which can be reflected with the<lb/> presence of a fixed factor in the supply function describing the transformation of raw water into irrigated<lb/> water. Groundwater supplies are largely dependent on energy costs, which will increase as the depth of<lb/> groundwater wells increases. The supply of groundwater to agricultural irrigation can be modelled using a<lb/> production function which combines capital, labour and energy with the ground water endowment. As<lb/> this endowment is drawn down, the effect on costs can be simulated as non-water, input-using adverse<lb/> technical change, so that to deliver the same amount of irrigation, more inputs are required. The stock of<lb/> groundwater will be a function of pumping as well as the rate of recharge. Calculation of the latter will<lb/> require use of a hydrological model and will therefore need to be done outside the CGE model. Given the<lb/> differing characteristics of water supplied from surface and ground sources, and in the absence of a more<lb/> elaborate model of conjunctive use, it is appealing to treat these two sources of water as imperfect<lb/> substitutes in the irrigation production function, as proposed by Sue-Wing and Lanzi (2014).<lb/></p>

			<head>7.3. Allocation across sectors<lb/></head>

			<p>In the physical science literature, research related to the themes of water availability and allocation<lb/> aspects usually leans heavily on hydrological modelling (e.g. the LPJmL model by <ref type="biblio">Gerten et al. (2004)</ref>,<lb/> CLIRUN-II by <ref type="biblio">Strzepek et al. (2011)</ref> and WGHM by <ref type="biblio">Döll et al. (2003)</ref>) or water management models<lb/> (e.g. GCWM by Siebert and Döll (2010) and IWSM by <ref type="biblio">Zhu et al. (2013)</ref>). The common interest shared<lb/> by this community is the quantity (and sometimes quality) of water resource. The economic literature,<lb/> ENV/WKP(2016)11<lb/> 44<lb/> however, provides a different perspective that focuses more on the value of water. In many ways the<lb/> modelling of water demands supplies is no more challenging than many of the other demand and supply<lb/> relationships in the economy. The real challenge in modelling water has to do with determining its<lb/> allocation across uses. As pointed out by Olmstead (2013) water is not typically allocated through<lb/> markets. Even in OECD countries, a wide diversity of water allocation regimes are applied (OECD,<lb/> 2015b). This poses a challenge for modellers. For example, in the IMPACT-WATER model (<ref type="biblio">Rosegrant et<lb/> al., 2012</ref>), water is allocated in a sequential fashion, with residential needs satisfied first, followed by<lb/> industrial and livestock demands. Irrigation needs are treated as a residual claimant on available water.<lb/> This seems most appropriate in the short-to medium term.<lb/></p>

			<p>Olmstead (2013) emphasises the importance of thinking carefully about how the institutions<lb/> governing water allocations will respond to water scarcity. And for this, some knowledge of the<lb/> underlying institutions and associated allocation rules is required. She identifies the following<lb/> institutional adaptations which could be beneficial in the context of increasing water shortages: legal<lb/> changes to water rights regimes, water banking, leasing and marketing, negotiated transfers, investment in<lb/> infrastructure for storage (transfer across time) and transport (transfers across space) of water, and last,<lb/> but not least --water pricing. Such institutional changes become more likely over the long run.<lb/></p>

			<figure>From a policy perspective, water variability may be an even more relevant driver of the link with<lb/> economic growth than absolute scarcity (OECD, 2015c). This also affects the perspective on policy issues<lb/> ranging from infrastructure design to water allocation regimes; OECD (2015b) provides a useful health<lb/> checklist on this topic.<lb/></figure>

			<p>Where water is allocated on the basis of historical rights and political influence, very large price<lb/> differentials can emerge across sectors. Olmstead (2013) notes that water prices in the neighbourhood of<lb/> Tucson, Arizona vary from USD 27/acre-foot for agriculture to as much as USD 3,200/acre-foot in urban<lb/> uses. While some of this can be explained by the nature and quality of the product being delivered, most<lb/> of this hundred-fold difference is a function of institutions which do not allocate water based on economic<lb/> criteria. In discussion of the treatment of water in Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs), she suggests<lb/> undertaking a sort of &apos;bounding analysis&apos; wherein one set of simulations is conducted assuming no<lb/> change in allocation rules, while another might assume perfect adaptation. Of course, given the size of<lb/> these distortions, one suspects that the impact of reforming the institutions leading to these perverse<lb/> allocation rules will have a much larger impact than will the anticipated water scarcity itself.<lb/></p>

			<p>The prospect of water scarcity creating incentives for the reform of water allocation rules and<lb/> institutions is an intriguing prospect when it comes to the impact of water scarcity on economic growth.<lb/> <ref type="biblio">Olmstead (2013)</ref> suggests that &quot; while water prices, on the whole, do not seem to be higher in more arid<lb/> regions, water marketing is more prevalent in arid regions. In a Coasian sense, the mere existence of the<lb/> potential gains from trading water creates pressure for trade to occur, so long as the property rights are<lb/> clearly assigned. &quot; In Chile, Australia and the Western US, water trading has evolved in direct response to<lb/> scarcity (<ref type="biblio">Olmstead 2013</ref>). The National Water Code established in Chile in 1981 separated water rights<lb/> from land rights and allowed the water rights to be traded. The response has been significant in the north-<lb/>Central region (<ref type="biblio">Bauer 2004</ref>). In Australia, water trading was introduced over the course of three decades,<lb/> beginning in 1983 with South Australia. This appears to have generated positive economic responses in<lb/> the form of increased &apos;value per drop&apos; through more efficient technologies and a shift to higher value<lb/> crops (<ref type="biblio">Bjornlund and McKay 2002</ref>).<lb/> The idea that agriculture is likely to be the sector relinquishing water in the presence of future<lb/> scarcity is further underscored in the study by McKinsey and Company which compiled a marginal cost<lb/> of water availability schedule for the Indian economy. This is portrayed in <ref type="figure">Figure 15</ref> which identifies<lb/> water conservation measures in agriculture, industry and residential/commercial uses, along with potential<lb/> supply-enhancing measures which could help to close the projected gap between water requirements and<lb/> ENV/WKP(2016)11<lb/> 45<lb/> available supplies in 2030. The first thing to note is the predominance of agricultural conservation<lb/> measures at the lower end of this cost curve. Indeed, one-third of the projected deficit in 2030 comprises<lb/> &apos;no regrets&apos; policies – changes in behaviour which will actually save money! These include the<lb/> introduction of no-till farming, reducing over-irrigation and optimising the use of fertiliser on irrigated<lb/> fields. About two-thirds of the gap can be closed with agricultural adaptations with modest cost (less than<lb/> USD 0.02/cubic meter, such as drip irrigation, and improved management of irrigated crops. In order to<lb/> fully close the projected gap of more than 700 billion cubic meters in 2030, some supply measures are<lb/> envisioned, including improving infrastructure in the &apos;last mile&apos; of delivery and the development of small<lb/> scale supply infrastructure. Conservation measures in municipal and domestic use are far more costly and<lb/> therefore unlikely to come into the optimal mix of policies.<lb/></p>

			<figure>Figure 16.<lb/> Cost of increasing water availability in India in 2030 through conservation and supply<lb/> considerations<lb/> Source: Reproduced from McKinsey &amp; Co. (2009)<lb/></figure>

			<p>Of course, any time water is withdrawn from agriculture, there will likely be adverse rural impacts,<lb/> unless households and communities are compensated for the loss of these implicit subsidies. In their<lb/> analysis of intersectoral water competition in South Africa, Hassan and Thurlow (2011) find that a policy<lb/> scenario in which water is allowed to move to higher value uses in the urban, industrial and domestic<lb/> sectors reduces rural incomes and employment – particularly for the poorest households. Clearly such<lb/> reforms must be accompanied by some form of compensation, decoupled from water use, if adverse<lb/> income distributional consequences are to be avoided.<lb/></p>

			<head>7.4. Implications for CGE Modelling<lb/></head>

			<p>Given the dominant role of irrigation in total water withdrawals in the arid regions of the world, and<lb/> given the extremely low price charged for this water in most cases, it seems logical that agriculture is<lb/> likely to absorb a large share of future water deficits. This suggests a baseline modelling strategy akin to<lb/> that of the IMPACT-WATER group in which non-agricultural water use is determined based on projected<lb/> economic growth and municipal water pricing policies. After running the hydrological model to<lb/> determine availability at the river basin level, agriculture might be forced to adjust to any ensuing<lb/> ENV/WKP(2016)11<lb/> 46<lb/> scarcity. This baseline scenario could be contrasted with an efficient allocation scenario in which the price<lb/> of raw water is equated across sectors.<lb/></p>

			<p>There are several important issues which a global CGE analysis is likely to have great difficulty in<lb/> addressing. One of these has to do with return flows. Industrial water is often discharged into streams and<lb/> rivers. Irrigation water not lost through evapotranspiration may recharge aquifers or add to surface water<lb/> availability. Proper analysis of these return flows requires considerable spatial detail. And subsequent use<lb/> of these return flows may require water treatment, in which case one needs to worry about water quality,<lb/> not just quantity. Studies which ignore the potential for recycling of water, invariably underestimate water<lb/> supply. <ref type="biblio">Luckman et al. (2014)</ref> make a good start at dealing with reuse by differentiating between seven<lb/> different types of water, some of which are naturally occurring endowments, some of which are outputs<lb/> and some of which are by-products of individual sectors. Of course, finding the data to underpin such<lb/> analysis of reuse at the global scale is likely to be difficult, as pointed out by <ref type="biblio">Seckler et al. (1998).<lb/></ref> Another aspect of global water scarcity which is extremely important, but also challenging to come<lb/> to grips with in a standard CGE model, is that of trans-boundary river basins. <ref type="biblio">DeStefano et al. (2010)<lb/></ref> identify 16 &apos;at risk&apos; river basins which are likely to pose particular problems in the coming decades due to<lb/> expected increases in hydrological variability and poor institutions governing international flows of water.<lb/> Ten of these are in Africa – a region already torn by strife. Analysing these flows and the resulting<lb/> tensions would be a valuable contribution, but may best be done in a regional model which combines<lb/> hydrological, climatic and economic dimensions of the problem.<lb/></p>

			<head>8. CONCLUSIONS AND RESEARCH PRIORITIES<lb/> 8.1. Summary of Findings<lb/></head>

			<p>The purpose of this background paper has been to survey the literature bearing on various<lb/> dimensions of water scarcity and economic growth, with an eye to the incorporation of future water<lb/> scarcity into a global CGE model such as the OECD&apos;s ENV-Linkages model. The evidence that links<lb/> water scarcity to a slow-down of the long term rate of national economic growth is still relatively scarce.<lb/> At local scale, water shortages can have a devastating impact – particularly in the near term, with power<lb/> outages, retirement of irrigated crop land and unemployment. These localised impacts suggest the need<lb/> for greater disaggregation than is usually the case in global CGE models. The minimum relevant scale<lb/> would appear to be the river basin. Implementation of a global CGE model with water demand and supply<lb/> fleshed out at the level of river basins will be a significant undertaking. However, some progress has been<lb/> made in this regard (<ref type="biblio">Liu et al., 2014</ref>) and there is a great deal of existing data and modelling work outside<lb/> the CGE community which can form the foundation for such studies (e.g., <ref type="biblio">Rosegrant et al. 2013</ref>).<lb/> As society looks ahead to a world of increasing water scarcity, a key factor will be the scope for<lb/> society to conserve water: (a) by increasing efficiency in existing uses (e.g. water-efficient appliances),<lb/> (b) by substituting away from water intensive production activities (e.g., shifting from irrigated to rainfed<lb/> cropping) and (c) by substituting away from water intensive consumption goods and services (e.g., green<lb/> lawns). The overall capacity of the economy to substitute increasingly abundant physical and human<lb/> capital for scarce water, is captured by the elasticity of substitution between these two inputs, s . If<lb/> technology and preferences result in a value of<lb/> 1<lb/>   , then as water becomes more scarce, the associated<lb/> ENV/WKP(2016)11<lb/> 47<lb/> economic rents will claim a larger and larger share of GDP. Eventually this could become a significant<lb/> drag on the economy. In the literature review provided here, it appears that, at the level of individual<lb/> sectors, this relatively inelastic response to water scarcity is indeed prevalent. However, it remains to be<lb/> seen what scope there is for the economy to substitute more aggressively away from water intensive<lb/> activities and consumption goods. Quantifying this potential should be part of the research agenda<lb/> undertaken with the kind of global CGE model discussed in this report.<lb/> Having flagged the potential for water scarcity to become a brake on economic growth, it should also<lb/> be pointed out that water use is by no means destined to grow in proportion to population and/or output.<lb/> Indeed, in reviewing the literature on water demand, the ample opportunities for conserving water across<lb/> the board are striking, including in the electric power sector, the production of industrial steam, residential<lb/> consumption, and irrigated agriculture. In our opinion, the main reason why such substitution has not<lb/> been more widespread to date is due to the absence of economic incentives for conservation. In many uses<lb/> around the world, water remains virtually free. And where a pricing structure does exist, it varies widely<lb/> across sectors. Indeed, one could argue that the inter-sectoral price differential for water (100x in some<lb/> places) represents one of the most extreme misallocations of a resource in the world economy today.<lb/></p>

			<p>The presence of this large inter-sectoral distortion heightens the need for general equilibrium<lb/> analysis. Not only does the CGE approach offer estimates of the direct gains from reducing this distortion,<lb/> but it also captures how this distortion interacts with other shocks to the economy. Indeed, it is entirely<lb/> possible that, in a world of increasing water scarcity, water surplus regions could suffer efficiency losses<lb/> as a result of the interplay between these distortions and international price changes.<lb/></p>

			<p>The presence of these large factor market distortions is a tribute to the power of the vested interests<lb/> which control existing water rights. And their resilience over time is evidence of significant political<lb/> power. However, as water scarcity becomes more severe, it is possible that these vested interests will be<lb/> overtaken by the broader national interest, and a more economically efficient allocation of water will<lb/> emerge. In this sense, the looming water crisis could actually become a growth opportunity, since<lb/> reallocating water to higher value uses could bring significant aggregate benefits.<lb/></p>

			<head>8.2. Research Agenda<lb/></head>

			<p>As is clear from this report, modelling the impacts of water scarcity in a global, CGE framework is<lb/> not for the faint of heart! This raises the legitimate question: Recognising that one cannot do everything at<lb/> the outset, what are the top priorities?<lb/></p>

			<p>Firstly, it is essential to break out water from the other inputs in the CGE model. It is difficult to talk<lb/> about water scarcity if this is treated as a latent factor of production, the impact of which is only felt<lb/> through changes in productivity, as has been done in some of the earlier studies.<lb/> Secondly, given the importance of reuse in the total supply picture, it would appear that treating<lb/> water as both an input and an output is warranted. Other than in the municipal water utility sector, the<lb/> water output will typically be a by-product, and, in order for it to be reused, some further processing is<lb/> required.<lb/></p>

			<p>Thirdly, as soon as one seeks to break out an input in the social accounting matrix underpinning a<lb/> CGE model, it becomes necessary to value the flow, which takes us into the realm of water pricing and<lb/> the value of the marginal product of water in different uses. As identified in her recent review, Olmstead<lb/> (2013) highlights this as a central challenge to those currently working in this area. Such a data set on<lb/> global water prices, by sector, would be an enormously important public good, and the OECD is well-<lb/>positioned to champion such an effort. Indeed, the OECD already undertakes similar exercises for<lb/> ENV/WKP(2016)11<lb/> 48<lb/> agricultural subsidies (e.g, OECD, 2016a) and the IEA does so for energy prices and subsidies. Such an<lb/> activity would pair nicely with the development of a global CGE model which can utilise these data to<lb/> shed light on the interplay between future water scarcity, the allocation of resources across sectors and<lb/> countries, and long run economic growth.<lb/> Fourthly, once a data set is assembled, the minimalist model will need to differentiate between the<lb/> various classes of water uses identified above. Given its prominence in overall water withdrawals, as well<lb/> as its critical role in accommodating future scarcity in water availability, the irrigated cropping sector<lb/> demands special attention. Here, differentiation of irrigated and rainfed activities will be essential if the<lb/> model is to capture the full potential for water conversation through altering the mix of rainfed and<lb/> irrigated agriculture. Residential, commercial, industrial and electric power generation demands can be<lb/> handled in a relatively straightforward manner, with limited short run substitution possibilities, but<lb/> significant long run substitution in the context of new, more water-efficient capital stocks. In the context<lb/> of electricity generation, in addition to water consumption in the cooling processes, it will also be<lb/> important to recognise the evaporative losses which accompany hydropower generation. At the outset,<lb/> treatment of environmental demands will likely follow the literature and simply reserve a portion of in-<lb/>stream flows for these uses.<lb/> Finally, the impact of water scarcity on economic growth will depend critically on the allocation<lb/> rules chosen for dealing with scarcity. Therefore, the model should be designed in such a way as to permit<lb/> maximum flexibility in the choice of different approaches to water allocation. These might include a<lb/> cascading set of priorities, as in the IMPACT-WATER model, sub-markets wherein certain sectors<lb/> compete for residual water supply, as well as a full-blown market for water at the level of individual river<lb/> basins. Being able to analyse the distributional and efficiency impacts of alternative approaches to water<lb/> allocation will allow such a model to play an important role in future debates about water scarcity and<lb/> economic growth.<lb/> ENV/WKP(2016)11</p>
