			<head>Summary<lb/></head>

			<p>Many governments in different parts of the world are investing in high speed rail. Some of<lb/> them do so thinking that it will be an important part of climate change mitigation. Intercity<lb/> traffic over medium distances is particularly interesting in the environmental context as it<lb/> constitutes the only transport segment where aircraft, trains, coaches and cars naturally<lb/> compete for market shares.<lb/> This report calculates the effect on emissions from building a new high speed link that<lb/> connects two major cities located 500 km apart. It assumes that emissions from new vehicles<lb/> and aircraft in 2025 can be used as a proxy for the emissions during a 50 year investment<lb/> depreciation period. The emissions from the marginal production of electricity, used by rail<lb/> and electric vehicles, are estimated to amount on average to 530 gram per kWh for the entire<lb/> period. Fuels used by road vehicles are assumed to be on average 80 percent fossil and 20 per<lb/> cent renewable (with a 65% carbon efficiency in the latter case).<lb/> Traffic on the new line after a few years is assumed to consist to 20 per cent of journeys<lb/> diverted from aviation, 20 per cent diverted from cars, 5 per cent from long-distance coaches,<lb/> and 30 per cent from pre-existing trains. The remaining 25 per cent is new generated traffic.<lb/> Under these assumptions would the investment result in a net reduction of CO 2 -emissions of<lb/> about 9,000 tons per one million one-way trips. Assuming 10 million single journeys per year,<lb/> the total reduction would be 90,000 tons.<lb/></p>

			<p>When the price of CO 2 is $40 per ton, the socio-economic benefit of the reduction would<lb/> amount to $3.6 million, which is very little in the context of high speed rail. The sensitivity<lb/> analysis shows that alternative assumptions do not significantly change the outcome. One<lb/> may also have to consider the impact on climate change from building the new line.<lb/> Construction emissions for a line of this length may amount to several million tons of CO 2 .<lb/></p>

			<p>There is no cause to prohibit investment in high speed rail on environmental grounds so long<lb/> as the carbon gains made in traffic balances the emissions caused during construction.<lb/> However, marketing high speed rail as a part of the solution to climate change is clearly<lb/> wrong. Investment in infrastructure for modal shift should only be considered when traffic<lb/> volumes are high enough to carry the cost. The principal benefits of high speed rail are time<lb/> savings, additional capacity and generated traffic, not a reduction of greenhouse gases.<lb/></p>

			<head>Background<lb/></head>

			<p>Intercity passenger transport is growing fast to meet demand for mobility from private citizens<lb/> and the business community. A shift to fast modes of transport makes it possible to travel<lb/> longer annual distances within restrained time budgets. Aviation and high speed trains are the<lb/> fastest among modes. Although high speed comes at the price of negative environmental<lb/> impact, many environmentalists claim, along with the companies and interest organizations of<lb/> the rail sector, that high speed trains are environmentally benign and should be allowed to<lb/> form an important part of climate change mitigation.<lb/> de Rus and Nash (2007 take another view; &quot; Decisions to invest in high speed rail have not<lb/> always been based on sound economic analysis. A mix of arguments, besides time savings –<lb/> strategic considerations, environmental effects, regional development and so forth – have<lb/> often been used with inadequate evidence to support them. &quot;<lb/> Intercity traffic over distances between 400 and 600 km is particularly interesting in the<lb/> environmental context as it constitutes the only transport segment where aircraft, trains,<lb/> coaches and cars naturally compete for market shares. Among the parameters that influence<lb/> modal choice are price, travel time, frequency, comfort and personal safety. Environmental<lb/> considerations may also play a role although rather few appear to be willing to make any<lb/> larger sacrifice in terms of cost in order to contribute to a better environment.<lb/> The objective of this paper is to analyze whether the difference in environmental impact<lb/> between passenger transport modes is large enough to justify government investment in<lb/> modal shift. As investment in new infrastructure usually has to be written-off over 40 to<lb/> 60 years, the perspective in this paper is long-term. Limiting the analyses to current<lb/> differences in environmental impact between cars, buses, trains and aircraft would clearly be<lb/> wrong.<lb/> A distinction is made in this paper between fast passenger trains and high speed trains. The<lb/> former travel at a maximum speed of 150-200 km/h, while the latter are capable of top speeds<lb/> in the excess of 250 km/h. Average speeds, however, may be lower due to track restraints.<lb/></p>

			<head>Intermodal competition<lb/></head>

			<p>The author assumes that few people find it acceptable to travel between cities located 400 to<lb/> 600 kilometers from each other at average speeds below 90-100 km/h when infrastructure that<lb/> allows such speeds or more exists. Therefore the potential environmental benefits from<lb/> travelling at average speeds below 100 km/h are disregarded in this paper.<lb/></p>

			<p>The willingness-to-pay for high speed varies among people and is closely connected to<lb/> income (or having someone else pay ones bill). The fact that some customers prefer<lb/> low-speed intercity trains to fast trains or high-speed trains is a sign of this. This means that<lb/> investment in rail for high-speed trains will have only an insignificant effect, if any, on those<lb/> customers who currently prefer local trains (with many stops) to existing fast trains.<lb/> Presumably the effect on those who today prefer to travel by car will also be small, although<lb/> perhaps not insignificant. The reasons for taking the time to travel by car may be reduced cost<lb/> (e.g. several people travelling in one car) or that the traveler needs a car on his arrival to the<lb/> destination.<lb/> <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> shows the time that it takes to travel from city center to city center by different<lb/> modes. It is assumed that the air passenger on average has to devote a total of 70 minutes on<lb/> ground level connections to and from airports and needs to check in 30 minutes earlier than a<lb/> train passenger. Passenger who check-in luggage may need an additional 10 minutes.<lb/> Aircrafts are assumed to spend 10 minutes on waiting and taxing. People travelling by car are<lb/> assumed to need a 30 minutes break for a fast meal when the distance is 600 km.<lb/> From the table it is evident that conventional trains can compete with air traffic up to a<lb/> distance of a little less 400 km. However, at 500 and 600 km it takes a high speed train to beat<lb/> aviation. The fact that some people nevertheless choose to travel by aviation may be<lb/> explained by several factors among them frequency of connections, price and personal<lb/> preferences.<lb/></p>

			<p>As most central stations are located down-town, an advantage of travelling by rail is that the<lb/> journey takes you from city center to city center. However, all passengers to not have a down-<lb/>town location as their point of departure or a final destination that is located in or close to a<lb/> city center. For them the total travel-time may be shorter by a combination of aviation and a<lb/> rental car or a taxi. A shift from fast to high-speed train may or may not make a difference for<lb/> this type of customer. The difference in travel time is small already when travelling from city<lb/> center to city center.<lb/></p>

			<p>Transport affects the environment in numerous ways. The most important parameters in the<lb/> context of intercity passenger traffic are exhaust emissions (NO x , SO x , PM and VOC), noise,<lb/> and climate change. Land-use, including intrusion and barrier effects, may also be important.<lb/> Calculating the environmental effects of different ways of moving people must in the context<lb/> of infrastructure planning and investment take account of the anticipated technological<lb/> development during the depreciation period and the step-wise enforcement of more stringent<lb/> environment standards. The correct way of doing this would be to calculate the cost of<lb/> emissions year-by-year and to translate future costs to present day value by a discount rate. In<lb/> a world of fast technological development, the outcome to a large extent depends on the<lb/> length of the depreciation period and the choice of discount rate. A long period in<lb/> combination with a low discount rate (e.g. 60 years and 2 or 3%) gives a high weight to<lb/> future, more environmentally benign technologies, while a high discount rate, say 4-6 per<lb/> cent, means that the results are much influenced by the current, relatively large, differences<lb/> between the modes. The general expectation among experts is that these differences will<lb/> diminish over-time as all modes need to become cleaner and more energy efficient.<lb/> However, no expert can tell us what new vehicles and engines will look like 30 or 50 years<lb/> ahead. At best they can forecast with some degree of accuracy what designs and engines that<lb/> will dominate the production of new vessels and vehicles 10 or 15 years from now. Given that<lb/> trains and aircraft tend to become 25 to 30 years before being scrapped, most vessels<lb/> produced in, say, 2025 will still be used in 2045, which is 36 years from now. However, by<lb/> then these vessels will only make up a small part of the total fleet. The life of cars and buses<lb/> are shorter but newly produced passenger cars may on average become 15-20 years old before<lb/> being replaced. Electric vehicles, that have very durable engines and transmission systems,<lb/> may in future become even older.<lb/></p>

			<p>One way around the problem with unknown future technologies and the choice of discount<lb/> rate may be to base the evaluation of the long-term environmental performance of the<lb/> different modes on what might be the best available technology in 2025, 16 years from now.<lb/> The assumption would then be that these technologies will dominate transport at mid-term of<lb/> the depreciation period and may be taken as a proxy for the environmental impact of a mode<lb/> over an entire period of 50-60 years. In the following sections this simplified method is used<lb/> for producing a rough picture of the long-term differences in environmental impact per<lb/> passenger kilometer.<lb/></p>

			<head>Tailpipe emissions<lb/></head>

			<p>Regulated exhaust emissions occur from all types of internal combustion engines as well as<lb/> from power plants that use fossil fuels or biofuel. The maximum permissible tailpipe<lb/> emissions from cars and buses have been drastically reduced over the</p>

			<table>last 15 years and will<lb/> continue to decline. By 2025, new vehicles may be expected to emit so little that the<lb/> aggregated impact from the entire new fleet is negligible. However, as cars and buses have<lb/> operating lives of 15-20 years, it will take until about 2035 for the total fleet to be clean. By<lb/> then the share of electric road vehicles and plug-in electric hybrid cars may also be<lb/> substantial.<lb/> The electricity used by trains, and in the future by a growing number of cars, is marginally<lb/> produced in coal-fired power plants, and in most countries such plants dominate the grid.<lb/> Some power plants still emit huge quantities of sulphur and NO x . Several European power<lb/> plants, most of them located in Eastern Europe currently emit more than 100,000 tons of SO 2<lb/> at thermal capacities ranging from 800 to 12,000 MW, and a number of plants, most of them<lb/> British, emit more than 20,000 tons of NO x per year (Entec, 2008). This means that the worst<lb/> emit more than 20 gram SO 2 and 3 gram NO x per kilowatt-hour produced. However, by 2025<lb/> such power plants will either have been decommissioned or have had to clean up their<lb/> operations. Thus in the longer term also the regulated emissions from power plants will have<lb/> been reduced to sustainable levels.<lb/></table>

			<p>The assumption here is therefore that the remaining tailpipe emissions, if any, as well as those<lb/> originating from power production can be disregarded in a long-term comparison between the<lb/> land-based modes.<lb/> For aviation, the situation is more complicated. The emissions of NO x from aircraft are a<lb/> major long-term concern, however, primarily because of their contribution to climate change.<lb/> Emissions of NO x from airplanes will therefore be addressed in the below section on<lb/> greenhouse gases.<lb/></p>

			<head>Noise<lb/></head>

			<p>Problems associated with noise from vehicles and vessels are sight-specific. It is therefore<lb/> difficult or impossible to calculate average noise costs for different modes. However, a few<lb/> general observations can be made. Intercity journeys by car or bus usually takes place on<lb/> motorways or other high-standard roads that allow speeds of 90 km/h or more. At such speeds<lb/> the tire-to-surface noise dominates over engine noise, which means electrification of road<lb/> vehicles will have limited impact on equivalent noise levels. On the other hand, motorways<lb/> and other major roads are often built as to avoid crossing through minor towns and other<lb/> settlements. That means fewer people are victims of such road noise compared with noise<lb/> from railway lines which for historical reasons were often designed to go through the heart of<lb/> towns. However, new high speed lines may also avoid crossing through smaller towns where<lb/> no stop is made anyway.<lb/></p>

			<p>A 50 per cent reduction of external noise from trains and aircraft appears to be technologically<lb/> possible. Additional improvement can be achieved by using noise-absorbing road surface<lb/> materials or install absorbents close to the railway track. Shielding by noise-protection walls<lb/> may significantly reduce the impact but only relatively close to the barrier. People living<lb/> further away will be affected by the diffuse background noise that barriers cannot stop. Where<lb/> aviation is concerned, the only way of shielding is by improved insulation, particularly of<lb/> windows.<lb/></p>

			<head>P. Kageson — Discussion Paper 2009-28 — © OECD/ITF, 2009<lb/> 7<lb/></head>

			<p>The noise created by large carriers amount to less per passenger kilometer compared with an<lb/> equally high sound from a smaller vehicle or vessel. Trains that can seat hundreds of<lb/> passenger therefore create less noise per passenger kilometer than cars even when making<lb/> much more noise when passing. However, in the road environment noise is dominated by<lb/> trucks. The marginal contribution of an additional car to an already busy road is small.<lb/></p>

			<p>The conclusion is that the social marginal cost caused by traffic noise cannot be included in a<lb/> generalized comparison of the different modes. A shift from one mode to another may<lb/> increase or decrease the impact on human health depending on local circumstances.<lb/></p>

			<head>Land use and landscape<lb/></head>

			<p>The use of land and the impact on landscape is also to a large extent site-specific. However,<lb/> some general observations can be made.<lb/></p>

			<p>Aviation, for natural reasons, consumes much less land per passenger kilometer than other<lb/> passenger transport modes. An additional flight generally does not cause any extra damage in<lb/> this sense while growing traffic volumes may after a while require an additional runway or<lb/> even a new airport.<lb/></p>

			<p>Intercity traffic by car, bus or traditional intercity trains share infrastructure with vehicles<lb/> bound for other destinations and to some extent with local traffic. The marginal impact on<lb/> land-use is usually zero. It is only when congestion calls for additional infrastructure capacity<lb/> to be built that more intercity traffic will make a difference. If new capacity is created simply<lb/> by adding a new lane or track, the marginal effect on land-use is limited and no new barrier is<lb/> formed.<lb/></p>

			<p>Introducing high-speed trains where no previous infrastructure for such trains exists requires a<lb/> new railway especially designed for this type of traffic. High speed traffic requires a layout<lb/> with large radius curves and limited gradients. 1 The horizontal curve radius must be at least<lb/> 5.5 kilometers to accommodate speeds of 300 km/h, and should ideally not be less than 7<lb/> kilometers (UIC, 2008a). 2 For these reasons high speed tracks are often built in new corridors<lb/> although partial location to existing railway or motorway corridors is sometimes possible.<lb/> This means new land is occupied and new barriers are created.<lb/> A potential side-effect of building a new line for high speed trains is that more room is left for<lb/> other types of train on the pre-existing rail infrastructure. Proponents of high speed rail often<lb/> claim that the creation of new corridors makes an expansion of goods transport by train<lb/> possible in otherwise congested railway systems. An indirect effect of this may be that a shift<lb/> from road to track will reduce the overall environmental impact of freight transport. However,<lb/></p>

			<head>8<lb/> P. Kageson — Discussion Paper 2009-28 — © OECD/ITF, 2009<lb/></head>

			<p>for this to happen there must be a latent demand for transport by rail that could previously not<lb/> be met for lack of capacity.<lb/></p>

			<p>Theoretically, rail because of the high capacity of trains require much less land for a given<lb/> number of passenger than roads (although buses require less space than cars). However, to be<lb/> able to make maximum use of this advantage all trains should run at the same speed and stop<lb/> at the same stations. Mixing fast and slow trains with each other, and passenger trains with<lb/> freight trains, may significantly reduce the actual capacity of a railway corridor.<lb/></p>

			<head>Climate change<lb/></head>

			<p>The transport sector&apos;s contribution to climate change appears to be the only environmental<lb/> parameter of great concern in a long-term perspective. The remaining part of this paper will<lb/> therefore be devoted to the question of whether modal shift in intercity passenger transport<lb/> would do the climate any good. It starts with providing current data and assumptions<lb/> concerning the future energy-efficiency of the various modes. It then discusses the issue of<lb/> how to calculate the short-term marginal effect on greenhouse gas emissions, and finally goes<lb/> on to analyze the impact on actual emissions of load factors.<lb/></p>

			<p>Calculating carbon emissions well-to-wheel is a complicated matter. In this short paper the<lb/> comparison between emissions, direct or indirect, from rail, road and aviation are based on<lb/> tank-to-wheels for diesel and gasoline cars and on fuel-to-electricity for electric trains and<lb/> cars. This means that for road and aviation fuels, the extraction, refining and delivery of fuels<lb/> to gas stations have been omitted, and for electricity, the extraction and transport of coal to<lb/> the power stations as well as any grid-losses. In both cases these emissions amount to 10-15<lb/> per cent of the well-to-wheel emissions.<lb/></p>

			<head>Electric trains<lb/></head>

			<p>Modern fast passenger trains travelling at a medium speed of 150 km/h use 0.031 to 0.045<lb/> kWh per seat kilometer (<ref type="biblio">Lukaszewicz and Andersson, 2006</ref>), while high speed trains at<lb/> service speeds of around 250 km/h require 0.041 to 0.065 kWh per seat kilometer (RSSB,<lb/> 2007). The Japanese Shinkansen 700 consumes as little as 0.029 kWh due to a wide-body and<lb/> large train length which results in more seats per length meter and a very high total number of<lb/> seats. As the gauge in many countries, notably in most of Europe, does not allow wide-bodies<lb/> that can seat 2+3 passengers, the following sections focus on trains that seat 2+2 passengers.<lb/></p>

			<p>Passenger</p>

			<table>trains need energy for:<lb/> accelerating up to speed<lb/> overcoming resistance to movement<lb/> climbing gradients<lb/> powering control systems<lb/> lighting, heating, cooling and ventilating the carriages<lb/> P. Kageson — Discussion Paper 2009-28 — © OECD/ITF, 2009<lb/> 9<lb/> The energy needed for accelerating up to speed is defined by the weight (mass) of the train<lb/> and the speed. This kinetic energy increases with the square of the speed and so does the<lb/> aerodynamic resistance, i.e. the drag needed to push the train through the air (UIC, 2008b).<lb/> Therefore moving the train at 300 km/h will require four times the energy needed for a trip in<lb/> 150 km/h (all else equal).<lb/> The rail sector is committed to reducing the average electricity consumption by different types<lb/> of trains by investing in new technologies and by making operations more fuel-efficient.<lb/> CER, the Community of European Railway and Infrastructure Companies has committed to<lb/> an overall reduction of 30 per cent in CO 2 emissions per passenger and ton kilometer between<lb/> 1990 and 2020. The companies will make use of new or improved technologies as well as<lb/> &quot; Eco-driving &quot; , active traffic management and efficient timetabling (UIC, 2008b).<lb/> Some railway companies have already achieved reductions of this magnitude. In the UK the<lb/> specific primary energy consumption in passenger rail transport fell by 25 per cent between<lb/> 1995 and 2006, and Deutsche Bahn reports reductions by one third between 1990 and 2007<lb/> for both freight and regional passenger traffic (UIC and CER, 2008). However, the primary<lb/> energy consumption in passenger long distance traffic was not reduced at all, presumably<lb/> reflecting a shift to higher average speed.<lb/> Actual consumption per seat kilometer depends on:<lb/> Train length<lb/> Number of seats per length meter<lb/> Aerodynamics<lb/> Weight<lb/> Tunnel length and tunnel diameter<lb/> Average speed and top speed<lb/> Number of stops and accelerations/decelerations due to changing speed limits<lb/> Engine efficiency and degree of regenerative braking<lb/></table>

			<p>Reducing air drag is the single most important measure for cutting electricity consumption at<lb/> high speeds. Nose and tail need to be adequately streamlined. Bogie shielding, removal or<lb/> shielding of roof-based equipment and closing inter-car gaps are other measure of importance.<lb/> Much of this is cost-effective already at speeds between 150 or 200 km/h and should be<lb/> demanded by any cost-conscious operator and delivered by all train manufacturers. However,<lb/> the fact that energy consumption (all else equal) rises dramatically with speed indicates that<lb/> there may be some very expensive measures that pay-off only in high speed trains.<lb/></p>

			<p>The impact of tunnels on aerodynamic resistance depends on the narrowness of the tunnel<lb/> area and is larger for single-track than for double-track tunnels. If tunnels make up 10 per cent<lb/> of the distance of a high speed line they may increase overall air drag by around 8 per cent<lb/> and the overall energy consumption by 5 per cent.<lb/></p>

			<head>10<lb/> P. Kageson — Discussion Paper 2009-28 — © OECD/ITF, 2009<lb/></head>

			<p>The number of seats per length meter is also highly relevant for energy consumption (at any<lb/> speed).Travelling at high speed over medium distances may allow the operator to save some<lb/> space by substituting a bistro or restaurant car by trolley catering.<lb/></p>

			<p>As shown in <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>, the estimates of the difference in energy consumption between<lb/> conventional intercity trains and high speed trains vary considerably. High speed trains are<lb/> said to require anything from 9 to 150 per cent more energy per seat km.<lb/></p>

			<p>This range is clearly much too big. According to Network Rail (2009), running resistance<lb/> accounts for 68 per cent of the energy consumed by an intercity train, while inertia and<lb/> comfort functions make up respectively 10 and 22 per cent. The two latter will not change<lb/> much with increasing speed for a point-to-point service. As running resistance at speeds<lb/> above 200 km/h is dominated by drag, which increases with approximately the square of the<lb/> speed, it seems reasonable to assume that increasing the service speed from 200 to 300 km/h<lb/> should raise electricity consumption by about 85 per cent, all else equal. This is close to<lb/> figures given by <ref type="biblio">Zängl (1993)</ref>, who says that a German ICE running at 300 km/h (constant<lb/> speed) would require 83 per cent more energy per seat km than when the same train travels at<lb/> 200 km/h.<lb/></p>

			<p>The author of this paper has searched, in vain, the literature for marginal cost curves for<lb/> technical measures that improve the fuel-efficiency of passenger trains, and he has in addition<lb/> consulted experts without getting an answer to his question concerning how much more could<lb/> be done on high speed trains compared to new conventional trains. However, the marginal<lb/> cost curve for reducing air drag most likely is rather flat. 3<lb/></p>

			<p>The difference between what can be done to reduce the consumption of a high speed train<lb/> compared to conventional fast trains will be a result of the former being able to accept a<lb/> higher marginal abatement cost and/or of a difference in train length or seats per length meter.<lb/> However, the latter, assuming that operators attempt to maximise profits, would only be a<lb/> result of substituting a restaurant by a trolley service, assuming that passengers can content<lb/> themselves with the latter when the travelling time is short. Where train length is concerned,<lb/> operators can choose to meet the higher demand for the high speed train compared to<lb/> traditional services either by adding cars or by offering more frequent services (or possibly a<lb/> combination).<lb/></p>

			<p>Based on the above argumentation, it is assumed that the difference in seat km energy<lb/> consumption between future 200 km/h IC trains and 300 km/h high speed trains may be in the<lb/> order of 40 to 50 per cent, assuming the same number of intermediate stops. The assumption<lb/> is that most of the reduction compared with the all-else-equal case comes from making the<lb/> high speed train longer than the conventional train. In the sections below it is assumed that<lb/> trains with such top speeds will on average run at respectively 150 and 280 km/h due to track<lb/> restraints.<lb/> Diverting traffic from an existing line where the service speed is 150 km/h to a new high<lb/> speed line that allows an average speed of 280 km/h would make energy use per seat km<lb/> increase by at least 60 per cent (assuming use of modern technologies in both cases). The<lb/> effect on air drag from 10 per cent tunneling is also considered in this choice of mark-up for<lb/> high speed electricity consumption. In the calculations below, the new 2025 fast train is<lb/> assumed to consume 0.018 kWh per seat km (150 km/h), while the high speed trains uses<lb/> 0.029 kWh (280 km/h).<lb/></p>

			<p>The issue of how electricity consumption affects CO 2 emissions is discussed in a later section.<lb/></p>

			<head>Aviation<lb/></head>

			<p>Modern commercial aircraft use on average between 0.029 and 0.039 liters per seat km. 4<lb/> Short-range aircraft, however, burn significantly more than long distance flights.<lb/> Substantial improvements in airframe design and engine efficiency as well as wide-scale use<lb/> of composite materials to reduce weight is expected to take place in the next few decades.<lb/> &quot; Clean Sky &quot; is a R&amp;D program under the European Commission&apos;s Seventh Research<lb/> Framework Program. According to the Advisory Council for Aeronautical Research in<lb/> Europe (ACARE), the greening of air transport means developing technologies to reduce the<lb/> environmental impact of aviation with the aim of halving the amount of</p>

			<table>CO 2 emitted by air<lb/> transport, cutting specific emissions NO x by 80 per cent. Reducing soot, water vapor and<lb/> particulates emissions will also be tackled. These targets are to be reached in 2020.<lb/> The International Air Transport Association (IATA) is much less optimistic but believes that<lb/> it should be possible to reach 1.5 per cent average annual improvement in fuel efficiency to<lb/> 2020. 5 The difference between ACARE and IATA can probably be explained, at least<lb/> partially, by ACARE&apos;s focus on new technologies. IATA&apos;s target appears to concern fleet<lb/> averages.<lb/> Based on Easyjet&apos;s Corporate Responsibility Report 2006, ATOC (2009) estimates that flying<lb/> a new Airbus A319 causes CO 2 emissions of about 115 g per seat km for a 300 km flight and<lb/> 85 g for a flight twice that long. This corresponds to 0.046 and 0.034 liter of kerosene<lb/> respectively. Boeing claims that the new 7E7 &quot; Dreamliner &quot; will require only 0.017 liters per<lb/> seat km, while Airbus says the A380 will consume less than three liters per 100 passenger km<lb/> (RSSB, 2007). Assuming a 70 per cent load factor, the latter means 0.021 liter per seat km.<lb/> However, these figures are for long flights. One might have to multiply by 1.5 to arrive at<lb/> figures that correspond to the fuel consumption of short-hauls (RSSB, 2007)<lb/> ATOC (2009), referring to work done for the British Committee on Climate Change, thinks<lb/> that CO 2 emissions from short-haul flights can be reduced by 35 per cent by 2025 compared<lb/> with 2006, resulting in 62 g CO 2 per seat km. This corresponds to 0.025 liters per seat km and<lb/> is the value that will be used in this report. It should be recognized that shifting from jets to<lb/> turbo-props would reduce fuel consumption further, however, at the price of lower speed.<lb/></table>

			<p>Aircraft emit several other gases and substances that contribute to global warming, among<lb/> them NO x , water vapor and particles that form ozone and contrails and may contribute to the<lb/> formation of cirrus clouds. To take account of this contribution, the aggregated impact of<lb/> aviation is sometimes calculated by multiplying the radiative forcing of the aircraft&apos;s CO 2<lb/> emission by a factor of 1.5-2.5. An earlier study by the IPCC (1999) even suggested a factor<lb/> of 2.7. However, technological development will reduce these emissions substantially until<lb/> 2025, where NO x is concerned probably more than CO 2 . Of relevance in the context of<lb/> short-distance flights is also that the aircraft cruises at high altitude during a relatively short<lb/> part of its journey and often does not reach the tropopause at all. Therefore it makes sense to<lb/> use a relatively low factor. Econ (2008) suggests factor 1.3 but this report will use factor 1.5.<lb/></p>

			<head>Passenger cars<lb/></head>

			<p>New</p>

			<table>cars sold in Europe in 2008 on average emitted 154 gram CO 2 per kilometer when<lb/> driven according to the official EU test cycle. Emissions in real traffic are probably higher, in<lb/> particular in areas plagued by congestion. An EU directive limits emissions from new cars of<lb/> average size (weight) in 2015 to 130 g/km and indicates that the limit may be as low as<lb/> 95 g/km by 2020. The assumption here is thus that new fossil-fuelled cars, including electric<lb/> 5<lb/> Airlines present climate change proposals to heads of governments. Press release 22 September 2009.<lb/> P. Kageson — Discussion Paper 2009-28 — © OECD/ITF, 2009<lb/> 13<lb/> hybrids, may on average emit 85 gram in 2025 when driven as prescribed by the European<lb/> test cycle. However, emissions in intercity traffic may differ a bit from those resulting from<lb/> the test.<lb/> Speed has a large impact on fuel consumption, not only in trains, but in any type of vehicle or<lb/> vessel. Tests made by the Swedish National Road Administration (2000-2001 models)<lb/></table>

			<p>indicate that emissions at constant speed are 30 per cent higher at 110 km/h compared to<lb/> 70 km/h. Nevertheless, today´s cars emit more in the urban part of the test-cycle than in the<lb/> part that represents driving in rural areas. This, however, may change when most cars are<lb/> equipped with start-stop functions and systems for regeneration of braking energy. The use of<lb/> full hybrids will have a much greater impact on fuel consumption in urban driving than on the<lb/> highway. In the long-term the difference in average fuel consumption between the urban and<lb/> the rural part of the test cycle is likely to be small.<lb/></p>

			<p>In addition, one should be aware that the rural part of the cycle does not include much of<lb/> motorway speeds. On the other hand, modern future cars will be equipped with cruise control<lb/> and other assists that help the driver to keep the speed constant, thereby avoiding the<lb/> efficiency losses associated with variations in speed. Therefore the assumption here is that the<lb/> average new fossil-fuelled car will in 2025 emit 105 gram CO 2 per km when driven on non-<lb/>congested motorways where the speed-limit is 120 km/h and the average speed is around<lb/> 110 km/h. This represents a level 24 per cent above the assumed emission limit when new<lb/> cars in 2025 are driven according to the test cycle and equals 21 gram per seat km.<lb/> Plug-in electric hybrids and all-electric battery cars that are charged from the grid may<lb/> become common by 2025. Provided that air drag and rolling resistance are similar to those of<lb/> the fossil-fuelled cars of the same vehicle generation, one may expect these electric vehicles<lb/> to consume on average around 0.15 kWh per km when driven according to the European test<lb/> cycle (<ref type="biblio">King, 2007, and Hacker et al, 2009</ref>. Under motorway conditions the specific<lb/> consumption may increase to 0.19 or 0.20 kWh per km. Thus, this paper assumes that the<lb/> average consumption when used for intercity journeys will be 0.2 kWh per vehicle km and<lb/> 0.04 kWh per seat km. The issue of how grid electricity affects CO 2 emissions is discussed in<lb/> a later section.<lb/></p>

			<head>Long-distance buses<lb/></head>

			<p>Megabus, a British company, reports an average fuel consumption of 0.577 liter per km for its<lb/> double-deck Stagecoach Megabus, presumably under rather mixed traffic conditions (</p>

			<table>no<lb/> details provided). 6 This equals 0.0063 liters per seat km. Norges Naturvernforbund (2008),<lb/> based on data from Volvo, says that an annual average for the Volvo 9700 when used in<lb/> intercity traffic is 0.28 liters per vehicle km. This corresponds to 0.0054 liters per seat km.<lb/> 14<lb/> P. Kageson — Discussion Paper 2009-28 — © OECD/ITF, 2009<lb/> The current long-term potential for improvement appears to be in the order of 25 per cent. 7<lb/> This translates into 0.21 liters per vehicle km for a new bus in 2025 when travelling on<lb/> motorways with little variation in speed and making few stops. This means 0.0040 liters per<lb/> seat km and 10.5 gram CO 2 per seat km. Eco-driving may reduce fuel consumption further but<lb/> is not accounted for here.<lb/></table>

			<head>Emissions indirectly caused by electricity consumption<lb/></head>

			<p>When comparing the impact of different modes, studies often use average power production<lb/> emission figures for electric trains assuming that they run on that mix. This may be correct<lb/> when wanting to illustrate the actual impact of traffic during a given (historical) year.<lb/> However, when the task is to analyze the consequences of investments made to facilitate<lb/> modal shift, it is necessary to base the assessment on the marginal effects on production and<lb/> emissions from growing or declining demand.<lb/></p>

			<p>Growing demand for electricity may coincide with a growing number of windmills and other<lb/> carbon-free means of power production, but in most countries and regions coal-fired<lb/> condensing stations will remain the marginal form of production for the foreseeable future.<lb/> That means under normal conditions that any change in demand will either increase or<lb/> decrease the use of coal or lignite. A successful and large scale introduction of Carbon<lb/> Capture and Storage (CCS) may in the long term change this, but it is currently impossible to<lb/> know to what extent this method will be used by 2025. In the absence of CCS that covers all<lb/> fossil-fuelled power stations connected to a grid, any increase in demand will, in the short to<lb/> medium term, slow down the replacement of coal by more environmentally benign sources of<lb/> electricity.<lb/></p>

			<p>In this context it is also necessary to note the outcome of shrinking demand for electricity on<lb/> emissions of CO 2 , regardless of whether demand is declining as a result of a recession or<lb/> because of energy efficiency improvements. Short term, the power plant with the highest<lb/> variable production cost would be the unit to close first. This will, especially under emissions<lb/> trading, normally be plants that use lignite or hard coal. Wind mills and hydro power stations<lb/> would not reduce production in a situation of diminishing demand. For this reason the<lb/> European Union&apos;s Directive on Energy End Use Efficiency and Energy Services<lb/> (2006/32/EC) recommends that the effect of electricity efficiency improvements should be<lb/> multiplied by 2.5 to reflect the reduction in primary energy consumption. 8 It would be very<lb/> strange, indeed, to use marginal figures when demand is shrinking, and average figures in<lb/> situations of increasing demand. However, this is what the rail industry sometimes does.<lb/> From the above it is obvious that in a system-perspective a shift from aircraft, cars and buses<lb/> to electric trains would reduce demand for kerosene, diesel and gasoline and increase the use<lb/> of coal and gas.<lb/> 7<lb/></p>

			<p>Edward Jobson, AB Volvo, personal communication.<lb/> 8<lb/> 2.5 equals an electricity efficiency of 40% which is normal in coal-fired condensing power stations.<lb/></p>

			<head>P. Kageson — Discussion Paper 2009-28 — © OECD/ITF, 2009<lb/></head>

			<p>Some argue that the introduction of carbon dioxide emissions trading means that taking the<lb/> marginal effect into account has become obsolete. The emissions will not be allowed to<lb/> exceed the cap no matter how much demand for electricity increases. The only effect would<lb/> be that scarcity will make the price of allowances rise. This way of arguing would be<lb/> reasonable if the cap was set to reflect the final target of cutting the carbon emissions of<lb/> Annex 1 countries by 80 or 90 per cent below their 1990-levels. However, the caps under<lb/> discussion in Europe and the United States are intermediate targets for 2020 that are only the<lb/> first steps on a long journey to sustainability.<lb/> If scarcity leads to a fast increase in the equilibrium price of carbon, there is reason to fear<lb/> that politicians may deviate from their current long-term plans. A high or fast rising price may<lb/> make them hesitate about the future of the cap-and-trade systems, and the caps of the next<lb/> stage might be set higher than would have been the case at a lower price of carbon (WWF,<lb/> 2009).<lb/></p>

			<figure>Another difficulty in the context of emissions trading is that the European Emissions Trading<lb/> System (EU ETS) covers CO 2 emissions from power production but not emissions caused by<lb/> cars and buses. Aviation will be included from 2012. In contrast, the proposed American<lb/> scheme (The Waxman-Markey Bill) 9 covers not only fossil energy used in power production<lb/> but also emissions from fuels delivered to any mode of transportation (by an up-stream<lb/> approach). As all emissions from transportation are subject to the scheme, one could argue<lb/> that any expansion of demand for road fuels could not alter the cap. If so there would be no<lb/> need to worry about gas-guzzling SUVs. However, also in this case there is an evident risk<lb/> that a high price will prevent future politicians from following the route outlined in the bill,<lb/> which says emissions should be cut by 80 per cent by 2050 from 2005 levels.<lb/></figure>

			<p>A claim that cap-and-trade systems reduce the marginal climate effect to zero can under no<lb/> circumstances be used on only one mode of transport (rail), and if used on all, there would be<lb/> no ground for the rail sector to claim that high speed rail has an environmental advantage over<lb/> road and aviation as the effect of modal shift on greenhouse gases would by definition always<lb/> be zero. The conclusion here is therefore that the marginal long-term effect on greenhouse<lb/> gases is the most suitable way of comparing the environmental performance of transport by<lb/> different modes.<lb/></p>

			<p>In power production the marginal emissions may differ somewhat depending on whether hard<lb/> coal or lignite is used and whether coal is sometimes replaced by natural gas as the marginal<lb/> source of production. In some systems other means of production may temporarily replace<lb/> coal, for instance during periods of low demand or periods of high production in hydro power<lb/> stations. The efficiency of marginally used coal-fired power plants may also differ from time<lb/> to time and from grid to grid.<lb/></p>

			<figure>A successful climate change mitigation policy will require that coal-fired power plants are<lb/> gradually phased out or alternatively equipped with CCS. In this paper the use of lignite is<lb/> assumed to have been terminated by 2025 (or equipped with CCS). In the even longer term,<lb/> 9<lb/> The American Clean Energy and Security Act of 2009.<lb/> natural gas may have replaced hard coal or all hard coal-fired plants may have installed CCS.<lb/> In a successful climate change policy, aiming at 80 per cent reduction by 2050, hard coal<lb/> (without CCS) may have been phased out by 2035 and replaced by renewable energy, nuclear<lb/> power and natural gas. The latter would then be the new marginal production fuel.<lb/></figure>

			<p>In order to reflect emissions during an entire depreciation period of 50 years for investment in<lb/> new rail infrastructure one might assume hard coal to be the marginal production fuel during<lb/> the first two decades and natural gas during the last three. Electricity produced in a coal-fired<lb/> condensing station with 40 per cent production efficiency gives rise to an emission of about<lb/> 800 gram CO 2 per kWh electricity produced, while natural gas used in a plant with 58 per<lb/> cent efficiency emits 350 gram per kWh electricity. This gives an average of 530 gram per<lb/> kWh for the entire period. This figure disregards the fact that one may have good reasons to<lb/> give higher weight to emissions in the near future compared to those produced 30 or 40 years<lb/> from now.<lb/></p>

			<p>Alternative estimates may be plausible and should, of course, be applied equally on both<lb/> electric trains and road vehicles that use grid electricity.<lb/></p>

			<head>Marginal effects of increasing demand for fossil fuels<lb/></head>

			<p>Carbon free fuels and low-carbon fuels are also in limited supply. The global potential for<lb/> producing first and second generation biofuels is much smaller than current demand for<lb/> conventional fuels. This means any change in demand for road fuels will either increase or<lb/> decrease the use of fossil fuels such as gasoline and diesel. Aviation is even more dependent<lb/> on petroleum-based fuels. As fossil fuels are more easily substituted in other applications,<lb/> they are under emissions trading (or equal taxation) bound to be the last to be phased out.<lb/> However, the European Community requires all Member States to deliver 10 per cent of the<lb/> demand for road fuels in 2020 in the form of biofuels or electricity. Most States are expected<lb/> to respond by making the oil companies market diesel or gasoline that is blended with<lb/> renewable fuels such as biodiesel or ethanol. This low-blend may over time increase<lb/> somewhat. The assumption here is therefore that a mandatory blend of 20 per cent biofuel and<lb/> 80 per cent diesel or gasoline is the typical marginal road fuel during the depreciation period.<lb/> The below calculation is based on the assumption that the biofuels will reduce well-to-wheel<lb/> emissions by 65 per cent (i.e. 0.65 x 0.2 = 0.13). The fact that some cars and buses may run to<lb/> 100 per cent on biofuel is disregarded as focus is on the marginal effect on a system level.<lb/></p>

			<p>In the longer term there is an obvious risk, from a climate perspective, that scarcity pricing of<lb/> oil products will provide incentive for ventures in production of un-conventional oils from tar<lb/> sands and shales. The Economist reports a continuing high investment in Canadian tar sand<lb/> despite the financial crises. 10<lb/></p>

			<p>However, in countries and states where the government has adopted regulations that force the<lb/> oil companies to reduce the overall carbon intensity of the entire production chain,<lb/> unconventional oil is very unlikely to get a foothold. Gradually lowering the caps of trading<lb/> schemes will also make it difficult for these fuels to enter the market. They are therefore<lb/> disregarded in the context of this paper.<lb/></p>

			<head>Future emission factors<lb/> <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>			<figure>summarizes the results of the previous sections of this report and provides estimates<lb/> for the direct or indirect emissions of greenhouse gases from new vehicles and vessels by<lb/> 2025.<lb/></figure>

			<p>It may be surprising that the conventional car emits less than the electric car. This is due to the<lb/> assumption that it runs on 20 per cent biofuels. With 100 per cent diesel/gasoline the emission<lb/> would be 21 gram/seat km.<lb/></p>

			<p>The reader should be aware that the above figures and the calculations carried out below<lb/> disregard emissions to and from airports and train stations.<lb/></p>

			<head>Load factors<lb/></head>

			<p>To be able to compare passenger modes with each other one has to take account of differences<lb/> in load factors. Today, on average 45-70 per cent of the seats are occupied in intercity trains<lb/> with no or few stops at intermediate stations. Traditional airlines appear to have cabin factors<lb/> around 70 per cent. Where high speed rail is concerned, Network Rail (2009) reports load<lb/> factors for 12 different services in four countries, ranging from 42 to 88 per cent, with a<lb/> median value of 64. Regional trains and long-distance buses that stop at many stations have<lb/> difficulties filling vehicles over the entire distance. They seldom reach load factors above 50<lb/> per cent (<ref type="biblio">de Rus and Nash, 2007</ref>) although Swebus, in fierce competition with regional and<lb/> fast trains, reports 56 per cent (2008) for its Stockholm-Gothenburg service.<lb/></p>

			<p>However, new strategies are gathering ground. Low-cost airlines achieve high occupancy<lb/> rates by varying their prices, and traditional airlines and train operators are gradually learning<lb/> how to improve yield management. The below calculations are based on the assumption that<lb/></p>

			<table>18<lb/> P. Kageson — Discussion Paper 2009-28 — © OECD/ITF, 2009<lb/> the average load factor in 2025 is 80 per cent for regional aircraft, 75 per cent for high speed<lb/> trains, 65 per cent for conventional intercity trains and 55 per cent for long-distance<lb/> coaches. 11 The</table>

			<p>conventional intercity train is assumed (in the absence of a high speed service)<lb/> to make the same number of intermediate stops as the high speed train. The lower load factor<lb/> compared to high speed is explained by the fact that the latter will attract more passengers,<lb/> which will partly be used for offering more frequent services (see above) but will also to some<lb/> extent improve the average passenger density.<lb/></p>

			<p>The differing load factors for conventional trains (150 km/h) and high speed trains (280 km/h)<lb/> means that the latter would only consume 41 per cent more energy per pkm, down from a<lb/> difference of 60 per cent per seat km.<lb/> In many countries, on average only 1.2-1.5 people occupy the five seats of a passenger car.<lb/> However, the occupancy rate is higher for long-distance journeys than for daily commuting<lb/> and other local trips.</p>

			<table>Colleagues tend to share cars when traveling to far away business<lb/> meetings, and families often choose cars before trains and aircraft when on holiday trips.<lb/> Studies of the effect on car travel of introducing high speed rail use average car occupancy<lb/> rates in the range of 1.5-2.2 persons (CCAP &amp; CNT, 2006, Econ 2008a, ATOC, 2009). Thus,<lb/> this paper assumes that on average 2.0 persons travel together in cars on intercity journeys (=<lb/> 40% occupancy rate).<lb/> Table 4 shows the emissions from intercity journeys by new vessels and vehicles in 2025<lb/> when account has been taken for the average load factor.<lb/> Table 4.

			<head>Effects on greenhouse gas emissions from modal shift<lb/></head>

			<p>Politicians all over the world invest public money in new transport infrastructure and to the<lb/> extent that they do so in order to cut emissions of greenhouse gases they favor investment in<lb/> rail, including high speed lines. Making road transport shift from cars to buses would also cut<lb/> emissions but does not require new infrastructure. So it is really about rail. When considering<lb/> the effects on emissions of greenhouse gases from investing in new rail one must take account<lb/> of the following changes that may result from the investment:<lb/> 11<lb/> RSSB assumes 60 per cent for point-to-point services.<lb/></p>

			<head>P. Kageson — Discussion Paper 2009-28 — © OECD/ITF, 2009<lb/></head>

			<p>Diminishing emissions due to shifts from aviation and road transport to rail<lb/> Increasing emissions due to higher train speeds<lb/> Additional emissions resulting from new journeys that are generated by new and faster<lb/> services<lb/> The use of free capacity on pre-existing tracks when a new line is built<lb/></p>

			<p>The last issue concerns the opportunities of reducing emissions by using the old tracks for<lb/> extended freight transport and regional passenger traffic and will not be discussed here but in<lb/> a later section of report.<lb/></p>

			<p>It may be worth observing that the generation of new journeys means that passengers now<lb/> spend their time and money on something that in the absence of high speed rail they would<lb/> have used for some other purpose. However, there is no way of knowing what they might<lb/> have done and what the carbon intensity of that activity would have been. It is therefore<lb/> disregarded.<lb/></p>

			<p>The relative importance of the first three factors will depend on the circumstances in each<lb/> case. A high speed line that replaces a very inefficient line that only allows average speeds of<lb/> 80 km will attract more new traffic than a line that is a supplement to or replacement for an<lb/> existing service in, say, 150 km/h.<lb/></p>

			<p>The high speed line between Madrid and Seville (471 km) attracted 5.6 million travelers in<lb/> 2000, seven years after it was opened. The market share for trains rose from 14 per cent in<lb/> 1991 to 54 per cent, while aviation shrank from 11 to 4 per cent, cars from 60 to 34 and buses<lb/> from 15 to 8 per cent (<ref type="biblio">Nelldal et al, 2003</ref>). However, at the same time the number of journeys<lb/> grew by an annual average of approximately 5 per cent, and as a consequence, the number of<lb/> trips by aviation, car and bus declined much less. The figures indicate that opening the new<lb/> line must have attracted a great deal of new journeys that would not in its absence have taken<lb/> place. High speed in combination with modest prices allows people to make trips that they<lb/> under previous circumstances would not have contemplated, for instance seeing friends more<lb/> often, having meetings instead of talking over the phone or attending football matches.<lb/></p>

			<p>In the case of Madrid-Seville, travel time by train was cut by half, from 5 to 2.5 hours (UIC,<lb/></p>

			<figure>2008). Investment in high speed rail does not always result in such reduction. High speed<lb/> lines between Stockholm and Gothenburg (460 km) and Stockholm and Malmoe (615 km),<lb/> Sweden&apos;s three largest cities, are expected to cut travel times by respectively 27 and 44 per<lb/> cent (from 2:45 to 2:00 hours in the case of Stockholm-Gothenburg). An investigation on<lb/> behalf of the Swedish government (UOH, 2009) nevertheless thinks that the investment (a<lb/> combination of the two new lines) would result in:<lb/> 7.7 billion more pkm by rail;<lb/> 1.6 billion pkm less by aviation;<lb/> 3.1 billion pkm less by car;<lb/> 0.1 billion pkm less by bus.<lb/></figure>

			<p>This means deviated traffic would amount to 4.8 billion pkm per year, and that the high speed<lb/> links would generate 2.9 billion pkm in the form of new intercity trips. The latter constitute<lb/> 38 per cent of the total expected increase in passenger transport by rail. However, the high<lb/> figure for traffic diverted from cars could be put in question. Why would so many prefer rail<lb/> because of higher speed when the existing rail services between the three cities are already<lb/> substantially faster than the cars?<lb/></p>

			<p>In a study for the Norwegian Government, VWI (2007) estimates that building a high-speed<lb/> link between Oslo and Trondheim (464 km) would result in the changes shown in <ref type="table">Table 5</ref>.<lb/> Interestingly in this case, travel diverted from cars to rail is expected be quite small, and the<lb/> share that consists of new traffic is also smaller despite a more substantial travel time<lb/> reduction than in the Swedish case.<lb/></p>

			<figure>Table 5.

			<p>CCAP and CNT (2006) expect diversion from cars to on average account for 47 per cent of<lb/> total traffic on 12 future American high speed lines, with aviation contributing only 19 per<lb/> cent and current trains 20 per cent. Such high figures for cars is presumably explained by the<lb/> fact that cars have a dominating position over medium distances in the United States and that<lb/> rail services in some cases do not really exist.<lb/></p>

			<p>To be able to calculate how modal shift may affect emissions of greenhouse gases it is<lb/> necessary to make an assumption concerning the split between cars with internal combustion<lb/> engines and electric cars and plug-in hybrids. As the methodology of this paper is based on<lb/> the emissions from new vehicles in 2025, one must base the assumption on how new sales in<lb/> 2025 may be divided on different types of engines. It is assumed that traditional cars<lb/> (including electric hybrids that cannot plug-in) make up 40 per cent of the market, plug-in<lb/> electric vehicles 40 per cent and all-electric cars 20 per cent. The plug-in cars are assumed to<lb/> run half of their annual mileage on grid electricity but as they can store only a limited amount<lb/> of electricity on board, one must assume that only a tenth of an intercity journey by such a car<lb/> is in electric mode. Presumably many of the battery cars will be bought for local and regional<lb/> use rather than for long-distance journeys (some families will own more than one car). It thus<lb/> makes sense to suppose that these cars will represent less than 20 per cent of the intercity<lb/> traffic. We assume that the share is 10 per cent. That means that the share of grid electricity<lb/> will only be 14 per cent for new cars in 2025 and that the average emission per pkm will be<lb/> 46.8 gram.<lb/></p>

			<figure>In order to get an idea of how investment in new rail infrastructure may affect emissions of<lb/> greenhouse gases a fictitious example is shown in table 6. It shows the result on emissions<lb/> some years after the inauguration of a new high speed line when the service speed increases<lb/> from 150 km/h on an existing line to 280 km/h. The example is based on the assumption that<lb/> traffic consists of 30 per cent pre-existent train travelers, 20 per cent diverted from aviation,<lb/> 20 per cent from cars and 5 per cent from buses. The remaining 25 per cent are assumed to be<lb/> newly generated. The table shows the result per 1 million one-way trips between cities located<lb/> 500 km apart.<lb/> Table 6.

			<head>Valuing CO 2<lb/></head>

			<p>The positive effect on climate change of investing in modal shift depends to some extent on<lb/> the value put on carbon.<lb/></p>

			<p>Provided that cap-and-trade systems become a favored method for limiting the emissions of<lb/> greenhouse gases and that these systems are linked to each other, there will in future be a<lb/> (more or less) global price on CO 2 . The economic value of achieving net reductions by<lb/> investing in modal shift will thus depend on the future price of carbon. Depending on the<lb/> stringency of the caps and technological development the long-term price may fall anywhere<lb/> in the range of $30-80 per ton. However, by 2025 it is less likely to be much higher than<lb/> $40-50 per ton CO 2 . That means that the socio-economic benefit from reducing emissions as<lb/> indicated in <ref type="table">Table 6</ref>			<figure>would only amount to $7.0-8.8 million when total annual traffic amounts<lb/> to 20 million journeys per annum.<lb/></figure>

			<head>Sensitivity analysis<lb/></head>

			<p>Varying some of the main parameters 10 per cent up or down does not provide results that<lb/> differ enough from the main calculation to justify a differing conclusion. Not even combining<lb/> several optimistic assumptions in favor of high speed rail makes much difference. Reducing<lb/> the marginal climate effect from electricity consumption by half and raising the share of total<lb/> traffic that is diverted from aviation to 30 per cent (and reducing the car share to 10%) would<lb/> in combination reduce emissions for every one million trips to 16,167 ton CO 2 . Assuming<lb/> very high figures for air traffic diversion does not make sense. It is not possible to replace<lb/> more than 100 per cent of aviation and in most cases airlines will be able to keep 20 or 30 per<lb/> cent of their customers. Assuming fewer generated journeys means emissions will fall<lb/> somewhat, but at the same time an important part of the market for high speed rail disappears.<lb/></p>

			<p>Not even disregarding completely the environmental impact of electricity consumption (as the<lb/> Swedish Rail Administration wants it) would reduce emissions per one million single<lb/> journeys by more than 16,000 to 20,000 ton, depending on whether the share diverted from<lb/> aviation is set at 20 or 30 per cent. Multiplying the highest figure by 10 or 20 to get the annual<lb/> contribution from a high speed line does not add up to more than approximately 0.2 to<lb/> 0.4 million tons per year.<lb/></p>

			<p>Calculating the emissions year by year throughout the entire depreciation period of the new<lb/> infrastructure and discounting the cost to present day net value might produce a differing<lb/> result, especially at a high discount rate. The marginal CO 2 emissions from electricity<lb/> production will probably be higher in the short term but the price of carbon will, on the other<lb/> hand, be lower. Using a shadow price on carbon may argue in favor of a rather high discount<lb/> rate as it is essential to start cutting emissions soon in order to avoid the earth from warming<lb/></p>

			<p>The calculations have been based on tank-to-wheel emissions and overhead wires-to-wheels,<lb/> plus the emissions from electricity production (disregarding emissions from coal and gas<lb/> extraction and grid losses). A well-to-wheel approach would not have produced significantly<lb/> different results, not even in a case when the well-tank/well-to-wire emissions were twice as<lb/> large for fuels than for electricity.<lb/> An important parameter that was disregarded in the above calculations is the impact on short-<lb/>term emissions of building a new railway line. Building a 500 km long high speed line may<lb/> cause emissions of several million ton CO 2eqv. (<ref type="biblio">Norges Naturvernforbund, 2008</ref>, and Network<lb/> rail, 2009), and even if these emissions are balanced by reduced overall emissions in the<lb/> longer term, they do have a short-term impact on the atmospheric concentration of greenhouse<lb/> gases. There is thus an obvious risk that investment in high speed rail will add to the<lb/> difficulties of keeping the atmospheric content of greenhouse gases at a level that prevents the<lb/> mean global temperature from exceeding its pre-industrial level by more than 2 degrees<lb/> Celsius. From a climate point of view it might be better to up-grade existing lines and to try to<lb/> make people use modern telecommunications rather than investing lots of money in making<lb/> us travel more.<lb/></p>

			<head>Freeing space for freight transport -the Swedish case<lb/></head>

			<p>Building a completely new high speed line means traffic will be diverted from the pre-<lb/>existing rail network. Thus capacity on those tracks can be used for other types of trains,<lb/> provided, of course, that demand for such services exist. The situation is often complex and<lb/> the optimal solution may differ greatly from case to case. The Swedish case discussed below<lb/> should just be seen as one example.<lb/> In Sweden, freeing capacity for freight transport is a major argument for constructing new<lb/> high speed lines between Stockholm and respectively Gothenburg and Malmoe. However,<lb/> before taking the step to invest in these high speed rail lines, there is cause to investigate<lb/> whether capacity problems in rail freight transport can be overcome by other and less<lb/> expensive measures. Improved signaling systems and investment in passing siding may<lb/> increase substantially the capacity of an existing track (<ref type="biblio">Nilsson and Pydokke, 2009</ref>).<lb/> In the Swedish case, part of the congestion on the Stockholm-Gothenburg line is caused by<lb/> containers being transported across the country from the Port of Gothenburg. Most of the<lb/> containerized goods transported to and from the greater Stockholm area travel via<lb/> 24<lb/></p>

			<head>P. Kageson — Discussion Paper 2009-28 — © OECD/ITF, 2009<lb/></head>

			<p>Gothenburg, despite the fact that most of it comes from or is destined to far-off places like<lb/> China. The Port of Stockholm in now investing in a new container port, located close to the<lb/> open sea, in order to compete for this market. Hutchinson Port Holdings will run the terminal<lb/> in connection with its operations in Rotterdam.<lb/></p>

			<p>In addition a greater part of goods entering or leaving northern Sweden could use short-sea<lb/> shipping. Improving the Swedish rail infrastructure at high cost does not make much sense so<lb/> long as the freight trains cannot continue through Denmark to destinations on the European<lb/> continent. There will be limited rail capacity over the Sound and Fehmarn Belt even after the<lb/> completion of the Fehmarn Belt Bridge (Rødby-Puttgarten) in 2018.<lb/></p>

			<p>However, one restraint on short-sea shipping is that the government enforces fairway dues on<lb/> all ships calling at Swedish ports, and that these fees recover not only the short-term marginal<lb/> costs but also the fixed infrastructure costs. Freight trains, on the other side, enjoy Europe&apos;s<lb/> lowest track fees that do not even cover the short-term marginal cost, much less the costs<lb/> associated with expanding the infrastructure. Sweden could level the playing field by<lb/> enforcing the same principle of liability on all modes. This implies raising the track fee for<lb/> trains and introducing kilometre-charging on heavy goods vehicles, which several Member<lb/> States of the EU have already done or are in the process of doing.<lb/></p>

			<p>The Swedish example does not apply to other countries or regions, unless they have similar<lb/> conditions. In other parts of the world other alternative solutions may be more relevant, for<lb/> instance increasing the use of inland-waterways and/or pipelines. &quot; Gigaliners &quot; fuelled by grid<lb/> electricity might be an option in regions where the motorways are not crowded. Electrifying a<lb/> motorway would not involve excessive cost or high emissions of CO 2 .<lb/></p>

			<head>Conclusions<lb/></head>

			<p>There is no cause to prohibit investment in high speed rail on environmental grounds so long<lb/> as the carbon gains made in traffic balances the emissions caused during construction. The rail<lb/> sector, however, often claims that investment in rail infrastructure will bring large<lb/> environmental benefits (<ref type="biblio">Banverket, 2008, UNIFE 2008, UIC 2008</ref>). Independent research, on<lb/> the other hand, concludes that these benefits are not so important (<ref type="biblio">de Rus, 2008</ref>, WSP and<lb/> KTH Järnvägsgruppen, 2008, Nilsson and Pydokke, 2009). The results of this report support<lb/> the latter view.<lb/> Investment in high speed rail cannot be expected to contribute much to climate change<lb/> mitigation. Investment in conventional fast trains may in some circumstances be significantly<lb/> more beneficial. It may be time for many environmentalists to reconsider their attitude to high<lb/> speed rail. While in some cases calling for huge investment in high speed rail, the<lb/> environmental organizations want speed restrictions for road vehicles to be tightened, aircraft<lb/> to be designed for lower speeds and ship operators to involve in slow-steaming.<lb/></p>

			<p>The cost of building high speed lines is high, €9-40 million per km according to de Rus<lb/> (2008), and 12-30 million according to UIC (2008). de Rus puts the average cost at €18<lb/> million. Huge traffic volumes appear to be the only way to recover these costs. The principal<lb/> benefits of high speed rail are time savings, additional capacity and generated traffic. Wider<lb/> economic benefits may also be important, however, difficult to estimate. The strongest case<lb/> for high speed rail is where traffic volumes are high (<ref type="biblio">de Rus and Nash, 2007</ref>).<lb/> &quot; Only under exceptional circumstances (a combination of low construction costs plus high<lb/> time savings) could a new HSR line be justified with a level of patronage below 6 million<lb/> passengers per annum in the opening year; with typical construction costs and timer savings, a<lb/> minimum figure of 9 million passengers per annum is likely to be needed &quot; (European<lb/> Commission, 2008).<lb/> The conclusion of this paper is that investment in high speed rail is under most circumstances<lb/> likely to reduce greenhouse gases from traffic compared to a situation when the line was not<lb/> built. The reduction, though, is small and it may take decades for it to compensate for the<lb/> emissions caused by construction. However, where capacity restraints and large transport<lb/> volumes justify investment in high speed rail this will not cause overall emissions to rise.<lb/></p>

			<p>In cases where anticipated journey volumes are low it is not only difficult to justify the<lb/> investment in economical terms, but it may also be hard to defend the project from an<lb/> environmental point of view as it will take too long for traffic to offset the emissions caused<lb/> by building the line. Under such circumstances it may be better to upgrade an existing line to<lb/> accommodate for somewhat higher speeds as this would minimize emissions from<lb/> construction and cut emissions from train traffic compared to high speed rail.</p>
