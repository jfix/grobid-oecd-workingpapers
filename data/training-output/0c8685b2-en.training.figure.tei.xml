This initiative,<lb/> established by the Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI) Programme of Research Investigating<lb/> Consumer Evaluation (PRICE) Lab, is jointly funded by the Central Bank, the Competition and Consumer<lb/> Protection Commission (merger of the former National Consumer Agency and Competition Authority), the<lb/> Commission for Energy Regulation and Commission for Communications Regulation. The programme is<lb/> overseen by a Steering Group comprising representatives of each of the four funding partners, an independent<lb/> international academic expert, a senior representative from the ESRI and the Principal Investigator.</figDesc>

            <figDesc>Learning in the Credit Card Market -Sumit Agarwal, John C. Driscoll, Xavier Gabaix and David<lb/> Laibson, 2013<lb/> The paper measures learning dynamics using a panel with four million monthly credit card<lb/> statements. It studies add-on fees, specifically cash advance, late payment, and over-limit fees. New<lb/> credit card accounts generate fee payments of over USD 16 per month. Through negative feedback —<lb/> i.e. paying a fee — consumers learn to avoid triggering future fees. Paying a fee last month reduces<lb/> the likelihood of paying a fee this month by about 40%. Controlling for account fixed effects, monthly<lb/> fee payments fall by 75% during the first three years of account life. We find that learning is not<lb/> monotonic. Knowledge depreciates about 10% per month, implying that learning displays a strong<lb/> recency effect.<lb/> The Nature of the Beast: What Behavioral Economics Is Not -Matthew Darling, Saugato Datta,<lb/> and Sendhil Mullainathan, The Center for Global Development, 2013</figDesc>

As part of the discussion, the European Consumer<lb/> Organisation, BEUC, recognised the value of behavourial economics but underlined that more market<lb/> failures which generate consumers&apos; vulnerability have been so far insufficiently addressed by<lb/> policymakers, for example: (artificial) complexity of financial products, tying of products or conflicts<lb/> of interests arising from commissions and remuneration schemes. The Financial Conduct Authority<lb/> highlighted that the UK has developed a model for regulatory analysis which looks at markets in the<lb/> round by exploring the interaction of behavioural market failures, structural competition issues,<lb/> information asymmetries, externalities and regulatory failures.
