			<body>SKILLS MISMATCH, PRODUCTIVITY AND POLICIES: EVIDENCE FROM THE SECOND <lb/>WAVE OF PIAAC <lb/>By Müge Adalet McGowan and Dan Andrews 1 <lb/>1. <lb/>Introduction <lb/>Raising productivity growth is highly dependent on a country&apos;s ability to innovate and adopt new <lb/>technologies, which requires an effective supply of human capital. While increases in the stock of highly <lb/>educated workers have significantly boosted labour productivity over the past 50 years, the rate of increase <lb/>in the stock of human capital is projected to slow (Braconier et al., 2014). In this context, the ability of <lb/>economies to efficiently deploy their existing stock of human capital will become increasingly important. <lb/>However, skills mismatch indicators derived from the OECD Survey of Adult Skills, a product of the <lb/>Programme for the International Assessment of Adult Competencies (PIAAC), show that on average <lb/>across countries, around one-quarter of workers report a mismatch between their existing skills and those <lb/>required for their job, implying that there is considerable scope to improve the efficiency of human capital <lb/>allocation in OECD countries. Furthermore, skills mismatch has the potential to explain a non-trivial share <lb/>of cross-country labour productivity gaps (Adalet McGowan and Andrews, 2015a), and differences in skill <lb/>mismatch across countries are associated with differences in the policy environment (Adalet McGowan <lb/>and Andrews, 2015b). <lb/>This paper extends our earlier analysis of the relationship between skills mismatch, productivity and <lb/>public policies to include seven additional countries, including New Zealand, for which PIAAC results <lb/>were recently released (OECD, 2016). We find that the percentage of workers who are mismatched in <lb/>terms of skills at 28% in New Zealand, is slightly greater than the OECD average of 25%. The share of <lb/>over-skilling is around the OECD average at 18%, while the share of under-skilling at around 10% is also <lb/>above the OECD average of 7%. The results suggest that improving the allocation of skills to OECD best <lb/>practice could be associated with an increase in productivity of around 7% in New Zealand. <lb/>The inclusion of the additional countries in the cross-country analysis yields similar results to those in <lb/>Adalet McGowan and Andrews (2015b), which covered 22 countries from the first wave of PIAAC results. <lb/>After controlling for individual and job characteristics, skills mismatch is found to be lower in countries <lb/>with well-designed framework conditions that promote efficient reallocation and housing policies that do <lb/>not impede residential mobility. Lower mismatch is also associated with higher participation in lifelong <lb/>learning and better managerial quality. While New Zealand performs well in many of the policies found to <lb/>be associated with skill mismatch, there is scope to improve the allocation of skills by moving policies to <lb/>the OECD best practice. <lb/>The paper proceeds as follows. The next section defines the mismatch indicators and presents some <lb/>industry-level evidence on the links between mismatch and productivity. Section 3 outlines the empirical <lb/>methodology, baseline results, robustness tests and the economic significance of the effects of policies on <lb/>mismatch. Section 4 concludes. <lb/>1. <lb/>Corresponding authors are: Müge Adalet McGowan (Muge.AdaletMcGowan@oecd.org) and Dan <lb/>Andrews (Dan.Andrews@oecd.org) from the OECD Economics Department.

			<body>2. <lb/>Skills mismatch and productivity <lb/>2.1 <lb/>Measuring skills mismatch <lb/>The Survey of Adult Skills assesses the proficiency of adults aged between 16 and 65 in literacy, <lb/>numeracy and problem solving in technology-rich environments in OECD member and partner countries <lb/>(see Box A1 in the Appendix for details). The first round, conducted between 2008 and 2013, included <lb/>Australia, Austria, Belgium (Flanders), Canada, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, <lb/>Germany, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Korea, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, the Russian Federation, the <lb/>Slovak Republic, Spain, Sweden, the United Kingdom (England and Northern Ireland) and the United <lb/>States. The second round that took place between 2012 and 2016, added Chile, Greece, Indonesia, Israel, <lb/>Lithuania, New Zealand, Singapore, Slovenia and Turkey 2 . Besides the level of skills, information was <lb/>collected on the background of respondents, their education and labour market experience, their skill use at <lb/>work and at home plus indicators of well-being. The Survey has a number of advantages over comparable <lb/>datasets as it extends the number of countries, sample size per country and the range of assessed skills. <lb/>Skills mismatch can be measured in several ways, each with their advantages and disadvantages (see <lb/>Box 1). One is through self-assessment by asking workers to compare their skills level and that required <lb/>for their job. Another approach is to compare the skills levels – as measured by proficiency scores – to <lb/>skills use at work. A final approach, developed in OECD (2013) and employed in this analysis, combines <lb/>information on self-reported skills mismatch and quantitative information on skills proficiency following <lb/>Adalet McGowan and Andrews (2015a): <lb/>• The (literacy) proficiency scores of workers who report themselves as well-matched – <lb/>i.e. those who neither feel they have the skills to perform a more demanding job nor <lb/>feel the need for further training in order to be able to perform their current job <lb/>satisfactorily – are used to create a quantitative scale of the skills required to perform <lb/>the job for each occupation (based on 1-digit ISCO codes) 3 . <lb/> • Using this scale of proficiency scores of well-matched workers, minimum and <lb/>maximum threshold values – based on the 10th and 90th percentile, for example – are <lb/>identified, which effectively provide the bounds that define what it is to be a well-<lb/>matched worker 4 . <lb/> • Respondents whose scores are lower (higher) than this minimum (maximum) threshold <lb/>in their occupation and country, are classified as under-(over-) skilled. By contrast, <lb/>respondents whose proficiency scores reside within these bounds are not counted as <lb/>mismatched, regardless of whether they self-report as being well-matched or <lb/>mismatched.<lb/>2. <lb/>In the following empirical analysis, Indonesia, Singapore and the Russian Federation are not included. <lb/>3. <lb/>Literacy is defined as the ability to understand, evaluate, use and engage with written texts to participate in <lb/>society, to achieve one&apos;s goals and to develop one&apos;s knowledge and potential. <lb/>4. <lb/>OECD (2013) uses different threshold values based on the 5th and 95th percentiles. <lb/></body>

			<body>Box 1. Alternate approaches to measuring skills mismatch <lb/>There are several ways to measure skills mismatch. One is to ask workers to assess themselves on their <lb/>skill level and that required for their job. While this self-assessment method addresses the issue of partial <lb/>measurement of skills (such as those based only on numeracy or literacy), it does not identify specific skills <lb/>deficits or excesses. Furthermore, there is some evidence that skills deficits are hard to measure using this <lb/>method (Allen and van der Velden, 2001). Indeed, PIAAC data show that the incidence of under-skilling is <lb/>much lower than that of over-skilling. Another approach is to directly measure the skills of individual workers, <lb/>most commonly, literacy and numeracy, and to compare them with skills use at work (CEDEFOP, 2010; <lb/>Desjardins and Rubenson, 2011). Such measures are subject to two main drawbacks. First, they assume that <lb/>skills use can be a proxy for job requirements. Second, skills proficiency and skills use are based on different <lb/>theoretical concepts and are hard to measure on the same scale. In fact, skills proficiency and skills use are <lb/>calculated by using structurally different types of information as the indicators of skills proficiency are based on <lb/>cognitive tests, whereas those of skills use exploit survey questions on the frequency with which specific tasks <lb/>are carried out. A final approach is to combine information on self-reported skills mismatch and skills <lb/>proficiency as developed in OECD (2013) – which is exploited in this paper. The main limitation of this measure <lb/>is that it uses 1-digit occupation codes because of sample size, thus assuming that all jobs with the same <lb/>occupation code have the same skills requirements. However, it does carry a number of advantages, to the <lb/>extent that it addresses the drawbacks associated with the other approaches outlined above (See Pelizzari and <lb/>Fichen (2013) for a more detailed description of the construction of this skills mismatch indicator). <lb/>2.2 <lb/>Cross-country differences in skills mismatch are significant <lb/>Indicators of skills mismatch suggest that there is considerable scope to improve the efficiency of <lb/>human capital allocation in OECD economies. For example, on average across countries, roughly one-<lb/>quarter of workers report a mismatch between their existing skills and those required for their job; i.e. they <lb/>are either over-or under-skilled. Moreover, important cross-country differences emerge, with the incidence <lb/>of skills mismatch ranging from around 40% in Greece and Chile to less than 20% in Sweden and the <lb/>United States (Figure 1, Panel A). In New Zealand, the incidence of skills mismatch at 28% is slightly <lb/>above the OECD average. Across OECD countries, over-skilling is generally more common than under-<lb/>skilling, on average roughly two and a half times (Panel B). In New Zealand, the share of over-skilling is <lb/>around the OECD average at 18%, while the share of under-skilling at around 10% is also above the <lb/>OECD average of 7%. <lb/>ECO/WKP(2017)35 <lb/></body>

			<body>Figure 1. Cross-country differences in skill mismatch <lb/>Panel A: Percentage of workers with skill mismatch; selected OECD countries, 2011-12 <lb/>* <lb/>Panel B: Components of skill mismatch; selected OECD countries, 2011-12 <lb/>* <lb/>Note: The figure shows the percentage of workers who are either over-or under-skilled for a sample of 11 market industries: <lb/>manufacturing; electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply; water supply; construction; wholesale and retail trade; <lb/>transportation and storage; accommodation and food service activities; information and communication; real estate activities; <lb/>professional, scientific and technical activities, and administrative and support service activities. In order to abstract from differences <lb/>in industrial structures across countries, the 1-digit industry level mismatch indicators are aggregated using a common set of weights <lb/>based on industry employment shares for the United States. * For Chile, Greece, Indonesia, Israel, Lithuania, New Zealand, Slovenia <lb/>and Turkey, the data was collected in 2014-2015. <lb/>Source: OECD calculations based on the Survey of Adult Skills (2012 and 2015). <lb/>2.3 <lb/>Skill mismatch and cross-country gaps in labour productivity <lb/>Using an industry-level analysis, Adalet McGowan and Andrews (2015a) shows that higher skills <lb/>mismatch is associated with lower labour productivity performance, with over-skilling being particularly <lb/>costly. The negative association between over-skilling and labour productivity is driven through the <lb/>channel of less efficient resource allocation. From the perspective of any given firm, hiring an over-skilled <lb/>worker may be beneficial for productivity, assuming there are no adverse effects on job satisfaction and the <lb/>higher wages do not more than offset any associated productivity gains. From the perspective of the <lb/>economy as a whole, however, the impacts may be very different. Assuming that wages do not adjust to <lb/>these frictions in the short run, mismatch could have reallocation effects, if skilled labour is clogged up in <lb/>low productivity firms. In this case, the more productive firms remain smaller than otherwise, lowering <lb/></body>

			<body>aggregate productivity relative to a situation where workers are reallocated to achieve a more efficient set <lb/>of matches. <lb/>Indeed, Adalet McGowan and Andrews (2015a) finds that in industries with a higher share of over-<lb/>skilled workers, the more productive firms find it more difficult to attract suitable labour in order to expand <lb/>their operations. At the same time, skills mismatch has the potential to explain a non-trivial share of cross-<lb/>country labour productivity gaps. For example, Italy – a country with high skills mismatch and low <lb/>allocative efficiency – could boost its level of labour productivity by around 10% and potentially close <lb/>one-fifth of its gap in allocative efficiency with the United States if it were to reduce its level of mismatch <lb/>within each industry to that corresponding to the OECD best practice (Figure 2). <lb/>More speculatively, the same exercise can be extended to countries that are not in the empirical <lb/>analysis linking mismatch to productivity due to lack of productivity data, but are included in the PIAAC <lb/>sample. Applying the coefficient estimates from that analysis suggests that lowering the skills mismatch to <lb/>best practice could be associated with an increase in allocative efficiency of 7.2% for New Zealand. It is <lb/>not possible to calculate how much reducing skills mismatch can explain cross-country productivity gaps <lb/>for New Zealand due to a lack of publicly available firm-level productivity data. <lb/>Figure 2. Counterfactual productivity gains from reducing skill mismatch <lb/>Simulated gains to allocative efficiency from lowering skill mismatch to the best practice; per cent <lb/>Note: The chart shows the difference between the actual allocative efficiency and a counterfactual outcome based on lowering the <lb/>skills mismatch in each country to the best practice. 1-digit industry level mismatch indicators are aggregated using a common set of <lb/>weights based on the industry employment shares for the United States. The estimated coefficient of impact of mismatch on <lb/>productivity is based on a sample of 19 countries for which both firm-level productivity and mismatch data are available (Austria, <lb/>Belgium, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Korea, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, <lb/>the Slovak Republic, Spain, Sweden, the United Kingdom and the United States). The estimated gains to allocative efficiency for the <lb/>other countries should be interpreted with caution to the extent that they are not included in the econometric analysis due to missing <lb/>productivity data. <lb/>Source: OECD calculations based on the Survey of Adult Skills (2012 and 2015). <lb/>3. <lb/>Empirical model and results <lb/>The estimates above suggest that skills mismatch is one factor that may contribute to explaining cross-<lb/>country differences in labour productivity. Hence, it is important to consider what factors explain it. <lb/>According to the theoretical and empirical literature, mismatch will be shaped by two key factors: i) <lb/>individual and workplace/job characteristics (e.g. age, migrant status, firm size); and ii) policy-induced <lb/>ECO/WKP(2017)35 <lb/></body>

			<page>10 <lb/></page>

			<body>distortions to labour mobility (see Adalet McGowan and Andrews (2015b) for a detailed discussion on the <lb/>literature on these different factors). <lb/>3.1 <lb/>Empirical model <lb/>The link between individual background characteristics and mismatch is investigated by estimating <lb/>the following binomial logit specification for New Zealand: <lb/>í µí±í µí±í µí±í µí±í µí±í µí± í µí±í µí± = Φ( í µí»¿í µí»¿ 1 + í µí»¿í µí»¿ 2 í µí°¼í µí°¼ í µí±í µí± + í µí¼í µí¼ í µí±í µí± ) <lb/>(1) <lb/>where Φ is the normal distribution, i denotes an individual and SMM i denotes the probability that an <lb/>individual i is mismatched (SMM=1 if an individual i is over-or under-skilled; we also estimate separate <lb/>models for over-skilling and under-skilling). The explanatory variables include a vector of individual <lb/>characteristics, I, which are likely to influence mismatch. These include: age category (15-24, 25-34, 35-<lb/>44, 45-54 and 55-65), gender (1 if the person is male, 0 otherwise), nationality (1 if national, 0 if foreign <lb/>born), marital status (1 if married, 0 otherwise), education (categorical variable measuring if the person has <lb/>lower secondary, upper secondary, post-secondary or tertiary education), firm size (1-10, 11-50, 51-250, <lb/>251-999 and 1000+ employees), contract type (indefinite, fixed and temporary agency/apprenticeship/no <lb/>contract), full-time (1 if the person is employed full-time, 0 otherwise) and organisation type (1 if private <lb/>firm, 0 if public sector or NGO). <lb/>The empirical approach also exploits cross-country variation in policies and institutions to assess the <lb/>role of policy settings in explaining skills mismatch. To consider these policies, the following cross-<lb/>country specification is estimated: <lb/>í µí±í µí±í µí±í µí±í µí±í µí± í µí±í µí±,í µí±í µí± = Φ( í µí»¿í µí»¿ 1 + í µí»¿í µí»¿ 2 í µí°¼í µí°¼ í µí±í µí±,í µí±í µí± + í µí»¿í µí»¿ 3 í µí±í µí± í µí±í µí± + í µí»¿í µí»¿ 4 í µí° ¶í µí° ¶ í µí±í µí± + í µí¼í µí¼ í µí±í µí±,í µí±í µí± ) <lb/>(2) <lb/>where SMM is a measure of whether individual i in country c is over-or under-skilled, I denotes the <lb/>vector of individual characteristics outlined above, P denotes country-specific policies (see Table A1 in <lb/>Annex for the list of policies) and C denotes country-specific control variables, including total national <lb/>income. <lb/>The strong negative relationship between skills mismatch (i.e. over-skilling) and labour productivity <lb/>via the allocative efficiency channel (Adalet McGowan and Andrews, 2015a) suggests that policy <lb/>determinants of skills mismatch should focus particularly on those policy factors that impose frictions on <lb/>the efficient reallocation of labour. Accordingly, in this paper only a subset of potentially relevant policies <lb/>(framework, housing, education and labour market) for which indicators are readily available are covered, <lb/>but a range of other policies (e.g. vocational education and training and the matching of available <lb/>university programmes to labour market needs) that are more difficult to measure may also matter. Of <lb/>course, policies to increase human capital accumulation, such as investment in higher education, are also <lb/>important (Braconier et al., 2014). <lb/>The estimation of equation (2) treats policies as exogenous factors affecting mismatch, but there may <lb/>be reason to be concerned about endogeneity. Causation is difficult to establish, given data limitations: i) <lb/>the data are available only at one point in time; and ii) due to high correlations among the policy variables, <lb/>the baseline analysis includes the policy variables one at a time. Nevertheless, a number of robust <lb/>correlations between policy variables and skills mismatch emerge (see below). <lb/>3.2 <lb/>The effect of individual and job characteristics on skill mismatch <lb/>Table 1 reports the baseline results of estimating Equation (1) for the probability of skills mismatch <lb/>(Column 1), over-skilling (Column 2) and under-skilling (Column 3) for New Zealand. Table A2 presents <lb/></body>

			<body>the same results for the pooled cross-country regressions. The reported coefficients are marginal effects <lb/>and can be interpreted as the impact of a unit change in the explanatory variable on the probability of skills <lb/>mismatch in New Zealand. These changes are relative to the probability of skills mismatch of the excluded <lb/>individual: married, male, native-born, young worker with low education attainment, working in a small <lb/>firm on an indefinite contract. <lb/>In New Zealand, there is no significant relationship between gender and skills mismatch (Table 1). <lb/>Across OECD countries, females are less likely to be mismatched in terms of skills (Table A2, Column 1). <lb/>Furthermore, this is mainly driven by the fact that females are less likely to be over-skilled (Table A2, <lb/>Column 2), while the relationship between gender and under-skilling is not significant. Both of these <lb/>results are contrary to the assumption that women are more likely to be over-skilled/qualified because of <lb/>family constraints or the wish to improve their work-life balance. <lb/>Table 1 shows that the probability of skills mismatch is lower for immigrants in New Zealand <lb/>(Column 1). Looking at the components of mismatch reveals that immigrants are less likely to be over-<lb/>skilled (Column 2), while they are more likely to be under-skilled (Column 3) 5 . The heterogeneity of the <lb/>migrant population could lead to different conclusions on the relationship between being foreign-born and <lb/>the probability of skills mismatch. However, the relatively low share of migrants in the sample makes a <lb/>more differentiated analysis of this link difficult. <lb/>Many OECD economies, especially those with segmented labour markets, have difficulties in <lb/>successfully integrating young people into the labour market both by getting them out of unemployment <lb/>and matching them to the right jobs. Over-skilling could be more common amongst youth since they are <lb/>more likely to be employed in temporary or entry-level jobs where skill demands could be low (Allen et <lb/>al., 2013; OECD, 2013). There is some evidence that the degree of mismatch should improve with <lb/>experience, as workers get more experience and relevant information on job market opportunities (Alba-<lb/>Ramirez, 1993; Desjardins and Rubenson, 2011). The literature on the links between skills mismatch and <lb/>other individual characteristics such as gender, marital and migrant status remains inconclusive, but it is <lb/>important to control for these different aspects of a worker&apos;s background that can be linked to their <lb/>probability of being mismatched. <lb/>Consistent with the literature and the results for OECD countries (Table A2), in New Zealand, skills <lb/>mismatch decreases with age, as workers gain more experience and/or move into jobs that have a better fit <lb/>with their skills levels (Table 1, Column 1). Additionally, it could be the case that workers whose over-<lb/>skilling is beneficial for firm productivity are more likely to be promoted to a job matching their skills as <lb/>they get older. Furthermore, older workers are less likely to be over-skilled (Column 2) and more likely to <lb/>be under-skilled (Column 3), as skills learned at school tend to depreciate and to become obsolete over <lb/>time. Young people, on the other hand, are more likely to be over-skilled as they may be in entry-level jobs <lb/>where skills requirements do not meet their actual skills. <lb/>In New Zealand, as the educational attainment of the worker goes up, skills mismatch increases <lb/>(Table 1, Column 1), whereas the cross-country results show that workers with tertiary education are more <lb/>likely to have skills mismatch compared to the base category of workers with lower secondary education <lb/>(Table A2, Column 1). Looking at the components of mismatch shows that over-skilling increases with the <lb/>level of education for all categories (Column 2), while the opposite is true for under-skilling (Column 3). <lb/>The higher rates of over-skilling amongst more educated workers could be a result of firm decisions. <lb/>4. <lb/>The relationship between migrant status and over-skilling differs from the finding in the literature that <lb/>immigrants are more likely to be over-qualified. The low overlap between over-qualification and over-<lb/>skilling suggests that even if employers are not able to recognise foreign qualifications (resulting in over-<lb/>qualification), they could be more successful in utilising the skills of the migrant workers effectively. <lb/></body>

			<body>Column 3 of Table 1 suggests that as firm size increases, workers are less likely to be under-skilled. <lb/>These results are consistent with the analysis in Adalet McGowan and Andrews (2015a) that shows that <lb/>larger firms are better managed and that better managerial quality can account for the association between <lb/>under-skilling and firm productivity. On average across OECD countries, there is no significant <lb/>relationship between mismatch and whether a worker is on a permanent or a temporary contract, which is <lb/>in line with the literature (Table A2). However, in New Zealand, workers on fixed-term contracts relative <lb/>to indefinite contracts are less likely to be mismatched, which is driven by the lower probability of over-<lb/>skilling (Table 1, Columns 1 and 2). Part-time workers are more likely to be mismatched (Column 1), <lb/>which is driven by a higher rate of over-skilling among these workers. Occupational choices in part-time <lb/>work could be more limited, raising the probability of over-skilling and a switch from full-time to part-time <lb/>employment could entail occupational downgrading (Sparreboom, 2014; Connolly and Gregory, 2008). <lb/>3.3 <lb/>The effect of policy-related factors on skill mismatch <lb/>Table 2 reports the baseline results of the pooled regressions that explore the effects of different <lb/>policy-related factors on skill mismatch obtained from the estimation of Equation (2). The different <lb/>specifications control for a similar set of individual and job characteristics as above, but the estimated <lb/>coefficients are not reported for the sake of brevity. To the extent that skills mismatch is related to <lb/>productivity through both within-firm and between-firm factors (see Adalet McGowan and Andrews, <lb/>2015a), it is important to consider policies and factors that impose frictions on the efficient reallocation of <lb/>labour, restrict the entry of more productive firms and prevent the exit of less productive firms as potential <lb/>determinants of skills mismatch. While education policies clearly matter, these links between mismatch <lb/>and productivity through the reallocation channel suggest that a wider range of policies could affect <lb/>mismatch. <lb/>Well-designed framework policies are associated with lower skills mismatch (Panel A of Table 2). <lb/>Stringent labour market regulations, both for permanent and temporary employees, are associated with <lb/>higher mismatch, as they reduce labour market flexibility and the ability of firms to adapt to shocks or <lb/>changing skills needs (Columns 1 and 2 in Table 2, Panel A). <lb/>Policies that decrease barriers to firm entry and increase general competition (e.g. pro-competitive <lb/>product market regulations) might improve the allocation of skills through several channels. First, by <lb/>preventing the creation of rents and improving market selection (Pica and Rodriguez, 2005), such policies <lb/>will allow high skilled workers to be employed in high productivity firms. Second, they can lead to greater <lb/>market discipline, improving managerial quality and reducing mismatch. This would in turn make it easier <lb/>to adopt new technologies. Policy and institutional settings with low barriers to firm entry and strong <lb/>competitive pressures more generally, such as lower product market regulations (PMRs), are associated <lb/>with a lower probability of skills mismatch (Column 3 in Table 2, Panel A). <lb/>By raising exit costs and thus preventing the winding down of low-productivity firms, strict <lb/>bankruptcy legislation can result in labour, particularly high-skilled workers, being trapped in inefficient <lb/>firms and jobs that are not sufficiently challenging. This would in turn restrict the ability of high-<lb/>productivity firms to innovate and grow given a fixed pool of high-skilled workers 6 . Panel A of Table 2 <lb/>shows that policies that make it easier for firms to exit such as lower costs of closing a business are also <lb/>associated with a lower probability of mismatch (Column 4) 7 . <lb/>6. <lb/>Acemoglu et al. (2013) shows that policy intervention such as R&amp;D tax subsidies are only truly effective if <lb/>policymakers can encourage the exit of &quot; low-type &quot; incumbent firms, in order to free-up R&amp;D resources <lb/>(i.e. skilled labour) for innovative &quot; high-type &quot; incumbents and entrants. <lb/>7. <lb/>See Figure A1 for cross-country differences in the cost of closing a business. <lb/></body>

			<body>Another potential barrier to labour mobility and the efficient allocation of skills in an economy is low <lb/>rates of residential mobility. Permanent shocks requiring a reallocation of production factors, such as <lb/>sector and structural changes related to globalisation or technological progress could lead to differences in <lb/>regional supply and demand (Janiak and Wasmer, 2008). This would, in turn, require high geographical <lb/>mobility to broaden job search to new areas and increase the probability of finding a suitable job (Büchel <lb/>and Van Ham, 2003; Hensen et al., 2009). <lb/>Table 2. The effect of policy-related factors on skill mismatch <lb/>Marginal effects <lb/>Notes: See Table A1 for detailed explanations of the policy variables. Estimates from logit regressions. Values are marginal effects. <lb/>The coefficients correspond to the impact of a change in the explanatory variable on the probability of mismatch at the mean of the <lb/>independent variables. Each column in each panel includes one policy-related variable at a time. Regressions include as controls: <lb/>age, marital and migrant status, gender, level of education, firm size, contract type, a dummy for working full-time and working in the <lb/>private sector. Robust standard errors in parentheses. ** denotes statistical significance at the 1% level, * significance at the 5% level. <lb/>Source: OECD calculations based on the Survey of Adult Skills (2012 and 2015). <lb/>Housing market policies vary significantly across countries (Figures A2-A4), and in turn shape <lb/>residential mobility, which is positively correlated with worker reallocation rates (Caldera Sánchez and <lb/>Andrews, 2011; Figure A5) and the efficiency of job matching (Henley, 1998). Panel B of Table 2 shows <lb/>that policies that restrict mobility in housing markets might amplify skills mismatch by limiting labour <lb/>mobility. By creating lock-in effects, transaction costs affecting the buying and selling of dwellings – e.g. <lb/>transfer taxes (stamp duties, acquisition taxes), registration fees, notarial or other fees – can reduce <lb/>residential mobility and increase mismatch (Column 1). Strict rent controls and rules governing tenant-<lb/>landlord relations favouring tenants are associated with higher skills mismatch. A low price responsiveness <lb/>of housing supply can reduce labour mobility by affecting the average availability of housing. The <lb/>responsiveness of housing supply depends on geographical and urban characteristics as well as regulations <lb/>on the use of land, which influence the allocation of land and housing to different uses.

			<body>elasticity of housing supply is lower in countries where it takes longer to acquire a building permit, <lb/>underscoring the importance of efficient land-use regulation and administration (Andrews et al., 2011). <lb/>Skills gaps are one of the key determinants of training investment made by firms and workers <lb/>(McGuinness and Ortis, 2014). Given the changing face of the labour market, both workers who are just <lb/>entering the labour force and those that are already in the workforce have to be willing to learn new skills. <lb/>Adult learning and training are important to address such new skill requirements driven by technological <lb/>change as well as skills loss over time. There is some evidence that work-related training can decrease the <lb/>gap between skills acquired during formal education and those required on the job (Arulampalam et al., <lb/>2004) and reduce mismatch (van Smoorenburg and van der Velden, 2000). Table 2, Panel C shows that <lb/>higher participation in lifelong learning is associated with lower skills mismatch, reinforcing the <lb/>importance of skills gained beyond formal qualifications through both on the job-training and opportunities <lb/>for lifelong education and training as important instruments to reduce skills mismatch. There is evidence <lb/>that under-skilled workers benefit from employer-provided training, especially those of young workers <lb/>(Messinis and Olekalns, 2007). However, high-skilled workers are more likely to participate in adult <lb/>education and training, potentially highlighting the role for policies to increase the participation of low-<lb/>skilled workers in adult learning (OECD, 2013). <lb/>Higher managerial quality improves within-firm and aggregate productivity (Bloom et al., 2012) <lb/>largely through the application of modern HR practices (e.g. monitoring) and organisational restructuring, <lb/>which promote more efficient technological adoption, but there are large cross-country differences in terms <lb/>of managerial quality (Figure A6). Better managed firms may also be less susceptible to mismatch. Using <lb/>industry-level data, Adalet McGowan and Andrews (2015a) shows that higher managerial quality is <lb/>associated with lower rates of under-skilling and higher within-firm productivity, and that differences in <lb/>managerial quality can account for the negative association between under-skilling and within-firm <lb/>productivity. Micro-data analysis also shows that higher managerial quality is associated with lower skills <lb/>mismatch (Table 2, Panel C). Policies that promote competition in product markets are a key determinant <lb/>of managerial quality to the extent that they impose greater market discipline, which truncates the left tail <lb/>of poorly managed – and unproductive – firms (Bloom et al., 2014). <lb/>3.4 <lb/>The economic significance of policy-related factors for skills mismatch <lb/>To understand the economic significance of the effect of policy-related factors on skills mismatch and <lb/>the reductions in mismatch that could be associated with policy reform, Figure 3 shows how different <lb/>policy scenarios influence mismatch based on the estimates in Table 2. The dot is the probability to have <lb/>mismatch evaluated at the value of the policy for New Zealand and individual characteristics. The distance <lb/>between the Min/Max of the relevant policy indicator and the value for New Zealand is the change in the <lb/>probability of skills mismatch associated with the respective policy change. <lb/>In international perspective, New Zealand ranks well in many of the policies that have been found to <lb/>be associated with skill mismatch. For example, in terms of EPL and participation in lifelong learning, <lb/>New Zealand is at best practice. Looking at other policies suggests that there is some room to improve the <lb/>allocation of skills with further improvements to policy settings. For example, making rules governing <lb/>tenant-landlord relations more landlord-friendly (by easing them to the best practice in Canada) would be <lb/>associated with a 4.8 percentage point decrease in mismatch. <lb/></body>

Estimated gains to labour productivity from policy reforms that reduce skills mismatch <lb/>Notes: Estimates are based on logit regressions of probability of mismatch controlling for age, marital and migrant status, gender, <lb/>level of education, firm size, contract type, a dummy for working full-time and working in the private sector and OLS regressions of <lb/>labour productivity on skills mismatch. <lb/>Source: OECD calculations based on the Survey of Adult Skills (2012 and 2015). <lb/>4. <lb/>Conclusion <lb/>This paper extends earlier OECD work exploring the link between skill mismatch, productivity and <lb/>policies to include the countries in the second wave of OECD Survey of Adult Skills, with a special focus <lb/>on New Zealand. We find that the percentage of workers who are mismatched in terms of skills, at 28% in <lb/>New Zealand, is slightly over the OECD average of 25%. The share of over-skilling is at the OECD <lb/>average of 18%, while the share of under-skilling at around 10% is above the OECD average of 7%. The <lb/>results suggest that improving the allocation of skills to OECD best practice could be associated with an <lb/>increase in productivity of around 7% in New Zealand. <lb/>The main results suggest that differences in skills mismatch across countries are associated with <lb/>differences in the policy environment. After controlling for individual and job characteristics, skills <lb/>mismatch is lower in countries with well-designed framework conditions that promote efficient <lb/>reallocation, while housing policies that do not impede residential mobility also loom large. Lower <lb/>mismatch is also associated with greater flexibility in wage negotiations and higher participation in lifelong <lb/>learning as well as better managerial quality. While New Zealand performs well in many of the policies <lb/>found to be associated with skills mismatch, there is scope to improve the allocation of skills by moving <lb/>policies to the OECD best practice. <lb/>Maximum <lb/>Maximum Maximum <lb/>Maximum <lb/>Maximum <lb/>Maximum <lb/>Maximum <lb/>Maximum <lb/>Maximum <lb/>Minimum <lb/>Minimum <lb/>Minimum <lb/>Minimum <lb/>Minimum <lb/>Minimum <lb/>Minimum <lb/>Minimum <lb/>Minimum <lb/>Minimum <lb/>Minimum <lb/>Maximum <lb/>Maximum <lb/>(TUR) <lb/>(DEU) <lb/>(TUR) <lb/>(ISR) <lb/>(BEL) <lb/>(SWE) <lb/>(AUT) <lb/>(SVK) <lb/>(NLD ) <lb/>(GRC) <lb/>(TUR) <lb/>(NLD ) <lb/>(USA) <lb/>(CAN) <lb/>(NOR) <lb/>(DNK) <lb/>(FIN) <lb/>(CAN) <lb/>(KOR) <lb/>(USA) <lb/>(DNK) <lb/>(FIN) <lb/>-1 <lb/>0 <lb/>1 <lb/>2 <lb/>3 <lb/>4 <lb/>5 <lb/>Product market <lb/>regulation <lb/>Employment <lb/>protection <lb/>legislation <lb/>(permanent workers) <lb/>Employment protection <lb/>legislation <lb/>(temporary workers) <lb/>Cost of closing <lb/>a business <lb/>Transaction costs <lb/>Rent control <lb/>Tenant-landlord <lb/>regulations <lb/>Cost of obtaining <lb/>a building permit <lb/>Responsiveness <lb/>of housing supply <lb/>Participation in <lb/>lifelong learning <lb/>Managerial quality <lb/>Framework policies <lb/>Housing policies <lb/>Other policies <lb/>New Zealand <lb/>Gains to labour productivity <lb/>ECO/WKP(2017)35 <lb/></body>

			<body>Figure A6. Average proficiency score of managers in literacy; total economy <lb/>Notes: Average proficiency scores refer to the unweighted average of the proficiency scores of managers in each country across all <lb/>industries. <lb/>Source: OECD calculations based on the Survey of Adult Skills (2012 and 2015). <lb/>Box A1. OECD Survey of Adult Skills (PIAAC) <lb/>The survey is based on a background questionnaire administered to households representing the population aged <lb/>between 16 and 65. On average, across countries, 77.5% of participants were assessed on a computer, while the rest took <lb/>the paper-based assessment. PIAAC has extensive information on skill use at work and at home and background variables <lb/>such as educational attainment, employment status, job, socio-economic background and personal characteristics. It was also <lb/>designed to measure key cognitive and workplace skills and provides indicators on the proficiency of individuals in literacy, <lb/>numeracy and problem-solving in technology-rich environments, measured on a 500-point scale. These data allow a more in-<lb/>depth assessment of skills compared to previous surveys as they include more dimensions in capturing key information-<lb/>processing competencies defined as: <lb/>•  Literacy: ability to understand, evaluate, use and engage with written texts to participate in society, to achieve<lb/>one&apos;s goals, and to develop one&apos;s knowledge and potential. <lb/>•  Numeracy: ability to access, use, interpret and communicate mathematical information and ideas in order to<lb/>engage in and manage the mathematical demands of a range of situations in adult life. <lb/>•  Problem-solving in technology rich environments: the ability to use digital technology, communication tools and<lb/>networks to acquire and evaluate information, communicate with others and perform practical tasks. <lb/>1 <lb/>There are two main issues that need to be taken into consideration when these data are used. 2 First, the three skill <lb/>domains were not directly assessed for each respondent due to time constraints, but PIAAC uses matrix-sampling design to <lb/>assign the assessment exercises to individuals and Item Response Theory to combine the individual responses to get a <lb/>comprehensive view of each skill domain across the country. However, such aggregation can lead to biased estimates due to <lb/>measurement error. Hence, a multiple imputation methodology was utilised to generate 10 &quot; plausible values &quot; for each <lb/>respondent for each skill domain and the subsequent analysis takes a mean of these values. Second, complex sampling <lb/>designs that vary across countries were administered in the data collection. In order to get a consistent approach to sampling <lb/>variance calculation, a replication technique (the Jacknife Repeated Replication) is used to compute sampling error. The <lb/>estimates presented in this paper take these weights into account through the use of the &quot; PIAAC Tool &quot; macro. <lb/>1. <lb/>Using the problem-solving indicator is problematic as the average score does not take into account the large and variable proportion <lb/>of participants who did not take that part of the assessment either due to not being able to use a computer or due to refusal. <lb/>2. <lb/>For more details, see OECD (2013), Technical Report of the Survey of Adult Skills (PIAAC), Paris. <lb/>0 <lb/>50 <lb/>100 <lb/>150 <lb/>200 <lb/>250 <lb/>300 <lb/>350 <lb/></body>

Data sources for policy-related variables <lb/>Notes: Transaction costs include a number of fees such as transfer taxes (e.g. stamp duties), registration fees incurred when <lb/>registering the property in the land registry, notarial or other legal fees and typical real estate agency fees. Rent control is a composite <lb/>indicator of the extent of controls of rents, how increases in rents are determined and the permitted cost pass-through onto rents in <lb/>each country. The tenant-landlord regulation indicator measures the ease of evicting a tenant, degree of tenure security and deposit <lb/>requirements. The responsiveness of the housing supply is based on the estimates of the long-run elasticity of new housing supply, <lb/>where new supply is measured by residential investment. <lb/>Product market regulation <lb/>Overall PMR index f rom OECD, Product Market Regulation Database, 2008 <lb/>EPL (permanent) <lb/>OECD, Employment Protection Legislation Database, indicator f or the protection <lb/>of permanent w orkers against individual and collective dismissals, 2013 <lb/>EPL (temporary) <lb/>OECD, Employment Protection Legislation Database, indicator f or the regulation <lb/>on temporary f orms of employment, 2013 <lb/>Cost of closing a business <lb/>World Bank, Doing Business Database, 2014 <lb/>Transaction Costs <lb/>Andrew s et al.
