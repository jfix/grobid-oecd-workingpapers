			<body>A. <lb/>Introduction <lb/>Having a better understanding of consumers&apos; decision-making processes and of the biases likely <lb/>to influence their economic and financial decisions are key areas of interest to financial services policy <lb/>makers, regulators and supervisors. Behavioural economics studies provide a body of knowledge on <lb/>how people make non optimal economic decisions. By understanding what processes influence <lb/>consumer behaviour, the harmful impacts of poor decision making by consumers and how to mitigate <lb/>them can be incorporated into regulatory and supervisors practices to strengthen financial consumer <lb/>protection. <lb/>The OECD has been at the forefront of looking at how behavioural insights can help to make <lb/>policies more effective and help consumers make better decisions. 1 Numerous events have been <lb/>organised and several publications on the topic have been published, notably the most recent <lb/>publication on Behavioural Insights and Public Policy, which collects case studies from around the <lb/>world across numerous fields, including on financial products and consumer protection, as a practical <lb/>reference for policy makers. 2 Discussions are also occurring around more specific issues relating to <lb/>financial consumer protection, for example how behavioural biases lead to market inefficiencies and <lb/>reduced competitive pressure. 3 <lb/>As part of this work, this paper describes the basic characteristics and concepts associated with <lb/>behavioural economics, focusing on behavioural finance insights with the aim of improving financial <lb/>consumer protection from a supervisory, regulatory and policy-making perspective. It also presents the <lb/>specific research methods applied in a behavioural economics context, which are largely based on <lb/>empirical research and randomised controlled trials, with a view to understanding how such techniques <lb/>have been applied by regulators and supervisors and their effectiveness. It covers all financial sectors <lb/>and activities (banking, insurance, securities, investment, etc.) and does not specifically focus on retail <lb/>financial services, as the organisation of wholesale markets and their potential abuses can also have an <lb/>impact on retail consumers (e.g. market manipulation). <lb/>The paper then provides a general overview on how behavioural economics has been applied to <lb/>financial services, outlining recent developments, ideas and lessons learnt through research and <lb/>experiences conducted at national level. <lb/>The Annex provides an annotated bibliography of a non-exhaustive list of key behavioural <lb/>economics publications, papers and research documents. <lb/>B. <lb/>Context <lb/>This section of the paper provides the context in which the field of behavioural economics has <lb/>developed, drawing on key material and publications in order to provide main definitions used in the <lb/>field and the historical evolution that has occurred. <lb/>1 See www.oecd.org/gov/regulatory-policy/behavioural-insights-and-public-policy-9789264270480-en.htm <lb/>2 OECD (2017) <lb/>3 See www.oecd.org/daf/competition/workinprogress.htm#Beh_Eco <lb/></body>

			<body>a) <lb/>Definitions and methodology <lb/>Behavioural economics helps to describe and provide insights into how people fail to behave and <lb/>make rational decisions and choices in their own best interests. 4 Human beings do not always take <lb/>decisions which are consistent with their own preferences and needs, they do not act in a rational way, <lb/>and their choices are often driven by their emotions and their particular context. Mistaken beliefs, <lb/>procrastination, passivity, self-control problems, difficulties in choosing among a large set of options <lb/>are some of the elements which impact consumers&apos; decisions and lead them to choose products or <lb/>services which are not always best suited to their needs. Building on results from psychological, <lb/>cognitive and social research into decision making, behavioural economics therefore explores why <lb/>people make irrational decisions, and why and how their behaviour does not follow the predictions of <lb/>economic models. 5 <lb/>The behavioural economics&apos; view of consumers contradicts the &quot; standard &quot; or &quot; classical &quot; <lb/>economic assumption according to which individuals know what they want and seek to make the most <lb/>of the available opportunities given the scarcity of constraints that they face (Camerer, 1999). The <lb/>classical homo economicus is an ideal and perfect consumer, who knows what is best for him/her, acts <lb/>thoughtfully and consistently, weighs carefully all options available and makes the best decision to <lb/>serve his/her interests. This approach deliberately ignores the psychological dimensions of the <lb/>decision-making process (Angner and Loewenstein, 2006; Heukelom, 2006). However, neoclassical <lb/>theory has often fallen short of explaining the anomalies that have occurred within market economies 6 . <lb/>In contrast, behavioural economics suggests mathematical alternatives based on firm <lb/>psychological foundations for rationality assumptions. In that sense, it is at the intersection of <lb/>economics and psychology and seeks to unite the basic principles of neoclassical economics with the <lb/>realities posed by human psychology (Camerer and Loewenstein, 2003; Camerer, 1999; <lb/>McAuley, 2010). <lb/>In the language of behavioural economists, &quot; bias &quot; refers to the systematic, and most often <lb/>unconscious, deviations from a strict economic model of rationality that many people exhibit in the <lb/>face of (economic) decisions. This covers cognitive biases, which include incorrect beliefs or illogical <lb/>interpretations, social biases such as herding or crowd following, and emotional biases like <lb/>overconfidence or loss aversion. 7 <lb/>The identification of biases and the analysis of the context in which they arise, their specific <lb/>features and characteristics, and the psychological process leading to them are at the centre of <lb/>behavioural economics. The list of behavioural biases is therefore continually evolving. Behavioural <lb/>economics also tries to come up with techniques to prevent, mitigate and possibly reduce the negative <lb/>effects of biases. One of the most significant mitigation techniques is the framing effect: the way a <lb/>choice is presented strongly affects the choice that results. <lb/>4 It has to be noted that there is no agreed definition of behavioural economics. The broad approach proposed in <lb/>this paper is aimed at providing a large range of situations and examples to illustrate the relevance of <lb/>behavioural economics for financial services. <lb/>5 Some researchers have called the attention on the need to also consider the potential bias from financial <lb/>institutions and regulatory and policy-making bodies which are equally led by human beings <lb/>(Amstrong and Huck, 2010; Cooper and Kovacic, 2012) <lb/>6 See B. b) <lb/>7 See C. b) for a more detailed presentation of various types of biases. <lb/></body>

			<body>Regarding the methodology, behavioural economics research is often based on laboratory <lb/>experiments, which place participants in a simulated environment. These &quot; lab experiments &quot; provide <lb/>findings of individual economic agents which are difficult to obtain using conventional econometric <lb/>techniques, and usually take the form of a randomised controlled trial (RCT). 8 Environmental factors <lb/>can be fully controlled, in particular all factors affecting decision makers in a given situation. This <lb/>allows researchers to identify causal relationships. An underlying assumption is that the results <lb/>generated in the artificial environment of laboratory experiments can be generalised and considered <lb/>valid in the broader environment. Field experiments, performed outside of a laboratory in real-life <lb/>situations, have also been used for behavioural economics research. While the results of these studies <lb/>are usually considered to be more generalizable, the drawback is that all influencing factors cannot be <lb/>controlled for. <lb/>b) <lb/>Historical significance <lb/>The first conference on behavioural economics was held at the University of Chicago in 1986, <lb/>and in 1994 Harvard University appointed David Laibson as the first official behavioural economics <lb/>professor (Pettit, 2014). Universities, research organisations and business schools have fairly recently <lb/>recognised behavioural economics as a (sub)discipline. <lb/>However, the notion of psychology as a driver of economic action is not new. Already in the <lb/>18 th century, Adam Smith noted in The Theory of Moral Sentiments (1790) that the imperfections of <lb/>human psychology did have an impact on economic decisions. He anticipated a wide range of insights <lb/>regarding phenomena such as loss aversion, overconfidence or fairness. But until the middle of the <lb/>20 th century, economics was dominated by the neoclassical approach based on the theory of a perfect, <lb/>rational homo economicus. The ambition was to elevate economics as a natural science, and <lb/>psychology had to be considered separately. Some economists (such as Francis Edgeworth, Irving <lb/>Fisher or Vilfredo Pareto) included a psychological dimension in their research, but they were given <lb/>limited attention at the time. For example, Pareto (1935) highlighted that one of the central causes of <lb/>the 1929 stock market crash and the ensuing Great Depression could be the human factor in economic <lb/>decision-making. <lb/>Post-war economists (for example, Samuelson, 1947 or Arrow and Debreu, 1954) adopted the <lb/>belief that the only valid method to collect information about human choices and preferences was to <lb/>study market transactions or other observable choices. On that basis, the expected utility and <lb/>discounted utility models, which review decision-making given uncertainty and intertemporal (or <lb/>delayed) consumption, gained acceptance. Maurice Allais (1953) built on this work and demonstrated <lb/>experimentally that in a context of risky outcomes, the key factor for the decision-maker is the risk <lb/>level of the selected option. This result contradicts the expected utility hypothesis -the mathematical <lb/>view of probability being considered in human behaviour -and is known as the &quot; Allais paradox &quot; . First <lb/>presented in 1953, it led to multiple developments in decision theory and behavioural economics. <lb/>Another important milestone was the publication of Models of man, social and rational by Herbert A. <lb/>Simon in 1957, who introduced the concept of &quot; bounded rationality &quot; . He demonstrated that humans&apos; <lb/>decision-making capabilities were limited by the information available, their capacity to evaluate this <lb/>information and the amount of time they had to make the decision. <lb/>Progressively, economists recognised that counterexamples to their theoretical models, evidenced <lb/>by experiments, could not be ignored, and progress in research in psychology identified new directions <lb/></body>

			<body>for development. One of the key turning points for behavioural economics was probably the work of <lb/>psychologists Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky at the end of the 1970&apos;s, who explained the <lb/>psychological reasoning behind certain non-rational economic decisions in their paper Prospect <lb/>Theory: An analysis of decision under risk (1979). They found empirically that people underweight <lb/>outcomes that are merely probable in comparison with outcomes that are obtained with certainty, and <lb/>also that people assign value to gains and losses rather than to final assets. Prospect theory has a solid <lb/>mathematical basis, making it comfortable for economists to use. <lb/>Two publications by Richard Thaler and Cass Sunstein fostered today&apos;s recognition of <lb/>behavioural economics and contributed to broadening its influence beyond the academic world. First, <lb/>in 2003 Libertarian paternalism established that given the behavioural findings of bounded rationality <lb/>and bounded self-control, people&apos;s choices could be steered in welfare-promoting directions without <lb/>eliminating their freedom of choice. Second, in 2008 Nudge expanded on this concept and highlighted <lb/>numerous examples where people could be &quot;nudged&quot; to make better decisions using these behavioural <lb/>insights without restricting their option set. By illustrating how behavioural insights could be put to <lb/>practical use, these books have been a major source of inspiration for policy makers and business <lb/>people. <lb/>c) <lb/>Behavioural economics and public policy <lb/>Behavioural economics has potential applications in all fields involving human decisions and <lb/>choices, particularly where relatively complex products or services are involved. Jurisdictions <lb/>pioneering in the development of behaviourally informed policy or regulation have already taken <lb/>initiatives in many different areas such as healthcare, food and energy labelling, organ donation, <lb/>charitable giving, energy use, employment activation, fine recovery, etc. <lb/>Therefore, behavioural economics has now reached a level of maturity and development which <lb/>has led to its progressive recognition as a (sub)discipline with potential applications across various <lb/>public policy fields involving human decisions and choices (Dolan et al., 2010; Lunne, 2014). <lb/>This is because, first, there is now a substantial set of confirmed evidence on what people&apos;s main <lb/>biases are and how their behaviour is influenced, and second, recent economic events (for example the <lb/>subprime mortgage crisis, or pension mis-selling) can neither be explained nor understood without <lb/>psychological insights which go beyond established notions of &quot; rationality &quot; . On this basis, there is <lb/>growing recognition that the findings of behavioural economics can help to identify areas where <lb/>government intervention can be more effective than was the case with traditional economic models. <lb/>Behavioural economics can provide a more realistic and thoughtful basis for making economic policy. <lb/>This has to be combined with a series of contextual elements which explain why behavioural <lb/>economics increasingly influences the focus and shape of public policy initiatives: <lb/> Some of the biggest policy challenges -people with chronic health conditions, obesity, <lb/>environmental sustainability -require changes in people&apos;s behaviours, lifestyles or existing <lb/>habits. This does not always require a hard instrument such as legislation or regulation which <lb/>compels people to act in a certain way. Including less coercive and more effective tools aimed <lb/>at changing the environment within which people make decisions and respond to cues can be <lb/>used, with the potential to bring about rapid, significant and long-lasting changes in behaviour. <lb/> The recent financial crisis and its long-lasting impact on markets have provided evidence of <lb/>the limitations of deregulation and of the &quot; markets-do-it-best &quot; approach. Markets do not <lb/>operate perfectly and individuals do not always follow the most economically rational path <lb/></body>

			<page>7 <lb/></page>

			<body>and addressing behavioural bias through behaviourally informed solutions can help consumers <lb/>make informed decisions and minimise losses arising from human errors. <lb/> Governments operating with budgetary constraints require robust cost-effective and efficient <lb/>solutions to tackle market failures. Innovative public policy initiatives have to be considered, <lb/>as complementary or alternative tools to conventional &quot; hard &quot; instruments such as regulation, <lb/>legislation or taxation. In this respect, behavioural approaches provide low cost, new ways of <lb/>acting and helping achieve better outcomes for citizens. <lb/>OECD work on behavioural insights <lb/>The OECD expressed support early on for the applications of behavioural economics to policy <lb/>and has since given much attention to the improvements it could bring to public policy decision <lb/>making, regulation and rule-making. <lb/>Consumer policy <lb/>In 2010, the Consumer Policy Toolkit noted that work done in the field of behavioural economics <lb/>had identified a number of important ways that consumer behaviour may deviate from the assumptions <lb/>underlying the traditional market model and enriched understanding of consumer behaviour in key <lb/>areas (e.g. making choices with uncertain outcomes, trade-offs between present decisions and long-<lb/>term interests). It also underlined that in certain areas, such as designing information disclosures or <lb/>evaluating situations involving default-setting, behavioural economics may provide important insights <lb/>that could improve policy formulation. It recommended that, as behavioural economics continues to <lb/>mature, much attention should be given to further implications for consumer policy. <lb/>In 2014, the OECD report on Regulatory Policy and Behavioural Economics offered an <lb/>international review of the initial applications of behavioural economics to policy, with a particular <lb/>focus on regulatory policy. It described the extent to which behavioural findings have begun to <lb/>influence public policy in a number of OECD jurisdictions, referring to a total of more than 60 <lb/>instances. It illustrated that some jurisdictions have introduced a behavioural dimension in their public <lb/>policy approach as a general guiding principle on better policy-making, or on a case-by-case basis <lb/>(Australia, Canada, the European Commission, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, UK, USA). 9 It also <lb/>indicated that some other jurisdictions have shown interest and are exploring how best to use <lb/>behavioural economics findings in their policy-making approach (France, Norway). The report also <lb/>considered possible lessons for regulatory design and delivery. It highlighted in particular how much <lb/>the environment in which decision makers operate matters, and how good regulations can improve the <lb/>environment, and in this context should be viewed as an enabler and a facilitator to achieving positive <lb/>outcomes. <lb/>The study also outlined that behavioural economics influences the general approach to public <lb/>policy as well as the solution(s) to the identified market problems. Improved knowledge of consumers&apos; <lb/>psychological traits and decision-making processes impacts the policy vision and strategy, its targets, <lb/>its objectives, etc. It also helps determine what is/are the most effective way(s) to remove the existing <lb/></body>

			<note place="footnote">9 &quot; Explicit mechanisms for applying behavioural economics to policy might be contrasted with more implicit <lb/>ones, whereby understanding of behavioural economics is spread more broadly among policy makers <lb/>across a sweep of institutions within the public sector. Instead of a group of individuals with specialist <lb/>knowledge seeking to apply behavioural ideas across policy areas, it may be possible for policy <lb/>makers within these areas to absorb and apply behavioural thinking. &quot; (Lunne, 2014) <lb/></note>

			<body>problems, and this can include a wide range of options, from the provision of selected information to <lb/>regulation, or some form of alternatives to regulation, or ultimately to the control of products. It is <lb/>important to have in mind that adopting a behaviourally-inspired approach does not come as an <lb/>alternative to regulation. It provides an additional tool to design proper regulation when it proves to be <lb/>the most appropriate solution. In this case, behavioural findings will also impact the scope, the shape, <lb/>the nature and the focus of the regulatory provisions, possibly built on a nudge. <lb/>OECD initiative on &quot; New Approaches to Economic Challenges &quot; (NAEC) <lb/>NAEC was launched by the OECD in 2012 as a comprehensive organisation-wide reflection <lb/>process on the roots and lessons from the crisis, as well as long-term, global trends. NAEC was also <lb/>launched as part of a broader effort to build an inclusive and sustainable agenda for growth and well-<lb/>being. The NAEC process involves renewing and strengthening the OECD&apos;s analytical <lb/>frameworks, policy instruments and tools. This new approach needs to take into account the changing <lb/>context, and in particular the fact that the crisis has provoked changes in some of the assumptions <lb/>about the functioning of the economy, and especially those related to the behaviour of economic <lb/>agents and to risks, paying greater attention to psychological bias, perceived versus objective risks, as <lb/>well as the nonlinearity in risk perception. <lb/>OECD work on behavioural economics is therefore expanding, particularly in the areas of public <lb/>governance, regulatory policy, consumer policy and environmental policy design. The Public <lb/>Governance and Regulatory Policy Committees are also developing a policy toolkit which will include <lb/>some guidance on the application of behavioural economics in policy-making. Further work is under <lb/>discussion in other policy areas such as tax policy. The OECD convened a meeting in 2015 of <lb/>behavioural insights practitioners in governments and regulatory agencies as a platform for sharing the <lb/>experiences applying behavioural approaches to policy. This will help in building and sharing <lb/>knowledge on how and where behavioural economics can contribute to policy making. The platform <lb/>will contribute to developing good practices in applying behavioural insight, reflecting on what works <lb/>and why, and what are the short-and long-term effects of interventions. <lb/>Pensions <lb/>The OECD also released a paper in 2007 on the Implications of behavioural economics for <lb/>mandatory individual account pension systems. In individual account pension systems, members bear <lb/>the risks and consequences of their investment decisions. In most cases, these accounts have partially <lb/>replaced public pension systems, raising concerns over their impact on retirement income. The paper <lb/>described the extent to which plan members make active investment decisions in their pension systems <lb/>and assesses the policy solutions that have been put forward to facilitate choice. The paper offers a <lb/>comparative analysis of ten countries that have implemented investment choice in the accumulation <lb/>stage of their individual account pension system. <lb/>Key conclusions from the study are that, although a basic assumption of economic theory states <lb/>that consumers are better off with a wider array of choices, too many investment options can cause <lb/>information overload, resulting in greater confusion and complexity, and, consequently, in a greater <lb/>use of the default option. The design of the default option matters, since even when choice is limited, <lb/>an important group of participants do not exercise active choice. Moreover, many participants may <lb/>interpret the default option as the relevant one for them, as it has been endorsed or proposed by <lb/>policymakers. Policy makers need to urgently address how default investment options should be <lb/>designed and specifically consider new types of default options, such as managed accounts and target <lb/>date funds. Evidence also reveals a preference among members towards equity funds. Participants tend <lb/></body>

			<page>9 <lb/></page>

			<body>to change their asset allocation on the basis of recent performance trends and engage on naive <lb/>diversification strategies, such as equal weights across funds irrespective of their asset allocation. <lb/>In 2008, the OECD indicated in a report on financial education and awareness in the field of <lb/>pensions that improved financial education is the appropriate response if a lack of financial <lb/>information or skills is the reason for low levels of saving. But it also confirms that an increasing <lb/>number of studies in behavioural economics show that financial and savings behaviour relate to <lb/>psychological factors. These findings, therefore, show heterogeneous savings behaviour across <lb/>consumers, which have important implications for the design and implementation of effective <lb/>financial education programmes. For example, in order to meet the needs of those consumers who are <lb/> &quot; non-planners &quot; , financial education programmes will need to emphasise simpler decisions and <lb/>tangible present-day (as opposed to a future day) benefits, using explicit and direct information, <lb/>reduced complexity, and fewer choices. Yet even these directed schemes may not be sufficient, and <lb/>other measures may be required to ensure an adequate level of savings for retirement, for example <lb/>automatic enrolment, with appropriate default options with respect to contribution rates and <lb/>investment allocation. <lb/>Financial Education and Literacy <lb/>Under the support of the Russia/World Bank/OECD Trust Fund for Financial Literacy and <lb/>Education, the OECD has raised awareness on the importance of behavioural economics in the <lb/>financial education context. The report (Financial literacy and education Russian Trust Fund 2013) <lb/>explored how the design of financial education programmes can benefit from the findings of <lb/>behavioural economists and economic psychologists. In particular: <lb/> It gathers a review and discussion of the literature on how behavioural economics can improve <lb/>and complement financial education visually and how it can help the design of financial <lb/>education programmes. <lb/> It provides an in-depth case study of an innovative application of lessons from psychology to a <lb/>financial education programme in Brazil. <lb/>C. <lb/>Behavioural economics and financial services <lb/>a) <lb/>Specific relevance of behavioural economics/psychology for financial services <lb/>Consumers&apos; behavioural problems are accentuated when making (difficult) financial decisions <lb/>Using behavioural economics insights to better protect consumers involved in financial <lb/>transactions seems of particular relevance given the complexity of financial products and services for <lb/>an average consumer, and the large array of choice. Comparison between products is difficult, as each <lb/>of them has specific features, and pricing structures are not always fully transparent. Besides, financial <lb/>choices are usually important life decisions for consumers involving emotional elements (e.g. <lb/>investing a lifetime savings, planning for retirement, purchasing insurance involving death benefits). <lb/>An additional aspect is that decisions made will only produce their effects over the long-term, meaning <lb/>that risk and uncertainty can play a larger role. It is also difficult for consumers to learn from <lb/>experience, as financial products are often one-off purchases (FCA, 2013; Lunne, 2014). These <lb/>difficulties are accentuated when consumers are older or vulnerable due to their physical or mental <lb/>condition, their economic circumstances, their family situation, their age, etc. <lb/></body>

			<page>10 <lb/></page>

			<body>In the Netherlands for example, the financial regulator came to the conclusion that because of the <lb/>limited time and motivation consumers allocate to financial decisions, disclosure requirements alone <lb/>are not effective enough in informing and improving consumers&apos; decision making. These insights <lb/>resulted in a desired shift of responsibility between firms and consumers. Firms need to have a more <lb/>active and responsible approach in order to safeguard the interests of consumers. An example of this <lb/>shift concerns saving agreements, where customers were lured in with high interest rates that were <lb/>quietly reduced month-by-month over the years that followed to unrealistically low levels. This kind <lb/>of product would not have existed if customers had assessed their financial products more actively and <lb/>switched to a provider with a more favourable interest rate. However, this did not happen. The <lb/>Authority for the Financial Markets (AFM), the Dutch regulator, came to an agreement with market <lb/>parties that these saving agreements are harmful for customers and they should no longer exist. 10 <lb/>Today, with rapidly evolving technologies, consumers benefit from an extended range of <lb/>distribution channels to buy financial services and products, especially mobile phones and the internet, <lb/>and different access points can even be combined. With more opportunities come more risks, in <lb/>particular in terms of fraud but also regarding the information provided to consumers. It is challenging <lb/>for consumers to find and analyse relevant and accurate information in their particular context, and <lb/>assess what information can be trusted. It is therefore particularly important that consumers benefit <lb/>from an equivalent protection regardless of the channel they use to purchase their financial product or <lb/>service. <lb/>For all of these reasons, behavioural biases are common in consumers&apos; financial decisions, and <lb/>can have significant short-term and long-term impacts on the well-being of consumers and of their <lb/>families. People often make errors when choosing and using financial products, and can suffer <lb/>considerable losses as a result. Using behavioural economics helps to explain how these errors arise, <lb/>why they persist, and what can be done to prevent them. Market forces left to themselves will often <lb/>not work to reduce these mistakes, so regulation may be needed. <lb/>Behaviourally-inspired policy and/or regulatory responses to remedy the most frequently made <lb/>errors can therefore be particularly useful for the area of financial consumer protection. <lb/>Box 1. Lessons from behavioural economics for retail financial markets in the UK <lb/>In 2013, The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) published a research paper that summarised the main <lb/>lessons from behavioural economics for retail financial markets: <lb/> Consumers make predictable mistakes when choosing and using financial products -the most <lb/>relevant biases for retail markets are listed and categorised according to how they affect decisions: <lb/>preferences (what we want -present bias, reference dependence and loss aversion, regret and other <lb/>emotions), beliefs (what we believe are the facts about our situation and options -overconfidence, <lb/>over-extrapolation, projection bias), and decision-making (which option gets us closest to what we <lb/>want, given our beliefs -framing, salience and limited attention; mental accounting and narrow <lb/>framing; decision-making rules of thumb; persuasion and social influence). <lb/> Firms respond to these mistakes and how behavioural biases can lead firms to compete in ways that <lb/>are not in the interests of consumers. <lb/>The research paper then describes how behavioural economics can, and should, be used in the regulation <lb/></body>

			<body>of financial conduct following 3 steps: <lb/> Step 1: Identifying and prioritising issues -establish a set of indicators that can help identify where <lb/>consumer detriment from mistakes may be particularly high, with regard to firms (e.g. uncompetitively <lb/>high margins, concentrated profits from a small group of consumers), to product features (e.g. <lb/>innovative products that appear very cheap, contract features that often target behavioural biases) or <lb/>to consumers (e.g. reported or potential regret, choice out of line with common sense). A <lb/>complementary way is to look at a potential mismatch between the need the product is meant to <lb/>serve and how consumers use it in practice. The size of the problem should be the main priority <lb/>driver. <lb/> Step 2: Identifying root causes of problems -investigate whether consumers are making mistakes and <lb/>if so which bias(es) are the cause (examine consumers choice in different settings, their awareness of <lb/>product information, their self-reported needs and objectives), and determine the extent of the issue -<lb/>firm-specific or market-wide -to define the type of response needed. <lb/> Step 3: Design effective interventions -ordered from least to most interventionist, behavioural <lb/>problems could be solved through 1) the provision of information in a specific way, or the prohibition <lb/>of specific marketing materials or practices; 2) changes to the choice environment; 3) the control of <lb/>product distribution and 4) the control of products, including ban on specific product features or <lb/>requirement for products to contain specific features. <lb/>Inconsistencies in consumers&apos; decisions can have an impact on how markets work <lb/>Behavioural economics can also be used to support competition in financial services, for the <lb/>benefit of consumers as end-users of the services. <lb/>When consumers&apos; decisions are over-influenced by behavioural bias, firms do not compete on the <lb/>quality and price of their commercial offer or on the innovation or diversity of their products and <lb/>prices. They compete in ways that are not in the interest of consumers, and offer products which <lb/>appeal to them but do not fully or optimally serve their needs. <lb/>While healthy competition would drive out bad options for consumers, because of consumers&apos; <lb/>irrational decision-making, markets fail to eliminate the bad options for consumers. Market forces left <lb/>to themselves will often not work to reduce these mistakes, so interventions may be needed. 11 <lb/>The Effective Approaches to support the implementation of the High-level Principles 12 developed <lb/>by the G20/OECD Task Force on Financial Consumer Protection, and in particular Principle 10 on <lb/>Competition recognises that: &quot; Insights provided by behavioural economics enhance understanding on <lb/>how consumers make financial decisions and the inhibitors to competitive outcomes. Behavioural <lb/>economics can assist in the design of more appropriate remedies, thus allowing more effective <lb/>promotion of competition in financial markets &quot; . This was introduced as part of the innovative or <lb/>emerging approaches to implement Principle 10. <lb/>In Australia for example, the principles of behavioural economics have been used to design a <lb/>market intervention in relation to searching and comparing through the introduction of the key fact <lb/></body>

			<body>sheet for home loans. Behavioural economics research was used to identify the nature of the <lb/>difficulties that consumers have in understanding pre-contractual documentation in relation to home <lb/>loans and how disclosure could be improved. Research also indicates that the quantity of information <lb/>can overwhelm consumers, which can encourage consumers to ignore pre-contractual disclosure <lb/>information. In France, behavioural analysis helped to develop thinking about credit insurance, which <lb/>led to a proposal to extend the period of time during which individuals can change their credit <lb/>insurance, and has more generally helped to enrich thinking on the issues linked to the ability to <lb/>terminate insurance contracts. 13 <lb/>Behavioural economics can therefore also play a critical role in improving the demand side of the <lb/>financial services market, by ensuring that consumer choices of services and products are made on the <lb/>basis of objective criteria which fulfil their specific needs. It will support well-functioning financial <lb/>services markets and contribute to the development of effective competition for the benefits of both <lb/>consumers and financial services providers. <lb/>b) <lb/>Behavioural economics core concepts relevant for financial services <lb/>As a result of the research and studies conducted so far, there exists a set of core behavioural <lb/>insights that are relevant to furthering our understanding of consumer decision making in financial <lb/>markets. It consists mainly of categories of the most commonly encountered behavioural biases and <lb/>types of mitigation responses which have proven effective in reducing the negative effects of biases. <lb/>The following list is intended as a brief description of these essential, and largely uncontroversial, <lb/>results and concepts with a view to facilitating an initial understanding of the behavioural economics <lb/>approach and its relevance to financial services. It is neither an exhaustive list nor as a specific <lb/>classification of biases or of mitigation responses. 14 <lb/>Types of bias <lb/> Heuristics -Heuristics is a quick, informal and intuitive shortcut used to generate an <lb/>approximate answer to a reasoning question. They are most often helpful, because they help <lb/>solve a complex problem. However, if an inappropriate heuristics fails to produce a correct <lb/>judgment (rule of thumb), it can result in a (cognitive) bias. <lb/> Example: allocating the pension pot equally across all investment funds available in a <lb/>pension scheme rather than making a careful allocation decision. <lb/> Present bias -People tend to have preferences for immediate gratification. This leads them to <lb/>overvalue the present over the future, and systematically choose options which will bring <lb/>short-term benefits even though they are not the best value offers in the long-term. <lb/> Example: over-borrowing, e.g. buying a tablet-PC now using a payday loan without <lb/>thinking much about the total cost. <lb/></body>

			<note place="footnote">13 www.oecd.org/daf/fin/financial-education/G20-OECD-Financial-Consumer-Protection-Principles-<lb/>Implementation-2014.pdf, Principle 10 <lb/>14 Academics and researchers have adopted various ways of grouping and classifying biases and mitigation <lb/>responses. The present list is largely based on the approach taken by the FCA (FCA, 2013) <lb/></note>

			<page>13 <lb/></page>

			<body> Reference dependence (or anchoring effect) and loss aversion -Consumers assess outcomes <lb/>relative to a reference point and not in their own right. Their choice can be instable as it will <lb/>depend on the selected reference point. Gains and losses in particular are assessed according <lb/>to a reference point, and the same outcome can be framed as a gain or as a loss depending on <lb/>the choice of reference point. In all situations, people tend to underweight gains and <lb/>overweight losses. <lb/> Example: perceiving add-on insurance as cheap because it is sold together with <lb/>something that has a comparatively much higher price. <lb/> Regret and other emotions -People may act to avoid ambiguity or stress. Their choices can <lb/>also be distorted by temporary strong emotions (e.g. fear). <lb/> Example: buying expensive insurance for peace of mind, even though buyers are very <lb/>unlikely to need it. <lb/> Overconfidence -People tend to have excessive confidence in their own ability to successfully <lb/>perform a particular task or to make an accurate judgement, or in the likelihood of good <lb/>events. <lb/> Example: excessive belief in the ability to pick winning stocks. <lb/> Over-extrapolation -People often make predictions on the basis of only a few observations, <lb/>when these observations are not representative. <lb/> Example: using just a few years of past returns as a basis for judging future returns and <lb/>making investment decisions, without considering the extent to which past returns reflect <lb/>chance and particular circumstances. <lb/> Projection bias -People have a tendency to believe that their choices and preferences will <lb/>remain the same over time, and that there is only little room for change. <lb/> Example: tying up funds in long-term contracts without adequately considering the <lb/>chance of needing money in difficult circumstances before the contract matures, or not <lb/>realising that difficulties could arise in controlling the future credit card spending. <lb/> Mental accounting -Mental accounting describes how consumers tend to label money <lb/>according to how they intend to use it, and behave differently with their different types of <lb/> &quot; accounts &quot; . <lb/> Example: people may save at a low rate while borrowing at a high rate. <lb/> Narrow bracketing -Narrow bracketing refers to the fact that people often take decisions in <lb/>isolation, without giving consideration to their global (financial) context and risk exposure. <lb/> Example: making investment decisions asset-by-asset rather than considering the whole <lb/>portfolio. <lb/> Persuasion and social influence -Consumers may allow themselves to be persuaded or trust <lb/>the sales person because he or she comes across as &apos;likeable&apos; and therefore trustworthy. <lb/></body>

			<page>14 <lb/></page>

			<body>Emphasising good personality traits or overemphasising bad personality traits may substitute <lb/>for a reasoned judgement. <lb/> Example: relying on financial advice without giving thought to the effect of commission <lb/>or other economic incentives for the adviser on the advice received. <lb/> Endowment effect -The endowment effect (or status quo bias) is the fact that people often <lb/>demand much more to give up an object than they would be willing to pay to acquire it. <lb/> Example: consumers refusing or being reluctant to switch financial provider or bank, <lb/>although they know that the product or service provided is not tailored to their specific <lb/>needs. <lb/>Types of mitigation responses to bias <lb/>Choice architecture and framing -The concept of choice architecture was introduced by Thaler <lb/>and Sunstein (2008) and refers to the decision-making environment where many features, noticed and <lb/>unnoticed, can influence decisions. Choice architecture can be used to help individuals make better <lb/>choices (as judged by decision-makers themselves) without forcing certain outcomes upon anyone <lb/>( &quot; libertarian paternalism &quot; ). The number of choices presented, the manner in which attributes are <lb/>described, the presence of a &quot; default &quot; option are amongst the elements with can impact choices. This <lb/>approach seeks to design an environment in which better choice for consumers can be made to be the <lb/>easier choice. Framing is part of the overall concept of choice architecture and describes how people <lb/>tend to reach different conclusions or make different choices depending on how a situation or options <lb/>are presented to them. Framing includes multiple aspects: <lb/> Default option -Presenting one choice as a default or pre-set option can induce consumers to <lb/>choose that option, as a way to avoid the costs of making a decision, or assuming that whoever <lb/>set the default knew more about what is the right decision to make. <lb/> Example: automatic enrolment of employees in pension schemes through a pre-selected <lb/>option. <lb/> Attribute framing -Attribute framing involves influencing people&apos;s judgment of an object or <lb/>event by describing it in a positive or a negative manner, while its objective value remains <lb/>constant. The object or event will be evaluated more favourably when presented in a positive <lb/>frame than when presented more negatively. <lb/> Example: informing consumers that they will pay a 3 000 EUR up-front charge as <lb/>opposed to 3% when deciding whether or not to invest 100 000 EUR into an investment <lb/>product. <lb/> Salience effect -The salience effect will focus consumers&apos; attention on the particularly <lb/>important aspects of a situation, which can then have a marked influence on choice. Even if <lb/>information is standardised, a limited amount of simple text, meaningful numbers prominently <lb/>displayed and in the right order can have a large effect when consumers compare options. <lb/> Example: limiting the information provided to the most important features of a given <lb/>financial product perceived as complex (e.g. mortgage or consumer credit), and <lb/>providing pre-calculated and directly comparable relevant information. <lb/></body>

			<body>Research methods <lb/>As briefly outlined above (see section B.a.), behavioural economics research often makes use of <lb/>randomised controlled trials, which can either be performed in a laboratory, in which participants are <lb/>placed in a simulated environment where all factors affecting decision makers in a given situation can <lb/>be fully controlled, or in a real-life environment through a field experiment. The researcher can in <lb/>general draw statistically significant results from relatively small samples. RCTs involve two groups, <lb/>the control group and the treatment group. Individuals or groups of people receiving both interventions <lb/>are chosen at random and are as closely matched as possible. The control group receives the <lb/>equivalent of a placebo (i.e. nothing is changed substantially), while the treatment group faces <lb/>something new. Often researchers will want to know which of two or more interventions is the most <lb/>effective at attaining a specific, measurable outcome. Running tests with as many treatment groups as <lb/>there are researched options will lead to the identification of causal relationships. It will also help <lb/>confirm that the envisaged intervention is the best suited to solve the problem identified and that <lb/>robust measures are in place to evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention (UK Cabinet Office <lb/>Behavioural Insights Team, 2012). <lb/>Box 2. PRICE Lab: an experiment on how consumers value and compare complex products in Ireland <lb/>Since January 2013, the Central Bank of Ireland has become involved in a three-year multi-partner <lb/>research programme initiative which tests how consumers value and compare complex products. This initiative, <lb/>established by the Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI) Programme of Research Investigating <lb/>Consumer Evaluation (PRICE) Lab, is jointly funded by the Central Bank, the Competition and Consumer <lb/>Protection Commission (merger of the former National Consumer Agency and Competition Authority), the <lb/>Commission for Energy Regulation and Commission for Communications Regulation. The programme is <lb/>overseen by a Steering Group comprising representatives of each of the four funding partners, an independent <lb/>international academic expert, a senior representative from the ESRI and the Principal Investigator. <lb/>PRICE Lab is using computerised experiments (using hypothetical products) to investigate how samples of <lb/>Irish consumers initially learn to value a new product (using varied types and numbers of attributes, which give it <lb/>an overall value). It repeated the experiments using real products (including financial and other products) in <lb/>2015. The aim of the research is to provide empirical findings of use to policymakers in the areas of consumer <lb/>and competition policy. <lb/>D. <lb/>Applications in the financial services field <lb/>Behavioural economics is of relevance across a range of financial sectors and activities (banking, <lb/>investment, pensions, insurance, securities, etc.). Sectoral initiatives have also been taken to analyse <lb/>particular consumer traits in a given field and explore potential behavioural remedies, for example in <lb/>the specific context of financial education. A number of jurisdictions and agencies which are members <lb/>of the Task Force on Financial Consumer Protection have conducted behavioural economics research <lb/>in the field of financial services, developed policy papers or initiated policy or regulatory work based <lb/>on behavioural insights. <lb/>This section reviews recent work undertaken by financial regulators, which has either been <lb/>recorded and/or published, highlighting the main results and lessons learnt. <lb/></body>

			<page>16 <lb/></page>

			<body>The different initiatives are presented under three generic and broad categories of biases. 15 Since <lb/>decision-making is generally influenced by a combination of various factors, many of the examples <lb/>could however fall under more than one category. <lb/>It is important to keep in mind that many of the current behavioural insights are prospective at <lb/>this stage. The few regulatory or policy initiatives that are explicitly based on behavioural economic <lb/>findings are fairly new. There is not yet any evidence about their long-term impact, and they have not <lb/>yet been properly evaluated following implementation. <lb/>Impediments to effectively using information <lb/>The European Commission conducted a pilot study on consumer decision-making in retail <lb/>investment services in 2010 to observe through laboratory experiments how consumers reacted when <lb/>faced with a choice between different investment products and how they were affected by financial <lb/>advice. 16 <lb/>The study found that people struggled to make optimal investment choices even in the most <lb/>simplified of environments. It also confirmed that features of the retail investment market may make <lb/>consumer decisions particularly prone to biases and framing effects: subjects made worse investment <lb/>decisions when the optimal choice was harder to understand (fees framed as percentages, annual <lb/>returns not compounded over the duration of the investment), and they were disproportionately averse <lb/>to uncertainty (risky investments), ambiguity (incomplete information) and product complexity <lb/>(structured products). Standardising and reducing the amount of information provided helped subjects <lb/>identify the optimal choice between similar investments. Providing comparable pre-calculated <lb/>information on the net expected value of each investment helped subjects identify the optimal choice <lb/>between dissimilar investments. <lb/>The European Commission used the results of this study as part of its proposals to regulate the <lb/>sale of Packaged Retail and Insurance-based Investment Products (PRIIPS). 17 The provision of a &quot; Key <lb/>Information Document &quot; (KID) to all potential buyers of investment products is part of the 2012 <lb/>proposal for regulation. This KID will present short and plain-speaking information about the <lb/>investment product in a format easy to understand. Every manufacturer of investment products (e.g. <lb/>investment fund managers, insurers, banks) will have to produce such a document for each investment <lb/>product. Each KID will contain information on the product&apos;s main features, as well as the risks and <lb/>costs associated with the investment in that product. Information on risks will be as straight-forward <lb/>and comparable as possible, without over-simplifying often complex products. The KID will make <lb/>clear to every consumer whether or not they could lose money with a certain product and how <lb/>complex the product is. The KIDs will follow a common standard for the structure, content, and <lb/>presentation. It is intended that in this way, consumers will be able to use the document to compare <lb/>different investment products and ultimately choose the product that best suits their needs. <lb/></body>

			<page>17 <lb/></page>

			<body>To ensure that the detailed rules on presenting the information in KIDs under the PRIIPS <lb/>Regulation achieve the objective to best help consumers compare and select products for their <lb/>investment needs, the European Commission has conducted a further dedicated consumer testing <lb/>study. 18 The study used broad quantitative surveys supplemented by qualitative testing with focus <lb/>groups, across a representative sample of countries in the EU. The objective was not only to gather <lb/>consumer&apos;s preferences, but also objective insights on how far presentations aided a correct <lb/>understanding of the feature of PRIIPs and comparisons between them. To do this, many different <lb/>options for presenting risk, performance and cost information were examined. <lb/>The study showed that a graphic and streamlined presentation of risks using a single scale with <lb/>classes running from one to seven worked best. It also supported simpler presentations of performance <lb/>and costs information, including the use of tables. The testing clarified that while some respondents <lb/>expressed a preference for seeing detailed information, simpler information was in reality more <lb/>effective for understanding and comparisons. <lb/>The study results will feed directly into the work by the three European Supervisory Authorities 19 <lb/>on developing technical standards to set the further specifications of the details of the format and <lb/>content of the KID that they are elaborating. The study will ensure that European Consumers will <lb/>benefit from being provided KIDs that will explain the often complicated investment products in a <lb/>truly user-friendly way. <lb/>Regarding advised retail investment decisions and the disclosure of potential conflicts of interest, <lb/>the 2010 experiment showed in particular that the existence of a conflict of interest in the remit of the <lb/>advisor needs to be strongly emphasised ( &quot; health warning &quot; ) and its implications explicitly laid out (for <lb/>example, through the exact details of the advisor&apos;s remuneration structure), in order to impact people&apos;s <lb/>decisions. Disclosing conflicts of interest elicited a &quot; knee-jerk &quot; reaction when biased incentives were <lb/>disclosed. This led to better decisions when the advisor&apos;s and advisee&apos;s interests were adversely <lb/>aligned but worse decisions when their interests were aligned. Subjects lost trust even when an advisor <lb/>with misaligned incentives was not actually able to deceive them, showing that their reaction is <lb/>reflexive. The European Commission indicates that the provision of the new Regulation on better <lb/>disclosures about the features, risks and costs of products through the KID, and the overall improved <lb/>transparency of the investments themselves, will help enhance the quality and neutrality of advice 20 . <lb/>The Central Bank of Ireland conducted a review into the provision of annual statements to <lb/>consumers by life assurance firms, outlining the position of their investment product 21 . The purpose <lb/>was to establish how life assurance firms were complying with the new annual format required by the <lb/>2012 Consumer Protection Code, for personal pension products. The review covered the 10 largest life <lb/>assurance firms in Ireland. Overall, the Central Bank found that the vast majority of firms were in <lb/>compliance, but also identified a small number of examples of firms failing to produce new format <lb/>statements for pension policies. Where this was identified, firms were required to submit <lb/>18 Consumer testing study of the possible new format and content for retail disclosures of packaged retail and <lb/>insurance-based investment products: http://ec.europa.eu/finance/finservices-<lb/>retail/investment_products/index_en.htm#2015-consumer-testing-study <lb/>19 The European Banking Authority (EBA); the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA); and the <lb/>European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA) <lb/>20 The PRIIPS Regulation introducing the KID will become applicable as of 31 December 2016. <lb/>21 Review of Annual Personal Pension Statements, Central Bank of Ireland, 2014 <lb/></body>

			<body>implementation timelines for full compliance and commit to ensuring that all personal pension plan <lb/>consumers, regardless of when the policy was sold, would receive a new format annual statement. <lb/>The Central Bank also asked consumers, via focus groups, to identify what was working well in <lb/>terms of disclosure and where improvements to the annual statements could be made. Consumers in <lb/>the focus groups said that the following would be of benefit: <lb/> the use of &quot; plain English &quot; and clear distinct headings in the presentation of the statement <lb/> details of the projected retirement income expressed as a monetary value, with information on <lb/>what they could expect to get from their pension product when they retired <lb/> information on the investment funds, including risk and the type of fund to be clearly <lb/>highlighted on the statement including the location of the investments (for example, one firm <lb/>provided clear details of the different funds that the consumer&apos;s policy was invested in, <lb/>including the percentage breakdown of the investments under a separate heading titled <lb/> &quot; Investment Details &quot; ) <lb/> historical information on the performance of the policy (for example, one firm provided a <lb/>statement with numerical information across the full duration of the pension policy) <lb/> an indication on the annual statement of contribution gaps for the previous 12 months, as <lb/>opposed to the current practice which includes these notifications in separate communications <lb/> a link to a pension calculator so consumers can see whether they will have enough money <lb/>built up in their fund for when they retire <lb/> charges to be broken down into a euro value in the annual statement, and for all fees and <lb/>charges to be provided in one location with a monetary total <lb/> an indication regarding consumers&apos; eligibility for state pension. <lb/>The findings from the focus group discussions were communicated to the life insurance firms <lb/>reviewed, with an invitation to consider them in their communication with their personal pension plan <lb/>and other investment customers. <lb/>In 2015, the UK Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) undertook a survey to investigate how well <lb/>consumers understand and value structured deposits, a class of complex products. 22 The FCA <lb/>conducted a behavioural experiment involving more than 380 retail investors who had previously <lb/>bought or would consider buying structured deposits or other structured products. Investors were <lb/>shown hypothetical examples of five popular types of products with returns linked to the performance <lb/>of the FTSE100 stock index. Investors&apos; expectations about FTSE100 returns were compared with the <lb/>returns they expected from different structured products. Biases in how respondents evaluate the <lb/>structured deposits relative to the index could then be calculated. Investors were asked to rank the <lb/>structured deposits against a range of fixed rate deposits and taking into account the risk of return of <lb/></body>

			<page>19 <lb/></page>

			<body>the different structured deposits. The impact of various types of disclosure on respondents&apos; valuations <lb/>was also examined. <lb/>The main findings of the experience showed that: <lb/> While investors&apos; expectations of the FTSE growth were on average well aligned with the <lb/>assumptions of the model, investors significantly overestimated the expected returns of all <lb/>structured deposits, including the most simple. Their expectations were also significantly <lb/>higher than returns from the quantitative model. <lb/> Although all five structured deposits would have been unlikely to return more than simple <lb/>fixed-term cash deposits, respondents did not recognise this. Investors required relatively high <lb/>rates of return on risk-free cash deposits to value them over and above structured deposits. <lb/> The disclosure of likely product returns and risk had some effect on investors&apos; ability to adjust <lb/>for initial incorrect valuations. Investors who had initially overestimated returns or <lb/>underestimated risk of return were more likely to adjust their valuations following further <lb/>information. <lb/> Giving the investors information on what would happen under hypothetical scenarios had little <lb/>effect on product revaluation, while quantitative model returns -telling investors what likely <lb/>product returns are based on the quantitative model -induced a larger devaluation of <lb/>structured deposits. The relatively minor adjustment of valuations by investors (0.41%) shows <lb/>the need to be cautious about what can be achieved through providing information. <lb/>In New Zealand, research on behavioural economics identified the main implications for the <lb/>development of policy for financial product disclosure, with a focus on investment products. 23 The <lb/>conclusions from this work were that disclosures are most effective at aiding investor decision making <lb/>when they are: <lb/> Short and simple -research highlights the importance of keeping disclosure documents brief <lb/>and straightforward to address issues of choice and information overload and the difficulties <lb/>that many investors can have with complex and technical information. <lb/> Standardised -many biases, limitations and heuristics can be mitigated through standardising <lb/>the content of disclosures. Standardisation also aids the comparability of information. <lb/> Clear about risks and benefits -disclosure of risk is necessary to address potential issues of <lb/>overconfidence and appropriate disclosure of benefits is necessary to overcome status quo bias <lb/>and loss aversion. <lb/> Meaningful -information needs to be put in context and presented in a way that is meaningful <lb/>for investors. The more that information can be put in a form that people relate to, the more <lb/>likely they are to understand it. <lb/></body>

			<body> Well presented -information needs to be presented in a way that makes people want to read <lb/>disclosure documents and that aids decision making. How options or prospects are framed in <lb/>disclosure documents can elicit emotional responses and influence the decisions made. The <lb/>use of graphs and other visual representations can assist in the understanding of complex <lb/>information, but need to be designed with care. <lb/> Tested on investors -research indicates that people can act in unexpected ways. Even small <lb/>changes to the way that information is presented can influence how people perceive or <lb/>interpret information. <lb/>The report also highlights that it is important that key behavioural insights are seen in the broader <lb/>context of what a disclosure regime seeks to achieve (for example, a short and succinct document is <lb/>not an end in itself if it fails to convey the necessary information), in order to effectively aid investors&apos; <lb/>understanding and decision making. <lb/>In terms of investor education, the International Organisation of Securities Commissions <lb/>(IOSCO) has identified practices to help guide members in developing and enhancing their own <lb/>investor education and financial literacy programmes. 24 The report includes, in particular: <lb/> A list of behavioural responses in financial decision-making that have important implications <lb/>for the design of investor education and financial literacy strategies (Appendix 2). <lb/> A behavioural economics literature review with a specific focus on financial education <lb/>(Appendix 3). <lb/>Influences on behaviour and perception <lb/>In Italy, the financial regulator Consob reviewed questionnaires used by 20 investment firms to <lb/>assess their potential clients&apos; risk attitude before proposing an investment product. The objective was <lb/>to identify major shortcomings, based, in particular, on behavioural insights, and suggest <lb/>improvements. 25 <lb/>The study concludes that several limitations affect the content of the questionnaires used, in <lb/>particular: <lb/> Questions used to assess customers&apos; investment knowledge and experience are poor: they <lb/>often rely on individuals&apos; self-evaluation and are not aimed at verifying familiarity with basic <lb/>notions like the relationship between risk and expected return and portfolio diversification. <lb/> Consumers&apos; risk attitude is generally elicited jointly with preferences on the time horizon and <lb/>investment aims. This format has been criticised, in particular by behavioural economists, <lb/>because risk preferences and the risk profile should be assessed independently from the other <lb/>elements which must be gathered when formulating an investment recommendation, since <lb/>each of these variables is influenced by different factors (for example, risk preferences and <lb/>risk profile are attributable to sociometric, psychological and behavioural factors, while the <lb/>24 Strategic framework for investor education and financial literacy, IOSCO, CR03/14, 2014 <lb/>25 Assessing investors&apos; risk tolerance through a questionnaire, Consob Italy, 2012 <lb/></body>

			<page>21 <lb/></page>

			<body>time horizon and investment objectives depend on economic and financial factors, the level of <lb/>impatience, etc.). <lb/> The way questions on risk attitude are worded lacks the stylistic and lexical devices which, <lb/>according to behavioural finance, may be useful in enhancing the reliability of the answers <lb/>potentially affected by the client&apos;s cognitive and behavioural biases. <lb/>An example of a behavioural experiment undertaken by the FCA UK formed part of its market <lb/>study on general insurance products commonly sold as add-ons, i.e. general insurance sold alongside <lb/>other (primary) products either at the same time or subsequently, like travel insurance sold alongside a <lb/>holiday. 26 <lb/>The study investigated whether there were common patterns across add-on markets that <lb/>weakened competition and drove poor consumer outcomes. As part of the experiment, variations were <lb/>introduced on the sales and price formats and the point at which add-ons were proposed (standalone <lb/>insurance, add-on upfront alongside the primary product, add-on revealed only at point of sale for the <lb/>primary product). This helped identify the effects on the extent and effectiveness of shopping around <lb/>and on the add-on take up. <lb/>Amongst the main findings of the study: <lb/> The complexity of comparing multiple prices (of the primary and the add-on products) at the <lb/>same time without a clear total did not discourage consumers from shopping around for <lb/>insurance, although it made them slightly less willing to look at primary product alternatives. <lb/>However, added complexity -even without delaying the introduction of the add-on until the <lb/>point of sale -made consumers much more likely to be unable to identify the best deals <lb/>available to them. <lb/> Lower transparency due to add-ons being revealed only at the point of sale significantly <lb/>exacerbates poor consumer outcomes. This element of the add-on mechanism was the most <lb/>consistent in producing material detrimental effects on the outcome metrics studied in the <lb/>experiment -including shopping around, prices paid and the quality of consumers&apos; decisions. <lb/> Monthly pricing for annual contracts was another mechanism that had consistent, if smaller, <lb/>detrimental effects across most types of outcomes. Surprisingly, however, even though <lb/>presenting prices in monthly terms reduced the extent and effectiveness of shopping around, <lb/>the fact that insurance &apos;looked cheaper&apos; did not have an effect on consumers&apos; willingness to <lb/>buy it overall. <lb/> Consumers are, in principle, willing to engage with stand-alone alternatives when those are <lb/>easy to access at the point of sale, and benefit considerably from doing this. However, the <lb/>beneficial effects start to diminish quickly when there are barriers to accessing those <lb/>alternatives, even if these barriers are much smaller than the ones consumers face in real life. <lb/>Overall, the FCA UK concluded that the add-on mechanism weakens consumers&apos; ability to <lb/>discipline firms by shopping around and comparing products effectively.

			<body>looked at for remedies include: a ban on pre-ticked boxes to challenge consumer inertia, publication of <lb/>claims ratios to reduce information asymmetries, and improvements to the way add-ons are offered <lb/>through price-comparison sites. <lb/>In Australia, the Australian Securities and Investment Commission (ASIC) embarked on a <lb/>laboratory experiment which aimed at exploring how behavioural biases may influence preferences <lb/>towards hybrid securities over the less complex financial products of bonds and shares. 27 Participants <lb/>were asked to invest 100 units between three investment options for 10 years, and were informed that <lb/>they would be paid on the outcome of their investment. In each of the experiments, the government <lb/>bond option was provided as a default low risk option and 5 out of the 6 possible choices also offered <lb/>company shares. The expected interest rate/dividend between three options was altered (3.75%, <lb/>4.75%, and 5.75% per annum). Findings show that the behavioural biases and risk attitudes that <lb/>influence investment in hybrid securities include: <lb/> the illusion of control that investors can exert over their environment and influence the <lb/>outcomes. In the context of hybrid securities, it meant that consumers believed they could <lb/>withdraw &quot; in time &quot; from their investment. <lb/> investors&apos; overconfidence on their ability to withdraw from an investment early and <lb/>consequently be protected from risks <lb/> a framing bias regarding the formulation of the choice in favour of hybrid securities. Many of <lb/>the risks of hybrid securities are not immediately apparent, which makes the risk/return trade-<lb/>off more appealing than shares and bonds <lb/> &quot; ambiguity aversion &quot; or a preference of known risks over unknown risks. Ambiguity averse <lb/>participants preferred &quot; higher yet familiar &quot; risk of investing in shares to &quot; lower but less <lb/>understood &quot; risk of investing in hybrids. <lb/> investors&apos; risk perception and attitudes. Hybrids were seen to be riskier than shares and bonds <lb/>on two counts: distrust of issuers/products and poor knowledge of the product. However, <lb/>acknowledging the difficulty in understanding hybrid securities did not deter participants from <lb/>buying them. <lb/>The familiarity of the brand of issuers did not affect investment in hybrids, which may indicate <lb/>that where information is provided in a succinct and standardised manner, the effect of a brand name <lb/>may be negligible. <lb/>Presentation factors that affect decision-making <lb/>The FCA UK has conducted a research on how to encourage consumers to claim redress <lb/>following the mis-selling of financial products. 28 Work was conducted on a real case, with a firm that <lb/>voluntarily wrote to almost 200 000 customers about a failing of its sales process. Mis-sold customers <lb/>needed to answer questions raised in the letter to get redress. The firm&apos;s original letter, written in good <lb/>faith, had a very low response rate. Different potential improvements to the firm&apos;s letter were tested <lb/></body>

			<body>using an RCT, with a view to increasing the level of customers&apos; response. The letter was modified <lb/>with simple amendments, including reducing the amount of text, explaining to readers that the claims&apos; <lb/>process would only take five minutes, putting the main thrust of the message in bullets at the top of the <lb/>letter, adding an &quot; act quickly &quot; label on the envelope and the FSA logo on the letter and replacing the <lb/>generic &quot; Customer Team &quot; signature by the CEO&apos;s. Reminders were also sent. <lb/>Overall, the rate of responses jumped by over 10%. Individually: <lb/> Salient bullets had the largest single effect. <lb/> Simplification and claims process almost doubled the response rate. <lb/> The label on the envelope had only a small positive effect. <lb/> There was no impact of the FSA logo. <lb/> The reminder had clear interaction effects. <lb/>Unexpectedly, there was a small but statistically significant decrease in response using the CEO&apos;s <lb/>signature. <lb/>The FCA has undertaken an analysis of holders of savings accounts with short-term high interest <lb/>rates who do not transfer their money when the rate falls because of behavioural biases, such as <lb/>undervaluing long-term gains relative to short-term costs (present bias) or paying insufficient attention <lb/>to their savings choices (limited attention). 29 The FCA has carried out a trial in partnership with a large <lb/>UK financial institution involving over 20 000 savings account customers whose interest rate was <lb/>about to decrease or had just decreased. All of these customers had already received a letter two to <lb/>three months before the rate decrease informing them of this. The paper investigates the effects on <lb/>switching behaviour of an additional letter, different messages in the reminder and the timing of the <lb/>reminder. <lb/>Results show that: <lb/> Reminders make a notable difference to switching behaviour around the time of interest rate <lb/>decreases. The very fact of getting a reminder is more important than the precise phrasing of <lb/>the reminder. <lb/> Customers who received a reminder in which the cash loss from not switching accounts was <lb/>salient (i.e. &apos;£X less interest per year&apos;) or in which the cash gain was salient (i.e. &apos;Move your <lb/>savings and earn up to £X more&apos;), among other changes, were slightly more likely to switch or <lb/>transfer money than those who received a reminder without any particular emphasis. <lb/> Sending a reminder letter before the interest rate decrease increased switching compared with <lb/>not sending a reminder. While switching to a comparable account within the firm decreased, <lb/>moving money elsewhere -switching to a different firm or other behaviour -increased. <lb/> Sending a reminder after the rate decrease also led to more switching compared with not <lb/>sending a reminder, but only by encouraging customers to open a new comparable account <lb/>with the same firm. It had no detectable effect on switching or transferring elsewhere. <lb/></body>

			<body> While customers over 60 years old or with balances above the median were more likely to <lb/>switch in general, reminders increased the rate of switching across all customers including <lb/>younger customers and those with lower balances. <lb/>In the context of a potential Competition and Markets Authority investigation into personal <lb/>current accounts, the FCA in 2015 wanted to understand the impact of previous initiatives that were <lb/>intended to help consumers manage their current accounts -provision of annual summaries of any <lb/>charges, refunds or interest, access to text alerts on account balance levels and charges, as well as to <lb/>mobile apps which allow consumers to spend, save and check their balances on-the-go. 30 <lb/></body>

			<page>25 <lb/></page>

			<body>Using statistical analysis of data from two large banks, including granular data on 500 000 <lb/>customers from one bank, the study shows that: <lb/> Annual summaries, as designed by the banks looked at, have no effect on consumer behaviour <lb/>in terms of incurring overdraft charges, altering balance levels or switching to other current <lb/>account providers. <lb/> Signing up to text alerts or mobile banking apps reduces the amount of unarranged overdraft <lb/>charges incurred. <lb/> Signing up to both services has an additional effect, and shows the benefit of receiving <lb/>information upon automatic triggers, without having to actively acquire it, as well as the <lb/>facility to act quickly upon receiving information. Text alerts and mobile banking apps also <lb/>decrease average current account balances, which is beneficial for consumers as they reduce <lb/>the cost of holding balances in accounts with no (or low) credit interest. Consumers who sign <lb/>up to these services are also more likely to become inactive at their bank, which is measured <lb/>using the number and value of consumers&apos; credits and debits per month. This suggests that <lb/>these services facilitate banking with multiple providers. <lb/>E. <lb/>Application in developing economies <lb/>The application of behavioural insights in emerging markets and developing economies is <lb/>especially important, due to the nature of both the financial markets of those countries (e.g. fast pace <lb/>of innovation) and many of their financial consumers (large part of first time users of formal finance, <lb/>impact of having a low and variable income). Studies conducted so far identify the areas which are <lb/>most affected by consumers&apos; biases and could require some policy interventions. They also confirm <lb/>(see footnote 5) that financial institutions and bank staff can be biased, and this will potentially impact <lb/>the service provided to consumers. <lb/>In 2014, the Consultative Group to Assist the Poor (CGAP) produced a paper focused on <lb/>emerging markets and developing economies and presents early evidence on some of the most relevant <lb/>behavioural insights in those markets with high concentration of base-of-the-pyramid (BOP) <lb/>consumers. 31 The paper explores how behavioural research can offer important tools for effective <lb/>policy-making. <lb/>Four priority consumer protection topics with specific implications in BOP settings were <lb/>reviewed: disclosure, transparency, and product choice; complaints handling and recourse; credit <lb/>market regulation and debt stress; and fair treatment. <lb/>CGAP notes that knowledge and experience on which approaches will work best to protect <lb/>financial consumers is very limited at this time. However, evidence suggests the power of several key <lb/>behavioural concepts to improve outcomes: <lb/> Scarcity -Many cognitive biases tend to be widespread and do not align neatly with the <lb/>socioeconomic context. However, there is a need to generate and apply insights into the role <lb/>scarcity plays in financial and other decisions taken by many BOP consumers, and design <lb/>policies that factor in its effects. <lb/></body>

			<page>26 <lb/></page>

			<body> Improved information for consumer choice and use -Increasing the volume of information <lb/>provided to consumers is not always the best way to facilitate decision-making and <lb/>understanding. Two alternatives should be considered: putting in place measures such as <lb/>default options that nudge consumer behaviour and improve outcomes, and simplifying the <lb/>information available to consumers and/or choices that would improve the effectiveness of <lb/>consumers&apos; comparison, selection, and use of financial products. <lb/> Salience -Financial information should be made more relevant to a consumer&apos;s personal <lb/>context to improve their understanding and decision-making. Connections to different points <lb/>in a consumer&apos;s daily activities or lifecycle events can make information more meaningful, <lb/>increase their receptivity to the messages, and bring greater changes in their behaviour. <lb/> The intention-action gap -Research should be undertaken to understand how contextual issues <lb/>-both perceived and subconscious -contribute to gaps in individuals&apos; preferences and <lb/>decisions and the behaviours they exhibit. This analysis should be used to design policy <lb/>measures that tackle the underlying issues. <lb/> Drivers of provider behaviour -Factors that affect the behaviour of financial service providers <lb/>and their staff, which may in turn reflect a complicated mix of short-term incentives as well as <lb/>their perceptions of consumers should be explored. This would help design policy measures <lb/>that shift providers&apos; behaviour and incentives and produce better long-run outcomes for <lb/>consumers (and often for providers, too). <lb/>The CGAP paper clarifies that it only offers some starting hypotheses on how behavioural biases <lb/>may shape consumer protection problems and potential solutions, while stressing the importance of <lb/>sourcing and applying insights specific to each market and key consumer segments within those <lb/>markets. It adds that it is critical to increase experimentation with behaviourally informed consumer <lb/>protection policy-making in emerging markets and developing economies, and to build better tools and <lb/>a stronger evidence base. <lb/>F. <lb/>Opportunities and challenges for the application of behavioural insights in the field of <lb/>financial services <lb/>Key elements for an optimal application of a behavioural approach in the field of financial services <lb/>Efficient application of a behavioural economics approach to financial services requires that <lb/>regulators and policy-makers have an extensive knowledge of the main biases leading consumers to <lb/>make mistakes of judgement and that they are able to identify the products/services causing the main <lb/>problems. They must also define the most appropriate response to the problems identified. A <lb/>behavioural approach will only bring possible solutions to problems caused by the psychological <lb/>aspects of the decision-making process of consumers. It is not intended to solve problems it is not <lb/>meant to address. <lb/>Behaviourally-inspired solutions should therefore be used as complements, not as alternatives, to <lb/>existing initiatives. They are an additional tool for policy-makers, regulators and supervisors, in order <lb/>to make public interventions more flexible and less stringent, but more effective (FCA, 2013). The <lb/>asymmetry of information between financial institutions or intermediaries and consumers still needs to <lb/>be addressed and it is important that strict requirements are imposed to financial services providers. <lb/>But it was evidenced that the mandatory disclosure of extensive information, by itself, cannot cater for <lb/>the various needs of consumers. The extent, the format, the point at which the information has to be <lb/></body>

			<page>27 <lb/></page>

			<body>delivered, and the moment when it needs to reach the consumer also need to be carefully considered, <lb/>possibly through tools using nudges and other framing effects. <lb/>Behavioural economics should be integrated into the broader context of the policy/regulatory <lb/>analysis, and the overall impact of the set of measures has to be assessed, with particular regard to <lb/>their likely effectiveness in the long-term and their impact on innovation. The other (structural or <lb/>systematic) problems of the market should also be considered, and the package of solutions/corrective <lb/>measures in one field should not have any unintended negative effects on any other field (FCA, 2013). <lb/>Challenges for regulators and policy-makers <lb/>The results of behavioural economics studies and research are/have been (mis)used or utilised by <lb/>firms, including financial institutions, to trigger or exacerbate consumers&apos; biases. Product design, <lb/>marketing techniques or sales processes sometimes build on consumers&apos; misbeliefs and intuitive <lb/>judgements and decision making to enhance sales and profits. There is a need to work with firms to <lb/>demonstrate and convince them that &quot; de-biasing &quot; consumers is also in their best interests, as it will <lb/>stimulate fair and open market competition (Van Bavel et al., 2013). <lb/>The &quot; paternalistic &quot; approach induced by behavioural economics has to be used with care, and in <lb/>this respect, reservations on the whole behavioural economics approach have been expressed (for <lb/>example Loewenstein and Hubel, 2010). Introducing a behavioural approach to regulation and policy-<lb/>making raises fundamental questions for regulators and policy-makers: can they or should they decide <lb/>or determine what is in consumers&apos; best interests? To what extent and when can they advise <lb/>consumers on what is good for them? To what extent would this approach respect consumers&apos; freedom <lb/>of choice and freedom to make mistakes? It seems that there are two limits. Firstly, that the <lb/>consumer&apos;s errors have not occurred due to misleading or unfair practices of providers, and secondly <lb/>that the sum of individual consumers&apos; misbehaviours does not negatively affect the economy as a <lb/>whole (financial crisis). Reasonable consumer choices should not be questioned and this supposes that <lb/>what consumers really value is well known and understood. <lb/>There might be a need for principles and guidelines which the policy-makers and regulators <lb/>should follow to better incorporate behavioural insights into their initiatives. <lb/>G. <lb/>Conclusions <lb/>Financial decisions involve making difficult choices that often impact the wellbeing of consumers <lb/>and of their families over the long-term. As many other choices made by human beings, those <lb/>decisions are not always consistent and rational. Getting a better understanding of consumers&apos; <lb/>decision-making processes is therefore important to mitigate the influence of the behavioural biases <lb/>known to (negatively) influence economic and financial decisions. <lb/>Behavioural economics research has shown that measures informed by consumers&apos; biases and <lb/>resulting behaviours can have a positive effect on the efficiency of the regulatory and policy <lb/>framework. <lb/>As stated in the Effective approaches to support the implementation of the G20/OECD High <lb/>Level Principles on Financial Consumer Protection, regulators and supervisors can use the insights <lb/>gained through behavioural economics research to inform their approach to potential remedies to <lb/>help consumers. <lb/></body>

			<page>28 <lb/></page>

			<body>The G20/OECD Task Force on Financial Consumer Protection supports the need for further work <lb/>and analysis to explore the benefits and the challenges of adopting a behavioural economics approach <lb/>to policy, regulation and supervision, with a view to improving the outcomes for the consumers of <lb/>financial products and services. <lb/>The existing corpus of behavioural economics research shows that behaviourally-inspired policy <lb/>and regulatory and supervisory responses have a positive effect on the efficiency and effectiveness of <lb/>national consumer protection frameworks. A number of initiatives led by Task Force Members have <lb/>confirmed the promising results of using behavioural economic insights to design specific <lb/>interventions which can act as additional tools to more conventional &quot; hard &quot; legislative interventionist <lb/>measures. <lb/>At this early stage of the implementation of behavioural economics solutions to financial <lb/>consumer protection problems, there is a need to initiate an exchange of experiences and of good <lb/>practices not only within the G20/OECD Task Force on Financial Consumer Protection but with a <lb/>much wider audience of policy makers, regulators, supervisors and other stakeholders. Findings from <lb/>further research projects, lessons learnt from the implementation of measures, as well as evidence <lb/>about the long-term impact of these measures are specifically of mutual interest and should be shared <lb/>in the future. <lb/></body>

			<body>ANNEX: COMPILATION AND SUMMARY OF SELECTED KEY STUDIES, REPORTS <lb/>AND ARTICLES ON BEHAVIOURAL ECONOMICS APPLIED TO FINANCIAL SERVICES <lb/>Academics and think tanks <lb/>The Power of Suggestion: Inertia in 401(k) Participation and Savings Behavior -Brigitte C. <lb/>Madrian and Dennis F. Shea, Quarterly Journal of Economics, 2001 <lb/>The paper analyses the impact of automatic enrolment on the most common US types of <lb/>employer-sponsored retirement savings plans, known as &quot; 401(k) &quot; . It highlights first that 401(k) <lb/>participation is significantly higher under automatic enrolment. Second, a substantial fraction of <lb/>401(k) participants hired under automatic enrolment retain both the default contribution rate and fund <lb/>allocation even though few employees hired before automatic enrolment picked this particular <lb/>outcome. This &quot; default &quot; behaviour appears to result from participant inertia and from employee <lb/>perceptions of the default as investment advice. These findings have implications for the design of <lb/>401(k) savings plans as well as for any type of Social Security reform that includes personal accounts <lb/>over which individuals have control. They also shed light more generally on the importance of both <lb/>economic and noneconomic (behavioural) factors in the determination of individual savings <lb/>behaviour. <lb/>Libertarian Paternalism -Richard H. Thaler and Cass R. Sunstein, American Economic Review, <lb/>2003 <lb/>The paper explores how it is both possible and legitimate for private and public institutions to <lb/>affect individual&apos;s behaviour and decisions while also respecting their freedom of choice. Often <lb/>people&apos;s preferences are ill-formed, and their choices will inevitably be influenced by default rules, <lb/>framing effects, and starting points. In these circumstances, a form of paternalism cannot be avoided. <lb/>The report argues that equipped with an understanding of behavioural findings of bounded rationality <lb/>and bounded self-control, libertarian paternalists should attempt to steer people&apos;s choices in welfare-<lb/>promoting directions without eliminating freedom of choice. It is also possible to show how a <lb/>libertarian paternalist might select among the possible options and to assess how much choice to offer. <lb/>The article gives examples from many areas, including savings behaviour, labour law, and consumer <lb/>protection. <lb/>Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion -Robert B. Cialdini, Revised Edition 2006 <lb/>The book explains the psychology of why people say &quot;yes&quot; and how to apply these <lb/>understandings. The author has identified six principles of influence (also known as the six weapons of <lb/>influence) through experimental studies, and by immersing himself in the world of what he called <lb/>&quot;compliance professionals&quot; -salespeople, fund raisers, recruiters, advertisers, marketers etc. Those six <lb/>principles are reciprocity; commitment (and consistency); social proof; liking; authority; and scarcity. <lb/>Why incoherent preferences do not justify paternalism -Robert Sugden, Constitutional Political <lb/>Economy, 2008 <lb/></body>

			<page>32 <lb/></page>

			<body>The report underlines that the arguments emerging from behavioural economics claim to <lb/>undermine the credibility, and even the conceptual coherence, of the economist&apos;s traditional rejection <lb/>of paternalism. Some suggest that the incoherent nature of individuals or consumers&apos; preferences <lb/>inevitably implies a form of paternalism. However, this conception would presuppose a &quot; planner &quot; with <lb/>the responsibility to collate information about individuals&apos; preferences and well-being and then, <lb/>guided by that information, to promote the overall social good. The paper argues that, in this context, <lb/>there is a viable alternative to paternalism: markets operate according to a system of economic <lb/>organisation that is structured by mutual advantage, i.e. each transaction, considered in isolation, <lb/>furthers the interests of everyone who is a party to it. This approach does not require consumers&apos; <lb/>preferences to be coherent. <lb/>Nudge: Improving Decisions about Health, Wealth, and Happiness -Richard H. Thaler and Cass <lb/>R. Sunstein, Yale University Press, 2008 <lb/>Human beings often make bad decisions involving education, personal finance, health care, <lb/>mortgages and credit cards, the family, and the planet itself. They are susceptible to various biases that <lb/>can lead them to blunder. The book takes humanness as a given and shows that by knowing how <lb/>people think, choice environments can be designed that make it easier for people to choose what is <lb/>best for themselves, their families, and their society. It demonstrates how thoughtful &quot; choice <lb/>architecture &quot; can be established to nudge people in beneficial directions without restricting freedom of <lb/>choice. <lb/>Behaviourally informed financial services regulation -Michael S. Barr, Sendhil Mullainathan and <lb/>Eldar Shafir, Asset Building Programme/New America Foundation, 2008 <lb/>The paper adopts a behavioural economic framework that considers firm incentives to respond to <lb/>regulation. Under this framework, outcomes are an equilibrium interaction between individuals with <lb/>specific psychologies and firms that respond to those psychologies within specific market contexts. <lb/>Regulation must then address failures in this equilibrium. The model suggests, for example, that in <lb/>some contexts market participants seek to overcome common human failings (as for example, with <lb/>under-saving) while in other contexts market participants seek to exploit these failings (as for <lb/>example, with over-borrowing). Behaviourally informed regulation needs to take account of these <lb/>different contexts. The paper discusses the specific application of these forces to mortgage, credit card, <lb/>and banking markets. The purpose of this paper is to illustrate how a behaviourally informed <lb/>regulatory analysis would lead to a deeper understanding of the costs and benefits of specific policies. <lb/>Bank Herding and Incentive Systems as Catalysts for the Financial Crisis -Peter Haiss, IUP <lb/>Journal of Behavioral Finance, 2010 <lb/>Rooted in regulatory economics and behavioural finance, the paper offers a taxonomy of effects <lb/>that narrows the scope of the banks&apos; decision making into a funnel-shape and thus, prepares the <lb/>ground for a financial crisis. The overall conclusion of the paper is that inconsistent decision rules, <lb/>rigid bank regulations, stakeholder-focused incentive structures within banks and uncritical adoption <lb/>of innovations may force banks into decisions that are micro-functional, but macro-dysfunctional. <lb/>Behavioural aspects play a key role in the suggested remedies on the regulatory side (macroprudential <lb/>regulation, supervision of incentives) and on the banking side (proper reward systems and structured <lb/>decision making) to re-establish prudent banking. <lb/></body>

			<body>Behavioural economics as applied to firms: a primer -Mark Amstrong and Steffen Huck, <lb/>Competition Policy International, 2010 <lb/>The paper discusses the literatures on behavioural economics, bounded rationality, and <lb/>experimental economics as they apply to firm behaviour in markets. In much of the behavioural <lb/>economics studies, the assumption is that firms are fully rational and aim to maximize their profits. <lb/>However, firms sometimes depart from the profit-maximizing objective, for various reasons discussed <lb/>in the paper, such as the impact of imitative and &quot; satisficing &quot; (satisfying + sufficing) behaviour, <lb/>outcomes when managers care about their position relative to peers, the employment of managers <lb/>whose objective diverge from profit-maximization (including managers who are overconfident or base <lb/>pricing decisions on sunk costs), the impact of social preferences on the ability to collude, and the <lb/>incentive for profit-maximizing firms to mimic irrational behaviour. <lb/>Consumer Financial Protection -John Y. Campbell, Howell E. Jackson, Brigitte C. Madrian and <lb/>Peter Tufano, Journal of Economic Perspectives, 2011 <lb/>The recent financial crisis has led many to question how well businesses deliver services and how <lb/>well regulatory institutions address problems in consumer financial markets. This paper discusses <lb/>consumer financial regulation, emphasizing the full range of arguments for regulation that derive from <lb/>market failure and from limited consumer rationality in financial decision making. Three case studies <lb/>are presented — mortgage markets, payday lending, and financing retirement consumption—to <lb/>illustrate the need for, and limits of, regulation. The paper argues that if regulation is to be beneficial, <lb/>it must be tailored to specific problems and must be accompanied by research to measure the <lb/>effectiveness of regulatory interventions. <lb/>Behavioral economics: implications for regulatory behaviour -James C. Cooper, George Mason <lb/>University School of Law; William E. Kovacic, Journal of Regulatory Economics, 2012 <lb/>This paper considers how biases affect regulatory decisions, in the case of a regulator who serves <lb/>as an agent to a political overseer. The regulator chooses a policy that accounts for the rewards he/she <lb/>receives from the political overseer—whose optimal policy is assumed to maximize short-run outputs <lb/>that garner political support, rather than long-term welfare outcomes—and the weight the regulator <lb/>puts on the optimal long run policy. Flawed heuristics and myopia are likely to lead regulators to adopt <lb/>policies closer to the preferences of political overseers than they would otherwise. The incentive <lb/>structure for regulators is likely to reward those who adopt politically expedient policies, either <lb/>intentionally (due to a desire to please the political overseer) or accidentally (due to bounded <lb/>rationality). The paper urges that careful thought be given to calls for greater state intervention, <lb/>especially when those calls seek to correct firm biases. It proposes measures that focus rewards to <lb/>regulators on outcomes rather than outputs as a way to help ameliorate regulatory biases. <lb/>Consumer Protection: Bounded Rationality and Regulation (La protection du consommateur : <lb/>rationalité limitée et régulation) -Xavier Gabaix, Augustin Landier and David Thesmar, Conseil <lb/>d&apos;Analyse économique, 2012 <lb/>This report examines the foundations for consumer protection and the regulatory procedures <lb/>required to ensure such protection. In practice, the consumer does not necessarily behave in the ways <lb/>supposed in microeconomic analysis of consumer guides. Imperfect information and bounded <lb/>rationality cannot be managed or corrected by self-regulation alone. In many cases, intervention by the <lb/>public authorities is essential. Such intervention takes the form of both ex ante regulations (prior <lb/>definition of requirements and constraints) and ex post regulations (recourse under the law and <lb/>sanctions, etc.). The report results in a number of proposals, some of which are aimed at making major <lb/></body>

			<page>34 <lb/></page>

			<body>improvements to information available to the consumer; others are related to ex post regulation. The <lb/>report proposes more severe administrative fines (imposed by the Directorate General for Competition <lb/>Policy, Consumer Affairs and Fraud Control, DGCCRF, part of the Ministry of Economy). It <lb/>advocates the acknowledgement of class action in France. <lb/>Behavioral Economics and Behavior Change -David Laibson, Harvard University, presentation at <lb/>the 2013 conference of the American Association for the Advancement of Science/European <lb/>Commission Joint Research Centre <lb/>Behavioural economics explains why people often fail to act in their own best interest and are <lb/>often influenced by the fact that costs come early and benefits come late. The presentation shows that <lb/>this self-defeating behaviour can be changed using inexpensive, scalable interventions: defaults and <lb/>other nudges/interventions have already made a big difference, for example for contributions to <lb/>savings schemes. The author advises policymakers not to rely on doctrine or introspection, but to <lb/>focus on data and small scale experiments. Finding answers to two key questions should help them <lb/>drive the process: which behaviours would they like to influence, and how can they transform good <lb/>intentions into long-lasting actions? <lb/>Learning in the Credit Card Market -Sumit Agarwal, John C. Driscoll, Xavier Gabaix and David <lb/>Laibson, 2013 <lb/>The paper measures learning dynamics using a panel with four million monthly credit card <lb/>statements. It studies add-on fees, specifically cash advance, late payment, and over-limit fees. New <lb/>credit card accounts generate fee payments of over USD 16 per month. Through negative feedback — <lb/>i.e. paying a fee — consumers learn to avoid triggering future fees. Paying a fee last month reduces <lb/>the likelihood of paying a fee this month by about 40%. Controlling for account fixed effects, monthly <lb/>fee payments fall by 75% during the first three years of account life. We find that learning is not <lb/>monotonic. Knowledge depreciates about 10% per month, implying that learning displays a strong <lb/>recency effect. <lb/>The Nature of the Beast: What Behavioral Economics Is Not -Matthew Darling, Saugato Datta, <lb/>and Sendhil Mullainathan, The Center for Global Development, 2013 <lb/>The paper seeks to remove misconceptions about behavioural economics, and for this defines the <lb/>concept by what it is not: behavioural economics is not about controlling behaviour, as behavioural <lb/>tools are about helping people to make the choices that they themselves want to make; behavioural <lb/>economics is not Liberal (or Conservative), as it has being picked up and used by a wide range of <lb/>governments as well as private companies; behavioural economics is not about &quot; irrationality &quot; in the <lb/>pejorative and condescending common meaning. The use of &quot; irrationality &quot; stems from a simplification <lb/>of the field&apos;s experimental findings that distinguish real-world human behaviour from the predictions <lb/>of traditional economic theory. <lb/>Protecting Consumers from Add-On Insurance Products: New Lessons for Insurance <lb/>Regulation from Behavioral Economics -Tom Baker, Peter Siegelman, Connecticut Insurance Law <lb/>Journal, 2013 <lb/>Persistently high profits on &quot; insurance &quot; for small value losses sold as an add-on to other products <lb/>or services (such as extended warranties sold with consumer electronics, or credit life insurance sold <lb/>with a loan) pose a twofold challenge to the standard economic analysis of insurance. First, expected <lb/>utility theory teaches that people should not buy insurance for small value losses. Second, the market <lb/>should not in the long run permit sellers to charge prices that greatly exceed the cost of providing the <lb/></body>

			<page>35 <lb/></page>

			<body>insurance. Combining the insights of the shrouded pricing model with the behavioural economics of <lb/>insurance, this paper explains why high profits for add-on insurance persist and describes the negative <lb/>distributional and welfare consequences of an unregulated market for such insurance. Drawing on <lb/>theoretical, empirical, and comparative law sources, the paper explains why enhanced disclosure will <lb/>not work, the circumstances under which a point of sale ban of offer of add-on insurance is desirable, <lb/>and why a new, on-line market is preferable to price regulation in circumstances in which a point of <lb/>sale ban is undesirable. <lb/>Regulators and policy-making bodies <lb/>MINDSPACE, Influencing behaviour through public policy -Paul Dolan, Dr David Halpern, <lb/>Dominic King, Ivo Vlaev, Michael Hallsworth, UK Cabinet Office/Institute for Government, 2010 <lb/>The reports underlines how new insights from science and behaviour change could lead to <lb/>significantly improved outcomes, and at a lower cost, than the way many conventional policy tools are <lb/>used. It explores how behaviour change theory can help meet current policy challenges, such as how to <lb/>reduce crime, tackle obesity and ensure environmental sustainability. Today&apos;s policy makers are in the <lb/>business of influencing behaviour -they need to understand the effects their policies may be having. <lb/> &quot; MINDSPACE &quot; is a mnemonic which can be used as a quick checklist when making policy, and <lb/>stands for stands for &quot; Messenger, Incentives, Norms, Defaults, Salience, Priming, Affect, <lb/>Commitments, Ego &quot; . The aim of MINDSPACE is to help policy-makers come up with more effective <lb/>measures, and in doing so get better outcomes for the public and society. <lb/>Consumer Policy Toolkit -OECD, 2010 <lb/>This practical guide is designed to aid policymakers in using a systematic approach to identify <lb/>and evaluate consumer problems and to develop, implement and review effective consumer policies so <lb/>that consumer can play their role in ensuring a dynamic economy. <lb/>The report notes that work done in the field of behavioural economics has identified a number of <lb/>important ways that consumer behaviour may deviate from the assumptions underlying the traditional <lb/>market model and has enriched understanding of consumer behaviour in key areas (eg. making choices <lb/>with uncertain outcomes, trade-offs between present decisions and long-term interests). In certain <lb/>areas, such as designing information disclosures or evaluating situations involving default-setting, <lb/>behavioural economics may provide important insights that could improve policy formulation. As <lb/>behavioural economics continues to mature, the report underlines that there may be further <lb/>implications for consumer policy. It is therefore an area that merits continued attention. <lb/>Test, Learn, Adapt: Developing Public Policy with Randomised Controlled Trials -UK Cabinet <lb/>Office Behavioural Insights Team, 2012 <lb/>Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) are the best way of determining whether a policy is <lb/>working. The paper identifies 9 steps that are required to set up any RCT: <lb/>Test <lb/>1. <lb/>Identify two or more policy interventions to compare (e.g. old vs new policy; different <lb/>variations of a policy). <lb/>2. <lb/>Determine the outcome that the policy is intended to influence and how it will be <lb/>measured in the trial. <lb/></body>

			<page>36 <lb/></page>

			<body>3. <lb/>Decide on the randomisation unit: whether to randomise to intervention and control <lb/>groups at the level of individuals, institutions (e.g. schools), or geographical areas (e.g. <lb/>local authorities). <lb/>4. <lb/>Determine how many units (people, institutions, or areas) are required for robust results. <lb/>5. <lb/>Assign each unit to one of the policy interventions, using a robust randomisation <lb/>method. <lb/>6. <lb/>Introduce the policy interventions to the assigned groups. <lb/>Learn <lb/>7. <lb/>Measure the results and determine the impact of the policy interventions. <lb/>Adapt <lb/>8. <lb/>Adapt your policy intervention to reflect your findings. <lb/>9. <lb/>Return to Step 1 to continually improve your understanding of what works. <lb/>Assessing investors&apos; risk tolerance through a questionnaire -Nadia Linciano, Paola Soccorso, <lb/>Consob Italy Discussion paper 4, 2012 <lb/>This paper reviews questionnaires used by investment firms to assess their potential clients&apos; risk <lb/>attitude before proposing an investment product. The objective was to identify major shortcomings, <lb/>based in particular on behavioural insights, and suggest improvements. The study concludes that <lb/>several limitations affect the content of the questionnaires used, in particular with regard to questions <lb/>used to assess customers&apos; investment knowledge and experience; the format used to elicit consumers&apos; <lb/>risk attitude which does not independently assess preferences on the time horizon and investment <lb/>aims; the way questions on risk attitude are worded. <lb/>Applying behavioural economics at the Financial Conduct Authority -Kristine Erta, Stefan Hunt, <lb/>Zanna Iscenko, Will Brambley, Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) Occasional Paper 1, 2013 <lb/>People often make errors when choosing and using financial products, and can suffer <lb/>considerable losses as a result. Using behavioural economics helps understand how these errors arise, <lb/>why they persist, and what can be done to ameliorate them. Market forces left to themselves will often <lb/>not work to reduce these mistakes, so regulation may be needed. <lb/>The paper summarises the main lessons from behavioural economics for retail financial markets: <lb/>how consumers make predictable mistakes when choosing and using financial products, how firms <lb/>respond to these mistakes; and how behavioural biases can lead firms to compete in ways that are not <lb/>in the interests of consumers. It then describes how behavioural economics can, and should, be used in <lb/>the regulation of financial conduct. <lb/>Encouraging consumers to claim redress: evidence from a field trial -Paul Adams, Stefan Hunt, <lb/>FCA Occasional Paper 2, 2013 <lb/>The report describes a research conducted to determine how to encourage consumers to claim <lb/>redress following the mis-selling of financial products. Mis-sold customers needed to answer <lb/>questions raised in the letter to get redress. The firm&apos;s original letter had a very low response rate. <lb/>Different potential improvements to the firm&apos;s letter were tested using an RCT, with a view to increase <lb/>the level of customers&apos; response. The letter was modified with simple amendments, including reducing <lb/>the amount of text, explaining to readers that the claims&apos; process would only take five minutes, putting <lb/></body>

Reminders were also sent. Overall, the rate of responses jumped by over 10%. <lb/>Applying Behavioural Sciences to EU Policy-making -René van Bavel, Benedikt Herrmann, <lb/>Gabriele Esposito, Antonios Proestakis, European Commission, Joint Research Centre Scientific and <lb/>Policy reports, 2013 <lb/>This report is intended as a guide for EU policy-makers wishing to introduce a more refined <lb/>understanding of human behaviour into the policy-making process. It covers specific issues that should <lb/>be taken into account when incorporating behavioural insights into the design, implementation and <lb/>monitoring of policies. This includes: identifying at what stage behavioural science should be applied <lb/>to the policy-making process; defining the role of behaviour in a policy initiative; reviewing the <lb/>available evidence; estimating the value added of a behavioural study; specifying the unit of analysis <lb/>(usually individuals but firms in some cases, or SMEs; and considering time constraints. The paper <lb/>also reviews the various types of behavioural studies that can be conducted to inform the envisaged <lb/>EU policy: experimental study; randomised controlled trial (RCT); survey, or qualitative research. <lb/>Behavioural Economics and Competition Policy -The Netherlands Authority for Consumers and <lb/>Markets (Autoriteit Consument &amp; Markt, ACM), 2013 <lb/>The report explores what behavioural economics can mean for competition policy. It analyses the <lb/>implications of the main behavioural economics findings for the effects of competition on consumer <lb/>welfare and for the explanatory value of the theory underlying competition analysis. The report <lb/>concludes that the findings of behavioural economics do not necessitate a re-evaluation of the <lb/>fundamental basis and benefits of competition policy or the explanatory value of standard economic <lb/>models. The report also discusses the issue of potential pockets of market power in which firms may <lb/>exploit consumer biases. If dynamic learning effects are limited and exploitation of consumer biases <lb/>appears persistent, regulators may decide to intervene. The ACM&apos;s view is that the enforcement of <lb/>consumer protection laws, market scans and effective communication (to help &apos;de-bias&apos; consumers) <lb/>are the best instruments to deal with this issue. <lb/>Financial (Dis-)Information Evidence from an Audit Study in Mexico -Xavier Gine, Cristina <lb/>Martinez Cuellar, Rafe Mazer, World Bank, 2014 <lb/>In Mexico, the World Bank, CGAP and Condusef, the Mexican Consumer Protection Agency, <lb/>trained lower-income consumers to pose as potential customers at financial institutions. Those <lb/> &quot; mystery shoppers &quot; tested financial institutions in 4 towns and found significant gaps between what <lb/>the law requires and what is actually happening on the ground. It showed for example that <lb/>inexperienced consumers receive less product information during the sales process, as banks staff tend <lb/>to treat customers differently based on their perceived financial knowledge. It also evidenced that sales <lb/>staff incentives do not align with consumer needs and budgets: low-cost accounts, which are good for <lb/>customers, are not generally profitable for banks and are not offered. <lb/>Regulatory Policy and Behavioural Economics -Peter Lunne, OECD, 2014 <lb/>Over the last years, behavioural economics has been rapidly propelled from the margins of <lb/>economic analysis towards the policy mainstream. In this context, this study offers an international <lb/>review of the initial applications of behavioural economics to policy, with a particular focus on <lb/>regulatory policy. It describes the extent to which behavioural findings have begun to influence public <lb/>policy in a number of OECD countries, referring to a total of more than 60 instances, the majority of <lb/></body>

			<page>38 <lb/></page>

			<body>which concern regulatory policy. It then considers possible lessons for regulatory design and delivery, <lb/>highlighting in particular that the introduction of a behavioural economics dimension in regulatory <lb/>design will have implications for applied economic analysis and the skill-sets of those working in <lb/>policy development and regulation with the conduct or commission of context-specific empirical <lb/>studies that employ experiments, pilots and RCTs. It also underlines how much the environment in <lb/>which decision makers operate matters. Regulations are just one possible way to alter that <lb/>environment, but where they are effective it may often be less because they prohibit than because they <lb/>assist; good regulations can improve the environment for decision makers. <lb/>Final report of the conference on Emerging challenges in retail finance and consumer policy -<lb/>European Commission, 2014 <lb/>One of the conference&apos;s sessions focused on the ways to make a better use of the insights of <lb/>behavioural economics in policymaking in the area of financial services. Recent EU legislative <lb/>measures have attempted to integrate the psychological dimension of consumers&apos; decision-making <lb/>process (packaged-retail and insurance-based investments products -PRIIPs, Consumer and Mortgage <lb/>Credit Directives), and the European Commission is interested in further learning and exploring how <lb/>best to apply such insights in regulatory work. As part of the discussion, the European Consumer <lb/>Organisation, BEUC, recognised the value of behavourial economics but underlined that more market <lb/>failures which generate consumers&apos; vulnerability have been so far insufficiently addressed by <lb/>policymakers, for example: (artificial) complexity of financial products, tying of products or conflicts <lb/>of interests arising from commissions and remuneration schemes. The Financial Conduct Authority <lb/>highlighted that the UK has developed a model for regulatory analysis which looks at markets in the <lb/>round by exploring the interaction of behavioural market failures, structural competition issues, <lb/>information asymmetries, externalities and regulatory failures. Participants to the conference debated 4 <lb/>preselected topics falling under the scope of behavioural economics: comparability of products, <lb/>vulnerable consumers, providers&apos; reputation and trustworthiness, and misalignment of incentives. <lb/>How does selling insurance as an add-on affect consumer decisions? A practical application of <lb/>behavioural experiments in financial regulation -FCA Occasional Paper 3, 2014 <lb/>This paper described the 1 st FCA behavioural experiment, which studies decision-making in a <lb/>more stylised environment than a field trial, but still captures the main aspects of the decision that is <lb/>being investigated. It formed part of the FCA market study on general insurance products commonly <lb/>sold as add-ons, i.e. general insurance sold alongside other (primary) products either at the same time <lb/>or subsequently, like travel insurance sold alongside a holiday. The study investigated whether there <lb/>were common patterns across add-on markets that weakened competition and drove poor consumer <lb/>outcomes. This involved considering various sales and price format: standalone insurance; add-on <lb/>upfront alongside the primary product; add-on revealed only at point of sale for the primary product. <lb/>This helped identify the effects on the extent and effectiveness of shopping around and on the add-on <lb/>take up. <lb/>Behavioural Economics -Department of Public Expenditure and Reform&apos;s Central Expenditure <lb/>Evaluation Unit, Irish Government Economic and Evaluation Service, 2014 <lb/>This paper examines, in a preliminary way, the potential for the growing body of research and <lb/>innovative ideas emerging in the area of behavioural economics to improve the effectiveness and <lb/>efficiency of policies and of State services and service delivery to the citizen. <lb/>It explains the theoretical and research-based background to behavioural economics and discusses <lb/>some practical applications in the area of public policy making and public service delivery. In doing <lb/></body>

			<page>39 <lb/></page>

			<body>so, it draws on examples of best international practices and makes some recommendations for <lb/>applying these in Ireland. It also highlights existing good practices and initiatives underway in parts of <lb/>the Irish public service. There is scope for behavioural economics across the wide spectrum of public <lb/>policy and state services -health care, education, pensions, back-to-work initiatives, reducing <lb/>reoffending rates, and the collection of taxes, fines and charges. This paper proposes that behavioural <lb/>economics can improve new policy development, enhance the delivery of existing policy and <lb/>interventions, help avoid unintended outcomes and improve productivity. At an operational level, <lb/>behavioural economics has application across public services, including in the area of debt <lb/>management and revenue collection, and at a policy level it can inform policy development in areas <lb/>such as pensions and in health. <lb/>Applying behavioral insights in consumer protection policy -Rafe Mazer, Katharine McKee, <lb/>Alexandra Fiorillo, CGAP, 2014 <lb/>The increased use of behavioural research to develop consumer protection policies is especially <lb/>important in emerging markets and developing economies (EMDEs) due to the nature of both their <lb/>financial markets and many of their financial consumers. The paper explores how behavioural research <lb/>can offer important tools for effective policy-making in four priority consumer protection topics that <lb/>are relevant in virtually all settings, but have specific implications in base-of-the-pyramid settings: <lb/>disclosure, transparency, and product choice; complaints handling and recourse; credit market <lb/>regulation and debt stress; and fair treatment. Each of the four sections reviews emerging evidence and <lb/>experience from behavioural research and offers specific advice for policy and regulation deriving <lb/>from these behavioural insights. The paper closes with reflections on consumer protection-related <lb/>priorities and challenges in EMDEs that would benefit from further applied behavioural research and <lb/>field experimentation. <lb/>Investing in hybrid securities: explanations based on behavioural economics -Australian <lb/>Securities and Investment Commission (ASIC), 2015 <lb/>This report sets out the results of research into how behavioural biases may influence preferences <lb/>towards hybrid securities over the less complex financial products of bonds and shares. It provides <lb/>preliminary insight into the behavioural biases and risk attitudes that influence investment in hybrid <lb/>securities. Findings show that they include the illusion of control that investors can exert over their <lb/>environment; investors&apos; overconfidence on their ability to withdraw from an investment early and <lb/>consequently be protected from risk; a framing bias regarding the formulation of the choice in favour <lb/>of hybrid securities; a preference of known risks over unknown risks; branding of (known) issuers of <lb/>financial products; investors&apos; risk perception and attitudes. The findings are based on a pilot study that <lb/>was commissioned by ASIC due to its concern that some retail investors may struggle to understand <lb/>the complexity of hybrid securities and the risks they pose. <lb/>Improving communication with directors of firms in liquidation -Australian Securities and <lb/>Investment Commission (ASIC), 2015 <lb/>Based on a behavioural economics approach, this report explores how to increase compliance of <lb/>directors of companies in liquidation with their legal obligations to cooperate with a nominated <lb/>liquidator. The research tests, through a laboratory experiment, potentially effective ways through <lb/>changing the form of communication used when requesting company information from directors, and <lb/>offering opportunities to receive legal or accounting assistance. Directors willing to comply but <lb/>lacking business management skills appear to be more likely to react positively to &quot; nudge-like &quot; <lb/>treatments. <lb/></body>

			<body>Stimulating interest: Reminding savers to act when rates decrease -FCA Occasional <lb/>Paper 7, 2015 <lb/>This paper analyses if holders of savings accounts with short-term high interest rates do not <lb/>transfer their money when the rate falls because of behavioural biases, such as undervaluing long-term <lb/>gains relative to short-term costs (present bias) or paying insufficient attention to their savings choices <lb/>(limited attention). The FCA has carried out a trial involving savings account customers whose interest <lb/>rate was about to decrease or had just decreased. All of these customers had already received a letter <lb/>two to three months before the rate decrease informing them of this. This paper investigates the effects <lb/>on switching behaviour of an additional letter, different messages in the reminder and the timing of the <lb/>reminder. <lb/>Two plus two makes five? Survey evidence that investors overvalue structured deposits -FCA <lb/>Occasional Paper 9, 2015 <lb/>The survey investigated how well consumers understand and value structured deposits, a class of <lb/>complex products. The FCA conducted a behavioural experiment involving retail investors who had <lb/>previously bought or would consider buying structured deposits or other structured products. Investors <lb/>significantly and systematically overestimated the return from structured deposits. This overestimation <lb/>led them to prefer structured deposits over alternatives as cash savings. New targeted disclosure could <lb/>improve how consumers make their comparisons and their investment decisions. <lb/>Financial Product Disclosure: Insights from Behavioural Economics -Kirsty Johnston, Christine <lb/>Tether, Ashley Tomlinson, Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment New Zealand, <lb/>Occasional Paper 15/01, 2015 <lb/>The paper reviews research on behavioural economics and identifies the main implications for the <lb/>development of policy for financial product disclosure, with a focus on investment products. The <lb/>conclusion is that disclosures are most effective at aiding investor decision making when they are <lb/>short and simple; standardised; clear about risks and benefits; meaningful; well presented; and tested <lb/>on investors. The reports also highlights that it is important that key behavioural insights are seen in <lb/>the broader context of what a disclosure regime seeks to achieve (for example, a short and succinct <lb/>document is not an end in itself if it fails to convey the necessary information), in order to effectively <lb/>aid investors&apos; understanding and decision making. <lb/>Message received? The impact of annual summaries, text alerts and mobile apps on consumer <lb/>banking behaviour -FCA Occasional paper 10, 2015 <lb/>In the context of a potential Competition and Markets Authority investigation into personal <lb/>current accounts, the FCA wanted to understand the impact of previous initiatives that were intended <lb/>to help consumers manage their current account. The experience showed that annual summaries have <lb/>no effect on consumer behaviour in terms of incurring overdraft charges, altering balance levels or <lb/>switching to other current account providers. In contrast, signing up to text alerts or mobile banking <lb/>apps reduces the amount of unarranged overdraft charges incurred, and signing up to both services has <lb/>an additional effect. The additional impact of the combination of both services shows the benefit of <lb/>receiving information upon automatic triggers, without having to actively acquire it, as well as having <lb/>the facility to act quickly upon receiving information. Text alerts and mobile banking apps also reduce <lb/>current account balances, which is beneficial for consumers as they reduce the cost of holding funds in <lb/>accounts with low credit interest rates. This research reinforces the importance of testing disclosures <lb/>beforehand to help ensure that they effectively achieve their intended outcomes. The paper discusses <lb/></body>

			<body>wider implications for the role of regulation, how to design effective disclosure rules, and incentives <lb/>for innovation. <lb/>Newspaper articles and blog posts <lb/>Economics Behaving Badly -George Loewenstein and Peter Ubel, New York Times, 14 July 2010 <lb/>The article argues that behavioural economics is being asked to solve problems it was not meant <lb/>to address and that in some cases, it is being used as a political expedient, allowing policymakers to <lb/>avoid more effective solutions rooted in traditional economics. Behavioural economics should <lb/>complement, not substitute for, more substantive economic interventions. <lb/>Pire que l&apos;autre, la nouvelle science économique -Laura Raim, Le Monde Diplomatique, juillet <lb/>2013 <lb/>Behavioural economics explores consumers&apos; decision-making process in order to help them <lb/> &quot; follow the right path &quot; , through subtle incentives or nudges. But behavourial economics is also used <lb/>by firms especially in the financial sector (eg. asset management funds), as a way to influence <lb/>employees and clients&apos; reactions to the firms&apos; benefit. The article presents nudges as a midway <lb/>solution between markets &quot; laisser-faire &quot; and public regulation. They would facilitate choices made in <lb/>the general interest, without defining what this &quot; general interest &quot; is or should be. The article also <lb/>points at the problematic connections between the economic and the political spheres. It expresses <lb/>some doubts about the practical results of behavioural economics research and concludes that this <lb/>approach fails to solve the market inefficiency problems. <lb/></body>
