			<body>Abstract/Résumé <lb/>Making Economic Growth more Socially Inclusive in Germany <lb/>While past labour market reforms have been successful in terms of employment, the relative poverty risk <lb/>and income inequality have remained broadly unchanged in recent years. Some social groups remain <lb/>particularly vulnerable, including individuals in non-regular employment, the unemployed and the low <lb/>skilled. If in employment, their jobs tend to be unstable and wages and income mobility low. Continued <lb/>efforts are needed to foster economic growth in a more inclusive manner, such that the most vulnerable <lb/>groups benefit from and contribute to economic growth more strongly and such that the gaps between the <lb/>rich and the poor in terms of income and wellbeing are reduced. These efforts should include enhancing <lb/>the labour market outcomes of the most vulnerable and increase upward income mobility among <lb/>disadvantaged individuals; strengthening skills at the lower end of the skills distribution; revising the tax <lb/>and benefit system to improve incentives and to ensure efficient and well-targeted redistribution; and to <lb/>make health and old-age pension insurance more inclusive. This working paper relates to the 2014 OECD <lb/>Economic Survey of Germany (http://www.oecd.org/eco/surveys/economic-survey-germany.htm). <lb/>JEL Classification: I24, I32, O52 <lb/>Key words: Germany, inclusive growth, income inequality, labour markets, education, health, old age <lb/>poverty, taxation. <lb/>********** <lb/>Rendre la croissance économique plus inclusive en Allemagne <lb/>Alors que les réformes du marché du travail opérées dans le passé ont été bénéfiques en termes d&apos;emploi, <lb/>le risque de pauvreté relative et les inégalités de revenus n&apos;ont quasiment pas changé ces dernières années. <lb/>Certains groupes sociaux restent particulièrement vulnérables, notamment les personnes ayant un emploi <lb/>précaire, les chômeurs et les personnes peu qualifiées. Lorsque les personnes concernées ont un travail, il <lb/>s&apos;agit généralement d&apos;emplois peu stables, et les salaires sont bas et la mobilité salariale faible. Il est <lb/>nécessaire de poursuivre les efforts, pour faire en sorte que les groupes les plus vulnérables puissent <lb/>bénéficier d&apos;une croissance économique plus vigoureuse et y contribuer, pour accroître la mobilité à la <lb/>hausse des revenus parmi les personnes défavorisées et pour atténuer les inégalités. L&apos;accent devrait être <lb/>mis sur les instruments de l&apos;action publique permettant à la fois de réduire les inégalités de revenus et de <lb/>doper la croissance du PIB. Il s&apos;agit notamment d&apos;améliorer le devenir professionnel des plus vulnérables; <lb/>de renforcer les compétences au bas de l&apos;échelle de distribution des compétences; de réviser le système de <lb/>prélèvements et de prestations pour améliorer les incitations; et assurer une redistribution efficiente et bien <lb/>ciblée; et rendre l&apos;assurance santé et l&apos;assurance retraite plus inclusives. Ce document de travail se rapporte <lb/>à l&apos;Étude économique de l&apos;OCDE de l&apos;Allemagne 2014 (http://www.oecd.org/fr/eco/etudes/etude-<lb/>economique-allemagne.htm). <lb/>Mots-clés : I24, I32, O52 <lb/>Classification JEL : Allemagne, croissance inclusive, marché du travail, enseignement, santé, pauvreté des <lb/>personnes âgées, imposition. <lb/>ECO/WKP(2014)71 <lb/></body>

GDP growth has benefited households with high incomes more than those with <lb/>low incomes since the mid-1990s. The ratio of the top 10% to bottom 10% of disposable incomes has <lb/>increased more than in many other OECD economies, especially before 2005. Relative poverty increased <lb/>particularly in East Germany, affecting 20% in 2009, which is almost twice as much as in the West. While <lb/>real disposable household income inequality in East and West Germany did not converge much in the early <lb/>2000s, some convergence has occurred since 2005 (Grabka et al., 2012). <lb/>Figure 1.

			<body>2. <lb/>Thanks to the robust labour market, and in stark contrast to many other European countries, <lb/>German household income has increased since 2007, benefitting incomes at both ends of the scale (OECD, <lb/>2012 and 2013a). Nevertheless, despite sustained employment growth and a significant drop in <lb/>unemployment, largely brought about by far-reaching labour market reforms in the mid-2000s (OECD, <lb/>2012a), income inequality has not declined markedly over this period, either in absolute terms or relative to <lb/>developments in OECD countries on average. The risk of relative poverty has, if anything, increased <lb/>(OECD, 2013a). Kierzenkowski and Koske (2012) have identified a number of determinants of income <lb/>inequality, some of them being particularly relevant for Germany (Box 1). <lb/>Box 1. Determinants of rising income inequality and risk of relative poverty <lb/>Skill-biased technological change: In many OECD countries, labour markets have become polarised, with <lb/>computer technology depressing the middle of the wage and employment distributions where workers perform skilled <lb/>but routine tasks, which leads to an increase in income inequality at the top end and a decrease at the low end. This <lb/>pattern also appears in Germany (Dustmann et al., 2009; Spitz-Oener, 2006). <lb/>Education: Wage inequality is negatively correlated with the average level of educational attainment. In Germany <lb/>returns to education have been broadly stable over time (Prasad, 2004; OECD, 2013d). Higher educational attainment <lb/>is also positively correlated with well-being, in part because of more rewarding jobs. <lb/>International trade: Globalisation seems to have important implications for at least some groups of workers. In <lb/>particular, offshoring appears to reduce employment and wages of medium-skilled workers performing routine tasks, <lb/>thus reinforcing labour-market polarization. <lb/>Immigration: Immigration has a small impact on native workers and sizeable adverse wage or employment <lb/>effects on the cohorts of previous immigrants are found for Germany, implying only small effects for overall labour <lb/>income inequality (D&apos;Amuri et al., 2010; Steinhardt, 2011). <lb/>Labour market regulation: It has been relaxed over the past 20 to 25 years in many OECD countries. The impact <lb/>of declining unionisation and of the lower relative minimum wage, observed in many countries, is most pronounced at <lb/>the lower end of the wage distribution. However, many such institutions (e.g. employment protection legislation, <lb/>minimum wage) have opposite effects on employment and wage dispersion leaving the final impact on inequality <lb/>undetermined (OECD, 2011). For Germany, there is little evidence that the labour market reforms in the mid-2000s <lb/>have raised inequality. <lb/>Household structure: Changes in the household structure, driven by a tendency towards more single households, <lb/>are an important trigger for poverty at the microeconomic level (OECD, 2008a). Among others, the labour market <lb/>reforms in the mid-2000s have generated incentives for subsistence payment beneficiaries to form single-households <lb/>(Peichl et al., 2010). The formation of smaller households due to separation is likely to affect spouses with low <lb/>earnings and their children most. <lb/>Inequality is marked in market incomes, wealth and well-being indicators <lb/>3. <lb/>Inequality in market incomes is higher than in many other OECD economies (Figure 2). The <lb/>long-term increase in inequality of market incomes has been driven by rising disparities in labour incomes, <lb/>and a particularly uneven distribution of self-employment incomes (OECD, 2012b). However, taxes and <lb/>cash transfers play a larger role in mitigating market income inequality and risk of relative poverty than in <lb/>most other countries. According to most recent data, the German tax-benefit system reduces inequality <lb/>among the working-age population by almost 30%. <lb/></body>

			<body>Figure 2. Effect of net taxes and transfers on income¹ inequality² <lb/>Gini coefficient, 2010³ <lb/>1. <lb/>Income refers to cash income excluding imputed components such as home production and imputed rents regularly received <lb/>over the year. Market income (i.e. before taxes and transfers) includes earnings (broken down into those of the household head, <lb/>of the spouse and of other household members); self-employment income; and capital income (rents, dividends and interest). <lb/>2. <lb/>Income inequality is measured as Gini coefficient for equivalised household market income and disposable income for the total <lb/>population. It ranges from zero (perfect equality) to one (where one individual receives all). <lb/>3. <lb/>2011 for Chile; 2009 for Ireland, Japan, Switzerland and New Zealand. Market income Gini coefficient is not available for <lb/>Hungary, Mexico and Turkey. The OECD average is calculated as a population-weighted average of 26 countries available for <lb/>2010. <lb/>Source: OECD Income Distribution and Poverty database. <lb/>4. <lb/>Besides income inequality at any given point in time, the likelihood of an individual to move up <lb/>or down the income distribution (income mobility, often measured in moves across quintiles) also matters <lb/>for life-time inequality. Workless and low-income households suffer particularly from low upward income <lb/>mobility as it raises the likelihood of long-lasting or repeated spells of poverty (OECD, 2008a) and <lb/>prevents them from benefiting from and contributing to more economic growth. It is therefore worrisome <lb/>that equivalised disposable income mobility has declined particularly for low income households since the <lb/>late 1990s (German Council of Economic Experts, 2011 and 2013), with income mobility being especially <lb/>low in East Germany. Wage mobility also steadily declined between 1976 and 2008 (Aretz, 2013), raising <lb/>the risk of relative poverty for workers in the low wage sector. Changes in job stability and employment <lb/>characteristics, including unemployment history, tenure and type of industry, explain a significant share of <lb/>this decline (Riphahn and Schnitzlein, 2011). <lb/>5. <lb/>In-kind benefits paid for by governments, notably health and education services have an <lb/>important redistributive effect, but they are not reflected in the monetary measures of income inequality <lb/>and risk of relative poverty. Although government spending on in-kind benefits is comparatively high as a <lb/>share of GDP, its redistributive effect is estimated to be relatively small, which may suggest poor targeting <lb/>(OECD, 2011; Verbist et al., 2012; Adema et al., 2011). <lb/>Wealth is less evenly distributed than income and has become more uneven (German Council of <lb/>Economic Experts, 2009). It is also less evenly distributed across households than in other European <lb/>economies (Figure 3). At 37%, the share of households without any property or wealth is comparatively <lb/>large. The 10% wealthiest households earn 31% of gross incomes and own 59% of net wealth (Deutsche <lb/>Bundesbank, 2013). <lb/></body>

Distribution of household net wealth¹ <lb/>Ratio of top to bottom quintile, 2009² <lb/>1. <lb/>Net wealth is the difference between total household assets and total household liabilities. <lb/>2. <lb/>2010 for Italy; 2007 for Spain. <lb/>Source: European Central Bank (2013), &quot;The Eurosystem Household Finance and Consumption Survey -Statistical Tables&quot;, April. <lb/>6. <lb/>A relatively large number of small households in Germany may account to some extent for the <lb/>larger share of households with low wealth. Home ownership, which is the most important component of <lb/>household net wealth, is highly concentrated among the wealthiest (Deutsche Bundesbank, 2013; Andrews <lb/>and Caldera Sánchez, 2011). The tax regime may have encouraged wealthy households to invest in <lb/>residential real estate (see below). The divergence of wealth between East and West Germany also <lb/>contributes to the uneven distribution of wealth (Frick and Grabka, 2009). <lb/>7. <lb/>According to the OECD well-being framework, which encompasses eleven domains covering <lb/>both material and non-material living conditions, German households enjoy a relatively high level of <lb/>economic welfare and perform well in most domains (OECD, 2013g). However, well-being outcomes for <lb/>individuals with high income/high education are considerably better than for individuals with low <lb/>income/low education in several domains. For instance, individuals with high income report a considerably <lb/>better health status than individuals with low income. The strong impact of socio-economic background on <lb/>education attainment also points towards inequalities in well-being outcomes (Figure 4). Moreover, 25% of <lb/>individuals live in households where the total housing costs – net of housing allowances – represent 40% <lb/>or more of their disposable income (10% OECD wide; OECD, 2013g). <lb/>Identifying the most vulnerable to risks of poverty <lb/>8. <lb/>Some social groups – including low skilled, individuals in non-regular employment and <lb/>unemployed – are particularly vulnerable. They face a high risk of relative poverty and, if in employment, <lb/>their jobs tend to be unstable, their wages low and their income mobility subdued. <lb/>ECO/WKP(2014)71 <lb/></body>

			<body>The low wage sector is large and includes many low skill workers <lb/>9. <lb/>Low-wage employment increased between 2006 and 2010 and is particularly widespread among <lb/>low skilled workers and women (Figure 5). While the share of low skilled individuals in the population is <lb/>low, a relatively large share of low wage earners has low skills. This suggests that job matching is <lb/>effective, but also that better targeted efforts to improve skills could considerably improve the income <lb/>prospects of these workers. The large share of women in the low wage sector partly reflects the large gap <lb/>between men and women in hourly wages. This may partly be due to more frequent and extended <lb/>interruptions in working careers, a larger share of women who work part-time and differences in <lb/>occupation (OECD, 2012h). The gender gap in full-time earnings is one of the largest among OECD <lb/>countries. This is also true for the bottom quintile of full-time earners (OECD, 2013f). <lb/>Figure 5. Low-wage earners¹ by educational attainment level², employment contract and gender <lb/>As a percentage of employees³, 2010 <lb/>1. <lb/>Low-wage earners are defined as those employees earning less than two thirds of the median gross hourly earnings. <lb/>2. <lb/>Low skilled, medium skilled and high skilled are defined respectively as educational attainments of below upper secondary <lb/>(ISCED 0-2), upper and post-secondary (ISCED 3-4) and tertiary (ISCED 5-6). <lb/>3. <lb/>All employees excluding apprentices working in enterprises with more than 10 employees and which operate in all sectors of the <lb/>economy except agriculture, forestry and fishing (NACE Rev. 2 section A); and public administration, defence and compulsory <lb/>social security (NACE Rev. 2 section O). <lb/>Source: Eurostat. <lb/>Workers in non-regular employment are exposed to high poverty risks <lb/>10. <lb/>While past labour market reforms have put more workers into jobs, poverty risks are high for <lb/>workers in non-regular employment (defined here as employees with relatively low employment protection <lb/>or limited access to unemployment insurance), as well as many part-time and self-employed workers, <lb/>especially those without employees (Table 1). As in other OECD countries, such workers are often paid <lb/>low wages, suffer from low wage mobility and are less well protected than workers on permanent contracts <lb/>(OECD, 2012a). <lb/>ECO/WKP(2014)71 <lb/></body>

The risk of relative poverty is assessed on the basis of <lb/>the mean equivalised disposable household income, at the 60% threshold. Non-regular employment consists here of temporary <lb/>employees, workers in marginal employment (minijobs) and temporary agency workers. Overlaps among the different forms of non-<lb/>regular employment and part-time employment exist. <lb/>Source: Federal Statistical Office of Germany. <lb/>11. <lb/>Part-time work is particularly widespread among women: only 62% of employed women work <lb/>full-time compared to 74% OECD-wide in 2012. Part-time work is characterised by a high risk of relative <lb/>poverty. Also, their prospects of moving to full-time, permanent employment are often limited. They often <lb/>face unstable employment, they tend to receive less in-work training and have poor chances to move up the <lb/>income ladder. A considerable number of vulnerable part-timers is in marginal employment (minijobs, see <lb/>Box 3 below). These vulnerabilities are attenuated to some extent at the household level, as many part-time <lb/>workers are secondary earners. Nonetheless, even for secondary earners in high-income households part-<lb/>time employment may entail the risk of falling into relative poverty in the future, for example in the case of <lb/>changes in the household, possibly as a result of separation. <lb/>12. <lb/>The number of workers in employment receiving top-up subsistence benefits increased to 3% of <lb/>total employment in 2011. Most are in marginal employment and 18% are single parents (Bruckmeier <lb/>et al., 2013). Some 44% of individuals receiving subsistence payments who find a job continue to depend <lb/>on top-up benefits and 45% are in employment for 6 months or less, which may reduce their income <lb/>mobility (Koller and Rudolph, 2011). <lb/>The unemployed face a very high risk of relative poverty <lb/>13. <lb/>Many workers in non-regular employment acquire little or no unemployment insurance benefit <lb/>entitlements, but face a high risk of unemployment. Lack of employment is particularly widespread among <lb/>single parent households, which represent 5.9% of total households. Sixty-five per cent of single parents <lb/>were in employment in 2008, less than in most other OECD countries, and labour market participation is <lb/>particularly low for mothers with children aged 4 or less (Federal Ministry of Finance, 2012). Also <lb/>individuals approaching retirement age are characterized by low employment and a high risk of relative <lb/>poverty. <lb/>14. <lb/>While long-term unemployment has decreased sharply in recent years, it continues to account for <lb/>more than 40% of total unemployment. The long-term unemployed are particularly vulnerable to poverty <lb/>risks, because longer unemployment spells reduce employability and workers lose their unemployment <lb/>ECO/WKP(2014)71 <lb/></body>

			<body>insurance benefit entitlement. Low skilled workers are more likely to face long-term unemployment <lb/>(Figure 6). Also older works face a high risk of long-term unemployment which, unlike for youth and <lb/>prime-age individuals, is close to the EU average. The high incidence of long-term unemployment among <lb/>older workers, including those with medium vocational qualifications, suggests that older workers with a <lb/>narrow set of skills have difficulties to adapt to structural changes in the economy that may occur during <lb/>their working life. <lb/>Figure 6.

Moreover, the incidence of <lb/>long-term unemployment is high, also in international comparison (OECD, 2012f). The high share of the <lb/>low skilled among immigrants reduces their wages and employability (Koske et al., 2012). To some extent <lb/>this is also true among second generation immigrants indicating the need to make integration policies more <lb/>effective. <lb/>Structural reforms to promote inclusive growth <lb/>16. <lb/>Continued efforts are needed to foster economic growth in a more inclusive manner, such that the <lb/>most vulnerable groups benefit from and contribute to economic growth more strongly and such that the <lb/>gaps between the rich and the poor in terms of income and wellbeing are reduced. As discussed below, <lb/>more inclusive growth requires enhancing the labour market outcomes of the most vulnerable and <lb/>improving skills at the lower end of the skills distribution, as well as reforms of the tax and benefit system <lb/>to ensure efficient and well-targeted redistribution. The focus should be on policy instruments which entail <lb/>a double dividend by reducing income inequality and boosting GDP growth at the same time. Going for <lb/>Growth 2012 has benchmarked a number of policy instruments against these two objectives (Box 2; <lb/>OECD, 2012g). <lb/></body>

			<body>Box 2. Policy instruments and their impact on inequality and economic growth <lb/>General policy trade-offs and complementarities between growth and income distribution objectives as identified <lb/>in Going for Growth 2012 are summarized in Table 2. <lb/> Policies which reduce income inequality and at the same time boost long-run GDP per capita include <lb/>instruments to raise human capital while making it less dependent on personal and social circumstances, <lb/>reducing labour market duality, promoting the integration of immigrants and fostering female labour market <lb/>participation. Some tax policies, notably to reduce tax expenditures, contributes to equity objectives while <lb/>also allowing a growth-friendly cut in effective marginal tax rates, in particular for lower income recipients. <lb/> Several policies may entail a trade-off between reducing income inequality and raising GDP per capita. For <lb/>instance, administrative extensions of collective wage agreements may reduce wage earnings dispersion <lb/>among workers, but they may harm competition and productivity and possibly reduce employment. Shifting <lb/>the tax mix to less-distorting taxes -in particular away from labour and corporate income taxes towards <lb/>consumption, proper pricing of environmental externalities and real estate taxes -would improve incentives <lb/>to work, save and invest, but may require additional steps to address adverse implications for equity. <lb/>Table 2.

Three reform <lb/>areas deserve particular attention: avoiding low employment and low pay traps, avoiding a dual labour <lb/>market and strengthening active labour market policies (ALMP). <lb/>Removing barriers to full-time employment would reduce poverty risks <lb/>18. <lb/>Policies that discourage full-time employment should be carefully reviewed as they tend to <lb/>reduce upwards income mobility of vulnerable individuals and growth. This section argues that the high <lb/>incidence of part-time employment is favoured by the tax treatment of marginal employment and the <lb/>ECO/WKP(2014)71 <lb/></body>

			<body>limited supply of full-time childcare facilities, which also makes it difficult for families with children to <lb/>fully participate in economic activity. <lb/>Avoiding low employment and low pay traps <lb/>19. <lb/>Marginal employment (so-called minijobs) refers to low income employment contracts of up to <lb/>EUR 450 per month, which benefit from tax subsidies, are partially exempt from the mandatory public <lb/>pension system and fully exempt from unemployment insurance (Box 3). minijobs were intended as a <lb/>stepping stone towards permanent full-time employment relationships but a success has not been proven. <lb/>Reduced income tax and social security rates are phased out between EUR 450 and EUR 850 via so-called <lb/>midijobs, thereby implying high marginal tax rates for individuals willing to work more (Freier and <lb/>Steiner, 2007; Körner et al., 2013; Fertig and Kluve, 2007). Workers in minijobs tend to suffer from low <lb/>in-work training opportunities and low wage mobility, locking them into their marginal employment status <lb/>(Voss and Weinkopf, 2012). Some workers on minijobs are exposed to a rising risk of relative poverty <lb/>once they retire or in case of losing their job (Hohendanner and Stegmaier, 2012) because they acquire low <lb/>pension entitlements and are not entitled to unemployment insurance benefits. As the tax subsidy is not <lb/>targeted to low income individuals, many minijobs are taken up by second earners to avoid high taxation in <lb/>the context of the joint income taxation of couples. Minijobs also create an additional tax advantage for <lb/>workers with more than one job, one of them being marginal employment, as income from other jobs does <lb/>not count towards the minijob income ceiling. The number of individuals using marginal employment as <lb/>side job has almost doubled since 2004 and accounted for 34% of all individuals with a minijob in 2011 <lb/>(Hohendanner and Stegmaier, 2012). Minijobs should be better targeted towards low-wage workers. For <lb/>example, tax subsidies should not be provided for combining jobs, one of them being a minijob. <lb/>Box 3. Minijobs -characteristics and incidence <lb/>Minijobs refer to employment contracts for earnings of currently up to EUR 450 per month with reduced income <lb/>tax and social security contribution rates and entitlements. Mandatory social security contribution rates amount to <lb/>roughly 29%, compared to 39% or more for permanent full-time employment. Unlike the case of permanent full-time <lb/>employment, compulsory social security contributions are fully paid by employers. Since 2013 individuals can opt out <lb/>of full pension coverage by not paying the employees&apos; pension contribution rate of 3.9%, on top of the employer&apos;s <lb/>mandatory contribution of 15%. In practice, this option leaves a considerably share of individuals in marginal <lb/>employment with limited entitlement once they retire. Workers in marginal employment do not contribute to <lb/>unemployment insurance and are not entitled to unemployment insurance benefits. They are subject to income tax at a <lb/>flat-rate of 2%. Many individuals in marginal employment, about 5.5 million in total, are students, pensioners or second <lb/>earners (Table 3). <lb/>Table 3.

(2013). <lb/>Midijobs, referring to earnings between EUR 450 and EUR 850, are subject to reduced social insurance contributions as well, but with <lb/>rates increasing gradually to the standard rates. There were 1.37 million midijobs in 2011. <lb/></body>

			<body>Further expansion of childcare to facilitate full-time employment <lb/>20. <lb/>Sufficient and affordable formal childcare facilitates the labour market integration of single <lb/>parents and improves earnings prospects, especially for low income households (Rainer et al., 2011; Rainer <lb/>et al., 2013). A lack of childcare facilities is of particular concern for single parents as they and their <lb/>children are subject to high poverty risks in Germany (Zabel, 2011). Formal childcare also favours other <lb/>family policy goals, such as increasing fertility and improving work-life balance. <lb/>Figure 7. Public expenditure on childcare and early education services <lb/>As a percentage of GDP, 2009 <lb/>Note: Aggregate spending for Spain. <lb/>Source: OECD Family database. <lb/>21. <lb/>Germany is making progress in expanding childcare and has guaranteed access for all parents, if <lb/>only for a few hours per day. However, enrolment rates in early childcare (one-to-two-year-olds) remain <lb/>low and access to full-time care is limited. One reason is comparatively low total public spending on <lb/>childcare and early education (see Figure 7), although it has increased in recent years. Since August 2013 <lb/>parents have a legal claim to public care for children aged one year or more. In practice, however, several <lb/>conditions may prevent parents from enforcing this right. For instance they cannot reject offered places, <lb/>even if they imply longer commuting distance. Moreover, the availability of full-time care remains limited, <lb/>also for pupils more than 5 years old (Blossfeld et al., 2013; OECD, 2014). Efforts should continue to <lb/>expand early childcare, notably full-time care and all-day school provision. <lb/>22. <lb/>Attendance at formal childcare is particularly low among children from low income households <lb/>or with a migrant background (Spieß et al., 2008; Blossfeld et al., 2013; Authoring Group Educational <lb/>Reporting, 2013). While 33% of children without migration background attend childcare at the age of zero <lb/>to 3 years, only 16% of children with migration background do so (Federal Statistical Office, 2012). These <lb/>households are often less informed about the benefits of formal childcare and may particularly be <lb/>discouraged by high fees. However early childcare and childhood education is an important determinant of <lb/>learning outcomes later on (Heckman and Masterov, 2007). The most seriously disadvantaged children <lb/>reap particularly large cognitive and non-cognitive skill gains (Heckman and Raut, 2013). Children with <lb/>migrant background also benefit by acquiring language through education (OECD, 2008a). Further efforts <lb/>and resources are needed to raise the participation of children with weak socio-economic background in <lb/>early childcare and early childhood education. Fees are set by municipalities and thus vary considerably <lb/>across regions (Gathmann and Sass, 2012). Equal access to affordable high-quality childcare should be <lb/>ensured independently of place of residence and socio-economic background. <lb/></body>

			<body>Avoiding a dual labour market <lb/>23. <lb/>The gap between employment protection of permanent workers with long seniority and <lb/>temporary workers is large in Germany (Figure 8). One reason is that Germany is the OECD country with <lb/>the most far-reaching employment protection legislation for workers with open-ended contracts. A reform <lb/>in 2011 tightened regulation of temporary agency workers and the 2013 coalition agreement spelled out <lb/>plans to go somewhat further in this direction by requiring equal pay between in-house workers and <lb/>temporary agency workers with equal tasks after 9 months. In contrast, the use of fixed-term contracts has <lb/>been eased substantially since the late 1990s and regulation of temporary contracts is now among the least <lb/>restrictive among OECD countries (Eichhorst and Tobsch, 2013). For example, it is under certain <lb/>conditions possible to use multiple successive fixed-term contracts with the same employee (European <lb/>Court of Justice, 2012), generating incentives to substitute regular work contracts with fixed-term <lb/>contracts. <lb/>Figure 8. Protection of temporary and regular workers <lb/>Scale 0 (least restrictions) to 6 (most restrictions), 2013 <lb/>1. <lb/>Aggregate contributions of employment protection for regular workers against individual dismissals and additional cost of <lb/>collective dismissals. <lb/>Source: OECD (2013), Employment Outlook. <lb/>24. <lb/>Permanent employment has contributed strongly to employment growth in Germany in recent <lb/>years. Thirty nine per cent of workers on temporary contracts moved to a permanent contract within one <lb/>year (Walwei, 2013). However, international evidence shows that a large gap in employment protection <lb/>between permanent and temporary workers often tends to thwart employability (de Serres et al., 2012), <lb/>increases inequality (Box 1) and hampers the transition from non-regular employment to permanent full-<lb/>time employment. It thereby also lowers wage mobility (Riphahn and Schnitzlein, 2011; Koske et al., <lb/>2012). Against this backdrop, the gap in employment protection between permanent and temporary <lb/>workers should be reduced to further improve the transition of workers in temporary employment <lb/>relationships into permanent jobs. The strict regulation of regular employment should be reviewed along <lb/></body>

			<note place="headnote">ECO/WKP(2014)71 <lb/></note>

			<page>18 <lb/></page>

			<body>the lines suggested in the 2012 Economic Survey of Germany. Simultaneously the regulation of fixed term <lb/>contracts should be reviewed as well. In particular, the use of multiple successive fixed term contracts with <lb/>the same employee should be limited in scope. <lb/>A minimum wage consistent with preserving employment <lb/>25. <lb/>A minimum wage may be an effective instrument to reduce the dispersion of wages while <lb/>preserving employment prospects (Garloff, 2010; Card and Krueger, 1995). It may also limit the need for <lb/>benefit top-ups the government pays to low-wage recipients. Negative employment effects are less likely to <lb/>occur when employers&apos; bargaining power is high and workers&apos; bargaining power is low (Koske et al., <lb/>2012). In such cases there is potential for redistribution of rents without reducing employment. For <lb/>example, low wealth and low income (especially in the absence of unemployment benefit entitlement) can <lb/>push job searchers to accept jobs paying below the marginal product in order to avoid the costs of <lb/>continuing searching. Search models show that a minimum wage may even generate positive employment <lb/>effects, as a minimum wage raises incentives for individuals to work and improve their skills (Acemoglu <lb/>and Pischke, 2001; OECD, 2008b). The experience of the United Kingdom, which implemented a fairly <lb/>low minimum wage relative to the median wage in 1999, but subsequently increased it substantially in <lb/>several steps, shows that employment has not fallen due to the introduction of a nationwide minimum wage <lb/>(OECD, 2004), and was also not affected by the increase in minimum wage during the recent economic <lb/>and financial crisis (Bryan et al., 2012). <lb/>26. <lb/>Currently, a minimum wage can be set for individual sectors, which has been done in several <lb/>cases in Germany, mostly on the basis of extending collectively bargained wages. Two procedures exist to <lb/>set a sector specific minimum wage (see Box 4). The extension of collective wage agreements incurs the <lb/>risk of harming employment prospects of &quot; outsiders &quot; . For instance, legal extension of sectoral wage <lb/>agreements can reduce incentives of social partners to set wages low enough for unemployed to have a <lb/>reasonable chance of finding a job, as no employer can compete by reducing costs with a lower wage. <lb/>Box 4. Procedures to set sector specific minimum wages <lb/>There are two main procedures to implement a sector-specific minimum wage. <lb/>If (1) a minimum of 50% of employees are covered by collective agreements and (2) there is a public interest, a <lb/>collective agreement can be declared as generally binding for all employees in the region and sector. To introduce <lb/>such a sectoral and regional minimum wage, employers&apos; associations and trade unions of the sector have to file a joint <lb/>application for legal extension with the Federal Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs, specifying the agreed minimum <lb/>wage. Once accepted by the Federal Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs, the agreement is binding for all employees <lb/>and employers in the sector. If the government of a Land contests a proposal for legal extension, consent by the <lb/>federal government is needed. <lb/>If less than 50% of all employees in a sector are employed by employers who are bound by collective <lb/>agreements a permanent council can propose a sectoral minimum wage. The permanent council consists of two <lb/>representatives of employers of the sectors concerned, two representatives of labour unions of the sectors concerned <lb/>and three representatives from the Federal Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs. Alternatively, an expert commission, <lb/>composed of three representatives of employers and three from labour unions, and, optionally, experts without voting <lb/>rights, can propose a minimum wage, which can be introduced by the federal government. <lb/>Sectoral minimum wages are in place in several branches and occupations: construction and related crafts, <lb/>(safety services, cleaning services, long-term care, vocational education and further training services and waste <lb/>management). A minimum wage also exists for temporary agency workers. Sectoral minimum wages in Germany <lb/>varied between EUR 7.50 per hour and EUR 13.70 per hour in 2013. Many of these minimum wages vary across <lb/>regions. <lb/></body>

			<page>19 <lb/></page>

			<body>Raising wages via the legal extension of collective wage agreements may also be a way for incumbents to <lb/>prevent the entry of firms and thereby thwart competition and employment. Moreover, sectoral minimum <lb/>wages can be circumvented by outsourcing activity to firms in other sectors or to the self-employed, which <lb/>are then more likely to generate precarious job conditions. These substitution efforts will reduce in-house <lb/>training activities and further contribute to the risks of a dual labour market (OECD, 2008a, 2006 and <lb/>2012g). An extensive evaluation study commissioned by the German Ministry of Labour in 2011 covering <lb/>all sectors with minimum wages failed to find any substantial negative effects on employment and market <lb/>entry in the sectors concerned. However, employment losses may have resulted due to indirect effects on <lb/>other sectors (van Suntum, 2014). <lb/>27. <lb/>The government plans to phase in a general minimum wage of EUR 8.50 between 2015 and the <lb/>end of 2016 and to create a commission to propose future adjustments of the general minimum wage. The <lb/>members of the commission will be nominated by social partners, with the possibility to consult <lb/>independent experts, who will have no voting power. Sectoral minimum wages above the general <lb/>minimum wage will continue to apply and the government plans to make it easier to legally extend <lb/>collectively bargained sectoral minimum wages above the general minimum wage. At present, several of <lb/>these sectoral minimum wages are higher than EUR 8.50. <lb/>28. <lb/>The government&apos;s plans to introduce a general minimum wage are welcome. However it should <lb/>be ensured that the initial level does not entail considerable negative employment effects. A minimum <lb/>wage of EUR 8.50 would amount to about half of the median wage, placing the German minimum wage at <lb/>a level similar to those of other European countries, such as Belgium and the Netherlands, but below <lb/>France. It would affect about 15% of employees nation-wide and more than 23% in Eastern Germany. It <lb/>may harm the employment prospects of workers in some regions and with little experience or low skills <lb/>(Brenke, 2014). A useful strategy would be to introduce the minimum wage at a lower level and make <lb/>adjustments in the light of its impact, as was done in the United Kingdom. The mandate of the expert <lb/>commission should be to set the minimum wage at a level which balances potential employment losses <lb/>against the social benefits. The social partners alone may not sufficiently take the interests of the <lb/>unemployed into account. It could therefore be desirable to involve independent experts or government <lb/>representatives in the commission&apos;s decisions. Moreover, given the introduction of the nationwide <lb/>minimum wage, cautious use should be made of higher sectoral minimum wages set on the basis of <lb/>collective agreements. <lb/>Active labour market policies and in-work benefits could be improved <lb/>29. <lb/>Total spending on ALMPs is relatively high (Figure 9) and spending per unemployed has <lb/>increased by almost 50% since 2007. Spending increased particularly for training and integrating the <lb/>disabled, in line with recommendations in the 2012 Economic Survey of Germany. However, spending per <lb/>unemployed on public employment services increased sharply as well and is now unusually high. While in <lb/>many cases ALMPs are found to be counterproductive, i.e. rather extending the time of unemployment <lb/>(Federal Government, 2006), placement services and hiring subsidies are found to be particularly effective <lb/>in the short-term, whereas instruments aiming at improving education outcomes take more time to unfold <lb/>their effects but are considered to be more beneficial in the long-term (Kluve, 2013). <lb/></body>

Vouchers -including for education and private job placement <lb/>services -as well as hiring subsidies are more often taken up and actually used by individuals with a <lb/>comparatively strong socio-economic background. Self-selection effects within target groups may persist, <lb/>in part because better educated individuals are often better informed and less discouraged (Heyer et al., <lb/>2011). <lb/>31. <lb/>Hiring subsidies (Eingliederungszuschuss), which are considered to be effective in bringing long-<lb/>term unemployed and migrants back to work, could be targeted more towards the neediest (Butschek and <lb/>Walter, 2013; Heyer et al., 2011). For example hiring subsidies could become more generous for the most <lb/>disadvantaged individuals with the longest unemployment spells. Hiring subsidies could be accompanied <lb/>to a larger extent by incentives to achieve higher general education to ensure a lasting integration of <lb/>disadvantaged individuals in the labour market and increase income mobility (Kluve, 2013). <lb/>32. <lb/>Steps have been taken to raise the incentives of public employment service offices to direct <lb/>efforts more towards bringing the most disadvantaged individuals into work in 2014, including the <lb/>long-term unemployed and low skilled. These steps are welcome. However, continued assistance and <lb/>guidance following placement, during the initial period in work, is also needed to ensure lasting integration <lb/>into the labour market. Also incentives of providers of private job placement services should be reviewed, <lb/>as these vouchers benefit mostly job searchers with relatively high employability (Heyer et al., 2011). <lb/>33. <lb/>There is scope to further review in-work benefits to ensure that the most vulnerable receive <lb/>sufficient support while minimising disincentives to work. For instance, means-tested subsistence benefits <lb/>are currently phased out as earnings rise above EUR 100. While the phasing out is already slower for <lb/>families with children, the benefits could be phased out more slowly for particularly vulnerable <lb/>individuals, such as single parents (Meister, 2009). Child benefits paid to parents receiving a housing <lb/>allowance could also be phased out more slowly to remove disincentives to work. Currently they are <lb/>discontinued abruptly at a certain income level. <lb/>ECO/WKP(2014)71 <lb/></body>

			<body>The education system could provide more support for the disadvantaged <lb/>34. <lb/>PISA results in Germany have improved in all three PISA domains and are now above the OECD <lb/>average. These improvements were mostly due to better results among students coming from a lower <lb/>socio-economic or immigrant background (OECD, 2013i and 2014). However, the link between <lb/>socioeconomic background and mathematics performance remains strong compared to the OECD average <lb/>and immigrants remain more disadvantaged than nationals (Figure 10). A strong link between socio-<lb/>economic background and learning outcomes undermines employment prospects and income mobility of <lb/>the most vulnerable. <lb/>Figure 10. Impact of socio-economic status on the average difference in performance in mathematics¹ <lb/>2012 <lb/>1. <lb/>The average difference in mathematics score between students whose socio-economic status differs by one unit of the PISA <lb/>index of economic, social and cultural status. The lower the value the smaller the difference (or the more equal performance <lb/>between advantaged and disadvantaged students). <lb/>Source: OECD (2013), PISA 2012 Results: Excellence through Equity, Giving Every Student the Chance to Succeed, Vol. II, <lb/>preliminary version. <lb/>Reviewing system level policies <lb/>35. <lb/>Further reforms are needed to improve learning outcomes and facilitate access to upper <lb/>secondary and tertiary education among disadvantaged youth. Performance variation between schools is <lb/>relatively large, reflecting in large part stratification of the school system (OECD, 2012c) and a high share <lb/>of disadvantaged students going to disadvantaged schools (OECD, 2013i). Efforts should be made to <lb/>continue to reduce stratification of the school system as recommended in the 2008 Economic Survey of <lb/>Germany. Also, grade repetition, which is particularly widespread in Germany, should be reduced. It <lb/>widens inequity, increases the likelihood of dropping out and does not improve education outcomes <lb/>(OECD, 2012c). Moreover, grade repetition raises total expenditure on primary and secondary education <lb/>by 7%. Moreover, efforts should continue to remove financial barriers to access to tertiary education. The <lb/>main federal means-tested student support scheme provides grants and loans with income contingent <lb/>repayments of up to EUR 8 040 per year for needy students. However, consideration should be given to <lb/>raising the maximum amount of support and to making all loan repayments contingent. While an additional <lb/>preferential student loan scheme provides loans of up to EUR 7 200 per year, their repayment is not <lb/>contingent on income. <lb/>36. <lb/>A relatively large share of pupils with learning difficulties is separated from the mainstream and <lb/>placed in classes or schools for children with learning difficulties or disabilities (Figure 11, top panel; <lb/>OECD, 2012c). Pupils are more likely to be assigned to such special needs schools if their socio-economic <lb/>background is disadvantaged. For example, children with migrant background are overrepresented in <lb/></body>

			<note place="headnote">ECO/WKP(2014)71 <lb/></note>

			<body>special needs schools. Also, the share of pupils in special needs schools varies considerably across Länder <lb/>(Figure 11, bottom panel). Assignment of pupils to special needs schools undermines their career prospects <lb/>early on, as many of them leave school without having completed even lower secondary education. <lb/>Instead, integrating children with learning difficulties in mainstream classes and schools raises their <lb/>education outcomes and is less costly (OECD, 2009). In this context, the initiative by the Länder to <lb/>promote integrated education is welcome (Kultusministerkonferenz, 2010). A coherent strategy should be <lb/>developed for integrated education across Länder, limiting assignment of children to separate special needs <lb/>education, and avoiding that children with disadvantaged socio-economic background are assigned to them <lb/>on account of their weak socio-economic status. <lb/>Figure 11.

In Germany, 10.6% of youth aged 18-24 <lb/>have at most lower secondary education and are not in education or training, many of them with migrant <lb/>background, according to Eurostat; about 8% do not complete lower secondary education. While special <lb/>training measures exist to integrate these youth into vocational education and training (VET), they are <lb/>often not successful. Around 260 000 youth (26 % of all youth entering VET per year) attended special <lb/>training programmes in 2012 (Federal Statistical Office of Germany, 2014). Half of them are expected to <lb/>not successfully complete formal VET (Authoring Group Educational Reporting, 2013; Klemm, 2012). <lb/>Against this backdrop greater efforts are needed to help early school leavers to achieve at least upper <lb/>secondary education. Guaranteeing direct access to VET to all school leavers, an idea also spelled out in <lb/></body>

			<body>the 2013 coalition agreement, would require additional resources of about EUR 1.5 billion per year, <lb/>according to Klemm (2012). However, this cost is likely to be partially recovered through higher tax <lb/>revenues in the long-term. To achieve this goal, existing training programmes need to be tailored more <lb/>towards bringing youth quickly into mainstream VET programmes in close cooperation with private <lb/>companies (Plicht, 2010). The federal government and governments of the Länder are setting up a <lb/>programme (education chains) to streamline the existing initiatives in vocational orientation and to <lb/>strengthen the transition from school into mainstream VET. In 2013 the Länder jointly made proposals to <lb/>improve school-based training programs in the transition system. Some of these policies to make economic <lb/>growth more socially inclusive also require additional public funding. <lb/>38. <lb/>Efforts should also continue to raise the employability of older workers and immigrants. Lifelong <lb/>learning can help to improve employability among experienced workers, thereby reducing poverty risks as <lb/>suggested in the 2012 Economic Survey of Germany. Specialisation early on should be avoided as older <lb/>workers, who face a high risk of long-term unemployment (Figure 5), are particularly vulnerable to <lb/>structural changes. Despite recent reforms, difficulties in the recognition of professional and vocational <lb/>qualifications obtained abroad hold back earnings prospects of immigrants. The Federal Recognition Act, <lb/>in force since April 2012, has proved effective. The first data show that in most cases the equivalence of <lb/>foreign professional qualifications was established and the recognition was granted. However, differences <lb/>continue to exist in the recognition of foreign credentials across Länder. This limits the capacity of <lb/>immigrants to move to locations where their skills are in highest demand (OECD, 2013e). The recognition <lb/>of professional and vocational qualifications should be furthered facilitated, as planned by the government, <lb/>and harmonized across Länder. <lb/>Providing more targeted support to disadvantaged pupils <lb/>39. <lb/>The share of public spending on compulsory schooling directed to children of low-income <lb/>families is lower than in most other OECD countries (Verbist et al., 2012). As in many OECD countries, <lb/>there is scope to provide more financial resources to schools with a comparatively high share of pupils with <lb/>weak socio-economic background (OECD, 2012c). For instance, considerable differences exist in spending <lb/>per pupil across school tracks with spending per pupil being lower in middle schools (Realschule) than in <lb/>high schools (Gymnasium). Also modern secondary schools (Hauptschulen) have difficulties in attracting <lb/>qualified teachers (Authoring Group Educational Reporting, 2013), indicating that their employment <lb/>conditions need to be improved. More financial and career incentives should be provided to attract and <lb/>retain high quality teachers and leaders in schools attended by disadvantaged children also with regard to <lb/>the large share of older teachers currently on active duty (OECD, 2014). It should be ensured that teachers <lb/>earn the same across different school tracks. To address learning gaps and avoid grade repetition, which is <lb/>relatively high, it should be ensured that an adequate environment for learning is made available to the <lb/>most disadvantaged children, including for counselling, mentoring and smoothing transitions between the <lb/>different levels of education (OECD, 2012c). <lb/>40. <lb/>To further increase the benefits of existing early childhood education and care additional <lb/>resources should be made available: to increase the staff-child ratio; to provide more integrated education <lb/>and care; and to ensure early childhood professionals (e.g. educators, pedagogues, etc.) have better <lb/>qualifications, more professional development opportunities and better working conditions, as planned by <lb/>the government (OECD, 2012e; Federal Ministry for Labour and Social Affairs, 2013). The Länder have <lb/>developed a competence-oriented qualification profile for childcare workers in order to enhance and <lb/>harmonize the quality of training programmes (Kultusministerkonferenz, 2011) and have made efforts to <lb/>establish training courses at tertiary level. In the short term, however shortages of qualified staff need to be <lb/>addressed. <lb/>41. <lb/>The education package (Bildungspaket) is an initiative by the federal government to help children <lb/>from poor households to participate in social activities and receive learning support. However, it may fail <lb/></body>

			<body>to reach the most vulnerable, despite means-testing, because of self-selection (Krug and Popp, 2008). <lb/>Disadvantaged parents, including those with migrant background, are less likely to be aware of education <lb/>support programmes for their children (Apel and Engels, 2012) and they tend to underestimate the long-<lb/>term benefits of such activities. Therefore, continued effort is needed to ensure that the neediest children <lb/>benefit from the programme, for example by continuing to tailor information and assistance towards these <lb/>families. It should also be ensured that more funds are allocated to tutoring of disadvantaged children to <lb/>improve their learning outcomes. Currently, this is only possible if a teacher certifies that a child is at risk <lb/>of repeating a school year. Only 4% of children from families receiving subsistence payments or housing <lb/>subsidies receive such support (Apel and Engels, 2012). Providing more funding for tutoring to <lb/>disadvantaged children independently of whether they are at risk of repeating a school year could help <lb/>them to perform better at school, which might encourage them to aim for higher education later on. <lb/>Reforming health insurance to tackle inequalities <lb/>42. <lb/>The segmentation of health insurance into a private sector, which covers about 10% of the <lb/>population, and a public sector, which covers the remaining 90% (Box 5) raises efficiency concerns <lb/>(OECD, 2008b; German Council of Economic Experts, 2006). Low and middle income earners and <lb/>individuals with poorer health status are generally covered by public health insurance, where contributions <lb/>are independent of health risks and proportional to wage income up to a ceiling. Employees with a wage <lb/>income above EUR 53 550 per year can opt out of public insurance and choose private insurance instead. <lb/>High income earners with good health status have incentives to choose private insurance because insurance <lb/>premia do not depend on income and because private insurers can adjust the terms of contracts they offer <lb/>to new insurees in line with their perceived health risks. Moreover, private insurers do not participate in the <lb/>central health fund, which redistributes insurance contributions of public insurers on the basis of risk-<lb/>adjusted transfers. The central health fund helps to avoid selection on the basis of risk (Box 3.5; OECD, <lb/>2008b). Private insurers can therefore compete on the basis of risk selection rather than on the basis of <lb/>efficiency. Moreover, competition within the private insurance sector is de facto limited to attracting new <lb/>entrants to the private system. New insurees can be selected on the basis of risk in most contracts, making <lb/>individuals reluctant to switch, for example, after facing chronic conditions. Moreover, switching between <lb/>private insurance providers is costly due to the restricted portability of ageing reserves (Box 5). <lb/>43. <lb/>Private insurance can also result in poverty risks for some individuals when they experience a <lb/>drop in income. These risks affect older workers, because insurance premia tend to increase with age and <lb/>because they cannot return to the public insurance system. They also affect the self-employed, who do not <lb/>generally have access to public insurance and may face high income uncertainty. It is therefore possible <lb/>that the current health insurance system discourages risk-averse workers from becoming self-employed, <lb/>especially if their business plans imply uncertain income prospects, as may particularly be the case for <lb/>innovative start-ups. While special tariffs have to be provided by private health insurance companies for <lb/>individuals who have difficulties in paying, they can be fairly expensive or provide only limited coverage <lb/>(Box 5; Federal Ministry of Health, 2013a). While the dual health insurance system in Germany has a long <lb/>tradition, it generates difficulties in today&apos;s labour market, in which employment histories often include <lb/>changes in employment status and earnings. <lb/>ECO/WKP(2014)71 <lb/></body>

			<page>25 <lb/></page>

			<body>44. <lb/>The German Council of Economic Experts (2006) and the 2008 OECD Economic Survey of <lb/>Germany therefore suggested integrating private health insurance providers in the central health fund. The <lb/>German Council of Economic Experts also suggested imposing the obligation to contract on all insurers <lb/>and limiting the cost of mandatory health insurance for low-income households with government transfers. <lb/>This would imply that all insurance companies provide mandatory health insurance packages to all <lb/>individuals on equal terms, as public insurance companies already do. Such a reform would remove <lb/>incentives for risk selection and reduce poverty risks. However, it would give rise to substantial transitory <lb/>challenges. In particular, it requires dealing with the reserves accumulated in the private health insurance <lb/>system. <lb/>45. <lb/>While the introduction of the central health fund (see Box 5) has raised efficiency and <lb/>transparency, it should be developed further (Drösler et al., 2011). As only a limited number of 80 diseases <lb/>are considered to determine risk-adjusted transfers, public health insurance companies continue to have <lb/>Box 5. The German health insurance system <lb/>Healthcare coverage is provided through a mix of public health insurance, which covers about 90% of the <lb/>population, and private health insurance for eligible individuals who opted out of the public system, including many civil <lb/>servants. <lb/>Public health insurance: Employees with gross yearly earnings currently below EUR 53 550 must be insured in <lb/>the public health insurance system. Non-profit public insurers are funded mostly via the central health fund, which <lb/>collects 15.5% of labour income from all insured (14.6 percentage points are equally shared by employer and <lb/>employee and 0.9 percentage points are paid by the employee alone) and then distributes funds to insurers as risk-<lb/>adjusted transfers. Individual insurers compete mainly via additional lump-sum surcharges which they can levy on their <lb/>clients (up to a limit of 2% of the income of the insured individual). The federal government contributed 7.4% to the <lb/>central health fund&apos;s revenues in 2012 (Federal Ministry of Health, 2013a). Non-working spouses and children up to a <lb/>certain age are insured at no extra cost if they have no income above EUR 395 (or EUR 450 out of a minijob). Public <lb/>insurers are subject to the obligation to accept every individual fulfilling the criteria for access to the public scheme and <lb/>wishing to conclude a contract with them and cannot vary premia according to individual risk. The 2013 coalition <lb/>agreement stipulates abolishing the lump sum surcharges which can be levied by individual insurers, replacing them <lb/>by income dependent surcharges to be paid by the employee. <lb/>Private health insurance: Employees with gross yearly earnings currently exceeding EUR 53 550 can opt out of <lb/>the public health insurance scheme. The self-employed must insure themselves in the private sector unless they were <lb/>insured in the public sector before becoming self-employed, in which case they can choose between public and private <lb/>insurance. Civil servants are reimbursed 50% of their healthcare costs by their employers if they take out private <lb/>insurance. Premia do not depend on income and, in general, insurers can charge higher fees to new clients depending <lb/>on their perceived health risks. Private health insurance companies are obliged to build up old age reserves for their <lb/>clients, which are in principle portable if switching between private health insurance providers (Commonwealth Fund, <lb/>2012). However, switching between private insurance providers is costly because the scope of portable ageing <lb/>reserves is restricted to that of the basic tariff and to insurees who joined private health insurance after 2008. <lb/>Therefore, in practice competition among private health insurance companies is limited to attracting new entrants to <lb/>the private system. <lb/>Private insurers are obliged to offer special tariffs for individuals having difficulties in paying for their health <lb/>insurance. The basic and the standard tariff provide coverage comparable to the one of public insurance, but these <lb/>tariffs cost up to EUR 610 per month in 2013 regardless of income. Income support is provided by the government only <lb/>if the privately insured&apos;s income risks falling below the subsistence threshold. For individuals who fall behind with their <lb/>contribution payments, an emergency tariff (Notlagentarif) was introduced in 2013 with a premium not higher than <lb/>EUR 125. However, it provides considerably less coverage than public insurance (Federal Ministry of Health, 2013b). <lb/>The transition from private health insurance back to public health insurance is only possible under certain, narrow <lb/>circumstances. Employees whose income falls below the income threshold can switch to the public system if they are <lb/>less than 55 years old. In principle switching is not possible for the self-employed. <lb/></body>

			<body>incentives to discriminate against clients with diseases not included in the adjustment, for example <lb/>including some forms of mental ill health. Despite an obligation to contract, public insurance companies <lb/>can influence their client structure to some extent, for instance by advertising their services to selected <lb/>groups. Therefore, the current risk-adjustment should be reviewed and include a larger number of diseases. <lb/>46. <lb/>Unlike in other countries with central health funds, the treatment costs of deceased individuals <lb/>are not annualized when determining disease specific transfers. For higher age groups and diseases with <lb/>high death tolls costs are systematically underestimated and thus transfers from the central health fund too <lb/>low (Buchner et al., 2012). It should be ensured that risk-adjusted transfers are set high enough for clients <lb/>with cost-intensive diseases characterized by high morbidity as also spelled out in the 2013 coalition <lb/>agreement. <lb/>Limiting the risk of rising old age poverty <lb/>47. <lb/>Although old age poverty is not a major concern in Germany today, this is expected to change as <lb/>population ageing and past pension reforms will reduce the level of pensions in the public system relative <lb/>to income earned during active life (German Council of Economic Experts, 2013). Net pension <lb/>replacement rates for future retirees are among the lowest across OECD countries, especially for workers <lb/>earning half the average wage and retiring after a full career (OECD, 2013h). One reason is that pension <lb/>claims are more closely related to income than in most other OECD countries. In this context, the rise of <lb/>low pay-jobs, low wage mobility and emerging labour market dualisation aggravate risks of old-age <lb/>poverty. Helping workers to acquire sufficient pension claims over their working life by improving <lb/>earnings prospects of workers subject to low-pay and part-time work is the best way to tackle the risk of <lb/>old age poverty. In this context labour market reforms to boost permanent full-time employment as <lb/>outlined above are particularly helpful. <lb/>48. <lb/>The 2013 coalition agreement includes several measures to extend pension claims for selected <lb/>groups. Workers with a contribution record of at least 45 years will be able to retire with a full pension at <lb/>age 63 initially, rising to 65 years, in line with the increase of the standard legal pension age from 65 to <lb/>67 years. If implemented, they provide an incentive to retire earlier. Pension top-ups will also be paid to <lb/>mothers whose children were born before 1992 and invalidity pensions will be raised. In the medium term, <lb/>these measures will be funded by payroll contributions, which are projected to be 0.4 percentage points <lb/>higher as a result of the planned measures by 2030. There are also plans to implement a minimum pension <lb/>for people with a contribution record of at least 40 years and low pension entitlements at a later stage. The <lb/>plans are not specifically targeted at addressing old-age poverty, which could become a problem in decades <lb/>to come, and thus may generate more spending pressures in the future. If pension entitlements for workers <lb/>with a low earnings record are deemed too low, a cost effective way of raising incomes for pensioners with <lb/>low entitlements while safeguarding incentives to work would be to phase out means-tested subsistence <lb/>benefits more slowly as pension entitlements rise. <lb/>49. <lb/>The mandatory public pension system generally covers employees only. Only about one quarter <lb/>of the self-employed, mainly in professional services, are covered by alternative mandatory pension <lb/>schemes (German Council of Economic Experts, 2011). The remaining self-employed workers, often <lb/>including the most vulnerable, are not covered (German Council of Economic Experts, 2013). They may <lb/>not sufficiently price in future pension requirements to offer their goods and services at a low price. This <lb/>creates a coverage gap raising the risk that self-employed workers have to rely on social assistance benefits <lb/>during retirement. Firms have incentives to outsource work to these self-employed workers at low cost in <lb/>order to avoid pension contributions, raising precarious self-employment and weakening government <lb/>finances. Against this backdrop, all self-employed should be included in the mandatory public pension <lb/>scheme. <lb/></body>

Such a step should be placed in the context of a broader reform to make the tax system <lb/>more conducive to economic growth. In particular this involves continued efforts to reduce the tax burden <lb/>on labour income, especially for workers on low pay. Such a reform should also include measures on the <lb/>expenditure side of the social security system. More revenues could be raised from taxes on consumption, <lb/>real estate and environmentally harmful behaviour, as suggested in the 2012 Economic Survey of Germany. <lb/>52. <lb/>Some sources of capital income benefit from preferential tax treatment. Households&apos; capital <lb/>income (interest payments, dividends) is generally taxed at a rate of 26.4% at the household level, although <lb/>households&apos; interest income benefits from a tax-free allowance up to EUR 801. The general tax rate for <lb/>capital income is, in many cases, below the marginal income tax households pay on their other income, as <lb/>capital income is particularly concentrated among high-income households. These reduced tax rates have <lb/>in the past helped to reduce tax evasion through capital flight. However, efforts have been made to improve <lb/>international cooperation to prevent tax fraud. A moderate increase in capital income taxation may <lb/>therefore not lead to more tax evasion (Bach and Beznoska, 2012b). Consideration should be given to align <lb/>the taxation of capital income to the taxation of other personal income. Moreover, households are fully <lb/>exempt from capital gains tax on housing property, held for more than 10 years, even if the owner does not <lb/>live in the dwelling concerned. This tax exemption risks biasing investment decision towards residential <lb/>housing, especially in the current low interest rate environment which may encourage expectations of <lb/>rising prices and benefits high-wealth households the most (Frick and Grabka, 2009; Deutsche <lb/>Bundesbank, 2013; European Central Bank, 2013). Realised capital gains on housing should be taxed, <lb/>except for owner-occupied housing. <lb/>53. <lb/>Inheritance taxes have less distortionary effects and entail a lower administrative burden than <lb/>other forms of taxation of wealth (Bach and Beznoska, 2012a). There is scope to further increase revenues <lb/>from inheritance taxes by removing exemptions. Wealth held in small and medium sized enterprises is <lb/>ECO/WKP(2014)71 <lb/></body>

			<page>28 <lb/></page>

			<body>subject to lower inheritance taxation than other forms of wealth under certain conditions. Households <lb/>therefore have incentives to transform private into business property to lower their tax burden (Bach and <lb/>Beznoska, 2012b). The conditions for such transformations have recently been tightened. The remaining <lb/>tax advantages provided to small firms in inheritance taxation should be reconsidered. To avoid liquidity <lb/>problems for businesses subject to inheritance tax, tax payments can already be stretched over ten years. <lb/>During this period, the tax liability could be subordinated to other claims on the business (see e.g. the 2004 <lb/>Economic Survey of Germany). <lb/>Regional pockets of poverty risk could be addressed more effectively <lb/>54. <lb/>Although dispersion of GDP per capita across Länder continued to decline over the past decade <lb/>and is now lower in Germany than in most other EU countries, the risk of relative poverty has risen to a <lb/>considerably higher level in East than in West Germany and continues to diverge (Grabka et al., 2012). <lb/>55. <lb/>The current revenue-sharing system including fiscal federal transfers is based on population as <lb/>well as on multipliers which only reflect differences in population density (Söllner, 2001). Although, <lb/>additional discretionary transfers exist, in part to account for differences in long-term unemployment rates, <lb/>they do not take into account additional socioeconomic and demographic characteristics, such as migrant <lb/>status, or age composition, in the population structure across the Länder, which contribute to different <lb/>levels of demand for public services provided by Länder and municipalities on their territory (Feld et al., <lb/>2013; Heinemann, 2012). It should be considered to enlarge the set of criteria based on which transfers are <lb/>provided, e.g. by including differences in age composition, socio-economic or migrant background. The <lb/>advantage of including such demographic indicators in the determination of fiscal federal transfers is that <lb/>they can help align such transfers with demand for social services more effectively without harming <lb/>incentives of the poorest jurisdictions to strengthen their growth potential (Joumard and Kongsrud, 2003). <lb/>56. <lb/>Subnational government levels may also face disincentives to provide adequate provision for key <lb/>services that can help to boost inclusive economic growth. For example, municipalities may not fully take <lb/>into account the benefits provided by childcare facilities and early childhood education, for which they <lb/>have funding responsibilities, because they partly accrue to neighbouring jurisdictions or even nation-wide. <lb/>Special grants from state to local governments are available to address such externalities. However they are <lb/>provided on a discretionary basis with rules (for local grants) differing considerably across the Länder <lb/>(Dombert, 2006). The government should consider assuming funding responsibilities for key social <lb/>services provided by subnational governments subject to geographic externalities, which are particularly <lb/>important for inclusive growth. For example, the federal government could finance vouchers for families <lb/>with young children which they could use to pay for the services of accredited childcare facilities. <lb/></body>

			<body>Box 6. Recommendations to foster inclusive growth <lb/>Labour market <lb/> Continue to expand early childcare provision, notably for full-day care. Ensure equal access of the most <lb/>vulnerable to affordable high-quality childcare independently of their place of residence and socio-economic <lb/>background. Extend the supply of all-day schools. <lb/> Reduce the gap in employment protection between permanent and temporary workers by reducing <lb/>protection of permanent workers and by limiting the use of multiple successive fixed term contracts with the <lb/>same employee. <lb/> Introduce a general minimum wage at a sufficiently low level that will not lead to job losses, determined by <lb/>an expert commission. Cautious use should be made of higher sectoral minimum wages set on the basis of <lb/>collective agreements. <lb/> Target the preferential tax treatment of minijobs towards low-wage workers. <lb/> Make active labour market policies more targeted by monitoring self-selection problems within target <lb/>groups. Continue to review in-work benefits to ensure that the most vulnerable receive sufficient support <lb/>while minimising disincentives to work. For instance, phase out more slowly means-tested subsistence <lb/>benefits for particularly vulnerable individuals earning more than EUR 100. Also phase out additional child <lb/>benefits paid to parents receiving a housing allowance more slowly. <lb/>Education <lb/> Reduce stratification of the school system and provide more financial resources to schools with a <lb/>comparatively high share of pupils with weak socio-economic background. Reduce grade repetitions. <lb/>Provide more support for disadvantaged youth to complete formal upper secondary education programmes, <lb/>in particular mainstream VET. Continue reducing the assignment of pupils to special needs schools and <lb/>make sure assignment to such schools does not reflect the socio-economic background of pupils. <lb/> Improve the quality of early childhood education and care, including by improving the staff-child ratio in <lb/>accredited facilities; by better integrating education and care; and by ensuring early childhood professionals <lb/>have better qualifications, more professional development opportunities and better working conditions. <lb/>Tax and transfer system <lb/> Extend compulsory pensions to the self-employed. <lb/> Focus additional pension entitlements on reducing future old age poverty risks, for example, by phasing out <lb/>subsistence benefit entitlements more slowly as pension entitlements rise. <lb/> Fund such additional spending from general tax revenue instead of higher payroll taxes. Strengthen <lb/>incentives to retire later. <lb/> Extend capital gains taxes on residential real estate except for owner-occupied housing. Raise the tax rates <lb/>applying to household capital income towards marginal income tax rates applying to other household <lb/>income. <lb/> Equalize the inheritance tax burden for different forms of wealth. <lb/> Further improve the determination of risk-adjusted transfers within the health fund, by considering a larger <lb/>number of diseases and by ensuring that transfers for higher age groups and diseases with high death tolls <lb/>are high enough. <lb/></body>
