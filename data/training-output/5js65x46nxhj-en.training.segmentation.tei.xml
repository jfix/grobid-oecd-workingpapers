			<body>EXCESS CAPACITY IN THE GLOBAL STEEL INDUSTRY AND THE IMPLICATIONS OF <lb/>NEW INVESTMENT PROJECTS <lb/>by Anthony de Carvalho, Naoki Sekiguchi and Filipe Silva <lb/>OECD, Paris <lb/>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS <lb/>Government and industry representatives participating in the OECD Steel Committee are <lb/>increasingly concerned about excess capacity in the global steel industry. Excess capacity has led to <lb/>deterioration in the financial situation of steelmakers and is raising questions about its impact on the <lb/>longer-term economic viability and efficiency of the industry. As a result, the OECD Steel Committee <lb/>plans to deepen its work on excess capacity in the next biennium. This paper combines two documents <lb/>that were declassified by the Steel Committee in early 2015, one that summarises the main policy issues <lb/>regarding excess capacity and one which focusses on monitoring new steel investment projects taking <lb/>place around the world. The Secretariat would like to thank all delegations that have contributed <lb/>actively to the Steel Committee&apos;s activities on excess capacity, particularly those that provided very <lb/>useful comments and feedback on the two papers that were combined to form this Policy Paper. <lb/>Nevertheless, any remaining errors or omissions are the responsibility of the Secretariat. <lb/></body>

			<body>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY <lb/>Governments participating in the OECD Steel Committee consider excess capacity as being one of the <lb/>main challenges facing the global steel sector today. Following the Ministerial Council Meeting on <lb/>6-7 May 2014, where Ministers stressed the need to address the issue of excess capacity in some industries <lb/>such as steel, the OECD Steel Committee has deepened its discussions on capacity, and will take this work <lb/>further in the next few years. To increase visibility of the key issues, the Steel Committee declassified two <lb/>papers linked to excess capacity in early 2015. Those two papers have been combined to form this Policy <lb/>Paper on excess steelmaking capacity and the implications of new investment projects. <lb/>More specifically, this paper examines the extent, causes, and impacts of excess capacity in the global <lb/>steel industry, and provides detailed information on new investment projects that are taking place around <lb/>the world in order to help governments and industry better understand the extent to which excess <lb/>steelmaking capacity may evolve in the future. For readers interested in knowing further details about <lb/>investment developments taking place in the global steel industry, an Annex is provided that presents <lb/>tables with detailed information on the companies that are investing and the financial amounts involved, <lb/>the technologies being invested in, the ownership status of the projects and their expected starting date, as <lb/>well as some qualitative comments about the projects to provide context where needed. <lb/>The results indicate that global steelmaking capacity will continue to expand, with regions that are <lb/>currently net importers of steel products expected to record the largest capacity increases. Of particular <lb/>importance for governments in this context will be to work towards removing market distorting policies such <lb/>as subsidies that promote the emergence of new capacity or delay the closure of failing companies. The main <lb/>findings of this paper are: <lb/>• Excess capacity remains high. The global steel industry&apos;s capacity to produce steel has more <lb/>than doubled since the early 2000s to support growing construction and manufacturing activity, <lb/>as well as to help build infrastructure particularly in emerging economies. With investment <lb/>projects continuing to increase in a number of economies, and while steel consumption growth is <lb/>anticipated to remain moderate, the global imbalance between capacity and demand will continue <lb/>to pose risks for the industry for the foreseeable future, unless more concerted efforts are made <lb/>by industry and governments to address the challenge. Global nominal steelmaking capacity is <lb/>projected to increase to 2.36 billion tonnes by 2017, up from 2.16 billion tonnes in 2013. <lb/>Non-OECD economies will continue to lead the capacity expansion in the global steel industry, <lb/>with their share of world capacity expected to increase to 71.4% by 2017. <lb/> • Government interventions are contributing to global excess capacity. Specific concerns <lb/>related to government steel policies include continued government subsidies (notably subsidies <lb/>for the creation of new capacity or the maintenance of inefficient capacities) and continued <lb/>approvals for new steel facilities. Governments have also noted that trade related measures, <lb/>constraints on foreign investment, and the activities of government financial agencies are also <lb/>contributing to global excess capacity and creating difficulties for the industry in addition to <lb/>weak market conditions.<lb/></body>

			<front>• Excess capacity is hurting the global steel industry. Excessive levels of steelmaking capacity <lb/>have important implications for the steel industry, resulting in over-supply, low prices, weak <lb/>profitability, bankruptcies and localised job losses. Given the global nature of the industry, excess <lb/>capacity in one region can displace production in other regions, thus harming producers in those <lb/>markets and creating risks for trade actions and government interventions to protect domestic <lb/>industries. It can also lead to wasteful energy use and thus have negative environmental impacts. <lb/> • What should be done? In competitive economies, it is the responsibility of the steel companies <lb/>themselves to identify ways to adapt to changing market conditions. The role of governments <lb/>should be to allow market mechanisms to work properly and avoid measures that artificially <lb/>support steelmaking capacity. Of particular importance for governments will be to work towards <lb/>removing market distorting policies such as subsidies that promote the emergence of new <lb/>capacity or delay the closure of failing companies, eliminating trade and investment barriers that <lb/>slow the restructuring that is needed for the industry, allowing market-based investment decisions <lb/>in the steel sector, and ensuring that new plants are subject to standards that protect the <lb/>environment and uphold worker safety.<lb/></front>

			<body>1. Introduction <lb/>Excess capacity is one of the main challenges facing the global steel sector today. The growing gap <lb/>between global steelmaking capacity and demand has led to deterioration in the financial situation of <lb/>steelmakers, and has raised concerns about the longer-term economic viability and efficiency of the <lb/>industry. Although excess capacity in the global steel industry has increased significantly since the <lb/>financial crisis, and despite slowing demand growth in global markets, there continues to be new <lb/>investment projects in many parts of the world. <lb/>On the one hand, while the opening and closure of steel plants is usually based on the commercial <lb/>decisions of private companies, government interventions that support the building of new capacity or keep <lb/>inefficient facilities in operation can exacerbate the problem of global excess capacity and harm the <lb/>business conditions of efficient steel producers in all markets. On the other hand, policies that promote the <lb/>efficient restructuring of the industry or provide assistance to workers who may be displaced by the closure <lb/>of uneconomic mills can be useful tools to address the problem and promote greater stability in global steel <lb/>markets. <lb/>Following the Ministerial Council Meeting on 6-7 May 2014, where Ministers stressed the need to <lb/>address the issue of excess capacity in some industries such as steel, the OECD Steel Committee has <lb/>deepened its discussions on capacity, and will take this work further in the next few years. 1 In addition to <lb/>monitoring capacity developments, the Committee plans on examining government policies and their <lb/>effects on global excess capacity, with an aim to reach a common understanding about which policies: <lb/>i) promote a better functioning of the market and more efficient global steel industry; and ii) contribute to <lb/>excess steelmaking capacity by distorting trade and competition in domestic and global markets. <lb/>This paper examines the extent, reasons and impacts of excess capacity in the global steel industry, as <lb/>well as the implications of new investment projects that continue to take place at a rapid pace in many parts <lb/>of the world. By focussing on new investment projects taking place in the global steel industry, this study <lb/>intends to help governments and industry better understand the extent to which global steelmaking excess <lb/>capacity may evolve in the future. The information on individual investment projects presented in the <lb/>Annex of this paper is also provided via an online database available to the public at <lb/>www.oecd.org/sti/steel. 2 <lb/>This Policy Paper finds that global steelmaking capacity will continue to expand, with regions that are <lb/>currently net importers of steel products expected to record the largest capacity increases. Global nominal <lb/></body>

			<body>steelmaking capacity is projected to increase to 2.36 billion tonnes by 2017, up from 2.16 billion tonnes in <lb/>2013. Non-OECD economies will continue to lead the capacity expansion in the global steel industry, with <lb/>their share of world capacity expected to increase to 71.4% by 2017. Of particular importance for <lb/>governments in this context will be to work towards removing market distorting policies such as subsidies <lb/>that promote the emergence of new capacity or delay the closure of failing companies. <lb/>The remainder of the paper is organised as follows. The next two sections briefly summarise the <lb/>extent and reasons for global excess capacity. The fourth section provides an overview of steel projects <lb/>currently taking place around the world, but leaves details about the types of equipment and furnaces that <lb/>companies are investing in for the tables in the Annex. The final two sections summarise some of the <lb/>OECD&apos;s work on the impacts of excess capacity and what should be done to address the challenge. Again, <lb/>readers interested in the details of investment projects by company and region are invited to refer to the <lb/>Annex or to the above-mentioned online database. <lb/>2. What is the extent of global excess capacity? <lb/>The global steel industry&apos;s capacity to produce steel has increased rapidly since the early 2000s, after <lb/>two decades of little growth. Most of the growth in steelmaking capacity has occurred in non-OECD <lb/>economies, to support growing construction and manufacturing activity, as well as to help build the <lb/>infrastructure necessary for the economic development of these emerging economies. The world&apos;s nominal <lb/>steelmaking capacity is estimated to have reached 2 241 million metric tonnes (mmt) in 2014, according to <lb/>the OECD Secretariat, a level that is more than twice as high as the 1 060 mmt capacity level observed in <lb/>2000. With investment projects continuing to take place in many parts of the world, nominal global <lb/>steelmaking capacity is expected to climb by a further 120 mmt in the period to 2017, bringing total <lb/>worldwide capacity to 2 361 mmt. At that point, non-OECD economies are expected to account for <lb/>approximately 71.4% of the world&apos;s total capacity (Figure 1). <lb/>Figure 1. Nominal crude steel capacity in OECD and Non-OECD economies <lb/>Source: OECD Secretariat. <lb/>Whether or not excess capacity arises is a function of whether demand has kept pace with this rapid <lb/>growth in supply. Although the industry is emerging from a severe cyclical downturn that was triggered by <lb/>the global economic and financial crisis of 2008-2009, demand recovery has been uneven and sluggish in <lb/>many economies. In 2013, crude steel demand stood at 1 648 mmt, or about 516 mmt below nominal <lb/>capacity, representing one of the highest gaps in the history of the global steel industry (Figure 2). With <lb/>investment projects continuing to increase in a number of economies while steel consumption growth is <lb/>anticipated to remain moderate, the global imbalance will continue to pose risks for the industry for the <lb/>0 <lb/>500 <lb/>1000 <lb/>1500 <lb/>2000 <lb/>2500 <lb/>Million tonnes <lb/>Global crude steel capacity <lb/>Non-OECD <lb/>OECD <lb/>0 <lb/>10 <lb/>20 <lb/>30 <lb/>40 <lb/>50 <lb/>60 <lb/>70 <lb/>80 <lb/>% <lb/>Composition of crude steel capacity <lb/>OECD <lb/>Non-OECD <lb/></body>

			<body>foreseeable future, unless more concerted efforts are made by industry and governments to address the <lb/>challenge. <lb/>However, it is important to note that measures of excess capacity cannot be imputed directly from the <lb/>gap between nominal capacity and demand. Indeed, it is not economic for the steel industry to run at full <lb/>capacity, even when pricing is attractive and companies appear to be maximising their output. During the <lb/>peak of the pre-crisis price upturn in the first half of 2008, for example, monthly global capacity utilisation <lb/>did not rise above 91%. 1 Seasonal factors as well as the need to occasionally close down operations to <lb/>refurbish steel plants and add new facilities tend to reduce the effective capacity of steel mills. <lb/>Figure 2. World crude steel capacity (nominal) and demand <lb/>Notes: The Secretariat assumes demand growth of 2% in 2014 and 2015. These are the most recent rates of growth forecast by the <lb/>World Steel Association for world apparent steel use (October 2014 Short Range Outlook). <lb/>Sources: OECD for nominal capacity and the World Steel Association for demand. <lb/>3. What are the reasons for global excess capacity? <lb/>The main factors that contribute to capacity imbalances in the steel industry include market downturns, <lb/>but also a number of government interventions and other market-distorting practices. As noted above, for <lb/>most steel mills, it is normal to have periods of under-utilised capacity. When demand and prices of steel <lb/>fall, profit-maximising firms should reduce production and thus leave a certain amount of capacity idle. <lb/>Profits will tend to be lower because the firms still have to finance their fixed assets, including their under-<lb/>utilised steelmaking furnaces and rolling facilities. If the situation persists over time, however, then firms <lb/>operating under normal market conditions would try to minimise their fixed costs by scaling back on <lb/>capacity, thus making excess capacity a short-run phenomenon. History has nevertheless demonstrated that <lb/>the adjustment process can be long and arduous in the steel industry, with some regions experiencing <lb/>extended periods of excess capacity. <lb/>1 . <lb/>Monthly capacity utilisation rates are according to World Steel Association data. <lb/>0 <lb/>100 <lb/>200 <lb/>300 <lb/>400 <lb/>500 <lb/>600 <lb/>700 <lb/>500 <lb/>700 <lb/>900 <lb/>1100 <lb/>1300 <lb/>1500 <lb/>1700 <lb/>1900 <lb/>2100 <lb/>2300 <lb/>2500 <lb/>Million tonnes <lb/>Million tonnes <lb/>Capacity/Demand gap (RHS) <lb/>Capacity (LHS) <lb/>Demand (LHS) <lb/></body>

			<body>On the one hand, this can be due to high exit barriers, namely the costs of closure that discourage <lb/>rapid adjustments in capacity. For example, capacity closures entail high costs of dismantling the mills, <lb/>potential clean-up and other environmental and labour-related costs. In the face of market uncertainty firms <lb/>may choose to delay exit rather than incur such costs. Expectations about future market conditions may <lb/>also be contributing to current excess capacity; for example, steelmakers in some countries are investing <lb/>heavily today in new steel production facilities in anticipation of much higher demand several years from <lb/>now. <lb/>On the other hand, excess capacity that persists over time can also be indicative of government actions <lb/>that hinder adjustments that would normally occur in competitive markets. Due to the importance and <lb/>strategic nature of the steel industry to many national economies, a tendency during market downturns is to <lb/>preserve the capacity of the industry, in order to alleviate unemployment and other social problems that <lb/>would otherwise occur due to capacity closures. In addition, in some large net steel-importing regions, <lb/>governments are also interested in moving towards greater &quot; self-sufficiency &quot; in steel production in order to <lb/>reduce their dependency on imports. Research by the Secretariat shows that, despite current market conditions, a <lb/>large number of new projects are taking place, which will increase global crude steelmaking capacity <lb/>significantly in the coming years. <lb/>In the current context, recent discussions at the OECD Steel Committee have suggested that in some <lb/>regions excess capacity reflects temporary factors related to the business cycle while in other cases it <lb/>reflects structural factors connected to government interventions. Specific concerns related to government <lb/>steel policies include continued government subsidies (notably subsidies for the creation of new capacity <lb/>or the maintenance of inefficient capacities) and continued approvals for new steel facilities. Governments <lb/>have also noted that trade related measures, constraints on foreign investment, and the activities of <lb/>government financial agencies are also contributing to global excess capacity and creating difficulties for <lb/>the industry in addition to weak market conditions. And finally, policy measures which discourage <lb/>&quot;optimal&quot; exit of the least productive plants may also contribute to excess capacity. <lb/>4. Future investment projects in the global steel industry <lb/>4.1. Brief summary of regional investment developments <lb/>Since the start of the 21 st century, many blast furnaces have been built around the world, particularly <lb/>in Asia (see Box 1). That region will continue to lead BF/BOF capacity expansions, supported by large-<lb/>scale integrated projects. As a consequence, the BF/BOF route is likely to remain the major technology for <lb/>iron/steelmaking, despite the announcement of many mini-mill projects in recent years. However, this <lb/>paper shows that regional differences are very large. Detailed information can be found in the tables in the <lb/>Annex, while a summary of key developments by region is provided below: <lb/>• There are no capacity additions being planned in the European Union.<lb/>• In the region referred to as &quot; Other Europe &quot; ,  3 crude steelmaking capacity is forecast to increase <lb/>to 64.4 million tonnes per year (tpy) by 2017. All of the increase in this region will occur in <lb/>Turkey, where many EAF projects are taking place. In line with EAF capacity expansions, <lb/>imports of scrap are expected to grow further in &quot; Other Europe &quot; . Iron ore imports into the region <lb/>are also expected to increase to some extent as some projects are intensive in iron ore/coking coal.<lb/>• In the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) region, steel mills are replacing out-dated <lb/>OHFs with BOF and EAF furnaces. Numerous EAF projects have been planned, which may <lb/>result in higher future scrap demand. Nevertheless, the BOF process is likely to remain the main<lb/></body>

			<body>production process in the region. As a consequence of several investment projects, steelmaking <lb/>capacity in the region is expected to reach 152.9 million tpy by 2017. <lb/>• In the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) region, the share of EAF in steel <lb/>production is expected to rise due to many DRI-based mini-mill projects, supported by the shale <lb/>gas boom and the relatively low natural gas prices associated with this development. DRI is <lb/>expected to be an increasingly important feedstock for producers in the region. Steelmaking <lb/>capacity in the region is projected to increase from 158.0 million tpy in 2013 to 163.5 million tpy <lb/>in 2017.<lb/>• In Latin America, BOF&apos;s share is likely to grow in the future owing to many greenfield slab-for-<lb/>export projects, even though some projects have been postponed. Also, some projects in the long <lb/>products segment are under way. As a result of these investment projects, steelmaking capacity in <lb/>the region is forecast to reach 77.4 million tpy by 2017.<lb/>• Although Africa is still reliant on imports to meet demand, some DRI-based mini-mill projects <lb/>are expected to raise the region&apos;s self-sufficiency (domestic production as a share of demand) <lb/>gradually. Steel production via the EAF route is expected to remain the major steelmaking <lb/>process. Steelmaking capacity in the region is forecast to increase from 33.2 million tpy in 2013 <lb/>to 40.2 million tpy by 2017.<lb/>• In the Middle East, steelmaking is expected to be predominantly EAF-based, and the preferred <lb/>feedstock would remain DRI (due to natural gas availability). Many DRI-based EAF projects <lb/>have been announced recently in the region, and are expected to contribute to reducing import <lb/>dependency. The region&apos;s production capacity is projected to increase to 69.5 million tpy by 2017.<lb/>• In China, steel production via the BOF route is expected to continue to play a dominant role in <lb/>steelmaking. However, EAF&apos;s share could gradually increase in the future, along with the <lb/>increasing availability of scrap, thus affecting the balance between BOF and EAF technologies. <lb/>Steelmaking capacity in the country is expected to reach 1.1 billion tpy by 2017. 4<lb/>• Although EAF is still the major steelmaking process in India, BOF&apos;s share may increase <lb/>significantly, supported by new investment projects that are iron ore/coking coal-intensive. The <lb/>country&apos;s crude steelmaking capacity was estimated to have reached more than 100 million tpy in <lb/>2013, and is expected to continue to increase to a level of 132.7 million tpy by 2017.<lb/>• In ASEAN-6, BOF&apos;s share in the region&apos;s crude steel production is expected to increase <lb/>gradually due to many BF/BOF investment projects. Therefore, iron ore/coking coal are expected <lb/>to become important raw materials for the region. Scrap imports have also been increasing due to <lb/>several mini-mill projects. The region&apos;s total steelmaking capacity is expected to increase to <lb/>58.8 million tpy by 2017.<lb/></body>

Asia will continue to lead the capacity expansion in terms of the BF/BOF process <lb/>Since the start of the 21st century, Asia has experienced a steel mill construction boom, supported by <lb/>investments in many large-sized blast furnaces (with inner volumes of more than 2000 m <lb/>3 ). The figure below maps <lb/>blast furnaces with inner volumes greater than 2000 m3 in Asia compared to the rest of the world. As a consequence, <lb/>Asian pig iron production expanded rapidly over the decade, rising from 361.3 mmt in 2003 to 900.2 mmt in 2013 and <lb/>accounting for 77.0% of global pig iron production in 2013. Compared with other regions, Asian integrated mills are <lb/>typically more modern and have a larger capacity. The region is expected to continue to lead the capacity expansion in <lb/>the integrated steelmaking route, not least since the figure below indicates a trend towards ever-larger plants in Asia, <lb/>but not in ROW. <lb/>Source: OECD calculations based on data from World Steel Dynamics, China Iron and Steel Association, the Japan Iron and Steel <lb/>Federation and Korea Iron and Steel Association. <lb/>0 <lb/>1000 <lb/>2000 <lb/>3000 <lb/>4000 <lb/>5000 <lb/>6000 <lb/>1980 <lb/>1985 <lb/>1990 <lb/>1995 <lb/>2000 <lb/>2005 <lb/>2010 <lb/>2015 <lb/>2020 <lb/>m3 <lb/>Large-sized blast furnaces (Asia) <lb/>0 <lb/>1000 <lb/>2000 <lb/>3000 <lb/>4000 <lb/>5000 <lb/>6000 <lb/>1980 <lb/>1985 <lb/>1990 <lb/>1995 <lb/>2000 <lb/>2005 <lb/>2010 <lb/>2015 <lb/>2020 <lb/>m3 <lb/>Large-sized blast furnaces (ROW) <lb/></body>

			<body>4.2. Regional steel investments in more detail <lb/>4.2.1. Other Europe <lb/>The EAF route is common in Turkey and the country has one of the highest shares of EAF output in <lb/>the world. However, the BF/BOF route has gained some importance in recent years. 5 Platts (2014b) <lb/>recently reported that the Turkish government plans to reduce the domestic industry&apos;s dependency on scrap <lb/>by providing more incentives for domestic iron ore and ferro-alloy production. This could encourage a <lb/>change in the structure of steel production in favour of BOF based integrated mills. The Turkish industry <lb/>aims to reach 85 mmt of steelmaking capacity and 70 mmt of steel production by 2023 (ISPAT, 2013). <lb/>Major projects taking place in Turkey include: <lb/>• Kardemir (one of Turkey&apos;s three integrated steelmakers) has begun to fire up its new blast <lb/>furnace No. 5 with an inner volume of 1 280 m 3 at its Karabuk works in the northern part of the <lb/>country. As a result, and also due to converter upgrades, its crude steel capacity is expected to <lb/>increase to 3.4 million tpy. Habas has just entered the flat product market in Turkey with a new <lb/>hot strip mill (2.5 million tpy of capacity) and is now building an electric steelmaking complex <lb/>with a capacity of 3 million tpy.<lb/>4.2.2. The Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) <lb/>In the CIS region, numerous mini-mill projects have been planned, reflecting good prospects for the <lb/>construction sector at least before the recent political unrest. However, the BF/BOF route is likely to <lb/>remain the main process in the region. 6 Between 2003 and 2013, the share of crude steel production via the <lb/>EAF route has risen from 13.5% to 24.4%, according to World Steel Association data. The growth in EAFs <lb/>(notably in Russia) should have a significant impact on scrap demand. Scrap demand may surpass <lb/>domestic collection due to new EAFs, though some integrated producers — equipped with both BOFs and <lb/>EAFs — have an option to increase the use of pig iron in their EAFs in order to reduce their dependence on <lb/>scrap (Platts, 2012). Some important developments include the following: <lb/>Russian electric arc furnace steelmaking is expanding and the government expects the share of EAF <lb/>production to reach 39% by 2020 (Platts, 2014c). 7 Between 2013 and 2014, some long product mini-mills <lb/>were commissioned to meet steel demand from the growing construction sector in the country. Abinsk <lb/>Electrometallurgical Plant and NLMK Kaluga commissioned their new EAF melting shops, both with a <lb/>capacity greater than 1 million tpy. Furthermore, Severstal aimed to begin commercial-scale production at <lb/>its 1 million tpy mini-mill in Balakovo (in central Russia&apos;s Saratov region) by the end of the second quarter <lb/>of 2014. <lb/>4.2.3. North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) <lb/>In NAFTA, some steelmakers are exploring opportunities for building DRI-based plants. Several DRI <lb/>plant projects have been announced in recent years to take advantage of shale gas developments. DRI <lb/>provides opportunities for mini-mill steelmakers to minimize the impact of typically more volatile steel <lb/>scrap markets (AMM, 2013). Growing DRI production is also likely to affect demand for substitute <lb/>materials such as pig iron and scrap. EAF&apos;s share of steel production in the NAFTA region is expected to <lb/>rise due to both DRI and scrap-based EAF projects. The upstream (crude) projects that are underway in the <lb/>region include: <lb/>• Some DRI technology suppliers forecast DRI capacity in the United States could reach <lb/>10 million tpy by 2020 (Platts, 2014d and 2014e). On 24 December 2013, Nucor commissioned <lb/>its first DRI facility with a capacity of 2 million tpy in Louisiana. Moreover, the European<lb/></body>

			<body>integrated steelmaker Voestalpine is investing USD 740 million to build a 2 million tpy DRI <lb/>plant in Texas. Also, Big River Steel broke ground on its USD 1.3 billion EAF-based steel mill in <lb/>Osceola, Arkansas on 24 September 2014. <lb/>• In Mexico, some mini-mill projects are underway to meet growing demand from the construction <lb/>sector. For example, Talleres y Aceros (Tyasa) has been testing its new EAF with a capacity of <lb/>1.2 million tpy in Orizaba. In addition to this, Altos Hornos de México (Ahmsa)&apos;s 1.5 million tpy <lb/>EAF, (part of its USD 1.5 billion Fenix program) is expected to be commissioned in 2014. <lb/>Gerdau Corsa&apos;s new EAF plant is expected to come on stream in 2015. <lb/>4.2.4. Latin America <lb/>In Latin America, many greenfield slab-for-export projects have been announced by major mining <lb/>groups. However, some projects have been postponed due to reasons such as the global economic <lb/>slowdown, weak markets and logistical problems. Most of the capacity expansion projects in Latin <lb/>America will occur in Brazil, where some new slab projects are currently in progress. Some projects in the <lb/>region are starting in the long products segment to meet demand for construction steel. Major projects <lb/>occurring in Brazil are provided below. <lb/>• Future slab maker Companhia Siderúrgica do Pecém (CSP) is a joint venture between Brazilian <lb/>mining group Vale (50%) and Korean steel producers Dongkuk Steel (30%) and POSCO (20%). <lb/>The project is expected to begin producing 3 million tpy of slabs in December 2015. CSP&apos;s first <lb/>export shipment is scheduled for March 2016 through the Port of Pecém, in north-eastern Ceará <lb/>State. Apart from this project, another two slab projects — Acos Laminados do Para plant <lb/>(ALPA) and Companhia Siderurgica Ubu (CSU) — have been planned in the country. 8<lb/>4.2.5. Africa <lb/>Currently, Africa is aiming to lower its dependence on imports through various upstream projects. <lb/>Although Egypt and South Africa have played a key role in supplying steel products in Africa, the region <lb/>still has a low self-sufficiency rate. To increase its self-sufficiency and press forward with industrialisation, <lb/>many upstream projects (mainly DRI based mini-mill plants) have been planned. These projects are <lb/>concentrated in North Africa and have the objective of supplying steel for housing and infrastructure <lb/>projects. The DRI-EAF route has been the preferred steelmaking technology in the region due to its lower <lb/>capital expenditure requirements and because the region has a shortage of steel scrap. 9 Projects taking <lb/>place in some of the major producing countries in Africa include: <lb/>• Many DRI-EAF projects are underway in Egypt. However, the country is experiencing a shortage <lb/>in natural gas allocation, which has delayed the launch of a number of steelworks. 10  Ezz Steel, the <lb/>largest steel producer in Egypt and North Africa, is expected to commission its 1.8 million tpy <lb/>DRI plant and a 850 000 tpy EAF by end-2014. Moreover, Beshay Steel, the second largest <lb/>steelmaker in Egypt, is building a 1.76 million tpy DRI and 1.3 million tpy EAF. Egyptian Steel <lb/> is building an EAF-based steelworks in Beni Suef and Sokhna that will each have a capacity of <lb/>850 000 tpy of square billet. <lb/> • Algeria is one of the fastest steel-consuming markets in Africa due to government plans to build <lb/>infrastructure facilities (OECD, 2014). With domestic steelmakers not producing enough to meet <lb/>growing demand for steel, the government announced in mid-2011 that it would invest <lb/>considerable amounts over five years to boost domestic steel production (Oxford Business Group, <lb/>2012). Most of the capacity additions will be implemented by state-owned companies. For <lb/>example, the governments of Qatar and Algeria have decided to enter into a joint venture, the<lb/></body>

			<page>14 <lb/></page>

			<body>Algerian Qatari Solb Company. Moreover, state-owned Sider and ArcelorMittal aim to boost <lb/>capacity at their Annaba plant. <lb/>• In South Africa, ArcelorMittal South Africa is a major producer, accounting for more than 70% <lb/>of the country&apos;s steel production (Kumba Iron Ore, 2011). However, large scale steel plant <lb/>projects have been announced in the country recently. China&apos;s state-owned Hebei Iron &amp; Steel <lb/>(Hegang) announced plans to build a 5 million tpy greenfield steelworks to be supplied by output <lb/>from its iron ore mine in the country. 11 On 10 September 2014, Hegang signed a memorandum of <lb/>understanding with China-Africa Development Fund and the South African government&apos;s <lb/>Industrial Development Corp. for developing Hegang&apos;s steelworks project in South Africa. This <lb/>steel plant will be China&apos;s largest steel mill outside the Chinese mainland (WSJ, 2014). <lb/>4.2.6. Middle East <lb/>With oil-exporting countries within the Gulf Cooperation Council aiming to diversify their economies <lb/>(IMF, 2014), steel demand from downstream industries is expected to expand in the region. Many projects <lb/>have been announced recently in the Middle East, often with the objective to reduce import dependency. 12 <lb/>However, these developments have led to concerns that the industry&apos;s expansion might lead to over-supply <lb/>issues in the region, particularly in the square billet market (Metal Expert, 2014a). Steelmaking is <lb/>predominantly EAF-based, and the preferred feedstock is DRI, owing to plentiful (and thus relatively low <lb/>priced) natural gas availability in the region. 13 DRI is generally expected to remain a major feedstock in <lb/>EAF steelmaking, and the EAF process, in turn, is expected to continue to play a dominant role in <lb/>steelmaking route in the region. Major projects taking place in the Middle East include: <lb/>Iran aims to expand its steelmaking capacity to 55 million tpy by 2025 (Reuters, 2014). Most new <lb/>plants will be based on the DRI-EAF route. The country has significant resources of iron ore deposits and <lb/>low-cost natural gas, and these factors are affecting the choice of raw materials used to produce steel in <lb/>Iran. Although eight new steelworks have been under construction by state-owned IMIDRO since 2006, <lb/>and numerous projects have been announced, a number of projects were put on hold because of financing <lb/>constraints caused by economic sanctions. 14 Currently, Middle East Mines Industries Development Holding <lb/>Company (MIDHCO) is involved in three greenfield projects in the country: Butia Steel Company (BISCO), <lb/>Sirjan Iranian Steel Company (SISCO) and Zarand Iron &amp; Steel Company (ZISCO). <lb/>In Oman, growing steel demand (driven by construction activity) is encouraging domestic producers <lb/>to increase their capacities and is attracting new investors to the steel industry. Scrap consumption is <lb/>expected to grow due to capacity expansion projects, while some companies plan to install DRI modules <lb/>because domestic scrap collectors may not be able to supply enough material for several years (Metal <lb/>Expert, 2014b). An example of capacity expansion projects can be found in Jindal Shadeed Iron and <lb/>Steel&apos;s project, which involves a 2 million tpy EAF steelmaking complex, including a DRI module. Sun <lb/>Metals and Moon Iron &amp; Steel (MISCO) also plan to install EAF facilities. <lb/>Saudi Arabia is currently experiencing fast-growing demand for electricity driven by population <lb/>growth and industrial development (NOREF, 2013). Although a shortage in natural gas allocation and <lb/>electricity generation capacity has delayed the launch of a number of steelworks in the country, many EAF <lb/>projects are currently underway to balance billet imports. 15 For example, Saudi Iron &amp; Steel Company, the <lb/>largest integrated steelmaker in the Middle East, started trial runs at its sixth electric arc furnace of <lb/>1 million tpy in February 2014. Also, Arkan Steel and Al Atoun Steel are building EAF-based plants. <lb/>4.2.7. China <lb/>Currently, the Chinese government is making efforts to restructure the steel industry, increase its <lb/>efficiency and remove some excess capacity (EY, 2014). In October 2013, China&apos;s State Council released <lb/></body>

			<body>a Guideline (the Guideline to Resolve Serious Overcapacity), targeting the closure of 80 million tpy of <lb/>steel capacity by the end of 2017 (OECD, 2014), in addition to addressing overcapacity problems in the <lb/>cement, aluminium, plate glass and shipbuilding industries. Targets of the plan include reasonable capacity <lb/>utilisation, improved industrial concentration and structure, higher development quality, efficient <lb/>environmental protection, a normal level of profit margin and asset-liability ratio, and a long-term effective <lb/>mechanism in self-regulating capacity. <lb/>The Guideline to Resolve Serious Overcapacity includes supply-side management measures, notably <lb/>the prohibition of new steel projects, the removal of existing illegal capacity, the enhancement of the entry <lb/>threshold, and phasing out the backward capacity by raising prices of power and water. Financial support <lb/>could be provided if difficulties linked to capacity shutdowns and unemployment arise. In addition, broad <lb/>demand side measures as well as systematic management measures will also be used to address <lb/>overcapacity. On the demand side, efforts will involve the construction sector&apos;s use of steel and improving <lb/>the standards of steel. Systematic management includes encouraging mergers and acquisitions of <lb/>enterprises to increase industrial concentration and reduce over-competition, among other efforts. <lb/>Since July 2014, China&apos;s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) has revealed lists <lb/>of steelmakers that should remove obsolete capacities. 16 Also, provincial governments were requested to <lb/>submit, by 30 June 2015, their targets for dismantling outdated and excess capacities in 2015 and during <lb/>the 13 th five-year (2016-2020) economic development plan (MIIT, 2014). 17 <lb/>Some important coastal steelworks have been put into operation over the last few years in China: <lb/>Anshan Iron &amp; Steel commissioned its 6.5 million tpy Bayuquan works in Liaoning Province in 2008, <lb/>while Shougang Jingtang United Iron &amp; Steel completed its 9.7 million tpy works in Hebei Province in <lb/>2010. Many projects have been announced in resource-rich inland regions. For example, Xinjiang&apos;s rich <lb/>raw material resources have attracted many steelmakers to invest in new capacities in the region. 18 <lb/>Although the BOF production process will remain the dominant production process in China in the years to <lb/>come, the EAF share may increase gradually along with increasing availability of domestic scrap, but the <lb/>process is likely to take some time (Japan Metal Bulletin, 2014). 19 Despite a slowdown in China&apos;s capacity <lb/>growth rate compared to previous years, large steelworks that focus on the production of flat products are <lb/>being built in the country, namely: <lb/>Baosteel could commission the first of two 5 050 m 3 blast furnaces at its Zhanjiang steelworks <lb/>(Guangdong Province) by the end of September in 2015. The entire steelworks is expected to be <lb/>commissioned by June 2016. 20 On 26 September 2014, Wuhan Iron &amp; Steel Group set up the <lb/>Fangchenggang Steel Company Limited that would be responsible for the operations management of its <lb/>steel project in Guangxi Province. The new integrated steelworks is designed to be able to produce <lb/>9.2 million tpy of crude steel with two 5 200 m 3 blast furnaces. Shandong Iron and Steel Group plans to <lb/>launch its 8.5 million tpy Rizhao steelworks in Shandong Province by the end of 2016, with two 5 100 m 3 <lb/>blast furnaces. <lb/>• Other important projects are either underway or being planned. In China&apos;s Inner Mongolia, <lb/> Baotou Iron &amp; Steel plans to build two 4 000 m 3 blast furnaces at a new integrated flat steel <lb/>works, which will have a crude steel capacity of 5 million tpy. Also, on 4 July 2014, a <lb/>memorandum of understanding for a total investment of USD 3.3 billion was officially signed <lb/>between Chongqing Iron &amp; Steel (Chonggang) and POSCO. The two companies will cooperate <lb/>to construct a plant using POSCO&apos;s FINEX technology.<lb/></body>

			<body>4.2.8. India <lb/>Based on forecasts for steel consumption, India&apos;s authorities expect that steelmaking capacity may <lb/>have to increase to 300 million tpy by 2025-26 in order to meet future demand (Government of India, <lb/>Ministry of Steel, 2013). In order to reach that level of capacity, the industry may need to invest around <lb/>12 trillion rupees, according to some news sources, with investment being concentrated in the mineral-rich <lb/>states of Odisha and Jharkhand (Platts, 2014i). New investment projects that are iron ore/coking coal <lb/>intensive should have significant impacts on the balance between BOF and EAF production in the future. <lb/>Despite the declining trend over the last 10 years, BOF&apos;s share in Indian production is expected to grow <lb/>significantly as many BF/BOF projects have been announced or are currently being built in the country. 21 <lb/>Many important BF/BOF projects are taking place in India, amongst which: <lb/>• Some upstream projects are underway by state-owned companies that have already launched their <lb/>strategic plans. 22  National Mineral Development Corp (NMDC) has delayed commissioning of its <lb/>3 million tpy integrated steel plant with a 4 506 m 3 blast furnace, currently under construction at <lb/>Nagarnar in the eastern state of Chhattisgarh. Steel Authority of India Ltd. (SAIL) is also building <lb/>two blast furnaces with inner volumes of 4 060 m 3 at IISCO Burnpur works and Bhilai works. <lb/>Also, India&apos;s leading private company, Tata Steel, expects to commission the first phase of its <lb/>3 million tpy integrated mill by March 2015, including a 4 300 m 3 blast furnace.<lb/>4.2.9. Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) <lb/>Although the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) has traditionally been a large net <lb/>importer of steel, a steel mill construction boom has been taking place in the region, as well as in other <lb/>East Asian economies that export to ASEAN. 23 Many steel projects should support the increase in <lb/>ASEAN&apos;s self-sufficiency rate. However, these developments have led to concerns that the industry&apos;s <lb/>expansion might lead to over-supply problems (OECD, 2013a). DRI and scrap have been the major <lb/>feedstock for steel production in the region because production takes place primarily in EAF-based <lb/>facilities. However, BOF&apos;s share in the region&apos;s production is expected to increase gradually, thus affecting <lb/>the balance of steelmaking technologies and, ultimately, raw material demand. Below is a brief summary <lb/>of the major projects taking place in ASEAN. <lb/>• In Indonesia, investment in new steelmaking capacity is taking place in view of relatively <lb/>favourable demand prospects. Examples of investment projects include PT Krakatau POSCO, <lb/> which formally began operating its first blast furnace (the size of which is 3 950 m 3 ) on <lb/>23 December 2013 in Cilegon. The plant has a capacity of 3 million tpy. This project is part of <lb/>Indonesia&apos;s Master Plan to accelerate economic development (OECD, 2013b). PT Krakatau <lb/>POSCO will make a decision on whether to proceed with the second stage expansion in 2015. <lb/>Moreover, PT Gunung Raja Paksi is building a 2 500 m 3 blast furnace with a capacity of <lb/>1.5 million tpy in West Java, along with a sinter plant and a coke battery. <lb/> • In Viet Nam, strong steel demand growth has attracted many foreign investors and numerous <lb/>projects have been planned. According to the government of Viet Nam, capacity is targeted to <lb/>reach 40 million tpy of steel billets by 2025 (Ministry of Industry and Trade of Vietnam, 2013). <lb/>Currently, some BF-BOF projects are underway in the country. For example, Formosa Ha Tinh <lb/>Steel Corp has already started construction, with the first phase of a 10.5 million tpy plant to be <lb/>fully commissioned by end-May 2017. 24 In addition, state-owned Vietnam Steel Corporation <lb/>(VSC) has commissioned its new steel plant. Also, POSCO Specialty Steel aims to officially <lb/>inaugurate its 1 million tpy EAF in Ba Ria-Vung Tau province either in December 2014 or <lb/>slightly thereafter. 25<lb/></body>

			<body>5. Concluding remarks <lb/>Excessive levels of steelmaking capacity have important implications for the steel industry, often <lb/>associated with over-supply, low prices, weak profitability, bankruptcies and localised job losses. <lb/>Recent work conducted by the OECD has examined the financial health of the steel industry and <lb/>established a link between excess capacity and profitability. It has shown that the financial performance <lb/>of the industry is perhaps worse now than it was during the global steel crisis of the late 1990s, in large <lb/>part due to the significant excess capacity that exists today. <lb/>Given the global nature of the industry, excess capacity in one region can displace production in <lb/>other regions, thus harming producers in those markets and creating risks for trade actions and <lb/>government interventions to protect domestic industries. It can also lead to wasteful energy use and thus <lb/>have negative environmental impacts. <lb/>Increased trade frictions are already visible amongst trading partners today. Subsidies and <lb/>government support measures that promote investment in steelmaking facilities or sustain companies in <lb/>distress that would otherwise shut down are a major source of this trade friction. Subsidies that <lb/>encourage steelmakers to keep production running at high levels, even under weak market conditions, <lb/>have had significant effects on trade, with unfair trade practices such as dumping having resulted in <lb/>injury to the industries of other economies. <lb/>In competitive economies, it is the responsibility of the steel companies themselves to identify <lb/>ways to adapt to changing market conditions. That is, businesses are best placed to decide on when to <lb/>invest in new capacity or when to scale it back when market conditions change. The role of <lb/>governments should be to allow market mechanisms to work properly and avoid measures that <lb/>artificially support steelmaking capacity. <lb/>A key priority, therefore, is to identify appropriate policy approaches to address excess capacity. In <lb/>this context, of particular importance for governments will be to work towards removing market <lb/>distorting policies such as subsidies that promote the emergence of new capacity or delay the closure of <lb/>failing companies, eliminating trade and investment barriers that slow the restructuring that is needed <lb/>for the industry, allowing market-based investment decisions in the steel sector, and ensuring that new <lb/>plants are subject to standards that protect the environment and uphold worker safety. <lb/>The OECD Steel Committee has continued to deepen its discussions on capacity, and plans to take <lb/>this work further in its programme of work and budget for 2015-2016. For example, the Committee&apos;s <lb/>programme of work calls for analyses of government policies and their implications for global excess <lb/>capacity developments, as well as maintaining a database of ongoing investment projects, including the <lb/>sources of finance for steel projects and any government support measures provided. At a later stage, the <lb/>Committee may consider organising a high-level meeting to facilitate discussion on excess capacity <lb/>issues at a higher political level. A key aim of this work will be to establish common perspectives on <lb/>ways to avoid practices that create harmful trade and competitive distortions, and which can lead to a <lb/>long-lasting positive impact on the effective functioning of the global steel market. <lb/></body>

			<body>NOTES <lb/>1. <lb/>An important item discussed at the OECD Ministerial Council Meeting (MCM), which was held in <lb/>May 2014 and chaired by Japan, was about resilient economies and societies. The MCM Chair&apos;s Summary <lb/>made specific reference to steel: &quot; Ministers also discussed positive shifts in employment and production <lb/>patterns, the future of manufacturing as well as entrepreneurship, including the role of young firms and <lb/>SMEs, and stressed the need to address the issue of excess capacity in some global industries, such as steel, <lb/>in relation to supporting measures. &quot; <lb/>2. <lb/>Readers who identify changes in project characteristics are encouraged to contact the Secretariat. <lb/>3. <lb/>This comprises Albania, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Croatia, Macedonia, Montenegro, Norway, Serbia, <lb/>Switzerland, and Turkey. <lb/>4. <lb/>Recent reports suggest that China&apos;s actual crude steelmaking capacity could be higher than estimated. A <lb/>Platts (2014a) report notes that Chinese capacity reached 1.11 billion tpy in 2013 and will increase to <lb/>1.14 billion tpy in 2014, according to China Iron and Steel Association. <lb/>5. <lb/>For example, Isdemir blew-in its No. 4 blast furnace with an inner volume of 2 500 m 3 in 2011. In 2013, <lb/>scrap imports decreased by 12.0% to 19.7 mmt compared with 2012, while iron ore imports were up by 3.5% <lb/>to 8.1 mmt, according to data from the World Steel Association. <lb/>6. <lb/>According to the World Steel Association data, the share of BOF in the CIS region has grown to 67.7% in <lb/>2013, i.e. by 10 percentage points from its level 10 years earlier. <lb/>7. <lb/>The Russian steel industry is aiming to replace all of its OHF facilities by 2015 (Russian Steel Consortium, <lb/>2013). Ukraine expects to complete the replacement of its OHF technology by 2018 (SE UEX, 2014). <lb/>8. <lb/>These projects do not seem however to be progressing as expected. <lb/>9. <lb/>The BOF to EAF ratio in South Africa is high (59:41), according to the World Steel Association data. This <lb/>reflects the important role of iron ore and coking coal in the country. <lb/>10. <lb/>Egypt has decided to remove natural gas subsidies, and some observers expect the price of gas used by <lb/>cement, iron and durable good factories to increase by 30-75% (Al-Monitor, 2014). This measure will <lb/>affect those steelmakers operating DRI modules that use natural gas. Observers have noted that scrap <lb/>imports could increase due to natural gas shortage (Platts, 2013a). <lb/>11. <lb/>Hegang already owns iron-ore mining assets in South Africa, having participated in a consortium <lb/>established to buy Rio Tinto&apos;s 57.7% interest in Palabora Mining Company (Creamer Media, 2014). <lb/>12. <lb/>Observers have noted, however, that the fast growth in power consumption may curb future capacity <lb/>growth (Markaz, 2013). <lb/>13. <lb/>According to data from the World Steel Association, the region&apos;s share of crude steel production via the <lb/>EAF route has risen significantly to 92.4% in 2013 (9.3 percentage points higher than 10 years earlier). <lb/></body>

See Platts (2014f) for more <lb/>on this. <lb/>15 . <lb/>Saudi Arabia&apos;s government aims to boost power-generation capacity by more than 50% from less than <lb/>60 gigawatts (GW) to approximately 91 GW by 2020 (ABB, 2014). <lb/>16 . <lb/>In July 2014, MIIT announced the first list of steelmakers that should remove obsolete capacities in 2014, <lb/>including iron and steel and a total of 25.45 million tpy of ironmaking capacities and 22.60 million tpy of <lb/>steelmaking capacities should be removed by end-2014. Furthermore, MIIT released the second list on <lb/>18 August 2014 and the third list on 25 August 2014. <lb/>17 . <lb/>This information is available at: http://cys.miit.gov.cn/n11293472/n11295023/n11297848/16159494.html <lb/>18. <lb/>Observers have noted that the central government&apos;s keenness to develop western China&apos;s economy caused <lb/>a rush of new steel projects in Xinjiang, which may lead to oversupply (Platts, 2013b). <lb/>19. <lb/>China Iron and Steel Association (CISA) expects EAF output will be 25-30% of the total crude steel <lb/>production by 2025 (Platts, 2014g). <lb/>20. <lb/>The Guangdong Provincial Development &amp; Reform Commission decided to remove 4.5 million tpy of <lb/>crude steel capacity in the province by 2017, in order to make room for the Zhanjiang steelworks (Platts, <lb/>2014h). <lb/>21. <lb/>India has faced several barriers to capacity expansions. For example, the acquisition of land, the granting of <lb/>environmental and forest clearances, the availability of raw materials and the lack of infrastructure are <lb/>major challenges (OECD, 2014). <lb/>22. <lb/>SAIL aims to increase its steelmaking capacity to 50 million tpy by 2025. On the other hand, RINL plans <lb/>to expand capacity of its Visakhapatnam steelworks to 12 million tpy by 2020. <lb/>23. <lb/>For example, in East Asian economies, operations at large-scale blast furnaces were started in both Korea <lb/>and Chinese Taipei in 2013. <lb/>24. <lb/>The commissioning of the No. 1 blast furnace with an inner volume of 4 350 m 3 is expected to be delayed <lb/>until November 2015 due to the protests which occurred in May 2014. When fully implemented by 2020, <lb/>this steelworks will be the largest integrated steel plant in the ASEAN region (OECD, 2013a). <lb/>25 <lb/>Ferrous scrap imports have been increasing, notably in Viet Nam, while Australia has become a major <lb/>scrap exporter to ASEAN. <lb/></body>
