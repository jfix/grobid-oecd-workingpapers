By<lb/> then the share of electric road vehicles and plug-in electric hybrid cars may also be<lb/> substantial.<lb/> The electricity used by trains, and in the future by a growing number of cars, is marginally<lb/> produced in coal-fired power plants, and in most countries such plants dominate the grid.<lb/> Some power plants still emit huge quantities of sulphur and NO x . Several European power<lb/> plants, most of them located in Eastern Europe currently emit more than 100,000 tons of SO 2<lb/> at thermal capacities ranging from 800 to 12,000 MW, and a number of plants, most of them<lb/> British, emit more than 20,000 tons of NO x per year (Entec, 2008).

Kageson — Discussion Paper 2009-28 — © OECD/ITF, 2009<lb/> 9<lb/> The energy needed for accelerating up to speed is defined by the weight (mass) of the train<lb/> and the speed.

The companies will make use of new or improved technologies as well as<lb/> &quot; Eco-driving &quot; , active traffic management and efficient timetabling (UIC, 2008b).<lb/> Some railway companies have already achieved reductions of this magnitude. In the UK the<lb/> specific primary energy consumption in passenger rail transport fell by 25 per cent between<lb/> 1995 and 2006, and Deutsche Bahn reports reductions by one third between 1990 and 2007<lb/> for both freight and regional passenger traffic (UIC and CER, 2008).

These targets are to be reached in 2020. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) is much less optimistic but believes that<lb/> it should be possible to reach 1.5 per cent average annual improvement in fuel efficiency to<lb/> 2020. 5 The difference between ACARE and IATA can probably be explained, at least<lb/> partially, by ACARE&apos;s focus on new technologies. IATA&apos;s target appears to concern fleet<lb/> averages.<lb/> Based on Easyjet&apos;s Corporate Responsibility Report 2006, ATOC (2009) estimates that flying<lb/> a new Airbus A319 causes CO 2 emissions of about 115 g per seat km for a 300 km flight and<lb/> 85 g for a flight twice that long.

Assuming a 70 per cent load factor, the latter means 0.021 liter per seat km.<lb/> However, these figures are for long flights.

This corresponds to 0.025 liters per seat km and<lb/> is the value that will be used in this report.
