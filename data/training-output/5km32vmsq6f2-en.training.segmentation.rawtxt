exerts significant control over money market interest rates. With money market conditions increasingly 
influencing effective commercial lending rates, the PBoC is also able to affect the cost of credit without 
recourse to its benchmark commercial bank rates. Furthermore, interest rates are an important determinant 
of investment spending in China, via the user cost of capital, and aggregate economic activity influences 
inflation. Hence, greater use of interest rates in implementing monetary policy would enhance 
macroeconomic stabilisation while avoiding a number of drawbacks of the current quantity-based 
approach. In addition, increased flexibility in the exchange rate would enhance its role in offsetting 
macroeconomic shocks and allow the PBoC more scope to tailor monetary policy to domestic 
macroeconomic conditions. Concurrently, changes in the PBoC's policy stance should be predicated on 
informed judgments based on the monitoring of a set of indicators in conjunction with a flexible inflation 
objective as the nominal anchor. This paper relates to the 2010 OECD Economic Review of China 
(www.oecd.org/eco/surveys/china).

(BPdC) contrôle désormais de façon significative les taux d'intérêt du marché monétaire. Les conditions du 
marché monétaire influençant de plus en plus les taux effectifs des prêts commerciaux, la BPdC est 
également en mesure d'influencer le coût du crédit sans recourir à ses taux d'intérêt commerciaux de

coût du capital, et l'activité exerce une influence sur l'inflation. Par conséquent, une utilisation plus active 
des taux d'intérêt dans la conduite de la politique monétaire contribuerait à la stabilisation 
macroéconomique tout en évitant certains des inconvénients de l'approche actuelle par les quantités. En 
outre, une plus grande flexibilité du taux de change renforcerait son rôle dans l'amortissement des chocs 
macroéconomiques et donnerait une plus grande latitude à la BPdC pour ajuster la politique monétaire en 
fonction des conditions macroéconomiques internes. Dans le même temps, les changements de politique 
monétaire devraient résulter d'une évaluation empirique basée sur le suivi d'une série d'indicateurs dans le

4 ECO/WKP(2010)78 Reforming China's monetary policy framework to meet domestic objectives By Paul Conway, Richard Herd and Thomas Chalaux 1 Introduction and conclusions The People's Bank of China (PBoC) began to function exclusively as a central bank in 1984. Since 
then, much progress has been made in improving the conduct of monetary policy. China's monetary policy 
framework has gradually moved away from a planned administrative system resting on credit rationing to a 
more market-based regime with money growth as the main intermediate target. As part of this transition, 
interest rates have been liberalised, making them more responsive to market signals, and the tools of 
monetary policy have been modernised. The banking sector has also undergone significant reform (see 
Chapter 3 in OECD, 2010) and the economy has become far more responsive to market-based policy 
measures. Officially, the objective of Chinese monetary policy is  " to maintain the stability of the value of the 
currency and thereby promote economic growth " . 2 It is not clear whether this refers to maintaining the 
domestic purchasing power of the currency -i.e., the price level -or the exchange rate. In practice, the 
State Council has also charged the PBoC with achieving price stability, employment growth, external 
balance, and financial stability. 3 The PBoC is further responsible for promoting financial sector 
liberalisation. The central bank is not independent and needs the permission of the State Council to change 
policy settings. The 11 th Plan called for interest rate liberalisation and improvement in the transmission mechanism of 
monetary policy. From this perspective, this paper evaluates China's monetary policy framework and 
suggests ways in which it could be strengthened. It begins by reviewing the targets and instruments used 
by the PBoC to influence money market conditions (Section 2). As outlined in Section 3, as a result of a 
number of factors, including ongoing interest rate reform and a stronger banking sector, China's money 
market is becoming more integrated with different market segments increasingly linked via arbitrage. The 1.

According to Governor Zhou Xiaochuan, as cited in Liu and Zhang (2007). 
5 ECO/WKP(2010)78 PBoC now has considerable control over short-term interest rates in the interbank market and increasing 
leverage over longer-term rates through the term structure. Going forward, the monetary policy framework 
needs to place less emphasis on quantity-based liquidity controls and more on interest rate changes. The 
PBoC's benchmark commercial bank lending and deposit rates, which do not influence economic activity 
and are becoming increasingly irrelevant in the conduct of monetary policy, ought to be progressively 
phased out. In Section 4, the paper goes on to review the effects of monetary policy on the real side of the 
economy and presents evidence on the effects of interest rate changes on economic activity. In particular, 
capital formation at the firm level is shown to be sensitive to changes in interest rates via the user cost of 
capital. In addition, the results of estimating a Phillips curve for China, which are presented in Section 5, 
show that changes in aggregate demand pressures influence inflation. This implies that the transmission 
mechanism is effective in China and that monetary policy can enhance stability by playing a greater role as 
a macroeconomic shock absorber. However, as discussed in Section 6, the current exchange rate regime 
limits the policy options available to the PBoC and the effectiveness of monetary policy more generally 
and prevents the value of the currency from moving to offset macro shocks. Finally, Section 7 argues the 
case for allowing greater exchange rate flexibility and moving towards a flexible inflation objective as the 
nominal anchor. This would permit monetary policy to make a greater contribution to macroeconomic 
stability and reduce the costs and risks of sterilising foreign reserve inflows. The modus operandi of the PBoC China's monetary policy framework has evolved considerably since the mid-1980s. From 1984 until 
1997, the PBoC issued base money and implemented monetary policy under a system of central bank 
lending and credit controls. The PBoC provided liquidity to state-owned banks, which then lent money to 
state-owned enterprises (SOEs), often at negative real interest rates. Since the establishment of the 
development banks in 1994, central bank lending has mainly been used to subsidise rural credit 
cooperatives or rescue insolvent financial institutions and no longer as a means of influencing monetary 
conditions. More recently, money growth has replaced credit rationing as the main intermediate target of 
monetary policy. The PBoC sets targets for the year-on-year growth rates of the money supply and bank 
credit that are deemed to be consistent with its policy objectives. Over the course of the year, the PBoC 
adjusts policy settings in line with developments in intermediate targets and other macroeconomic 
variables. In practice, notwithstanding instability in the money multiplier and unpredictable liquidity 
growth given the current exchange rate regime, the PBoC has been reasonably proficient at hitting its 
money supply and bank credit targets (Table 1). In 2009, however, the full-year target for M2 growth was 
reached by end-March as liquidity was dramatically increased in response to the global economic 
recession. GDP growth targets have often been exceeded, particularly in recent years, whereas inflation 
targets have been both over-and undershot.

8 Source: PBoC and CEIC. The PBoC has a number of instruments at its disposal to achieve its money supply and credit growth 
targets. Open market operations (OMOs) and changes in the required reserves of the commercial banks 
have become the predominant tools with which the PBoC influences base money and money market 
conditions more generally. The PBoC conducts OMOs using repos and central bank bills. Periodic changes 
in reserve requirements have also become an important tool, mainly used in recent years to sterilise foreign 
reserve inflows. As well as using quantity-based tools to control liquidity, the PBoC controls a range of interest rates 
in the economy to varying degrees. The PBoC sets benchmark interest rates for commercial bank lending 
and deposits across a range of maturities. It also sets interest rates on refinancing credit extended to the 
banking system, the rediscount rate, and rates paid on the required and excess reserves of the commercial 
banks deposited at the central bank. The yields on PBoC bills, which are used in OMOs to sterilise foreign 
currency inflows, are also under the influence of the central bank. In comparison to OMOs and required 
reserves, policy interest rates play a secondary role in monetary policy implementation and the PBoC 
changes them less frequently and typically by a smaller amount than central banks elsewhere 
(Anderson, 2007). As well as quantity-based and, to a lesser extent, price-based instruments, the PBoC still uses a form 
of administrative guidance to influence bank lending. Since bank-specific credit ceilings were removed in 
1998, the PBoC has held monthly meetings with commercial banks to outline its concerns about credit 
conditions across sectors. The practice has since become institutionalised with the PBoC publishing notices 
aimed at curbing lending in particular sectors from time to time. The PBoC also regularly reports on its 
 " window guidance "  in its Quarterly Monetary Policy Reports. Administrative guidance has been 
instrumental in slowing credit growth during periods of rapid expansion, such as in the early 2000s, and 
increasing it more recently in response to the global recession. According to Geiger (2006), window 
guidance can be effective because the governor of the PBoC ranks above officials in charge of the 
commercial banks in the Chinese political hierarchy. 
7 ECO/WKP(2010)78 Financial markets and interest rates 
The interbank market for bonds started operating in 1997 and has since developed quickly (Figure 1). 
As discussed in OECD (2010), the rapid growth in China's bond market has been facilitated by financial 
sector liberalisation and the market infrastructure for borrowing and lending reserves among banks is now 
well established. Although issued bonds have typically been short-term, bonds of longer maturities are 
being increasingly offered and turnover and liquidity have grown rapidly. For most of the past decade, relatively few government bonds have been issued and offerings by the 
PBoC have dominated the market. Until 2004, the corporate paper market was undeveloped as a result of 
restrictive regulations set by the National Development Reform Commission. Subsequently, the PBoC 
opened a corporate commercial paper market and, from 2007, allowed medium-term corporate notes to be 
traded in the same market. As a result, between end 2007 and end 2009, the outstanding stock of 
commercial paper and bonds issued by the non-financial corporate sector and local governments more than 
tripled. Net sales amounted to 4% of GDP in 2009. Local authorities and their corporate affiliates (used to 
finance infrastructure projects) were particularly active, raising 1.2% of GDP in 2009. In the first three 
quarters of 2010, borrowing by the non-financial sector and local governments eased back, but still 
amounted to 2.6% of GDP, bringing the outstanding stock of debt to 9% of annual GDP. Despite this 
recent progress, however, the outstanding stock of bonds is still relatively small both compared with other 
countries and relative to the size of bank lending. Figure 1. Annual change in the outstanding stock of bonds, bills and notes -8 -6 -4 -2 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 -8 -6 -4 -2 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 2001

China Investment Corporation. Source: Chinabond and CFIC. There are a variety of different money markets in China. The market for uncollaterised loans, which 
are traded between banks, is not large and around 90% of the short-term money market turnover takes 
place in the repurchase market, using bonds as collateral. Within the repo market, loans are traded both on 
the stock exchanges and between banks, with the latter market dominating. In the interbank repo market, 
trading is dominated by the 7-day maturity, which accounts for nearly 80% of the total turnover. At longer 
maturities, market depth is limited. 
8 ECO/WKP(2010)78 Three types of interest rates are available in the short-term market: i) the CHIBOR, which refers to a weighted average of actual transaction rates on the uncollateralised 
interbank market; ii) the SHIBOR, available since January 2007, which represents the daily average of the quotes of 
16 banks at 11.30 in the morning. This rate has the advantage of offering a price even when there are no 
market transactions. Its disadvantage is that the banks are not obliged to trade at their quoted rates. The 
objective of the SHIBOR was to generate a well-determined interest rate index that be used as the basis for 
derivative products. iii) In January 2008, an interest rate swap market was introduced using the SHIBOR as a base. 
However, turnover in this market has remained very limited and by September 2010 transactions in the 
interbank swap market were only 1.4% of the transactions in the cash and secured interbank bank market. The flows in the interbank market are not the result of random fluctuations in the liquidity of a large 
number of institutions but rather stem from the major four banks, accounting for over 70% of deposits, 
having a structural surplus of deposits and consistently supplying money to the interbank market where it 
is lent to other financial institutions. The relative importance of the different borrowers in the market varies 
from year to year. The depth of the market is restricted by regulations limiting foreign banks to borrowing 
only 1.5 times their capital in the interbank market. Market interest rates, including interbank rates, bill discounting rates and bond yields are fully 
liberalised and move flexibly to clear markets for borrowing and lending reserves. 4 However in the 
corporate bill market, introduced in 2005 by the Central Bank, an association of underwriters the National 
Association of Financial Market Institutional Investors -sets the minimum rate at which new issues can be 
made. Sometimes this rate deviates from the rate in the secondary market, effectively closing the new 
issues market. The influence of the PBoC on the interbank market In April 2003, the PBoC converted all existing repurchase agreements into Central Bank bills to 
create a new instrument for intervening in money markets. Since then, a relatively deep and liquid market 
has developed. The central bank uses PBoC bills of various maturities to conduct open market operations 
(OMOs) aimed at achieving its liquidity targets. In 2004, the PBoC introduced a range of innovations to 
improve the effectiveness of its OMOs, including the introduction of a one and three-year tenors. In 
addition, the PBoC increased the frequency of its OMOs auctions, extended the length of the trading period 
and linked the bill trading system with the payment system so that settlement can be done on a payment-
on-delivery basis. Consistent with the PBoC's reliance on quantity-based measures for implementing 
monetary policy, bill auctions are usually conducted as fixed-quantity tenders with a variable interest rate, 
although fixed-interest-rate auctions have been used as well from time to time. There is also an active repo 
market that the PBoC can use to manage the supply of reserves, although in practice it has not used it 
much. 4. 
The Third Plenary Session of the 14 th Communist Party Central Committee set out the broad direction of 
interest rate liberalisation in November 1993. In 2002, the 16 th National Congress reiterated the call for 
interest rate reform with the aim of improving the efficiency with which financial resources are allocated. 
In 2003, the Third Plenary Session of the 16 th Central Committee called for market-determined interest 
rates steered by the PBoC consistent with economic objectives. 
9 ECO/WKP(2010)78 The PBoC has considerable leverage over short-term money market interest rates. By setting the 
interest rate it pays on excess reserves, the PBoC effectively imposes a floor in the interbank market. In 
principle, the PBoC's base or benchmark rate, at which it lends to banks and other financial institutions, 
should impose a ceiling. In practice, however, the PBoC does not issue loans at this rate and there has been 
no lending through the base lending window since 2001. As a result, money market rates occasionally 
spike above the base lending rate when liquidity is short, notably when there have been large IPOs in the 
stock market. Until the onset of the global financial crisis, the PBoC had progressively increased the spread 
between the interest rate on excess reserves and base lending to encourage banks to trade amongst 
themselves in the interbank market (Figure 2). Figure 2. Short-term money-market interest rates 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 Jul-97 Jul-98 Jul-99 Jul-00 Jul-01 Jul-02 Jul-03 Jul-04 Jul-05 Jul-06 Jul-07 Jul-08 Jul-09 % pa

Central bank loans Source: CEIC. The market interest rates under the control of the PBoC have started to have a stronger influence on 
rates in the interbank market. Both rolling correlations and regressions with time-varying coefficients 
(Box 1) indicate that the pass-through of changes in three-month PBoC bill rates to interbank repo rates of 
the same maturity has increased over recent years (Figure 3). The strong influence of the PBoC bill rate on 
the repo rate (both with three month maturities) is also confirmed by regression of the repo rate on the 
PBoC bill rate and the lagged repo rate (Table 2). Although these correlations are not as strong as in OECD 
countries, where central banks stand ready to lend or borrow at the policy interest rate, PBoC control over 
interbank interest rates is becoming increasingly significant. However, the repo rate is much more volatile 
than the PBoC bill rate, which may reflect the quantity oriented operating structure of monetary policy that 
results in interest rate spikes in response to large IPOs (Porter and Xu, 2009). There is some evidence, in 
line with the rolling correlations, that the response of the repo rate to the PBC bill rate has become stronger 
since 2005 but the variability of the repo rate remains much greater than that of the PBoC bill rate. 
10 ECO/WKP(2010)78 Box 1. Regressions with time-variant coefficients Following Cournède et al. (2008), regressions with time-varying coefficients are used to look at how the 
response of interest rates on one financial asset to interest rates on a different assets has evolved over time. 
Specifically, the analysis underpinning the time-varying coefficients graphed in Figures 3(c, d) and 4 respectively 
looks at the response of: @BULLET Repo rates in the interbank market to PBoC bill rates at three and 12-month maturities. @BULLET 10-year Treasury bond rates to movements in the three-mouth interbank repo rate. For ease of exposition, the following description of this technique is based on the latter – i.e. the response 
of long rates to short rates. The technique is exactly analogous for the former. Equation [1] relates monthly changes in nominal interest rates on government bonds ( ) t l

With constant coefficients, the presence of co-integration between long and short rates would require estimating an 
error-correction model to avoid omitted variable bias. However, time-varying coefficients are poorly identified in

of the coefficients (including the short-run ones) as well as by the long-run parameters. For this reason, the model

95 % confidence interval Source: Authors' analysis. A significant reduction in the amount of excess reserves held by the banking sector is one important 
reason why China's money market has become more sensitive to the actions of the PBoC and different 
market segments have become more integrated. In early 2002, excess reserves accounted for almost 8% of 
bank deposits, more than doubling the size of bank reserves deposited at the PBoC (Figure 5). By the start 
of 2009, excess reserves had fallen to under 2.5%. Hence, smaller banks are now more likely to need to 
borrow in the money market to cover their requirements at the central bank and are therefore more 
sensitive to money market rates. For larger banks that supply funds to the market, the channel for 
influencing inter-bank rates is different in that they can always elect not to roll over their lending to raise 
reserves during time of relatively scarce liquidity. Notwithstanding recent falls, excess reserves in the Chinese banking system are still high compared to 
those found in other countries historically. For instance, in the decade prior to September 2007, excess 
reserves in the United States were only 4% of the amount of required reserves, since excess reserves were 
not remunerated. 5 There are a number of reasons for high reserve levels in China. In part, they arise in 
response to the method used to calculate a bank's required reserves. Specifically, banks are penalised if 
their reserves at the end of each business day fall below the required level, which is set equal to average 
deposits at the end of the last ten day accounting period multiplied by the required reserve ratio. In Japan 
and the euro area, banks are allowed to hold reserves below the required level on a given day provided the 
monthly average level of reserves meets the target. In the United States the averaging period is two weeks. 
Thus, the reserve requirement in China is not a period average requirement. Also, as discussed below, high 
liquidity in the banking system is an inevitable consequence of the current exchange rate regime coupled 
with generally large capital inflows. In addition, the relatively small size of China's bond market means 
that banks have only limited options for investing their large deposit base. Finally, the interest rate paid by 
the PBoC on excess reserves effectively lowers their opportunity cost. 5. 
Three years later, however, following massive open market operations and the fall in the demand for credit, 
banks held total reserves that were 14 times greater than their required reserves. Moreover, since 
September 2008 excess reserves have been remunerated.

money supply and demand translate into high-frequency interest rate volatility. In part, this volatility 
reflects the need for Chinese banks to meet required reserve targets on a daily basis. As a result, realised 
interest rate volatility in the interbank market is typically higher in China than in countries with an 
implementation framework based around an overnight policy interest rate and longer reserve assessment 
periods (Figure 5). Moving to a policy interest rate framework and a longer reserve reference period would 
help reduce high-frequency interest rate volatility. This approach would also enable the system to handle 
shocks better and allow changes in policy settings to be communicated to the public more effectively.

Realised volatility is calculated as the log of squared changes in the relevant interest rate at the daily frequency: RVol t = ln(i t -i t-1 ) 2 where RVol t is realised volatility and i t is the relevant interest rate at time t. Unlike measures of implied volatility derived from options 
pricing, realised volatility does not impose restrictive assumptions on the distribution of volatility. In addition, unlike other possible 
volatility measures, realised volatility is independent of the mean level of interest rates (ECB, 2005). Source: Authors' analysis. The response of bank lending to money-market conditions While there is growing evidence that the PBoC influences market interest rates through open market 
operations, the main communication channel for its interest rate policy is through changes in regulated 
bank deposit and lending rates. The PBoC progressively widened the margin between benchmark lending 
and deposit rates from zero at the beginning of the 1990s to 350 basis points at the beginning of this 
century. This restored the profitability of the banking sector and ended the period during which banks were 
14 ECO/WKP(2010)78 seen as a channel for distributing savings, rather than entities that needed to earn a rate of return on their 
own capital. Since 2002, the PBoC has set the regulated lending rate in line with the repo rate, except in relatively 
low growth periods (such as 2005 and 2009) when repo rates have fallen to low levels (Figure 6). In these 
periods, the PBoC has not allowed the regulated lending rate or the deposit rate to fall in line with market 
rates. In the 2006 and 2007 upturn the PBoC did increase savings rates more quickly than in the 2003 
upswing. In the 2009 downturn, however, there was no change in the policy of holding regulated rates 
above market rates. With the growth of the commercial paper market, such behaviour is becoming 
increasingly difficult to manage. This was evident in the first half of 2009 when the issuance of 
commercial paper surged as companies changed the origin of their borrowing towards the commercial 
paper market where interest rates were lower than in the banking system. Figure 6. The regulated bank deposit and lending rates and the repo rate 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 Jul-03 Jan-04 Jul-04 Jan-05 Jul-05 Jan-06 Jul-06 Jan-07 Jul-07 Jan-08 Jul-08 Jan-09 Jul-09 Jan-10 Jul-10 %

benchmark rates by more than 10%. Since then, the bands of permissible interest rates around the 
benchmark rates have been progressively widened and commercial bank lending rates are now only subject 
to a floor, and deposit rates to a ceiling (Figure 7). 6 In theory, this has increased the extent to which 
commercial banks are free to set interest rates. In practice, after an initial spike, the average margin over 
the regulated rate has remained low and fell to only 60 basis points in the first half of 2009. In effect, the 
degree of deregulation has been limited, with banks either reluctant to price loans according their degree of 
risk, or, alternatively, failing to grant credit to higher–risk, smaller companies. In addition, the ceiling on 
deposit rates also still appears to be binding, with effective deposit rates clustered around the benchmark 
(Porter and Xu, 2009). 7 6 . 
Interest rate ceilings on loans still apply, however, for the rural credit cooperatives. 7 . 
In the second quarter of 2009, however, reflecting high market liquidity, medium-and long-term enterprise 
deposit rates exceptionally floated below the PBoC benchmark deposit rates as firms tried to arbitrage the 
commercial paper market and regulated bank deposit rates.

Source: CEIC, PBoC, OECD. Money markets are one of the key links between a country's financial system and its real economy. 
For that link to work, banks must be able to absorb and pass on changes in the cost of funds in the money 
market to bank clients and vary rates in line with their credit-worthiness. This point is especially salient in 
China. Notwithstanding the recent increase in the size of the corporate paper market, bank lending is still 
by far the largest source of outside financing for investment. For example, Liu and Zhang (2007) report 
that the banking sector intermediates about 75% of financial capital in China, implying that bank lending 
rates, to a large extent, determine the marginal cost of capital for the entire economy. With commercial banks increasingly profit-oriented and relying more on the money market as a 
source of funding and the central bank adjusting regulated rates more in line with market rates, the 
relationship between the effective commercial bank lending rate and money market rates is strong. For 
example, since 2004 when data on the effective rate charged on bank lending became available, the 
correlation between the effective one-year bank lending rate and the three-month interbank repo rate has 
been 0.77, significant at the 99% level of confidence. In a simple regression, the coefficient on the three month interbank rate (averaged over a 12-month period) indicates an almost exact pass-through to effective 
one year lending rates (Table 3). 8 Thus, there is now a clear relationship between interest rates on 
short-term PBoC bills, money market rates and both the effective and regulated bank lending rates. As 
such, the interest rate on short-term bills has now become a key signalling rate for Chinese monetary 
policy. 8 . 
It is not possible to compare the one year bank lending rate to the one year repo rate, as in many periods 
there were no transactions in the one-year market.

Another important consideration for the effective transmission of monetary policy is the extent to 
which interest rate changes at the short end of the yield curve influence the long end. Policymakers 
typically influence short rates, but spending and consequently inflation are usually related to interest rates 
at longer maturities. The stronger the relationship between short and long interest rates, the more leverage 
the central bank has along the yield curve, thereby increasing the likelihood of real activity correlating with 
changes in monetary policy. In OECD countries, this relationship has changed over the past few decades, 
reflecting the relative importance of, inter alia, inflation expectations as a driver of bond yields (Cournède 
et al., 2008). In China, the impact of quarterly changes in 90-day interest rates on 10-year bond yields has 
increased since 2005 and is currently broadly comparable to that in a number of OECD countries (Figure 
8). This methodology suggests that the pass-through coefficient of short-term rates on long-term rates had 
risen to around 0.2 until the beginning of 2008 (similar to that found in major OECD countries). However, 
this point estimate was not well defined and had a large standard error. Figure 8. The response of long to short rates -0.6 -0.4 -0.2 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 -0.6 -0.4 -0.2 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 Oct-02 Apr-03 Oct-03 Apr-04 Oct-04 Apr-05 Oct-05 Apr-06 Oct-06 Apr-07 Oct-07 Apr-08 0.8

17 ECO/WKP(2010)78 Since 2008, the rolling coefficient analysis suggests that the relationship between short-term and long-
term rates has broken down. Longer-term yields are affected not just by current short-term interest rates but 
also expectations about future short-term interest rates and hence the future movement of the economy and 
inflation. As yet, there is insufficient information to use the slope of the yield curve in China as an 
indicator of future economic growth in the same way it is often used in advanced economies (Estrella, 
2005). However, a similar relationship does appear to be evolving in China, with the yield curve becoming 
markedly steeper during the period of rapid monetary expansion in the spring of 2009 (Figure 9). By the 
autumn of 2009, its gradient reached unprecedented levels, before starting to fall back as the stance of 
monetary policy became more normal. Figure 9. The differential between long-term and short-term interest rates

changing economy or risks losing its effectiveness. Targeting money growth with quantity-based 
instruments has been a natural evolution for Chinese monetary policy from the era of credit rationing. In 
addition, the PBoC's substantial sterilisation operations, which, as discussed below, are necessary to 
absorb large capital inflows under an inflexible exchange rate regime, also predispose the PBoC towards a 
quantity-based approach to liquidity management. Although quantity-based frameworks have an important 
role to play in countries with shallow and under-developed financial markets, interest rates are a key 
macroeconomic price in more advanced economies and ensuring that they operate freely and transmit 
changes in monetary policy is a crucial prerequisite for an efficient allocation of capital. Making more use 
of policy interest rates would also reduce the PBoC's reliance on changes in required reserves as a means 
of controlling liquidity, which have been found to hamper financial market development (IMF, 2004). In 
addition, changes in required reserves and quantitative monetary tools in general risk becoming less 
effective as other forms of financial intermediation outside the banking system become more important, as 
has been recently happening in China. Moving to a policy interest rate would also lessen the PBoC's reliance on  " window guidance "  to 
commercial banks, which weakens competition and undermines the market determination of interest rates. 
The impact of window guidance on bank behaviour is also unpredictable and asymmetric, with those banks 
following the wishes of the PBoC in times of tightening suffering commercial disadvantage. In addition, 
18 ECO/WKP(2010)78 over the course of the global financial crisis, less reliance on window guidance and more reliance on policy 
interest rates would have given the PBoC better information on the extent of its tightening in the first part 
of 2008 and helped minimise the lending surge when lending quotas were abolished at the end of 2009. 
Such surges in lending are not uncommon after periods during which credit growth has been constrained 
by lending targets. Another important difficulty with using quantity-based tools to implement monetary policy arises 
because China's state-controlled companies still have preferential access to bank finance. As such, a 
reduction in credit growth, for example, typically falls disproportionately on private-sector firms, which, as 
a group, have been the most productive in China (see Chapter 4 in OECD, 2010). In contrast, an interest 
rate hike in a price-based framework is more likely to induce firms to suspend investment projects for 
which the expected stream of future profits is marginal or highly uncertain, without the need for bank 
officials to make such judgements. Conversely, an interest rate cut will tend to stimulate investment 
projects with the highest expected rates of return, whereas mandated increases in bank credit, which have 
played a large role in the PBoC's response to the global recession, imply a greater risk of non-performing 
loans impairing bank balance sheets in the future. As well as moving to a price-based implementation framework, interest rate reform in other areas of 
China's financial markets also needs to proceed. To continue reducing excess reserves in the banking 
system and improving the degree of central bank control over money market conditions, the interest rate on 
excess reserves deposited at the central bank needs to be set significantly below the other central bank rates 
so as to lower the risk of the money market ceasing to function. 9 On the other hand, the interest rate paid 
on required reserves should be set more in line with market rates. As discussed below, this would lower the 
share of foreign reserve sterilisation costs that is currently borne by the commercial banks. Some aspects of China's current interest rate framework also hinder competition in the banking 
sector. With commercial bank interest rates increasingly linked to money market conditions, the primary 
purpose of the PBoC's lending rate floor and deposit rate ceiling has been to safeguard the profitability of 
the predominantly state-owned banking sector. However, the weight given to protecting bank profit 
margins appears to have fallen over time. By 2008, the net interest margin of Chinese banks had dropped 
below those of banks in the United States and other Asian countries and it fell further in 2009, as lending 
expanded rapidly (Table 4). Table 4. Net interest rate margin: an international comparison Net interest receipts as percent of total assets 2007

On occasion, including during the first half of 2009 when the Chinese banking system was awash with 
liquidity, repo rates in the money market have fallen to within a few basis points of the PBoC interest rate 
on excess reserves, inducing the commercial banks to stop using the interbank markets and deposit excess 
cash with the central bank (Figure 2 above). 
19 ECO/WKP(2010)78 Models of oligopolistic markets suggest that while deregulation of the borrowing and lending rates is 
only likely to make a slight change to bank borrowing and lending rates, it would a make a much greater 
difference to the distribution of deposits across banks, allowing smaller banks to grow significantly 
(Feyzioglu et al., 2009). Deregulation should also encourage a greater pass-through of money market rates 
to bank interest rates, though the results cited above suggest that the pass-through has already risen to a 
level similar to that indicated by a model of a deregulated oligopolistic banking sector. As the money 
market now provides banks with an interest rate benchmark, there is no longer a need for the PBoC to do 
so. Accordingly, the benchmark lending and deposit rates ought to be progressively phased out. Concerns 
about bank profitability should be addressed by fiscal and prudential policy, rather than interest rate 
regulation. As underlined in OECD (2010), corporate bond market regulation is also in need of further reform. 
Restrictions in this market protect banks' large corporate lending business. If this market were better 
developed so that the issuing rates of corporate bonds were fully market-determined, competitive pressures 
on banks would intensify. As a result, bank borrowing costs for firms would better reflect market 
conditions, which, in turn, are affected by the PBoC. In essence, greater reliance on market prices in the 
valuation of corporate assets would work to reinforce the balance sheet channel of monetary policy. A key issue for China in moving to a price-based implementation framework is the resilience of the 
banking sector to interest rates changes. As discussed in OECD (2010), reform in this area has moved a 
long way over recent years and the banking sector is now in significantly better health than in the recent 
past. Ultimately, in conjunction with the framework changes discussed below, moving to a policy interest 
rate would facilitate the modernisation of the financial system. Declared non-performing loans had been successfully reduced to low levels by 2008 and have 
remained at this low level, while being fully provisioned. The key to further improving the robustness of 
the banking sector is to transform it into a well-supervised system that effectively allocates credit to its 
most efficient use given prevailing market interest rates. Indeed, the response of the banking system to the 
fiscal stimulus has illustrated that the process of credit allocation could still be improved. In response to 
demand from local authorities and their development corporations, borrowing by local development 
corporations rose by CNY 3 trillion in 2009, bringing the debt of these vehicles to CNY 7.3 trillion (nearly 
22% of GDP). The scale of their borrowing was reduced in the first half of 2010, with their bank and 
capital market borrowing rising by 0.8% and 0.7% of GDP respectively. Overall, the borrowing of local 
financing platforms amounted to almost one-fifth of total outstanding bank loans in June 2010. This was in 
addition to their borrowing of CNY 0.7 trillion in capital markets in 2009 and 2010. According to the bank 
regulator almost one quarter of the bank loans to development corporations have been to projects of 
doubtful financial viability and hence pose the risk of becoming non-performing in future years. Given the strains placed on China's financial system by the current exchange rate regime, further 
interest rate reform needs to be carried out as part of a package that includes changes in currency market 
arrangements, as outlined below. The impact of interest rate changes on the real economy The transmission of monetary policy to the real side of the economy requires that components of 
aggregate demand be sensitive to changes in financial conditions. A great deal of research in this area has 
focused on understanding the impact of interest rate changes on investment, which accounts for a 
particularly large share of GDP and growth in China and is an important driver of business cycle 
20 ECO/WKP(2010)78 volatility. 10 In principle, firms adjust their capital stock so that its marginal productivity equals its user 
cost. As interest rates increase, for example, firms scale back projects for which the expected return is 
insufficient to cover the higher financing costs, and investment slows. In addition to this direct interest rate 
channel, higher interest rates may also reduce firm cash-flow which, in the absence of perfect capital 
markets, will reduce their spending (credit channel). Monetary policy transmission is difficult to see at the macro level The macro-based evidence of a significant negative relationship between interest rate changes and 
capital formation in China is not particularly compelling. For example, Geiger (2006) argues that changes 
in interest rates have had a limited impact on aggregate macroeconomic variables and that the transmission 
of monetary policy via the interest rate channel is distorted. In a VAR-based analysis, Laurens and Maino 
(2007) also find that changes in short-term interest rates have had a minimal and statistically insignificant 
impact on GDP. In another VAR study, Koivu (2008) reports that the transmission of interest rate changes 
to the real economy is weak over the sample period 1998 to mid-2007. Qin et al. (2005) paradoxically find 
that a rise in interest rates leads to an increase in investment, with a lag of about one year. In contrast, other authors have found evidence of a link between interest rates and macro aggregates. 
For example, Girardin and Liu (2006), using a VAR model estimated on monthly data over 1997-2005, 
find that short-term interest rates do have a significant impact on output and inflation, particularly in the 
latter part of the sample period. He et al. (2005) finds that business investment in China is responsive to 
price signals in both the short and the long run. It is difficult to estimate a stable IS equation for China, though some equations suggest that both 
interest rates and the exchange rate have a statistically significant impact on the economy, even if the 
absolute value of this impact is small. Specifically, the following equation is estimated on quarterly data

value of the index increases. It is initially estimated with the full complement of right-hand-side variables 
and then without the insignificant lags. The results are reported in Table 5. Changes in the real interest rate 
are estimated to have had a statistically significant impact on GDP growth during the estimation period that 
runs from 2000 to 2007. The economic scale of the impact is, however, extremely small. Moreover, this 
result is not particularly robust to alternative model specifications or changes in sample period. Changes in 
the real effective exchange rate also have the expected sign and are statistically significant to varying 
degrees. 10. 
In China, gross fixed capital formation has grown by almost 20% per annum over recent years and 
currently accounts for around 40% of GDP. Accordingly, understanding the linkages between financial 
conditions and investment is of key importance when assessing monetary policy's macroeconomic 
stabilisation role.

Chinese macro economy is that state-owned commercial banks are often obliged to lend to SOEs (many of 
which are owned by local authorities and are engaged in infrastructure activities) that enjoy soft budget 
constraints, may have their debts forgiven and are therefore insensitive to changes in the price of credit. 
However, studies of monetary policy transmission in OECD countries also generally have difficulty 
finding clear evidence of a significant link between interest rate changes and investment at the 
macroeconomic level. This difficulty is often ascribed to simultaneity biases – investment moves 
pro-cyclically with the business cycle, which, in turn, is positively correlated with interest rates. 11 Micro-level studies are more revealing In contrast to studies conducted at the aggregate level, micro-level approaches aimed at understanding 
the linkages between capital formation and its user cost have been more fruitful in OECD countries. For 
example, the impact of changes in monetary policy on investment at the firm level has been investigated 
using micro data in France, Germany, Italy and Spain. This work provides compelling evidence of an 
interest rate channel operating through the user cost of capital. In addition, it also uncovers a significant 
credit channel whereby firms with weaker balance sheets display a higher sensitivity of investment 
spending to cash flow. 12 11. 
See, for example, Bernanke and Gertler (1995), Chirinko (1993) and Gilchrist and Zakrajsek (2007). Other 
potential sources of biases include misspecification of dynamics in investment equations, transitory time-
series variation in the data and positively-sloped supply schedules which bias the estimated user cost 
elasticity towards zero (Chirinko et al., 2004). 12. 
See the overview by Chatelin et al. (2003) and the country-specific papers referenced therein. Other studies 
based on micro data that reach similar conclusions for other countries include Gilchrist and Zakrajsek 
(2007) for the United States and Nagahata and Sekine (2005) for Japan. 
22 ECO/WKP(2010)78 In the case of China, there are reasons to think that economic reforms over recent years would have 
increased the elasticity of capital formation to its user cost. Since the 1980s, the Chinese Government has 
been progressively separating government functions from business operations across sectors, including 
banking. SOEs are now held more accountable for their successes and failures and access to finance at 
interest rates that are (implicitly or explicitly) below market levels has become much more limited. At the 
same time, the rapid development of the private sector should also increase the sensitivity of aggregate 
investment to the user cost of capital. Listed Chinese firms have been relying more on debt funding over 
recent years, which should also heighten their sensitivity to interest rate changes (Figure 10). Figure 10. Equity and debt to total liability ratios in listed Chinese firms 0.30 0.35 0.40 0.45 0.50 0.55 0.60 0.65 0.30 0.35 0.40 0.45 0.50 0.55 0.60 0.65 2002

China to include the impact of the user cost of capital on firms' investment decisions. 13 The model follows

alternative user cost measures: @BULLET 
UC1: In the benchmark version of the model debt financing costs are measured as an  " apparent 
interest rate " , calculated as finance expenses over total firm debt. Reflecting data availability, 
finance expenses are calculated using net finance costs less cash received from investment 
income at the firm level. This variable is highly correlated with total firm debt, implying that it 
predominantly reflects debt servicing costs. This is firm-level data and introduces firm-specific 
variation into this measure of debt financing costs. @BULLET 
UC2: Debt financing costs are measured at the macro level as the 1-year benchmark interest rate 
for commercial bank lending, set by the PBoC. @BULLET 
UC3: Debt financing costs are measured as the 1-year effective bank lending interest rate, which 
is an average of interest rates actually paid on commercial banks loans as surveyed by the PBoC 
(see Figure 6 above). @BULLET 
UC4: Debt financing costs are based on the  " apparent interest rate "  as in UC1, but the debt and 
equity rate are weighted by the changes in the debt and equity share of total liabilities for each 
firm in each year. The advantage of these  " flow "  weights is that they reflect the ongoing financial 
decisions of the firm. The disadvantage is that they are not directly linked to a well-defined 
marginal decision (von Kalckreuth, 2001). The micro data used in the model covers listed Chinese firms at the annual frequency over the period 
2002 to 2007. Descriptive statistics of the variables are given in Table 6. With the exception of changes in 
user cost, the distributions of all the other variables are positively skewed. The within-firm standard 
deviation, which measures the variability of each variable across time abstracting from variation across 
24 ECO/WKP(2010)78 firms, is relatively high for cash flow over capital ( 1 
, , − 
t 
s t 
s K 
cf ), whereas the investment to capital ratio ( 1 
, , − 
t 
s t 
s K I ) has been relatively less volatile. Finally, a comparatively large share of the volatility in all of the changes in user cost variables (UC1 to UC4) can be explained by aggregate time effects and is therefore 
common across firms, particularly user cost estimated using commercial bank lending rates at the macro 
level. In contrast, most of the variability in the other variables in the model is firm-specific. Table 6. Descriptive statistics of regression variables Variable

broadly similar at around 0.2, indicating that investment responds positively to increases in firm output, as 
proxied by real sales growth. The estimated impact of changes in the user cost of capital on investment varies across models. In the 
benchmark model, the user cost, which is calculated using the apparent interest rate at the firm level 
(UC1), has a negative impact on investment that is statistically significant – all of the contemporaneous 
and lagged values are negative and significant with a peak impact occurring after one year. This indicates 
that by influencing the cost of debt financing and the opportunity cost of equity financing, interest rate 
changes alter the user cost of capital for Chinese firms and thereby affect investment. The long-run impact of changes in the user cost of capital on investment at the firm level is negative 
and statistically significant in all version of the model, except the one estimated using UC2, in which debt 
financing costs are measured using the PBoC benchmark commercial bank lending rate. When the 
effective lending rate is used in the user cost calculation (UC3) the first and second lags are both negative 
and significant to varying degrees, although the contemporaneous coefficient is significantly positive. 
Finally, when the user cost if calculated using the  " flow "  weights (UC4), all the coefficients are negative 
although only the contemporaneous value is significant at the 5% level. 14 The finding that UC3 – the user 14. 
As a result of the additional lag used to calculate the flow weights and the exclusion of negative weights, 
the number of observations in this regression is significantly reduced relative to the benchmark model. 
26 ECO/WKP(2010)78 cost of capital estimated using the benchmark commercial bank lending rate – has no significant impact on 
capital formation implies that this policy interest rate is becoming increasingly irrelevant for 
macroeconomic control and strengthens the case for it to be abolished. In all versions of the model, the cash flow variable is typically highly significant. This may reflect the 
effect of monetary policy operating through the firm's balance sheet – that is, a change in monetary policy 
translates into a change in the amount of funds available to the firm, and thus affects firm investment. In 
most cases, the coefficient on the first lag is negatively signed, although the long-run elasticity is still 
positive, indicative of binding credit constraints in China's listed companies sector. Note, however, that 
interpreting the implication of the coefficients on the cash flow variable can be problematic given that 
current investment depends on expected future profits, which may be correlated with current cash flow. To assess whether the impact of the user cost of capital and cash flow on investment differs across 
firm size, Table 8 reports the results of estimating the investment equation with firms split into three equal-
sized groups based on the number of employees. The results are essentially unchanged from those reported 
in Table 8. Changes in firm sales have a significant positive effect on investment. There is some evidence 
that investment by large firms is less sensitive to the cost of capital, with the long-run elasticity much 
lower than in the case of small and medium-sized firms, perhaps indicating that SOEs are still somewhat 
less sensitive to the user cost of capital than the private sector. There does not, however, appear to be any 
differences in the impact of cash flow on investment across different-sized firms.

on business investment is not only statistically significant but also of a scale that is useful for 
macroeconomic stabilisation. In this simulation, the policy interest rate is raised by one percentage point 
while inflation is held constant. This policy rate shock is then reversed linearly over five years. Changes in 
28 ECO/WKP(2010)78 the policy interest rate are assumed to gradually feed into the interest rate faced by firms according to the 
maturity structure of their debt and the extent of equity financing. 15 The cost of equity financing is driven 
by the cost of long-term debt, which, based on the observed behaviour of Chinese 10-year bond rates, 
increases by 0.2 percentage point for every percentage point rise in short rates. In total, reflecting the 
gradual impact of the policy rate on interest rates faced by firms, the user cost of capital increases by only 
one third of a percentage point in the first year in response to a one percentage point increase in the policy 
rate. Even so, this relatively mild policy interest rate shock is estimated to lead to a cumulative slowdown 
in investment and GDP relative to baseline of 2.5% and 0.9% respectively over the next four years 
(Figure 11). Figure 11. Impact on investment and GDP of a one percentage point increase in real policy rates The increase in the policy rate is tapered to zero over five years Investment -1.2 -1.0 -0.8 -0.6 -0.4 -0.2 0.0 -1.2 -1.0 -0.8 -0.6 -0.4 -0.2 0.0 1

4 GDP Source: Authors' analysis. The impact of monetary policy on asset prices A further channel by which monetary policy can influence economic activity is through its impact on 
asset prices. Central bank operations that increase liquidity will cause the prices of private sector assets to 
rise and for investors to move towards less-liquid assets, thereby increasing the prices of longer-term 
securities and then other assets such as stocks and real estate (Bordo and Wheelock, 2004). This channel 
appears to be quite strong in China. Stock market prices are affected rapidly and to a large extent by 
changes in monetary policy settings. Koivu (2009), for example, finds that, over 1998-2008, a one 
percentage point increase in the money supply leads to an increase in equity prices of 3.5% within two 
quarters. The impact of a similar increase in money on house prices is somewhat less (2.5%) and is spread 
out over a two year period. Such findings suggest that much of the surge in house prices in 2010 can be 15 . 
This average interest rate is not the rate that enterprises should use in making their investment decision; 
rather the interest rate on new borrowing should be used. However, almost all firm debt is short term, so 
reducing this bias. For the average firm, 80.9% of debt has an original maturity of less than one year. Of 
the remaining long-term debt, 17% had a maturity of less than one year, suggesting an average initial 
maturity of 6 years. 
29 ECO/WKP(2010)78 attributed to the rapid growth of money during 2009. The impact of interest rates, rather than credit 
availability, appears to be much lower (Zhu, 2006). The impact of monetary policy on consumption is probably small but growing 
China's consumer credit market is still relatively small compared with enterprise credit but is 
developing quickly. At the end of the 1990s, there was scarcely a housing market at all. However, as a 
result of housing market reforms that concluded in 1998, the sale of state-owned housing to occupants at 
less than market value resulted in a large number of owner-occupiers with little debt and created the 
potential for a buoyant market. Since then, a re-orientation of the banking system towards more 
commercial lending practices has significantly increased the dynamism of the residential mortgage market. 
Banks have rapidly expanded mortgage lending, which has increased by over 20% annually between 2006 
and 2008. Lending accelerated further in 2009 and 2010. In the twelve months to June 2010, residential 
mortgages rose by almost half, reaching almost 13% of total bank lending, an increase of almost three 
percentage points in one year. The housing market is therefore becoming a significant additional channel through which interest rate 
changes affect the real economy. At the current level of interest rates and assuming a 15-year mortgage, a 
two percentage point increase in interest rates would increase mortgage payments by an amount equivalent 
to 3.5% of consumer spending or 1% of GDP. 16 As yet there is little evidence than changes in housing 
wealth have any impact on private consumption, in contrast to the position in other Asian economies such 
as Hong Kong, Singapore and Thailand (Peltonen et al., 2009). Equity prices appear to have an impact on 
private consumption but the effect is small at best: a 10% rise in stock prices appears to raise private 
consumption by 0.12% according to Peltonen et al. but Koivu (2009) found no impact. The determinants of Chinese inflation 
In market economies, the difference between aggregate demand and potential output is a key source 
of changes in inflation pressure: the output gap, as a summary measure of the extent of excess demand, is 
an important link between the real side of the economy and inflation. Given that the investment decisions 
of Chinese firms are sensitive to interest rate changes and the rapid growth of consumer credit, a 
significant relationship between aggregate demand and inflation would provide important evidence of an 
operative monetary policy transmission channel. Of course, for this link to work, prices need to be largely 
determined by market forces, which is generally now the case in China. 17 From the mid-1980s to the mid-1990s the Chinese economy was very volatile, with wide swings in 
the output gap and inflation. Subsequently, the adoption of a fixed exchange rate peg against the dollar, 
following a period of large devaluations, helped reduce inflation volatility. At the same time, with greater 
experience in managing an increasingly market-oriented economy, the gaps between aggregate supply and 
demand have moderated. In addition, the adoption of a more flexible exchange rate policy in 2005 
increased the ability of monetary policy to focus on domestic objectives and stabilise inflation. However, 
in part reflecting the global commodity cycle, inflation began to increase again prior to the global financial 
crisis, with CPI inflation peaking at 8.1% in February 2008. From the beginning of 2009, reflecting a 16 . 
Mortgage lending is regulated by the PBoC. Until recently, the mortgage interest rate had to be adjustable 
and linked to the regulated commercial lending rate of the banks. Rates are changed at the beginning of 
each year. Mortgages must be less than 80% of the assessed value of the property and payments must be 
less than 50% of income. 17 . 
Price reform in China began in agricultural markets in the late 1970s and gathered pace in the mid-1980s. 
By the early 1990s, almost half of industrial prices had been deregulated. By 2003, this figure had 
increased to almost 90% (OECD, 2005). 
30 ECO/WKP(2010)78 marked tightening in monetary policy one year earlier and the global economic recession, Chinese inflation 
declined markedly, turning into deflation. Consistent with China's recent inflation experience, the OECD's 
estimate of the output gap indicates significant excess demand in 2007 that subsequently turned into excess 
capacity with the tightening of monetary policy and the global recession (Figure 12). Figure 12. Changes in inflation and the output gap -15 -12 -9 -6 -3 0 3 6 9 12 -8 -6 -4 -2 0 2 4 6 1986

mixed results. Using a basic specification of the Phillips curve, Coe and McDermott (1996) find no support 
for a link between aggregate demand and Chinese inflation over the 1970s and 1980s. Ha et al. (2003) 
measure potential output using a simple linear trend and also find that the Phillips curve fails to explain 
inflation dynamics in China, which they attribute to the difficulties of estimating potential output. In 
contrast, papers using data from the more recent period and output gaps estimated using more appropriate 
techniques do find support for the Phillips curve in Chinese data. For example, Oppers (1997) finds that 
China's inflation experience does, to a large extent, reflect surges in the main components of aggregate 
demand. Gerlach and Peng (2004) also find that the Phillips curve fits the Chinese data provided adequate 
care is taken to account for the effect of structural change on price formation in the economy. Finally, in a 
careful analysis that uses time dummies to account for structural change, Scheibe and Vines (2005) find 
that the output gap, the exchange rate, and inflation expectations all play important roles in explaining 
Chinese inflation. To assess the impact of changes in aggregate demand on inflation in China, the following Phillips 
curve is estimated, based on Scheibe and Vines' approach but updated to include five additional years of 
data, at a quarterly frequency and to end-2007: ε

the OECD's estimate of the Chinese output gap derived using a production function methodology and e is 
the nominal effective exchange rate expressed so that an increase is a depreciation. The results of estimating this equation are given in Table 9. In the backward-looking version of the 
model, in which expected inflation is assumed to equal inflation in previous quarters, the coefficient on the 
31 ECO/WKP(2010)78 output gap is positive and significant, indicating that Chinese inflation does react to the level of excess 
demand in the economy. When aggregate demand is greater than the economy's supply capacity, inflation 
begins to move upwards in response to shortages in key markets. The converse applies when the output 
gap is negative. Table 9. Phillips curve estimates for China Dependent variable: Four-quarter change in the CPI Explanatory variable Using lagged CPI

statistically significant, implying that changes in the (trade-weighted) nominal exchange rate also drive 
inflation, with currency appreciation working to bring down inflation. In the  " hybrid "  version of the model, expected inflation is proxied by using both lagged inflation and 
a survey measure of forward-looking inflation expectations. The coefficient on the surveyed inflation 
measure has the expected positive sign and is highly significant indicating that current inflation is 
influenced by expected inflation one year in the future. Furthermore, the sum of the coefficients on lagged 
and forward-looking inflation and changes in the nominal exchange rate are not statistically different from 
one, implying that the long-run Phillips curve is vertical and there is no long run trade-off between excess 
demand and inflation. As a result, any sustained increase in output above potential would lead to ever-
higher inflation. These results suggest that monetary policy will be more effective than would otherwise be the case 
provided that the PBoC's pursuit of low and stable inflation is credible. If it is believed that the PBoC will 
adjust policy settings to keep inflation low, this will, to some extent, become self-fulfilling through the 
32 ECO/WKP(2010)78 impact of expected inflation. As a result, a given reduction in inflation can be brought about by smaller 
changes in the output gap than if expectations were based purely on past inflation. Not surprisingly, given price and other reforms in China, Phillips curve estimates are sensitive to the 
sample period and to how structural change is accounted for in the model. However, with a larger share of 
economic activity being conducted by the private sector and subject to market conditions, the relationship 
between excess demand and inflation is likely to become increasingly robust over time. While the evidence from estimated policy reaction functions is not yet conclusive, two estimates 
suggest that the PBoC and the State Council do take into account an inflation target in setting interest rates 
and do not rely entirely on quantity-based targets. Using monthly data, He and Pauwels (2008) find that 
interest rates appear to be changed in proportion to the deviation of annual inflation from a rate of 3% and, 
to a lesser extent, to the deviation of money supply growth from the target. Policy interest rates also tend to 
move when foreign exchange reserves are growing. On the other hand, the extent to which output differs 
from trend (the output gap) does not appear to enter into the policy reaction function. Other authors, such 
as Mehorat and Sanchez-Fung (2010), find that inflation enters much more weakly into the reaction 
function. The monetary policy cycles of 2007 and 2010 both fit a reaction function in which inflation plays a 
role. In both cases, the tightening cycle for interest rates started a few months after inflation rose above 
3%. From the point of view of controlling inflation, however, this reaction comes too late, since inflation 
responds to the output gap with a lag of several quarters. Consequently, leaving an increase in interest rates 
until after inflation has reached 3% will cause inflation to overshoot. The PBoC and the State Council need 
to take a more forward-looking approach in which rates are moved in response to demand pressures in the 
goods market, rather than waiting until inflation has breached the target. The role of the exchange rate regime in Chinese monetary policy Since a system of dual exchange rates was abolished in 1994, China's exchange rate regime has 
officially been described as a managed float. During the first half of the 2000s, however, the renminbi was 
effectively pegged to the US dollar. In July 2005, the renminbi was revalued by 2.1% against the US dollar 
and the bands of permissible daily movements increased to ± 0.3%. The authorities also announced that, 
going forward, the value of the renminbi would be set relative to a currency basket. In practice, the 
authorities did permit the rate of renminbi appreciation vis-à-vis the US dollar to increase after the 
July 2005 announcement but daily changes typically did not test the ± 0.3% bound. 18 Since August 2008 
until recently, the pace of appreciation has stalled and the value of the renminbi has been broadly stable 
against the US dollar. The weights in the renminbi currency basket The official weights in the renminbi currency basket have not been disclosed. However, these weights 
can be estimated using a modified version of a model devised by Frankel and Wei (2007). Specifically, the 
following equation is estimated: 18 . 
From end-July 2005 to August 2008, the absolute value of daily changes in the renminbi spot rate vis-à-vis 
the US dollar averaged 0.06%, only a small fraction of the permissible maximum. The limit of ± 0.3% was 
reached or exceeded on only three days.

in the model is constrained to equal one, though this has little impact on the estimation results. The same 
model is also estimated over the entire sample period using the time-varying coefficients methodology 
outlined in Box 1. The results of estimating equation [7] are given in Table 10. Over the whole period, as expected, the 
US dollar is the primary currency in the basket with the remainder of the basket containing only other 
Asian currencies and this is confirmed by the use of the time-varying coefficient methodology (Figure 13). Table 10. Estimated currency weights in the renminbi currency basket Full sample US dollar

authorities focussed on the US dollar rate, rather than on a basket that would have more closely reflected 
the share of the US dollar in effective exchange rate calculations. OECD estimates suggest that the weight 
of the United States dollar in an effective exchange rate index should have been around 13% in 2008 
(Table 11). The addition of currencies closely linked to the US dollar (such as those of Hong Kong, China 
and Chinese Taipei), the weight of the US dollar zone only rises to 24%. (Table 11). As a result, the 
effective exchange rate often moves quite strongly even if the rate against the dollar is fixed (Figure 14).

was a marked change in the weight of the dollar about one year after the initial revaluation. Figure 14. Bilateral and effective exchange rates -2.5 -2.0 -1.5 -1.0 -0.5 0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 Jun-00

36 ECO/WKP(2010)78 While the authorities have been reluctant to allow a nominal appreciation of the renminbi against the 
dollar for more than half of the past decade, a real appreciation of the currency normally occurs as an 
economy develops. This is the result of the ratio of prices in the service sector of an economy to prices in 
tradable goods rising towards the ratio seen in advanced countries. As a result, the overall price level 
increases relative to advanced countries and hence the real exchange rate appreciates. This tendency of the 
real exchange to appreciate, and hence for the market exchange rate to approach the purchasing power 
parity of the currency, is known as the Harrod-Balassa-Samuelson (HBS) effect. Allowing for this effect, 
and using the most recent estimates of purchasing power parities, the Chinese currency was close to its 
income-adjusted purchasing power parity level in 2007 (Cheung et al., 2010). The HBS effect, however, is 
even more pronounced when relative productivity is used, instead of relative income, to measure the extent 
to which an economy lags behind the most advanced countries. Indeed, for the renminbi the gap between 
the productivity-adjusted purchasing power parity and the market exchange rate is even narrower than on 
the income measure. The theoretical expectation that the real exchange would appreciate gradually, is matched by the 
actual gradual real appreciation of the renminbi over the period since the currency became fully convertible 
for trade purposes in 1994. Since then the currency has appreciated on average by 1.7% per year. Such an 
appreciation is almost exactly in line with the cross-sectional slope of the HBS and the speed with which 
the Chinese economy is the closing the productivity gap with the United States. The sterilisation of foreign reserve inflows 
Over recent years, China's exchange rate regime has been coming under increasing pressure. Since 
2005, large current account surpluses and rising capital inflows, particularly of foreign direct investment, 
have resulted in appreciation pressure on the renminbi (Figure 15 Panel A). In response, the State 
Administration of Foreign Exchange has sold renminbi, leading to a large and sustained increase in foreign 
reserves to unprecedented levels. In late 2008 and early 2009, sizeable capital outflows slowed the pace of 
foreign reserve accumulation, while a fall in the current account surplus was responsible for a fall in 
reserve accumulation in the first half of 2010 (Figure 15 Panel B). Since the beginning of 2009, the pace of 
reserve accumulation has slowed to USD 28 billion per month down from USD 34 billion per month in the 
previous 18 months. By September 2010, total reserves stood at $2.65 trillion, making China by far the 
world's largest holder of foreign exchange reserves, ahead of Japan. The rapid accumulation of foreign exchange reserves arising from currency intervention has the 
potential to spill over into China's domestic money market by affecting reserve money growth and wider 
monetary conditions. This has been an important consideration underpinning the policy actions of the 
PBoC over recent years. To limit such effects, the PBoC uses OMOs of PBoC bills and changes in 
commercial bank reserve requirements to drain liquidity from the banking system and sterilise the 
domestic monetary consequences of foreign reserve inflows. Since 2002, the value of the PBoC's sterilisation instruments outstanding has risen roughly in line 
with the stock of foreign exchange reserves, indicating that the central bank has generally been successful 
in offsetting the domestic monetary impact of reserve inflows (Figure 15). Accordingly, base money 
growth has been relatively stable, with little evidence of a trend pick-up in the mid-2000s when reserve 
inflows began to accelerate. Since then, the PBoC has primarily relied on reserve requirement hikes to 
offset increased inflows while the issuance of PBoC bills has slowed. Prior to the onset of the global 
financial crisis, the total value of PBoC sterilisation instruments peaked at 27.5% of bank deposits 
(required reserve ratio of 17.5% or CNY 7.8 trillion plus PBoC bill issuance of 10% of bank deposits or 
CNY 4.6 trillion).

purchases of PBoC bills and cuts in the required reserves ratios to inject around CNY 780 billion of base 
money, opening a gap between the movement of reserves and the total of the outstanding sterilisation 
instruments (Figure 16). This was then progressively reversed from the summer of 2009 and by 
March 2010, the total value of PBoC bills outstanding was CNY 4.3 trillion, equivalent to 6.7% of total 
bank deposits. With the required reserves ratio back to 17% – equivalent to CNY 10 trillion – the PBoC 
was effectively removing almost one quarter of bank deposits from circulation. Figure 16. PBoC sterilisation and base money 0 2000 4000 6000 8000 10000 12000 14000 16000 0 2000 4000 6000 8000 10000 12000 14000 16000 2002Q1

Required reserves 
Foreign reserves Source: CEIC Relative to the PBoC's desired rate of reserve money growth – derived from a money supply 
equation – Ouyang et al. (2007) estimate that the central bank was able to sterilise 92 to 97% of excess 
reserve inflows over 1999-2005. Even during the period of slow appreciation of the currency post 2005, 
the sterilisation of foreign currency purchases was successful. Such periods of slow appreciation can 
complicate the conduct of monetary policy as they can give rise to expectations of further appreciation that 
in turn generate capital inflows. It has been argued that such a policy is inherently unstable, as expectations 
38 ECO/WKP(2010)78 of further exchange rate rises generate capital inflows on a scale that would make sterilisation impossible 
(McKinnon and Schnabl, 2009). However, this does not appear to be the case for China, where the PBoC 
was able to maintain the growth rate of M2 very close to its target of 17% during the period of slow 
currency appreciation vis-à-vis the US dollar. While capital flows have been a source of increases in 
reserves in certain periods, over the longer haul the increase in reserves (excluding valuation changes) has 
been the result of the current account surplus and inflows of foreign direct investment (Table 12). 
Since 2007, the government has encouraged capital outflows from state-owned enterprises, notably in the 
area of resource-related investments (OECD, 2008), and, together with the creation of a sovereign wealth 
fund, helped reduced pressure on reserve increases, notably in 2008. Table 12. Currency inflows and increase in foreign exchange reserves USD billion 2005

39 ECO/WKP(2010)78 Although the PBoC has generally managed to sterilise the effect of foreign reserve inflows on the 
domestic money supply, holding large reserves is not necessarily costless. Cost/benefit quantification is 
difficult, however, as it depends on several unknowns, including the maturity of bonds held as reserves and 
their currency composition. 19 One extreme case is to assume that all foreign exchange reserves are held in 
dollars, invested in instruments with short-term maturities and financed in local currency by the issue of 
liabilities with similar maturities to the assets. Then, the financing cost depends on the short-term interest 
rate differential between US Treasury and PBoC bills. Since 2003, when the build-up in reserves took off, 
Chinese rates have been, on average, 20 basis points below US rates. This small differential has occurred 
despite capital controls that, in theory, prevent arbitrage between domestic and foreign money markets. In 
total, over the period from June 2003 to October 2009, the cumulated interest cost of financing the reserves 
would have been close to zero on the basis of this extreme assumption. Periods when financing was 
expensive, such as since the beginning of 2008, have been offset by periods when there was a profit in 
holding reserves. This was noticeably the case in 2007, when the Chinese authorities did not follow the 
Federal Reserve in raising short-term interest rates. In the first half of 2010, the financing cost began to 
mount and approached three-quarters of a percentage point of GDP. While the interest rate cost of holding reserves has been minimal, the central bank has incurred 
substantial losses due to the appreciation of the currency against the dollar. If the reserves had been held 
entirely in dollars, the cumulative loss would have amounted to around 6% of annual GDP by 
October 2009 and would eventually require a recapitalisation of the central bank. As well as exposing the central bank and indirectly the government to interest rate and exchange rate 
risk, the PBoC's sterilisation operations also impose considerable cost on the Chinese banking sector. In 
particular, the interest rate paid by the PBoC on required reserves is typically lower than interest rates 
prevailing in the money market, implying significant opportunity costs for the commercial banks from 
having to hold reserves. This has worked against the impact of regulated interest rates on bank profits, 
described above. Sterilisation costs are a fiscal problem and arrangements need to be put in place to pay commercial 
banks a competitive rate of interest on required reserves and ensure that any losses borne by the PBoC are 
transferred to the government in a timely manner without weakening the commercial banking sector. The way forward on exchange-rate reform Perhaps the greatest cost of China's exchange rate regime is the constraint it imposes on the PBoC's 
ability to tailor monetary policy to domestic objectives. The essential problem stems from Robert 
Mundell's  " inconsistent trinity "  – the impossibility of running an independent monetary policy under a 
fixed exchange rate regime when financial capital is mobile across borders. This arises because, without 
exchange rate adjustment, cross-country differences in interest rates lead to capital flows that affect 
domestic financial conditions. Ultimately, the arbitrage opportunity closes and the central bank is 
prevented from running an independent monetary policy. Intervening to sterilise changes in foreign reserves can forestall this adjustment but runs the risk of 
ever-increasing capital flows that could ultimately overwhelm central bank control of the money supply. 
For example, resisting currency appreciation and sterilising the foreign reserve inflow prevents the 
domestic interest rate from falling, which attracts more inflows, necessitating more sterilisation, etc. 19 . 
Even if these were known, there would arguably be a need to standardise the risk factors for both assets 
and liabilities, otherwise part of the cost (or apparent profit) would be due to unmatched risk-taking, rather 
than the cost of sterilisation per se. 
40 ECO/WKP(2010)78 Eventually, as sterilisation costs become prohibitive, the central bank has no choice but to allow the 
currency to appreciate or interest rates to fall, sparking domestic inflation. In either case, an appreciation of 
the real exchange rate becomes unavoidable. In the case of China, capital controls do provide the PBoC with some scope for independent monetary 
policy despite a heavily-managed exchange rate regime. Deviations from covered interest parity (CIP) vis-
à-vis the United States have been relatively large and persistent at times (Ma and McCauley, 2007). 
Expectations of renminbi appreciation against the US dollar – as measured in the offshore non-deliverable 
forward (NDF) market – have at times influenced the direction and volume of estimated portfolio flows 
across China's border (Figure 17). 20 However, persistent deviations from CIP suggest that these flows are 
insufficient to equalise returns on broadly equivalent assets, implying that China's capital controls do still 
bind to some degree. In turn, this implies that the PBoC has some autonomy in its monetary policy settings, 
despite the exchange rate regime. Figure 17. Estimated monthly portfolio inflows and the covered interest rate differential in favour of the

inflows are measured as the difference between the monthly changes in foreign exchange reserves and the sum of the monthly trade

controls will be sufficient to allow the PBoC to conduct monetary policy in an optimal way in the future. 
Assessing central bank performance in this regard is not straightforward given the difficulties of isolating 
the effect of monetary policy on the macroeconomy. Since the  " boom/bust "  cycles of the 1980s and 1990s, 
Chinese inflation volatility has fallen considerably. However, inflation volatility was also lower in most 
other countries after 2000 and Chinese inflation remains more volatile than in most OECD countries, 
including the United States, against whose currency the renminbi has been extremely stable (Figure 18), 20 . 
A number of authors have investigated the drivers of portfolio inflows in China, finding that to some extent 
they are correlated with expected movements in the exchange rate, interest rate differentials and asset 
market returns (Anderson, 2007; Ma and McCauley, 2007). 
41 ECO/WKP(2010)78 suggesting some difficulty in using monetary policy to stabilise inflation, all the more so as supply shocks 
from the agricultural sector are more important in China than in advanced economies. Figure 18.

Source: World Development Indicators, authors' analysis. Although a range of factors are at play, the PBoC's policy actions do, indeed seem often to reflect 
balance-of-payments concerns at the expense of domestic policy objectives. For example, Burdekin and 
Siklos (2006) find that changes in foreign reserves play a significant role in the PBoC's monetary policy 
reaction function. Similarly, Ouyang et al. (2007) find evidence that changes in foreign reserves have a 
significant impact on changes in the PBoC's net domestic assets, implying that maintaining a targeted 
exchange rate narrows the scope for monetary policy to address domestic objectives and a failure to fully 
sterilise inflows. Moreover, Laurens and Maino (2007) argue that China's tightly managed exchange rate 
prevents greater reliance on interest rates to manage aggregate demand given that, theoretically, a 
tightening might result in larger capital inflows. However, capital controls have been quite successful in 
restraining capital flows. Indeed, Ma and Macauly (2007) found that capital controls had been sufficiently 
strong to ensure that China had been able to maintain a monetary policy as independent from that of the 
United States as did the European Central Bank which had the opposite combination of policies designed 
to give an independent monetary policy (namely a floating exchange rate and no capital controls). 21 21 . 
However, in making this comparison, the wider macroeconomic context needs to be taken into account. 
For example, if, compared to the euro area, China's business cycle is less correlated with the US cycle, 
then, all else equal, Chinese interest rates will need to deviate from US rates by a relatively larger margin 
for monetary policy to be optimal. 
42 ECO/WKP(2010)78 The monetary policy constraints imposed by China's exchange rate regime are reinforced by concerns 
over the impact of central bank actions on sterilisation costs and the value of China's foreign reserve 
holdings. Given that the existing stock of PBoC bills has an average maturity of less than one year, 
changes in domestic interest rates aimed at controlling inflation quickly affect sterilisation costs. 
Contingent losses on foreign reserves also temper the extent of renminbi appreciation permitted by the 
Chinese authorities. A preference to contain the increase in China's foreign reserve holdings has prompted 
recent efforts to promote the use of the renminbi in international trade and finance. 22 However, if the 
renminbi is to be used more widely internationally, China's capital controls will need to be eliminated so 
that foreigners can invest in renminbi-denominated assets and easily repatriate their capital and income. China will eventually require a flexible exchange rate regime with open capital markets. The next step 
in this direction would be to link the Chinese currency to a basket of currencies of major trading partners 
and to announce the composition of the basket. The value of the currency would still be influenced by 
different factors than those affecting China but the degree of correlation with shocks might be less than in 
the case of linking to the US dollar, as over 44% of the OECD basket for China is accounted for by Asian 
currencies (excluding those linked to the dollar). Under such a regime, in order to mitigate the potential for 
abrupt changes in the value of the renminbi to destabilise economic activity, the PBoC would smooth 
short-run exchange rate fluctuations while allowing the exchange rate to reach its market-determined level 
over longer horizons. Greater exchange rate flexibility would facilitate the implementation of a monetary 
policy geared to domestic objectives. The next step could entail a greater liberalisation of capital outflows 
and a degree of foreign investment in Chinese bond markets, either by allowing foreign investors access to 
the government bond market or allowing greater issuance of renminbi bonds by foreign issuers. The recent 
moves to allow certain banks to issue bonds in the Hong Kong market are a step in this direction as are the 
moves to allow settlement of foreign trade in the Chinese currency. However, these avenues of 
convertibility are still in their infancy with only CNY 18.3 billion of trade settled in renminbi in the first 
quarter of 2010 (about 0.3% of trade in goods and services). Greater exchange rate flexibility would also enhance the exchange rate's role as an automatic 
stabiliser that helps smooth business cycle volatility, as China becomes more integrated with the global 
economy. The empirical modelling work discussed above indicates that changes in the real effective 
exchange rate are a significant determinant of changes in aggregate demand and that the nominal exchange 
rate influences inflation. 23 At the moment, greater exchange rate flexibility would likely result in currency appreciation, increase 
the labour share of income and the purchasing power of households and help reorient investment towards 
the non-tradables sector. However, it would also likely entail a short-term output cost that might warrant 
offsetting measures to boost domestic demand. In these circumstances, the authorities may be inclined to 22 . 
From mid-2009, selected firms in five Chinese cities have been able to settle transactions in renminbi with 
businesses in Hong Kong and Macau. Foreign banks are able to buy or borrow renminbi from mainland 
lenders to finance such trade. The PBoC has also signed currency-swap agreements with Argentina, 
Belarus, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Malaysia and South Korea and will make renminbi available to pay for 
Chinese imports if these economies run short of foreign exchange. Hong Kong banks are now allowed to 
issue yuan-denominated bonds, a step towards building an offshore renminbi market. From August 2009, 
foreigners can open renminbi denominated bank accounts in Hong Kong and banks are free to make both 
interbank transfers and loans in the currency (provided the loans are used outside the mainland), but banks 
cannot yet invest unused balances in the mainland interbank bond market. 23 . 
Shu and Yip (2006) also find that changes in the exchange rate influence aggregate demand, through the 
net exports channel, as well as inflation. 
43 ECO/WKP(2010)78 wait until inflation becomes a problem once again before allowing an appreciation. Greater exchange rate 
flexibility would also reduce the pace at which China's exposure to US dollar assets is rising. Although 
this may entail an initial capital loss on existing reserves, as the renminbi appreciates, it would lower 
China's exposure to future losses. The benefits of moving towards a flexible inflation target Greater exchange rate flexibility raises the question of the most appropriate nominal anchor for 
Chinese monetary policy. The PBoC's reliance on the stock of money as an intermediate policy target is 
problematic. Although a number of studies have identified a link between money growth and inflation in 
the long run, short-run instabilities in the rate of money growth consistent with low and stable inflation 
indicate that a money target is not a good stand-alone nominal anchor (Laurens and Maino, 2007). In 
addition, simple quantity-based frameworks do not handle shocks very well and are susceptible to errors in 
forecasting money demand. The authorities' reaction function should place greater weight on 
forward-looking indicators of inflation and not just react when inflation breaches pre-announced or even 
undeclared targets. Indeed, changes in the PBoC's policy stance should be predicated on informed judgements based on 
monitoring a set of indicators in the framework of a flexible inflation objective over the medium term. 
Because money growth and inflation are correlated in the long run, money aggregates would still have an 
important role to play as informational variables within this framework. 24 This would facilitate the PBoC 
 " leaning against "  excess credit creation and the build-up of related imbalances that have contributed to the 
recent failure of monetary policy in a number of countries to ensure macro and financial stability (White, 
2009). Incorporating a forward-looking inflation objective into the PBoC's monetary policy framework 
would yield a number of additional benefits. 25 Specifically, an inflation objective is transparent and easily 
understood by the public. So when monetary policy is credible, a forward-looking inflation objective can 
help condition inflation expectations, which can play an important role in macroeconomic stabilisation. In 
addition, an inflation objective has the advantage of focusing the political debate on what monetary policy 
is able to achieve in the long run, namely controlling inflation, and away from what monetary policy 
cannot do, namely permanently increasing output growth, lowering unemployment or keeping the real 
exchange rate at some predetermined level. Moving China's monetary policy framework in this direction would require a range of enhancements 
in other areas. Incorporating an inflation objective into the policy framework would allow a rethink of 
NDRC policies that attempt to influence inflation by controlling individual prices. China's macroeconomic 
statistics would also need to continue to improve to provide the PBoC with better information to monitor 
the economy and communicate its policy intentions. Improved macroeconomic statistics would allow for 
better conditional macroeconomic forecasts to inform policy decisions. The literature on Chinese 
macro-modelling is still relatively sparse, but the empirical models discussed in this paper and used in 
other research suggest that relatively stable macroeconomic relationships are beginning to emerge. 24 . 
See, for example, Gerlach and Kong (2005) and Laurens and Maino (2007). 25. 
The pros and cons of inflation targeting in emerging economies are discussed in Mishkin and Schmidt-
Hebbel (2007). 
44 ECO/WKP(2010)78 The issue of central bank independence would also need to be addressed. Currently in China, 
decisions to adjust the PBoC's monetary policy instruments are made by the State Council. Modernising 
the framework would require granting the PBoC instrument independence so it can react promptly and 
decisively to changing economic circumstances without being swayed by political concerns. Operational 
independence would allow the PBoC to generate and sustain the credibility it needs to effectively influence 
inflation expectations. The State Council would still set the strategic objectives, but leave implementation 
to the PBoC. As the exchange rate regime evolves towards greater flexibility, monetary policy should focus 
increasingly on domestic objectives, notably the goal of price stability over the medium term. The 
monetary policy transmission mechanism is operational and the PBoC needs to be able to move short-term 
interest rates in a wider range to enhance the role of monetary policy in buffering the economy from 
domestic and external shocks.
