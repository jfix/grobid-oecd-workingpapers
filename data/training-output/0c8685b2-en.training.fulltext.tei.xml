			<head>A.<lb/> Introduction<lb/></head>

			<p>Having a better understanding of consumers&apos; decision-making processes and of the biases likely<lb/> to influence their economic and financial decisions are key areas of interest to financial services policy<lb/> makers, regulators and supervisors. Behavioural economics studies provide a body of knowledge on<lb/> how people make non optimal economic decisions. By understanding what processes influence<lb/> consumer behaviour, the harmful impacts of poor decision making by consumers and how to mitigate<lb/> them can be incorporated into regulatory and supervisors practices to strengthen financial consumer<lb/> protection.<lb/></p>

			<p>The OECD has been at the forefront of looking at how behavioural insights can help to make<lb/> policies more effective and help consumers make better decisions. 1 Numerous events have been<lb/> organised and several publications on the topic have been published, notably the most recent<lb/> publication on Behavioural Insights and Public Policy, which collects case studies from around the<lb/> world across numerous fields, including on financial products and consumer protection, as a practical<lb/> reference for policy makers. 2 Discussions are also occurring around more specific issues relating to<lb/> financial consumer protection, for example how behavioural biases lead to market inefficiencies and<lb/> reduced competitive pressure. 3<lb/></p>

			<p>As part of this work, this paper describes the basic characteristics and concepts associated with<lb/> behavioural economics, focusing on behavioural finance insights with the aim of improving financial<lb/> consumer protection from a supervisory, regulatory and policy-making perspective. It also presents the<lb/> specific research methods applied in a behavioural economics context, which are largely based on<lb/> empirical research and randomised controlled trials, with a view to understanding how such techniques<lb/> have been applied by regulators and supervisors and their effectiveness. It covers all financial sectors<lb/> and activities (banking, insurance, securities, investment, etc.) and does not specifically focus on retail<lb/> financial services, as the organisation of wholesale markets and their potential abuses can also have an<lb/> impact on retail consumers (e.g. market manipulation).<lb/></p>

			<p>The paper then provides a general overview on how behavioural economics has been applied to<lb/> financial services, outlining recent developments, ideas and lessons learnt through research and<lb/> experiences conducted at national level.<lb/> The Annex provides an annotated bibliography of a non-exhaustive list of key behavioural<lb/> economics publications, papers and research documents.<lb/></p>

			<head>B.<lb/> Context<lb/></head>

			<p>This section of the paper provides the context in which the field of behavioural economics has<lb/> developed, drawing on key material and publications in order to provide main definitions used in the<lb/> field and the historical evolution that has occurred.<lb/> 1 See www.oecd.org/gov/regulatory-policy/behavioural-insights-and-public-policy-9789264270480-en.htm<lb/> 2 <ref type="biblio">OECD (2017)<lb/></ref> 3 See www.oecd.org/daf/competition/workinprogress.htm#Beh_Eco<lb/></p>

			<head>a)<lb/> Definitions and methodology<lb/></head>

			<p>Behavioural economics helps to describe and provide insights into how people fail to behave and<lb/> make rational decisions and choices in their own best interests. 4 Human beings do not always take<lb/> decisions which are consistent with their own preferences and needs, they do not act in a rational way,<lb/> and their choices are often driven by their emotions and their particular context. Mistaken beliefs,<lb/> procrastination, passivity, self-control problems, difficulties in choosing among a large set of options<lb/> are some of the elements which impact consumers&apos; decisions and lead them to choose products or<lb/> services which are not always best suited to their needs. Building on results from psychological,<lb/> cognitive and social research into decision making, behavioural economics therefore explores why<lb/> people make irrational decisions, and why and how their behaviour does not follow the predictions of<lb/> economic models. 5<lb/></p>

			<p>The behavioural economics&apos; view of consumers contradicts the &quot; standard &quot; or &quot; classical &quot;<lb/> economic assumption according to which individuals know what they want and seek to make the most<lb/> of the available opportunities given the scarcity of constraints that they face (<ref type="biblio">Camerer, 1999</ref>). The<lb/> classical homo economicus is an ideal and perfect consumer, who knows what is best for him/her, acts<lb/> thoughtfully and consistently, weighs carefully all options available and makes the best decision to<lb/> serve his/her interests. This approach deliberately ignores the psychological dimensions of the<lb/> decision-making process (<ref type="biblio">Angner and Loewenstein, 2006; Heukelom, 2006</ref>). However, neoclassical<lb/> theory has often fallen short of explaining the anomalies that have occurred within market economies 6 .<lb/> In contrast, behavioural economics suggests mathematical alternatives based on firm<lb/> psychological foundations for rationality assumptions. In that sense, it is at the intersection of<lb/> economics and psychology and seeks to unite the basic principles of neoclassical economics with the<lb/> realities posed by human psychology (<ref type="biblio">Camerer and Loewenstein, 2003; Camerer, 1999;<lb/> McAuley, 2010</ref>).<lb/> In the language of behavioural economists, &quot; bias &quot; refers to the systematic, and most often<lb/> unconscious, deviations from a strict economic model of rationality that many people exhibit in the<lb/> face of (economic) decisions. This covers cognitive biases, which include incorrect beliefs or illogical<lb/> interpretations, social biases such as herding or crowd following, and emotional biases like<lb/> overconfidence or loss aversion. 7<lb/></p>

			<p>The identification of biases and the analysis of the context in which they arise, their specific<lb/> features and characteristics, and the psychological process leading to them are at the centre of<lb/> behavioural economics. The list of behavioural biases is therefore continually evolving. Behavioural<lb/> economics also tries to come up with techniques to prevent, mitigate and possibly reduce the negative<lb/> effects of biases. One of the most significant mitigation techniques is the framing effect: the way a<lb/> choice is presented strongly affects the choice that results.<lb/> 4 It has to be noted that there is no agreed definition of behavioural economics. The broad approach proposed in<lb/> this paper is aimed at providing a large range of situations and examples to illustrate the relevance of<lb/> behavioural economics for financial services.<lb/> 5 Some researchers have called the attention on the need to also consider the potential bias from financial<lb/> institutions and regulatory and policy-making bodies which are equally led by human beings<lb/> (<ref type="biblio">Amstrong and Huck, 2010; Cooper and Kovacic, 2012</ref>)<lb/> 6 See B. b)<lb/> 7 See C. b) for a more detailed presentation of various types of biases.<lb/></figure>

			<p>Regarding the methodology, behavioural economics research is often based on laboratory<lb/> experiments, which place participants in a simulated environment. These &quot; lab experiments &quot; provide<lb/> findings of individual economic agents which are difficult to obtain using conventional econometric<lb/> techniques, and usually take the form of a randomised controlled trial (RCT). 8 Environmental factors<lb/> can be fully controlled, in particular all factors affecting decision makers in a given situation. This<lb/> allows researchers to identify causal relationships. An underlying assumption is that the results<lb/> generated in the artificial environment of laboratory experiments can be generalised and considered<lb/> valid in the broader environment. Field experiments, performed outside of a laboratory in real-life<lb/> situations, have also been used for behavioural economics research. While the results of these studies<lb/> are usually considered to be more generalizable, the drawback is that all influencing factors cannot be<lb/> controlled for.<lb/></p>

			<head>b)<lb/> Historical significance<lb/></head>

			<p>The first conference on behavioural economics was held at the University of Chicago in 1986,<lb/> and in 1994 Harvard University appointed David Laibson as the first official behavioural economics<lb/> professor (<ref type="biblio">Pettit, 2014</ref>). Universities, research organisations and business schools have fairly recently<lb/> recognised behavioural economics as a (sub)discipline.<lb/> However, the notion of psychology as a driver of economic action is not new. Already in the<lb/> 18 th century, Adam Smith noted in The Theory of Moral Sentiments (1790) that the imperfections of<lb/> human psychology did have an impact on economic decisions. He anticipated a wide range of insights<lb/> regarding phenomena such as loss aversion, overconfidence or fairness. But until the middle of the<lb/> 20 th century, economics was dominated by the neoclassical approach based on the theory of a perfect,<lb/> rational homo economicus. The ambition was to elevate economics as a natural science, and<lb/> psychology had to be considered separately. Some economists (such as Francis Edgeworth, Irving<lb/> Fisher or Vilfredo Pareto) included a psychological dimension in their research, but they were given<lb/> limited attention at the time. For example, <ref type="biblio">Pareto (1935)</ref> highlighted that one of the central causes of<lb/> the 1929 stock market crash and the ensuing Great Depression could be the human factor in economic<lb/> decision-making.<lb/> Post-war economists (for example, Samuelson, 1947 or <ref type="biblio">Arrow and Debreu, 1954</ref>) adopted the<lb/> belief that the only valid method to collect information about human choices and preferences was to<lb/> study market transactions or other observable choices. On that basis, the expected utility and<lb/> discounted utility models, which review decision-making given uncertainty and intertemporal (or<lb/> delayed) consumption, gained acceptance. Maurice <ref type="biblio">Allais (1953)</ref> built on this work and demonstrated<lb/> experimentally that in a context of risky outcomes, the key factor for the decision-maker is the risk<lb/> level of the selected option. This result contradicts the expected utility hypothesis -the mathematical<lb/> view of probability being considered in human behaviour -and is known as the &quot; Allais paradox &quot; . First<lb/> presented in 1953, it led to multiple developments in decision theory and behavioural economics.<lb/> Another important milestone was the publication of Models of man, social and rational by Herbert A.<lb/> Simon in 1957, who introduced the concept of &quot; bounded rationality &quot; . He demonstrated that humans&apos;<lb/> decision-making capabilities were limited by the information available, their capacity to evaluate this<lb/> information and the amount of time they had to make the decision.<lb/> Progressively, economists recognised that counterexamples to their theoretical models, evidenced<lb/> by experiments, could not be ignored, and progress in research in psychology identified new directions<lb/> for development. One of the key turning points for behavioural economics was probably the work of<lb/> psychologists Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky at the end of the 1970&apos;s, who explained the<lb/> psychological reasoning behind certain non-rational economic decisions in their paper Prospect<lb/> Theory: An analysis of decision under risk (1979). They found empirically that people underweight<lb/> outcomes that are merely probable in comparison with outcomes that are obtained with certainty, and<lb/> also that people assign value to gains and losses rather than to final assets. Prospect theory has a solid<lb/> mathematical basis, making it comfortable for economists to use.<lb/> Two publications by Richard Thaler and Cass Sunstein fostered today&apos;s recognition of<lb/> behavioural economics and contributed to broadening its influence beyond the academic world. First,<lb/> in 2003 Libertarian paternalism established that given the behavioural findings of bounded rationality<lb/> and bounded self-control, people&apos;s choices could be steered in welfare-promoting directions without<lb/> eliminating their freedom of choice. Second, in 2008 Nudge expanded on this concept and highlighted<lb/> numerous examples where people could be &quot;nudged&quot; to make better decisions using these behavioural<lb/> insights without restricting their option set. By illustrating how behavioural insights could be put to<lb/> practical use, these books have been a major source of inspiration for policy makers and business<lb/> people.<lb/></p>

			<head>c)<lb/> Behavioural economics and public policy<lb/></head>

			<p>Behavioural economics has potential applications in all fields involving human decisions and<lb/> choices, particularly where relatively complex products or services are involved. Jurisdictions<lb/> pioneering in the development of behaviourally informed policy or regulation have already taken<lb/> initiatives in many different areas such as healthcare, food and energy labelling, organ donation,<lb/> charitable giving, energy use, employment activation, fine recovery, etc.<lb/></p>

			<p>Therefore, behavioural economics has now reached a level of maturity and development which<lb/> has led to its progressive recognition as a (sub)discipline with potential applications across various<lb/> public policy fields involving human decisions and choices (<ref type="biblio">Dolan et al., 2010; Lunne, 2014</ref>).<lb/> This is because, first, there is now a substantial set of confirmed evidence on what people&apos;s main<lb/> biases are and how their behaviour is influenced, and second, recent economic events (for example the<lb/> subprime mortgage crisis, or pension mis-selling) can neither be explained nor understood without<lb/> psychological insights which go beyond established notions of &quot; rationality &quot; . On this basis, there is<lb/> growing recognition that the findings of behavioural economics can help to identify areas where<lb/> government intervention can be more effective than was the case with traditional economic models.<lb/> Behavioural economics can provide a more realistic and thoughtful basis for making economic policy.<lb/> This has to be combined with a series of contextual elements which explain why behavioural<lb/> economics increasingly influences the focus and shape of public policy initiatives:<lb/>  Some of the biggest policy challenges -people with chronic health conditions, obesity,<lb/> environmental sustainability -require changes in people&apos;s behaviours, lifestyles or existing<lb/> habits. This does not always require a hard instrument such as legislation or regulation which<lb/> compels people to act in a certain way. Including less coercive and more effective tools aimed<lb/> at changing the environment within which people make decisions and respond to cues can be<lb/> used, with the potential to bring about rapid, significant and long-lasting changes in behaviour.<lb/></p>

			<p> The recent financial crisis and its long-lasting impact on markets have provided evidence of<lb/> the limitations of deregulation and of the &quot; markets-do-it-best &quot; approach. Markets do not<lb/> operate perfectly and individuals do not always follow the most economically rational path<lb/> and addressing behavioural bias through behaviourally informed solutions can help consumers<lb/> make informed decisions and minimise losses arising from human errors.<lb/></p>

			<p> Governments operating with budgetary constraints require robust cost-effective and efficient<lb/> solutions to tackle market failures. Innovative public policy initiatives have to be considered,<lb/> as complementary or alternative tools to conventional &quot; hard &quot; instruments such as regulation,<lb/> legislation or taxation. In this respect, behavioural approaches provide low cost, new ways of<lb/> acting and helping achieve better outcomes for citizens.<lb/></p>

			<head>OECD work on behavioural insights<lb/></head>

			<p>The OECD expressed support early on for the applications of behavioural economics to policy<lb/> and has since given much attention to the improvements it could bring to public policy decision<lb/> making, regulation and rule-making.<lb/></p>

			<head>Consumer policy<lb/></head>

			<p>In 2010, the Consumer Policy Toolkit noted that work done in the field of behavioural economics<lb/> had identified a number of important ways that consumer behaviour may deviate from the assumptions<lb/> underlying the traditional market model and enriched understanding of consumer behaviour in key<lb/> areas (e.g. making choices with uncertain outcomes, trade-offs between present decisions and long-<lb/>term interests). It also underlined that in certain areas, such as designing information disclosures or<lb/> evaluating situations involving default-setting, behavioural economics may provide important insights<lb/> that could improve policy formulation. It recommended that, as behavioural economics continues to<lb/> mature, much attention should be given to further implications for consumer policy.<lb/></p>

			<p>In 2014, the OECD report on Regulatory Policy and Behavioural Economics offered an<lb/> international review of the initial applications of behavioural economics to policy, with a particular<lb/> focus on regulatory policy. It described the extent to which behavioural findings have begun to<lb/> influence public policy in a number of OECD jurisdictions, referring to a total of more than 60<lb/> instances. It illustrated that some jurisdictions have introduced a behavioural dimension in their public<lb/> policy approach as a general guiding principle on better policy-making, or on a case-by-case basis<lb/> (Australia, Canada, the European Commission, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, UK, USA). 9 It also<lb/> indicated that some other jurisdictions have shown interest and are exploring how best to use<lb/> behavioural economics findings in their policy-making approach (France, Norway). The report also<lb/> considered possible lessons for regulatory design and delivery. It highlighted in particular how much<lb/> the environment in which decision makers operate matters, and how good regulations can improve the<lb/> environment, and in this context should be viewed as an enabler and a facilitator to achieving positive<lb/> outcomes.<lb/></p>

			<p>The study also outlined that behavioural economics influences the general approach to public<lb/> policy as well as the solution(s) to the identified market problems. Improved knowledge of consumers&apos;<lb/> psychological traits and decision-making processes impacts the policy vision and strategy, its targets,<lb/> its objectives, etc. It also helps determine what is/are the most effective way(s) to remove the existing<lb/> problems, and this can include a wide range of options, from the provision of selected information to<lb/> regulation, or some form of alternatives to regulation, or ultimately to the control of products. It is<lb/> important to have in mind that adopting a behaviourally-inspired approach does not come as an<lb/> alternative to regulation. It provides an additional tool to design proper regulation when it proves to be<lb/> the most appropriate solution. In this case, behavioural findings will also impact the scope, the shape,<lb/> the nature and the focus of the regulatory provisions, possibly built on a nudge.<lb/> OECD initiative on &quot; New Approaches to Economic Challenges &quot; (NAEC)<lb/></p>

			<p>NAEC was launched by the OECD in 2012 as a comprehensive organisation-wide reflection<lb/> process on the roots and lessons from the crisis, as well as long-term, global trends. NAEC was also<lb/> launched as part of a broader effort to build an inclusive and sustainable agenda for growth and well-<lb/>being. The NAEC process involves renewing and strengthening the OECD&apos;s analytical<lb/> frameworks, policy instruments and tools. This new approach needs to take into account the changing<lb/> context, and in particular the fact that the crisis has provoked changes in some of the assumptions<lb/> about the functioning of the economy, and especially those related to the behaviour of economic<lb/> agents and to risks, paying greater attention to psychological bias, perceived versus objective risks, as<lb/> well as the nonlinearity in risk perception.<lb/> OECD work on behavioural economics is therefore expanding, particularly in the areas of public<lb/> governance, regulatory policy, consumer policy and environmental policy design. The Public<lb/> Governance and Regulatory Policy Committees are also developing a policy toolkit which will include<lb/> some guidance on the application of behavioural economics in policy-making. Further work is under<lb/> discussion in other policy areas such as tax policy. The OECD convened a meeting in 2015 of<lb/> behavioural insights practitioners in governments and regulatory agencies as a platform for sharing the<lb/> experiences applying behavioural approaches to policy. This will help in building and sharing<lb/> knowledge on how and where behavioural economics can contribute to policy making. The platform<lb/> will contribute to developing good practices in applying behavioural insight, reflecting on what works<lb/> and why, and what are the short-and long-term effects of interventions.<lb/></p>

			<head>Pensions<lb/></head>

			<p>The OECD also released a paper in 2007 on the Implications of behavioural economics for<lb/> mandatory individual account pension systems. In individual account pension systems, members bear<lb/> the risks and consequences of their investment decisions. In most cases, these accounts have partially<lb/> replaced public pension systems, raising concerns over their impact on retirement income. The paper<lb/> described the extent to which plan members make active investment decisions in their pension systems<lb/> and assesses the policy solutions that have been put forward to facilitate choice. The paper offers a<lb/> comparative analysis of ten countries that have implemented investment choice in the accumulation<lb/> stage of their individual account pension system.<lb/> Key conclusions from the study are that, although a basic assumption of economic theory states<lb/> that consumers are better off with a wider array of choices, too many investment options can cause<lb/> information overload, resulting in greater confusion and complexity, and, consequently, in a greater<lb/> use of the default option. The design of the default option matters, since even when choice is limited,<lb/> an important group of participants do not exercise active choice. Moreover, many participants may<lb/> interpret the default option as the relevant one for them, as it has been endorsed or proposed by<lb/> policymakers. Policy makers need to urgently address how default investment options should be<lb/> designed and specifically consider new types of default options, such as managed accounts and target<lb/> date funds. Evidence also reveals a preference among members towards equity funds. Participants tend<lb/> to change their asset allocation on the basis of recent performance trends and engage on naive<lb/> diversification strategies, such as equal weights across funds irrespective of their asset allocation.<lb/> In 2008, the OECD indicated in a report on financial education and awareness in the field of<lb/> pensions that improved financial education is the appropriate response if a lack of financial<lb/> information or skills is the reason for low levels of saving. But it also confirms that an increasing<lb/> number of studies in behavioural economics show that financial and savings behaviour relate to<lb/> psychological factors. These findings, therefore, show heterogeneous savings behaviour across<lb/> consumers, which have important implications for the design and implementation of effective<lb/> financial education programmes. For example, in order to meet the needs of those consumers who are<lb/> &quot; non-planners &quot; , financial education programmes will need to emphasise simpler decisions and<lb/> tangible present-day (as opposed to a future day) benefits, using explicit and direct information,<lb/> reduced complexity, and fewer choices. Yet even these directed schemes may not be sufficient, and<lb/> other measures may be required to ensure an adequate level of savings for retirement, for example<lb/> automatic enrolment, with appropriate default options with respect to contribution rates and<lb/> investment allocation.<lb/></p>

			<head>Financial Education and Literacy<lb/></head>

			<p>Under the support of the Russia/World Bank/OECD Trust Fund for Financial Literacy and<lb/> Education, the OECD has raised awareness on the importance of behavioural economics in the<lb/> financial education context. The report (</p>

			<figure>Financial literacy and education Russian Trust Fund 2013)<lb/> explored how the design of financial education programmes can benefit from the findings of<lb/> behavioural economists and economic psychologists. In particular:<lb/>  It gathers a review and discussion of the literature on how behavioural economics can improve<lb/> and complement financial education visually and how it can help the design of financial<lb/> education programmes.<lb/>  It provides an in-depth case study of an innovative application of lessons from psychology to a<lb/> financial education programme in Brazil.<lb/></figure>

			<table>C.<lb/> Behavioural economics and financial services<lb/> a)<lb/> Specific relevance of behavioural economics/psychology for financial services<lb/> Consumers&apos; behavioural problems are accentuated when making (difficult) financial decisions<lb/></table>

			<p>Using behavioural economics insights to better protect consumers involved in financial<lb/> transactions seems of particular relevance given the complexity of financial products and services for<lb/> an average consumer, and the large array of choice. Comparison between products is difficult, as each<lb/> of them has specific features, and pricing structures are not always fully transparent. Besides, financial<lb/> choices are usually important life decisions for consumers involving emotional elements (e.g.<lb/> investing a lifetime savings, planning for retirement, purchasing insurance involving death benefits).<lb/> An additional aspect is that decisions made will only produce their effects over the long-term, meaning<lb/> that risk and uncertainty can play a larger role. It is also difficult for consumers to learn from<lb/> experience, as financial products are often one-off purchases (<ref type="biblio">FCA, 2013; Lunne, 2014</ref>). These<lb/> difficulties are accentuated when consumers are older or vulnerable due to their physical or mental<lb/> condition, their economic circumstances, their family situation, their age, etc.<lb/> In the Netherlands for example, the financial regulator came to the conclusion that because of the<lb/> limited time and motivation consumers allocate to financial decisions, disclosure requirements alone<lb/> are not effective enough in informing and improving consumers&apos; decision making. These insights<lb/> resulted in a desired shift of responsibility between firms and consumers. Firms need to have a more<lb/> active and responsible approach in order to safeguard the interests of consumers. An example of this<lb/> shift concerns saving agreements, where customers were lured in with high interest rates that were<lb/> quietly reduced month-by-month over the years that followed to unrealistically low levels. This kind<lb/> of product would not have existed if customers had assessed their financial products more actively and<lb/> switched to a provider with a more favourable interest rate. However, this did not happen. The<lb/> Authority for the Financial Markets (AFM), the Dutch regulator, came to an agreement with market<lb/> parties that these saving agreements are harmful for customers and they should no longer exist. 10<lb/> Today, with rapidly evolving technologies, consumers benefit from an extended range of<lb/> distribution channels to buy financial services and products, especially mobile phones and the internet,<lb/> and different access points can even be combined. With more opportunities come more risks, in<lb/> particular in terms of fraud but also regarding the information provided to consumers. It is challenging<lb/> for consumers to find and analyse relevant and accurate information in their particular context, and<lb/> assess what information can be trusted. It is therefore particularly important that consumers benefit<lb/> from an equivalent protection regardless of the channel they use to purchase their financial product or<lb/> service.<lb/></p>

			<p>For all of these reasons, behavioural biases are common in consumers&apos; financial decisions, and<lb/> can have significant short-term and long-term impacts on the well-being of consumers and of their<lb/> families. People often make errors when choosing and using financial products, and can suffer<lb/> considerable losses as a result. Using behavioural economics helps to explain how these errors arise,<lb/> why they persist, and what can be done to prevent them. Market forces left to themselves will often<lb/> not work to reduce these mistakes, so regulation may be needed.<lb/> Behaviourally-inspired policy and/or regulatory responses to remedy the most frequently made<lb/> errors can therefore be particularly useful for the area of financial consumer protection.<lb/></p>

			<figure>Box 1. Lessons from behavioural economics for retail financial markets in the UK<lb/> In 2013, The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) published a research paper that summarised the main<lb/> lessons from behavioural economics for retail financial markets:<lb/></figure>

			<p> Consumers make predictable mistakes when choosing and using financial products -the most<lb/> relevant biases for retail markets are listed and categorised according to how they affect decisions:<lb/> preferences (what we want -present bias, reference dependence and loss aversion, regret and other<lb/> emotions), beliefs (what we believe are the facts about our situation and options -overconfidence,<lb/> over-extrapolation, projection bias), and decision-making (which option gets us closest to what we<lb/> want, given our beliefs -framing, salience and limited attention; mental accounting and narrow<lb/> framing; decision-making rules of thumb; persuasion and social influence).<lb/>  Firms respond to these mistakes and how behavioural biases can lead firms to compete in ways that<lb/> are not in the interests of consumers.<lb/></p>

			<p>The research paper then describes how behavioural economics can, and should, be used in the regulation<lb/> of financial conduct following 3 steps:<lb/>  Step 1: Identifying and prioritising issues -establish a set of indicators that can help identify where<lb/> consumer detriment from mistakes may be particularly high, with regard to firms (e.g. uncompetitively<lb/> high margins, concentrated profits from a small group of consumers), to product features (e.g.<lb/> innovative products that appear very cheap, contract features that often target behavioural biases) or<lb/> to consumers (e.g. reported or potential regret, choice out of line with common sense). A<lb/> complementary way is to look at a potential mismatch between the need the product is meant to<lb/> serve and how consumers use it in practice. The size of the problem should be the main priority<lb/> driver.<lb/></p>

			<head></head>

			<p>Step 2: Identifying root causes of problems -investigate whether consumers are making mistakes and<lb/> if so which bias(es) are the cause (examine consumers choice in different settings, their awareness of<lb/> product information, their self-reported needs and objectives), and determine the extent of the issue -<lb/>firm-specific or market-wide -to define the type of response needed.<lb/></p>

			<head></head>

			<p>Step 3: Design effective interventions -ordered from least to most interventionist, behavioural<lb/> problems could be solved through 1) the provision of information in a specific way, or the prohibition<lb/> of specific marketing materials or practices; 2) changes to the choice environment; 3) the control of<lb/> product distribution and 4) the control of products, including ban on specific product features or<lb/> requirement for products to contain specific features.<lb/></p>

			<head>Inconsistencies in consumers&apos; decisions can have an impact on how markets work<lb/></head>

			<p>Behavioural economics can also be used to support competition in financial services, for the<lb/> benefit of consumers as end-users of the services.<lb/></p>

			<p>When consumers&apos; decisions are over-influenced by behavioural bias, firms do not compete on the<lb/> quality and price of their commercial offer or on the innovation or diversity of their products and<lb/> prices. They compete in ways that are not in the interest of consumers, and offer products which<lb/> appeal to them but do not fully or optimally serve their needs.<lb/></p>

			<p>While healthy competition would drive out bad options for consumers, because of consumers&apos;<lb/> irrational decision-making, markets fail to eliminate the bad options for consumers. Market forces left<lb/> to themselves will often not work to reduce these mistakes, so interventions may be needed.</p>

			<table>11<lb/> The Effective Approaches to support the implementation of the High-level Principles 12 developed<lb/> by the G20/OECD Task Force on Financial Consumer Protection, and in particular Principle 10 on<lb/> Competition recognises that: &quot; Insights provided by behavioural economics enhance understanding on<lb/> how consumers make financial decisions and the inhibitors to competitive outcomes. Behavioural<lb/> economics can assist in the design of more appropriate remedies, thus allowing more effective<lb/> promotion of competition in financial markets &quot; . This was introduced as part of the innovative or<lb/> emerging approaches to implement Principle 10.<lb/></table>

			<p>In Australia for example, the principles of behavioural economics have been used to design a<lb/> market intervention in relation to searching and comparing through the introduction of the key fact<lb/> sheet for home loans. Behavioural economics research was used to identify the nature of the<lb/> difficulties that consumers have in understanding pre-contractual documentation in relation to home<lb/> loans and how disclosure could be improved. Research also indicates that the quantity of information<lb/> can overwhelm consumers, which can encourage consumers to ignore pre-contractual disclosure<lb/> information. In France, behavioural analysis helped to develop thinking about credit insurance, which<lb/> led to a proposal to extend the period of time during which individuals can change their credit<lb/> insurance, and has more generally helped to enrich thinking on the issues linked to the ability to<lb/> terminate insurance contracts. 13<lb/></p>

			<p>Behavioural economics can therefore also play a critical role in improving the demand side of the<lb/> financial services market, by ensuring that consumer choices of services and products are made on the<lb/> basis of objective criteria which fulfil their specific needs. It will support well-functioning financial<lb/> services markets and contribute to the development of effective competition for the benefits of both<lb/> consumers and financial services providers.<lb/></p>

			<head>b)<lb/> Behavioural economics core concepts relevant for financial services<lb/></head>

			<p>As a result of the research and studies conducted so far, there exists a set of core behavioural<lb/> insights that are relevant to furthering our understanding of consumer decision making in financial<lb/> markets. It consists mainly of categories of the most commonly encountered behavioural biases and<lb/> types of mitigation responses which have proven effective in reducing the negative effects of biases.<lb/> The following list is intended as a brief description of these essential, and largely uncontroversial,<lb/> results and concepts with a view to facilitating an initial understanding of the behavioural economics<lb/> approach and its relevance to financial services. It is neither an exhaustive list nor as a specific<lb/> classification of biases or of mitigation responses. 14<lb/></p>

			<head>Types of bias<lb/></head>

			<p> Heuristics -Heuristics is a quick, informal and intuitive shortcut used to generate an<lb/> approximate answer to a reasoning question. They are most often helpful, because they help<lb/> solve a complex problem. However, if an inappropriate heuristics fails to produce a correct<lb/> judgment (rule of thumb), it can result in a (cognitive) bias.<lb/></p>

			<p> Example: allocating the pension pot equally across all investment funds available in a<lb/> pension scheme rather than making a careful allocation decision.<lb/>  Present bias -People tend to have preferences for immediate gratification. This leads them to<lb/> overvalue the present over the future, and systematically choose options which will bring<lb/> short-term benefits even though they are not the best value offers in the long-term.<lb/></p>

			<p> Example: over-borrowing, e.g. buying a tablet-PC now using a payday loan without<lb/> thinking much about the total cost.<lb/></p>

			<head> Reference dependence (or anchoring effect) and loss aversion -Consumers assess outcomes<lb/></head>

			<p>relative to a reference point and not in their own right. Their choice can be instable as it will<lb/> depend on the selected reference point. Gains and losses in particular are assessed according<lb/> to a reference point, and the same outcome can be framed as a gain or as a loss depending on<lb/> the choice of reference point. In all situations, people tend to underweight gains and<lb/> overweight losses.<lb/></p>

			<p> Example: perceiving add-on insurance as cheap because it is sold together with<lb/> something that has a comparatively much higher price.<lb/></p>

			<head> Regret and other emotions -</head>

			<p>People may act to avoid ambiguity or stress. Their choices can<lb/> also be distorted by temporary strong emotions (e.g. fear).<lb/></p>

			<p> Example: buying expensive insurance for peace of mind, even though buyers are very<lb/> unlikely to need it.<lb/></p>

			<p> Overconfidence -People tend to have excessive confidence in their own ability to successfully<lb/> perform a particular task or to make an accurate judgement, or in the likelihood of good<lb/> events.<lb/></p>

			<p> Example: excessive belief in the ability to pick winning stocks.<lb/></p>

			<p> Over-extrapolation -People often make predictions on the basis of only a few observations,<lb/> when these observations are not representative.<lb/></p>

			<p> Example: using just a few years of past returns as a basis for judging future returns and<lb/> making investment decisions, without considering the extent to which past returns reflect<lb/> chance and particular circumstances.<lb/></p>

			<p> Projection bias -People have a tendency to believe that their choices and preferences will<lb/> remain the same over time, and that there is only little room for change.<lb/></p>

			<p> Example: tying up funds in long-term contracts without adequately considering the<lb/> chance of needing money in difficult circumstances before the contract matures, or not<lb/> realising that difficulties could arise in controlling the future credit card spending.<lb/>  Mental accounting -Mental accounting describes how consumers tend to label money<lb/> according to how they intend to use it, and behave differently with their different types of<lb/> &quot; accounts &quot; .<lb/></p>

			<p> Example: people may save at a low rate while borrowing at a high rate.<lb/></p>

			<p> Narrow bracketing -Narrow bracketing refers to the fact that people often take decisions in<lb/> isolation, without giving consideration to their global (financial) context and risk exposure.<lb/></p>

			<p> Example: making investment decisions asset-by-asset rather than considering the whole<lb/> portfolio.<lb/></p>

			<head> Persuasion and social influence -Consumers may</head>

			<p>allow themselves to be persuaded or trust<lb/> the sales person because he or she comes across as &apos;likeable&apos; and therefore trustworthy.<lb/></p>

			<p>Emphasising good personality traits or overemphasising bad personality traits may substitute<lb/> for a reasoned judgement.<lb/></p>

			<p> Example: relying on financial advice without giving thought to the effect of commission<lb/> or other economic incentives for the adviser on the advice received.<lb/></p>

			<p> Endowment effect -The endowment effect (or status quo bias) is the fact that people often<lb/> demand much more to give up an object than they would be willing to pay to acquire it.<lb/></p>

			<p> Example: consumers refusing or being reluctant to switch financial provider or bank,<lb/> although they know that the product or service provided is not tailored to their specific<lb/> needs.<lb/></p>

			<head>Types of mitigation responses to bias<lb/></head>

			<p>Choice architecture and framing -The concept of choice architecture was introduced by Thaler<lb/> and Sunstein (2008) and refers to the decision-making environment where many features, noticed and<lb/> unnoticed, can influence decisions. Choice architecture can be used to help individuals make better<lb/> choices (as judged by decision-makers themselves) without forcing certain outcomes upon anyone<lb/> ( &quot; libertarian paternalism &quot; ). The number of choices presented, the manner in which attributes are<lb/> described, the presence of a &quot; default &quot; option are amongst the elements with can impact choices. This<lb/> approach seeks to design an environment in which better choice for consumers can be made to be the<lb/> easier choice. Framing is part of the overall concept of choice architecture and describes how people<lb/> tend to reach different conclusions or make different choices depending on how a situation or options<lb/> are presented to them. Framing includes multiple aspects:<lb/>  Default option -Presenting one choice as a default or pre-set option can induce consumers to<lb/> choose that option, as a way to avoid the costs of making a decision, or assuming that whoever<lb/> set the default knew more about what is the right decision to make.<lb/></p>

			<p> Example: automatic enrolment of employees in pension schemes through a pre-selected<lb/> option.<lb/></p>

			<p> Attribute framing -Attribute framing involves influencing people&apos;s judgment of an object or<lb/> event by describing it in a positive or a negative manner, while its objective value remains<lb/> constant. The object or event will be evaluated more favourably when presented in a positive<lb/> frame than when presented more negatively.<lb/></p>

			<p> Example: informing consumers that they will pay a 3 000 EUR up-front charge as<lb/> opposed to 3% when deciding whether or not to invest 100 000 EUR into an investment<lb/> product.<lb/></p>

			<p> Salience effect -The salience effect will focus consumers&apos; attention on the particularly<lb/> important aspects of a situation, which can then have a marked influence on choice. Even if<lb/> information is standardised, a limited amount of simple text, meaningful numbers prominently<lb/> displayed and in the right order can have a large effect when consumers compare options.<lb/></p>

			<p> Example: limiting the information provided to the most important features of a given<lb/> financial product perceived as complex (e.g. mortgage or consumer credit), and<lb/> providing pre-calculated and directly comparable relevant information.<lb/></p>

			<head>Research methods<lb/></head>

			<p>As briefly outlined above (see section B.a.), behavioural economics research often makes use of<lb/> randomised controlled trials, which can either be performed in a laboratory, in which participants are<lb/> placed in a simulated environment where all factors affecting decision makers in a given situation can<lb/> be fully controlled, or in a real-life environment through a field experiment. The researcher can in<lb/> general draw statistically significant results from relatively small samples. RCTs involve two groups,<lb/> the control group and the treatment group. Individuals or groups of people receiving both interventions<lb/> are chosen at random and are as closely matched as possible. The control group receives the<lb/> equivalent of a placebo (i.e. nothing is changed substantially), while the treatment group faces<lb/> something new. Often researchers will want to know which of two or more interventions is the most<lb/> effective at attaining a specific, measurable outcome. Running tests with as many treatment groups as<lb/> there are researched options will lead to the identification of causal relationships. It will also help<lb/> confirm that the envisaged intervention is the best suited to solve the problem identified and that<lb/> robust measures are in place to evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention (UK Cabinet Office<lb/> Behavioural Insights Team, 2012).<lb/></p>

			<figure>Box 2. PRICE Lab: an experiment on how consumers value and compare complex products in Ireland<lb/> Since January 2013, the Central Bank of Ireland has become involved in a three-year multi-partner<lb/> research programme initiative which tests how consumers value and compare complex products. This initiative,<lb/> established by the Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI) Programme of Research Investigating<lb/> Consumer Evaluation (PRICE) Lab, is jointly funded by the Central Bank, the Competition and Consumer<lb/> Protection Commission (merger of the former National Consumer Agency and Competition Authority), the<lb/> Commission for Energy Regulation and Commission for Communications Regulation. The programme is<lb/> overseen by a Steering Group comprising representatives of each of the four funding partners, an independent<lb/> international academic expert, a senior representative from the ESRI and the Principal Investigator.<lb/></figure>

			<p>PRICE Lab is using computerised experiments (using hypothetical products) to investigate how samples of<lb/> Irish consumers initially learn to value a new product (using varied types and numbers of attributes, which give it<lb/> an overall value). It repeated the experiments using real products (including financial and other products) in<lb/> 2015. The aim of the research is to provide empirical findings of use to policymakers in the areas of consumer<lb/> and competition policy.<lb/></p>

			<head>D.<lb/> Applications in the financial services field<lb/></head>

			<p>Behavioural economics is of relevance across a range of financial sectors and activities (banking,<lb/> investment, pensions, insurance, securities, etc.). Sectoral initiatives have also been taken to analyse<lb/> particular consumer traits in a given field and explore potential behavioural remedies, for example in<lb/> the specific context of financial education. A number of jurisdictions and agencies which are members<lb/> of the Task Force on Financial Consumer Protection have conducted behavioural economics research<lb/> in the field of financial services, developed policy papers or initiated policy or regulatory work based<lb/> on behavioural insights.<lb/> This section reviews recent work undertaken by financial regulators, which has either been<lb/> recorded and/or published, highlighting the main results and lessons learnt.<lb/></p>

			<p>The different initiatives are presented under three generic and broad categories of biases. 15 Since<lb/> decision-making is generally influenced by a combination of various factors, many of the examples<lb/> could however fall under more than one category.<lb/> It is important to keep in mind that many of the current behavioural insights are prospective at<lb/> this stage. The few regulatory or policy initiatives that are explicitly based on behavioural economic<lb/> findings are fairly new. There is not yet any evidence about their long-term impact, and they have not<lb/> yet been properly evaluated following implementation.<lb/></p>

			<head>Impediments to effectively using information<lb/> The European Commission conducted a pilot study on consumer decision-making in retail<lb/> investment services</head>

			<figure>in 2010 to observe through laboratory experiments how consumers reacted when<lb/> faced with a choice between different investment products and how they were affected by financial<lb/> advice. 16<lb/></figure>

			<p>The study found that people struggled to make optimal investment choices even in the most<lb/> simplified of environments. It also confirmed that features of the retail investment market may make<lb/> consumer decisions particularly prone to biases and framing effects: subjects made worse investment<lb/> decisions when the optimal choice was harder to understand (fees framed as percentages, annual<lb/> returns not compounded over the duration of the investment), and they were disproportionately averse<lb/> to uncertainty (risky investments), ambiguity (incomplete information) and product complexity<lb/> (structured products). Standardising and reducing the amount of information provided helped subjects<lb/> identify the optimal choice between similar investments. Providing comparable pre-calculated<lb/> information on the net expected value of each investment helped subjects identify the optimal choice<lb/> between dissimilar investments.<lb/> The European Commission used the results of this study as part of its proposals to regulate the<lb/> sale of Packaged Retail and Insurance-based Investment Products (PRIIPS). 17 The provision of a &quot; Key<lb/> Information Document &quot; (KID) to all potential buyers of investment products is part of the 2012<lb/> proposal for regulation. This KID will present short and plain-speaking information about the<lb/> investment product in a format easy to understand. Every manufacturer of investment products (e.g.<lb/> investment fund managers, insurers, banks) will have to produce such a document for each investment<lb/> product. Each KID will contain information on the product&apos;s main features, as well as the risks and<lb/> costs associated with the investment in that product. Information on risks will be as straight-forward<lb/> and comparable as possible, without over-simplifying often complex products. The KID will make<lb/> clear to every consumer whether or not they could lose money with a certain product and how<lb/> complex the product is. The KIDs will follow a common standard for the structure, content, and<lb/> presentation. It is intended that in this way, consumers will be able to use the document to compare<lb/> different investment products and ultimately choose the product that best suits their needs.<lb/> To ensure that the detailed rules on presenting the information in KIDs under the PRIIPS<lb/> Regulation achieve the objective to best help consumers compare and select products for their<lb/> investment needs, the European Commission has conducted a further dedicated consumer testing<lb/> study. 18 The study used broad quantitative surveys supplemented by qualitative testing with focus<lb/> groups, across a representative sample of countries in the EU. The objective was not only to gather<lb/> consumer&apos;s preferences, but also objective insights on how far presentations aided a correct<lb/> understanding of the feature of PRIIPs and comparisons between them. To do this, many different<lb/> options for presenting risk, performance and cost information were examined.<lb/></p>

			<p>The study showed that a graphic and streamlined presentation of risks using a single scale with<lb/> classes running from one to seven worked best. It also supported simpler presentations of performance<lb/> and costs information, including the use of tables. The testing clarified that while some respondents<lb/> expressed a preference for seeing detailed information, simpler information was in reality more<lb/> effective for understanding and comparisons.<lb/></p>

			<p>The study results will feed directly into the work by the three European Supervisory Authorities 19<lb/> on developing technical standards to set the further specifications of the details of the format and<lb/> content of the KID that they are elaborating. The study will ensure that European Consumers will<lb/> benefit from being provided KIDs that will explain the often complicated investment products in a<lb/> truly user-friendly way.<lb/></p>

			<p>Regarding advised retail investment decisions and the disclosure of potential conflicts of interest,<lb/> the 2010 experiment showed in particular that the existence of a conflict of interest in the remit of the<lb/> advisor needs to be strongly emphasised ( &quot; health warning &quot; ) and its implications explicitly laid out (for<lb/> example, through the exact details of the advisor&apos;s remuneration structure), in order to impact people&apos;s<lb/> decisions. Disclosing conflicts of interest elicited a &quot; knee-jerk &quot; reaction when biased incentives were<lb/> disclosed. This led to better decisions when the advisor&apos;s and advisee&apos;s interests were adversely<lb/> aligned but worse decisions when their interests were aligned. Subjects lost trust even when an advisor<lb/> with misaligned incentives was not actually able to deceive them, showing that their reaction is<lb/> reflexive. The European Commission indicates that the provision of the new Regulation on better<lb/> disclosures about the features, risks and costs of products through the KID, and the overall improved<lb/> transparency of the investments themselves, will help enhance the quality and neutrality of advice 20 .<lb/></p>

			<head>The Central Bank of Ireland conducted a review into the provision of annual statements to<lb/> consumers by life assurance firms,</head>

			<p>outlining the position of their investment product 21 . The purpose<lb/> was to establish how life assurance firms were complying with the new annual format required by the<lb/> 2012 Consumer Protection Code, for personal pension products. The review covered the 10 largest life<lb/> assurance firms in Ireland. Overall, the Central Bank found that the vast majority of firms were in<lb/> compliance, but also identified a small number of examples of firms failing to produce new format<lb/> statements for pension policies. Where this was identified, firms were required to submit<lb/> 18 Consumer testing study of the possible new format and content for retail disclosures of packaged retail and<lb/> insurance-based investment products: http:</p>

			<table>//ec.europa.eu/finance/finservices-<lb/>retail/investment_products/index_en.htm#2015-consumer-testing-study<lb/> 19 The European Banking Authority (EBA); the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA); and the<lb/> European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA)<lb/> 20 The PRIIPS Regulation introducing the KID will become applicable as of 31 December 2016.<lb/> 21 Review of Annual Personal Pension Statements, Central Bank of Ireland, 2014<lb/> implementation timelines for full compliance and commit to ensuring that all personal pension plan<lb/> consumers, regardless of when the policy was sold, would receive a new format annual statement.<lb/></table>

			<p>The Central Bank also asked consumers, via focus groups, to identify what was working well in<lb/> terms of disclosure and where improvements to the annual statements could be made. Consumers in<lb/> the focus groups said that the following would be of benefit:<lb/>  the use of &quot; plain English &quot; and clear distinct headings in the presentation of the statement<lb/>  details of the projected retirement income expressed as a monetary value, with information on<lb/> what they could expect to get from their pension product when they retired<lb/>  information on the investment funds, including risk and the type of fund to be clearly<lb/> highlighted on the statement including the location of the investments (for example, one firm<lb/> provided clear details of the different funds that the consumer&apos;s policy was invested in,<lb/> including the percentage breakdown of the investments under a separate heading titled<lb/> &quot; Investment Details &quot; )<lb/>  historical information on the performance of the policy (for example, one firm provided a<lb/> statement with numerical information across the full duration of the pension policy)<lb/>  an indication on the annual statement of contribution gaps for the previous 12 months, as<lb/> opposed to the current practice which includes these notifications in separate communications<lb/>  a link to a pension calculator so consumers can see whether they will have enough money<lb/> built up in their fund for when they retire<lb/>  charges to be broken down into a euro value in the annual statement, and for all fees and<lb/> charges to be provided in one location with a monetary total<lb/>  an indication regarding consumers&apos; eligibility for state pension.<lb/></p>

			<p>The findings from the focus group discussions were communicated to the life insurance firms<lb/> reviewed, with an invitation to consider them in their communication with their personal pension plan<lb/> and other investment customers.<lb/></p>

			<p>In 2015, the UK Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) undertook a survey to investigate how well<lb/> consumers understand and value structured deposits, a class of complex products. 22 The FCA<lb/> conducted a behavioural experiment involving more than 380 retail investors who had previously<lb/> bought or would consider buying structured deposits or other structured products. Investors were<lb/> shown hypothetical examples of five popular types of products with returns linked to the performance<lb/> of the FTSE100 stock index. Investors&apos; expectations about FTSE100 returns were compared with the<lb/> returns they expected from different structured products. Biases in how respondents evaluate the<lb/> structured deposits relative to the index could then be calculated. Investors were asked to rank the<lb/> structured deposits against a range of fixed rate deposits and taking into account the risk of return of<lb/> the different structured deposits. The impact of various types of disclosure on respondents&apos; valuations<lb/> was also examined.<lb/> The main findings of the experience showed that:<lb/>  While investors&apos; expectations of the FTSE growth were on average well aligned with the<lb/> assumptions of the model, investors significantly overestimated the expected returns of all<lb/> structured deposits, including the most simple. Their expectations were also significantly<lb/> higher than returns from the quantitative model.<lb/></p>

			<figure> Although all five structured deposits would have been unlikely to return more than simple<lb/> fixed-term cash deposits, respondents did not recognise this. Investors required relatively high<lb/> rates of return on risk-free cash deposits to value them over and above structured deposits.<lb/></figure>

			<p> The disclosure of likely product returns and risk had some effect on investors&apos; ability to adjust<lb/> for initial incorrect valuations. Investors who had initially overestimated returns or<lb/> underestimated risk of return were more likely to adjust their valuations following further<lb/> information.<lb/></p>

			<p> Giving the investors information on what would happen under hypothetical scenarios had little<lb/> effect on product revaluation, while quantitative model returns -telling investors what likely<lb/> product returns are based on the quantitative model -induced a larger devaluation of<lb/> structured deposits. The relatively minor adjustment of valuations by investors (0.41%) shows<lb/> the need to be cautious about what can be achieved through providing information.<lb/></p>

			<head>In New Zealand, research on behavioural economics</head>

			<p>identified the main implications for the<lb/> development of policy for financial product disclosure, with a focus on investment products. 23 The<lb/> conclusions from this work were that disclosures are most effective at aiding investor decision making<lb/> when they are:<lb/>  Short and simple -research highlights the importance of keeping disclosure documents brief<lb/> and straightforward to address issues of choice and information overload and the difficulties<lb/> that many investors can have with complex and technical information.<lb/></p>

			<p> Standardised -many biases, limitations and heuristics can be mitigated through standardising<lb/> the content of disclosures. Standardisation also aids the comparability of information.<lb/></p>

			<head> Clear about risks and benefits</head>

			<p>-disclosure of risk is necessary to address potential issues of<lb/> overconfidence and appropriate disclosure of benefits is necessary to overcome status quo bias<lb/> and loss aversion.<lb/></p>

			<p> Meaningful -information needs to be put in context and presented in a way that is meaningful<lb/> for investors. The more that information can be put in a form that people relate to, the more<lb/> likely they are to understand it.<lb/>  Well presented -information needs to be presented in a way that makes people want to read<lb/> disclosure documents and that aids decision making. How options or prospects are framed in<lb/> disclosure documents can elicit emotional responses and influence the decisions made. The<lb/> use of graphs and other visual representations can assist in the understanding of complex<lb/> information, but need to be designed with care.<lb/></p>

			<p> Tested on investors -research indicates that people can act in unexpected ways. Even small<lb/> changes to the way that information is presented can influence how people perceive or<lb/> interpret information.<lb/></p>

			<p>The report also highlights that it is important that key behavioural insights are seen in the broader<lb/> context of what a disclosure regime seeks to achieve (for example, a short and succinct document is<lb/> not an end in itself if it fails to convey the necessary information), in order to effectively aid investors&apos;<lb/> understanding and decision making.<lb/></p>

			<head>In terms of investor education, the International Organisation of Securities Commissions<lb/> (IOSCO) has identified practices</head>

			<figure>to help guide members in developing and enhancing their own<lb/> investor education and financial literacy programmes. 24 The report includes, in particular:<lb/>  A list of behavioural responses in financial decision-making that have important implications<lb/> for the design of investor education and financial literacy strategies (Appendix 2).<lb/>  A behavioural economics literature review with a specific focus on financial education<lb/> (Appendix 3).<lb/></figure>

			<head>Influences on behaviour and perception<lb/></head>

			<p>In Italy, the financial regulator Consob reviewed questionnaires used by 20 investment firms to<lb/> assess their potential clients&apos; risk attitude before proposing an investment product. The objective was<lb/> to identify major shortcomings, based, in particular, on behavioural insights, and suggest<lb/> improvements. 25<lb/></p>

			<p>The study concludes that several limitations affect the content of the questionnaires used, in<lb/> particular:<lb/></p>

			<p> Questions used to assess customers&apos; investment knowledge and experience are poor: they<lb/> often rely on individuals&apos; self-evaluation and are not aimed at verifying familiarity with basic<lb/> notions like the relationship between risk and expected return and portfolio diversification.<lb/></p>

			<p> Consumers&apos; risk attitude is generally elicited jointly with preferences on the time horizon and<lb/> investment aims. This format has been criticised, in particular by behavioural economists,<lb/> because risk preferences and the risk profile should be assessed independently from the other<lb/> elements which must be gathered when formulating an investment recommendation, since<lb/> each of these variables is influenced by</p>

			<table>different factors (for example, risk preferences and<lb/> risk profile are attributable to sociometric, psychological and behavioural factors, while the<lb/> 24 Strategic framework for investor education and financial literacy, IOSCO, CR03/14, 2014<lb/> 25 Assessing investors&apos; risk tolerance through a questionnaire, Consob Italy, 2012<lb/> time horizon and investment objectives depend on economic and financial factors, the level of<lb/> impatience, etc.).<lb/></table>

			<p> The way questions on risk attitude are worded lacks the stylistic and lexical devices which,<lb/> according to behavioural finance, may be useful in enhancing the reliability of the answers<lb/> potentially affected by the client&apos;s cognitive and behavioural biases.<lb/></p>

			<p>An example of a behavioural experiment undertaken by the FCA UK formed part of its market<lb/> study on general insurance products commonly sold as add-ons, i.e. general insurance sold alongside<lb/> other (primary) products either at the same time or subsequently, like travel insurance sold alongside a<lb/> holiday. 26<lb/></p>

			<p>The study investigated whether there were common patterns across add-on markets that<lb/> weakened competition and drove poor consumer outcomes. As part of the experiment, variations were<lb/> introduced on the sales and price formats and the point at which add-ons were proposed (standalone<lb/> insurance, add-on upfront alongside the primary product, add-on revealed only at point of sale for the<lb/> primary product). This helped identify the effects on the extent and effectiveness of shopping around<lb/> and on the add-on take up.<lb/> Amongst the main findings of the study:<lb/>  The complexity of comparing multiple prices (of the primary and the add-on products) at the<lb/> same time without a clear total did not discourage consumers from shopping around for<lb/> insurance, although it made them slightly less willing to look at primary product alternatives.<lb/> However, added complexity -even without delaying the introduction of the add-on until the<lb/> point of sale -made consumers much more likely to be unable to identify the best deals<lb/> available to them.<lb/>  Lower transparency due to add-ons being revealed only at the point of sale significantly<lb/> exacerbates poor consumer outcomes. This element of the add-on mechanism was the most<lb/> consistent in producing material detrimental effects on the outcome metrics studied in the<lb/> experiment -including shopping around, prices paid and the quality of consumers&apos; decisions.<lb/></p>

			<p> Monthly pricing for annual contracts was another mechanism that had consistent, if smaller,<lb/> detrimental effects across most types of outcomes. Surprisingly, however, even though<lb/> presenting prices in monthly terms reduced the extent and effectiveness of shopping around,<lb/> the fact that insurance &apos;looked cheaper&apos; did not have an effect on consumers&apos; willingness to<lb/> buy it overall.<lb/>  Consumers are, in principle, willing to engage with stand-alone alternatives when those are<lb/> easy to access at the point of sale, and benefit considerably from doing this. However, the<lb/> beneficial effects start to diminish quickly when there are barriers to accessing those<lb/> alternatives, even if these barriers are much smaller than the ones consumers face in real life.<lb/> Overall, the FCA UK concluded that the add-on mechanism weakens consumers&apos; ability to<lb/> discipline firms by shopping around and comparing products effectively. Areas which are being<lb/> looked at for remedies include: a ban on pre-ticked boxes to challenge consumer inertia, publication of<lb/> claims ratios to reduce information asymmetries, and improvements to the way add-ons are offered<lb/> through price-comparison sites.<lb/> In Australia, the Australian Securities and Investment Commission (ASIC) embarked on a<lb/> laboratory experiment which aimed at exploring how behavioural biases may influence preferences<lb/> towards hybrid securities over the less complex financial products of bonds and shares. 27 Participants<lb/> were asked to invest 100 units between three investment options for 10 years, and were informed that<lb/> they would be paid on the outcome of their investment. In each of the experiments, the government<lb/> bond option was provided as a default low risk option and 5 out of the 6 possible choices also offered<lb/> company shares. The expected interest rate/dividend between three options was altered (3.75%,<lb/> 4.75%, and 5.75% per annum). Findings show that the behavioural biases and risk attitudes that<lb/> influence investment in hybrid securities include:<lb/>  the illusion of control that investors can exert over their environment and influence the<lb/> outcomes. In the context of hybrid securities, it meant that consumers believed they could<lb/> withdraw &quot; in time &quot; from their investment.<lb/></p>

			<p> investors&apos; overconfidence on their ability to withdraw from an investment early and<lb/> consequently be protected from risks<lb/>  a framing bias regarding the formulation of the choice in favour of hybrid securities. Many of<lb/> the risks of hybrid securities are not immediately apparent, which makes the risk/return trade-<lb/>off more appealing than shares and bonds<lb/>  &quot; ambiguity aversion &quot; or a preference of known risks over unknown risks. Ambiguity averse<lb/> participants preferred &quot; higher yet familiar &quot; risk of investing in shares to &quot; lower but less<lb/> understood &quot; risk of investing in hybrids.<lb/></p>

			<p> investors&apos; risk perception and attitudes. Hybrids were seen to be riskier than shares and bonds<lb/> on two counts: distrust of issuers/products and poor knowledge of the product. However,<lb/> acknowledging the difficulty in understanding hybrid securities did not deter participants from<lb/> buying them.<lb/></p>

			<p>The familiarity of the brand of issuers did not affect investment in hybrids, which may indicate<lb/> that where information is provided in a succinct and standardised manner, the effect of a brand name<lb/> may be negligible.<lb/></p>

			<head>Presentation factors that affect decision-making<lb/></head>

			<p>The FCA UK has conducted a research on how to encourage consumers to claim redress<lb/> following the mis-selling of financial products. 28 Work was conducted on a real case, with a firm that<lb/> voluntarily wrote to almost 200 000 customers about a failing of its sales process. Mis-sold customers<lb/> needed to answer questions raised in the letter to get redress. The firm&apos;s original letter, written in good<lb/> faith, had a very low response rate. Different potential improvements to the firm&apos;s letter were tested<lb/> using an RCT, with a view to increasing the level of customers&apos; response. The letter was modified<lb/> with simple amendments, including reducing the amount of text, explaining to readers that the claims&apos;<lb/> process would only take five minutes, putting the main thrust of the message in bullets at the top of the<lb/> letter, adding an &quot; act quickly &quot; label on the envelope and the FSA logo on the letter and replacing the<lb/> generic &quot; Customer Team &quot; signature by the CEO&apos;s. Reminders were also sent.<lb/> Overall, the rate of responses jumped by over 10%. Individually:<lb/>  Salient bullets had the largest single effect.<lb/></p>

			<figure> Simplification and claims process almost doubled the response rate.<lb/>  The label on the envelope had only a small positive effect.<lb/>  There was no impact of the FSA logo.<lb/>  The reminder had clear interaction effects.<lb/></figure>

			<p>Unexpectedly, there was a small but statistically significant decrease in response using the CEO&apos;s<lb/> signature.<lb/></p>

			<head>The FCA has undertaken an analysis of holders of savings accounts with short-term high interest<lb/> rates</head>

			<p>who do not transfer their money when the rate falls because of behavioural biases, such as<lb/> undervaluing long-term gains relative to short-term costs (present bias) or paying insufficient attention<lb/> to their savings choices (limited attention). 29 The FCA has carried out a trial in partnership with a large<lb/> UK financial institution involving over 20 000 savings account customers whose interest rate was<lb/> about to decrease or had just decreased. All of these customers had already received a letter two to<lb/> three months before the rate decrease informing them of this. The paper investigates the effects on<lb/> switching behaviour of an additional letter, different messages in the reminder and the timing of the<lb/> reminder.<lb/></p>

			<head>Results show that:<lb/></head>

			<p> Reminders make a notable difference to switching behaviour around the time of interest rate<lb/> decreases. The very fact of getting a reminder is more important than the precise phrasing of<lb/> the reminder.<lb/></p>

			<p> Customers who received a reminder in which the cash loss from not switching accounts was<lb/> salient (i.e. &apos;£X less interest per year&apos;) or in which the cash gain was salient (i.e. &apos;Move your<lb/> savings and earn up to £X more&apos;), among other changes, were slightly more likely to switch or<lb/> transfer money than those who received a reminder without any particular emphasis.<lb/></p>

			<p> Sending a reminder letter before the interest rate decrease increased switching compared with<lb/> not sending a reminder. While switching to a comparable account within the firm decreased,<lb/> moving money elsewhere -switching to a different firm or other behaviour -increased.<lb/></p>

			<p> Sending a reminder after the rate decrease also led to more switching compared with not<lb/> sending a reminder, but only by encouraging customers to open a new comparable account<lb/> with the same firm. It had no detectable effect on switching or transferring elsewhere.<lb/>  While customers over 60 years old or with balances above the median were more likely to<lb/> switch in general, reminders increased the rate of switching across all customers including<lb/> younger customers and those with lower balances.<lb/></p>

			<p>In the context of a potential Competition and Markets Authority investigation into personal<lb/> current accounts, the FCA in 2015 wanted to understand the impact of previous initiatives that were<lb/> intended to help consumers manage their current accounts -provision of annual summaries of any<lb/> charges, refunds or interest, access to text alerts on account balance levels and charges, as well as to<lb/> mobile apps which allow consumers to spend, save and check their balances on-the-go</p>

			<head>. 30<lb/></head>

			<p>Using statistical analysis of data from two large banks, including granular data on 500 000<lb/> customers from one bank, the study shows that:<lb/></p>

			<p> Annual summaries, as designed by the banks looked at, have no effect on consumer behaviour<lb/> in terms of incurring overdraft charges, altering balance levels or switching to other current<lb/> account providers.<lb/>  Signing up to text alerts or mobile banking apps reduces the amount of unarranged overdraft<lb/> charges incurred.<lb/>  Signing up to both services has an additional effect, and shows the benefit of receiving<lb/> information upon automatic triggers, without having to actively acquire it, as well as the<lb/> facility to act quickly upon receiving information. Text alerts and mobile banking apps also<lb/> decrease average current account balances, which is beneficial for consumers as they reduce<lb/> the cost of holding balances in accounts with no (or low) credit interest. Consumers who sign<lb/> up to these services are also more likely to become inactive at their bank, which is measured<lb/> using the number and value of consumers&apos; credits and debits per month. This suggests that<lb/> these services facilitate banking with multiple providers.<lb/></p>

			<head>E.<lb/> Application in developing economies<lb/></head>

			<p>The application of behavioural insights in emerging markets and developing economies is<lb/> especially important, due to the nature of both the financial markets of those countries (e.g. fast pace<lb/> of innovation) and many of their financial consumers (large part of first time users of formal finance,<lb/> impact of having a low and variable income). Studies conducted so far identify the areas which are<lb/> most affected by consumers&apos; biases and could require some policy interventions. They also confirm<lb/> (see footnote 5) that financial institutions and bank staff can be biased, and this will potentially impact<lb/> the service provided to consumers.<lb/></p>

			<figure>In 2014, the Consultative Group to Assist the Poor (CGAP) produced a paper focused on<lb/> emerging markets and developing economies and presents early evidence on some of the most relevant<lb/> behavioural insights in those markets with high concentration of base-of-the-pyramid (BOP)<lb/> consumers. 31 The paper explores how behavioural research can offer important tools for effective<lb/> policy-making.<lb/></figure>

			<p>Four priority consumer protection topics with specific implications in BOP settings were<lb/> reviewed: disclosure, transparency, and product choice; complaints handling and recourse; credit<lb/> market regulation and debt stress; and fair treatment.<lb/> CGAP notes that knowledge and experience on which approaches will work best to protect<lb/> financial consumers is very limited at this time. However, evidence suggests the power of several key<lb/> behavioural concepts to improve outcomes:<lb/></p>

			<p> Scarcity -Many cognitive biases tend to be widespread and do not align neatly with the<lb/> socioeconomic context. However, there is a need to generate and apply insights into the role<lb/> scarcity plays in financial and other decisions taken by many BOP consumers, and design<lb/> policies that factor in its effects.<lb/></p>

			<head> Improved information for consumer choice and use</head>

			<p>-Increasing the volume of information<lb/> provided to consumers is not always the best way to facilitate decision-making and<lb/> understanding. Two alternatives should be considered: putting in place measures such as<lb/> default options that nudge consumer behaviour and improve outcomes, and simplifying the<lb/> information available to consumers and/or choices that would improve the effectiveness of<lb/> consumers&apos; comparison, selection, and use of financial products.<lb/></p>

			<p> Salience -Financial information should be made more relevant to a consumer&apos;s personal<lb/> context to improve their understanding and decision-making. Connections to different points<lb/> in a consumer&apos;s daily activities or lifecycle events can make information more meaningful,<lb/> increase their receptivity to the messages, and bring greater changes in their behaviour.<lb/></p>

			<head> The intention-action gap</head>

			<p>-Research should be undertaken to understand how contextual issues<lb/> -both perceived and subconscious -contribute to gaps in individuals&apos; preferences and<lb/> decisions and the behaviours they exhibit. This analysis should be used to design policy<lb/> measures that tackle the underlying issues.<lb/></p>

			<p> Drivers of provider behaviour -Factors that affect the behaviour of financial service providers<lb/> and their staff, which may in turn reflect a complicated mix of short-term incentives as well as<lb/> their perceptions of consumers should be explored. This would help design policy measures<lb/> that shift providers&apos; behaviour and incentives and produce better long-run outcomes for<lb/> consumers (and often for providers, too).<lb/> The CGAP paper clarifies that it only offers some starting hypotheses on how behavioural biases<lb/> may shape consumer protection problems and potential solutions, while stressing the importance of<lb/> sourcing and applying insights specific to each market and key consumer segments within those<lb/> markets. It adds that it is critical to increase experimentation with behaviourally informed consumer<lb/> protection policy-making in emerging markets and developing economies, and to build better tools and<lb/> a stronger evidence base.<lb/></p>

			<figure>F.<lb/> Opportunities and challenges for the application of behavioural insights in the field of<lb/> financial services<lb/></figure>

			<head>Key elements for an optimal application of a behavioural approach in the field of financial services<lb/></head>

			<p>Efficient application of a behavioural economics approach to financial services requires that<lb/> regulators and policy-makers have an extensive knowledge of the main biases leading consumers to<lb/> make mistakes of judgement and that they are able to identify the products/services causing the main<lb/> problems. They must also define the most appropriate response to the problems identified. A<lb/> behavioural approach will only bring possible solutions to problems caused by the psychological<lb/> aspects of the decision-making process of consumers. It is not intended to solve problems it is not<lb/> meant to address.<lb/> Behaviourally-inspired solutions should therefore be used as complements, not as alternatives, to<lb/> existing initiatives. They are an additional tool for policy-makers, regulators and supervisors, in order<lb/> to make public interventions more flexible and less stringent, but more effective (FCA, 2013). The<lb/> asymmetry of information between financial institutions or intermediaries and consumers still needs to<lb/> be addressed and it is important that strict requirements are imposed to financial services providers.<lb/> But it was evidenced that the mandatory disclosure of extensive information, by itself, cannot cater for<lb/> the various needs of consumers. The extent, the format, the point at which the information has to be<lb/> delivered, and the moment when it needs to reach the consumer also need to be carefully considered,<lb/> possibly through tools using nudges and other framing effects.<lb/> Behavioural economics should be integrated into the broader context of the policy/regulatory<lb/> analysis, and the overall impact of the set of measures has to be assessed, with particular regard to<lb/> their likely effectiveness in the long-term and their impact on innovation. The other (structural or<lb/> systematic) problems of the market should also be considered, and the package of solutions/corrective<lb/> measures in one field should not have any unintended negative effects on any other field (FCA, 2013).<lb/></p>

			<head>Challenges for regulators and policy-makers<lb/></head>

			<p>The results of behavioural economics studies and research are/have been (mis)used or utilised by<lb/> firms, including financial institutions, to trigger or exacerbate consumers&apos; biases. Product design,<lb/> marketing techniques or sales processes sometimes build on consumers&apos; misbeliefs and intuitive<lb/> judgements and decision making to enhance sales and profits. There is a need to work with firms to<lb/> demonstrate and convince them that &quot; de-biasing &quot; consumers is also in their best interests, as it will<lb/> stimulate fair and open market competition (<ref type="biblio">Van Bavel et al., 2013</ref>).<lb/> The &quot; paternalistic &quot; approach induced by behavioural economics has to be used with care, and in<lb/> this respect, reservations on the whole behavioural economics approach have been expressed (for<lb/> example <ref type="biblio">Loewenstein and Hubel, 2010</ref>). Introducing a behavioural approach to regulation and policy-<lb/>making raises fundamental questions for regulators and policy-makers: can they or should they decide<lb/> or determine what is in consumers&apos; best interests? To what extent and when can they advise<lb/> consumers on what is good for them? To what extent would this approach respect consumers&apos; freedom<lb/> of choice and freedom to make mistakes? It seems that there are two limits. Firstly, that the<lb/> consumer&apos;s errors have not occurred due to misleading or unfair practices of providers, and secondly<lb/> that the sum of individual consumers&apos; misbehaviours does not negatively affect the economy as a<lb/> whole (financial crisis). Reasonable consumer choices should not be questioned and this supposes that<lb/> what consumers really value is well known and understood.<lb/></p>

			<p>There might be a need for principles and guidelines which the policy-makers and regulators<lb/> should follow to better incorporate behavioural insights into their initiatives.<lb/></p>

			<head>G.<lb/> Conclusions<lb/></head>

			<p>Financial decisions involve making difficult choices that often impact the wellbeing of consumers<lb/> and of their families over the long-term. As many other choices made by human beings, those<lb/> decisions are not always consistent and rational. Getting a better understanding of consumers&apos;<lb/> decision-making processes is therefore important to mitigate the influence of the behavioural biases<lb/> known to (negatively) influence economic and financial decisions.<lb/></p>

			<p>Behavioural economics research has shown that measures informed by consumers&apos; biases and<lb/> resulting behaviours can have a positive effect on the efficiency of the regulatory and policy<lb/> framework.<lb/></p>

			<head>As stated in the Effective approaches to support the implementation of the G20/OECD High<lb/> Level Principles on Financial Consumer Protection, regulators and supervisors can use the insights<lb/> gained through behavioural economics research to inform their approach to potential remedies to<lb/> help consumers.<lb/></head>

			<p>The G20/OECD Task Force on Financial Consumer Protection supports the need for further work<lb/> and analysis to explore the benefits and the challenges of adopting a behavioural economics approach<lb/> to policy, regulation and supervision, with a view to improving the outcomes for the consumers of<lb/> financial products and services.<lb/></p>

			<p>The existing corpus of behavioural economics research shows that behaviourally-inspired policy<lb/> and regulatory and supervisory responses have a positive effect on the efficiency and effectiveness of<lb/> national consumer protection frameworks. A number of initiatives led by Task Force Members have<lb/> confirmed the promising results of using behavioural economic insights to design specific<lb/> interventions which can act as additional tools to more conventional &quot; hard &quot; legislative interventionist<lb/> measures.<lb/> At this early stage of the implementation of behavioural economics solutions to financial<lb/> consumer protection problems, there is a need to initiate an exchange of experiences and of good<lb/> practices not only within the G20/OECD Task Force on Financial Consumer Protection but with a<lb/> much wider audience of policy makers, regulators, supervisors and other stakeholders. Findings from<lb/> further research projects, lessons learnt from the implementation of measures, as well as evidence<lb/> about the long-term impact of these measures are specifically of mutual interest and should be shared<lb/> in the future.<lb/></p>

			<figure>ANNEX: COMPILATION AND SUMMARY OF SELECTED KEY STUDIES, REPORTS<lb/> AND ARTICLES ON BEHAVIOURAL ECONOMICS APPLIED TO FINANCIAL SERVICES<lb/> Academics and think tanks<lb/> The Power of Suggestion: Inertia in 401(k) Participation and Savings Behavior -Brigitte C.<lb/> Madrian and Dennis F.</figure>

			<head>Shea, Quarterly Journal of Economics, 2001<lb/></head>

			<p>The paper analyses the impact of automatic enrolment on the most common US types of<lb/> employer-sponsored retirement savings plans, known as &quot; 401(k) &quot; . It highlights first that 401(k)<lb/> participation is significantly higher under automatic enrolment. Second, a substantial fraction of<lb/> 401(k) participants hired under automatic enrolment retain both the default contribution rate and fund<lb/> allocation even though few employees hired before automatic enrolment picked this particular<lb/> outcome. This &quot; default &quot; behaviour appears to result from participant inertia and from employee<lb/> perceptions of the default as investment advice. These findings have implications for the design of<lb/> 401(k) savings plans as well as for any type of Social Security reform that includes personal accounts<lb/> over which individuals have control. They also shed light more generally on the importance of both<lb/> economic and noneconomic (behavioural) factors in the determination of individual savings<lb/> behaviour.<lb/></p>

			<head>Libertarian Paternalism -Richard H. Thaler and Cass R. Sunstein, American Economic Review,<lb/> 2003<lb/></head>

			<p>The paper explores how it is both possible and legitimate for private and public institutions to<lb/> affect individual&apos;s behaviour and decisions while also respecting their freedom of choice. Often<lb/> people&apos;s preferences are ill-formed, and their choices will inevitably be influenced by default rules,<lb/> framing effects, and starting points. In these circumstances, a form of paternalism cannot be avoided.<lb/> The report argues that equipped with an understanding of behavioural findings of bounded rationality<lb/> and bounded self-control, libertarian paternalists should attempt to steer people&apos;s choices in welfare-<lb/>promoting directions without eliminating freedom of choice. It is also possible to show how a<lb/> libertarian paternalist might select among the possible options and to assess how much choice to offer.<lb/> The article gives examples from many areas, including savings behaviour, labour law, and consumer<lb/> protection.<lb/></p>

			<head>Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion -Robert B. Cialdini, Revised Edition 2006<lb/></head>

			<p>The book explains the psychology of why people say &quot;yes&quot; and how to apply these<lb/> understandings. The author has identified six principles of influence (also known as the six weapons of<lb/> influence) through experimental studies, and by immersing himself in the world of what he called<lb/> &quot;compliance professionals&quot; -salespeople, fund raisers, recruiters, advertisers, marketers etc. Those six<lb/> principles are reciprocity; commitment (and consistency); social proof; liking; authority; and scarcity.<lb/></p>

			<head>Why incoherent preferences do not justify paternalism -Robert Sugden, Constitutional Political<lb/> Economy, 2008<lb/></head>

			<p>The report underlines that the arguments emerging from behavioural economics claim to<lb/> undermine the credibility, and even the conceptual coherence, of the economist&apos;s traditional rejection<lb/> of paternalism. Some suggest that the incoherent nature of individuals or consumers&apos; preferences<lb/> inevitably implies a form of paternalism. However, this conception would presuppose a &quot; planner &quot; with<lb/> the responsibility to collate information about individuals&apos; preferences and well-being and then,<lb/> guided by that information, to promote the overall social good. The paper argues that, in this context,<lb/> there is a viable alternative to paternalism: markets operate according to a system of economic<lb/> organisation that is structured by mutual advantage, i.e. each transaction, considered in isolation,<lb/> furthers the interests of everyone who is a party to it. This approach does not require consumers&apos;<lb/> preferences to be coherent.<lb/></p>

			<head>Nudge: Improving Decisions about Health, Wealth, and Happiness -Richard H. Thaler and Cass<lb/> R. Sunstein, Yale University Press, 2008<lb/></head>

			<p>Human beings often make bad decisions involving education, personal finance, health care,<lb/> mortgages and credit cards, the family, and the planet itself. They are susceptible to various biases that<lb/> can lead them to blunder. The book takes humanness as a given and shows that by knowing how<lb/> people think, choice environments can be designed that make it easier for people to choose what is<lb/> best for themselves, their families, and their society. It demonstrates how thoughtful &quot; choice<lb/> architecture &quot; can be established to nudge people in beneficial directions without restricting freedom of<lb/> choice.<lb/></p>

			<head>Behaviourally informed financial services regulation -Michael S. Barr, Sendhil Mullainathan and<lb/> Eldar Shafir, Asset Building Programme/New America Foundation, 2008<lb/></head>

			<p>The paper adopts a behavioural economic framework that considers firm incentives to respond to<lb/> regulation. Under this framework, outcomes are an equilibrium interaction between individuals with<lb/> specific psychologies and firms that respond to those psychologies within specific market contexts.<lb/> Regulation must then address failures in this equilibrium. The model suggests, for example, that in<lb/> some contexts market participants seek to overcome common human failings (as for example, with<lb/> under-saving) while in other contexts market participants seek to exploit these failings (as for<lb/> example, with over-borrowing). Behaviourally informed regulation needs to take account of these<lb/> different contexts. The paper discusses the specific application of these forces to mortgage, credit card,<lb/> and banking markets. The purpose of this paper is to illustrate how a behaviourally informed<lb/> regulatory analysis would lead to a deeper understanding of the costs and benefits of specific policies.<lb/></p>

			<head>Bank Herding and Incentive Systems as Catalysts for the Financial Crisis -Peter Haiss, IUP<lb/> Journal of Behavioral Finance, 2010<lb/></head>

			<p>Rooted in regulatory economics and behavioural finance, the paper offers a taxonomy of effects<lb/> that narrows the scope of the banks&apos; decision making into a funnel-shape and thus, prepares the<lb/> ground for a financial crisis. The overall conclusion of the paper is that inconsistent decision rules,<lb/> rigid bank regulations, stakeholder-focused incentive structures within banks and uncritical adoption<lb/> of innovations may force banks into decisions that are micro-functional, but macro-dysfunctional.<lb/> Behavioural aspects play a key role in the suggested remedies on the regulatory side (macroprudential<lb/> regulation, supervision of incentives) and on the banking side (proper reward systems and structured<lb/> decision making) to re-establish prudent banking.<lb/></p>

			<head>Behavioural economics as applied to firms: a primer -Mark Amstrong and Steffen Huck,<lb/> Competition Policy International, 2010<lb/></head>

			<p>The paper discusses the literatures on behavioural economics, bounded rationality, and<lb/> experimental economics as they apply to firm behaviour in markets. In much of the behavioural<lb/> economics studies, the assumption is that firms are fully rational and aim to maximize their profits.<lb/> However, firms sometimes depart from the profit-maximizing objective, for various reasons discussed<lb/> in the paper, such as the impact of imitative and &quot; satisficing &quot; (satisfying + sufficing) behaviour,<lb/> outcomes when managers care about their position relative to peers, the employment of managers<lb/> whose objective diverge from profit-maximization (including managers who are overconfident or base<lb/> pricing decisions on sunk costs), the impact of social preferences on the ability to collude, and the<lb/> incentive for profit-maximizing firms to mimic irrational behaviour.<lb/></p>

			<head>Consumer Financial Protection -John Y. Campbell, Howell E. Jackson, Brigitte C. Madrian and<lb/> Peter Tufano, Journal of Economic Perspectives, 2011<lb/></head>

			<p>The recent financial crisis has led many to question how well businesses deliver services and how<lb/> well regulatory institutions address problems in consumer financial markets. This paper discusses<lb/> consumer financial regulation, emphasizing the full range of arguments for regulation that derive from<lb/> market failure and from limited consumer rationality in financial decision making. Three case studies<lb/> are presented — mortgage markets, payday lending, and financing retirement consumption—to<lb/> illustrate the need for, and limits of, regulation. The paper argues that if regulation is to be beneficial,<lb/> it must be tailored to specific problems and must be accompanied by research to measure the<lb/> effectiveness of regulatory interventions.<lb/></p>

			<figure>Behavioral economics: implications for regulatory behaviour -James C. Cooper, George Mason<lb/> University School of Law; William E. Kovacic, Journal of Regulatory Economics, 2012<lb/></figure>

			<p>This paper considers how biases affect regulatory decisions, in the case of a regulator who serves<lb/> as an agent to a political overseer. The regulator chooses a policy that accounts for the rewards he/she<lb/> receives from the political overseer—whose optimal policy is assumed to maximize short-run outputs<lb/> that garner political support, rather than long-term welfare outcomes—and the weight the regulator<lb/> puts on the optimal long run policy. Flawed heuristics and myopia are likely to lead regulators to adopt<lb/> policies closer to the preferences of political overseers than they would otherwise. The incentive<lb/> structure for regulators is likely to reward those who adopt politically expedient policies, either<lb/> intentionally (due to a desire to please the political overseer) or accidentally (due to bounded<lb/> rationality). The paper urges that careful thought be given to calls for greater state intervention,<lb/> especially when those calls seek to correct firm biases. It proposes measures that focus rewards to<lb/> regulators on outcomes rather than outputs as a way to help ameliorate regulatory biases.<lb/></p>

			<figure>Consumer Protection: Bounded Rationality and Regulation (La protection du consommateur :<lb/> rationalité limitée et régulation) -Xavier Gabaix, Augustin Landier and David Thesmar, Conseil<lb/> d&apos;Analyse économique, 2012<lb/></figure>

			<p>This report examines the foundations for consumer protection and the regulatory procedures<lb/> required to ensure such protection. In practice, the consumer does not necessarily behave in the ways<lb/> supposed in microeconomic analysis of consumer guides. Imperfect information and bounded<lb/> rationality cannot be managed or corrected by self-regulation alone. In many cases, intervention by the<lb/> public authorities is essential. Such intervention takes the form of both ex ante regulations (prior<lb/> definition of requirements and constraints) and ex post regulations (recourse under the law and<lb/> sanctions, etc.). The report results in a number of proposals, some of which are aimed at making major<lb/> improvements to information available to the consumer; others are related to ex post regulation. The<lb/> report proposes more severe administrative fines (imposed by the Directorate General for Competition<lb/> Policy, Consumer Affairs and Fraud Control, DGCCRF, part of the Ministry of Economy). It<lb/> advocates the acknowledgement of class action in France.<lb/></p>

			<head>Behavioral Economics and Behavior Change -David Laibson, Harvard University, presentation at<lb/> the 2013 conference of the American Association for the Advancement of Science/European<lb/> Commission Joint Research Centre<lb/></head>

			<p>Behavioural economics explains why people often fail to act in their own best interest and are<lb/> often influenced by the fact that costs come early and benefits come late. The presentation shows that<lb/> this self-defeating behaviour can be changed using inexpensive, scalable interventions: defaults and<lb/> other nudges/interventions have already made a big difference, for example for contributions to<lb/> savings schemes. The author advises policymakers not to rely on doctrine or introspection, but to<lb/> focus on data and small scale experiments. Finding answers to two key questions should help them<lb/> drive the process: which behaviours would they like to influence, and how can they transform good<lb/> intentions into long-lasting actions?<lb/></p>

			<figure>Learning in the Credit Card Market -Sumit Agarwal, John C. Driscoll, Xavier Gabaix and David<lb/> Laibson, 2013<lb/> The paper measures learning dynamics using a panel with four million monthly credit card<lb/> statements. It studies add-on fees, specifically cash advance, late payment, and over-limit fees. New<lb/> credit card accounts generate fee payments of over USD 16 per month. Through negative feedback —<lb/> i.e. paying a fee — consumers learn to avoid triggering future fees. Paying a fee last month reduces<lb/> the likelihood of paying a fee this month by about 40%. Controlling for account fixed effects, monthly<lb/> fee payments fall by 75% during the first three years of account life. We find that learning is not<lb/> monotonic. Knowledge depreciates about 10% per month, implying that learning displays a strong<lb/> recency effect.<lb/> The Nature of the Beast: What Behavioral Economics Is Not -Matthew Darling, Saugato Datta,<lb/> and Sendhil Mullainathan, The Center for Global Development, 2013<lb/></figure>

			<p>The paper seeks to remove misconceptions about behavioural economics, and for this defines the<lb/> concept by what it is not: behavioural economics is not about controlling behaviour, as behavioural<lb/> tools are about helping people to make the choices that they themselves want to make; behavioural<lb/> economics is not Liberal (or Conservative), as it has being picked up and used by a wide range of<lb/> governments as well as private companies; behavioural economics is not about &quot; irrationality &quot; in the<lb/> pejorative and condescending common meaning. The use of &quot; irrationality &quot; stems from a simplification<lb/> of the field&apos;s experimental findings that distinguish real-world human behaviour from the predictions<lb/> of traditional economic theory.<lb/></p>

			<head>Protecting Consumers from Add-On Insurance Products: New Lessons for Insurance<lb/> Regulation from Behavioral Economics -Tom Baker, Peter Siegelman, Connecticut Insurance Law<lb/> Journal, 2013<lb/></head>

			<p>Persistently high profits on &quot; insurance &quot; for small value losses sold as an add-on to other products<lb/> or services (such as extended warranties sold with consumer electronics, or credit life insurance sold<lb/> with a loan) pose a twofold challenge to the standard economic analysis of insurance. First, expected<lb/> utility theory teaches that people should not buy insurance for small value losses. Second, the market<lb/> should not in the long run permit sellers to charge prices that greatly exceed the cost of providing the<lb/> insurance. Combining the insights of the shrouded pricing model with the behavioural economics of<lb/> insurance, this paper explains why high profits for add-on insurance persist and describes the negative<lb/> distributional and welfare consequences of an unregulated market for such insurance. Drawing on<lb/> theoretical, empirical, and comparative law sources, the paper explains why enhanced disclosure will<lb/> not work, the circumstances under which a point of sale ban of offer of add-on insurance is desirable,<lb/> and why a new, on-line market is preferable to price regulation in circumstances in which a point of<lb/> sale ban is undesirable.<lb/></p>

			<p>The reports underlines how new insights from science and behaviour change could lead to<lb/> significantly improved outcomes, and at a lower cost, than the way many conventional policy tools are<lb/> used. It explores how behaviour change theory can help meet current policy challenges, such as how to<lb/> reduce crime, tackle obesity and ensure environmental sustainability. Today&apos;s policy makers are in the<lb/> business of influencing behaviour -they need to understand the effects their policies may be having.<lb/> &quot; MINDSPACE &quot; is a mnemonic which can be used as a quick checklist when making policy, and<lb/> stands for stands for &quot; Messenger, Incentives, Norms, Defaults, Salience, Priming, Affect,<lb/> Commitments, Ego &quot; .

			<head>Consumer Policy Toolkit -OECD, 2010<lb/></head>

			<p>This practical guide is designed to aid policymakers in using a systematic approach to identify<lb/> and evaluate consumer problems and to develop, implement and review effective consumer policies so<lb/> that consumer can play their role in ensuring a dynamic economy.<lb/></p>

			<p>The report notes that work done in the field of behavioural economics has identified a number of<lb/> important ways that consumer behaviour may deviate from the assumptions underlying the traditional<lb/> market model and has enriched understanding of consumer behaviour in key areas (eg. making choices<lb/> with uncertain outcomes, trade-offs between present decisions and long-term interests). In certain<lb/> areas, such as designing information disclosures or evaluating situations involving default-setting,<lb/> behavioural economics may provide important insights that could improve policy formulation. As<lb/> behavioural economics continues to mature, the report underlines that there may be further<lb/> implications for consumer policy. It is therefore an area that merits continued attention.<lb/></p>

The objective was to identify major shortcomings,<lb/> based in particular on behavioural insights, and suggest improvements. The study concludes that<lb/> several limitations affect the content of the questionnaires used, in particular with regard to questions<lb/> used to assess customers&apos; investment knowledge and experience; the format used to elicit consumers&apos;<lb/> risk attitude which does not independently assess preferences on the time horizon and investment<lb/> aims; the way questions on risk attitude are worded.<lb/></p>

			<head>Applying behavioural economics at the Financial Conduct Authority</head>

			<p>-Kristine Erta, Stefan Hunt,<lb/> Zanna Iscenko, Will Brambley, Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) <ref type="biblio">Occasional Paper 1, 2013<lb/></ref> People often make errors when choosing and using financial products, and can suffer<lb/> considerable losses as a result. Using behavioural economics helps understand how these errors arise,<lb/> why they persist, and what can be done to ameliorate them.

			<p>The paper summarises the main lessons from behavioural economics for retail financial markets:<lb/> how consumers make predictable mistakes when choosing and using financial products, how firms<lb/> respond to these mistakes; and how behavioural biases can lead firms to compete in ways that are not<lb/> in the interests of consumers.

			<p>The report describes a research conducted to determine how to encourage consumers to claim<lb/> redress following the mis-selling of financial products. Mis-sold customers needed to answer<lb/> questions raised in the letter to get redress. The firm&apos;s original letter had a very low response rate.<lb/> Different potential improvements to the firm&apos;s letter were tested using an RCT, with a view to increase<lb/> the level of customers&apos; response. The letter was modified with simple amendments, including reducing<lb/> the amount of text, explaining to readers that the claims&apos; process would only take five minutes, putting<lb/> the main thrust of the message in bullets at the top of the letter, adding an &quot; act quickly &quot; label on the<lb/> envelope and the FSA logo on the letter, replace the generic &quot; Customer Team &quot; signature by the<lb/> CEO&apos;s. Reminders were also sent. Overall, the rate of responses jumped by over 10%.<lb/></p>

			<figure>Sciences to EU Policy-making -René van Bavel, Benedikt Herrmann,<lb/> Gabriele Esposito, Antonios Proestakis, European Commission, Joint Research Centre Scientific and<lb/> Policy reports, 2013<lb/></figure>

			<p>This report is intended as a guide for EU policy-makers wishing to introduce a more refined<lb/> understanding of human behaviour into the policy-making process. It covers specific issues that should<lb/> be taken into account when incorporating behavioural insights into the design, implementation and<lb/> monitoring of policies. This includes: identifying at what stage behavioural science should be applied<lb/> to the policy-making process; defining the role of behaviour in a policy initiative; reviewing the<lb/> available evidence; estimating the value added of a behavioural study; specifying the unit of analysis<lb/> (usually individuals but firms in some cases, or SMEs; and considering time constraints. The paper<lb/> also reviews the various types of behavioural studies that can be conducted to inform the envisaged<lb/> EU policy: experimental study; randomised controlled trial (RCT); survey, or qualitative research.<lb/></p>

			<head>Behavioural Economics and Competition Policy -The Netherlands Authority for Consumers and<lb/> Markets (Autoriteit Consument &amp; Markt, ACM), 2013<lb/></head>

			<p>The report explores what behavioural economics can mean for competition policy. It analyses the<lb/> implications of the main behavioural economics findings for the effects of competition on consumer<lb/> welfare and for the explanatory value of the theory underlying competition analysis. The report<lb/> concludes that the findings of behavioural economics do not necessitate a re-evaluation of the<lb/> fundamental basis and benefits of competition policy or the explanatory value of standard economic<lb/> models. The report also discusses the issue of potential pockets of market power in which firms may<lb/> exploit consumer biases. If dynamic learning effects are limited and exploitation of consumer biases<lb/> appears persistent, regulators may decide to intervene. The ACM&apos;s view is that the enforcement of<lb/> consumer protection laws, market scans and effective communication (to help &apos;de-bias&apos; consumers)<lb/> are the best instruments to deal with this issue.<lb/></p>

			<figure>Financial (Dis-)Information Evidence from an Audit Study in Mexico -Xavier Gine, Cristina<lb/> Martinez Cuellar, Rafe Mazer, World Bank, 2014<lb/></figure>

			<p>In Mexico, the World Bank, CGAP and Condusef, the Mexican Consumer Protection Agency,<lb/> trained lower-income consumers to pose as potential customers at financial institutions. Those<lb/> &quot; mystery shoppers &quot; tested financial institutions in 4 towns and found significant gaps between what<lb/> the law requires and what is actually happening on the ground. It showed for example that<lb/> inexperienced consumers receive less product information during the sales process, as banks staff tend<lb/> to treat customers differently based on their perceived financial knowledge. It also evidenced that sales<lb/> staff incentives do not align with consumer needs and budgets: low-cost accounts, which are good for<lb/> customers, are not generally profitable for banks and are not offered.<lb/></p>

			<head>Regulatory Policy and Behavioural Economics -Peter Lunne, OECD, 2014<lb/></head>

			<p>Over the last years, behavioural economics has been rapidly propelled from the margins of<lb/> economic analysis towards the policy mainstream. In this context, this study offers an international<lb/> review of the initial applications of behavioural economics to policy, with a particular focus on<lb/> regulatory policy. It describes the extent to which behavioural findings have begun to influence public<lb/> policy in a number of OECD countries, referring to a total of more than 60 instances, the majority of<lb/> which concern regulatory policy. It then considers possible lessons for regulatory design and delivery,<lb/> highlighting in particular that the introduction of a behavioural economics dimension in regulatory<lb/> design will have implications for applied economic analysis and the skill-sets of those working in<lb/> policy development and regulation with the conduct or commission of context-specific empirical<lb/> studies that employ experiments, pilots and RCTs. It also underlines how much the environment in<lb/> which decision makers operate matters. Regulations are just one possible way to alter that<lb/> environment, but where they are effective it may often be less because they prohibit than because they<lb/> assist; good regulations can improve the environment for decision makers.<lb/></p>

			<head>Final report of the conference on Emerging challenges in retail finance and consumer policy -<lb/>European Commission, 2014<lb/></head>

			<p>One of the conference&apos;s sessions focused on the ways to make a better use of the insights of<lb/> behavioural economics in policymaking in the area of financial services. Recent EU legislative<lb/> measures have attempted to integrate the psychological dimension of consumers&apos; decision-making<lb/> process (packaged-retail and insurance-based investments products -PRIIPs, <ref type="biblio">Consumer</ref> and Mortgage<lb/> Credit Directives), and the European Commission is interested in further learning and exploring how<lb/> best to apply such insights in regulatory work. As part of the discussion, the European Consumer<lb/> Organisation, BEUC, recognised the value of behavourial economics but underlined that more market<lb/> failures which generate consumers&apos; vulnerability have been so far insufficiently addressed by<lb/> policymakers, for example: (artificial) complexity of financial products, tying of products or conflicts<lb/> of interests arising from commissions and remuneration schemes. The Financial Conduct Authority<lb/> highlighted that the UK has developed a model for regulatory analysis which looks at markets in the<lb/> round by exploring the interaction of behavioural market failures, structural competition issues,<lb/> information asymmetries, externalities and regulatory failures. Participants to the conference debated 4<lb/> preselected topics falling under the scope of behavioural economics: comparability of products,<lb/> vulnerable consumers, providers&apos; reputation and trustworthiness, and misalignment of incentives.<lb/> How does selling insurance as an add-on affect consumer decisions? A practical application of<lb/> behavioural experiments in financial regulation -FCA Occasional Paper 3, 2014<lb/></figure>

			<p>This paper described the 1 st FCA behavioural experiment, which studies decision-making in a<lb/> more stylised environment than a field trial, but still captures the main aspects of the decision that is<lb/> being investigated. It formed part of the FCA market study on general insurance products commonly<lb/> sold as add-ons, i.e. general insurance sold alongside other (primary) products either at the same time<lb/> or subsequently, like travel insurance sold alongside a holiday. The study investigated whether there<lb/> were common patterns across add-on markets that weakened competition and drove poor consumer<lb/> outcomes. This involved considering various sales and price format: standalone insurance; add-on<lb/> upfront alongside the primary product; add-on revealed only at point of sale for the primary product.<lb/> This helped identify the effects on the extent and effectiveness of shopping around and on the add-on<lb/> take up.<lb/></p>

			<head>Behavioural Economics -Department of Public Expenditure and Reform&apos;s Central Expenditure<lb/> Evaluation Unit, Irish Government Economic and Evaluation Service, 2014<lb/></head>

			<p>This paper examines, in a preliminary way, the potential for the growing body of research and<lb/> innovative ideas emerging in the area of behavioural economics to improve the effectiveness and<lb/> efficiency of policies and of State services and service delivery to the citizen.<lb/> It explains the theoretical and research-based background to behavioural economics and discusses<lb/> some practical applications in the area of public policy making and public service delivery. In doing<lb/> so, it draws on examples of best international practices and makes some recommendations for<lb/> applying these in Ireland. It also highlights existing good practices and initiatives underway in parts of<lb/> the Irish public service. There is scope for behavioural economics across the wide spectrum of public<lb/> policy and state services -health care, education, pensions, back-to-work initiatives, reducing<lb/> reoffending rates, and the collection of taxes, fines and charges. This paper proposes that behavioural<lb/> economics can improve new policy development, enhance the delivery of existing policy and<lb/> interventions, help avoid unintended outcomes and improve productivity. At an operational level,<lb/> behavioural economics has application across public services, including in the area of debt<lb/> management and revenue collection, and at a policy level it can inform policy development in areas<lb/> such as pensions and in health.<lb/></p>

			<head>Applying behavioral insights in consumer protection policy -Rafe Mazer, Katharine McKee,<lb/> Alexandra Fiorillo, CGAP, 2014<lb/></head>

			<p>The increased use of behavioural research to develop consumer protection policies is especially<lb/> important in emerging markets and developing economies (EMDEs) due to the nature of both their<lb/> financial markets and many of their financial consumers. The paper explores how behavioural research<lb/> can offer important tools for effective policy-making in four priority consumer protection topics that<lb/> are relevant in virtually all settings, but have specific implications in base-of-the-pyramid settings:<lb/> disclosure, transparency, and product choice; complaints handling and recourse; credit market<lb/> regulation and debt stress; and fair treatment. Each of the four sections reviews emerging evidence and<lb/> experience from behavioural research and offers specific advice for policy and regulation deriving<lb/> from these behavioural insights. The paper closes with reflections on consumer protection-related<lb/> priorities and challenges in EMDEs that would benefit from further applied behavioural research and<lb/> field experimentation.<lb/></p>

			<figure>Investing in hybrid securities: explanations based on behavioural economics -Australian<lb/> Securities and Investment Commission (ASIC), 2015<lb/></figure>

			<p>This report sets out the results of research into how behavioural biases may influence preferences<lb/> towards hybrid securities over the less complex financial products of bonds and shares. It provides<lb/> preliminary insight into the behavioural biases and risk attitudes that influence investment in hybrid<lb/> securities. Findings show that they include the illusion of control that investors can exert over their<lb/> environment; investors&apos; overconfidence on their ability to withdraw from an investment early and<lb/> consequently be protected from risk; a framing bias regarding the formulation of the choice in favour<lb/> of hybrid securities; a preference of known risks over unknown risks; branding of (known) issuers of<lb/> financial products; investors&apos; risk perception and attitudes. The findings are based on a pilot study that<lb/> was commissioned by ASIC due to its concern that some retail investors may struggle to understand<lb/> the complexity of hybrid securities and the risks they pose.<lb/></p>

			<figure>Improving communication with directors of firms in liquidation -Australian Securities and<lb/> Investment Commission (ASIC), 2015<lb/></figure>

			<p>Based on a behavioural economics approach, this report explores how to increase compliance of<lb/> directors of companies in liquidation with their legal obligations to cooperate with a nominated<lb/> liquidator. The research tests, through a laboratory experiment, potentially effective ways through<lb/> changing the form of communication used when requesting company information from directors, and<lb/> offering opportunities to receive legal or accounting assistance. Directors willing to comply but<lb/> lacking business management skills appear to be more likely to react positively to &quot; nudge-like &quot;<lb/> treatments.<lb/></p>

			<figure>Stimulating interest: Reminding savers to act when rates decrease -FCA Occasional<lb/> Paper 7, 2015<lb/></figure>

			<p>This paper analyses if holders of savings accounts with short-term high interest rates do not<lb/> transfer their money when the rate falls because of behavioural biases, such as undervaluing long-term<lb/> gains relative to short-term costs (present bias) or paying insufficient attention to their savings choices<lb/> (limited attention). The FCA has carried out a trial involving savings account customers whose interest<lb/> rate was about to decrease or had just decreased. All of these customers had already received a letter<lb/> two to three months before the rate decrease informing them of this. This paper investigates the effects<lb/> on switching behaviour of an additional letter, different messages in the reminder and the timing of the<lb/> reminder.<lb/></p>

			<head>Two plus two makes five? Survey evidence that investors overvalue structured deposits -FCA<lb/> Occasional Paper 9, 2015<lb/></head>

			<p>The survey investigated how well consumers understand and value structured deposits, a class of<lb/> complex products. The FCA conducted a behavioural experiment involving retail investors who had<lb/> previously bought or would consider buying structured deposits or other structured products. Investors<lb/> significantly and systematically overestimated the return from structured deposits. This overestimation<lb/> led them to prefer structured deposits over alternatives as cash savings. New targeted disclosure could<lb/> improve how consumers make their comparisons and their investment decisions.<lb/></p>

			<figure>Financial Product Disclosure: Insights from Behavioural Economics -Kirsty Johnston, Christine<lb/> Tether, Ashley Tomlinson, Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment New Zealand,<lb/> Occasional Paper 15/01, 2015<lb/></figure>

			<p>The paper reviews research on behavioural economics and identifies the main implications for the<lb/> development of policy for financial product disclosure, with a focus on investment products. The<lb/> conclusion is that disclosures are most effective at aiding investor decision making when they are<lb/> short and simple; standardised; clear about risks and benefits; meaningful; well presented; and tested<lb/> on investors. The reports also highlights that it is important that key behavioural insights are seen in<lb/> the broader context of what a disclosure regime seeks to achieve (for example, a short and succinct<lb/> document is not an end in itself if it fails to convey the necessary information), in order to effectively<lb/> aid investors&apos; understanding and decision making.<lb/></p>

			<figure>Message received? The impact of annual summaries, text alerts and mobile apps on consumer<lb/> banking behaviour -FCA Occasional paper 10, 2015<lb/></figure>

			<p>In the context of a potential Competition and Markets Authority investigation into personal<lb/> current accounts, the FCA wanted to understand the impact of previous initiatives that were intended<lb/> to help consumers manage their current account. The experience showed that annual summaries have<lb/> no effect on consumer behaviour in terms of incurring overdraft charges, altering balance levels or<lb/> switching to other current account providers. In contrast, signing up to text alerts or mobile banking<lb/> apps reduces the amount of unarranged overdraft charges incurred, and signing up to both services has<lb/> an additional effect. The additional impact of the combination of both services shows the benefit of<lb/> receiving information upon automatic triggers, without having to actively acquire it, as well as having<lb/> the facility to act quickly upon receiving information. Text alerts and mobile banking apps also reduce<lb/> current account balances, which is beneficial for consumers as they reduce the cost of holding funds in<lb/> accounts with low credit interest rates. This research reinforces the importance of testing disclosures<lb/> beforehand to help ensure that they effectively achieve their intended outcomes. The paper discusses<lb/> wider implications for the role of regulation, how to design effective disclosure rules, and incentives<lb/> for innovation.<lb/></p>

			<head>Newspaper articles and blog posts<lb/> Economics Behaving Badly -George Loewenstein and Peter Ubel, New York Times, 14 July 2010<lb/></head>

			<p>The article argues that behavioural economics is being asked to solve problems it was not meant<lb/> to address and that in some cases, it is being used as a political expedient, allowing policymakers to<lb/> avoid more effective solutions rooted in traditional economics. Behavioural economics should<lb/> complement, not substitute for, more substantive economic interventions.<lb/></p>

			<figure>Pire que l&apos;autre, la nouvelle science économique -Laura Raim, Le Monde Diplomatique, juillet<lb/> 2013<lb/></figure>

			<p>Behavioural economics explores consumers&apos; decision-making process in order to help them<lb/> &quot; follow the right path &quot; , through subtle incentives or nudges. But behavourial economics is also used<lb/> by firms especially in the financial sector (eg. asset management funds), as a way to influence<lb/> employees and clients&apos; reactions to the firms&apos; benefit. The article presents nudges as a midway<lb/> solution between markets &quot; laisser-faire &quot; and public regulation. They would facilitate choices made in<lb/> the general interest, without defining what this &quot; general interest &quot; is or should be. The article also<lb/> points at the problematic connections between the economic and the political spheres. It expresses<lb/> some doubts about the practical results of behavioural economics research and concludes that this<lb/> approach fails to solve the market inefficiency problems.<lb/></p>
