Furthermore, since different projects usually<lb/> have different years of planned disbursements, aggregates of committed amounts would be an accumulation of projects with<lb/> different number of years of implementation.

			<head>BACKGROUND AND INTRODUCTION<lb/></head>

			<p>T<lb/> he 2030 Agenda and the related financing framework emphasise the need for developing countries to fill the significant<lb/> infrastructure gap in order to achieve their Sustainable Development Goals. In this context, development partners are increasingly<lb/> contributing to this agenda by directly providing financial assistance, helping improve the delivery of infrastructure services and<lb/> mobilising resources from the private sector. Given the importance of filling the large financing gap, it is crucial to gauge the contribution<lb/> from all sources to infrastructure of developing countries, including from development partners.<lb/></p>

			<p>In this respect, the OECD Development Assistance Committee (DAC) has been collecting and analysing financial data of major bilateral<lb/> and multilateral development partners to infrastructure. The aims of this work include contributing to the monitoring of the SDGs 9 on<lb/> infrastructure support and providing the basis of discussions by the G20 Infrastructure Investment Working Group (IIWG). The analyses<lb/> have been undertaken by: using data reported by bilateral and multilateral development partners to the DAC at the activity level; directly<lb/> obtaining relevant data from institutions through correspondence; estimating official support for development co-operation of non-<lb/>traditional development partners, such as China and India; and carrying out a survey on amounts mobilised from the private sector by<lb/> development partners.<lb/></p>

			<p>With this in mind, this report, which builds on previous work on the topic 4 , will contribute to research and policy dialogue on measuring<lb/> finance by development partners to developing country infrastructure. While Section I will provide an overview of total ODF for infrastructure<lb/> by both bilateral and multilateral partners, Section II will specifically concentrate on Multilateral Development Banks (MDBs) – in light<lb/> of the renewed attention brought by the creation of new institutions, such as the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank and the New<lb/> Development Bank. In both sections, the report will measure and analyse overall finance of development partners for infrastructure,<lb/> amounts related to private sector operations, and the volume mobilised from the private sector by guarantees, syndicated loans and<lb/> shares in Collective Investment Vehicles (CIVs) provided through ODF interventions.<lb/></p>

			<head>I. OVERALL PICTURE BY ALL DEVELOPMENT PARTNERS<lb/> Infrastructure Needs in Developing Countries<lb/></head>

			<p>Infrastructure is essential for developing countries to achieve inclusive and sustainable growth as well as poverty reduction, food<lb/> security, and health and education objectives. In light of its importance, infrastructure is one of the top priorities of the Sustainable<lb/> Development Goals, the Addis Ababa Action Agenda, and the Paris Agreement on Climate Change. At the same time, according to<lb/> estimates from United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), current financing is by far insufficient to meet<lb/> the infrastructure needs (UNCTAD 2014). In fact, while roughly USD 1 trillion is spent on infrastructure in developing countries<lb/> every year, two to three times this amount would be necessary to meet the needs up to 2030, especially in energy and water and<lb/> sanitation (see <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>). More than two thirds of these resources are required in Asia, particularly China, which makes up half of<lb/> total investment needs (see <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<head>Overall Infrastructure Spending by Public and Private Sectors<lb/></head>

			<p>In terms of current infrastructure spending, most of the resources were provided by developing country governments, about a<lb/> third by the private sector and only a small portion by development partners (6-7%) (see <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>). However, there were large<lb/> differences between countries, as Low Income Countries (LICs) relied much more on the support from development partners than<lb/> Middle Income Countries (MICs), due to their lower capacity to mobilise domestic and external private finance.<lb/></p>

			<head>Official Support to Infrastructure by Development Partners in 2014<lb/></head>

			<p>While relatively small in overall financing, ODF for infrastructure has been growing in</p>

			<table>recent years. Data from bilateral and multilateral<lb/> development partners reporting to the DAC shows that concessional and non-concessional ODF commitments for infrastructure<lb/> increased at a compounded annual growth rate of 7% 5 in the period 2005-2014. In addition, the share of infrastructure in total<lb/> sector-allocable ODF 6 by development partners also grew from 20% to 26% in the same period.<lb/> When estimated flows of development partners that do not report to the DAC are also included, total official support to infrastructure<lb/> amounted to USD 60 billion (see Figure 4) in 2014. In terms of breakdown, 56% was concessional finance (i.e ODA) and 44%<lb/> was non-concessional (i.e. OOF) in 2014. This amount does not include the USD 1.7 billion of commercially motivated official<lb/> export credit direct loans provided by OECD Members in the same year 7 . Of the 60 billion provided by development partners,<lb/> 43% was disbursed by bilateral development partners and 57% by multilaterals 8 , particularly the Multilateral Development Banks<lb/> (MDBs), which together accounted for half of the total disbursements. If only flows reported to the DAC are considered, ODF for<lb/> infrastructure increased by 6% – or USD 2.7 billion – when compared to 2013.<lb/> Figure 4.

			<p>Aside</p>

The sum of their disbursed amounts is estimated to be USD 4.1 billion in 2014, which accounted for<lb/> 14% of the total ODF for infrastructure. Projects financed by China are particularly concentrated in low-income African countries,<lb/> whereas India focuses predominately on neighbouring countries such as Bangladesh, Bhutan and Nepal (Miyamoto and Chiofalo<lb/> 2015).

			<head>Largest Development Partners for Infrastructure in 2014<lb/></head>

			<p>Among those that report to the DAC, the largest development partners for infrastructure in 2014 included the MDBs, G7 countries,<lb/> European Union (EU) Institutions and Korea (<ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref>) 9 . In particular, financing for infrastructure is largely characterised by<lb/> significant amounts by a few development partners, with the top five financing almost 55% and top 10 financing 75% of the total<lb/> ODF. Furthermore, the World Bank Group (WBG), which includes the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD),<lb/> the International Development Association (IDA) and the IFC, disbursed almost a quarter of the total amount.<lb/></p>

			<figure>Compared to 2013, the disbursements for infrastructure by the WBG increased by USD 2 billion in 2014, reaching almost USD 14<lb/> billion. Disbursements by Germany also increased, approximately by USD half a billion, following an upward trend that started in<lb/> 2012. On the other hand, disbursements from the EU Institutions declined by USD 1 billion (a drop of 20%) and by 1.8 billion from<lb/> the United States of America (USA) (a drop of 56%), both in line with a decreasing trend that started in 2012 and 2010, respectively.<lb/> 10.

			<head>Share of Infrastructure Spending within all Sectors by Development Partners<lb/></head>

			<p>The importance given to infrastructure within all sectors 10 varied widely across development partners (see <ref type="figure">Figure 7</ref>). In particular,<lb/> several Arab development partners such as the IsDB, the Arab Fund, the Arab Bank for Economic Development in Africa (BADEA),<lb/> and Kuwait, as well as AfDB, AsDB, and Japan allocated more than half of their sector-allocable ODF to infrastructure. Others such<lb/> as the WBG, Korea, IADB Group and France also disbursed about a third of their sector-allocable funds to infrastructure.<lb/></p>

			<head>Regional Distribution of ODF for Infrastructure<lb/></head>

			<p>In terms of geographical distribution, Asia received the largest share of ODF for infrastructure with 46%, followed by Africa with<lb/> 31%, Americas with 15% and finally Europe with 8% 11 (see <ref type="figure">Figure 8</ref>). Overall, the ODF distribution mirrored that of the population<lb/> among developing countries, i.e. higher in Asia and Africa and lower in the Americas and Europe, although Asia received less<lb/> than its share of the total population. In terms of the level of concessionality of ODF, while Africa received more than two thirds<lb/> of infrastructure disbursements in concessional finance (i.e. ODA), the Americas received two thirds in non-concessional finance<lb/> (i.e. OOF). Asia and Europe received half concessional and half non-concessional finance. Europe&apos;s concessional finance for<lb/> infrastructure was mostly disbursements by the EU Institutions to Turkey, Serbia, and Bosnia and Herzegovina.<lb/></p>

			<head>Income-Level Distribution of ODF for Infrastructure and Top Recipients<lb/></head>

			<p>Disaggregating ODF for infrastructure by income levels, the distribution was more or less similar to the share of developing<lb/> country population by the income groups. Lower Middle Income Countries (LMICs) received 42%, Upper Middle Income Countries<lb/> (UMICs) 36%, and Low Income Countries (LICs) 22%, while their shares of the population are 42%, 40%, and 17% respectively<lb/> (see <ref type="figure">Figure 9</ref>). In fact, LICs received slightly more than their share of the population. In terms of concessionality of financial flows<lb/> to the different income groups, a high proportion (83%) of ODF for infrastructure to LICs was concessional, while disbursements<lb/> to LMICs were mainly concessional (60%) and to UMICs mainly non-concessional (67%).<lb/></p>

			<figure>Figure 9. Income Level Distribution of ODF for Infrastructure by All Development Partners, 2014<lb/> Source: Gross disbursements. See source for Figure 6. It includes estimates by the authors.<lb/> Note: See note at Figure 6.<lb/></figure>

			<p>In general, there is a high concentration of ODF for infrastructure in a few countries especially large and industrialised emerging<lb/> economies. In 2014, almost 40% of total ODF to infrastructure was disbursed to the top 10 recipients, which are mostly large<lb/> emerging economies of LMICs and UMICs, with India, Viet Nam, and China being the top three (see <ref type="figure">Figure 10</ref>) 12 . Given that the<lb/> supply side is also concentrated, as explained above, the broad picture is that a few large development partners are supporting a<lb/> few large emerging economies. For instance, disbursements by the top 5 development partners to the top 5 recipients consisted<lb/> of a fifth (21%) of total ODF for infrastructure and disbursements by the top 10 development partners to the top 10 recipients<lb/> consisted of 35%.<lb/></p>

			<head>Sectoral Distribution of ODF for Infrastructure<lb/></head>

			<p>In terms of sectoral distribution, transport received the largest share of total ODF disbursements for infrastructure, followed by<lb/> energy, water and sanitation and finally communications (see <ref type="figure">Figure 11</ref>). Within transport, roads received about half, followed<lb/> by rail transport. By looking at energy, half of the support was for electric transmission and technical assistance for policy and<lb/> institutional reforms. Within the remaining half, which is for power generation, 54% was allocated to renewable sources (solar,<lb/> wind, hydro, geothermal, biomass and ocean) and 45% to non-renewables (coal, gas and oil).<lb/></p>

			<p>Despite the higher amount going to transport, the sectoral distribution of total investment gaps up to 2030 explained above<lb/> shows that the proportion of needs are the greatest in energy (with 44%) rather than transport (with 22%). At the same time,<lb/> since development partner support to infrastructure can barely meet the estimated total investment gap of USD 1.2 trillion, this<lb/> comparison should be taken with caution. On the other hand, while small at the aggregate level, ODF disbursed by development<lb/> partners is particularly important for aid-dependent poorer countries and sectors where developing country governments and the<lb/> private sector are providing insufficient resources.<lb/></p>

			<p>Aside from supporting physical infrastructure, development partners contributed to improving the policy framework and other<lb/> non-physical aspects related to infrastructure. Examples include: strengthening regulatory authorities in the telecommunication,<lb/> transport, and energy sectors; financial and operational restructuring of State Owned Enterprises; and capacity building of<lb/> municipalities in sustainable use and management of water resources. Almost 20% of ODF to infrastructure was allocated to the<lb/> policy framework and other non-physical aspects related to infrastructure sectors in 2014, particularly for energy.

			<p>Furthermore, in addition to assisting developing country governments, development partners directly support the private sector by<lb/> using financial instruments such as guarantees, equity and loans with the aim of mobilising additional financing for infrastructure.<lb/> While this support is mainly provided through Development Finance Institutions (DFIs) and International Financial Institutions<lb/> (IFIs), traditional development agencies also engage the private sector directly. As shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref> above, direct support to the<lb/> private sector represented 10% of total official developmental flows to infrastructure in 2014, although this amount did not include<lb/> guarantees as they are not actual flows. Here, the largest donors were the MDBs—particularly the IFC which was by far the largest,<lb/> disbursing almost USD 2.2 billion (see <ref type="figure">figure 12</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<p>The sectoral distribution of disbursements to the private sector for infrastructure was 61% to energy, 22% to transport, 14% to<lb/> communications, and 3% to water and sanitation. By comparing these to the distribution of ODF for infrastructure to the public<lb/> sector, leveraging efforts were made more in energy and communications and less so in transport and water and sanitation,<lb/> possibly due to the commercial viability of the two former sectors. Furthermore, the majority (55%) of the direct support to the<lb/> private sector went to UMICs, about a third (32%) to LMICs, and a smaller share (12%) to LICs. While the proportion for UMICs is still<lb/> relatively high, there may be a shift in support to the private sector from upper to lower income countries, as in 2013 the proportion<lb/> allocated to UMICs was two thirds. Top recipient countries were Turkey, Brazil, India and China (see <ref type="figure">Figure 13</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<head>Private Finance Mobilised through Guarantees, Syndicated Loans, and Shares<lb/> in CIVs<lb/></head>

			<p>Based on a survey carried out by the DAC Secretariat among DFIs, IFIs and other agencies that are trying to leverage resources<lb/> from the private sector, USD 5.9 billion was mobilised in 2014 for infrastructure through the use of guarantees, syndicated loans,<lb/> and shares in collective investment vehicles (CIVs) 13 . Specifically, guarantees and syndicated loans respectively mobilised 41-43%<lb/> of the total, while shares in CIVs mobilised about 16% (<ref type="figure">Figure 14</ref>). In terms of sectors, about two thirds (65%) of private sector<lb/> resources mobilised were in energy (predominantly renewables), followed by transport with roughly a fifth (22%), while smaller<lb/> proportions were mobilised in communication (8%) and water and sanitation (5%). These proportions are not entirely comparable<lb/> with the sectoral distribution of disbursements to the private sector mentioned above because the types of instruments covered<lb/> here are only a subset of those used to measure direct private sector support 14 . Moreover, guarantees are not captured in the<lb/> disbursements to the private sector as they are not flows.<lb/></p>

			<head>II. SPECIAL FOCUS ON MULTILATERAL DEVELOPMENT BANKS<lb/></head>

			<p>To better capture infrastructure finance by MDBs to developing countries, this section focuses on ODF by AfDB, AsDB, CAF, EBRD,<lb/> EIB, IADB Group, IsDB, and the WBG. The data used mainly include disbursements and commitments reported by the MDBs to the<lb/> DAC, as well data provided by them to the authors. In a few cases, estimations have been carried out by using data retrieved from<lb/> annual reports of the MDBs.<lb/></p>

			<head>Trend of MDB Financing for Infrastructure in Developing Countries<lb/></head>

			<p>In terms of trends, the volume of financing committed by the MDBs to infrastructure more than doubled between 2005 and 2014<lb/> at a compounded annual growth rate of 10%. In particular, between 2008 and 2009, ODF for infrastructure by MDBs rose by 67%,<lb/> driven mostly by the WBG, in order to counter the financial crisis (see <ref type="figure">Figure 16</ref>). Following 2009, aggregate financing from the<lb/> MDBs slowly and constantly decreased up to 2014, but nevertheless remained at higher levels than the pre-crisis period. The<lb/> EIB—whose financing to developing countries is only a small portion of its total operations 15 —is the only MDB that reduced its<lb/> financing to developing country infrastructure in the period 2005-2014.<lb/></p>

			<head>Largest MDBs Financing Infrastructure in Developing Countries<lb/></head>

			<p>In terms of actual disbursements to infrastructure, the MDBs collectively spent USD 31 billion in 2014, which corresponded to half<lb/> of total ODF for infrastructure by bilateral and multilateral development partners 16 . The top MDB by far was the WBG, which alone<lb/> accounted for 43%, i.e. USD 14 billion (see <ref type="figure">Figure 17</ref>). This figure includes amounts from IBRD, IDA and IFC, but excludes those<lb/> of Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency, as guarantees are not actual flows. The AsDB was the second largest with USD 5.4<lb/> billion. Unlike bilateral development partners, which provide the vast majority (81%) of their financing at concessional terms, most<lb/> of the financing from the MDBs examined was non-concessional (65%). In particular, the IsDB and EBRD financing was exclusively<lb/> at non-concessional terms. In contrast, the EIB was the only institution that provided practically all its finance at concessional<lb/> terms (97%).<lb/></p>

			<head>Share of Infrastructure Spending within all Sectors by Development Partners<lb/></head>

			<p>To gauge the importance of infrastructure in the portfolios, the share of infrastructure financing within all sector activities (i.e.<lb/> sector-allocable ODF, which excludes general budget support and non-programmable operations 17 ) was calculated. Among the<lb/> MDBs, IsDB, AfDB and AsDB allocated more than half of their sector-allocable ODF to infrastructure in 2014, whereas the rest<lb/> allocated between 26% and 40% (see <ref type="figure">Figure 18</ref>). This suggests that while the WBG was the top MDB in absolute terms, its focus<lb/> on infrastructure was less than some other institutions, such as IsDB, AfDB and AsDB.<lb/></p>

			<head>Regional Distribution of ODF for Infrastructure by MDBs<lb/></head>

			<p>In terms of regional distribution of infrastructure ODF by MDBs in 2014, Asia was the continent with the highest proportion (42%),<lb/> with Africa, Americas and developing Europe following with 30%, 18% and 10%, respectively (see <ref type="figure">Figure 19</ref>). However, Asia<lb/> received less ODF per capita than the other regions.<lb/></p>

			<head>Income-Level Distribution and Top Recipients of ODF for Infrastructure by<lb/> MDBs<lb/></head>

			<p>In contrast, the income level distribution of ODF by MDBs for infrastructure was almost proportional to the share of developing<lb/> country population by income group (see <ref type="figure">Figure 20</ref>). For example, the LICs received 19% of total amount, somewhat commensurate<lb/> to its population of 17%. At the same time, when examining the country breakdown, disbursements were extremely concentrated<lb/> in a few countries. In fact, the top five recipient countries received almost a third (31%) of the total amount, the top 10 received half<lb/> (49%) and the top 20 more than two thirds (68%). These top recipients were large emerging economies and more industrialised<lb/> developing countries such as, China, India, Brazil, Pakistan, Viet Nam and Turkey (see <ref type="figure">Figure 21</ref>). Among the top ten recipients,<lb/> Pakistan, Viet Nam and Turkey received a balanced mixture of ODA and OOF whereas the others received mainly or exclusively<lb/> non-concessional finance.<lb/></p>

			<head>ODF for Infrastructure Disbursed to Private Sector Companies by MDBs<lb/></head>

			<p>As with bilateral DFIs, MDBs provide financial support and advisory services to private companies and financial institutions<lb/> investing in infrastructure. Private sector operations of MDBs are either concentrated in specialised institutions, such as the IFC<lb/> and IIC, or in separate arms within the same MDB as in the case of</p>

			<table>AfDB and AsDB. Total financing disbursed directly to the private<lb/> sector by MDBs amounted to USD 4.4 billion in 2014, which corresponded to 2/3 of the total ODF for infrastructure disbursed to<lb/> the private sector by all development partners. Of this USD 4.4 billion, IFC provided half 18 and AsDB disbursed USD 0.7 billion, for<lb/> example (see Figure 24).<lb/> 18. As mentioned earlier, these figures do not include guarantees as they are not flows. However, amounts mobilised from the private sector for infrastructure captured below<lb/> include those leveraged by guarantees.<lb/> 19. See footnote 13.<lb/> 20. In January 2016 the MDBs convened a Task Force to develop a joint framework and methodology to measure private investment catalysed by the MDBs to advance the<lb/> commitment of mobilising/catalysing larger amounts of private investment to support the financing of the Sustainable Development Goals.<lb/></table>

			<p>By looking at the sectoral distribution of MDB disbursements to the private sector for infrastructure, energy received the biggest<lb/> share with 57% of total, followed by transport (25%), communications (15%) and water and sanitation (3%). As mentioned above<lb/> in the paragraph related to private sector instruments by all development partners, this distribution points to a stronger effort<lb/> of MDBs on energy and communication in private sector operations compared to the sectoral distribution of their ODF to public<lb/> institutions, probably because of higher investments by private companies in these two sectors.<lb/></p>

			<p>In terms of geographical distribution, Asia received 40%, Americas 24%, Europe 22% and Africa 14%. If compared to the distribution<lb/> of ODF to infrastructure for public sector operations, Europe received significantly more. This is due to the significant amounts<lb/> disbursed by IFC, EBRD and EIB to Turkey, which is the top recipient country of infrastructure ODF to the private sector with USD<lb/> 743 million (see <ref type="figure">Figure 25</ref>). This is followed by Brazil (USD 347 million), China (USD 318 million) and India (USD 271 million). In<lb/> general, UMICs received 61% of infrastructure ODF to the private sector by the MDBs, while LMICs received 30% and LICs only<lb/> 9%. Compared to bilateral DFIs, MDBs channelled their ODF to the private sector somewhat more towards higher income groups.<lb/></p>

			<head>Private Finance Mobilised through Guarantees, Syndicated Loans, and Shares<lb/> in CIVs by MDBs<lb/></head>

			<p>Based</p>

			<table>on data from the Survey mentioned above 19 , MDBs mobilised USD 3.1 billion in 2014. As noted before in the report, these<lb/> are only a subset of the instruments used by MDBs. Therefore, amounts mobilised by these institutions through all private sector<lb/> instruments are much higher 20 . The majority of the USD 3.3 billion was mobilised by syndicated loans (60%), while one third was<lb/> by guarantees (see <ref type="figure">Figure 26</ref>), and 9% by shares in CIVs. In terms of sectoral allocation of mobilised amounts from the private<lb/> sector, half was in energy (51%), while 35% was in transport. Water and sanitation and communication mobilised 8% and 6%,<lb/> respectively. Top recipient countries were Viet Nam, Cameroon, China, Jordan, Mexico and Indonesia (see <ref type="figure">Figure 27</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<head>MDBs&apos; Joint Declaration of Aspirations on Actions to Support Infrastructure<lb/> Investment<lb/></head>

			<p>As MDBs are key players in providing ODF for infrastructure in developing countries, including in directly supporting the private<lb/> sector, the G20 Investment and Infrastructure Working Group, particularly under the Chinese Presidency, reiterated the importance<lb/> of scaling up MDB financing for infrastructure. As a response, the MDBs issued a joint Declaration of Aspiration on Actions to<lb/> support infrastructure which laid out their quantitative ambitions to increase infrastructure finance in the coming years (see<lb/> <ref type="figure">Figure 28</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<p>While these aspirations indicate that MDBs will continue to be key players in supporting infrastructure in the near future, quantifying<lb/> the exact contribution of each institution would need to be harmonised:<lb/></p>

			<p>• First, the scope of infrastructure needs to be clearly defined, as some MDBs include social infrastructure in their targets<lb/> while others do not. Furthermore, even within economic infrastructure, some include sub-sectors, such as natural resource<lb/> extraction and municipal services, while others do not.<lb/> • Second, while most of the MDBs mainly support ODA-eligible countries, some provide significant amounts to more advanced<lb/> economies in Europe (i.e. EBRD, EIB). In this regard, it would be important to be able to distinguish the range of countries<lb/> that the aspirations cover, particularly since infrastructure financing needs in developing countries exceeds those of the<lb/> more advanced economies (<ref type="biblio">McKinsey 2016</ref>).<lb/> • Third, the unit of measurement of the aspirations should be consistently set as there is divergence in the way quantitative<lb/> ambitions are set, with some MDBs indicating absolute amounts, others percentages of annual increase in lending, and<lb/> others still pointing to the future share of infrastructure financing among total lending. This is problematic as without a<lb/> common yardstick among MDBs it is not possible to understand the exact amount that the institution is aspiring for and<lb/> compare these amounts across the institutions.<lb/> • Finally, the aspirations expressed through the Declaration may need to be approved by the respective boards of the MDBs<lb/> for it to be binding.<lb/></p>

			<p>In addition to harmonisation of data on the coverage of sectors and countries as well as the parameters of the commitments, the<lb/> establishment of a mechanism to monitor the extent to which the declarations are actually achieved would be useful. The OECD/<lb/> DAC, as a non-operational and neutral body that collects statistics, could be well placed to contribute to this monitoring function.<lb/></p>

			<head>SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS<lb/></head>

			<p>While relatively small in comparison to the financing needs of developing countries, ODF for infrastructure has been growing<lb/> significantly in the last decade in both absolute terms and as a share of development partners&apos; portfolios. In 2014, total ODF to<lb/> infrastructure amounted to USD 61 billion, 56% of which was concessional financing. In terms of providers, MDBs disbursed about<lb/> half of all ODF for infrastructure, while other large providers were G7 countries, EU Institutions and Korea.<lb/> In general, there was a high concentration of ODF for infrastructure in a few countries, especially large and industrialised emerging<lb/> economies, such as India, Vietnam, China and Brazil. Given that the supply side was also characterised by significant financing by a<lb/> few major development partners, the broad picture is that a few large development partners were supporting a few large emerging<lb/> economies. In terms of sectors, disbursements were mainly in transport and energy.<lb/> Direct support to the private sector represented 10% of total ODF to infrastructure in 2014, mainly in energy and for UMICs.<lb/> Furthermore, amounts mobilised by development partners from the private sector through guarantees, syndicated loans and<lb/> shares in CIVs were also concentrated in energy. This shows that the development partners and private sector collaborated most<lb/> in the energy sector, probably due to the commercial viability of energy projects.<lb/></p>

			<p>This report also focused on ODF to developing country infrastructure by the MDBs. In terms of trends, the volume of financing<lb/> committed to infrastructure by the MDBs doubled between 2005 and 2014. Unlike bilateral development partners, which provided<lb/> the vast majority of their financing at concessional terms, most of the financing from the MDBs was non-concessional. In terms<lb/> of direct financing to the private sector, MDBs disbursed 2/3 of total ODF for infrastructure to the private sector in 2014, half of<lb/> which was provided by IFC.</p>
