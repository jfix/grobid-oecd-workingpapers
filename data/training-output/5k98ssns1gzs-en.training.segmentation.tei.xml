			<body>This paper presents the outline and first results of an OECD project, undertaken under the auspices of <lb/>the Working Party of National Experts on Science and Technology Indicators (NESTI), on the <lb/>development and collection of internationally comparable indicators on public funding of R&amp;D. Direct <lb/>funding of R&amp;D is one of the main policy instruments used by governments to support science and <lb/>innovation in priority areas. As noted in the OECD Innovation Strategy, countries are restructuring and <lb/>adapting their research-financing mechanisms, for example by creating new agencies in charge of <lb/>allocating resources, making greater use of competitively awarded project funding and exploring how to tie <lb/>funding more closely to specific objectives and missions, increasing the focus on the quality and relevance <lb/>of institutions&apos; research activities in pursuit of research excellence and economic and social impact. These <lb/>changes highlight a gap in the range of available indicators to monitor how public funding of R&amp;D is <lb/>allocated. As a result, the NESTI project aims to propose a methodology for internationally comparable <lb/>indicators on modes of public funding; collecting such indicators and assessing the feasibility of extending <lb/>their scope by developing guidelines for the implementation of the methodology as part of the regular <lb/>indicator activities of OECD and other organisations like Eurostat. <lb/>Reflecting the evidence priorities highlighted above, this project has focused on drawing a distinction <lb/>between institutional and project funding. This distinction has been applied to estimates of funding levels <lb/>across sector of R&amp;D performance, types of funding agencies and the orientation of the R&amp;D from the <lb/>funders&apos; perspective. <lb/>This paper presents the results of the data collection across 18 participating countries, demonstrating <lb/>that it is possible to produce new policy relevant indicators on public funding of R&amp;D in addition to those <lb/>envisaged in the OECD Frascati Manual. The data collection initial findings highlight interesting <lb/>differences across countries in terms of their approaches to funding R&amp;D. But before conclusions can be <lb/>drawn on the effectiveness of the different country funding profiles, further work is needed in order to <lb/>increase the reliability and comparability of the different indicators. <lb/>* The author wishes to thank Pierre Therrien and Fernando Galindo-Rueda for their valuable advice in <lb/>producing this Working Paper. <lb/>DSTI/DOC(2012)4 <lb/>5 <lb/>MODES DE FINANCEMENT PUBLIC DE LA R-D : <lb/>VERS DES INDICATEURS COMPARABLES À L&apos;ÉCHELLE INTERNATIONALE <lb/>Jan van Steen* <lb/>RÉSUMÉ <lb/>Ce document présente les grandes lignes et les premiers résultats d&apos;un projet de l&apos;OCDE pour le <lb/>développement et la collecte d&apos;indicateurs comparables à l&apos;échelle internationale sur le financement public <lb/>de la R&amp;D, réalisé sous l&apos;égide du Groupe des Experts Nationaux sur les Indicateurs de la Science et de la <lb/>Technologie (GENIST). Le financement direct de la R-D est l&apos;un des principaux instruments utilisés par <lb/>les pouvoirs publics pour soutenir la science et l&apos;innovation dans les domaines prioritaires. Comme le <lb/>prévoit la Stratégie de l&apos;OCDE pour l&apos;innovation, les pays opèrent une restructuration et un <lb/>réaménagement de leurs mécanismes de financement de la recherche, par exemple en instituant de <lb/>nouveaux organes chargés de l&apos;allocation des ressources, en faisant davantage jouer la concurrence pour <lb/>l&apos;octroi de fonds aux projets de recherche, en cherchant les moyens d&apos;établir un lien plus direct entre le <lb/>financement et des objectifs et des missions spécifiques, en privilégiant davantage la qualité et la <lb/>pertinence des activités de recherche des établissements, au regard de critères d&apos;excellence et d&apos;impact <lb/>social et économique de la recherche. Ces évolutions ont mis en évidence l&apos;insuffisance de la gamme <lb/>d&apos;indicateurs disponibles pour analyser la manière dont sont affectées les aides publiques à la recherche. <lb/>Le projet du GENIST a par conséquent pour objet : de proposer une méthodologie pour le développement <lb/>d&apos;indicateurs comparables au niveau international sur les modalités de l&apos;aide publique ; de collecter ces <lb/>indicateurs ; d&apos;évaluer dans quelle mesure on pourra intégrer d&apos;autres pays ; et de mettre au point des <lb/>lignes directrices pour l&apos;application de cette méthodologie dans le cadre des activités régulières <lb/>d&apos;indicateurs de l&apos;OCDE et d&apos;autres organisations, comme Eurostat. <lb/>Compte tenu de ces besoins prioritaires en matière de données, ce projet s&apos;est axé sur l&apos;établissement <lb/>d&apos;une distinction entre financement par établissement et financement par projets. Cette distinction a été <lb/>appliquée aux estimations de niveaux de financement pour tous les secteurs d&apos;exécution de la R&amp;D, pour <lb/>toutes les catégories d&apos;organismes de financement et pour toutes orientations de la R&amp;D du point de vue <lb/>des bailleurs de fonds. <lb/>Ce document présente les résultats de la campagne de collecte de données réalisée dans les dix-huit <lb/>pays participants et montre qu&apos;il est possible de produire certains indicateurs pertinents pour les politiques <lb/>publiques sur le financement public de la R&amp;D qui ne figurent pas dans le Manuel de Frascati. Les <lb/>premières constatations issues de la collecte de données mettent en évidence d&apos;intéressantes différences <lb/>entre les pays dans leur approche du financement de la R&amp;D. Mais avant de pouvoir tirer des conclusions <lb/>sur l&apos;efficacité des différents modèles nationaux de financement, il faut peaufiner les différents indicateurs <lb/>de manière à améliorer leur fiabilité et leur comparabilité. <lb/></body>

			<body>Introduction <lb/>Within national R&amp;D systems, government funding is an important source of finance for R&amp;D. As <lb/>Figure 1 shows, for most countries it is the second major source of funds and the main one for a small <lb/>minority. The percentage of Gross Domestic Expenditure on R&amp;D (GERD) financed by government <lb/>ranges between 14 and 70%, with an average of 30 to 35%. Alongside other policies, the funding of private <lb/>or public research is one of the main instruments a government can use to promote science and research. <lb/>There are significant differences in the way governments fund and regulate their research organisations. <lb/>For example: in some countries research organisations like higher education institutions have a large <lb/>autonomy, while other countries are characterised by a relationship between the government as funder of <lb/>R&amp;D and R&amp;D performing research organisations, which is regulated by performance contracts. <lb/>Figure 1. Government funded R&amp;D as a percentage of total R&amp;D (GERD), 2008 (or latest year) <lb/>0 <lb/>10 <lb/>20 <lb/>30 <lb/>40 <lb/>50 <lb/>60 <lb/>70 <lb/>80 <lb/>Source: OECD Main Science and Technology Indicators, January 2012. <lb/>The OECD Innovation Strategy (OECD, 2010a) has shown that countries are restructuring and <lb/>adapting their research-financing mechanisms, for example by creating new agencies in charge of <lb/>allocating resources, making greater user of competitively awarded project funding and exploring how to <lb/>tie funding more closely to specific objectives and missions, increasing the focus on the quality and <lb/>relevance of institutions&apos; research activities in pursuit of research excellence and economic and social <lb/>impact. These changes highlight a gap in the range of available indicators to monitor how public funding <lb/>of R&amp;D is allocated. <lb/>DSTI/DOC(2012)4 <lb/>7 <lb/>In the framework of the OECD Frascati Manual (OECD, 2002), funding of R&amp;D by the government <lb/>is measured is two ways: a) by asking performers of R&amp;D across different sectors (business enterprises, <lb/>higher education, research institutes and private non profit) to specify the sources of funds – and <lb/>government in particular – for in-house (intramural) expenditures on R&amp;D; and b) by adopting a funder <lb/>perspective collecting data on government budget appropriations or outlays for R&amp;D (GBAORD). The <lb/>latter thus involves the analysis of government budgets and complementary sources. Countries follow both <lb/>approaches and data under both formats are covered in the Frascati Manual (OECD, 2002) and have been <lb/>collected for a large number of years by OECD and EUROSTAT. The funder-based data are mainly <lb/>classified by socio-economic objectives (SEO) according to the so-called NABS-classification <lb/>(Nomenclature for the Analysis and Comparison of Scientific Programmes and Budgets). GBAORD <lb/>data and their collection are described in Chapter 8 of the Frascati Manual (OECD, 2002). Because of the <lb/>different perspectives of data collection, the two data sets provide different types of policy-relevant <lb/>information. <lb/>At the moment, only a limited number of statistics and indicators on public funding are available, <lb/>principally government-funded R&amp;D in the different sectors of performance and government R&amp;D budgets <lb/>classified by socio-economic objectives. There is a widespread perception that the available indicators on <lb/>public funding do not align with the discussions and issues in actual science policy and the characteristics <lb/>of the science systems in the different countries (Lepori et al., 2007a). Lepori (2006) argues that the R&amp;D <lb/>statistical data have &quot; …. limitations due to the lack of categories and classifications that would be needed <lb/>for policy analysis &quot; . According to his vision, the design of the R&amp;D statistical system is &quot; …focusing on <lb/>input rather than on fluxes and producing national aggregates rather than data on sectors or on individual <lb/>organizations &quot; . In addition, the use of GBAORD data is not as common as that of performer based data <lb/>collected for the purposes of producing indicators of intramural expenditures, and international <lb/>comparisons are somewhat infrequent. No information is collected on funding agencies and instruments. <lb/>Because of the limited number of policy studies on the public funding of R&amp;D, researchers within the EU <lb/>Policies for Research and Innovation in the Move towards the European Research Area (PRIME) Network <lb/>of Excellence on research and innovation policy undertook an international study on the public funding of <lb/>R&amp;D projects and their cross-country comparability. The results of this study have been published in a <lb/>number <lb/>of <lb/>country <lb/>reports <lb/>and <lb/>scientific <lb/>articles, <lb/>available <lb/>on <lb/>www.enid-<lb/>europe.org/PRIME/project_funding.html. <lb/>At the 2008 Working Party of National Experts on Science and Technology Indicators (NESTI) <lb/>meeting, countries agreed to start an exploratory pilot project on developing indicators of public funding of <lb/>R&amp;D, drawing on the findings of the EU PRIME Network. A number of countries were willing and able to <lb/>participate in the project led by the Netherlands. 1 The general aim of the project was briefly formulated as <lb/>follows: &quot; to collect data on modes of public funding &quot; . Modes of public funding refer to the different ways <lb/>public funding is allocated in the R&amp;D system to beneficiaries, the organisations responsible for funding <lb/>decisions and the instruments used. <lb/>The project was initially envisaged with three specific aims: a) to propose a methodology for <lb/>internationally comparable indicators on public funding modes; b) to collect such indicators; c) to broaden <lb/>the scope of the project beyond the scope of the participating countries, to develop guidelines for the <lb/>implementation of the methodology on a larger scale and on a permanent basis as part of the regular <lb/>indicator activities of the international organisations OECD and EUROSTAT. It should eventually lead to <lb/>a revision of the Frascati Manual. The present paper focuses on the first two aims. <lb/>This document is structured as follows. Firstly, the rationale for new indicators and the conceptual <lb/>framework are set out. The description of the data collection process then gives way to the analysis of the <lb/>various indicators collected on public funding modes. It is important to note that the reported indicators are <lb/>experimental and, as a result, international comparability is still limited. The paper concludes with a <lb/></body>

			<body>summary review of the key issues encountered in collecting and comparing the data, leading to a final set <lb/>of recommendations for follow-up work. Annex 1 provides an overview of the definitions adopted <lb/>throughout the project, while Annex 2 sets out the indicators collected from participating countries. Annex <lb/>3 summarises the metadata collected from countries, highlighting some of the differences regarding data <lb/>availability and potential comparability. <lb/>Modelling public funding of R&amp;D through new indicators <lb/>The existing indicators on public funding of R&amp;D have a long tradition, particularly those providing a <lb/>breakdown of budget allocations across different socio-economic objectives (SEO), although by focusing <lb/>on direct funding they do not capture the full range of funding instruments, excluding for example R&amp;D <lb/>tax incentives – which are the object of separate regular collection by NESTI – and other indirect <lb/>mechanisms. Because governments on average are the second main funder of R&amp;D in the different <lb/>countries of the OECD with an average of 28% of total R&amp;D, budget allocations across dimensions other <lb/>than explicit socioeconomic objectives can have major impact on the way the national research systems are <lb/>organised and ultimately on their performance. Governmental research and science policy has evolved over <lb/>the years, reflecting debates on key policy issues such as the balance between institutional and project <lb/>funding and the balance between competitive versus non-competitive funding. While public R&amp;D funding <lb/>is one of the major instruments for steering the research system, many OECD countries introduced reforms <lb/>of their funding system to respond to new societal demands and challenges (Maass, 2003). New funding <lb/>schemes and instruments were developed and implemented, such as performance-based and competitive <lb/>funding programmes, the promotion of co-operation with the private sector, new centres of excellence, new <lb/>foundations and new problem-oriented research programmes. <lb/>Throughout this project, a simplified model of public R&amp;D funding flows has been used (Figure 1). <lb/>The model has three different layers. The indicators developed relate to these different levels. <lb/>a) The government or state level with its institutional funding of R&amp;D, to business enterprises, higher <lb/>education institutions or research institutes and project funding via a number of intermediary <lb/>organisations. These funding modes or general institutional funds refer to so-called block funds <lb/>that are allocated to research performing institutions with generally no strings attached on the one <lb/>hand (institutional funding) and funding based on grants from some kind of competitive funding <lb/>on the other (project funding). These funding modes also include the flow of funds going abroad, <lb/>either to performing organisations or international bodies that distribute those funds. <lb/>b) An intermediary level of organisations tasked with redistributing and allocating the R&amp;D funds to <lb/>the final beneficiaries. These organisations typically have some degree of operational <lb/>independence even if they may be formally part of governments. This level includes the <lb/>international funding agencies too. This includes national funding and international funding <lb/>agencies. <lb/>c) The level with organisations performing R&amp;D, which can be grouped into four R&amp;D sectors of <lb/>performance (business enterprises, higher education, government and private non-profit) alongside <lb/>organisations and institutes and (research) organisations abroad. The latter category also includes <lb/>extra-territorial organisations with activities located within the funding country (for a description <lb/>of these sectors, see the OECD Frascati Manual (OECD, 2002) sections 3.4 through to 3.7). <lb/></body>

			<body>Figure 1. An overall funding model <lb/>Source: Based on Lepori et. al. (2007b) <lb/>The key new classification for data collection on government R&amp;D funding introduced in this project <lb/>is based on the distinction between institutional funding and project funding. In the PRIME project, the <lb/>concept of project funding was defined as: &quot; money attributed to a group or an individual to perform a R&amp;D <lb/>activity limited in scope, budget and time, normally on the basis of the submission of a project proposal <lb/>describing the research activities to be done &quot; (Lepori et al., 2007b). It is important to highlight that the <lb/>concept of project funding does not primarily rely on funds being allocated on competition between <lb/>researchers or research groups, which is based on the submission of a research proposal. The main criteria <lb/>to distinguish between project 2 and institutional funding instruments are as follows: <lb/>• The aim of the funding instrument (from the perspective of the funding authority), rather than the <lb/>effective use of funds for R&amp;D activities.<lb/>• The existence of an agency tasked with selecting the project(s) to be funded and allocating the <lb/>money to R&amp;D performing beneficiaries. The agency can have a variety of forms such as a unit <lb/>within a ministry, or arms-length bodies such as research council or regional authorities.<lb/>In contrast, institutional funding can be defined as the funding of institutions with no direct <lb/>selection of projects or programmes to be performed. Under this type of funding, it is the receiving <lb/>institution that has discretion over the R&amp;D projects that are to be performed, not the funding organisation. <lb/>This project has considered classifications of funders and performers 3 which are consistent with the <lb/>Frascati Manual. A first distinction has been made between national and international funders and <lb/>performers. <lb/>Government <lb/>National funding agencies <lb/>Higher education sector <lb/>Government sector <lb/>Business enterprise sector <lb/>Internal <lb/>allocation <lb/>Project funding <lb/>Policy <lb/>and <lb/>advice (a) <lb/>Funders <lb/>(b) <lb/>Performing <lb/>organisations <lb/>(c) <lb/>Research <lb/>groups <lb/>Institutional <lb/>funding <lb/>European Union <lb/>International funding <lb/>organisations <lb/>Abroad <lb/>(International <lb/>research <lb/>organisations, <lb/>other …) <lb/>Advisory bodies <lb/>DSTI/DOC(2012)4 <lb/>10 <lb/>• Source of funding: national funding versus international funding. Among national funders, this <lb/>project has introduced a classification covering a range of different funding agencies. These <lb/>include research and higher education ministries, other ministries, independent agencies and <lb/>regional authorities.<lb/>• Destination of the funding: national versus international performers. Within the former, business <lb/>enterprises, higher education, government and private non profit are considered.<lb/>Table 1.

In total, these add up to the <lb/>national GBAORD plus the resource flows from international R&amp;D funding agencies. Six different <lb/>funding modes are distinguished, based on the distinction between project versus institutional funding, <lb/>national and international funding and national and international performers. The different indicators to be <lb/>collected can be related to the different cells of the table. Box 1 presents some examples of the different <lb/>funding modes. <lb/>DSTI/DOC(2012)4 <lb/>11 <lb/>Box 1. Examples of different funding modes <lb/>National public project funding to national performers [funding mode (1)] <lb/>•  R&amp;D domestic (commissioned) contracts from government. <lb/> •  R&amp;D contributions to the national funding agencies by Government (e.g. research council and innovation<lb/>promotion agencies who distribute funds on a programme or project basis). <lb/>National public institutional funding to national performers [funding mode (2)] <lb/>•  General university funds (GUF) -a separate category of government funding to the higher education sector. <lb/> •  Other institutional funds (governments R&amp;D intramural expenditure + residual R&amp;D contributions from the<lb/>government). <lb/>National public project funding to international performers [funding mode (3)] <lb/>•  Government-funded R&amp;D international contracts related to specific projects or programmes. <lb/> •  Contributions (annual membership fees) to EU-framework programmes (for European Free Trade<lb/>Association countries only) <lb/>•  Contributions (annual membership fees) to trans-national public R&amp;D programmes.<lb/>Examples of Europe-wide trans-national public R&amp;D programmes include: <lb/>•  ERA-NETs and ERA-NETs + <lb/> •  European Space Agency (ESA) <lb/> •  European Fusion Development Agreement (EFDA) <lb/> •  EUREKA <lb/> •  COST <lb/> •  EUROCORES <lb/> •  Article 169 initiatives: EDCTP (Europe-Developing Countries Clinical Trials Platform), Eurostars (for<lb/>research-performing SMEs) and AAL (ambient assisted living for the elderly). <lb/>•  Joint technology initiatives such as ENIAC (embedded computing systems), ARTEMIS (nanoelectronics).<lb/>In the case of ESA, the membership fee is treated as project funding, since ESA redistributes this in the form of <lb/>project funding, based on agreed &quot; retour &quot; principles, and in this sense differs from the membership fee of the EU. <lb/>National public institutional funding to international performers [funding mode (4)] <lb/>•  Contributions (annual membership fees) to international organisations (trans-national public R&amp;D<lb/>performers with own dedicated R&amp;D facilities). The (board of the) organisation decides about the <lb/>programmes or projects to perform within the organisation. <lb/>Examples of transnational public R&amp;D performers with own dedicated R&amp;D facilities: <lb/>•  The European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) <lb/> •  The Institute Laue-Langevin (ILL) <lb/> •  The European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF) <lb/> •  European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL) <lb/> •  The European Southern Observatory (ESO) <lb/> •  Joint Research Centre of the European Commission (JRC)<lb/>International public project funding to national performers [funding mode (5)] <lb/>Examples of project funding from international organizations: <lb/>•  Projects financed by the EU Framework Programme<lb/>International public institutional funding to national performers [funding mode (6)] <lb/>This category is included as a theoretical possibility for which examples are difficult to identify. It would <lb/>encompass contributions from international organisations to national performers on an institutional basis. <lb/>DSTI/DOC(2012)4 <lb/>12 <lb/>In addition to the distinction between project and institutional funding and the national versus <lb/>international dimension, this project has also introduced a new classification for the type of government <lb/>instruments funding R&amp;D. This &quot; instrument type &quot; classification is based on the primary purpose or <lb/>objective pursued by Government in providing funding, on the basis of the likely use of the knowledge <lb/>supported by the funds. This classification is described in Box 2. <lb/>Box 2. Examples of other funding taxonomies – instrument types <lb/>•  Academic instruments<lb/>The primary purpose of these instruments is the advancement of knowledge for the general <lb/>benefit of society. Funding can be provided by different funding agencies, such as contributions <lb/>from an independent or arms-length agency, e.g. project funding from a research council funding <lb/>research programmes or projects based on bottom-up proposals from researchers, except research <lb/>oriented programmes with clear politics aims. But it can be funding from other agencies too. <lb/>•  Policy instruments<lb/>The primary purpose of these instruments is the contribution of commissioned research from <lb/>ministries or an independent or arms-length agencies&apos; funding programmes to inform and support <lb/>policy decisions or to fund programmes for knowledge generation within priority policy areas. <lb/>•  Innovation instruments<lb/>The primary purpose of these instruments is the contribution to the innovative capacity of <lb/>enterprises through R&amp;D. Contributions from ministries of economic affairs or innovation agencies <lb/>to business R&amp;D programmes typically feature under this category. <lb/>Data collection and data sources used <lb/>Different indicators were developed in the project which are related to the different cells or funding <lb/>modes of the table. The questionnaire which was used for the data collection at the end of 2009 was based <lb/>on the following five indicators on public funding: <lb/>1. National public funding by funding type and destination (national and international performers); <lb/>related to funding modes (1), (2), (3) and (4). <lb/>2. National public funding to national performers by funding type and sector of performance; <lb/>related to funding modes (1)and (2). <lb/>3. Public project funding to national performers by funding agency; related to funding <lb/>modes (1)and (5). <lb/>4. National public project funding to national performers by instrument; related to funding mode <lb/>(1). <lb/>5. International funding to national performers by sector of performance; related to funding modes <lb/>(5)and (6). <lb/>In order to construct the indicators, data were collected from countries participating in the project on a <lb/>voluntary basis. Data were requested for three years: 2000, 2005 and 2008 (or nearest year) as set out in <lb/>Annex 2, using the definitions provided in Annex 1. Based on a common format and pre-defined questions, <lb/>countries were also asked to provide metadata on the data collection: information on some characteristics <lb/>of the data source, examples of institutional funding and funding agencies and methodological problems <lb/>encountered. The results are summarised in Annex 3. <lb/>DSTI/DOC(2012)4 <lb/>13 <lb/>As can be seen from the country metadata, the national GBAORD data collection is the main data <lb/>source in all countries, with budget items as the basic unit of analysis in most cases. These basic units were <lb/>classified according to the different variables within the questionnaire. In a number of cases the <lb/>classification was done on the basis of relevant complementary documents or information from external <lb/>experts. In some cases, the statistical agencies had to send information requests to experts in ministries or <lb/>other research funding bodies in order to obtain the relevant budget information for the classification. <lb/>The indicators of public funding modes: relevance, definitions used and descriptive analysis <lb/>This section presents the five indicators, describing in some detail on a one by one basis their <lb/>relevance, the definitions used, the resulting data and emerging results. <lb/>Indicator 1: National public funding by funding type and destination (national or international <lb/>performers) <lb/>The indicator focuses on total GBAORD within a country. It includes national and international <lb/>performers funding, which can be either project funding or institutional funding. This indicator relates to <lb/>the funding modes (1), (2), (3) and (4) of Table 1. <lb/>Relevance <lb/>The indicator is oriented to national public policies on research funding. It characterises the <lb/>organisation of national public funding, the distribution over different funding categories and the relative <lb/>contribution of institutional funding vis à vis project-based funding. This indicator can be used in principle <lb/>for snapshot cross-country comparisons. If longitudinal data are available, it can be used to show shifts in <lb/>the composition of national public funding, such as a shift from institutional funding to project funding. <lb/>Definitions used <lb/>National public funding comprises national public project funding and national public institutional <lb/>funding. The latter can be divided into institutional funding to the higher education sector – via the <lb/>estimated portion of General University Fund (GUF) devoted to R&amp;D – and institutional funding to other <lb/>public organisations or private companies. Project funding has no further sub-classification. <lb/>Data and results <lb/>Full data on this indicator are available for 17 countries, and partial information is available for one <lb/>additional country. Figure 3 shows the distribution of total national funding by all different funding modes <lb/>and destinations, national as well as international. Total national funding equals GBAORD for all <lb/>countries. <lb/>Table 2 and Figure 4 focus on the funding to national performers. Table 2 shows the development of <lb/>the share of project funding for 2000, 2005 and 2008 and Figure 4 focuses on the share of GUF in total <lb/>institutional funding to national performers. <lb/>DSTI/DOC(2012)4 <lb/>14 <lb/>Figure 3.

			<body>DSTI/DOC(2012)4 <lb/>15 <lb/>Figure 4. General University Funds as a percentage <lb/>of national public institutional funding to national performers <lb/>Source: OECD, based on experimental data collection from the NESTI project on public R&amp;D funding, September 2010. <lb/>Main findings <lb/>• Public R&amp;D funding schemes vary widely between countries. Countries such as Switzerland, <lb/>Denmark, the Netherlands, Austria and Poland rely mainly on institutional funding (at a level of <lb/>around 70%), while Ireland, Belgium, and New Zealand devote more than 50% of public funding <lb/>to project funding.<lb/>• In the period 2000-2008 there seems to be a relative stability between modes of public R&amp;D <lb/>funding for most countries (at least for the countries with data for more than one year). <lb/>Exceptions are Australia and Austria where the share of project funding increases sharply. But <lb/>when one looks at the range of countries for which data were collected as part of the PRIME <lb/>project on public project funding 4 the long-term trend of public R&amp;D funding seems to show an <lb/>increase in project funding at the expense of institutional funding (Lepori et. al. (2007b)). The <lb/>data for the countries participating both in the PRIME project and in the OECD project (Austria, <lb/>Norway, Switzerland, the Netherlands) show that all countries experienced a considerable <lb/>increase in the share of project funding over the period 1970-2002. In Figure 5, longitudinal data <lb/>for Australia and the Netherlands shows a sharp increase in the share of project funding for <lb/>Australia after 2000. The project share for the Netherlands increases between 1975 and 1990 and <lb/>remained broadly stable since after an initial decline in the early 1990s.<lb/>• In half of the countries institutional funding of universities (GUF) takes up an important part of <lb/>total institutional funding, with a share above 50%, even up to 94% in Denmark. In the other <lb/>countries GUF plays a more modest role. However, the data should be treated with some caution, <lb/>because as is well known, not all countries can identify GUF separately (e.g. Korea) and the <lb/>methods applied can also differ.<lb/>• National public funding to international research organizations seems to be a minor component of <lb/>national public R&amp;D funding (usually less than 5%) except for Switzerland and Belgium, which <lb/>devote more than 10% of their public R&amp;D funding to such international organizations.<lb/>DSTI/DOC(2012)4 <lb/>16 <lb/>• Although international project funding from abroad is an important funding source in a number <lb/>of countries (&gt; 10% of total R&amp;D in a country) and should be considered when dealing with <lb/>funding issues, this indicator excludes international funding in terms of funding from abroad. The <lb/>indicator is restricted to national public funding sources of R&amp;D. Funding from abroad is <lb/>considered in indicators 3 and 5.<lb/>Figure 2. Figure 5. National public project funding to national performers <lb/>As a percentage of national public funding to national performers, Australia and the Netherlands, 1975-2005 <lb/>Source: OECD, based on experimental data collection from the NESTI project on public R&amp;D funding. Dutch data provided by <lb/>the Rathenau Institute based on data from the Dutch Ministry of Education, Culture and Science. <lb/>Indicator 2: National public funding to national performers by funding type and sector of performance <lb/>This indicator focuses on GBAORD funding to national performers. It follows the taxonomy adopted <lb/>for indicator 1 (funding type) but disaggregated further by the R&amp;D sector of performance. This indicator <lb/>relates to the funding modes (1) and (2). <lb/>Relevance <lb/>The indicator is intended to illustrate how governments support different types of national R&amp;D <lb/>performers through different mechanisms, highlighting for example the extent to which support for higher <lb/>education is mainly institutional or project-focused, compared with other sectors <lb/>Definitions used <lb/>National public project funding to national performers and national public institutional funding to <lb/>national performers. The national sector of performance is defined according to the Frascati Manual <lb/>definitions: business enterprise sector, higher education sector, government sector and private non profit <lb/>sector. <lb/>DSTI/DOC(2012)4 <lb/>17 <lb/>Data and results <lb/>Data on this indicator are available for 15 countries. Figure 6 shows the allocation of national public <lb/>funds to national performers separately for both project and institutional funding. This indicator excludes <lb/>international public funding (funds from abroad). This funding is considered in indicators 3 and 5. The <lb/>indicator also excludes national funding to international organisations and other funding of R&amp;D abroad. 5 <lb/>It is therefore restricted to national public funding sources of R&amp;D. <lb/>Main findings <lb/>• The higher education sector is the main destination of institutional funding (mostly through GUF <lb/>funding). In nine countries this sector accounts for more than half of institutional funds. <lb/>However, there are also a number of countries with a substantial share of institutional funding <lb/>allocated to the government sector: Korea, Czech Republic, Belgium, Poland and Australia <lb/>allocate more than 50% of their institutional funds to this sector. The cases of institutional <lb/>funding to the business enterprise sector are rare, but exist in the Czech Republic, Israel and <lb/>Austria. In these countries the share of institutional funding in the business enterprise sector <lb/>ranges between 1% and 6%. In four other countries the share is 1%, while in the rest there is no <lb/>institutional funding to businesses. The exact nature of this funding should be further <lb/>investigated.<lb/>• The sector of destination of project funding is more diversified. However, the public sector <lb/>(broadly defined in this case as the combination of higher education and government) has the <lb/>largest share in the majority of countries, with the exception of Austria (where the share of <lb/>businesses is 63%). However, in quite a number of countries (ten) the share of business <lb/>enterprises is significant (20% or more).<lb/>• Data for this indicator should be treated with caution, because the allocation of budget items to <lb/>one of the sectors is not always clear, and some budget items can have multiple performers, in the <lb/>public as well as in the private sector.<lb/>DSTI/DOC(2012)4 <lb/>18 <lb/>Figure 6.

We focus here on project versus institutional funding within the higher education and the <lb/>government sectors (Figure 7). <lb/>Figure 7.

There are a few exceptions: Korea, Belgium and Australia.<lb/>• This pattern is even stronger in the government sector. Only Korea has a share of institutional <lb/>funding that is less than 50%.<lb/>• These results should also be interpreted with some caution, particularly in the Canadian case <lb/>where all government performance was – due to lack of better data – allocated to institutional <lb/>funding.<lb/>DSTI/DOC(2012)4 <lb/>20 <lb/>Indicator 3: Public project funding to national performers by funding agency (source of funding) <lb/>This indicator focuses on the part of GBAORD funding dedicated to national performers through <lb/>project funding. This indicator also includes project funding from abroad (international public project <lb/>funding to national performers). This indicator relates to funding modes (1) and (5) of Table 1. <lb/>Relevance <lb/>This indicator facilitates a better understanding of the decision-making process regarding the <lb/>allocation of R&amp;D funding at a project level. This type of information can be used in principle to inform <lb/>further work on funding models within a country&apos;s innovation policy mix, the analysis of shifts in the locus <lb/>of decision-making over time and comparisons between countries&apos; organisation of research funding and its <lb/>overall effectiveness. <lb/>Definitions used <lb/>Funding agencies, which are defined as agencies which allocate project funding, have been divided <lb/>into four general categories: <lb/>a) National government organisations with policy and funding responsibilities, such as research, <lb/>higher education or other ministries. <lb/>b) Sub-national authorities, such as states, regions or (significant) local authorities. <lb/>c) Independent agencies or agencies at arms-length, such as research councils or innovation <lb/>agencies. The following criteria were defined as possible criteria to identify these agencies: <lb/>having a well-defined budget (separated from the general state budget); a performance contract <lb/>with the state; the right to take the final decision on the projects; strategic autonomy in the <lb/>repartition of the budget between fields and activities. <lb/>d) Supra-national and international agencies, such as the European Commission. <lb/>Data and results <lb/>Data on this indicator are available for 15 countries. Figure 8 displays results on the various agencies <lb/>that are responsible for the allocation of R&amp;D project funding. The main distinction is between ministries <lb/>and independent agencies. For reasons of international comparability the figure is limited to national <lb/>funding agencies funding national performers only. Comparable data on funding from international sources <lb/>is not available for all countries and therefore excluded. These funding flows from abroad are not part of <lb/>GBAORD. The indicator also excludes national public funding to international organisations and other <lb/>funding of R&amp;D going abroad and excludes national public institutional funding to national performers. <lb/>Regarding the international funding flows, the availability and usefulness of other data sources could <lb/>be examined, such as the Annual Activity Reports of the EU (Directorate General for Research) in the case <lb/>of European countries. <lb/>DSTI/DOC(2012)4 <lb/>21 <lb/>Figure 8.

The indicator focuses on project funding only and excludes institutional funding. <lb/>The reason is that institutional funding can also have different orientations, but that&apos;s not the purpose of <lb/>giving institutional funding. It gives the receiving organisation freedom to perform R&amp;D according to its <lb/>own mission and profile. The data collection also excludes funding from abroad. This indicator relates to <lb/>the funding mode (1). <lb/>Relevance <lb/>The government policies on public project funding, implemented via research programmes, can have <lb/>different orientations: academically oriented, policy oriented or innovation oriented. The main interest is to <lb/>identify what is the weight of the different orientations within each country, and whether there are <lb/>significant differences across countries. <lb/>Definitions used <lb/>Academic instruments; policy support instruments; innovation instruments; and national public <lb/>project funding to national performers. <lb/>Data and results <lb/>Data on this indicator are available for ten countries. Several countries reported having problems in <lb/>allocating the budgets to one of the instrument types. Data for this indicator for reporting countries should <lb/>therefore be treated with caution and interpreted as global estimates, because of the subjective element in <lb/>the allocation decision. Figure 9 shows the allocation of national public project funding to national <lb/>performers by three types of instruments. This indicator is restricted to national public funding sources of <lb/>R&amp;D. Funding to international performers is excluded. Funding from international agencies is not included <lb/>in this indicator. <lb/>Figure 9.

But results should be treated and analysed <lb/>with care (see next section for more details). The primary purpose of the instrument is the leading <lb/>principle when categorising the funding (see Section 8.7.1 of the Frascati Manual). These should <lb/>be considered as broad definitions which need to be further tested and improved by the <lb/>participating countries.<lb/>Indicator 5: International funding to national performers by sector of performance <lb/>This indicator focuses on the funding from abroad and the sector where the R&amp;D is performed. It <lb/>relates to funding mode (5). <lb/>Relevance <lb/>Internationalisation, globalisation and international funding flows are also becoming more important <lb/>within the public funding domain. For example, trans-national co-operation and trans-national funding <lb/>flows are important elements of co-operation within the European Research Area (ERA). Public policies to <lb/>promote such cooperation have become an important feature of the European landscape, both at the <lb/>European Union level as well as at national level. In order to improve policies for the ERA, it is important <lb/>to know what amount of public budget involves trans-national flows in both outward and inward <lb/>directions. A first distinction concerning outward flows can be made between trans-national funding to <lb/>international research organisations with dedicated R&amp;D facilities (such as CERN, EMBL and ESO) and <lb/>other trans-national flows (for example based on bilateral agreements and development co-operation). <lb/>Other types of information relevant for understanding trans-national co-operation include the identity of <lb/>the organisations involved and the type of programmes in place. International collaboration mechanisms <lb/>involving state funding also apply to varying degrees of importance to other non-European countries. <lb/>Another type of trans-national flow (inward) concerns project funding from international agencies to <lb/>national performers, which is of increasing importance for national R&amp;D performance. <lb/>Findings <lb/>• The data collection already showed that it is difficult for countries to collect these data. It was <lb/>discussed and accepted to drop this indicator and to limit the data collection to GBAORD data <lb/>only. <lb/> • Because data collection for this indicator was difficult in the context of this project, it is <lb/>suggested not to incorporate data collection on these funding flows in the project, but to design <lb/>separate projects on the issue of international funding flows. The results are of course <lb/>complementary.<lb/>Data collection and methodological issues <lb/>This section provides a general description of the way the different countries have collected the data <lb/>for their country, with further details available in Annex 3. For all countries participating in the project, the <lb/>national GBAORD database was the main source of data. However, in a number of cases, additional <lb/>information from administrative documents or from direct requests to other organisations was needed to <lb/>allocate the budget items properly to the different classifications as the national GBAORD database did not <lb/>contain all the necessary information. <lb/>DSTI/DOC(2012)4 <lb/>25 <lb/>Throughout this phase of the project, a number of methodological issues and issues on definitions <lb/>were identified that require further clarification. Examples are the distinction between project and <lb/>institutional funding, the classification of funding by sector of performance, the classification of funding <lb/>agencies and the definition of instrument types. Work needs to be done to improve definitions and <lb/>classifications as well as to provide examples of &quot; difficult &quot; cases. Information should be collected in order <lb/>to see how the participating countries dealt with them. Although the questionnaire contained a number of <lb/>definitions and examples to assist participating countries in identifying different funding modes and <lb/>variables, some definitions were still found to be unclear, particularly for independent agencies and type of <lb/>instruments. The next paragraphs describe some of the priorities for further work to be done on definitions <lb/>and methodology. <lb/>The distinction between project and institutional funding <lb/>The distinction between project and institutional funding is one of the main significant contributions <lb/>of this project. Until now, the separation has not been part of the regular data collection of GBAORD. At <lb/>first sight, it seemed not to be too difficult for the participating countries to classify the GBAORD data <lb/>according to these two funding modes. In most cases, the required information was already included in the <lb/>data source. In some cases information from staff responsible for specific budget items or additional <lb/>background information was needed to make the necessary distinction. However, discussions with the <lb/>participating countries led to the conclusion that we need to specify the characteristics of institutional <lb/>funding, especially delineating the border with project funding. This relates to the question of the specific <lb/>locus of decision making about the funding into projects. Is it the government, the intermediary <lb/>organisations or the performing units? <lb/>The classification of funding by sector of performance <lb/>The experience with this indicator appears to be mixed. While some countries encountered no <lb/>methodological problems, others reported allocation problems in specific cases: <lb/>•  The main issue arises when funding goes to multiple sectors or a network of researchers: to <lb/>which sector should the funding be allocated when the performers are located in multiple <lb/>sectors? 6 Should the funding be apportioned to the relevant sectors?<lb/>•  Blurred borders between different sectors make it difficult to allocate some of the funding and the <lb/>sector of performance is not always easy to determine. For instance:<lb/>-<lb/>Distinguishing between non-for profit, business and higher education sector. <lb/>-<lb/>The legal status of an institution receiving public funding may not necessarily be a good <lb/>descriptor of an institution&apos;s actual role, as in the case of institutes under ministerial control <lb/>but primarily providing services business enterprises. Should such an institute be classified <lb/>to the government sector or the business enterprise sector? <lb/>DSTI/DOC(2012)4 <lb/>26 <lb/>•  Some countries raised the problem of allocating funds for intramural R&amp;D performed within <lb/>government. 7 For example, Canada allocated all government intramural R&amp;D to institutional <lb/>funding, because it was not possible to provide a satisfactory breakdown by type of funding. This <lb/>resulted in no project funding being identified as having been performed by the government <lb/>sector in Canada. For the next wave, clearer guidelines should be issued.<lb/>In most of these cases, external information (administrative documents; annual reports of <lb/>organisations in the private sector; etc.) would be needed to better allocate funding to the right sector of <lb/>performance. <lb/>The classification of project funding by funding agency <lb/>In general, participating countries did not encounter major methodological difficulties (and most <lb/>countries gave examples of independent agencies in their country). However, the classification of project <lb/>funding by type of funding agency could be supported by clearer guidelines and definitions. It could be the <lb/>case that some of the large differences between countries can be explained by classification issues. For the <lb/>next wave of data collection, this issue will need to be addressed, for example by adding additional criteria <lb/>such as the existence of some kind of legal status, performance contracts, control mechanisms and the <lb/>location of the ultimate decision-making responsibility. It&apos;s also important to collect additional information <lb/>on independent agencies. <lb/>The classification of project funding by instrument type <lb/>Several countries faced issues with definition and budget allocation by instrument type. Subjective <lb/>judgments had to be used in combination with different assumptions. <lb/>• The proposed definitions were not detailed enough to make a clear distinction between instrument <lb/>type. For the next wave, this issue will need to be addressed. <lb/> • As in the case of the present GBAORD data collection, projects should be classified according to <lb/>the primary objective of the funding (see also Chapter 8.7 of the Frascati Manual). <lb/> • One way forward, although still a global way of classifying, would be to use the NABS <lb/>classification for defining categories. Items with the NABS-code &quot; industrial production &quot; could be <lb/>treated as innovation instruments, the items with the code &quot; advancement of knowledge &quot; could be <lb/>treated as academic instruments and the other as policy or thematic instruments. Another solution <lb/>would be to look from the perspective of the funding agency: research council (= academic), <lb/>innovation agency (= innovation), ministry of industry (= innovation), ministry of research <lb/>(= academic), other ministries (= policy or thematic), but this could be a too simple solution.<lb/>Conclusions <lb/>The NESTI project on modes of public funding of R&amp;D was initiated with three general aims: &quot; a) to <lb/>propose a methodology for internationally comparable indicators on public funding modes; b) to collect <lb/>such indicators; c) to broaden the scope of the project beyond the scope of the participating countries, to <lb/>develop guidelines for the implementation of the methodology on a larger scale and on a permanent basis <lb/>as part of the regular indicator activities of the international organisations OECD and EUROSTAT. &quot; The <lb/>findings of this project could be used in a future revision of the GBAORD section of the OECD Frascati <lb/>Manual. <lb/>From the results of this phase of the project, it is possible to draw a number of conclusions on the <lb/>adequateness of GBAORD as data source, the comparability of the new data and the results obtained so <lb/>far. <lb/>DSTI/DOC(2012)4 <lb/>27 <lb/>National GBAORD data can be used as a useful and potential source for data collection <lb/>Seventeen out of the eighteen participating countries were able to build indicators by funding type <lb/>(institutional vs. project funding). Fifteen countries reported data concerning project funding agencies and <lb/>funding mode by sector of performance, and ten countries could report data on project funding by type of <lb/>instrument. <lb/>In this –experimental– phase of the project, a large number of OECD countries participated. For a full <lb/>implementation of the data collection, participation and data from more countries would need to be <lb/>secured. The next project phase seeks to involve more countries in order to make a broader use of <lb/>GBAORD data, in full awareness that some countries articulated problems with adapting their data into the <lb/>new classifications. <lb/>Finally, the main advantage of this methodology is the use of existing data, which can, in some cases, <lb/>be relatively easily complemented with additional, relatively easy-to-access information. <lb/>Complementary qualitative data is required to interpret results <lb/>Collecting quantitative data on public funding is not sufficient to enable their interpretation. Based on <lb/>the data collected it is difficult to assess the reasons behind the differences between countries. For <lb/>example, it is not clear how the large differences between countries with regard to the share of project <lb/>funding should be interpreted alongside qualitative information on funding policies of R&amp;D, on funding <lb/>systems, funding agencies, funding mechanisms and funding practices as both a test of and complement to <lb/>the new quantitative indicators on funding patterns. <lb/>A basic level of international comparability appears to be attainable <lb/>Participating countries were sufficiently confident about the reliability of their data for it be published <lb/>and presented subject to the adequate health warnings. The publication &quot; Measuring innovation: A new <lb/>perspective &quot; (OECD, 2010b) made use of the results of the exercise and published two figures based on <lb/>these GBAORD-based indicators: one with government budgets by national sector of performance <lb/>(indicator 3) and the other government funded R&amp;D in higher education by type of funding (also <lb/>indicator 3). <lb/>The exercise has so far revealed the potential of using existing data on public funding for the <lb/>development and construction of a number of policy relevant indicators on public funding. The results <lb/>should however still be treated as preliminary. Improvements are likely to follow as the methodology is <lb/>tested across a large number of countries and the resulting data are analysed alongside qualitative and other <lb/>complementary data sources. <lb/>DSTI/DOC(2012)4 <lb/>28 <lb/>NOTES <lb/>1. <lb/>Country indicators were provided by Hsien Toh (Australia), Andreas Schiefer and Gerhard Wallner (Austria), <lb/>Emmanuel Monard (Belgium), Louise Earl (Canada), Václav Sojka (Czech Republic), Nicolaj Helm-Petersen <lb/>(Denmark), Tero Luhtala (Finland), Thomas Loetzner (Germany), Andrew Stockman (Ireland), Nava Brenner <lb/>(Israel), Woo-Sung Lee (Korea), Jan van Steen (Netherlands), Stuart King (New Zealand), Bo Sarpebakken <lb/>(Norway), Jan Kozłowski (Poland), Edita Novotna (Slovak Republic), Carolina Thulin (Sweden), and <lb/>Elisabeth Pastor and Franz Martin (Switzerland). <lb/>2. <lb/>The notion of project can be interpreted in a broader sense to encompass research programmes, since a <lb/>programme can also have the same characteristics as a project (limited in scope, budget and time), only the <lb/>scale is usually larger, <lb/>3. <lb/>There is a subtle distinction between performers and beneficiaries of funding. Beneficiaries of public funding <lb/>may in some cases outsource some of the R&amp;D to third parties that may belong to a different sector, for <lb/>example in the case of business beneficiaries that procure R&amp;D services from higher education or public <lb/>research institutes. The adoption of a funding perspective implies that in the majority of cases it is only <lb/>possible to identify the beneficiary, as opposed to the final performer. <lb/>4. <lb/>Because the data collection in the PRIME project differed from the OECD data collection, the data are not <lb/>readily comparable. <lb/>5. <lb/>Funding of international performers is not included because GBAORD data do not provide the information on <lb/>the sector of performance. <lb/>6. <lb/>The issue of project funding involving different actors (therefore different sectors of performance) was <lb/>discussed at the last working group meeting (November 2009). The general consensus was that it had so far <lb/>only affected a small share of overall funding and does not appear to pose a major problem at present. <lb/>However, it was strongly felt that this type of funding will gain in importance over time as policies <lb/>increasingly focus on fostering collaborations and will therefore need to be taken into account in future <lb/>discussions. <lb/>7. <lb/>The OECD Frascati Manual defined intramural R&amp;D as &quot; all expenditures for R&amp;D performed within a <lb/>statistical unit or sector of the economy during a specific period, whatever the source of funds. &quot; (OECD, 2002, <lb/>para. 34) <lb/></body>

It is the sum of national public funding and international public funding to <lb/>national projects. <lb/>National public funding to national performers (1+2) is defined as the sum of national public funding to <lb/>national projects and national public funding to national research institutions. <lb/>Total international public funding = International public funding to national projects and national <lb/>research institutions (5+6) is defined as the R&amp;D flows from public international organisations abroad to <lb/>a specific country. (European and international agencies: international organisations, including the <lb/>European Commission). <lb/>FUNDING TYPES <lb/>1. National public funding to national projects is defined as the total of national budgets in a <lb/>given country, attributed to a group or an individual to perform a R&amp;D activity limited in <lb/>scope, budget and time, normally on the basis of the submission of a project proposal <lb/>describing the research activities to be done. Funded by public national sources. <lb/>2. National public funding to national research institutions is defined as the total of national <lb/>budgets in a given country, attributed to an institution, for which money the organisation has <lb/>more or less freedom to define the research activities to be performed (also called block <lb/>funding). A distinction is made between general university funds and other institutional <lb/>funds. Funded by public national sources. <lb/>3. National public funding to international projects is defined as the part of GBAORD or <lb/>other data sources on public funding that goes abroad and is not going to international <lb/>research organisations. <lb/>4. National public funding to international organisations is defined as the part of GBAORD <lb/>or other data sources on public funding (national contribution) that goes to international <lb/>research organisations. <lb/>DSTI/DOC(2012)4 <lb/>31 <lb/>5. International public funding to national projects is defined as the total of international <lb/>public budgets in a given country, attributed to a group or an individual to perform a R&amp;D <lb/>activity limited in scope, budget and time, normally on the basis of the submission of a <lb/>project proposal describing the research activities to be done. Funded by public international <lb/>sources. This is not included within the scope of GBAORD data. <lb/>6. National public funding to national sector of performance is defined as the sum of national <lb/>public funding to national projects and national public funding to national research <lb/>institutions broken down by institutional sector beneficiary. <lb/>SOURCE OF FUNDING <lb/>National funding agencies: agencies which are directly part of the national state administration, such as <lb/>ministries, offices and similar bodies. A subdivision could be the distinction between the research and <lb/>higher education ministry and other (sectoral) ministries, such as a ministry of economic affairs or <lb/>agriculture. <lb/>Independent agencies: agencies enjoying strong autonomy in respect to the state in their management and <lb/>decision-making process, such as research councils, or innovation agencies. <lb/>Regional authorities: agencies that are part of the regional and local state administration. <lb/>European and international agencies: international organisations, including the European Commission <lb/>SECTOR OF PERFORMANCE <lb/>Business enterprise sector: see OECD Frascati Manual 2002, Chapter 3.4. <lb/>The sector is composed of: <lb/>• All firms, organisations and institutions whose primary activity is the market production of goods <lb/>or services (other than higher education) for sale to the general public at an economically <lb/>significant price and,<lb/>• The private non-profit institutions mainly serving them.<lb/>Higher education sector: see OECD Frascati Manual 2002, Chapter 3.7. <lb/>The sector is composed of: <lb/>• All universities, colleges of technology and other institutions of post-secondary education, <lb/>whatever their source of finance or legal status.<lb/>• All research institutes, experimental stations and clinics operating under the direct control of or <lb/>administered by or associated with higher education institutions.<lb/>DSTI/DOC(2012)4 <lb/></body>

			<body>Government sector: see OECD Frascati Manual 2002, Chapter 3.5. <lb/>The sector is composed of: <lb/>• All departments, offices and other bodies which furnish, but normally do not sell to the <lb/>community, those common services, other than higher education, which cannot otherwise be <lb/>conveniently and economically provided, as well as those that administer the state and the <lb/>economic and social policy of the community. (Public enterprises are included in the business <lb/>enterprise sector).<lb/>• Non public institutes controlled and mainly financed by government, but not administered by the <lb/>higher education sector.<lb/>Private non profit sector: see OECD Frascati Manual 2002, Chapter 3.6. <lb/>The sector is composed of: <lb/>• Non-market, private non-profit institutions serving households (i.e. the general public).<lb/>• Private individuals or households.<lb/>INSTRUMENTS <lb/>Academic instruments are instruments whose main aim is to promote basic research and scientific <lb/>production (for example scientific publications and PhDs). The main allocation criterion is scientific <lb/>reputation, beneficiaries are higher education institutions or academically oriented research institutes <lb/>(usually peer-reviewed). The projects or programmes are primarily investigator-driven and serve an <lb/>academic goal. <lb/>Policy or thematic instruments are instruments oriented towards the solution of political, social or <lb/>economic urgent problems; innovation and economic developments might be an aim, but not so directly as <lb/>the category of innovation instrument. The projects of programmes are primarily policy driven and serve a <lb/>policy goal. <lb/>Innovation instruments are instruments directly oriented towards economic innovation, such as product <lb/>innovation, process innovation, public-private knowledge transfer and the creation of clusters.

METADATA SUMMARY <lb/>Australia <lb/>Data source <lb/>GBAORD. Provisional for the most recent budget year (2009-10), but final for earlier years. No <lb/>other data sources. <lb/>Distinction <lb/>project/ <lb/>institutional <lb/>Based on the stated programme objectives. For institutional funding, the criteria are that the funding <lb/>is provided as a block funding to a unit that has been established as an independent legal entity <lb/>through an Act of Parliament (Federal or State) or established through a formal legal process and the <lb/>entity is free to allocate the funding to different priorities according to its governance procedures. <lb/>This is mostly the case for the publicly funded research agencies and the university sector. The <lb/>exception is where the independent agency, which has been established by an Act of Parliament, is <lb/>charged with distributing the appropriated monies to external parties to support research of limited <lb/>scope and duration e.g. research councils. In this instance, the entire amount is classed as Project. <lb/>For project funding, the criteria are that the scope and duration of the funding are limited, <lb/>irrespective of characteristic of recipient. <lb/>Problems <lb/>No major difficulties in collecting the data <lb/>Main <lb/>independent <lb/>funding <lb/>agencies <lb/>The two main independent funding agencies are the: Australian Research Council and the National <lb/>Health and Medical Research Council <lb/>Problems / <lb/>issues <lb/>There may be other state agencies, but the main ones are listed in the table <lb/>Performers <lb/>by <lb/>institutional <lb/>sector <lb/>Sectoral attribution is by destination or recipient of the funding. The two problems encountered are <lb/>where there are multiple sectors involved or where it is not clear which institutional sector a recipient <lb/>should be assigned to (e.g. legal structure versus function). While some entities may be incorporated <lb/>under the Corporations Act (2001), it may depend on other legal arrangements regarding their <lb/>classification for tax purposes as well as the proportion of private versus public funding. The other <lb/>relevant legislation is the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act (1997). These factors may <lb/>complicate the allocation. Agencies have been asked to prorate the appropriations by institutional <lb/>sector where funding recipients belong to multiple sectors following the recommendations of the <lb/>Frascati Manual as closely as possible. Where agencies are able to identify the percentage <lb/>distributions, these are applied in the distribution. Where the breakdown is not available, roughly <lb/>equal proportions are applied. <lb/>Projects by <lb/>type of <lb/>instruments <lb/>The definition of the instrument types is somewhat difficult to interpret. Funding intentions <lb/>corresponding to the &apos;Academic Instrument&apos; could be more easily identified but distributions <lb/>according to instrument types were based on assumptions i.e. funding intentions had to be translated <lb/>into their equivalents in terms of &apos;instruments&apos;. The test for the &apos;Innovation Instrument&apos; is whether <lb/>the programme objectives satisfy the Oslo Manual definition of innovation. <lb/>Austria <lb/>Data source <lb/>GBAORD. Final for 2000 and 2005, provisional for 2009 (i.e. the latest available year). <lb/>Distinction <lb/>project/ <lb/>institutional <lb/>No distinction is made between the two &quot; funding modes &quot; in Annex T. Many budget items can be <lb/>categorized relatively easily (as they are easily identifiable), some budget items need closer <lb/>investigation by studying further background documents containing more details. <lb/>Problems <lb/>The distinction is for some items difficult without additional background information. National <lb/>research funding agencies are considered as project funding. Data do not necessarily relate to the <lb/>funds these agencies provide yearly (autonomy). <lb/>DSTI/DOC(2012)4 <lb/>37 <lb/>Main <lb/>independent <lb/>funding <lb/>agencies <lb/>For the moment two main independent agencies are identified: &quot; Research Promotion Agency &quot; (FFG) <lb/>which mainly funds business R&amp;D and the &quot; Science Funds &quot; (FWF), which mainly funds R&amp;D in the <lb/>higher education sector. The &quot; Klima-und Energiefonds &quot; plays (up to now) a small role. <lb/>Problems / <lb/>issues <lb/>No major problems (difference between GBAORD outlays and actual outlays of institutions). <lb/>Performers <lb/>by <lb/>institutional <lb/>sector <lb/>Similar problems as the distinction between &quot; institutional funding &quot; and &quot; project funding &quot; occur. For <lb/>many budget items the recipients can be categorised very easily, for others it is difficult. Additional <lb/>information sources are used to estimate the distribution of certain items to the various sectors of <lb/>performance. <lb/>Projects by <lb/>type of <lb/>instruments <lb/>Budgetary items would have to be labelled similarly to the methodology used for Table 1. However, <lb/>there is not enough information available for the various budget items to make an attribution of <lb/>reasonable quality. <lb/>Belgium <lb/>Data source <lb/>GBAORD. The GBAORD data are collected on a yearly basis, at the level of budget items related <lb/>with the decentralised STI competences of the communities, the regions and the federal state <lb/>data are provided for 2008 on the basis of the final budget, except for the data of the Federal <lb/>authority (on the basis of the provisional 2008 budget). Provisional <lb/>Distinction <lb/>project/ <lb/>institutional <lb/>The GBAORD data in Belgium are classified not only according to the NABS classification, but also <lb/>to a functional and institutional destination classification (CFS/STAT-nomenclature) of the budget <lb/>items. This CFS/STAT-nomenclature is helpful in making the distinction between project funding <lb/>and institutional funding. <lb/>Problems <lb/>No significant methodological problems encountered. <lb/>Main <lb/>independent <lb/>funding <lb/>agencies <lb/>Flemish region: <lb/>-Agency for Innovation by Science and Technology (IWT); <lb/>-Research Foundation in Flanders (FWO); <lb/>-Hercules foundation for the funding of research infrastructures <lb/>Brussels region: <lb/>-Innoviris (the Brussels Institute for Research and Innovation); <lb/>-Brussels Enterprise Agency; 3) Research in Brussels <lb/>Walloon region: <lb/>-ASE (Economic Stimulation Agency); <lb/>-AST (Agency for Technology Promotion). <lb/>-FRS-FNRS (Scientific Research Fund) <lb/>Problems / <lb/>issues <lb/>No significant methodological problems encountered. <lb/>Performers <lb/>by <lb/>institutional <lb/>sector <lb/>Problems occur especially when trying to detail project funding. The destination of project funding to <lb/>the different sectors is not always clear because of a combination of different sectors involved. Only <lb/>when a project register should be made, this could solve the problems. So, for the moment a rough <lb/>distinction is made of those budget items with multiple destinations. <lb/>Flemish government: for many funds (about 50 of a total of 175) of the Flemish GBAORD, the <lb/>sectors of performance are only known in the course of the budget year. For the Flemish government, <lb/>the expenditure analysis was consulted to find out which sectors executed the projects. <lb/>Projects by <lb/>type of <lb/>instruments <lb/>A best-guess approach was applied. The difficulty between policy instruments and innovation <lb/>instruments is not always clear. Better definitions seem to be necessary (because of an overlap in the <lb/>definitions). Innovation instruments are in principal not part of GBAORD. ESA and Airbus are <lb/>typical examples of being both innovative instruments and policy or thematic instruments. <lb/>Flemish Government: no major problems encountered, because the existing explanatory notes of the <lb/>different funds give the answer. Although in some cases consultation of the expenditure analysis was <lb/>necessary. <lb/>Canada <lb/>Data source <lb/>GBAORD. Data is for the central government only (information of provincial and municipal <lb/>government is excluded). Canada GBAORD as published by the OECD is also for central <lb/>government only. Final data for 2000 and 2005; Provisional data for 2008 (in particular the GUF for <lb/>2008 is an approximation based on 2007) <lb/></body>

			<body>Distinction <lb/>project/ <lb/>institutional <lb/>Distinction made on different assumptions (based on which department/ministry/agency provided the <lb/>funds and to whom (performers)). <lb/>Project funding comes mainly from six departments or agencies (three research councils provide <lb/>funding to academics on a research project proposal basis; one agency provides infrastructure funds <lb/>to higher education institution on a research project proposal basis; and two departments provides <lb/>R&amp;D funds to business on research project proposal basis). <lb/>Institutional funding comes mainly from government funding in-house R&amp;D and GUF. For <lb/>government funding in-house R&amp;D, it is not possible to get a better breakdown <lb/>Problems <lb/>In Canada, government R&amp;D funding is decentralized. More than 40 different departments/agencies <lb/>are reporting R&amp;D funding. It was not possible to ask each department to provide a list/breakdown of <lb/>project vs. institutional funding. However, assumption was made depending on who (which <lb/>department) provided the funds, and to whom (performer). In general, funding in higher education <lb/>(from research councils) and in business sector is allocated through R&amp;D research project (project-<lb/>based funding). <lb/>For intramural R&amp;D, it was not possible to provide a satisfactory breakdown. All in-house R&amp;D was <lb/>then allocated to institutional funding. <lb/>For other performers (private non profit; other performers) total funding is small and was allocated to <lb/>institutional funding. <lb/>Main <lb/>independent <lb/>funding <lb/>agencies <lb/>There are three main research councils (independent agency providing funds to higher-education <lb/>sector) and one agency providing R&amp;D infrastructure fund to higher-education sector: <lb/>-Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada <lb/>-Canadian Institutes of Health Research <lb/>-Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada <lb/>-Canada Foundation for Innovation (R&amp;D infrastructure fund) <lb/>These four agencies provide around 95% of all government direct funding (excluding GUF) to higher <lb/>education sector, and almost all of that funding is distributed by project-funding. <lb/>Problems / <lb/>issues <lb/>Performers <lb/>by <lb/>institutional <lb/>sector <lb/>The main problem is for in-house government R&amp;D where all funding was allocated to institutional <lb/>funding. There is no central S&amp;T ministry in Canada that would provide R&amp;D funding to different <lb/>ministries. Each ministry is responsible of his own R&amp;D and from a total budget they will decide <lb/>how much to spend in R&amp;D to fulfil their mission. No more information is available. This is why it <lb/>was decided to allocate all the in-house R&amp;D as institutional. <lb/>Projects by <lb/>type of <lb/>instruments <lb/>Project funding to businesses was allocated to innovation.

The Ministry of <lb/>Economic Affairs has allocated budget items to its own agency (NL). <lb/>Performers <lb/>by <lb/>institutional <lb/>sector <lb/>Problems occur especially when trying to detail project funding. The destination of project funding to <lb/>the different sectors is not always clear, because of a combination of different project performers. <lb/>Addressing this issue would require a project register. For the time being a rough allocation is made <lb/>for those budget items with multiple destinations. <lb/>Projects by <lb/>type of <lb/>instruments <lb/>GBAORD does not contain the variable &quot; type of instrument &quot; so a subjective judgement has to be <lb/>made for each budget item.
