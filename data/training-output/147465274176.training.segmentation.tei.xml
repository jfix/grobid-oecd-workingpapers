			<body>ABSTRACT <lb/>Offshoring of business process services (BPS) and information technology services (ITS) – <lb/>whether through international insourcing or international outsourcing – is transforming the way many <lb/>companies do business. This paper looks at the expansion of international supply chains and the rise of <lb/>China, the Czech Republic, India and the Philippines as exporters of BPS and ITS. It also analyses the <lb/>nature of and factors behind this trade and identifies major business-and trade-related challenges arising. <lb/>In this context it presents some of the labour market implications resulting from increasing trade between <lb/>OECD and non-OECD economies. <lb/>The analysis shows that the BPS and ITS sectors in the four emerging economies are very <lb/>differently structured: Chinese and Czech companies are predominantly supplying their domestic markets <lb/>while Indian and Philippine companies are focused mainly on supplying foreign markets. In terms of <lb/>exports, they also supply different geographies: China is mainly exporting to Japan; the Czech Republic to <lb/>the European Union; the Philippines to the United States; and India to the United States and UK. Several of <lb/>the larger home-grown companies in the four countries are establishing significant presence in foreign <lb/>markets, in particular in other emerging markets, to build capacity and leverage local comparative <lb/>advantage. This highlights the fact that different geographies have different strengths and BPS and ITS-<lb/>related FDI between emerging economies is likely to expand rapidly in the future. <lb/>All four countries are facing supply side constraints. The low supply of senior personnel with <lb/>industry-relevant experience in China, the Czech Republic and the Philippines acts as a break on growth. <lb/>Many companies are also struggling to manage high levels of staff attrition and salary inflation. Regulatory <lb/>restrictions are relatively few but still affect some companies. In the ITS sector, temporary movement of <lb/>personnel can pose a significant challenge for home-grown exporters. The issue is most relevant for the <lb/>Indian ITS sector that is dependent on sending professionals for longer visits to client premises. Slow and <lb/>unpredictable procedures for issuing business visas and work permits, and quota limitations for work <lb/>permits, give rise to operational challenges. In the BPS sector, and to a lesser extent in the ITS sector, data <lb/>privacy and security legislation can have a negative effect on international outsourcing. But new <lb/>regulations have also created entirely new business opportunities, including the medical transcription <lb/>sector. <lb/>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS <lb/>This study has been prepared by Michael Engman of the OECD Trade and Agriculture <lb/>Directorate under the supervision of Anthony Kleitz. <lb/>The author wishes to thank all the interviewees that are listed in Appendix B.

			<body>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY <lb/>Business process services (BPS) and information technology services (ITS) are increasingly <lb/>traded between emerging markets and OECD countries. While trade in these services has recently <lb/>expanded significantly, this has been from relatively modest absolute levels. China, the Czech Republic, <lb/>India and the Philippines are leading emerging market exporters in this area. In 2005, their combined <lb/>export revenue was an estimated US$ 8.7 billion for BPS and US$ 14.5 billion for ITS. This represented <lb/>roughly 2-3 percent of worldwide BPS and ITS spending and OECD countries imported the great majority <lb/>of these services. <lb/>As part of OECD&apos;s ongoing work on Globalisation and Structural Adjustment, this paper <lb/>analyses the expansion of international supply chains and the rise of China, the Czech Republic, India and <lb/>the Philippines as exporters of BPS and ITS. It aims to provide a clearer picture of the nature of and factors <lb/>behind new international supply chains in these sectors and identify major business-and trade-related <lb/>challenges arising. In this context it presents some of the labour market implications resulting from <lb/>increasing trade between OECD and non-OECD economies. <lb/>The BPS and ITS sectors in the four countries enjoy access to stable ICT infrastructure and a <lb/>highly educated and language proficient workforce, which allow them to serve foreign markets. They also <lb/>benefit from a set of other enabling factors that facilitate their business. First, the countries have generally <lb/>established zones with dedicated infrastructure and streamlined administration to overcome local <lb/>weaknesses in the business environment. While broader liberalisation for input services and more effective <lb/>business regulations would render such zones unnecessary and benefit the economy as a whole, these <lb/>zones have removed most of the excessive regulatory burden that hold companies back and ensured access <lb/>to necessary input services. <lb/>Second, governments have ensured liberal rules for foreign direct investment (FDI), which has <lb/>allowed foreign multinationals to establish captive units, or joint service centres, to provide BPS and ITS <lb/>services to foreign markets. This has with time generated substantial transfers of technology and <lb/>management practises. Finally, open markets for cross-border supply and few regulatory restrictions in <lb/>client countries have made it possible for companies in emerging markets to deliver BPS and ITS to <lb/>international markets. <lb/>The findings in the country studies show that the BPS and ITS sectors in the four countries are <lb/>very differently structured: while only 10-15 percent of BPS and ITS supply are exported in China and the <lb/>Czech Republic, almost 80 percent of Indian and Philippine BPS and ITS are aimed for foreign markets. <lb/>They also supply different geographies: China is mainly exporting to Japan and the East Asia region; the <lb/>Czech Republic to EU countries; the Philippines to the United States; and India to the United States, UK, <lb/>and to a lesser extent to other OECD markets. This highlights that language proximity is a decisive factor <lb/>in the decision making process of where to source BPS and ITS. <lb/>Trade in BPS and ITS is dominated by OECD-based multinationals but home-grown companies <lb/>in non-OECD economies are rising in prominence. Czech and Philippine BPS and ITS exports are mainly <lb/>provided by foreign multinationals. In China and India, BPS and ITS exports are provided rather more <lb/>equally between home-grown and foreign-owned companies. <lb/>India is leading the way among the emerging markets with a mature and internationally <lb/>competitive ITS sector. The home-grown Indian ITS sector has managed to create a successful business <lb/></body>

			<body>model based on a &apos;global delivery model&apos;, which makes use of a combination of cross-border supply and <lb/>temporary labour migration. Several of the larger home-grown companies in the four countries are <lb/>establishing significant presence in other markets, in particular in other emerging markets, to build <lb/>capacity and leverage local comparative advantage. This highlights the fact that different geographies have <lb/>different strengths and BPS and ITS-related FDI between emerging economies is likely to expand rapidly <lb/>in the future. There are also indications that south-south trade is about to gain in influence in some niche <lb/>markets. <lb/>The market for internationally sourced BPS is young, fast growing and competition is more even <lb/>between the four countries than for ITS. India is the largest supplier but the Philippines has become a <lb/>strong contender for services in English, in particular for voice-based services. All four countries are likely <lb/>to continue to expand their export-oriented BPS sectors in the future. Some trend-setting multinationals <lb/>already use all four countries to deliver BPS to geographies where languages match. <lb/>The four countries face increasing supply side constraints in their quest to provide BPS and ITS <lb/>to international markets. Strong demand has resulted in high attrition rates and salary inflation that some <lb/>companies struggle to manage. In the ITS sector, it also takes significant investment in training to make <lb/>young professionals productive, which makes staff retention key. The availability of senior personnel with <lb/>industry-relevant experience is low in China, the Czech Republic and the Philippines, which acts as a break <lb/>on growth. <lb/>Regulatory restrictions are relatively few but still affect some companies. In the ITS sector, <lb/>temporary movement of personnel can pose a significant challenge for home-grown exporters. The issue is <lb/>most relevant for the Indian ITS sector that is dependent on sending professionals for longer visits to client <lb/>premises. Slow and unpredictable procedures for issuing business visas and work permits, and quota <lb/>limitations for work permits, give rise to operational challenges for Indian companies. <lb/>In the BPS sector, and to a lesser extent in the ITS sector, data privacy and security legislation <lb/>can have a negative effect on international outsourcing. But new regulations have also created entirely new <lb/>business opportunities, including the medical transcription sector. Data privacy and security regulations are <lb/>not necessarily negative as long as they are non-discriminatory in nature. Technological solutions allow <lb/>companies in most instances to comply with the rules and clients generally require their suppliers to live up <lb/>to standards that are higher than existing legislation. <lb/>The integration of large countries, like China and India, in the world economy creates huge <lb/>opportunities for companies in the OECD area to access new markets. It also enables them to access new <lb/>talent to perform tasks in vertically fragmented value chains, including for BPS and ITS. While most work <lb/>tasks cannot be performed in remote places with a business model that is economically compelling and <lb/>delivers adequate service quality, international competition gives rise to job insecurity for some workers <lb/>that used to be cushioned from such pressures. This indicates that trade liberalisation needs to be <lb/>accompanied by sound labour market policies that facilitate reallocation of workers to more productive <lb/>employment and help their citizens reap the gains from trade. <lb/>The ITS sector in high-income countries may face less adjustment pressure than some initially <lb/>feared. The reasons are that international competition is only applied to certain types of services – such as <lb/>application development and maintenance – and the annual growth in worldwide demand for ITS is <lb/>expected to exceed new supply capacity from low-income countries for the foreseeable future. While <lb/>absolute levels of employment is unlikely to drop in the ITS sector, OECD markets may well see a shift in <lb/>the demand for some job occupations within the ITS sector as it recruits more highly skilled workers for <lb/>the supply of higher value services. <lb/></body>

			<body>INTRODUCTION <lb/>1. <lb/>Business process services (BPS) and information technology services (ITS) are increasingly <lb/>traded between emerging markets and OECD countries. While trade in these services has recently <lb/>expanded significantly, this has been from relatively modest absolute levels. Worldwide spending on BPS <lb/>and ITS was approximately US$ 836 billion in 2005 and the great majority of trade takes place between <lb/>OECD countries. 1 Exports from the four countries studied in this paper – China, the Czech Republic, India <lb/>and the Philippines – made up around 2-3 percent of worldwide BPS and ITS spending. These countries <lb/>were all providing the necessary combination of stable ICT infrastructure, liberal rules for foreign direct <lb/>investment (FDI) and a highly educated and language proficient workforce. Yet only in India and the <lb/>Philippines have the BPS and ITS sectors become significant sources of export revenue and job creation. <lb/>India is leading the way with approximately 60 percent of the offshore market for trade in BPS and ITS <lb/>(Citigroup, 2005). <lb/>2. <lb/>International sourcing of BPS and ITS offers significant labour-cost arbitrage and enables <lb/>companies to offer their clients new, cheaper, more flexible, and often higher quality services. It may offer <lb/>reduced time-to-market, facilitate access to foreign markets and create business opportunities to develop <lb/>new products for niche markets. The use of external providers also allows companies to focus on what they <lb/>do best, freeing up capital to be re-invested in R&amp;D and more productive activities. Innovations in business <lb/>practices and low productivity growth have worked as drivers in other instances. But international sourcing <lb/>of BPS and ITS from distant countries is not a viable option for most companies. It takes considerable <lb/>investment and effort for a company to manage the complex undertaking and most services remain non-<lb/>tradable. That said, trade in BPS and ITS will continue to grow in significance as international delivery <lb/>models mature and more countries – on both the demand and supply side – enter the global markets for <lb/>BPS and ITS. <lb/>3. <lb/>This paper is one in a series of OECD studies on Globalisation and Structural Adjustment (GSA). <lb/>The GSA project aims to deepen our understanding of the impact of globalisation in OECD and non-<lb/>OECD economies. It focuses in particular on the overall economic effects of globalisation, the impact of <lb/>globalisation and innovation in the business support service sector, and the links between trade and labour <lb/>market adjustment. 2 As part of the GSA project, this paper looks at the role of major emerging economies <lb/>in providing BPS and ITS to OECD markets. It is first and foremost aimed at trade analysts and policy <lb/>makers but it may just as well be of use for anyone interested in the debate on offshoring – especially since <lb/>the analysis offers plenty of information that is not easily accessible. <lb/>Objectives and scope <lb/>4. <lb/>The objective of the paper is to examine the expansion of international supply chains involving <lb/>BPS and ITS. In particular the analysis will focus on how emerging markets are integrated in the supply <lb/>chains of companies operating in OECD countries. The countries that are studied in the paper have either <lb/>developed competitive BPS/ITS export sectors or have the potential to do so in the future. The aim is to <lb/>provide a clearer picture of the nature of and factors behind new international supply chains in these <lb/>sectors. It also seeks to identify the major business-and trade-related challenges arising. In this context it <lb/>presents some of the implications for labour markets resulting from increasing trade between OECD and <lb/>non-OECD economies. <lb/></body>

			<body>5. <lb/>The scope of the paper is limited to international supply of BPS and ITS, frequently referred to <lb/>as &quot; offshoring &quot; (see Figure 1). Offshoring covers both international insourcing and international <lb/>outsourcing and involves mainly cross-border supply of services (GATS mode 1/2). 3 For ITS, service <lb/>delivery may also be provided through cross-border supply in conjunction with temporary labour migration <lb/>(GATS mode 4). The scope of the study is further narrowed down to focus on the flow of services from <lb/>emerging markets to OECD countries. It should be noted, however, that OECD-based companies are some <lb/>of the largest suppliers of BPS and ITS to emerging markets through commercial presence (GATS mode 3) <lb/>and emerging market suppliers are increasingly establishing subsidiaries in OECD countries to supply <lb/>services locally. 4 <lb/>Figure 1.

A &apos;business process&apos; is an <lb/> &quot; event-driven end-to-end processing path that starts with a customer request and ends with a result for the <lb/>customer &quot; . 5 Consequently, a &apos;business process service&apos; is a service that performs a business process <lb/>activity either in full or in part. Customer interaction services, back office operations, and professional <lb/>services such as human resource, finance and accounting services are examples of business process <lb/>services. &apos;Information technology services&apos; include activities such as IT consulting, system integration, <lb/>custom application development, application maintenance and traditional IT outsourcing and hardware <lb/>support. 6 The number of activities that can be classified as BPS and ITS is continuously growing due to <lb/>technological progress and business innovation. Thus, an exhaustive list using a non-generic methodology <lb/>would quickly become outdated. 7 <lb/>3 There is no agreement among WTO members about whether electronic supply falls under GATS mode 1 or 2, hence <lb/>the terminology modes 1/2 is used <lb/>4 See Table 3 and Annex K. <lb/>5 See Gartner&apos;s glossary: www.gartner.com/6_help/glossary/GlossaryB.jsp <lb/>6 See more in MGI (2005a). <lb/>7 This is one of the main reasons why there is no common definition used in the literature that is linked to registers <lb/>such as the WTO (1991) Services Sectoral Classification list. Annex A presents an indicative list of some of the <lb/>services that are outsourced. <lb/></body>

			<body>Data and methodology <lb/>7. <lb/>International trade statistics fail, to a large extent, to capture trade in BPS and ITS. Several <lb/>reports have concluded that there is a substantial discrepancy between the BPS and ITS trade data captured <lb/>in the IMF Balance of Payment (BOP) system and the data presented by some governments and industry <lb/>associations. In the case of India, the discrepancy between data presented by IMF&apos;s BOP system and the <lb/>Indian National Association of Software and Service Companies (Nasscom) exceeds 90 percent for most <lb/>recent years. 8 <lb/>8. <lb/>Given the challenges related to definitions and availability of comprehensive data, the following <lb/>analysis will make use of data provided by government officials, industry associations and market <lb/>intelligence companies. This type of data is normally based on filed income statements and market surveys. <lb/>Thus it is essential for the reader to keep in mind that some data are best available estimates and may not <lb/>be perfectly comparable across countries. 9 <lb/>9. <lb/>The analysis is also based on information and data obtained from interviews with some 90 senior <lb/>managers, government officials, industry experts and representatives of industry associations in China, the <lb/>Czech Republic, India and the Philippines (Annex B presents a list of the interviewees). The interviews <lb/>were conducted during 1-2 week long missions to the four countries between September 2005 and <lb/>September 2006. Information obtained from the interviews has been backed up with data from the existing <lb/>literature whenever possible. <lb/>10. <lb/>The following paper is centred round country studies of the BPS and ITS sectors in China, the <lb/>Czech Republic, India and the Philippines. Each country study presents market characteristics of the local <lb/>BPS and ITS sectors with focus on trade aspects. They present distinguishing features of each country&apos;s <lb/>BPS and ITS sectors to illustrate how the countries&apos; BPS and ITS sectors are being integrated in <lb/>international supply chains and the extent to which they are successful at targeting export markets. They <lb/>also seek to identify the main business-and trade-related challenges facing companies and governments. <lb/>The country studies are then followed by a section with the main findings and concluding remarks. It <lb/>includes a discussion of some of the implications that workers and governments may face as a result of the <lb/>increasing trade in BPS and ITS between emerging economies and OECD countries. <lb/></body>

			<body>THE CHINESE BPS AND ITS SECTORS <lb/>11. <lb/>The potential attractions of China as a provider of BPS and ITS to OECD-based clients are many. <lb/>The Chinese economy has grown rapidly for many years and the domestic markets for BPS and ITS are <lb/>boosted by the large and growing number of Chinese and foreign-owned multinationals that operate in <lb/>China. There is abundant supply of university graduates, including software engineers, many of which are <lb/>highly qualified and motivated. Labour costs are particularly low for junior-level professionals and it <lb/>makes China an economically compelling location for provision of BPS and ITS. Geographic proximity <lb/>and linguistic capabilities are attributes useful in serving clients in Japan, Korea, Chinese Taipei, Singapore <lb/>and Hong Kong. In addition, the business environment is conducive in Chinese technology and software <lb/>parks that provide streamlined administration, quality infrastructure and incentive packages to prospective <lb/>new exporters. Yet given all these merits, China still remains a small player on the international market for <lb/>other services than high-end R&amp;D services and lower end BPS services. <lb/>12. <lb/>A.T. Kearney&apos;s Global Services Location Index ranks China as the second most attractive <lb/>geography for providing BPS and ITS (see Annex H). Labour is inexpensive and infrastructure costs low <lb/>but taxes and regulatory costs are higher in China than in India and the Philippines. While China has a <lb/>particularly large labour force in absolute terms, people with relevant experience and foreign language <lb/>skills make it less suited to provide services to markets outside East Asia. And although China is regarded <lb/>as having a relatively low country risk and decent infrastructure, it scores poorly for cultural adaptability <lb/>and security of intellectual property. neoIT&apos;s ranking of emerging markets places China as the third most <lb/>attractive offshore location for ITS but only ninth most attractive location for BPS (see Annex F-G). China <lb/>has a slight advantage compared to India in terms of costs but it significantly lags its neighbour in terms of <lb/>maturity of local BPS and ITS companies and in the availability of suitable manpower. <lb/>Market characteristics <lb/>13. <lb/>The BPS and ITS sectors in China are predominantly serving the domestic market. In 2000, the <lb/>export share of total supply was 6 percent according to Tschang and Xue (2003). By 2006, this share was <lb/>estimated to have increased to 10-15 percent. 10 Exports are equally generated by Chinese-owned <lb/>companies and subsidiaries of foreign multinationals. However, foreign multinationals obtain more of the <lb/>large private services contracts than their Chinese counterparts (IDC, 2006a) 11 . <lb/>14. <lb/>While there is a scarcity of reliable BPS/ITS trade data in general, the Chinese market is <lb/>particularly challenging to analyse due to the relative lack of transparency and availability of disaggregated <lb/>data. Very few Chinese BPS or ITS companies are publicly listed. The following set of estimates provides <lb/>an overview of those that are frequently presented: <lb/></body>

			<note place="footnote">10 For example Walter Fang from Neusoft Group estimates that 85 percent of services revenue stems from the <lb/>domestic market while de Filippo et al. (2005) put the number at 90 percent. <lb/>11 The two largest ITS companies in China are the Chinese subsidiaries of IBM and Hewlett-Packard according to <lb/>Analysys International. <lb/></note>

According to the Chinese Ministry of Information Industry, software exports in 2005 totalled <lb/>US$3.59 billion, up from US$ 2.80 billion in 2004 (MII, 2006). <lb/>! Government officials in the Ministry of Commerce put the export value of IT and IT-enabled <lb/>services at US$ 3.6 billion in 2005 and US$ 960 million were related to exports of software <lb/>programmes and applications. 12 <lb/>! According to IDC (2006a), exports of software development services reached US$ 933 million in <lb/>2005, up from US$ 600 million in 2004 and US$ 400 million in 2003. 13 <lb/>! A.T. Kearney (2004) estimates that US$ 320 million worth of BPS would be internationally <lb/>sourced from China in 2005, up from US$ 260 million in 2004. <lb/>15. <lb/>Exports of BPS and ITS are mainly delivered to companies operating in China&apos;s eastern <lb/>neighbours: the Asia-Pacific region imported more than three-fourths of these services in 2005. Japan <lb/>captures roughly two-thirds of exports and a significant part of this business is generated by branches of <lb/>OECD-based companies operating in Japan. European and North American markets represent around one-<lb/>fifth of Chinese exports. More specifically, Japanese companies are large consumers of software <lb/>application and maintenance services while European and North American companies are major clients for <lb/>testing services (IDC, 2006a). <lb/>16. <lb/>Notwithstanding the publicised, forthcoming rivalry between China and India as offshore <lb/>services suppliers, the former country has yet to develop into a major base for international sourcing of <lb/>BPS and ITS. There are indications that China is becoming the destination of choice for the supply of <lb/>certain BPS and ITS to companies operating in Japan and Korea. However, this is not the case for <lb/>European and North American companies and many analysts believe this is unlikely to happen in the <lb/>foreseeable future. <lb/>17. <lb/>Nevertheless, China may excel in foreign niche markets, some of which may generate sizeable <lb/>export revenue. It is currently a capable destination at the two ends of the services value chain: low-level <lb/>data processing and testing work and high-level R&amp;D. In the R&amp;D area, China is already one of the main <lb/>centres in the world but there is rather limited R&amp;D investment in the Chinese BPS and ITS sectors. In <lb/>between the low-end and high-end of the value chain, China has yet to realise its potential as a supplier to <lb/>foreign markets despite the nascent industry&apos;s ambition and the Chinese government&apos;s explicit goal to <lb/>develop a competitive domestic software industry. <lb/>18. <lb/>There is great potential for a strengthened Sino-Japanese trade relation in the BPS and ITS area. <lb/>For example, the five top Chinese BPS and ITS companies presented in Annex K are mainly focusing their <lb/>activities to serve the Japanese market. The geographic proximity, Japanese language proficiency and <lb/>demographic and economic forces are compelling and indicate that this relation is likely to develop further <lb/>if the political and business environments remain stable. Increased investment in Japanese language <lb/>capabilities would in particular increase business opportunities for Chinese BPS companies. <lb/></body>

			<body>Fragmentation and ownership <lb/>19. <lb/>While the future potential for China to become an offshore centre of choice is great, the current <lb/>capabilities of the domestic industry and the market structure leave plenty of room for improvement. The <lb/>BPS and ITS markets are highly fragmented with more than 13,000 SMEs employing some 900,000 <lb/>professionals vying for business. 14 No home-grown company has a market share over 3 percent and few <lb/>companies are export-oriented – the competition is cutthroat. There are many reasons why the BPS and <lb/>ITS markets are fragmented. <lb/>20. <lb/>First, they are still in their infancy and foreign participation has only started to pick up over the <lb/>last few years. Second, with low entry barriers, the markets are full of small and immature companies that <lb/>tend to compete on price rather than quality; act opportunistically without attention to developing domain <lb/>expertise; and not invest adequately in training and process controls. As a result, operating margins are low <lb/>by international standards (7 percent according to de Filippo (2005)). China is also mainly exporting fairly <lb/>low-value services related to data entry, modular software programming and testing and maintenance <lb/>services. <lb/>21. <lb/>Third, China is a large country with different IT champions in different provinces and regions. <lb/>Local governments have significant equity holdings in local BPS and ITS companies and tend to favour <lb/>these to external competitors. Market consolidation is also held back by local governments that are <lb/>unwilling to lose control of the companies. This has slowed down the development of companies with <lb/>country-wide presence. Estimates of the share of public ownership of the BPS and ITS sectors vary: <lb/>Tschang and Xue (2003) have estimated the share of public ownership at about 30 percent, with another 10 <lb/>percent having mixed public-private owners, and Gartner puts the public ownership share at 70 percent <lb/>(Ilett, 2006). Saxenian (2003) argues that 30 percent of the software companies in China are state-owned, <lb/>27 percent are Sino-foreign joint ventures, 20 percent are collectively owned (university spin-offs), 17 <lb/>percent are private and 6 percent are foreign-owned. <lb/>22. <lb/>Many ITS companies founded in the 1980s-1990s were established by university faculty and <lb/>universities were often awarded a share of corporate equity. For other Chinese entrepreneurs, a mixed <lb/>public-private ownership structure was simply necessary to setup and run a company: official assistance <lb/>(through guanxi 15 ) is often essential in China to gain access to licenses, permits, financial resources and <lb/>facilities. Public ownership also brings protection and favourable interpretation of regulations and <lb/>enforcement of contracts. Another key benefit of a public-sector link is the perceived advantage in the <lb/>competition for contracts from public institutions and state-owned enterprises. (Saxenian, 2003). The <lb/>supply of software programming and IT services to sensitive industries such as defence and aerospace is <lb/>predominantly provided by publicly controlled companies. <lb/>23. <lb/>The fragmented markets for BPS and ITS have several disadvantages: without adequate scale it is <lb/>difficult to attract multinational clients, which make up much of the market for internationally sourced BPS <lb/>and ITS. The main reasons are that small service providers are less reliable due to their dependency on key <lb/>personnel and limited financial resources. Technical capabilities and flexibility are also negatively affected <lb/>due to their lack of capacity or breadth to absorb large projects and offer domain expertise. In addition, it <lb/>14 According to the Chinese Ministry of Information Industry (MII), there were 13,194 registered software companies <lb/>by the end of 2005 (AI, 2006a). MOFCOM provided the number of professionals in the industry. <lb/></body>

			<note place="footnote">15 Guanxi is a central concept in Chinese society and describes, in part, a personal connection between two people in <lb/>which one is able to prevail upon another to perform a favor or service, or be prevailed upon.

			<body>negatively affects companies&apos; ability to develop mature and efficient procedures for process and quality <lb/>controls. <lb/>24. <lb/>Several of the export-oriented Chinese BPS and ITS companies are start-ups by former <lb/>employees of OECD-based multinationals. Many senior Chinese executives have also been recruited from <lb/>abroad to the domestic industry. This situation is similar to the one in India, where many of the leading <lb/>services companies were established by former employees of U.S. and British multinationals. The main <lb/>difference, however, is that most of the successful Indian services companies were established in the late <lb/>1980s and early 1990s while many of China&apos;s fast growing services companies were established in the late <lb/>1990s and early 2000s. The Indian industry is thus enjoying a significant head start and the Chinese <lb/>industry is trying to catch up the best it can. 16 <lb/>25. <lb/>Some of the fastest growing export-oriented Chinese ITS companies are today privately owned. <lb/>Given the competitive pressures and low-margin work at the Chinese market, more and more companies <lb/>are trying to establish business models that are effective in serving foreign markets. Entry barriers to serve <lb/>OECD markets are significantly higher than for domestic supply but those companies that succeed – and <lb/>there is a small number of Chinese BPS and ITS companies that have more than US$ 10 million in export <lb/>revenue from OECD market (see Annex K) – operate in markets where there are fewer competitors and <lb/>more profitable business opportunities. <lb/>The role of the Chinese government in attracting foreign investment <lb/>26. <lb/>The Chinese government supports the local BPS and ITS sectors and tries to entice foreign <lb/>companies with tax and tariff incentives, subsidies and administrative convenience in its dedicated high-<lb/>tech parks. The Chinese government also actively encourages partnerships and joint ventures with foreign <lb/>companies to assist in the development of Chinese ITS companies. The Chinese government is not only the <lb/>regulator but also the largest client of BPS and ITS in China and the largest owner of local companies. This <lb/>makes the Chinese BPS and ITS sectors stand out in a comparison with those in the Czech Republic, India <lb/>and the Philippines where public ownership is almost non-existent and public procurement as a share of <lb/>total demand is relatively low. <lb/>27. <lb/>The Chinese government regards the software industry to be essential to economic progress and <lb/>national security. The key government policy for the software industry was announced in June 2000 and <lb/>published in State Council Document 18, also known as the &quot; Notice of Certain Policies to Promote the <lb/>Software and Integrated Circuit Industry Development &quot; , and later followed up by State Council Document <lb/>47 in 2002. The policy document established preferential policies to promote the development of these two <lb/>sectors and the policies for software companies include: 17 <lb/>! Value-added tax refunds for R&amp;D and expanded production; <lb/>! Tax preferences for newly established companies; <lb/>! Fast-track approval of software companies seeking to raise capital on overseas stock markets; <lb/>! Exemption from tariffs and VAT for all imports of technology and equipment; <lb/>! Direct export rights for all software firms with more than US$ 1 million in revenue; <lb/>! Right to set salary levels and to grant bonuses to investors <lb/>16 Computerworld argued in 2003 that the Chinese ITS sector was 12 years behind the Indian one. The Economist put <lb/>it at 5-10 years in 2006. <lb/>17 See www.csia.org.cn/chinese_en/index/No18Document.html for the text and Saxenian (2003). <lb/></body>

			<body>28. <lb/>In addition to the above-mentioned incentives, State Council Document 18 also provided for a <lb/>new layout of the software sector, which included a plan to fund and promote selected companies for the <lb/>creation of national champions (the Chinese government has subsequently selected around 160 national <lb/>companies). It also established a Committee covering 15 Ministries to establish an effective legal <lb/>framework to protect patents, trademarks and copyrights; and to ensure enforcement of this legal <lb/>framework. Another pillar of the strategic document covers government incentives for the development of <lb/>human resources (more on this below). <lb/>29. <lb/>Documents 18 and 47 were followed by an initiative by the Torch Centre – a division under the <lb/>Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST) – in November 2003 and referred to as the China Offshore <lb/>Software Engineering Project (COSEP). COSEP&apos;s goal is to provide services from China to overseas <lb/>corporate clients. The Torch Center annually selects qualified software companies from regional software <lb/>parks to participate in COSEP and the companies are trained under supervision of ExperExchange – an <lb/>American BPS and ITS company – to obtain a quality certification (ChinaTechNews, 2003). This project <lb/>was launched with the help of ExperExchange and it has provided some of the impetus behind the <lb/>expansion of outsourcing activities, in particular those targeting Europe and North America (Simon, 2005). <lb/>30. <lb/>Although the central and local governments provide the BPS and ITS industry with significant <lb/>support, there are two areas where the industry would like to see further improvement to enhance the <lb/>business environment and its international visibility. First, the Chinese BPS and ITS sectors lack an <lb/>effective industry association to provide best practise indicators for benchmarking, comprehensive industry <lb/>data, and promote them abroad to potential investors. This is a disadvantage vis-à-vis other emerging <lb/>market competitors. As Nasscom in India, BPA/P in the Philippines and the Czech ICT Alliance, such an <lb/>industry association could also aid the Chinese government in formulating common priorities for the policy <lb/>environment. The China Software Industry Association (CSIA) is currently the nation-wide industry <lb/>association but it focuses mainly on the domestic market for software and related services. Its activities are <lb/>restricted by its limited mandate provided by the Chinese government. CSIA is perceived to be first and <lb/>foremost accountable to the government rather than to the industry itself. <lb/>31. <lb/>Second, there are currently ten government ministries with different responsibilities to address <lb/>specific issues and challenges faced by the BPS and ITS sectors. The National Development and Reform <lb/>Commission (NDRC) defines the overarching policies for ministries, the Ministry of Information industry <lb/>(MII) focuses on industry policy, the Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM) promotes trade, the Ministry of <lb/>Science and Technology (MOST) provide guidelines for R&amp;D strategy, etc. Many local observers argue <lb/>that the Chinese government could be more effective and facilitate the situation by introducing a more <lb/>coherent long-term policy without conflicts of interest with regard to the responsibility of different <lb/>government ministries. <lb/></body>

			<body>Box 1. Dalian Software Park <lb/>The Dalian Software Park (DLSP), established in 1999, is one of the fastest growing software parks in East Asia <lb/>and a major gateway for Chinese exports of IT and IT-enabled services to Japan and Korea. It is also one of six <lb/> &quot; national software export bases &quot; approved by the Chinese Government to export services. Due to Dalian&apos;s <lb/>geographical proximity and historical links to neighbouring Japan and Korea, the region has a substantial Japanese <lb/>and Korean speaking population, which can be employed to supply voice-based and non-voice-based business <lb/>process services. It also hosts many universities and research institutes that provide plenty of graduates that form <lb/>the backbone in the outsourcing sector. <lb/>Exports have grown rapidly: after the first establishments of mostly domestic companies, Panasonic setup <lb/>operations in 2001 as the first Japanese multinational and GE Capital International Services arrived the following <lb/>year. In September 2006, 340 companies employed approximately 30,000 professionals in the DLSP and roughly <lb/>40 percent of the companies were foreign-owned. Half of the companies supply BPS and ITS services to foreign <lb/>clients mainly in East Asia and Japan captures some 80 percent of exports. Revenue is to a large extent made up of <lb/>software application development (40 percent) and business process services (30 percent). Engineering services, <lb/>embedded software and R&amp;D make up much the rest. A joint venture between DLSP and a Singaporean company <lb/>is currently investing to develop the park by adding 9 km² to the current 3 km², which will make it the largest <lb/>software park in China. This project is to form an industrial arrangement enclosing a Software Development Zone, <lb/>a Research &amp; Development Zone, an Information Service Zone, an Education &amp; Training Zone, and a Corporate <lb/>Campus Zone, plus adjacent public services and housing. <lb/>DLSP offers companies a set of preferential policies. Foreign companies that operate in the DLSP can enjoy <lb/>preferential tax treatment during five years from the year the company starts making a profit: the taxes of the first 2 <lb/>years are exempted and taxes for the following 3 years are reduced by 50 percent. Moreover, as long as exports <lb/>make up at least 70 percent of total production value, income tax is reduced from 33 percent to 10 percent and the <lb/>maximum VAT from 17 percent to 0-3 percent. For software products, VAT and export tax are exempted. For <lb/>technology exports, the sales tax and income tax are exempted. Companies that export software products for more <lb/>than US$ 1 million can conduct trade operations without having to make use of a third party export/import agent. <lb/>Furthermore, import tax and VAT are exempted for imported equipment used by software companies and for <lb/>technology, including software, and the parts and spare parts imported together with the equipment (with some <lb/>exceptions). <lb/>Companies that employ graduates with Bachelor degrees or higher qualifications are further allowed to register <lb/>their employees as permanent residents, who are exempted from paying the city environmental fee. The same goes <lb/>for overseas Chinese that come and work in the DLSP. They receive long-term temporary residential cards and <lb/>their children enjoy similar rights as locals for school and kindergarten services. Annual &quot; special funds &quot; are <lb/>provided from state departments, the province and the city to DLSP-based companies in addition to support from <lb/>risk capital companies. Companies and employees also enjoy preferential treatment in buying or renting office <lb/>buildings in the park. <lb/>Source: OECD (2006), www.dlsp.com.cn and discussions with representatives from the DLSP. <lb/>Challenges to China&apos;s BPS and ITS sectors in supplying international markets <lb/>32. <lb/>Chinese-owned and foreign-owned companies that supply BPS and ITS from China face a <lb/>number of challenges. Most challenges in the BPS and ITS sectors are related to supply side constraints. <lb/>The biggest challenge is to recruit and retain talent, in particular middle and senior managers of the calibre <lb/>needed to serve foreign markets. Another type of challenge relates to maintaining operational efficiency – <lb/>including systems for formal procedures, processes and quality control – and this paper only touches on <lb/>some of the China-specific issues that companies face. Regulatory constraints affecting trade are relatively <lb/>few and the sectors benefit from a rather open business environment. This is partly due to business models <lb/>based on cross-border supply and openness to foreign direct investment. The following section looks at <lb/>challenges that are repeatedly highlighted by corporate executives in China: <lb/></body>

			<note place="headnote">TD/TC/WP(2007)2/FINAL <lb/></note>

			<page>16 <lb/></page>

			<body>Supply-side constraints <lb/>Recruitment and retention <lb/>33. <lb/>The BPS and ITS sectors are highly labour, not capital, intensive and human capital is each <lb/>company&apos;s key asset. Although China produces a large number of university graduates every year, <lb/>recruitment is for most Chinese-based service companies the single largest challenge. The sheer size of the <lb/>talent pool is often presented as a main strength but identifying, hiring, training, retraining and retaining <lb/>talent are real challenges for companies. Most graduates and engineers are unsuited to work in an export-<lb/>oriented sector where effective communication and client interaction in many instances are essential. The <lb/>competition to lure the best software engineers (for the ITS sector) and other university graduates with <lb/>technical and business training (for the BPS sector) is tough. Foreign multinationals have an advantage <lb/>since they can afford to pay a wage premium for top talent; they may have an attractive brand name and <lb/>offer opportunities to work abroad and with new technology in exciting projects. Domestic companies <lb/>generally pay less but offer a somewhat different value proposition to its employees. <lb/>34. <lb/>At the junior level, recruitment is not yet a major issue in China even if it takes considerable <lb/>investment in training before new employees become productive. At a more senior level, for project <lb/>managers and middle managers, the situation is different. The relative infancy of the Chinese BPS and ITS <lb/>sectors makes it naturally difficult to find management talent with mission critical experience and <lb/>expertise. The situation is not aided by the structural gap left from the Cultural Revolution, which <lb/>drastically reduced the education level of a generation of Chinese. <lb/>35. <lb/>The scarcity of middle and top level talent has effectively put a brake on growth and led to rapid <lb/>salary inflation for these professionals (the salary increases are much more modest for junior level <lb/>professionals). Some Chinese companies try to tackle the situation by recruiting managers from abroad, in <lb/>particular from the sizeable Chinese Diaspora. According to DeWoskin (2005), some 60 million Chinese <lb/>live outside China and make up a large source of capital and technology and provide crucial business <lb/>networks. <lb/>36. <lb/>Several policy programmes have been implemented by the Chinese government to provide <lb/>incentives for Chinese scholars based abroad to move to China. For example State Council Document 18 <lb/>established a fund, managed jointly by the State Bureau of Foreign Experts and Ministry of Education, to <lb/>send software developers overseas for training. A.T. Kearney (2004) refers to survey results by Hewitt and <lb/>Associates showing that two-thirds of companies employ numerous Chinese expatriates and roughly half <lb/>of director-level positions and above are filled by Chinese expatriates. The lack of middle and senior <lb/>managers also force many companies to nurture their young talent and fast-track them into management <lb/>positions. <lb/>37. <lb/>Labour attrition is another challenge. 18 With only six export-oriented services centres, <lb/>competition is especially hard as more and more companies move to the same locations and vie for talent. <lb/>In the BPS sector, attrition rates are high – especially for voice-based services – but even at 30 percent, <lb/>levels are lower than in India and the Philippines, and significantly lower than in many OECD countries. <lb/>The ITS sector also suffers from attrition but it is generally lower than in the BPS field. To tackle this <lb/>situation companies increasingly focus their attention to enhance core HR policies, e.g. by designing clear <lb/>career paths, investing in education and training, and creating more pleasant work environments. Many <lb/>companies also move delivery centres to smaller towns outside traditional technology and software centres <lb/>where wages are lower and opportunities for staff to jump to neighbouring competitors are fewer. More <lb/></body>

			<note place="footnote">18 High attrition rates coupled with the strong need for investment in training creates a catch 22 situation where the <lb/>incentives for investment in training are lower the less an employee is likely to stay. <lb/></note>

			<body>and more companies are also providing performance related bonuses and relaxation of ownership rules will <lb/>allow more companies to offer equity to key personnel. <lb/>Box 2. Chinese vs. Indian labour supply <lb/>Leading educational indicators show that China is quite well placed to provide ample talent for its service industry. <lb/>According to Deloitte Research (2006), there is more than twice as many Chinese 18-23 years-olds (15 percent of <lb/>total) than Indians (7 percent) enrolled in higher education. Chinese secondary schools host almost half the number <lb/>of pupils per teacher (18 pupils/teacher) than Indian secondary schools (34 pupils/teacher). China also spends more <lb/>resources on R&amp;D and has many more computer and internet users (see Annex J). <lb/>For the supply of BPS and ITS in English, India has a strong advantage over China. Many Indians are bilingual (or <lb/>trilingual) with English as a mother tongue while the great majority of Chinese have limited exposure to the <lb/>English language. However, in a generation&apos;s time, this difference will become less pronounced since the Chinese <lb/>government has decreed that all Chinese children must study English from the age of five. <lb/>Language proficiency and international business acumen <lb/>38. <lb/>The supply of BPS and ITS often involves intensive interaction and communication with <lb/>corporate clients. BPS are also often provided through real-time communication. The ability of service <lb/>professionals to properly identify the task, solve the problem, and communicate the solution is thus related <lb/>to his/her communication skills, technical capabilities and business acumen. Chinese professionals have a <lb/>natural advantage to foreigners when serving their domestic market. However, Chinese professionals face a <lb/>serious challenge when it comes to serving foreign clients and customers. Most Chinese professionals have <lb/>limited exposure to foreigners and foreign business environments. BPS and ITS companies seek to address <lb/>these gaps by investing in soft skills like language proficiency, communication skills and cultural <lb/>awareness. <lb/>39. <lb/>China has a sizable population of Japanese and Korean speakers in its North-Eastern provinces. <lb/>A growing number of foreign multinationals are supplying voice-based support services in Japanese and <lb/>Korean to customers and clients in China&apos;s eastern neighbours (see Box 3). The language proficiency and <lb/>cultural affinity to these countries aid the process of supplying non-voice based business process services <lb/>and IT services. China is today the main, although nascent, offshore destination for cross-border delivery <lb/>of BPS and ITS to Japan and Korea. <lb/>40. <lb/>The language barrier is arguably the main reason why China has yet to develop into an offshore <lb/>location of choice for the supply of BPS and ITS services to companies in Europe and North America. An <lb/>exception is certain high-level software programming and R&amp;D-related activities for which China&apos;s <lb/>abundance of scientists and knowledge workers are particularly well suited. The situation is different for <lb/>Indo-European language skills. While China&apos;s current generation of pupils learn English at elementary <lb/>school, students that graduate from university today have, at best, limited knowledge of spoken English. <lb/>Those that do learn English have few opportunities to practise their skills. Even at international master <lb/>degree programmes at some of China&apos;s best universities, students can read in English but writing and <lb/>verbal communication skills remain low. <lb/>41. <lb/>But this is starting to change, and will continue to change, as more English-speaking students will <lb/>graduate in the future and more Chinese students return with degrees and language skills from overseas. To <lb/>serve foreign markets, companies will not only need to find talent with language skills but also invest <lb/>heavily in training to enhance workers&apos; understanding of language nuances and the importance of tone in <lb/>customer interaction. This is particularly important for sales and marketing activities abroad. <lb/></body>

			<body>Regulatory challenges <lb/>42. <lb/>The regulatory challenges are related both to the domestic business environment and to the <lb/>regulatory environment in client countries. In the major client countries Japan, Korea and the United <lb/>States, there are currently few regulatory concerns for Chinese-based BPS and ITS companies. The <lb/>Chinese ITS companies that deliver services with the help of a global delivery model that is partly <lb/>dependent on temporary movement of professionals between home office and client office face the same <lb/>type of restrictions that Indian companies face in Europe and North America (see Indian chapter for an <lb/>extensive discussion). 19 These restrictions relate to the relatively unpredictable and time-consuming <lb/>administration of business visas and work permits, which increase complexity and business risk. <lb/>43. <lb/>So far, few Chinese companies send professionals to their client countries and the issue, while <lb/>real, is thus limited to the companies that employ a global delivery model with a significant onsite <lb/>component. And Chinese professionals do not face this type of challenge in their relation with Japan and <lb/>Korea, which also capture most of Chinese services exports. Foreign multinationals operating in China can <lb/>move employees on intra-corporate work permits which are easier to obtain and involve less discretion. <lb/>44. <lb/>The view of OECD-based companies with regard to regulatory challenges in China is rather <lb/>positive too, not least because the software and technology parks that host almost all foreign-owned <lb/>companies provide a unique trade environment with streamlined administration, high standards of <lb/>infrastructure and financial incentives. These software and technology parks are a relief since it is a rather <lb/>time consuming and tedious process to establish a subsidiary in China and there are some other issues as <lb/>well (see Annex C). <lb/>Box 3. Indian companies are increasingly investing in China <lb/>After much contemplation and evaluation, the Indian BPS and ITS sectors have decided to approach China as a <lb/>business opportunity rather than a competitive threat. Leading Indian companies Satyam Computer Systems, TCS <lb/>and Infosys Technologies all established branch offices in China in 2002-03. These companies employed some <lb/>400-600 Chinese professionals in their development centres in China during the fall of 2006. However, towards the <lb/>end of the decade, the companies expect to have increased their Chinese headcount tenfold. Much of the workforce <lb/>will be used to serve clients in neighbouring Japan and Korea. <lb/>China can be leveraged by foreign/Indian companies in three main ways. First, some companies are targeting the <lb/>rapidly growing domestic market with local and foreign-owned multinationals. Some 80 percent of Fortune 500 <lb/>companies have operations in China. Competition is high but new niche markets such as engineering services are <lb/>providing new growth opportunities. China&apos;s accession to the WTO and the liberalisation of the banking sector will <lb/>put pressure on domestic banks to increase productivity and this is expected to increase the market for domestically <lb/>sourced BPS and ITS. Second, China is the natural offshore base, or &quot; nearshore &quot; bridge, to serve clients in Japan, <lb/>Korea and the Asia Pacific. Third, with time, companies will build up capabilities to use their Chinese branches to <lb/>serve clients also outside North-East Asia. <lb/>Source: OutsourcingWorld and Vandrevala (2006) <lb/></body>

			<body>45. <lb/>The Chinese court system is considered to be unpredictable and recourse to legal means <lb/>expensive. Most contracts are signed directly in the client country so that potential disagreements can be <lb/>settled according to the jurisprudence in the client country. Foreign companies normally hire consulting <lb/>companies to establish their subsidiaries since this process can take considerable time and involve dealings <lb/>with many public agencies. <lb/>46. <lb/>According to China&apos;s Schedule of Specific Commitments related to GATS, for &quot; computer and <lb/>related services &quot; , China has no limitation on market access or national treatment for mode 1-3 supply of <lb/> &quot; consultancy services related to the installation of computer hardware &quot; , &quot; data processing services &quot; , &quot; input <lb/>preparation services &quot; , &quot; data processing and tabulation services &quot; , &quot; time sharing services &quot; and &quot; management <lb/>consulting services &quot; . Limitations to mode 4 are related to education and work experience levels. For <lb/> &quot; software implementation services &quot; , &quot; systems and software consulting &quot; , &quot; systems analysis services &quot; , <lb/> &quot; systems design services &quot; , &quot; programming services &quot; and &quot; systems maintenance services &quot; , market access is <lb/>only allowed in the form of joint ventures (with foreign majority ownership permitted) (WTO, 2002). <lb/>Foreign industry has previously called for these limitations to be removed (USITO, 2003). <lb/>47. <lb/>However, unlike in many other services sectors (e.g. telecommunications) in China, the BPS and <lb/>ITS companies consulted in this study did not consider ownership regulations to restrict their activities. <lb/>Ownership plays much more of a crucial role in government procurement: foreign-owned companies find <lb/>themselves at a disadvantage in the bidding process with government agencies and state-owned enterprises. <lb/>Yet a similar situation holds for the other countries studied in this paper and Chinese–owned companies <lb/>find themselves at a disadvantage when bidding for contracts overseas. <lb/>48. <lb/>There are significant concerns about Intellectual Property Right (IPR) violations in China, <lb/>including patent, trademark and copyright violations. Pirated versions of enterprise and consumer software <lb/>are readily available at the black market. However, IP violations do not necessarily affect the BPS and ITS <lb/>sectors and companies dealing with IPR take a fairly pragmatic approach to tackle the issue in China. Most <lb/>software applications and even software solutions, when tailor-made for corporate clients, are difficult to <lb/>pirate. IPR is in most instances not relevant to services provision in the sectors studied here. The view of <lb/>industry experts is that the legal framework in China to a great extent is developed on this issue but <lb/>enforcement is not necessarily as strong as it could be. <lb/>49. <lb/>Foreign investors are somewhat less concerned following China&apos;s accession to the WTO, which <lb/>protects them under the Agreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) 20 . <lb/>State Council Document 18 also provides stiff penalties for piracy. The Chinese government has increased <lb/>its effort in cracking down on IP violations in parallel with its own campaign to help foster domestic <lb/>innovation – which itself is highly dependent on proper enforcement of IPR. Tackling IP concerns to some <lb/>extent hinges on the business model that a foreign company adopts in China. The captive unit, joint venture <lb/>and use of external provider have difference merits with regard to control and security (see more in A.T. <lb/>Kearney, 2004). <lb/>50. <lb/>One type of regulation that is particularly relevant in the BPS sector relates to data privacy and <lb/>security. Few regulations act as barriers to trade and clients require the highest standards for data security <lb/>and privacy to outsource fragments – or activities – of their value chains. Companies invest in <lb/>infrastructure and the business processes required to work according to these standards in order to compete <lb/>for business. Regulations may raise the entry barriers to suppliers but are generally applied in a non-<lb/>discriminatory manner (see Indian chapter for more on this issue). <lb/></body>

			<body>THE CZECH BPS AND ITS SECTORS <lb/>51. <lb/>The Czech Republic is regarded as one of the most attractive locations in Central and Eastern <lb/>Europe for international supply of BPS and ITS. It is also one of the more attractive locations worldwide. <lb/>The country has several merits as a base for the supply of BPS and ITS within Europe. Among the chief <lb/>advantages are the country&apos;s geographic and cultural proximity to large markets in Western Europe, its <lb/>well educated, language proficient and cost effective workforce, its traditionally strong domestic <lb/>engineering industry and well developed infrastructure. Foreign services companies also serve the growing <lb/>domestic market and foreign expatriates like Prague for its high quality of life. Since May 2004, the Czech <lb/>Republic is a member of the EU, which facilitates movement of service personnel within the internal <lb/>market, ensures harmonisation of domestic laws and regulations with those in other EU countries – <lb/>including for data privacy and security – and provides unlimited access to the European market. <lb/>52. <lb/>A.T. Kearney&apos;s Global Services Location Index ranks the Czech Republic as the 7 th most <lb/>attractive geography for providing BPS and ITS (see Annex H). The country scores particularly highly for <lb/>its business environment, with low country risk, well developed infrastructure and high cultural <lb/>adaptability. It also does well in international comparisons of quality of education, language proficiency <lb/>and staff attrition. The main weaknesses relate to the limited size of the young and technically trained <lb/>workforce and the domestic industry&apos;s lack of experience of delivering BPS and ITS services abroad. <lb/>Additionally, the labour cost structure is significantly higher than in many other emerging markets with <lb/>comparable capabilities. Czech salaries in the BPS and ITS fields are 100-150 percent higher than in China <lb/>and India, and 60-100 percent higher than in the Philippines (see Annex D). Labour cost is not the decisive <lb/>factor for foreign investors in the Czech Republic. <lb/>53. <lb/>EIU (2005) ranks the Czech Republic as Europe&apos;s most attractive &quot; offshoring environment &quot; and <lb/>third among emerging markets after India and China. 21 The attractiveness stems from its relatively low <lb/>labour costs, favourable regulatory environment and proximity – both culturally and historically – to <lb/>Western European markets. The country&apos;s well-educated workforce distinguishes it from closely ranked <lb/>Poland and Slovakia. In neoIT&apos;s Offshore Attractiveness Index for ITS, the Czech Republic ranks 6 th after <lb/>countries like India and China that score higher for industry maturity but ahead of the Philippines (see <lb/>Annexes F-G). For international supply of BPS, the Czech Republic ranks 7 th behind India and the <lb/>Philippines but ahead of China. In both areas, Poland and Ireland rank somewhat higher than the Czech <lb/>Republic and it highlights the fact that different countries have different comparative advantages within the <lb/>diverse BPS and ITS sectors. <lb/>Market characteristics <lb/>54. <lb/>According to the IDC (2006b), total revenue in the Czech ITS sector was US$ 1.15 billion in <lb/>2005 and the market has grown by roughly ten percent per year. Growth in external services expenditure is <lb/>triggered by low but increasing domestic outsourcing, public procurement and new establishments of <lb/></body>

			<note place="footnote">21 The EIU evaluation model also shows that high-income countries like Canada, Singapore and Hong Kong are <lb/>among the top seven most attractive &quot; offshoring environments &quot; due to their skilled workforces, quality infrastructure <lb/>and regulatory environments. <lb/></note>

			<body>shared services centres by foreign multinationals. The domestic market is increasingly attractive for both <lb/>domestic and foreign suppliers. In 2005, hardware and software support and installation services made up <lb/>28 percent of the market, systems integration 22 percent, customisation 23 percent and outsourcing 15 <lb/>percent. The finance sector (26 percent of the market), combined manufacturing sector (16 percent) and <lb/>government sector (14 percent) were the major client sectors. <lb/>55. <lb/>The ten largest ITS companies captured 38 percent of the market and seven of those – including <lb/>the top six – are subsidiaries of foreign multinationals (see Annex K). A few big foreign companies <lb/>dominate the government procurement market. Domestically-owned companies are strong in certain niche <lb/>markets for the supply of IT services: e.g. Unicorn is market leader in custom application development; <lb/>and AutoCont CZ and ČEZData are market leaders in network and desktop outsourcing. However, revenue <lb/>is to a large extent generated by domestic clients rather than through exports. <lb/>56. <lb/>So far, the home-grown Czech BPS and ITS sectors have neither amassed critical size nor <lb/>developed significant presence in client countries. McKinsey (2006) argues that this fact is due to <lb/>increasing business opportunities at home, regulations and inconsistencies in labour laws that complicate <lb/>foreign expansion, and a relatively slow embrace of international sourcing by Central and Eastern <lb/>European companies. The international supply of BPS and ITS that stems from the Czech Republic is <lb/>mainly generated by a limited number of foreign multinationals, predominantly in the IT field, that provide <lb/>services to their European clients from shared services centres. The Czech Republic is not a traditional <lb/>offshoring destination where internationally insourced and outsourced services are delivered to clients in <lb/>far away countries but rather a nearshoring destination where internationally insourced services are <lb/>delivered to other European countries. <lb/>57. <lb/>McKinsey (2006) estimates that the global market for offshore IT and business process services <lb/>is worth around US$ 30 billion and Eastern Europe supplies less than one percent of this value. In 2004, <lb/>the Czech Republic exported approximately US$ 60 million of ITS, up from US$ 26 million 22 in 2003 and <lb/>US$ 40 million of BPS, up from US$ 15 million in 2003 (Vashistha et al., 2005; neoIT, 2004). These <lb/>estimates indicate that the industry is growing from a fairly modest level and is still preoccupied with <lb/>serving the domestic market. Like in China, the Czech BPS and ITS sectors are still relatively immature <lb/>and trying to build capacity to serve a more international clientele in the future. <lb/>58. <lb/>According to survey results from 2005, covering 52 out of a total of 150 companies that provide <lb/>outsourced ITS in the Czech Republic, most companies reside in Prague with second tier cities like <lb/>Ostrava, Plzen and Brno gaining in significance due to local access to graduates from technical universities <lb/>and lower labour costs (70-80 percent of Prague salaries) (IT Outsourcing Center, 2005). Major export <lb/>markets for the surveyed companies were neighbouring Germany, Austria and Slovakia. UK, Germany and <lb/>Austria were the largest markets for BPS. Other client locations included Canada, USA and the Nordic <lb/>countries. <lb/>Nearshoring <lb/>59. <lb/>Nearshoring is a process where a specific country is chosen to service countries within close <lb/>geographic proximity due to its favourable combination of labour cost, access to talent, cultural proximity <lb/>and other enabling factors. 23 The Czech Republic is becoming a nearshoring destination of choice for <lb/>multinationals wishing to consolidate their back office and IT support in shared service centres serving <lb/></body>

			<note place="footnote">22 The estimate includes domestic ITS companies and multinationals with service delivery operations in the Czech <lb/>Republic. <lb/>23 The Czech workforce is too costly and too limited in size to develop into an &quot; offshore &quot; destination servicing non-<lb/>European markets. <lb/></note>

			<body>continental Europe. 24 Central and Eastern European countries are rising to the top of the list for <lb/>multinationals seeking to reduce costs for BPS and ITS supply in Europe but unwilling to bear the risks <lb/>associated with offshoring to Asia. <lb/>60. <lb/>One of the main investors in the BPS and ITS field in the Czech Republic is DHL, which <lb/>operates a large shared services centre in Prague to track transactions and handle billing for its European <lb/>customers (see Box 4). IBM operates a 1,200 strong workforce in its Integrated Delivery Centre in Brno <lb/>that is part of IBM&apos;s global delivery strategy and Accenture has 1,250 services professionals at its shared <lb/>service centre in Prague providing business solutions in the areas of for example finance and accounting to <lb/>European clients (IDC, 2006). Other examples of shared – or nearshoring – centres include ExxonMobil <lb/>(shared financial and accounting service centre), Hewlett-Packard (EMEA regional headquarters), Icon <lb/>Communication Centers (outsourcing contact centre), Lufthansa (data processing centre), Siemens (shared <lb/>financial and accounting service centre), Symbol Technologies (shared servicing and financial service <lb/>centre) and Tesco Stores (shared service centre for IT, finance and accounting). 25 <lb/>61. <lb/>Leading Indian BPS and ITS companies have also started to invest in development centres in <lb/>Europe and in particular in Eastern Europe. The global delivery model that was pioneered by the Indian <lb/>outsourcing industry is not optimal for many foreign clients and it is often easier and more effective to <lb/>serve European clients from countries like the Czech Republic. Progeon, a subsidiary of Infosys <lb/>Technologies, was the first Indian IT-related investment in the Czech Republic. The company has 100 <lb/>professionals providing IT support services from its Prague office and another 100 professionals providing <lb/>BPS from its office in Brno. The company plans to increase its Czech workforce to 1,000 in the near <lb/>future. 26 <lb/>Box 4. Serving European clients from the Czech Republic <lb/>Following the integration of DHL, Danzas and Deutsche Port Euro Express in April 2003, the new DHL, with <lb/>headquarter in Bonn, decided to establish three global IT services centres to provide 24/7/365 IT support to its <lb/>120,000 clients that send more than one billion parcels annually. Prague was chosen as the European centre, <lb/>replacing smaller units in Switzerland and the UK, and other global IT services centres were located in Scottsdale <lb/>and Kuala Lumpur. These Czech, U.S. and Malaysian centres are interconnected via a corporate <lb/>telecommunications network and support DHL&apos;s mail, express and logistics businesses around the world. <lb/>The Prague centre was fully operational by January 2005 and DHL plans to invest €500 million over five years in <lb/>its Prague operations. By 2008, the Prague centre is likely to employ some 2,000 employees. According to DHL&apos;s <lb/>CIO, the Czech Republic was chosen for its &quot; availability of skilled and flexible labour force, well established and <lb/>reliable telecommunications networks, good air links as well as for the optimum incentives package offered by the <lb/>Czech government &quot; . DHL hopes the project will reduce its US$ 1 billion IT budget by 60 percent and the <lb/>consolidation of support centres has already increased productivity by 20 percent. <lb/>Source: Czech Focus (2005), EIU (2006) and McCue (2004). <lb/>62. <lb/>The reason why the demand for nearshoring services is growing is that it is easier to service <lb/>foreign clients from a closer geography. According to DiamondCluster (2005), client satisfaction has <lb/>dropped recently for offshored services. Management complexity is a significant deterrent. Cultural <lb/>proximity has a big impact on communication and large time-zone differences are a disadvantage for <lb/>24 Other common locations for shared services centres include Ireland, Hungary, Slovakia and Romania. <lb/>25 According to the www.czechinvest.org website. <lb/>26 According to CzechInvest. <lb/></body>

			<body>certain types of services. For SMEs, nearshoring is often the only viable alternative to keeping operations <lb/>at home due to management overhead costs and operational risks associated with offshoring. An added <lb/>benefit of nearshore locations like the Czech Republic is also that sensitive data remain within a regulatory <lb/>environment similar to the one of the client&apos;s home country. <lb/>63. <lb/>The Czech Republic is vying for the same foreign business as other Eastern European countries <lb/>like Hungary, Slovakia, Poland and Romania. So far, these countries have all managed to attract a fair <lb/>share of international investment. The different markets have yet to clearly differentiate their service <lb/>capabilities. These countries have similar strengths and weaknesses and government officials and <lb/>companies compete for as large a share of investment as possible in the hope that foreign multinationals <lb/>will establish service centres which in time will yield technological spillover effects and transfers of <lb/>management know-how to the domestic industry. <lb/>The role of the Czech government in attracting foreign investment <lb/>64. <lb/>The Czech government provides investment incentives through the CzechInvest agency. <lb/>CzechInvest has identified the BPS sector as one of its top priorities. According to Government Decree <lb/>1238 of 10 December 2003, the Framework Programme for Support of Technology Centres and Centres of <lb/>Business Support Services, foreign investors that establish headquarters, software development centres or <lb/>expert solution centres and invest a minimum of €0.5 million, create a minimum of 15 new jobs sustained <lb/>for five years, and export at least 50 percent of supply are eligible for support. For call centres, high-tech <lb/>repair centres, shared services centres, the minimum investment is €1 million and the number of new jobs <lb/>50. Companies are also required to finance a minimum of €0.25-0.5 million from their own equity <lb/>(CzechInvest, 2006). The incentives consist of subsidy grants for: <lb/>• business activities, with up to 50 percent of eligible business expenses (wage or capital <lb/>expenditure on tangible and intangible assets) paid during the a maximum of ten years and up to <lb/>the ceiling of state aid; and<lb/>• training and re-training, with up to 35 percent (30 percent in Prague) of special training costs <lb/>and 60 percent (55 percent in Prague) of general training costs paid during a period of 3-5 years <lb/>and dependent on the number of jobs created. 27 The maximum training subsidy is CZK 100,000-<lb/>150,000 per employee.<lb/>65. <lb/>The maximum ceilings for state aid during 2007-2013 period were not yet negotiated when this <lb/>report was prepared. However, the maximum ceilings are likely to be reduced from 20-50 percent to 10-40 <lb/>percent depending on the region receiving the investment. Between June 2001 and 16 November 2006, 90 <lb/>companies had been approved by CzechInvest to receive financial support. In return, these companies have <lb/>pledged to invest €492 million and create 14,872 jobs. A majority of the jobs are for university graduates. <lb/>Figure 2-3 show the country of origin of the companies that established services centres in the Czech <lb/>Republic and the jobs created by the various investments. Next to the ten percent of jobs created by Czech <lb/>companies, the most labour-intensive investments were undertaken by EU-based companies (57 percent), <lb/>U.S. companies (22 percent) and Indian companies (7 percent). <lb/></body>

			<body>66. <lb/>The industry association the Czech ICT Alliance was founded under the auspices of CzechTrade <lb/>in December 2005. Its role is to help enhance the international profile of the Czech ICT industry. <lb/>Improving the visibility of the Czech BPS and ITS sectors is needed in an increasingly competitive <lb/>international business environment and the Czech Republic has yet to differentiate itself from neighbouring <lb/>countries. The main reason why government incentives are perceived as important in Central and Eastern <lb/>Europe is that the country profiles are relatively similar. A more generous government funded programme <lb/>can make the difference when foreign investors decide where to locate shared services centres in the <lb/>region. The situation is different in China, India or the Philippines where country profiles differ <lb/>significantly and cost structures are lower. <lb/>67. <lb/>While the Czech government is supportive of the BPS and ITS sectors, there is much room for <lb/>improvement in its procurement policy. Government procurement is dominated by a few large companies <lb/>and several observers argue that the procurement process could be significantly more open and <lb/>transparent. 28 Survey results provided by the World Bank (2006) show that the share of companies <lb/>describing corruption as a problem for their operations and growth in the Czech Republic has drastically <lb/>increased. Between 2002 and 2005, the share increased from 28 percent to 49 percent. This situation is a <lb/>great deal worse than in Slovakia, Poland and Bulgaria where the development was the opposite. <lb/>Challenges to the Czech BPS and ITS sectors in supplying international markets <lb/>68. <lb/>The business challenges facing the Czech BPS and ITS sectors in their quest to serve <lb/>international markets are to a large extent related to the operational issues that face any nascent industry <lb/>that starts to target foreign markets. On the supply side, these challenges are related to recruiting <lb/>technically adept professionals and experienced managers that master foreign languages, building domain <lb/>expertise, boosting productivity and managing complexity in an increasingly international market place. <lb/>On the demand side, the main challenges are to develop sales and marketing organisations abroad and in <lb/></body>

			<body>general increase the visibility of the Czech Republic as a location for BPS and ITS supply. While Czech <lb/>exports of BPS and ITS still are relatively modest, the country has the potential to attract significant <lb/>amounts of foreign business and the Czech government hopes that the BPS and ITS sectors will help <lb/>reduce the economy&apos;s strong dependency on exports of manufactured goods (see Annex I). <lb/>69. <lb/>A survey by the IT Outsourcing Center in 2005 highlighted two challenges affecting the Czech <lb/>services sector. First, there is a scarcity of technical personnel: the number of university graduates is <lb/>relatively low and some of the software engineers migrate abroad. Second, the cost effectiveness of the <lb/>Czech BPS and ITS sectors is being diminished by salary inflation, taxation and high levels of <lb/>bureaucracy. According to CzechInvest (2004) and the Czech Ministry of Informatics (2006), Czech BPS <lb/>and ITS companies suffer from their inability to effectively market themselves abroad and tend to rely <lb/>heavily on their technical competence. The industry would gain from a more German and English <lb/>proficient workforce, a more developed service culture and improved IPR protection. The capital market <lb/>for SMEs is also a concern: e.g. Cermak et al. (2006) argue that access to capital has increased following <lb/>the privatisation of the Czech banking industry but SMEs still suffer from limited access to capital. These <lb/>weaknesses put the Czech Republic in a challenging situation where high-value services are provided <lb/>mainly by Western companies while companies in Eastern Europe are building capacity and increasingly <lb/>compete on cost in the same foreign markets as the Czech industry. <lb/>70. <lb/>The labour cost arbitrage is not likely to be sustained in the long term and future EU accession <lb/>countries, Bulgaria and Romania, are expected to increase the competition especially on the lower end of <lb/>the services value chain. Ukraine is also a potential low-cost location for BPS and ITS work and a future <lb/>competing geography for the Czech industry. However, companies from China, India and the Philippines, <lb/>which are studied in this report, are not competing directly for the same business as the Czech industry. <lb/>71. <lb/>During the next decade, it is likely that some of the BPS and ITS work that is done in the Czech <lb/>Republic will migrate eastwards due to labour cost differences. In the hardening competition with the <lb/>Czech Republic&apos;s eastern neighbours, Hungary, Slovakia, Poland and Romania, and non-EU members <lb/>Ukraine and Russia, the Czech sector will need to move up the value chain and find niche areas where it <lb/>can be at the forefront in specific domains or areas of technical expertise. The Czech industry may gain <lb/>from an increased participation by companies further east if it can develop a business model that leverages <lb/>the capabilities in those countries. Czech companies may for example outsource or insource some of their <lb/>work to those countries. To become a more attractive partner to international clients, the Czech industry <lb/>will need to increasingly focus on process maturity and quality control (e.g. certification such as ISO and <lb/>SEI CMMi) and develop effective sales and marketing channels abroad. <lb/>Supply side constraints <lb/>Recruitment and retention <lb/>72. <lb/>The Czech education system – in particular its technological universities – is one of the country&apos;s <lb/>inherent strengths and a decisive factor for potential new ITS establishments. 92 percent of Czechs in their <lb/>twenties have completed higher secondary education (compared to an EU average of 69 percent) and <lb/>around 30 percent of tertiary students enrol in science, engineering, manufacturing and construction <lb/>programmes (see Annex J). This is higher than in many other emerging markets and according to OECD&apos;s <lb/>Pisa study, the Czech Republic has the highest quality of maths and science education in Central and <lb/>Eastern Europe (CzechInvest, 2005). The Czech Republic produces 14,000 university graduates in <lb/>technical and scientific subjects each year (neoIT, 2004) and there are currently some 26,700 students in <lb/>IT-related fields in the Czech Republic (CzechInvest, 2005). Estimates of the annual number of IT <lb/>graduates vary: 2,000-3,000 graduates result from a narrow definition of an &quot; IT graduate &quot; and the number <lb/>increases to 4,000 with a broader definition. <lb/></body>

			<body>73. <lb/>According to figures by Universitas, 60 percent of 18-29 year-olds speak some English and 52 <lb/>percent have studied German. 29 The proportion of Czechs that can speak English is set to increase since 95 <lb/>percent of secondary school students study English (neoIT, 2004). Russian is a common language among <lb/>older generations. What is worrying to the BPS and ITS sectors, however, is that although total spending <lb/>per pupil has increased by 15 percent in real terms since 1989, spending per university student has fallen <lb/>by more than 40 percent in real terms and the rate of admission to tertiary education among university-age <lb/>students is the third lowest in the OECD (EIU, 2006). The domestic workforce is also set to shrink in the <lb/>future due to the extremely low birth rates experienced in the 1990s. As a result of this demographic shock, <lb/>Czech universities will either need to reduce entrance requirements or enrol fewer students in the future. <lb/>New policies to attract foreign labour may be necessary to help smooth expected labour shortages. <lb/>74. <lb/>In 2006, the Czech BPS and ITS companies could still recruit manpower without too much of a <lb/>problem – at least outside Prague. Most foreign establishments are located in Prague and tend to pay a <lb/>significant wage premium compared to domestically-owned companies. Staff attrition is less of a problem <lb/>in the Czech Republic than in the Asian countries studied in this report, in particular India. It does happen, <lb/>however, that multinationals enter the Czech market and pledge to recruit hundreds of workers within a <lb/>short period of time and this tends to create short-term fluctuations with regard to staff attrition and put <lb/>upward pressure on salaries. <lb/>75. <lb/>As in China, the Czech BPS and ITS sectors suffer from a shortage of experienced managers that <lb/>are both customer focused and quality conscious (Economist, 2005). Managers with strong backgrounds in <lb/>both domestic and foreign markets, at ease with the business acumen and communication standards <lb/>expected by foreign clients, are equally in short supply. This situation is not helped by the general <lb/>unwillingness of Czechs to move and work in new cities. It is also challenging for the ITS sector to find <lb/>senior programmers with 5-7 years of work experience since such professionals tend to have management <lb/>positions. <lb/>Regulatory challenges <lb/>76. <lb/>The Czech business environment has in many regards improved over the last years and corporate <lb/>taxation is being trimmed in line with competition from other newly acceded EU members. Annex C <lb/>shows that Czech regulatory and institutional efficiency affecting the business community is broadly on <lb/>parity with the OECD average in the areas of investor protection, access to credit, paying taxes and <lb/>employing workers. There is still a lot of room for improvement when it comes to the ease with which <lb/>entrepreneurs can start a business, close a business and enforce contracts. The judicial system is <lb/>particularly slow compared to the OECD average and also slower than in China and the Philippines. <lb/>77. <lb/>Czech ITS companies do seldom employ a service delivery model based on the temporary <lb/>movement of service personnel. The economics behind the global delivery model, which is based on <lb/>service personnel migrating temporarily from the supplier to the client, is not feasible in the Czech <lb/>business environment. Yet some key personnel need to be transferred abroad at times and this is made <lb/>more difficult by the decision of some EU countries to phase in the freedom of movement in the European <lb/>internal market over a number of years. However, this is a temporary restriction that only affects a limited <lb/>number of ITS projects involving foreign clients. Most Czech professionals are working to serve the <lb/>domestic market and those serving foreign markets are predominantly working for foreign companies that <lb/>can move skilled personnel without problems. With regard to movement between the Czech Republic and <lb/>non-EU countries in Eastern Europe, movement of high-skilled workers is less difficult that movement of <lb/>low skilled workers. <lb/></body>

			<body>THE INDIAN BPS AND ITS SECTORS <lb/>78. <lb/>India is the leading emerging market exporter of BPS and ITS to the OECD area. India&apos;s export-<lb/>oriented ITS sector started to gain momentum already in the middle of the 1990s and has grown rapidly <lb/>since then. The success of the ITS sector is demonstrated by the fact that three Indian ITS companies <lb/>ranked among the world&apos;s six most valuable ITS companies in 2006. 30 Each one of these Indian companies <lb/>exported more services than the combined ITS sectors of China, the Czech Republic and the Philippines <lb/>(see Table 3 and Annex K). <lb/>79. <lb/>The Indian BPS sector is less mature than the ITS sector and started to reach scale only some 3-4 <lb/>years ago. It faces strong competition from other emerging markets such as the Philippines for services in <lb/>English. Indian companies are increasingly investing in emerging markets with complementary language <lb/>capabilities, including in China to serve East Asian markets, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Hungary to <lb/>serve EU countries, and in the Philippines to serve American clients. In addition, some of the leading <lb/>Indian companies are increasingly investing in supply capacity in other OECD markets. <lb/>80. <lb/>India&apos;s strength lies in its large English proficient talent pool and its large sophisticated BPS and <lb/>ITS companies. The BPS and ITS sectors are labour-intensive rather than capital-intensive and a highly <lb/>skilled workforce with language and communication capabilities is paramount in serving foreign markets. <lb/>Compared to other emerging markets that export BPS and ITS, India stands out with its more mature and <lb/>experienced home-grown industry and the combination of size and quality of the relevant workforce. <lb/>Inexpensive labour helps attract foreign business but Indian labour costs are not discernibly different from <lb/>some other leading emerging markets such as China (see Annexes D and H). <lb/>81. <lb/>The Indian business environment is the industry&apos;s main weakness. The over-burdened <lb/>infrastructure lacks adequate investment and the country risk is perceived to be higher than in countries <lb/>like China and the Czech Republic (neoIT, 2006). Fierce competition for the country&apos;s top talent has led to <lb/>rapid salary inflation and high attrition rates. Indian culture also lends itself less well to serve far off <lb/>markets than for example the Czech Republic and the Philippines with cultural proximity to the main <lb/>export markets in Europe and the United States respectively. <lb/>Market characteristics <lb/>82. <lb/>During the 1990s, India&apos;s compound annual growth rate (CAGR) for services exports was 17 <lb/>percent – the highest growth rate among the world&apos;s top 15 services exporters (World Bank, 2004). <lb/>According to Nasscom (2006), in the financial year ending March 2006, India exported BPS for US$ 6.3 <lb/>billion and ITS for US$ 13.2 billion. Custom application development and application management were <lb/>the two dominant service categories (see Table 1). MGI (2005a) estimates that India accounts for 72 <lb/>percent of ITS originating from low-wage regions and as much as 88 percent of such imports in the UK. <lb/></body>

			<body>The industry is strongly dependent on foreign markets: the domestic market for BPS and ITS was worth <lb/>around US$ 5.2 billion, or 21 percent of the total supply. 31 <lb/>83. <lb/>In terms of export markets, the United States is the single largest destination for Indian BPS and <lb/>ITS: it captures two-thirds of exports and this share has remained stable over time. The UK is the second <lb/>largest client country and absorbs 14 percent of Indian BPS and ITS exports (see Figure 4). The private <lb/>sector in the UK sources marginally more BPS and ITS from India than the private sector in the United <lb/>States if account is taken of the relative sizes of their economies. Indian companies have targeted other <lb/>overseas markets for many years but these investments have generated limited returns. Japan and Germany <lb/>are the third and fourth biggest export markets but none of them business exceeding US$ 500 million. In <lb/>total, 84.3 percent of Indian BPS and ITS exports were captured by English-speaking countries in the year <lb/>ending March 2005. 32 This figure would most likely be higher if American and British companies <lb/>operating from other non-Anglophone countries were included. <lb/>Table 1.

The top five companies generated 46 percent of <lb/>Indian ITS exports and 4-5 percent of BPS exports. 33 Another ten home-grown companies supply one-<lb/>fourth of ITS exports and 4-5 percent of BPS. The thirty largest captive units of foreign multinationals <lb/>supply 15 percent of ITS exports and the 150 largest captive units make up 50 percent of the Indian BPS <lb/>market. This implies that India works predominantly as a centre for international outsourcing for ITS and <lb/>both as a centre for international insourcing and international outsourcing in the BPS sector. <lb/>85. <lb/>The Indian-owned BPS and ITS companies are increasingly establishing supply capacity in <lb/>locations outside India, for e.g. through cross-border acquisitions, acquisitions of IT departments of clients <lb/>and through greenfield investments. While Indian companies are going global, moving into both emerging <lb/>31 In addition to BPS and ITS, Indian companies exported an estimated US$ 3.9 billion worth of engineering services, <lb/>R&amp;D services and software products. <lb/>32 That is Australia, Canada, Singapore, UK and the United States. <lb/>33 www.nasscom.in/upload/5216/Indian_IT_Industry_Factsheet_2006.pdf. <lb/></body>

			<body>markets and OECD markets, more and more OECD-based ICT multinationals are growing their presence <lb/>in India. Annex L presents estimates of the workforces of leading ITS multinationals. In 2005, <lb/>approximately 11 percent of the combined workforce of foreign multinationals presented in the annex was <lb/>based in India. According to Nasscom (2006), this share is growing and expected to reach 14 percent by <lb/>2007. Some companies, like Accenture and IBM Services, have roughly one fifth of their workforces in <lb/>India. Other companies like Cap Gemini and EDS have relatively few Indian employees. <lb/>86. <lb/>Total employment in the export-oriented Indian BPS and ITS sectors was estimated at 0.8 million <lb/>in the fiscal year ending March 2006. The workforce was split equally between the BPS sector and the ITS <lb/>sector. A total of 1.3 million workers were employed in the Indian BPS and ITS sectors (for both domestic <lb/>and foreign supply) and the sectors serving foreign markets with software products, R&amp;D and engineering <lb/>services. These combined sectors sustain an estimated 3 million jobs through indirect and induced <lb/>employment (Nasscom, 2006). The former kind of employment is projected from expenditure on <lb/>telecommunications, power, construction, facility management, IT, transportation, catering and other <lb/>services. The latter kind of employment is driven by consumption of employees on food, clothing, utilities, <lb/>recreation, health and other services. <lb/>Box 5. The global delivery model for IT services <lb/>The global delivery model (GDM) for IT services makes use of a combination of cross-border supply and <lb/>temporary labour migration and was pioneered by Indian companies in the 1980s and 1990s. During the early <lb/>years, before international fibre networks and the Internet were common place, documents and audiotapes were <lb/>flown to India for digitisation and transcription. Basic programming work was also conducted for foreign <lb/>multinationals. With time, Indian companies started sending IT specialists to their clients&apos; premises for software <lb/>programming work. This practice reached a peak in the lead up to year 2000 when demand for IT professionals <lb/>exceeded supply in many OECD countries. <lb/>The rapid growth in ICT networks, reductions in communication costs, and technological progress made it <lb/>possible to keep an increasing number of IT professionals back in India (offshore) working with the Indian team at <lb/>the client site (onsite). The Indian professionals at the client site defined the project requirements, coordinated <lb/>work, installed software, trained client staff and provided rapid-reaction maintenance services while team <lb/>members in India provided technology tasks such as technical and database design, programming, testing, <lb/>documentation and long-term maintenance services. This business model was economically compelling due to the <lb/>labour cost arbitrage between IT professionals in the client country and those working in India. It was also a highly <lb/>challenging process to manage that only the Indians came to fully master among the emerging markets players. <lb/>Over time, the need to keep a sizeable Indian team at the client site has been reduced. Between 2000 and 2005, the <lb/>industry-wide average proportion of onsite work dropped from 67 percent to 42 percent. The size of the ratio of <lb/>offshore/onsite work component is directly proportionate to savings of labour costs but the same also holds for the <lb/>complexity of managing the project. Hence the optimal offshore/onsite ratio varies from project to project. <lb/>The GDM has grown increasingly complex and sophisticated with time. Today large Indian companies break <lb/>pieces of work into logical components and distribute them to locations where they can be most cost-effectively <lb/>performed. For example, a client engaging an Indian company in London may interact with the Indian company&apos;s <lb/>sales team, which is permanently based in London, and during the project life cycle host a team of senior Indian IT <lb/>specialists that coordinate and implement different IT components provided from Bangalore, Jaipur and Budapest. <lb/>The Indian company may then provide maintenance services from its development centres in Belfast and Budapest <lb/>and technical telephone support from Bangalore. <lb/>Source: OECD (2006), Kumra and Sinha (2003), Nasscom (2006) and www.infosys.com. <lb/></body>

			<body>Challenges to India&apos;s BPS and ITS sectors in supplying international markets <lb/>87. <lb/>The Indian BPS and ITS sectors benefit from a strong industry association in Nasscom. It has <lb/>helped enhance transparency in the industry; promote industry standards, best practises and foreign direct <lb/>investment; and it has been particularly successful at selling the industry abroad. Nasscom (2006) has <lb/>identified three pillars where the industry faces significant challenges: cyber security (piracy, privacy, data <lb/>protection and IPR), human resources, and infrastructure (in particular airports, mass transport systems, <lb/>roads and electricity). <lb/>88. <lb/>In general, companies operating in India are also subject to excessive bureaucracy and <lb/>regulations. The country scores poorly in several of the indicators provided by the World Bank&apos;s <lb/>benchmarking exercise Doing Business (see Annex C). These include in particular indicators for starting a <lb/>business (lengthy and tedious), closing a business (lengthy and with low recovery rates), taxation (highest <lb/>tax rate) and labour market rigidity. Enforcing a contract is a nightmare: it takes on average some 1,420 <lb/>days, one of the world&apos;s worst records. As a result, legal contracts are signed in client countries and <lb/>covered by the client country&apos;s jurisprudence. <lb/>89. <lb/>To the benefit of the BPS and ITS sectors, the business environment is significantly improved in <lb/>the Indian Software Technology Parks (STP) that were introduced in the early 1990s, and which is where <lb/>export-oriented companies operate. The STPs have the same function as export processing zones. They <lb/>provide tax exemptions, bridge gaps related to infrastructure, and offer a more conducive business <lb/>environment. For foreign multinationals, most of the administrative burden is drastically cut in the STPs <lb/>and many of the remaining issues can be solved by hiring external consulting companies. <lb/>90. <lb/>The World Bank (2004) argues that India must address two critical challenges in order to sustain <lb/>the dynamism of its service sector: externally, the problem of actual and potential protectionism; and <lb/>domestically, the persistence of restrictions on trade and investment as well as weaknesses in its regulatory <lb/>framework. To address the former problem, India will need to secure access to foreign markets. However, <lb/>the most pressing challenges facing the BPS and ITS sectors companies today relate to supply side <lb/>constraints. The following section reviews the concerns addressed by Indian companies and foreign <lb/>multinationals with substantial operations in India. <lb/>Supply side constraints <lb/>Recruitment and retention <lb/>91. <lb/>Most BPS and ITS companies in India struggle with recruitment and retention of professionals. <lb/>The problem is not the number of graduates produced every year but rather their quality. While the share of <lb/>graduates that are adequately trained for work in the export-oriented BPS and ITS sectors is higher than in <lb/>a country like China, the relative size of the combined BPS and ITS workforces (around 0.8 million in <lb/>March 2006) and the high growth of the industry have increased HR activities. Although there is no <lb/>shortage of young professionals looking for employment, investment in screening and training is <lb/>substantial and keeps rising in line with the high number of graduates that are recruited. Foreign <lb/>multinationals tend to tackle these issues by paying a significant wage premium compared to Indian <lb/>companies. <lb/>92. <lb/>Retention is another challenge since most ITS talent is concentrated in centres such as Bangalore, <lb/>Chennai, Delhi, Hyderabad and Mumbai. Staff attrition rates in the BPS sector may be lower than in most <lb/>OECD countries, especially for voice-based services, but frequent job hopping reduces BPS companies&apos; <lb/>productivity and tends to fuel salary inflation. Dange et al (2005) estimates that every 5 percent of <lb/>employee attrition reduces gross margins by up to 1.5 percent. However, India has an advantage compared <lb/></body>

			<body>to the other countries studies in this paper since its BPS and ITS sectors pioneered the offshoring business <lb/>and have the broadest and deepest pool of project managers and senior managers. <lb/>Restrictions on temporary movement of ITS personnel 34 <lb/>93. <lb/>The global delivery model (GDM), used by most Indian companies to export ITS, is dependent <lb/>on international transfers of senior personnel between home and foreign client offices (see Box 5). On <lb/>average, approximately one-third of operational manpower in a typical Indian ITS company is situated at <lb/>the client site throughout a project life cycle. But the allocation of personnel varies from company to <lb/>company, project to project, and throughout the project life cycle. Many medium and large Indian <lb/>companies have permanent staff employed in client country subsidiaries. These professionals typically <lb/>manage client interaction, in particular related to sales and marketing activities, but some of the largest <lb/>companies, like Infosys Technologies and TCS, maintain a growing number of operational staff as well. <lb/>However, most operations such as software development are still carried out by professionals based in <lb/>India or other emerging markets, including China, Eastern Europe and the Philippines. <lb/>94. <lb/>The manpower located at client site has gradually dropped from more than two-thirds in the mid-<lb/>1990s to one-third today. This ratio of work at client site is likely to continue to edge downwards due to <lb/>technological improvements and maturing GDMs. Yet there is a limit to the amount of work that can be <lb/>carried out offshore: the economics of international outsourcing lies in maximising the amount of work <lb/>carried out in cost-effective locations; and face-to-face client interaction is still paramount to achieve <lb/>operational efficiency. The GDM employed by Indian companies will continue to be dependent on <lb/>international transfers of managers and IT professionals in the foreseeable future. <lb/>95. <lb/>The administrative process related to documentation for business visits to client countries can be <lb/>a challenge for Indian ITS companies. Some of the issues related to administration and documentation are <lb/>removed with time as trust is built in new client countries and authorities realise the value that visiting <lb/>professionals provide. American and British authorities have long experience of handling Indian visa and <lb/>work permit applications but this does not hold for many other OECD countries. There has been some <lb/>improvement in the visa and work permit administration and there is scope for further improvement. <lb/>96. <lb/>Rules concerning business visas and work permits are issues of national sovereignty. Each <lb/>country designs the requirements and administrative procedure deemed necessary to provide business visas <lb/>and work permits to foreign citizens consistent with national objectives. The following section presents <lb/>some frequently raised concerns in this area in the Indian ITS sector. In general, while there are direct costs <lb/>associated with the documentation and application process for movement of personnel, the concerns raised <lb/>relate more often to the time and uncertainty involved. The direct costs are regarded as an additional <lb/>overhead while time and uncertainty cause large indirect costs or even break deals. <lb/>Business visas and work permit requirements <lb/>97. <lb/>The process of obtaining a business visa is relatively straightforward in most of India&apos;s export <lb/>markets. However, the discrepancy between countries can be significant: the process of obtaining a <lb/>business visa can take anything from one to ten working days in India. Some companies report that they <lb/>frequently obtain business visas with shorter valid times than they apply for. This adds complexity and <lb/>uncertainty since companies may have to pay cancelling and rebooking fees for air tickets and hotels, and <lb/>reschedule project plans and client meetings, etc. The visa holder may also need to return to India only to <lb/>go through the application process again before finalising the business with the client. <lb/></body>

			<body>98. <lb/>The administrative process for work permits is more stringent than for business visas. Some <lb/>countries make use of quota systems to control and manage the number of work permits that can be issued <lb/>each year. Work permits are usually issued for visitors that do billable work or stay for more than three <lb/>months. An advantage of the application process for work permits compared to the process for business <lb/>visas is that there is less discretion in the administrative process and there are seldom issues concerning the <lb/>duration of stay. <lb/>99. <lb/>The current application procedure for work permits leaves the decision to the discretion of the <lb/>official handling the application. In many countries, applicants need to submit documents in original <lb/>copies, schedule an interview for which there may be 45-120 days of waiting time, and then convince the <lb/>official during the interview that he/she has no intention to migrate on a permanent basis or overstay the <lb/>approved duration of stay. This recurring issue is due to the fact that many countries do not differentiate <lb/>the handling of applications for permanent migration and temporary movement of natural persons. The <lb/>applicant who presents the requested documentation may also be asked to provide additional <lb/>documentation at a later stage to verify the obligatory documentation. This process may involve rounds of <lb/>translation and legalisation of documents. <lb/>100. <lb/>For example, some records such as birth certificates and educational diplomas first need to be <lb/>legalised by the local state government. The legalised documents are then translated to the language of the <lb/>country for which the application is due before the translated version of the legalised document in turn may <lb/>need to be legalised. For certain documents, the procedure can involve up to three levels of legalisation and <lb/>visits to the applicant&apos;s hometown, the local state authority and government ministry in New Delhi. In <lb/>some countries, Indian ITS professionals go through a process that can take more than six months in order <lb/>to obtain a work permit. In some cases the waiting time can be 8-10 months. The processing time makes it <lb/>impossible to undertake certain projects and may not only result in lost business opportunities but also <lb/>damage client relations. <lb/>101. <lb/>The administrative process for issuing work permits is less of a concern for Indian professionals <lb/>working for foreign subsidiaries than for home-grown companies. Many foreign subsidiaries are product <lb/>development centres and the employees of these centres seldom need to interact directly with clients or <lb/>work abroad. Employees who still need a work permit can normally move as intra-corporate transferees. <lb/>The administrative process for such movement is relatively efficient and subject to few restrictions. The <lb/>situation is different for employees of Indian-owned companies. Some of the largest Indian companies <lb/>have subsidiaries with local employees in their main client countries and this generally facilitates the work <lb/>permit process since employees can move as intra-corporate transferees. However, the great majority of <lb/>Indian companies do not have the financial strength or the business model to establish operational units in <lb/>client countries and they depend on the effectiveness of client country embassies and consulates. <lb/>102. <lb/>Work permits may come with regulations concerning minimum wage levels or wage parity <lb/>requirements. While these occasionally inflate the final client bill, wage regulations seldom have any real <lb/>effect since most professionals sent to work abroad have reached a seniority and wage level that exceed <lb/>these requirements. More burdensome is the additional layer of administrative work needed to prove that <lb/>the company comply with all the rules. A fair, predictable, transparent and streamlined process for business <lb/>visa and work permit applications would benefit both the client and the supplier. <lb/>103. <lb/>Indian IT companies have developed sophisticated mechanisms to minimise potential <lb/>disturbances to their operations: large companies have dedicated departments which handle travel logistics <lb/>and applications for business visas and work permits. Each project leader may be in charge of the visa <lb/>planning for the professionals in his/her project. Most companies also employ professional consulting <lb/>companies to help with translation, legalisation and temporary migration issues. Long-term client relations <lb/>facilitate this planning process and increase predictability. <lb/></body>

			<page>33 <lb/></page>

			<body>104. <lb/>There are three principal ways which Indian companies can reduce their dependence on work <lb/>permits in the future. One way is to establish development centres in client countries (see OECD (2006b)). <lb/>This approach reduces the need for international movement of employees and those that move can apply <lb/>for intra-corporate work permits. The second way is to maximise the amount of work that is carried out in <lb/>India, e.g. by partnering with client country companies or by bringing the client over to India for <lb/>knowledge transfers. <lb/>105. <lb/>Another increasingly common approach among the larger Indian ITS companies is to establish <lb/>development centres in countries within close proximity (near-shore) to client countries. These countries <lb/>offer higher cost environments than in India but lower cost environments than in client countries. Central <lb/>Europe, and in particular Hungary and the Czech Republic, are developing into service centres for <lb/>Continental Europe; Mexican and Canadian companies service the U.S. market, francophone African <lb/>countries are used as bases to service the French market; and development centres in China provide <lb/>services to Japan. The near-shoring centres help to overcome language and cultural barriers as well as <lb/>some of the restrictions to international movement of professionals, in particular in Europe. Data privacy <lb/>and security regulations can also be easier managed within the EU. <lb/>106. <lb/>While &quot; near-shoring &quot; may facilitate the movement of professionals to client countries, there are <lb/>often serious restrictions to movement between India and the proximate markets that the companies invest <lb/>in. Indian IT companies are generally well received and supported in the new emerging markets in which <lb/>they invest but it takes time to remove long-standing south-south restrictions which in many cases are more <lb/>stringent that those for north-south trade. These are often more challenging to overcome than those <lb/>between India and OECD markets. <lb/>Restrictions on movement of information 35 <lb/>107. <lb/>Data privacy and security concerns are related to the risk of: a) data being lost, and; b) data being <lb/>accessed by external parties or misused by the company processing the information. While IT security can <lb/>be guaranteed to some extent with technology, data privacy is people-driven and corporate procedures and <lb/>ethics are of uttermost importance. Indian companies invest in data security systems and back-up <lb/>equipment to reduce the former type of risk. <lb/>108. <lb/>Data privacy is mainly a concern for BPS companies that transfer and/or process large quantities <lb/>of personal information about other companies&apos; clients or employees. These transfers may include <lb/>sensitive data such as financial, medical, social security and purchasing histories. Regulations on data <lb/>privacy are imposed on companies located within the OECD area and these companies in turn require <lb/>companies to whom they outsource to fulfil criteria which normally go beyond legal requirements. <lb/>Improper handling of information has in the past resulted in public relations scandals for companies whose <lb/>customers or employees have been affected. Both clients that outsource work and the companies providing <lb/>the services have much to lose if there is a breach in data confidentiality. <lb/>109. <lb/>Restrictions to the movement of information are an area where many companies fear future <lb/>legislation could erect barriers to mode 1/2 trade. 36 To counteract data handling misuse, Nasscom is <lb/>working together with the Indian government to draft an Information Technology Act which will set <lb/>minimum industry requirements for data privacy and establish a penal code for companies or individuals <lb/>35 See OECD (2006b) for a more extensive overview of data security and privacy issues. <lb/></body>

			<note place="footnote">36 As a precaution against potential protectionism, more than 300 Indian BPS and ITS companies have established <lb/>subsidiaries in Singapore where they would be able to route data in case India were to be targeted with trade-<lb/>restricting legislation (Aron, 2005). <lb/></note>

			<body>breaching the rules. So far there have been few known incidents of data theft in India and by establishing <lb/>and enforcing strict data privacy standards, the industry hopes future issues will be kept to a minimum. <lb/>110. <lb/>Indian BPS and ITS companies sign non-disclosure agreements with their clients and a number of <lb/>mechanisms are established to protect data. These include dedicated offshore centres where e.g.: <lb/>• only project staff is allowed;<lb/>• the client&apos;s infrastructure and IT system are replicated;<lb/>• all types of data transfers are encrypted;<lb/>• project staff are prohibited from carrying any devices that can store information;<lb/>• project staff are prohibited from interacting with project staff working for competing clients;<lb/>• project staff are kept under video surveillance<lb/>111. <lb/>There is also a multitude of technical solutions which eliminate the need to physically transfer <lb/>data. This includes IT systems which allow offshore project staff direct online access to the data in the <lb/>client country. Operations may also be carried out on dummy data and then applied on the original data at <lb/>client site. As long as data privacy regulations hold for companies irrespective of the country in which they <lb/>are headquartered, data privacy and security regulations are not considered an issue. <lb/>112. <lb/>Indian companies have established processes to handle data privacy and security because they <lb/>were often a requirement to attract foreign clients in the first place. However, the issue of data privacy and <lb/>security is still a concern for clients. Booz Allen Hamilton (2006) recently published a survey which <lb/>showed that information security is one of the three most important factors for U.S. companies when they <lb/>select an outsourcing partner. The survey also indicated that information security concerns were related to <lb/>the lack of trust in legal and regulatory environments in developing countries. <lb/>113. <lb/>Several U.S. laws require companies to maintain reasonable technical, physical and <lb/>administrative safeguards but do not address the issue of international data transfers directly. 37 They rather <lb/> &quot; impose obligations to maintain reasonable security, access controls and the like, which must be <lb/>considered in any vendor relationship, domestic or off-shore… &quot; thus &quot; …assuming the vendor provides <lb/>appropriate security and confidentiality, U.S. laws do not now limit a company&apos;s ability to select vendors <lb/>in any other geography &quot; (Eisenhauer, 2005). The obligation for a U.S. company to comply with U.S. data <lb/>privacy and security regulation exists no matter where the engaged service provider is located. <lb/>114. <lb/>EU Directive 95/46/EC &apos;On the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of <lb/>personal data and on the free movement of such data&apos; took effect in 1998 and is a comprehensive data <lb/>protection and privacy law. It covers most sectors and allows transfers of data if a set of conditions are <lb/>fulfilled. In addition, in the banking sector in some European countries for example, there are regulations <lb/>stating that neither is the international transfer of data nor the international online access to data allowed. <lb/>In such cases, the global delivery model employed by Indian BPS companies is not workable unless they <lb/>establish operational units in the country. <lb/>115. <lb/>In conjunction with legislation, there are several types of standards and guidelines such as ISO <lb/>17799 (for best practices in information security), ISO 27001 (for information security management <lb/>systems) and COBIT (Control Objectives for Business &amp; Related Technology). Compliance with data <lb/></body>

			<body>privacy, security legislation and guidelines is necessary but comes at a cost: Pai and Basu (2005) cite a <lb/>TowerGroup study which estimates that the costs of &quot; effective international outsourcing &quot; increase by 3-5 <lb/>percent in BPS and 7-9 percent in ITS for due diligence. Risk management increase the costs by another 3-<lb/>5 percent in ITS and 8-10 percent in BPS. <lb/>THE PHILIPPINE BPS AND ITS SECTORS <lb/>116. <lb/>The Philippines has several merits for international supply of services and is the second largest <lb/>exporter of BPS and ITS among the countries studied in this paper. The labour cost arbitrage is significant, <lb/>the infrastructure in Metro Manila where most companies locate is well developed and the <lb/>telecommunications infrastructure is reliable and cost-effective. The voice-based and non-voice based BPS <lb/>sectors attract graduates that are more highly qualified than their peers in most high-income countries. The <lb/>country has historically been a protectorate of the United States and this has led to close cultural ties and a <lb/>sizeable Philippine Diaspora in the United States. Communication skills, English proficiency and the <lb/>neutral American-influenced Philippine accent are key attributes for serving U.S. clients. In addition, staff <lb/>attrition rates in the service offshoring industry are low and certain cultural factors lend themselves <lb/>particularly well to voice-based services, e.g. Philippine service workers are generally perceived to be <lb/>customer-oriented with a natural ability to convey empathy. <lb/>117. <lb/>International benchmarking exercises find the Philippines to be one of the most attractive <lb/>locations for services offshoring (see Annexes F-H). A.T. Kearney&apos;s Global Services Location Index for <lb/>2005 ranks the Philippines as the fourth most attractive country, with inexpensive labour and <lb/>infrastructure, high cultural adaptability and low staff attrition. The country does less well in terms of <lb/>maturity of the home-grown services industry, quality of education, protection of IPR and the country risk <lb/>is higher than in many comparable emerging markets. High levels of corruption, security issues in the <lb/>south of the country and political instability have a negative effect on the overall business environment. <lb/>However, neoIT ranks the Philippines second only to India in terms of &quot; offshore attractiveness &quot; in the BPS <lb/>sector and the country scores particularly well for the maturity of the local BPS sector and the availability <lb/>and quality of talent (see Annex G). In the ITS sector, the country ranks lower (11 th out of 40 countries) <lb/>and the relative weaknesses in the ITS field are the same factors that make the country strong in the BPS <lb/>field: industry maturity and the availability of talent are not as favourable as in many other comparable <lb/>countries. <lb/>Market characteristics <lb/>118. <lb/>The Philippine BPS industry has grown rapidly over the last five years and established itself as <lb/>one of the premier emerging market providers of BPS. In 2005, the Philippine customer contact industry, <lb/>which hardly existed only five years earlier, employed 112,000 workers and generated revenue of US$ 1.6 <lb/>billion (see Table 2). Revenue in the contact centre sector doubled every year between 2000 and 2004 <lb/>(Locsin, 2006). In addition to customer contact services, the Philippines exports back-office services, <lb/>software services and medical transcription services. In 2005, some 150,000 workers provided US$ 2 <lb/>billion worth of BPS mainly to foreign markets. An additional 12,000 workers provided US$ 0.2 billion <lb/></body>

Foreign client markets <lb/>for ITS are more geographically dispersed with EU, Japan and United States as main export markets. 39 For <lb/>call centres services, 87 percent of export revenue was derived from U.S. clients in Q3 2005 (Aquino, <lb/>2006). The Philippine customer contact industry is to a large extent made up of U.S.-based multinationals <lb/>that provide call centre services from captive units. But a growing number of Philippine, Asian and <lb/>European companies also use the Philippines as a base for call centre services. The country is heavily <lb/>dependent on the Metro Manila area which supplies some 80 percent of exports. The Philippine <lb/>government is working together with domestic industry associations to develop strategies to geographically <lb/>diversify the supply capacity (more on this below). <lb/>120. <lb/>Labour arbitrage aside, a main reason why a country like the Philippines is so successful at <lb/>attracting contact centre work is that the BPS sector can attract highly qualified graduates for work that in <lb/>the OECD-area is provided by low-skilled workers and characterised by low wages, low productivity and <lb/>high staff attrition. For example in the United States, the average call centre agent stay with the employer <lb/>for less than six months while in the Philippines, the average call centre agent stays for two years or more. <lb/>Companies such as eTelecare Global Solutions continuously invest in training and retention and keep their <lb/>Philippine call centre agents for much longer. Low staff attrition and high quality manpower are <lb/>compelling factors that have led the world&apos;s multinational call centre companies to invest heavily in the <lb/>country. 40 <lb/>38 This estimate is based on calculation by the OED Secretariat using data from Mapa (2006) and Aquino (2006). <lb/>39 The information was obtained at meetings with industry associations. <lb/>40 The Philippine BPS sector has penetrated as far as to the WTO in Geneva: WTO&apos;s online training modules are <lb/>checked by Philippine teachers and assistants (Mapa, 2006). <lb/></body>

			<body>121. <lb/>The Philippines is also becoming an offshore centre for finance and accounting tasks associated <lb/>with high levels of standardisation. 41 Philippine national standards and practice adhered to the U.S.-based <lb/>Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) until January 1 2005, and since then to International <lb/>Accounting Standards (IAS) (Locsin, 2006). About 100,000 students graduate every year in accounting, <lb/>finance, management and other related subjects and the country produces 2,500-3,000 new certified <lb/>accountants annually. <lb/>Box 6. International outsourcing offers new business opportunities <lb/>International outsourcing offers a growing number of feasible business opportunities due to labour cost arbitrage. <lb/>These new business opportunities are seldom acknowledged and difficult to quantify but still part of the offshoring <lb/>equation. For example, a large car manufacturer recently started to provide a GPS star positioning system for a <lb/>monthly subscription fee. A Philippine call centre was hired to initiate an outbound calling campaign to contact <lb/>new car owners with offers of the GPS deal. Old customers were also contacted and offered new services packages <lb/>and information if they did not make use of the GPS service during the first three months of their subscription. <lb/>Many companies consider outbound calling campaigns to be efficient tools to increase the life-time value of a <lb/>customer. But they are often economically unviable to initiate from high-income countries. International <lb/>outsourcing opens up a whole set of new innovative business models due to significant cost advantages. <lb/>The Role of the Philippine government in attracting foreign investment <lb/>122. <lb/>The Philippine government and the Philippine Board of Investment (BOI) agency are generally <lb/>perceived as supportive of the country&apos;s BPS and ITS sectors. The government has in the past initiated a <lb/>number of projects to reduce barriers to investment and it is currently cooperating with the industry <lb/>associations, including the Business Processing Association Philippines (BPA/P) and the Philippine <lb/>Software Industry Association (PSIA), to improve education in areas that are key to the industry and <lb/>increase industry standards in terms of data privacy and security. <lb/>123. <lb/>Some early initiatives were aimed at attracting foreign direct investment. Chief among these was <lb/>legislation allowing 100 percent ownership of BPS and ITS entities established by foreign companies in <lb/>the Philippines. Another initiative was to lower the minimum office-space requirement imposed by the <lb/>Philippine Economic Zone Authority (PEZA). PEZA was established in 1995 and initially required 25 <lb/>hectares of dedicated space to create a special economic zone (SEZ)/industrial park. In 1999, the minimum <lb/>space requirement for IT parks was reduced from 25 hectares to 15 hectares. In 2000, IT buildings <lb/>benefiting from PEZA&apos;s policy were allowed if the available office area covered a minimum of 20,000 m 2 . <lb/>According to Locsin (2006), the minimum space requirement by PEZA is now 5,000 m 2 . <lb/>124. <lb/>Companies that locate in PEZA buildings benefit from a number of financial incentives and <lb/>administrative support. The benefit packages include streamlined registration for incorporation, which has <lb/>been reduced to three working days (the average numbers of days to setup a company in the Philippines <lb/>was 48 days in 2005 – see Annex C). Companies can also enjoy 4 to 8 years of income tax holiday, <lb/>unrestricted use of consigned equipment, deductions for labour expenses and training expenses (both up to <lb/>50 percent) and exemptions from wharfage dues. IT park developers also enjoy tax and duty exemptions on <lb/>imported capital equipment and exemption from the 10-percent input VAT on allowable local purchase of <lb/>goods and services (Locsin, 2006). <lb/></body>

			<note place="footnote">41 These services include general accounting and bookkeeping services, accounts maintenance, accounts receivable <lb/>collection, invoice and accounts payable administration, claims processing, expense and revenue reporting, sales <lb/>auditing, payroll services, asset management/accounting, financial analysis and auditing, inventory control and <lb/>purchasing, and tax reporting. <lb/></note>

			<body>125. <lb/>The main priority is now to improve the quality of education. The current administration of <lb/>President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo reversed a decision by its predecessor to only promote the use of <lb/>Filipino in schools. This decision was impairing the export-oriented BPS and ITS industry for which <lb/>English proficiency is the strongest comparative advantage. The new initiatives include programmes to <lb/>enhance teachers&apos; English proficiency and communication skills and they are developing elective courses <lb/>that may cater to students interested in a career in the BPS or ITS fields. The aim is also to improve the <lb/>analytical skills of students and there are several industry-academic joint programmes to enhance the <lb/>quality of IT professionals. <lb/>126. <lb/>The BOI has commissioned two councils that in conjunction with the private sector are <lb/>developing guidelines on the protection of data privacy and security. The objectives of these projects are to <lb/>ensure minimum standards on data protection, to pre-empt accidents and counteract protectionism. The <lb/>councils are cooperating with the Information Technology Association of America (ITAA) to address <lb/>potential issues. The first council is developing voluntary guidelines for the industry to follow until the <lb/>second council has produced and passed a legal bill on data protection (expected in 2007) (see Lipana and <lb/>Cooper, 2005). <lb/>127. <lb/>Another large-scale initiative is the investment in a 600 km long telecommunications corridor. <lb/>Towns can be connected to this ICT backbone if they fulfil a number of criteria aimed at establishing a <lb/>sustainable and business-friendly environment. The project has set a target of generating one million jobs <lb/>by 2010. To achieve this goal the government estimates that it will need investment of US$ 6-7 billion to <lb/>upgrade the infrastructure. There are several objectives related to this geographic diversification. First, <lb/>more regions in the Philippines will get access to the business opportunities of international sourcing and <lb/>this should result in more even economic development. Second, it will limit future salary inflation and <lb/>poaching of staff frequent in the Metro Manila area; and third, the ICT backbone will increase access to the <lb/>labour pool in the country. <lb/>128. <lb/>Some critics argue that the Philippine government should refrain from favouring one industry <lb/>over another and rather focus its resources on improving the overall business climate in the Philippines. <lb/>The BPS and ITS sectors are already some of the least affected by the regulatory and institutional <lb/>inefficiencies prevalent in the country – see Annex C – and the high levels of corruption that is plaguing <lb/>domestic business is not a big issue to export-oriented BPS and ITS companies. While some observers <lb/>argue that the current incentive packages fail to benefit the many small domestic companies that can ill <lb/>afford to locate in PEZA buildings, where rents are high, others (e.g. Beshouri and Farrell, 2005) argue that <lb/>the Philippines would do best by investing its resources in improving infrastructure and education rather <lb/>that offering tax breaks to multinationals. The same argument would hold for China and India. <lb/>129. <lb/>In general, the environment in which the industry operates is generally perceived as conducive to <lb/>do business and the action taken by the Philippine government to reduce investment barriers and <lb/>administrative red tape has helped the industry flourish. <lb/></body>

			<body>Box 7. SPi – a home-grown success story <lb/>Founded in the Philippines in 1980 and the first publicly listed Philippine IT company, SPi (previously SPI <lb/>Technologies) is arguably the Philippines&apos; most successful home-grown BPS company. Its 11,000 employees – <lb/>4,500 in voice-based BPS and 6,500 in non-voice based BPS – in Asia, United States and Europe provide a broad <lb/>portfolio of business process solutions related to content and data requirements in the publishing, legal, healthcare, <lb/>content management, and transaction processing industries. SPi&apos;s main services offerings cover digital content <lb/>conversion (transferring data from paper to electronic databases), litigation support, journal and book production <lb/>(typesetting, copy-editing, illustration scanning and page formatting services), medical transcription, call centre <lb/>(including inbound, outbound, sales and customer care applications) and software maintenance and development. <lb/>SPi has established a 1,000 strong workforce in Coimbatore, Pondicherry, Kolkata, New Delhi and Chennai in <lb/>India and plans to continue to expand its Indian presence: e.g. it recently acquired Indian KGISTL&apos;s medical <lb/>transcription unit serving the U.S. healthcare industry. The company also has services centres in Vietnam and <lb/>China and in April 2005, the company announced plans to invest US$ 50 million to extend its services capabilities <lb/>in the Philippines and the United States. Geographic differentiation is a significant advantage since work can be <lb/>located to where it makes most financial sense. For example in the past SPi had a 1,500 strong workforce in the <lb/>Philippines doing basic data entry work. Today virtually all those functions have migrated to places like Vietnam <lb/>and China. <lb/>Most Philippine BPS companies are sub-contractors to U.S.-based companies and lack sales and marketing <lb/>organisations in client countries. SPi has established its own sales and marketing channels in the United States and <lb/>it has been particularly successful at building in-house capabilities which has made the company less sensitive to <lb/>external price pressure. Compared to many other Philippine third party BPS providers, SPi has gotten the business <lb/>model right and developed a mature, quality conscious organisation with high visibility abroad. <lb/>Source: Huang (2005) and www.spitech.com. <lb/>Challenges to the Philippine BPS and ITS sectors in supplying international markets <lb/>130. <lb/>The Philippine BPS and ITS sectors are dominated by captive units, or cost-covering <lb/>subsidiaries, of foreign multinationals. The BPS sector is young but has already developed into a US$ 2 <lb/>billion industry and a destination of choice for voice-based BPS to English-speaking markets. Some home-<lb/>grown companies – like SPi and eTelecare Global Solutions – have grown into internationally recognised <lb/>multinationals in the BPS field. The ITS sector was founded in the 1980s and has yet to develop any <lb/>significant export capabilities. As in the Czech Republic, the Philippine ITS sector could potentially <lb/>develop expertise in certain niche markets but is not likely to become a sizeable provider to foreign <lb/>markets in the foreseeable future. <lb/>131. <lb/>Arguably the main reason why the BPS sector has thrived – next to the comparative advantages <lb/>mentioned above – is the relative ease with which Philippine companies can supply services to the United <lb/>States. The Philippine government has provided incentives and facilitated market entry but refrained from <lb/>interfering in the industry. Most home-grown BPS and ITS companies belong to the SME category and <lb/>face challenges unrelated to domestic or foreign regulations. The challenges are rather related to <lb/>recruitment and retention of staff, developing mature and sustainable business models, and convincing <lb/>foreign clients that the risks of political instability is unlikely to affect business. Country risk has a <lb/>negative impact on business and political stability and sustained order are paramount to the BPS sector, <lb/>which provides real-time services all year round. <lb/>132. <lb/>It is only during the last few years that the BPS and ITS sectors have orchestrated an effort to <lb/>market themselves abroad. The foreign multinationals that make up much of the sector have no incentives <lb/>to sell the Philippines as a location for outsourced BPS and ITS. However, the establishment of the <lb/>umbrella organisation BPA/P, which covers six other industry-specific associations, and its cooperation <lb/></body>

			<page>40 <lb/></page>

			<body>with the BOI under the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) is already raising the industry&apos;s visibility. <lb/>This is necessary since few Philippine companies have sales and marketing channels abroad: most <lb/>companies work with foreign partners working on commission, which is seldom a viable business model. <lb/>Supply-side constraints <lb/>Recruitment and retention <lb/>133. <lb/>The BPS and ITS sectors are people-driven. As such, the hunt for the best available talent is <lb/>constantly top priority for companies and the main challenge in daily work. According to BPA/P, a <lb/>shortage of suitable labour is the single most pressing issue facing the Philippine BPS and ITS sectors. The <lb/>country produces some 70,000 graduates annually with computer-related degrees but only 12,000 <lb/>professionals in total worked in the export-oriented ITS sector in 2005 (Locsin, 2006). One reason why the <lb/>ITS industry has failed to take off is the relatively modest quality of Philippine students in mathematics <lb/>and science (Rodolfo, 2005). Several IT companies believe the Philippine government needs to set <lb/>minimum quality standards in higher technical education. There is otherwise a risk that students who invest <lb/>in IT-related education will face unemployment or be underemployed in adjacent low-value sectors. <lb/>134. <lb/>Another reason why the ITS sector has struggled is that many software professionals with 4-5 <lb/>years of work experience leave the Philippines to work abroad and few tend to return. This limits the <lb/>domestic supply of professionals with high-level technical expertise and managerial competence. The <lb/>relative youth of the industry has also led to a scarcity of experienced managers with sector-specific <lb/>expertise. The captive units of foreign multinationals are best situated to capture the domain expertise and <lb/>middle management talent that stay in the Philippines. While barriers to enter the ITS market are relatively <lb/>low, the actual costs and expertise required to serve foreign markets are high. <lb/>135. <lb/>The quality certifications (e.g. ISO, SEI CMM and SEI CMMi) that ITS companies can obtain to <lb/>improve the quality and maturity of their work and use to market their quality services work both for and <lb/>against the Philippine ITS sector. Today, large clients normally demand these types of certification to <lb/>evaluate a company&apos;s process maturity. However, these quality certificates are costly and time-consuming <lb/>to obtain and most Philippine companies have ignored this important marketing tool. The situation is <lb/>similar to the one in the Czech industry. Some executives note that as the market for internationally <lb/>outsourced ITS matures, entry barriers pile up in the form of more stringent data privacy and security <lb/>requirements, and higher demand for process quality certification, scalability and investment in training, <lb/>etc. But these entry barriers are industry-imposed and a result of increasing international competition. <lb/>136. <lb/>The supply-side constraints in the expanding BPS sector have led to strong salary inflation for <lb/>call centre workers. Philippine customer contact centres target a thin slice of available talent since most <lb/>graduates are unsuited for customer interaction requiring a high-level of language proficiency and <lb/>communication skills. As a result, the starting salary for a call centre worker is higher than the starting <lb/>salary for a medical doctor, accountant or software programmer. In 2005, the base salary for English <lb/>speaking call centre workers was 14-16,000 pesos/month with additional supplements for night-shift and <lb/>performance-based bonuses. Contact centre workers with a second language like Japanese or Spanish can <lb/>obtain twice the base salary of an English-speaking call centre worker. One industry executive provided <lb/>the following estimates for young professionals&apos; monthly starting salaries: <lb/>• Software developer in domestic industry: 12,000 pesos;<lb/>• Software developer in foreign multinational: 18,000 pesos;<lb/>• English-speaking call centre agent: 14-16,000 pesos + performance-based bonus;<lb/>• Japanese or Spanish-speaking call centre agent: 20-25,000 pesos + performance-based bonus<lb/></body>

			<page>41 <lb/></page>

			<body>137. <lb/>The salary inflation has made contact centre work an attractive first job for many graduates: or, to <lb/>cite an executive with many years of experience in both the Indian and Philippine call centre sector: &quot; …the <lb/>call centre job is today a low-level yuppie kind of thing in Asia. It&apos;s a good job to take home 20,000 <lb/>pesos/month, it is impressive. &quot; A base salary of 15,000 pesos is just below US$ 300 and with added <lb/>incentive programmes, rights allowance and a 13 th month of salary in December, the total pay is high <lb/>compared to other professions. But the rapid growth of the industry is creating recruitment problems. Five <lb/>years ago, to recruit one qualified BPS worker, a Philippine company needed to screen around 25-30 <lb/>people. To recruit a person today, the same company may need to interview 60-80 applicants. A common <lb/>worry is that limited English proficiency will restrict the industry&apos;s growth potential and increase <lb/>investments in screening and training. In a survey conducted by O2P and BPA/P (2006), enhancing <lb/>English proficiency is the area, after improving the political situation and the country&apos;s external image, <lb/>where the Philippine government can aid the industry most. 42 <lb/>138. <lb/>SMEs face the toughest challenges. Many of the small BPS companies suffer from irregular <lb/>revenue flows and rely on workers with short-term project-based contracts. This approach may be one of <lb/>the few viable ways to tackle a volatile business environment and Philippine labour laws become stringent <lb/>when a worker has been employed for more than six months. But short-term employment does not only <lb/>raise job uncertainty and staff attrition, it also reduces the incentives for companies to invest in their <lb/>employees and develop in-house expertise. The issue is aggravated since it takes considerable time to reach <lb/>adequate productivity levels that are needed to cultivate long-term business relations. <lb/>139. <lb/>The export-oriented software sector is small and relatively immature but growth may pick up if <lb/>the government manages to improve teaching and upgrade the technical curriculum in schools. The private <lb/>sector has started to assist in enhancing the skills of IT graduates by providing teaching material and <lb/>training teachers. BPA/P is also lobbying the government to increase the communication and language <lb/>proficiency of students and teachers. <lb/>Regulatory challenges <lb/>140. <lb/>While there is much room to improve the domestic business environment, the BPS and ITS <lb/>sectors are better off than most other industries in the Philippines. The World Bank&apos;s doing business <lb/>indicators (see Annex C) show the inefficient process of starting and closing businesses, the slow process <lb/>of enforcing contracts and the weak protection of investors. However, the special policy that covers <lb/>companies operating in PEZA-certified buildings help companies circumvent most challenges related to <lb/>domestic regulations. The BPS and ITS sectors also face few challenges related to foreign regulations. In <lb/>the past, new U.S. regulations have even given rise to entire new services industries (see Box 8). The few <lb/>regulatory challenges that still exist are related to restrictions to movement of service workers and security <lb/>of information. <lb/></body>

			<body>Box 8. The Philippine medical transcription sector <lb/>The medical transcription sector in the Philippines is young, relatively small and the fastest growing <lb/>business line in the Philippine BPS sector. It employed some 5,500 people in 2005 and many are <lb/>working from home in family businesses. The sector was created following the enactment in the U.S. <lb/>Congress in 1996 of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). This Act <lb/>requires medical institutions to keep digital records of patients. It also requires the establishment of <lb/>national standards for electronic health care transactions and its provisions address the security and <lb/>privacy of health data. The hospitals and health clinics that outsource some of their business processes <lb/>to a third party must ensure that the service provider has a framework in place to comply with HIPAA <lb/>requirements. <lb/>The establishment of the medical transcription industry in the Philippine can be dated to year 2000 when <lb/>an American company established a captive unit to provide transcription services. At its peak, the <lb/>company employed 700 people but it was soon acquired by another U.S. company which decided to <lb/>move all its activities to India. Facing unemployment, some of the workers started their own businesses <lb/>to serve the U.S. market and these companies now make up most of the Philippine medical transcription <lb/>sector. <lb/>Approximately 90 percent of the U.S. market for transcription services is captured by domestic <lb/>companies but the U.S. labour pool has shrunk annually by a few percent. The job is low-paid and few <lb/>consider it a real career in the United States. International sourcing has proven an attractive solution to <lb/>American health clinics and India has captured approximately 10 percent of the U.S. market. The <lb/>Philippine medical transcription industry currently has less than 1 percent of the U.S. market. <lb/>Medical transcription companies operate 24/7 whereas call centres operate mostly during night. <lb/>Typically a company receives an audio record with dictation and a short note about a patient. It then <lb/>transcribes and puts together a report including analysis within hours before sending it back to the client. <lb/>Hospitals get the reports within 6-12 hours. There are two main concerns: labour supply and compliance <lb/>with HIPAA data privacy and security requirements. The Medical Transcription Industry Association of <lb/>the Philippines is currently working on establishing HIPAA compliance certification for the local <lb/>industry to enhance transparency and standards. <lb/>Source: Bel Reyes of the Medical Transcription Industry Association of the Philippines (MTIAPI). <lb/>Restrictions on temporary movement of service professionals <lb/>141. <lb/>The Philippine BPS and ITS sectors are mainly made up of foreign multinationals and these <lb/>companies circulate few professionals between the Philippines and their home or client countries. Those <lb/>professionals that are employed by foreign multinationals have few restrictions to movement since <lb/>employees can obtain intra-corporate work permits. In addition, most service workers are employed in the <lb/>contact centre sector, which seldom circulates its employees. However, the challenges related to the <lb/>movement of natural persons are more prevalent among some of the home-grown, export-oriented ITS <lb/>companies. While these are few at present, those who face restrictions are subject to the same challenges as <lb/>the Indian software professionals: quota limitations, documentation burden, and time and unpredictability <lb/>issues related to the application process of business visas and work permits. <lb/>142. <lb/>Most Philippine ITS companies have adopted a business model that is different from most Indian <lb/>companies. Philippine companies usually partner with companies in client countries that do sales and <lb/>marketing and take care of the onsite work component. Other companies choose to bring their clients to the <lb/>Philippines to minimise costs and reduce some of the hassle with visas and work permits. While some <lb/>companies report that they do turn down occasional business opportunities because of the lead time to <lb/>obtain visas and work permits, concerns related to the limited size of Philippine companies are more <lb/>frequently raised. <lb/></body>

			<body>143. <lb/>Several Indian BPS and ITS companies have negotiated with the Philippine authorities about <lb/>establishing development centres in the Philippines and some of the larger players have established <lb/>subsidiaries in Manila. There is a constraint, however, to Indian FDI because Indian citizens are <lb/>categorised as a &quot; restricted nationality &quot; by Philippine law. This regulation provides a very small quota for <lb/>the number of Indians allowed to visit the Philippines each year. Restrictions to South-South trade are <lb/>often significant but tend to receive scant attention. Several nationalities are restricted from entering the <lb/>Philippines under this policy. <lb/>Restrictions on movement of information <lb/>144. <lb/>The regulations related to data privacy and security that affect the Philippine BPS and ITS sectors <lb/>are the same as those affecting their Indian colleagues (and presented above). But the Philippine companies <lb/>are more dependent on the U.S. market. Regulations do not only result in overhead costs but can also <lb/>provide significant business opportunities: e.g. the HIPAA law in the United States requires medical <lb/>institutions to keep digital records of patients and this regulation initiated the medical transcription industry <lb/>which is quickly expanding in India and the Philippines. <lb/>145. <lb/>The Philippine companies interviewed for this study report that data privacy and security <lb/>legislation has produced some useful industry standards: they may be costly to comply with but that is not <lb/>an issue since they affect companies equally.

			<body>MAIN FINDINGS AND CONCLUDING REMARKS <lb/>Market characteristics and trade <lb/>146. <lb/>The country case studies of the BPS and ITS sectors in China, the Czech Republic, India and the <lb/>Philippines illustrated how emerging markets are being integrated in the global services supply chains in <lb/>OECD economies. In 2005, the combined export revenue of the four countries came to an estimated US$ <lb/>8.7 billion for BPS and US$ 14.5 billion for ITS. OECD economies captured most of these exports. 43 The <lb/>amounts may seem modest compared to the four countries combined exports of merchandise trade (US$ <lb/>948 billion) but the economic contribution of the BPS and ITS sectors in India and the Philippines has <lb/>increased significantly. <lb/>147. <lb/>India is leading the way among the emerging markets with its mature and internationally <lb/>competitive ITS sector. The Indian ITS sector has managed to create a highly successful industry based on <lb/>the global delivery model that has been continuously enhanced over the last decade. It has substantial <lb/>exports to both North America and Europe but depends heavily on Anglophone markets. There are signs <lb/>that China is becoming the offshore destination of choice for Japanese companies. However, it remains to <lb/>be seen whether any emerging economy can come close to rival India in size in the future. <lb/>148. <lb/>The market for internationally sourced BPS is young, fast growing and competition is more even <lb/>between the four countries. India is the largest supplier but the Philippines has become a strong contender <lb/>for services in English, in particular for voice-based services. All four countries are likely to continue to <lb/>expand their export-oriented BPS sectors in the near future. Some trend-setting multinationals already use <lb/>all four countries to deliver BPS to different geographies where they have a comparative advantage. <lb/>149. <lb/>The following conclusions can be drawn from the country case studies: <lb/>&quot; The BPS and ITS sectors in the four countries have different client focus: while only 10-15 percent <lb/>of BPS and ITS supply is exported in China and the Czech Republic, almost 80 percent of Indian <lb/>and Philippine BPS and ITS are delivered to clients abroad. <lb/>&quot; Language and cultural proximity are decisive factors in international supply of BPS and ITS. From <lb/>a trade perspective, the Chinese and Czech BPS and ITS sectors are mainly used as nearshore <lb/>supply centres for companies in East Asia and Europe respectively. The Indian and Philippine BPS <lb/>and ITS sectors are both offshore supply centres for more distant markets. <lb/>o Czech export markets are based in the EU, including the UK and neighbouring Austria, <lb/>Germany and Slovakia; <lb/>o Chinese exports are to a large extent captured by Japan (around two-thirds of total). Other <lb/>export markets include Korea, the United States and the Asia-Pacific region; <lb/></body>

			<body>o Indian export markets are predominantly the United States (66 percent) and UK (14 <lb/>percent). Other export markets include Japan, Singapore and Germany; <lb/>o Philippine exports are captured by the United States (90 percent). Other English-speaking <lb/>countries make up much of the rest; <lb/>&quot; Trade in BPS and ITS is dominated by OECD-based multinationals but home-grown companies in <lb/>non-OECD economies are rising in prominence: <lb/>o Czech BPS and ITS exports are mostly provided by foreign multinationals; <lb/>o Philippine BPS and ITS exports are mainly provided by foreign multinationals. Home-<lb/>grown companies are increasingly providing BPS and ITS services to foreign markets; <lb/>o Chinese BPS and ITS exports are provided by both home-grown and foreign companies; <lb/>o Indian BPS exports are provided equally by home-grown and foreign companies while <lb/>home-grown companies provide two-thirds of Indian ITS exports; <lb/>&quot; The four countries have developed different export-related capabilities in the BPS and ITS field: <lb/>o The Czech Republic is mainly used as a centre for BPS and software application <lb/>development; <lb/>o China has developed capabilities at the opposite ends of the value chain: it is strong at low-<lb/>end BPS and ITS work, such as data entry and testing services, while foreign <lb/>multinationals increasingly use it as a base for high-end R&amp;D services; <lb/>o India is dominating the BPS field and pushing the boundaries for the type of services that <lb/>can be traded through cross-border supply. From an offshoring point of view, it is a full <lb/>service provider. In the ITS field, India is strong at software application development and <lb/>application maintenance services. It is in the nascent stages of developing strengths in <lb/>system integration and IT consulting; <lb/>o The Philippines is presently strong in BPS supply and in particular voice-based services. <lb/>Trade-related and business-related challenges <lb/>150. <lb/>The most pressing challenges in the export-oriented BPS and ITS sectors relate to preoccupations <lb/>such as developing efficient operations, managing complexity in international client relationships, <lb/>establishing marketing and sales channels abroad, etc. The industry is facing relatively few barriers related <lb/>to regulations at home and in client countries. However, recruiting, training and retaining professionals are <lb/>major challenges in the industry. BPS and ITS companies can generally overcome the administrative <lb/>hurdles in local business environments thanks to special export-oriented zones where excessive red tape is <lb/>removed and gaps in infrastructure are bridged. Yet heavy investment in such zones would be unnecessary <lb/>if governments took action to improve the overall business environment and liberalised markets for key <lb/>input services. Additional challenges relate to temporary movement of service workers in the ITS sector <lb/>and data regulations in the BPS sector. <lb/>Recruitment and retention <lb/>&quot; The four countries face considerable supply side constraints in their quest to provide BPS and ITS <lb/>to international markets. The supply side constraints are most challenging in the ITS sector. The <lb/>issue is less severe for foreign multinationals that pay a wage premium to recruit top talent. Work <lb/>in the four countries&apos; BPS and ITS sectors attract highly skilled workers. This is in sharp contrast <lb/></body>

			<body>to some of the BPS work in OECD countries, in particular in the voice-based field, where work is <lb/>poorly paid and attrition high. <lb/>o Recruitment and retention of junior personnel: although China, India and the Philippines <lb/>produce large numbers of university graduates, few are suited to work in the industry and <lb/>serve foreign clients. Most graduates have inadequate language skills, communication <lb/>skills and business acumen for client interaction, and lack the necessary level of technical <lb/>training. Yet the levels of remuneration entice many university students and graduates to <lb/>look for opportunities in the industry. It takes significant investment in the recruitment <lb/>process to identify the right workers. In the ITS sector, it also takes significant investment <lb/>in training. Hence, staff retention is crucial given that new professionals become <lb/>productive with experience. Staff attrition is high in the BPS sector and for many <lb/>companies in the ITS sector as well. <lb/>o Recruitment and retention of senior personnel: the export-oriented BPS and ITS sectors <lb/>have existed only for a few years in China, the Czech Republic and the Philippines. The <lb/>industry has had little time to nurture project managers and senior managers with industry-<lb/>specific experience. Those that are available work to a large extent for foreign <lb/>multinationals. As a result, many companies recruit senior personnel from abroad and this <lb/>practise comes at a high cost. The situation is extra challenging in China where the <lb/>industry to a large extent relies on the returning Chinese Diaspora. The situation is less of a <lb/>problem in India where the industry has had more time to build capacity. Strong demand <lb/>has resulted in rapid salary inflation for experienced professionals. <lb/>Regulatory challenges <lb/>&quot; Regulatory and administrative challenges in the domestic business environments of the studied <lb/>countries are considerable except in the Czech Republic. The challenges affect both home-grown <lb/>and foreign companies that operate in China, India and the Philippines. While domestic service <lb/>markets are highly protected in the three Asian countries, the development of a strong domestic <lb/>export-oriented industry is high on the agenda of governments. The negative effect of the local <lb/>business environment on export-oriented BPS and ITS companies is greatly reduced in the <lb/>environments that they operate: the software and technology parks/buildings that host the <lb/>companies generally offer ready-to-use infrastructure in terms of office space, utility services and <lb/>ICT services; streamlined business administration and financial incentives. Policies that target the <lb/>investment climate in specific industries may be unfair to other industries in the economy. But <lb/>their impact on the local BPS and ITS sectors studied in this paper has been positive. <lb/>&quot; In the ITS sector, temporary movement of personnel between home country and client country can <lb/>pose significant challenges in the business of international outsourcing. The issue is most pertinent <lb/>for the Indian ITS sector which to a large extent is dependent on a global delivery model that sends <lb/>professionals for longer visits to client premises. Unpredictable, slow and costly administrative <lb/>procedures for business visas and work permits, and quota limitations for work permits have <lb/>become serious issues for some companies. <lb/>&quot; In the BPS sector, and to a lesser extent in the ITS sector, certain data privacy and security <lb/>legislation can have a negative effect on international outsourcing. New regulations have also <lb/>created entirely new business opportunities, as seen in the medical transcription sector. Data <lb/>privacy and security regulations are not necessarily regarded as negative as long as they are non-<lb/>discriminatory in nature. Technological solutions allow companies in most instances to comply <lb/>with the rules and clients generally require their suppliers to live up to standards that are higher <lb/>than existing legislation. <lb/></body>

			<body>Additional thoughts <lb/>In the future, more and more BPS and ITS multinationals will do business where they do it best and where <lb/>it makes most financial sense. This is likely to imply, among other things, that: <lb/>o The very great majority of service workers in the BPS and ITS sectors will continue to be based <lb/>within close proximity of their clients; <lb/>o The supply of BPS and ITS will have a more international footprint: <lb/>• OECD-based multinationals will boost their presence in emerging markets, which will <lb/>allow them to tap into rapidly growing domestic markets for outsourced services and gain <lb/>access to a global talent pool. International outsourcing will with time give rise to entire <lb/>new service sectors due to the multitude of business models that become economically <lb/>viable;<lb/>• Leading BPS and ITS companies in emerging markets will move into OECD markets to <lb/>establish local supply capacity when the limited markets for more easily &quot; offshoreable &quot; <lb/>services get saturated. As a result, more and more workers in OECD countries will work <lb/>for companies originating in non-OECD countries;<lb/>o Intensified competition for traded services will allow more companies to increase productivity <lb/>through the procurement of better and cheaper services -which in turn will help stimulate growth <lb/>in IT-intensive industries; <lb/>o The increasing integration of emerging markets in international supply chains will stimulate <lb/>economic growth in these countries and endow them with home-grown IT expertise necessary to <lb/>help bridge some of the productivity gaps with OECD markets; <lb/>o South-south trade is just starting to take off in the BPS and ITS sectors and will expand rapidly in <lb/>the future. <lb/>International sourcing of ITS and some potential implications for labour markets <lb/>151. <lb/>OECD (2005a) has previously identified the main adjustment challenges that OECD economies <lb/>may face due to the integration of non-OECD economies in international supply chains. In particular it <lb/>examined the prospective effect on EU and U.S. labour markets and concluded that the practice of <lb/>international sourcing can be mutually beneficial for low-income and high-income countries alike but open <lb/>markets are essential to reap the gains and to manage adjustment. Of equal importance is a well <lb/>functioning labour market that facilitates labour adjustment resulting from trade liberalisation and rapid <lb/>technology diffusion. <lb/>152. <lb/>While trade in BPS and ITS is predominantly conducted between OECD countries, these services <lb/>are increasingly traded between OECD and non-OECD countries. 47 Depending on overall growth in the <lb/>service sectors in question, international sourcing could potentially result in a net job loss for some <lb/>occupations or a slower pace of job expansion than would otherwise occur. OECD (2005a) concluded that <lb/>adjustment pressure while real is likely to remain modest in OECD labour markets. There are several <lb/>reasons for this: <lb/></body>

			<body>1. Most BPS and ITS services will remain non-tradable since their provision requires face-to-face <lb/>interaction, frequent communication or proximity to clients. <lb/>2. The various predictions of job losses resulting from international sourcing are minor in relation to <lb/>the overall destruction and creation of jobs in labour markets. <lb/>3. International sourcing is a positive sum situation: many jobs are kept and created during the <lb/>international sourcing process while efficiency gains are transferred to consumers in terms of lower <lb/>prices or re-invested in new business opportunities. <lb/>4. The labour-cost arbitrage incentive is becoming less pronounced as low-income country service <lb/>providers export increasingly sophisticated services at higher prices. <lb/>153. <lb/>Much analytical work has been presented on the impact of offshoring in the BPS and ITS sectors <lb/>in OECD economies. Some studies have tried to estimate the outer limits of total service jobs that could <lb/>potentially face international competition. 48 These estimates indicate that the great majority of service jobs <lb/>will remain unaffected by international competition. Depending on the assumptions on which the <lb/>assessments rely, estimates have varied between 5 percent and 19 percent. However, what can possibly be <lb/>supplied from a remote location is very different from what can be supplied with adequate service quality <lb/>and with an economically compelling business model. Some services (or fragments of services) that can <lb/>easily be identified, digitised and standardised may be traded in the future. But most work tasks do not <lb/>match such a profile and it makes remote cross-border supply more complex, and hence more costly, to <lb/>manage. <lb/>154. <lb/>Some studies have tried to predict the number of jobs that is likely to be provided through cross-<lb/>border supply in the future. 49 Other studies have tried to quantify the economic impact of international <lb/>sourcing on a country level. 50 These quantification exercises have generally concluded that the initial <lb/>worries that offshoring of services will have serious consequences for OECD labour markets are largely <lb/>unfounded. 51 Emerging markets will increase their share of world trade in BPS and ITS and the economic <lb/>gains, on balance, can be significant in both importing and exporting countries. Many developing countries <lb/>have realised the new business opportunities that this type of trade give rise to and some are pursuing a <lb/>more active agenda of liberalising service markets. However, while international trade in BPS and ITS can <lb/>bring significant gains to both sides of the transaction, it is likely to reduce the demand for certain job <lb/>categories in OECD economies. <lb/>The scope for labour market adjustment in the ITS sector 52 <lb/>155. <lb/>Some of the most pressing issues for BPS and ITS companies that operate in emerging markets <lb/>are related to supply-side constraints. The McKinsey Global Institute has presented a series of <lb/>comprehensive studies that examine the supply and demand for labour in a number of service sectors <lb/>(MGI, 2005a-b). They forecast that the annual growth rate for ITS spending in the 2003-2008 period will <lb/>48 See e.g. Blinder (2005), van Welsum and Vickery (2005), Bardhan and Kroll (2003), ILO (2001) and World Bank <lb/>(1995). See also the discussion presented by Bhagwati et al. (2004). <lb/>49 See Engman (2005) for an overview. MGI (2005c) <lb/>50 See e.g. Blanco et al. (2005), Mann (2003), MGI (2003, 2004), Evalueserve (2003, 2004), Deloitte Research <lb/>(2003). <lb/>51 See e.g. WTO (2005), OECD (2005a), Bhagwati et al. (2004), Drezner (2004). <lb/>52 In 2005, ITS exports in China, the Czech Republic, India and the Philippines made up 60 percent of combined BPS <lb/>and ITS exports. <lb/></body>

			<body>be 4 percent in Western Europe, 5 percent in the United States, and 9 percent in the Asia Pacific region. 53 <lb/>The figures imply that the combined demand for ITS in the main markets for these services will grow by <lb/>some US$ 20 billion annually. This is significantly more than the combined value of all ITS exports from <lb/>China, the Czech Republic, India and the Philippines. <lb/>156. <lb/>Competition from emerging markets is almost exclusively concentrated in the field of custom <lb/>application development and application maintenance, and to a lesser extent in system integration. In 2006, <lb/>an estimated 10 percent of demand for ITS employment in high-income countries was covered by low-cost <lb/>countries. This share is expected to increase in the future but due to the expected rise in demand for ITS, <lb/>annual ITS employment in high-income countries is expected to grow by 1 percent per year between 2003 <lb/>and 2008. <lb/>157. <lb/>While the pressure on overall ITS employment is likely to be modest, there may well be cost <lb/>pressure for certain types of services, and shifts in demand for ITS job occupations, as OECD-based <lb/>companies refocus their operations on higher value services. 54 In the United States, which is the largest <lb/>importer of BPS and ITS from emerging markets, the share of high-value ITS occupations (system <lb/>analysts, software engineers) have expanded while mid-value (software programmers, database/network <lb/>administrators) and low-value ITS occupations (computer support specialists, programmer aides) have <lb/>contracted (MGI, 2005a-b). This trend is in line with the growth in offshoring of low-value work to cost-<lb/>effective countries in Asia. <lb/>158. <lb/>The recruitment challenges in China, India and the Philippines stem from the fact that relatively <lb/>few graduates have the set of skills to work for foreign multinationals or serve international markets. <lb/>Figure 5, which is based on interviews with 83 human resource managers of multinationals, reveals that <lb/>only one in ten Chinese engineers have the necessary profile for employment. A somewhat higher share of <lb/>engineers is suitable for work in multinationals in India and the Philippines and more so in the Czech <lb/>Republic. Both the Czech Republic and the Philippines have rather strong competence in finance and <lb/>accounting. Figure 6 illustrates that the limited profiles of young professionals in China and India <lb/>drastically reduce the available talent pools. Hence the large populations of countries like China and India <lb/>do not commensurate with the number of service professionals that they can provide. Quantity is not the <lb/>problem in these countries – quality is. <lb/></body>

			<note place="footnote">53 According to their findings, the United States accounted for roughly 41 percent of worldwide demand of ITS, <lb/>followed by 13 percent in Japan and 7 percent in Germany. Employment in the ITS sector accounted for 1.2 percent <lb/>of non-agricultural employment in Western Europe, 1.3 percent in the United States, and 0.9 percent in Japan. <lb/>54 Many OECD countries do not import BPS and ITS from the countries studied in this paper. <lb/></note>
