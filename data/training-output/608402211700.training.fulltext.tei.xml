			<head>SUMMARY<lb/> 1</head>

			<p>.<lb/> The delivery of an appropriate quantity and quality of health care in an efficient way requires,<lb/> among other things, matching the supply with the demand for the services of physicians, over time. Such<lb/> matching has led to very different levels of physicians per million population across OECD countries –<lb/> because of variations, among other things, in: morbidity and mortality, health expenditure as a share of<lb/> GDP and the design of health systems. In addition, there are signs that a higher density of physicians is<lb/> found in countries which have left the supply of physicians mainly to the market whereas lower density is<lb/> found in countries which have planned the intake to medical schools centrally over many years.<lb/> 2.<lb/> Shortages of physicians have now appeared in a number of OECD countries. It seems likely that<lb/> these shortages could worsen in some countries over the next two decades, as a result of rising demand for,<lb/> and falling supply of, physicians, unless countermeasures are taken quickly. The countermeasures may<lb/> involve recruiting into medicine a higher proportion of dwindling cohorts of young people which is likely,<lb/> in turn, to require raising the relative pay of physicians and/or improving their conditions of service.<lb/></p>

			<p>3.<lb/> Countries have at their disposal a variety of additional policy instruments to influence the supply<lb/> of physicians including education and training policies, migration policies and policies affecting retention<lb/> and retirement.<lb/> 4.<lb/> A number of countries are now raising their intake to medical schools, or discussing raising it.<lb/> 5.<lb/> Immigration of doctors can ease physician shortages in countries where numbers are lacking but<lb/> it raises difficult questions about international equity when there are net, long-term flows of physicians<lb/> from poorer countries with low average health status to richer countries with high health status. As a result,<lb/> many OECD countries aim for self-sufficiency in physician supply.<lb/> 6.<lb/> Against expectations of a wave of retirement of physicians in many OECD countries, several<lb/> countries are trying to tempt physicians into delaying their retirement by making retirement arrangements<lb/> more flexible and staying longer in practice more rewarding, financially.<lb/> 7.<lb/> Most OECD countries experience inequities in the geographical distribution of their physician<lb/> workforce. To tackle this difficulty, a mix of educational policies, regulatory policies and financial policies<lb/> has been used with some success in a number of countries.<lb/> 8.<lb/> Against increasing trends towards specialisation, some countries are trying to raise the relative<lb/> attractiveness of careers in primary care. There is some evidence to suggest that giving students experience<lb/> of primary care practice and appointing primary-care role models to academic positions, can influence<lb/> students&apos; choices towards a career in primary care.<lb/> 9.<lb/> The services delivered by physicians depend on their productivity as well as on their numbers.<lb/></p>

			<p>There is good evidence that activity-related methods of payment will raise the activity rates of physicians,<lb/> but this is also likely to raise costs and little is known about the effect that raised activity has on quality of<lb/> care. There is growing interest in devising payment systems for physicians which reward the quality of<lb/> care directly – where that is feasible.<lb/></p>

			<figure>10.<lb/> Pour qu&apos;un système de santé puisse assurer de façon efficace un niveau de soins satisfaisant, en<lb/> quantité comme en qualité, il faut, entre autres choses, que l&apos;offre et la demande de médecins parviennent à<lb/> s&apos;équilibrer. De ce point de vue, et si l&apos;on en juge d&apos;après le nombre de médecins par million d&apos;habitants, les<lb/> pays de l&apos;OCDE affichent une grande diversité, pour des raisons qui tiennent notamment à des différences<lb/> dans les taux de morbidité et de mortalité, les dépenses de santé en proportion du PIB et la conception des<lb/> systèmes de santé. En outre, il semble que la densité médicale soit plus élevée dans les pays qui ont pour<lb/> l&apos;essentiel laissé au marché le soin de réguler l&apos;offre de médecins, et moins élevée dans ceux où l&apos;accès aux<lb/> études de médecine a longtemps été encadré à l&apos;échelon national.<lb/> 11.<lb/> Un certain nombre de pays de l&apos;OCDE connaissent d&apos;ores et déjà des pénuries de médecins et si<lb/> l&apos;on extrapole les tendances récentes (à partir de données un peu incertaines), il apparaît que ces carences<lb/> pourraient s&apos;aggraver dans certains d&apos;entre eux au cours des vingt prochaines années si rien n&apos;est fait<lb/> entretemps pour remédier au problème d&apos;une offre qui se raréfie alors que la demande va croissant. L&apos;une<lb/> des solutions serait d&apos;attirer vers la médecine une plus forte proportion des cohortes de jeunes, elles-mêmes<lb/> en diminution, mais sans doute faudrait-il pour cela que les médecins puissent voir s&apos;améliorer leur niveau<lb/> relatif de rémunération ou leurs conditions d&apos;exercice.<lb/> 12.<lb/> Les pays ont à leur disposition toute une série d&apos;autres leviers pour agir sur la démographie<lb/> médicale, en particulier dans le domaine de l&apos;enseignement et de la formation, des migrations, de la retraite<lb/> et du maintien en activité.<lb/> 13.<lb/> Un certain nombre de pays ont déjà pris des mesures pour augmenter les effectifs d&apos;étudiants en<lb/> médecine, ou envisagent une action dans ce domaine.<lb/> 14.<lb/> Le recrutement de médecins à l&apos;étranger peut aider à résorber la pénurie dans les pays déficitaires,<lb/> mais il pose un douloureux problème d&apos;équité à l&apos;échelle internationale s&apos;il doit en résulter à la longue un<lb/> exode des médecins des pays pauvres, où l&apos;état de santé des populations est médiocre, vers les pays riches,<lb/> où la situation sanitaire est satisfaisante. C&apos;est pourquoi beaucoup de pays de l&apos;OCDE ont pour objectif de<lb/> former un nombre suffisant de médecins pour répondre à leurs besoins.<lb/> 15.<lb/> Pour anticiper la vague de départs à la retraite que va connaître la profession médicale dans de<lb/> nombreux pays de l&apos;OCDE, plusieurs d&apos;entre eux s&apos;efforcent d&apos;inciter les médecins à rester plus longtemps<lb/> en activité en assouplissant les dispositifs de retraite et en offrant une contrepartie financière au maintien<lb/> en exercice.<lb/> 16.<lb/> La plupart des pays de l&apos;OCDE se heurtent à un problème de répartition géographique inégalitaire<lb/> de leur effectif de médecins. Pour surmonter cette difficulté, un certain nombre d&apos;entre eux ont choisi<lb/> d&apos;associer, avec un certain succès, un ensemble de réformes du système de formation, de mesures<lb/> réglementaires et d&apos;aides financières.<lb/> 17.<lb/> Contre la tendance croissante à la spécialisation, on note aussi des efforts pour revaloriser la<lb/> médecine de soins primaires. Un certain nombre d&apos;indices tendent à prouver qu&apos;en permettant aux étudiants<lb/> d&apos;acquérir une expérience dans ce domaine et en leur donnant pour modèles des praticiens généralistes<lb/> nommés à des postes universitaires, on peut orienter les choix de carrière des jeunes médecins en faveur<lb/> des soins primaires.<lb/></figure>

			<p>18.<lb/> Les services rendus par les médecins dépendent non seulement de leur nombre, mais aussi de leur<lb/> productivité. Il y a de bonnes raisons de penser que le paiement à l&apos;activité est un moyen d&apos;accroître la<lb/> productivité des médecins, mais c&apos;est aussi un système qui risque de faire monter les coûts, et l&apos;on ne sait<lb/> pas grand-chose par ailleurs de l&apos;effet que peut avoir la multiplication des actes sur la qualité des soins. La<lb/> conception de modes de tarification des actes médicaux qui rémunèrent directement la qualité des services,<lb/> lorsque c&apos;est possible, fait donc aujourd&apos;hui l&apos;objet d&apos;un intérêt de plus en plus grand.<lb/></p>

			<p>19.<lb/> OECD countries face a number of challenges in matching the supply to the demand for the<lb/> services of physicians. These include making the right decisions on the numbers and training of new<lb/> entrants, on the retention and retirement of the existing stock of physicians, and on migration policies for<lb/> physicians. It also requires policies to ensure that there is the right specialty mix and geographical<lb/> distribution of physicians. It will require appropriate decisions on terms and conditions of service and on<lb/> methods of remuneration – not only to ensure that the right number of individuals is attracted to work in<lb/> medicine but also to ensure that those who are attracted are motivated to be as productive as possible.<lb/></p>

			<p>20.<lb/> This paper explores these issues mainly from an international perspective. Section 2 proposes a<lb/> framework for analysing physician employment in OECD countries by distinguishing between the demand<lb/> for and the supply of physicians; and by identifying two different concepts of shortage and surpluse of<lb/> physicians. Variations in levels of physician employment and their implications for costs, productivity and<lb/> health outcomes across countries are explored in section 3. The evidence on current shortages and<lb/> surpluses of physicians and a number of supply-side factors affecting future shortages and surpluses are<lb/> then reviewed in section 4. This is followed by a discussion in sections 5 to 7 of various policies for<lb/> ensuring an adequate supply of physicians, which distinguishes between the number of physicians at<lb/> country level, the geographic distribution of physicians within a country, and the speciality composition of<lb/> the physician workforce. Section 8 is devoted to a review of policies affecting the productivity of<lb/> physicians. The final section presents some concluding remarks on ensuring an adequate supply of<lb/> physician services.<lb/></p>

			<head>2 DEMAND FOR AND SUPPLY OF PHYSICIANS<lb/></head>

			<p>21.<lb/> <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref> presnts a flow chart depicting the way in which the services of physicians contribute to<lb/> the production of health care. The volume and quality of medical services is determined by the supply of<lb/> physician services, in combination with the supply of services of other health care resources such as other<lb/> health care workers, pharmaceuticals, equipment, beds, etc. There is corresponding demand for the<lb/> services of physicians (and for the services of other health care resources) derived from the demand for<lb/> health care itself. Assuring that countries have an adequate number of physicians to match demand is not a<lb/> straightforward exercise, given that needs are difficult to assess. In this field, demand is largely socially<lb/> determined. In particular, the volume of services demanded by a population covered by comprehensive<lb/> public insurance or public provision may exceed the socially desirable level, which will depend on costs as<lb/> well as on benefits. Even where insurance is privately financed, demand can be determined by agents who<lb/> do not meet the costs. In addition, some discretion is possible in the mix of skills used in furnishing<lb/> medical services.<lb/> 22.<lb/> <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref> indicates that the number of physicians is increased by flows into the workforce,<lb/> originating from newly-graduated physicians and immigrating physicians; and reduced by flows out of the<lb/> workforce, arising from emigration, career change and retirement. The hours physicians work, and the<lb/> intensity with which they work during those hours, combine with the availability of other resources to<lb/> determine productivity (real services per physician) in a complex manner. The Figure suggests that<lb/> decision makers and managers can draw on a range of instruments including education, training and<lb/> recruitment methods, methods and levels of remuneration to influence these factors.<lb/></p>

			<p>is affected by both<lb/> demand for, and supply of, physicians. Demand for physicians is likely to differ with variations in, among<lb/> other things, morbidity and mortality in the population, the proportion of gross domestic product that is<lb/> spent on health, the level of health insurance coverage, and (to the extent that &apos;supplier-induced demand is<lb/> possible) the methods of remunerating physicians. In other words, among other things, demand will<lb/> depend on the design of the health system (<ref type="biblio">Blumenthal, 2004</ref>). The supply of physicians is likely to vary<lb/> because of differences in, among other things, the availability of physician education and training, and<lb/> terms and conditions of service. At any one time, shortages and surpluses of physicians can occur if wages<lb/> or fees are set at a level which does not match supply with demand. Additionally, shortages and surpluses<lb/> can arise due to lags in responses to changes in demand (opr supply) (see Box 1) – for physicians the<lb/> minimum time between entry to medical school and becoming fully qualified can extend from seven years<lb/> to ten or more for many specialties.<lb/></p>

			<head>Box 1. An economic definition of shortages and surpluses of physicians<lb/></head>

			<p>Figure 2 depicts a standard demand and supply model, where the demand for physicians declines with the real wage<lb/> and the supply increases. Depending on, for example, their levels of health expenditure and institutional<lb/> arrangements, two countries A and B can have different demand and supply schedules for physicians, such as Da and<lb/> Db, and Sa and Sb, respectively. Equilibrium between demand and supply would be attained in each country if fees and<lb/> wages were set at Pa and Pb, resulting in levels of physician employment at Qa and at Qb, respectively. However, if,<lb/> purely for the sake of illustration, real fees and wages in both countries had been set for many years at an<lb/> intermediate wage, Pc, country A is likely to have developed a surplus of physicians equal to Qc-Qd, and country B is<lb/> likely to have developed a shortage equal to Qf-Qe..<lb/></p>

			<figure>Figure 2. Derived demand for and supply of physicians`Figure<lb/> physicians`<lb/></figure>

			<p>physicians`Figure 2 could also be interpreted as depicting a rise in demand in a single country (from Da to Db), with supply<lb/> responding with a lag from Sa to Sb. If the exercise of monopsony power by the dominant public purchasers of health<lb/> services restricts the rise in wages to Pc, this would be below the new level necessary to &apos;clear&apos; the market , at Pb.<lb/></p>

			<p>The microeconomic concept of shortages and surpluses set out in Box 1, should not be confused<lb/> with the idea that the number of physicians per capita may not match some predetermined &apos;norm&apos; or<lb/> benchmark. This benchmark could be a minimum physician-to-patient ratio or a target number of<lb/> physicians per capita in rural or deprived urban areas, in relation to which physicians shortages and<lb/> surpluses can then be defined. In Australia, for example, a benchmark was proposed of 2.051 full-time<lb/> equivalent practising physicians per 1,000 population based on 1994 data (Australian Medical Workforce<lb/> Advisory Committee and Australian Institute of <ref type="biblio">Health and Welfare, 1996</ref>). In England, the National<lb/> Health Service Plan set forward a target number of 0.557 full-time-equivalent primary care physicians per<lb/> 1,000 population weighted for need in each area in England (Secretary of State for Health, 2000). In the<lb/> United States, the Council on Graduate Medical Education proposed a range of physician requirements of<lb/> 0.6 to 0.8 primary care physicians and 0.8 to 1.0 specialist physicians per 1,000 population (Council on<lb/> Graduate Medical Education, 1994).<lb/></p>

			<head>3 ANALYSING INTERNATIONAL VARIABILITY IN PHYSICIAN EMPLOYMENT<lb/></head>

			<p>25.<lb/> There is substantial variation in the reported employment levels of physicians per 1 million<lb/> population across OECD countries (see <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>). It is more than 3.5 per 1 000 population in Greece, Italy,<lb/> Belgium, Austria, the Slovak Republic and Switzerland; and less than 2 in Japan, Korea and Mexico in<lb/> 2000. Some of these differences are undoubtedly due to the incomplete standardisation of data across<lb/> countries, but overall they seem to be too great to arise from definitional and coverage differences alone.<lb/></p>

What can be said about the implications for outcomes,<lb/> costs, activity levels and productivity of this international variability in physician employment?<lb/></table>

			<p>27.<lb/> There is evidence to suggest that higher densities of physicians tend to be associated with better<lb/> health outcomes and responsiveness across countries, although the magnitudes of the effects cannot be<lb/> estimated with any degree of reliability from international comparisons. In terms of health outcomes,<lb/> previous OECD work has suggested that the number of physicians per capita is inversely associated with<lb/> avoidable mortality across OECD countries, other things being equal. 1 In terms of responsiveness, the<lb/> OECD project on waiting times indicated the existence of a statistically-significant, inverse relationship<lb/> between physician density and waiting times for elective surgery across a small sample of countries with<lb/> waiting times 2 (see <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<p>28.<lb/> Turning to costs, it is often assumed that more physicians lead to higher health expenditure, not<lb/> so much because of their personal remuneration, but because their treatment interventions mobilise many<lb/> other health care workers and resources. <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref> suggests that there is a weak positive association<lb/> between physician density and the health spending effort (as a percent of GDP) across OECD countries.<lb/> However, it is not possible to say from this chart in what direction causation flows.<lb/></p>

			<p>29.<lb/> A previous econometric study (<ref type="biblio">OECD, 1995</ref>) suggested that overall health expenditure per capita<lb/> was associated positively with physician numbers in countries which paid their physicians by fee-for-<lb/>services, as opposed to paying them by salary or capitation. <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> suggests similarly that the health<lb/> expenditure share of GDP is positively associated both with physician density and with fee-for-service<lb/> payment of physicians.

			<p>30.<lb/> What is the relationship, if any, between physician density and physician activity levels and<lb/> productivity? For example, is higher physician density associated with lower services delivered per<lb/> physician, or is a higher density of physicians associated with a higher total number of medical acts?<lb/> Adequate data for cross-country comparisons of the activities of specialists are not generally available.<lb/> However, in the case of general practitioners (GPs) data are available from the European Community<lb/> Household Panel (ECHP) Survey on the annual number of visits by patients to GPs across European<lb/> countries. <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref> suggests that, although there is more variation in GP density than in the annual number<lb/> of GP visits per capita across countries, there is nevertheless a statistically significant positive association<lb/> between GP density and the annual number of GP visits per capita. 3 It is not clear which way causation<lb/> runs but it is possible that an increase in GP density raises the quantity demanded either because it lowers<lb/> money (or time) price per act (causing a movement down a fixed demand curve) or because it generates<lb/> &apos;supplier-induced&apos; demand – additional demand created by the GPs themselves in the form, for example,<lb/> of suggestions for repeat consultations during patients&apos; episodes of illness (causing an outward shift in the<lb/> demand curve). However, given that the annual number of visits by patients to GPs does not rise in<lb/> proportion to GP density, a higher GP density translates into a lower number of visits per GP (<ref type="figure">Figure 7</ref>).<lb/> This negative relationship appears to be statistically significant. However, it is difficult to make any<lb/> inference about physician productivity as we lack data on differences in the quality of care across<lb/> countries.<lb/></p>

			<p>3.<lb/> A tendency for an increase in total physician density to increase visits per GP, has been indicated by an<lb/> econometric analysis of ECHP data. This study controlled for other variables related to individuals, such as<lb/> self-reported health status, age, income and occupation, and for health system variables, such as method of<lb/> paying the doctor, total health expenditure per capita and a variable reflecting GP gatekeeping. A<lb/> significant finding of this study was that presence of GP gatekeeping is associated with higher visits to GPs<lb/> and lower visits to specialists, than is the case in the absence of gatekeeping (<ref type="biblio">Jiménez-Martin et al., 2004</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<p>There is still controversy in the literature over the incidence and extent of &apos;supplier-induced<lb/> demand&apos;. For example, studies in Austria, France and Norway vary in the extent to which a higher<lb/> physician density is associated with a higher volume of services. 4 Even for those studies that do find a<lb/> positive association between the stock of physicians and the quantity of medical services delivered by<lb/> physicians, there is no agreement, as mentioned above, as to whether this can be attributed to: a price or<lb/> volume effect on access to and quality of health care; to supplier-induced demand by physicians; or,<lb/> indeed, to a response to unobserved variations in population characteristics (<ref type="biblio">Carlsen and Grytten, 2000</ref>).<lb/> What does emerge from this literature is that individual physicians have considerable discretion over<lb/> practice patterns that are influenced by, amongst other things, ethical constraints, practice protocols,<lb/> amount of available time and views on appropriate level of income. In addition, it is not clear to date how<lb/> any inducement affects the health of patients (<ref type="biblio">Labelle et al., 1994</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<head>4 CURRENT AND FUTURE TRENDS IN PHYSICIAN EMPLOYMENT<lb/> 4.1 Current shortages and surpluses of physicians<lb/></head>

			<p>32.<lb/> Some OECD countries are reported to be facing physician shortages, whereas others seem to be<lb/> experiencing surpluses. In England, physician shortages can be observed in three-month vacancy rates of<lb/> 4.7% of all specialist physician posts and 3.3% of all primary care physician posts in England in the year to<lb/> March 2003 (Department of <ref type="biblio">Health, 2003</ref>). On the other hand, there were claims of a physician over-<lb/>supply in <ref type="biblio">Belgium</ref> in 2000 (European Observatory on Health Care Systems, 2000). Some countries may<lb/> have physician shortages in specific geographical regions such as rural and deprived areas, but have<lb/> surpluses in affluent metropolitan areas. Australia reported a shortage of 1,240 primary care physicians in<lb/> rural and remote areas and a supply in excess of benchmark levels of approximately 2,300 primary care<lb/> physicians in metropolitan areas in 1998 (Australian Medical Workforce Advisory Committee, 2000). In<lb/> other cases, shortages fall solely on certain categories of physician with specific skills or specialisation. In<lb/> the 1980s and 1990s, a series of studies by the Graduate Medical Education Advisory Committee and the<lb/> Council on Graduate Medical Education predicted a surplus of specialists equal to 15-30% of the physician<lb/> workforce and a shortage of primary care physicians in the United States by the year 2000. 5 However,<lb/> when the year 2000 arrived, there were few, if any, signs of a surplus of specialists and by 2004</figure>

			<p>, there were<lb/> reports that the Council on Graduate Medical Education was now expecting there to be shortages of<lb/> physicians by 2020 and was thought likely to advise that medical school enrolment should be increased<lb/> (<ref type="biblio">Blumenthal, 2004</ref>). Meanwhile, there was some evidence of decreasing employment opportunities for<lb/> specialists and increasing uptake of family medicine programmes by medical students in the second half of<lb/> the 1990s (<ref type="biblio">Grumbach, 2002</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<head>4.2 Future trends affecting the demand for and the supply of physicians<lb/></head>

			<p>33.<lb/> With gaps already appearing between the demand for and the supply of physicians in some<lb/> countries, it is important to understand what future trends might affect demand and supply over the next 20<lb/> years. It is widely expected that demand for medical care will increase because of likely improvements in<lb/> the standard of living, technological advances in medicine, population ageing and rising patient<lb/> expectations. On the supply side, there are likely to be reductions in the availability of physicians in most<lb/> countries unless steps are taken to increase recruitment. That is mainly because of increasing female<lb/> participation in the workforce and physician workforce ageing. The latter will lead to a wave of retirements<lb/> preceded by a drop in hours worked among older physicians.<lb/></p>

			<head>4.2.1 Female participation in the physician workforce<lb/></head>

			<p>34.<lb/> The proportion of practising physicians who are female has increased considerably over time in<lb/> many OECD countries (see <ref type="figure">Figure 8</ref>). In the Czech Republic, Finland and Poland, there were more female<lb/> than male physicians in</p>

			<table>2000.<lb/> 5.<lb/> See, for instance, Graduate Medical Education National Advisory Committee (1981) and<lb/> Council on Graduate Medical Education <ref type="biblio">(1992, 1994, 1995</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<figure>Figure 8. Female participation in the physician workforce, 1970-2000<lb/> 33.1<lb/> 31.1<lb/> 51.5<lb/> 50.7<lb/> 49.3<lb/> 14.3<lb/> 35.1<lb/> 32.6<lb/> 37.2<lb/> 54.2<lb/> 44.9<lb/> 39.2<lb/> 29.1<lb/> 23.1<lb/> 17.8<lb/> 10.1<lb/> 45.2<lb/> 26.5<lb/> 33.3<lb/> 9.1<lb/> 15.1<lb/> 9.1<lb/> 12<lb/> 40.6<lb/> 15.5<lb/> 17<lb/> 12.7<lb/> 6.6<lb/> 0<lb/> 10<lb/> 20<lb/> 30<lb/> 40<lb/> 50<lb/> 60<lb/> Austria<lb/> Canada<lb/> Czech Republic<lb/> Finland<lb/> Hungary<lb/> Japan<lb/> Netherlands<lb/> New Zealand<lb/> Norway<lb/> Poland<lb/> Portugal<lb/> Sweden<lb/> Switzerland<lb/> United States<lb/> Proportion of practising physicians who are female<lb/> 1970<lb/> 2000<lb/> Notes:<lb/> -Data for Austria refer to 1969 and 2000.

			<p>35.<lb/> Increasing female participation in the physician workforce can have important consequences for<lb/> the supply of physicians, given that female physicians tend to differ from their male colleagues in how they<lb/> participate in the workforce. Evidence from Australia and Canada suggests that female physicians prefer<lb/> primary care specialities, are less likely to work in rural areas, are more likely to leave the practice of<lb/> medicine or practice at low activity levels during child-bearing age, tend to work fewer hours and are more<lb/> likely to retire early. 6 Evidence from a number of European countries (<ref type="figure">Figure 9</ref>) also suggests that female<lb/> physicians tend to work fewer hours than male physicians, particularly during childbearing age. Other<lb/> things being equal, if the current tendency for female physicians to work fewer hours than their male<lb/> colleagues persists, the supply of medical services will fall if female participation in the physician<lb/> workforce increases.<lb/></p>

			<head>4.2.2 Physician ageing<lb/></head>

			<p>36.<lb/> Physician ageing is likely to have a profound effect on the future supply of physician services in<lb/> many countries. The generation of doctors who were born during the &apos;baby boom&apos; following World War II,<lb/> will be coming up to retirement during the next decade or two. Meanwhile, numbers in young population<lb/> cohorts, from which new recruits to medicine will mainly come, have been dwindling in many countries.<lb/> That suggests that shortages of physicians could appear or worsen in some countries over the next two<lb/> decades unless counter measures are taken. <ref type="table">Table 2</ref> shows that there is substantial variation in the<lb/> proportion of young physicians in the workforce of selected countries: it ranged from 3.8% in Italy to<lb/> 15.1% in Spain in 2001. There seems to be less variation in the percentage of people in the 20-29 age band<lb/> who are physicians. Low percentages in Greece and Italy suggest that these countries may be able to<lb/> sustain their physician workforce by attracting more young people into the physician workforce. However,<lb/> in six out of the eight countries, the number of young physicians fell over a period of five years, and in five<lb/> out of eight the proportion of practicing physicians in this age category fell. Hence, rather than anticipating<lb/> the retirement of older cohorts by increasing the stock of young physicians, most of these countries appear<lb/> to have increased the process of ageing of their physicians workforce by a fall in numbers of young<lb/> entrants to the profession.<lb/></p>

			<head>4.2.3 Physician work hours<lb/></head>

			<p>39.<lb/> The supply of physicians is also influenced by the number of hours that physicians work. <ref type="figure">Figure<lb/> 11</ref> suggests that the number of hours worked by physicians in some countries that have an insurance-based<lb/> health care system (Belgium, France and Germany) was higher than the number of hours worked by<lb/> physicians in a number of countries that fund health care through taxation (Denmark, Greece, Italy,<lb/> Portugal and Spain). It appears that the societal trend towards more leisure time has not yet translated into<lb/> shorter work hours, with weekly work hours of physicians remaining relatively stable in the selected<lb/> countries in the 1990s.<lb/></p>

That suggests that the coming &apos;retirement<lb/> boom&apos; among physicians will be preceded by a falling off in the hours of work that older physicians wish<lb/> to offer, pre-retirement.<lb/></p>

			<p>Regulations governing work hours, such as the 1993 EU Workin-Time Directive, have had<lb/> implications for physician work hours. This Directive, which Member States had to comply with by<lb/> November 1996, puts an upper limit of 48 hours on the number of hours worked per week by employee<lb/> physicians (see Box 2). Data from the EUROSTAT Labour Force Survey suggest that, in Denmark,<lb/> France, Germany, Greece, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal and Spain, the average number of hours worked<lb/> by full-time employee physicians was below 48 hours throughout the 1990s. Although the average number<lb/> of hours worked by full-time employee physicians in the United Kingdom fell substantially from 57.2<lb/> hours in 1992 to 51.3 in 2001, this still exceeded the limit imposed by the Working Time Directive.<lb/></p>

			<head>Box 2. EU Working-Time Directive<lb/></head>

			<p>The aim of the 1993 European Union Working-Time Directive (93/104/EC) is to establish minimum requirements<lb/> for encouraging improvements in working time, rest periods, annual leave and night work to ensure a better level of<lb/> protection of the safety and health of workers. The Working-Time Directive applies to all sectors of activity, both public<lb/> and private, although certain workers are excluded such as physicians in training. Additionally, self-employed workers<lb/> are not covered by the Directive.<lb/> The Working-Time Directive provides for:<lb/> •<lb/> a maximum 48 hour working week averaged over a reference period;<lb/> •<lb/> a minimum daily rest period of 11 consecutive hours a day;<lb/> •<lb/> a rest break where the working day is longer than six hours;<lb/> •<lb/> a minimum rest period of one day a week;<lb/></p>

			<figure>•<lb/> a statutory right to annual paid holiday of four weeks;<lb/> •<lb/> night working must not exceed eight hours a night on average.<lb/> In 2000, the European Parliament and the Council of Ministers reached agreement on phased implementation of the<lb/> Working-Time Directive for physicians in training (2000/34/EC). Under this agreement, average weekly hours worked<lb/> by physicians in training will be limited to 58 hours per week from August 2004, 56 hours per week from August 2007<lb/> and 48 hours from August 2009, with in exceptional circumstances the possibility of an extension of the deadline to<lb/> 2012. From August 2004, physicians in training must receive 11 hours continuous rest in every 24 hours or otherwise<lb/> be given compensatory rest. Additionally, all time spent on-call will be considered as working time for the purposes of<lb/> maximum hours worked and pay (irrespective of whether physicians actually get called).<lb/></figure>

			<p>42.<lb/> Variation in physician work hours among OECD countries may affect both physician<lb/> productivity and the safety of medical services delivered by physicians. It may also affect the health of<lb/> physicians. A review of the scientific literature showed that long work hours, sleep deprivation and<lb/> working at times when the biological clock is programmed for rest or sleeping affected physician<lb/> productivity by increasing the time needed to complete tasks, lowering the quality of patient care and<lb/> increasing the frequency of clinical mistakes (<ref type="biblio">British Medical Association, 1999</ref>). A review of the<lb/> experience of Denmark, France, Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom in regulating<lb/> work hours of physicians in training found that working excessive hours resulted in fatigue which can be a<lb/> significant contributor to medical errors (<ref type="biblio">Australian Medical Association, 1998</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<head>5 POLICIES AFFECTING THE NUMBER OF PRACTISING PHYSICIANS<lb/></head>

			<p>43.<lb/> The previous section has reported evidence on current physician shortages in some OECD<lb/> countries and has suggested that future shortages could arise as a result of factors such as physician ageing<lb/> unless actions are taken to increase inflows into or decrease outflows from the physician workforce. In<lb/> order to sustain the number of practising physicians, OECD countries have put in place a variety of<lb/> education, recruitment and retention policies to increase the flow of physicians into the workforce and to<lb/> reduce outflows. This has taken the form of policies affecting medical school intake, immigration and<lb/> emigration, retention and retirement of physicians.<lb/></p>

			<head>5.1 Increasing flows of physicians into the workforce<lb/> 5.1.1 Domestic physician education and training<lb/></head>

			<p>44.<lb/> OECD countries differ in whether they plan entry to medical schools or leave it to medical<lb/> schools to determine the number of student places. <ref type="table">Table 5</ref> suggests that about 12 of the 19 countries<lb/> listed, are now operating some sort of numerus clausus -but in some cases this has been adopted only<lb/> recently. Most of the remaining countries appear to leave entry to medical school to market forces (or, at<lb/> least to decentralised mechanisms).<lb/></p>

In<lb/> 1973, the Report of the Committee on Medical Schools to the Australian Universities Commission recommended an<lb/> increase in medical school intake, including the establishment of two new medical schools to provide 1,560<lb/> graduates per year by 1991. In 1988, the Committee of Inquiry into Medical Education noted a surplus of GPs in<lb/> urban areas. Since 1996, the Commonwealth Government has imposed a cap on medical school places to assist in<lb/> controlling the supply of the medical workforce. The cap applies to domestic medical students only. The number of<lb/> undergraduate medical school entrants has increased in the late 1990s (from 856 in 1995 to 1,334 in 1999).

These numbers break down to 60% Flemish-speaking and 40%<lb/> French-speaking students.<lb/> Canada<lb/> Following the introduction of hospital insurance in most provinces, the Hall Commission recommended an expansion<lb/> in the number of physicians by increasing medical school intake and opening four new medical schools in 1964.<lb/> These recommendations were progressively implemented and lead to a peak of 1,835 medical graduates in 1985.<lb/> The 1984 workforce study into physician manpower in Canada (1980-2000) and a subsequent study by Barer and<lb/> Stoddart in 1991 recommended a reduction in medical school intake in order to avoid a physician surplus.<lb/> Consequently, the number of medical graduates fell to 1,516 in 1999. Recommendations made in 1999 by the Task<lb/> Force on Physicians Supply are to increase medical school intake to 2,000 students per year.<lb/> France<lb/> France has employed a numerus clausus for admission in the second year of undergraduate medical school since<lb/> 1971. Due to concerns over a surplus of physicians, the numerus clausus has been reduced progressively since<lb/> 1980 to bottom out at 3,500 students in 1993. Since then, the numerus clausus has increased as a consequence of<lb/> a projected shortage of physicians in 2010-2015.

			<p>45.<lb/> These different approaches may go some way towards explaining variation in physician density<lb/> across countries. <ref type="figure">Figure 15</ref> suggests that the level and growth rate of physician density over time has been<lb/> higher in a selection of countries that have not controlled medical school intake centrally, or have<lb/> controlled it only recently, than it has been in a selection of countries that have controlled intake for many<lb/> years.

			<head>46.<lb/></head>

			<p>In a few countries such as Austria, Belgium, Germany and Switzerland, the supply of physicians<lb/> has been determined in a largely unregulated environment. Rising health expenditure at times of strong<lb/> economic growth has made it possible to meet employment and income targets of physicians in these<lb/> countries (<ref type="biblio">Bloor and Maynard, 2003</ref>). However, a high and growing physician density together with fee-<lb/>for-service payments to physicians may threaten the affordability of the health care system in times of<lb/> stagnant economic growth. Additionally, the labour market for physicians may suffer from a number of<lb/> market failures. For instance, licensing and regulatory requirements give physicians monopoly power. If<lb/> entry to the market were controlled by medical trade unions, there might be under-supply of physicians.<lb/> Conversely, the use of health insurance, which may affect price signals for patients, means that there may<lb/> be potential excess demand for physician services. Moreover, asymmetry of information between<lb/> physician and patient about diagnosis and required treatment creates the potential for physicians to induce<lb/> some demand. The existence of such market failures has led to varying degrees of public intervention in<lb/></p>

			<p>Countries that<lb/> don&apos;t or recently<lb/> started to control<lb/> medical school<lb/> intake<lb/></p>

			<p>Countries that<lb/> control<lb/> medical school<lb/> intake<lb/> the supply of physician services in the majority of OECD countries, including workforce planning.<lb/> However, in the case of workforce planning, it too may suffer from a number of failures (see Box 3).<lb/></p>

			<head>Box 3. Limitations of workforce planning<lb/></head>

			<p>Forecasting efforts have suffered from a lack of appropriate and reliable data on demand for and supply of<lb/> physicians. A major uncertainty relates to the effect of future technological change on demand. Another uncertainty is<lb/> about the future rate of growth of publicly-funded health expenditure, because it may be subject to changing political<lb/> priorities. In addition, there may be uncertainties on the supply side due to unpredictable changes in migration flows,<lb/> career change or retirement.<lb/> Workforce planning has generally been conducted in the context of uncertainty surrounding health care<lb/> system design issues (<ref type="biblio">Fooks et al., 2002</ref>). For instance, planners have had to project the required number of primary<lb/> care physicians in the absence of a consensus on the optimal model of organising primary care delivery (e.g. to what<lb/> extent can nurse practitioners substitute for primary care physicians in the provision of primary care services?). Few<lb/> exercises have had a focus beyond one specific health profession or considered the most cost-effective use of the<lb/> skills of a range of providers. Ideally, workforce planning and supply policies should be integrated into health system<lb/> reforms and the design of the health care system should take into account the need for physician services.<lb/></p>

			<p>Tensions may arise from the different levels at which workforce planning takes place. In Australia, the<lb/> Australian Medical Workforce Advisory Committee provides advice on physician supply policies at national level, but<lb/> implementation is the prerogative of State/Territory Governments. This may lead to planning recommendations that do<lb/> not take into account the budgetary implications and health service delivery decisions of State/Territory Governments<lb/> (<ref type="biblio">Gavel et al., 2002</ref>). Differing and non-coordinated approaches to workforce planning by Canadian provinces and<lb/> territorial jurisdictions have given rise to inter-provincial/territorial tensions.<lb/> Workforce planning is subject to political interference (<ref type="biblio">Hall, 1998</ref>). Support for strategic planning may be<lb/> limited in a rapidly evolving political environment characterised by changing priorities. Many workforce decisions,<lb/> however, require longer-term planning given that, for instance, decisions to change medical school intake take time to<lb/> have an effect on the actual physician workforce. Additionally, support may be short-lived in that planning may be<lb/> initiated in response to an apparent workforce crisis, but is then discontinued as the crisis passes.<lb/></p>

			<p>Workforce planning does not always take into account the viewpoints of the various stakeholders,<lb/> undermining its accessibility and hindering its implementation (<ref type="biblio">Goldsand and Frechette, 2001</ref>).<lb/> 47.<lb/> The cost-effectiveness of planning regimes appears to depend on whether countries attach more<lb/> importance to avoiding either a shortage or a surplus of physicians. For instance, Sweden has generally had<lb/> a policy of increasing health expenditure and physician employment over the past 40 years, with medical<lb/> schools educating and training more physicians than are needed to replace flows out of the physician<lb/> workforce. This is reflected in the relatively high annual growth rate of physician density from 1960 to<lb/> 2000 (OECD, 2003a). However, growth in physician density has been constrained since the early 1980s by<lb/> capping medical school intake in response to projections of physician surpluses and pressures to contain<lb/> health expenditure. In the United Kingdom, there was a more constrained approach through several<lb/> decades. This seems to have been determined by the desire to limit increases in health expenditure,<lb/> concerns to avoid physician unemployment, and systematic under-estimation of future growth in demand<lb/> for physicians (Medical Workforce <ref type="biblio">Standing Advisory Committee, 1997</ref>).<lb/> 48.<lb/> The cost-effectiveness of policies designed to influence medical school intake depends on a<lb/> number of additional factors, including the number and size of existing medical schools, the availability of<lb/> a sufficient number of high-quality applicants and any public costs involved in funding additional places.<lb/> Attrition during medical school also needs to be considered, with a number of studies reporting drop-out<lb/> rates in the United Kingdom of 8% to 14%. 7 Academic failure and personal factors (e.g. lack of motivation<lb/> for study) appear to be the main reasons for students to drop out of medical school. Therefore, medical<lb/> school admission procedures that test for previous academic performance and motivation for study may<lb/> assist in reducing the economic and personal loss due to drop-out.<lb/> 49.<lb/> For instance, a recent review argued that the potential to increase medical school intake in the<lb/> United States in the future is inhibited by the declining growth in the number of college-age individuals,<lb/> the large size of existing medical schools which restricts further expansion, the costs and time involved in<lb/> building new medical schools and the limited margin for further reducing attrition rates (<ref type="biblio">Cooper, 2003</ref>).<lb/> Even though these conditions do not necessarily apply to other OECD countries, it should be noted that<lb/> using medical school intake to ensure an adequate supply of physicians depends on the time lag involved in<lb/> putting students through medical school. This implies that, by the time that medical students graduate,<lb/> demand conditions may have changed and demand may no longer match supply.<lb/> 50.<lb/> How can the effectiveness of physician workforce planning and implementation be improved to<lb/> assure supply? Planning experiences in 18 countries reviewed by the World Health Organization and the<lb/> Canadian experience suggest that workforce planning and implementation are more effective when it has<lb/> strong leadership, is the result of a consultative process to solicit input, is integrated with health sector<lb/> reform strategies, obtains financial support and high-level political endorsement (<ref type="biblio">Egger et al., 2000; Fooks<lb/> et al., 2002</ref>).<lb/> 51.<lb/> There is little evidence about when and to what extent market and planning approaches should be<lb/> used or the appropriate criteria for guiding this choice. Hall (1998) argues that workforce planning should<lb/> play a greater role if the public sector is the primary source of medical training, minimum quality standards<lb/> are required, the public sector is the main employer of physicians, shortages/surpluses can substantially<lb/> distort the provision of medical services and good data are available. In practice, supply policies are likely<lb/> to be based on a combination of market and planning mechanisms.<lb/></p>

			<head>5.1.2 Physician immigration<lb/></head>

			<p>52.<lb/> Although OECD countries generally favour long-term policies of national self-sufficiency to<lb/> sustain their physician workforces, such policies usually co-exist with short-term or medium-term policies<lb/> to attract practising physicians from abroad, on a temporary or permanent basis. Foreign-trained physicians<lb/> can make a substantial contribution to the physician workforce: for example, they exceeded 20% of<lb/> practising physicians in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom (England) and the United<lb/> States, in 2000. This is not surprising as in many cases it is likely to reflect patterns of migration affecting<lb/> the population in these countries. Immigration increases the flexibility and reduces the cost of physician<lb/> supply in the host country, although in some cases it may raise concerns about the quality and safety of<lb/> health care services delivered by migrants. Immigration of physicians appears to be driven by a number of<lb/> &apos;pull&apos; factors such as opportunities for professional training, offers of higher wages, and better employment<lb/> opportunities in the host country. &apos;Push&apos; factors such as lack of employment opportunities and less<lb/> attractive living and working conditions in the home country also play a role.<lb/> 53.<lb/> Immigration of doctors for training purposes can account for a substantial number of foreign-<lb/>trained physicians in a country. Physicians from overseas who were attending postgraduate training in<lb/></p>

			<table>England made up 39.6% of all physicians from overseas in the National Health Service in 1995, 36.2% in<lb/> 7.<lb/> See General Medical Council (1992), Medical Workforce Standing Advisory Committee (1995), McManus<lb/> (1996) and Parkhouse (1996). These figures are generally based on a definition of failure which includes<lb/> all students re-taking an examination as well as those who are excluded from a course and, thus, should be<lb/> treated with some caution.<lb/> 2000 and 37.3% in 2001. International medical graduates who came to the United States to attend<lb/> postgraduate training comprised 11.9% of all international medical graduates in 1980, 12.1% in 1990,<lb/> 15.1% in 1995 and 13.1% in 2000. Similarly, training opportunities may account for a significant<lb/> proportion of emigrating physicians. In 2001, the number of physicians who were registered in<lb/> Switzerland, but were living abroad to attend postgraduate training and to practice, was 555 and 629,<lb/> respectively.<lb/> 54.<lb/> <ref type="table">Table 6</ref> reports on the composition of the foreign(-trained) physician workforce in selected<lb/> OECD countries. These data show that developing countries are just one, but not necessarily the main<lb/> source of international recruitment of physicians by OECD countries: a large contribution to the foreign<lb/> physician workforce of Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Ireland, Norway<lb/> and Switzerland originated from another European country. Additionally, flows of physicians between<lb/> OECD countries are not always uni-directional. For instance, in 2001, Irish physicians made up 15.2% of<lb/> the foreign physician workforce in the United Kingdom. Conversely, 29.2% of foreign physicians in<lb/> Ireland originated from the United Kingdom. This is sometimes referred to as a &apos;carousel movement&apos;<lb/> (<ref type="biblio">Martineau et al., 2002</ref>). <ref type="table">Table 6</ref> suggests also that, not surprisingly, physicians are more likely to move<lb/> between countries speaking the same language. This is mirrored in migration flows between Australia,<lb/> Canada, Ireland, the United Kingdom and the United States, between Germany, Austria and Switzerland,<lb/> between France and Belgium, and between Denmark and Norway.<lb/></p>

			<head>5.1.2.1 International regulation governing physician migration<lb/></head>

			<p>55.<lb/> Immigration of physicians into OECD countries is governed by international agreements that<lb/> impose general requirements that physicians have to fulfil in order to move and work abroad. These<lb/> provisions refer to, amongst other things, nationality and citizenship requirements, national regulation<lb/> governing the issuance of work permits, procedures and tests for examining asylum applications.<lb/> 56.<lb/> One of the agreements that covers the temporary immigration of physicians into an OECD<lb/> country is the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS). This agreement seems to have had a very<lb/> limited impact so far on physician migration. For instance, as a result of commitments under the GATS,<lb/> temporary resident visas are available in Australia for suitably qualified physicians who satisfy labour<lb/> market requirements (i.e. provide services to rural and remote communities). Within the GATS framework,<lb/> Members are free to pursue domestic policies in areas such as technical standards, licensing and<lb/> qualifications to ensure the safety and quality of health care provision. This implies that a commitment to<lb/> allow entry of foreign physicians is still subject to those physicians meeting all domestic regulatory<lb/> requirements to practice. GATS only states that such requirements must be transparent (i.e. made publicly<lb/> available) and must be administered in a reasonable, objective and impartial manner.<lb/> 57.<lb/> International agreements stimulating the immigration of foreign physicians have been<lb/> accompanied by requirements licensing medical practice in a country to ensure the quality and safety of<lb/> services provided by migrants. However, licensing provisions may also serve to reduce competition in the<lb/> host country and to raise the income of domestic physicians. This raises the issue of how foreign<lb/> physicians are mobilised within the health care system of the host country and the conditions under which<lb/> they have to work. In some cases, this has lead to a situation where physicians whose qualifications have<lb/> not been recognised by the host country still practice medicine even though their status is unclear. In other<lb/> cases, specialists work as generalists or generalists work as nurses. Once registered, physicians may also<lb/> face discriminatory employment practices. A survey showed that 9% of foreign physicians claim<lb/> discriminatory practices in finding employment in the United Kingdom (<ref type="biblio">Jinks et al., 2000</ref>).<lb/> 58.<lb/> Licensing requirements usually consist of holding the required qualifications (i.e. medical<lb/> degree) from a recognised medical school and of having completed a period of training. However, the<lb/> license is only valid within the jurisdiction of the granting body. This is usually an entire country, but in<lb/> some cases a specific province or state, as in Canada and the United States. This implies that physicians<lb/> who wish to practice in another country have to go through the process of having their qualifications<lb/> recognised by the relevant body in the host country. Simplified procedures exist for physicians trained in<lb/> specific countries. For instance, from 1st May 2002, graduates of British medical schools recognised by the<lb/> General Medical Council are eligible for permanent registration in New Zealand without having to sit the<lb/> New Zealand Medical Council registration examination. There is also a Mutual Recognition Agreement<lb/> between Australia and New Zealand, providing for automatic recognition of primary medical qualifications<lb/> conferred by all medical schools within these jurisdictions.<lb/> 59.<lb/> The EU has adopted a range of measures to simplify licensing provisions. In addition to the<lb/> Treaty of Rome, which gives every EU citizen a personal right to move and reside freely within the<lb/> territory of the Member States. Member States have adopted sectoral directives that facilitate the<lb/> movement of physicians within the EU, through the harmonisation and recognition of qualifications and<lb/> diplomas. The so-called &quot; doctors&apos; directives &quot; (75/362/EEC and 75/363/EEC) entitle any EU physician who<lb/> has completed basic training in a Member State and who holds a recognised qualification to be<lb/> automatically registered in any other Member State. However, the process of recognition of qualifications<lb/> foresees that Member States are entitled to require an adaptation period and an aptitude test. The impact of<lb/> the EU doctors&apos; directives on the movement of physicians appears to have been limited, so far, due to: the<lb/> general absence of physician surpluses in Member States; failure to implement the directives; and failure to<lb/> recognise the equivalence of qualifications in some Member States.<lb/></p>

			<head>5.1.2.2 Policies designed to stimulate physician immigration<lb/></head>

			<p>60.<lb/> Given the limited success of international agreements regulating physician migration, OECD<lb/> countries have adopted various policies designed to stimulate the immigration of foreign physicians. These<lb/> have included: launching international recruitment campaigns; easing immigration requirements; and<lb/> setting up special arrangements that foster shared learning between health care systems. Germany has<lb/> undertaken international recruitment campaigns involving advertising in the medical press and has<lb/> participated in job fairs. Norway has offered immigrant physicians language courses. Canada, has made<lb/> changes to its Immigration Act Regulation to favour entry of physicians. Australia and the United States<lb/> have relaxed immigration requirements for foreign physicians willing to practice in rural areas. Ireland has<lb/> taken steps to fast track working visas for foreign physicians. In the United Kingdom, employment in the<lb/> National Health Service (NHS) has been promoted abroad and an International Fellowship Programme was<lb/> launched in 2002 to attract experienced specialists from abroad to selected posts in the NHS for periods of<lb/> one to two years.<lb/> 61.<lb/> Whereas immigration of physicians can reduce the cost of acquiring trained physicians in the<lb/> host country, it can provoke shortages in the home country from which the physician emigrates. Moreover,<lb/> it represents a transfer of human capital from the home to the host country, at least if the migration is<lb/> permanent. That raises uncomfortable questions about international equity when the population of the host<lb/> country is comparatively rich and healthy and the population of the home country is comparatively poor<lb/> and sick. For this reason, a number of OECD countries have adopted so-called &apos;ethical recruitment&apos;<lb/> policies designed to restrict immigration from developing countries (see Box 4).<lb/></p>

			<figure>Box 4. Ethical recruitment policies restricting immigration from developing countries<lb/> In May 2003, Commonwealth countries adopted an International Code of Practice for the International<lb/> Recruitment of Health Workers. The code of practice is intended to discourage physician recruitment from countries<lb/> which are themselves experiencing shortages. Moreover, it sets out a number of principles that should guide<lb/> international recruitment. Transparency of recruitment would normally involve an agreement between host and home<lb/> countries. Fairness implies that host countries should not seek to recruit physicians who have an outstanding<lb/> obligation to the home country and should inform migrants of their rights and job requirements. Finally, international<lb/> recruitment of physicians should be based on mutuality of benefits to host and home countries.<lb/></figure>

			<p>Given that the temporary outflow of physicians from developing countries may be beneficial in terms of upgrading<lb/> of skills (and remittances), a second type of policy has focused on offering grants to foreign students to enter medical<lb/> school, while at the same time making it impossible for foreign graduates to obtain a work permit for a certain amount<lb/> of time (e.g. five years). This, in effect, forces them to return to their home country after they graduate. Some countries<lb/> have created regulations or have entered into bilateral agreements restricting the stay of foreign physicians. For<lb/> instance, the United States has created a &apos;cultural exchange visa&apos; that can be issued to foreign health care workers<lb/> only for a limited duration of work. After the permitted stay, the visitor is required to return home for a two-year period<lb/> before he is entitled to apply for re-admittance.<lb/></p>

			<p>In the case of permanent migration, home countries incur a loss in terms of costs of education and training, and<lb/> the value of the health care services that could have been provided if the physician had not left the country. Therefore,<lb/> a third approach has consisted of financially compensating the home country for losses that it has incurred as a result<lb/> of physician migration. The reimbursement of educational costs is in fact proposed by the International Code of<lb/> Practice for the International Recruitment of Health Workers adopted by Commonwealth countries. However, such<lb/> policies are inhibited by the difficulty of evaluating the country&apos;s net loss (subtracting direct and indirect costs created<lb/> by the departure of the physicians from migration gains, such as an increase in scientific knowledge and remittances).<lb/> In addition, the potential return of the physician might represent a problem in setting the level of compensation. Such<lb/> difficulties may explain the fact that previous schemes attempting to tax host countries, and even migrants, have not<lb/> proven to be successful (<ref type="biblio">Lowell, 2001</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<head>5.2 Reducing flows of physicians out of the workforce<lb/></head>

			<p>62.<lb/> Flows of physicians out of the workforce consist of physicians emigrating to another country,<lb/> physicians moving to another job and physicians taking up retirement.<lb/> 63.<lb/> In countries such as Canada, New Zealand and Sweden, concerns have been expressed that<lb/> physicians are emigrating at an earlier stage of their career and are staying away for a longer period of<lb/> time. However, it appears that few countries have implemented policies to reduce the level of emigration<lb/> of physicians and little is known about the effectiveness of existing programmes. New Zealand has<lb/> undertaken efforts to maintain contact with expatriate physicians, encouraging their overseas development<lb/> while offering some incentives for their return. In Ontario, Canada, a repatriation programme was<lb/> introduced for Canadians who had undertaken a postgraduate training programme in the United States.<lb/></p>

			<head>5.2.1 Physician turnover<lb/></head>

			<p>64.<lb/> In the United Kingdom, evidence from the Medical Careers Research Group suggests that five<lb/> years after qualifying, 5-9% of physicians were no longer in medical practice (excluding emigration). A<lb/> study reviewing the British literature on primary care physician retention suggested that retention policies<lb/> need to focus on improving working-time flexibility, creating more flexible career development<lb/> opportunities and offering a wider range of options for continued education and training (see Box 5). It was<lb/> argued that such flexibility would enable physicians to balance work and family responsibilities, increase<lb/> retention of female physicians, facilitate the return of physicians who have left the workforce and delay<lb/> retirement plans of older physicians. In the Netherlands, retention policies have targeted working<lb/> conditions in general practice.<lb/></p>

			<head>Box 5. Improving retention of primary care physicians in the United Kingdom<lb/></head>

			<p>Increasing job flexibility was identified by a review of the British literature as the main instrument to improve<lb/> retention of primary care physicians. This can take the form of three main types of policies: improving working-time<lb/> flexibility, creating more flexible career development opportunities and offering a wider range of options for continued<lb/> education and training.<lb/> A first area in which there is scope for stimulating flexibility relates to working time. New work practices are being<lb/> implemented that move away from traditional systems of permanent, full-time employment towards less rigid working<lb/> arrangements (e.g. job share, part-time work, short-term work, planned career breaks, greater flexibility to take<lb/> maternity leave and holidays). These policies aim to allow for better time management and more controllable working<lb/> hours, which will enable physicians to more easily balance work and family responsibilities and pursue other medical<lb/> and personal interests. More flexible work patterns may increase retention of female physicians and delay retirement<lb/> plans of older physicians.<lb/></p>

			<p>Another way of increasing job flexibility is to develop career development prospects by expanding the choice of<lb/> long-term career paths. This can be achieved by including a clear ladder of opportunities, by offering opportunities to<lb/> leave the job temporarily with a possibility of guaranteed return at a later stage, by creating posts that combine clinical<lb/> tasks with research, teaching or management, and by making it possible to rotate jobs with other health disciplines.<lb/> A third area of flexibility is concerned with continued education and training opportunities. Continued medical<lb/> education offers opportunities to enrich the professional experience and to further develop the skills of physicians. This<lb/> is particularly so in rural areas where there is a need to provide opportunities to maintain skills. It is also crucial to<lb/> provide re-entry training to facilitate the return of those physicians who have left the workforce.<lb/> Source: Young and Leese (1999).<lb/></p>

			<head>5.2.2 Physician retirement<lb/></head>

			<p>65.<lb/> The societal trend towards early and partial retirement (<ref type="biblio">OECD, 2001</ref>) is reducing the stock of<lb/> physicians, with physicians retiring at an earlier age and older physicians trimming down the number of<lb/> working hours. A survey of a sample of physicians in the United States aged 50 years or over suggested<lb/> that 38% would retire within the next one to three years and 28% would reduce their activity levels<lb/> (<ref type="biblio">Hawkins, 2000</ref>). A national survey of primary care physicians in England found that the proportion of<lb/> primary care physicians who were under 65 years of age and intending to quit direct patient care in the next<lb/> five years rose from 14% in 1998 to 22% in 2001 (<ref type="biblio">Sibbald et al., 2003</ref>). To compensate for early and<lb/> partial retirement of physicians, policies have tended to centre on decreasing flows of physicians out of the<lb/> workforce by reducing the rate at which physicians take early retirement, by delaying retirement or by<lb/> attracting retired physicians back into the workforce.<lb/> 66.<lb/> One policy approach to retain physicians in the workforce up to their potential retirement date is<lb/> to offer more flexible working patterns that reduce workload. In the United Kingdom, a &apos;flexible retirement<lb/> initiative&apos; was launched in July 2000 that enabled staff nearing retirement to move into part-time work in<lb/> ways that don&apos;t reduce pension benefits or move into a new role in a way which, even though staff may be<lb/> in a lower paid post, preserves the pension entitlement from the higher level post.<lb/> 67.<lb/> Other policies aim to defer the retirement of physicians for a certain amount of time. Plans have<lb/> been proposed in Australia to entice physicians who plan to retire early to stay in the workforce longer.<lb/> Mexico is considering proposals to increase the retirement age in public health institutions by postponing<lb/> access to retirement social benefits. In Sweden, proposals are being discussed whether physicians should<lb/> be encouraged to work beyond the current retirement age of 65 years. The United Kingdom &apos;flexible<lb/> retirement initiative&apos; encourages staff to stay on beyond the normal retirement age for a limited number of<lb/> months by offering additional pension contributions.<lb/> 68.<lb/> A third type of policy is designed to attract retired physicians back into the workforce. In the<lb/> United Kingdom, health staff can retire and start receiving a pension whilst carrying on with part-time<lb/> work. Such policies not only need to focus on getting physicians to return to practice, but also keep<lb/> potential returners informed and interested while they are away. Therefore, all National Health Service<lb/> Trusts have established &apos;keep-in-touch&apos; schemes. This means that retiring staff can put their name forward<lb/> to be called on to work for the National Health Service on a casual basis, as and when they choose.<lb/></p>

			<head>6 POLICIES AFFECTING THE GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION OF PRACTISING<lb/> PHYSICIANS<lb/></head>

			<p>69.<lb/> Most, if not all, OECD countries suffer from an unequal geographical distribution of their<lb/> physician workforce. Typically, rural areas, deprived urban areas and areas with significant indigenous<lb/> populations experience shortages of physicians, while affluent, metropolitan areas face surpluses.<lb/> Physicians generally prefer to practice in affluent, metropolitan areas due to their greater range of<lb/> amenities. This may include greater employment opportunities, more attractive career pathways, better<lb/> access to education services for children and superior cultural activities. This section reviews policies that<lb/> countries have implemented to attract and retain physicians in rural or deprived urban areas.<lb/> 70.<lb/> As a side-effect of an increasing overall number of practising physicians, rural and deprived<lb/> urban areas have been able to attract more physicians. However, the so-called &apos;spreading out&apos;, &apos;overflow&apos;<lb/> or &apos;trickle down&apos; effect, in which the increasing number of physicians in affluent, metropolitan areas<lb/> diffuse to rural and deprived urban areas when urban areas reach a saturation point in terms of competition,<lb/> was not sufficient to eliminate geographic shortages in the United Kingdom and the United States (<ref type="biblio">Politzer<lb/> et al., 1999; Gravelle and Sutton, 2001</ref>). A study of the US physician workforce found that overall<lb/> physician density increased from 2,140 physicians per 1 million population in 1991 to 2,390 in 2001<lb/> (United States General Accounting Office, 2003). Non-metropolitan areas experienced a growth in<lb/> physician density of 10% as compared with 23% in metropolitan areas.<lb/> 71.<lb/> Therefore, some countries have designed and implemented specific policies that aim to ensure an<lb/> adequate supply of physicians in rural and deprived urban areas. Countries have generally put in place not<lb/> one, but a number of concurrent supply-side policies designed to influence the geographical distribution of<lb/> physicians. These include educational policies, education-related funding policies, regulatory/<lb/> administrative policies and financial policies. The nature of such policies differs between OECD countries.<lb/> Financial policies seem to dominate in Canada, regulatory/administrative policies are the predominant type<lb/> of policy instrument in Norway, whilst New Zealand and the United Kingdom use a combination of both.<lb/> Education-related funding policies and educational policies are relatively under-developed in most<lb/> countries, except for Australia and Japan.<lb/></p>

			<head>6.1 Educational policies<lb/></head>

			<p>72.<lb/> Educational initiatives designed to attract physicians to rural and deprived urban areas have been<lb/> based on two characteristics that affect the choice of practice location: the background of the medical<lb/> student and the content of the medical curriculum.<lb/> 73.<lb/> One type of educational policy has attempted to encourage students with specific demographic<lb/> characteristics to take up medical education and training. This reflects research evidence suggesting that<lb/> medical students who come from a rural background or from a deprived urban area are more likely to<lb/> locate in those areas after graduation (<ref type="biblio">Grumbach and Seifer, 1995; Rolfe et al., 1995; Easterbrook et al.,<lb/> 1999</ref>). In Australia, selective admission policies of medical schools which take the form of affirmative<lb/> entry programmes and scholarships for students with a rural background have been shown to be effective<lb/> in attracting physicians to rural areas (Department of <ref type="biblio">Health and Aged Care, 2001</ref>).<lb/> 74.<lb/> Other educational policies have attempted to attract physicians to rural and deprived urban areas<lb/> by increasing the relevance of the medical education and training curriculum to the practice of medicine in<lb/> such areas. This type of policy is founded on evidence that educational programmes that place more<lb/> emphasis on the rural component of the curriculum or the health status of deprived urban areas and<lb/> educational programmes that expose students to practice in rural and deprived urban areas are more likely<lb/> to attract students to such areas when they graduate (Council on Graduate Medical <ref type="biblio">Education, 1998;<lb/> Rabinowitz et al., 1999</ref>). Such considerations have affected educational policies in Australia, where<lb/> medical students have at least eight weeks of rural experience in their curriculum. By 2000, 600<lb/> scholarships were offered to undergraduate and graduate medical students to work and study in rural areas.<lb/> A number of Canadian jurisdictions propose rural training for undergraduate medical students and have a<lb/> rural practice residency or speciality. In Greece, all physicians have to undertake two years of mandatory<lb/> practice in rural areas after they obtain their medical degree. The General Practitioner Vocational Training<lb/> Scheme in the United Kingdom exposes medical students to rural practice and lets them acquire special<lb/> knowledge and skills useful in rural practice.<lb/> 75.<lb/> Some educational initiatives have drawn simultaneously on a number of strategies to attract<lb/> physicians to rural and deprived urban areas. Since the 1970s, Norway and Sweden have located medical<lb/> schools in rural areas with the aim of bringing more students with a specific background into medical<lb/> school and of providing more training in rural health to students. The Physician Shortage Area Program in<lb/> the United States consists of a selective admission policy (students of rural origin with interest to practice<lb/> family medicine in rural areas), financial aid, a family medicine programme and rural practice sites.<lb/> Although it is difficult to assess the contribution of each component, such multi-faceted programmes have<lb/> been successful in recruiting physicians to rural areas as well as retaining them (<ref type="biblio">Rabinowitz, 1993; Inoue et<lb/> al., 1997</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<head>6.2 Education-related funding policies<lb/></head>

			<p>76.<lb/> Education-related funding policies relate to those arrangements that have funded the education of<lb/> physicians with a condition on practice location.<lb/> 77.<lb/> One of the most prominent programmes has been scholarships / loans to medical students in<lb/> return for a commitment to practice in rural and deprived urban areas for a number of years. For instance,<lb/> students who practice in North Norway have been partially exempted from the obligation to reimburse<lb/> their loan. Japanese medical students can be exempted from repaying the loan if they work in a public<lb/> hospital or clinic in a rural area for a certain period of time. In the United States, a number of programmes<lb/> provide scholarships and loan repayment schemes to medical students in exchange for serving in specific<lb/> areas. The evidence on the success of these return-of-service schemes is mixed. The National Health<lb/> Service Corps in the United States has been successful in placing physicians in underserved areas after<lb/> completion of training through scholarship provision or loan repayment programmes. However, return-of-<lb/>service schemes have been less successful in Canada and Mexico given that a substantial number of<lb/> students have been able to buy their way out of their service commitment and few students opt to remain in<lb/> rural and deprived urban areas after their required period of service has expired (<ref type="biblio">Anderson and Rosenberg,<lb/> 1990; Nigenda, 1997</ref>).<lb/> 78.<lb/> Additionally, some countries have adopted policies funding departments of rural health in<lb/> medical schools in order to expand the rural health component of the medical curriculum. In 1992, the<lb/> Royal Australian College of General Practitioners founded a Faculty of Rural Medicine to develop and<lb/> administer a four-year graduate diploma in rural general practice. Most territories created Rural Health<lb/> Training Units. In 1996, the Australian Commonwealth Government funded the establishment of six<lb/> university-linked Departments of Rural Health and an Advanced Specialist Training Posts Programme<lb/> designed to create specialist training posts in major rural centres.<lb/> 79.<lb/> Other policies have funded continuing medical education in an effort to retain physicians in rural<lb/> areas. Such policies were introduced in Australia as part of the National Rural Health Strategy. Similarly, a<lb/> number of Canadian jurisdictions have provided continuing medical education grants to enable attendance<lb/> at conferences, short courses and education programmes.<lb/></figure>

			<head>6.3 Regulatory policies<lb/></head>

			<p>80.<lb/> Regulatory policies include federal/central government, provincial/state or local government<lb/> regulations and guidelines that impose conditions on the choice of practice location. By, for example,<lb/> restricting entry to practice in over-doctored areas, the physician workforce can, in principle, be distributed<lb/> more evenly improving the standard of care provided to rural and deprived urban communities. However,<lb/> such entry controls usually entail that physicians are displaced into areas with a lower physician density.<lb/> The resulting increase in the number of physicians is likely to reduce the average income of local<lb/> physicians if they are paid by fee-for-service or capitation. This may act as a disincentive unless financial<lb/> countermeasures are adopted.<lb/> 81.<lb/> One type of regulatory policy has made the issuance of billing numbers to physicians conditional<lb/> on their practice location. For instance, Australian physicians who have not completed postgraduate<lb/> training in a specialist field and foreign-trained physicians are only able to provide services which attract a<lb/> Medicare rebate if they work in rural and remote areas for a number of years. In Austria, physicians are not<lb/> able to get a contract with a regional health insurance fund if the threshold number of physicians is reached<lb/> in a region. In Canada, while policies of limiting billing numbers have been attempted, they did not survive<lb/> legal challenges.<lb/> 82.<lb/> Many countries do not allow physicians to practice in areas that are considered to be over-served.<lb/> It is not possible for a German physician to obtain a license in an area where the number of physicians<lb/> exceeds 110% of the number of physicians that this area needs as determined by planning. In the United<lb/> Kingdom, until April 2002, the Medical Practices Committee considered all primary care physician<lb/> applications for setting up practice in relation to the number of primary care physicians already practising<lb/> in that area allowing for factors such as rurality and deprivation. The committee would refuse an<lb/> application if the number of primary care physicians already practising in an area was considered adequate,<lb/> but support applications for posts in areas which were considered to be under-served. Such a policy seems<lb/> to have provided a reasonably equitable distribution of primary care physician health care services in the<lb/> United Kingdom (<ref type="biblio">Maynard and Walker, 1997</ref>).<lb/> 83.<lb/> Policies that make immigration conditional on practice location have been used to increase<lb/> supply in specific areas. In Australia, foreign-trained primary care physicians receive assistance in gaining<lb/> permanent residency and Fellowship of the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners in return for<lb/> a commitment to work in a rural area for five years. J-1 visa waivers, through which international medical<lb/> graduates can gain permanent residency status in the United States, are available for those foreign<lb/> physicians who work in federally designated physician shortage areas.<lb/> 84.<lb/> New technologies such as telemedicine have the potential to increase the supply of physicians in<lb/> rural areas by facilitating professional communication and collaboration over large distances, by<lb/> supporting continuing medical education and by increasing remote access by patients to medical services.<lb/> A variety of experimental and practical applications of telemedicine exist and are still being refined in<lb/> countries such as Canada, Japan, New Zealand and the United States. However, little evidence has been<lb/> assembled yet on the relative costs and benefits of these applications. Moreover, a number of policy issues<lb/> relating to: protection of privacy; service standards; health professional licensure; reimbursement for<lb/> services; and liability-insurance coverage, still need to be addressed.<lb/></p>

			<head>6.4 Financial policies<lb/></head>

			<p>85.<lb/> A variety of financial incentives have been used by OECD countries to attract and retain<lb/> physicians in rural and deprived urban areas by increasing their income.<lb/> 86.<lb/> Some countries have introduced programmes of regionally differentiated remuneration, in which<lb/> payments to physicians for patients from rural or deprived areas have been increased relative to those for<lb/> patients from other areas. In Canada, physicians in the Québec jurisdiction receive 115% of the Medicare<lb/> basic fee if they practice in remote and isolated regions, 100% in intermediate regions, and 70% in all other<lb/> areas for the first three years of practice. <ref type="biblio">Bolduc et al. (1996)</ref> reported evidence that this policy increased<lb/> the number of physicians practising in rural and deprived urban areas. A similar programme was<lb/> introduced in the United Kingdom in which physicians receive higher capitation payments for patients<lb/> from deprived areas. Until 1999, fee-for-service primary care physicians in recognised rural areas in New<lb/> Zealand could claim a rural bonus payment of 10% of regular fees and of 25% of regular fees for home<lb/> visits.<lb/> 87.<lb/> A range of other policies have been introduced that provide financial support to attract and retain<lb/> physicians in rural areas. Policies that provide financial support for the initial set-up costs of practices in a<lb/> rural area have been implemented in Austria, Canada and the United Kingdom. Canada and the United<lb/> Kingdom also provide special travel allowances for rural practices. Grants supporting relocation to rural<lb/> and remote areas have been introduced in Australia, Canada and the United Kingdom. Financial support of<lb/> locum programmes has been made available in Australia, Canada and the United States. Canada and the<lb/> United Kingdom have targeted payments at supporting on-call duty in rural areas. These programmes seem<lb/> to have had some success in increasing the supply of physicians in rural areas (<ref type="biblio">Bolduc et al., 1996; Holub<lb/> and Williams, 1996</ref>). However, it is unclear whether such policies are more or less costly than educational<lb/> or regulatory approaches.<lb/></p>

			<head>6.5 Other policies<lb/></head>

			<p>88.<lb/> There is some evidence that the effectiveness of the policies mentioned above that focus on the<lb/> physician can be further enhanced by supporting occupational opportunities for spouse/partner, education<lb/> of children and accommodation. 8 To address the issue of the geographic distribution of physicians fully,<lb/> however, such policies may need to be accompanied by initiatives that enhance the economic and social<lb/> viability of local communities in rural and deprived urban areas.<lb/></p>

			<head>7 POLICIES AFFECTING THE SPECIALITY COMPOSITION OF THE PHYSICIAN<lb/> WORKFORCE<lb/></head>

			<p>89.<lb/> Differences are observed in the speciality composition of the physician workforce. In particular,<lb/> there is substantial variation in the proportion of practising physicians who are generalists across countries<lb/> (see <ref type="figure">Figure 17</ref>). In 2000, generalist physicians in Denmark, the Netherlands, Portugal and the Slovak<lb/> Republic made up less than 20% of practising physicians, whereas this proportion exceeded 50% in<lb/> Australia, Austria, Mexico, New Zealand and Switzerland. Meanwhile, the proportion of physicians who<lb/> are generalists has been declining in most of the OECD countries for which data were available.<lb/> Presumably, this is a consequence of the growing knowledge base and complexity of medicine.<lb/></p>

			<figure>8.<lb/> See, for instance, Rolfe et al. (1995), Kamien (1998) and Rabinowitz et al. (1999).<lb/> Figure 13.<lb/> Proportion of practising physicians who are generalists, 1990-2000<lb/> 69.2<lb/> 59.4<lb/> 53.2<lb/> 51.9<lb/> 50.7<lb/> 48.8<lb/> 47.5<lb/> 32.7<lb/> 43.6<lb/> 31.8<lb/> 29.7<lb/> 16.6<lb/> 19.1<lb/> 14.3<lb/> 69.2<lb/> 63.9<lb/> 62.2<lb/> 59.9<lb/> 54.3<lb/> 53<lb/> 50.3<lb/> 41.6<lb/> 41.6<lb/> 40.9<lb/> 28.1<lb/> 25<lb/> 19.9<lb/> 17.3<lb/> 0<lb/> 1 0<lb/> 2 0<lb/> 3 0<lb/> 4 0<lb/> 5 0<lb/> 6 0<lb/> 7 0<lb/> 8 0<lb/> New Zealand<lb/> Mexico<lb/> Austria<lb/> Australia<lb/> Switzerland<lb/> France<lb/> Canada<lb/> Germany<lb/> United States<lb/> United Kingdom<lb/> Norway<lb/> Portugal<lb/> Denmark<lb/> Netherlands<lb/> Proportion of practising physicians who are generalists<lb/> 1990<lb/> 2000<lb/></figure>

			<p>Notes:<lb/> -Data for Germany for 1990 refer to 1991.<lb/> -Generalist physicians are the sum of general practitioners and other general physicians. General practitioners (also<lb/> denoted by the terms &apos;primary care physicians&apos; and &apos;family doctors&apos;) are general physicians who provide care to<lb/> undifferentiated patients at the point of first contact and take continuing responsibility for providing the patient&apos;s care.<lb/> Data exclude paediatricians and other physicians providing care to specific groups of patients. Other general<lb/> physicians refer to other general physicians who are not general practitioners, either because they provide care to a<lb/> differentiated group of patients or because they do not take continuous responsibility for providing the patient&apos;s care.<lb/> An example is generalist physicians working in hospitals.<lb/> -Data for Greece refer to the proportion of general practitioners in the physician workforce.<lb/></p>

			<p>90.<lb/> Many OECD countries still see value in a &apos;primary-care-led&apos; health care system. If OECD<lb/> countries wish to increase the number of primary care physicians in the workforce, they can take two main<lb/> avenues to promote the choice of a primary care speciality by medical students. A first avenue is through<lb/> the medical training environment, with medical schools emphasising primary care training in the medical<lb/> degree curriculum, augmenting exposure to primary care experiences during residency, or appointing<lb/> highly-rated primary care physicians to academic positions to act as role models. There is evidence that<lb/> residency experiences and role models affect the choice of speciality. 9 A survey of American residents<lb/> 9.<lb/> See, for instance, <ref type="biblio">Henderson et al. (1996)</ref>, Pitts (1997) and <ref type="biblio">Griffith et al. (2000).<lb/></ref> showed that exposure to specific types of clinical practice was rated the most important factor affecting the<lb/> choice between surgical and primary care residency (<ref type="biblio">Woodworth et al., 2001</ref>).<lb/> 91.<lb/> A second type of policy designed to attract medical students to primary care specialities takes<lb/> into account economic factors such as the level of indebtedness in health care systems where students<lb/> finance their medical studies, remuneration levels and working conditions. U.S. studies have shown that<lb/> students who are more concerned about the level of debt are more likely to choose non-primary care<lb/> specialities (<ref type="biblio">Malloy and Stroup-Benham, 2001; Woodworth et al., 2001</ref>). Therefore, policies offering<lb/> scholarships may attract more medical students to primary care specialities. There is also evidence that<lb/> medical students increasingly choose those specialities that offer a more regular work schedule, more<lb/> leisure time and higher earnings (<ref type="biblio">McKay, 1990; Thornton and Esposto, 2003</ref>). Indeed, these studies<lb/> suggest that work schedule and leisure time are more important than remuneration level in determining<lb/> choice of speciality, presumably reflecting a desire among physicians to balance professional life and<lb/> social commitments.<lb/></p>

			<head>8 POLICIES AFFECTING PRODUCTIVITY OF PRACTISING PHYSICIANS<lb/></head>

			<p>92.<lb/> The supply of physician services is determined by the number of practising physicians in<lb/> combination with their activity levels and productivity. Productivity may be affected by remuneration<lb/> methods and levels. OECD countries have adopted a range of methods for remunerating physicians. In<lb/> addition, many countries have changed the method by which they pay physicians with a view to finding a<lb/> better balance between stimulation of productivity and cost-containment. The following section contains a<lb/> review of payment methods and reforms to payment methods across countries. It explores the impact of<lb/> single payment methods on the quantity and quality of medical services delivered by physicians and<lb/> examines the effect of mixed or blended payment methods that have been developed in an attempt to<lb/> counteract some of the adverse incentives of single payment methods.<lb/></p>

			<head>8.1 Physician payment methods in OECD countries<lb/></head>

			<p>93.<lb/> Fee-for-service, capitation and salary are, respectively, the main single methods of remunerating<lb/> physicians. Under fee-for-service, physicians receive a fee for each item or unit of care that they provide.<lb/> Under capitation, they receive a periodic lump sum per patient to cover all the health care that patients<lb/> require (at the physicians&apos; discretion). Salaried physicians receive a lump-sum payment, usually on a<lb/> monthly basis, for a specified number of hours of work.<lb/> 94.<lb/> There is considerable variation in how OECD countries pay their physicians and often variations<lb/> within countries across the private and public sectors (see <ref type="table">Table 7</ref>). Some countries that finance most<lb/> health care through taxation, employ primary care physicians directly and pay them a salary (such as in<lb/> Greece, Portugal, Spain and Sweden), whereas in others, primary care physicians are self-employed and<lb/> are paid by a mix of capitation, salary and fee-for-service (such as in Australia, Denmark, New Zealand,<lb/> Norway and the United Kingdom). Office-based physicians in insurance-based health care systems tend to<lb/> be independent contractors who are paid mainly by fee-for-service, as in Austria, Belgium, France,<lb/> Germany, Japan, Korea, Switzerland and the United States (Medicare). Specialists who work in hospitals<lb/> are generally paid by salary in the public sector, and by fee-for-service in the private sector.<lb/></p>

			<head>8.2 Policies that use single payment methods to influence quantity of care<lb/></head>

			<p>95.<lb/> What is the evidence on the effects on physician productivity of the different single payment<lb/> methods? Salary payment has been shown to reduce the quantity of medical services as compared with fee-<lb/>for-service, with capitation having a similar, but more subdued, effect. In their systematic review of the<lb/> literature, <ref type="biblio">Gosden et al. (1999)</ref> concluded that salary payment is associated with fewer tests and referrals<lb/> than both fee-for-service and capitation, and fewer procedures per patient, lower throughput of patients per<lb/> physician, longer consultations and more preventive care when compared with fee-for-service alone.<lb/> Studies from Canada, Germany, Norway and the United States have found that salaried primary care<lb/> physicians had fewer visits per patient and a lower number of, but longer consultations than physicians<lb/> paid on a fee-for-service basis. 10 There was scant evidence about the effect of salary payment on health<lb/> outcomes. Two U.S. studies, which are now dated, showed that specialist physicians who were paid on a<lb/> salary basis ordered fewer tests and had a lower rate of surgery than fee-for-service specialist physicians<lb/> (<ref type="biblio">Wilson and Longhmire, 1978; Epstein et al., 1986</ref>). An English study comparing primary care physicians<lb/> paid by capitation and fee-for-service with salaried primary care physicians found no differences in the<lb/> quality of care they provided (<ref type="biblio">Gosden et al., 2003</ref>).<lb/> 96.<lb/> In Norway, the effect of salary payment on the quantity of medical services delivered by primary<lb/> care physicians was diluted by clinical factors. Kristiansen and <ref type="biblio">Holtedahl (1993)</ref> showed that fee-for-<lb/>service increased the volume of home visits compared to salary payment, but that the effect of the payment<lb/> method was less important than the influence of patient characteristics. The precedence of clinical over<lb/> financial concerns was confirmed by <ref type="biblio">Grytten and Sorensen (2001)</ref>, who found no differences in the<lb/> number of examinations between salaried physicians and physicians paid on a fee-for-service basis. These<lb/> authors argued that the primacy of clinical concerns is mainly due to strong peer control in Norway.<lb/> 97.<lb/> Denmark has paid primary care physicians both on a fee-for-service basis and on a capitation<lb/> basis. In an experiment conducted in Copenhagen, primary care physicians moved from fully capitated<lb/> payment to mixed payment based on capitation and fee-for-service, resulting in an increase of services that<lb/> provided extra fees such as consultations and diagnostic and curative services, and a decrease in rates of<lb/> referral and prescriptions (<ref type="biblio">Krasnick et al., 1990</ref>).<lb/> 98.<lb/> There is little evidence about the impact of fee-for-service versus capitated reimbursement for<lb/> specialist physicians in OECD countries. One U.S. study documenting a shift from fee-for-service to<lb/> capitated payment to gynaecologists found that capitation reduced the number of elective procedures,<lb/> whereas similar practice patterns were maintained for severe conditions (<ref type="biblio">Ransom et al., 1996</ref>).<lb/> 99.<lb/> In countries that have introduced a capitation system, concerns have been raised that physicians<lb/> may find it financially rewarding to select people with fewer health needs or actively discourage high-risk<lb/> people (this practice is known in the literature as &apos;cream-skimming&apos;). However, there is no conclusive<lb/> evidence about its occurrence. Although the healthier mix of enrollees of U.S. managed care organisations<lb/> (<ref type="biblio">Congressional Budget Office, 1994</ref>) may be the result of the selection of favourable risks, this may also<lb/> reflect patient preferences. There is little more than anecdotal evidence of its occurrence in the United<lb/> Kingdom. There have been reports of an increase in the proportion of patients removed from fundholders&apos;<lb/> registers at the request of the primary care physician (<ref type="biblio">Glennerster et al., 1994</ref>). However, it is not clear<lb/> whether this reflects cream-skimming or is instead related to additional workload and pressures of<lb/> fundholding.<lb/> 10.<lb/> See, for instance, <ref type="biblio">Hillman et al. (1989), Maheux et al. (1990), Burkowitz et al. (1995)</ref>, Johnson and<lb/> Holtedahl (1997), Sorensen and Grytten (2003).<lb/></p>

			<head>8.3 Policies</head>

			<figure>that use blended payment methods to influence quantity of care<lb/> 100.<lb/> In order to avoid some of the adverse incentives of simple physician payment methods, while<lb/> retaining their desirable features described above, some countries have introduced mixed or blended<lb/> payment methods for physicians.<lb/></figure>

			<head>8.3.1 Blended payment methods<lb/></head>

			<p>101.<lb/> Blended payment methods that combine a fixed component through either capitation or salary<lb/> and a variable component through fee-for-service for specific interventions may produce a more desirable<lb/> mix of incentives than any single payment method. Such methods have been used to promote the provision<lb/> of medical services that are deemed to be cost-effective or to counteract the impact of a certain payment<lb/> method on physician activity levels.<lb/> 102.<lb/> A basic capitation or salary remuneration can be mixed with a set of specific target payments to<lb/> primary care physicians to promote the provision of particularly cost-effective services, such as<lb/> vaccinations, immunisations and early detection of cancer services. Target allowances for preventive care<lb/> have been paid to primary care physicians in Australia, Portugal and the United Kingdom. However, if<lb/> targets are set unreasonably high, target payments may become a disincentive to increasing physician<lb/> activity. Moreover, once the highest target is reached, there is no additional financial reward to cover the<lb/> remaining population. Target payments may also incite physicians to game the system by prioritising those<lb/> dimensions of output that attract a financial reward at the expense of other areas of performance that are<lb/> not subject to financial incentives.<lb/> 103.<lb/> Some countries have combined fee-for-service payments with lump sums to influence physician<lb/> practice patterns in a specific way. In France, primary care physicians who sign up to be &apos;referring<lb/> physicians&apos; (gatekeepers) receive an annual lump sum for general patient monitoring in addition to fee-for-<lb/>service payment. Fee-for-service payments have also been attached to costly procedures, such as specific<lb/> medications and medical equipment, to offset disincentives not to provide these services under capitation<lb/> payment. This practice is used in some health maintenance organisations in the United States to reduce the<lb/> risk that capitated physicians would bear if such services did not attract a specific payment.<lb/></p>

			<head>8.3.2 Financial incentives at individual and collective levels of the physician workforce<lb/></head>

			<p>104.<lb/> Fee-for-service payments paid by third payers who simply reimburse fees charged by physicians,<lb/> combined with no controls on the services actually delivered, can lead to high prices, unnecessary service<lb/> utilisation and rising expenditures (<ref type="biblio">Barnum et al., 1995</ref>).<lb/> 105.<lb/> Therefore, some countries have adopted approaches to offset the incentive under fee-for-service<lb/> reimbursement for individual physicians to increase volume with collective incentives to contain health<lb/> expenditure. In order to contain costs, Germany has experimented with regulated fee or point schedules<lb/> with limits on the total value of payments. Global budgets are negotiated between associations of sickness<lb/> funds and primary care physicians, with physicians being reimbursed on the basis of points per service. At<lb/> the end of the reimbursement period, the value of a point is determined according to the volume of services<lb/> to keep total expenditures within the global budget. However, this system can create an incentive for<lb/> individual physicians to maintain their income by expanding even more the volume of services, which in<lb/> turn further reduces the monetary conversion factors. To counteract such behaviour, regional physician<lb/> associations monitor the volume of services provided by primary care physicians and financially penalise<lb/> those physicians with higher-than-average service volumes that cannot be attributed to case mix.<lb/> Moreover, a lump-sum component is added to the remuneration package of primary care physicians to<lb/> avoid an excessive expansion of physician activity.<lb/> 106.<lb/> Some OECD countries have either frozen or reduced fee levels in an attempt to contain health<lb/> expenditure. Japan, for instance, has not only controlled fee increases generally, but also has selectively<lb/> reduced fees for procedures that show &apos;inappropriate&apos; volume expansion. It has also restrained the prices of<lb/> some surgical and high-tech hospital treatments, relative to primary care-based services, thus providing an<lb/> incentive to substitute primary care for hospital-based care. The adoption of &apos;resource-based relative value<lb/> scales&apos; in Canada, Korea and the United States has produced changes in relative fees, increasing relative<lb/> remuneration for services, such as consultations with primary care physicians, and reducing it for<lb/> procedure-based services, such as surgery and diagnostic testing.<lb/> 107.<lb/> An issue that has not received much attention in the literature is the institutional mechanisms<lb/> through which governments of OECD countries have attempted to influence fee levels with a view to<lb/> controlling physician income and containing health expenditure. Box 6 explores the process of collective<lb/> bargaining in countries that pay physicians by fee-for-service under systems of national health insurance in<lb/> terms of the stakeholders involved in this process, how the negotiation process takes place, and the power<lb/> balance between stakeholders.<lb/></p>

			<figure>Box 6. Process and outcomes of collective bargaining of fee levels<lb/></figure>

			<p>Collective bargaining over fee levels is often undertaken by government and representative associations of health<lb/> insurance funds on one side of the negotiating table and by physicians&apos; associations on the other. Consumers and<lb/> patients are generally not formally represented at such negotiations. The strong role of representative associations<lb/> underscores the importance of collective bargaining, rather than individual contracting, in the health care systems of<lb/> Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, Korea, the Netherlands and Switzerland. This contrasts sharply with the United<lb/> States where labour and antitrust laws prevent physicians from forming collective bargaining units to negotiate with<lb/> managed care organisations.<lb/></p>

			<head>11<lb/></head>

			<p>In Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, Japan, Korea, the Netherlands and Switzerland, the Government<lb/> has generally operated as a key actor in the decision-making network, even though its involvement in the negotiating<lb/> process has often remained indirect. Governments have circumscribed the scope of the negotiations and have<lb/> imposed unilateral agreements, by implementing binding fee schedules in Belgium, France, Korea and Switzerland,<lb/> and by introducing fee adjustments and expenditure caps in Canada, Germany and Japan. Health insurance funds<lb/> have acted more or less as the natural allies of Government as they share the goal of cost control.<lb/></p>

			<p>Although medical associations participate in the bargaining process on behalf of physicians, their members<lb/> have not always endorsed the agreements that have been struck. In the Netherlands, the National Association of<lb/> Medical Specialists lost part of its membership because many specialists became dissatisfied about the representation<lb/> of their interests by the Association in the negotiations. Two new medical associations were created and some medical<lb/> societies asked to be recognised as representative organisations. Some physicians also went to court to challenge the<lb/> legitimacy of a collective agreement that had been accepted by their medical association (<ref type="biblio">Lieverdink and Maarse,<lb/> 1995</ref>).<lb/> Collective bargaining over fee levels has often provided an effective institutional arrangement to reconcile<lb/> the conflicting goals of government and health insurers on the one hand and medical associations on the other hand.<lb/> The regular occurrence of negotiating rounds has encouraged the stakeholders to sustain workable relations. On the<lb/> other hand, reaching a consensus has sometimes required a lengthy negotiating process and conflict has sometimes<lb/> been displaced from the negotiating table to the health care arena (<ref type="biblio">Lieverdink and Maarse, 1995 and Marchand,<lb/> 2003</ref>).<lb/> 108.<lb/> Policies that have attempted to curb health expenditure by controlling fee levels can be eroded if<lb/> physicians increase the quantity of medical services that they deliver (as in ambulatory care in Australia<lb/> 11.<lb/> The National Labor Relations Act states that self-employed physicians or employees who act as managers<lb/> or supervisors in the course of providing clinical care cannot become unionised. Moreover, any sort of co-<lb/>ordinated activity by physicians for economic purposes (without resorting to formal unionisation) would<lb/> likely run foul of federal antitrust law (<ref type="biblio">Choudhry and Brennan, 2001</ref>).<lb/> and Japan) or switch the mix of services towards those that attract higher fees (such as in provision of more<lb/> on-site diagnostic services, as in France and Germany) (OECD, 2003b). Such behaviour may or may not be<lb/> desirable depending on whether the extra services are cost-effective or not. In Belgium and Korea, fee<lb/> reductions have led to some substitution of services with high margins for those with low margins (<ref type="biblio">Kwon,<lb/> 2003; Marchand, 2003</ref>). Recent U.S. studies suggest that the response of specialist physicians to reductions<lb/> in fee levels is complex, depending on a mix of factors including: the margins that can be earned on<lb/> different medical services; the relative market shares for medical services; the share of physician income<lb/> generated by specific medical services; the ability of physicians to induce demand; the response of demand<lb/> to physician inducement; and time costs. 12 Fee controls may also produce shifts towards areas where fee<lb/> levels are not limited. In Greece, where social insurance reimbursement rates for physician visits are set at<lb/> relatively low levels, physicians tend to shift patients to private practice (OECD, 2003b).<lb/></p>

			<head>8.4 Policies that use physician payment method to influence the quality of care<lb/></head>

			<p>109.<lb/> Against a background of growing evidence on shortcomings in quality of care (<ref type="biblio">Chassin et al.,<lb/> 1998; Newhouse, 2002</ref>), OECD countries are showing increasing interest in paying physicians by results,<lb/> i.e. rewarding physicians for the quality of care both in terms of health improvements and responsiveness<lb/> to their patients.<lb/> 110.<lb/> Payment methods that reward primary care physicians for quality are being implemented in both<lb/> Australia and the United Kingdom. Since 1994, Australia has implemented incentives that originally<lb/> rewarded physicians who spend more time with patients and that are now linked to performance on a range<lb/> of quality indicators. In the United Kingdom, from April 2004, about a fifth of the income of primary care<lb/> physicians will be based on 146 indicators of quality, such as: keeping a register of patients with<lb/> hypertension; recording smoking status for such patients; and recording whether such patients who smoke<lb/> have been offered smoking cessation advice at least once. Another approach has been to give salaried<lb/> physicians merit pay for good performance. In the United Kingdom, senior specialist physicians are<lb/> eligible for a distinction award if they meet objectives such as the adoption of high standards of clinical<lb/> care; adoption of patient-centred care; commitment to service targets; participation in clinical governance;<lb/> and use of evidence-based practice (Department of <ref type="biblio">Health, 2002</ref>).<lb/> 111.<lb/> However, there is not much evidence, so far, about the results of attempts to reward physicians<lb/> for the quality of the care they deliver and there remain many difficulties in designing an objective<lb/> performance appraisal system (<ref type="biblio">Ullrich, 1997</ref>). The worries about systems of payment which try to reward<lb/> quality include whether they may distort practice between areas where quality can be measured and areas<lb/> where it cannot; whether they may encourage selection of less risky patients; and whether they may distort<lb/> record keeping. Such schemes require careful monitoring and regulation.<lb/></p>

			<head>9 CONCLUDING REMARKS<lb/></head>

			<p>112.<lb/> OECD countries have very different densities of physicians per million population, reflecting<lb/> variations in morbidity and mortality, variations in levels of health expenditure and differences in the<lb/> design of health systems. There are signs that higher levels of staffing are found in countries which have<lb/> not tried to restrict entry to medical schools, at least until recently, whereas lower levels of staffing are<lb/> found in those countries that have planned and controlled entry into physician training for many years.<lb/> 113.<lb/> Whereas controlling numbers of physicians can assist in securing cost-containment, there is some<lb/> evidence to suggest that it will also constrain outcomes and responsiveness. Much will depend on what is<lb/> happening to productivity. In the case of general practitioners, there is some evidence that across European<lb/> countries there is an inverse association between GP density and patient consultations per GP – which<lb/> suggests, if only weakly, that constraining GP numbers, up to a certain point, may not bring about a<lb/> proportional reduction in patient access. However, little can be said about the implications for GP<lb/> productivity because, for the time being, there is a lack of measures of quality of care.<lb/> 114.<lb/> In the face of the growing demand for the services of physicians and some tightening of the<lb/> supply, due partly to ageing of the workforce, there is growing concern about shortages of physicians in<lb/> some OECD countries.<lb/> 115.<lb/> In the medium to long term, countries which operate a numerus clausus should allow medical<lb/> school intake to rise, particularly if national self-sufficiency is a long term goal. In future, because of the<lb/> ageing of many workforces, this may involve attracting an increasing share of shrinking cohorts of young<lb/> people into physician training. Applications to medical schools greatly exceed places available in many<lb/> countries, which implies that there should be little problem in attracting an increasing share into the<lb/> profession – although improvements to relative pay and conditions of service may be necessary to staff the<lb/> less popular specialties and regions.<lb/> 116.<lb/> International migration of doctors can increase the flexibility of the relevant labour markets,<lb/> especially in the short run, by speeding the process of reaching equilibrium. However, it raises difficult<lb/> questions about international equity when there are persistent net flows of staff from poorer countries with<lb/> low and, sometimes, declining health status to richer countries with high and rising health status.<lb/> 117.<lb/> Policies that reduce flows out of the workforce by improving retention of physicians seem to be<lb/> relatively under-developed. OECD countries need to continue to increase job flexibility to retain younger<lb/> physicians and to incite older physicians to defer retirement.<lb/> 118.<lb/> To attract and retain physicians in rural and deprived urban areas, OECD countries can introduce<lb/> educational policies that promote the admission of students who come from a rural background to medical<lb/> school, regulatory policies that impose restrictions on practice location, and financial policies that provide<lb/> financial support for practising in rural and deprived urban areas. Mixed success has been reported with<lb/> policies that provide scholarships to medical students in return for a commitment to practice in an area for<lb/> a minimum period of time. The effectiveness of policy interventions that focus on the physician, can be<lb/> enhanced by measures that support occupational opportunities for spouse/partner, education of children<lb/> and accommodation.<lb/> 119.<lb/> There are trends towards increasing specialisation in medicine at a moment when some OECD<lb/> countries are promoting a primary care-led health care system. In order to encourage the choice of a<lb/> primary care speciality by students, countries can place more emphasis on primary care training, on<lb/> exposure to primary care experiences and on introduction of primary care role models. Meanwhile, there is<lb/> evidence to suggest that it is the more favourable conditions of service, such as regular work schedules and<lb/> more leisure time, that attract students to primary care specialities.<lb/> 120.<lb/> The services delivered by physicians depend on their productivity as well as on their numbers.<lb/></p>

			<p>There has been some investigation of the effect of methods of remuneration on physician productivity. A<lb/> review of the relevant literature confirms what might be expected: that fee-for-service methods of payment<lb/> raise activity per physician compared with salaried or capitated methods of payment. However, it is not<lb/> clear what impact, if any, higher activity levels per physician have on the quality of care they deliver.<lb/> There has been much interest in, and experimentation with, physician payment methods which reward<lb/> quality of care directly in a number of countries. However, such developments continue to be constrained<lb/> by technical difficulties in measuring and monitoring quality of care across much of the range of services<lb/> provided by doctors.<lb/> 121.<lb/> This study suggests that many questions remain to be answered about the best way to match the<lb/> supply to the demand for physician services. Although a range of policy instruments for influencing supply<lb/> have been identified, there is a lack of systematic evidence about the relative effectiveness and cost-<lb/>effectiveness of using these different instruments. Similarly, much remains to be discovered about the best<lb/> way to plan for, or regulate, entry to the medical profession, given the tendency for training programmes to<lb/> experience cycles of boom and bust, arising mainly from the lags inherent in completing long professional<lb/> training courses. It would be useful to shed more light on the scale and determinants of international<lb/> migration of doctors and on the benefits and costs of such migration for the host and home countries,<lb/> respectively. Turning to productivity, further work is needed to understand what combination of policies is<lb/> best suited to motivating doctors. In particular, lessons need to be distilled from the new experiments, now<lb/> underway in some countries, to reward physicians (when it is feasible to do so) for the quality of the<lb/> services they provide.<lb/></p>
