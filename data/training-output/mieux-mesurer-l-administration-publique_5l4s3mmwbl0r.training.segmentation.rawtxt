ÉCONOMIQUES L'OCDE est un forum unique en son genre où les gouvernements de 30 démocraties oeuvrent ensemble 
pour relever les défis économiques, sociaux et environnementaux, que pose la mondialisation. L'OCDE est 
aussi à l'avant-garde des efforts entrepris pour comprendre les évolutions du monde actuel et les 
préoccupations qu'elles font naître. Elle aide les gouvernements à faire face à des situations nouvelles en 
examinant des thèmes tels que le gouvernement d'entreprise, l'économie de l'information et les défis posés 
par le vieillissement de la population. L'Organisation offre aux gouvernements un cadre leur permettant de 
comparer leurs expériences en matière de politiques, de chercher des réponses à des problèmes communs, 
d'identifier les bonnes pratiques et de travailler à la coordination des politiques nationales et 
internationales. Les pays membres de l'OCDE sont : l'Allemagne, l'Australie, l'Autriche, la Belgique, le Canada, la Corée, 
le Danemark, l'Espagne, les États-Unis, la Finlande, la France, la Grèce, la Hongrie, l'Irlande, l'Islande, 
l'Italie, le Japon, le Luxembourg, le Mexique, la Norvège, la Nouvelle-Zélande, les Pays-Bas, la Pologne, 
le Portugal, la République slovaque, la République tchèque, le Royaume-Uni, la Suède, la Suisse et la 
Turquie. La Commission des Communautés européennes participe aux travaux de l'OCDE. Cet ouvrage est publié sous la responsabilité du Secrétaire général de l'OCDE. Les opinions et les 
interprétations exprimées ne reflètent pas nécessairement les vues de l'OCDE ou des gouvernements de ses 
pays membres. GOV/PGC(2006)10 Remerciements Le projet de l'OCDE concernant « La Gestion dans l'Administration » a été initié en 2005 dans le but 
d'offrir aux gouvernements des données comparatives de grande qualité sur le secteur public. A la suite 
d'un rapport présentant la faisabilité d'un tel projet devant le Comité de Gouvernance Publique en 
novembre 2005, trois documents techniques ont été préparés qui examinent la stratégie d'ensemble du 
projet et les questions techniques concernant la mesure de la production et des résultats. Ceux-ci seront 
publiés prochainement, regroupés dans un volume sous le titre « Mesurer les actions menées par 
l'administration publique » (OCDE, à venir). Ce projet s'engage à publier le premier « Panorama des Administrations » fin 2009, qui fournira une série 
d'indicateurs concernant les activités du secteur public. Ce document de travail initial résume l'approche choisie, et présente les données disponibles pour l'instant. 
C'est une avancée modeste vers le but final, mais qui a son importance. Parvenir à trouver un large 
consensus sur l'approche qui définie ce que recouvre le secteur public et la classification des indicateurs, 
représente un jalon important. Présenter dans un seule publication la somme des données qui sont 
disponibles actuellement en constitue un autre. Ces succès sont dus en grande partie aux excellents conseils techniques offerts par trois groupes éditoriaux 
non officiels qui comprennent des experts reconnus dans leur domaine respectif -gouvernemental, 
académique -travaillant à l'OCDE (voir http://www.oecd.org/gov/indicators pour plus d'informations) et 
en collaboration étroite avec d'autres Directions de l'OCDE (en particulier le Département économique et 
la Division statistique). L'ensemble de données est le résultat d'un travail technique détaillé effectué 
pendant un certain nombre d'années par les équipes des Directions GOV et ECO de l'OCDE ; Ce projet a été dirigé par Nick Manning, Jana Malinska et Dirk-Jan Kraan (OECD GOV).

« MIEUX MESURER L'ADMINISTRATION PUBLIQUE » 
DOCUMENT DE TRAVAIL ÉDITION 1 INTRODUCTION L'OCDE réunit des données comparables sur la gestion publique dans ses pays membres depuis 1994. 
Depuis cette année-là, son Service de la gestion publique (PUMA) fournit, dans le cadre de sa collecte des 
statistiques pour la base de données sur l'emploi et les rémunérations dans le secteur public (PSPE), des 
analyses des grandes tendances relatives aux traitements et à l'emploi dans le secteur public. Dans le 
contexte actuel de poursuite des réformes de leur secteur public par les pays de l'OCDE, il est de plus en 
plus nécessaire de disposer de données de meilleure qualité permettant de contrôler les actions prises à 
l'aune de la réalité et de fournir des orientations pour l'avenir. Le présent Document de travail compile un ensemble de données comparables récentes sur les 
recettes, les intrants et les processus du secteur public dans les pays de l'OCDE et propose une approche 
pour les collectes de données ultérieures. Il s'agit du premier Document de travail annuel d'un groupe de 
trois documents que la Direction de la Gouvernance publique et du Développement territorial de l'OCDE 
publiera, en vue de la parution fin 2009 d'une étude biennale majeure intitulée « Panorama des 
administrations ». Ce document est accompagné d'une publication intitulé « Mesurer les actions menées 
par l'administration publique » (OCDE, à venir) qui présente l'approche proposée et soumet différentes 
alternatives techniques à l'analyse et à l'avis des experts. 1 La première partie de cette publication offre une 
analyse détaillée de la classification des données et de l'analyse choisies. L'élaboration de la méthodologie a été supervisée par trois groupes éditoriaux informels comprenant 
des experts gouvernementaux et des universitaires de l'ensemble des pays de l'OCDE (voir 
http://www.oecd.org/gov/indicators pour plus d'informations), en étroite collaboration avec d'autres 
Directions de l'OCDE (plus particulièrement le Département des Affaires économiques et la Direction des 
Statistiques). Ce projet…

les gouvernements membres GOV/PGC(2006)10 L'APPROCHE PROPOSÉE 1. Pourquoi mesurer l'administration publique ? La manière dont les activités de l'administration sont mesurées a une grande importance. 1.1. La taille de l'administration publique Compte tenu de la taille de l'administration publique et de son rôle dans l'économie, la contribution de 
l'administration à la croissance économique nationale est d'une importance considérable, en particulier 
lorsque l'on envisage les taux d'évolution sur le long terme. Des travaux menés récemment au Royaume-
Uni montrent que la modification de la base utilisée pour mesurer l'activité de l'administration peut 
considérablement accroître ou diminuer la taille du PIB 2 . Au-delà de l'aspect purement économique, il est 
important de mesurer l'activité de l'administration en raison de la taille de ses activités et de la nécessité 
consécutive de comprendre ce qu'elle accomplit avec les dépenses considérables qu'elle engage (au sein de 
l'OCDE, entre 36 % et 57 % du PIB en 2004). Ses réalisations, ou absence de réalisations, se définissent 
par la qualité et la nature des biens et des services qu'elle fournit, par ses activités de redistribution et par 
la nature de la régulation qu'elle exerce sur les comportements du marché et ceux des individus. 1.2. Nous disposons de peu d'information pour nous guider dans sa réforme Un problème persistant caractérise les recommandations pour la réforme de la gestion publique : très 
rarement basées sur des évaluations empiriques, ces recommandations tiennent, en pratique, souvent 
davantage aux tendances à la mode en matière de politiques publiques qu'elles ne reposent sur des preuves 
tangibles ; en outre, elles n'hésitent pas à s'autoproclamer, sans fondement, « meilleures pratiques ». 
L'OCDE est l'une des rares sources de données comparatives faisant autorité en matière de gestion 
publique, mais, globalement, très peu de données sont disponibles, ce qui constitue un problème inquiétant, 
largement reconnu comme tel dans toutes les analyses récentes des réformes de la gestion publique. 2. Quelle sera l'utilité de « Panorama des administrations » ? Cette publication biennale relèvera le défi de fournir des données capables d'aider les gouvernements 
et autres analystes dans deux domaines principaux : 1. Grâce à l'utilisation d'unités d'analyse communes, elle permettra à chaque pays d'effectuer des 
comparaisons solides de sa situation avec celle des autres pays et facilitera ainsi la mise en place 
d'un dialogue structuré entre praticiens. 2. A plus long terme, elle contribuera à fournir aux pays membres des enseignements concernant : − l'efficience du secteur public et l'efficacité des institutions, permettant ainsi de mieux 
comprendre les résultats de la prestation de service par différents dispositifs institutionnels et 
gestionnaires. − les relations observées (quelles modifications des processus de secteur public sont associées à 
des changements dans les résultats du secteur public) − la capacité d'absorption (l'impact sur la productivité des contraintes budgétaires souples à la 
suite de hausses importantes dans les dépenses du secteur, et inversement). GOV/PGC(2006)10 3. En quoi cette publication complétera-t-elle les autres ensembles de données internationales ? « Panorama des administrations » viendra compléter les autres publications « Panoramas » de l'OCDE. 
Elle diffèrera des autres grands ensembles de données sur la gouvernance sur plusieurs points centraux, 
bien qu'elle tire les leçons de leurs expériences. Les Indicateurs mondiaux de la gouvernance de la Banque mondiale et l'Indice de perceptions de la 
corruption fournissent des évaluations agrégées de la gouvernance au niveau national 3 . A l'inverse, 
« Panorama des administrations » fournira des données permettant à chaque pays de s'auto-évaluer. Cette 
approche est cohérente avec les autres publications « Panoramas » de l'OCDE et est similaire à celle 
adoptée par la base de données « Doing Business » de la Banque mondiale, qui fournit une vaste gamme 
des données. A l'instar des autres publications « Panoramas » de l'OCDE, les données réunies permettent 
d'établir des distinctions nuancées entre les pays de l'OCDE, reflet de leurs traditions administratives et 
sociales uniques. Les indicateurs plus agrégés ont tendance à montrer l'ensemble des pays de l'OCDE 
comme étant similaires sur la plupart des points. « Panorama des administrations » utilisera certains ensembles de données internationales mentionnés ci-
dessus, mais cela aura principalement lieu dans la phase ultérieure de collecte des données sur les résultats. 
Les données d'enquête utilisées pour l'élaboration des indicateurs de la Banque mondiale sur la 
gouvernance et celle de « Doing Business » peuvent respectivement permettre une compréhension utile des 
attitudes du public envers l'administration publique et de l'impact des politiques réglementaires. La 
présentation interactive sur Internet de ces ensembles de données a établi un précédent élevé en matière de 
facilité d'accès aux informations. GOV/PGC(2006)10 4. Quelle stratégie adopter pour y arriver ? 4.1. Une approche prudente L'élaboration d'indicateurs sur la gestion publique suppose de faire un choix stratégique fondamental 
entre les deux options suivantes : 1. Commencer par une approche générale en réunissant des données statistiques agrégées sur les 
différentes étapes clés du processus de production du secteur public pour passer ensuite 
progressivement à des analyses spécifiques. 2. Commencer par des études spécifiques approfondies – par exemple la définition des coûts 
individuels des différentes réalisations des services publics. Autres publications « Panoramas » de l'OCDE Panorama de la

demande des hauts responsables cherchant à connaître la performance des structures et processus de leur 
pays par rapport à ceux des autres pays. Commencer par des études spécifiques approfondies nuirait à la 
capacité de « Panorama des administrations » de fournir, à courte échéance, des données comparatives. 
L'intention est de fournir une vaste gamme de données de référence en s'appuyant sur les domaines dans 
lesquels l'OCDE possède une expertise reconnue, pour réaliser ensuite des études plus spécifiques. 4.2. Vers un nouveau rôle pour l'OCDE De nombreux autres organismes et institutions développent des 
ensembles de données utiles sur la gestion publique. GOV/OCDE 
continuera à réunir des données dans certains domaines clés—fort 
de l'avantage comparatif que lui confère son accès privilégié aux 
gouvernements—mais ce rôle de collecte de données sera de plus en 
plus accompagné d'une activité de networking. Forte de son pouvoir 
unique de convocation et de son travail de définition claire des 
normes techniques et d'identification des types de données 
manquantes, la direction GOV/OCDE encouragera les autres 
fournisseurs de données à travailler sur les domaines prioritaires et à 
suivre les normes de l'OCDE. Une telle approche peut également 
offrir l'avantage supplémentaire de minimiser les doublons dans les 
enquêtes menées auprès des des pays membres de l'OCDE et ainsi 
de réduire le temps nécessaire aux enquêtes. OCDE/GOV se 
concentrera sur les informations prioritaires et cherchera de 
nouvelles données en accord avec sa stratégie globale, en soulignant 
que des outils d'étude longs et complexes peuvent s'avérer contreproductifs lorsqu'on veut obtenir des 
réponses utiles. Il sera important de signaler clairement aux chercheurs et aux praticiens les domaines dans lesquels de 
nouveaux ensembles de données pourraient permettre des analyses utiles. Les gouvernements et les 
chercheurs peuvent proposer l'inclusion de nouvelles données dans « Panorama de l'Adminstration » en 
fournissant des informations détaillées les concernant dans les questionnaires qui sont sur le site internet de 
GOV à www.oecd.org/gov/indicators. 4.3. Une approche ambitieuse mais solide sur le plan technique Le projet « Panorama des administrations » est ambitieux dans son envergure : il reconnaît que la 
description des activités des acteurs habituels des administrations—ministères, départements et 
collectivités territoriales—est importante mais qu'elle laisse de plus en plus de lacunes. De nombreuses 
activités du secteur public sont entreprises par le secteur privé ou des organismes à but non lucratif, mais 
avec un important financement public. Or, bien que ce phénomène fasse l'objet d'un bon suivi dans 
certains pays de l'OCDE, il n'existe que peu de données comparatives. Dans le cas de concessions et de 
monopoles légaux, le financement direct peut être limité, mais l'administration publique peut avoir une 
responsabilité contingente implicite. Ainsi, la publication « Panorama des administrations » mettra 
principalement l'accent sur les activités financées sur les deniers de l'État ou menées par des entreprises 
nationales, mais le test ultime pour décider de l'éventuelle inclusion de telle ou telle donnée ou analyse 
dans « Panorama des administrations » sera de savoir si ces données ou analyses fournissent des données 
comparatives permettant de comprendre les activités entreprises avec des fonds publics. Ces fonds peuvent 
aussi bien consister en un transfert direct ou être fournis sous la forme d'une garantie implicite. Encourager les contributions de la 
communauté des chercheurs La réputation de « Panorama des 
administrations » devra être telle que 
l'inclusion dans ce rapport d'un 
ensemble de données soit une marque 
d'honneur pour toute organisation 
ayant 
réunie 
des 
données 
comparatives. Atteindre cet objectif 
nécessitera d'établir un seuil de qualité 
clair pour les données, garantissant la 
cohérence des unités d'analyse, 
maximisant les opportunités pour 
autrui de proposer des données et 
encourageant les efforts de collecte 
particulier pour combler des manques 
dans les données. GOV/PGC(2006)10 Table 1: Activitités incluent dans « Panorama de l'Administration » 4 Institutional domain

National train company Le cadre développé par le SNA (System of National Accounts) offer des analyses qui sont cohérentes 
pour des secteurs publics différents et des architectures nationales elles aussi très varies, en particulier en 
ce qui concerne les jurisdictions fédérales et non fédérales. « Panorama des administrations » propose une classification ambitieuse : il propose d'inclure six 
catégories de variables : les recettes, les intrants, les processus du secteur public ; les réalisations ; les 
résultats ; et les antécédents ou contraintes qui remettent l'efficience et l'efficacité des administrations 
publiques dans leur contexte. GOV/PGC(2006)10 Cette classification a pour fonction de fournir des informations sur des unités d'analyse identiques ou 
similaires. 
Lorsque 
les 
attributions sont claires et 
que, par exemple, les 
réalisations mesurables dans 
un 
secteur/pays 
donné 
peuvent raisonnablement être 
mises en relation avec des 
intrants et des processus 
mesurables spécifiques, les 
processus de production 
constituent alors un moyen 
raisonnable d'envisager les 
données. Lorsque tel n'est 
pas le cas, ces processus 
constituent 
de 
simples 
catégories de mesure pouvant être comparées avec celles d'autres pays et dans la durée. L'utilisation du 
cadre basé sur le SNA permettra aussi une comparaison des activités dans les secteurs publics ayant des 
architectures institutionnelles très différentes. Les classifications proposées offrent une ambition supplémentaire. Par exemple, dans la prise en 
compte des résultats, « Panorama des administrations » utilise une sous-classification « COFOG 
modifiée » laquelle présente une répartition des dépenses entre les biens principalement individuels et les 
biens principalement collectifs, ainsi qu'entre les transferts de biens en nature et les transferts d'argent. En 
considérant les intrants, les « Panorama des administrations » rajoute ainsi également une sous-
classification « modes de production » qui permet de mieux comprendre la nature des intrants utilisés : 
main-d'oeuvre, fourniture de biens et de services, placements de capitaux bruts, prestations sociales en 
nature et subventions. Ces subtilités de la classification permettent de faire certaines comparaisons 
intéressantes et de mettre en lumière les politiques gouvernementales implicites. Structures les variables incluent dans « Panorama de l'Administration » dans une classification des 
processus de production ne veut pas dire que ce flux idéalisé d'intrants et de résultats qui en découlent 
peut toujours être déterminé en pratique. Comme on le verra plus loin, il y a bon nombre de situations où 
les problèmes d'attribution entre les différents stages sont si significatifs qu'aucune relation simple ne peut 
être déterminée. Disaggregated public sector production process 6 Input Activities

oeuvre diffèrent de pays en pays et évoluent au fil du temps. De façon délibérée, cette publication ne visera 
pas à examiner les questions relatives aux résultats recherchés par les gouvernements. La publication n'aura recours que très prudemment aux indicateurs composites, dans la mesure où 
ceux-ci ne fournissent qu'un degré de précision trompeur pour le classement des différents pays. Elle 
suggère de procéder à une certaine expérimentation dans des domaines limités après évaluation des risques 
impliqués. Elle constate également qu'un autre type d'indicateurs pourrait susciter un intérêt pour le 
projet : les « indicateurs dérivés ». Ces derniers pourraient ainsi permettre de montrer à quel point chaque 
pays a permis l'accès à ses données pour faciliter l'établissement de comparaisons avec les autres pays, ou 
encore d'identifier les processus du secteur public pour lesquels il existe des séries chronologiques et une 
variation importante entre deux dates. GOV/PGC(2006)10 5. Le point de départ 5.1. Données en stock Plus de 1 000 variables (principalement les 
questions des enquêtes menées), réunies par GOV au 
cours d'enquêtes précédentes, ont été étudiées pour en 
déterminer la sensibilité en vue de cette publication, 
l'exactitude, le format et l'unité d'analyse. L'utilisation 
faite de ces données dans des rapports publiés a 
également été étudiée. Une centaine de variables semblent être pertinents 
pour les politiques publiques et méritent donc d'être 
inclus dans le présent Document de travail. Les données peuvent être grossièrement classées 
dans les catégories présentées dans le tableau ci-contre. 
Seuls deux ensembles de données contiennent des séries 
chronologiques (ceux extraites de la base de données 
budgétaires et ceux concernant les traitements et 
l'emploi dans le secteur public) et d'importants défis 
conceptuels et de définition sont associés à ces deux 
groupes. 5.2. Que peut-on apprendre des données à notre 
disposition ? Ces données peuvent servir à la réalisation 
d'analyses comparatives. En matière de gestion 
publique, l'OCDE est surtout sollicitée, par les hauts 
responsables cherchant à comparer les structures et 
processus de leur pays avec celles d'autres pays, pour fournir des données comparatives de base. Les ensembles de données existants permettent de réaliser des comparaisons élémentaires : @BULLET Les données sur les recettes des collectivités territoriales permettent de comparer le degré de 
décentralisation fiscale. @BULLET Les données sur la répartition globale des intrants permettent de comparer les choix effectués par 
les administrations en matière d'utilisation des dépenses en vue de la fourniture de biens et 
services en nature et pourraient mener à une discussion spécifique au secteur du choix entre 
prestation en interne ou sous-traitance. @BULLET Les données sur les intrants relatifs à la main-d'oeuvre, dans leur cadre modifié et mieux adapté 
aux comparaisons, permettront de comparer la taille des effectifs du secteur public – donnant lieu 
à des débats plus réalistes sur la participation de l'État dans l'économie. @BULLET Les mesures des différents processus et dispositifs institutionnels rendent possible un échange 
réaliste entre praticiens et décideurs politiques concernant certaines mesures des réformes. Données actuellement disponibles RECETTES Structure des recettes

droits et l'application éventuelle de frais d'utilisation. 6. Grands points de comparaison 7 6.1. Recettes (Collectivités territoriales) Structure des recettes 
Les collectivités territoriales bénéficient de leurs 
propres recettes (lesquelles peuvent être divisées en 
« taxes autonomes » --impôts sur lesquels les 
collectivités territoriales ont pleine autorité --et en 
« taxes partagées » offrant différents degrés 
d'autonomie), ainsi que de subventions 
intergouvernementales, lesquelles peuvent être 
affectées à des fins particulières. 
(Contacts : H. Blöchliger, C. Charbit, D. Bergvall) L'Indicateur RS1 montre la source principale des 
recettes des collectivités locales : 
@BULLET États canadiens, États suisses : recettes fiscales 
autonomes 
@BULLET États australiens, collectivités locales autrichiennes, 
États allemands, République tchèque : impôts 
partagés 
@BULLET Grèce, Mexique, Pays-Bas : subventions affectées 
ou non affectées Autonomie fiscale 
L'expression « autonomie fiscale » saisit les différents 
aspects de la liberté dont les collectivités locales 
jouissent en matière de fiscalité. Elle comprend 
différentes éléments, telles que le droit des 
collectivités territoriales à créer ou à abolir un impôt, 
fixer les taux d'imposition, définir l'assiette fiscale ou 
accorder des abattements d'impôt ou des allègements 
fiscaux à des contribuables ou à des entreprises. Dans 
plusieurs pays, les impôts ne sont pas assignés à un 
niveau de gouvernement spécifique mais partagés 
entre le gouvernement central et les collectivités 
territoriales. 
(Contacts : H. Blöchliger, C. Charbit, D. Bergvall) L'Indicateur RS3 montre l'évolution de l'autonomie 
fiscale (1995-2002) : 
@BULLET Allemagne, Autriche, Belgique, Espagne et 
Mexique : les accords de partage d'impôts ont 
perdu de leur importance, principalement en faveur 
d'une plus grande autonomie fiscale 
@BULLET Norvège : les collectivités locales ont accru leur 
autonomie en matière d'impôts sur le revenu 
@BULLET Allemagne et Autriche : les collectivités locales ont 
perdu une certaine autonomie sur les impôts sur le 
revenu. Subventions 
Les données sur les Comptes nationaux peuvent 
fournir une matrice donneur/bénéficiaire pour les 
subventions intergouvernementales, avec cinq niveaux 
de donneurs (gouvernement central, État, collectivités 
locales, niveau international et sécurité sociale) et, 
selon le type du pays, deux niveaux de bénéficiaires 
(collectivités locales ou État et collectivités locales). 
Les subventions intergouvernementales (ou transferts) 
représentant un élément des dépenses, elles doivent 
être mises en relation avec les dépenses totales. 
Cependant, dans plusieurs pays étudiés, les données 
des Comptes nationaux sur les dépenses 
gouvernementales faisant défaut, il a été nécessaire 
d'utiliser le montant des recettes totales tiré des 
Statistiques sur les recettes. L'Indicateur RS5 met en évidence le pourcentage 
que représentent les subventions dans les recettes 
fiscales totales (niveaux national et local pris 
ensemble) ; 
@BULLET Mexique : pays où le système de subventions est le 
plus important (43 % des recettes fiscales totales) 
@BULLET Islande : part des subventions la moins importante

L'Indicateur RS8 montre la nature des contraintes GOV/PGC(2006)10 Au niveau des collectivités territoriales, les contraintes 
d'équilibre budgétaire peuvent cibler différents 
agrégats y compris le budget actuel et le compte 
capital. Ces contraintes peuvent utiliser différents 
concepts budgétaires et peuvent avoir différents 
horizons temporels. Elles peuvent être fixées par le 
gouvernement central ou auto-imposées par les 
collectivités territoriales. 
(Contacts : D. Sutherland, R. Price, I. Joumard) d'équilibre budgétaire : 
@BULLET Autriche, certaines provinces canadiennes, Espagne 
et Pologne : éléments hors-budget inclus dans

Pour les collectivités territoriales, les contraintes 
d'endettement recouvrent toute la gamme de 
restrictions pesant sur le recours par une collectivité 
territoriale au financement par l'emprunt. 
(Contacts : D. Sutherland, R. Price, I. Joumard) L'Indicateur RS9 fournit des informations détaillées 
sur les contraintes d'endettement : 
@BULLET Australie, Canada, Espagne (états) et Suisse : les 
contraintes ne sont pas fixées par un niveau 
supérieur de gouvernement 
@BULLET Danemark et, pour les dépenses actuelles, la Corée 
et l'Espagne : emprunt non autorisé 
@BULLET Pologne : aucun emprunt n'est autorisé si les 
niveaux d'endettement public dépassent 60 % du 
PIB. Mexique et Turquie : autorisation nécessaire 
pour des emprunts en devises étrangères. 
@BULLET Norvège et Espagne : une autorisation préalable 
peut être imposée en cas de dépassement des 
déficits autorisés par les collectivités locales ou en 
cas d'emprunt important. 
@BULLET Espagne : les autorités locales peuvent emprunter 
jusqu'à 30 % de leurs recettes actuelles pour 
couvrir leurs besoins de liquidité à court terme, 
mais les emprunts de long terme sont limités aux 
crédits d'investissement. 
@BULLET Finlande, Pays-Bas, République tchèque et Japon :

Des données seront disponibles pour sept pays 
européens au plus tôt à la fin de 2007. Emploi dans le secteur public 
La nouvelle enquête comparée de l'OCDE sur 
l'emploi dans le secteur public (CEPD) utilise les 
nouvelles définitions internationalement reconnues du 
secteur public, lesquelles comprennent toutes les 
activités représentant une responsabilité fiscale 
contingente importante pour l'administration publique. 
Cette nouvelle classification est conforme au Système 
des comptes nationaux. L'Indicateur I2 montre le nombre total d'employés 
dans chacun des quatre grands domaines du secteur 
public : Présentation en cours de finalisation. GOV/PGC(2006)10 (Key contacts: E. Pilichowski, E. Turkish) Emploi public dans la population active totale 
La population active totale représente l'ensemble des 
personnes aptes au travail. La population en âge de 
travailler est affectée par l'âge de fin de scolarité et 
par la taille du système d'enseignement professionnel 
et supérieur qui réduisent le nombre de jeunes 
travailleurs, et par l'âge de la retraite et les systèmes 
de pension qui réduisent le nombre de travailleurs 
âgés. Dans la population en âge de travailler, le taux 
de participation est affecté par le système de sécurité 
sociale qui détermine la quantité de revenu disponible 
sans travailler et les conditions d'éligibilité. La 
population active est également affectée par la 
politique d'immigration d'un pays et les efforts faits 
pour l'appliquer. 
(Contacts : E. Pilichowski, E. Turkish) L'Indicateur I4 montre la part de l'emploi public 
dans la population active totale : 
Présentation en cours de finalisation. Structure par âge de l'emploi public 
La structure par âge du secteur public a été influencée 
par son histoire unique : les effets de l'expansion 
rapide des services publics dans les années 1970 et 
jusqu'au milieu des années 1980 et l'embauche 
massive qui a eu lieu à cette époque (selon le pays) 
viennent s'ajouter aux effets des gels de l'embauche 
pratiqués dans de nombreux pays au cours des années 
1980 et 1990. 
(Contacts : E. Pilichowski, E. Arnould) L'Indicateur I5 montre la structure par âge de 
l'emploi public : 
Présentation en cours de finalisation. Les rémunérations du secteur public 
Les rémunérations du secteur public constituent un 
facteur important de l'attractivité d'une carrière dans 
la fonction publique, en particulier pour les experts 
techniques. L'indicateur de compression verticale met 
en évidence l'attractivité des postes à responsabilité 
pour le personnel actuel à la recherche d'une 
progression de carrière au sein du secteur public. 
La compression des salaires annuels dans les 
administrations centrales ou fédérales et dans le 
secteur public est examinée par le ratio entre les 
médianes des premier et neuvième déciles des niveaux 
de salaire du secteur public. Les indicateurs peuvent 
être faussés par l'existence d'importants revenus en 
nature si la valeur monétaire de ces revenus n'est pas 
prise en compte dans les niveaux de salaire annoncés.

Présentation en cours de finalisation. GOV/PGC(2006)10 6.3. Processus Pratiques et procédures budgétaires 
Les dispositifs de résolution des litiges entre 
ministères et l'autorité budgétaire centrale sont 
importants car ils contribuent à la force (ou, au 
contraire, à la faiblesse) de l'autorité budgétaire en 
matière de gestion des agrégats fiscaux et peuvent 
conduire à des délais dans l'élaboration du budget. 
Les litiges entre ministères et l'autorité budgétaire 
centrale peuvent être résolus de plusieurs manières : 
@BULLET Le problème peut être transmis au Parlement pour 
qu'il prenne une décision 
@BULLET Le Ministre des finances peut prendre la décision 
finale 
@BULLET Les problèmes peuvent être résolus par le chef du 
gouvernement 
@BULLET La question peut être renvoyée à une réunion 
plénière du gouvernement/cabinet – ou d'un comité 
ministériel

Le pouvoir du parlement en matière d'élaboration du 
budget peut être restreint de plusieurs manières. Il peut 
exister des restrictions sur le droit de la législature à 
modifier le budget détaillé proposé par l'exécutif, et un 
vote du budget peut être considéré comme un vote de 
confiance accordé au gouvernement, avec pour 
conséquence un risque de démission du gouvernement 
en cas de vote de modification à son projet de budget.

Les intrants peuvent être répertoriés en fonction de 
leur secteur fonctionnel (domaine de réalisation) grâce 
à l'utilisation d'une classification « COFOG 
modifiée ». Cette classification permet de répartir les 
dépenses entre biens principalement individuels et 
bien principalement collectifs, ainsi qu'entre biens en 
nature et transferts d'argent. Ces distinctions 
déterminent la structure de l'allocation des ressources 
dans le secteur public. La distinction entre transferts 
en nature et transferts d'argent indique à quel point le 
gouvernement considère que les bénéficiaires doivent 
conserver un certain contrôle sur le choix des 
dépenses. L'importance de la distinction entre biens et 
services individuels et biens collectifs renvoie à 
différentes possibilités pour la fourniture des services. 
Par exemple, dans le cas des biens individuels, il est 
généralement techniquement possible de fournir les 
services comme un droit (revendication de l'individu à 
l'État). Il est en outre possible (et pas inefficace en 
principe) pour les biens individuels de rendre leur 
consommation tributaire du paiement d'une 
contribution individuelle.

Les données pour sept pays européens seront 
disponibles au plus tôt fin 2007. Cet indicateur a été 
inclu ici pour définir la nouvelle approche choisie 
pour réunir des données et des analyses. 7. Recommandations pour les futures collectes des données 7.1. Priorités pour la collecte de données Mieux comprendre l'efficience des administrations publiques ou l'efficacité institutionnelle suppose 
de disposer de données sur les variables institutionnelles clés du secteur public. Il s'agit donc de déterminer 
quels processus et dispositifs institutionnels sont suffisamment importants pour mériter que l'on réunisse 
des données sur eux. En dernière analyse, deux questions empiriques se posent : modifier la nature du 
processus d'élaboration budgétaire peut-il affecter l'efficience de la fourniture de services et une plus 
grande transparence de l'administration renforcera-t-elle la confiance du public ? Pour réunir des données 
permettant l'examen de ces questions d'efficience et d'efficacité, il est bien entendu nécessaire de s'assurer 
que ces données portent bien sur les domaines clés. Les grands exercices de collecte des données risquent 
de s'avérer longs et coûteux. Il est donc important de procéder au préalable à la sélection rigoureuse de la 
gamme de variables nécessaires. GOV/PGC(2006)10 Exemples de nouveaux domaines de collecte de données envisagés (OCDE/GOV) Domaine

groupes et comités experts de l'OCDE, visant à répondre aux questions suivantes : GOV/PGC(2006)10 1. Dans quel domaine de nouvelles comparaisons seraient-elles utiles ? a. Quelles sont les données spécifiques nécessaires à 
cette fin ? b. Les nouveaux domaines envisagés par GOV pour 
la collecte des données (voir encadré ci-dessus) 
sont-ils les bons ? 2. Quels dispositifs institutionnels sont importants pour 
l'efficience et l'efficacité ? a. Quels dispositifs institutionnels sont les plus 
susceptibles d'être les moteurs de l'efficience dans 
la fourniture de services (en particulier dans les 
domaines de l'éducation, de la santé, de la justice 
pénale et des transports) ? b. Quels dispositifs institutionnels sont les plus 
susceptibles d'améliorer les « résultats de la 
gouvernance exécutive » (voir encadré à gauche) ? c. Quelles mesures particulières saisiraient-elles le 
mieux ces dispositifs institutionnels ? 3. Quelles données supplémentaires doit-on réunir sur les 
réalisations ? a. Quelles mesures de leurs réalisations ont la plus 
forte résonance pour les administrations publiques 
? b. Quelles mesures permettront le développement 
d'études pertinentes sur l'efficience ? 8 7.2. Nouvelles approches des domaines difficiles La publication de l'OCDE intitulée « Mesurer les actions menées par l'Administration publique », à 
venir, présente quelques propositions pour la collecte des données sur les réalisations et les résultats non 
financiers des administrations publiques. Il s'agit là de questions techniquement complexes posant de 
nombreux défis et dont l'enjeu est la cohérence des définitions utilisées : @BULLET Elle contient une discussion des problèmes actuels dans le domaine de la mesure des réalisations 
non financières au sein du secteur public. Il suggère que l'on classe les réalisations non 
financières en fonction de l'unité de mesure utilisée, des usages faits des mesures des réalisations 
et de leur relation avec la procédure décisionnelle au niveau gouvernemental. Il est proposé que « Panorama de l'adminstration » n'inclue que les données de processus qui ne 
sont pas disponibles ailleurs (par exemple des données de processus sur le secteur de la santé sont 
disponible dans « Panorama du secteur de santé). Cependant, d'autres sources de données peuvent 
être utilisées dans le développement des mesures de productivité et d'efficience. Cela suggère qu'en termes de nouvelles mesures de résultats, une série de « résultats en matière de 
gouvernance exécutive » soit développée, qui soit principalement reliée aux activités de la branche « Résultats de la gouvernance 
exécutive » 
Le Document technique 3 examine la 
possibilité d'identifier, pour 
« Panorama des administrations », un 
ensemble de résultats reflétant les 
activités de l'exécutif – distinguées de 
celles des branches législative et 
judiciaire. Pour « Panorama des 
administrations », les résultats de la 
gouvernance exécutive pourraient être 
globalement de trois types : 
@BULLET la confiance du public – ce résultat 
peut comprendre des questions 
relatives à la confiance dans 
l'administration publique, ainsi que 
les préoccupations connexes de 
prévisibilité et d'acceptabilité des 
politiques gouvernementales. 
@BULLET l'équité : elle peut comprendre la 
distribution mesurée des services et 
des prestations entre les différentes 
catégories de la population. 
@BULLET Les résultats obtenus en matière de 
stabilité fiscale/économique – ces 
mesures pourraient comprendre 
notamment les déficits budgétaires 
(en tant que facteur de l'instabilité 
économique et fiscale) et d'autres 
résultats budgétaires. GOV/PGC(2006)10 exécutive du gouvernement. Ces résultats pourraient être de trois ordre : la confiance du public, 
l'équité et la stabilité fiscale/économique (voir encadré). 8. Une ressource pour tous L'élaboration de « Panorama des administrations » est une tâche importante. Le présent Document de 
travail et la publication connexe entendent être une contribution au débat entre praticiens, décideurs et 
universitaires. Des résumés de toutes les données disponibles se trouvent à la section suivante. L'OCDE 
travaille à la publication de ces données en ligne car l'intention finale est de permettre aux utilisateurs 
d'interpréer les données plutôt que de simplement parvenir à une conclusion. Tous les commentaires et 
interprétations des données et de l'approche proposée pour « Panorama des administrations » sont les bienvenus à gov.indicators@OECD.org. 1. Document technique 1 : How and Why Should Government Activity Be Measured in "Government at a Glance"?

Il y a des arguments pour élargir prudemment la collecte de données à des pays non membres de l'OCDE.

REVENUE STRUCTURE OF SUB-CENTRAL GOVERNMENTS Key contacts: Hansjörg Blöchliger, Claire Charbit, Daniel Bergvall, OECD ECO and OECD GOV In most countries, sub-central government expenditures by far exceed tax revenue, and this  " fiscal 
gap "  has widened in the last decade and tends to be larger in countries with high sub-central fiscal 
autonomy. The revenue structure is thus very significantly affected by the size and structure of 
intergovernmental grants, particularly in a decentralized environment. About this indicator: Sub-central governments (SCG) rely on own source revenues (which can be separated into autonomous taxes – 
over which SCG has full authority, and shared taxes – which allow for varying degrees of autonomy) and 
intergovernmental grants, which may be earmarked for particular purposes. Revenues through borrowing and 
deficits are not included due to the lack of comparable data. Highlights: With an unweighted average of roughly 60 percent, tax revenue accounts for a larger share of SCG 
revenue than intergovernmental grants. Earmarked grants represent some 22 percent of revenues, 
highlighting that more than one fifth of total revenue is outside of the discretion of sub-central 
governments. Non-earmarked grants account for 17 percent, while tax sharing arrangements – widely used 
in constitutionally federal countries – in total account for 26 percent. Countries with tax sharing 
arrangements have a smaller grants system and vice versa, suggesting certain substitutability between the 
two fiscal arrangements. In some countries autonomous tax revenue accounts for the overwhelming part of 
SCG revenue (Canada states, Switzerland states), in others it is tax sharing (Australia states, Austria local, 
Germany states, Czech Republic), in others again it is either earmarked or non-earmarked grants (Greece, 
Mexico, Netherlands). Further reading: Blöchliger, H. and D. King (2006), Fiscal autonomy of Sub-central Governments, OECD Fiscal Relations

questionnaire sent out in 2005 and completed using Revenue Statistics and National Accounts. GOV/PGC(2006)10 RS2. TAX AUTONOMY OF SUB-CENTRAL GOVERNMENTS Key contacts: Hansjörg Blöchliger, Claire Charbit, Daniel Bergvall, OECD ECO and OECD GOV The discretion over fiscal resources available to state and local governments in OECD countries 
varies considerably and sub-central governments' (SCG) power to shape public service delivery varies 
accordingly. One key aspect of this autonomy is on the revenue side where limits to set own local tax 
bases, rates and reliefs reduce local government's power over their own taxes. Tax autonomy for sub-
central governments can vary from full power over tax rates and bases to no power on rates and bases at 
all. About this indicator: The term  " tax autonomy "  captures the various aspects of freedom sub-central governments have over their own 
taxes. It encompasses features such as sub-central government's right to introduce or to abolish a tax, to set tax 
rates, to define the tax base, or to grant tax allowances or reliefs to individuals and firms. In a number of countries 
taxes are not assigned to one specific government level but shared between the central and sub-central 
governments. Such tax sharing arrangements deny a single SCG any control on tax rates and bases, but collectively 
SCGs may negotiate the sharing formula with central government. Highlights: Although tax autonomy varies widely across countries, most sub-central governments have extended 
discretion over their own tax base. On average, the tax revenue share with full or partial discretion amounts 
to almost 60 percent for state and more than 70 percent for local government. State and regional 
governments have less discretion over their tax revenue than local governments, since they are more 
embedded in tax sharing arrangements. On the other hand, the state level has a higher share in high-
powered autonomous taxes while local governments are often allowed to levy a supplement on selected 
regional or central taxes only. Control over the tax base but not the tax rate plays a very small role in 
OECD countries. This probably points at a policy of gradually banning tax reliefs and abatements as a tool 
for local and regional economic development, particularly in the European Union. Further reading: Blöchliger, H. and D. King (2006), Fiscal autonomy of Sub-central Governments, OECD Fiscal Relations

EVOLUTION OF TAX AUTONOMY OF SUB-CENTRAL GOVERNMENTS Key contacts: Hansjörg Blöchliger, Claire Charbit, Daniel Bergvall, OECD ECO and OECD GOV Tax autonomy for sub-central governments (SCG) can vary from full power over tax rates and bases 
to no power over rates and bases at all. The evolution of tax autonomy provides insights into the ability of 
sub-central governments' power to shape public service delivery. About this indicator: The term  " tax autonomy "  captures the various aspects of freedom sub-central governments have over their own taxes. 
It encompasses features such as sub-central government's right to introduce or to abolish a tax, to set tax rates, to 
define the tax base, or to grant tax allowances or reliefs to individuals and firms. In a number of countries taxes are 
not assigned to one specific government level but shared between the central and sub-central governments. Such tax 
sharing arrangements deny a single SCG any control on tax rates and bases, but collectively SCGs may negotiate the 
sharing formula with central government. 
In some countries the central government is required to compensate the loss of sub-central tax revenue through 
additional transfers; this effect is not shown. Highlights: While the share of SCG tax revenue remained almost stable, taxing power increased from 1995 to 
2002. For the 17 countries where time series is available, tax revenue share rose by 0.6 percent points for 
the state level and remained stable for local governments. In Spain and Poland SCG tax revenue increased 
by more than 10 percentage points, while it decreased considerably in Mexico and Japan. However, the 
share of tax revenue over which SCG have full or partial discretion rose. States and regions gained more 
tax autonomy than local governments. Tax sharing agreements lost significance in countries such as 
Austria, Belgium, Germany, Mexico or Spain, mostly in favour of taxes with more autonomy. In Norway, 
local governments gained some autonomy over income taxes, while in countries such as Austria, and 
Germany, they lost. Further reading: Blöchliger, H. and D. King (2006), Fiscal autonomy of Sub-central Governments, OECD Fiscal Relations

TAX AUTONOMY OF SUB-CENTRAL GOVERNMENTS BY TYPE OF TAX Key contacts: Hansjörg Blöchliger, Claire Charbit, Daniel Bergvall, OECD ECO and OECD GOV Tax autonomy for sub-central governments (SCG) can vary from full power over tax rates and bases 
to no power on rates and bases at all. The differences in tax autonomy by type of tax provide insights into 
the application of current beliefs about optimal tax location. About this indicator: The term  " tax autonomy "  captures the various aspects of freedom sub-central governments have over their own 
taxes. It encompasses features such as sub-central government's right to introduce or to abolish a tax, to set tax 
rates, to define the tax base, or to grant tax allowances or reliefs to individuals and firms. In a number of countries 
taxes are not assigned to one specific government level but shared between the central and sub-central 
governments. Such tax sharing arrangements deny a single SCG any control on tax rates and bases, but collectively 
SCGs may negotiate the sharing formula with central government. Highlights: While fiscal federal theory asserts that mobile taxes should be allocated to higher levels of 
government, in practice the largest single tax assigned to local and regional governments is the highly 
mobile income tax on individuals, with 36 percent of total SCG tax revenue. If local corporate taxes are 
added, the share rises to more than 41 percent. Taxes on goods and services account for 21 percent of total 
SCG tax revenue. Taxes on immovable property, more liked by fiscal federal theorists, account for 19 
percent only. While such local production and sales taxes are prone to externalities such as tax exportation, 
they may also help local governments to cover expenditures caused by individuals and firms from other 
jurisdictions. Property taxes are usually assigned more discretion than other taxes. Around a fourth of 
income tax revenue is embedded in tax sharing systems that restrict a single SCG's control over this tax. 
Since many tax sharing arrangements include fiscal equalization, they counteract the drawbacks of local 
income taxation. Further reading: Blöchliger, H. and D. King (2006), Fiscal autonomy of Sub-central Governments, OECD Fiscal Relations

GRANTS BY DONOR AND RECIPIENT Key contacts: Hansjörg Blöchliger, Claire Charbit, Daniel Bergvall, OECD ECO and OECD GOV National Accounts data can provide a donor/recipient matrix of intergovernmental grants, with five 
donor levels (central, state, local, international and social security) and – depending on the country type – 
one or two recipient levels (local, or state and local). The category  " international "  displays funds directly 
allocated to sub-central government in some countries (e.g. EU grants). About this indicator: In reality, intergovernmental grants (or transfers) are an expenditure item, and they should be set in relation to total 
expenditure. However, National Accounts data on government expenditure are lacking for a number of countries 
under scrutiny, so total revenue was taken from the Revenue Statistics as a proxy. Highlights: On an unweighted average, grants account for 26 percent of total tax revenue (state and local levels 
combined); with Mexico having the largest grant system (43% of total tax revenue) and Iceland having the 
smallest (2%). At 72 percent, central government provides the overwhelming part of grants to local 
governments in both federal and unitary countries. In federal countries the central level is the main 
provider for states and regions with 86 percent. In the majority of federal countries (Belgium, Canada, 
Germany, Switzerland) state government is the main source for local governments. Nearly 3 percent of all 
grants flow between states/regions and only slightly less percent between local governments, pointing at 
various horizontal agreements or horizontal fiscal equalization schemes. Further reading: Blöchliger, H. and D. King (2006), Fiscal autonomy of Sub-central Governments, OECD Fiscal Relations

(SCG). The distinction between earmarked and non-earmarked grants is crucial for assessing the true fiscal 
autonomy of SCG. About this indicator: There is a main distinction between earmarked and non-earmarked grants. SCG have to use earmarked (or 
conditional) grants for a specific purpose while they may spend non-earmarked (or unconditional) grants freely. This 
distinction is crucial for assessing the true fiscal autonomy of SCG. Both types of grants can be divided further into 
mandatory and discretionary transfers, reflecting the legal background that governs their allocation. Earmarked grants 
may be further subdivided into matching and non-matching grants, according to whether the transfer is linked to SCG 
own expenditure or not. A final subdivision is between grants for capital expenditure and grants for current 
expenditure. On the non-earmarked side grants may be further subdivided into block and general purpose grants, 
where the latter provide more freedom of use. The taxonomy is compatible with the one established by the Council of 
Europe. 
The distinction between block and general purpose grants is difficult to make in practice since both forms are 
unconditional. Highlights: Earmarked grants account for a larger portion than non-earmarked grants at both state and local 
levels. This means that central governments still have a strong impact on SCG budgets and selected 
expenditure items. Control over state and regional governments is stricter than over local governments. 
Around a third of all earmarked grants are matching, i.e. linked to SCG own expenditure. Matching grants 
are thought to enhance spending for local and regional public services, and by doing this may put some 
pressure on both central and sub-central budgets. Around three quarter of all earmarked grants are 
mandatory, giving SCG more revenue security but leaving little scope for central governments to adjust 
expenditures rapidly to overall fiscal conditions. Only one quarter of earmarked transfers can be – at least 
from a legal, if not political, point of view -adjusted within short notice. Further reading: Blöchliger, H. and D. King (2006), Fiscal autonomy of Sub-central Governments, OECD Fiscal Relations

edition. GOV/PGC(2006)10 40 RS7. INTERGOVERNMENTAL GRANTS BY GOVERNMENT FUNCTION Key contacts: Hansjörg Blöchliger, Claire Charbit, Daniel Bergvall, OECD ECO and OECD GOV The National Accounts divide government activities into ten functions, and this division is also 
applied to intergovernmental grants. Data is available for earmarked grants only since unconditional grants 
are not tied to a government function. Grants represent about 40% of total state level revenues, and 
earmarked grants account for a larger portion than non-earmarked grants (see RS1), and so central 
governments have a strong impact on sub-central government (SCG) budgets and selected expenditure 
items. This control is stricter for states than for local governments. The structure of grants by function 
indicates how central government is seeking to drive policy at sub-central level. About this indicator: Sub-central governments (SCG) rely on own source revenues and intergovernmental grants, which may be 
earmarked for particular purposes. The functional categories defined by the SNA are: General public services; 
Defence; Public order & safety; Economic affairs; Environmental protection; Housing & community amenities; Health; 
Recreation, culture and religion; Education; Social protection. Highlights: The category  " general public services "  accounts for the largest, rather unspecific share of 
intergovernmental transfers, encompassing a wide variety of public services for which SCG receive 
financial support. Education is the second largest category, pointing at the weight of local and regional 
governments in providing primary and secondary education, with central government retaining 
considerable control over funding and regulation.  " Economic affairs "  is the third largest category, largely 
reflecting the weight of shared responsibilities in local and regional development policy. The grant 
structure varies widely, reflecting the different responsibility assignments and funding arrangements in 
countries. In general, except for  " defence "  and  " public order and safety " , some degree of responsibility 
sharing and overlapping characterizes most government functions. However, the low number of country 
responses does not yet allow for stringent conclusions. Further reading: Blöchliger, H. and D. King (2006), Fiscal autonomy of Sub-central Governments, OECD Fiscal Relations

BUDGET BALANCE REQUIREMENTS FOR SUB-CENTRAL GOVERNMENTS Key contacts: Douglas Sutherland, Robert Price and Isabelle Joumard, OECD ECO Well-designed fiscal rules for sub-central governments can be important in achieving the efficiency 
gains accruing from local autonomy while meeting the objectives of sustainable longer-term finances. 
They help policymakers resist temptations to renege on previous commitments, providing a cushion 
against shocks and facilitating the fiscal consolidation that may be needed to attain a sustainable path. About this indicator: At the sub-central government level, budget balance requirements can target different aggregates including the 
current budget and capital account. They can use different budget concepts and can have different time horizons. 
They can be set by central government or self-imposed by sub-central governments. Highlights: The responses to a questionnaire used in Sutherland, D., R. Price and I. Joumard (2005) gave the 
following main results. The most common objective for budget balance requirements encompassed the 
current budget and capital account. Targeting the current budget alone, which allows sub-central 
governments to borrow for public investment, was somewhat less common. In Austria, some Canadian 
provinces, Poland and Spain off-budget items are included in the objective. Budget balance requirements 
are frequently set on an annual basis, and the relevant time horizon is overwhelmingly annual, though in 
Australia, Austria, Canada (local), Finland, Norway, and Spain the budget periods have moved to a multi-
annual basis. In the Netherlands and Spain, the budget period is three years, with specified annual targets. 
In almost all cases, budget balance requirements are imposed by higher levels of government. Self imposed 
requirements are restricted to mid-tier governments in explicitly federal states, Poland and Japan. In most 
cases, budget balance requirements apply to budgetary outturns, with a slight majority reporting that no 
carry-over is allowed. In the Czech Republic and Turkey, the constraint only applies to proposed budgets. 
Furthermore, in the Czech Republic the budget can include projected deficits, but only in the case of 
drawing on accumulated surpluses or by contractually guaranteeing resources for repayment. In Korea and 
Portugal, both proposed and approved budgets need to be balanced. Further reading: Sutherland, D., R. Price and I. Joumard (2005), Sub-central government fiscal rules, OECD Economic

BORROWING CONSTRAINTS FOR SUB-CENTRAL GOVERNMENTS Key contacts: Douglas Sutherland, Robert Price and Isabelle Joumard, OECD ECO Well-designed fiscal rules for sub-central governments can be important in achieving the efficiency 
gains accruing from local autonomy while meeting the objectives of sustainable longer-term finances, 
helping policymakers resist temptations to renege on previous commitments, providing a cushion against 
shocks and facilitating the fiscal consolidation that may be needed to attain a sustainable path. About this indicator: At the sub-central government level, borrowing constraints cover a range of restrictions on sub-central government 
recourse to debt financing. They can be set by central government or self-imposed by sub-central governments. 
They can refer to specific purposes. 
In interpreting this information, it should be kept in mind that strict budget balance requirements may also have the 
effect of outlawing in practice the need for borrowing constraints. An additional channel for sub-central borrowing 
that may not be fully captured in objective setting fiscal rules concerns the ownership and control of local enterprises 
and banks. Highlights: With the exceptions of Australia, Canada, Spain (states) and Switzerland, a higher level of 
government typically imposes borrowing constraints. In the most restrictive cases, borrowing may not be 
allowed at all (as in Denmark, or in Korea and Spain for current expenditure). In Poland, no borrowing is 
allowed if general government debt levels exceed 60% of GDP. The requirement of prior approval from 
higher levels of government is also quite widespread, including permission to borrow in foreign currency 
as in Mexico and Turkey. The need for prior approval on a project-by-project basis is gradually being 
relaxed in OECD countries, such as Mexico which abandoned such a system in 2000. In Japan and Korea 
the formal requirement to obtain permission from a higher level of government is being relaxed. In Norway 
and Spain, prior authorisation can be imposed when sub-central governments breach agreed deficits or the 
proposed borrowing is substantial. A few countries apply limits on borrowing for specific purposes. For 
example, in Spain, local authorities can borrow up to 30% of current revenues to cover short-term liquidity 
needs, while long-term borrowing is restricted to capital investment. No constraints on access to borrowing 
are applied in the Czech Republic, Finland, the Netherlands, and Japan. Further reading: Sutherland, D., R. Price and I. Joumard (2005), Sub-central government fiscal rules, OECD Economic

TAX AND EXPENDITURE LIMITS FOR SUB-CENTRAL GOVERNMENTS Key contacts: Douglas Sutherland, Robert Price and Isabelle Joumard, OECD ECO Well-designed fiscal rules for sub-central governments can be important in achieving the efficiency 
gains accruing from local autonomy while meeting the objectives of sustainable longer-term finances, 
helping policymakers resist temptations to renege on previous commitments, providing a cushion against 
shocks and facilitating the fiscal consolidation that may be needed to attain a sustainable path. About this indicator: Although tax and expenditure limits (TELs) have a long history in public finance, dating from the late nineteenth 
century, they regained popularity relatively recently with the rapid expansion in their use during the  " tax revolt "  
across the United States that followed a referendum in California in 1978 (Proposition 13) on property tax rates. Most 
US states now have some form of TEL, mainly on property taxes. In most countries, central governments impose 
limits on tax rates or reliefs that can be set by sub-central governments. Explicit restraints on expenditures are less 
common. Highlights: In most OECD countries the form of the tax limit is in the form of an explicit limit on tax autonomy. 
In Denmark, Japan and Mexico, implicit sanctions on sub-central governments serve to restrain increases 
in tax rates. In contrast to limits on rates or reliefs, the tax limits imposed in some US states and also the 
United Kingdom target the revenue raised from a specific tax base or the annual increase in revenue from a 
given tax base. Expenditure increase limits are often linked to income, inflation or population growth (or to 
a needs-based criterion), or some combination of these (such as in Korea). Limits can also be set in terms 
of ceilings on expenditures. Furthermore, they can be set for annual or multi-annual periods. One of the 
possibly most restrictive rules is the requirement to hold referenda for expenditure above a given threshold 
(in some cantons in Switzerland). Further reading: Sutherland, D., R. Price and I. Joumard (2005), Sub-central government fiscal rules, OECD Economic

The papers draw on responses to a questionnaire distributed to members of the OECD Network on Fiscal Relations across Levels of 
Government and OECD (1999) Taxing powers of state and local governments, Paris to give a detailed picture of fiscal rules in place 
for a number of countries. GOV/PGC(2006)10 48 RS11. PROCESS RULES AND RULE IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENTS FOR SUB-CENTRAL 
GOVERNMENTS Key contacts: Douglas Sutherland, Robert Price and Isabelle Joumard, OECD ECO Well-designed fiscal rules for sub-central governments can be important in achieving the efficiency 
gains accruing from local autonomy while meeting the objectives of sustainable longer-term finances, 
helping policymakers resist temptations to renege on previous commitments, providing a cushion against 
shocks and facilitating the fiscal consolidation that may be needed to attain a sustainable path. About this indicator: Fiscal rules include setting requirements for budget balances, constraints on debt accumulation, and limits on the 
ability to increase spending or the tax burden (these are often referred to collectively as tax and expenditure limits or 
TELs). 
The degree of commitment to abiding by fiscal rules largely depends on the impact of process rules that govern 
implementation. This type of rule includes the obligation to produce financial accounts (transparency); monitoring 
and reporting whether rules are being upheld; the sanctions levied on sub-central governments and officials in the 
case of violation; the difficulty in evading the rule's constraint by simply changing the rule, and special procedures 
that permit some flexibility in fiscal policy. Highlights: The responses from a questionnaire used in Sutherland, D., R. Price and I. Joumard (2005) gave the 
following main results. The transparency of accountancy reporting standards varies considerably across the 
OECD. In most countries there were requirements for independent auditing of accounts, though in some 
cases without apparent deadlines for submission. Sub-central governments report on implicit liabilities in 
only a handful of countries. Several countries have largely independent bodies that monitor, audit, and 
report on sub-central government budgetary actions. Monitoring most often involves reporting to a higher 
level of government. Sanctions may be necessary to complement other process rules in ensuring 
compliance. Financial sanctions were reported in eight cases, though breach of fiscal rules can also have 
repercussions for eligibility for grants. With the exception of sub-central governments in Austria, some 
Canadian states, Finland, and Spanish states, administrative sanctions can be applied when fiscal rules are 
breached. Permitting some closely-circumscribed flexibility in implementation eases some of the problems 
associated with coping with unanticipated economic shocks. Of particular importance are mechanisms that 
allow sub-central governments to deal with cyclical pressures on their budgets. Further reading: Sutherland, D., R. Price and I. Joumard (2005), Sub-central government fiscal rules, OECD Economic

OECD Network on Fiscal Relations across Levels of Government and other sources to give a detailed picture of fiscal rules in place 
for a number of countries. GOV/PGC(2006)10 52 I1. MODE OF PUBLIC SECTOR PRODUCTION Key contacts: Dirk Kraan and Daniel Bergvall, OECD GOV Inputs can be disaggregated into a "mode of production" classification using input categories used in 
the National Accounts: labour, procurement of goods and services, gross capital investment, social benefits 
in kind and subsidies. Mode of production analysis reveals the preferences of governments concerning the 
way in which expenditures are utilised to deliver in kind goods and services, as the input mix may differ 
and some services are, arguably, more reliably delivered directly by the public sector, while others are 
more efficiently delivered through outsourcing and contracting with private and non-profit providers. About this indicator: The "mode of production" classification provides insight on how wholly or part collectively financed services are 
produced. The basic classification is: 
Collective goods 
A. by contracting out and procurement: intermediate consumption + property income 
B. by general government production: 
񮽙 production factor labour: compensation of employees 
񮽙 production factor capital: gross capital formation 
Individual goods 
A. by contracting out and procurement: intermediate consumption+ property income 
B. by general government production 
񮽙 production factor labour: compensation of employees 
񮽙 production factor capital: gross capital formation C. by privatization to market and non-market producers for services with social purposes (mainly education, 
health and social protection): social benefits in kind 
D. by privatization to market and non-market producers while providing financial support with the objective of 
influencing their levels of production, their prices or the remuneration of factors of production: subsidies. Production by general government includes production by non-profit institutions financed (> 50%) and "controlled" by 
government. Although it is a fundamentally different mode of production, the data unfortunately do not allow splitting 
off this mode of production from pure government production. Highlights: The resulting data base will make clear the differences between countries in labour and capital 
intensity of public production in (modified) COFOG sectors as well as the different practices concerning 
privatization of service delivery (not of funding) to market and non-market producers as well as of partial 
public funding of market producers through subsidies. Trends: The dataset will provide only data for the last 2 or 3 years since the source data from the National 
Accounts have only become available for those years (and provisionally only for few OECD countries). Further reading: OECD (2006), How and Why Should Government Activity Be Measured in "Government at a Glance"?,

Paris. GOV/PGC(2006)10 54 I2. EMPLOYMENT IN THE PUBLIC DOMAIN Key contacts: Elsa Pilichowski, Edouard Turkish, OECD GOV Labour, together with procurement of goods and services and capital investment is one of the key 
inputs used for government production. Historically, three conflicting definitions of the public sector have 
been used at the country level: the legal definition (government organisations and organisation under 
public law), the financial or funding definition, and the sectoral definitions (a priori sectoral definition of 
what the public sector is). The result has been that, across countries and even within OECD countries 
depending on the source of information, the definitions of  " government organisations " , the  " public sector "  
or the  " public domain "  vary significantly. Public sector employment statistics within countries follow 
different definitions, with large differences within countries and across countries. A new survey, the 
Comparison of Employment in the Public Domain (CEPD), provides, for the first time, insights into the 
total use of labour inputs within a consistent framework with the System of National Accounts, allowing a 
realistic view to be taken of changing employment levels. About this indicator: The Public Sector Pay and Employment survey (PSPE) traditionally gathered data about employment and wage bill 
in "public organisations". 
The new OECD Comparison of Employment in the Public Domain survey (CEPD) uses new internationally 
comparable definitions of the public domain which encompass activities that represent a significant contingent fiscal 
liability to government: 
1. Employees engaged in the direct provision of services in the public domain (entities engaged in publicly financed 
service-provision by publicly owned units) 
2. Employees engaged in the indirect provision of services in the public domain (publicly financed but privately 
owned entities engaged in service provision, concerning mostly education, health and social services). 
3. Employees engaged in the public corporate provision of services in the public domain (publicly owned entities 
providing services on a market-basis: public (quasi-)corporations) 
4. Some data are also asked concerning employees engaged in providing devolved services in the public domain 
(privately owned units providing services on a market basis but with statutory protection of their market position: 
the concessions of legal monopoly). The weight of contracted-out services can be measured by expenditures 
data coming from the National Accounts (intermediate consumption, etc.) 
The new classification is consistent with the SNA for two reasons. First, this reflects a well-established consensus 
concerning the components of the public sector. Second, it allows for the possibility of "triangulating" employment 
data as, with assumptions concerning average wages, it would allow employment totals to be cross-checked 
against fiscal data. Trends: The survey on Comparison of Employment in the Public Domain is in process. We publish here 
results for 2002. Very early 2006 data are suggesting that the new measures of employment totals are 
leading to significantly revised understanding of employment in the public domain. Further reading: OECD (2007), State of the Public Service, Paris. (Forthcoming)

EMPLOYMENT IN THE PUBLIC DOMAIN WITHIN THE TOTAL LABOUR FORCE Key contacts: Elsa Pilichowski, Edouard Turkish, OECD GOV Employment within the public domain relative to the total labour force provides a headline estimate of 
the size of the public domain, and the influence of changes of public employment levels on the flexibility 
of the wider labour market. The data also provide an entry point into productivity means in the public 
sector compared to the private sector. About this indicator: The latest OECD Comparison of Employment in the Public Domain survey uses new internationally comparable 
definitions of the "public domain" which encompass all activities that represent a significant contingent fiscal liability to 
government. 
The total labour force represents the number of people available for work. This is affected by many factors. The 
population of working age is affected by the school-leaving age and the size of the further and higher education 
system, which keeps down the number of young workers, and the retirement age and pension system, which keeps 
down the number of older workers. Among the population of working age, the participation rate is affected by the 
social security system, which determines how much income is available without working and how easy is to qualify for 
it. The labour force is also affected by a country's immigration policy and the degree of effort put into actually 
enforcing it. Further reading: OECD (2007), State of the Public Service, Paris. (Forthcoming)

AGE STRUCTURE OF PUBLIC SECTOR EMPLOYMENT Key contacts: Elsa Pilichowski, Emma Arnould, Edouard Turkisch, OECD GOV In many OECD countries, public sector workforces are ageing even more rapidly than the rest of 
society and the wider labour market. Reinforcing this trend, it seems that the age at entry to the public 
service has increased. At the same time, the overall demographic developments have resulted in changing 
needs for public services, and this is likely to continue (for instance, declining demand for primary 
education but increased demand for health and elderly care services, both of which are rather labour 
intensive). Unless accompanied by a reallocation of resources and more efficient working practices, the 
overall demand for labour in the public sector will increase steadily. To address this challenge, OECD 
countries are reforming their approach to public sector personnel management, with the objective of better 
adapting the labour force to changing needs, attracting the people with the necessary skills, and 
strengthening the performance of public employees. The retirement of a significant share of public 
employees should be taken as an opportunity to progress further in this direction. About this indicator: The age structure of the public sector has been driven by its distinctive history. The effects of the rapid expansion of 
public services in the 1970s until the mid-80s and the massive hiring that took place at this time (depending on the 
country), have been combined with hiring freezes that have taken place in many countries in the 1980s and 1990s. Highlights: Most national administrations will have to face the arrival at retirement age of the baby-boom 
generation in the next decade. Since 1990, the age groups  " 50-59 years "  and  " 60 years and more "  have 
seen their respective proportion increase continuously. Further reading: OECD (2007), State of the Public Service, Paris. (Forthcoming),

PARTICIPATION OF WOMEN IN PUBLIC EMPLOYMENT Key contacts: Elsa Pilichowski, Edouard Turkisch, OECD GOV The public sector workforce is increasingly female. OECD work has identified the changing 
opportunities for women within the civil service. Many countries have established policies aimed at 
increasing female participation in the public workforce and especially at management levels. About this indicator: The proportion of women in the public sector workforce is significant but it is a very narrow measure of equality of 
opportunity. It is probable that informal practices and assumptions matter more than formal institutional 
arrangements in ensuring equal opportunities, and the trends likely reflect changing attitudes as much as formal 
new employment policies. Highlights: GOV public sector pay and employment data show trends in female employment in the public sector 
(as % of total) in 20 OECD countries and the share of women at different responsibility levels (as % of 
total) in 16 OECD countries. The data show a persistent increase in women's participation in public 
employment. In the seven OECD countries with a data time series since 1990, women have accounted for 
over half of the public sector workforce since 1995. When the central or federal administration is 
considered alone, a similar trend is evident – although women's participation in this level of government 
lags that of the public sector as a whole. Reassuringly, these data suggest that the increased participation of 
women in the public sector workforce is not just the result of increasing numbers of low skill and low pay 
jobs being available to them. Further reading: OECD (2007), State of the Public Service. Paris. (Forthcoming),

particularly for technical specialists. Vertical compression provides insights into the attractiveness of 
senior positions for existing staff seeking career advancement within the public sector. About this indicator: Compression in annual pay in central or federal administrations and in the public sector is examined in the ratio 
between the medians of the first and ninth deciles of public sector pay levels. The median of all public sector pay 
provides a snapshot of broad changes in pay. The indicators can be distorted by the existence of significant in-kind 
benefits, if the monetary value is not reflected in the reported pay levels. Further reading: OECD (2007), State of the Public Service, Paris. (Forthcoming),

attractiveness of the public sector as a career, particularly for technical specialists. The way in which 
pensions are structured has implications for the attraction of senior positions, both for external applicants 
and for existing staff seeking career advancement within the public sector. Pensions also constitute a 
significant and often unknown fiscal liability. About this indicator: Pension rights are determined by reference to a series of parameters related to age and by the way in which the 
pension is calculated. Age need not be a decisive element in calculating pensions, especially in countries where there 
are general rules for access to the basic scheme. These latter include length of residence requirements and a single 
retirement age. The pension, either a fixed amount or an amount that varies according to resources, is mainly 
financed out of income tax. In principle, the makeup of the household is taken into account for payment of 
incremental pensions. Some laws or company statutes do not allow people to be kept on in employment after a 
certain age. Different ages can be set for the supplementary retirement pension. This difference in age is an incentive 
to employees to stay until they reach the retirement age laid down in the basic scheme. In supplementary schemes, 
the social partners often play a major role in determining the retirement age. 
There are three key variables: 
1. The minimum retirement age is the age at which civil servants can ask for the liquidation of rights on retirement 
and receive a pension immediately. 
2. The maximum retirement age means the age when civil servants must leave their posts and liquidate their 
pensions. 
3. The replacement rate is the relationship between the average pension of a given individual or population and 
average earnings at a certain date. Highlights: Public sector pension schemes in OECD member countries vary substantially. The legal age of 
retirement is a decisive factor in calculating the old age pensions of workers in certain member countries of 
the OECD. It is between 60 and 65 for public sector employees. Other member countries have decided not 
to set a legal age (New Zealand, Japan and Australia).Two countries (Portugal and France) make 
derogations, in terms of age, for politicians. In most member countries of the OECD, the age for retirement 
is identical for men and women. The trend in member countries of the European Union is to bring the age 
of retirement of women into line with that for men. In countries where special schemes exist for public 
sector employees, the replacement rate is higher than in other countries. In practice, it varies between 70 
and 100% .The replacement rate is lower, if not very low, in countries where defined contribution schemes 
play a large part and where the pay of public sector employees is similar to that in the private sector. The 
rates vary between 40 and 60%. Further reading: OECD (2005), Public Sector Pension Schemes in OECD Member Countries: Preliminary Findings,

Member countries. GOV/PGC(2006)10 81 GOV/PGC(2006)10 82 I8. TYPES OF PUBLIC SECTOR PENSION SCHEMES Key contacts: Elsa Pilichowski, Edouard Turkish, OECD GOV Public sector pension schemes in OECD Member countries vary substantially. Public sector pensions 
are a significant component of total compensation, and so contribute to the attractiveness of the public 
sector as a career, particularly for technical specialists. The way in which pensions are structured has 
implications for the attraction of senior positions, both for external applicants and for existing staff seeking 
career advancement within the public sector. Pensions also constitute a significant and often unknown 
fiscal liability. About this indicator: There are contributory and non contributory pension schemes. A contributory pension scheme is the one in which 
scheme members are required to contribute to the scheme's funds, usually by deduction of a percentage of their pay. 
This is contrasted with a non-contributory pension scheme, where the entire cost is borne by the employer. In a 
contributory pension scheme the employer normally also bears part of the cost. 
Defined benefit schemes show a characteristically high level of interdependence between the generations, but also 
between the members and the employers. These latter, in general, bear the risks of managing the scheme and 
paying the benefits. Benefits are calculated on the basis of a reference salary based on a certain period of activity 
that varies according to the number of years of contributions and the category of the workers. 
In defined contribution plans, pension rights are personalized, meaning that the pension received is based on the 
contributions paid throughout the person's working life. The final salary is not considered. The amount of the final 
benefit depends on a number of factors such as the financial performance of the funds invested, the level of 
administrative and management costs, the capacity of the fund managers or even the efficiency of the control and 
supervisory organs, the amount paid in contributions, etc. Highlights: In the member countries of the OECD, the pension schemes in existence for employees, taking all 
sectors together, work by distribution or capitalization, either with defined benefits or defined 
contributions. The financial balance of the defined contribution schemes is sensitive, and is the product of 
various factors such as the number of active employees, the number of pensioners, the amount of the 
contributions or also of the pensions. Defined contribution schemes do not depend on intergenerational 
solidarity. They are based on the financial effort of the individual. Risks are generally either shared 
between the employer and the employee (Sweden), or it is the employee alone who bears the risk of 
receiving a low pension (Slovenia, France). The employer can also be alone in bearing the risk of bad 
management (Norway). Reserves can be built up to protect against future financial difficulties. They can be 
built in a particular institution either separate from the business (United Kingdom and Germany), or within 
the business itself, by constituting accounting reserves or taking out a policy with an insurance company 
(New Zealand). Defined contribution schemes are more commonly found in supplementary or "pension 
fund" schemes. Recent pension systems, such as the ones set up in Eastern European countries, have 
shown a tendency to choose defined contribution plans. The pension funds existing in nearly all the OECD 
countries operate in this way. Further reading: OECD (2005), Public Sector Pension Schemes in OECD Member Countries: Preliminary Findings. Human

which they are prepared, and by the degree to which there is expert and public review. The credibility of 
these assumptions is significant because variations can represent a major fiscal risk which should be 
identified and quantified where possible. The fiscal effects of variations in key assumptions underpinning 
the macroeconomic forecasts (e.g., the effect on the fiscal deficit of a 1 percent increase or decrease in 
GDP growth, inflation, interest rates, or the exchange rate from the central rate assumed in the budget 
forecast) can be very large. About this indicator: The economic assumptions used in the budget are generally undertaken in: 
@BULLET The Finance Ministry (Treasury) – either in the central budget authority (if indeed that is part of the Finance 
Ministry, or elsewhere 
@BULLET The Economics Ministry 
@BULLET An independent body 
@BULLET In principle, the legislature could undertake this work. Review of the assumptions can be undertaken: 
@BULLET By an independent expert body 
@BULLET By making them widely available for scrutiny. Highlights: Unsurprisingly, the Ministry of Finance is generally responsible for the assumptions. More 
surprisingly, the majority of OECD countries have no arrangement for independent review – but they are 
almost universally available to the public and the legislature as part of the budget documentation. Further reading: OECD (2002), Overview of Results-Focused Management and Budgeting in OECD Member Countries,

made in terms of aggregate or sectoral limits on expenditures for each of the next three to five years. 
Australia led the way in the MTEF movement during the 1980s by expanding its forward estimates into 
multi-year targets that rapidly gained standing as the basis on which spending departments bid for 
resources and the annual budget is compiled. The key objective of the MTEF is to extend the budget's 
horizon beyond a single fiscal year. Doing so depends on reliable projections of macroeconomic 
conditions, future revenue and spending if current policies were continued, and the impact of policy 
changes on future budgets. The conventional method for making these projections is to construct a baseline 
budget and to measure policy changes against the baseline. In the MTEF, the baseline is used both to 
establish the fiscal framework and to determine whether expenditure changes are consistent with the 
framework. Inasmuch as future conditions are not yet known, the baseline and estimates of policy change 
are grounded on assumptions concerning economic performance, the behavioural responses of persons 
affected by policy changes and other variables. Countries which use baselines to establish and enforce 
expenditure frameworks should have rules for how the projections are made and how policy changes are 
measured as well as procedures for dealing with deviations from the baseline. They should also assign 
responsibility for maintaining the baseline and assuring that policy changes are accurately measured 
against it. About this indicator: The key dimensions of a MTEF providing targets or ceilings for expenditures concern whether or not it states 
targets/ceilings for each budget year or just for the medium term, and how many years the medium-term fiscal 
framework covers. Highlights: Most OECD countries have an MTEF in place, with targets stated for each year. Most frameworks 
cover 3-5 years. Further reading: OECD (2002), Overview of Results-Focused Management and Budgeting in OECD Member Countries,

significant as they contribute to the strength (or otherwise) of the budget authority in managing the fiscal 
aggregates, and can lead to delays in budget formulation. In the end the Prime Minister or President 
formally have the last word. This does not mean however that this is what generally happens. About this indicator: Who has the last word? Disputes between Ministries and the central budget authority can be resolved in various 
ways: 
@BULLET The minister of finance can make a final decisions 
@BULLET The issues can be resolved by the head of government 
@BULLET The issue can be referred to a full meeting of the government/cabinet – or a ministerial committee. Highlights: The results of the survey show the distinctively strong role of the Minister of Finance (Chancellor) in 
the UK, and the role of the head of government in Canada, France, Italy, Korea, Mexico, Spain, Sweden, 
Turkey and the United States. Cabinet remains an important decision-making body in Australia, Austria, 
Belgium, Czech Republic, Finland, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Netherlands, New Zealand, and Norway. Further reading: OECD (2002), Overview of Results-Focused Management and Budgeting in OECD Member Countries,

(http://ocde.dyndns.org/) GOV/PGC(2006)10 92 P4. ROLE OF THE LEGISLATURE Key contact: Ian Hawkesworth, OECD GOV The power of the purse is one of parliament's fundamental attributes. But it can be constrained in 
several dimensions. It can be constrained by a previous commitment that the Parliament has made (such as 
the Maastricht treaty), and constitutionally by the nature of the amendments that are possible. The latter 
include constitutional requirements that any increases in expenditures must be off-set by an equal and 
opposite reduction; that it cannot increase overall spending or the deficit; or that it cannot increase 
spending or deficit above a certain limit. Where it does not have the power to amend, it can place pressure 
on the executive by delaying the passing of the budget -even if this might force a shutdown in the 
executive. However, it must also balance this against the possibility that rejecting the budget proposal can 
result in dissolution of the legislature. About this indicator: This indicator opens up questions concerning 
@BULLET The existence of restrictions on the right of the legislature to modify the detailed budget proposed by the 
executive 
@BULLET Whether a vote on the budget is considered a vote of confidence in the government and therefore the 
government would resign if any changes are approved to its budget proposal? Highlights: The results of the survey show four groups of countries. In some the legislature faces no restrictions 
on its right to amend the proposals (Austria, Czech Republic, Finland, Germany, Hungary, Iceland, Italy, 
Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Sweden, and United States). In others there are also no restrictions but 
amending the budget proposals would be a vote of confidence on the government (Belgium, Denmark). In 
a third group there are restrictions without risks of resigning (Australia, France, Ireland, Korea, Mexico, 
Slovak Republic, Spain, and Turkey). In the final group, legislatures are both restricted and face some risks 
of government resigning (Canada, Greece, and New Zealand). Further reading: OECD (2002), Overview of Results-Focused Management and Budgeting in OECD Member Countries,

agencies with limited flexibility in budget execution due to highly detailed appropriations is giving way to 
arrangements in which Ministers and ministries have greater budgetary flexibility to re-allocate 
expenditure within the overall agency appropriation -but also within a hard budget constraint. It is widely 
held that this budget devolution or flexibility to and within spending ministries may increase efficiency About this indicator: Government organisations can face various constraints on their ability to transfer funds between operating 
expenditures, investments and programme funds: 
@BULLET They may have to require the approval of the Ministry of Finance/Central Budget Authority 
@BULLET They may have to require the approval of the legislature 
@BULLET They may have to notify legislature of the transfer 
@BULLET There can be no such transfers Highlights: The survey results highlight the power of the central budget authority in some countries (Austria, 
Belgium, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Ireland, Netherlands, Slovak Republic, Turkey, United 
Kingdom) and the very tight restrictions on such transfers in others (Finland, Greece, Iceland, Italy, Spain). Further reading: OECD (2002), Overview of Results-Focused Management and Budgeting in OECD Member Countries,

■ GOV/PGC(2006)10 96 P6. SCOPE AND FOCUS OF AUDIT Key contact: Ian Hawkesworth, OECD GOV All public spending should be subjected to independent scrutiny. It is generally accepted that a 
national audit body or equivalent organization, which is independent of the executive, should provide 
timely reports for the legislature and public on the financial integrity of government accounts. About this indicator: Assuming the existence of a central Supreme or National Audit Office, the indicator asks whether it reports to: 
@BULLET the executive 
@BULLET the legislature 
@BULLET the judiciary branch 
@BULLET individual Ministries. It also identifies how audit subjects are generally determined: 
@BULLET By request of the legislature 
@BULLET Within the Supreme or National Audit Office 
@BULLET By request from the executive 
@BULLET By request from the public or other civil society actor Highlights: The survey results highlight that the overwhelming majority of Supreme or National Audit Offices 
report to the legislature, and that they derive most of their work programmes internally. Further reading: OECD (2002), Overview of Results-Focused Management and Budgeting in OECD Member Countries,

management and budgeting, governments continue to develop and make use of evaluations. In a few 
counties, for example Germany and Japan, evaluations are the main source of performance information. About this indicator: Evaluations can be conducted within or outside of the budget process by a large range of actors (Ministry of Finance, 
Ministry of Planning, Spending ministries, the organisation in charge of the activity/programme, and the national 
audit body, or the Legislature). The evaluations conducted or commissioned by the Ministry of Finance (MOF) can 
take several forms (current or ex-post review of programmes, review of new initiatives or programmes, sectoral or 
spending reviews). Evaluations produced by spending ministries/departments can be used in negotiations with the 
Ministry of Finance. Highlights: Performance information, especially evaluations, are more often developed and used by spending 
ministries than MOFs. Spending Ministries tend to use evaluations not so much as part of the budget 
formulation process, but rather for strategy development and for target setting. In some ministries, this 
approach has helped to improve performance. Most of the evaluations undertaken by the MOFs tend to be on an ad hoc basis. This is probably 
because the MOFs call for evaluations when they see problem rather than on a planned basis. The 
exception to this is spending reviews which are conducted on a more systematic basis than other reviews. Further reading: OECD (2005), Modernizing Government: The way forward. Paris.

discussion of the budget law in the legislature, or used as part of the strategic activity and target setting by ministries. 
The findings of evaluations produced by the spending ministries/departments can be used in negotiations with the 
Ministry of Finance. Highlights: Evaluation is used less often in budget negotiations than performance measures. For 48% of 
respondents, evaluations are rarely or not used. This could be because it is the spending ministries or 
national audit offices that are responsible for commissioning and conducting evaluations in many OECD 
countries. Evaluations are rarely or never used to eliminate programmes or to determine pay rewards for 
agency heads. They are only occasionally used to cut expenditure. When evaluations are used in the budget 
process by the MOF, they are used to inform not determine budget allocations. Further reading: OECD (2005), Modernizing Government: The way forward. Paris.

explanations for success or failure of programmes and also make recommendations for future action. 
Therefore, the production of these reports is only one stage in the evaluation process. If they are to be taken 
seriously, it is important that there be monitoring or follow-up to see if accepted recommendations are 
implemented. About this indicator: Evaluations can be conducted within or outside of the budget process by a large range of actors (Ministry of Finance, 
Ministry of Planning, the organisation in charge of the activity/programme, and the national audit body, the 
Legislature or the Ministry). To ensure that recommendations have been carried out, it is important for them to be 
used as part of the budget formulation process. Evaluations can be used by the Ministry of Finance/Central Budget 
Office, the relevant ministry or department, by the cabinet, as a contribution to the discussion of the budget law in the 
legislature, or used as part of the strategic activity and target setting by ministries. The findings of evaluations 
produced by the spending ministries/departments can also be used in negotiations with the Ministry of Finance. Highlights: In 67% of cases there is a follow-up process. When evaluations are conducted outside of the budget 
process, the spending ministry in charge of the programme is responsible for monitoring the follow up in 
51% of cases. When it is decided as part of the budget process, both the MOF (32%) and the relevant 
ministry (32%) can be responsible for the follow up process. Regarding consequences of not following recommendations in the majority of cases, there are never 
or rarely consequences if recommendations are not followed. If there are consequences, the most common 
case is more control on the programme. While the majority of countries have adopted some type of follow-
up process for monitoring the implementation of recommendation from evaluations, in many cases, it is the 
responsibility of the ministry in charge of the programme being evaluated. Similar to the failure to meet 
performance targets, sanctions do not typically apply for non-compliance with recommendations of 
evaluations. Further reading: OECD (2005), Modernizing Government: The way forward. Paris.

categorised as providing a career-based system or a position-based system. Position-based systems are said 
to be more flexible and to allow an individually tailored approach to human resources management. 
Career-based systems are reported to provide more loyalty and esprit de corps. About this indicator: Position-based systems are based on the principle of recruiting to a specific position (externally or internally), with no 
certainty for any employee of subsequent appointments within government. However, they imply that, generally-
speaking, positions are open to all who qualify and not just to members of that cadre/corps or department. Thus, 
fully-fledged position-based systems de facto allow a career across government. 
Career-based refers to the tendency inherent within many employment arrangements to recruit staff relatively young, 
offer promotion based on good behaviour and seniority and employment and compensation for life, while deterring 
lateral entry. Career systems provide civil servants with long-term guarantees for employment and income, and were 
intended to ensure their loyalty to the state. At the same time they provided the civil servants with reliable protection 
against the displeasure of the rulers, and thus enabled a professional execution of the laws and statutes of the 
country. 
Career-based systems can, in principle, be characterised as: 
1. Government-wide career-based systems (recruitment into government generally – with the career path going 
through many different ministries/departments). 
2. Cadre or corps-based career-based systems (recruitment into the "legal service" or some such body, with the 
career path subsequently encompassing many ministries). 
3. Departmental career-based systems (recruitment into the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, for example, with the 
career path staying within that ministry). Highlights: In Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, Hungary, New Zealand, Sweden, 
Switzerland, the United Kingdom, all or most posts are open to anybody coming from within the 
organisation, another government organisation or outside of government. In France, Japan, Mexico and 
Spain, most posts are not open to non civil servants except for contract posts. Korea has relatively recently 
opened up a percentage of its top civil service positions to staff coming from outside the public service. In 
the United States, most positions are open to anybody, but senior executive service positions (i.e. senior 
positions that are not political appointments) are open only to staff belonging to the SES group, the 
appointment process taking place usually after a long career in the public service. The assumed whole of 
government focus of position systems, with staff mobility across government, is possibly reducing as (i) 
salary broad-banding means that pay can be increased by merit-based increases within the same position – 
so less reason to move (ii) increasing focus on technically specialist positions (many other having been 
contracted out) and so narrower job criteria are making it harder to obtain positions in other departments). Further reading: OECD (2004), Trends in Human Resources Management Policies in OECD countries: An analysis of the

Development of civil service status Australia 
The ratio between  " ongoing "  and  " non-ongoing "  employees is more or less the same since 1996. 
Neither ongoing nor non-ongoing employees are guaranteed life-long employment. Ongoing 
employees may be retrenched if they are not needed following a change in workplace needs. Belgium 
Six-year  " mandate "  system for managers (Director General, and two levels below). Canada 
The ratio of term/casual employees is increasing against employees on indeterminate terms. Denmark 
Significant reductions are to be expected in the number of civil servants. Civil service 
employment is being replaced by collective agreement employment. Temporary employment is 
becoming more popular in hiring at the managerial level. In 2001, about 19% of all heads of 
division had fixed-term employment contracts. Finland 
In jobs of a permanent nature, permanent contracts/employment relationships are used. But there 
is no tenure i.e. there is always a possibility to give notice if there are legal grounds. There is also 
a possibility to use fixed-term contracts if needed on operational grounds. Hungary 
In 2001, 18 930 administrators and blue collar workers were placed under the scope of the 
Labour Code. Following a 2003 new amendment to the Civil Service Act, administrators have 
been placed back under the rules of the civil service act, but lower ranking officials remain under 
the scope of the general labour code. Ireland 
Contractualisation has taken place on an ad hoc basis and applies to a minor proportion of civil or 
indeed public service staff and affects only lower grade staff. Korea 
Since 1998, 20% of senior posts in central government have been open for competition. Those 
recruited from non-government sectors are appointed under a fixed-term contract. New Zealand 
In the public service, 93% of staff are on open-term contracts, 7% are on fixed-term contracts. Sweden 
With the exception of very few positions (such as judges), all lifelong employment in the Swedish 
Government administration has been replaced by employment on a permanent contract basis. 
This means that government employees are under the same legislation for employment 
protection as any employee in Sweden. Today, more than 95% of government staff are employed 
under a permanent contract basis. Switzerland 
As from 1 January 2002, there are no more civil servants. All federal staff have employee status 
except only a small category of personnel such as members of federal appeals commissions. United 
Kingdom The civil service makes use of both fixed-term and casual appointments alongside its permanent 
staff in order to give managers flexibility to meet genuine short-term needs sensibly and 
economically. Source: OECD (2004), Trends in Human Resources Management Policies in OECD countries: An analysis of the results of the OECD

survey on strategic human resources management, Paris GOV/PGC(2006)10 116 P11. CHARACTERISTICS OF THE SENIOR CIVIL SERVICE Key contacts: Elsa Pilichowski and Edouard Turkisch, OECD GOV Senior civil servants (SCS) refer to the group of civil servants, people working in ministries, 
government departments and agencies, who belong to the top management category. This is a cadre of 
senior executives that have broad management expertise and an overview of public sector values and 
responsibilities. Often senior civil servants are grouped and managed under a different HRM policy than 
other civil servants, and to the extent that it is a clearly delineated group of staff then the stated reason for 
such an arrangement is generally to promote policy coordination between departments and a sense of 
cultural cohesion between high level civil servants. This is particularly important at a time when there is 
some concern about possible erosion in public service values and a shift from whole of government 
concerns to organisation-specific agendas. About this indicator: The senior civil service can be delineated from other groups of staff in several ways: 
@BULLET Defined positions or grades 
@BULLET Distinctive recruitment arrangements 
@BULLET Distinctive term-based appointments, such as fixed term contracts or mandates (fixed term assignment within the 
civil service) 
@BULLET Separate arrangements for performance assessment and remuneration 
@BULLET Distinctive arrangements for promotion and mobility which emphasise a whole of government perspective 
@BULLET Training focus on whole of government and strategic leadership. Highlights: There are some tentative signs of more career-based approaches within the senior civil services of 
otherwise strongly position-based systems. This might represent a focus on a  " whole of government "  
approach in the face of increasingly complex policy challenges. Further reading: OECD (2007), State of the civil service, Paris. (forhcoming)

INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORKS FOR PAY DETERMINATION Key contacts: Elsa Pilichowski, Edouard Turkisch, OECD GOV Pay determination arrangements comprise the arrangements for pay bargaining with labour unions or 
other representatives of the workforce, and the managerial arrangements for pay determination within the 
available fiscal envelope. The latter, ideally, provide incentives both for operational efficiency and for 
longer term maintenance of capacity. About this indicator: Pay bargaining can lie along a rough spectrum: 
(i) no pay bargaining (pay decided on the basis of recommendations by an independent review body or pay 
decided on the basis of recommendations by the president etc.); 
(ii) single collective bargaining (bargaining for the entire public service, by functional subsectors, or at the 
workplace level); 
(iii) two tiers of collective bargaining (central level and negotiations by professional groups or central level and 
negotiations at the work place). 
The managerial arrangements for pay determination within the available resources comprise (i) arrangements for 
providing budget envelopes for staffing in the context of delegated pay bargaining (ii) incentives for ministries and 
departments to use their delegated pay bargaining authority to achieve efficiency and (iii) incentives for ministries 
and departments to maintain and develop capacity for the long term. Further reading: OECD (2007), The State of the Civil Service, Paris. (forthcoming)

and budgetary difficulties faced by OECD member countries from the mid-1970s. Reasons for introducing 
PRP are multiple, but focus essentially on improving the individual motivation and accountability of civil 
servants as a way to improve performance. The introduction of PRP is one facet of a wider movement 
towards increased pay flexibility and individualisation in OECD public sectors. There is no single model of 
PRP in the public sector across the OECD. Models are diverse – but with some common trends: @BULLET PRP has spread from management level to cover many different categories of staff @BULLET There has been some increase in the use of collective performance schemes, at the team/unit or 
organisational level @BULLET There is increasing diversity in the criteria employed – and qualitative assessments are now used 
more often as an accompaniment @BULLET A normalised distribution of gradings is increasingly required About this indicator: Performance related pay can vary along several dimensions: 
@BULLET The range of staff that it is applied to 
@BULLET The nature of the targets and the incentives – individual or group 
@BULLET The degree to which forced rankings are used 
@BULLET The size of performance-related rewards Highlights: The size of performance payments is generally modest – with flexible awards generally less than 10 
per cent of the base salary. Further reading: OECD (2007), The State of the Civil Service, Paris. (Forthcoming)

and proper in serving the public interest. Values stated in public documents provide the basis for an 
environment where citizens know about the mission and the vision of public organisations and they also 
give overall guidance for daily public service operations. OECD countries include public service values in 
the legal framework and employ a number of measures to communicate those to public servants. About this indicator: Countries define a wide variety of ethical values reflecting their respective national, social, political and administrative 
contexts. The list of values includes more abstract basic values, such as impartiality, legality, integrity, transparency, 
but it also integrates specific derivative values. The latter require that the generally expected behaviour be applied in a 
more specific situation or relationship, for example political neutrality. 
The stated ethical values can also be classified as  " traditional "  and  " new " . Traditional values reflect the fundamental 
mission of the public service, while  " new values "  articulate the requirements of a new ethos. These new professional 
values have provided a bigger space to bring values in line with recent public management and governance reforms. 
The core public service values are enacted in statues, general laws, and even constitutions and basic laws as well as 
in special civil service or public service regulations. They tend to be automatically provided to civil servants. Highlights: Countries have maintained and redefined their traditional societal and democratic values, the most 
frequent being impartiality (no discrimination), neutrality, integrity and honesty (requiring the highest 
ethical standards), and justice and fairness. Further stated democratic values are legality (respect of the rule 
of law and especially the provisions of the Constitution), transparency and openness, including the proper 
disclosure of public information. New professional values show a wider range of variation. Eleven OECD 
countries defined efficiency as a core public service value. Other professional values include responsibility 
(both maintaining reputation and responsibility for faults), accountability (with the closest public scrutiny) 
and obedience; equality; service in the public interest and loyalty and fidelity for the State; confidentiality; 
professional competence and excellence; as well as merit-based employment. Newly stated professional 
values, such as service-mindedness (e.g. in Australia, Finland), achieving results (e.g. in Australia) or 
earning of citizens' satisfaction (e.g. Hungary), indicate the new approach in the public management ethos. In most cases, statutes and general laws comprise the core values; nevertheless OECD countries also 
use Constitutions, basic laws and the special civil service or public service regulations for stating core 
values for the public service. Further reading: OECD (2000), Trust in Government: Ethics Measures in OECD Countries, Paris. Aspects of government measured by the indicator: General government Activities

SCOPE OF THE CONFLICT OF INTEREST POLICY Key contact: János Bertók, OECD GOV Sources of conflict of interest are activities that could significantly affect the full and impartial 
exercise of official duties and are often considered as incompatible with public service employment. 
Conflicts largely arise from financial and economic interest at the time when public officials work in 
particularly close contact with the private sector. However any situations where actions taken in an official 
capacity could be seen as being influenced by an individual's personal interest can give rise to a conflict of 
interest. The introduction of a conflicts-of-interest policy (COI) across OECD countries has been driven by 
rising public expectations for transparency in public life and closer public scrutiny by the media and 
opposition parties. About this indicator: The objective of an effective conflict-of-interest policy is not the prohibition of all private capacity interests; it is rather 
to maintain a merited public confidence in the integrity of official decision making and public management. Two 
major approaches can be found: 
1. A principles-based approach, where a set of principles play the key role by stating what is expected of 
public office holders, while rules and procedures have a rather complementary role. 
2. A rules-based approach that employ detailed enforceable standards. However these standards are also 
based on fundamental public service principles that embody aspirational goals. 
The two key dimensions affecting the construction of COI policies are widely held to be: 
1. The activities and situations identified as holding potential for conflicts of interest (business interests and 
other external activities and positions and personal financial dealings, such as holding significant assets, 
liabilities or debts, hospitality; and family and personal relationships, etc.) 
2. The categories of public officials considered to be most at risk. Highlights: The fundamental rules of the conflict of interest policy are considered so important that they are 
included in the legal framework of all OECD countries. General principles and basic rules can be found in 
laws on public or civil service and public administration. In a few countries the principles are found in the 
Constitution. Specific laws increasingly cover sensitive areas for particular groups and often contain 
procedures and guidance, in the form of regulations, on how to handle such situations. Similarly, ancillary 
employment arrangements and taking additional positions, either outside or inside the public service, are 
considered a major potential for conflicts or interest. An increasing number of countries have established 
specific policy that deals particularly with the business interests of public officials. Further reading: OECD (2003), Managing Conflict of Interest in the Public Service, OECD Guidelines and Country

ENFORCING THE CONFLICT OF INTEREST POLICY Key contact: János Bertók, OECD GOV Consequences for breaching a COI Policy are either personal, including disciplinary actions and 
criminal prosecution or managerial, including the cancellation of an affected decision or contract. 
However, prevention is better than cure, in which measures such as effective provision of information and 
timely guidance for uncertain situations play key part. About this indicator: The key drivers of effective implementation and enforcement of a COI policy are widely held to be: 
1. Comprehensive information on the policy 
2. Ready access to guidance and consultation if in doubt 
3. Explicit measures to resolve conflict-of-interest situations 
4. Effective and credible sanction for breaching the conflict-of-interest policy. Highlights: In regard to the provision of information, common practice is to provide training and briefing public 
officials on existing regulations and policies in place. Induction training for new entrants is accompanied 
by in-service training in some countries. Countries also seek to institutionalise the provision of information 
on the COI policy by, for instance, including relevant standards in appointment contracts. While training 
and distribution of policy documents are the principal measures for awareness-raising, managers play a 
crucial role in creating a working environment with open communication between the employer and 
employees where the actual difficulties of implementation and COI policy can be openly raised and 
discussed. Managers also play a key role in monitoring compliance of staff with rules. Government 
organisations (for example the civil service department) and even external institutions (commissions, 
Auditor General, Ombudsman and even the Constitutional Court) take an overall interest in monitoring the 
implementation of conflict-of-interest policy and the compliance of the most senior officials. OECD 
countries mainly employ disciplinary actions and criminal prosecution along with the cancellation of 
affected decisions and contracts. Non-disclosure of conflict of interest is generally considered a serious 
breach, and it results in disciplinary action or even criminal penalties depending on the circumstances of 
the case. In specific cases, when political or senior post holders do not disclose their relevant personal 
interests, it may interrupt their career (loss of mandate for elected officials and resignation in case of 
appointed positions). Ministerial advisors, in addition to losing office, may also have to reimburse the 
remuneration they have received. Further reading: OECD (2003), Managing Conflict of Interest in the Public Service, OECD Guidelines and Country

CONFLICT OF INTEREST POLICIES FOR POST-PUBLIC EMPLOYMENT Key contact: János Bertók, OECD GOV Recent scandals have drawn attention to the importance of avoiding conflicts of interest which can 
arise when a public official leaves office for employment in the business or NGO sectors. The purpose is to 
ensure that former public office holders do not take improper advantage by misusing  " insider information " , 
influence peddling or being rewarded for past decisions. About this indicator: The key drivers of an effective enforcement of a COI policy are widely held to be: 
1. Clear specification of general prohibitions and restrictions of activities and situations holding potential for 
conflicts of interesting post employment for all public officials and specific prohibitions for risk areas. 
2. Flexibility for tailored application of prohibitions (e.g. applying specified time limits) 
3. Support measures for tracking and ensuring implementation. Highlights: 83% of OECD countries set rules – principally in legislation – for avoiding conflict of interest in post-
public employment. The general approach is to focus on public officials rather than on prospective 
employers (however France and the United States impose restrictions in the criminal code for the potential 
or new employer of former public officials) and set general prohibitions that are applicable to all public 
officials. 
Requesting information on post-public employment arrangements is an emerging trend in the OECD 
area. A quarter of countries request information on proposed post-public employment arrangements on 
leaving public office. In addition, there is a  " cooling-off "  period on taking employment with any 
organisation with which the post-office holders had direct and significant official dealings during their last 
year in public office. In Poland it is up to one year, while in Canada a bill currently before the Senate 
proposes a five year period for public office holders in case of lobbying back their former organisation. 
The average time interval for a  " cooling-off "  period is one year, however some countries expand this 
period to two years (e.g. Greece) or even five years (e.g. France, Germany and Turkey). Prohibitions 
principally related to accepting future employment or appointment (e.g. to board of directors, advisory or 
supervisory bodies, etc.) and misusing  " insider information " . 
Only a few countries have established procedures for facilitating the application of prohibitions and 
restrictions. For example Canada, Ireland, Portugal and Spain request officials to disclose future 
employment and require approval before taking up a new outside appointment. Countries exceptionally 
employ support measures for tracking and ensuring implementation of decisions, such as recording 
approval-decisions on individual cases, for example in Canada, France, Japan, Norway and the United 
Kingdom; making available past decisions for benchmarking, for example in Canada, France and Japan, 
and informing prospective employers of imposed restrictions and conditions, for example in Germany and 
the United Kingdom. Imposing suitable sanctions remain a key challenge for many countries Further reading: OECD (2006), Avoiding Conflict of Interest in Post-Public Employment: Comparative Overview of

people who elected them and more responsive to their demands and needs. From the public's point of 
view, an open government is one where businesses, civil society organisations and citizens can obtain 
relevant information and services from the government and take part in decision-making processes. About this indicator: The principles of good governance are increasingly enshrined within a set of laws: 
@BULLET Laws on access to information: seeking to give the citizen a right of access to information held by government, 
which is a precondition for public scrutiny; 
@BULLET Laws on privacy and data protection (setting out the restrictions or exceptions where information cannot be 
provided to the public in the interest of protecting personal data); 
@BULLET Laws on administrative procedures: providing some guarantees for citizens in their interactions with government 
and establishing mechanisms for holding administrative powers accountable; 
@BULLET Laws on ombudsman institutions: offering a point of contact for citizens' complaints, appeals and claims for 
redress in their dealings with the public administration; 
@BULLET Laws on Supreme Audit Institutions: providing independent review of public accounts as well as of the execution 
of government programmes and projects; 
@BULLET Laws on electronic data and signatures: safeguarding electronic data and its use is an area of increasing concern 
for citizens and has led several OECD Member countries to introduce new legislation. Highlights: The scope, quantity and quality of government information provided to the public have increased 
significantly in the past 20 years. In 1980 less than a third of the (then 24) OECD countries had legislation 
on access to information, by 2004 it had reached over 90%. Most countries also legally guarantee the 
privacy of certain personal data, either through separate legislation or through sections within overall 
government access to information legislation. Over two-thirds of OECD countries have established 
parliamentary commissioners for data protection and privacy. All OECD countries have a supreme Audit 
Institution, in most cases an independent authority reporting to the legislature. While in 1960 only Sweden, 
Finland and Denmark had ombudsman office, 90% of OECD countries have them today. Trends: As citizens' demands have gone beyond scrutiny to voice, governments have been prompted to go 
beyond openness to engagement. The measurement challenge in the future will be to a) capture the 
multiple dimensions of openness (transparency, accessibility, responsiveness) and b) measure the extent to 
which provisions for openness are actually implemented in practice. Further reading: OECD (2005),  " Open Government "  in Modernising Government: The Way Forward, Paris.

LEGAL FRAMEWORK FOR E-GOVERNMENT SERVICE PROVISION Key contacts: Gwendolyn Carpenter, Edwin Lau, OECD GOV OECD country experiences show that a proper legal framework is a prerequisite for the success of e-
government initiatives. E-government services and processes (i.e. transactional and data-sharing 
procedures) remain under-developed without a legal equivalence between digital and paper processes. About this indicator: The parameters of the legal framework for e-government are: 
@BULLET 
Equivalence -To establish the formal recognition of e-government processes their formal legal recognition 
and standing vis-à-vis the equivalent paper process. 
@BULLET 
Data sharing legislation -OECD countries are transforming government through use of ICT and ICT-
enabled governance structures, new collaboration models and  " networked "  administrations. Current 
regulation frameworks based on the assumption that agencies work alone can inhibit collaboration and 
information sharing between organisations. Of particular relevance is the legal area of privacy. 
@BULLET 
Simplification of national legislation -If agencies are unable to determine what is required of them, they 
are likely to be unwilling to invest in a project that may not conform with requirements. 
@BULLET 
Mandating Uptake -Governments are increasingly seeking to deliver on promises of increased efficiency 
and transparency by focusing on integrating business processes, improving take-up and promoting the 
development of online seamless services. Some are experimenting with requiring populations with high 
levels of internet access (e.g. businesses) to undertake certain procedures online, thereby streamlining 
service delivery channels and improving uptake. Highlights: As governments are faced with ensuring take-up of e-government services, legal frameworks are 
being put into place to ensure equivalence to paper-based services and processes, to enable data sharing, 
simplify national legislation and mandate uptake of major building blocks. Electronic signatures have 
different legal standing in different OECD countries depending on legal tradition, history and environment. 
National implementation among EU Member States of the EU Directive on electronic signatures regulates 
the ICT security infrastructure supporting the usage of digital signatures. The EU Directive attributes 
different  " strengths "  (specific security levels) to digital signatures following this regulation. As of 2006, all 
30 OECD countries except for Mexico have passed legislation recognising digital signatures, though a 
much smaller number have actually introduced applications beyond a pilot phase. Trends: The OECD was the first intergovernmental organisation to issue guidelines on international policy for 
the protection of privacy in computerised data processing. In 1980, the Guidelines on the Protection of 
Privacy and Trans-border Flows of Personal Data were adopted as a Recommendation of the OECD 
Council. They were followed by the 1985 Declaration on Transborder Data Flows, and by the Ministerial 
Declaration on the Protection of Privacy on Global Networks, adopted by OECD Ministers in 1988. Further reading: OECD (2005), e-Government for Better Government, Paris.

and within public sector entities. Increasingly, public infrastructure concerns encompass not only hardware 
and communication requirements, but also shared enabling services such as electronic identity 
management and Public Key Infrastructure (PKI). These allow other electronic services to take place in a 
secure environment. This requires knowledge and understanding not only of what hardware solutions are in 
place, but also core public governance issues such as which users connected by the networks, the rules by 
which they interact, the user requirements and rights association with the use of network components, and 
the overall level of confidence for networked collaboration. About this indicator: The key parameters of e-government infrastructure arrangements are: 
@BULLET Capacity: As e-government services and users' expectations become more sophisticated, they will require 
increased bandwidth. 
@BULLET Access Across Levels of Government: In order to effectively deliver electronic services, central governments 
need to be in touch with local governments that are closest to citizens. 
@BULLET Interconnectivity: As technologies evolve and as e-government tends to be implemented in many places at the 
same time within government, different public networks may not be able to connect. 
@BULLET Interoperability: Once public networks are connected, the different actors using them need to speak the same 
language and have appliances and software able to communicate with each other. Identifying a common language 
(e.g. XML) for the exchange of data is essential for shared services. This can have implications for how services 
are organised and can touch on sensitive issues such as the work processes of government agencies. 
@BULLET Security: Citizens entrust their personal data to government with the understanding that such data will not be 
misused. Are the databases and networks of the government secure? Have steps been put in place to ensure that 
security protections are commensurate with the level of sensitivity of the transaction and the data involved? Highlights: Most OECD countries have the major elements of their public ICT infrastructure in place at the 
central government level. Connecting local government remains a challenge. Standardisation of hardware 
and data standards is a major priority, but is still in an early stage for the majority of countries. Trends: Infrastructure concerns revolve increasingly around the standardisation of data and processes by end 
point users in order to make the most of network infrastructure. For security issues, the focus has moved 
towards establishing and following processes and procedures rather than simply ensuring physical data 
security. Further reading: OECD (2005), e-Government for Better Government, Paris.

late 1990s, has given way to a concern that individual e-government projects should demonstrate their 
contribution to overall government objectives. Countries are using business case methodologies to 
demonstrate the costs, risks and expected returns – in terms of both savings to government and benefits to 
citizens and businesses – resulting from ICT investment. In order to measure the impact of e-government, 
it is first necessary to decide what type of costs and benefits to consider and the population to whom these 
costs and benefits will accrue. About this indicator: Government-wide approaches to e-government cost and benefit analysis vary along several dimensions: 
@BULLET 
The methodologies used in ICT cost and benefit analysis studies. 
@BULLET 
How results are analysed and applied. 
@BULLET 
How the methodology is developed. 
@BULLET 
Who are the stakeholders involved. 
@BULLET 
How the resulting methodology is applied. 
@BULLET 
How benefits realisation initiatives can best be guided in order to better help e-government projects achieve 
overall programme objectives. Highlights: While the cost and benefit analysis methodologies in support of ICT business cases are not unique, 
they do have to take into account certain specificities related to both ICT spending and the horizontal 
nature of e-government. In a number of countries, governments have begun to establish clear guidelines or 
requirements for the way e-government projects should be evaluated. Such standard methodology 
promotes the diffusion of cost benefit analysis across government and promotes more standardised data 
about the costs and benefits of e-government investments for the public sector as a whole. 
The earlier OECD studies showed that only a few countries (Australia, Canada and the United States) 
were using more complex and costly value assessment methods. Ex ante business case information is 
mandated by many governments, but it is less common to verify, ex post, whether or not the expected 
benefits have been achieved. Trends: Countries are increasingly willing to mandate the use of business cases and of standard cost and 
benefit analysis methodologies in order to allow them to compare and prioritise investments and to capture 
all benefits resulting from ICT investments. Further reading: OECD (2005), e-Government for Better Government, Paris.

TYPES OF PERFORMANCE MEASURES USED Key contact: Teresa Curristine, OECD GOV Performance – assessing it and improving it – has pre-occupied governments for at least half a 
century. Over the past two decades, public sector performance has taken on special urgency as OECD 
countries have faced recessions, mounting demands for more and better public services, and in some 
countries, citizens increasingly unwilling to pay higher taxes. Accompanying these pressures have been 
demands for more public accountability. About this indicator: Public sector performance reforms focus on government results, defined as outputs and outcomes of their activities. 
They aim at improving the efficiency, effectiveness and value for money of public activities. The evidence about 
performance that is collected and used systematically – called performance information -may be quantitative 
(numerical) or qualitative (descriptive). 
The usefulness of performance information is enhanced by applying standards and other types of comparison (for 
example, with past performance, other lines of business, or level of need) which allow judgments to be made about 
the extent to which interventions are achieving desired results: 
@BULLET Performance measures and indicators are particular values or characteristic used to measure output or outcomes. 
@BULLET Evaluations also provide information on performance but often include a more detailed review of attributes and 
causality issues. Evaluations typically include recommendations on changes to activities or programmes to 
improve performance. 
@BULLET Benchmarking making comparisons within carefully selected parameters can sustain a productive debate about 
how and why things differ between settings and options for reform Highlights: Over the past two decades, there has been a renewed emphasis on performance measures (principally 
of outputs and outcomes) in budgeting and management. Countries appear to have recognised the dangers 
of concentrating only on outputs. It can give rise to goal displacement as agencies risk losing sight of the 
intended impact of their programmes on wider society, and concentrate on quantifiable activities at the 
expense of those that are less measurable. It can also result in less attention being paid to cross-cutting 
issues. While outcomes incorporate a wider focus on the impact of programmes on society and have 
greater appeal to politicians and the public, some are difficult to measure. Of the countries that developed 
performance measures, the majority produce a combination of outputs and outcomes. Trends: An increasing number of OECD countries are developing performance measures and of those that 
have already developed performance measures more are moving towards the development of outcomes. Further reading: OECD (2005), Modernizing Government: The way forward, Paris.

development and implementation of performance approaches to budgeting and management. This varies 
from countries where the Ministry of Finance (MOF) has no involvement to ones where it is the main 
designer and manager of the performance system. Some countries have combined introducing performance 
management with delegating responsibilities within ministries and to agencies on the theory that managers 
need more freedom to use resources if they are to achieve results. About this indicator: Performance management system covers corporate management based on performance information, performance 
evaluation, monitoring, assessment and performance reporting. In a stricter definition, it can be defined as such 
management cycle under which programme performance objectives and targets are determined, managers have 
flexibility to achieve them, actual performance is measured and reported, and this information feeds into decisions 
about programme funding, design, operations and rewards or penalties. 
Performance budgeting can be broadly defined as any budget that presents information on what agencies have 
done or expect to do with the money provided. A strict definition of performance budgeting, however, is a form of 
budgeting that relates funds allocated to measurable results. Highlights: The most common responsibility for the ministries of finance is providing horizontal support for 
developing performance measures. This is closely followed by their role of applying performance results in 
resource allocation and/or programme or policy decisions and the monitoring of progress against targets. 
Spending ministries have a strong role in developing and setting performance measures, monitoring 
progress and applying performance results in resource allocation and/or programme and policy decisions. 
The relevant spending ministry and the national audit body play the greatest role in commissioning 
evaluations. As the results show, in 32 % of countries spending ministries develop their own performance 
measures and set their own targets and there is no involvement of the MOF or other central agencies. In 
48% of countries, the MOF agrees either the performance targets (16%) or both the targets and measures 
developed by spending ministries (32%). Moreover, neither do the majority of MOFs have a unit in charge 
of setting/monitoring performance measures of spending ministries. Only 37% of responding countries 
have a specific unit in their MOF. Further reading: OECD (2005), Modernizing Government: The way forward. Paris.

government operations more efficient, a major issue is how this information is used in budgetary decision 
making to motivate agencies to improve performance. The MOF potentially has a variety of tools at its 
disposal, which includes the ability to confer money, freedom and recognition on spending 
ministries/agencies. While rewarding good performance is appealing, it does not take into account 
budgetary constraints and government priorities. Performance measures also only provide a snapshot of 
performance in time and do not explain the underlying causes of bad performance. In addition, there is 
always the danger that linking results to financial resources can create incentives to "game" in presenting 
performance information, particularly when performance information is not independently audited. About this indicator: Performance measures can contribute to budgetary decision-making in the budget process in different ways. 
Presentational: In this category performance information is included, at best, as background information only. It 
does not play a role in decision making on allocations nor is it necessarily intended to do so. 
Informed or indirect linkage: The second grouping is performance informed budgeting. This is a form of 
budgeting that relates resources to results in an indirect manner. Indirect linkage implies that results – along with 
other information on performance or other information pertaining to macro restrictions on fiscal policy and policy 
priorities – are being actively and systematically used to inform budget decisions. Performance information is 
important, but it is not absolute and does not have a predefined weight in the decisions. The final weightings will 
depend on the particular policy context. 
Direct linkage: The third category is direct performance budgeting. Direct linkage involves the allocation of 
resources directly and explicitly to units of performance. Appropriations can thus be based on a formula/contract 
with specific performance or activity indicators. Funding is directly based on results achieved. This form of 
performance budgeting is used only in specific sectors in a limited number of OECD countries. Highlights: In most sectors and cases, performance measures are loosely connected to decisions in the budget 
process. While performance targets are rarely or never used to determine budget allocations, they are, 
however, often used by the MOF in the budget process along with other information on performance 
and/or information on fiscal policy and political priorities to inform budget allocations. A direct linkage, 
where the results determine funding, creates a greater incentive for gaming. However, performance 
informed budgeting presents a danger that not enough weight will be given to performance information or 
that it can be sidelined, especially when other information is being considered. MoFs have taken a cautious 
approach to using performance information to financially punish or reward agencies or individuals. When 
programmes show poor performance, the most common course of action is that resources are held constant 
and the programme is reviewed during the course of the year. Further reading: OECD (2005), Modernizing Government: The way forward. Paris.

while representing the government and to make the diverse activities of individual ministries and agencies work 
effectively as a whole. The structure of Government Offices varies more among countries than in the case of 
sectoral ministries. It must reflect constitutional and legal requirements, must be sensitive to changeable 
political factors, and must be highly adaptable to the needs and personality of the Prime Minister of the moment. About this indicator: @BULLET The Government Office (GO) is a generic term that refers to the administrative body that serves the head of the 
government (normally the Prime Minister) and the Council of Ministers (the regular, usually weekly, meeting of 
Government ministers, referred to in different countries as the Cabinet, the Government meeting, or sometimes 
just 'the Government'). The official name of the Government Office varies from country to country, for example, 
General Secretariat, Government Office, Government Secretariat, Chancellery, Cabinet Office, etc. 
@BULLET The Prime Minister's Office (PMO) refers to the office that serves specifically the head of the government, 
normally the Prime Minister. Often it is referred to in Europe as the Prime Minister's cabinet. PMO are subgroup 
of GO but in some countries, the entire organ serving the Government is called Prime Minister's Office (PMO) 
(e.g. Australia, Denmark, the Netherlands, and Poland). 
@BULLET These units may be staffed with civil servants or political appointees, and generally contain the equivalent of a 
strategic planning unit which ensures that the government's deliberations on its strategic priorities take place 
with the benefit of a broad assessment of the overall economic, political and social situation, and that priorities 
are harmonised with other strategic documents of the government. Highlights: While the organisational charts of different Government Offices reveal large variations, there are 
fundamental similarities concerning their basic structure. It generally comprises a permanent element, to ensure 
stability and continuity of procedure and policy knowledge, so that a change of government does not cause a 
dislocation of business and a loss of institutional memory; and some temporary elements, to allow for some 
political advice that can be changed with each Prime Minister. Government Offices are staffed mainly by civil 
servants, since their functions are predominantly organisational and managerial. Most of these are permanent 
Government Office employees. The practice of seconding Government Office staff from ministries is not 
widespread. More surprising is that, civil servants also make up most of the staff in the majority of Premier 
Minister Offices, and in fewer countries the staff consists primarily of political appointees. The leadership of the 
GO, however, is on aggregate more susceptible to political appointment. Trends: Functions: paradoxically perhaps, decentralisation and delegation have prompted a strengthening of GO 
capacities to monitor implementation of government programme, reflected in the establishment of new units 
within, or reporting directly to, the GO (e.g. Australia's Implementation Unit). Tools: another clear trend is the 
increasing use of new ICT to streamline internal consultations during policy preparation and a move towards 
'paperless' law drafting. Further reading: OECD (2004), A Comparative Analysis of Government Offices in OECD Countries, Paris. Aspects of government measured by the indicator: General government Activities

communication. While all ministers and ministries will insist on having their own communications 
capability, virtually all OECD governments also place an overall responsibility for communications at the 
Government Office. About this indicator: The Government office has the overall responsibility for communications in order to: 
@BULLET Speak on behalf of the Government as a whole. 
@BULLET Support the Prime Ministers when speaking on behalf of the Government collectively. 
@BULLET Ensure that the information provided by one Ministry is consistent with information issued by others, that initiatives 
are synchronized and that announcements are timed to maximize their impact. 
Common mechanisms used for coordinating communications are: 
@BULLET a requirement that every proposal submitted to the Cabinet of Minister should include a section proposing how the 
decision should be communicated to the public; 
@BULLET weekly meetings of the communications advisers of Ministers, chaired by the Government Spokesperson; 
@BULLET a weekly item on communications in the Cabinet of Minister meeting; and a system within the GO for strategic 
communications planning. Highlights: All OECD countries place the responsibility for managing the communications units at the centre of 
Government, except Australia, Czech Republic and France. The number of staff employed in these units 
varies enormously: from a total of 100 staff in the Government Office and Prime Minister's Office in the 
UK to 3 in the Prime Minister's Office in Belgium and 3 in the Government Office in New Zealand. Trends: In an information age, the pressure on governments to meet rising public demands for timely, relevant 
and reliable information has led most OECD countries to strengthen the public communication functions of 
the Government Office and the Prime Minister's Office. The rise of Internet and 24-hr TV coverage has 
plunged Government Offices into a global information marketplace where they must 'compete' with many 
other information sources. At the same time, new ICT have provided the tools for more direct 
communication between governments and their citizens. Further reading: OECD (2004), A Comparative Analysis of Government Offices in OECD Countries, Paris. Aspects of government measured by the indicator: General government Activities

development and consumer welfare by encouraging market entry, market openness, innovation and 
competition. The OECD has established Principles for Regulatory Quality and Performance to support 
transparent, non discriminatory and efficiently applied regulatory processes. The quality of regulatory 
policies depends on a well-established set of government institutions. Highlights: The institutional settings that promote quality in regulatory management systems have evolved 
considerably strengthened between 1998 and 2005. While only 19 countries had a dedicated body 
responsible for promoting regulatory policy in 1998, 24 countries had one in 2005 (out of those countries 
for which the information is available both years). The role and responsibilities of these bodies have also 
been strengthened, with more frequent consultation when developing new regulation, and an improved 
capacity for monitoring progress in key sectors and for analysing regulatory impact. Nearly three quarters 
of the respondents had a minister accountable for promoting government-wide regulatory reform in 2005, 
against slightly more than the half in 1998. 
The majority of countries located their regulatory oversight body at the center of government, in a prime 
minister's office or a presidential office, with some form of interdepartmental coordination. Ministries of 
finance and ministries of justice also play a significant role. These are generally relatively small units, with 
approximately 20/30 staff in Australia, the Czech Republic, Denmark, the European Commission or 
Poland, but generally staffed at a high technical and political level. Korea has a significant unit, with nearly 
90 staff between the Regulatory Reform Task Force, and the Office for Regulatory Reform, attesting the 
very significant investment made by Korea in Regulatory Reform. The United Kingdom also has 
significant staffing levels in its central unit, with nearly 70 staff, as does the US with 50 staff. Germany 
just set up a regulatory control unit (Normen Kontrol Rat) with broad responsibilities under the new 
coalition treaty of November 2005. Italy, France and Switzerland tend to have comparatively smaller units. Further reading: OECD (2006), Indicators of regulatory management systems quality, Paris. Aspects of government measured by the indicator: General government Activities

Social protection About this indicator: Appropriate regulatory institutions are a key element to develop and implement regulatory policy. Key institutions 
include regulatory oversight bodies, located at the centre of the government administration, with a broad remit to 
build consensus on regulatory policy, assist regulators in implementation, undertake quality control (through 
regulatory impact analysis for example) and report on overall performance in achieving regulatory policy objectives. 
Other institutional elements include independent regulators, where required, to ensure that appropriate regulatory 
incentives exist and that conflicting policy agendas do not undermine the achievement of regulatory outcomes. GOV/PGC(2006)10 171 Table P27.1. Policy drivers for regulatory quality Functions of the body in charge of regulatory oversight Consulted

RULE MAKING PROCEDURES Key contacts: Stephane Jacobzone, Chang-Won Choi, Claire Miguet, OECD GOV The OECD Principles for Regulatory Quality and Performance call for transparent, non 
discriminatory and efficiently applied regulatory processes. This involves consulting with all significantly 
affected parties and also ensuring that administrative procedures for applying regulations are transparent, 
non discriminatory and contain an appeal process. Transparency is a pillar of effective regulation as the 
third OECD Guiding Principle for Regulatory Quality and Performance states that governments should 
"Ensure that regulations, regulatory institutions charged with implementation, and regulatory processes are 
transparent and non discriminatory". Highlights: All countries, except Iceland, reported some form of standard administrative procedures for drafting 
laws and new subordinate regulations. Between 1998 and 2005, rule making procedures have also been 
considerably strengthened. This probably reflects regulatory reform efforts, with the introduction of 
Administrative Procedure Acts (APAs) as tools for controlling excessive administrative discretion. 
Countries such as Korea, Mexico or Japan did follow the example of the United States or Canada which 
have had Administrative Procedure Acts respectively since 1946 and 1971. In Canada, the making and 
scrutiny subordinate law is governed by the Statutory Instruments Act issued in 1971. However, a number 
of countries do not have such laws, and instead have guidelines or procedural requirements issued by the 
center of government, such as the principles issued by the Prime Ministry in Turkey. A periodical publication of the list of laws to be prepared, modified or reformed in the next six 
months or more is only available in slightly more than half of the OECD countries, and in the EU. Only a 
third of the countries reported having such a list for subordinate regulations. When this list existed, it was 
always available to the public, for example on the Internet, and both for primary laws or for subordinate 
regulations. In Australia, regulatory plans are required to be published annually by each government 
regulatory agency. In Denmark, the government presents its annual law planning programme at the 
beginning of each parliamentary year, in October. In Korea, the Ministry of Legislation publishes in the 
internet the yearly law enactment/amendment plans by each ministry. In Mexico, the requirement is that all 
federal agencies must submit their regulatory plans for the next two years. In Poland, the plans are updated 
every 6 months. In Switzerland, the yearly objectives of the Government, the Federal Council and of the 
Departments are publicly available. There is also a "legislature plan" covering the four year periods 
between each parliamentary election. Further reading: OECD (2006), Indicators of regulatory management systems quality, Paris. Aspects of government measured by the indicator: General government Activities

1998 Note: See Q4:a),a(ii),b(ii), 2005 OECD Regulatory Indicators Questionnaire, GOV/PGC/REG(2005)12/ANN1. The sample includes 27 
countries. The responses of the EU, Luxembourg, Poland and the Slovak Republic could not be taken into account since no data was 
available for 1998 . 27 GOV/PGC(2006)10 178 P29. CONSULTATIONS AND PARTICIPATION FROM THE PUBLIC Key contacts: Stephane Jacobzone, Chang-Won Choi, Claire Miguet, OECD GOV The ability of citizens and businesses to understand fully their regulatory environment and to have a 
voice in regulatory decision making is a key feature of efficient and participative regulatory systems. In 
addition to the consultation processes, the openness of the consultation process in itself is important. Highlights: While participation is open to any member of the public in two-thirds of OECD countries, with views 
of participants in the consultation process made public, this is less frequently the case for subordinate 
regulations, where participation is open to the public in half of the countries. In some countries, 
participation of the public is limited to the affected parties. There is also a requirement to respond in 
writing in 8 countries to parties that make comments. Few countries monitor the quality of the consultation 
process -Canada, Poland, Switzerland (but only for primary laws), Turkey and the United Kingdom. Informal consultations with selected groups is the most frequently used form of consultation, 
particularly for subordinate regulations. Australia relies more on informal consultation mechanism, which 
set it apart from other countries with a similar legal tradition such as the United States or the United 
Kingdom. Generally, formal consultation requirements tend to be limited to those involved in the 
Regulatory Impact Statement. However, more systematic methods, such as broad circulation for comment, 
setting up an advisory group or posting drafts on websites are also relatively widely used -by two thirds of 
the countries for subordinate regulations. The more rigorous process of public notice and comment, or the 
possibility of a public meeting was only available in less than half of the countries. The US, Mexico and 
Spain had such notice and comment procedures for subordinate regulations but not for primary laws. In 
contrast, Switzerland, Portugal Ireland and Greece had such mechanisms for laws but not for subordinate 
regulations. The quality of the comments depends on the time offered to businesses and citizens to comment. 
Practices differ widely across countries. While Switzerland, Sweden, the United Kingdom and New 
Zealand offer twelve weeks for comments, the US offers eight weeks and other countries such as Canada, 
Greece, Japan, Turkey, Mexico, Austria, Germany and Finland offer four weeks. Norway and the EU are 
somewhere between these two groups. This period is only two weeks in Spain, Iceland, the Netherlands, 
and Poland, and three in Korean and the Slovak Republic Further reading: OECD (2006), Indicators of regulatory management systems quality, Paris. Aspects of government measured by the indicator: General government Activities

regulatory policy is a challenging task involving standardised processes for making and updating regulations, 
consultations with interested parties, effective communication of the law and plain language drafting, controls on 
administrative discretion and effective implementation and appeals processes. GOV/PGC(2006)10 179 Table P29.1. Forms of public consultation Informal

USE OF REGULATORY TOOLS AND PROCESSES Key contacts: Stephane Jacobzone, Chang-Won Choi, Claire Miguet, OECD GOV Regulatory practices have generated a range of tools to improve new and existing regulations. The 
current discussion distinguishes processes, which include transparency, consultation and communication, 
from regulatory quality tools, which include a range of available techniques that need to be deployed in a 
consistent and mutually supporting manner to reflect an integrated systemic quality assurance system. Highlights One striking feature is the increasing reliance on regulatory impact analysis as well as the systematic 
evaluation of regulatory programmes for specific sectors or policy areas – although this evaluation method 
tends to be less practiced from a government-wide perspective. The explicit assessment of regulatory 
alternatives existed either government-wide or for specific sectors in at least two thirds of the countries. Further reading: OECD (2006), Indicators of regulatory management systems quality, Paris. Aspects of government measured by the indicator: General government Activities

DIMENSIONS CONSIDERED IN REGULATORY IMPACT ANALYSIS Key contacts: Stephane Jacobzone, Chang-Won Choi, Claire Miguet, OECD GOV The use of Regulatory Impact Analysis (RIA) has spread across OECD countries. RIA represents a 
core tool for ensuring the quality of new regulations through a rigorous, evidence based process for 
decision making. A number of policy impacts can be included in RIA, reflecting various policy agendas 
and concerns. Highlights: Over the period 1998-2005, requirements for RIA strengthened significantly with two thirds of the 
countries having established a formal requirement by law in 2005 against a third in 1998. There was also a 
significant increase of the number of countries requiring an assessment of the impact on small businesses 
and other social groups, from roughly half of the countries in 1998 up to over two thirds in 2005. 
A detailed overview of all the impacts required, together with the type of requirement show that all 
impacts do not receive equal priority. The budget impact is the most prevalent, and seems to be almost 
always required. Most countries would in any circumstances assess a budgetary impact, even those without 
a formal RIA system. The requirement for a competition and market openness assessment was always 
required in less than half of the countries, with another significant portion requiring it in other selected 
cases. The impact on small businesses was required in a slightly greater number of cases and countries, 
illustrating the historical role of RIA as a tool to minimise regulatory burdens, which fall 
disproportionately on small businesses. The impact on the public sector was similarly required in two 
thirds of the cases, which has significant implications for "regulation inside government". The UK has the 
most explicit public sector requirement, with an initial public sector RIA. If this initial RIA shows that the 
policy imposes a total of more than £5 million (7.5 million Euros), or would attract high levels of media or 
political interest, a more thorough Public Sector RIA is required. 
These trends show a broadening of potential impacts included in the RIA process and suggest the 
entrenchment of RIA as a tool for policy making, as many social groups and policy concerns request 
consideration in the RIA process. However, this may also lead to a dispersal of efforts. 
Risk assessment was much less prevalent, with only two countries, Iceland and the United Kingdom, 
reporting this requirement as being systematic, and the US and the EU Commission reporting such a 
requirement only for major regulations. Austria, Canada, Denmark, Germany, Korea, Mexico, New 
Zealand, Norway and Turkey required a risk assessment in other selected cases. Data was missing for a 
significant number of countries. Risk assessment was slightly more frequent for environmental issues or 
for health and safety, where half of the countries reported some form of a requirement. Further reading: OECD (2006), Indicators of regulatory management systems quality, Paris. Aspects of government measured by the indicator: General government Activities

Social protection About this indicator: Regulatory Impact Analysis is a tool used to assess the likely effects of a proposed new regulation or regulatory 
change. It involves a detailed analysis to ascertain whether or not the new regulation would have the desired 
impact. It helps to identify any possible side effects or hidden costs associated with regulation and to quantify the 
likely costs of compliance on the individual citizen or business. RIA also clarifies the desired outcomes of the 
proposed regulatory change and provides for consultation with stakeholders. GOV/PGC(2006)10 185 Table P31.1. Regulatory Impact Analysis – assessment of specific impacts Budget Competition Market

political priority for many countries. Cutting red tape is an almost inevitable accompaniment to regulatory 
reform. Burdens from government regulatory requirements have been expanding in most countries in 
recent years, due to more stringent requirements and the expansion of regulation in the environmental, 
safety and health areas. As a counterweight, governments have been seeking to simplify the way in which 
regulatory compliance can be achieved and demonstrated. Highlights: Administrative simplification is becoming a permanent feature of regulatory quality management 
systems. 25 countries had an explicit programme to reduce administrative burdens in 2005 against 20 in 
1998. Programmes to streamline government administrative procedures and use information and 
communication technologies existed in over two thirds of the countries in 2005. 
Programmes with explicit quantitative targets exist in only over a third of OECD countries. The 
gradual inclusion of quantitative targets reflects the impact of the diffusion of the standard cost model, with 
many countries following the example of the Netherlands and the Nordic European countries. Denmark, 
which had pioneered measurement efforts in Europe with an annual aggregate assessment of administrative 
burdens since 1999, is currently mapping all its legislation affecting businesses' administration and 
overhead costs using the Standard Cost Model. Similarly, in Norway, the target is to reduce the 
administrative burdens on businesses by 25% within the year 2012. In Sweden, the measurement of the tax 
area has been completed. In the Czech Republic, the administrative burdens should be reduced by 20%. 
Korea had a target of a 10% reduction of regulations that lag behind the market changes. 
Over two thirds of the countries were modifying and streamlining existing laws, using information 
and communication technologies for regulatory administration together with other streamlining of 
government administrative procedures. Seventeen countries mentioned that they had a system for 
measuring administrative burdens, more than those which reported that they had a complete count of their 
business licences and permits. Many of these countries are developing or implementing a form of a 
Standard Cost Model. Only half of the countries were reallocating powers and responsibilities between 
government departments and/or levels of governments. Further reading: OECD (2006), Indicators of regulatory management systems quality, Paris.

Social protection About this indicator: There are various approaches grouped under administrative simplification and administrative burden reduction, 
which have been integrated in countries' broader regulatory quality systems. Countries modify and streamline 
existing rules, e.g. by applying silence is consent rule; take actions to reduce the number of administrative steps 
by consolidating services to one single window for end users; develop systems to monitor administrative burdens, 
and even redistribute competencies among government institutions. The impact of administrative simplification 
tools grew with increasing availability of e-Government services. GOV/PGC(2006)10 189 Table 32.1. Reducing administrative burdens Cutting the red tape policy

classification. This classification offers a break-down of expenditures into primarily individual and primarily 
collective goods as well as goods in kind and cash transfers. These distinctions determine the structure of 
resource allocation in the public sector. The distinction between in kind and cash transfers indicates the degree 
to which government considers that beneficiaries should retain a spending choice. The significance of the 
distinction between individual and collective goods and services points to different options for service 
provision. For instance with individual goods it is usually technically possible to provide the services as an 
entitlement (a claim of the individual on the state). Also, with individual goods it can be possible (and not 
inefficient in principle) to make consumption dependent on the payment of a private contribution. About this indicator The modified COFOG classification provides the following breakdown Primarily individual goods and services

Modified COFOG data have been provided for the subsector of Central Government for 12 OECD countries 
since 1980 in the OECD publication Reallocation (OECD 2005). Highlights: The modified COFOG classification has been developed within OECD GOV Directorate following 
agreement by the OECD Network of Senior Budget Officials (Working Party of Senior Budget Officials, Expert 
Group meeting, OECD, Paris, 11 February, 2004). The estimation method has been approved by the Head of 
National Accounts (OECD). Full details are provided in How and Why Should Government Activity Be
