			<head>PREFACE<lb/></head>

			<p>Private banks are key actors in economic development. They can also be key actors in<lb/> political development. Private capital movements have risen over the past few decades and bank<lb/> flows have contributed heavily.<lb/> In the context of its activities on Financing for Development, the OECD Development<lb/> Centre monitors these trends and maps both official and private flows to developing countries<lb/> and emerging economies. This paper is part of that effort; at the same time it goes much further<lb/> to examine whether and, if so, why, banks like to lend to new emerging democracies. Much<lb/> attention has been paid in academic literature and policy debates to banks&apos; role in economic<lb/> development; little attention has been given, however, to banks&apos; political preferences and their<lb/> role in political development. This paper begins to fill that gap.<lb/> Using panel data on 29 countries for the period 1984-2004, the authors find that bank<lb/> lending correlates positively with levels of democratisation as measured by different indicators;<lb/> relative stability of economic policy also seems to spur financial inflows. On the contrary,<lb/> frequent cabinet turnovers do not seem to be important determining factors of banks&apos; lending<lb/> behaviour.<lb/></p>

			<p>These findings have direct implications for policy making: the market seems to reward<lb/> democratic transitions and policy stability. Democratisation and political development seem to<lb/> spur increased private flows and contribute to economic development.<lb/> Prof. Louka T.

Les flux bancaires ont pris part à cette dynamique. Néanmoins, excepté quelques rare<lb/> travaux empiriques, peu de travaux ont été consacrés aux facteurs politiques expliquant cet<lb/> essor, et encore moins de recherche a été dédiée à l&apos;économie politique des flux bancaires privés.<lb/> Le travail présenté aborde cette question en croisant une série d&apos;indicateurs sur la démocratie,<lb/> l&apos;incertitude et la stabilité politique, avec les séries de flux bancaires développés par la Banque<lb/> des Règlements Internationaux (BRI). Il propose une économie politique des flux privés<lb/> bancaires internationaux en abordant deux questions : les banques préfèrent-elles la démocratie ?<lb/> Tendent-elles à primer les transitions démocratiques, la stabilité des politiques publiques et la<lb/> stabilité politique ? Un des résultats les plus intéressants du travail présenté est de corroborer<lb/> que les facteurs politiques importent pour les banques internationales. Celles-ci tendent en<lb/> particulier à augmenter leurs prêts internationaux dans les trois années qui suivent une<lb/> transition démocratique. Cette tendance est particulièrement prégnante en Amérique latine où,<lb/> pays vers lesquels les opérations de crédit bancaire internationale ont augmenté avec l&apos;essor de la<lb/> démocratie.<lb/></figure>

			<head>I. INTRODUCTION<lb/></head>

			<p>Wall Street and the City have begun to take a fresh look at emerging markets. During the<lb/> 1990s, financial and economic variables dominated their analysis. Since 2000, political and ethical<lb/> variables have become increasingly relevant. Examples of this interest abound. In 2004 the<lb/> research firm Innovest Strategic Value Advisors and emerging market specialist Rexiter Capital<lb/> Management launched the world&apos;s first &quot; sustainability &quot; investment strategy exclusively focused<lb/> on emerging markets 1 . The major investor of the fund created — the large Dutch pension fund<lb/> ABP — looked for a range of products combining the benefits of the potential performance of<lb/> emerging markets with its own interest in sustainability and governance issues such as climate<lb/> change and human rights. By the end of 2004, a group of leading UK-based investors, which<lb/> manages a combined €330 billion, had set aside a specific portion of its commission budget to<lb/> reward broker research on extra-financial areas such as governance and labour relations. A few<lb/> weeks later, the Norwegian government established ethical guidelines for its huge Oil Petroleum<lb/></p>

			<figure>Fund 2 .<lb/> These examples followed the increasing interest of pension funds such as Calpers — a<lb/> major US pension fund with nearly $170 billion of assets under management in 2005, which<lb/> started to invest in emerging markets in 2000 — in considering non-financial criteria such as<lb/> political stability, transparency and labour rights (along with four other more traditional<lb/> financial criteria). An effect of this approach has been an improvement in ratings, with the scores<lb/> of the 27 countries included in the Calpers financial screening improving on average. Among<lb/> them, Morocco, Malaysia, Sri Lanka and Jordan, all of which were excluded from the list of<lb/> countries suitable for investment in 2002, topped the list for country improvements in 2003<lb/> 3 .<lb/></figure>

			<p>When excluded from foreign investment, emerging-market countries tend to improve their<lb/> governance practices and standards in order to attract investment 4 .<lb/> Like asset managers, bankers also increasingly take into account other variables to assess<lb/> their investment decisions around the world. In 2003, a leading group of top global bankers<lb/> launched the Equator Principles, an unprecedented initiative led by ten of the world&apos;</p>

Since<lb/> then, all the big names in project finance (41 by mid-2006) have signed up for this series of<lb/> guidelines for assessing their project finance deals based on those used by the International<lb/> Finance Corporation (IFC), the World Bank&apos;s private financing arm. Banks with such impeccably<lb/> capitalist credentials as Citibank, BBVA, ABN Amro or HSBC are all lining up to prove that their<lb/> operations can measure up on sustainability goals. In 2006, a new revised set of guidelines<lb/> (Equator II) was approved, expanding requirements for labour conditions, community health,<lb/> safety and security.<lb/></p>

			<p>The financial sector has also increasingly scrutinised human rights issues, mainly a focus<lb/> of industrial companies 6 in the past 7 . Because banks face growing scrutiny from NGOs for their<lb/> role in financial projects that might involve such issues, they can no longer afford to be perceived<lb/> as complicit in ethical and environmental abuses of their customers. Institutional investors,<lb/> particularly those involved in active management and socially responsible funds, ask more<lb/> questions about political governance and human rights, and both issues are on the agendas of<lb/> bankers. Litigation risks have also risen, as exemplified by claims for more than $100 billion<lb/> faced in the United States in 2003 by more than 30 of the world&apos;s leading international banks and<lb/> corporations for their role in supporting apartheid in South Africa. The US lawyer Ed Flagan<lb/> became famous for suing Swiss banks on behalf of Holocaust survivors.<lb/></p>

			<p>The financial sector has witnessed a proliferation of initiatives, mostly voluntary. They<lb/> include among others the 160 financial institutions that are part of the UNEP FI; the 2 300<lb/> business finance and non-commercial participants in the UNG Global Compact; the OECD<lb/> Guidelines for Multinationals Enterprises; the 41 major banks and export credit agencies that<lb/> have adopted the initial Equator Principles; the many FTSE and Fortune 500 pension funds and<lb/> asset managers that have incorporated environmental, social, governance and human-rights<lb/> issues into their investment mandates; and the principles of responsible investment launched in<lb/></p>

			<table>2006 by the UNEPD FI Asset Management.<lb/> At the same time, foreign banks rush towards China. By mid-2005, the Royal Bank of<lb/> Scotland, together with Merrill Lynch and a Hong-Kong based tycoon, secured a deal of<lb/> $3.1 billion for a 10 per cent stake in the Bank of China. The previous year, another UK bank,<lb/> HSBC, paid $1.7 billion for a 20 per cent stake in Bank of Communications. Later Bank of<lb/> America struck a $3 billion deal for 9 per cent of China Construction Bank while Goldman Sachs,<lb/> Deutsche Bank, JP Morgan, ING, Credit Suisse, and many other investment and commercial<lb/> 5.<lb/> See http://www.equator-principles.com/.

The enthusiasm of<lb/> international lenders for diving into the deep waters of China&apos;s high-growth and high-risk banks<lb/> remains hard to fathom. It is based mainly on a conventional, rose-tinted view of China, still<lb/> underdeveloped but with a huge population, and it pays little heed to the political regime.<lb/></table>

			<p>Lured by a huge market economy and &quot; efficient &quot; corruption in the spirit of Shleifer and<lb/> Vishny (1994), FDI runs as high as $60 billion a year, with banks a part of the rush towards the<lb/> Chinese gold mines. Most mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;A) by foreigners have involved buying<lb/> minority stakes in state firms, mainly China&apos;s banks. Goldman Sachs, UBS, Bank of America,<lb/> HSBC, Citigroup and others have spent more than $10 billion on holdings of less than 10 per cent<lb/> in the country&apos;s three major banks. So far China has collected more than $20 billion for stakes in<lb/> banks, investment boutiques and fund-management companies.<lb/> Nevertheless, a new agenda clearly is emerging for private international banks. Political<lb/> issues such as human rights do appear on their radar screens. But what about democracy? What<lb/> about political regimes? Do private banks take them into account in decisions on whether to<lb/> invest in a country? Put another way, do they have political preferences? The Chinese rush might<lb/> suggest a mixed answer, but this paper will show that banks tend to love democracies more than<lb/> initially suspected, particularly emerging ones (an argument that remains to be tested once<lb/> China experiences a democratic transition).<lb/> Private capital movements have risen in recent decades, and bank flows have been part of<lb/> this story. Academics and policy makers have seen such movements as both panacea and<lb/> anathema. Some empirical studies have analysed their political drivers, but paradoxically very<lb/> few have looked at the political economy of banking. Hardly any research exists on the role of<lb/> politics in explaining cross-border banking movements. Bankers&apos; democratic preferences are<lb/> particularly under-researched. We need to know more about banks&apos; political preferences and<lb/> their potential impact on both economic and political development.<lb/> This paper focuses only on the specific set of private flows involved in cross-border<lb/> lending by international banks. The questions raised are narrow. Do banks react positively<lb/> (i.e. with increased lending) when an emerging democracy appears? Do they do so after<lb/> democratic transitions? Is there any relation between democratic consolidation and bank<lb/> lending? Separate studies (the work presented here is part of a larger project on the political<lb/> economy of private capital flows) examine political preferences in other types of capital<lb/> movements. Neut and Santiso (2006) look at foreign direct investors. Nieto and Santiso (2007)<lb/> study the political economy of portfolio investment. Together, these papers thus cover the three<lb/> major types of private capital flows: bank flows, FDI and portfolio flows.<lb/></p>

			<p>The issue is not whether private banks prefer democracies worldwide but whether they<lb/> contribute to political development by lending to emerging democracies. Their overall<lb/> democratic preferences emerge quickly from a look at cross-border banking claims. By the end of<lb/> 2005, the stock of cross-border claims of Bank for International Settlements (BIS) reporting banks<lb/> was $21 450 billion (<ref type="biblio">BIS, 2006</ref>), with most of the claims directed to developed OECD economies,<lb/> all democracies. Only $2 396 billion, less than 11 per cent of the total, went to emerging market<lb/> economies, with most of that to emerging democracies like South Korea, Brazil and Mexico.<lb/> China concentrates a stock of only $114.6 billion in cross-border bank claims, less than 0.53 per<lb/> cent of the world stock. Banks therefore clearly prefer lending (more than 99 per cent of their<lb/> claims) to democracies 8 . This is not surprising or new information. It is more interesting to look<lb/> at whether banks tend to prefer lending to new, emerging democracies. Do they react to<lb/> democratic transitions and are they sensitive, once transition is achieved, to democratic<lb/> consolidation? Much research has covered the contribution of banking to economic development<lb/> but none has focused on how bank lending affects political development.<lb/> This study uses newly compiled sets of indicators on democracy, political stability and<lb/> policy certainty, linking these datasets with international banking flow data developed by the<lb/> BIS. This allows empirical investigation of the political economy of cross-border bank flows in<lb/> emerging markets and thus a contribution to the rapidly growing literature on the determinants<lb/> of international private capital flows and the overall analysis of the political preferences of<lb/> bankers regarding democracy.<lb/> The paper proceeds as follows. It first reviews the literature on the issue and develops a<lb/> theoretical argument on why banks should prefer emerging democracies. It then focuses on the<lb/> political economy of bank flows to emerging markets in order to gauge whether bankers have a<lb/> political regime preference. It also specifically discusses banking activity in Latin America, a<lb/> region where democratic transitions have been very dense, and rival political hypotheses such as<lb/> the influence of policy instability. The theme &quot; banking on democracy &quot; underlines the importance<lb/> of banks in not only economic but also political development</p>

THE POLITICAL ECONOMY OF BANK FLOWS IN EMERGING<lb/> MARKETS: A REVIEW<lb/></table>

			<p>Private capital flows towards emerging economies have surged in recent decades, far<lb/> surpassing public official flows. The paradox is that until recently little empirical research has<lb/> analysed the drivers of this global private liquidity (<ref type="biblio">Stein and Daude, 2001 and 2004; Levy-Yeyati<lb/> et al., 2003; Mody et al., 2003; Santiso, 2003; Obstfeld, Shambaugh and Taylor, 2004</ref>). This is<lb/> particularly true for private international bank activity (<ref type="biblio">Sapienza, 2004</ref>). Although some surveys<lb/> examine the factors behind international banks&apos; decisions to establish operations overseas,<lb/> especially in developing countries (<ref type="biblio">Galindo et al., 2003; Buch, 2003; Wezel, 2004</ref>) and the<lb/> economic determinants of cross-border claims (<ref type="biblio">Buch and Lipponer, 2004</ref>), studies have not<lb/> focused on political variables and institutions that might explain cross-border bank movements.<lb/> Much more research has covered the economic impact of private bank flows. Recent<lb/> empirical studies, for example, have emphasised that banking liquidity has a positive effect on<lb/> economic growth (for a review see <ref type="biblio">Levine, 2004</ref>). Other studies have highlighted that capital<lb/> inflows are not risk-free assets and have shown a strong relation between the volume of capital<lb/> movements — bank flows included — and some recent financial crises characterised by sudden<lb/> crashes and highly dollarised economies (Van <ref type="biblio">Rijckeghem and Weder, 2003; Calvo et al., 2004;<lb/> Eichengreen and Hausmann, 2005</ref>).<lb/> The institutional and political environment nevertheless can strongly influence<lb/> international capital transactions. Scholars have growing interest in how strongly law and<lb/> politics are key drivers of international private capital flows (<ref type="biblio">Rajan and Zingales, 2003</ref>) and<lb/> financial crises (<ref type="biblio">Santiso, 2006; Martínez and Santiso, 2003; Stein and Streb, 2004; Whitehead,<lb/> 2004</ref>). Both portfolio and foreign direct investment in emerging countries are sensitive to political<lb/> variables (<ref type="biblio">Nieto and Santiso, 2007; Neut and Santiso, 2006</ref>). Empirical studies have highlighted<lb/> that corruption exerts a distortionary influence on growth and FDI (<ref type="biblio">Mauro, 1995; Wei, 2000a;<lb/> Wei, 2000b</ref>). The quality of legal systems has a strong impact on financial development (<ref type="biblio">Djankov<lb/> et al., 2003</ref>) and particularly on M&amp;A (<ref type="biblio">Rossi and Volpin, 2005</ref>) and project finance deals (<ref type="biblio">Esty and<lb/> Megginson, 2003</ref>).<lb/> The Lucas paradox — i.e. that in theory capital should flow from rich to poor countries,<lb/> but in practice it does not (<ref type="biblio">Lucas, 1990</ref>) — has been explained as resulting from institutional<lb/> quality (or lack of it). Empirical evidence for 1971-1998, based on cross-country regressions using<lb/> a sample of 50 countries, shows that the most important variables in explaining the paradox are<lb/> secure property rights and non-corrupt governments (<ref type="biblio">Alfaro et al., 2003</ref>). Another study (<ref type="biblio">Alfaro<lb/> et al., 2005</ref>) confirms these findings, showing that the historical determinants of institutional<lb/> quality had a direct effect on private capital flows during 1970-2000. Good institutions and/or<lb/> bad monetary policies are also important in explaining the high volatility of capital flows during<lb/> that period. A country that improves its institutional framework and increases its growth will<lb/> receive more private capital flows. Countries that have better institutional quality and lower<lb/> policy volatility will receive more stable capital flows. Countries with lower inflation volatility<lb/> tend to experience less uncertainty in terms of capital inflows. For FDI, empirical evidence<lb/> suggests that political variables are important and that multinational firms prefer to invest in<lb/> democracies 10 . In sharp contrast with official development assistance by Western governments,<lb/> which registered negative net flows to newly democratic regimes in the three years after<lb/> transition, private direct investors significantly increased FDI in the three years following shifts<lb/> to democratic rule in 23 countries since the mid-1970s (<ref type="biblio">Pei and Lyon, 2003</ref>) 11 .<lb/></p>

			<p>Politics also matter for the more direct impact on banking dynamics. Governments are<lb/> not disinterested parties in financial systems. They set the rules of the game and the security of<lb/> financial contracts, for example. World history is full of examples of the strong links between<lb/> political institutions and the development of financial systems, as highlighted by neo-<lb/>institutionalist economists and historians. The decision to privatise banks is highly political<lb/> (<ref type="biblio">Clarke et al., 2004</ref>), and in emerging economies, public or private bank ownership matters for<lb/> performance; politics interfere with banking performance (Micco, <ref type="biblio">Panizza and Yañez, 2005</ref>).<lb/> Another recent empirical analysis uses quarterly data on gross bilateral private banking<lb/> transactions between 19 source and 51 recipient countries from the mid-1980s until 2002 and<lb/> employs various panel methodologies. It highlights politics and institutions as key determinants<lb/> of international private banking activities (<ref type="biblio">Papaioannou, 2004</ref>). This research, including not only<lb/> inter-bank loans but also significant amounts of portfolio and FDI flows related to bank activity,<lb/> shows that a fall of 5 per cent in the political risk of the recipient country is accompanied by a<lb/> 2 per cent rise in the volume of bilateral bank lending. The results are quite impressive because<lb/> they show as significant all forms of risk identified in previous studies, namely economic,<lb/> financial and political risk (Erb, <ref type="biblio">Harvey and Viskanta, 1996</ref>). The most important of the three in<lb/> explaining foreign bank capital movements is political risk, which confirms the findings of<lb/> previous researchers (<ref type="biblio">Gelos and Wei, 2002</ref>). Other key results showed that well functioning<lb/> institutions are key drivers of international bank flows. Banks tend to invest more in countries<lb/> with non-corrupt bureaucracies, high-quality legal systems and non-government controlled<lb/> banking systems. Corporate governance practices and political reforms such as privatisation can<lb/> significantly increase the liquidity of domestic financial intermediaries and thus foster local<lb/> investment.<lb/></p>

			<p>Other studies have emphasised that legal systems can explain the specific formats of<lb/> international bank contracts. Government ownership of banks around the world is associated<lb/> with weak growth rates, weak protection of property rights, lower productivity, weak bank<lb/> performance and low levels of financial development (<ref type="biblio">Barth et al., 2001; La Porta et al., 2002</ref>).<lb/> State-controlled financial systems tend to promote political rather than profit-maximising<lb/> objectives. The Papaionannou (2004) estimates suggest that an increase of 1 per cent in a<lb/> government&apos;s holdings in the banking system decreases the level of cross-border bank lending<lb/> by 1.6 per cent. As suggested by García-Herrero and Martínez-Peria (2004), the claims of US,<lb/> Spanish and Italian banks in 90 countries tend to be sensitive to transaction costs (informational<lb/> costs) but also to government intervention in the financial sector as well as country risk, which<lb/> includes not only economic and financial variables but also political factors. These results fall in<lb/> line with other studies that have emphasised economic and political determinants of foreign<lb/> banking activity (<ref type="biblio">Martínez Peria et al., 2005</ref>).<lb/> These studies highlight that foreign banks seem particularly concerned with political risk<lb/> when considering investing and lending abroad. They tend to invest in countries with high-<lb/>quality institutions and to allocate credit to countries not characterised by corruption and with<lb/> efficient legal systems. The results imply that improving the efficiency of bureaucracies in<lb/> recipient countries, tackling the issues of corruption and enhancing legal systems, particularly<lb/> financial ones, are crucial in attracting foreign banks. The question of political regime preference<lb/> remains untouched by most of these studies, however. Do international private banks have a<lb/> democratic preference when considering their activity in emerging markets? More specifically do<lb/> they increase or decrease their bank lending after democratic transitions? And why?<lb/></p>

			<p>Banks are not homogenous and their activities worldwide are quite diverse 12 . This study<lb/> considers only private banks, not multilateral development banks. The BIS international banking<lb/> database tracks only private bank lending. Analyses of multilateral bank lending as well as<lb/> Official Development Assistance merit specific studies, although international development<lb/> finance has already caught the attention of many scholars. There is a particular abundance of<lb/> literature on the politics of development lending and of international debt (for an extensive<lb/> review see, for example, Carlos <ref type="biblio">Santiso, 2004</ref>). An interesting historical study could compare<lb/> bank lending behaviour before and after the debt crisis of the 1980s 13 , checking in particular<lb/> 12. The study leaves aside the political role of international bankers themselves, as individuals. Narratives<lb/> of their political involvements in both developed and developing countries are part of a very large<lb/></p>

			<table>literature ranging from historical biographies and sagas on international bankers like the Warburg,<lb/> Rothschild and JP Morgan founders and dynasties to broader academic studies. See, for example, the<lb/> great Morgan biography of Strouse (1999), Carosso (1987), Ferguson (1998) and Sampson (1982).<lb/> 13. Wellons (1987) analysed the huge growth of &quot;sovereign debt&quot; during the 1970s in conjunction with the<lb/> recycling of petro-dollars to developing countries and found that significant over-lending to sovereign<lb/> behaviour during the 1970s when democratic breakdowns multiplied. Due to the lack of BIS data<lb/> for the period this is not feasible.<lb/></table>

			<p>The study also focuses on a specific banking activity — lending flows — for which there<lb/> is a large and complete dataset available from the BIS. Banks are in fact very large entities and<lb/> their activities range from bank lending to portfolio investments, through their fund-<lb/>management subsidiaries, for example. Some are also involved in remittance business or<lb/> insurance activities. For these other types of bank activities, in particular portfolio and FDI flows,<lb/> other databases are used and other specific studies carried out (<ref type="biblio">Nieto and Santiso, 2007</ref>; Neut<lb/> and <ref type="biblio">Santiso, 2006</ref>) as parts of the larger project of which this study is an element. For some<lb/> banking activities abroad a lack of disaggregate data prevents the kind of analysis presented<lb/> here. For example, there are hardly any data disaggregated by country (including emerging<lb/> economies) on international derivative contracts comparable to the BIS data on bank lending and<lb/> borrowing.<lb/></p>

			<p>The BIS data include banking claims and liabilities, i.e. information on lenders and<lb/> borrowers. The focus here lies on lending rather than borrowing (liabilities being the counterpart<lb/> of claims and reflecting in the end the same kind of information). One question is set aside<lb/> because of a lack of data. The BIS data set does not include disaggregate data on borrowers.<lb/> Further research using other data sets (probably country case studies) could examine whether<lb/> bankers in non-democracies tend to differentiate between borrowers. Do they discriminate<lb/> between sovereign, authoritarian governments (and sub-national authorities), and private<lb/> borrowers? This would test whether banks differentiate between undemocratic governments and<lb/> their suffering subjects when making credit decisions.<lb/></p>

			<p>The BIS monitors the foreign claims held by mostly OECD-country banks on the rest of<lb/> the world. It provides the most comprehensive data on international banking activity. It defines<lb/> the claims as those extended by international banks to residents outside the countries in which<lb/> the banks are headquartered. Foreign claims may cover financial assets such as loans, debt<lb/> securities and equities, including equity participation in subsidiaries. The BIS data allow study of<lb/> stocks or flows of claims or liabilities, and they differentiate them by countries but not by public<lb/> and private borrowers in specific countries. The analysis here centres on flows, i.e. new claims,<lb/> rather than stocks in order to test whether international private banks react positively or<lb/> negatively to democratic transitions, and whether they increase or decrease their lending with<lb/> the later consolidation of democracy. This enables evaluation of the political development<lb/> contribution of banks. They are known to be key actors in economic development in emerging<lb/> countries (as well as developed countries) but do they also contribute to their political<lb/> development? Between 1980 and 2005, more than 80 countries took significant steps towards<lb/> democracy, particularly in Latin America and Eastern Europe. For that reason, Latin American<lb/> and Eastern European countries receive special attention.<lb/> developing-country borrowers was driven by large international OECD-based commercial banks&apos; well-<lb/>founded belief that their own home-country governments were unlikely to allow the &quot;sovereign&quot;<lb/> borrowing-country governments to default on payment.<lb/></p>

			<p>In Latin America, the number of countries functioning as democracies — defined as<lb/> regimes where governments come to and remain in power as the result of contested elections —<lb/> peaked at over 80 per cent in 1989 and has remained at that level ever since. Eastern European<lb/> countries also experienced a massive shift in political regimes, all of them becoming emerging<lb/> democracies over the past two decades. Meanwhile, private capital flows towards emerging<lb/> markets skyrocketed. Private international banks pour large amounts of money into emerging<lb/> markets through their lending operations, but FDI has pride of place. Privatisation opened<lb/> windows of opportunity and international banks invested heavily in emerging markets. In Latin<lb/> America foreigners, especially Spanish banks, invested large amounts. In Central Europe,<lb/> foreigners have also bought or built 80 per cent of the top local banks since the fall of<lb/> communism, Austrian and Belgian banks being particularly involved. Both in Latin America and<lb/> in Eastern Europe, private international bank lending has also been very active.<lb/></p>

			<head>III. BANKS&apos; PREFERENCE FOR EMERGING DEMOCRACIES:<lb/> HYPOTHESIS AND ARGUMENTS<lb/></head>

			<p>Why would banks prefer emerging democracies? Why would emerging democracies be<lb/> good business for them? In making decisions, bankers analyse key policies, especially fiscal,<lb/> monetary and trade policies. More generally, other variables such as privatisation and growth<lb/> have been identified as basic drivers of banking activity and entry into countries. In considering<lb/> all the variables, this paper centres attention on young democracies.<lb/> Look first at the key policies. Empirical research shows a complex relationship between<lb/> democracy and fiscal policy. Democratically elected politicians are supposed to be prone to seek<lb/> to minimise taxation and maximise spending, leading to an increase in budget deficits. Some<lb/> studies find no significant relationship between countries&apos; level of democracy and their average<lb/> spending on social security and education (<ref type="biblio">Mulligan et al., 2004</ref>). Many other, more recent ones<lb/> (<ref type="biblio">Tavares and Wacziarg, 2001; Block, 2002; Block et al., 2003; Keefer, 2005</ref>) indicate, as suggested<lb/> by Converse and Kaptsein (2006) that young democracies tend to exhibit initial increases in<lb/> public spending, with current expenditure picking up in election years and followed later by a<lb/> long-term decline. <ref type="biblio">Brender and Drazen (2004)</ref> find also that political budget cycles are strongly<lb/> present only in newly democratised countries. In a sample of 68 democracies from 1960 to 2001,<lb/> the traces of political budget cycles appear in the first four elections following democratisation.<lb/> Thus emerging democracies&apos; financial needs tend to increase in the very first years of their<lb/> existence, leading them to boost their borrowing activity and to become potentially good clients<lb/> of international banks.<lb/> Given monetary policy&apos;s importance to the economic well-being of banks, one must also<lb/> question how young democracies perform in this regard. Several studies reveal that democratic<lb/> institutions enhance the quality of monetary policy making. As Converse and Kapstein (2006)<lb/> underline, young democracies perform quite impressively on inflation; from an average of 125<lb/> per cent the year of the democratic transition, consumer price inflation drops to around 50 per<lb/> cent on average in four years. This pattern is not uniform among regions, however. In Latin<lb/> America, where hyperinflation has been very damaging, levels of inflation, while reduced, have<lb/> remained very high four years after democratic transition; on average they reach 390 per cent in<lb/> the year of transition and 123 per cent four years later, still high and damaging for banks. Yet the<lb/> more general trend characterises the major recipients of bank lending, also the major countries of<lb/> the region. In countries like Mexico, Brazil or Argentina, inflation has slowed dramatically in the<lb/> years following democratic transitions and above all after democratic consolidations.<lb/></p>

			<figure>Good trade policy also leads to more banking activity, particularly increased lending<lb/> through trade finance and export credits. Several studies corroborate that democracy increases<lb/> © OECD 2007<lb/> trade openness. Milner and Kubota (2005) show, for example, that higher levels of democracy are<lb/> associated with more liberal trade regimes, particularly in newer developing-world democracies.<lb/> These findings are consistent with other studies showing greater degrees of democracy<lb/> significantly associated with higher trade-to-GDP ratios. Converse and Kaptsein (2006) found in<lb/> their 114 cases of democratisation between 1960 and 2003 that such trade ratios increased by<lb/> nearly 10 percentage points in the three years following democratic transitions, jumping from an<lb/> average of 59 per cent of GDP in the year of transition to 69 per cent of GDP three years later<lb/> 14 .<lb/></figure>

			<p>Privatisation in young democracies also tends to favour more banking activity.<lb/> Privatisation operations are highly attractive for banks, implying high fees for those involved as<lb/> advisers and lucrative lending operations to finance takeovers by private operators. Several<lb/> empirical studies document that democracy is substantially and significantly associated with the<lb/> extent of privatisation (for a review and analysis see <ref type="biblio">Biglaiser and Danis, 2002</ref>). Democracies<lb/> privatise more than non-democracies and young democracies especially use heavy privatisation<lb/> programmes in order to finance increasing social demands. Privatisation has been particularly<lb/> intensive in Latin American and Eastern European emerging democracies. Latin America<lb/> accounted for 55 per cent of total privatisation revenues in the developing world in the 1990s, the<lb/> proceeds reaching nearly $180 billion (Chong and López <ref type="biblio">de Silanes, 2004</ref>).<lb/> All the key policies, but mainly fiscal and trade policies, tend to support greater bank<lb/> lending to emerging democracies. The results are more mixed for monetary policies.<lb/> Privatisation booms, particularly intense in emerging democracies, also provide good reasons for<lb/> banks to support increasing lending activity. Young democracies also grow faster in the first<lb/> years following transition, as Rodrik and <ref type="biblio">Wacziarg (2005)</ref> show. They found in an extensive<lb/> sample of 154 countries that the first five years following democratic transition saw significantly<lb/> higher economic growth and lower variance in growth rates.<lb/></p>

			<p>These conclusions on growth might not be as clear as at first sight, however. The link<lb/> between democracy and economic performance remains tenuous. Both the theoretical and the<lb/> empirical literature are split over the effects of democracy on growth. Some scholars have<lb/> questioned &quot; development &quot; theories, arguing that democracy has a questionable and statistically<lb/> insignificant effect on economic growth (<ref type="biblio">Przeworski et al., 2000</ref>) 15 . On the effects of democratic<lb/> transition on economic development, some argue that the causality runs from economic<lb/> development to a higher probability of transition to democracy (<ref type="biblio">Boix and Stokes, 2003; Boix,<lb/> 2003</ref>). Others conclude that transitions to democracy do not necessarily become more likely<lb/> when a country is more developed as measured by per capita income (<ref type="biblio">Przeworski, 2004c</ref>).</p>

			<figure>Feng<lb/> 14 . Other studies by López-Córdoba and Meissner find a positive relation between trade openness and<lb/> democracy from 1895 onwards. The impact of openness by region shows some variation, and the<lb/> authors note that commodity and petroleum exporters do not seem to become more democratic by<lb/> exporting more commodities and oil (López-Córdoda and Meissner, 2005). While the impact of<lb/> democracy on trade openness seems strong, there is much more discussion on the impact of trade on<lb/> democracy: Rigobón and Rodrik (2004) find results totally different from those of López-Córdoba and<lb/> Meissner, while Papaioannou and Siourounis (2005), find a much weaker impact of trade openness on<lb/> democracy.<lb/> 15. For a critical analysis of the new institutionalism literature, see Przeworski, (2004a).<lb/></figure>

			<p>(2003) reaches the same conclusion, using large samples of countries over long periods to show<lb/> that the effect of democracy on growth is statistically insignificant. He also finds, however, that<lb/> political democracy has a significant impact on private investment. Reductions in political<lb/> instability and policy uncertainty have a positive impact on the economy.<lb/> Still others have established strong links between democracy and growth and between<lb/> the quality of institutions and long-term growth (<ref type="biblio">Acemoglu et al., 2004; Persson and<lb/> Tabellini, 2003; Persson, 2004</ref>), or found positive effects of democracy and the rule of law on<lb/> economic performance, with the latter having a much stronger impact (<ref type="biblio">Rigobón and Rodrik,<lb/> 2004</ref>). The relation between democracy and the rule of law is not systematic, however, as<lb/> highlighted by examples in Latin America where transitions to democracy have proceeded<lb/> without consolidation of the rule of law. In the absence of meaningful judicial systems,<lb/> democratisation often has not culminated in the consolidation of the rule of law (<ref type="biblio">Malone, 2003</ref>), a<lb/> key driver of private capital flows to emerging markets.<lb/></p>

			<p>Growth performance improves after the transition to democracy. Moreover, growth<lb/> under democracy appears more stable than under authoritarian regimes. Based on a sample of<lb/> 40 countries and comparing their economic performances before and after they became<lb/> democratic over the past 40 years, Jian-Guang <ref type="biblio">Shen (2002)</ref> shows that the ten-year average<lb/> growth rate is a half percentage point higher after transition to democracy. The five-year average<lb/> growth rate after the adoption of democracy is even higher; a full percentage point.</p>

			<figure>More than<lb/> 60 per cent of the sample countries experienced growth acceleration after democratic transition.<lb/> Rodrik and Wacziarg (2005) also reveal that major democratic transitions had positive effects on<lb/> economic growth in the short run and tended to associate with a decline in growth volatility.<lb/> Their findings are based on a large sample of countries, cover a long period (1950-2000) and<lb/> confirm that particularly low-income countries experienced a short-term boost in growth after<lb/> democratic transition.<lb/> <ref type="biblio">Papaioannou and Siourounis (2004)</ref> arrive at a similar conclusion by analysing the<lb/> evolution of GDP growth before and after permanent democratisations in 1960-2000. According<lb/> to their estimates, democratisation leads on average to an approximate increase of 0.7 per cent to<lb/> 1.0 per cent in real per capita growth. It is associated not only with higher growth but also less<lb/> volatile growth rates, confirming previous findings (<ref type="biblio">Rodrik, 1997, 1999</ref>). Democratisation has the<lb/> strongest impact on growth volatility in highly unstable countries such as those in Latin<lb/> America.<lb/></p>

			<p>Persson and Tabellini (2005a) conducted decisive research underlining that<lb/> democratisations induce growth acceleration and therefore are good for banking business.<lb/> Drawing on previous and complementary research (<ref type="biblio">Persson, 2004; Persson and Tabellini, 2004;<lb/> Persson and Tabellin, 2005b</ref>) and considering different forms of democracy, they show that<lb/> becoming a democracy accelerates growth by 0.75 percentage points. With an estimated<lb/> convergence rate of 6 per cent per year, they also show that the long-run effect on income per<lb/> capita is 12.5 percentage points. The findings are based on a very large sample of about 150<lb/> countries, include 120 regime changes over 1960-2000 and are consistent with previous studies<lb/> (<ref type="biblio">Papaioannou and Siouroumis, 2004</ref>). Another result reveals that new presidential democracies<lb/> grow on average 1.5 percentage point more than new parliamentary democracies. This is<lb/> particularly interesting for Latin American countries, where presidential regimes dominate.<lb/> Other factors, more related to institutional quality and public goods outputs, may also<lb/> have relevance for explaining increased bank lending in newly democratised countries.<lb/> Democracies have more incentives to provide benefits for the public than do autocracies. They<lb/> tend to be much more transparent than non-democracies, releasing more information on tax<lb/> revenue collection (<ref type="biblio">Bueno de Mesquita et al., 2003</ref>). Based on a large empirical study tracking the<lb/> missing data in the World Bank&apos;s World Development Indicators, Rosendorff and Vreeland<lb/> (2004) found that the missing data are in fact correlated with regime type, thus showing that<lb/> democracies are much more transparent than non-democracies. This is key; the institutions that<lb/> matter for economic development are in the end those that induce governments to limit taxes on<lb/> income, make rulers accountable and provide information on government policies, thereby<lb/> allowing informed citizens to sanction misbehaviour (<ref type="biblio">Przeworski, 2004b; Benhabib and<lb/> Przeworski, 2004</ref>). Not surprisingly, foreign direct investors (international banks included) tend<lb/> to prefer more transparent countries (<ref type="biblio">Mody et al., 2003</ref>), where transaction costs related to<lb/> corruption are lower, for example.<lb/> Strong economic arguments, already tested empirically, thus help to explain a potential<lb/> political preference for emerging democracies by banks. The empirical test of this preference<lb/> remains an open question, however.<lb/></p>

			<head>IV. BANK FLOWS TO EMERGING MARKETS: STYLISED FACTS<lb/></head>

			<p>Before testing the hypothesis that bankers prefer emerging democracies, the importance<lb/> of private bank flows needs emphasis. Private foreign lending can constitute a substantial<lb/> fraction of claims in recipient countries. Over the past decade, foreign bank claims took off with<lb/> greater financial integration and the opening of emerging countries to private capital flows. In<lb/> consequence, private international loans equalled 48.3 per cent of global GDP in 2005 16 , more<lb/> than the total of international trade flows combined with all foreign direct investment and global<lb/> tourist receipts (<ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<p>The test of the hypothesis depends for data on the BIS &quot;Consolidated Foreign Claims of<lb/> Reporting Banks on Individual Countries&quot; statistical series from the fourth quarter of 1983 to the<lb/> first quarter of 2006 17 . Because this study tries to show the relationships between private banking<lb/> flows and levels of democratisation as well as between bank flows and changes in these levels,<lb/> the focus lies on countries that have gone farther down the road towards democracy, i.e. mainly<lb/> emerging countries. Private bank flows towards emerging countries are very low in nominal<lb/> 16. The BIS defines the foreign claims held by banks mostly from OECD countries vis-à-vis the rest of the<lb/> world as those authorised by international banks on residents outside the country in which they are<lb/> headquartered. Foreign claims may range from assets such as loans and debt securities to equities,<lb/> including equity stakes in local subsidiaries.<lb/> 17. For more information, see www.bis.org<lb/></p>

			<p>By region, Latin America and the Caribbean were the main recipients of bank flows in the<lb/> mid-1980s, although they subsequently eased off (<ref type="figure">Figures</ref> 2 and 3). At the end of 1984, this region<lb/> received 47 per cent of the flows to emerging countries, whereas Africa received about 21 per<lb/> cent, Asia 20 per cent and Europe 12 per cent (See also Table 1 of Appendix 1).

			<p>Mexico and Brazil account mainly for Latin America&apos;s predominance over the past 20<lb/> years (<ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>). In fact, these two countries received the largest country shares of total loans to<lb/> emerging markets over the past two decades, with flows exceeding those directed at Asian<lb/> emerging economies, although Asia and Emerging Europe obtained more financing than Latin<lb/> America as a whole. This arises from the greater concentration of banking flows to Latin America<lb/> in a few countries, compared with the wider distribution among countries in Asia. <ref type="biblio">Mexico</ref> and<lb/> Brazil received similar amounts of financing until the second half of the 1990s, when Brazil grew<lb/> in importance as Mexico decreased. From 2000 onwards, however, Mexico regained the top spot,<lb/> reaching 10.5 per cent of the total in 2005 (similar to the shares of Africa and the Middle East in<lb/> the same year). Brazil&apos;s importance as a fiscal paradise for banking investment fell considerably<lb/> from the beginning of 2002, with its share of total emerging-country bank flows falling from 10.5<lb/> per cent at the end of 2001 to a mere 6.9 per cent in 2006. Other Latin American countries such as<lb/> Argentina and Venezuela have experienced a considerable drop in foreign bank financing. The<lb/> main winners from Latin America&apos;s loss of share since 2001 (including Mexico) have been<lb/> emerging Asian economies and the Eastern European countries.

			<head>V. BANKS AND EMERGING DEMOCRACIES<lb/></head>

			<p>Proximity and cultural factors seem to be variables behind these trends in bank flows.<lb/> GDP, population, surface area in square kilometres, interest rates and even levels of corruption<lb/> represent other key drivers of such flows (<ref type="biblio">Papaioannou, 2004</ref>). This paper focuses not on these<lb/> variables but on determining if political factors make some difference in the granting of<lb/> international bank financing. To do so it uses variables such as the democratic transition year, the<lb/> level of democratisation, the stability of economic policy, the political stability of ministries and<lb/> the differences between presidencies in different emerging countries.<lb/></p>

			<p>As many researchers highlight, the analysis of democratisation and private bank flows<lb/> raises a number of methodological issues. Data availability is one, along with the measures used<lb/> to gather the data. Most of the datasets present availability weaknesses, but more importantly the<lb/> hypotheses, concepts and definitions behind them are open to question. One important issue<lb/> regards causality. Private bank money may flow towards emerging democracies just because<lb/> windows of opportunity like privatisations have suddenly opened. Banks may rush towards<lb/> emerging democracies not because they are democracies but because they privatise their banks.<lb/> Democracies — at least in Latin America — had a strong propensity to privatise during<lb/> the last decades of the 20th century. They tended to prefer fully to privatise assets while<lb/> autocracies tried to maintain control over their economies. In the end, as highlighted by <ref type="biblio">Giavazzi<lb/> and Tabellini (2004)</ref>, political and economic liberalisation have been closely connected. They feed<lb/> on each other, so that it is difficult to discren the direction of causality. Analysis of the timing of<lb/> different events does indicate, however, that the causality is more likely to run from political to<lb/> economic reforms. Democratisation appears to lead to economic liberalisation, with the extent of<lb/> liberalisation gradually increasing in the years following the transition to democracy. This would<lb/> suggest that the political shifts induce economic liberalisation to a far greater extent than the<lb/> other way around, particularly in Latin America, where in most cases political liberalisation took<lb/> place before bank privatisation</p>

			<table>18 .<lb/> 18. In the classification of Giavazzi and Tabellini, all Latin American countries except Chile, Mexico and<lb/> Peru liberalised their economies first and afterwards experienced political liberalisation. One can<lb/> nevertheless discuss the assigned timing of both political and economic liberalisation. In Mexico, for<lb/> example, permanent democratisation dated from 1994, whereas many scholars considered that 1988 or<lb/> 2000 were the years when full democratisation took place.<lb/> © OECD 2007<lb/> The first approach to the question &quot; Do bankers prefer democracy in emerging markets? &quot; ,<lb/> analyses the correlation between the BIS data series and political databases, using the standard<lb/> classification of democracy of Przeworski et al. (2000) 19 . Two series indicate the level of<lb/> democratisation. The first, called &quot; Consolidation of Democracy &quot; , was formulated by Schmitter<lb/> and Schneider (2004). It measures</table>

			<p>the extent to which democracy consolidates itself. It provides<lb/> yearly figures for a series of countries. The greater the value, the stronger democracy is rooted.<lb/> The second indicator, more commonly used in economic literature, is the &quot;Democracy Score&quot;<lb/> formulated by &quot;Polity IV&quot;. It measures countries&apos; existing levels of democracy. It also has an<lb/> annual series. Its value ranges from zero to ten, where proximity to ten means a higher level of<lb/> democratisation and vice versa.<lb/></p>

			<figure>The years in which democratic transition took place in different countries also are useful<lb/> to gauge whether banking flows increased after transition. These figures come from research<lb/> developed by Giavazzi and Tabellini (2004), Carrillo et al., (2004) and Przeworski et al. (2000). In<lb/> line with Persson and Tabellini (2003), Persson (2004) and a large body of literature on the topic,<lb/> a country is defined as a democracy if it has strictly positive values for the indicator POLITY2 in<lb/> the POLITY IV database. In line with Giavazzi and Tabellini (2004), democratisation is an event<lb/> in which a country becomes a democracy when this was not the case the previous year. The<lb/> Giavazzi and Tabellini timing is verified and cross-checked with Carillo et al. (2004) for Latin<lb/> America and with Przeworski et al. (2000).<lb/></figure>

			<p>A graphical analysis of foreign claims by country in combination with the democracy<lb/> indicators, shows a common pattern for countries and indicators (<ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref> and Appendix 2). An<lb/> increase in the democracy indicators has a positive impact on the entry of private foreign claims,<lb/> although in some countries there is a lag of two or three years. This pattern is particularly<lb/> important in Latin America, a region that experienced the most impressive democratic<lb/> transitions over the past decade along with Eastern Europe (where the relation also looks strong<lb/> as shown in the country cases in Appendix 2). In some of the graphs a vertical line shows the<lb/> year in which transition took place.<lb/> 19. Regimes are classified as democracies if in a given year they satisfy simultaneously four criteria: i) the<lb/> chief executive is elected; ii) the legislature is elected; iii) more than one party competes in the elections;<lb/> iv) incumbent parties have in the past lost an election and yielded office or will do so in the future. All<lb/> regimes that fail to satisfy at least one of these criteria are classified as non-democratic (<ref type="biblio">Przeworski et<lb/> al., 2000, pp. 18-29</ref>). Hence the political regime classification is simplified and becomes a dichotomous<lb/> variable that takes a value of O if a country is a democracy and 1 if it is not according to the four<lb/> cumulative criteria.<lb/></p>

			<p>Next, consider countries for which data are available and which have undergone<lb/> democratic transition (mostly in Latin America and Eastern Europe). How did democratic<lb/> transition affect private bank inflows? Taking the year of transition as t=0 for all countries, one<lb/> can observe the growth rates of banking flows before and after transition. The results are<lb/> striking. Before democratic transition, the annual growth of flows in the three previous years has<lb/> a mean equal to 1.04 per cent. After transition, banking flows in the following three years<lb/> accelerate, growing at an average of 4.37 per cent. For Latin American countries alone in the<lb/> three years prior to transition, annual average growth was negative at -1.53 per cent, then<lb/> jumped to 4.28 per cent for the three years after transition. Clearly, at least in Latin America,<lb/> bankers tend to love new emerging democracies and increase their lending to them. A transition<lb/> towards democracy tends to favour foreign bank inflows. The other side of this coin is that<lb/> emerging borrowers have had easier access to foreign private bank lending, once they became<lb/> democracies.<lb/></p>

			<p>Another way to look at the democratic preferences of bankers is to consider the quality of<lb/> the political regimes that emerged from democratic transition. Once democracy is in place, do<lb/> foreign bankers take quality into account, i.e. do they react to democratic breakdowns at the<lb/> micro level? Democratic breakdown is usually associated with the collapse of democracy (<ref type="biblio">Linz,<lb/> 1978</ref>). Since the 1980s, in fact, no Latin American country has experienced such a collapse, but<lb/> there has been abundant discussion regarding the quality of these democracies. &quot; Delegative<lb/> democracies &quot; have been criticised, for example, for being inadequately constrained by a weak<lb/> network of state institutions whose role is to check executive abuses of power. In line with<lb/> <ref type="biblio">Barndt (2003)</ref>, however, one can argue that democratic breakdowns can occur not only at the<lb/> macro level but also at the micro level. Across the continent, &quot; executive assaults &quot; abound. These<lb/> are events in which an elected president tries to restrict the access of certain individuals to state<lb/> power by temporarily suspending their ability to avail themselves of the constitutive attributes of<lb/> democracy meant to be enshrined in the regime. Executive assaults are in the end attempts by<lb/> presidents to dismantle democracy at the micro-level, such as the attempt (an example from<lb/> Barndt) by Banzer in Bolivia in 1999 to quash peasant protests by detaining the leaders and<lb/> restricting the right to gather in public.<lb/></p>

			<p>Based on a collection of executive-assault data since the onset of the third wave of<lb/> democratisation in the region from the beginning of the 1980s for ten country-periods, Barndt<lb/> reported 204 observations and more than 120 cases of assault. All countries except Chile<lb/> experienced at least one case of assault and several experienced more than ten. <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> quickly<lb/> confirms that foreign banks seem indifferent to the proliferation of executive assaults: they tend<lb/> to increase their lending presence regardless of increases in micro-democratic breakdowns.<lb/></p>

			<head>VI. BANKS AND POLICY INSTABILITY IN EMERGING DEMOCRACIES<lb/></head>

			<p>Given that bankers prefer emerging democracies, this section shifts the focus away from<lb/> political regimes to policy stability in order to gauge whether bankers prefer it too. The common<lb/> and generalised perception is that they tend to be risk-averse and avoid politically unstable<lb/> countries for generally good reasons, because instability has a negative economic impact,<lb/> particularly on growth, debt levels, fiscal deficits and inflation rates. In their core decision<lb/> making on political risk, banks are put off by political instability in general because it increases<lb/> policy instability, which in turn impacts negatively on growth and discourages private<lb/> investment. Yet they do not seem sensitive to all kinds of instability. They show some neutrality<lb/> toward democratic political instability, in spite of which they have continued to invest in Latin<lb/> American emerging democracies in recent decades.<lb/></p>

			<figure>Latin America is known as one of the world&apos;s most politically unstable areas. Between<lb/> 1945 and 2000, it saw around 160 occurrences of regime transition — shifts from non-<lb/>democracies towards democracies and vice-versa 20 . The region contains fewer than 10 per cent of<lb/> the countries in the world, but it had more than 35 per cent of the regime transitions in the<lb/> period. It averaged three regime transitions per country. South Asian countries in comparison<lb/> had 1.4 transitions per country during the same years (<ref type="biblio">Cheibub, 2003</ref>). Peru, for example (not the<lb/> most unstable in the region by any means) had frequent political changes not only among the<lb/> players in the game, but also in the playing field and the game itself. Since its independence in<lb/> 1821, the country has had 13 constitutions and 108 governments, only 19 of which were elected<lb/> and only nine of which completed their terms. Over the past two decades, democracy<lb/> reappeared with three constitutional presidents installed between 1980 and 1992; a regime<lb/> classified as semi-authoritarian between 1992 and 2001; and a fully democratic regime with two<lb/> constitutional presidents since 2001 (<ref type="biblio">Moron and Sanborn, 2006</ref>).<lb/> 20. As highlighted by <ref type="biblio">Epstein et al. (2005)</ref>, the classification of political regimes is one of the most hotly<lb/> debated issues in the study of democratisation. The problem arises because the predominant situation<lb/> over the past few decades has in fact involved movements into and out of an intermediate category that<lb/> clearly dominates the dynamics of</p>

			<table>regime transition. In their data covering all countries from 1955 to<lb/> 2000, only 16 transitions from full democracy to autocracy and 22 reverse transitions from autocracy to<lb/> full democracy occurred, while 149 transitions into or out of partial democracy took place. From 1955 to<lb/> 2005, partial democracy always represented less than 30 per cent of all regimes. Neither are<lb/> dictatorships all the same, and many, as Przeworski et al. (2000) argue, exhibit the full gamut of<lb/> seemingly democratic institutions (Przeworski and Gandhi, 2004). For conceptual discussions regarding<lb/> the problems of defining and measuring democracy, see also Cheibub and Gandhi (2004) and Bollen<lb/> and Paxton (1998; 2000).<lb/></table>

			<p>Latin American democracies have tended to stabilise over the decades, as <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref> shows.<lb/> Policy instability is captured by an Economic Policy Stability Index. The index draws on the<lb/> Fraser Institute&apos;s Economic Freedom of the World Index (EFW Index, Source: Freedom House Index),<lb/> used among others by Mariano Tommasi (2005) (see also <ref type="biblio">Tommasi and Spiller, 2007</ref>; Tommasi<lb/> and Stein, forthcoming). A graphical analysis (<ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref>) of foreign claims by country against the<lb/> Economic Policy Stability Index shows a strong relationship between both series. The greater an<lb/> economy&apos;s stability, the higher the inflows of foreign claims (see Appendix 3 for comparable<lb/> graphs for non-Latin American countries).<lb/></p>

			<p>In the analysis of democratic changes and banking flows, the possible effect on foreign<lb/> claims was observed mainly after abrupt changes in the indicator (as in the case of transition).<lb/> Bank flows are more sensitive to political stability; less abrupt changes in the index also have<lb/> effects on flows. <ref type="table">Table 2</ref> shows correlations of the indicators of democracy and the economic<lb/> policy stability index with foreign claims.

			<head>VII. BANK FLOWS AND POLITICAL STABILITY<lb/> IN EMERGING DEMOCRACIES<lb/></head>

			<p>This section analyses the entry of banking flows into Latin American countries and their<lb/> possible relationship with the stability of ministerial and gubernatorial offices. As already<lb/> demonstrated, banks have tended to boost their activity in the region, increasing their lending<lb/> after the return of democracy despite the long track record of political instability in Latin<lb/> America. Political regime instability has almost disappeared since the third wave of<lb/> democratisation in the sense of no major democratic breakdowns in the region. This contrasts<lb/> with the previously large number of coups d&apos;état and other successful efforts to remove sitting<lb/> governments through illegal and sometimes violent action — more than 70 in Latin America over<lb/> the last half century alone and nearly one per year from the 1800s to the 1970s. Yet this does not<lb/> mean that political instability has disappeared. Regular events such as elections, cabinet<lb/> reshuffles or political crises still remain. What impact does such democratic instability, political<lb/> change within a democratic regime, have on bank flows?<lb/> Democratic political instability can be measured in terms of cabinet turnover; i.e. changes<lb/> in the composition of a cabinet within a government&apos;s lifetime (<ref type="biblio">Huber and Martínez-Gallardo,<lb/> 2003</ref>). A dataset developed by <ref type="biblio">Martínez-Gallardo (2004)</ref> records within the limits of source<lb/> availability all the changes in the composition of cabinets in seven Latin American countries<lb/> between 1988 and 2000. Cabinet changes include both terminations (ministers who resign from<lb/> their posts and take up work elsewhere) and reshuffles, where ministers move from one portfolio<lb/> to another. All such changes take place, therefore, within the rules of the democratic game.<lb/> Democratic instability thus defined has been quite intensive in Latin America with<lb/> notable differences between countries and presidential mandates within them. By the end of<lb/> President Figueres&apos; four-year mandate (<ref type="biblio">1994-1998</ref>) in Costa Rica, 15 of his 25 original ministers<lb/> still held the same positions, while just two of the ministers originally appointed by Colombian<lb/> President Ernesto Samper remained in the government (and both moved to different portfolios).<lb/> The average time spent in office by ministers in Figueres&apos; cabinet was 35 months; the average for<lb/> their Colombian counterparts over the same period was less than half that (15 months).<lb/> Cabinet stability for the countries included in the dataset (<ref type="biblio">Argentina, Brazil, Chile,<lb/> Colombia, Costa Rica, Mexico, Venezuela, Ecuador, Bolivia, Peru, Paraguay, and</ref> Uruguay) also<lb/> varies with respect to reshuffles and terminations. Reshuffles have been substantially less<lb/> common than terminations, less than 10 per cent of all the movements recorded. Abrupt changes<lb/> (terminations) have been more common. The relative frequency of reshuffles also varies across<lb/> countries, ranging from only 4 per cent of movements in Colombia and Ecuador to 8-11 per cent<lb/> in most countries (Chile, Bolivia, Venezuela, Brazil, Peru, Paraguay and Costa Rica), 12 per cent<lb/> in Mexico, 14 per cent in Uruguay and even 21 per cent in Argentina<lb/> 21 .<lb/></figure>

			<p>Changes in ministerial tenures should have some impact on bank flows to the extent that<lb/> they could affect the quality of democratic policy making and the performance of governments.<lb/> Ministerial cabinets are consistently more stable under situations of higher growth rates and in<lb/> more constant environments for law and order. Cabinet changes are, in one way or another,<lb/> political responses to shocks. Ministers may be changed due to shifts in presidential strategy,<lb/> opposition pressure, or exogenous shocks like financial crises. Obvious examples are the<lb/> departure of finance ministers in the wake of financial disruption or economic crisis. A political<lb/> shock might cause a party to pull out of a ruling coalition, forcing ministers who are members of<lb/> that party to abandon the executive. Vacancies produced by such events can be filled with<lb/> politicians or technocrats from within the cabinet in order to smooth the change. After the 1994<lb/> devaluation in Mexico, for example, President Zedillo replaced his minister of finance with<lb/> another cabinet member in an effort (unsuccessful) to overcome the crisis (<ref type="biblio">Santiso, 1999</ref>).<lb/> Bankers seem indifferent as to whether centre, left or right-wing governments are in<lb/> power and whether they have an absolute majority or operate in coalition with other parties.<lb/> They show the same indifference to political instability as measured by cabinet turnover<lb/> (<ref type="table">Table 3</ref>). The correlations of foreign claims with ministerial stability and the average duration of<lb/> ministers in office are insignificant at 0.10 and 0.06 respectively. Bank flows just do not appear as<lb/> sensitive to ministerial turnover measured by time in office.<lb/></p>

			<p>An econometric exercise checks and confirms the results (<ref type="table">Table 4</ref>). Several empirical<lb/> studies analyse the determinants of bank flows (<ref type="biblio">Papaioannou, 2004</ref>). The purpose here is<lb/> simpler: to verify the previous findings for political variables using another tool. The analysis<lb/> uses panel data on 29 countries for 1984-2004 (annual frequency). The explanatory variables for<lb/> bank flows are economic (GDP, population, human capital proxies and interest rates) and<lb/> political (the &quot; consolidation of democracy &quot; , &quot; democracy score &quot; and &quot; economic policy stability &quot;<lb/> indicators, plus ministerial stability and the composition of governments).<lb/> Foreign claims, apart from depending on GDP and population, also correlate positively<lb/> with levels of democratisation in recipient countries. The results are confirmed with both the<lb/> &quot; consolidation of democracy &quot; indicator (CoD in <ref type="table">Table 4</ref>) and the &quot; democracy score &quot; indicator<lb/> (DS). The economic policy stability indicator (EFW) also influences financial inflows, but the<lb/> results are less trustworthy because the EFW data are available only every five years for 1985-<lb/>2000, which means a smaller pool of information. A country receives more financing when its<lb/> gross domestic product increases, its population is higher, more financing came the previous<lb/> year and the country enjoys both greater democratisation and more economic policy stability.<lb/> Ministerial stability and the composition of governments or banks do not appear as determinant<lb/> factors, nor do interest rates or human capital.<lb/></p>

			<figure>21. The number of reshuffles vs. terminations also varies across portfolios. Finance, for example, accounts<lb/> for only 4 per cent of reshuffles (i.e. 96 per cent terminations) while Interior has 14 per cent (86 per cent<lb/> terminations). One might expect that a large number of Finance terminations would have a bigger<lb/> impact on the banking sector.<lb/></figure>

			<head>VIII. CONCLUSIONS:<lb/></head>

			<p>Banks are willing to increase their lending to newly emerging democracies. They also<lb/> prefer emerging democracies where policies are stable, but they seem indifferent to democratic<lb/> political instability. The preference for emerging democracies is particularly striking in regions<lb/> like Latin America and Eastern Europe, where democratic transitions multiplied in the past two<lb/> decades; cross-border bank lending tends to rise in the years following authoritarian<lb/> breakdowns.<lb/></p>

			<p>Solid economic reasons explain why international banks prefer emerging democracies.<lb/> Good fiscal and monetary policies and institutional quality in emerging democracies favour<lb/> banking business. This preference needs testing for other flows such as FDI, portfolio investment<lb/> and the lending behaviour of public institutions like the multilateral development banks.<lb/> According to some studies, financial markets do not particularly reward democracies, with no<lb/> apparent, significant difference in the interest rates paid by democracies and non-democracies in<lb/> emerging markets 22 .<lb/></p>

			<p>Bankers&apos; preferences may lie in ethical as well as economic considerations, as the<lb/> introduction to this paper suggests. Banks might prefer lending to emerging democracies not<lb/> only because it is good business in economic terms, but also because it is good business ethically,<lb/> a pledge of support for democracy, freedom and responsible public order, &quot; all things living &quot;<lb/> along their journey In Search of a Better World as envisaged by the Anglo-Austrian philosopher<lb/> Karl Popper in his collection of essays and lectures on the need for a new professional ethic.<lb/> 22. Sebastian Saiegh (2004a,b) provides very stimulating research on this issue, examining the effect of<lb/> political institutions on country risk and interest rates. He shows that emerging democracies are more<lb/> likely to reschedule their debts than are authoritarian regimes and appear to pay higher interest rates.<lb/> These findings are based on data for developing countries covering 1971-1998.<lb/></p>
