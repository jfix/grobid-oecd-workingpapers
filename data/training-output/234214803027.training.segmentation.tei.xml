			<body>1. <lb/>Introduction and main findings <lb/>1. <lb/>Opposition to structural reforms usually arise because of the limited knowledge on these reforms&apos; <lb/>distributional effects, especially in the short term. Indeed, reforms can generate (transitory) losses for <lb/>specific population groups, even if long-term welfare gains are found to be positive (e.g. Alesina and <lb/>Drazen, 1991; Drazen, 2000). However, very little information is currently available on the short-term <lb/>costs of reforms and to what extent different groups of the population are affected. <lb/>2. <lb/>Against this background, this paper examines the short-term distributional effects of a number of <lb/>tax and labour market reforms, using a micro-founded dynamic general equilibrium (DGE) model <lb/>calibrated for the euro area. DGE models are explicitly derived from the optimisation of agent behaviour <lb/>under constraints. Their use presents a number of advantages. First, they allow a wide range of structural <lb/>reforms to be examined and possible spillovers between the variables to be taken into account. 2 Second, <lb/>these models are less subject to the Lucas critique as they are based on structural equations with sound <lb/>microeconomic foundations. Third, it is possible to assess policies through their effects on consumer <lb/>welfare. Finally, DGE models encompass dynamic effects and are well suited to examine the adjustment to <lb/>changes in economic structure and policy. However, the lag structure reflects the optimisation-based <lb/>micro-foundations and is generally limited and similar across regions or countries. Consequently, DGE <lb/>results may tend to overemphasise similarities and to attribute differences to shocks rather than to <lb/>economic structure. The empirical validation of DGE models is an important concern, but also an active <lb/>field of economic research. Both the model dynamics and steady-state values can be quite sensitive to <lb/>particular functional forms and parameter choices. <lb/>3. <lb/>In order to focus on the distributional effects of reforms, a heterogeneous household sector with <lb/>two groups of consumers is considered. The first group maximises intertemporal utility over an infinite <lb/>planning horizon in the presence of habit persistence (e.g. Fuhrer, 2000; Smets and Wouters, 2003). 2 The <lb/>second group is liquidity-constrained (the so-called rule-of-thumb consumers), has no access to financial <lb/>markets for intertemporal income transfers and consequently spends its disposable period income entirely <lb/>on current consumption (e.g. Galí et al., 2004, 2007). <lb/>4. <lb/>The main conclusions are the following: <lb/></body>

			<body>− Although the examined labour market reforms are estimated to boost aggregate consumption <lb/>and output immediately after implementation, they have sizeable distributional effects. <lb/>Liquidity-constrained households may incur transitional losses after a cut in the benefit <lb/>replacement ratio. <lb/>− A reduction in the average income tax rate or in employer social security contributions would <lb/>not involve transitory losses for liquidity-constrained households, although gains from the <lb/>reform will be unequally distributed between the two types of households. <lb/>− Lowering employment and/or price adjustment costs could markedly reduce the short-term <lb/>costs for liquidity-constrained households from a cut in the benefit replacement ratio, without <lb/>changing the long-term impact of the reform. The absence of long-term effects reflects the <lb/>introduction of specific types of adjustment costs in the model, notably the fact that no <lb/>distinction is made between gross and net fluctuations in employment. <lb/>− A suitable compensation scheme could also reduce the potential short-term losses from a cut <lb/>in the benefit replacement rate, but at the expense of lower aggregate gains in the long run. <lb/>More generally, there appears to be a trade-off between long-run aggregate effects of reforms <lb/>and more equal distribution of these gains through a redistribution scheme at least when the <lb/>latter is not phased out once the pay-off from reforms for liquidity-constrained consumers <lb/>moves to positive territory. Decisions on the design of reforms and compensation of losers <lb/>will thus depend on the country&apos;s preferences in terms of efficiency gains and equity. <lb/>5. <lb/>The paper first describes the DGE model that will subsequently used to simulate the impact of <lb/>selected tax and labour market reforms. Both the theoretical framework and the calibration of the model <lb/>are detailed. The short-term distributional effects of a number of simulations are then discussed. These <lb/>include a cut in the average income tax rate, a cut in the benefit replacement rate and a cut in the employer <lb/>social security contribution rate are then discussed. The implications of a budgetary compensation scheme <lb/>to lessen short-term costs for specific groups are also examined. A final section concludes. <lb/>2. <lb/>Framework of the DGE model <lb/>6. <lb/>This section presents the DGE model used to perform a number of policy simulations in the euro <lb/>area. The model assumes a closed economy with monopolistic competition in product and labour markets, <lb/>which provides firms and unions with price and wage setting power. Firms use a bundle of differentiated <lb/>labour services to produce a bundle of differentiated goods. Labour is the only production factor and yields <lb/>constant returns to scale. <lb/>Households <lb/>7. <lb/>The household sector consists of a continuum of households <lb/>. A share <lb/>of these <lb/>households faces liquidity constraints. Liquidity-constrained households, labelled <lb/>, have no <lb/>access to financial markets and consume their current disposable income at each period. By contrast, <lb/>unconstrained households, labelled <lb/>, have full access to financial markets. They can buy and sell <lb/>assets and transfer income over time. <lb/>Lifetime utility is the expected discounted value of utility at each period over an infinite horizon. The <lb/>utility function is additive in the utility from consumption and the disutility from work : <lb/>(1) <lb/>ECO/WKP(2008)56 <lb/></body>

			<body>where <lb/>indicates the degree of habit persistence, and the weight of leisure. The higher the <lb/>degree of habit persistence, the slower is the adjustment of consumption and output to a structural reform. <lb/>The parameters and <lb/>respectively denote the discount factor and the labour supply elasticity. The <lb/>parameter h is assumed to be zero for the liquidity-constrained households. <lb/>8. <lb/>Each household supplies differentiated labour services in a monopolistically competitive labour <lb/>market. For simplicity, the labour services of liquidity-constrained and intertemporally optimising <lb/>households are assumed to be of comparable quality. Labour inputs are then combined in a CES bundle of <lb/>the differentiated labour services: <lb/>with as the elasticity of substitution between services. <lb/>Demand for variety is a function of the relative wage and of total labour demand: <lb/>(2) <lb/>9. <lb/>The budget constraint of unrestricted households is: <lb/>(3) <lb/>with <lb/>the nominal wage of household , <lb/>the average nominal wage, <lb/>is the labour income tax, <lb/>the replacement rate for the non-employed part of the household (a proxy of the reservation wage), <lb/>profits, <lb/>nominal consumption, <lb/>the consumption tax rate, <lb/>one-period government bonds bought <lb/>at the start of period , the nominal interest rate, and <lb/>lump-sum taxes. The parameter <lb/>is the <lb/>share of lump-sum taxes levied from the non liquidity-constrained households. <lb/>Liquidity-constrained households can neither save current income nor borrow against future income. They <lb/>do not receive any profit. As a result, their net expenditure at each period equals their net income: <lb/>(4) <lb/>Consumption <lb/>10. <lb/>Households consume a bundle of differentiated goods, each one being provided by a firm <lb/>. Aggregate consumption thus equals: <lb/>with as the elasticity of substitution between . Demand for <lb/>depends on the relative price of the <lb/>variety and on the aggregate demand for consumption goods: <lb/>ECO/WKP(2008)56 <lb/></body>

			<body>(5) <lb/>11. <lb/>Intertemporally optimising households choose the consumption path that ensures equality of the <lb/>discounted marginal utility of consumption expenditure at each point of time. Differentiating utility (2) <lb/>under the budget restriction (3) gives the marginal utility of consumption: <lb/>(6) <lb/>12. <lb/>Moreover, the intertemporal optimality condition that determines income transfers, i.e. the <lb/>optimal amount of saving, reads: <lb/>(7) <lb/>Combining the first-order conditions (6) and (7) yields the optimal consumption path: <lb/>(8) <lb/>13. <lb/>The liquidity-constrained households spend all their currently disposable income on current <lb/>consumption. The marginal utility of income, derived from maximising (2) with <lb/>under restriction (4) <lb/>is: <lb/>(9) <lb/>Consumption under the budget constraint (4) equals: <lb/>(10) <lb/>14. <lb/>Finally, aggregate consumption is the weighted sum of the consumption levels of both types of <lb/>households: <lb/>(11) <lb/>Labour market <lb/>15. <lb/>Labour unions set wages for the differentiated households in a monopolistically competitive <lb/>labour market. It is assumed that optimising and liquidity-constrained consumers are uniformly distributed <lb/>across types of labour and hence across unions (see e.g. Galí et al., 2007). At each period, a typical union, <lb/>representing workers of type i, sets the wage to maximise the marginal value of income subject to the <lb/>labour demand function (2). The optimum wage obtained from differentiating (1) under the constraints (2) <lb/>and (3) -or (4) for liquidity-constrained households -with respect to <lb/>is: 3 <lb/>3. <lb/>This first-order condition assumes that unions neglect the effect of wage levels on unemployment transfer <lb/>levels, e.g. that unions care only about the working insiders. If unions took into account that, given the <lb/>replacement rate, higher wages imply higher transfers to the unemployed and higher household income, the <lb/>first-order condition would become <lb/></body>

			<body>All unions target the same wage, and wages are fully flexible, so that <lb/>. The previous expression <lb/>simplifies to: <lb/>The replacement rate exerts upward pressures on wages. The union weights the utility of labour income <lb/>using the weighted average of constrained and unconstrained households&apos; marginal utility of consumption, <lb/>i.e. <lb/>. Inserting (6) and (9) along this weighting scheme yields: <lb/>(12) <lb/>16. <lb/>Employment is equal across households, i.e. <lb/>, as firms allocate labour demand <lb/>uniformly across different workers, <lb/>Production and prices <lb/>17. <lb/>The production sector consists of a continuum of firms <lb/>producing a differentiated <lb/>product and setting prices in a monopolistically competitive product market. Labour is the only input and <lb/>yields constant returns to scale. Without loss of generality, the technology parameter is normalised to one. <lb/>Consequently, gross output of firm under this simple production function is: <lb/>(13) <lb/>18. <lb/>Each firm faces quadratic employment and price adjustment costs <lb/>and <lb/>respectively. <lb/>Adjustment costs are sunk costs that use part of the output and drive a wedge between production and <lb/>consumption. Labour adjustment costs can be interpreted as hiring and firing costs and price adjustment <lb/>costs as menu costs. A common specification of quadratic per-unit adjustment costs of firm (e.g. Cahuc <lb/>and Zylberberg, 2004; Hamermesh, 1995; Rotemberg, 1982) is: <lb/>The choice of a quadratic specification has obviously some implications on the path to adjust to policy <lb/>shocks. However, using linear rather than quadratic adjustment costs would not fundamentally modify the <lb/>results (Mourougane and Vogel, 2008). <lb/>and the subsequent wage setting equation would change accordingly. <lb/>ECO/WKP(2008)56 <lb/>10 <lb/>19. <lb/>The aggregate level of output is: <lb/>Assuming firms adjust at the same time, as in Rotemberg (1982), there is no relative price dispersion and <lb/>. Following equation (5), consumption demand equally spreads across the product varieties . <lb/>Symmetry also implies adjustment costs are identical across firms, so that <lb/>and <lb/>. Consequently, aggregate output equals: <lb/>(14) <lb/>Firms set the price so as to maximise their discounted stream of profits: <lb/>, <lb/>which yields the dynamic price-setting equation <lb/>(15) <lb/>20. <lb/>Quadratic price adjustment costs reduce the elasticity of prices to current production costs and <lb/>introduce a forward-looking component into pricing decisions. Aggregate demand influences the current <lb/>level of output and employment because of the sluggish price adjustment. Both employment and price <lb/>adjustment costs generate gaps between actual output and the production level that would prevail under <lb/>perfectly flexible markets. 4 The marginal value of income <lb/>in equation (15) refers to intertemporal <lb/>optimisers only, because liquidity-constrained consumers do not own firms. Without adjustment costs, <lb/>, equation (15) reduces to <lb/>. The latter is the standard pricing rule <lb/>under monopolistic competition and flexible prices, when <lb/>are the marginal costs of production. <lb/>Monetary and fiscal policies <lb/>21. <lb/>The government budget is assumed to be balanced over the long-run. The government collects a <lb/>wage income tax , a consumption tax , and employer social security contributions . It pays transfers <lb/>at the replacement rate to unemployed household members and issues bonds <lb/>to balance the budget. <lb/>It can also levy lump-sum taxes to this aim. Public final demand is omitted for simplicity, but this would <lb/>not substantially modify the results. The government budget constraint is: <lb/>(16) <lb/>4. <lb/>Note that although price adjustment costs introduce persistence in prices, they do not generate inflation <lb/>persistence. In order to generate inflation persistence one would have to include some form of price <lb/>indexation (e.g. Smets and Wouters, 2003) or backward-looking behaviour in the formation of <lb/>expectations. <lb/>ECO/WKP(2008)56 <lb/></body>

			<body>22. <lb/>Forward-looking consumption and price setting behaviour requires a policy rule to ensure the <lb/>uniqueness and stability of the equilibrium. To keep the analysis simple, policy rates are assumed to react <lb/>to current inflation: <lb/>(17) <lb/>with <lb/>in all simulations. The inclusion of an output gap in the policy rule would require the choice <lb/>of a specific definition for potential output within the DGE framework. In addition some may argue that <lb/>output gap estimates are particularly uncertain in the aftermath of structural reforms. As the ECB usually <lb/>focuses on price stability, a monetary reaction function with inflation as the main determinant appears to be <lb/>a plausible assumption. <lb/>Table 1.

			<body>4. <lb/>Simulations <lb/>25. <lb/>The short-term distributional effects of reforms are examined using DGE model-based <lb/>simulations. Three types of policy changes are considered: a one percentage-point cut in the <lb/>(unemployment) benefit replacement rate, a one percentage-point average income tax rate cut and a one <lb/>percentage-point cut in employer social security contributions. The main mechanisms at play in the model <lb/>following a cut in these policy variables are: <lb/>− An income tax rate cut increases the net real wage, labour supply and current disposable <lb/>income, while a decrease in employer social security contributions directly reduces <lb/>production costs and consequently dampens prices. <lb/>− Unemployment benefits can be assimilated to a reservation wage and reduce labour supply at <lb/>given real wage levels. As a result, lower benefits will raise labour supply, even though they <lb/>may temporarily decrease disposable income. <lb/>− Disposable income and consumption of liquidity-constrained households are affected by the <lb/>way reforms are financed (self-financing of reforms or introduction of a scheme to balance <lb/>the budget). <lb/>5. <lb/>Some reforms entail short-term costs <lb/>26. <lb/>The distributional effects of reforms vary widely across the different policy measures. In <lb/>particular, the impact on consumption of a cut in income tax or in social security contributions is positive <lb/>in the short term for both types of households, while differences are more pronounced for a reduction in the <lb/>benefit replacement rate (Figures 1 to 3). In the latter case, liquidity-constrained households experience an <lb/>initial decline in their level of consumption, while non-constrained households do not. This result suggests <lb/>that structural reforms can display short-term costs concentrated on specific population groups. The <lb/>absence of transitional losses for some specific groups of the population reflects to a large extent the <lb/>specific shock introduced here namely a cut in the average income tax rate. A cut in the top rate or in the <lb/>rate that applies to low-income workers could generate significant distributional effects, depending on the <lb/>way the loss in government revenue is counterbalanced. Despite the absence of short-term losses, the gains <lb/>from an income tax cut or a cut in social security contributions will not be equally distributed across the <lb/>two types of households. <lb/>27. <lb/>Employment adjustment costs have temporary but moderate effects on the distribution of short-<lb/>term income and consumption gains between households. Reducing euro area employment adjustment <lb/>costs to their US levels has virtually no effect on the consumption path of intertemporally optimising <lb/>households but a more pronounced impact on liquidity-constrained households. 5 Indeed, it reduces the <lb/>amplitude of the decline in real wages during the transition, so that the consumption of liquidity-<lb/>constrained agents is higher. In most cases, price adjustment costs are found to have only a marginal <lb/>impact on real adjustment after structural reforms, the main exception being in the case of a benefit <lb/>replacement rate cut (Figure 2). <lb/>5. <lb/>It is assumed that a budget-neutral policy immediately offsets the wealth effect of fiscal measures by lump-<lb/>sum transfers. Each household type receives or pays a proportionate share of these transfers. <lb/></body>

Lower <lb/>employment adjustment costs accelerate the adjustment of real wages and liquidity-constrained <lb/>consumption after an income tax rate cut or a cut in employer social security contributions. However, the <lb/>difference is more pronounced after a benefit replacement rate reduction, as liquidity-constrained <lb/>consumers initially lose income. Lower adjustment costs attenuate and shorten the temporary real wage <lb/>decline and the transitory real consumption loss for liquidity-constrained households. In the same vein, <lb/>lowering price adjustment costs is found to have a marked effect only in the case of a cut in the benefit <lb/>replacement rate. Indeed, the reduction of the reservation wage exerts downward pressure on real wages <lb/>and lowers production costs. The faster the reaction of prices to lower production costs, the more contained <lb/>is the drop in real wages and the decline in real consumption from liquidity-constrained households. <lb/></body>

			<body>6. <lb/>Budgetary compensation schemes can reduce potential short-term costs <lb/>29. <lb/>The introduction of a fiscal rule to balance the government budget after the implementation of <lb/>structural reforms can have a marked impact on the short-term adjustment and the long-run distribution of <lb/>efficiency gains (Figures 4 to 6). Under a deficit-neutral reform, the government budget is balanced at each <lb/>point in time, assuming for simplicity the availability of lump-sum taxes and transfers to achieve this <lb/>balance. Lump-sum measures offset the wealth effect of reforms without introducing further substitution <lb/>effects. 6 Relying on distortionary taxation and demand components instead would affect incentives and <lb/>either reinforce or weaken the initial impact of the reform. The baseline scenario assumes that liquidity-<lb/>constrained households proportionately share the fiscal burden after a tax cut or the reduction in social <lb/>security contributions, or the fiscal gains from a reduction in the benefit replacement rate. Under an <lb/>alternative scenario, the fiscal burden or gain is entirely shifted to the intertemporally optimising <lb/>households. <lb/>30. <lb/>Shifting the entire fiscal burden of an income tax cut or a reduction in employer social security <lb/>contributions to intertemporally optimising households diminishes the gains of the latter from structural <lb/>reforms. By contrast, liquidity-constrained consumers experience an increase in disposable income and <lb/>consumption. Depriving liquidity-constrained households from the fiscal gains from lower unemployment <lb/>transfers would have the opposite effect. Liquidity-constrained households would lose in net wealth terms, <lb/>while optimising consumers would gain compared to the baseline redistribution scheme, where budgetary <lb/>surpluses are shared between the two types of households. <lb/>31. <lb/>A budget consolidation scheme would affect not only the relative long-term position of the two <lb/>types of consumers, but also aggregate production and consumption in the long run. Exempting liquidity-<lb/>constrained consumers from fiscal consolidation reduces aggregate output, while excluding them from the <lb/>redistribution of fiscal surpluses would moderately raise long-run production. These effects reflect mostly <lb/>the assumption of a diminishing marginal utility of income. Liquidity-constrained households do not <lb/>receive profits and dividends from firms and thus consume less than unconstrained households in the <lb/>steady state. The exemption from fiscal consolidation raises liquidity-constrained consumers&apos; disposable <lb/>income and consumption. Given the decreasing marginal utility of consumption, labour supply declines <lb/>and wage claims rise, reducing equilibrium employment and production. Excluding liquidity-constrained <lb/>households from the redistribution of fiscal gains would reduce their disposable income and lead to wage <lb/>moderation and higher production. As structural reforms have a permanent budgetary impact in the model <lb/>these income effects are also long-lasting. <lb/>32. <lb/>Overall the introduction of a budgetary compensation scheme can help to alleviate short-term <lb/>transition costs borne by certain population groups, thereby reducing potential opposition to reforms. The <lb/>counterpart is that the expected positive long-term effects of structural reforms will also be diminished. <lb/>However, aggregate long-term effects are a weighted average across both types of households. Computing <lb/>measures of aggregate welfare is not straightforward and the weighting of individual pay-offs is a matter of <lb/>social choice, as are the weights attributed to efficiency versus equity outcomes. <lb/>6. <lb/>As the intertemporal optimisers operate under an infinite planning horizon the time structure of budget <lb/>consolidation does not affect private sector behaviour in this case. Budget balancing may even only occur <lb/>in the distant future. <lb/></body>

			<body>7. <lb/>Conclusions <lb/>33. <lb/>This paper has cast some light on the short-term distributional effects of selected structural <lb/>reforms using DGE-based simulations and differentiating the impact on liquidity-constrained households <lb/>which cannot fully optimise their consumption patterns over time and non-constrained households, which <lb/>have full access to financial markets. The main conclusion is that liquidity-constrained households are <lb/>found to experience significant short-term losses after a cut in the benefit replacement rate. By contrast, <lb/>cuts in the average income tax rate or in employer social security contributions do not generate similar <lb/>short-term losses. Taking measures that lower price and employment adjustment costs or, alternatively, <lb/>introducing a budgetary scheme that compensates losers can reduce these short-term losses. The first <lb/>alternative may appear more promising as it has no impact on the long-term benefits of reforms, but this <lb/>also reflects the way adjustment costs are modelled in the DGE model. At the same time, setting up a fiscal <lb/>compensation scheme may be easier and faster to implement than trying to alter adjustment costs, as policy <lb/>makers have a direct control on fiscal instruments. Overall, the final decision about the extent of <lb/>redistribution will depend on the country&apos;s social preferences in terms of economic efficiency and equity. <lb/>34. <lb/>The work undertaken in this paper is subject to the usual caveats of using simple DGE models <lb/>(De Grauwe, 2008). In addition, a number of extensions are worth investigating. First, it would be useful <lb/>to replicate this work for other countries using alternative calibration of habit persistence or labour supply <lb/>parameters to check the robustness of the findings. Second, the framework could be extended to examine in <lb/>more detail how different population groups are affected by structural reforms in the short term (e.g. <lb/>households differentiated by employment status, earnings or age). <lb/></body>
