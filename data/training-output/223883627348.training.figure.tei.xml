RÉSUMÉ<lb/> Ce rapport présente les résultats d&apos;une première tentative d&apos;élaborer un cadre d&apos;évaluation de la<lb/> performance des politiques nationales en faveur des familles. Ce rapport fait partie d&apos;un projet élaboré<lb/> conjointement par l&apos;Union Européenne et l&apos;OCDE, qui vise à aider le groupe d&apos;experts gouvernementaux<lb/> sur les sujets démographiques de l&apos;Union Européenne pour évaluer les politiques nationales d&apos;aides aux<lb/> familles. L&apos;idée sous-jacente est de permettre à chaque pays de comparer ses performances avec celles des<lb/> autres pays. Les familles avec de jeunes enfants sont le principal sujet d&apos;analyse de ce rapport.<lb/> Le cadre élaboré propose un ensemble d&apos;indicateurs comparables entre pays sur les contextes, les<lb/> mesures politiques et les résultats, organisés sur une base systématique. Les indicateurs de mesures<lb/> politiques couvrent les dispositifs de congé, d&apos;aides à l&apos;éducation et aux soins accordées à la petite enfance,<lb/> les prestations financières et les politiques liées au lieu de travail. Ces indicateurs ont été élaborés, inter<lb/> alia, à partir des travaux antérieurs de l&apos;OCDE sur les politiques favorables aux familles qui ont été<lb/> conduites de manière comparative sur la base de différents ensembles d&apos;indicateurs. La plupart de ces<lb/> indicateurs sont aujourd&apos;hui disponibles au sein de la base de données OCDE sur les Familles. Ces<lb/> indicateurs ont été inclus pour la majorité des pays de l&apos;Union Européenne et de l&apos;OCDE pour lesquels ils<lb/> sont disponibles. Lorsqu&apos;ils n&apos;étaient pas disponibles, des données provenant de bases internationales ont<lb/> été prises en compte.<lb/> Chaque indicateur est présenté ici de façon séparée, car il n&apos;y a pas de consensus scientifique sur la<lb/> pondération qui permettrait de les agréger. Aucun classement explicite des pays n&apos;a été tenté ici ; la<lb/> position relative des pays est, au contraire, illustrée au moyen de scores d&apos;écarts-types.<lb/> Dans la dernière partie du rapport, les liens entre les objectifs politiques et les variables de contexte,<lb/> de résultats et de mesures politiques sont pris en compte pour élaborer des « cartes de score ». Cette<lb/> approche par « cartes de scores » est illustrée pour trois pays : le Danemark, l&apos;Allemagne et le Royaume-<lb/>Uni.<lb/> Ce rapport offre des outils d&apos;évaluation qui pourront être encore développés, et devrait offrir une<lb/> approche de la manière d&apos;utiliser la base de données de l&apos;OCDE sur les Familles, qui constitue une source<lb/> de données incontournable pour faire des comparaisons internationales dans le champ des politiques<lb/> familiales.

            <figDesc>Women&apos;s average age at first birth<lb/> will be used as an indicator in this report to underscore the sensitivity of the total fertility rate, but also to<lb/> emphasise what are believed to be the associated risks in terms of childlessness and higher health risks for<lb/> mothers and children (d&apos;Addio and d&apos;Ercole, 2005).<lb/> 47.<lb/> Among the countries where out-of-wedlock births are more frequent, statistics suggest that<lb/> fertility rates are also lower (d&apos;Addio and d&apos;Ercole, 2005).<lb/> 48.<lb/> Another crucial indicator, usually referred to as a context indicator, is the number of single-<lb/>person households. Data from the OECD shows that from the mid-1970s to the mid-1990s we have<lb/> witnessed an increase in the population share of single-person households (OECD, 1999). Not all of these<lb/> singles have dependent children, and some of them are young and elderly persons who for various reasons<lb/> live without a partner. However, we have also witnessed an increase in the number of lone-parent families<lb/> in the last 40 years (OECD, 2007). The share of lone-parent households as a proportion of all<lb/> households with children is used here to report the proportion of children who grow up in a household<lb/> with only one breadwinner, which can be an important indication of how many children risk living in an<lb/> economically vulnerable family. Across the OECD countries in general, poverty risks are proportionally<lb/> much higher among children living in single-parent households than for children living in two-parent<lb/> households, whether or not the parents are working (OECD, 2007).<lb/> 49.<lb/> The decline in fertility also results both in smaller average numbers of persons overall in<lb/> households, and in a tendency to have a smaller number of children per household. We suggest using the<lb/> average household size and also the proportion of households with no children to describe the context.</figDesc>

            <figDesc>part-time employment of<lb/> women. Again, a deeper analysis could differentiate between the part-time employment rates of women<lb/> without children and those of women with children in different age groups. Moreover, part-time<lb/> employment rates could also differ by the number of average hours working part-time. This reflects the<lb/> broad variety of part-time work. Such indicators could also indicate whether part-time work substantially<lb/> increases the financial resources of families. This is important as parental employment can contribute to<lb/> the aim of reducing child poverty. Part-time employment rates for men show that this is still not a<lb/> widely used tool for taking on childcare responsibilities. Men usually work full-time and do not adjust their<lb/> working hours for family reasons. However, country differences in part-time employment rates for men<lb/> might show differences in the outcomes of different family policies. The same differences might be useful<lb/> for the analysis of full-time employment rates of women and men, respectively.<lb/> 52.<lb/> Apart from adjusting working hours by switching to part-time employment, the statutory<lb/> maximum and the average number of actual working hours are indicators that make it possible to<lb/> assess a country&apos;s overall policy with regard to work-life balance concepts. They give a good picture of the<lb/> overall statutory framework and the real outcomes. Statutory working-time requirements protect<lb/> employees from being required to work beyond legal limits, but also provide information on time<lb/> allocation by employees with care responsibilities. If their statutory maximum working time is already<lb/> high, employees with care responsibilities could face greater difficulties combining work and family life.<lb/> The actual working hours also gives hints as to how parents&apos; work-life balance is affected by overtime or<lb/> other unplanned work schedules.</figDesc>

        <figure>

            <figDesc>differences between<lb/> preferred and actual hours of work could demonstrate how the combination of national level support and<lb/> firm-level practices enables parents to target their preferred distribution of work and care. The respective<lb/> indicators are not yet available in the OECD Family Database but are planned for future inclusion.<lb/> 54.<lb/> Both the income position and the employment status of parents influence the poverty risks of<lb/> their children. Parental income is another indirect indicator of child wellbeing and thus useful for the<lb/> assessment of family policy. Parental income positions can be assessed using an indicator of poverty in<lb/> households with children. This indicator is part of the OECD Family Database, and presents figures on<lb/> the percentage of all households with children and a working-age household head facing poverty. A<lb/> household is considered poor if the equivalised income of all household members lies below the 50% median threshold. 4</figDesc>

            <figDesc>Indicators for core assessment: gender equality<lb/> •<lb/> Gender gap in employment<lb/> •<lb/> Gender wage gap<lb/> 55.<lb/> With respect to gender equality, we suggest that countries assess the gender gap in employment<lb/> reported by the OECD Family Database. The gender gap in employment indicates percentage point<lb/> differences between employment rates for men and women of the same age. Here, the OECD refers to the<lb/> population aged 25 to 64. The value countries assess thus measures how many women relative to men are<lb/> in full-time employment. A high value indicates that fewer women than men are working full-time.</figDesc>

            <figDesc>measures are particularly important indicators of whether children have<lb/> had a good start in life and thus had good opportunities for appropriate development. The most frequently<lb/> used indicators in this context are infant mortality rates and low birth weights (see e.g., UNICEF, 2007).<lb/> 60.<lb/> With respect to indicators of child development, for older children, literacy scores at age nine and<lb/> PISA scores can be assessed. Young adolescents are evaluated according to their school performance.<lb/> PISA scores enable countries to assess the quality and performance of their educational system. Moreover,<lb/> equality of opportunity means making a high-quality education equally accessible to all children.<lb/> Furthermore, the transition from education to working life has become difficult in recent times. The high<lb/> proportion of young people not in education in many countries illustrates the problems surrounding school-<lb/>to-work transitions. The percentage of young people not in education also makes it possible to infer<lb/> possible social exclusion. It indicates that young adolescents lack relevant skills and qualifications to earn<lb/> a living later in life. Thus, for the assessment of educational attainment, we report the percentage of young<lb/> people not participating in education. For children under the compulsory school age, there are hardly<lb/> any internationally comparable skill indicators available. Thus, no skill indicators could be assessed for<lb/> these young age groups.</figDesc>

In the low SD group, at 26.4 years, we find mainly eastern European countries, the<lb/> Baltic countries plus the US, Ireland and Iceland. The Netherlands has the lowest mean age at 21.3 years.<lb/> The western and northern European countries place in the middle and high SD group, which ranges from<lb/> 27 to 28 years. In these two SD groups, we also find Asia and New Zealand, the latter having the highest<lb/> mean age at 30.7 years.<lb/> 74.<lb/> The OECD average for lone-parent households as a proportion of all households with<lb/> children is 15.4%, with a somewhat lower figure for the EU-27, at 12.1%. In the low SD group, at 11% of<lb/> all households, we find all of the southern European countries for which data is available, with the lowest<lb/> proportion found in Greece at 5%. The US, Australia, New Zealand and the United Kingdom are in the<lb/> high SD group.<lb/> 75.<lb/> Indicators depicting parental labour market and income positions are presented in Table 2.<lb/> Employment rates of women with children aged 0-16 are on average 61.6% among the OECD countries.<lb/> The average labour-market participation of mothers is slightly lower among the EU-27 (59.5%). For new<lb/> EU members, information is only available for Slovakia (48.4%) and the Czech Republic (52.8%).<lb/> 76.<lb/> Part-time and full-time employment rates are stated for men and women separately. Most men<lb/> work full-time, and the averages of the OECD and EU-27 countries are nearly the same. Among the OECD<lb/> countries, 96.2% of males are employed full-time (in the EU 96.4%), whereas only 7.2% of men are<lb/> employed part-time in the OECD member states (6.3% for the EU-27). The employment rates for women<lb/> differ, as the full-time employment rate on average is above 60% in both country groupings. Female full-<lb/>time employment averages 77.1% in the OECD countries, and is slightly higher in the European countries<lb/> (78.1%). Part-time employment rates of women are, on average, three times higher than for male<lb/> employees. In Europe, 24.1% of women are employed part-time, while the OECD countries average<lb/> 25.6%. Yet male part-time employment is not below 10% in all countries. The Netherlands report 16.2% of<lb/> total male employment as part-time work, and in Norway (11.2%) and Australia (12.4%) large percentages<lb/> of men also work part-time.<lb/> 77.<lb/> Concerning statutory working hours, the maximum working time per week comes to 44.4 hours<lb/> in the OECD countries and 44.1 hours in the European countries. This indicates that working time is<lb/> regulated similarly among all countries covered in the tables. With respect to working time assessments,<lb/> collectively agreed working time is considered in our table, given the widespread use of collective<lb/> bargaining in Europe. The collectively agreed number of working hours per week is the same for both<lb/> country groupings.

For<lb/> Europe, the gender wage gap averages 14.5%. 7 For the OECD countries, the gender wage gap indicates a<lb/> high gender inequity in Japan (33%) and Korea (38%), whereas in Europe, Germany (22%) and Slovakia<lb/> (22%) are more discriminatory in terms of gender payment than other EU member states such as Belgium<lb/> (7%). Another indicator referring to gender equality is the gender gap in employment. It indicates<lb/> percentage point differences between male and female employment rates for people of the same age group.<lb/> The OECD countries&apos; gender gap in employment averages 18.6%, whereas in Europe it adds up to 16.8%.<lb/> Here, southern Mediterranean countries such as Greece (32%) and Turkey (51%) stand out.<lb/> 81.<lb/> In</figDesc>

            <figDesc>reports a number of health indicators that can be used to assess child<lb/> outcomes. Particularly for young children, health measures are important as they indicate whether children<lb/> have good chances of healthy development. The infant mortality rate is the number of deaths during the<lb/> first year of a child&apos;s life expressed per 1 000 live births. On average, 5.5 deaths per 1 000 live births occur<lb/> in the OECD countries, whereas in Europe the average amounts to 4.3 deaths. Infant mortality rates are the<lb/> highest in Turkey (23.6 deaths) and Mexico (18.8 deaths), but in the US infant mortality rates are also<lb/> relatively high at 6.8 deaths per 1 000 live births.<lb/> 83.<lb/> Low birth weight is also reported as a health indicator in Table 4. Among the OECD and<lb/> European countries, 6.5% of newborns weigh less than 2 500 grams. Low birth weight rates range up to a<lb/> high of 8.9% in Iceland and 8.8% in Greece.<lb/> 84.<lb/> Finally, child outcomes can also be assessed by educational indicators. For this purpose, we<lb/> discuss the percentage of young people not in education by gender as well as the PISA scores for each<lb/> country. Only 6.9% of young males are not in education in the OECD countries, and about 6.3% in Europe.<lb/> For young females, the average among the OECD members is higher than for males, given the high<lb/> 7<lb/> Please note that the difference might be caused by different sample sizes and sources. percentage of young women not enrolled in education in countries such as Turkey (47.1%). The average<lb/> percentage of young females not participating in the educational system is 8.5% in the OECD countries<lb/> and about 6.3% in Europe. PISA scores range from 410 (Mexico) to 563 (Finland). The averages between<lb/> OECD and European countries are quite close. PISA scores average 499 points for the OECD states and an<lb/> average of 497 points among the EU member states.<lb/> 85.<lb/> The indicators reported in Table 5 enable countries to assess values, preferences and life<lb/> satisfaction.<lb/> 86.<lb/> In regard to the childbearing preferences of childless women between the ages of 15 and 39, on<lb/> average 12.3% of these women in the OECD countries and 9.6% in the EU-27 countries state that they<lb/> have no desire to have children. The proportion is lowest in Iceland, where virtually all childless women<lb/> express a desire to have children at some point in their lives, and highest in Finland, where 20% of<lb/> childless women have no desire to have children.</figDesc>

The<lb/> reported mean per country depicts the average answer on this scale. We report two different sources of life<lb/> satisfaction data. The European source provides an average among the EU-27 member states of 6.9. This<lb/> indicates that on average, people usually evaluate their personal life satisfaction as 7 on a scale of 1 to 10.<lb/> The missing OECD countries that are not members of the EU show a slightly higher average value on this<lb/> satisfaction scale, with 7.5.

            <figDesc>As a first indicator for parental leave for an assessment of family policy, we suggest social<lb/> expenditure on leave schemes as a percentage of GDP. This provides an overview of public social<lb/> investments in leave schemes. In combination with the indicator on social expenditure for daycare and<lb/> educational services for children as a percentage of GDP presented in Chapter 5.2, it may indicate whether<lb/> countries emphasise daycare/educational services for children or leave benefits. A more sophisticated<lb/> indicator is, however, the indicator social expenditure for maternity and parental leave payments per<lb/> child born, as a percentage of GDP. This indicator combines the expenditure on leave schemes with the<lb/> actual number of children being born, and thus takes into account cross-national differences in birth rates.</figDesc>

            <figDesc>Some countries have introduced legal entitlements to daycare; most of these guarantee daycare<lb/> services to children over the age of three, but some of the Nordic countries also provide these services to<lb/> children under three. The first indicator of universalism in the report is whether or not children aged 0-2<lb/> and 3-6 are offered a formal entitlement to daycare. A guarantee of service provision does not, however,<lb/> mean that adequate services are actually available: there may, for example, be long waiting lists to get into<lb/> daycare programmes.<lb/> 121.<lb/> Most countries have, however, experienced enormous growth in daycare provision in the last 20<lb/> years. Among the EU countries, where the Barcelona targets of 33% for 0-2 and 90% for 3-6 by 2010 have<lb/> set new standards, this growth has been especially rapid. Most EU countries provide for more or less all<lb/> children aged 3-6, and some components of these services are in pre-primary education, which prepares<lb/> children for schooling. There has also been an increase in the proportion of children in the 0-2 age group<lb/> using daycare services. In this report, we use the indicator enrolment in daycare and educational<lb/> services for children, which</figDesc>

            <figDesc>Availability may also be measured as public investments in the provision of daycare services.<lb/> Here, we report social expenditure on ECEC as a percentage of GDP. This is divided into expenditure<lb/> for childcare (mainly 0-2 years) and pre-primary education (mainly 3-6 years) in order to emphasise where<lb/> countries place their emphasis. Not all ECEC expenditure, especially when related to social welfare<lb/> provision, is necessarily included, however. As reported by Bennett (2008), the data on expenditure taken<lb/> from the OECD Social Expenditure Database is often lower than what was reported by the individual<lb/> countries in 2004 to the Starting Strong reviews conducted by the OECD. He notes that there seems to be<lb/> some underreporting, as expenditure levels were considerably higher in the Nordic countries in the OECD<lb/> national reviews. Employers&apos; investments in the financing of ECEC services – as is common in the<lb/> Netherlands, for instance – may not be included in social expenditure data either. It is also worth keeping<lb/> in mind that social expenditure levels will generally depend on the age of the child, as expenditure levels<lb/> on younger children tend to be higher due to the higher number of staff members and also to cross-national<lb/> variation in the calculation of fees, required child:staff ratios and staff training levels. In daycare<lb/> programmes with a high ratio of staff members to children, and with staff members who have received<lb/> tertiary education, for example, costs will be higher, given that the largest share of ECEC expenditure goes<lb/> to staff wages.<lb/> 128.<lb/> Expenditure levels may nevertheless indicate public involvement in this field. We have thus<lb/> included the public share of expenditure as an indicator. This indicator shows the proportion of<lb/> expenditure that the public contributes, and thus indicates how much is left for the parents (or employer) to<lb/> cover.<lb/> Affordability<lb/> 129.<lb/> The financial burden of childcare plays an important part in parents&apos; decisions about whether to<lb/> participate in the labour market. Expensive services may prevent parents from using ECEC or even<lb/> applying to such programmes. Correlations between childcare costs and fertility rates give some indication<lb/> that high childcare costs may also affect decisions about whether to have a child, but this is modified to<lb/> some degree by a high availability of daycare services (OECD, 2008a).<lb/> 130.<lb/> Countries may subsidise daycare provision, reduce costs for low-income or lone-parent families,<lb/> or offer a sibling rebate to parents with more than one child. Tax reductions may also be provided so that<lb/> working parents can reduce the costs of childcare. Tax breaks towards the costs of childcare are common<lb/> in, for example, Belgium, France, Germany, Greece, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal and the UK.<lb/> 131.<lb/> One indicator of the affordability of ECEC systems is the total of what childcare costs for a<lb/> dual-earner family with earnings representing one full-time and one part-time earner (calculated according to earnings for an Average Production Worker) would amount to for two participating children<lb/> aged 2 and 3, after any tax reductions and childcare benefits.</figDesc>

Good staff<lb/> training can foster high-quality social care provision. The level of training is reported here as whether there<lb/> are 80% or more of staff members who have received training. In addition, we have included an<lb/> indicator that shows whether 50% or more staff members have finished tertiary education. Also<lb/> relevant would be personal aptitude and work experience and the combinations of trained and untrained<lb/> staff.</figDesc>

However, it is not necessary to provide information on the<lb/> full range of income levels as indicators in the core assessment. Instead we report the size of the family<lb/> benefit package for a family with average earnings, which provides information about the generosity of<lb/> family benefits for an average family. If (some) benefits are means-tested, these values are informative<lb/> about a certain range of earnings only. Therefore the OECD computes what could be called a &quot; targeting<lb/> ratio &quot; . This compares the level of benefits for those with high earnings (200% AW) to those with no<lb/> earnings (0% AW). In the case of targeting, this ratio is greater than one.

            <figDesc>Leave arrangements initiated at the firm level are less frequent than leave decisions mandated by<lb/> law. Nonetheless, we consider two indicators in this context to be valuable for family policy assessment:<lb/> first, an indicator covering the proportion of firms with male employees on parental leave and the<lb/> respective take-up of leave for males. This indicator enables us to identify countries where fathers might<lb/> face negative attitudes or other barriers that could prevent them from taking up parental leave. A second<lb/> leave-related indicator is the prevalence of leave take-up among women and men. With regard to the<lb/> gender division of parental leave, it is helpful to describe the overall acceptance of extended leave<lb/> provision.<lb/> 172.<lb/> An indicator that clearly belongs at the firm level is the childcare arrangements of firms. The<lb/> indicator depicting employer provision of daycare compares firms with employees on leave and firms with<lb/> no employees on leave. It does not necessarily hold that firms with leave arrangements are more likely to<lb/> provide daycare, as some countries differ in the state provision of childcare and leave arrangements.</figDesc>

            <figDesc>presents an overview of the indicators for all countries. Indicators<lb/> related to policies on the employer level are scarce for the OECD countries outside Europe. In fact, all<lb/> indicators had to be taken from European sources. This lack of non-European data is also the reason why<lb/> the OECD and EU averages do not differ (significantly).<lb/> 174.<lb/> First, Table 12 reports indicators related to flexible working-time arrangements. Regarding<lb/> these different possibilities, the following patterns can be noted for Europe. The possibility to vary the<lb/> start and end of the working day is widely used among the members of the EU-21, followed by the<lb/> possibility to use accumulated hours for longer leave periods. The former possibility is provided on<lb/> average by 14.8% of firms in Europe, and the latter by 12.4%. The variation in the start and end of the<lb/> working day is used mostly in Ireland (25% of firms) and Spain (23% of firms), whereas Scandinavian<lb/> firms prefer to offer their employees the option to accumulate hours for longer leaves, i.e., Denmark (25%)<lb/> and Sweden (27%). The possibility to use accumulated hours for full days off is provided by an average<lb/> of 12.0% firms. The option least-used by European firms is the possibility to accumulate hours but not<lb/> in order to take full days off; here, on average, only 7.1% of firms offer this option as a flexible working<lb/> time arrangement.<lb/> 175.<lb/> The indicators describing the rationale for introducing part-time work in firms approximate<lb/> the right, provided at the firm level, to request a switch from full-time to part-time work. Here, for the most<lb/> part firms report that employees switch to part-time work mainly on employee wishes (on average<lb/> 37.9%). This is for instance the case for firms in Scandinavian countries, i.e., 50% in Denmark. The reason<lb/> &quot; mainly needs of establishment &quot; is high in Cyprus (60%) and in Poland (65%). This rationale averages<lb/> 34.3% among the members of the EU-21. Firms that reported establishment needs and employee wishes<lb/> being of equal importance in switches to part-time work make up 20.8% of all firms in Europe.<lb/> 176.<lb/> Countries should assess not only the possibility of part-time work at the firm level, but also the<lb/> notion of reversibility. The indicator reporting reversibility indicates the proportion of firms per country<lb/> where employees can switch from part-time to full-time. On average 9% of firms that allow their<lb/> employees to switch from full-time to part-time also provide the possibility to switch back to full-time<lb/> employment. The highest proportion of firms providing reversibility can be found in Sweden (17%), in<lb/> Austria (16%), in France (16%) and in the UK (16%).<lb/> 177.<lb/> Leave arrangements provided at the firm level are less frequent than at state level. The indicators<lb/> firms with males on parental leave and prevalence of leave take-up allow parental leave to be assessed at the firm level. In Europe, 31.6% of establishments allow male employees to go on leave. The<lb/> Scandinavian countries report the highest proportion of firms offering leave periods to male employees<lb/> among all firms with employees on parental leave in past three years, for example, Finland (59%) and<lb/> Sweden (69%). The prevalence of leave take-up amounts to an average of 54.7% of firms. Sweden (89%)<lb/> and</figDesc>
