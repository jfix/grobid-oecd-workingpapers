			<body>The contagion of the global credit crisis from the <lb/>industrialised countries to the emerging markets has <lb/>taken some time to develop. Then, in October 2008, it <lb/>spread rapidly, afflicting all emerging markets, without any <lb/>distinction or regard to their so-called &quot; fundamentals &quot; . For <lb/>believers in &quot; decoupling &quot; , the high growth rates, massive <lb/>foreign exchange (FX) reserves, balanced budgets and <lb/>rising consumerism in the emerging markets at first <lb/>reassured investors. It is now clear that the diagnosis <lb/>of emerging-market policy performance suffered from <lb/>hyperbole. In the end, all emerging market asset classes <lb/>were hit: stocks, bonds and currencies. <lb/>The current financial crisis has lessons for <lb/>the diagnosis of emerging-market policy <lb/>performance, <lb/>the channels of crisis contagion, and <lb/>the future of private and official development <lb/>finance. <lb/>Optimists about decoupling underplayed the cyclicality and <lb/>endogeneity of important policy performance indicators: <lb/>Emerging-market growth rates: Much of the recent <lb/>growth has been driven by an extraordinary bonanza <lb/>in raw-materials prices and low financing costs. <lb/>Many analysts forgot the basic principle that growth <lb/>rates can only be sustained over the long run when <lb/>underpinned by productivity growth. Arguably, from <lb/>this perspective, many Asian countries have more <lb/>sustainable growth rates than emerging markets in <lb/>other regions. <lb/>♦ <lb/>♦ <lb/>♦ <lb/>♦ <lb/>FX reserve levels: Their durability depends very much <lb/>on the exchange rate regime. Authorities may wish to <lb/>avoid a currency slump, and may need to recapitalise <lb/>their banking systems; but if both foreign and domestic <lb/>investors lose confidence, even very impressive levels <lb/>of FX reserves can melt quickly away (as witnessed <lb/>in Russia recently). As long as reserves are below the <lb/>liabilities of the banking system (M2), individuals may <lb/>rush to convert their domestic currency deposits into <lb/>foreign currency and put pressure on the currency as <lb/>reserves dwindle... <lb/></body>

			<note place="footnote">Public budgets: A mistake which is often made by <lb/>rating agencies 1 is to focus excessively on debt-GDP <lb/>ratios and public deficits. Typically, both debt and <lb/>deficits decrease during the boom, but can shoot <lb/>up quickly during the crisis. Tax collection flourishes <lb/>with high exports and raw material prices but tumbles <lb/>during the bust. Similarly, currency appreciation during <lb/>the boom gives way to an endogenous rise in debt <lb/>ratios as currencies and GDP growth weaken. <lb/>Not everything is negative, however. To the extent that fuel <lb/>and food prices fall due to the crisis, government budgets <lb/>in low-income countries which subsidise fuel and food <lb/>prices may benefit as costly price subsidies can be reduced <lb/>(though this positive effect may be mitigated by currency <lb/>depreciation). In addition, public debt management has <lb/>improved in many countries: Brazil, for example now has a <lb/>net long position in dollars, such that currency depreciation <lb/>actually improves its net worth. <lb/>________ <lb/>1.

			<body>♦ <lb/>♦ <lb/>The Fallout from the Financial Crisis (1): <lb/>Emerging Markets under Stress <lb/>by Helmut Reisen <lb/>No. 83 <lb/>Policy Insights No. 83 © OECD 2008 <lb/>The opinions expressed in this paper are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of the OECD, <lb/>the Development Centre or their member countries. <lb/>The global credit crisis constitutes a key test regarding the resilience and sustainability of emerging-market <lb/>policy performance. <lb/>Even strong performers are not shielded against &quot; pure &quot; financial contagion, but once confidence is restored, <lb/>they may well recover quickly. <lb/>In the future, development finance is likely to rely less on private debt. <lb/>♦ <lb/>♦ <lb/>♦ <lb/>December 2008 <lb/>OECD Development Centre <lb/>2, rue André-Pascal, <lb/>75775 Paris Cedex 16, France <lb/>Tel.: +33-(0)1 45.24.82.00 <lb/>Fax: +33-(0)1 44 30 61 49 <lb/>E-mail: dev.contact@oecd.org <lb/>Readers are encouraged to quote or reproduce material from OECD <lb/>Development Centre Policy Insights for their own publications.

It is possible to distil important <lb/>policy lessons about preventing, managing and resolving <lb/>financial crises from recent emerging-market crises. One <lb/>thing in common with these crises is that they were less <lb/>caused by domestic factors and more related to crisis <lb/>contagion from elsewhere. Furthermore, such policy lessons <lb/>need to inform debates regarding the construction of a new <lb/>international (or regional) financial architecture 2 . Crisis <lb/>contagion in principle occurs through three channels: <lb/>Through foreign trade (sometimes known as the <lb/> &quot; monsoon effect &quot; ): the monsoon effects hit small <lb/>open economies easily through merchandise trade <lb/>precisely because they are both small and open to <lb/>trade. Low-income countries will be mostly hit through <lb/>the monsoon channel as recession in OECD countries <lb/>deepens. <lb/>Through financial contagion, when money invested <lb/>is repatriated. Currency mismatches in corporate and <lb/>bank balance sheets can cause widespread company <lb/>and bank failures. <lb/>Through &quot; pure &quot; contagion, as happened in October <lb/>2008, when a systemic and simultaneous breakdown <lb/>of money and banking markets leads to generalised <lb/>risk aversion and the shedding of all assets without <lb/>public guarantees. <lb/>Financial crises that are caused by the monsoon effect <lb/>or by financial contagion can in principle be predicted <lb/>through the monitoring of macroeconomic variables. Pure <lb/>contagion, by contrast, hits countries regardless of their <lb/>level of economic integration and is hard to predict or <lb/>to quantify. A wave of pure contagion, however, can be <lb/>stopped more easily by reversing expectations through <lb/>implementing decisive reflationary policies. <lb/>________ <lb/>2. Reisen, H. (1999), &quot; After the Great Asian Slump: Towards a Coherent Approach <lb/>to Global Capital Flows &quot; , Policy Brief No. 16, OECD Development Centre, Paris, <lb/>January. <lb/>♦ <lb/>♦ <lb/>♦ <lb/>As a mid-term consequence of the global credit crisis, <lb/>private debt will be financed only reluctantly, and capital <lb/>costs are bound to rise in the face of higher risk. Solvent <lb/>governments and public institutions will be forced to <lb/>become the lenders of last resort. The consequences for <lb/>development finance and the global financial architecture <lb/>will be important. Figure 1 shows clearly how development <lb/>loans by the World Bank, the IMF, and the regional <lb/>development banks had been crowded out by private-<lb/>sector lending throughout the boom decade. The supply <lb/>of public development finance will rise and regain some <lb/>of the attractiveness to poor countries that it lost during <lb/>the boom period. <lb/>Figure 1. Net Lending to Developing Countries <lb/>(USD billion) <lb/>Source: World Bank (2008), Global Development Finance. <lb/>Using a small part of emerging countries&apos; high FX reserves <lb/>to leverage them through multilaterial development banks <lb/>is a feasible way to restore development finance. Likewise, <lb/>the role of public guarantees, in particular by AAA-rated <lb/>governments, will have to be enhanced. <lb/>-100.0 <lb/>0.0 <lb/>100.0 <lb/>200.0 <lb/>300.0 <lb/>400.0 <lb/>500.0 <lb/>1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 <lb/>World Bank <lb/>IMF <lb/>Others official <lb/>Private creditors </body>
