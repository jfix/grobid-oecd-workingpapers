            <table>; 2016b).<lb/> Bicycle-sharing<lb/> Bicycle-sharing allows members and users to access bicycles that are available in public space. Analogue<lb/> bicycle-sharing systems have been around for decades but the arrival of IT-enabled, automated<lb/> bicycle-sharing systems has led to massive growth. In 2016, approximately 2 million shared bicycles were<lb/> available in second generation or later systems in 63 countries and in over 1 000 cities, municipalities or<lb/> district jurisdictions (Demaio, 2017). In sufficiently dense networks and where provisions have been made<lb/> to increase bicycle safety, bicycle-share systems can improve access and extend the reach of traditional<lb/> public transport networks.<lb/> Shared bicycle systems require registration and payment is ensured via various subscription or time-based<lb/> fees. There are several bike-share models. Currently, bike-share systems are dominated by dock-based<lb/> networks where bicycles are picked up and returned at specific stations. These systems must address some inherent challenges that have an impact on their viability, including deploying a sufficiently widespread and<lb/> dense network of stations and cost-effectively handling system-wide rebalancing needs. An alternative,<lb/> emerging model for bike-share is centred on dockless fleets of bicycles that can be picked up and dropped<lb/> off anywhere within a within a geo-fenced zone. In these instances, bicycles come equipped with on-board<lb/> GPS and communications equipment. Some peer-to-peer services also exist. Most IT-enabled systems have<lb/> proprietary apps that enable users to find bicycles and drop-off locations. In some cases, open application<lb/> programming interfaces (APIs) allow third party developers to include bike-share data in their applications.<lb/> A standardised bicycle data model – the General Bikeshare Feed Specification (GBFS) – has been developed<lb/> in order to facilitate data-sharing and inclusion of bicycle share data in modular APIs. This specification is<lb/> modelled along the lines of the General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) and may facilitate the integration<lb/> of bicycle-share services and payments with other bundled mobility services.<lb/> Car-sharing (and scooter-sharing)</table>

            <table>Taking advantage of new technological possibilities and in part inspired by informal public transport systems<lb/> around the world, some companies have developed app-enabled shared micro-bus services that replicate<lb/> the flexibility of car-based travel (or taxi and ride-sourcing) in certain markets (e.g. Chariot, Didi Bus, Grab<lb/> Shuttle, Ola Shuttle, Via or Ford&apos;s Go Ride service). Multiple business models supporting these services have been developed and they encompass different approaches to service design. For example, some<lb/> operate fixed routes that are in-part crowd-sourced by users (e.g. Chariot – see Figure 2) and others offer<lb/> services where riders are directed to pop-up stops within defined geographic areas. Some companies, like<lb/> Chariot, offer a mix of crowd-sourced fixed-route services alongside point-to-point travel. For example, the<lb/> Chariot Direct service runs counter to dominant commuting flows in San Francisco as a way to offer more<lb/> flexible options for commuters heading away from downtown and to help rebalance (and monetise)</table>

            <table>Since mid-2015 TNCs have offered and heavily promoted &quot;pooled&quot; options such as UberPool and LyftLine.<lb/> TNC mileage nonetheless continues to grow rapidly because exclusive-ride trips still predominate, and<lb/> because most TNC customers are coming from public transport, walking and biking. Migration from public<lb/> transport translates to increased mileage even if the trips are shared.<lb/> <lb/> Growth in trips, passengers and mileage is seen throughout the city as TNCs attracted yellow cab riders,<lb/> those who would otherwise use the bus, subway or their personal vehicle, and people who would not<lb/> otherwise have made the trip.

<lb/> 
            <table>Commercial ride-splitting or ride-pooling<lb/> Some ride-sourcing companies offer commercial ride-splitting, services (e.g. DIDI Hitch, GrabHitch, Lyft<lb/> Line, UberPool). These function are much like ride-sourcing services except that they match multiple,<lb/> unrelated individuals or parties to share the same vehicle over the course of the same ride. Ride-sharing<lb/> algorithms treat ride requests and allocate them in real time to available vehicles such that people get on<lb/> and off along the trip while minimising added travel distance and trip duration – e.g. the &quot; insertion cost &quot; .<lb/> Because insertion costs are contained and overall costs are split, these services provide a less-expensive<lb/> option to ride-sourcing and have proven popular in many markets. In some markets, these pooled ride<lb/> services are cost-competitive with traditional forms of public transport. These services are slightly<lb/> analogous to micro on-demand transit services although they generally remain door-to-door (and not<lb/> route-based) and typically use smaller vehicles. In some cases, access to ride-sharing services has been<lb/> bundled into a monthly subscription package (e.g. Lyft Line and UberPool pass trials).<lb/> Ride companies have tested a number of shared ride services based on fixed routes – for example, Uber&apos;s<lb/> Smart Routes in San Francisco and Chicago and Uber Hop in Seattle. In March, 2017 Lyft announced a trial<lb/> of its fixed-route shared service &quot; Lyft Shuttle &quot; in Chicago and San Francisco. It will offer fixed fares and no<lb/> peak demand surcharges unlike other Lyft Line services. These initiatives indicate that ride service data<lb/> reveals a potential for aggregating riders with common departure zones and destinations into shared fixed<lb/> route lines – operated by cars now but potentially involving minibuses in the future thus shifting towards<lb/> the on-demand micro-transit models described earlier. This shift also reveals potential for hybrid services to<lb/> develop that may be the basis for more formal and structured relationships with public transport operators<lb/> and authorities.<lb/> Maps, routing apps and services</table>

<lb/> 
            <figDesc>that a ride service based on fixed routes must employ vehicles that enable, for example, wheelchair access.<lb/> On-demand services, on the other-hand, must allow convenient, affordable and timely access to<lb/> wheelchair-accessible vehicles though not all vehicles deployed in the service must meet these criteria as<lb/> long as the vehicles have a capacity of less than 16 people including the driver.<lb/> For instance, the services operated by Chariot, described in Chapter 2, use vehicles with a capacity of less<lb/> than 16 people and thus the rules state &quot; the vehicles must be accessible unless the fixed route system,<lb/> when viewed in its entirety, provides equivalent service to persons with disabilities, including wheelchair<lb/> users &quot; (FTA, 2017). In the case of the KACTA-Bridj trial, vehicles were ADA-compliant whereas Bridj&apos;s<lb/> Boston service and Chariot&apos;s services, the overall service, but not necessarily every vehicle, provide &quot; ADA<lb/> equivalent &quot; service. In this context, the service design and the involvement of partners with sufficiently<lb/> large fleets of wheelchair-accessible services, can ensure conformity with ADA requirements. Arguably, the<lb/> flexibility and effectiveness of platform-based ride sourcing allows better deployment and use of the<lb/> accessible fleet as compared to single operator paratransit services. Platform-mediated ADA vehicle<lb/> requests also enable the pooling of adapted vehicles across multiple suppliers. The potential increase in<lb/> efficiency and improvement in wait times and other outcomes are what motivated MBTA to pilot its RIDE<lb/> service with Lyft and Uber in the first place.<lb/> </figDesc>

            <table>One of the recurrent questions in discussions regarding the convergence of innovative mobility services and<lb/> public transport relates to the broader equity impacts of this convergence as they relate to equitable<lb/> access. Equity issues extend to many potential groups, including low-income groups, minorities, part-time<lb/> workers, people with physical and cognitive impairments and the elderly. The Institute for Transport and<lb/> Development Policy has issued useful guidance in addressing how innovative mobility services can also<lb/> provide opportunities for low-income households (Kodransky and Lewenstein</table>
