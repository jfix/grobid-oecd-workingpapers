			<body>PREFACE <lb/>The migration of women is a growing phenomenon in most countries: about half of all <lb/>international migrants are women. The push and pull factors influencing this significant share of <lb/>migration have typically been explained as a by-product of male migration: female migrants <lb/>have been assumed to migrate mainly for reasons of family reunification as dependents of male <lb/>migrants as wives, daughters or mothers. Over the years, the body of knowledge on the <lb/>migration of women seeking better employment opportunities has increased, including research <lb/>on topics such the role of gender discrimination in the workplace. Despite this growing <lb/>knowledge, information on the links between migration and discriminatory social institutions <lb/>has been neglected in the economic literature. The causes, processes and impacts of migration on <lb/>women and men are expected to be different. By defining which decisions and behaviours are <lb/>acceptable for each gender, as well as restricting women&apos;s access to power and resources. Hence, <lb/>studying migration from a gender perspective implies looking beyond the differences in <lb/>migration behaviour between men and women, such as the likelihood and type of migration, and <lb/>to examine further the inequalities underlying those differences. <lb/>This paper assesses how South-South migration and gender discrimination in social <lb/>institutions mutually influence one another. Gender discrimination in both the origin and <lb/>destination country appears to be an additional push and pull factor for female migrants. In <lb/>addition, the relevance of international migration goes well beyond the movement of people as <lb/>migration also represents a powerful mechanism to transmit ideas across borders. This <lb/>contributes to a better understanding of why discriminatory laws, attitudes and practices persist <lb/>and how social transformation and shifts in discriminatory social institutions can occur. In <lb/>addition to the fulfilment of fundamental rights for women and girls, gender equality has <lb/>recently been hailed as a &apos;breakthrough&apos; strategy for promoting inclusive development and <lb/>reducing poverty. Understanding the nature and extent of the obstacles to gender equality is <lb/>therefore critical to designing effective policies to promote equality between men and women, <lb/>and consequently, to improving development outcomes. <lb/>Using the innovative OECD Development Centre&apos;s Social Institutions and Gender Index <lb/>(SIGI), this paper provides evidence of a vicious circle. Higher levels of discriminatory <lb/>institutions in origin countries hinder the likelihood of female migration, reducing the migrant <lb/>share in origin populations, which consequently is too low to positively shift discriminatory <lb/>norms towards greater gender equality. <lb/>Mario Pezzini <lb/>Director <lb/>OECD Development Centre <lb/>March 2015 <lb/>How do female migration and gender discrimination in social institutions mutually influence each other? <lb/>DEV/DOC(2015)1 <lb/>6 <lb/>© OECD 2015 <lb/>RESUMÉ <lb/>Cet article étudie l&apos;influence réciproque entre discriminations de genre au sein des <lb/>institutions sociales et migration. D&apos;un côté, le niveau de discrimination de genre dans les <lb/>institutions sociales du pays d&apos;origine et du pays d&apos;accueil influence significativement la <lb/>migration des femmes dans les pays du Sud. Ainsi les discriminations auxquelles les femmes <lb/>font faces dans les lois formelles et informelles, les normes sociales et pratiques coutumières dans <lb/>leurs pays d&apos;origine constituent un déterminant supplémentaire à la migration : lorsque les <lb/>discriminations dans les pays d&apos;origine sont trop fortes, elles entravent les opportunités de <lb/>migration des femmes et réduisent ainsi les flux migratoires Sud-Sud. En outre, le niveau de <lb/>discrimination dans les institutions sociales des pays d&apos;origine semblent aussi jouer un rôle <lb/>important, les femmes étant attirés par des pays ayant des niveaux de discrimination plus faibles <lb/>que dans leurs pays d&apos;origine. Ce type d&apos;inégalité n&apos;a pas d&apos;impact significatif sur les hommes, <lb/>suggérant que les facteurs de migration diffèrent entre les hommes et les femmes. <lb/>D&apos;autre part, la migration apparait comme un acteur de transmission des normes sociales. <lb/>En effet, les flux migratoires impliquent des changements culturels relatifs aux discriminations <lb/>basées sur le genre dans les pays d&apos;origine, en fonction du niveau de discrimination des pays de <lb/>destination. Alors que les flux migratoires vers des destinations à faibles niveaux de <lb/>discrimination favorisent l&apos;égalité de genre dans les pays d&apos;origine, ceux dirigés vers des <lb/>destinations ayant des niveaux de discriminations élevés renforcent les inégalités homme-femme <lb/>dans les institutions sociales. <lb/>Cet article utilise un indicateur novateur développé par le Centre de Développement de <lb/>l&apos;OCDE mesurant les inégalités de genre dans les institutions sociales d&apos;une centaine de pays : le <lb/>SIGI (Social Institutions and Gender Index). Ces résultats sont robustes aux changements de <lb/>spécifications et au contrôle des potentiels biais d&apos;endogéneité et de simultanéité. <lb/>Classification JEL: F22; O15; J16. <lb/>Mots-clés: Migration Sud-Sud, Inégalités de genre, Institutions Sociales. <lb/>OECD Development Centre Working Paper No.326 <lb/>DEV/DOC(2015)1 <lb/>© OECD 2015 <lb/>7 <lb/>ABSTRACT <lb/>Using the Social Institutions and Gender Index (SIGI) from the OECD Development <lb/>Centre, this paper provides evidence of the two-way relationship between gender inequality in <lb/>social institutions and South-South migration. Discriminatory social institutions in both origin <lb/>and destination countries are one additional determinant of female migration. Gender inequality <lb/>appears to be both a pull and a push factor for migrant women. On one hand, higher gender <lb/>discrimination at home reduces female emigration, since women&apos;s restricted opportunities and <lb/>low decision-power limit their possibility to move abroad. On the other hand, lower <lb/>discrimination in the destination country attracts female immigration. However, they have no <lb/>significant impact on male migration, suggesting that male and female incentives to migrate <lb/>differ. <lb/>In addition, migration appears to be a driver of cultural change regarding gender <lb/>inequality in opportunities, according to the level of discriminatory social institutions in the <lb/>destination country. Migration towards countries having low levels of discrimination promotes <lb/>gender equality in social institutions in the origin country, while migration towards countries <lb/>having high levels of discrimination has the reverse effect, whatever the gender of the migrant. <lb/>This paper contributes to a better understanding of why gender inequalities persist. These <lb/>results are robust to changes in specifications and controls for potential endogeneity and <lb/>simultaneity bias. <lb/>JEL Classification: F22; O15; J16. <lb/>Keywords: South-South migration, Gender inequality, Social institutions <lb/>How do female migration and gender discrimination in social institutions mutually influence each other? <lb/>DEV/DOC(2015)1 <lb/>8 <lb/>© OECD 2015 <lb/>I. INTRODUCTION <lb/>There is widespread consensus that gender equality is a prerequisite for development, <lb/>economic growth and poverty reduction. In recent decades, policy makers and researchers have <lb/>increasingly turned attention and resources to closing gender gaps on key economic and social <lb/>indicators. Discriminatory social institutions, defined as formal and informal laws, social norms <lb/>and practices that shape or restrict the decisions, choices and behaviours of women (Jütting et al., <lb/>2008), have gained prominence as a useful analytical framework to illuminate gender disparities. <lb/>In parallel to the increasing focus on gender equality in social norms, the even bigger question of <lb/>how to measure and shift them has come to the fore. <lb/>The OECD Development Centre investigated these issues by building a unique composite <lb/>index. The Social Institutions and Gender Index (SIGI) was the first attempt to measure <lb/>discriminatory social institutions, which reduce female access to opportunities, resources and <lb/>power (Cerise et al., 2012). Through its innovative focus on gender inequalities in opportunities, <lb/>the SIGI provides additional insights on the root causes of gender inequality (Ferrant et al., 2014). <lb/>Increasing attention on targeting discriminatory social norms and practices will not only <lb/>empower women and secure their fundamental human rights, but also contribute to economic <lb/>growth and development (Ferrant et al., 2015). <lb/>Since gender is a social construct, which organises relationships between women and <lb/>men, the causes, processes and impacts of migration on women and men can be considered as <lb/>different. Hence, studying migration from a gender perspective implies looking beyond the <lb/>differences in migration behaviour between men and women, such as the likelihood and type of <lb/>migration, and to examine further the inequalities underlying those differences. <lb/>While the literature focuses on the impact of gender discrimination in the workplace on <lb/>female migration (Kanaiaupuni, 2000; Baudassé and Bazillier, 2012), it neglects the key role of <lb/>discriminatory social institutions. By defining which decisions and behaviours are acceptable for <lb/>each gender, as well as restricting women&apos;s access to power and resources, discriminatory social <lb/>institutions affect migration decisions. Moreover, the relevance of international migration goes <lb/>well beyond the movement of people as migration also represents a powerful mechanism to <lb/>transmit ideas across borders. <lb/>Using the SIGI, this paper is the first attempt to investigate this two-way influence <lb/>between gender inequality in social institutions and migration. This exercise brings along a <lb/>threefold contribution. First, it highlights the gender differences in migration determinants. The <lb/>literature remains predominantly gender blind at cross-country level, assuming that migrants are <lb/>OECD Development Centre Working Paper No.326 <lb/>DEV/DOC(2015)1 <lb/>© OECD 2015 <lb/>9 <lb/>a homogeneous group having the same incentives to migrate. This paper provides evidence that <lb/>differentials in discriminatory social institutions between origin and destination countries only <lb/>influence female migration. Indeed, high discrimination in social institutions in the home <lb/>communities restricts female emigration and low discrimination in the destination countries <lb/>attracts female immigration, while they have no significant effect on men. <lb/>Second, this paper contributes to the migration literature on &quot; transfers of norms &quot; <lb/>(Spilimbergo, 2009; Lodigiani and Salomone, 2012; Beine et al., 2013; Bertoli and Marchetta, <lb/>2013). Migration may be a channel of norms transmission challenging gender inequality in social <lb/>institutions at home when moving towards countries with low levels of discrimination. It can <lb/>however reinforce discrimination when moving towards countries with high levels of <lb/>discrimination. <lb/>Finally, this paper contributes to the small literature exploring the neglected issue of <lb/>South-South migration (Gindling, 2009; Facchini et al., 2013). While Naghsh Nejad and Young <lb/>(2012) and Naghsh Nejad (2013) focus on institutionalised gender inequality in OECD countries, <lb/>this paper considers migration flows between developing regions. This is not only because <lb/>South-South migration represents more than 50% of migration stocks flows comparing to South-<lb/>North migration (Ratha and Shaw, 2007), but also because discriminatory social institutions in <lb/>non-OECD countries are different and more restrictive than those in place in high-income areas <lb/>(such as female genital mutilation, early marriage, inheritance laws). <lb/>To investigate the two-way influence between gender inequality in social institutions and <lb/>migration, several econometric strategies are performed. First, the empirical analysis adopts a <lb/>Heckman two-step procedure to deal with the high occurrence of null bilateral flows in <lb/>migration data and the selection process. Then, 2SLS estimators are used to overcome potential <lb/>endogeneities, due to reverse causality and unobservables. Finally, the simultaneous influence of <lb/>gender inequality on migration and vice versa is estimated using 3SLS estimators. <lb/>The paper is structured as follows: the second section presents the theoretical links <lb/>between gender inequality in social institutions and migration, and the third section the data. <lb/>The fourth section describes the empirical strategy and the fifth section the empirical results. <lb/>Finally, the last section concludes. <lb/>How do female migration and gender discrimination in social institutions mutually influence each other? <lb/>DEV/DOC(2015)1 <lb/>10 <lb/>© OECD 2015 <lb/>II. THE EXPECTED LINKAGES BETWEEN MIGRATION <lb/>AND GENDER INEQUALITY <lb/></body>

			<note place="footnote">II.1. Discriminatory social institutions: A driver of migration <lb/>Besides the economic reasons pushing men and women to migrate, such as the <lb/>differences between the country of origin and destination in terms of income, unemployment <lb/>rate, cost of living, etc., there is a variety of other determinants, including the education level of <lb/>migrants, their networks and migration policies, borders, as well as climate and religion factors <lb/>(Péridy, 2010). The migration literature has typically overlooked gender dynamics, assuming that <lb/>most women migrate only for family reunification reasons as wives, mothers or daughters of <lb/>male migrants (Zlotnik, 2003). However, the increasing magnitude of international migration in <lb/>the recent decades led to a growing focus on women as independent migrants (Grieco and Boyd, <lb/>1998; Cerrutti and Massey, 2001; Erulkar et al., 2006; Dumont et al., 2007; Docquier et al., 2009). <lb/>Looking at the non-economic determinants of female migration, previous studies differentiate <lb/>three broad categories of factors: individual factors including age, marital status, role and <lb/>position in the family, educational status and employment experience; family factors including <lb/>size, structure, status; and societal factors including the community norms and cultural values <lb/>that determine whether a woman can migrate or not and if she can, how and with whom she can <lb/>do it (Grieco and Boyd, 1998). <lb/></note>

			<body>The important role of gender inequality has been neglected by the literature. Few <lb/>exceptions have looked at gender inequality as a driver of female migration, with a particular <lb/>focus on discrimination in the workplace. Kanaiaupuni (2000) studies whether the determinants <lb/>of migration differ by sex, using Mexico-US data. She finds that high-skilled women are more <lb/>likely to migrate than high-skilled men or low and moderate skilled women. This may be <lb/>explained by higher gender discrimination faced by women and few occupational rewards in <lb/>their home country, and thus they benefit more than men from migrating internationally, <lb/>whether their skill level is high enough to allow them to meet the job demand. Recently, <lb/>Baudassé and Bazillier (2012) suggest that non-wage motivations for emigration include gender <lb/>equality in the workplace. They assume that poor working conditions in source countries may be <lb/>considered as a determinant of emigration. Therefore, when gender discrimination in the local <lb/>labour market decreases, women&apos;s incentives to migrate decrease as well. They show that higher <lb/>levels of discrimination in the workplace are correlated with higher levels of female emigration <lb/>and lower levels of male emigration, suggesting a substitution effect between men and women <lb/>within a given number of migrants. <lb/>OECD Development Centre Working Paper No.326 <lb/>DEV/DOC(2015)1 <lb/>© OECD 2015 <lb/>11 <lb/>However, women&apos;s decision to migrate and their choice of destination may be also <lb/>influenced by the discriminatory social institutions that impede their economic, political or social <lb/>expectations. Gender norms may also affect male migration by defining their role in the public <lb/>and private spheres. More specifically, discriminatory social institutions in origin countries may <lb/>influence women&apos;s decision to emigrate in two ways. On one hand, they can be an additional <lb/>determinant of emigration, stemming from women&apos;s need to escape gender-specific <lb/>discrimination. For example, women may migrate to escape sexual violence and abuse; single <lb/>women, widows and divorcees may migrate to escape social stigma; or girls may migrate to <lb/>escape restrictions on their freedom, pressure to marry, or to remain chaste until marriage (Jolly <lb/>and Reeves, 2005). There is evidence from South-East Asia of women migrating in order to <lb/>escape from involuntary marriages (Lam and Hoang, 2010). Another study in Ethiopia finds that <lb/>23% of migrant girls reported to have migrated in order to escape early marriage in their home <lb/>communities (Erulkar et al., 2006). The same mechanism is expected for men. Gender norms in <lb/>the household and society may push men to emigrate (Hofmann, 2010). For example, young men <lb/>may leave the country to escape being forced to become soldiers; migration may be also seen as a <lb/>rite of passage for young men (Jolly and Reeves, 2005). <lb/>On the other hand, gender inequality in social institutions may constraint the &quot; capability &quot; <lb/>itself for women to migrate. <lb/>1 For example, a girl who marries early is less likely to finish her <lb/>education, which limits her employment opportunities (Cerise et al., 2013), rendering her more <lb/>socially and financially dependent on her husband for a range of key factors, which include <lb/>migration possibilities. In the Republic of Moldova, women report having less opportunity to <lb/>migrate because of a lack of resources, which are generally more available to men (IOM, 2005). <lb/>As Jolly and Reeves (2005) note, &quot; it may be less acceptable for women to move about and travel <lb/>on their own &quot; . This negative correlation between discrimination in social institutions and male <lb/>emigration is not expected since patriarchal beliefs would be positively associated with <lb/>emigration for men (Hofmann, 2010). <lb/>These roles of discriminatory social institutions in migration processes have been totally <lb/>disregarded by the economic literature. Few sociological and qualitative studies, however, have <lb/>shed light on the relevance of gender norms in driving migration decisions. Diner (1983) is one of <lb/>the first attempts to include discriminatory social norms into the possible explanations of <lb/>women&apos;s international migration. Studying the Irish diaspora to the United States in the late <lb/>nineteenth century, she finds that most of the migrants were women in search for better <lb/>opportunities. Since the famine of those years made impossible for families to give dowry to each <lb/>daughter, marriage was only possible for one daughter. The unmarried sisters, then, had few <lb/>alternatives: employment opportunities in the countryside were scarce, and millions of young <lb/>Irish women migrated to seek fortune and family in America. A recent contribution by Hofmann <lb/>1 <lb/>As Sen (1999) has noted, economic factors are not the only determinants for human well-being and <lb/>choices: desire for individual freedoms and rights to be respected and expanded also govern individual <lb/>decision-making. Applying Sen&apos;s &quot; capabilities &quot; approach to female migration, it is interesting to <lb/>explore how women&apos;s freedom (or lack of freedom) to &quot; achieve outcomes that they value &quot; may <lb/>influence their decision to emigrate and their choice of destination. <lb/>How do female migration and gender discrimination in social institutions mutually influence each other? <lb/>DEV/DOC(2015)1 <lb/>12 <lb/>© OECD 2015 <lb/>and Buckley (2013) stresses the possible negative role of social norms in limiting migration <lb/>opportunities for women. The authors use individual interviews in Georgia to study the <lb/>feminisation of migration that is currently taking place. Most respondents described female <lb/>migration as &quot; unnatural, challenging the male role as breadwinner and female responsibilities <lb/>for childcare and elder-care. Female migration is a crucial serious sociocultural loss, depriving <lb/>individual families, and Georgian society as a whole, of women&apos;s natural contributions &quot; . <lb/>Likewise, gender and social norms in countries of destination can also inter-relate with <lb/>women&apos;s decision to immigrate to a particular country, since women may be attracted by lower <lb/>levels of discrimination. For example, in the 19th Century in the Dominican Republic, due to <lb/>social stigma attached to women working outside of the household, the husband preferred and <lb/>encouraged women to seek employment in the US, where it was deemed acceptable, even in the <lb/>Dominican diaspora (Grassmuck and Pessar, 1991). In addition to preferences for gender <lb/>equality, this attraction of lower discriminatory social institutions in the destination country may <lb/>also be explained by lower discrimination in its labour market reflected in greater working <lb/>opportunities for women (Martin, 2004). Mechanically, this is the reverse for men: when women <lb/>are less discriminated, for a given level of job opportunities, men are less favoured. The hiring <lb/>conditions are based on productivity instead of the gender of the job candidate. For a given level <lb/>of labour demand, this may affect negatively the male probability to be hired. Hence, except if <lb/>men have preferences for gender equality, higher discrimination in social institutions in <lb/>destination countries is expected to be positively correlated with male migration. <lb/>To summarise, while a positive effect of discriminatory social institutions in origin <lb/>countries on male emigration is expected, the sign of the linkage for women is still ambiguous. <lb/>Concerning the effect of gender discrimination in social institutions in host countries, a negative <lb/>effect for female immigration and a positive one for male migration are expected. Nonetheless, <lb/>the linkages between migration and gender inequality do not terminate here: migrants may be <lb/>agents of change for gender discrimination in social institutions. <lb/>II.2. Migration: A channel of norms transmission <lb/>The chains of causality are complex and difficult to establish, making the explanation of <lb/>gender inequality and its persistence challenging. The standard explanation focuses on economic <lb/>growth as a determinant of gender inequality (Forsythe et al., 2000). The positive effect of <lb/>economic growth is widely documented (see Dollar and Gatti (1999) and Ferrant (2015) among <lb/>others) although income growth by itself is not sufficient. Gender equality also depends on how <lb/>markets and formal/informal institutions have evolved, how growth has played out, and how all <lb/>these factors have interacted with household decisions (World Bank, 2012). Interestingly, Rees <lb/>and Riezman (2012) wonder whether globalisation may influence gender equality. Following this <lb/>intuition and the migration literature on &quot; transfers of norms &quot; , the paper assumes that beyond the <lb/>movement of people, migration involves norm exchanges. For example, Spilimbergo (2009) <lb/>describes how student migration towards democratic countries promotes democracy at home. In <lb/>addition, migrants can also bring back home stronger entrepreneurial attitude (Piracha and <lb/>Vadean, 2010; Demurger and Xu, 2011; Wahba and Zenou, 2012) or influence fertility decisions <lb/>OECD Development Centre Working Paper No.326 <lb/>DEV/DOC(2015)1 <lb/>© OECD 2015 <lb/>13 <lb/>(Beine et al., 2013; Bertoli and Marchetta, 2013). However, the role of migration as an agent of <lb/>change for gender discrimination has been neglected by the economic literature. <lb/>Few exceptions have looked at migration as a driver of women&apos;s empowerment. <lb/>Lodigiani and Salomone (2012) investigate the linkage between transfers of norms through <lb/>migration and women&apos;s political empowerment. Diaspora contributes to the propagation of <lb/>political and gender equality values when migrants become aware of the fact that female political <lb/>conditions at origin countries and their consequences on governance are worse than those <lb/>experienced at destination. Hence, international migration to countries with higher female <lb/>parliamentary shares significantly increases women&apos;s political empowerment in origin countries. <lb/>Concerning other aspects of women&apos;s empowerment, several studies at micro or regional <lb/>level have stressed the existence of possible channels of gender equality promotion through <lb/>migration. For example, Hadi (2001) explains that male migration has a significant positive effect <lb/>on women&apos;s empowerment. Changes in women&apos;s position are measured by three indicators: <lb/>women&apos;s decision-making capacity; girls&apos; education; and the practice of dowry. Findings show <lb/>that male out-migration not only raise the standard of living of their left-behind kin through the <lb/>injection of remittances, but also &quot; modify their social behaviour through the diffusion of secular <lb/>ideas into the traditional values of the sending communities. &quot; Moreover, Hadi (2001) also shows <lb/>that households with female migrant members are more concerned with the education of <lb/>daughters. In Uttar Pradesh Paris et al. (2005) shed light on the consequences of male migration <lb/>on gender roles in farming households. Interviewed women explain that the gender division of <lb/>labour shifted, since they now have to take over several male-specific activities. Moreover, wives <lb/>in migrant families state to have higher decision-making power, with the decision of how much <lb/>money to invest and what crops to grow lying in their hands. Similarly, evidence from Nicaragua <lb/>shows that fathers assume new gender roles when their spouses migrate, taking charge of the <lb/>housework and children (Avellan, 2003). <lb/>This paper contributes to the literature by assuming that South-South migration may <lb/>foster gender equality in social institutions in the home community through three channels. <lb/>Firstly, remittances and other benefits for the household and the community make the benefits of <lb/>female emigration more obvious, which in turn creates incentives to increase the women&apos;s ability <lb/>to migrate through improvement in women&apos;s access to opportunities, resources and power. For <lb/>example, women who send remittances gain more respect within their family and community <lb/>(Jolly and Reeves, 2005). Moreover, parents who rely on their daughters&apos; remittances are less <lb/>likely to force them to return home to marry (Temin et al., 2013)). Likewise, women gain financial <lb/>independence and increased decision-making power when they emigrate (Peleah, 2007). <lb/>Secondly, social remittances may translate in a shift in attitudes towards less <lb/>discriminatory practices. Specifically, social remittance exchanges occur when migrants return to <lb/>live in or visit their communities of origin, when non-migrants visit migrants abroad, or through <lb/>the exchange of e-mails, blog posts and telephone calls (Levitt, 1998). In this way, migrants carry <lb/>new ideas, practices and narratives which influence the social institutions and norms of their <lb/>origin countries. Levitt (1998) records testimonies of Dominican Republic women who migrated <lb/>How do female migration and gender discrimination in social institutions mutually influence each other? <lb/>DEV/DOC(2015)1 <lb/>14 <lb/>© OECD 2015 <lb/>to Boston and modified their ideas about gender roles in response to their more active <lb/>engagement in the workplace. They then transmitted these new norms to their home community <lb/>and non-migrant women used them to create new versions of womanhood. Women who migrate <lb/>tend to model their behaviour on women in destination countries, which proved to have positive <lb/>effects on reducing violence against women in Moldova for example, as women tolerate it less <lb/>from their partners (Peleah, 2007). <lb/>Lastly, international migrants can alter the power structure within the household. <lb/>Migration can challenge traditional gender roles when the absence of one spouse leaves the other <lb/>one with both greater decision-making power and burden of responsibility and labour (Jolly and <lb/>Reeves, 2005). In fact, in countries such as Mexico where men are far more likely migrating, left-<lb/>behind women often in-crease their decision-making power regarding daily-choices, since they <lb/>need to make decisions for the family while the head of the household is away (Antman, 2011). <lb/>This new position of the woman in the household may translate in greater access to public and <lb/>political spaces, lowering overall discriminatory social institutions within the country. In <lb/>addition, larger women&apos;s bargaining power creates a virtuous circle, since women are more <lb/>likely to spend resources on daughters than fathers would (Duflo, 2003). Similarly, another study <lb/>in Bangladesh finds that the emigration of men is positively associated with women&apos;s decision-<lb/>making capacity and the education of girls in migrant families (Hadi, 2001). Moreover, <lb/>remittances have also been linked to increased female agency within family structures and a <lb/>change in perceptions of gender roles. Women who receive remittances have more and better <lb/>control of resources (Jolly and Reeves, 2005). Economic remittances may also be used to give <lb/>women better access to health care, allow them to start their own business and keep girls in <lb/>education for longer (Antman, 2012). <lb/>In sum, migration may impact discriminatory social institutions. Since this effect implies <lb/>a transfer of norms from host to sending country, the sign of the correlation is expected to differ <lb/>according to the discrimination levels in destination countries. According to these expected links, <lb/>male and female migration may have the same effect on gender inequality at home, with a higher <lb/>effect of female migration due to the first channel of transmission. <lb/>OECD Development Centre Working Paper No.326 <lb/>DEV/DOC(2015)1 <lb/>© OECD 2015 <lb/>15 <lb/>III. DATA <lb/>III.1. Migration data <lb/>The United Nations Population Division of the Department of Economic and Social <lb/>Affairs (UNDESA) produces migration data which disaggregates international migrant stocks by <lb/>sex, origin and destination countries for the period 1990, 2000 and 2010. <lb/>2 To better capture <lb/>gender dynamics in international migration, the change in migrant stocks observed between 2000 <lb/>and 2010 is used as a measure for migration flows. More precisely, the net migration flows by sex <lb/>and country of origin in 2010 are used as dependent variable. To distinguish the effect of <lb/>discriminatory social institutions between female and male emigration, sub-samples are used. <lb/>Two main shortcomings of our migration data have to be acknowledged. Firstly, negative <lb/>migration flows are also computed. These declining stocks are due to the fact that migrants may <lb/>die, return to their home or even move to third countries. However, Beine et al. (2011) confirm <lb/>that this approach still gives a reasonable approximation of the dynamics of migrant flows. <lb/></body>

			<note place="footnote">Secondly, the UN database includes information only on legal migrants, leaving aside refugees, <lb/>displaced people and illegal migrants. It is worthy to note that due to lack of available data, it is <lb/>impossible to address illegal and involuntary migration at a macro level, although it may <lb/>represent a large share of South-South migration. If anything, our results would be downward <lb/>biased in magnitude, but there is no reason to believe that the sign of the relationship should be <lb/>opposite for illegal migrants. <lb/>III.2. The SIGI <lb/>The Social Institutions and Gender Index (SIGI) produced by the OECD Development <lb/>Centre measures discriminatory social institutions for non-OECD countries. 3 While other gender-<lb/>specific measures, such as the Global Gender Gap Index from the World Economic Forum or the <lb/>UNDP gender-related indices (GDI, GEM and GII), measure gender inequalities in outcomes, the <lb/>SIGI focuses on gender inequality in opportunities, seeking to capture the underlying causes of <lb/>discrimination (Ferrant, 2014). An alternative proxy of social institutions would be the CIRI <lb/>Human Rights Dataset (Cingranelli and Richards, 2010), which covers outcomes of these <lb/>institutions. However, it does not distinguish between the different dimensions of social <lb/>2 <lb/>See UNDESA (2013) for information on sources and construction.

In <lb/>addition, the SIGI is a more comprehensive measure considering other dimensions of gender <lb/>inequality in social institutions. It is a composite index which scores non-OECD countries on the <lb/>basis of 14 variables (Table 1). 4 The scale of the SIGI goes from 0, meaning low discrimination to <lb/>1, high level of discriminatory social institutions. <lb/>Table 1.

However, it may <lb/>still be a good measure of gender norms governing male behaviour and opportunities. In <lb/>countries where social institutions highly discriminate against women, gender norms are <lb/>strongly enforced.

Other data <lb/>Additional control variables include standard determinant of migration.

Ten-year averages are calculated also for <lb/>4 <lb/>For more details, see Branisa et al. (2013) Cerise et al.

A <lb/>measure of civil liberties is taken from the Freedom House&apos;s flagship publication &apos;2013 Freedom <lb/>in the World&apos; (Freedom House, 2013). The index has a 1 to 7 scale (with 1 representing the <lb/>highest and 7 the lowest level of freedom). For this variable, the 2010 value is taken, since civil <lb/>liberties achievement is a progressive and dynamic process measured by a categorical variable <lb/>that cannot be calculated with averages or sums. Time-invariant variables are obtained from the <lb/>CEPII&apos;s Gravity Dataset (Head et al., 2010): contiguity is a dummy variable being 1 if two <lb/>countries share a common border, common language is a dummy variable being 1 if a same <lb/>language is spoken by at least 9% of the population in each country, and distance is taken as the <lb/>bilateral distance between the two largest cities in the two countries, weighted by the share of <lb/>each city in the overall country&apos;s population. <lb/>Finally, the paper uses CEDAW (Convention on the Elimination of all forms of <lb/>Discrimination Against Women) date of ratification and religiosity as instrument for the level of <lb/>discriminatory social institutions. 7 The religiosity variable refers to the share of population self-<lb/>declared as practising actively a religion. This variable comes from the COW database. <lb/>7 <lb/>More precisely, the paper uses the difference between 2012 and the date of ratification to address <lb/>intensity issue. <lb/>How do female migration and gender discrimination in social institutions mutually influence each other? <lb/>DEV/DOC(2015)1 <lb/>18 <lb/>© OECD 2015 <lb/>IV. EMPIRICAL STRATEGY <lb/>Three empirical strategies are used to assess the two-way relationship between <lb/>discriminatory social institutions and migration. While equation (1) models the influence of <lb/>discriminatory social institutions on female/male migration, equation (2) estimates the <lb/>transmission role of migration regarding gender inequality in social institutions. Finally, the <lb/>system (3) assesses the two-way relationship and simultaneous influence of gender inequality <lb/>and migration. <lb/>IV.1. Influence of discriminatory social institutions on migration <lb/>A migration gravity model augmented by gender inequality <lb/>First, a standard migration gravity specification is used to estimate the influence of <lb/>discriminatory social institutions on female/male migration. The gravitational approach expects <lb/>migration to be negatively linked to distance and positively correlated with population of origin <lb/>and destination, income differential, language differential and contiguity (Lewer and Van den <lb/>Berg, 2008; Clark et al., 2007; Beine et al., 2011; Baudassé and Bazillier, 2012). Indeed, migration is <lb/>driven by a cost-advantages trade-off. Each migrant chooses to migrate where the costs are the <lb/>lowest. Having lower distance between origin and destination countries, common language and <lb/>border reduces the migration costs and increases the probability to move. Migration is also <lb/>driven by the maximisation of utility, meaning that the opportunity differential between sending <lb/>and receiving countries matters. <lb/>It is necessary to acknowledge some criticisms that the gravity approach raises in both the <lb/>trade and migration literature. Anderson and van Wincoop (2003) underline the lack of <lb/>theoretical foundations of gravitational models. In fact, the theory states that the more a country <lb/>is resistant to trade with all others, the more it is pushed to trade with a given bilateral partner <lb/>(Anderson, 1979). The main implication is that flows between two countries is determined by <lb/>relative trade barriers, otherwise said bilateral flows depend on the bilateral barrier between the <lb/>two countries relative to the average trade barriers that both face with the rest of the world. <lb/>According to the authors, the empirical literature does not consider this &quot; multilateral resistance &quot; . <lb/>As a consequence, empirical results may carry bias due to omitted variables, making impossible <lb/>the comparison of different situations. A similar approach has been recently applied by Bertoli <lb/>and Fernandez-Huertas Moraga (2012) to migration, leading to the development of the notion of <lb/> &quot; multilateral resistance to migration &quot; . In fact, bilateral migration flows do not depend only on <lb/>the attractiveness of the destination country, but also on how this relates to the opportunities to <lb/>move to other destinations. Studying the determinants of bilateral migration flows to Spain <lb/>OECD Development Centre Working Paper No.326 <lb/>DEV/DOC(2015)1 <lb/>© OECD 2015 <lb/>19 <lb/>between 1997 and 2009, the authors find that ignoring the multilateral resistance to migration <lb/>biases the estimation. For example, the effect of GDP at origin is two thirds of that found when <lb/>multilateral resistance to migration is not accounted. <lb/>Despite the critics, the gravity equation proved to be one of the most stable relationship in <lb/>economics (Chaney, 2013), and it is indeed useful in our empirical attempt of better understand <lb/>the linkages between gender inequality and female/male migration. Thus the basic gravity <lb/>framework is augmented by adding gender inequality in social institutions using the SIGI. <lb/>In addition to the standard determinants of migration (GDP per capita in origin country, <lb/>distance, contiguity, population of origin and destination countries, income and language <lb/>differentials), our main specification includes female (male) education. Having access to <lb/>education in the country of origin enhances the likelihood of migration (González-Ferrer et al., <lb/>2013; Borjas, 1989) by reducing migration costs (Dustmann, 2011). To take into account the key <lb/>role of working opportunities for women (men) in both origin and destination countries, female <lb/>(male) unemployment rates are added. Labour is one of the main reasons of migration (Grieco <lb/>and Boyd, 1998). Hence, working opportunities in the destination country are an important <lb/>factor of migration. However, income differentials are not enough to understand the female <lb/>(male) situation in a given labour market and to capture the complex process of gendered <lb/>migration. Including unemployment rate by sex therefore controls for gender discrimination in <lb/>the workplace. Moreover, a measure of networks in the destination country is included to deal <lb/>with family reunification factors and diaspora effects. The role of peers is important since men <lb/>and women from the same country of origin tend to migrate to the same destination country. <lb/>This makes migration easier, as word-of-mouth communication helps to spread information <lb/>about countries of destination: the bigger the diaspora, the smaller the psychological and <lb/>integration cost of migration (Munshi, 2003). Various measures of networks are used: the stock of <lb/>female (male) and total migrant in 2000. Finally, to control for family reunification, male (female) <lb/>emigration flows in 2010 are included. <lb/>The impact of discriminatory social institutions on female and male migration, <lb/>respectively, is estimated using the following equation: 8 <lb/>í µí± í µí±,í µí± = ∝ 0 +∝ 1 í µí±í µí°¼í µí°ºí µí°¼ í µí± +∝ 2 í µí±í µí°¼í µí°ºí µí°¼ í µí± +∝ 3 í µí² í µí±,í µí± + í µí¼ í µí±,í µí± (1) <lb/>where mi,j is the log of net female (male) migration flows between origin country i and <lb/>destination country j, SIGI is the log of the Social Institutions and Gender Index, 9 xi,j the control <lb/>variables and εi,j the error term. Control variables include GDP per capita in origin country, <lb/>8 <lb/>All variables are expressed in logarithm <lb/>9 <lb/>It is worthy to note than instead of using the log of the SIGI differential between the origin and the <lb/>destination countries, the paper includes the two separately. This allows us to interpret the effect of <lb/>social institutions in the origin country for a given level of discrimination in the destination one, and <lb/>vice-versa. However, it does not exclude the interpretation of the differential since ln ( <lb/>í µí±í µí°¼í µí°ºí µí°¼ í µí± <lb/>í µí±í µí°¼í µí°ºí µí°¼ í µí± <lb/>) = í µí±í µí°¼í µí°ºí µí°¼ í µí± − <lb/>í µí±í µí°¼í µí°ºí µí°¼ í µí± looking at the absolute and relative effect is critical for policy recommendations. <lb/>How do female migration and gender discrimination in social institutions mutually influence each other? <lb/>DEV/DOC(2015)1 <lb/>20 <lb/>© OECD 2015 <lb/>distance and contiguity between country i and j, population of countries i and j, income and <lb/>language differentials, female (male) education, female (male) unemployment rates in countries i <lb/>and j, male (female) emigration flows in 2010, migrant network and regional dummies. <lb/>As a second step to understand which dimension of discriminatory social institutions is <lb/>driving the results, equation (1) is estimated using each sub-index of the SIGI instead of the <lb/>overall SIGI. This allows us to explore which dimensions have the greatest impact on female <lb/>emigration. <lb/>Empirical issues <lb/>Nevertheless, two econometric challenges arise in estimating equation (1). First, bilateral <lb/>migration data present a high occurrence of zero values, which may bias our estimations. <lb/>Second, our gender inequality variable may be correlated with the error term, due to potential <lb/>reverse causality, since gender inequality may be a determinant of international migration but at <lb/>the same time migrants may shift gender attitudes in their origin countries. In addition, <lb/>unobservable characteristics can affect both SIGI and female migration flows, leading to biased <lb/>estimates. In order to address these econometric issues, the paper initially abstracts from the bias <lb/>induced by the log linearization of gravity models, 10 using OLS. It then introduces a Heckman <lb/>two-step procedure in order to account for the high occurrence of null migration flows. Finally, <lb/>an instrumental variable approach is taken to address the potential endogeneity. <lb/>The high occurrence of null migration flows <lb/>It is worthy indicating that migration is very unlikely to occur among all country pairs. <lb/>Therefore, our sample is characterised by a high occurrence of zero (approximately 75% of our <lb/>South-South female sample). 11 This incidence of zero requires the use of a particular estimation <lb/>strategy. While standard gravity models estimate a log-specification using OLS, this approach is <lb/>limited since it forces to either exclude null migration flows from the estimates or to transform <lb/>them by taking the log of the migration flows plus 1. Moreover, Santos-Silva and Tenreyro (2006) <lb/>show the inconsistency of OLS estimates if the variance of the error term í µí¼ í µí±,í µí± depends on the <lb/>covariates in equation (1). <lb/>An alternative to generate consistent estimates even in cases of over-dispersion is the use <lb/>of a Poisson regression model that relies on pseudo maximum likelihood estimates. However, <lb/>the Poisson solution is nevertheless unfeasible for the selection analysis, while Baudassé and <lb/>Bazillier (2012) provide evidence regarding the key role of gender inequality in the selection <lb/>process of migrants. As previously noted, the authors assume two theoretical hypotheses with <lb/>respect to the linkages between emigration and gender inequality. First, they consider gender <lb/>10 <lb/>More precisely, the paper focuses on positive flows (96% of our observations) and adds 1 before to take <lb/>their log. <lb/>11 <lb/>Our sample contains 96 developing countries. Hence, 9 120 female emigration flows are observed but <lb/>only 2 280 are positive. <lb/>OECD Development Centre Working Paper No.326 <lb/>DEV/DOC(2015)1 <lb/>© OECD 2015 <lb/>21 <lb/>inequality as a push factor for female emigration. Second, they assume that gender inequality <lb/>leads to a gender bias in a selection of migrants. Estimating by a Heckman two-step procedure, <lb/>their results validate the second hypotheses rather than the first one. <lb/>Following Beine et al. (2011) and Baudassé and Bazillier (2012), a Heckman two-step <lb/>procedure is used. This technique has the advantages to explicitly account for a potential <lb/>selection bias and to generate consistent estimates even in cases of high zero occurrence. 12 <lb/>Commonly used in presence of potential selection bias, the Heckman technique involves two <lb/>steps: the first step assesses the probability of observing female (male) migrants between two <lb/>given countries using a Probit estimator and an exclusion variable, while the second step <lb/>quantifies the size of those migrating. Following Beine et al. (2011) and Baudassé and Bazillier <lb/>(2012), diplomatic representation is used as exclusion variable in the selection equation. In fact, <lb/>having a diplomatic exchange with a foreign country may reduce migration costs linked to the <lb/>initial issuing of visas, increasing the probability to have positive emigration flows, but not the <lb/>size of these emigration flows. <lb/>Reverse causality and unobservable characteristics <lb/>A typical puzzle of migration studies is due to endogeneity problems. For instance, in <lb/>presence of reverse causality, estimations could be biased, since gender inequality in social <lb/>institutions may be a determinant of female (male) migration, but conversely female (male) <lb/>migration flows may also affect gender inequality in origin countries, due to a stream of new <lb/>social norms, a change in the household bargaining power, and so forth. Similarly, results could <lb/>be biased by the presence of omitted variables and especially unobservable country <lb/>characteristics that affect both the probability of having female emigrants and the level of <lb/>discriminatory social institutions in a country. These endogeneity issues result in biased OLS <lb/>estimates, since covariates are correlated with the error termí µí¼ í µí±,í µí± . <lb/>In order to allow consistent estimation, an instrumental variable approach is applied. A <lb/>good instrument may still lead to consistent parameter estimates. In order to be valid, <lb/>instruments must be uncorrelated with the error term in the explanatory equation and have no <lb/>direct effect on female (male) migration. To be relevant, the instrument must be correlated with <lb/>the endogenous independent variables, that is the SIGI. Previous studies on gender inequality <lb/>rarely shed light on the possibility of endogeneity issues and the validity of the instruments to <lb/>solve them. A prominent exception is represented by Dollar and Gatti (1999), who instrument <lb/>gender inequality in a growth equation by religious affiliation and civil liberties. However, some <lb/>doubts have been raised by the literature regarding the exogeneity of religion and civil liberties. <lb/>Following Ferrant (2015), the CEDAW ratification date is used as instrumental variable <lb/>for discriminatory social institutions and controls for religiosity and civil liberties are added. <lb/>Indeed, the CEDAW ratification date can be considered as a public commitment and recognition <lb/>12 <lb/>Moreover, Beine and Docquier (2009) claim that the two estimation strategies, that is Heckman and <lb/>Poisson, provide similar results and are equivalent. <lb/>How do female migration and gender discrimination in social institutions mutually influence each other? <lb/>DEV/DOC(2015)1 <lb/>22 <lb/>© OECD 2015 <lb/>of gender equality as a human right. Ratification implies recognition of the legitimacy of <lb/>reducing gender inequality. It leads to changes in government behaviour toward gender <lb/>inequality in social institutions and, for example, to changes in law regarding women and <lb/>discrimination, to implementation of incentives in order to promote law enforcement or <lb/>punishments. CEDAW can be a powerful tool for change when legislative and other measures to <lb/>protect women&apos;s rights are undertaken once states ratify CEDAW. For example, Bangladesh now <lb/>prohibits sexual harassment, thanks to a milestone decision issued in 2009 by the High Court. <lb/>Thanks to a training manual titled &quot; CEDAW Made Easy &quot; , empowering traditional leaders in <lb/>Cameroon to use the Convention to bring about concrete improvements in the lives of women in <lb/>their communities, they are changing traditional practices that are harmful to women. The <lb/>CEDAW denounced the prevalence of early marriage in several countries, some of which have <lb/>thus changed their legal age of marriage, which in turn has reduced the prevalence of such <lb/>practices: the average prevalence of early marriage across developing countries has decreased <lb/>from 21% in 2009 to 17% in 2012 (Cerise et al., 2012). <lb/>Good instruments often come from policy changes and an earlier date of ratification can <lb/>be assumed to be linked with a greater and deeper attention to gender equality within a country. <lb/>This paper considers the CEDAW ratification date as good predictor of the level of <lb/>discriminatory social institutions. However, it assumes that this date has no effect on female <lb/>(male) migration. Then, the exogeneity of female (male) migration flows per capita is rejected by <lb/>the Wu-Hausman test at the 5% level. 13 Finally, the validity (i.e. Cov(CEDAW, í µí¼ í µí±,í µí± ) = 0) and the <lb/>relevance (i.e. Cov(CEDAW, SIGI) ≠ 0) of this instrument are tested. This instrument is <lb/>significantly correlated with the endogenous variable, as indicated by the first step of the IV <lb/>estimations (Table 2). Moreover, simple estimation of the SIGI including additional controls and <lb/>instruments result in a relatively high partial R. Finally, the paper checks that instrumental <lb/>regressions are not null with F-statistic higher than 0.10, suggested by the rule of thumb (Stock <lb/>and Yogo, 2002). Even if the exogeneity of the instrument is hard to test, performing female <lb/>(male) emigration regressions do not provide evidence of correlation between error term and the <lb/>instrument. Indeed, the null hypothesis that the CEDAW coefficient is equal to zero when the <lb/>residuals are regressed is not rejected. <lb/>IV.2. Influence of migration on gender inequality in social institutions <lb/>In this second model, the effect of migration on gender inequality in opportunities is <lb/>estimated. The paper assumes that migration is a channel of idea transmission and may impact <lb/>the level of gender inequality in social institutions in origin countries. While migration flows <lb/>could capture size effect, the share of migrants in total population is used to measure migrants&apos; <lb/>influence on discriminatory social norms, excluding population size effects. Whatever the <lb/>direction of this influence, larger shares of migrants are correlated with greater probabilities to <lb/>transmit new ideas. <lb/>13 <lb/>The Durbin-Wu-Hausman score has a p.value of 0.028 and 0.023 for women and men, respectively. <lb/>OECD Development Centre Working Paper No.326 <lb/>DEV/DOC(2015)1 <lb/>© OECD 2015 <lb/>23 <lb/>However, using shares allows taking into account only the weight of migrants in a given <lb/>country. Unfortunately, the &quot; quality &quot; of migrants is not captured. Yet, according to his/her social <lb/>position, a migrant could affect differently social norms. For example, it would be expected that a <lb/>male tribal chief would have higher impact on social institutions, due to his leadership, implying <lb/>higher potential transmission power. This assumption is consistent with our previous example in <lb/>Cameroon, where traditional leaders are an agent of change regarding gender equality. Rather <lb/>than distinguishing social position, female and male migrants are distinguished. According to <lb/>the theoretical links, the female migration effect is expected to be higher. Finally, the paper <lb/>divides migrant shares by level of discriminatory social institutions in destination countries. In <lb/>fact migrants learn those social norms in place at destination, leading to heterogeneous effects <lb/>according to the area where the migrant moves. For instance, Beine et al. (2013) demonstrate that <lb/>returnee migrants are more likely to have fewer children than non-migrant households if they <lb/>migrated towards lower-fertility destinations, whilst Bertoli and Marchetta (2013) find opposite <lb/>results when looking at returnees from Egypt who have worked in high-fertility Arab countries. <lb/>The following equation is then estimated, where the SIGI in origin countries is the <lb/>dependent variable: <lb/>í µí±í µí°¼í µí°ºí µí°¼ í µí± = í µí»½ 0 + í µí»½ 1 í µí± í µí±,í µí±¡ + í µí»½ 2 í µí² í µí± + í µí¼ í µí± (2) <lb/>The interest variable í µí± í µí±,í µí±¡ is alternatively the share of total, female and male migrants in <lb/>the total population in 2010. The set of additional controls í µí² í µí± includes GDP per capita (in log), <lb/>share of population self-declared as religious practising, CEDAW date of ratification, female <lb/>education and level of civil liberties. Finally í µí¼ í µí± is the error term. <lb/>The inclusion of these controls is justified by the gender literature. The income growth is <lb/>expected to reduce gender inequality by loosening constraints, improving market opportunities, <lb/>promoting market mechanisms, increasing household available resources and so on (See Dollar <lb/>and Gatti, 1999; Forsythe et al., 2000; World Bank, 2012; Ferrant, 2013 among others). Religious <lb/>affiliation and civil liberties are included following Dollar and Gatti (1999). They show that, to a <lb/>large extent, gender inequality can be explained by religious preference and underlying <lb/>characteristics of societies, such as the extent of civil liberties. The self-declared religious practice <lb/>is used here, without distinguishing religion. The paper assumes that higher share of population <lb/>declared as practising a religion higher traditional gender roles are enforced leading to higher <lb/>discriminatory social institutions, whatever the religion concerned. On the other hand, high <lb/>restriction on civil liberties is correlated with high discrimination on women. Moreover, as <lb/>previously mentioned, an earlier ratification of the CEDAW is expected to be positively <lb/>correlated with gender equality. Finally, greater access to education constitutes a way to move <lb/>away from gender discrimination. <lb/>As shown in the previous model, gender inequality in origin countries is a factor <lb/>explaining female migration flows. Hence, looking at the effect of migration on gender inequality <lb/>raises endogeneity issues. In addition, omitted variables could have an impact on both the <lb/>dependent and the interest variables. For example, a development programme implemented by <lb/>an international organisation in order to develop female employment would reduce both gender <lb/>How do female migration and gender discrimination in social institutions mutually influence each other? <lb/>DEV/DOC(2015)1 <lb/>24 <lb/>© OECD 2015 <lb/>inequality and female migration. Firstly, higher job opportunities for women lead to lower <lb/>gender gaps in education. Secondly, if women have more job opportunities at home, they have <lb/>less incentive to migrate for labour reasons. To tackle endogeneity issues, the paper follows <lb/>McKenzie and Rapoport (2011) by instrumenting the migrant share in 2010 with historical <lb/>migration flows (specifically, migrant share in 2000). 14 While previous migration flows could <lb/>affect current ones through network effects or persistence of incentives to migrate, it has no effect <lb/>on the level of current discriminatory norms, except through the current migration share or the <lb/>previous levels of discrimination in the SIGI. The instrumental strategy assumes that the <lb/>instrument is valid (i.e. Cov(Mi,t−1, í µí¼ í µí± ) = 0) and relevant (i.e. Cov(Mi,t−1, Mi,t) ≠ 0). This instrument is <lb/>significantly correlated with the endogenous variable, as indicated by the first step of the IV <lb/>estimations and F-statistics are higher than 0.10 (Tables (6) and (8)). The exogeneity is rejected for <lb/>all dependent variables at 5%. <lb/>IV.3. The two-way relationship between gender inequality and migration <lb/>In a last step, feedback is tested. The paper assesses the two-way relationship between <lb/>migration and gender inequality by dealing with the simultaneous determination of gendered <lb/>migration flows and level of discriminatory social institutions. Econometrically, this simultaneity <lb/>issue implies correlation between error terms εi,j and µi that could be taken into account using a <lb/>3SLS estimator. The system (3) includes equations (1) and (2), where all model parameters are <lb/>jointly estimated. <lb/>{ <lb/>í µí± í µí±,í µí± = ∝ 0 +∝ 1 í µí±í µí°¼í µí°ºí µí°¼ í µí± +∝ 2 í µí±í µí°¼í µí°ºí µí°¼ í µí± +∝ 3 í µí² í µí±,í µí± + í µí¼ í µí±,í µí± <lb/>í µí±í µí°¼í µí°ºí µí°¼ í µí± = í µí»½ 0 + í µí»½ 1 í µí± í µí±,í µí±¡ + í µí»½ 2 í µí² í µí± + í µí¼ í µí± <lb/>(3) <lb/>14 <lb/>More precisely, an IV and IV-probit estimation are performed, in order to assess the probability to have <lb/>positive female / male flows between two given countries, controlling for potential endogeneities. The <lb/>use of an IV-probit model is preferred, both because it solves the problem of the high occurrence of <lb/>zeros, and because it is coherent with the Heckman results. <lb/>OECD Development Centre Working Paper No.326 <lb/>DEV/DOC(2015)1 <lb/>© OECD 2015 <lb/>25 <lb/>V. EMPIRICAL RESULTS <lb/>V.1. Influence of discriminatory social institutions on migration <lb/>First, let us focus on female migration flows. Tables 2 and 3 present the estimated effect of <lb/>SIGI in both origin and destination countries on female migration flows. The OLS estimates are <lb/>provided in Table 2 column (1), Table 2 columns (2) and (3) report the estimates using the two-<lb/>step Heckman approach and Table 3 those using instrumental variable. <lb/>In most of our specifications, control variables are significant and with the expected sign. <lb/>Income differential results positive, representing the economic attractiveness of the foreign <lb/>economy. Populations in both origin and destination countries have positive signs, in accordance <lb/>with the gravitational forces of demographic pressure. Conversely, the distance between the two <lb/>countries is negatively correlated with migration flows, due to increasing migration costs. Both <lb/>geographical (i.e. contiguity) and cultural (i.e. common language) proximity have the expected <lb/>positive sign, since migrants tend to move in countries that are closer to their homes and where <lb/>they can easily communicate. Women&apos;s years of education has a significant effect confirming that <lb/>being educated increases the probability to migrate. <lb/>15 Unemployment rates in origin and <lb/>destination countries are statistically significant suggesting that differentials in job opportunities <lb/>matters. 16 It is worthy to note the significance of the exclusion variable in the Heckman <lb/>procedure, namely diplomatic exchange. The positive sign indicates that the presence of a <lb/>diplomatic representation in a foreign country is often seen as prerequisite for engaging in legal <lb/>cross-border migration: the probability of having female migrants increases by 26% in presence <lb/>of diplomatic exchange. Male migration flows in 2010 are positively correlated with female <lb/>flows. The interpretation is twofold. First, this can be related to family reunification and <lb/>dependent migration: women and men migrate from the same country towards the same <lb/>destination in the same decade due to family relationship. Second, it may capture network <lb/>effects. As male peers have already migrated towards this destination, female migration flows <lb/>are higher. <lb/>15 <lb/>NB: only for the IV estimates. <lb/>16 <lb/>NB: except for the Heckman estimates. <lb/>How do female migration and gender discrimination in social institutions mutually influence each other? <lb/>DEV/DOC(2015)1 <lb/>26 <lb/>© OECD 2015 <lb/>Table 2.

Standard errors are in parentheses. <lb/>The impact of the discriminatory social institutions in both origin and destination <lb/>countries on female migration is significant and negative in all specifications. It suggests that <lb/>higher discrimination is related to lower female emigration. Gender inequality appears to be <lb/>both a pull and a push factor for migrant women. On one hand, higher gender discrimination at <lb/>OECD Development Centre Working Paper No.326 <lb/>DEV/DOC(2015)1 <lb/>© OECD 2015 <lb/>27 <lb/>home reduces female emigration, since women&apos;s restricted opportunities and low decision-<lb/>power limit their possibility to move abroad. On the other hand, lower discrimination in the <lb/>destination country attracts female immigration. <lb/>Interestingly, using a Heckman two-step procedure gives more details on this <lb/>relationship. 17 In Table 2, estimated effects of discriminatory social institutions on the probability <lb/>to have female migration flows between two countries (column (3)) and the magnitude of these <lb/>flows (column (2)) are presented. While the levels of SIGI in origin and destination countries <lb/>have no significant impact on the extent of female migration flows, they exhibit negative and <lb/>significant coefficients in the selection equation. These results suggest that gender inequality in <lb/>social institutions only affects the probability to migrate. Discrimination against women in both <lb/>origin and destination countries plays a key role in the selection process of migrant, which is <lb/>consistent with previous findings (Baudassé and Bazillier, 2012). <lb/>Table 3.

Standard errors are in parentheses. <lb/>Finally, several checks are performed in order to test the robustness of our findings <lb/>(Table 4). First, migration networks are included in the specification (row (2)) since it reduces the <lb/>cost of migration. Then, the differential in government expenditure is added to take into account <lb/>the effect of social allowance and public services provision on migration (row (3)). Finally, a <lb/>conflict variable in origin countries (row (4)) and the level of civil liberties at home (row (5)) are <lb/>included to control for the effect of political situation on migration dynamics (Péridy, 2010). In all <lb/>these cases, even including all these variables, the results maintain their statistical significance. <lb/>Regarding male migration, the impact of gender inequality in social institutions is not <lb/>significant whatever the estimators used (Table A.3 in Appendix). It suggests that male <lb/>migration is not sensitive to the level of discrimination in the origin countries, neither in the <lb/>destination. The interpretation is twofold: i) men&apos;s decision to migrate is not related to the level <lb/>of gender discrimination in social institutions; or ii) the SIGI is not able to capture social pressure <lb/>on male behaviour and choices. This finding highlights that male and female incentives to <lb/>migrate differ, suggesting gender-sensitive migration factors. <lb/>OECD Development Centre Working Paper No.326 <lb/>DEV/DOC(2015)1 <lb/>© OECD 2015 <lb/>29 <lb/>Table 4.

In particular, while discriminatory family code confirms our previous results on the <lb/>negative relationship between gender inequality and female migration in the selection equation, <lb/>restricted civil liberties exhibit a positive effect.

It is worthy to note that both sub-indices have a significant <lb/>and negative effect on the extent of female migration, meaning that high levels of discriminatory <lb/>social norms in the family and in the public space reduce not only the probability to have female <lb/>migration but also the size of those women who get to migrate. <lb/>Table 5.

Influence of migration on gender inequality in social institutions <lb/>Table 6 presents the estimated effects of migration on gender inequality in social <lb/>institutions (OLS estimates in columns (1)-(3), 2SLS estimates in columns (4)-(6)), while Table 7 <lb/>presents the heterogeneous effect by levels of discrimination in the destination country. <lb/>Control variables exhibit the expected signs. For example, the higher the GDP per capita <lb/>and female education, the lower the gender inequality. Moreover, countries having ratified the <lb/>CEDAW earlier have lower SIGI scores that are lower discriminatory social institutions. The level <lb/>of civil liberties is quite related to the level of gender inequality in social institutions. Countries <lb/>where civil liberties are restricted are also those where discriminatory social institutions are high, <lb/>while religiosity does not seem to have significant impact. <lb/>Let us initially focus on the average transmission role of migrant: larger shares in total <lb/>population promote gender equality in social institutions, whatever the gender of the migrant. <lb/>However, following our theoretical expectation, the female migration effect is significantly <lb/>higher. 19 <lb/></body>

CONCLUSION <lb/>Migration is a complex field of research that requires greater attention to the particular <lb/>gender dynamics of social institutions. This paper assesses the two-way linkages between <lb/>gendered migration and discriminatory social norms, leading to relevant findings on the <lb/>interaction between social institutions, gender and South-South migration. <lb/>On one side, estimates show that discrimination against women in social institutions in <lb/>both origin and destination countries plays a key role in the selection process of migrants. While <lb/>gender inequality in social norms constrains female emigration, it has no effect on male <lb/>emigration, suggesting that men and women&apos;s incentives to migrate differ. Hence, although the <lb/>broader structural causes of emigration appear to be gender-neutral, the role of gender inequality <lb/>in social institutions is not. In addition to standard determinants, discriminatory social <lb/>institutions influence female migration patterns. This is critical in order to understand the role of <lb/>social institutions in female decision-making. By limiting their access to opportunities, resources <lb/>and power, discriminatory social institutions restrict women&apos;s capabilities to achieve their <lb/>migration wishes. In particular, discrimination within the family and restricted civil liberties <lb/>drive our findings. <lb/>On the other side, migrants are agent of change by influencing gender relations. In <lb/>particular, migration may either entrench gender inequality in social institutions or challenge <lb/>them, according to the level of discriminatory social institutions in the host country. While larger <lb/>shares of migrants towards low or moderate discriminatory countries are linked to greater <lb/>gender equality in social institutions in home communities, migration towards high <lb/>discriminatory destinations has the reverse impact. Both men and women are agent of change, <lb/>although the effect of female migrants is significantly higher. <lb/>Interconnecting the two directions of the relationship emphasises the existence of a <lb/>circular pattern: high gender inequality in social institutions at origin constraints female <lb/>migration, but at the same time the share of female migrants is too low to positively shift <lb/>discriminatory norms towards greater gender equality. <lb/>However, drawbacks limited our research. In particular, sex-disaggregated data on <lb/>international migration is still scarce and seldom collected, with short time coverage. Similarly, <lb/>gender inequality in social institutions has started to be measured only recently, not allowing for <lb/>a panel data analysis: the SIGI is only available for one year limiting our empirical study to a <lb/>cross-country analysis. Although these results are robust to specifications changes and controls <lb/>for potential endogeneities and simultaneities, the interpretation of this data-driven analysis <lb/>OECD Development Centre Working Paper No.326 <lb/>DEV/DOC(2015)1 <lb/>© OECD 2015 <lb/>35 <lb/>should be cautious concerning its causality. Since it is not possible to control for year and country <lb/>specific effects, findings may be partly due to omitted variables. Finally, at the micro level, more <lb/>research is required in order to collect data on immigrants and return migrants to allow for an <lb/>estimation of the spillovers on family structures in origin countries. Nevertheless, this paper is a <lb/>first contribution to the literature highlighting the bidirectional nature of the migration-gender <lb/>nexus and the importance of discriminatory social institutions. <lb/>How do female migration and gender discrimination in social institutions mutually influence each other? <lb/>DEV/DOC(2015)1 <lb/>36 <lb/>© OECD 2015 <lb/>APPENDIX <lb/>Table A.1: SIGI 2012 ranking <lb/>Country <lb/>SIGI Value <lb/>2012 <lb/>Country <lb/>SIGI Value <lb/>2012 <lb/>Country <lb/>SIGI Value <lb/>2012 <lb/>Argentina <lb/>0.0069 Madagascar <lb/>0.1672 <lb/>Iraq <lb/>0.3184 <lb/>Costa Rica <lb/>0.0219 Haiti <lb/>0.1693 <lb/>Georgia <lb/>0.3382 <lb/>Paraguay <lb/>0.0642 Indonesia <lb/>0.1742 <lb/>Cote d&apos;Ivoire <lb/>0.3397 <lb/>South Africa <lb/>0.1028 Kyrgyzstan <lb/>0.1756 <lb/>Liberia <lb/>0.3440 <lb/>FYR of Macedonia <lb/>0.1041 Jamaica <lb/>0.2070 <lb/>Bangladesh <lb/>0.3523 <lb/>Cuba <lb/>0.1057 Guatemala <lb/>0.2119 <lb/>Ethiopia <lb/>0.3534 <lb/>Trinidad and Tobago <lb/>0.1064 Nepal <lb/>0.2154 <lb/>Egypt. <lb/>0.3579 <lb/>Brazil <lb/>0.1085 Nicaragua <lb/>0.2165 <lb/>Sierra Leone <lb/>0.3605 <lb/>Dominican Republic <lb/>0.1110 Malawi <lb/>0.2171 <lb/>Togo <lb/>0.3608 <lb/>El Salvador <lb/>0.1149 Mozambique <lb/>0.2194 <lb/>Azerbaijan <lb/>0.3621 <lb/>Serbia <lb/>0.1175 Tajikistan <lb/>0.2235 <lb/>Afghanistan <lb/>0.3634 <lb/>Philippines <lb/>0.1193 Senegal <lb/>0.2307 <lb/>Burkina Faso <lb/>0.3687 <lb/>Cambodia <lb/>0.1205 China (P Rep. of) <lb/>0.2388 <lb/>Cameroon <lb/>0.3696 <lb/>Kazakhstan <lb/>0.1212 Viet Nam <lb/>0.2387 <lb/>Niger <lb/>0.3720 <lb/>Venezuela <lb/>0.1250 Myanmar <lb/>0.2403 <lb/>Uganda <lb/>0.3838 <lb/>Belarus <lb/>0.1251 Guinea-Bissau <lb/>0.2435 <lb/>Swaziland <lb/>0.3915 <lb/>Morocco <lb/>0.1262 Kenya <lb/>0.2479 <lb/>Syrian Arab Republic <lb/>0.3928 <lb/>Ecuador <lb/>0.1307 Tanzania <lb/>0.2518 <lb/>Gambia <lb/>0.3933 <lb/>Honduras <lb/>0.1307 Mauritania <lb/>0.2539 <lb/>Gabon <lb/>0.4288 <lb/>Bolivia <lb/>0.1328 Lao PDR <lb/>0.2593 <lb/>Guinea <lb/>0.4396 <lb/>Namibia <lb/>0.1352 Ghana <lb/>0.2611 <lb/>Nigeria <lb/>0.4428 <lb/>Tunisia <lb/>0.1357 Burundi <lb/>0.2754 <lb/>Chad <lb/>0.4525 <lb/>Mongolia <lb/>0.1420 Albania <lb/>0.2790 <lb/>Benin <lb/>0.4569 <lb/>Bosnia and Herzegovina <lb/>0.1425 Sri Lanka <lb/>0.2796 <lb/>Somalia <lb/>0.4992 <lb/>Thailand <lb/>0.1466 Armenia <lb/>0.2847 <lb/>Yemen <lb/>0.5065 <lb/>Colombia <lb/>0.1471 Pakistan <lb/>0.2945 <lb/>Congo, Dem.
