This paper examines health workforce and migration policies in New Zealand, with a special 
focus on the international recruitment of doctors and nurses. 2. 
The health workforce in New Zealand, as in all OECD countries, plays a central role in the health 
system. Nonetheless, maybe more than for any other OECD country, the health workforce in New Zealand 
cannot be considered without taking into account its international dimension. 3. 
New Zealand has the highest proportion of migrant doctors among OECD countries, and one of 
the highest for nurses. There is no specific immigration policy for health professionals, although the 
permanent and temporary routes make it relatively easy for doctors and nurses who can get their 
qualification recognised to immigrate in New Zealand. At the same time, New Zealand also has high 
emigration rates of health workers, mainly to other OECD countries. International migration is thus at the 
same time an opportunity and a challenge for the management of the human resources for health (HRH) in 
New Zealand. 4. 
Increasing international competition for highly skilled workers raises important issues such as 
sustainability and ability to compete in a global market. In this context, new approaches to improve the 
international recruitment of health workers, as well as developing alternative policies, may need to be 
considered. As for international recruitment, better coordination and stronger collaboration between main 
stakeholders could contribute to more effective and pertinent international recruitment. DELSA/HEA/WD/HWP(2008)3 5 RESUMÉ 5. 
Ce document examine les effectifs de professionnels de la santé et les politiques migratoires de la 
Nouvelle-Zélande, en se concentrant plus particulièrement sur le recrutement international de médecins et 
d'infirmières. 6. 
En Nouvelle-Zélande comme dans tous les pays de l'OCDE, ces professionnels jouent un rôle 
crucial dans le système de santé. Dans ce pays, pourtant, peut-être plus que dans tout autre pays de 
l'OCDE, on ne saurait étudier les travailleurs de la santé sans prendre en compte la dimension 
internationale de cette population. 7. 
La Nouvelle-Zélande compte la proportion de médecins immigrés la plus élevée de tous les pays 
de l'OCDE, celle des infirmières immigrées comptant aussi parmi les plus fortes. Le pays ne s'est pas doté 
d'une politique d'immigration particulière concernant ces professions même si Les filières d'immigration 
permanente ou temporaire font qu'il est relativement facile pour les médecins et les infirmières qui 
parviennent à faire reconnaître leurs diplômes d'aller s'installer en Nouvelle-Zélande. En parallèle, le pays 
présente également des taux élevés d'émigration de travailleurs de la santé (principalement vers les autres 
pays de l'OCDE). En matière de gestion des ressources humaines de la santé, les migrations internationales 
représentent donc à la fois une chance et une difficulté pour la Nouvelle-Zélande. 8. 
La concurrence internationale croissante pour attirer des travailleurs hautement qualifiés soulève 
des problèmes importants comme la soutenabilité et la capacité à affronter cette concurrence sur un marché 
mondialisé. Dans ce contexte, il faudrait peut-être réfléchir à de nouvelles stratégies pour améliorer le 
recrutement international de travailleurs de la santé et élaborer d'autres mesures possibles. Quant à ce 
recrutement, l'amélioration de la coordination et le renforcement de la collaboration entre les principales 
parties prenantes pourraient contribuer à le rendre plus effectif et plus approprié.

The health workforce in New Zealand, as in all OECD countries, plays a central role in the health 
system. In New Zealand, it accounts for about 70% of the costs of delivering public health services and 
5.5% of the workforce (Health Workforce Advisory Committee, 2002; OECD Health Data, 2007). Despite 
the key role of the health workforce in the health system, it has not been at the core of the various health 
system reforms in New Zealand. Nonetheless, health workforce issues have captured more attention 
recently, and there is now a growing recognition of their importance. 10. 
Maybe more than for any other OECD country, the health workforce in New Zealand cannot be 
considered without taking into account its international dimension. New Zealand has the highest proportion 
of migrant doctors among OECD countries, and one of the highest for nurses. At the same time, New 
Zealand also has high emigration rates of health workers, mainly to other OECD countries. International 
migration is thus at the same time an opportunity and a challenge for the management of the human 
resources for health (HRH) in New Zealand. This emphasises the need to better understand and strengthen 
the interactions between training, career development and international migration of health workers, a 
necessity reinforced by the increasing international competition for talent, and in particular health 
professionals. 11. 
This paper examines health workforce and migration policies in New Zealand, with a special 
focus on the international recruitment of doctors and nurses. In the first section, an overview of the health 
workforce is presented. Health workforce policies are discussed in the second section with a focus on 
international mobility. The third section addresses more specifically the current and future challenges 
related to in-and out-migration. Main findings @BULLET With 2.2 practising physicians per 1 000 population, New Zealand has a lower density than the 
OECD average (3.1‰). The reverse is true for nurses (9.5‰ as compared to 8.7‰). The 
geographical distribution of doctors and nurses is an important issue in New Zealand, as in many 
other OECD countries. Ageing and feminization of the health workforce are two other features 
that are shared by many other countries. @BULLET The importance of in-and out-migration is a key characteristic of the health workforce in New 
Zealand. New Zealand has the highest ratios of foreign-born and foreign-trained doctors in 
OECD countries (respectively 52% and 36% in 2005-06) and among the highest for nurses (29% 
and 24%, respectively). New Zealand also has the third highest and the second highest 
expatriation rates for doctors and nurses (28.5% and 23%, respectively). @BULLET The number of New Zealand-born doctors living in other OECD countries represents half the 
number of foreign-born doctors in New Zealand. The number of New Zealand-born nurses living 
in other OECD countries is matched by the number of foreign-born nurses in New Zealand 
(about 7 500). DELSA/HEA/WD/HWP(2008)3 9 @BULLET There is no specific immigration policy for health professionals, although the permanent and 
temporary routes make it relatively easy for doctors and nurses who can get their qualification 
recognised to immigrate in New Zealand. @BULLET The increasing use of temporary migration gives rise to a large number of short-term stays of 
health workers in New Zealand, in particular for doctors. While this is certainly a good policy to 
address workforce shortages in rural areas, short-term migration raises issues in terms of 
turnover. More generally, in the New Zealand context, retention of health professionals is a key 
issue because attrition rates (for doctors) and turnover rates (for nurses) tend to be quite high. @BULLET Despite repeated calls for  " self-sufficiency "  in recent official reports, New Zealand trains 
proportionally less medical graduates than OECD countries on average. It also has very few 
foreign medical students. As for nurses, the training rate is close to the OECD average, but out-
migration, notably to Australia, partly offsets this effort. @BULLET A broad portfolio of policies, in line with the recommendations of the Health Workforce 
Advisory Committee and more recently of the Health Workforce Taskforce, including improving 
salaries and working conditions, developing further skill-mix approaches, attracting back health 
workers who left New Zealand, reinforcing the links between education and management of the 
health workforce policies, would need further consideration. @BULLET Strengthening coordination between the main actors—the Department of labour, the Ministry of 
Health, the Ministry of Education, and the Tertiary Education Commission, but also with and 
between District Health Boards (DHBs)—could help to better address short and long-term 
shortages. @BULLET To date, immigration has been a very significant part of the supply of health workers in New 
Zealand. However, further increase in the number of overseas-trained health professionals might 
place New Zealand in a delicate position, as it could become too dependent on immigration in a 
context where many other OECD countries are also looking to recruit foreign doctors and nurses. DELSA/HEA/WD/HWP(2008)3 10 1. OVERVIEW 12. 
While the evolution of the health workforce over the past 25 years shows similar trends to those 
observed for the OECD as a whole, density for doctors tends to be lower than the OECD average but it is 
higher for nurses. Recent changes in terms of the regional distribution, gender mix and ageing of the health 
workforce are mostly shared with other OECD countries. At the same time, New Zealand is characterised 
by both large immigration and emigration of doctors and nurses. Health workforce density: occupational, regional and trend variations 13. 
As depicted in Chart 1a, with 2.2 practising physicians per 1 000 population, New Zealand is 
below the OECD average of 3.1‰. As for nurses, with 9.5 practising nurses per 1 000 population, New 
Zealand is slightly above the OECD average of 8.7‰. Results are more contrasted in terms of skill mix, as 
the number of nurses per doctor amounts to 4.3 which is significantly higher than the OECD average of 
2.8. As far as other health professionals are concerned, the population ratio for pharmacists is quite close to 
the OECD average at 0.75‰, while the corresponding figure for dentists is 50% lower than the OECD 
average (0.4‰ as compared to 0.62‰). 14. 
Because the population of New Zealand is relatively small (about 4 million), the moderate 
density figures translate into low numbers of doctors and nurses. Indeed, it is estimated that there are 9 000 
practising physicians and around 38 000 practising nurses and midwives in New Zealand (OECD, Health 
Data, 2006). About a third of the practising physicians are in general practice. While General Practitioners 
are essentially working in ambulatory practices, this is not the case for specialists who mainly work in 
public hospitals. Moreover, the proportion of specialists working in public hospitals increased over time, 
from 49% in 2000 to 74% in 2005 (Medical Council, 2007). In some specialities such as vascular surgery, 
neurosurgery or paediatric surgery, no more than 20 physicians are registered. 4 In this context, if a few 
specialists opt to emigrate this can have a major impact on health care delivery. 15. 
New Zealand is also characterised by significant imbalances in the geographic distribution of 
health professionals, as are most OECD countries. The lowest ratios of medical practitioners to population 
are found in rural regions in the North Island and in the West coast of the South Island (see Map 1). On the 
other hand, the highest ratios are in the larger urban regions, mainly Auckland, and Capital and Coast 
(Wellington and Kapiti) regions. 16. 
The differences are even more marked when performing the analysis on the basis of Territorial 
Authorities 5 . While in the cities of Auckland, Dunedin and Hamilton, there are more than 400 full-time-
equivalent doctors per 100 000 population, the corresponding figure is below 40 in the districts of Opotiki, 
Wairoa, Westland, Waimakariri and Southland (Medical Council of New Zealand, 2004). A large part of 4 There are only five specialists registered in breast medicine, 12 in rehabilitation medicine and 13 in oral 
and maxillofacial surgery. 5 There are 74 territorial authorities in New Zealand, including 16 city councils and 58 district councils. 
They provide local services. DELSA/HEA/WD/HWP(2008)3 11 these differences, notably for specialists, can be attributed to the presence of hospitals in cities. Geographic 
distribution of registered nurses appears to be more even, complementing to some extent the  " lack "  of 
other types of health professionals in some regions (e.g. West Coast). Chart 1a.

Over the past decades, the number of health workers has increased in New Zealand (see Chart 2). 
Between 1980 and 2004, the number of active medical practitioners grew from 1.56 per 1 000 population 
to 2.22 in 2004, corresponding to an average annual growth rate of 1.5%. However, this increase is lower 
than for the OECD as a whole (2.1%), reinforcing the discrepancy in terms of density. DELSA/HEA/WD/HWP(2008)3 13 18. 
The density of nurses (registered nurses and enrolled nurses altogether) grew slightly faster from 
6.1‰ to 9.5‰ over the same period (1980-2004). 6 In contrast to a more steady increase in the number of 
medical practitioners, changes in the nursing workforce are characterised by significant fluctuations in 
certain periods and a relative stability in density over the past decades. Chart 2a.

OECD 6 These trends are not specific to New Zealand, as OECD Health Data suggests that in 17 out of 28 OECD 
countries for which data are available the ratio of nurses to doctors in 1990 was above that in 2005 (OECD 
Health Data, 2007). DELSA/HEA/WD/HWP(2008)3 14 Demographic characteristics of the health workforce: feminization and ageing 19. 
New common trends have emerged in the health workforce of OECD countries in recent years, 
which may impact both the supply and the demand for health care. While health workforce ageing, 
feminization and new working patterns may result in a reduction in the supply of health workers, 
population ageing and technological changes are anticipated to increase the demand for health care 
services. 20. 
With regard to the ageing of its health workforce, New Zealand is not an exception: the average 
age is estimated at 45 for nurses and 44 for doctors. In 1990, about 35% of medical practitioners were 
under 35 years of age but by 2003 this percentage had fallen to 23% (see Chart 3a). This trend is even 
more marked for general practitioners and for registered nurses and midwives. Chart 3b. Age distribution of registered nurses and midwives in New Zealand, 1994-2004 Note. Data excludes enrolled nurses

As illustrated in Chart 4, feminization of the medical workforce has been one of most notable 
changes over the past three decades in New Zealand. Women doctors now represent 37% of all medical 
practitioners compared to 16.4% in 1980. They also count for about 50% of the current medical trainees 
(Health Workforce Advisory Committee, 2002; Medical Council of New Zealand, 2004). The feminisation 
of the medical workforce brings changes in working patterns as female doctors tend to concentrate more in 
primary care (family medicine, paediatrics, and psychiatry) and to work more part-time than their male 
counterparts. However, growing numbers are training in specialist branches such as radiation, oncology, 
pathology and several areas of surgery (Health Workforce Advisory Committee, 2002). In comparison, the 
nursing workforce is still quite gender-biased with only about 6% of male registered nurses and midwives. DELSA/HEA/WD/HWP(2008)3 15 Chart 4. Percentage of women medical practitioners in New Zealand, 1980-2006 Source: New Zealand Medical Workforce Statistics, NZHIS 16.4 37.1 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 % 22. 
As a result of multiple factors, including legislative changes7, doctor's working hours have 
decreased over time in most OECD countries. In New Zealand, the average hours worked per week by 
medical practitioners decreased from 48 in 2001 to 45.8 in 2004 (Medical Council of New Zealand, 2001; , 
Medical Council of New Zealand, 2004). The results of the 2005 Royal New Zealand College of General 
Practitioners (RNZCGP) Membership Survey suggest that among the 25-45 age cohort, very few GPs 
really want to be in full-time general practice, whether it is salaried or self-employed. There is a preference 
for locum work, part-time general practice, sub-specialties, non-GP medical work, and even non-medical 
work. One reason for this could be the desire for more balance between work and private life. This trend is 
shared by many OECD countries. It is expected to continue and accentuate as the workforce is ageing and 
feminising. This will probably contribute to reinforce the future need for medical practitioners and it raises 
critical issues with regard to ways of ensuring continuity of service. Box 1. Māori health workforce The indigenous Māori population is underrepresented in the health workforce. While Māori population represented 
about 15% of New Zealand population in 2003, Māoris made up only 2.7% of the medical workforce and 6.3% of the 
nursing workforce. Despite the low proportion of Māori in the health workforce, their number is increasing. Policies 
have been developed in order to increase their participation. Specific Māori health workforce plans have been 
established. At national level, the Raranga Tupuake Māori Health Workforce Development Plan has strategies to 
increase the number of Māori in the workforce at all levels, to expand the skill base of Māori currently in the workforce 
and enable equitable access for Māori to future training opportunities. The latter includes collaboration between the 
Minister of Health and traditional Māori healers to explore options for training and career pathways. District Health 
Boards as major employers also have a key role in Māori workforce development. For instance, the MidCentral District 
Health Board developed a Māori Health Workforce Strategy which aims, among other things, to involve Māori at all 
levels including planning, development and the delivery of health care programs and services. Sources: Health Workforce Advisory Committee, 2006; Nursing Council of New Zealand, 2003; Ministry of Health (2005) Raranga

Māori Health Workforce Strategy, Mid Central DHB. 7 One important evolution refers to recent legislative changes on working hours, notably for junior doctors. 
New Zealand has been a pioneer in this area because, since the implementation of the New Zealand 
Resident doctors' (NZRDA) Multi-Employer Collective Agreement (MECA) in 1985, junior doctors have 
been limited to 72 hours of work per week (maximum 16 consecutive hours). The current agreement 
between employers and trade unions is to work towards a 60-hour work week limit (see Landrigan 2006). DELSA/HEA/WD/HWP(2008)3 16 Immigrant and expatriate health workforce: New Zealand in a global context 23. 
A major feature of the New Zealand health workforce is the importance of immigrant health 
workers. According to the 2006 census, about 52% of the medical doctors (5 200), 29% of the nurses (10 
500) and 39% and 23% of the dentists (590) and pharmacists (720), respectively were born abroad (see 
Annex 1). 24. 
Immigration not only plays an important role in shaping New Zealand health workforce but its 
role in clearly increasing (see Chart 5). The share of foreign-born increased by 10 percentage points among 
doctors and nurses over the past 15 years. This increase was larger than the equivalent increase in the 
foreign-born among the high-skilled workforce in New Zealand. Chart 5. Foreign-born doctors, nurses and highly skilled in New Zealand (15-64), selected years, 1996-2006,

As of 2001, about 43% and 36% of the immigrant nurses and doctors were from the United 
Kingdom, which is the main origin country (see Table 1). The second most important origin country is 
Australia for nurses (8%) and South Africa for doctors (13%). OECD countries as a whole account for 
about half of the immigrant doctors and 65% of the nurses. Pacific Islanders also make a significant 
contribution to the New Zealand health workforce, notably for nurses, especially taking into account the 
small size of their countries of origin. 26. 
The information based on place of birth could give a distorted image of the role of international 
migration in shaping the health workforce if a significant share of these foreign-born were actually trained 
in New Zealand and not in their origin country. In the case of New Zealand, however, the two indicators 
are very close for nurses. Around 24% of nurses in New Zealand were foreign-trained in 2004 (see Chart 
6). This is not the case for doctors, as approximately 36% of active medical practitioners in New Zealand 
were foreign-trained in 2005 8 . 8 Part of the discrepancy for medical doctors is likely to be due to the fact that overseas medical graduates 
working on temporary registration are not included in the statistics DELSA/HEA/WD/HWP(2008)3 18 Chart 6. Foreign-trained doctors and nurses in New Zealand, selected years 1985-2005, numbers and

Another key feature of the New Zealand health workforce relates to the importance of out-
migration. Travelling overseas is viewed as a positive thing and an integral part of the lifestyle choices of 
many young New Zealanders. Health professionals are certainly no exception in this respect. Circa 2000, 
the number of New Zealand-born individuals living in other OECD country amounted to about 1 900 for 
doctors, 7 600 for nurses, 410 for pharmacists and 330 for dentists (see Table 2). In total, we estimate that 
23% of New Zealand-born nurses and 29% of doctors were working in another OECD country in their 
occupation. To a certain extent, these figures might even underestimate the importance of out-migration, as 
they do not cover emigration of New Zealanders born outside New Zealand and do not include people who 
were trained as health professionals but are working in another occupation overseas. Table 2. Health professionals born in New Zealand working in other OECD countries, main countries of

Australia is the main destination country for New Zealand migrants. Nonetheless, its importance 
varies across health professions. While it is estimated that 51% of New Zealand-born dentists living abroad 
are in Australia, this figure rises to 72% for nurses. The United Kingdom comes second, followed by the 
United States and Canada. These four countries capture more than 98% of the emigration to other OECD 
countries of New Zealand-born health professionals. 29. 
In comparison to other OECD countries, New Zealand stands out both in terms of immigration 
and emigration. In 2001, among OECD countries, New Zealand had the highest share of foreign-born 
doctors. It is followed by Australia, Ireland, Canada, and the United Kingdom, with percentages ranging 
between 34% and 43%. By contrast, figures range from a low of 1.5% to 4% in Mexico, Poland and 
Finland. For nurses, figures are generally lower but New Zealand is still near top of the list. Switzerland, 
Luxembourg, Australia and New Zealand have the highest share of foreign-born nurses ranging from DELSA/HEA/WD/HWP(2008)3 20 23.2% to 28.5%. At the same time, New Zealand also has one of the highest expatriation rates among 
OECD countries, only exceeded by Ireland (see Chart 7). 30. 
In comparison to the highly skilled in general, it was already pointed out that the share of foreign-
born tended to be higher amongst health professionals than among the highly skilled group as a whole (see 
Chart 5). Chart 8 compares the expatriation rate of health professionals and of people holding a tertiary 
degree for selected OECD countries around 2000. In the case of New Zealand, the former outstrips the 
latter, meaning that proportionally more doctors and nurses emigrate than other highly skilled workers to 
work in other OECD countries. This is also true for Canada, Finland and Ireland, but not in most other 
OECD countries. Chart 8. Expatriation rates of health professionals and highly skilled, selected OECD countries, circa 2000 Sources: Dumont and Zurn (2007) and OECD database on immigrants and expatriates AUS AUT BEL

The previous results clearly show the magnitude of out-migration for health professionals. Tables 
1 and 2 show that the number of New Zealand-born doctors living in other OECD countries is equivalent 
to approximately 50% of the number of foreign-born doctors in New Zealand. The results for nurses are 
even more striking, as the number of New Zealand-born nurses living in other OECD countries is almost 
equivalent to the number of foreign-born nurses in New Zealand. In other words, one could argue that 
immigration replaces on a one to one basis the  " lost New Zealand-born nurses "  due to emigration. DELSA/HEA/WD/HWP(2008)3 21 2. HEALTH WORKFORCE MANAGEMENT: TAKING ADVANTAGE OF INTERNATIONAL 
MOBILITY 32. 
In New Zealand as in a lot of countries, many factors contribute to shape the health workforce 
and the number of institutional stakeholders involved in policy development is large. In the following, a 
brief overview of recent health care reforms and health workforce planning is presented before focusing on 
education, recruitment and retention policies, with a special focus on the role of international migration. 2.1 Health Care reforms and health workforce planning Health care reforms 33. 
The New Zealand health system has always remained predominantly publicly funded, mainly 
through taxation. The importance of the role of public funding is emphasised by the Social Security Act 
1938 which marked the introduction of a comprehensive health system that mandated the provision of free 
care for all (French et al., 2001). This law intended to create a national health service, universally 
accessible and state-funded. Hospitals became publicly owned, providing fully subsidized treatment to 
patients. However, medical practitioners insisted on remaining independent and finally succeeded in 
retaining their private status. The Social Security Act has had a strong and long-term influence on the New 
Zealand health system and it was not until the 1980s that major reforms took place. However, the health 
workforce, and in particular the international mobility of health professionals, were not among the main 
priorities of these reforms. Four time periods can be identified for the health reform priorities in New 
Zealand (Easton, 2002; Ashton 2002, 2005; Gauld, 2003). ! First period: 1983-1992: During the 1970s, there was a perception that the health system was 
becoming increasingly complex and needed reform. Then, in the 1980s, decentralization was 
introduced with the creation of 14 Area Health Boards (AHBs) dealing with health care funding and 
service management. It was expected that the introduction of the Areas Health Boards would allow 
efficiency gains, but health expenditures per capita continued to grow (see Chart 9), particularly 
primary medical care subsidies. The AHBs were initially introduced by the National Government in 
1983, but their role was expanded under the Labour Government (1984-1990) in the context of public 
sector reforms in New Zealand. ! Second period: 1993-1996: During this period, a market-oriented reform was introduced by the 
National Government (1990-1996). In particular, the purchaser-provider split model was adopted. 
Under this system, purchasers used public funds to contract with competing public and private 
providers for the provision of health services. Purchasers were encouraged to buy services from the 
best value providers. In addition, budgets were integrated for primary and secondary services under one 
purchaser. However, these reforms were not necessarily supported by individuals working in the health 
system and the outcomes failed to match expectations, particularly in terms of securing efficiency gains 
in the hospital sector. ! Third period 1996-1999: At the end of the 1990s, New Zealand's first election under proportional 
representation produced a National-led coalition government (1996-1999) which abandoned the idea of 
competition as a main driver for the health system. Instead, the key guiding principle of collaboration 
instead of competition was introduced. DELSA/HEA/WD/HWP(2008)3 22 ! Fourth period: 2000 and onwards: One key element of this restructuring process, under the 
leadership of a Labour led coalition government (2000 up to present), set out in the New Zealand 
Public Health and Disability Act 2000 is the establishment of 21 District Health Boards (DHBs). Each 
DHB is responsible for providing or purchasing health services, including primary care, for the 
residents in its district. The DHBs are financed by the Ministry of Health on the basis of a formula 
accounting for the demographics of each district. The new health system combines centralised and 
decentralised components. While funding has remained centralised—the Ministry of Health is the key 
funding agent in the health system—health needs assessment, planning, provision and purchasing of 
health care are decentralised through the activities of the DHBs. In the primary sector, in 2001, the implementation of the Primary Health Care Strategy and the creation 
of Primary Health Organizations (PHOs) was an important change to the largely hospital-centered 
string of reforms over the past 20 years. PHOs are non-profit organizations which contract with DHBs 
to provide a comprehensive set of preventive and treatment services for their enrolled population. The 
first PHOs were formed in 2001 and patient enrolment began in 2002. As of July 2007, there were 82 
PHOs, covering 3.9 million people, or 97-98% of the New Zealand population. PHOs are funded for 
each person enrolled with them (capitation basis) supplemented with a co-payment via a fee-for-service 
system. In rural areas, due to recruitment difficulties, some DHBs recruit general practitioners (GPs) 
directly and pay them often a very competitive salary. Chart 9. Health expenditures per capita in New Zealand and OECD countries, 1990-2004 Source: OECD Health Data 2006 2083 2619 0 500 1000 1500 2000 2500 3000 1980

Unfortunately, there is no clear view on the impact and outcomes of each reform. However, the 
restructuring appears to have made little impact on the trends that commonly describe health system 
performance (Ashton, 2002), although it is also likely that the life of each reform was too short to have a 
long-term impact on the health system (Gauld, 2003). Health Workforce planning 35. 
Prior to the adoption of a market-oriented approach in the 90's, health workforce planning was 
playing an important role. Then, planning became less important, as market mechanisms were believed to 
contribute to health workforce equilibrium. As a result, workforce planning was neglected, as illustrated by 
the dismantling of most of the previous health workforce planning structures and processes. However, by 
the late 1990s and early 2000s, it appeared that these  " laissez-faire "  arrangements were not working so 
well. Persistent recruitment difficulties, a degraded infrastructure to support health workforce planning and 
development, an inadequate information base in most respects, lack of communication and co-operation 
between stakeholders including between the 21 DHBs (HWAC, 2003b), all contributed to the idea that DELSA/HEA/WD/HWP(2008)3 23 health workforce planning needed consideration again. As a result, various measures in the field of health 
workforce planning and development were adopted. 36. 
Special committees were set up to address health workforce issues. One such committee, the 
Health Workforce Advisory Committee (HWAC), was established in 2001 under the New Zealand Public 
Health and Disability Act 2000 in order to advise the Minister of Health on any workforce issues, and also 
to assess independently workforce capacity and foreseeable workforce needs. 37. 
In addition, specific concerns about the medical workforce, in particular, shortages, reliance on 
overseas-trained doctors, and lack of coordination between the medical education and the health sector, led 
the Health Workforce Advisory Committee to establish a Medical Reference Group 9 . The latter argued the 
case for the idea of self-sufficiency for New Zealand (see Box 2)—its report recommends increasing the 
number of medical graduates—and for workforce planning. It stresses the need for leadership and co-
ordination of medical workforce development in New Zealand, and proposed the development of a national 
body, with a coordinated planning function and capacity to provide a nationally consistent strategic 
overview of workforce development by aligning health and education policies and funding. Box 2. Self-sufficiency for the medical workforce in New Zealand? Over the past decade, self-sufficiency for the medical workforce has been advocated by different advisory committees, 
taskforces as well as the Ministry of Health.  " We believe that the strategic aim should be for New Zealand to be self-sufficient in its production of medical 
practitioners "  (Health Workforce Advisory Committee -2006, p. vii)  " Consideration should be given to New Zealand becoming net self-sufficient for medical graduates "  (Ministry of Health, 
2006b, p. 19) The workforce taskforce recommends that:  " The number of medical graduates produced by the training system be increased to ensure that New Zealand moves 
towards achieving ongoing self-sufficiency for its medical workforce "  (Workforce Taskforce 2007, p.1). This is part of 
the recommendation of the Workforce Taskforce. The fact that the idea of  " self-sufficiency "  has gained importance in New Zealand might be surprising. New Zealand is 
indeed a very open economy and immigration plays an important role in most economic sectors. Advocating for self-
sufficiency for the medical workforce would mean to recognize a  " medical exceptionalism " . In this context, it is not 
totally clear what self-sufficiency means and which policies will ensure it. Sources: Health Workforce Advisory Committee (2006), Fit for Purpose and For Practice: Advice to the Minister of Health on the 
Issues Concerning the Medical Workforce in New Zealand, Wellington; Ministry of Health (2006b), Training the medical workforce 
2006 and beyond, MoH, Wellington; Workforce Taskforce (2007), Reshaping Medical Education and Training to Meet the Challenges 
of the 21st Century: A Report to the Ministers of Health and for Tertiary Education from the Workforce Taskforce, Wellington. 38. 
The Health Workforce Advisory Committee has produced a series of reports addressing health 
workforce issues. However, after six years of existence, some claimed that it did not produce enough real 
practical recommendations for the government. The committee concluded its work in September 2006. 
More recently a Health Workforce Taskforce has been established in order to design more practical plans 
to streamline workforce planning and address issues around training, recruitment and retention of the full 
range of health professionals. 9 Health Workforce Advisory Committee (2006), Fit for Purpose and For Practice: Advice to the Minister of 
Health on the Issues Concerning the Medical Workforce in New Zealand, Wellington. DELSA/HEA/WD/HWP(2008)3 24 39. 
DHBs are also involved in health workforce planning. Initially, medical workforce development 
was largely left to individual employers, mainly each DHB. Then, efforts were undertaken to develop a 
more global and integrated approach. In particular, District Health Boards New Zealand (DHBNZ) 10 , 
which groups all 21 DHBs, aims at coordinating DHB policy and at introducing common approaches in 
terms of recruitment and planning. In 2003, DHBNZ developed an overarching  " Workforce Action Plan " , 
which focuses on information, relationships and strategic capability. In 2004/5, DHBNZ developed a 
 " Future Workforce Project "  focusing on DHB collective priorities and actions for health workforce 
development in the next five years. Eight priorities were identified aiming at nurturing and sustaining the 
workforce or developing workforce capacity. Although, DHBNZ acts more as a facilitator, it has a 
potential to play a greater role in reinforcing coordination between the different stakeholders and in 
insuring workforce development. 40. 
While health workforce policy has been the object of greater attention in New Zealand over the 
past decade, at the same time, the growing number of stakeholders involved in health workforce policy 
developments has contributed, to a certain extent, to a fragmentation and to some duplication of activities 
in health workforce planning. Furthermore, despite its intrinsic value the role attributed to health workforce 
planning remains an issue of debate (Box 3). Box 3. Which role for health workforce planning? Health workforce planning is advocated by many to facilitate the attainment of an adequate supply of health personnel 
in order to meet population demand for health. In fact, all OECD countries are involved, to different degrees, in health 
workforce planning activities. Indeed, there are also a number of relevant reasons, related to health labor market particularities and complexities, 
explaining why public intervention in health workforce management can be of social value. One important reason is 
that medical education is expensive and an oversupply of medical doctors does generate a significant social cost. 
Another reason is the time lag in medical education. Supply adjustment for medical doctors is not immediate as it can 
take up to 10 or more to train a medical specialist. Such lags may cause cycles of alternate shortages and surpluses of 
health workforce, in particular doctors. Specific policies, for instance through various set of incentives, can play a major 
role in minimizing the cyclical imbalances in the health labour market. But planning health labour supply is not an easy 
task and no single country has found the key to solving disparities between health workforce supply and demand 
(Kolars, 2001). First, fixing numerical limits essentially supposes a solid capacity to anticipate future demand. This seldom proves to 
be an easy task and there are many examples of prophecies of shortages or over-supply which never materialise. 
Uncertainties related to future population health needs and technological progress, as well as methodological 
sensitivity, contribute to weaken forecasting exercises. As a result, health workforce planning may mainly serve as a 
broad-brush tool. Also, while workforce planning could represent a promising area to consider the dynamic between domestic training 
and international recruitment, this is rarely the case. In the United Kingdom, the period from 1999 to 2005 was one of 
unprecedented staffing growth for the NHS in England, fuelled by the availability of significant growth in funding which 
resulted in increasing international recruitment and enhanced domestic training capacity. However, financial deficits 
emerged in the NHS from 2004-05 onwards, attributed, in part at least, to the costs of workforce expansion (House of 
Commons, Health Committee, 2007). The deficits have, in turn driven a sudden downturn in workforce size. This 
situation has exposed a disconnection between financial planning and workforce planning. It also shows, to some 
extent, the lack of coordination between migration and domestic training polices as a larger numbers of UK based 
graduates have more difficulties entering the health care labour market (Buchan, 2007). Sources: Buchan J. (2007), UK case study, forthcoming; Kolars J. (2001) Forecasting physician supply and demand, Medical 
Education 35(5), 424-425. 10 DHBNZ was formed by all 21 District Health Boards in December 2000 to provide a sector group through 
which DHBs could coordinate their activities at a national level. The overall purpose of DHBNZ is to assist 
DHBs in meeting their objectives. DELSA/HEA/WD/HWP(2008)3 25 2.2 Education policies and recognition of foreign qualification 41. 
Decisions about the number and the type of health workers trained are critical and affect the 
development of the health workforce. In addition, in the context of New Zealand, given the importance of 
foreign-trained health workers, it is important to have a good understanding of the condition of their 
insertion in the health workforce. In the following, medical and nursing education pathways will be 
examined, as well as the process for the recognition of foreign qualifications. Medical Education 42. 
Undergraduate medical education in New Zealand spans six years and is provided by two 
universities, Auckland and Otago (MoH, 2006b). This is followed by pre-vocational training that lasts two 
years (PGY 1, PGY 2) or more. It corresponds to a transitional period into professional practice, 
recognised with a registration in a general scope of practice with the Medical Council. Then, once a choice 
for a specific area of medicine is made, vocational training needs to be completed in order to be recognised 
by the relevant Medical College. The last phase lasts between three years for general practice to eight years 
for some hospital specialties (see Annex 2) 43. 
Various actors are involved in the funding of medical education in New Zealand. Funding is 
mainly provided by the Education Ministry through the Tertiary Education Commission (TEC), by the 
Ministry of Health through the Clinical Training Agency (CTA), and by the DHBs. While medical 
education until graduation is funded by the TEC, the internship (1 or 2 years) and the postgraduate training 
are mainly funded by the CTA. To a lesser extent, DHBs also play a role in postgraduate training. In 2002, 
it was estimated that 121 million NZ$ (1US$ = 2.16 NZ$, 2002) was spent on medical education and 
clinical training (MoH, 2006b). While TEC expenses on undergraduate education represented 43 million 
NZ$, CTA expenditures on clinical training represented 62.9 million NZ$, and DHBs expenditures 15 
million NZ$. There seems to be some lack of coordination between the Ministry of Education and the 
Ministry of Health. Some claim that there is a lack of global vision for medical education, and argue, for 
instance, that there is a mismatch between the number of available vocational positions (funded by the 
Ministry of Health) and the actual number of medical students starting vocational training (the number of 
medical students is determined by the Ministry of Education). 44. 
A recent report by the Health Workforce Taskforce (March 2007) emphasises, among other 
things, (i) the need for further cooperation in the field of education and training of medical practitioners 
through the creation of a Medical Training Board and (ii) that  " the number of medical graduates produced 
by the training system be increased to ensure that New Zealand moves towards achieving ongoing self-
sufficiency for its medical workforce " . 45. 
One major characteristic of the medical education system that New Zealand shares with other 
OECD countries is the capped system on funded places for domestic students. The intake of first-year 
students is currently fixed at 325 (TEC, personal communication, 2006). The government quota has been 
lifted twice in the past 20 years. In 1987, the intake at Otago was lifted from 150 to 170 students, and again 
in 2004, to 190. The University of Auckland had its quota raised from 115 to the current figure of 135 in 
2004 (TEC, personal communication, 2006). The increase in the quotas in 2004 aimed at allowing more 
students from rural areas in medical schools. In addition to the 325 domestic students, about 30-40 
international students are admitted each year. These students pay the full cost of their studies, which 
represents a source of revenue for the University. These students mainly come from the Middle East and 
most are funded by their government. Most students return to their country after graduation, despite the 
fact that for foreign-born medical students completing their degree in New Zealand, it would be relatively 
easy to stay on a permanent basis in New Zealand. DELSA/HEA/WD/HWP(2008)3 26 46. 
Between 1986 and 2006, the number of medical graduates increased from 228 to 322 per year 
(see Chart 10).Most of the jump in the number of graduates occurred post 1990, presumably a lagged effect 
of the first relaxation of the numerus clausus rule in the late 1980s. Presumably, the second relaxation in 
2004 will see a further jump in the number of graduates from 2010 on. New Zealand tends to have lower 
graduation rates than most OECD countries. While the average graduation rate per 100 000 population in 
New Zealand is estimated at 7.9 between 1995 and 2004, the corresponding figure for the OECD amounted 
to approximately 9.4 (OECD, 2006). For New Zealand, a graduation rate of 9.4 per 100 000 population 
would correspond to 365 graduates per year, as compared to the average of 305 between 1995 and 2004 
(see Chart 11)—equivalent in a steady-state (and assuming no attrition) to a 12% increase in the current 
annual intake to medical schools. Chart 10. Yearly number of intake and medical graduates, New Zealand, 1986-2006 Source: New Zealand Health Information Service 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 400 Intake

Any decision to increase the number of medical students will not only need to address the capped 
system constraints, but also recruitment difficulties for faculty members. Indeed, recruitment and retention 
problems within academic medicine are common. This persistent problem is largely attributed to higher 
salaries proposed by DHBs. Salary gaps in 2005 between university health professionals involved in 
medical education and health professionals employed by DHBs to deliver health services were estimated at 
between 30 and 60 000 NZ$ (1US$ = 1.42 NZ$, 2005) (MoH, 2006b). However, the recent wage increases 
in favour of faculty members should contribute to ease such recruitment and retention difficulties. 48. 
Although medical education is largely subsidized by the government for domestic students, the 
increasing indebtedness of students is a source of widespread concern and discussion (HWAC, 2005; 
Moore et al., 2006a; Pole, 2006), and is thought to play a role in the choice of the medical specialty and 
even in out-migration. 49. 
The cost of undergraduate medical education in 2002 was estimated at 199 000 NZ$, of which 
71% is met by the Government and 29% by the student (MoH, 2006b). This represents about 10 000 NZ$ 
per year. As a result, students usually take out a loan in order to pay the fees and to cover their living 
expenses. At the end of their studies, they may end up with a large debt, about 70-80 000 NZ$ for doctors 
and even more for dentists. 50. 
Moore et al. (2006b) found that indebtedness was a key element for those considering emigration 
to Australia or to other countries where wages are higher, so that they can reimburse their debt more easily. 
Student indebtedness is also said to play an important role in the choice of medical specialty. For a 
substantial number of medical graduates, debt was one of the main factors explaining the lack of 
attractiveness of work areas like general practice, public health and psychiatry. 51. 
The debt issue is abundantly debated and various measures have been adopted to address this 
concern. They include the introduction by the government of a capped rate of student loan interest at 7% in 
an effort to give greater certainty to students, the institution of a  " step-up scholarship "  that provides a DELSA/HEA/WD/HWP(2008)3 28 significant subsidy to tuition fees, and more recently, an interest write-off for graduates choosing to stay in 
New Zealand (Pole, 2006). However, at the same time, those efforts are partially off-set by the Universities 
continual increase of medical fees. Policies of writing off interest for students are also criticised by some 
who claim that it does not represent an efficient allocation of public resources and might encourage more 
borrowing and slower repayment. Nursing and midwifery education 52. 
In contrast to medical education, the number of places in nursing and midwifery schools is 
demand-driven although the availability of clinical placements has constrained enrolments. However, from 
2008, the demand-driven system will be replaced by a global budget system under which each University 
will submit a budget proposal to the TEC. 53. 
Registered nurses in New Zealand, the largest nursing category, are educated via a three-year 
Bachelor of Nursing degree. There are 16 educational institutions offering programs leading to 
registration 11 . Due to this relatively large number of nursing educational institutions and the low number of 
students, in particular in rural areas, concern about the average quality of nursing training programmes has 
been expressed in New Zealand. However, closing nursing programmes in rural areas is seen as difficult, 
since it is likely to make rural recruitment more difficult. 54. 
By contrast to medical graduates, over the past decade, the number of nursing graduates has 
decreased, from 1 485 in 1996 to 1 206 in 2004. The number of nursing graduates per 100 000 population 
is slightly below the OECD average, 31.8 per 100 000 population in New Zealand against 32.8 for the 
OECD (see charts 12 and 13). Chart 12. Yearly number of nursing graduates, New Zealand, 1996-2004 Source: Report of the Nursing Council of New Zealand, Nursing Council of New Zealand 1485

The second level nurse, the Enrolled Nurse, is the second largest category. Enrolled Nurses were 
educated in employer-based programmes under the Nurses Act 1977. However, these programmes were 
discontinued by health boards in 1993. The Health Practitioners Competence Assurance Act 2003 (Box 4) 
saw the reinstatement of a second-level nursing programme in educational institutions under a new scope 
of practice and title, Nurse Assistant. Since 2004, the Enrolled Nurse scope of practice has not been open 
for new applicants.Applicants from that date are registered as Nurse Assistants. There are approximately 
3 800 Enrolled Nurses in New Zealand (New Zealand Health Information Service, 2004). Enrolled Nurses 
work under the direction of a Registered Nurse or Midwife. The responsibilities of Enrolled Nurses include 
assisting patients with the activities of daily living and performing delegated interventions from the nursing 
or midwifery care plan. 56. 
Currently, there are about 135 nurse assistants in New Zealand (North, personal communication, 
2007). Nurse assistants represent a  " second-tier person "  working under the supervision of a registered 
nurse or midwife in a range of areas. They deliver nursing care to individuals in community, residential 
and hospital settings. To become a nurse assistant, it is compulsory to follow a program length of 1000 
hours, with the students required to complete a minimum of 350 hours theory and 650 hours practice. 
Nurse Assistants are prepared in polytechnic institutes. There are three nurse assistant programmes in New 
Zealand with further programmes under consideration 12 . 57. 
Another new category is that of Nurse Practitioner. Legislation establishing Nurse Practitioner 
was enacted in September 2005. Nurse practitioners have an expanded nursing role in clinical settings. In 
addition, they have developed the skills and knowledge to expand their role to include tasks that may have 
been 'traditionally' performed by other health professionals, such as prescribing medications and ordering 
diagnostic tests (Nursing Council, 2006). There are only about 40 individuals practising as Nurse 
Practitioners within New Zealand. To become a nurse practitioner, one should be on the nursing register, 
have a minimum of four years of experience in a specific area of practice, have a Masters Degree, and have 12 Northland Polytechnic (aged care) and Christchurch Polytechnic Institute of Technology (long term and 
rehabilitation care). DELSA/HEA/WD/HWP(2008)3 30 passed the Nursing Council assessment of Nurse Practitioner competencies and criteria. There are six 
master programmes to become a Nurse Practitioner in New Zealand and there is an education equivalences 
process available to those who have not undertaken one of these approved programmes 13 . 58. 
As for midwifery, pre-registration education is through a three-year Bachelor of Midwifery 
programme. There are five pre-registration midwifery programmes in New Zealand 14 . Students are mainly 
direct entry (i.e. with no previous health profession education). However, a midwife may also be a 
registered general and obstetric or comprehensive nurse who has undertaken further education to gain 
midwifery qualifications. Midwifery students who hold a previous nursing registration or those with other 
degrees or other relevant experience are likely to gain credit under these policies and complete a shorter 
programme (New Zealand College of Midwives, 2006). Box 4: The Health Practitioners Competence Assurance Act 2003 Health professionals are regulated professions and registration is essential to practise. A new approach towards 
health profession regulation was adopted with the Health Practitioners Competence Assurance (HPCA) Act 2003 
which came into effect in 2004. While the main purpose of the Act is to protect the public from harm and applies only to 
those practitioners where there is a risk of harm, this act differs from previous legislations. The main differences are 
the extension of the ongoing competency requirements, which applied previously to only the medical profession, to 
other regulated professions; a certification regime for all professions which allows for flexibility in the overall health 
workforce; the delegation to the registration authorities of all clinical decision-making to allow them to respond to 
changing circumstances without the need for legislative change; the introduction of scopes of practice to allow the 
development of new roles; and the separation of the registration function from the disciplinary function. The HPCA Act 
applies to all registered health practitioners including medical practitioners (doctors, surgeons and other specialists), 
dentists, midwives, nurses, pharmacists, physiotherapists, podiatrists and psychologists. Under the HPCA act, 'scopes of practice' are used to describe the tasks performed by a professional group, 
instead of  " areas of specialty "  as was previously the case. For instance, under the HPCA, the previous nursing 
registers have been replaced by four scopes of practice: registered nurse, nurse practitioner, nurse assistant and 
enrolled nurse. As mentioned earlier, enrolled nurses who graduated before 2000 keep their previous title, but those 
educated after 2000 have the title of nurse assistant. The act also established the separate Midwifery Council (from the 
Nursing Council) which has jurisdiction over the education, registration, discipline and competence of all midwives in 
New Zealand. A review of the operation of the Act is underway to identify implementation issues requiring any further changes. Source:

Overseas health professionals must meet both the immigration requirements set by the 
immigration services and the registration requirements set by professional bodies. Until the mid 90s, there 
were no real links between the immigration process and the foreign recognitions of qualification. At that 13 Auckland University of Technology (Master of Health Science in Advanced Nursing Practice), Eastern 
Institute of Technology (Master of Nursing), Massey University (Master of Nursing), Otago Polytechnic 
(Master of Nursing), The University of Auckland (Master of Nursing), University of Otago (Christchurch 
School of Medicine). 14 Otago Polytechnic in Dunedin, Christchurch Polytechnic Institute of Technology (CPIT) in Christchurch, 
Massey University in Wellington, Waikato Institution of Technology in Hamilton and Auckland University 
of Technology (AUT) in Auckland. DELSA/HEA/WD/HWP(2008)3 31 time, New Zealand was keen to attract skilled and highly qualified people and passing the minimum-point 
threshold for immigration gave an automatic right to settle in New Zealand. However, despite being 
granted residence on the basis of their qualifications, a number of highly skilled individuals, including 
doctors, did not meet standards set down by the relevant professional bodies in order to practise in New 
Zealand. Hence, highly skilled permanent immigrants faced increasing difficulties in finding jobs which 
matched their qualification and foreign work experience. 60. 
In 1995, the policy for skilled migrants was refined, with increased emphasis on the 
transferability of human capability to New Zealand, via for example, qualification recognition, English-
language ability, etc. As a result, even if requirements are separate, there is now a more harmonized 
approach between the immigration and registration process. In most of cases, eligibility for registration or 
registration is required in order to qualify for skilled immigration. The sequence in general is as follows for 
health professionals wanting to work in New Zealand: be eligible for registration or be registered, have a 
job offer, obtain a work or residency permit. Most of the time, eligibility for registration is also a pre-
requisite for the work or residency permit. However, registration is not a pre-requisite for individuals 
migrating to New Zealand through the family or the international humanitarian stream. Available evidence 
suggests that few humanitarian immigrants have medical qualifications, although the situation is less clear 
for nursing. 61. 
The New Zealand Censuses of Population and Dwelling show that employment rates of people 
aged 15-64 with post school qualifications in the medical field (results are similar for nursing and 
midwifery studies) tend to have high employment rates but that people born in Asia and those originating 
from non-English-speaking European countries face more difficulties to integrate in the labour market 
(Chart 14). Part of the discrepancy may be due to difficulties in getting qualifications recognised, but more 
in-depth studies would be needed here to ascertain this point. In any case the improvements recorded 
between 2001 and 2006 may reveal that this is less of an issue than it was in the past. 62. 
The Medical Council of New Zealand is responsible for the registration of doctors in New 
Zealand. Getting registered can be done via several routes depending on the country in which the medical 
degree was obtained, previous work experience and purpose of the stay (Box 5). The first pre-requisite is to 
meet English-language requirements, as determined by the International English Language Testing System 
(IELTS). Individuals graduated in the United Kingdom or Ireland and with one-year of clinical experience 
can get provisional general registration. For individuals who graduated in other countries, a pass in 
USMLE 15 steps one and two is required to prove medical knowledge. Furthermore, they must also pass the 
New Zealand registration examination (the NZREX clinical) to demonstrate clinical ability. Provisional 
registration can also be obtained by individuals who worked continuously for at least three years in a health 
system considered as comparable 16 . As for vocational registration, it applies for individuals with training 
and experience as a specialist overseas. 15 United States Medical Licensing Examination. 16 Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Norway, Republic of

months in New Zealand to become familiar with the culture. During this time they are registered within a provisional 
general scope of practice and their performance will be assessed by senior colleagues. They will be required to 
complete certain requirements to be registered within a general scope. The only exception to this supervised period is 
for New Zealand and Australian graduates who have already completed their internship in Australia. General: A doctor who has completed the requirements of a provisional general scope will be registered within a 
general scope of practice. Examples are junior doctors who have completed their first post-graduate year and may be 
in vocational training, doctors who have not started, or have chosen not to do, vocational training, or doctors nearing 
retirement who no longer meet the requirements for registration within a vocational scope of practice. The doctor must 
establish a professional collegial relationship with another doctor who is registered within the same or related 
vocational scope, and must participate in appropriate continuing professional development to maintain and improve 
competence and to be recertified each year. Provisional vocational: Doctors who have completed their vocational training and who are not already registered in 
New Zealand must work under supervision for at least 12 months. They are registered within a provisional vocational 
scope of practice. During this time they must complete Council's requirements for registration in a vocational scope. 
Those requirements may include working in a formal assessment position and/or passing an examination. Vocational: A doctor who has completed his or her vocational training as a consultant and has appropriate 
qualifications and experience can be registered within a vocational scope of practice. These vocational scopes are 
recognised by the medical Council. A doctor registered in a vocational scope must participate in an approved 
continuing professional development programme to maintain competence and be recertified each year. Special purpose scope: A doctor who satisfies the registration criteria to visit New Zealand for one of the following 
defined and specific reasons will be registered within a special purpose scope of practice: i.e. as a visiting expert; as a 
sponsored trainee; for post-graduate training and/or experience; as a medical researcher; as a locum specialist 
working in New Zealand for less than six months; to help in an emergency, or for any other reason approved by 
Council. These doctors will be required to work under supervision for the duration of their employment or appointment. This 
'special purpose' scope of practice is not a pathway to permanent registration. Source: New Zealand Medical Council 63. 
The Nursing Council of New Zealand is responsible for the recognition of qualifications of 
foreign-educated nurses. The main principles governing registration include that the applicant has 
undertaken a nursing programme that is similar in all specified content and length to the equivalent 
programme in New Zealand, and is able to speak and write in the English language when English is not the 
applicant's first language. Tests recognised by the Nursing Council are CGNFS, IELTS, and OET. As 
international recruitment is regulated by both immigration and registration proceedings, the registration 
process can also be used to facilitate or discourage immigration. For instance, the required minimum level 
for the IELTS has been raised: a score of not less than 7 in each of the four sections of the exam is now 
required instead of an overall average 7 previously. As a result, registration is more difficult for overseas 
nurses. Applicants who do not meet the requirements for nursing registration may be required to undergo 
further training within a New Zealand educational institution. 2.3 National and international recruitment 64. 
Although there has been a substantial increase in the number of health workers over the past 
decades in New Zealand, the increasing dependency on foreign health worker is fuelling concerns on 
health worker shortages. DELSA/HEA/WD/HWP(2008)3 34 Estimating—and responding to—shortages of health personnel 65. 
Whether or not a shortage of health workers exists is a critical question but the answer to this 
question tends to vary according to the approaches adopted or to the stakeholder perspective. Nonetheless, 
it is commonly agreed that difficulties do prevail in recruiting nurses and medical practitioners, in 
particular for some medical and nursing specialties, and more generally, in rural areas. 66. 
One tool to evaluate and monitor shortages is the Job Vacancy Monitor (JVM) system of the 
Department of Labour (Box 6). The JVM is a monthly analysis of job advertisements published in selected 
newspapers. Their assessment of occupations for 2006 indicate that skill shortages for health professionals 
(excluding nurses and midwives) remain severe with only 41% of advertised vacancies being filled 
(Department of Labour, 2007). Nurses and midwives moved out of the extreme shortage category in 2006, 
but remain difficult for employers to find, with a little over half the advertised vacancies being filled. On 
this basis, it was considered that there is not a genuine shortage of individuals with the required skills in 
nursing despite employers having considerable difficulty filling vacancies for nurses and midwives 
(Department of Labour, 2005b). Recently, there has been a slight easing of the health labour market: JVM 
data recorded a decline of 12% in advertised vacancies between 2005 and 2006 for the highly skilled in the 
health sector (Department of Labour, 2006) 17 . However, skill shortages appear to be chronic for some 
specialities like anaesthetics, radiology, obstetrics, and psychiatric nurses. Box 6. Job Vacancy Monitoring Programme The Job Vacancy Monitoring Programme is designed to provide new insights into skill shortages in New Zealand. It 
aims to identify which skilled occupations are in shortage, and to better understand the supply and demand forces 
contributing to these shortages. The programme currently consists of three components: Job Vacancy Monitor: a monthly analysis of job advertisements appearing in 25 daily newspapers and two IT internet 
job boards. This component started from November 2002. A Survey of Employers who have Recently Advertised (SERA), with two sub-components: SERA Extensive: a large sample survey of employers to establish whether the advertised positions were filled, and 
the number and suitability of applicants. SERA Intensive: an in-depth survey of a small number of employers who advertised vacancies in occupations in 
shortage to gain an understanding of the forces contributing to the shortage. Occupation reports: The results of the SERA surveys are analysed together with other data sources to form a series of 
occupational reports, produced on an annual basis. Source: Department of Labour, http://www.dol.govt.nz/publications/jvm/ 67. 
DHBs which employ the majority of health professionals in New Zealand play a key role in 
recruitment. Until recently, each DHB was recruiting on its own, creating some competition between them, 
and leading to some inefficiency in the recruitment process from a national perspective. Common 
approaches of recruitment between DHBs are now favored, especially for international recruitment. For 17 
There are, however, a number of limitations in using vacancy data. In general, vacancy rates may 
understate the extent of shortages. There may be  " suppressed "  vacancies (where a post is not advertised 
because management has no expectation of successful recruitment), and  " hidden "  vacancies (where a post 
is filled, but by an individual with insufficient skills or experience to successfully meet the requirements of 
the job). In addition, there seems to be room for more collaboration between the Department of Labour and 
the Ministry of Health (and other institutions involved in health workforce planning) regarding the 
identification of health worker shortages. DELSA/HEA/WD/HWP(2008)3 35 instance, efforts are developing to better share information on health personnel needs across DHBs or by 
pooling resources for recruitment, and also to develop a brand in order to facilitate global recruitment for 
New Zealand. Recruitment agencies are not playing a significant role for international recruitment in New 
Zealand, but the Department of Labour has a Relationship Management Team aiming at organising expos 
and recruitment campaigns abroad. 68. 
Among the policies to improve recruitment, remuneration and financial incentives are among the 
most common. Information on the employment status of doctors and nurses indicates that the average wage 
in medicine in 2001 was 62 000 NZ$ (Maré and Liang, 2006). The mean income in the field of medicine is 
comparable in New Zealand with accounting and law and legal studies. 69. 
Until 2000, every hospital would negotiate individually with their employees. Now, health 
workers employed by DHBs have common contracts through the Multi-Employer Collective Agreement 
(MECA). As the wage has been aligned on the Auckland DHB MECA, most doctors and nurses have seen 
their wage increased, except those in Auckland. Medical specialists have also benefited from wage 
increases due to the competition between DHBs to recruit them. As for nurses, they have benefited recently 
from a substantial wage increase. However, most international studies investigating the labour supply 
decisions of nurses tend to find that, at least in the short-run, nursing labour supply appears to be fairly 
unresponsive to wage change (Shield, 2004; Chiha and Link, 2003; Antonazzo et al., 2003). In other 
words, an increase in the wage does not necessarily lead to a substantial increase in labour participation in 
the short-run. 70. 
Another type of approach to address potential shortages is through the development of a flexible 
workforce in New Zealand. In particular, as noted above, the use of nurse practitioners has been 
encouraged but this promising initiative is still in its infancy since only 40 nurse practitioners have been 
trained so far, and not all are in employment which fully used their training and skills. International recruitments: immigration policy as a management tool of the health workforce? 71. 
In terms of international recruitment of health workers, New Zealand has no specific migration 
programmes. Health professional migration policy is defined in the context of skilled migration. However, 
for those professions listed on shortage occupation lists which include most health professions, 
immigration is facilitated. The fact that shortage occupation lists are used in immigration policy illustrates 
that health workforce concerns are integrated, to a certain extent, in the immigration policy. 72. 
Immigration plays an important role in building New Zealand society. The proportion of foreign-
born population in New Zealand is one of the highest among OECD countries, at 19.4% in 2005 (OECD, 
2007). Over the past 20 years, the number of individuals migrating to New Zealand has increased and 
diversified. While Europe and Australia still represent the main source countries, Asia is playing a bigger 
role. 73. 
New Zealand immigration policy has undergone various changes. Major changes in the selective 
migration policy were introduced, notably in 1995, which aimed at better taking into account language 
proficiency, implementing recognition of qualifications and prioritizing those with a job offer. In recent 
years, the usual distinction between temporary and permanent migrants was questioned. As a result, the 
principles and the procedure governing the permanent migration program were amended to give priority to 
people with New Zealand experience and qualifications, creating bridges between temporary and 
permanent programs. These changes have had a significant impact on the ability of foreign students to stay 
in New Zealand after graduation. In 2005, about 30% of those who entered with a temporary permit in 
2002 gained permanent residence in New Zealand (DoL, The Migration Trend, 2006). DELSA/HEA/WD/HWP(2008)3 36 74. 
The number and composition of permanent residence migration inflow is set annually with regard 
to a range of factors, including the impact of a given level of approval on the economy, social cohesion and 
infrastructure, and the desirability of stability (New Zealand High Commission, 2003). In 2005/6, around 
52 000 people were approved for permanent New Zealand residence. Basically there are three entry routes 
to permanent migration to New Zealand: (i) Skilled/Business, (ii) Family Sponsored and (iii) International 
Humanitarian. 75. 
The Skilled Migrant Category (SMC) represents the main path to residence, as over half of all 
people approved in 2005/6 gained residence through this category. To be eligible in the skilled migration 
category, one must be under 55 years old and score at least 100 points in their Expression of Interest 
(people with 140 points or more are automatically selected). 18 Additional points are given to occupations, 
recognised prior to arrival, that are included in the Long-Term Skill Shortage List (LTSSL) (Box 7). This 
list includes almost all health occupations. Additional bonus points are also granted for an employment 
offer for the regions outside Auckland, and for work experience in New Zealand. In 2005/06, 220 doctors 
and 780 nurses entered through the Skill Migrant Category. Figures for the previous year were respectively 
320 and 920 (see Annex 3). Box 7. Occupational Shortage Lists The Department of Labour currently maintains two occupational shortage lists: the Immediate Skill Shortage List 
(ISSL), formerly the Occupational Shortage List (OSL) and the Long-Term Skill Shortage List (LTSSL), formerly the 
Priority Occupation List (POL). The ISSL and the LTSSL are reviewed biannually by the Department of Labour. During 
the review, submissions are sought from industry groups about both the nature and extent of skill shortages in their 
area. The ISSL Skill Shortage List contains professions which are currently in high demand in New Zealand and lists the 
qualifications and /or experience required for work permits and the recommended standard for work permit applicants 
with an offer of employment. The LTSS List contains professions which are currently in extraordinarily high demand in New Zealand and lists the 
qualifications and /or experience required for residence permits and bonus points under the Skilled Migrant Category From an employer's point of view, the occupation shortage lists obviate the need to demonstrate that there is no New 
Zealand citizen or resident available suitably qualified by training and experience to do the job offered. Therefore, once 
a job has been offered to a potential employee, the person will be able to obtain a work visa or permit provided that 
they have the recognized skills and qualifications. 76. 
As for temporary migration, one important category for health professionals is the  " Work to 
Residence " , which allows getting a work visa as a step towards gaining permanent residence. A major 
entry route for the  " Work to Residence "  is the  " Talent Program " . It includes the case of a person with a job 
offer from an accredited employer (most DHBs are accredited employers) and listed on the LTSSL. In this 
situation the employer can recruit directly from abroad for a period up to two years renewable and 
transferable to a permanent permit. A person with a job offer which is included in the ISSL (most medical 
occupations are also included in this list) can get the same type of work permit without having to pass a 
labour market test. In other cases, the employer must demonstrate that there are no suitably qualified 
and/or experienced New Zealand citizens or residents available to do the job. In 2005/06, there were about 
1 470 work applications approved for medical doctors and 1 060 for nurses. The latter is on the decrease as 18 All individuals meeting the criteria are then pooled and ranked according to specific selection criteria. 
People who score between 100 and 140 points and have a job or job offer in New Zealand will be selected 
in sufficient number to meet the New Zealand Immigration Programme numbers. However, not all eligible 
individuals in the pool will necessarily be invited to apply for residence. Individuals who are not invited to 
apply for residence remain in the pool for three months. If they are not selected after this period, they can 
lodge a new Expression of Interest. DELSA/HEA/WD/HWP(2008)3 37 compared to previous years (1 350 in 2004 and 1 630 in 2003) while the former is mostly stable (see 
Annex 3). 77. 
Finally, another entry route is the  " Working Holiday Scheme " . This program is for individuals 
aged between 18 and 30 years who aim to experience life in New Zealand (about 28 500 persons were 
granted this type of visa in 2005/06). People entering through this route are able to work for part of their 
total permit duration whose maximum period is two years. There are about 25 bilateral agreements with 
origin countries for this program which is capped except for the United Kingdom, Germany, Japan, the 
Netherlands, Norway and Sweden. It seems that some medical doctors, notably from the United Kingdom, 
enter through this route, mainly for temporary stay. 78. 
In New Zealand, international recruitment of health workers is important as illustrated on a long 
period by registration data 19 . It accounted for over 80% of annual registrations of doctors over the period 
2002-2005, and over 50% of all nursing registrations (New Zealand Medical Council, 2006; New Zealand 
Nursing Council, 2006). The annual number of overseas registrations of medical practitioners rose from 
452 in 1990 to 1 414 in 2005. 79. 
Over time, the main source countries have remained relatively similar, with the exception of 
South Africa. For the latter, there has been a large increase in medical migration, especially in 1995, which 
was associated with the end of Apartheid. However, concern expressed about the brain drain by the South 
African authorities has led to a decrease in active recruitment from South Africa thereafter. More 
generally, concern about the impact of migration on lower income source countries has led New Zealand to 
sign the Commonwealth Code of Practice for the International Recruitment of Health Workers. Chart 15. Yearly registrations of foreign educated doctors and registered nurses and midwives, 1996-2005,

For nurses, the United Kingdom has remained the main source country. At the same time, new 
source countries are emerging. There has been a significant increase in the yearly registration of Filipino-
trained nurses in recent years (from around 50 in 2000 to 150 in 2005). Also, registration from nurses 19 The registration figures should, however, be considered with caution as they cannot necessarily be equated 
to the number of doctors or nurses entering the country at a point in time. DELSA/HEA/WD/HWP(2008)3 38 trained in India and Zimbabwe has become more important. While almost no registrations were recorded in 
New Zealand from nurses trained in India and Zimbabwe in 2000, registrations from each of these 
countries reached 100 in 2005. By contrast, yearly registrations from nurses trained in South Africa have 
significantly diminished (from 200 in 2001 to around 50 in 2005). 81. 
Over time, there has been an increasing use of temporary migration which has given rise to a 
large number of short-term stays of health workers in New Zealand, in particular for doctors. For instance, 
temporary registration 20 for medical doctors rose from 165 in 1990 to 758 in 2003 (HWAC, 2005). 82. 
A number of short stays are doctors coming for a locum in rural areas. In rural areas, where 
recruitment difficulties are particularly notable, especially for general practitioners, special programs have 
been developed. For instance, the New Zealand Rural General Practice Network, a not-for-profit society, is 
representing the interests of rural general practice and, in particular, the rural health workforce. It 
developed to help the recruitment for long-term services or for short-term locum services in rural areas. In 
particular, the locum program is rather successful in helping to replace doctors when they are on 
continuous training or on holiday. 2.4 Retention and emigration 83. 
Retention is also a critical element in health workforce policy as staff turnover has a cost. 
Moreover, in the context of New Zealand, as mentioned before, emigration is significant, particularly to 
Australia and the United Kingdom, and thus retention and return migration is an important issue. Retention and turnover in the workforce 84. 
For nurses, turnover across DHBs is estimated to range between 12% and 25% (North et al., 
2006a). Higher turnover occurs in DHBs in metropolitan areas, areas where there is high competition for 
nurses, and in certain clinical areas such as mental health and emergency services. North et al. (2006b) 
estimated at 19 900 NZ$ the cost per nurse leaver, and between 5 000 NZ$ and 13 000 NZ$ the costs 
associated with recruitment, hiring and training. 85. 
In order to improve retention in the job, efforts have been engaged to address working conditions 
through, for example, the development of  " magnet hospitals "  in New Zealand. Internationally, it has been 
observed that some policies in place in hospitals are more successful in recruiting and retaining health care 
staff. These hospitals have been designated as  " magnet hospitals " . Research shows superior outcomes for 
magnet hospitals, such as lower risk-adjusted hospital mortality, higher ratings of quality of care, higher 
patient satisfaction, lower rates of nurse burnout and higher rates of nurse job satisfaction. It appears that 
developing some of the features of a  " magnet hospital "  is certainly a promising strategy to improve 
retention. Becoming a magnet hospital requires meeting 14 principles including having strong nursing 
leadership, a flat organisational structure, a participatory management style, and promoting work 
autonomy. A New Zealand Magnet Advisory Group was established in February 2002. Several DHBs are 
now actively pursuing the possibility of introducing magnet concepts in New Zealand's health and 
disability sector. Hutt Valley DHB has been the first to receive magnet hospital accreditation in June 2007 
(Nursing New Zealand, 2007). 20 Until recently, doctors visiting New Zealand for up to three years were recorded in a temporary registration 
category. This applied mainly to doctors trained in one of the following countries: United Kingdom, 
Republic of Ireland, Canada, United States, and South Africa. This scope of practice no longer exists under 
the current legislation and these doctors are now registered in either a provisional general or special-
purpose scope depending on their circumstances DELSA/HEA/WD/HWP(2008)3 39 86. 
Other types of retention strategies are also being developed at the DHB level. For instance, in the 
Capital and Coast DHB, combined approaches have been developed to improve nurse turnover which was 
around 33%. Following a large wage increase (about 20%), new training approaches, and better work-
related advantages, turnover rates are significantly lower, around 17%. Other approaches are based on 
engaging staff and include granting awards for long term staff. 87. 
Finally,  " recruiting back "  health professionals to the health workforce is a policy raising growing 
interest as there is a pool of health workers, especially nurses who are either inactive or work in another 
sector. But, to date this interest has not been translated into a specific policy. For instance, 14% of the 
Registered Nurses and Midwives who purchased an Annual Practicing Certificate in 2000 were either in 
non-nursing or midwifery job, or not in paid employment. This percentage was even higher for enrolled 
nurses (21%) (New Zealand Health Information Service, New Zealand Nurses and Midwives 2000, 
NZHIR, 2002). A study on this particular group found that 76% of registered nurses and midwives, and 
79% of enrolled nurses, would consider returning to the clinical workforce (New Zealand Health 
Information Service, Non-practicing nurses and midwives 2000, NZHIS, 2000). The survey also found that 
the main factors that would attract nurses back to the clinical workforce were more flexible hours of work, 
availability of return-to-work programmes, salary increases, and provision of child-care facilities. For 
enrolled nurses, an improved image of nursing was also a major factor. Retention in, and return to, New Zealand 88. 
 " Recruiting back "  health worker who emigrated is also attracting more attention. In theory, there 
is big pool of potential  " returnees "  for New Zealand to attract. Efforts are underway to better understand 
why people leave through exit surveys, and strategies to attract back health workers who went overseas are 
being developed. Alumni programs exist at the Wellington and Auckland public hospitals in order to 
maintain contact between the hospital and former nurses. 89. 
At the same time, there is an acknowledgement that many leave, at least temporarily, especially 
to Australia, and, to a certain extent, a general acceptance that young individuals will leave New Zealand 
for an overseas experience. In health occupations, a nursing career is even sometimes promoted as 
allowing travels around the world. Higher wages, especially for junior doctors who have to reimburse their 
student loan, professional opportunities and the quest for a new lifestyle are among the main factors 
motivating health professionals to migrate from New Zealand. 90. 
Retention of junior doctors is a serious concern in New Zealand. As depicted in Chart 16, by the 
third year after graduation, approximately 30% of doctors from a graduate year will be lost. This retention 
rate has showed little change over the past decade. 21 It can also be noted that about 10% of graduate 
students do not register immediately after graduation; this figure reached almost 20% in 2004. As for 
foreign-trained doctors, data on retention show a marked decrease in the first year after registration. In the 
year after initial registration, less than 50% of international medical graduates remain in New Zealand 
(Medical Council, 2006). This percentage is 33% in the third year after registration. This illustrates the 
short-term pattern of the migration of health professionals to New Zealand, casting doubts on the role that 
migration might play to address long-term supply needs. Reasons for low retention rates could be due inter 
alia to a strong preference for short-term stays, remigration to other OECD countries or difficulties in 
getting qualifications fully recognized. Further analysis should be carried out to disentangle these different 
factors and identify appropriate policy responses. 21 The first-year retention of 101% for the 2004 graduates is rather high and may be due to either doctors who 
completed their internship overseas or took a year off before registering in the following year. DELSA/HEA/WD/HWP(2008)3 40 Chart 16. Percentage of New Zealand graduates and overseas-trained doctors retained in the New Zealand

Over time, the number of health professionals leaving New Zealand has increased. Data on long-
term and permanent departures 22 indicate that the number of departures of health professionals (excluding 
nursing) from New Zealand grew moderately (from 689 in 1992 to 843 in 2006) while for nurses it almost 
doubled (674 in 1992 and 1 147 in 2006) (see Chart 17). Chart 17. Yearly long term and permanent arrivals and departures of health professionals (except nursing) and

Departure 92. 
Since 2001, long-term and permanent departure and arrival data are also available by place of 
birth. It shows a constant negative net migration for nurses born in New Zealand. The figure averages at 
300 a year, corresponding to about 25% of the nurses graduating each year. The yearly net outflow for 
New Zealand born health professionals (except nursing) is more limited as it reaches about 100. 93. 
Australia attracts a large share of New Zealand health professionals. Geographical proximity, 
cultural similarity, and higher wages, all contribute to this emigration.In addition, except for medical 
professionals, migration is also facilitated by the Trans-Tasman Mutual Recognition Arrangement 
(TTMRA) between Australia and New Zealand signed in 1996. The TTMRA established that a person 
registered to practice an occupation in New Zealand is entitled to practise an equivalent occupation in 
Australia (and inversely) without the need to undergo further testing or examination. Movement between 
New Zealand and Australia is also facilitated by the existence of transnational Medical Colleges that set up 
similar requirements for post-graduate medical training in both Australia and New Zealand. 22 Cautious should be exercised when discussing arrival and departure data, as arrivals and departures data do 
not reflect persons but indicate movements. Hence, one person can be counted more than once. DELSA/HEA/WD/HWP(2008)3 41 94. 
Australia is the major destination country for New Zealand health professionals, but the converse 
is not true. While in the 2001 census the number of New Zealand-born doctors and nurses in Australia is 
estimated at 1 086 and 5 443, respectively, Australian-born doctors and nurses in New Zealand amounted 
only to 180 and 582, respectively. In 2001, 59% of New Zealand-born medical doctors living overseas 
were in Australia (51% for dentists, 72% for pharmacists and 72% for nurses), whereas only 9.3% of 
Australian-born doctors living overseas were in New Zealand (4% for dentists, 12.5% for pharmacists and 
13.5% for nurses). Nonetheless, in relative terms, the proportion of Australian-born health professionals in 
New Zealand among health professionals and New Zealand-born health professionals in Australia are very 
similar, at approximately 2%. 95. 
In terms of outflows of New Zealand doctors, the average annual number of arrivals (settlers, and 
permanent and long-terms stays) in Australia is estimated around 330 per year for the period 1998-2006 
(see Chart 18). The corresponding average for nurses is just over 800. These out-migration flows are of 
large magnitude for a country like New Zealand, compared to the annual number of new nursing and 
medical graduates. Chart 18. Yearly permanent and long term arrivals of New Zealand doctors and nurses to Australia, 1998-2006 Note. Data refer to permanent and long term movements and settlers arrivals of doctors

The relative importance of migration flows from New Zealand to Australia, and the fact that 
some migrants were perceived as using New Zealand as 'a revolving door' into Australia, especially 
throughout the 1990s, led Australia to adopt restrictive measures against New Zealanders. In 2001, it was 
required for New Zealanders to obtain permanent residence if they wished to gain access to social security, 
to have citizenship or to sponsor other people for permanent residence. Otherwise, New Zealanders must 
wait two years before being eligible for social benefits. 23 While these restrictions applied to New 
Zealanders in Australia, the converse did not apply. At the end of the 90's, New Zealanders were also 
affected by a measure aimed at discouraging the immigration of doctors. It was decided that all doctors 
entering Australia (including those trained in New Zealand) would not be allowed to bill on the Medicare 
system (Medicare is Australia's public universal health system) until ten years after they had gained 
accreditation. However, this period of ten years is reduced to five years for doctors working in rural and 
remote areas (defined at State level), and does not apply for those working in District Workforce Shortage 
areas (defined at Federal level). The immediate impact of these measures can be seen on Chart 18 which 
shows a decrease in long-term and permanent arrivals of doctors from New Zealand to Australia after 
2001. 23 Poot and Sanderson (2007) show that these policy changes affected the duration of stay and the likelihood 
of return migration from Australia to New Zealand. DELSA/HEA/WD/HWP(2008)3 42 97. 
Emigration of young new Zealanders is a matter of concern although having international 
experience is strongly encouraged as a way of capitalising knowledge and skills. The key question is: how 
many come back and when? Unfortunately, evidence to answer these questions is scarce, especially in 
terms of specific occupations. The new Zealand Government has recently developed a program to foster 
return migration in general (tax reduction or immunities for those who have been abroad for more than 15 
years, facilitated procedure for the immigration of the partner, etc.), but these measures need to be further 
evaluated. 2.4 Retirement 98. 
In a context of health workforce ageing, retirement is an important factor to monitor. The ageing 
of the health workforce is a major change observed in most OECD countries. However, specific 
information about the retirement rate of health workers is rather scarce. The statutory pensionable age 
often differs from the actual age of retirement. Evidence suggests that some independent health workers 
continue working after they have reached pensionable age. At the same time, workers in many countries 
are choosing to retire earlier. This trend seems to be taking hold among health workers as well and is likely 
to be reinforced by the increasing presence of women, who retire earlier than their male counterparts. 99. 
In New Zealand, older workers are an increasing share of the health workforce (Ministry of 
Health, 2006a). While in 1990, 35% of the medical workforce was under 35 years of age, this figure had 
fallen to 22% in 2004 (Health Workforce Advisory Committee, 2005). As the proportion of older doctors 
and nurses is increasing, substantial retirement outflows can therefore be expected within the next decades. 
The RNZCGP 2005 Membership survey indicates that retirement is the single most mentioned factor likely 
to influence future work intentions (RNZCGP, 2005 RNZCGP Membership Survey: workforce series 2, 
2006). For nurses, it is estimated that about 365 nurses or 1.1% retire each year (Department of Labour, 
2005a). DELSA/HEA/WD/HWP(2008)3 43 3. FUTURE PERSPECTIVES 100. 
The New Zealand health system will face serious challenges in the future. Future demand for 
healthcare services is expected to increase while future supply is thought to be insufficient. As a result, 
health worker shortages are predicted if nothing is undertaken. 101. 
Population ageing and its future impact on the demand for health workforce is perceived as a 
major issue in New Zealand. It is projected that while total population will increase by 16% between 2001 
and 2021, the corresponding figure will be 72% for people aged 65 and over (NZIER 2004). The 
percentage increase for Māori and Pacific Islander people is expected to be even greater. 102. 
As a result of population ageing, long-term care costs are also expected to rise. Projections of 
public health spending for long-term care for the period 2005 and 2050 suggest that the increase in public 
spending on long-term care, in percentage points of GDP, will vary between 1.2 and 2% for New Zealand, 
which is very similar to the OECD average ranging between 1.3 and 2.2% (Bjornerud et al., 2006). 103. 
On the supply side, various trends need to be taken into consideration. In particular, a move 
towards a better balance between work and leisure for health professionals, the introduction of new time 
directives limiting working hours of health professionals, in particular for junior doctors, and the 
feminisation of the medical workforce. 104. 
Relying on three different scenarios, an assessment of future demand and supply of health 
services was undertaken by the NZIER (NZIER 2004). Each scenario was based on different assumptions 
about population growth, morbidity rates and the onset of disease and disability in old age. According to 
the selected scenari, the demand for health services could increase by 40 to 69% between 2001 and 2021. 
Assuming that demand for labour will grow in line with the health service demands, the study finds that the 
demand for health professionals will outstrip supply by 2011. Depending on the scenario, the excess labour 
demand over supply is expected to be equivalent to between 19 0007 and 28 000 health professionals, or 
28% and 42% of the 2001 health workforce (NZIER, 2004). 105. 
Of course, these are only scenarios for the future not exact predictions. Moreover, it is not 
uncommon that predicted shortages or surpluses never materialize. Nonetheless, the results of this 
projection demonstrate the importance of having a health workforce policy to address future challenges. DELSA/HEA/WD/HWP(2008)3 44 4. CAN NEW ZEALAND COMPETE? 106. 
So far, immigration contributes to a large extent to the supply of health workers in New Zealand. 
However, increasing the number of overseas-trained health professionals might place New Zealand in a 
delicate position as it could become too dependent on migration. In this context, one can wonder about the 
sustainability of New Zealand policy in a context of increasing international competition to attract health 
workers. 107. 
In particular, ageing in the United Kingdom, United States, and Australia is likely to have an 
impact on labour demand for New Zealand and increase relative demand offshore for medical 
professionals. This would make the New Zealand trained health professionals harder to retain, and the 
potential pool of foreign recruits more difficult to attract. 108. 
Given the relative small size of its health workforce and its heavy reliance on immigration, a 
sudden change in the international migration flows, which could result from policy changes in OECD 
countries beyond control of New Zealand authorities, could have a dramatic impact on New Zealand. 
However, at the same time, taking into account the fact that the annual numbers of health professional 
immigrants to New Zealand are relatively small compared the scale of worldwide flows, it is most likely 
that New Zealand will be able to recruit the doctors and nurses it needs but at an increasing cost with 
increasing difficulties to attract the best skills. This will make the education option more attractive but 
taking into account the length of training it might require immediate action. 109. 
Furthermore, in order to compete more effectively, New Zealand would need to improve the 
critical issue of the retention of international health worker migrants, and in particular doctors. As 
mentioned previously, turnover is very important, as only 33% of international medical graduates remain 
in New Zealand after registration. A better management of health worker immigration necessitates 
improving retention. In other words, the sustainability of New Zealand health workforce policy is probably 
not so much jeopardized by the large reliance on immigration but rather by the failure to retain 
international health worker migrants in New Zealand on the medium and long term. DELSA/HEA/WD/HWP(2008)3 45 CONCLUDING REMARKS 110. 
Despite the key role of the health workforce in the health system, it has not been at the core of 
various health system reforms in New Zealand. Nonetheless, in recent years, health workforce issues have 
captured more attention, and there is now a growing recognition of its importance. Moreover, in the 
specific context of New Zealand, planning in health human resources is probably more of a challenge than 
in most other OECD countries because of the key role of in-and out-migration which are only partially 
determined by New Zealand policies. Increasing international competition for highly skilled workers raises 
important issues such as sustainability and ability to compete in a global market. In this context, new 
approaches to improve the international recruitment of health workers, as well as developing alternative 
policies, may need to be considered. 111. 
As for international recruitment, better coordination and stronger collaboration between the 
Ministry of Labour, the Ministry of Health and the DHBs could contribute to more effective and pertinent 
international recruitment. For instance, the MoH and DHBs could certainly make valuable contributions to 
the occupational shortage lists regarding the definition and discussion about health workforce shortages. 
Also, a better coordination between DHBs in terms of international recruitment would be desirable. For 
instance, a nationwide recruitment process could be considered. In addition, migration policy could also be 
used to address some the concerns about the quality of the provision of aged care. As most people working 
in aged care are unskilled, and an important share is coming from the Pacific Islands, developing bilateral 
agreements with the Pacific Islands in order to set up migration programs with a training component could 
be considered. 112. 
The increasing use of temporary migration gives rise to a large number of short-term stay of 
health workers in New Zealand, in particular for doctors. While locum schemes are certainly a good policy 
to address workforce shortages in rural areas, having a large number of migrants coming only for short-
term stays, raises issues of turnover and its associated costs in terms of recruitment and training costs. 
Moreover, in order to address rural–urban imbalances, refining the points system in the context of the 
migration policy could be considered. For instance, instead of awarding the same additional amount of 
points for people settling outside Auckland as is the case now, one could introduce a points system with 
greater regional variations, depending on the severity of health workforce shortages. 113. 
Improving wages and working conditions in the health sector, developing further skill-mix 
approaches, and attracting back health workers who have left New Zealand, are all complementary 
approaches that need further consideration. 114. 
While improving working conditions, skill mix and education are the object of a lot of attention 
in many countries, attracting back health workers who have left their country has not captured much 
attention so far. The complexity and the costs associated with such policies are likely to be a serious 
deterrent. However, as the pool of New Zealand-born nurses and doctors living in other OECD countries is 
so important—the number of New Zealand-born nurses living in other OECD countries is almost 
equivalent to the number of foreign-born nurses in New Zealand—it is certainly worth considering specific 
programs to attract back health workers, e.g. developing alumni networks, hospital twinning etc. Recent 
measures adopted by New Zealand to facilitate the return of New Zealanders from abroad are encouraging. 
In this context, focusing efforts on Australia and the United Kingdom would be natural as most New 
Zealand emigrant health worker move to those two countries. Strengthening collaboration between DELSA/HEA/WD/HWP(2008)3 46 Australia and New Zealand on health workforce policy issues could also be a way forward for both 
countries. 115. 
As for education, strengthening coordination between the main actors—DHBs, Tertiary 
Education Commission and the Clinical Training Agency—would facilitate the development of a global 
and common view, as emphasised in a recent report of the Health Workforce Taskforce (2007). DHBNZ 
has a potential to play a greater role in this context. The possibility of increasing the annual intake of 
medical students certainly deserves further investigation. Given the importance of immigration by doctors, 
increasing the number of doctors trained domestically would seem a serious option, especially since the 
number of graduates per 100 000 population in New Zealand is below the OECD average. Attracting more 
foreign students is also a promising route, especially taking into account the flexibility of the New Zealand 
migration system to accommodate status changes. This may imply, however, reconsidering the cost-
sharing of training costs for medical and nursing graduates. An issue which also applies to the case of New 
Zealanders as we have seen that indebtedness remains one of the main incentives for out migration. DELSA/HEA/WD/HWP(2008)3 47 BIBLIOGRAPHY Antonazzo, E., et al. (2003),  " The labour market for nursing: a review of the labour supply literature " ,
