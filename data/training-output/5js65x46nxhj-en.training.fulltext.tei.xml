			<head>...................................................................... 23<lb/> EXCESS CAPACITY IN THE GLOBAL STEEL INDUSTRY AND THE IMPLICATIONS OF<lb/> NEW INVESTMENT PROJECTS<lb/> by Anthony de Carvalho, Naoki Sekiguchi and Filipe Silva<lb/> OECD, Paris<lb/></head>

			<p>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS<lb/> Government and industry representatives participating in the OECD Steel Committee are<lb/> increasingly concerned about excess capacity in the global steel industry. Excess capacity has led to<lb/> deterioration in the financial situation of steelmakers and is raising questions about its impact on the<lb/> longer-term economic viability and efficiency of the industry. As a result, the OECD Steel Committee<lb/> plans to deepen its work on excess capacity in the next biennium. This paper combines two documents<lb/> that were declassified by the Steel Committee in early 2015, one that summarises the main policy issues<lb/> regarding excess capacity and one which focusses on monitoring new steel investment projects taking<lb/> place around the world. The Secretariat would like to thank all delegations that have contributed<lb/> actively to the Steel Committee&apos;s activities on excess capacity, particularly those that provided very<lb/> useful comments and feedback on the two papers that were combined to form this Policy Paper.<lb/> Nevertheless, any remaining errors or omissions are the responsibility of the Secretariat.<lb/></p>

			<head>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY<lb/></head>

			<p>Governments participating in the OECD Steel Committee consider excess capacity as being one of the<lb/> main challenges facing the global steel sector today. Following the Ministerial Council Meeting on<lb/> 6-7 May 2014, where Ministers stressed the need to address the issue of excess capacity in some industries<lb/> such as steel, the OECD Steel Committee has deepened its discussions on capacity, and will take this work<lb/> further in the next few years. To increase visibility of the key issues, the Steel Committee declassified two<lb/> papers linked to excess capacity in early 2015. Those two papers have been combined to form this Policy<lb/> Paper on excess steelmaking capacity and the implications of new investment projects.<lb/></p>

			<p>More specifically, this paper examines the extent, causes, and impacts of excess capacity in the global<lb/> steel industry, and provides detailed information on new investment projects that are taking place around<lb/> the world in order to help governments and industry better understand the extent to which excess<lb/> steelmaking capacity may evolve in the future. For readers interested in knowing further details about<lb/> investment developments taking place in the global steel industry, an Annex is provided that presents<lb/> tables with detailed information on the companies that are investing and the financial amounts involved,<lb/> the technologies being invested in, the ownership status of the projects and their expected starting date, as<lb/> well as some qualitative comments about the projects to provide context where needed.<lb/></p>

			<p>The results indicate that global steelmaking capacity will continue to expand, with regions that are<lb/> currently net importers of steel products expected to record the largest capacity increases. Of particular<lb/> importance for governments in this context will be to work towards removing market distorting policies such<lb/> as subsidies that promote the emergence of new capacity or delay the closure of failing companies. The main<lb/> findings of this paper are:<lb/> • Excess capacity remains high. The global steel industry&apos;s capacity to produce steel has more<lb/> than doubled since the early 2000s to support growing construction and manufacturing activity,<lb/> as well as to help build infrastructure particularly in emerging economies. With investment<lb/> projects continuing to increase in a number of economies, and while steel consumption growth is<lb/> anticipated to remain moderate, the global imbalance between capacity and demand will continue<lb/> to pose risks for the industry for the foreseeable future, unless more concerted efforts are made<lb/> by industry and governments to address the challenge. Global nominal steelmaking capacity is<lb/> projected to increase to 2.36 billion tonnes by 2017, up from 2.16 billion tonnes in 2013.<lb/> Non-OECD economies will continue to lead the capacity expansion in the global steel industry,<lb/> with their share of world capacity expected to increase to 71.4% by 2017.<lb/></p>

			<table>• Government interventions are contributing to global excess capacity. Specific concerns<lb/> related to government steel policies include continued government subsidies (notably subsidies<lb/> for the creation of new capacity or the maintenance of inefficient capacities) and continued<lb/> approvals for new steel facilities. Governments have also noted that trade related measures,<lb/> constraints on foreign investment, and the activities of government financial agencies are also<lb/> contributing to global excess capacity and creating difficulties for the industry in addition to<lb/> weak market conditions.<lb/></table>

			<head>1. Introduction<lb/></head>

			<p>Excess capacity is one of the main challenges facing the global steel sector today. The growing gap<lb/> between global steelmaking capacity and demand has led to deterioration in the financial situation of<lb/> steelmakers, and has raised concerns about the longer-term economic viability and efficiency of the<lb/> industry. Although excess capacity in the global steel industry has increased significantly since the<lb/> financial crisis, and despite slowing demand growth in global markets, there continues to be new<lb/> investment projects in many parts of the world.<lb/></p>

			<p>On the one hand, while the opening and closure of steel plants is usually based on the commercial<lb/> decisions of private companies, government interventions that support the building of new capacity or keep<lb/> inefficient facilities in operation can exacerbate the problem of global excess capacity and harm the<lb/> business conditions of efficient steel producers in all markets. On the other hand, policies that promote the<lb/> efficient restructuring of the industry or provide assistance to workers who may be displaced by the closure<lb/> of uneconomic mills can be useful tools to address the problem and promote greater stability in global steel<lb/> markets.<lb/> Following the Ministerial Council Meeting on 6-7 May 2014, where Ministers stressed the need to<lb/> address the issue of excess capacity in some industries such as steel, the OECD Steel Committee has<lb/> deepened its discussions on capacity, and will take this work further in the next few years. 1 In addition to<lb/> monitoring capacity developments, the Committee plans on examining government policies and their<lb/> effects on global excess capacity, with an aim to reach a common understanding about which policies:<lb/> i) promote a better functioning of the market and more efficient global steel industry; and ii) contribute to<lb/> excess steelmaking capacity by distorting trade and competition in domestic and global markets.<lb/> This paper examines the extent, reasons and impacts of excess capacity in the global steel industry, as<lb/> well as the implications of new investment projects that continue to take place at a rapid pace in many parts<lb/> of the world. By focussing on new investment projects taking place in the global steel industry, this study<lb/> intends to help governments and industry better understand the extent to which global steelmaking excess<lb/> capacity may evolve in the future. The information on individual investment projects presented in the<lb/> Annex of this paper is also provided via an online database available to the public at<lb/> www.oecd.org/sti/steel. 2<lb/> This Policy Paper finds that global steelmaking capacity will continue to expand, with regions that are<lb/> currently net importers of steel products expected to record the largest capacity increases. Global nominal<lb/> steelmaking capacity is projected to increase to 2.36 billion tonnes by 2017, up from 2.16 billion tonnes in<lb/> 2013. Non-OECD economies will continue to lead the capacity expansion in the global steel industry, with<lb/> their share of world capacity expected to increase to 71.4% by 2017. Of particular importance for<lb/> governments in this context will be to work towards removing market distorting policies such as subsidies<lb/> that promote the emergence of new capacity or delay the closure of failing companies.<lb/> The remainder of the paper is organised as follows. The next two sections briefly summarise the<lb/> extent and reasons for global excess capacity. The fourth section provides an overview of steel projects<lb/> currently taking place around the world, but leaves details about the types of equipment and furnaces that<lb/> companies are investing in for the tables in the Annex. The final two sections summarise some of the<lb/> OECD&apos;s work on the impacts of excess capacity and what should be done to address the challenge. Again,<lb/> readers interested in the details of investment projects by company and region are invited to refer to the<lb/> Annex or to the above-mentioned online database.<lb/></p>

			<head>2. What is the extent of global excess capacity?<lb/></head>

			<p>The global steel industry&apos;s capacity to produce steel has increased rapidly since the early 2000s, after<lb/> two decades of little growth. Most of the growth in steelmaking capacity has occurred in non-OECD<lb/> economies, to support growing construction and manufacturing activity, as well as to help build the<lb/> infrastructure necessary for the economic development of these emerging economies. The world&apos;s nominal<lb/> steelmaking capacity is estimated to have reached 2 241 million metric tonnes (mmt) in 2014, according to<lb/> the OECD Secretariat, a level that is more than twice as high as the 1 060 mmt capacity level observed in<lb/> 2000. With investment projects continuing to take place in many parts of the world, nominal global<lb/> steelmaking capacity is expected to climb by a further 120 mmt in the period to 2017, bringing total<lb/> worldwide capacity to 2 361 mmt. At that point, non-OECD economies are expected to account for<lb/> approximately 71.4% of the world&apos;s total capacity (<ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<figure>Figure 1. Nominal crude steel capacity in OECD and Non-OECD economies<lb/> Source: OECD Secretariat.<lb/></figure>

			<p>Whether or not excess capacity arises is a function of whether demand has kept pace with this rapid<lb/> growth in supply. Although the industry is emerging from a severe cyclical downturn that was triggered by<lb/> the global economic and financial crisis of 2008-2009, demand recovery has been uneven and sluggish in<lb/> many economies. In 2013, crude steel demand stood at 1 648 mmt, or about 516 mmt below nominal<lb/> capacity, representing one of the highest gaps in the history of the global steel industry (<ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>). With<lb/> investment projects continuing to increase in a number of economies while steel consumption growth is<lb/> anticipated to remain moderate, the global imbalance will continue to pose risks for the industry for the<lb/></p>

			<p>OECD<lb/> Non-OECD<lb/> foreseeable future, unless more concerted efforts are made by industry and governments to address the<lb/> challenge.<lb/> However, it is important to note that measures of excess capacity cannot be imputed directly from the<lb/> gap between nominal capacity and demand. Indeed, it is not economic for the steel industry to run at full<lb/> capacity, even when pricing is attractive and companies appear to be maximising their output. During the<lb/> peak of the pre-crisis price upturn in the first half of 2008, for example, monthly global capacity utilisation<lb/> did not rise above 91%. 1 Seasonal factors as well as the need to occasionally close down operations to<lb/> refurbish steel plants and add new facilities tend to reduce the effective capacity of steel mills.<lb/></p>

			<head>3. What are the reasons for global excess capacity?<lb/></head>

			<p>The main factors that contribute to capacity imbalances in the steel industry include market downturns,<lb/> but also a number of government interventions and other market-distorting practices. As noted above, for<lb/> most steel mills, it is normal to have periods of under-utilised capacity. When demand and prices of steel<lb/> fall, profit-maximising firms should reduce production and thus leave a certain amount of capacity idle.<lb/> Profits will tend to be lower because the firms still have to finance their fixed assets, including their under-<lb/>utilised steelmaking furnaces and rolling facilities. If the situation persists over time, however, then firms<lb/> operating under normal market conditions would try to minimise their fixed costs by scaling back on<lb/> capacity, thus making excess capacity a short-run phenomenon. History has nevertheless demonstrated that<lb/> the adjustment process can be long and arduous in the steel industry, with some regions experiencing<lb/> extended periods of excess capacity.<lb/> 1 .<lb/> Monthly capacity utilisation rates are according to World Steel Association data.<lb/></p>

			<figure>0<lb/> 100<lb/> 200<lb/> 300<lb/> 400<lb/> 500<lb/> 600<lb/> 700<lb/> 500<lb/> 700<lb/> 900<lb/> 1100<lb/> 1300<lb/> 1500<lb/> 1700<lb/> 1900<lb/> 2100<lb/> 2300<lb/> 2500<lb/> Million tonnes<lb/> Million tonnes<lb/> Capacity/Demand gap (RHS)<lb/> Capacity (LHS)<lb/> Demand (LHS)<lb/></figure>

			<p>On the one hand, this can be due to high exit barriers, namely the costs of closure that discourage<lb/> rapid adjustments in capacity. For example, capacity closures entail high costs of dismantling the mills,<lb/> potential clean-up and other environmental and labour-related costs. In the face of market uncertainty firms<lb/> may choose to delay exit rather than incur such costs. Expectations about future market conditions may<lb/> also be contributing to current excess capacity; for example, steelmakers in some countries are investing<lb/> heavily today in new steel production facilities in anticipation of much higher demand several years from<lb/> now.<lb/></p>

			<p>On the other hand, excess capacity that persists over time can also be indicative of government actions<lb/> that hinder adjustments that would normally occur in competitive markets. Due to the importance and<lb/> strategic nature of the steel industry to many national economies, a tendency during market downturns is to<lb/> preserve the capacity of the industry, in order to alleviate unemployment and other social problems that<lb/> would otherwise occur due to capacity closures. In addition, in some large net steel-importing regions,<lb/> governments are also interested in moving towards greater &quot; self-sufficiency &quot; in steel production in order to<lb/> reduce their dependency on imports. Research by the Secretariat shows that, despite current market conditions, a<lb/> large number of new projects are taking place, which will increase global crude steelmaking capacity<lb/> significantly in the coming years.<lb/></p>

			<p>In the current context, recent discussions at the OECD Steel Committee have suggested that in some<lb/> regions excess capacity reflects temporary factors related to the business cycle while in other cases it<lb/> reflects structural factors connected to government interventions. Specific concerns related to government<lb/> steel policies include continued government subsidies (notably subsidies for the creation of new capacity<lb/> or the maintenance of inefficient capacities) and continued approvals for new steel facilities. Governments<lb/> have also noted that trade related measures, constraints on foreign investment, and the activities of<lb/> government financial agencies are also contributing to global excess capacity and creating difficulties for<lb/> the industry in addition to weak market conditions. And finally, policy measures which discourage<lb/> &quot;optimal&quot; exit of the least productive plants may also contribute to excess capacity.<lb/></p>

			<head>4. Future investment projects in the global steel industry<lb/> 4.1. Brief summary of regional investment developments<lb/></head>

			<p>Since the start of the 21 st century, many blast furnaces have been built around the world, particularly<lb/> in Asia (see Box 1). That region will continue to lead BF/BOF capacity expansions, supported by large-<lb/>scale integrated projects. As a consequence, the BF/BOF route is likely to remain the major technology for<lb/> iron/steelmaking, despite the announcement of many mini-mill projects in recent years. However, this<lb/> paper shows that regional differences are very large. Detailed information can be found in the tables in the<lb/> Annex, while a summary of key developments by region is provided below:<lb/></p>

			<table>• There are no capacity additions being planned in the European Union.<lb/> • In the region referred to as &quot; Other Europe &quot; , 3 crude steelmaking capacity is forecast to increase<lb/> to 64.4 million tonnes per year (tpy) by 2017. All of the increase in this region will occur in<lb/> Turkey, where many EAF projects are taking place. In line with EAF capacity expansions,<lb/> imports of scrap are expected to grow further in &quot; Other Europe &quot; . Iron ore imports into the region<lb/> are also expected to increase to some extent as some projects are intensive in iron ore/coking coal.<lb/> • In the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) region, steel mills are replacing out-dated<lb/> OHFs with BOF and EAF furnaces. Numerous EAF projects have been planned, which may<lb/> result in higher future scrap demand. Nevertheless, the BOF process is likely to remain the main<lb/> production process in the region. As a consequence of several investment projects, steelmaking<lb/> capacity in the region is expected to reach 152.9 million tpy by 2017.<lb/> • In the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA)</table>

			<p>region, the share of EAF in steel<lb/> production is expected to rise due to many DRI-based mini-mill projects, supported by the shale<lb/> gas boom and the relatively low natural gas prices associated with this development. DRI is<lb/> expected to be an increasingly important feedstock for producers in the region. Steelmaking<lb/> capacity in the region is projected to increase from 158.0 million tpy in 2013 to 163.5 million tpy<lb/> in 2017.<lb/></p>

			<p>• In Latin America, BOF&apos;s share is likely to grow in the future owing to many greenfield slab-for-<lb/>export projects, even though some projects have been postponed. Also, some projects in the long<lb/> products segment are under way. As a result of these investment projects, steelmaking capacity in<lb/> the region is forecast to reach 77.4 million tpy by 2017.<lb/></p>

			<p>• Although Africa is still reliant on imports to meet demand, some DRI-based mini-mill projects<lb/> are expected to raise the region&apos;s self-sufficiency (domestic production as a share of demand)<lb/> gradually. Steel production via the EAF route is expected to remain the major steelmaking<lb/> process. Steelmaking capacity in the region is forecast to increase from 33.2 million tpy in 2013<lb/> to 40.2 million tpy by 2017.<lb/> • In the Middle East, steelmaking is expected to be predominantly EAF-based, and the preferred<lb/> feedstock would remain DRI (due to natural gas availability). Many DRI-based EAF projects<lb/> have been announced recently in the region, and are expected to contribute to reducing import<lb/> dependency. The region&apos;s production capacity is projected to increase to 69.5 million tpy by 2017.<lb/> • In China, steel production via the BOF route is expected to continue to play a dominant role in<lb/> steelmaking. However, EAF&apos;s share could gradually increase in the future, along with the<lb/> increasing availability of scrap, thus affecting the balance between BOF and EAF technologies.<lb/> Steelmaking capacity in the country is expected to reach 1.1 billion tpy by 2017. 4<lb/></p>

			<p>• Although EAF is still the major steelmaking process in India, BOF&apos;s share may increase<lb/> significantly, supported by new investment projects that are iron ore/coking coal-intensive. The<lb/> country&apos;s crude steelmaking capacity was estimated to have reached more than 100 million tpy in<lb/> 2013, and is expected to continue to increase to a level of 132.7 million tpy by 2017.<lb/> • In ASEAN-6, BOF&apos;s share in the region&apos;s crude steel production is expected to increase<lb/> gradually due to many BF/BOF investment projects. Therefore, iron ore/coking coal are expected<lb/> to become important raw materials for the region. Scrap imports have also been increasing due to<lb/> several mini-mill projects. The region&apos;s total steelmaking capacity is expected to increase to<lb/> 58.8 million tpy by 2017.<lb/></p>

Asia will continue to lead the capacity expansion in terms of the BF/BOF process<lb/> Since the start of the 21st century, Asia has experienced a steel mill construction boom, supported by<lb/> investments in many large-sized blast furnaces (with inner volumes of more than 2000 m<lb/> 3 ). The figure below maps<lb/> blast furnaces with inner volumes greater than 2000 m3 in Asia compared to the rest of the world.

Compared with other regions, Asian integrated mills are<lb/> typically more modern and have a larger capacity.

			<p>The EAF route is common in Turkey and the country has one of the highest shares of EAF output in<lb/> the world. However, the BF/BOF route has gained some importance in recent years. 5 Platts (2014b)<lb/> recently reported that the Turkish government plans to reduce the domestic industry&apos;s dependency on scrap<lb/> by providing more incentives for domestic iron ore and ferro-alloy production. This could encourage a<lb/> change in the structure of steel production in favour of BOF based integrated mills. The Turkish industry<lb/> aims to reach 85 mmt of steelmaking capacity and 70 mmt of steel production by 2023 (ISPAT, 2013).<lb/> Major projects taking place in Turkey include:<lb/> • Kardemir (one of Turkey&apos;s three integrated steelmakers) has begun to fire up its new blast<lb/> furnace No. 5 with an inner volume of 1 280 m 3 at its Karabuk works in the northern part of the<lb/> country. As a result, and also due to converter upgrades, its crude steel capacity is expected to<lb/> increase to 3.4 million tpy. Habas has just entered the flat product market in Turkey with a new<lb/> hot strip mill (2.5 million tpy of capacity) and is now building an electric steelmaking complex<lb/> with a capacity of 3 million tpy.<lb/></p>

			<head>4.2.2. The Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS)<lb/></head>

			<p>In the CIS region, numerous mini-mill projects have been planned, reflecting good prospects for the<lb/> construction sector at least before the recent political unrest. However, the BF/BOF route is likely to<lb/> remain the main process in the region. 6 <ref type="biblio">Between 2003 and 2013</ref>, the share of crude steel production via the<lb/> EAF route has risen from 13.5% to 24.4%, according to World Steel Association data. The growth in EAFs<lb/> (notably in Russia) should have a significant impact on scrap demand. Scrap demand may surpass<lb/> domestic collection due to new EAFs, though some integrated producers — equipped with both BOFs and<lb/> EAFs — have an option to increase the use of pig iron in their EAFs in order to reduce their dependence on<lb/> scrap (<ref type="biblio">Platts, 2012</ref>). Some important developments include the following:<lb/> Russian electric arc furnace steelmaking is expanding and the government expects the share of EAF<lb/> production to reach 39% by 2020 (<ref type="biblio">Platts, 2014c</ref>). 7 Between 2013 and 2014, some long product mini-mills<lb/> were commissioned to meet steel demand from the growing construction sector in the country. Abinsk<lb/> Electrometallurgical Plant and NLMK Kaluga commissioned their new EAF melting shops, both with a<lb/> capacity greater than 1 million tpy. Furthermore, Severstal aimed to begin commercial-scale production at<lb/> its 1 million tpy mini-mill in Balakovo (in central Russia&apos;s Saratov region) by the end of the second quarter<lb/> of 2014.<lb/></p>

			<head>4.2.3. North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA)<lb/></head>

			<p>In NAFTA, some steelmakers are exploring opportunities for building DRI-based plants. Several DRI<lb/> plant projects have been announced in recent years to take advantage of shale gas developments. DRI<lb/> provides opportunities for mini-mill steelmakers to minimize the impact of typically more volatile steel<lb/> scrap markets (AMM, 2013). Growing DRI production is also likely to affect demand for substitute<lb/> materials such as pig iron and scrap. EAF&apos;s share of steel production in the NAFTA region is expected to<lb/> rise due to both DRI and scrap-based EAF projects. The upstream (crude) projects that are underway in the<lb/> region include:<lb/></p>

			<table>• Some DRI technology suppliers forecast DRI capacity in the United States could reach<lb/> 10 million tpy by 2020 (Platts, 2014d and 2014e). On 24 December 2013, Nucor commissioned<lb/> its first DRI facility with a capacity of 2 million tpy in Louisiana. Moreover, the European<lb/> integrated steelmaker Voestalpine is investing USD 740 million to build a 2 million tpy DRI<lb/> plant in Texas. Also, Big River Steel broke ground on its USD 1.3 billion EAF-based steel mill in<lb/> Osceola, Arkansas on 24 September 2014.<lb/> • In Mexico, some mini-mill projects are underway to meet growing demand from the construction<lb/> sector. For example, Talleres y Aceros (Tyasa) has been testing its new EAF with a capacity of<lb/> 1.2 million tpy in Orizaba. In addition to this, Altos Hornos de México (Ahmsa)&apos;s 1.5 million tpy<lb/> EAF, (part of its USD 1.5 billion Fenix program) is expected to be commissioned in 2014.<lb/> Gerdau Corsa&apos;s new EAF plant is expected to come on stream in 2015.<lb/></table>

			<head>4.2.4. Latin America<lb/></head>

			<p>In Latin America, many greenfield slab-for-export projects have been announced by major mining<lb/> groups. However, some projects have been postponed due to reasons such as the global economic<lb/> slowdown, weak markets and logistical problems. Most of the capacity expansion projects in Latin<lb/> America will occur in Brazil, where some new slab projects are currently in progress. Some projects in the<lb/> region are starting in the long products segment to meet demand for construction steel. Major projects<lb/> occurring in Brazil are provided below.<lb/></p>

			<table>• Future slab maker Companhia Siderúrgica do Pecém (CSP) is a joint venture between Brazilian<lb/> mining group Vale (50%) and Korean steel producers Dongkuk Steel (30%) and POSCO (20%).<lb/> The project is expected to begin producing 3 million tpy of slabs in December 2015. CSP&apos;s first<lb/> export shipment is scheduled for March 2016 through the Port of Pecém, in north-eastern Ceará<lb/> State. Apart from this project, another two slab projects — Acos Laminados do Para plant<lb/> (ALPA) and Companhia Siderurgica Ubu (CSU) — have been planned in the country. 8<lb/></table>

			<head>4.2.5. Africa<lb/></head>

			<p>Currently, Africa is aiming to lower its dependence on imports through various upstream projects.<lb/> Although Egypt and South Africa have played a key role in supplying steel products in Africa, the region<lb/> still has a low self-sufficiency rate. To increase its self-sufficiency and press forward with industrialisation,<lb/> many upstream projects (mainly DRI based mini-mill plants) have been planned. These projects are<lb/> concentrated in North Africa and have the objective of supplying steel for housing and infrastructure<lb/> projects. The DRI-EAF route has been the preferred steelmaking technology in the region due to its lower<lb/> capital expenditure requirements and because the region has a shortage of steel scrap. 9 Projects taking<lb/> place in some of the major producing countries in Africa include:<lb/> • Many DRI-EAF projects are underway in Egypt. However, the country is experiencing a shortage<lb/> in natural gas allocation, which has delayed the launch of a number of</p>

			<table>steelworks. 10 Ezz Steel, the<lb/> largest steel producer in Egypt and North Africa, is expected to commission its 1.8 million tpy<lb/> DRI plant and a 850 000 tpy EAF by end-2014. Moreover, Beshay Steel, the second largest<lb/> steelmaker in Egypt, is building a 1.76 million tpy DRI and 1.3 million tpy EAF. Egyptian Steel<lb/> is building an EAF-based steelworks in Beni Suef and Sokhna that will each have a capacity of<lb/> 850 000 tpy of square billet.<lb/> • Algeria is one of the fastest steel-consuming markets in Africa due to government plans to build<lb/> infrastructure facilities (OECD, 2014). With domestic steelmakers not producing enough to meet<lb/> growing demand for steel, the government announced in mid-2011 that it would invest<lb/> considerable amounts over five years to boost domestic steel production (Oxford Business Group,<lb/> 2012). Most of the capacity additions will be implemented by state-owned companies. For<lb/> example, the governments of Qatar and Algeria have decided to enter into a joint venture, the<lb/> Algerian Qatari Solb Company. Moreover, state-owned Sider and ArcelorMittal aim to boost<lb/> capacity at their Annaba plant.<lb/> • In South Africa, ArcelorMittal South Africa is a major producer, accounting for more than 70%<lb/> of the country&apos;s steel production (Kumba Iron Ore, 2011). However, large scale steel plant<lb/> projects have been announced in the country recently. China&apos;s state-owned Hebei Iron &amp; Steel<lb/> (Hegang) announced plans to build a 5 million tpy greenfield steelworks to be supplied by output<lb/> from its iron ore mine in the country. 11 On 10 September 2014, Hegang signed a memorandum of<lb/> understanding with China-Africa Development Fund and the South African government&apos;s<lb/> Industrial Development Corp. for developing Hegang&apos;s steelworks project in South Africa. This<lb/> steel plant will be China&apos;s largest steel mill outside the Chinese mainland (WSJ, 2014).<lb/></table>

			<head>4.2.6. Middle East<lb/></head>

			<p>With oil-exporting countries within the Gulf Cooperation Council aiming to diversify their economies<lb/> (IMF, 2014), steel demand from downstream industries is expected to expand in the region. Many projects<lb/> have been announced recently in the Middle East, often with the objective to reduce import dependency. 12<lb/> However, these developments have led to concerns that the industry&apos;s expansion might lead to over-supply<lb/> issues in the region, particularly in the square billet market (Metal Expert, 2014a). Steelmaking is<lb/> predominantly EAF-based, and the preferred feedstock is DRI, owing to plentiful (and thus relatively low<lb/> priced) natural gas availability in the region. 13 DRI is generally expected to remain a major feedstock in<lb/> EAF steelmaking, and the EAF process, in turn, is expected to continue to play a dominant role in<lb/> steelmaking route in the region. Major projects taking place in the Middle East include:<lb/></p>

			<p>Iran aims to expand its steelmaking capacity to 55 million tpy by 2025 (<ref type="biblio">Reuters, 2014</ref>). Most new<lb/> plants will be based on the DRI-EAF route. The country has significant resources of iron ore deposits and<lb/> low-cost natural gas, and these factors are affecting the choice of raw materials used to produce steel in<lb/> Iran. Although eight new steelworks have been under construction by state-owned IMIDRO since 2006,<lb/> and numerous projects have been announced, a number of projects were put on hold because of financing<lb/></p>

			<table>constraints caused by economic sanctions. 14 Currently, Middle East Mines Industries Development Holding<lb/> Company (MIDHCO) is involved in three greenfield projects in the country: Butia Steel Company (BISCO),<lb/> Sirjan Iranian Steel Company (SISCO) and Zarand Iron &amp; Steel Company (ZISCO).<lb/></table>

			<p>In Oman, growing steel demand (driven by construction activity) is encouraging domestic producers<lb/> to increase their capacities and is attracting new investors to the steel industry. Scrap consumption is<lb/> expected to grow due to capacity expansion projects, while some companies plan to install DRI modules<lb/> because domestic scrap collectors may not be able to supply enough material for several years (<ref type="biblio">Metal<lb/> Expert, 2014b</ref>). An example of capacity expansion projects can be found in Jindal Shadeed Iron and<lb/> Steel&apos;s project, which involves a 2 million tpy EAF steelmaking complex, including a DRI module. Sun<lb/> Metals and Moon <ref type="biblio">Iron &amp; Steel (MISCO)</ref> also plan to install EAF facilities.<lb/> Saudi Arabia is currently experiencing fast-growing demand for electricity driven by population<lb/> growth and industrial development (NOREF, 2013). Although a shortage in natural gas allocation and<lb/> electricity generation capacity has delayed the launch of a number of steelworks in the country, many EAF<lb/> projects are currently underway to balance billet imports. 15 For example, Saudi Iron &amp; Steel Company, the<lb/> largest integrated steelmaker in the Middle East, started trial runs at its sixth electric arc furnace of<lb/> 1 million tpy in February 2014. Also, Arkan Steel and Al Atoun Steel are building EAF-based plants.<lb/></p>

			<head>4.2.7. China<lb/></head>

			<p>Currently, the Chinese government is making efforts to restructure the steel industry, increase its<lb/> efficiency and remove some excess capacity (EY, 2014). In October 2013, China&apos;s State Council released<lb/> a Guideline (the Guideline to Resolve Serious Overcapacity), targeting the closure of 80 million tpy of<lb/> steel capacity by the end of 2017 (OECD, 2014), in addition to addressing overcapacity problems in the<lb/> cement, aluminium, plate glass and shipbuilding industries. Targets of the plan include reasonable capacity<lb/> utilisation, improved industrial concentration and structure, higher development quality, efficient<lb/> environmental protection, a normal level of profit margin and asset-liability ratio, and a long-term effective<lb/> mechanism in self-regulating capacity.<lb/> The Guideline to Resolve Serious Overcapacity includes supply-side management measures, notably<lb/> the prohibition of new steel projects, the removal of existing illegal capacity, the enhancement of the entry<lb/> threshold, and phasing out the backward capacity by raising prices of power and water. Financial support<lb/> could be provided if difficulties linked to capacity shutdowns and unemployment arise. In addition, broad<lb/> demand side measures as well as systematic management measures will also be used to address<lb/> overcapacity. On the demand side, efforts will involve the construction sector&apos;s use of steel and improving<lb/> the standards of steel. Systematic management includes encouraging mergers and acquisitions of<lb/> enterprises to increase industrial concentration and reduce over-competition, among other efforts.<lb/></p>

			<figure>Since July 2014, China&apos;s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) has revealed lists<lb/> of steelmakers that should remove obsolete capacities. 16 Also, provincial governments were requested to<lb/> submit, by 30 June 2015, their targets for dismantling outdated and excess capacities in 2015 and during<lb/> the 13 th five-year (2016-2020) economic development plan (MIIT, 2014). 17<lb/> Some important coastal steelworks have been put into operation over the last few years in China:<lb/> Anshan Iron &amp; Steel commissioned its 6.5 million tpy Bayuquan works in Liaoning Province in 2008,<lb/> while Shougang Jingtang United Iron &amp; Steel completed its 9.7 million tpy works in Hebei Province in<lb/> 2010. Many projects have been announced in resource-rich inland regions. For example, Xinjiang&apos;s rich<lb/> raw material resources have attracted many steelmakers to invest in new capacities in the region. 18<lb/> Although the BOF production process will remain the dominant production process in China in the years to<lb/> come, the EAF share may increase gradually along with increasing availability of domestic scrap, but the<lb/> process is likely to take some time (Japan Metal Bulletin, 2014). 19 Despite a slowdown in China&apos;s capacity<lb/> growth rate compared to previous years, large steelworks that focus on the production of flat products are<lb/> being built in the country, namely:<lb/> Baosteel could commission the first of two 5 050 m 3 blast furnaces at its Zhanjiang steelworks<lb/> (Guangdong Province) by the end of September in 2015. The entire steelworks is expected to be<lb/> commissioned by June 2016. 20 On 26 September 2014, Wuhan Iron &amp; Steel Group set up the<lb/> Fangchenggang Steel Company Limited that would be responsible for the operations management of its<lb/> steel project in Guangxi Province. The new integrated steelworks is designed to be able to produce<lb/> 9.2 million tpy of crude steel with two 5 200 m 3 blast furnaces. Shandong Iron and Steel Group plans to<lb/> launch its 8.5 million tpy Rizhao steelworks in Shandong Province by the end of 2016, with two 5 100 m 3<lb/> blast furnaces.<lb/></figure>

			<p>• Other important projects are either underway or being planned. In China&apos;s Inner Mongolia,<lb/></p>

			<table>Baotou Iron &amp; Steel plans to build two 4 000 m 3 blast furnaces at a new integrated flat steel<lb/> works, which will have a crude steel capacity of 5 million tpy. Also, on 4 July 2014, a<lb/> memorandum of understanding for a total investment of USD 3.3 billion was officially signed<lb/> between Chongqing Iron &amp; Steel (Chonggang) and POSCO. The two companies will cooperate<lb/> to construct a plant using POSCO&apos;s FINEX technology.<lb/></table>

			<head>4.2.8. India<lb/></head>

			<p>Based on forecasts for steel consumption, India&apos;s authorities expect that steelmaking capacity may<lb/> have to increase to 300 million tpy by 2025-26 in order to meet future demand (Government of India,<lb/> Ministry of Steel, 2013). In order to reach that level of capacity, the industry may need to invest around<lb/> 12 trillion rupees, according to some news sources, with investment being concentrated in the mineral-rich<lb/> states of Odisha and Jharkhand (<ref type="biblio">Platts, 2014i</ref>). New investment projects that are iron ore/coking coal<lb/> intensive should have significant impacts on the balance between BOF and EAF production in the future.<lb/> Despite the declining trend over the last 10 years, BOF&apos;s share in Indian production is expected to grow<lb/> significantly as many BF/BOF projects have been announced or are currently being built in the country. 21<lb/> Many important BF/BOF projects are taking place in India, amongst which:<lb/></p>

			<table>• Some upstream projects are underway by state-owned companies that have already launched their<lb/> strategic plans. 22 National Mineral Development Corp (NMDC) has delayed commissioning of its<lb/> 3 million tpy integrated steel plant with a 4 506 m 3 blast furnace, currently under construction at<lb/> Nagarnar in the eastern state of Chhattisgarh. Steel Authority of India Ltd. (SAIL) is also building<lb/> two blast furnaces with inner volumes of 4 060 m 3 at IISCO Burnpur works and Bhilai works.<lb/> Also, India&apos;s leading private company, Tata Steel, expects to commission the first phase of its<lb/> 3 million tpy integrated mill by March 2015, including a 4 300 m 3 blast furnace.<lb/></table>

			<head>4.2.9. Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)<lb/></head>

			<p>Although the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) has traditionally been a large net<lb/> importer of steel, a steel mill construction boom has been taking place in the region, as well as in other<lb/> East Asian economies that export to ASEAN. 23 Many steel projects should support the increase in<lb/> ASEAN&apos;s self-sufficiency rate. However, these developments have led to concerns that the industry&apos;s<lb/> expansion might lead to over-supply problems (OECD, 2013a). DRI and scrap have been the major<lb/> feedstock for steel production in the region because production takes place primarily in EAF-based<lb/> facilities. However, BOF&apos;s share in the region&apos;s production is expected to increase gradually, thus affecting<lb/> the balance of steelmaking technologies and, ultimately, raw material demand. Below is a brief summary<lb/> of the major projects taking place in ASEAN.<lb/> • In Indonesia, investment in new steelmaking capacity is taking place in view of relatively<lb/> favourable demand prospects. Examples of investment projects include PT Krakatau POSCO,<lb/> which formally began operating its first blast furnace (the size of which is 3 950 m 3 ) on<lb/> 23 December 2013 in Cilegon. The plant has a capacity of 3 million tpy. This project is part of<lb/> Indonesia&apos;s Master Plan to accelerate economic development (OECD, 2013b). PT Krakatau<lb/> POSCO will make a decision on whether to proceed with the second stage expansion in 2015.<lb/> Moreover, PT Gunung Raja Paksi is building a 2 500 m 3 blast furnace with a capacity of<lb/> 1.5 million tpy in West Java, along with a sinter plant and a coke battery.<lb/> • In Viet Nam, strong steel demand growth has attracted many foreign investors and numerous<lb/> projects have been planned. According to the government of Viet Nam, capacity is targeted to<lb/> reach 40 million tpy of steel billets by</p>

			<table>2025 (Ministry of Industry and Trade of Vietnam, 2013).<lb/> Currently, some BF-BOF projects are underway in the country. For example, Formosa Ha Tinh<lb/> Steel Corp has already started construction, with the first phase of a 10.5 million tpy plant to be<lb/> fully commissioned by end-May 2017. 24 In addition, state-owned Vietnam Steel Corporation<lb/> (VSC) has commissioned its new steel plant. Also, POSCO Specialty Steel aims to officially<lb/> inaugurate its 1 million tpy EAF in Ba Ria-Vung Tau province either in December 2014 or<lb/> slightly thereafter. 25<lb/></table>

			<head>5. Concluding remarks<lb/></head>

			<p>Excessive levels of steelmaking capacity have important implications for the steel industry, often<lb/> associated with over-supply, low prices, weak profitability, bankruptcies and localised job losses.<lb/> Recent work conducted by the OECD has examined the financial health of the steel industry and<lb/> established a link between excess capacity and profitability. It has shown that the financial performance<lb/> of the industry is perhaps worse now than it was during the global steel crisis of the late 1990s, in large<lb/> part due to the significant excess capacity that exists today.<lb/> Given the global nature of the industry, excess capacity in one region can displace production in<lb/> other regions, thus harming producers in those markets and creating risks for trade actions and<lb/> government interventions to protect domestic industries. It can also lead to wasteful energy use and thus<lb/> have negative environmental impacts.<lb/></p>

			<p>Increased trade frictions are already visible amongst trading partners today. Subsidies and<lb/> government support measures that promote investment in steelmaking facilities or sustain companies in<lb/> distress that would otherwise shut down are a major source of this trade friction. Subsidies that<lb/> encourage steelmakers to keep production running at high levels, even under weak market conditions,<lb/> have had significant effects on trade, with unfair trade practices such as dumping having resulted in<lb/> injury to the industries of other economies.<lb/> In competitive economies, it is the responsibility of the steel companies themselves to identify<lb/> ways to adapt to changing market conditions. That is, businesses are best placed to decide on when to<lb/> invest in new capacity or when to scale it back when market conditions change. The role of<lb/> governments should be to allow market mechanisms to work properly and avoid measures that<lb/> artificially support steelmaking capacity.<lb/> A key priority, therefore, is to identify appropriate policy approaches to address excess capacity. In<lb/> this context, of particular importance for governments will be to work towards removing market<lb/> distorting policies such as subsidies that promote the emergence of new capacity or delay the closure of<lb/> failing companies, eliminating trade and investment barriers that slow the restructuring that is needed<lb/> for the industry, allowing market-based investment decisions in the steel sector, and ensuring that new<lb/> plants are subject to standards that protect the environment and uphold worker safety.<lb/> The OECD Steel Committee has continued to deepen its discussions on capacity, and plans to take<lb/> this work further in its programme of work and budget for 2015-2016. For example, the Committee&apos;s<lb/> programme of work calls for analyses of government policies and their implications for global excess<lb/> capacity developments, as well as maintaining a database of ongoing investment projects, including the<lb/> sources of finance for steel projects and any government support measures provided. At a later stage, the<lb/> Committee may consider organising a high-level meeting to facilitate discussion on excess capacity<lb/> issues at a higher political level. A key aim of this work will be to establish common perspectives on<lb/> ways to avoid practices that create harmful trade and competitive distortions, and which can lead to a<lb/> long-lasting positive impact on the effective functioning of the global steel market.<lb/></p>

			<figure>4.<lb/> Recent reports suggest that China&apos;s actual crude steelmaking capacity could be higher than estimated. A<lb/> Platts (2014a) report notes that Chinese capacity reached 1.11 billion tpy in 2013 and will increase to<lb/> 1.14 billion tpy in 2014, according to China Iron and Steel Association.<lb/> 5.<lb/> For example, Isdemir blew-in its No. 4 blast furnace with an inner volume of 2 500 m 3 in 2011. In 2013,<lb/> scrap imports decreased by 12.0% to 19.7 mmt compared with 2012, while iron ore imports were up by 3.5%<lb/> to 8.1 mmt, according to data from the World Steel Association.<lb/> 6.<lb/> According to the World Steel Association data, the share of BOF in the CIS region has grown to 67.7% in<lb/> 2013, i.e. by 10 percentage points from its level 10 years earlier.<lb/> 7.<lb/> The Russian steel industry is aiming to replace all of its OHF facilities by 2015 (Russian Steel Consortium,<lb/> 2013). Ukraine expects to complete the replacement of its OHF technology by 2018 (SE UEX, 2014).<lb/> 8.<lb/> These projects do not seem however to be progressing as expected.<lb/></figure>

			<p>9.<lb/> The BOF to EAF ratio in South Africa is high (59:41), according to the World Steel Association data. This<lb/> reflects the important role of iron ore and coking coal in the country.<lb/> 10.<lb/> Egypt has decided to remove natural gas subsidies, and some observers expect the price of gas used by<lb/> cement, iron and durable good factories to increase by 30-75% (<ref type="biblio">Al-Monitor, 2014</ref>). This measure will<lb/> affect those steelmakers operating DRI modules that use natural gas.
