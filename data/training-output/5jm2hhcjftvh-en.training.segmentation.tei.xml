			<front>BUILDING SUBJECTIVE WELL-BEING INDICATORS AT THE SUBNATIONAL LEVEL: A <lb/>PRELIMINARY ASSESSMENT IN OECD REGIONS <lb/>Monica Brezzi and Marcos Diaz Ramirez 1 <lb/>Abstract <lb/>This paper provides, for the first time, estimates of subjective well-being variables in 373 OECD <lb/>subnational regions, allowing comparison of various measures of how people experience and evaluate their <lb/>lives within and across all 34 OECD countries. Different weighting strategies as well as several robustness <lb/>checks have been carried out to ensure regional representativeness and to provide reliable indicators. The <lb/>results show that it is possible to obtain robust regional estimates of subjective well-being through the <lb/>Gallup World Poll for the variables satisfaction with life and social support network. These estimates could <lb/>be included in the OECD Regional Well-Being Database to provide two additional well-being dimensions <lb/>measured uniquely with subjective indicators. In addition to these two variables, the paper explores the <lb/>feasibility of other subjective indicators, either from Gallup or the European Statistics on Income and <lb/>Living Standards (EU SILC), which are particularly meaningful when measured at the city or regional <lb/>levels, such as satisfaction with the living environment, satisfaction with commuting time, trust in the <lb/>political system, and feeling of safety in the community. Finally, a regression analysis is performed to give <lb/>an insight of the explanatory power of both individual and regional specific characteristics to self-reported <lb/>life satisfaction. The results show that regional fixed effects capture around 10 percentage points of the <lb/>variation in life satisfaction, of which 30% can be associated to observable regional characteristics such as <lb/>mortality rate and air pollution. Furthermore, life satisfaction tends to be negatively affected not only by <lb/>the individual unemployment status but also by the level of unemployment of the region; in the OECD <lb/>area, everything else equal, being unemployed is associated with 7 percentage points less of life <lb/>satisfaction compared to someone that is employed; whereas, an increase of 1 percentage point in the <lb/>unemployment rate at the regional level is related with 0.4 percentage points less of satisfaction with life as <lb/>a whole. <lb/>JEL classification codes: I31, R11 <lb/>Keywords: subjective well-being, regional disparities, access to services, World Gallup Poll, <lb/>European Statistics on Income and Living Conditions. <lb/></front>

			<body>1. Introduction <lb/>Subjective well-being reflects the notion of measuring how people experience and evaluate their lives. <lb/>It includes evaluation of life as a whole (generally referred as life satisfaction), evaluations of particular <lb/>domains of life (for example, satisfaction with time available for leisure), feelings and emotions, as well <lb/>measures of &quot; meaningfulness &quot; or &quot; purpose &quot; in life. Subjective aspects provide important information about <lb/>quality of life but also a better understanding of its determinants and thus can complement other outcome <lb/>measures as an alternative yardstick of progress (Stiglitz et al., 2008). In particular, measures of subjective <lb/>well-being are uniquely placed to provide information on the net impact of changes in social and economic <lb/>conditions on the perceived well-being of respondents, taking into account the impact of differences in <lb/>tastes and preferences among individuals (OECD, 2013). <lb/>The OECD framework to measure well-being at national level encompasses two dimensions that are <lb/>measured uniquely with subjective indicators, life satisfaction and social connections, and includes some <lb/>subjective indicators alongside with objective ones in the dimensions of health and environment (OECD <lb/>Better Life Index http://www.oecdbetterlifeindex.org/). In recent years, several national and international <lb/>statistical offices have started producing subjective well-being data encompassing different measures as <lb/>recommended by the OECD Guidelines on measuring subjective well-being (OECD, 2013): Australia <lb/>(2014), Canada (since 1985), Israel (2006), Italy (1993), Korea (2013), Mexico (2012), New Zealand <lb/>(2014), Turkey (2013), United Kingdom (2012) and United States (2011). Subjective evaluations were <lb/>collected for the first time in European official statistics through the 2013 ad-hoc module of EU statistics <lb/>on income and living conditions (EU SILC) covering 25 European OECD countries (Eurostat, 2015). <lb/>While the domains and questions of the national surveys are getting more and more similar, a full <lb/>comparability across countries has not yet been established. The OECD still relies on the world-wide <lb/>Gallup survey for some of the subjective indicators in the Better Life Index. <lb/>Data constraints prevented the inclusion of subjective measures in the OECD measurement of well-<lb/>being in regions (OECD, 2014). The World Gallup Poll is designed to be representative only at the national <lb/>level, few national surveys have been expanded to be representative at the subnational level (Italy, Mexico, <lb/>Turkey and the United Kingdom), and for some European countries included in the EU SILC module on <lb/>well-being regional identifiers are available. Currently, the measurement of well-being in OECD regions <lb/>includes eleven headline objective indicators to monitor outcomes in regions along nine well-being <lb/>dimensions (OECD Regional Well-Being http://www.oecdregionalwellbeing.org/index.html). <lb/>This paper provides, for the first time, subjective well-being indicators for 373 OECD subnational <lb/>regions, allowing comparison within and across all 34 OECD countries. These estimates are derived from <lb/>individual responses to the Gallup survey. Different weighting strategies as well as several robustness <lb/>checks have been carried out to ensure regional representativeness and to provide reliable indicators. It <lb/>should be noted that, in order to increase the sample size, all the annual waves of the Gallup survey <lb/>between 2006 and 2014 are pooled together; thus the results provide just one observation in time. <lb/>Various questions from the Gallup survey are investigated in order to provide regional estimates of <lb/>different well-being dimensions, including life satisfaction, social connections, environment, safety, and <lb/>governance. In addition, regional variables are estimated for some European countries from the 2013 <lb/>module on well-being of the EU SILC. The selected variables from EU SILC differ from Gallup and <lb/>include questions on life satisfaction, social connections, work-life balance, access to services, safety, and <lb/>governance. The regional coverage from EU SILC varies from 7 to 16 countries depending on the <lb/>questions. Robustness checks on the regional samples from EU SILC have not been carried out; instead the <lb/>regional estimates are used for comparison with the results derived from Gallup, when the questions and <lb/>measurements are similar, to test the goodness of fit to official statistics. <lb/></body>

			<page>5 <lb/></page>

			<body>The choice of the survey questions investigated derives from the following considerations. First, the <lb/>paper tests whether it is possible to expand the OECD regional well-being measurement to include two <lb/>dimensions, currently available only at the national level, which are measured through subjective <lb/>indicators: life satisfaction and social connections (meaning having someone to rely on in case of need). <lb/>Second, previous work at the subnational level has underlined the importance of including people&apos;s <lb/>evaluations of particular domains to complement objective indicators (OECD, 2014; OECD 2015a). The <lb/>paper provides regional estimation for a selection of subjective indicators, derived from Gallup or EU <lb/>SILC, in the dimensions of governance and civic engagement, access to services (including evaluations on <lb/>the quality of services), safety, environment, and work-life balance. <lb/>The results show that it is possible to obtain robust regional estimates of subjective well-being <lb/>through the Gallup Poll for six selected measures: life satisfaction, social connections, perception of <lb/>corruption, satisfaction with quality of water, satisfaction with quality of air, and feeling of safety. The <lb/>estimates are available for all the OECD TL2 regions with the exception of five: Yukon, Northwest <lb/>Territories, and Nunavut (Canada) and Helsinki-Uusimaa and Aland (Finland). <lb/>Regional values on life satisfaction from Gallup vary from 4.4 to 8.6 on a zero-ten point scale, a gap <lb/>that is 1.6 times larger than the one among countries. The regional values on life satisfaction from Gallup <lb/>are highly correlated with those derived from official statistics (either EU SILC or national surveys), <lb/>suggesting the possibility of using the Gallup estimates to add life satisfaction in the OECD Regional <lb/>Well-Being Database as &quot; place holder &quot; to be substituted by official statistics as they become available in <lb/>more countries. Similarly, regional values can be estimated for the social support network (social <lb/>connections) from Gallup, although the comparison with official statistics via EU SILC was possible only <lb/>for five European countries. <lb/>Finally, the paper suggests an additional set of self-reported indicators that could be made available at <lb/>the subnational level in the future. To this aim, it would be important to replicate the well-being module in <lb/>the European Union Statistics on Income and Living Conditions (EU SILC) and expand the geographical <lb/>coverage to regions, at least for those indicators, such as satisfaction with commuting, satisfaction with <lb/>services and living environment, or perception of safety in the area of residence, which are more <lb/>meaningful when measured at a more granular territorial scale. <lb/>The paper is organised as follow. Section 2 provides a description of the main source of data (Gallup <lb/>World Poll) together with an assessment of the regional sample representativeness. Section 3 provides <lb/>comparative results across regions in OECD countries for the variables in the dimensions of life <lb/>satisfaction and social connections. This section also compares the results of the regional values for life <lb/>satisfaction obtained by the Gallup World Poll, the EU SILC and the national surveys with subnational <lb/>samples from Italy, Mexico and the United Kingdom. Section 4 presents the results for a selection of <lb/>subjective variables, derived from Gallup or EU SILC that could be included in well-being dimensions <lb/>already measured at the regional level with objective variables. Section 5 concludes with suggestions on <lb/>possible uses of the results. <lb/>2. The Gallup World Poll and its representativeness at the regional level <lb/>Sample representativeness assessment <lb/>The Gallup World Poll (Gallup) is a repeated cross-sectional survey that (following the Gallup <lb/>Macroeconomic Path framework) gathers people&apos;s opinions and self-evaluations on matters related to Law <lb/>and Order, Food and Shelter, Institutions and Infrastructure, Good Jobs, Well-Being, and Brain Gain 2 .

			<body>of 2015, nine waves have been collected in which the survey has covered 165 countries and territories from <lb/>2006 to 2014. Surveys are carried out face to face and/or via telephone depending on the country. All <lb/>samples are probability based and nationally representative (including rural areas) of the population aged <lb/>15 years and above. The typical sample size is of 1 000 for a country-year combination. The 6 variables of <lb/>interest extracted from Gallup are life satisfaction, social connections, perception of corruption, feeling of <lb/>safety, satisfaction with quality of water and satisfaction with quality of air. <lb/>This paper focuses on the 34 OECD countries and more precisely on its 379 large regions, of which <lb/>373 3 are identifiable and available in Gallup. Estimating subjective well-being indicators at the TL2 level <lb/>requires further splitting of the country samples, which for some low-populated regions might generate <lb/>considerably small samples and thus unreliable and/or unrepresentative indicators. The first step to tackle <lb/>this issue is to pool together the nine available waves of Gallup and to estimate indicators for the period <lb/>2006-2014 (instead of annual indicators). 4 Nevertheless, since the variables of interest have not been <lb/>collected for every country every year, there are still a few regions for which small sample size might be a <lb/>concern. Survey sample sizes vary across regions and variables 5 , whereas the average sample size for the <lb/>variable life satisfaction is 727, the average sample size for satisfaction with air quality is 528. Figure 1 <lb/>shows the distribution of the regional sample sizes by variable. For any variable, at least 84% of the <lb/>regions (313 out of 373) have sample sizes larger than 100 observations. For life satisfaction, around 72% <lb/>of the regions have sample sizes larger than 200; while for the other variables only around 65% of the <lb/>regions do. <lb/></body>

			<note place="footnote">3 The Italian region denoted as Province of Trento in the Gallup estimates includes both the Autonomous Province of <lb/>Trento and Autonomous Province of Bolzano-Bozen. <lb/>4 While pooling together the samples of all available years would increase the precision of the estimated indicators <lb/>(by reducing margins of error), it also preclude the possibility of an analysis over time and the study of <lb/>time effects on the different indicators. <lb/>5 Before pooling they also vary across time, with most of the sample concentrated at the end of the period (50% of the <lb/>sample is in the last three available years, 2012-2014). The distributions of sample sizes by variable, region <lb/>and year are available under request. <lb/></note>

			<body>are 6 gender-age groups (í µí± ∈ (1, … , í µí°º = 6), which were determined based on the statistical analysis and <lb/>results presented in the following subsection) and 373 regions; í µí± í µí±í µí± stands for the sample size of the group <lb/>g in region í µí±. Once subjective well-being has been estimated by group and region, it is possible to apply <lb/>equation 2 to aggregate the groups of the same region by reweighting accordingly to the real population <lb/>shares of the 6 gender-age groups. Subjective well-being in region r is then obtained as: <lb/>í µí±í µí±í µí°µ í µí± = ∑ í µí¼ í µí±í µí± í µí±í µí±í µí°µ í µí±í µí± <lb/>í µí°º <lb/>í µí±=1 <lb/>(2) <lb/>where í µí¼ í µí±í µí± = <lb/>í µí± í µí±í µí± <lb/>∑ <lb/>í µí± í µí±í µí± <lb/>í µí°º <lb/>í µí±=1 <lb/>is the real-population share of group g. <lb/>To assess and improve the reliability of these indicators, three analyses are carried out. First, for all <lb/>the OECD countries surveyed population shares by gender and age groups are compared to the real-<lb/>population shares of the same groups in the region. In the same vein, statistical tests are performed to <lb/>determine if the sample proportion of a given gender-age group is statistically the same as the population <lb/>proportion; this part of the analysis concludes with the decision of reweighting the indicators in a way that <lb/>they fit the distribution of the different gender-age groups observed in the real population. Second, for the <lb/>estimated indicators, 95% confidence intervals are built for every region. Finally, the estimated values of <lb/>life satisfaction and social connections from Gallup are compared to its counterparts from other official <lb/>sources. More precisely, life satisfaction at the regional level from Gallup is compared to the variable &quot; life <lb/>satisfaction &quot; from EU SILC (16 countries of the European Union) 8 , INEGI (Mexico&apos;s states), ISTAT <lb/>(Italy&apos;s regions), and ONS (United Kingdom&apos;s regions). On the other hand, because of lack of data from <lb/>national surveys, the variable on social connections in regions from Gallup is compared only to its <lb/>counterpart variable &quot; help from others &quot; from EU SILC (available at the regional level for 7 European <lb/>countries). <lb/>Population comparison by gender-age groups <lb/>To perform this analysis eight gender-age groups are defined, for each gender there are the following <lb/>4 age classes: between 15 and 34 years old, between 35 and 54, between 55 and 74, and between 74 and 99 <lb/>years old. The sample shares come from Gallup and the real-population shares are the 2006-2014 average <lb/>population values from the OECD Regional Database. 9 <lb/>Table 1 displays descriptive statistics of the difference in percentage points of the proportion of <lb/>people in each group between the Gallup Poll and the official population data. Positive values indicate an <lb/>over sampling of that particular group in the survey, while negative values denote an under sampling. On <lb/>average almost all age groups are well represented, with average differences between the surveyed and <lb/></body>

			<note place="footnote">7 According to Gallup (2015) &quot; Data weighting is used to ensure a nationally representative sample for each country <lb/>and is intended to be used for calculations within a country. First, base sampling weights are constructed to <lb/>account for oversamples and household size. If an oversample has been conducted, the data are weighted to <lb/>correct the disproportionate sample. Weighting by household size (number of residents aged 15 and older) <lb/>is used to adjust for the probability of selection, as residents in large households will have a <lb/>disproportionately lower probability of being selected for the sample. Second, post-stratification weights <lb/>are constructed. Population statistics are used to weight the data by gender, age, and, where reliable data <lb/>are available, education or socioeconomic status. Finally, approximate study design effect and margin of <lb/>error are calculated. The design effect calculation reflects the influence of data weighting and does not <lb/>incorporate the infraclass correlation coefficients. &quot; <lb/>8 EU-SILC provides regional (TL2) identifiers only for some European countries and variables, which generates <lb/>different regional coverages depending on the variable considered. <lb/>9 We consider the weighted samples. The sample sizes slightly vary across the different questions. <lb/></note>

However, the <lb/>max and min statistics reveal important deviations for some gender-age groups in certain variables. For <lb/>example, the group &quot; females 35-54 years old &quot; is oversampled by 35 percentage points in the Canadian <lb/>region of Prince Edward Island (CA11), mainly because of the relative importance of a deviation in the <lb/>sampling gains under such a small sample. Similarly, for the variable quality of water in the Mexican <lb/>region of Baja California Sur (ME03) the proportion of &quot; males 15-34 years old &quot; is 20.3 percentage points <lb/>lower than the population proportion observed in the census data. <lb/>Table 1.

			<body>Estimation of confidence intervals <lb/>Confidence intervals at the 95% by region and variable are estimated to be more precise about the <lb/>reliability of the regional estimates from Gallup. The confidence intervals of the proportion variables (i.e. <lb/>social connections, perception of corruption, feeling of safety, satisfaction with quality of water and <lb/>satisfaction with quality of air) are estimated as follows: <lb/>í µí° ¶í µí°¼ í µí±í µí± <lb/>95% <lb/>= 1.96√ <lb/>í µí± í µí±í µí± (1 − í µí± í µí±í µí± ) <lb/>í µí± í µí±í µí± <lb/>(3) <lb/>Where í µí± denotes the question and í µí± the region; while í µí± í µí±í µí± and í µí± í µí±í µí± denote respectively the proportion <lb/>of positive answers ( &quot; yes &quot; or &quot; satisfied &quot; ) and the sample size. <lb/>For the variable life satisfaction, which is measured on a zero-ten point scale the confidence intervals <lb/>are calculated as: <lb/>í µí° ¶í µí°¼ í µí±í µí± <lb/>95% <lb/>= 1.96 <lb/>í µí¼ í µí±í µí± <lb/>√í µí± í µí±í µí± <lb/>(4) <lb/>where í µí¼ í µí±í µí± denotes the sample standard deviation and í µí± í µí±í µí± the sample size. <lb/>In the majority of the cases sample sizes are large enough to have acceptable margins of error; the <lb/>average values of the confidence intervals for the proportion variables lie between 4 and 6 percentage <lb/>points (see Table 4). There are, however, few regions in Chile, Italy, Mexico, Spain and the United States <lb/>where the confidence intervals are very high, mainly due to small sample sizes. 10 Caution is necessary in <lb/>interpreting results in these cases. <lb/>Table 4.

The top of the ladder represents the best possible life for <lb/>you and the bottom of the ladder represents the worst possible life for you. On which step of the ladder <lb/>would you say you personally feel you stand at this time? &quot; , answers take values from 0 to 10 (also &quot; don&apos;t <lb/>know &quot; and &quot; refused to reply &quot; ) at the individual level, while the indicator at the regional (country) level is <lb/>simply the weighted average of those individual who gave a response (from 0 to 10) in a given region <lb/>(country). The average values by country vary from 4.9 in Hungary to 7.6 in Denmark and Switzerland; <lb/>while the regional values range from 4.4 in the Mediterranean Region East (Turkey) to 8.6 in Campeche <lb/>(Mexico). The largest regional differences are found in Mexico, Chile and Turkey (Figure 2). <lb/>Figure 2.

In general the formulation of the question on life satisfaction is similar in the different surveys, <lb/>although only Gallup uses the image of the ladder while the other surveys ask directly &quot; Overall, how <lb/>satisfied are you with your life nowadays? &quot; The answers are on an 11 points scale (from zero to ten) for all <lb/>the surveys, while the target population slightly differs in age (14 years and over in Italy, 15 years and over <lb/>in Mexico and 16 years and over in the United Kingdom).

			<body>2013 the Life Satisfaction Survey in Turkey, for example, has been expanded to the regional and provincial <lb/>levels (corresponding to the TL2 and TL3 OECD regions). 12 However, the survey includes a question on <lb/>happiness on a 3 points scale but no questions on satisfaction with life. Evaluation of life satisfaction at the <lb/>provincial level in Canada (OECD TL2 regions) on an 11 points scale is available through the Canadian <lb/>Community Health Survey run by Statistics Canada. However, the provincial results are presented only as <lb/>number of people who reported to be satisfied or very satisfied. 13 <lb/>Large regional variations exist in life satisfaction in Italy. On average in 2013, 39.5% of citizens from <lb/>the North express a high satisfaction with life, 34% from the Centre and 29.6% from the South; regional <lb/>differences have narrowed since 2009, because of the decrease in life satisfaction from the Northern <lb/>regions (Istat, 2014). On average life satisfaction was equal to 7.8 in the Province of Bolzano and 6.5 in <lb/>Campania in the period 2010-2014, according to the Istat &quot; Indagine sugli aspetti della vita quotidiana &quot; <lb/>(Survey on Daily Life Aspects). Regional values are highly comparable with those from the Gallup Survey, <lb/>although the values from the latter are lower than those from the national survey (Figure 3). 14 The two <lb/>rankings are positively correlated with a 99% confidence interval: The Spearman&apos;s coefficient is equal to <lb/>0.7 on a scale between zero (perfect independence between the two rankings) and one (perfect coincidence <lb/>of the two rankings) (Table 5). 15 <lb/></body>

This is, <lb/>however, a growing field, since a better understanding of the relationships between life satisfaction and <lb/>macro-level indicators -such as labour market performance, quality of government, quality of services and <lb/></body>

			<body>education, can shed light on policy interventions to improve well-being, while individual-level <lb/>characteristics are much less amenable to change by policies (see OECD, 2015 for an example on <lb/>Mexico&apos;s states). <lb/>In our empirical specification life satisfaction of the individual í µí± in region í µí± and in year í µí±¡ (í µí°¿í µí± í µí±í µí±í µí±¡ ) is <lb/>associated to its individual characteristics (í µí± í µí±í µí±í µí±¡ ), regional time-varying factors (í µí± í µí±í µí±¡ ), time fixed effects <lb/>(í µí»¾ í µí±¡ ), regional fixed effects (í µí¼ í µí± ) and unobserved individual characteristics (í µí¼ í µí±í µí±í µí±¡ ) (equation 5). Given the <lb/>available data, this is the specification that captures most of the variance in individual life satisfaction <lb/>(around 25%). <lb/>í µí°¿í µí± í µí±í µí±í µí±¡ = í µí»½í µí± í µí±í µí±í µí±¡ + í µí»¿í µí± í µí±í µí±¡ + í µí»¾ í µí±¡ + í µí¼ í µí± + í µí¼ í µí±í µí±í µí±¡ <lb/>(5) <lb/>The simplest specification (Table 6, column 1) we run a regression of life satisfaction against the set <lb/>of individual characteristics without including regional variables (í µí± í µí±í µí±¡ and í µí¼ í µí± ). The second specification <lb/>includes the regional fixed effects and two time-variant variables (population density and unemployment <lb/>rate). The comparison of column 1 and 2 of Table 6 provides insights on the contribution of regional <lb/>aspects in addition to individual-level characteristics to explain life satisfaction. Finally, the third <lb/>specification (Table 6, column 3), substitutes the regional fixed effects with observable time-invariant <lb/>regional characteristics (í µí¼ í µí± is substituted with í µí¼í µí± í µí± ), the purpose of this estimation is to get an idea of the <lb/>part of the variance of the regional fixed effects that can be explained by observable (time-invariant) <lb/>regional characteristics. <lb/>Table 6 shows the results of the three aforementioned specifications. In all three specifications, the <lb/>sign of the individual characteristics are as expected and confirm previous results; the magnitudes of the <lb/>coefficients, as well as their statistical significance, don&apos;t vary substantially across specifications. Higher <lb/>incomes, higher levels of education, being employed, having a good support network, feeling safe, being <lb/>satisfied with the quality of the environment (air and water) are all significantly positively associated to <lb/>higher levels of life satisfaction. On the other hand being unemployed, perception of governmental <lb/>corruption and being a male are negatively related to life satisfaction.

The status primary education is the reference for both secondary and tertiary <lb/>education; the reference for both being employed or unemployed is being out of the labour force. All the 373 TL2 OECD regions are <lb/>included in the sample. The period covered is 2009 to 2014. <lb/>The preferred specification is defined by equation 5 (column 2); from these results one can remark the <lb/>high associations between life satisfaction and both social connections and being unemployed. Having <lb/>someone to rely on in case of need is strongly associated with higher levels of life satisfaction (almost <lb/>equal to 1 point in the typical life satisfaction scale that goes from 0 to 10). On the other hand, being <lb/>unemployed is importantly related to lower levels of self-reported life satisfaction (around 0.5 in the scale <lb/>0-10 compared to someone out of the labour force, and around 0.7 points less, out of 10, compared to <lb/>someone being employed). <lb/>By comparing column 1 and 2, it is possible to see an increase in the R-squared (the same result is <lb/>obtained with the R-squared adjusted) of around 10 percentage points (from 0.15 to 0.25), which can be <lb/>attributed to the introduction of the regional fixed effects. In column 3, regional fixed effects are <lb/>substituted by time-invariant regional characteristics (mortality rates and air pollution); the increase in the <lb/>goodness of fit from column 1 to column 3 is of around 0.03, which suggests that 30% of the 10 percentage <lb/>points increase in the R-squared due to regional fixed effects can be associated to observable regional <lb/>characteristics such as mortality rates and air pollution 17 . The choice of regional characteristics of column <lb/>(2) and (3) is the only specification where all the OECD regions can be included for the period 2009-2014. <lb/></div>

			<note place="footnote">17 As a second exercise the regional fixed effects of Table 6 column 2 have been filtered and regressed directly <lb/>against observable time-invariant regional characteristics yielding very similar results (R-squared of 0.32). <lb/></note>

			<page>20 <lb/></page>

			<body>Other empirical specifications with different regional variables have been tested; however, the lack of <lb/>data for all the OECD regions generates a trade-off between the geographical coverage (and sample size) <lb/>and the completeness of the model (the number of explanatory variables). Some of these regressions are <lb/>presented in the Annex (see Table 8), although more refinements in data collection at the regional level are <lb/>still necessary for a more precise study of the regional determinants of individual subjective well-being. <lb/>The results show that the economic development and housing conditions affect positively and significantly <lb/>life satisfaction, and the lack of safety in urban regions has a significant negative impact. Whereas the size <lb/>of the coefficient of the number of rooms in a household is around one third the one of the unemployment <lb/>rate, the magnitude of the coefficient of the average regional GDP per capita is considerably and <lb/>surprisingly small. <lb/>Social connections <lb/>Good interpersonal relations, social network supports and general trust in others and institutions are <lb/>considered important sources of individual well-being and social cohesion. Not only they represent <lb/>additional resources to the material and cultural ones, but they can also improve performance of <lb/>institutions and reduce transaction costs (Bourdieu, 1986; Helliwell, 2005; Putnam, 2001). <lb/>To measure social connections, the Gallup question selected is &quot; If you were in trouble, do you have <lb/>relatives or friends you can count on to help you whenever you need them, or not? &quot; 18 In most OECD <lb/>regions, at least 80% of people report having someone to rely on in case of need. The exceptions are Korea <lb/>where the values range between 73% to 79%, and Mexico, Chile, Turkey and Greece where regional <lb/>differences are very large with some regional values well below 75% (Figure 7 19 ). <lb/></body>

The indicator at the regional level is the <lb/>(weighted) percent of those who replied &quot; yes &quot; with respect to all the interviewees (those with the answers <lb/> &quot; yes &quot; , &quot; no &quot; , &quot; don&apos;t know &quot; and &quot; refused to reply &quot; , i.e. the non-missing values) in a given the region. <lb/>19 Country averages in Figure 7 are sometimes dissimilar to the values of social networks used by the OECD for the <lb/>Better Life Index because while the BLI uses yearly indicators, our regional estimates rely on multiyear <lb/>samples (2006-2014). <lb/></note>

Subjective indicators to complement objective indicators <lb/>This section seeks to expand measures of quality of life introducing subjective indicators to <lb/>complement the objective ones already available in OECD regions via the OECD Regional Well-Being <lb/>Database. The well-being dimensions were selected with considerations on introducing evaluations of <lb/>particular domains of life (safety, work-life balance), evaluations on the quality of services (access to <lb/>services, environment) and measures of social capital and citizens&apos; feedback on government activities <lb/></body>

			<note place="footnote">20 The questions are &quot; Do you have any relatives, friends or neighbours that you can ask for help? &quot; (Answers yes/no) <lb/>and &quot; Would you say that most people can be trusted? &quot; (Answers on a scale from 0 to 10, where 0 means <lb/>that in general you do not trust any other person and 10 that you feel most people can be trusted). <lb/></note>

Subjective measures of safety are also correlated to trust in <lb/>the public institutions and trust in the effectiveness of law enforcement (OECD, 2015a).

Many of the policies that bear most <lb/>directly on people&apos;s lives are put into effect at the local level and citizens&apos; experience with local <lb/>institutions have often a significant impact on their trust, behaviour and well-being (Hudson, 2006; Tavits, <lb/>2008). The variable chosen to be included in the Governance and civic engagement dimension refer to the <lb/>percentage of people who believe corruption is widespread throughout government in their country. <lb/>According to the Gallup results, in countries such as Denmark, Finland, Netherlands, Norway, New <lb/>Zealand, Sweden and Switzerland, corruption is low (below 40%) and with small regional variations. A <lb/>second group of countries includes the Czech Republic, Greece, Hungary, Israel, Italy and Slovenia, where <lb/>corruption is high (between 75 and 90%) and with small regional variations. Finally, in Australia, Canada, <lb/>Chile, Mexico, Spain, Turkey and the United States the perception of corruption is quite different <lb/>depending on the region of residence; although the country average values vary in these countries, regional <lb/>values differ everywhere by more than 20 percentage points (Figure 9). <lb/></body>

Countries&apos; samples were reweighted to <lb/>increase the comparability with the demographic profile of a region. The results suggest good sample <lb/>representativeness at the regional level, at least when restricting the age of respondents to 15-74 years, and <lb/>very few missing regions. <lb/>25 The OECD Better Life Index includes a similar variable at the national level from Labour Force Statistics (OECD <lb/>2015b). <lb/>5.5 6.0 6.5 7.0 7.5 8.0 8.5 <lb/>Ireland <lb/>Slovenia <lb/>Finland <lb/>Norway <lb/>Slovak <lb/>Republic <lb/>Denmark <lb/>Sweden <lb/>Czech <lb/>Republic <lb/>United <lb/>Kingdom <lb/>Belgium <lb/>Switzerland <lb/>Spain <lb/>France <lb/>Italy <lb/></body>

			<body>When possible, regional estimates from Gallup are benchmarked with results derived from the 2013 <lb/>module on well-being of the European Statistics on Income and Living Conditions (EU SILC) and from <lb/>national surveys designed to be representative at the regional level. <lb/>Two main conclusions can be drawn. First, the variables satisfaction with life and social support <lb/>network can be estimated for all the OECD (TL2) regions. This will allow, for example, to expand the <lb/>OECD Well-Being Database to the subnational level to include two subjective dimensions, kept distinct <lb/>from the existing ones currently measured with objective indicators. Life satisfaction estimates from <lb/>Gallup are highly correlated with responses derived from official statistics (EU SILC 2013 and national <lb/>surveys) suggesting the possibility to use Gallup values as &quot; place holders &quot; while more regional values for <lb/>official sources become available. <lb/>Second, future replicates of the 2013 well-being module of EU SILC may include a selection of <lb/>indicators with subnational sample representativeness. In addition to life satisfaction and social support <lb/>networks, which are becoming standard measures in many surveys, this paper suggests few variables that <lb/>are particularly meaningful when measured at the city or regional levels: satisfaction with the living <lb/>environment, satisfaction with commuting time, trust in the political system, and perception of safety in <lb/>own &apos;s community. These variables could in the future complement objective indicators in the dimensions <lb/>of accessibility to services, environment, safety, and governance and civic engagement. Importantly, future <lb/>replicates would allow monitoring changes over time, which is currently limited to few countries. <lb/></body>
