			<front>ORGANISATION FOR ECONOMIC CO-OPERATION <lb/>AND DEVELOPMENT <lb/>The OECD is a unique forum where the governments of 30 democracies work together to address the <lb/>economic, social and environmental challenges of globalisation. The OECD is also at the forefront of efforts <lb/>to understand and to help governments respond to new developments and concerns, such as corporate <lb/>governance, the information economy and the challenges of an ageing population. The Organisation <lb/>provides a setting where governments can compare policy experiences, seek answers to common <lb/>problems, identify good practice and work to co-ordinate domestic and international policies. <lb/>The OECD member countries are: Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, the Czech Republic, Denmark, <lb/>Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Korea, Luxembourg, Mexico, the <lb/>Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Portugal, the Slovak Republic, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, <lb/>Turkey, the United Kingdom and the United States. The Commission of the European Communities takes <lb/>part in the work of the OECD. <lb/>OECD Publishing disseminates widely the results of the Organisation&apos;s statistics gathering and research <lb/>on economic, social and environmental issues, as well as the conventions, guidelines and standards agreed <lb/>by its members. <lb/>The Development Centre of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development was established <lb/>by decision of the OECD Council on 23 October 1962 and comprises 22 member countries of the OECD: <lb/>Austria, Belgium, the Czech Republic, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Korea, <lb/>Luxembourg, Mexico, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Slovak Republic, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, <lb/>Turkey and the United Kingdom as well as Brazil since March 1994, Chile since November 1998, India since <lb/>February 2001, Romania since October 2004, Thailand since March 2005 and South Africa since May 2006. <lb/>The Commission of the European Communities also takes part in the Centre&apos;s Governing Board. <lb/>The Development Centre, whose membership is open to both OECD and non-OECD countries, occupies <lb/>a unique place within the OECD and in the international community. Members finance the Centre and serve <lb/>on its Governing Board, which sets the biennial work programme and oversees its implementation. <lb/>The Centre links OECD members with developing and emerging economies and fosters debate and <lb/>discussion to seek creative policy solutions to emerging global issues and development challenges. <lb/>Participants in Centre events are invited in their personal capacity. <lb/>A small core of staff works with experts and institutions from the OECD and partner countries to fulfil <lb/>the Centre&apos;s work programme.

			<body>Introduction <lb/>Poor countries are and will remain for some time vulnerable to external <lb/>shocks, whether to export prices or from natural disasters. The lowest-income <lb/>countries have a higher incidence of shocks than other developing countries and <lb/>tend to suffer larger damages when shocks occur. For the poorest countries, the <lb/>average number of disasters between 1997 and 2001 has been one every <lb/>2.5 years. Commodity price shocks are also more severe for poor countries. <lb/>Low-income countries experience this type of shock on average every 3.3 years. <lb/>About 26 highly-indebted countries have an export concentration of more than <lb/>50 per cent in three or fewer commodities, while 62 per cent of the total exports <lb/>of the least developed countries are unprocessed primary commodities. <lb/>Exogenous shocks on commodity prices have significant direct adverse <lb/>effects on growth and the multiplier effects of negative terms of trade shocks can <lb/>also be large. Collier and Sewn (2001) show, for a sample of cases where the <lb/>direct income loss averaged 6.8 per cent of GDP, the total correlated loss of <lb/>income amounted to about twice that much, to 14 per cent of GDP. Research <lb/>shows that these negative shocks increase the incidence of poverty. The shocks <lb/>also have a significant impact on fiscal and external balances. An IMF study shows <lb/>that terms-of-trade shocks and adverse weather conditions have played an <lb/>important role in exacerbating debt problems 3 . <lb/>In theory, the desired adjustment to a shock depends on the nature of the <lb/>shock. The response to permanent and to transitory shocks should not be the <lb/>same. If the shock is expected to be permanent, countries should adjust as fast <lb/>as possible to the new environment. If instead a negative shock is expected to be <lb/>reversed by a positive shock, it makes sense to finance the bad years out of savings <lb/>or out of debt. Commodity prices, however, are usually very slow to recover <lb/>from adverse shocks. This is one of the reasons why it has proven so difficult <lb/>either to smooth their effect or to stabilise them. Countries that borrow when <lb/>prices are low are bound to face financial difficulties before prices recover to their <lb/>previous levels. In fact, even if a shock is deemed to be transitory, there can be <lb/>considerable uncertainty about how long it will take to be reversed. Over <lb/>optimism concerning the pace of a recovery has been a key factor behind the <lb/>excessive occurrence of debt by poor countries. <lb/>Similarly, Commodity Funds that attempt to stabilise prices at a given level <lb/>are bound to fail. Either there is a negative shock and the Fund soon becomes <lb/>insolvent, or there is a positive shock and the Fund becomes so well-endowed <lb/>that the temptation to expropriate it becomes irresistible. This explains why <lb/></body>

			<body>marketing boards have almost always failed, either through corruption or <lb/>through bankruptcy. As documented in a recent FAO study, however, the <lb/>dismantling of marketing boards has not been without creating new problems. <lb/>Uncertainty regarding their income, in particular, has created credit problems to <lb/>crop producers, so that input use has dropped significantly, explaining in part the <lb/>drop of quality of the products 4 . <lb/>On the donor community, there have been two major compensatory financing <lb/>programmes for terms of trade shocks: the EU Stabex and Sysmin and the IMF&apos;s <lb/>Compensatory Financing Facility (CFF). The EU&apos;s programme covered agricultural <lb/>commodity exports and selected mineral exports. From 1975 to 2000, about <lb/>6.1 billion euros was disbursed. The CFF provides financing when a country <lb/>experiences a &quot; temporary &quot; shortfall in export earnings or an excess in cereal import <lb/>costs. A total of SDR 25 billion has been disbursed in response to 344 requests for <lb/>assistance since 1963. Neither experience was deemed to be highly successful <lb/>however. As shown in Guillaumont et al. (2003), both mechanisms became <lb/>increasingly contingent on conditionalities of various sorts, which have lengthened <lb/>the delay between the occurrence of the shock and the need of the countries. Delays <lb/>in response have actually been so long that they turn out to be pro-cyclical, rather <lb/>than counter-cyclical as one would have expected (Brun et al. 2001). <lb/>Collier and Dehn (2001) also present evidence that aid allocations are not well <lb/>targeted to commodity price shocks. Commodity price shocks, they argue, are like <lb/> &quot; silent crises &quot; . Financial assistance in the event of a terms-of-trade shock appears <lb/>to be harder to design and target than that for natural disasters assistance (natural <lb/>disasters actually attract more external financing than commodity price shocks). <lb/>These failures explain the conclusion that not much can or should be done <lb/>to stabilise commodity prices. Exporting countries, it is sometimes argued, <lb/>should behave as if any commodity shock was bound to be permanent and adjust <lb/>accordingly. This is too extreme a conclusion. There is no reason why countries <lb/>should not find ways to protect themselves against adverse shocks, if not fully at <lb/>least partially. The idea developed in this Brief builds indeed upon the following <lb/>intuition: countries can get protection against commodity shocks, but for a while <lb/>only rather than indefinitely. <lb/>Technically, the solution that we explore is the following. We propose to <lb/>create new Commodity Funds, with limited liabilities, to stabilise commodity <lb/>producers&apos; income around a reference price which is a moving average of past <lb/>prices. The reference price upon which the income of the producers is <lb/>calculated is known in advance to the producers and yet is allowed to follow <lb/>market trends smoothly. This avoids the pitfalls of past stabilisation based around <lb/>6 <lb/>OECD Development Centre Policy Brief No. 32 <lb/>a given reference price, which is bound, sooner or later, to be out of touch with <lb/>market forces. In the simulations that we present, the reference price is a moving <lb/>average of previous prices over the past five years. Even in the event of a <lb/>permanent shock, this gives the country time to take the needed adjustment. <lb/>How much would it cost to create a Fund that protects producers against <lb/>deviations from such a five-year moving average? The answer is twofold. In the <lb/>worst case scenario where the Fund should stand ready to guarantee producers <lb/>against a total collapse of their prices, it would cost a one-off endowment worth <lb/>2.7 times the yearly value of the exports that one seeks to protect. Note that this <lb/>is a finite number: even if prices were to stay indefinitely nil, the Fund would stop <lb/>guaranteeing producers after five years. In general, however, the Fund is bound <lb/>to cost less. Over a period of 50 years, the median cost would be worth about <lb/>six months exports. The Brief also presents the risk of default of the Fund <lb/>associated to lower levels of endowment than the maximum needed. One year <lb/>of exports would be associated to a risk of default of about 10 per cent over a <lb/>50 years horizon. <lb/>There are many ways by which the ideas involved in this mechanism could <lb/>be applied. One is simply to create a Fund in which producers would be free to <lb/>participate and which would be endowed accordingly. The Fund would act as an <lb/>insurer, which producers would draw upon or replenish according to the prices <lb/>that they face. <lb/>Another idea would be to modulate traditional ODA according to the <lb/>moving average idea that we propose. Commodity exporters would receive <lb/>ODA that would vary inversely with deviations of commodity prices from past <lb/>averages. The computations that are performed in the Brief would then help <lb/>donors assess the cost to proceed along these lines. <lb/>Empirical Investigation <lb/>We seek to analyse how a Commodity Fund could guarantee a reference <lb/>price to an exporting country, where the reference prices is a moving average of <lb/>the price over the preceding years. In the sequel, we shall focus on a reference <lb/>price based on the average of the past five years. In the simulation that we offer, <lb/>the stabilisation is done through a Fund which is initially endowed with a given <lb/>amount of resources. The aim of this Policy Brief is to determine the probability <lb/>of depletion of the Fund and to investigate how much resources are needed to <lb/>avoid (with various degrees of probability) its bankruptcy. <lb/></body>

			<body>In order to calibrate the results, monthly commodity price data reported <lb/>in the International Monetary Fund&apos;s International Financial Statistics, for the <lb/>period January 1957 to December 2003 are used. The commodities used for the <lb/>study are presented in Table 1. For each selected commodity, the table presents <lb/>the sample period used for the study, the spot price in July 2003, then a figure <lb/>which can be regarded as a rough estimate of the total exports of developing <lb/>countries in 2003. In the following analysis, all prices will be real prices, deflated <lb/>by a US producer price index, taking July 2003 as the reference. <lb/>Table 1. Selected Commodities <lb/>Commodities <lb/>Sample period <lb/>Price 7/2003 <lb/>Annual Value <lb/>($ million) <lb/>Bananas <lb/>1/75-12/2003 <lb/>296.30 US$/ton <lb/>3 438 <lb/>Cocoa Beans <lb/>1/1957-12/2003 <lb/>1 556.87 US$/ton <lb/>43 287 <lb/>Cotton <lb/>1/1957-12/2003 <lb/>60.19 US cts/lb <lb/>4 248 <lb/>Rice <lb/>1/1957-12/2003 <lb/>199.48 US$/ton <lb/>3 970 <lb/>Figures 1 to 4 plot monthly spot prices, along with monthly moving averages <lb/>over 2, 5 and 10 years, with an initial lag of 1 year (i.e. the moving average is lagged <lb/>by one year). With the exception of bananas, one striking feature of price <lb/>movements is that the peaks appear to be more accentuated than the troughs, <lb/>a feature that is analysed in Deaton and Laroque (1992). <lb/>Simulating the Fund 5 <lb/>There are many parameters which can be adjusted for the simulations. One <lb/>is the number of years over which the moving average is calculated. We present <lb/>simulations based on a 5 years moving average. Another parameter is the yearly <lb/>interest rate, which we take equal to 5 per cent. The other key parameter, which <lb/>we allow to vary in the simulations, is the initial endowment of the Fund, called 0 <lb/>F . <lb/>The first set of simulations has computed which endowments are needed <lb/>in order to reduce the risk of bankruptcy of the Fund below a given level. They <lb/>are presented in Table 2. <lb/></body>

Cotton <lb/>11 <lb/>Commodity Funds: How To Fix Them? <lb/>Figure 4. Rice <lb/>12 <lb/>OECD Development Centre Policy Brief No. 32 <lb/>For example, the line for cocoa refers to price stabilisation for cocoa beans. <lb/>With an initial endowment of 1.8 times the annual value of trade, the Fund will <lb/>remain always positive with a 90 per cent chance. With an initial endowment <lb/>worth 2.68 times the volume of trade, the Fund will never become negative, even <lb/>at an infinite time horizon. This is in fact a general statistical property: it never <lb/>takes more than 2.68 times the flows of trade volume to stabilise commodities <lb/>along the lines of our proposal. The intuition is in fact quite simple. The worst case <lb/>scenario is one in which the price of the commodity collapses to zero indefinitely. <lb/>In that case the Fund has to pay the exporters one full year of exports during the <lb/>first year, then 0.75, then 0.5 then 0.25 then nothing. That makes 2.5 years, given <lb/>the interest on the Fund borrowed, that makes a bit more. <lb/>Clearly, however, the numbers in Table 2 are worst case scenarios. In <lb/>average, the Fund is much less costly. Ups and downs usually alternate, around <lb/>the moving average, so that the Fund sometimes recaptures part of the transfers. <lb/>The median cost of the Fund is simulated, when it is allowed to run for a period <lb/>of 50 years.

			<body>The table shows that stabilizing the income of Cotton and Rice produces <lb/>would take about less than 6 months of exports in 50 per cent of cases. The <lb/>corresponding cost would be around 4 months for bananas. In the case of Cocoa, <lb/>the cost would actually be negative: in average one would gain by offering this <lb/>scheme to exporters. <lb/>Other Options <lb/>Two other alternative options were also tested. One is the operating cost <lb/>of a Fund which would pool all five commodities together. In the case of a 10 per <lb/>cent default risk and for a five-year moving average, a cost corresponding to 0.88 <lb/>times the volume of trade to be insured is required. This is quite significantly less <lb/>than the amounts obtained for each individual fund, which varied from 1.12 to <lb/>1.80 times the trade flows and shows that there would be some merit to form <lb/>a &quot; mega Fund &quot; rather than individual ones. <lb/>Another simulation is to calculate how large should be the endowment of <lb/>a Fund that would stabilise commodities on an asymmetric basis, that is which <lb/>would transfer resources in case of a bad shock but not to collect them in case <lb/>of a positive one? Table 4 presents the results corresponding to a 10 per cent <lb/>default risk. <lb/>Table 4. Endowment Needed to Stabilise Prices <lb/>with Asymmetrical Payments <lb/>Bananas <lb/>2.22 <lb/>Cocoa <lb/>6.56 <lb/>Cotton <lb/>1.87 <lb/>Rice <lb/>3.67 <lb/>Note: As a fraction of trade volumes, with 10 per cent default risk. <lb/>14 <lb/>OECD Development Centre Policy Brief No. 32 <lb/>The asymmetrical scheme is clearly much more expensive than the <lb/>symmetric one. In the case of cocoa, for instance, the Fund would need to be <lb/>endowed with six times the corresponding volume of trade, while, under the <lb/>symmetric case, the amount was only 1.81 times the flows involved. <lb/>One important point should also be noted. As Fally (2004) demonstrates <lb/>theoretically, one should not seek to protect the entirety of the producers&apos; <lb/>income. Indeed, in that case, the scheme would be open to manipulation. In year t <lb/>for instance the producers could reduce production so as to let prices go up and <lb/>then in year t+1 flood the market at the stabilised price. If instead they receive <lb/>a protection for only the first x tons of their output, then the incentive to <lb/>manipulate prices disappear. <lb/>Policy Implications <lb/>There is a wide array of institutions and issues implicated in this problem. <lb/>The relevant institutions – whether IDA (the branch of the World Bank lending <lb/>to the poorest countries) or the IMF or other members of the international <lb/>donor community – could lend support to Commodity Funds. Currently, LIC <lb/>government finances absorb alone the risks and shocks associated with a range <lb/>of economic, geopolitical, epidemiological and climatic uncertainties. <lb/>One could first think of creating new debt instruments that explicitly take <lb/>account of exogenous risks. In September 1999, the World Bank introduced risk <lb/>management products linked to its loan exposure. These hedging products are: <lb/>interest rate swaps, caps and collars; currency swaps; and commodity price-<lb/>linked swaps. The Bank decided not to offer specific commodity-based loans at <lb/>that time because it would have been difficult to undertake the commodity-based <lb/>funding and liability management to match the disbursement periods of Bank <lb/>loans while managing associated risks. <lb/>The approach in this paper would help to overcome these difficulties. One <lb/>idea would be to set up a Fund aimed at smoothing the payments made by the <lb/>debtors to IDA for instance. (Gilbert et al., 2004) have calibrated similar ideas). <lb/>The mechanism described here would not extinguish the debt in case of the <lb/>prices falling to zero. It would simply give time to adjust. On the other hand, this <lb/>would not be very costly. For a loan of 100 whose repayment is 5, all that would <lb/>be needed is a Fund endowed with say 15 (see Cohen and Reisen, 2006, on a <lb/>similar idea). The fact that the Funds have limited liabilities has the merit of putting <lb/>a specific limit to the commitment of the donor community. <lb/></body>

			<note place="footnote">15 <lb/>Commodity Funds: How To Fix Them? <lb/></note>

			<body>Making ODA counter-cyclical is another way of addressing the problem. <lb/>Although this has long been a theme of donor agencies, they often fail to recognise <lb/>that &quot; counter-cyclicality &quot; does not mean much when shocks are either long <lb/>lasting or permanent. The idea developed in this brief allows to give a more <lb/>precise content to this idea and to measure the corresponding cost of implementing <lb/>it. ODA could include a component that allows to smooth commodity exporters <lb/>incomes. Donors would commit a given amount of resources to a Commodity <lb/>Fund, whose endowments could be directly counted as ODA at the time when <lb/>they are granted by the donor. <lb/>Conclusion <lb/>This paper has presented a scheme which could be used in a variety of <lb/>fashions: either directly to help producers protect themselves against adverse <lb/>shocks, or to calibrate ODA to a government to dampen the impacts of price <lb/>volatility on GDP. The scheme could also help tailor new loans to commodity <lb/>dependent countries, smoothing their repayment pattern accordingly. The <lb/>orders of magnitude presented should give some indication of the costs of <lb/>supplying a revenue-smoothing mechanism. <lb/>Notes <lb/></body>

The <lb/>conclusions represent a contribution to the search for policies to deal with the issues involved. <lb/>The Policy Briefs deliver the research findings in a concise and accessible way. This series, with its wide, <lb/>targeted and rapid distribution, is specifically intended for policy and decision makers in the fields <lb/>concerned. <lb/>Commodity prices are usually very slow to recover from adverse shocks. This is one of the reasons why <lb/>Commodity Funds have so often failed in the past, and why it is sometimes argued that producers should <lb/>behave as if shocks were permanent. This Policy Brief argues that this would be too extreme a conclusion. <lb/>Countries should be protected against adverse shocks. The goal of a viable Commodity Fund should not be <lb/>to stabilise prices, however, but to smooth the income of the producers. Under the scheme that is presented <lb/>in this Brief, countries get protection against deviation of commodity prices from a moving average of past <lb/>prices. This avoids the pitfalls of past attempts to stabilise prices around a given level, and yet gives countries <lb/>time to adjust to long lasting shocks. The brief calibrates empirically how much it would cost to create <lb/>Commodity Funds of this kind. Over a period of a 50-year time horizon, and depending on the commodity, <lb/>the median cost would be worth about six months of exports. </div>
