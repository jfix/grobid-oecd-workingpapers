            <figDesc>Nigeria is Africa&apos;s most populated nation with some 124 million inhabitants in 2002. Until<lb/> August 2001, Nigeria had one of the lowest teledensity rates in the world. In February 2001, the<lb/> government awarded three 15-year mobile cellular GSM licences for USD 285 million and the rise in the<lb/> number of mobile subscribers has been very significant. By December 2001, there were close to 400 000<lb/> GSM subscribers. The mobile operators managed to provide access to almost as many telephone<lb/> subscribers in four months than had been installed via fixed lines in 40 years since independence (there<lb/> were some 540 000 fixed lines at the end of December 2001). Growth has been relentless, reaching two<lb/> million subscribers by March 2003. Mobile coverage was initially limited to Lagos, the largest city, and<lb/> has now spread to 219 out of 550 local government areas.</figDesc>

            <figDesc>The reform of the UK electricity industry led to a noticeable improvement of service quality.<lb/> Between 1995 and 2000, both the number and duration of interruptions have decreased. The average time<lb/> lost per connected customer due to planned outages has dropped from 16.3 minutes to 9.4 minutes. The<lb/> duration of the fault-related interruptions has also declined, albeit to a lesser extent.<lb/> Source: Giannakis, Jamasb and Pollitt, 2003.</figDesc>

            <figDesc>As result, some rural households started to use photovoltaic systems to supply electricity<lb/> provided by private companies. The process began in the early 80s when upper-middle class households,<lb/> NGOs and donors of aid projects installed photovoltaic systems in off-grid areas. Since the 90s large<lb/> numbers of rural households started to buy small photovoltaic panels and batteries. About 120,000 solar<lb/> photovoltaic systems for household use were sold in Kenya and between 1992 and 1998 the market grew<lb/> by more than 20% a year. Although early on the process was benefiting mostly upper-middle class<lb/> households, technological innovation made it possible to supply smaller and cheaper products.<lb/> Competition also contributed to lowering the retail price for a photovoltaic system from about US$100 in<lb/> 1990 to US$65 in 1998. Furthermore, the introduction of finance agencies has allowed lower-income<lb/> households to buy photovoltaic systems on credit.<lb/> 86.<lb/> The introduction of photovoltaic systems through private entrepreneurs has shown to be<lb/> successful in extending electricity access to the rural population. Since 1990, more than 2.5 megawatts of<lb/> photovoltaic capacity have been sold in Kenya. The rural electrification programme of the utility connected<lb/> fewer than 21,000 households between 1995 and 1999, while during the same period more than 80,000<lb/> households bought solar systems. By 1999, 3 to 4 % of the rural population had acquired a photovoltaic<lb/> system.<lb/> Source: Hankins, 2000.</figDesc>

            <figDesc>Maintenance responsibility for the plastic pipes lies with the customers. Community-based organisations<lb/> and NGOs play a role in intermediation and mapping of the network.<lb/> 90.<lb/> Estimates suggest that the Bayan-Tubig connections have reduced water connection costs for<lb/> poor families by up to 25%. As even these reduced costs are sometimes a challenge, the concessionaire has<lb/> also introduced interest-free repayment schemes over 6 to 24 month periods. Introduced in early 1999, the<lb/> programme had provided water connections to 19,000 poor households by the end of that year, and as of<lb/> 2001 the figure had risen to over 50,000. The other concessionaire was equally unconventional in serving<lb/> the poor, arranging to sell bulk water to a steel tank manufacturing company which then installed small<lb/> networks to serve poor communities.<lb/> Source: PPIAF, 2002.

            <figDesc>India started a gradual liberalisation of its telecommunications sector in 1985. The decision to<lb/> open the wireless telephone market to private companies was taken in 1991 and was implemented in 1994.<lb/> The government&apos;s licenses plan divided the Nation into four large metropolitan areas. Auctions were<lb/> organised to select private companies, from which State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs) in charge of fixed lines<lb/> were barred from participating. Licenses were awarded in the four cities in November 1994 and the<lb/> companies began their operations in 1997. However, competition with incumbent SOEs was weakened<lb/> when the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) allowed SOEs into wireless service in 1996 without<lb/> paying the license fee (or the interconnection charges paid by the private companies). The DoT also<lb/> decided to increase the interconnection charge, further weakening competition.</figDesc>

            <figDesc>PART II: NETWORK INFRASTRUCTURE SERVICES AND THE GATS<lb/> I.<lb/> Introduction<lb/> 114.<lb/> The aim of this part of the study is to complement Part I by linking the discussion of the<lb/> liberalisation of network infrastructure services at the national level with the GATS. It explores the main<lb/> issues related to these services in current GATS negotiations in terms of new possibilities for progress in<lb/> light of real liberalisation taking place in many countries and of important considerations specific to these<lb/> services.</figDesc>
