Arch Rock&apos;s technology provides access to the Wireless Sensor Network as well as to individual<lb/> Sensor Nodes using Internet Protocol (IP) methods, services and tools.<lb/> 73.<lb/> 6LoWPAN22 (IPv6 over IEEE802.15.4) is a communication network based on IPv6 networking, for<lb/> limited power and for low throughput requirements.<lb/> 74.<lb/> It should be noted that a number of other working groups are using IPv4.<lb/> </bibl>
        <bibl><label>75.</label><lb/> An ad-hoc network is a local area network or other small network, especially one with wireless or<lb/> temporary plug-in connections, in which some of the network devices are part of the network only for the<lb/> duration of a communications session or, in the case of mobile or portable devices, while in some close<lb/> proximity to the rest of the network.<lb/> </bibl>

        <bibl><label>78.</label><lb/> IPv6 Mobile nodes in IPv6 are able to communicate directly with any peer, as opposed to mobile nodes in<lb/> IPv4 where generally, the communication between the mobile node and its peer is routed through a fixed<lb/> anchor point (the Home Agent), which makes routing sub-optimal.<lb/> </bibl>
        <bibl><label>79.</label><lb/> The additional overhead cost for the direct routing with mobile nodes in IPv6 is that of a signaling<lb/> overhead. Most of the signaling overhead cost is to make the transmission between the mobile node and its<lb/> peer secure.<lb/> 80.<lb/> In this case there appears to be a need to devise more complex forms of protocol translation mechanisms<lb/> that use forms of 4in6 protocol mapping, in order to allow IPv4 packets to transit across an IPv6 internal<lb/> infrastructure. The issue concerns the capability of available routers to perform such packet<lb/> transformations within the necessarily very high packet processing rates that such high volume networks<lb/> require.<lb/> 81.<lb/> http://www.potaroo.net/ispcol/2007-08/dualstack.html.<lb/> </bibl>
