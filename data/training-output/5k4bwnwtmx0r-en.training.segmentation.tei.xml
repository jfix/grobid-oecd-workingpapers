			<front>ABSTRACT/RÉSUMÉ <lb/>The system of revenue sharing and fiscal transfers in China <lb/>The main features of China&apos;s current sub-national finance arrangements date back to the 1994 tax reform. China <lb/>has a multi-level government structure that shares national tax revenues through a system of tax sharing and transfers, <lb/>and divides spending assignments and responsibilities. Local governments have hardly any discretionary power to <lb/>modify taxation, though they have some non-tax revenue from fees, levies and penalties. They can also spend the <lb/>profit from the sale of land-use rights subject to central government restrictions. As the 1994 tax reform recentralised <lb/>revenues and decision-making power, vertical gaps between revenue and expenditure at sub-national levels have <lb/>grown. In order to accommodate this, the central government has raised the scale of transfers. Over the past decade, <lb/>China&apos;s transfer policy has addressed the horizontal imbalances and become markedly more redistributive. <lb/>Nevertheless, fiscal disparities within provinces remain high and are much greater than between regions in OECD <lb/>countries. The extent of fiscal equalisation within provinces varies, thus affecting the delivery of services. The <lb/>government&apos;s plan to equalise service provision across the country therefore calls for fine-tuning the transfer system <lb/>and improving local revenue. Some local governments are testing a residential property tax but not in a form that <lb/>would substantially raise tax revenue. A significant property tax would tend to lower the revenue from the sale of <lb/>land-use rights and would, in general, improve the fiscal position of those local governments that already have strong <lb/>budgets. <lb/>This Working Paper relates to the 2013 OECD Economic Survey of China (www.oecd.org/eco/surveys/china) <lb/>JEL classification: H71, H72, H73, H74, H77, H11, H24, H25, H27, H51, H52, H60, H61, D63, E62, R52. <lb/>Keywords: China, public finance, tax sharing, fiscal disparities, intergovernmental transfers, local government, <lb/>service equalisation, land-use rights, property taxation. <lb/>************************* <lb/>Le système de partage des recettes et des transferts budgétaires en Chine <lb/>Les principales caractéristiques des accords de financement infranationaux actuels en Chine remontent à la <lb/>réforme fiscale de 1994. La Chine possède une structure administrative à plusieurs niveaux qui partage les recettes <lb/>fiscales nationales par le biais d&apos;un système de répartition des recettes fiscales et de transferts, et qui attribue les <lb/>missions et responsabilités en matière de dépense. Les collectivités locales n&apos;ont guère de pouvoir discrétionnaire afin <lb/>de modifier la fiscalité, même si elles collectent des recettes non fiscales provenant de divers droits, prélèvements et <lb/>amendes. Elles peuvent aussi dépenser les recettes provenant de la vente de droits d&apos;usage des terrains sous réserve de <lb/>restrictions imposées par le gouvernement central. Comme la réforme fiscale de 1994 a centralisé de nouveau les <lb/>recettes et le pouvoir de décision, les déséquilibres verticaux entre recettes et dépenses au niveau infranational se sont <lb/>accentués. Afin d&apos;en tenir compte, le gouvernement central a augmenté le volume des transferts. Au cours de la <lb/>décennie passée, la politique des transferts en Chine a répondu aux déséquilibres horizontaux et est devenue <lb/>nettement plus redistributive. Néanmoins, les disparités fiscales au sein des provinces demeurent élevées et sont <lb/>beaucoup plus grandes qu&apos;entre régions des pays de l&apos;OCDE. Le degré de péréquation au sein des provinces varie, ce <lb/>qui affecte la prestation de services. Afin d&apos;égaliser cette dernière dans tout le pays, le plan du gouvernement appelle <lb/>donc à peaufiner le système de transferts et à améliorer les recettes locales. Certaines autorités locales sont en train de <lb/>tester un impôt foncier résidentiel, mais pas sous une forme qui permettrait d&apos;augmenter considérablement les <lb/>recettes fiscales. Un impôt foncier important aurait tendance à réduire les recettes provenant de la vente de droits <lb/>d&apos;usage des terrains et, plus généralement, améliorerait la situation financière des administrations locales déjà dotées <lb/>de solides budgets. <lb/>Ce Document de travail a trait à l&apos;Étude économique de l&apos;OCDE de la Chine, 2013 (www.oecd.org/eco/etudes/chine). <lb/>Classification JEL : H71, H72, H73, H74, H77, H11, H24, H25, H27, H51, H52, H60, H61, D63, E62, R52. <lb/>Mots clés : Chine, finances publiques, répartition des recettes fiscales, les disparités fiscales, les transferts <lb/>intergouvernementaux, les collectivités locales, égalisation service, droits d&apos;usage des terrains, impôt foncier. <lb/>© OECD (2013) <lb/>You can copy, download or print OECD content for your own use, and you can include excerpts from OECD <lb/>publications, databases and multimedia products in your own documents, presentations, blogs, websites and <lb/>teaching materials, provided that suitable acknowledgment of OECD as source and copyright owner is given.

			<body>THE SYSTEM OF REVENUE SHARING AND FISCAL TRANSFERS IN CHINA <lb/>Xiao Wang and Richard Herd 1 <lb/>This paper presents the main features of China&apos;s sub-national public finance arrangements and <lb/>discusses past and potential changes that affect fiscal disparities across the country. China has a multi-<lb/>tiered government structure (Box 1) that shares overall national tax revenues through tax sharing and <lb/>transfers. The paper first outlines the distribution of revenue and expenditure by level of government. It <lb/>then discusses how transfers affect fiscal inequality. After considering the orientation of government policy <lb/>in service equalisation, the paper looks at the government&apos;s plans to improve sub-national finance. <lb/>Box 1. China&apos;s administrative divisions <lb/>The administrative structure of the People&apos;s Republic of China has four sub-national levels: provincial, <lb/>prefectural, county and township. The People&apos;s Assembly at each level reports to the assembly at the next higher level. <lb/>Finally, the provincial assembly reports to the national assembly. There is also an informal level of government below <lb/>the township level called the village level. In parallel to the government structure, there is a similar structure for the <lb/>Communist Party. The names of each level of government vary across the country. <lb/>The provincial level can be known as a province, an autonomous region or a municipality (these are generally <lb/>large cities under the direct control of the national assembly – the case for Beijing, Shanghai or Tianjin, or part of a <lb/>former larger province as in the case of Chongqing). In the rest of this paper, all provincial-level governments are <lb/>referred to as provinces. <lb/>At the prefectural level, there are three types of government: prefectures, prefectural-level cities and sub-<lb/>provincial-level cities. The distinction between the first two depends on the level of urbanisation, while the latter <lb/>consists of a small group of cities that are able to bypass the provincial government and deal directly with national <lb/>government in certain areas. Municipalities do not have the prefectural level of government. <lb/>At the county level, there are three types of institution: districts, county cities and counties which again can have <lb/>varying names across the country. Districts are urban areas of a prefectural-level city. Counties are generally rural <lb/>areas, though some have an urban character. County cities are counties that had an urban core of above a certain size <lb/>before 2000. <lb/>Finally, the township is lowest level of administration. In the urban areas of prefectural-level cities, this unit is <lb/>known as a sub-district. Elsewhere, it is known as a town or township depending on its size. There also exists a unit <lb/>below the township level known as a village in rural areas or neighbourhood in urban areas. They have no official <lb/>administrative role but serve as a channel of communication to the population. <lb/>Provincial level <lb/>Prefectural level <lb/>County level <lb/>Township level <lb/>Village <lb/>level (informal) <lb/>31 <lb/>332 <lb/>2853 <lb/>40466 <lb/>around 900 000 <lb/>Provinces, 22 <lb/>Cities, 284 <lb/>Districts, 857 <lb/>Streets, 7194 <lb/>Autonomous regions, 5 <lb/>Prefectures, 48 <lb/>County cities, 369 <lb/>Towns, 19683 <lb/>Municipalities, 4 <lb/>Counties, 1573 <lb/>Townships, 13857 <lb/>Note: Following the practice of the China Statistical Yearbook, these statistics cover mainland China only. <lb/>Source: China Statistical Yearbook 2012; Ministry of Civil Administration. <lb/>1. <lb/>Xiao Wang was an economist (Consultant) working on the China Desk in the Economics Department of <lb/>the OECD in 2012 and early 2013, and Richard Herd is the head of the Desk.

			<body>The structure of public finances across the country <lb/>Revenue <lb/>The current tax system was put in place in 1994. A value-added tax (VAT) on goods replaced scores <lb/>of cascading indirect taxes. Income tax thresholds were lowered, leading a much larger proportion of <lb/>employees to pay income tax. This new system replaced &quot; tax farming &quot; , under which provincial <lb/>governments negotiated a payment to central government and could retain all remaining tax revenues. <lb/>The Chinese national government budget (which excludes social security funds) relies predominately <lb/>on indirect and company taxation for revenue. Within these two groups VAT dominates. It will become <lb/>even more dominant once the business tax (a sales tax on services) is rolled into the VAT. Moreover these <lb/>two sets of taxes have tended to grow much faster than national income. Company taxes, though, are more <lb/>sensitive to cyclical fluctuations than the VAT. By 2011, these three taxes accounted for close to 85% of <lb/>all national tax revenue (Figure 1). Individual income tax, which has been in place for three decades, <lb/>provides limited revenue. The yield from personal income taxation is one-third the yield of corporate tax <lb/>and 10% of the yield of indirect taxation. When introduced in 1983, the threshold for payment of income <lb/>tax was set at 12 times average earnings. In 1999, it was lowered to slightly below average earnings. The <lb/>threshold was raised at the end of 2011 to 90% of average earnings. <lb/>Figure 1. Sources of tax revenue at the national level <lb/>In 2011 <lb/>Source: China Statistical Yearbook <lb/>Tax assignment <lb/>In China, local governments have no discretionary power to raise taxation, though they can lower <lb/>taxation by granting tax holidays for new investors. The central government sets the legislation governing <lb/>taxation and the rate of each tax. Local authorities have no autonomy in the area of taxation in only four <lb/>OECD countries (Figure 2). In China the central government assigns various portions of taxes directly to <lb/>local governments. The precise share varies from tax to tax. Just under half of tax revenues are assigned <lb/>exclusively to either the central or the local governments: pure central government taxes relate to foreign <lb/>trade or excise taxes on tobacco, alcohol, petroleum products, cars and jewellery (known collectively as the <lb/>consumption tax); pure local government taxes cover services and property. The remaining portion of tax <lb/>revenue is shared between central and local governments and accounts for slightly more than half of total <lb/>tax revenue. Overall the share accrued to the central government is around 70% (Table 1). <lb/>Value added tax, <lb/>excise taxes and <lb/>supplements <lb/>Business tax <lb/>Corporate income tax <lb/>Individual income tax <lb/>Deed tax <lb/>Tariffs <lb/>Others <lb/>ECO/WKP(2013)22 <lb/></body>

			<body>The largest tax assigned to provincial governments is that on services, known as the business tax <lb/>(Figure 3). This tax complements VAT which is only levied on goods. However, its existence is an <lb/>anomaly as all goods-specific (and hence cascading) taxes were abolished in 1994 and replaced by VAT on <lb/>goods. The government is committed to merging the business tax with VAT. The first pilot was undertaken <lb/>in Shanghai in 2011 and was widened in September 2012 to Beijing, Tianjin, Shenzhen and Xiamen, as <lb/>well as the provinces of Guangdong, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Fujian and Hubei (Brys and Matthews, <lb/>2013). In 2013, the business tax will be replaced by VAT in the following economic zones: Bohai, Yangtze <lb/>River Delta and Yangtze River, Pearl River Delta and the Straits economic zones. <lb/>The remaining taxes assigned to local governments are based mostly on the value or quantity of local <lb/>assets. Taxes on property have been particularly buoyant in the decade to 2011, rising by a compound <lb/>growth rate of 33% to approach 2% of GDP. In addition, property developers have to pay the business tax <lb/>of the value of their sales. This tax is estimated to raise a further 0.5% of GDP in revenue. It is, though, <lb/>more of tax on goods and services than a tax on property – even if investment goods are usually exempt <lb/>from such taxes. Since 2011, householders who sell an apartment within two years of purchase have to pay <lb/>the business tax. Overall, taxes levied on the use of property amount to 0.7% of GDP while taxes on the <lb/>sale of property raise around 1.2% of GDP (excluding the business tax). <lb/>Figure 3. The importance of the various taxes assigned to local government <lb/>Percentage of total locally assigned tax revenue in 2011 <lb/>Source: China Statistical Yearbook. <lb/>Each level of sub-national government shares their tax income with the levels of government below. <lb/>Provinces use various mechanisms: i) the sharing of specific taxes; ii) the assignment of specific taxes; iii) <lb/>the sharing of the increase in the yield from a base year; and iv) the assignment of an amount that depends <lb/>on a predetermined growth rate. On average, the largest share of all local taxes is taken by the prefectural <lb/>governments (Table 2). This is true of all individual local taxes except the property and resource taxes, <lb/>which mainly accrue to county and township governments.

Overall, non-tax sources of revenue represent slightly under half of their total <lb/>revenues, amounting to 2.2% of GDP (Table 3). Sub-national governments have significant income from <lb/>the ownership of state-owned enterprises, in contrast to the central government. The total amount of non-<lb/>tax income (excluding asset sales) amounts to nearly 30% of their total revenue. <lb/>In the past, fees were major part of non-tax revenue. They were administered through off-budget <lb/>funds mainly to fund education and transport. Since 2012, all fees have been administered through the <lb/>budget but reliance on fees remains. Indeed, these fees are one of the three elements of local governments&apos; <lb/>fiscal autonomy. The other two are income from land sales that accrues to extra-budgetary funds and the <lb/>financing of infrastructure though infrastructure development companies (which are a reflection of the <lb/>balanced budget requirements for local authorities that is embedded in the Budget Law). <lb/>On top of the non-tax revenue, sub-national governments raise significant amounts from the sale of <lb/>land-use rights for periods of between 30 and 70 years. These stem from the government&apos;s ownership of all <lb/>urban land and its monopoly of the right to transform land from agricultural to construction use. In 2009, <lb/>the gross revenue from these sales amounted to some 4.2% of GDP, rising to over 7% in 2010 and 2011, <lb/>before falling to just over 5% of GDP in 2012. However, not all of the land sale revenues represent profit <lb/>for the government, as compensation needs to be paid. In addition the land is sold fully serviced. The cost <lb/>of installing the road, water, drainage, electricity and telecom networks has to be deducted from the gross <lb/>sales revenue. In 2009, these two cost elements absorbed half of gross sales revenue. The net revenue from <lb/>land sales is concentrated on the county and prefecture governments where the profit from land sales is <lb/>equivalent to some 14% of their total revenue. By contrast, when the property market was in its infancy in <lb/>1999, net land sales revenues accounted for only 4.5% of revenue. These governments are constrained as to <lb/>the use that is made of such revenues: they can only be used to create new physical assets for the <lb/>government. <lb/></body>

The division of powers is <lb/>guided by the principle of giving full scope to the initiative and enthusiasm of the local authorities under <lb/>the unified leadership of the central authorities. <lb/>The people&apos;s congresses of provinces, and their respective standing committees, may adopt local <lb/>regulations. These must not contravene the Constitution, the law or the national administrative rules and <lb/>regulations. Local congresses must report such local regulations to the Standing Committee of the National <lb/>People&apos;s Congress for the record. <lb/>The split of responsibilities is set out in the Constitution. Local governments at and above the county <lb/>level conduct administrative work concerning the economy, education, science, culture, public health, <lb/>physical culture, urban and rural development, finance, civil affairs, public security, ethnic affairs, judicial <lb/>administration and family planning in their respective administrative areas. They also appoint or remove <lb/>administrative functionaries. <lb/>Local governments at and above the county level also direct the work of their subordinate departments <lb/>and of lower level governments, and have the power to alter or annul inappropriate decisions of their <lb/>subordinate departments and of lower-level governments. At the same time, they have some autonomy <lb/>within the limits of their authority and implement the laws and policies of the state in light of the existing <lb/>local situation. This hierarchical structure limits the extent to which decentralisation leads to policies that <lb/>differ markedly across the country. <lb/>Indeed, a close look at local government expenditure decisions reveals a highly centralised system in <lb/>which local governments are effectively agents acting on behalf of the central government (OECD, 2006a). <lb/>The contrast between the nominal decentralisation of responsibilities and the high degree of centralisation <lb/>of actual authority is further accentuated by the lack of elections or other formal mechanisms for holding <lb/>local officials accountable to the citizens under their jurisdiction. Moreover, the performance of <lb/>government officials at lower levels is judged according to criteria set out by higher levels of government. <lb/>Thus, although comparisons of the share of spending by sub-national governments in total public spending <lb/>appear to show that China has amongst the most decentralised public sectors in the world, this is <lb/>misleading. <lb/>ECO/WKP(2013)22 <lb/></body>

			<body>Without being autonomous, sub-national bodies make outlays accounting for around four-fifths of all <lb/>government expenditure (Table 4).

The <lb/>county level of government accounts for more than one-third of total spending and has the major share of <lb/>outlays, followed by the prefecture governments. Moreover, local government finances many public <lb/>infrastructure investment projects off-budget through local government financing platforms. Adding such <lb/>quasi-government spending, results in a further increases the share of sub-national spending. <lb/>Table 4.

This reflected a major change in the orientation of public spending towards spending on public <lb/>services rather than economic services – in line with the conclusions of an OECD report on Chinese public <lb/>finances (OECD, 2006a). This re-orientation followed a seven-year period when the government restored <lb/>spending after its collapse during the first half of the 1990s. The increase in sub-national public spending <lb/>was particularly pronounced at the prefectural and county levels as these are the levels of government that <lb/>deliver services to people. <lb/>Higher-level government has the power to determine the expenditure responsibilities of the level <lb/>immediately below it: provinces determine the assignments of prefectures, prefectures the assignments of <lb/>districts, counties and county cities, and the latter two the assignments of townships (Shen et al., 2012). <lb/>Consequently some have argued that higher-level governments have been increasingly devolving <lb/>assignments to lower local levels of government (Kamal-Chaoui et al., 2009; Li et al., 2010). The devolved <lb/>categories include not only pre-determined sub-national responsibilities, such as urban maintenance and <lb/>construction, but also the incremental part of service provision for education and healthcare spending. In <lb/>reality, though, this downward movement of expenditure reflected a change in spending priorities towards <lb/>those services provided at the sub-national level (especially at the county level) that was approved in <lb/>budgets by the National People&apos;s Congress. <lb/></body>

			<body>Horizontal balance between regions <lb/>Economic and fiscal inequality between regions is much higher in China than in most OECD <lb/>countries (Table 7). The tax sharing arrangements do not incorporate any redistributive formula and so the <lb/>inequality of tax revenue per capita is very similar to the inequality of GDP per capita. Indeed, in China <lb/>there is no correlation between the average tax rate for each province and its level of development. There is <lb/>considerable variation in the average tax rate due to factors linked to the structure of the economy of each <lb/>province. An analysis of variance suggests that around 80% of the variation in tax revenues per capita is <lb/>due the variation of per capita GDP, rather than tax rates. <lb/>Table 7.

For corporate taxes, when companies operate across several provinces, <lb/>it is extremely difficult to allocate profit between provinces.

Consequently, the entire profit of a company is allocated to the province where the company has its <lb/>headquarters. As a result Beijing and Shanghai have particularly high revenues from this source. Equally, <lb/>the tax sharing agreement allocates all taxes on services to provinces. However, service activities are not <lb/>distributed equally across the nation and here Beijing and Shanghai benefit again. Hainan though gains <lb/>ECO/WKP(2013)22 <lb/></body>

The Theil inequality index <lb/>summarises the distribution of a variable by calculating sum of the logarithms of the quotient of value for a group and the average for <lb/>all groups weighted by the share of the group. For example, when all population groups have the same income share as their <lb/>population share then the Theil index is zero. In this case, the calculation assumes that prefectures spend all their revenue in their <lb/>urban districts rather than in counties. <lb/>Source: OECD calculations and Ministry of Finance (2011a), 2009 Fiscal Statistics of Prefectures, Cities and Counties. <lb/>Within-province disparities in expenditure are also large, signalling limited service provision capacity <lb/>in some counties. Overall, the richest sub-provincial unit spends about 29 times as much per capita as the <lb/>poorest unit. The ratios between extremes are 13 times within PLCs, 15 times within county cities, and 26 <lb/>times within counties (Ministry of Finance, 2011a). In particular, unlike PLCs and county cities, counties <lb/>with limited fiscal resources have less leeway to provide matching funds for additional spending mandates <lb/>requested from superior authorities. This could result in substandard service delivery, for instance in <lb/>renovating school facilities in poor rural areas (Shen et al., 2012). <lb/>Inter-governmental transfers <lb/>Tax sharing <lb/>In China, almost half of national tax revenue is allocated to local governments through tax-sharing <lb/>agreements. Tax sharing can take several forms. Following Blöchliger and Petzold (2010), strict tax <lb/>sharing between government levels implies meeting four criteria simultaneously: <lb/>• Individual proportionality: The revenue share of each sub-central government is strictly related to <lb/>tax revenue generated on its own territory. <lb/> • Risk sharing: the amount of revenue allocated to the sub-central level is strictly related to the <lb/>total tax intake. <lb/> • Un-conditionality: The sub-central government is free to use the allocated revenue. <lb/> • Formula stability: The revenue share between the central and the sub-central government is <lb/>predetermined in advance and not changed during the period of the agreement.<lb/>China is unusual in that its tax-sharing system follows the strict model outlined above, in contrast to nearly <lb/>all OECD countries (Figure 6). Despite having no authority to borrow, sub-national governments are fully <lb/>exposed to the risk of fluctuations in tax revenues from either a factor specific to one province or general <lb/>business cycle fluctuations. The exposure to volatility is particular large for their share of corporate income <lb/>tax. They are also free to allocate the cash in line with their spending priorities subject to the overall <lb/>priorities set by the National People&apos;s Congress. There is individual proportionality in allocating taxes, <lb/>which encourages local governments to boost economic activity in their jurisdiction. <lb/>ECO/WKP(2013)22 <lb/></body>

			<body>Figure 6. Strict tax sharing and other forms of sub-national government revenue <lb/>Source: Blöchliger and Petzold (2010). <lb/>There is a well-defined formula for allocating different taxes, which has been slightly changed three <lb/>times since 1994. It has not been altered since 2003, when the central share in income taxes was raised <lb/>from 50 to 60%, the share of stamp duty on financial transactions rose from 50 to 97%, and the business <lb/>tax on the financial industry was assigned to the central government. Since the 1990s, the proportion of <lb/>total expenditure undertaken by sub-national government has risen considerably. The discrepancy between <lb/>a fixed revenue share and rising expenditure share has driven much of the growth in vertical fiscal <lb/>inequalities: by the time the system devised in 1994 was fully operational in 1999, the aggregate tax share <lb/>of sub-national government was 46% while their expenditure share was 69%; and by 2011, the tax share <lb/>had remained constant at 46% of total tax revenues, while the expenditure share had risen to 85%. A <lb/>mechanical calculation suggests that if the average tax share were raised to 62%, the gap between <lb/>expenditure and revenue would be lowered to the level observed in 1999. This would eliminate the gap <lb/>between revenue and expenditure for the aggregate of provincial, prefecture, urban districts and county <lb/>cities. The remaining fiscal gaps would be found almost exclusively at county level and would presumably <lb/>be concentrated in the poorest counties. <lb/>Transfers <lb/>One of the stated objectives of the 1994 tax reform was to recentralise decision-making and enable the <lb/>central government to better control policy implementation across the country. In order to accommodate a <lb/>strong increase in the share of expenditure in the areas covered by sub-national government not matched <lb/>by increased tax revenues, the government designed a new transfer system, which has three components: <lb/>• General transfers used to lower disparities in expenditure. <lb/> • Earmarked transfers used to subsidise local projects in certain areas subject to matching outlays <lb/>by local government. <lb/> • Compensation transfers designed to reduce the revenue loss accruing to some local governments <lb/>after the 1994 tax reform.<lb/>0 <lb/>10 <lb/>20 <lb/>30 <lb/>40 <lb/>50 <lb/>60 <lb/>70 <lb/>0 <lb/>10 <lb/>20 <lb/>30 <lb/>40 <lb/>50 <lb/>60 <lb/>70 <lb/>Switzerland <lb/>United States (2001) <lb/>Spain (2006) <lb/>Korea <lb/>Mexico <lb/>Sweden <lb/>Australia <lb/>Germany <lb/>Belgium <lb/>Unweighted average <lb/>Finland <lb/>Austria <lb/>Netherlands <lb/>United Kingdom <lb/>Czech Republic <lb/>Norway <lb/>Hungary <lb/>France <lb/>Luxembourg <lb/>Turkey <lb/>Greece <lb/>% <lb/>% <lb/>Autonomous taxes <lb/>Strict tax sharing <lb/>Tax sharing <lb/>Intergovernmental grants <lb/></body>

			<body>Each of the three groups has a number of sub-components (Figure 7). Some of the grants under the general <lb/>transfer component resemble earmarked grants. However, they do not require matching funds. Moreover <lb/>they accrue to provinces according to their GDP per capita. The wage adjustment grant varies by a factor <lb/>of four between eastern and western provinces. The compulsory education grant is only paid to rural <lb/>counties and compensated for the abolition of the agricultural tax, previously used to fund education. <lb/>Figure 7. Major components of central-provincial transfers <lb/>As of 2011 <lb/>Source: Ministry of Finance, Finance Yearbook 2012. <lb/>Immediately after the 1994 tax reform, the predominant form of transfer was that which compensated <lb/>regions that had lost as a result of the tax reform. The formula was designed to ensure that the grant <lb/>component fell gradually relative to GDP. As local tax receipts failed to keep up with expenditure, the <lb/>share of general and earmarked transfers rose (Figure 8). By 2011, these forms of transfer dominated. <lb/>There are some 20 categories of over 100 different recurrent transfers classified as earmarked transfers <lb/>while there are 18 types of relatively fixed types of grants defined as general transfers. The main form of <lb/>general transfer is the equalisation transfer, accounting for 19% of total transfers in 2011. It aims to lower <lb/>spending inequality across the country (Box 2). <lb/>Transfers from central to <lb/>provincial government <lb/>General transfers, <lb/>46% <lb/>Earmarked transfers, <lb/>42% <lb/>Equalisation transfer, 19% <lb/>Agriculture, forestry &amp; water, 12% <lb/>Pension and social security, 7% <lb/>Transportation, 9% <lb/>Wage adjustment for civil service, 7% <lb/>Affordable housing, 4% <lb/>Compulsory Education, 3% <lb/>Energy saving and pollution abatement, 4% <lb/>Social security and employment, 4% <lb/>Compensation transfers, <lb/>12% <lb/>Others, 10% <lb/>Others, 9% <lb/>ECO/WKP(2013)22 <lb/></body>

			<body>Figure 8. Different types of transfers as a share of national tax revenues <lb/>Source: Ministry of Finance, Finance Yearbook 2012. <lb/>Box 2. The design of the equalisation transfer <lb/>The formula used to calculate this transfer is based on the gap between standard revenue capacity and standard <lb/>current expenditures. The former is estimated using the tax bases and standard tax rates, while the latter are <lb/>calculated based on different per capital spending for different categories of outlays for adjusted cost factors such as <lb/>altitude, population density, temperature, transport distance and the proportion of the population belonging to minority <lb/>groups. The categories of spending include administration services, public safety, education, urban maintenance, <lb/>healthcare, environmental protection and social assistance. <lb/>The transfer amount is also adjusted for coefficients that take into account the size of the standard gap, the <lb/>actual gap, and the total amount allocated from central government revenue. Moreover, rewards in terms of additional <lb/>grants are given to provinces that achieve better fiscal equalisation results at sub-provincial levels (top five <lb/>performers). <lb/>Algebraically, the amount of the equalisation transfer for a province is given by: <lb/>񮽙񮽙 񮽙 = = <lb/>񮽙񮽙 񮽙 − − 񮽙 <lb/>− <lb/>񮽙 񮽙 + Δ 񮽙 + + 񮽙 <lb/>where: <lb/>ETi = the equalisation transfer for province i <lb/>TET = total equalisation grant available in the budget year. The size is determined by the increase in the shared <lb/>income tax allotted to the central government, plus an extra amount allocated on an ad-hoc basis, subject to annual <lb/>funding availability. <lb/>0 <lb/>5 <lb/>10 <lb/>15 <lb/>20 <lb/>25 <lb/>30 <lb/>35 <lb/>40 <lb/>45 <lb/>50 <lb/>0 <lb/>5 <lb/>10 <lb/>15 <lb/>20 <lb/>25 <lb/>30 <lb/>35 <lb/>40 <lb/>45 <lb/>50 <lb/>1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 <lb/>% <lb/>% <lb/>Compensation <lb/>General <lb/>Earmarked <lb/></body>

			<body>SEi = standard expenditure of province i. It is the sum of total standardised spending for 14 sectors. For each <lb/>sector, the standard national average standard expenditure per registered inhabitant is calculated. The national <lb/>average is then converted to a provincial average by adjusting for cost differences caused by the difference from the <lb/>national average of altitude, population density, temperature, transport distances, the number of civil servants, regional <lb/>wage differentials, number of students and the prevalence of minority groups. The cost factors vary according to the <lb/>spending category. Total standardised spending was calculated as the product of standardised spending per <lb/>registered inhabitant and the number of registered inhabitants (irrespective of where they actually live) during the <lb/>period 1995 to 2011. Since 2012, the population measure used is the registered population plus 15% of the difference <lb/>between the actual population and the registered population. <lb/>SRi = standard revenue of province i. For each type of tax, standard tax revenue is determined by multiplying the <lb/>standard tax base with the standard tax rate. <lb/>SE = total standard expenditure of the country. <lb/>SR = total standard revenue of the country. <lb/>σi = fiscal difficulty index of province i, calculated as the sum of spending on wages for civil servants, operating <lb/>expenses and payments for the basic livelihood allowance as a percentage to standard revenue. <lb/>∆i = adjustment index of province i based on the difference between the change in the actual grant and the <lb/>baseline predicted amount. <lb/>REi = reward grant allotted to province i, if any (only to top five performers of fiscal equalisation results at sub-<lb/>provincial levels). <lb/>Originally only 18 provinces were eligible for equalisation transfers. This was widened to 25 in 2002 and has remained <lb/>constant since. Six provinces remain ineligible for such transfer: Beijing, Guangdong, Jiangsu, Shanghai, Tianjin and <lb/>Zhejiang. <lb/>The grant system favours poorer areas <lb/>The strong weight given to the transfers designed to help poorer areas has successfully boosted <lb/>incomes in these areas. One metric to assess the success is the extent to which transfers to different areas <lb/>when measured relative to that area&apos;s GDP fall as GDP per capita increases. Across provinces, this is <lb/>indeed the case (Figure 9). Broadly speaking a 10% decline in relative income (from 50% to 45% of <lb/>average income) is associated with an increase of transfers of 1.2 percentage points of GDP. Other factors <lb/>are also important in determining the extent of the transfer. <lb/>ECO/WKP(2013)22 <lb/></body>

Transfers to provinces and the level of development <lb/>2009, Percentage of regional GDP, excluding Qinghai and Tibet <lb/>Source: OECD calculations and Ministry of Finance (2011a), 2009 Fiscal Statistics of Prefectures, Cities and Counties <lb/>The increasing importance of transfers for poorer areas is seen not just at the province level but also at <lb/>the county level. The bulk of counties receive transfers of less than 50% of their local GDP. Over the range <lb/>of transfers of zero to halve of local GDP (the bulk of all counties), there is a visible relationship between <lb/>the extent of the grant relative to local GDP and income levels (Figure 10, Panel A). However, once grants <lb/>account for more than halve of local GDP, reaching in a few cases over 200% of local GDP, other factors <lb/>become more important in determining grants. For these counties grants are not closely relative to local <lb/>GDP per capita (Figure 10, Panel B). <lb/>In practice, compensation grants have tended to reduce the extent of fiscal discrepancies over time. <lb/>While the major losers from the 1994 tax reform were higher income areas, which therefore initially <lb/>received more compensation, a 1% increase in per capita income is associated with only a ½ per cent <lb/>increase in compensation tax payments. Thus the compensation payment per unit of local GDP declines <lb/>with rising income. In any event, poorer regions are now more dependent on compensation grants than <lb/>richer ones are. At the level of the prefecture, for instance, the 50 prefectures with the lowest per capita <lb/>GDP are twice as dependent on this form of transfer as the 50 prefectures with the highest income. <lb/>The total of all other transfers has a much stronger redistributive effect than the compensation transfer. <lb/>At both the prefecture and the county level, there is a negative relation between this type of transfer and <lb/>GDP per capita. The relationship is much stronger at the prefecture level than at the county level. In both <lb/>cases, however, the overall explanatory value of income per capita in determining the level of transfers is <lb/>low, indicating that there are many other variables that come into play when determining the scale of sub-<lb/>national transfers. <lb/>0 <lb/>5 <lb/>10 <lb/>15 <lb/>20 <lb/>25 <lb/>30 <lb/>9.5 <lb/>10.0 <lb/>10.5 <lb/>11.0 <lb/>11.5 <lb/>Transfers (% of GDP) <lb/>Log of GDP per capita <lb/>ECO/WKP(2013)22 <lb/></body>

Transfers as percent of county GDP and GDP per capita <lb/>2009 <lb/>Source: OECD calculations and Ministry of Finance (2011a), 2009 Fiscal Statistics of Prefectures, Cities and Counties <lb/>At present, most weight is given to the registered population when determining the overall grant to a <lb/>province. If the outcome of the allocation is measured in terms of the transfer per registered inhabitant in <lb/>provinces, then there is no correlation between the income level of the province and the per capita grant <lb/>received by the province (Figure 11, panel A). To a first approximation, then, the average grant is the same <lb/>for each province on a per capita basis, with fluctuations according to the specific characteristics of the <lb/>province. However, just as a flat-rate per capita tax is regressive, a flat rate per capita transfer is <lb/>progressive, giving a higher increase in government revenue in poor provinces than in rich provinces. This <lb/>result, however, is due entirely to the high level of transfers per registered inhabitant that are received by <lb/>Beijing, Shanghai and Tianjin. Over the other 28 provinces and municipalities, there is a strong negative <lb/>relationship between per capita GDP and the total transfer per registered inhabitant (Figure 11, panel B). <lb/>0 <lb/>5 <lb/>10 <lb/>15 <lb/>20 <lb/>25 <lb/>30 <lb/>35 <lb/>40 <lb/>45 <lb/>50 <lb/>8 <lb/>9 <lb/>10 <lb/>11 <lb/>12 <lb/>Transfers (% of GDP) <lb/>Log of GDP per capita <lb/>A.

Centre to province transfers and provincial GDP per capita <lb/>Note: The provinces of Tibet and Qinghai have been excluded due to the extreme values of their transfers. <lb/>Source: Ministry of Finance, Fiscal Statistical Yearbook of China 2011 and 2001. <lb/>The method of calculating the equalisation grant was changed in 2012 to take the number of migrants <lb/>into account. The population used to calculate the per capita data was defined as the registered population <lb/>plus 15% of the difference between the actual and the registered population. This change will tend to <lb/>reduce the extent to which inter-provincial redistribution via transfers is correlated with income. However, <lb/>the equity of spending within provinces could be improved if provinces followed the same rules in making <lb/>their grants and higher transfers resulted in more spending on services for migrants. <lb/>The use of earmarked transfers <lb/>Intergovernmental transfers can serve several objectives (Oates, 1999; Ahmad and Searle, 2005; <lb/>Blöchliger and Vammalle, 2009; OECD/KIPF, 2012). Three goals stand out: <lb/>• Fiscal equalisation across jurisdictions for public service provision. <lb/> • Correction of negative and positive spillovers to induce the right amount of services. <lb/> • Provision of certain types and standards of services as determined by the central government.<lb/>Achieving these goals requires the combined use of &quot; unconditional grants &quot; (general transfers), and <lb/> &quot; conditional grants &quot; (earmarked transfers). The trade-off is complicated, with unconditional grants <lb/>providing more local autonomy but requiring local capacity and accountability, and conditional grants <lb/>giving the central government more control to meet its objectives (OECD, 2012 and Blöchliger and <lb/>6.5 <lb/>7.0 <lb/>7.5 <lb/>8.0 <lb/>8.5 <lb/>9.0 <lb/>9.0 <lb/>9.5 <lb/>10.0 <lb/>10.5 <lb/>11.0 <lb/>11.5 <lb/>Log of total transfer per habitant <lb/>Log of GDP per capita <lb/>B.

			<body>There are over 100 different types of earmarked grants, all of which are allocated on an ad hoc or <lb/>negotiated basis (Ministry of Finance, 2012b). Moreover, many of the grants are determined by individual <lb/>ministries and are not controlled by the Ministry of Finance. This undermines transparency relative to a <lb/>rule-based system. In particular, the system favours localities that lobby harder rather than those in greater <lb/>need. Furthermore, the centre lacks the monitoring mechanisms to ensure the effective use of these <lb/>earmarked resources, especially at sub-provincial levels (Ahmad et al., 2004; Shen et al., 2012). <lb/>The impact of the transfer system on fiscal inequality <lb/>China&apos;s transfer policy has become markedly more redistributive over the past decade. By 2010, the <lb/>reduction in the inter-provincial inequality through transfers was larger in China than in the OECD area <lb/>(Table 10). The correlation between transfers per capita and GDP per capita, which was positive in 2000, <lb/>had turned markedly negative by 2010. Despite the reduction in spending inequality, the fiscal disparity per <lb/>capita is high in China as compared with OECD countries. However, there is markedly less inequality in <lb/>fiscal spending than in GDP per capita. <lb/>Table 10.

Despite the great efforts in reducing <lb/>disparities within provinces, the sub-provincial Gini coefficient remains at 0.32, much higher than the 0.18 <lb/>at the provincial level (Table 10). Across prefectures regional inequality is quite low. On the other hand, <lb/>they do not appear to have been as successful in reducing fiscal inequalities in the counties for which they <lb/>are responsible. One particular problem for county governments is that earmarked transfers often require <lb/>matching funds which may not be available at county level. <lb/>The extent of fiscal equalisation within a province varies across provinces. High provincial income <lb/>levels are not associated with low intra-province inequalities, and vice versa (Figure 14). For instance, the <lb/>coastal provinces of Guangdong, Jiangsu and Shandong display high incomes and high inequality. Even so, <lb/>overall, between 2000 and 2010, there was a marked reduction in within-province inequality: the provinces <lb/>with the highest initial fiscal inequality registered the largest drops (Figure 15). <lb/>Figure 14.

The bulk of local public spending on education, healthcare and general public <lb/>services are salaries paid to civil servants, teachers, doctors and government administrative staff. Across <lb/>provinces, there is much less disparity in the number of government employees than in overall spending <lb/>(Figure 16, panel A). The dispersion in public spending within a province does not appear to be associated <lb/>with the level of income (Figure 16, Panel B). The dispersion of spending within a province does, however, <lb/>appear to be correlated with the dispersion of government employment (Figure 16, Panel C). However, the <lb/>dispersion of government employment within a province is extremely low – a Gini coefficient of around <lb/>0.03 seems typical.

			<body>• promoting a sound public finance supporting system, by allocating certain profits from SOEs to <lb/>service provision and improving the fiscal resources available to counties; <lb/> • prioritising spending on health and social protection rather than &quot; economic activities &quot; .<lb/>The government has highlighted the use of general transfers as means of increasing equality of access to <lb/>basic public services. This could involve, for example, grouping different earmarked project grants on <lb/>education together into a block general purpose grant allocated to education. Local government would <lb/>receive broad targets from higher governments rather than specific requirement to spend the money on <lb/>specific elements in education. The number of such general purpose transfers has increased in the past few <lb/>years and most involve some form of differentiation according to the relative income level of the province <lb/>or its geographic location. Another approach would be to increase the size of the general grants whose <lb/>most important element is funded by allocating the funds raised by the tax on personal incomes. <lb/>Property taxation <lb/>The introduction of taxation on residential property has been under consideration since 2003 as a <lb/>means of improving local tax revenue. China does have both property and land taxes but they do not apply <lb/>to residential real estate. The government has considered introducing a new residential property tax that <lb/>might be used either to raise local spending or to reduce the reliance of local governments on transfers <lb/>from higher levels of government. Most local governments in the OECD raise revenues from recurrent <lb/>taxation on residential property in their area. This form of taxation provides a linkage between the level of <lb/>local taxation and the provision of local services. It is a more common form of local taxation than local <lb/>income or sales taxes as property cannot be moved whereas the tax base for a sales tax or an income tax <lb/>can easily move. From the point of view of resource allocation, if the property tax can be levied <lb/>exclusively on land rather than on the building on the land, then such a tax is one of the least distortionary <lb/>taxes. <lb/>Five types of taxes are levied on property and land transactions in China (Table 13). Using the OECD <lb/>classification of taxes, only two of these would be classified as property taxes as they are levied annually <lb/>and based on the ownership of property. Such taxes have not been levied on residential property since <lb/>2007. Two of the other taxes are based on transactions either of property or land (but only when the land <lb/>changes use from agricultural to constructed land). In addition, there is a special capital gains tax that <lb/>applies only to land transactions. The tax on property transactions is one of the few taxes for which a <lb/>provincial government can set the rate (23 set the rate at 3%, six at 4% and two at 5%). In addition, if a <lb/>property in held for less than five years it is subject to the business tax at a rate of 5.5% on the sale of the <lb/>property. <lb/>Table 13.

			<body>The recurrent property tax is levied only on commercial property. There are two formulae for <lb/>calculating the tax burden: one applies a rate of 1.2% to the original value of the property less a <lb/>depreciation deduction of between 10 and 30%; the other is based on 15% of the rent generated by the <lb/>property. The urban land-use tax is based on a flat rate per occupied square metre. These two taxes are of <lb/>much less importance to the government as a source of revenue than in the OECD area (Figure 17). A <lb/>number of OECD countries raise between 3% and 4% of GDP in recurrent property taxes. Only four <lb/>OECD countries raise less than in China, where such recurrent taxes amount to 0.5% of GDP (Table 14). <lb/>The low yields are a reflection of the absence of taxation on residential real estate and of the fact that the <lb/>tax on urban land use is not based on market values. <lb/>Figure 17.

			<body>Two municipalities are piloting a recurrent tax on residential property. However, the design of these <lb/>pilots is very restrictive with nearly all property exempted from paying the tax. In the first full year of the <lb/>trial, the taxes raised only CNY 100 million and CNY 300 million in Chongqing and Shanghai respectively <lb/>(0.00001% and 0.000015% of Gross Regional Product in the areas concerned). <lb/>Besides the recurrent tax on property there are also taxes on property transactions. If the tax on land <lb/>appreciation is a regarded as a tax on property, then China raises 1.2% of GDP from property transactions <lb/>– four times the level in the OECD area. The yield is so high because property values are much higher <lb/>relative to incomes in China than in the OECD area, and because the number of transactions is high due to <lb/>the high rate of house construction. These factors more than offset the low level of second-hand property <lb/>transactions and the relatively low rate of the transactions tax. Overall, the sum of taxation on transactions <lb/>and usage in China (at 1.7%) of GDP is only slightly below the OECD average of 2.0% of GDP <lb/>(Figure 17). However, the structure is more economically damaging in that it hinders turnover in the <lb/>market, though the tax on land is economically efficient. <lb/>Introducing a nationwide residential property tax would exacerbate differences in fiscal revenue <lb/>across provinces. Past experience suggests that the tax rate would be uniform across the country. In this <lb/>case, the revenue for the property tax would mainly accrue to prefectural-level cities and their districts, <lb/>where the bulk of property is situated. Moreover, the level of property prices is highly correlated with the <lb/>level of per capita income (in 2011, a 1% increase in per capita GDP was associated with a 0.7% increase <lb/>in the average selling price of new property). Thus the property tax would accrue to the local authorities <lb/>that rely least on transfers from central and provincial governments. <lb/>The government also faces a dilemma in considering the introduction of a residential property tax. <lb/>Potential property buyers will estimate the present value of future property taxes and reduce the price they <lb/>are willing to pay by this discounted value. In turn this will reduce the price of the land-use right. But local <lb/>governments own all land and rely on the sale of new land-use rights to finance urban infrastructure. <lb/>Local authorities would probably lose revenue by introducing a residential property tax, at least while <lb/>the expansion of urban areas continues. If property taxes were set at a level such that annual revenues rose <lb/>to the average level in the OECD area, then the property tax rate would need to be set at 1% of the market <lb/>value of properties as urban property values are equivalent to 1.25 times GDP. Assuming a real discount <lb/>rate of 4%, this would lower house prices by 25% and land prices by 50%, given the average share of land <lb/>in property prices. In 2012 the gross revenue from land sales amounted to just over 5% of GDP, so the fall <lb/>in revenue from land-use rights would likely outweigh the increase in receipts from the property tax. <lb/>Moreover, land-lease income accrues immediately to local governments&apos; revenue, while it takes time to <lb/>realise the anticipated level of property taxation in that tax rate and coverage could only be raised gradually <lb/>from the level set in the pilot cases. Given that urbanisation is far from complete, local authorities have an <lb/>interest to maintain the current system of land sales and no property tax at least until the process of <lb/>urbanisation is nearly complete. At that point land sales will be much less important as a source of revenue. <lb/>Over the longer term, property taxation would then represent a stable source of revenue – albeit one that <lb/>would mainly accrue to the governments of richer areas. <lb/>Conclusion <lb/>The main features of China&apos;s current sub-national finance arrangements date back to the 1994 tax <lb/>reform. China has a multi-level government structure that shares national tax revenues through a system of <lb/>tax sharing and transfers, and divides spending assignments and responsibilities. Local governments have <lb/>hardly any discretionary power to modify taxation and are effectively agents acting on behalf of the central <lb/>government in expenditure decisions, though they have some non-tax revenue from fees, levies and <lb/>penalties. They can spend the profit from the sale of land-use rights subject to restrictions set by the central <lb/></body>

			<body>government. As the 1994 tax reform recentralised revenues and decision-making power, vertical gaps <lb/>between revenue and expenditure at sub-national levels have grown. In order to accommodate a strong <lb/>increase in the share of expenditure in the areas covered by sub-national government that has not been <lb/>matched by increased tax revenues, the central government has increased the scale of the transfer system. <lb/>Over the past decade, China&apos;s transfer policy has addressed the horizontal imbalances and become <lb/>markedly more redistributive. Nevertheless, fiscal disparities within provinces remain high and are much <lb/>greater than between regions in OECD countries. The extent of fiscal equalisation within provinces varies, <lb/>thus affecting the delivery of services. The government&apos;s plan to equalise service provision across the <lb/>country therefore calls for fine-tuning the intergovernmental transfer system and improving local revenue. <lb/>Some local governments are testing a residential property tax but not in a form that would substantially <lb/>raise tax revenue. A significant property tax would tend to lower the revenue from the sale of land-use <lb/>rights and would, in general, improve the fiscal position of those local governments that already have <lb/>strong budgets. <lb/></body>
