			<p>The latter is the subject of this Working Paper. How do public authorities manage public<lb/> spending on infrastructure in Africa? To what extent do budgetary processes and institutions<lb/> hamper the continent&apos;s infrastructural development? To answer these questions, the<lb/> Development Centre adapted the analytical framework it used to study similar issues in Latin<lb/> America and joined forces with the Collaborative Africa Budget Reform Initiative (CABRI) to<lb/> administer a questionnaire to its network of budget officials in African countries. The results are<lb/> mixed: while the efficiency of public expenditure per se is assessed rather positively,<lb/> infrastructure development too often suffers from inadequate medium-term planning. The<lb/> evidence assembled here suggests that attention should be paid not only to mobilising funds but<lb/> also to enhancing governments&apos; capacity to spend them effectively on development.<lb/></p>

			<p>This paper was produced as part of the OECD Development Centre&apos;s work on fiscal<lb/> policy in Africa. We hope it contributes to African governments&apos; efforts, supported by CABRI, to<lb/> increase the quality of public expenditure in infrastructure.<lb/></p>

			<figure>RESUMÉ<lb/> Dans quelle mesure les processus budgétaires et les institutions entravent-elles le<lb/> développement des infrastructures en Afrique ? Pour répondre à cette question, ce document<lb/> analyse les réponses de responsables du budget à un questionnaire administrés dans 22 pays<lb/> africains : Bénin, Botswana , Burundi, Cameroun , Cabo Verde, Tchad, République démocratique<lb/> du Congo, Djibouti, Gambie, Kenya, Lesotho, Madagascar, Maurice, Maroc, Namibie, Niger,<lb/> Rwanda, São Tomé et Príncipe, Sierra Leone, République du Soudan, la Tunisie et le Zimbabwe.<lb/> Ses principales conclusions sont les suivantes :<lb/> 1. La sélection des projets d&apos;infrastructure pourrait être améliorée. En particulier, le<lb/> processus d&apos;évaluation a besoin d&apos;une utilisation plus systématique d&apos;analyses coûts-avantages<lb/> et/ou coût-efficacité ; la sélection des projets n&apos;est pas suffisamment fondée sur l&apos;amélioration des<lb/> indicateurs physiques ; la société civile n&apos;est généralement pas consultée.<lb/> 2. Les projets prioritaires sont généralement mis en oeuvre en premier et les différents<lb/> niveaux de planification (national, sectoriel et local) se chevauchent souvent, même si les<lb/> objectifs locaux sont moins prioritaires.<lb/> 3. Les sources de financement de l&apos;infrastructure sont nombreuses et variées, mais les fonds<lb/> publics en représentent la majeure partie. La tendance à l&apos;augmentation des montants dépensés au<lb/> cours des dix dernières années est compatible avec le fonctionnement globalement positif de ce<lb/> mode de financement. Le principal défi est maintenant de lutter contre la tendance à favoriser les<lb/> nouveaux investissements au détriment des dépenses de fonctionnement et d&apos;entretien.<lb/> 4. En ce qui concerne la façon dont les gouvernements africains utilisent les fonds publics<lb/> pour le financement des infrastructures, l&apos;étude souligne que leur action est dans l&apos;ensemble<lb/> efficace, efficiente et conforme aux règles de la prudence budgétaire.<lb/> 5. Malgré ces constats généralement positifs, certains problèmes spécifiques méritent plus<lb/> d&apos;attention afin d&apos;améliorer la rentabilité des dépenses d&apos;infrastructure. Dans la phase de<lb/> planification, une utilisation prudente de l&apos;évaluation économique, financière, sociale et<lb/> environnementale permettrait d&apos;assurer la faisabilité et l&apos;opportunité des projets. Le manque<lb/> d&apos;entretien a des effets délétères sur l&apos;efficacité des investissements.

			<p>To what extent do budgetary processes and institutions hamper infrastructural<lb/> development in Africa? To answer that question, this report analyses the answers of budget<lb/> officials to questionnaires administered in 22 African countries: Benin, Botswana, Burundi,<lb/> Cameroon, Cabo Verde, Chad, Democratic Republic of Congo, Djibouti, Gambia, Kenya,<lb/> Lesotho, Madagascar, Mauritius, Morocco, Namibia, Niger, Rwanda, São Tomé and Príncipe,<lb/> Sierra Leone, Republic of Sudan, Tunisia and Zimbabwe.<lb/></p>

			<p>The main conclusions of the report are as follows:<lb/></p>

			<p>1. The selection of infrastructure projects could be improved. In particular the appraisal<lb/> process needs a more extensive use of Cost-Benefit and/or Cost-Effectiveness Analyses; the<lb/> selection of projects is not sufficiently based on the improvements of physical indicators; civil<lb/> society is generally not consulted.<lb/> 2. Highest priority projects are implemented first and the different planning levels<lb/> (national, sectorial, local) generally overlap even though local objectives are less of a priority.<lb/></p>

			<p>3. The sources of finance infrastructure are various and numerous, but public funds<lb/> represent the bulk of it. The growing trend in the amounts spent over the last ten years is<lb/> consistent with the overall positive functioning of this mode of financing. The main challenge is<lb/> now to circumvent the capital bias that tends to favour new investments over operation and<lb/> maintenance expenditures.<lb/> 4. Regarding how African governments use public funds for infrastructure financing, the<lb/> survey underlines the fact that their action is overall effective, efficient and subject to the rules of<lb/> fiscal prudence.<lb/> 5. Despite the general optimistic situation described above, some specific aspects deserve<lb/> more attention in order to generate more value for money in infrastructure spending. In the<lb/> planning stage, a careful use of economic, financial, social and environmental appraisal would<lb/> ensure the feasibility and the desirability of the projects. Inefficiencies related to the inadequate<lb/> attention to maintenance require a change in political objectives for infrastructure spending at<lb/> the planning and budgeting phases. There are inefficiencies related to hidden costs.<lb/></p>

			<head>I. INTRODUCTION<lb/></head>

			<p>For decades, the role of infrastructure in growth and development has been regularly<lb/> emphasised in economic literature. One of the first justifications relates to the Big Push theory<lb/> (<ref type="biblio">Rosentein-Rodan, 1943, 1961</ref>): large amounts of investments are needed to embark on the path<lb/> of economic development and in particular infrastructure investments. This question has gained<lb/> renewed interest since the late 1980s when the productivity of public expenditure was<lb/> questioned (<ref type="biblio">Aschauer, 1989</ref>).<lb/> Despite the debate on the magnitude of their effects (<ref type="biblio">OECD, 2006</ref>), the variety of channels<lb/> through which infrastructure affects growth is clearly identified. Infrastructure represents a<lb/> direct input into production through the services it provides (transport, energy, and information<lb/> technologies). Indirectly, it can also alter the composition of other inputs and play a role through<lb/> economies of scale and scope (<ref type="biblio">Bennathan et al., 2006; Straub, 2008</ref>). Infrastructure is also at the<lb/> core of structural transformation of economies (<ref type="biblio">UNCTAD, 2009; Lin, 2011</ref>).<lb/> Empirical evidence tends to confirm that these mechanisms are actually at work in the<lb/> infrastructure-growth relationship, even in Less Developed Countries (LDCs) (<ref type="biblio">Estache and<lb/> Garsous, 2010; Djiofack-Zebaze and Keck, 2006; Escribano, Guasch and Pena, 2009; Calderón,<lb/> 2009</ref>).<lb/> The other beneficial aspect of infrastructure is its action as an anti-poverty tool. The<lb/> provision of infrastructure services to the poor is crucial in order to ensure their connectivity<lb/> with economic activities and additional productive opportunities (Estache, <ref type="biblio">Foster and Wodon,<lb/> 2002</ref>). Isolation from economic centres created by a lack of infrastructure provision hampers the<lb/> development of local markets (Deichmann, <ref type="biblio">Shilpi and Vadkis, 2008</ref>; Mu and van <ref type="biblio">de Walle, 2011</ref>).<lb/> The beneficial expected impact of infrastructure is even stronger for poorer countries<lb/> (<ref type="biblio">Bennathan and Canning, 2000; Estache, 2010</ref>). Bridging infrastructure gaps is consequently a<lb/> high priority for LDCs and in particular in Africa. 1<lb/> However, Africa&apos;s infrastructure networks increasingly lag behind those of other<lb/> developing countries. The situation has not changed significantly since the 60s, despite an<lb/> increasing trend in public investment in infrastructure since the 2000s (<ref type="biblio">World Bank, 2010</ref>).<lb/> 1.<lb/> Since more than 34 of the 48 LDCs are African countries.<lb/> www.unohrlls.org/docs/ohrlls/ldcs/UN_LDC_Factsheet_130517.pdf<lb/> OECD Development Centre Working Paper No.323<lb/> DEV/DOC(2014)2<lb/></table>

			<head>9<lb/></head>

			<p>In this context, CABRI 2 and the OECD Development Centre have jointly undertaken<lb/> research with the main objective of assessing whether budgetary processes and institutions in<lb/> Africa are hampering (or not) infrastructural development. This question stems from the fact that<lb/> descriptive evidence and the economic literature on growth and public infrastructure highlights<lb/> the point that spending does not automatically translate into growth returns. The empirical<lb/> relation between economic growth and performance or physical indicators for infrastructure is<lb/> strong, whereas the relation between growth and public spending is relatively weak and in some<lb/> cases not significant: the underlying interpretation refers to public infrastructure spending on<lb/> governance and institutions (<ref type="biblio">Jimenez, 1995; Sanchez-Robles, 1998</ref>).<lb/> The way in which public authorities manage public spending on infrastructure through<lb/> budget processes and institutions is known as the concept of Public Financial Management (PFM).<lb/> This notion of governance in public spending can be summarised as the procedures, established<lb/> by law or regulation, for the management of public monies through the budget process, which<lb/> includes formulation, execution, reporting and analysis (<ref type="biblio">Potter and Diamond, 1999, in Prakash<lb/> and Cabezon, 2008; Lienert and Fainboim, 2010</ref>). Good public financial governance is achieved<lb/> when these procedures result in responsive public services through public spending that is<lb/> affordable, transparent and accountable, and which funds government priorities without<lb/> wastage or corruption (CABRI, 2010d).<lb/> PFM reforms in developing economies include interventions aiming at &quot; improving the<lb/> comprehensiveness of budget operations, building better links between annual allocations,<lb/> medium-term policy objectives and performance indicators, and computerising budget<lb/> management and expenditure controls &quot; (<ref type="biblio">de Renzio, Andrews and Mills, 2010</ref>). These initiatives<lb/> typically cover the issues related to infrastructure financing in Africa. Good PFM is therefore key<lb/> to ensuring infrastructure deployment, as the achievement of development objectives relies on an<lb/> efficient and effective delivery of services and a sustainable quality/level of services (<ref type="biblio">OECD,<lb/> 2011; Kioko et al., 2011</ref>). Good PFM can also help align different national agendas, one of the<lb/> tremendous challenges hampering the realisation of the cross-border infrastructure programmes<lb/> (<ref type="biblio">World Economic Forum, 2014</ref>).<lb/> The present report focuses on PFM in infrastructure and is based on data collected<lb/> through questionnaires administered to budget officials in 22 African countries: 3 Benin,<lb/> Botswana, Burundi, Cameroon, Cabo Verde, Chad, Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC),<lb/> <ref type="biblio">Djibouti, Gambia, Kenya, Lesotho, Madagascar, Mauritius, Morocco, Namibia, Niger, Rwanda,<lb/> 2</ref>.<lb/> The Collaborative Africa Budget Reform Initiative (CABRI) is a professional network of senior budget<lb/> officials in African Ministries of Finance and/or Planning. CABRI was officially launched on 14 May<lb/> 2008 in Maputo, Mozambique. On 3 December 2009, CABRI became a legal and independent<lb/> membership based organisation. See Appendix 1 for more details.<lb/> 3.<lb/> The survey also includes Asian and Pacific countries: Afghanistan, Bhutan, East Timor, Samoa and<lb/> Solomon Islands. A summary of the results for these countries is presented in Appendix 3.<lb/> Public financial management in infrastructure in Africa<lb/> DEV/DOC(2014)2<lb/> 10<lb/> © OECD/CABRI 2014<lb/> São Tomé and Príncipe, Sierra Leone, Republic of Sudan, Tunisia and Zimbabwe. 4 Building on a<lb/> survey conducted by the OECD Development Centre on Latin America (Nieto-Parra et al., 2013),<lb/> this analysis attempts to identify the main bottlenecks hindering effective infrastructure service<lb/> delivery throughout the policy-making process.<lb/> In particular, the survey investigates the main modalities that characterise budgetary<lb/> institutions, such as:<lb/> • degree of flexibility;<lb/> • transparency;<lb/> • sustainability;<lb/> • centralisation of decision, revenue collection and spending;<lb/> • participation of legislature;<lb/> • use of performance information/indicators.<lb/></table>

			<p>The report is organised as follows: a first section presents the role of planning and<lb/> budgeting in infrastructure spending in Africa. It emphasises the importance of a careful and<lb/> rigorous selection of projects, the parallel question of prioritisation, and the role of multi-year<lb/> planning. Section II reviews the various financial sources of infrastructure spending in Africa,<lb/> and their relative importance for the different infrastructure sectors, before covering the issue of<lb/> under versus over-spending. Section III describes the institutional architecture of public funds<lb/> used to finance infrastructure spending, with three segmentations for the origins of public funds:<lb/> i) general, earmarked or off-budget funds; ii) central versus local budgets, iii) budget versus<lb/> specialised institutions. Finally, Section IV investigates the way governments use public funds to<lb/> finance infrastructure, and in particular whether the criteria of efficiency, fiscal prudence and<lb/> effectiveness are met in</p>

			<table>Africa.<lb/> 4.<lb/> The survey may be subject to various sources of bias: stated (as opposed to revealed) preferences,<lb/> country-specific preferences affecting cross-country comparability, dominance of certain types of<lb/> infrastructure in policy-making processes.<lb/> OECD Development Centre Working Paper No.323<lb/> DEV/DOC(2014)2<lb/> 11<lb/> II. BUDGETING AND PLANNING OF INFRASTRUCTURE<lb/> INVESTMENTS<lb/> The policy making process for infrastructure consists of four phases: 5<lb/> 1. planning and prioritisation;<lb/> 2. execution;<lb/> 3. operation and maintenance;<lb/> 4. monitoring and evaluation.<lb/></table>

			<p>The first section of the report focuses on the planning and prioritisation stage. This stage<lb/> encompasses the budgetary process that will decide the allocation of resources to specific<lb/> priorities, 6 after the selection of projects.<lb/> A first sub-section covers the process of selection with an emphasis on appraisal and the<lb/> notion of value for money in infrastructure investments. The second sub-section presents the<lb/> notion of prioritisation in infrastructure spending first in a general way and then by opposing<lb/> regional/sectorial targets versus national objectives and development plans. In conclusion the<lb/> third sub-section defines the role of multi-year budgeting and planning in infrastructure.<lb/></p>

			<head>II.1. Selection of projects<lb/></head>

			<p>The project planning phase is usually the most challenging (OECD, 2013). The<lb/> effectiveness of infrastructure investment requires a careful selection of projects based on a<lb/> rigorous appraisal. This complex and recurrent process aims at providing a comprehensive<lb/> assessment of the investment (OECD, 2013).<lb/> Appraisal should ideally cover several criteria to assess both the desirability of the<lb/> infrastructure investment ( &quot; Should it be done? &quot; ) and its feasibility ( &quot; Can it be done? &quot; ). The set of<lb/> criteria includes the technical, financial, economic, social, institutional, environmental and<lb/> political aspects of the project (CABRI, 2010a). As such, appraisal represents both a useful toolkit<lb/></p>

			<head>5.<lb/></head>

			<p>This definition is based on a survey conducted by the OECD Development Centre that attempts to<lb/> identify the main bottlenecks hindering effective infrastructure service delivery throughout the policy-<lb/>making process (see OECD, 2013).<lb/> 6.<lb/> This question of prioritisation is covered in sub-section I.2. (II.2)<lb/></p>

			<table>DEV/DOC(2014)2<lb/> 12<lb/> © OECD/CABRI 2014<lb/> and a challenge for decision makers due to the profusion of information needed to conduct a<lb/> rigorous approach (CABRI, 2010a).<lb/></table>

			<p>Concretely, the appraisal process compares all costs and benefits related to an investment<lb/> project. The typical tools are cost-benefit (CBA) and cost-effectiveness analyses (CEA),<lb/> depending on the type of projects and the definition of costs and benefits. 7 While CBA is used to<lb/> ascertain whether benefits exceed costs, CEA compares the relative expenditure (costs) and<lb/> outcomes (effects) of two or more courses of action. The typical caveats and constraints related to<lb/> such analyses concern the way of estimating the impact of risk (International Transport Forum,<lb/> 2011) and the choice of a measure for the project worth (CABRI, 2010a).<lb/> The use of CBA and/or CEA in the design and monitoring of infrastructure projects is<lb/> quite low among the African countries surveyed (question Q7B): only 11 countries out of<lb/> 22 report using these techniques. The selection of infrastructure projects seems not to be based on<lb/> a careful and rigorous process of evaluation, and therefore needs improvement.<lb/></p>

			<p>The appraisal of infrastructure projects should also include the consultation of the<lb/> Ministry of Finance in order to ensure the feasibility of the projects through their fiscal<lb/> sustainability, before committing the government to any infrastructure plan. The data reports<lb/> that more than 75% of the countries surveyed consult systematically the Ministries of Finance to<lb/> ensure a realistic financing of infrastructure projects before committing the government<lb/> (question Q5H). Another type of consultation could be considered during the formulating stage<lb/> of policies and infrastructure plans. Major actors of society (civil society, private sector, industry,<lb/> etc.) should be extensively consulted to ensure the desirability of the investments and their<lb/> adequacy with society&apos;s needs and objectives. However, this type of consultation is less<lb/> widespread among the sample. Of the countries surveyed, only 50% have policies based on<lb/> extensive consultation with major actors from civil society, private sector and industry (question<lb/> Q7F). This situation needs to be improved as public consultation is a major element which is<lb/> becoming increasingly relevant for most African countries in order to avoid unforeseen delays in<lb/> project implementation (CABRI, 2010c).<lb/> The finality of appraisal is to ensure that the selected project will achieve value for<lb/> money, by reviewing all the aspects already mentioned (economic, financial, environmental…).<lb/> Box 1 below defines the concept of value for money which is actually essential to all investments<lb/> decisions.<lb/></p>

			<p>The economy criteria can be assessed through CBA or CEA, which needs to be improved<lb/> considering the low number of countries that report using these tools in their selection process.<lb/> Regarding the criteria of efficiency in relation to selection of projects, the results are<lb/> barely better. Eleven countries over the 22 in the sample have an objective of efficiency based on<lb/> the &quot; the maximum improvement in any physical indicator per dollar spent &quot; (question Q7A).<lb/></p>

			<head>7</head>

			<table>.<lb/> CEA are preferred over CBA when it is not easy to measure cost and benefit in monetary terms directly,<lb/> for instance in social infrastructure projects.<lb/> OECD Development Centre Working Paper No.323<lb/> DEV/DOC(2014)2<lb/> 13<lb/> Concerning effectiveness, Section IV will emphasise that the use of public funds to<lb/> finance infrastructure is globally effective among the countries surveyed (see questions Q5).<lb/></table>

			<head>II.2 Prioritisation<lb/></head>

			<p>The prioritisation of projects 8 is part of the planning phase and forms the premise of the<lb/> policy-making process in infrastructure. A better consistency of budget preparation/authorisation<lb/> with development priorities could ensure higher outcomes (<ref type="biblio">Dabla-Norris et al., 2011</ref>). The main<lb/> constraint related to Prioritisation is that it is a fundamentally a political process (<ref type="biblio">World Bank,<lb/> 1998</ref>). This reaffirms the need for a careful and rigorous selection and appraisal of infrastructure<lb/> projects, consistent with the resource implications over the life of the policy. This will ensure that<lb/> the prioritisation of infrastructure investments is actually based on objective and measurable<lb/> benefits for the economy that match available resources.<lb/> The data point to a reassuring situation. Of the countries surveyed, 82% report that the<lb/> infrastructure projects which are implemented are those with higher priority (question Q5F).<lb/> The prioritisation of projects also occurs by comparing and analysing the feasibility and<lb/> the desirability of:<lb/></p>

			<table>• Regional and sectorial plans, 9 as opposed to<lb/> • National and development plans<lb/> 8.<lb/> The survey will highlight another kind of prioritisation between current expenditures (operating and<lb/> maintenance) and capital investments (new investments).<lb/> 9.<lb/> Regional means local plans, defined within a country. Sectorial plans refer to infrastructure priorities.<lb/></table>

			<head>Box 1. Value for money: Definition<lb/></head>

			<p>Value for money is an essential criterion to meet for any kind of investment. It is<lb/> defined as the optimum combination of whole-life cost and quality (or fitness for purpose) to<lb/> meet the user&apos;s requirement. It can be assessed using the criteria of economy, efficiency and<lb/> effectiveness.<lb/> Economy: Reducing the cost of resources used for an activity, with a regard for maintaining<lb/> quality.<lb/> Efficiency: Increasing output for a given input, or minimising input for a given output, with a<lb/> regard for maintaining quality.<lb/></p>

			<p>Effectiveness: Successfully achieving the intended outcomes from an activity.<lb/> Source: Jackson, P. (2012).<lb/></p>

			<head>Public financial management in infrastructure in Africa<lb/></head>

			<table>DEV/DOC(2014)2<lb/> 14<lb/> © OECD/CABRI 2014<lb/></table>

			<p>In this case, prioritisation refers more to a choice between levels of action. <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> below<lb/> illustrates that there is no deep opposition between regional/sectorial priorities and national<lb/> plans, and that generally the different levels of infrastructure plans overlap.<lb/> Sectorial and national priorities are equally reported as key objectives by 19 countries.<lb/> This result highlights an integrated vision of infrastructure spending at a macro level. On the<lb/> contrary, local targets seem to be a lesser priority (with ten countries that quote them as key<lb/> objectives), while the rationale for local infrastructure targets is that micro projects fit final users&apos;<lb/> needs better.<lb/> According to <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> below, the overlapping of priorities is widespread as only six<lb/> countries report a unique priority (either infrastructure or national) while ten countries report<lb/> the three levels as key objectives when financing infrastructure; and six countries report that<lb/> expenditures are closely connected to national and infrastructure priorities.<lb/></p>

			<head>II.3. Multi-year budgeting and planning<lb/></head>

			<p>The time horizon of public finances is more extended than the fiscal year in which the<lb/> decisions are made (<ref type="biblio">CABRI, 2008</ref>). This is typically the case for infrastructure projects the lifetime<lb/> of which may lie between 1 or 2 years and 20 years. Budgeting infrastructure spending over<lb/> several years is thus crucial to follow the life cycle of the project. But multi-year planning also<lb/> requires ensuring the respect of fiscal discipline based on the yearly budget process and other<lb/> medium-term resources while at the same time financing objectives defined on a longer time<lb/> basis (<ref type="biblio">World Bank, 1998; Le Houerou and Taliercio, 2002</ref>).<lb/> Question Q5G of the present survey asks about the preparation of internal multi-annual<lb/> investment plans in infrastructure from line ministries. It appears that this practice is dominant<lb/> in Africa, with 14 out of 22 countries reporting that they have multi-year budgets. Quite<lb/> reassuringly, only three among them do not implement verification on whether their<lb/> infrastructure plans are compatible with Medium-term Expenditure Plans (see question Q5I).<lb/></p>

			<head>15<lb/> III. THE FINANCING OF AFRICAN INFRASTRUCTURE<lb/></head>

			<p>This second section describes how infrastructure projects are being financed in Africa. It<lb/> first details the different financial sources for funding infrastructure. It then analyses the<lb/> question of over versus under-spending in financing African infrastructure.<lb/></p>

			<head>III.1. The different sources of financing for infrastructure<lb/> III.1.1. An overview of the different sources<lb/></head>

			<p>The</p>

			<figure>sources of financing for infrastructure in Africa are various and numerous. As<lb/> confirmed in the survey with 12 countries out of 22 considering that there are a high number of<lb/> different fund sources for infrastructure (question Q7E).<lb/></figure>

			<p>The traditional distinction opposes public to private financing. However, an additional<lb/> distinction includes official development assistance (ODA) &quot; since infrastructure has been, and<lb/> continues to be, a major business for development agencies &quot; (<ref type="biblio">Estache, 2010</ref>). The Public Sector<lb/> infrastructure spending represents budget and off-budget spending (including state-owned<lb/> enterprises and extra budgetary funds). External sources or non-government financing refer to<lb/> ODA and non-OECD financiers (China, India and the Arab states) that generally propose<lb/> concessional funds subject to conditions and to private sector participation that has been<lb/> dominated by public-private partnerships (PPP) over the last years. 10<lb/> <ref type="table">Table 2</ref> presents the respective shares of each source of financing for each infrastructure<lb/> sector and by type of expenditure (<ref type="biblio">Briceño-Garmendia, Smits and Foster, 2008</ref>). 11<lb/></p>

			<p>Around two thirds of infrastructure spending in Africa is financed through the public<lb/> sector. 12 A similar domination of public over external funding appears for all infrastructure<lb/> sectors except ICT. The irrigation sector relies only on public funds to finance current and capital<lb/> investments.<lb/> 10. Concessions and privatisations are other means of private participation in infrastructure.<lb/> 11. Their study includes the following countries: Benin, Cameroon, Cabo Verde, Chad, Côte d&apos;Ivoire,<lb/> Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya, Lesotho, Madagascar, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, Niger, Nigeria,<lb/> Rwanda, Senegal, South Africa, Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia.<lb/> 12. The Public sector finances 45% of total spending through operation and maintenance expenditures and<lb/> an additional 20.8% through capital expenditures.<lb/></p>

			<p>Among external sources, the participation of the private sector is the highest with 20.8%<lb/> of total infrastructure spending, occurring in financing capital expenditures. The rest of capital<lb/> expenditures are financed by ODA and non-OECD financiers with respectively 7.9% and 5.5% of<lb/> total spending. The WSS sector exhibits a similar ranking of sources. ODA is the second source of<lb/> financing transport capital expenditures, followed by non-OECD financiers ex-aequo with the<lb/> private sector. In the power sector, non-OECD financiers are the second source of financing,<lb/> followed by ODA and the private sector.<lb/> It is noteworthy that current expenditures (operation and maintenance) taken as a whole<lb/> are only funded through the public sector, while capital expenditures are dominated by external<lb/> financing. Also notice that capital expenditures represent a larger share of total spending,<lb/> illustrating the typical capital bias in infrastructure that favours new investments over the<lb/> operating and maintenance expenditure. Here again, the pattern differs according to each<lb/> infrastructure sector. For instance, the power and irrigation sector are not affected by the capital<lb/> bias as their respective shares of operation and maintenance expenditures are both around 60%.<lb/> On the contrary, the bias is even more marked for the ICT and the WSS sectors.<lb/></p>

			<p>The rationale for private-sector involvement in infrastructure covers four dimensions<lb/> (OECD, 2013):<lb/> • improving value for money in public service delivery, by delivering an equivalent<lb/> quality of public services but at a lower cost;<lb/> • sharing risk to ensure that the public and private sectors support the risks for which<lb/> they are better suited;<lb/> • introducing competitive pressures through tendering process;<lb/> • bringing in additional funds with the access to equity markets.<lb/></p>

			<figure>OECD Development Centre Working Paper No.323<lb/> DEV/DOC(2014)2<lb/> 17<lb/></figure>

			<p>The degree of private financing for infrastructure projects and thus the final form of this<lb/> participation depends on the level of risk transferred from the public to the private sector, the<lb/> ownership of assets and the bundling of construction and operation (OECD<ref type="biblio">, 2008; Engel et al.,<lb/> 2009</ref>). At the end of the scope, with the higher exposure to risk, privatisation allows the private<lb/> entity to buy an equity stake in the state-owned utility and receive the associated residual<lb/> returns.<lb/> Over recent years, the main form of private participation in financing infrastructure has<lb/> been through public-private partnerships (PPPs). Box 2 below summarises a definition of PPPs<lb/> (CABRI, 2010b).<lb/></p>

			<head>Box 2. Public-Private Partnerships (PPP) in infrastructure<lb/></head>

			<p>PPPs refer to arrangements in which the private sector supplies infrastructure assets<lb/> and services that have traditionally been provided by the government.<lb/> Although there is no clear-cut definition of a PPP, most definitions include three key<lb/> characteristics:<lb/></p>

			<head>• private execution and financing of public investment;<lb/></head>

			<p>• an emphasis on both investment and service provision by the private sector; and<lb/> • risk transfer from the government to the private sector.<lb/></p>

			<p>PPPs appear to be particularly well suited to providing economic infrastructure,<lb/> primarily for three reasons:<lb/> 1. sound projects that address clear bottlenecks in the road, railway, ports, power<lb/> and other key sectors are likely to have high economic rates of return and,<lb/> therefore, to be attractive to the private sector;<lb/> 2. the private sector can be made responsible not only for construction but also for<lb/> service provision; and<lb/> 3. to the extent that these services are supplied directly to final users, charging is<lb/> both feasible and, from an efficiency standpoint, desirable.<lb/></p>

			<p>Despite their growing use over the last two decades across developing countries in general<lb/> and African countries in particular, there is still no consensus on whether or not PPPs in<lb/> infrastructure are good or bad for developing countries (<ref type="biblio">Mukhopadhyay, 2011; Patel &amp; Bhattacharya,<lb/> 2010; Joasiah et al., 2010; Estache, 2006; Estache &amp; Wren-Lewis, 2009 and 2010; Jerome, 2008</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<head>III.1.3. Other external sources<lb/></head>

			<p>The other sources of non-government financing of infrastructure concern project funding<lb/> from development partners, through grants that mainly finance &quot; social &quot; infrastructure (hospitals,<lb/> schools and water services); and concessional loans that fund &quot; economic &quot; infrastructure (CABRI,<lb/> 2010b).<lb/> Leaving aside the traditional debate on aid effectiveness, financing of infrastructure<lb/> projects by development agencies and partners (either multilateral or bilateral) may suffer from<lb/> the same weaknesses as public funding. Aid would prove to be inefficient in tackling issues<lb/> related to weak implementation and management capacity, non-transparent procurement<lb/> practices and inadequate attention to maintenance and operations.<lb/></p>

			<p>Specific measures have been recommended by donors to improve project planning and<lb/> execution during the construction phase. Lack of capacity in implementation and management is<lb/> dealt with by providing technical assistance and administrative support in addition to financing.<lb/> Donors also prefer to apply their own procedures rather than those of the beneficiary country.<lb/> However, as seen in <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>, current expenditures of operation and maintenance are financed<lb/> exclusively through the public sector, leading to a deterioration of assets after the external<lb/> sources of financing have delivered the infrastructure.<lb/></p>

			<head>III.2. Over versus under-spending<lb/></head>

			<p>The issues of under and over-spending in infrastructure are analysed in questions Q1A to<lb/> Q1F. Under-spending concerns a situation in which spending is actually below the target<lb/> indicated in the planning budget, while over-spending refers to an actual disbursement that is<lb/> over the target.<lb/> Out of the 22 surveyed countries, 15 report an under-spending in infrastructure. Among<lb/> them, only three (DRC, Madagascar and São Tomé and Príncipe) do not have corresponding<lb/> reforms already in place and/or in the pipeline, meaning that this specific issue is generally<lb/> identified by governments and that there is a will to improve it.<lb/> The questionnaire then asks respondents why there is under/over-spending in<lb/> infrastructure projects. 13 Table 3 below synthesises the answers. The most quoted reason is the<lb/> lack of resources, reported by six countries. 14 The second main reason is a lack of capacity in the<lb/> earlier stages of infrastructure projects. Coupled together, they lead to a situation where<lb/> improper objectives match inappropriate resources. Better design and project definitions are<lb/> 13. Notice that even those that do not report one or the other issue can answer.<lb/> 14. Rwanda is classified in this first reason but reports actually an issue on the predictability of resources<lb/> from donors.<lb/></p>

			<table>OECD Development Centre Working Paper No.323<lb/> DEV/DOC(2014)2<lb/> therefore needed to state realistic targets, for instance through Cost-Benefit (BBA) and/or Cost-<lb/>Effectiveness Analyses (CEA). The first section showed that only 10 countries out of 22 use CBA<lb/> and/or CEA to design and monitor their infrastructure projects (Q7B). Concerning the matching<lb/> of targets with resources, question Q5E illustrates this is a critical issue as infrastructure projects<lb/> are designed to match the available funds at the planning stage only in 10 of 22 countries.<lb/> Table 3. The reasons for under-spending<lb/> Q1B/C: Why do you think there is under-spending in infrastructure projects?<lb/> Lack of resources<lb/> DRC, Gambia, Madagascar, São Tomé and Príncipe, Sudan,<lb/> Zimbabwe (Rwanda: unpredictability of Donor Aid<lb/> resources)<lb/> Lack of capacity in project planning, design and<lb/> definition<lb/> Benin, Cameroon, Kenya, Lesotho, Mauritius<lb/> Lack of capacity in implementation<lb/> Namibia, Burundi , Lesotho<lb/> Legal issues and procurement<lb/> Benin, Kenya, Mauritius, Niger<lb/></table>

			<p>In Sierra Leone, the issue of under-spending is related to the post-conflict situation that<lb/> paid more attention to rebuilding social rather than economic infrastructure. But a shift in trend<lb/> has been occurring since 2007 with a greater emphasis on roads, water and energy.<lb/> Botswana, Cabo Verde, Morocco and Tunisia suffer from an over-spending in<lb/> infrastructure. For Cabo Verde and Morocco, over-spending relates to past and on-going large<lb/> infrastructure projects at the national level. In Botswana and Tunisia, over-spending stems from<lb/> a lack of proper project planning and a correct evaluation of costs (to prevent overruns), and<lb/> issues in legal and procurement frameworks that prolong the execution phase (with the corollary<lb/> issues of exchange rate and inflation impact).<lb/></p>

			<p>These four countries already have reforms on-going or foreseen to avoid over-spending,<lb/> highlighting the willingness of governments to tackle this issue.<lb/></p>

			<p>Djibouti and Sudan both report issues of under AND over-spending. For Sudan, the<lb/> former is due to a lack of sufficient resources and the latter occurs in some projects due to a long<lb/> period of implementation, price escalation of materials and other delays for security reasons.<lb/> Chad and Kenya report that their infrastructures are affected by neither under or over-spending<lb/> in infrastructures.<lb/></p>

			<head>IV. INSTITUTIONAL ARCHITECTURE FOR FINANCING<lb/> INFRASTRUCTURE<lb/></head>

			<p>As shown in <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>, public sector financing represents the larger source of funds for<lb/> infrastructure projects. This Section thus details the way in which governments use the different<lb/> sources of public funds. The first sub-section presents the question of revenue mobilisation and<lb/> the associated issue of managing deficits.<lb/></p>

			<head>IV.1. Revenue mobilisation and financing through deficit<lb/></head>

			<p>Revenue mobilisation is actually the first predictable and sustainable source of financing<lb/> for development and creates budgetary space to finance priority expenditures (Banque <ref type="biblio">de<lb/> France, 2011</ref>). As already stated in Section I, infrastructure projects generally last more than the<lb/> fiscal year in which the decisions are made, creating a need to manage the financing through<lb/> deficit to prevent debt from accumulating.<lb/> Question Q1G first investigates these notions of revenue mobilisation and their adequacy<lb/> with targets, by asking whether closely linking expenditures to revenues is a key objective when<lb/> financing infrastructure. Indeed, one of the main issues in financing infrastructure is the<lb/> feasibility of the project that relies on the availability and mobilisation of funds. Ten countries<lb/> out of the 22 surveyed report linking revenues to expenditures as a key objective, emphasising<lb/> that the question of revenue mobilisation is not widely taken into account in Africa.<lb/></p>

			<p>However, as Section IV will review, other modalities of revenue mobilisation and the<lb/> management of financing through deficits have better indicators in Africa, as summarised in<lb/> <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref> below.<lb/></p>

			<figure>Figure 1. Revenue mobilisation<lb/> IV.2. The institutional architecture of public funds<lb/> After reviewing the different potential sources of infrastructure financing in the previous<lb/> sub-section, here we detail the ways in which public funds for infrastructure are used among the<lb/> 22 African countries of the survey. The survey only asks about public funds which are relevant in<lb/> a framework where two thirds of infrastructure spending is financed through public funds.<lb/> The survey investigates three axes of segmentation to distinguish between the origins of<lb/> public funds.<lb/> 1. general, earmarked and off-budget funds (questions Q2A to Q2F)<lb/> 2. central versus local funds (questions Q3A to Q3F)<lb/> 3. budget versus specialised institutions (questions Q4A to Q4F)<lb/></figure>

			<head>IV.2.1 General, earmarked and off-budgets funds<lb/></head>

			<p>General funds are defined in the budget contrary to off-budget funds that are special<lb/> funds owned by the government but are not part of the budget. Earmarked funds are attached to<lb/> a requirement that devotes a source of revenue to a specific public expenditure.<lb/></p>

			<figure>Figure 2 summarises the origins of public funds according to this distinction. All the<lb/> countries in the survey finance infrastructure through general funds in whole or in part, but half<lb/> of the countries have only this source of funds. The use of off-budget funds is the scarcer one<lb/> (7 countries out of 22). The use of earmarked funds is widespread with ten countries reporting<lb/> this source as a way to finance infrastructure.<lb/> 0<lb/> 2<lb/> 4<lb/> 6<lb/> 8<lb/> 10<lb/> 12<lb/> 14<lb/> 16<lb/> 18<lb/> 20<lb/></figure>

			<figure>Figure 2. Distribution between general, earmarked and off-budget funds<lb/></figure>

			<p>All the surveyed countries report an increasing amount of financing through general<lb/> funds over the last ten years. All the countries also describe as positive the functioning of this<lb/> financing. Nonetheless, 15 countries report the existence of on-going or foreseen reforms to<lb/> improve the financing through general funds. And all countries except two (Botswana and<lb/> Niger) would also make proposals for reforms. This emphasises the fact that the increasing<lb/> amounts of money provided by general funds are being given particular attention by<lb/> governments in order to ensure the efficiency and effectiveness of expenditures.<lb/></p>

			<p>The question is whether the predominance of this source of funds is a positive<lb/> characteristic or not. The African road sector is a typical example of the debate on whether or not<lb/> funds should be earmarked to finance infrastructure spending. Proponents of earmarked funds<lb/> claim that this scheme reduces bureaucracy (and corruption), leads to speedy completion of<lb/> projects, and reduces construction costs (Beuran, <ref type="biblio">Castaing and Rablland, 2013</ref>). Earmarked funds<lb/> are also supposed to increase stability in the sector by preventing a reallocation of resources<lb/> during the project process due to a recession episode for instance that could lead to a disruption<lb/> in the execution of the infrastructure investment.<lb/></p>

			<p>As an illustration of the positive use of earmarked funds, a large number of countries<lb/> (ten) also use them in addition to general funds to finance infrastructure spending. Among them,<lb/> eight countries report an increasing trend in the amount of financing through this specific kind of<lb/> fund over the last ten years. The same eight countries describe as positive the functioning of<lb/> financing infrastructure through earmarked funds. Nevertheless, they still have ongoing and/or<lb/> foreseen reforms to improve this source of financing.<lb/></p>

			<figure>Lesotho and Sudan do not describe the functioning of earmarked funds as positive but<lb/> they are also the only two countries without an increasing amount of financing through this<lb/> 50%<lb/> 18%<lb/> 5%<lb/> 27%<lb/> General funds only<lb/> General &amp; Earmarked funds<lb/> General &amp; off-budget funds<lb/> General &amp; Earmarked &amp; off-budget funds<lb/></figure>

			<p>Namibia and Niger do not use earmarked funds to finance infrastructure but consider as<lb/> positive the functioning of this source of financing. This belief is specifically illustrated in<lb/> Namibia where reforms are ongoing and/or foreseen to improve the financing of infrastructure<lb/> through earmarked funds.<lb/> Off-budget funds are rarely used for infrastructure spending in Africa as only seven<lb/> countries out of the 22 surveyed finance infrastructure through government funds not reported<lb/> in the budget. Over the last ten years, the trend in the amount of financing infrastructure through<lb/> off-budget funds has been increasing in four out of the seven countries. 16 Yet, only three of them<lb/> (Morocco, Tunisia and Zimbabwe) describe as positive the functioning of off-budget<lb/> infrastructure financing. Among the remaining four countries that use off-budget funds but<lb/> consider its functioning as negative, only DRC has on-going and/or foreseen reforms to improve<lb/> it. Among the other countries that do not actually finance infrastructure through off-budget<lb/> funds, Cameroon, Djibouti and Namibia consider off-budget funds as positively functioning and<lb/> also have reforms in the pipeline to improve this source of financing.<lb/></p>

			<p>Whatever the composition of the portfolio of fund sources, general funds are mainly used<lb/> to finance new investments. Maintenance expenditures are financed through general funds in<lb/> only six countries (Benin, Madagascar, Morocco, Rwanda, Sierra Leone and Zimbabwe), while<lb/> current expenditures are even less quoted as a destination item for general funds (Burundi,<lb/> Namibia and Sierra Leone).<lb/></p>

			<p>Similar patterns appear for earmarked funds even though the pre-eminence of new<lb/> investments is less pronounced. Six countries out of the ten that use earmarked funds to finance<lb/> infrastructure dedicate these funds to new investments. Rwanda also used earmarked funds to<lb/> finance maintenance expenditures, as well as three other countries. 17 While Djibouti does not use<lb/> earmarked funds to finance infrastructure, it would potentially dedicate them to financing<lb/> maintenance. Namibia and São Tomé and Príncipe also would use earmarked funds to finance<lb/> current expenditures.<lb/> Among the seven countries that finance infrastructure through off-budget funds, new<lb/> investments and maintenance are equally quoted as destination items. 18 Among the countries<lb/> that actually use off-budgets funds for infrastructure, only Kenya dedicates this source of<lb/> financing to current expenditures. However, if we include those countries that do not effectively<lb/> rely on off-budget funds (but yet answer question Q2F), the distribution of funds between the<lb/> different investments puts new investments and current expenditures on top: <ref type="biblio">Cameroon</ref> and São<lb/> Tomé and Príncipe would allocate off-budget funds to new investments and Djibouti and<lb/> Namibia to current expenditures.<lb/> 15.

DRC and Morocco for new investments; Tunisia and Zimbabwe for maintenance; Rwanda for both.<lb/> Public financial management in infrastructure in Africa<lb/> DEV/DOC(2014)2<lb/> 24<lb/> © OECD/CABRI 2014<lb/></table>

			<p>The distribution of funds between the different types of infrastructure spending<lb/> illustrates quite well the issue of a capital bias that disfavours operation expenditures in<lb/> infrastructure against more &quot; visible &quot; investments .19 It emphasises the issue of a lack of resources<lb/> for maintenance that hampers the good functioning and delivery of infrastructure services in<lb/> Africa. Institutional reforms are needed to place more emphasis on current expenditures and<lb/> maintenance rather than on new investments.<lb/></p>

			<head>IV.2.2 Central versus local funds<lb/></head>

			<p>The opposition between central and local funds rests upon the idea that local budgets<lb/> may be more relevant to finance infrastructure projects as they peg more closely to local<lb/> priorities. However, the lack of available resources at the local level may hamper the<lb/> effectiveness of this source of financing (<ref type="biblio">World Bank, 2010</ref>); and in particular in developing<lb/> countries (<ref type="biblio">Glaeser, 2013</ref>). Despite the expectation that decentralisation of public investments<lb/> should deliver greater efficiency in the provision of public goods and services, empirical<lb/> evidence points to difficulties in achieving this objective (<ref type="biblio">de Mello, 2010</ref>). This is typically the<lb/> case in Burundi where resource allocation to local budgets is too weak to finance decentralised<lb/> infrastructure (question Q7L). Centralisation of decision-making powers during budget<lb/> formulation can also be preferred to ensure fiscal discipline (CABRI, 2008).<lb/> The great majority of the surveyed countries (12) finance their infrastructure spending<lb/> through a mix between central and local budgets. The ten remaining countries use only central<lb/> budgets as a source of funds for infrastructure investments.<lb/> Over the last ten years, the trend in the amount of financing through central AND local<lb/> budgets has been increasing in almost all countries. Decreasing and stable trends have concerned<lb/> financing through local budgets only and happened in four countries: Botswana, Madagascar<lb/> and Zimbabwe (decreasing), and Lesotho (stable).<lb/> The functioning of each mode of financing is described as positive as a whole. Only<lb/> Botswana, Madagascar and Zimbabwe report a negative functioning for local budgets that is<lb/> consistent with the decreasing trend highlighted in the previous question.<lb/> All countries except three 20 have on-going and foreseen reforms to improve financing<lb/> through both central and local budgets. While considered as positively functioning globally, the<lb/> two modes of financing may still be improved so as to reach the highest levels in effectiveness<lb/> and efficiency in delivery infrastructure items.<lb/></p>

			<figure>In 18 countries out of 22, central budget funds finance new investments. The exceptions<lb/> are Namibia where central budgets finance current expenditures, Sierra Leone where central<lb/> 19. This is an issue typical of the African infrastructure sector as will be showed in the following analyses<lb/> of central versus local funds, and budget versus specialised institutions.<lb/> 20. Madagascar and São Tomé and Príncipe have no reforms for the two modes of financing; Sierra Leone<lb/> has reforms for financing through central budgets only.<lb/> OECD Development Centre Working Paper No.323<lb/> DEV/DOC(2014)2<lb/></figure>

			<p>budgets finance maintenance, current expenditures and new investments and Zimbabwe where<lb/> central funds are used to ensure maintenance needs. Note that Zimbabwe reports maintenance<lb/> for both central and local budget use. Apart from Sierra Leone and Zimbabwe, maintenance is<lb/> financed only through local budgets and in only four countries (Burundi, Kenya, Morocco and<lb/> São Tomé and Príncipe). In the other countries that finance infrastructure through local budgets,<lb/> new investments again constitute the bulk of expenditures.<lb/></p>

			<p>The capital bias against current and maintenance expenditures highlighted in the<lb/> previous sub-section on the distinction between general funds versus earmarked and off-budget<lb/> funds is confirmed here.<lb/></p>

			<head>IV.2.3. Budget versus specialised institutions<lb/></head>

			<p>The last opposition in funds source for infrastructure spending investigated in the survey<lb/> concerns financing through:<lb/></p>

			<p>• Budget institutions such as the Ministries of Finance or Infrastructure as opposed to<lb/> • Specialised institutions, defined in the survey as state-owned-company, regulatory<lb/> agency, external board fund to the Ministry of Finance/Infrastructure.<lb/> Djibouti, Morocco, Rwanda, Sierra Leone finance infrastructure spending through<lb/> specialised institutions only. The rest of the countries all use budget institutions with a similar<lb/> share between budget only (nine countries) and a budget-specialised institutions mix (nine<lb/> countries). <ref type="table">Table 4</ref>			<figure>below presents the distribution of countries according to each composition of<lb/> fund sources.<lb/> Table 4. Budget versus specialised institutions<lb/> Q4A: Is infrastructure financed through budget institutions and/or specialised institutions?<lb/></figure>

			<p>Budget institutions only<lb/> Benin, Botswana, Chad, Lesotho, Madagascar, Namibia, Niger,<lb/> São Tomé and Príncipe, Tunisia<lb/></p>

			<p>Specialised institutions only<lb/> Djibouti, Morocco, Rwanda, Sierra Leone<lb/> Budget AND specialised Institutions<lb/> Burundi, Cameroon, Cabo Verde, DRC, Gambia, Kenya,<lb/> Mauritius, Sudan, Zimbabwe<lb/></p>

			<figure>Over the last ten years, the trend in the amount to finance infrastructure through<lb/> budget and specialised institutions is globally increasing, the two exceptions being Kenya with<lb/> a decreasing trend for budget funds, and DRC with also a decreasing trend for specialised<lb/> institutions.<lb/> Out of 22 countries, 16 describe as positive the functioning of financing infrastructure<lb/> through budget and specialised institutions. The three exceptions concern Djibouti and DRC for<lb/> specialised institutions and Kenya for budget, consistent with the decreasing trend in the amount<lb/> Public financial management in infrastructure in Africa<lb/> DEV/DOC(2014)2<lb/> 26<lb/> © OECD/CABRI 2014<lb/></figure>

			<p>to finance infrastructure for the last two. 21 Although Kenya has a negative functioning of<lb/> financing infrastructure through specialised institutions, and is the only country without on—<lb/> going or foreseen reforms to improve it, all the other countries, on the contrary, are undertaking<lb/> such reforms or have these in the pipeline.<lb/></p>

			<p>Whatever the source of financing, new investments are once again the first destination<lb/> items. Burundi and Kenya finance maintenance through specialised budgets, while Benin and<lb/> Tunisia use budget institutions. Finally, Zimbabwe&apos;s budget and specialised institutions both<lb/> finance maintenance. Namibia, Rwanda and Sierra Leone are the only countries to report the<lb/> financing of current expenditures.<lb/></p>

			<p>Here again the capital bias that favours new investments against current and<lb/> maintenance operations is emphasised.<lb/> 27<lb/></p>

			<head>V. ROLE OF GOVERNMENTS IN THE USE OF PUBLIC FUNDS<lb/></head>

			<p>This last section questions how the role of governments should be evaluated in the use of<lb/> public funds for infrastructure financing. Three specific notions are under consideration for<lb/> evaluation in the survey:<lb/> 1. The effectiveness of governments in using public funds for infrastructure financing,<lb/> which compares the actual achievements to the initial targets defined in the<lb/> infrastructure projects.<lb/></p>

			<p>2.</p>

			<figure>Fiscal prudence which measures whether fiscal rules related to infrastructure<lb/> financing are appropriate to support and achieve the project objectives without<lb/> causing a fiscal crisis.<lb/></figure>

			<p>3. The efficiency of governments in using public funds for infrastructure financing,<lb/> which compares the actual achievements to the initial resources, devoted to the<lb/> infrastructure projects.<lb/></p>

			<head>V.1. Is public financing of infrastructure effective in Africa?<lb/></head>

			<p>As explained earlier, the notion of effectiveness measures the differences between the<lb/> objectives targeted and the results actually achieved.<lb/> The first way to achieve effectiveness is therefore to state credible, sustainable and<lb/> quantifiable objectives in the first stages of the project. Defining precise and quantifiable targets<lb/> provides tools and indicators to measure the degree of effectiveness of public funds. Measuring<lb/> effectiveness then stems from monitoring the progress in the fulfilment of the objectives.<lb/> In these respects, among the 22 surveyed countries, the use of public funds to finance<lb/> infrastructure is globally effective. In 17 countries, the national infrastructure policy is<lb/> formulated in terms of specific targets against which achievements in the use of funds can be<lb/> measured (</p>

			<figure>question Q5C). The monitoring of target achievements is quite widespread in Africa<lb/> as 14 countries out of 22 in the survey report using this process (question Q5D). Moreover, the<lb/> great majority of countries (with 18 out of 22) primarily implement the infrastructure projects<lb/> with the highest priority, meaning that the most important targets are supposed to be achieved<lb/> first (question Q5F).<lb/></figure>

			<p>The effectiveness of governments in using public funds to finance infrastructure is also<lb/> questioned through the existence of alternative means to achieve the same objectives. To some<lb/></p>

			<figure>Public financial management in infrastructure in Africa<lb/> DEV/DOC(2014)2<lb/> 28<lb/> © OECD/CABRI 2014<lb/> extent, the effectiveness of this financing mode is weakened according to the answers to<lb/> questions Q5A and Q5B. Only seven countries consider that funds for financing infrastructure<lb/> based on public resources could not be available through other means (question Q5A) and<lb/> 16 countries think the same objectives could have been achieved through policy reforms<lb/> (question Q5B). However, this last point is not a concrete re-assessment of public action in<lb/> infrastructure: it emphasises the fact that governments may have other means at their disposal<lb/> than direct funding to achieve infrastructure targets.<lb/> Globally, governments of African countries have an effective use of public funds to<lb/> finance infrastructure. Among them, Benin, Madagascar, Namibia, Niger, Rwanda and Sierra<lb/> Leone perform the best while Kenya and Zimbabwe report no positive indicator of effectiveness<lb/> as measured in the survey.<lb/> V.2. Does public financing of infrastructure in Africa follow the rules of fiscal<lb/> prudence?<lb/></figure>

			<p>Fiscal prudence policies aim at maintaining proper balance between borrowing,<lb/> expenditure and saving in order to support economic growth and achieve other social objectives<lb/> in a sustainable way.<lb/> Fiscal prudence is assessed through seven questions in the survey, classified in three<lb/> larger modalities as presented in <ref type="table">Table 5</ref> below:<lb/></p>

			<table>Table 5. Fiscal prudence<lb/></table>

			<figure>Fiscal Prudence modalities<lb/> Questions<lb/> Centralisation of revenue collection<lb/> Q6D: Is all revenue collection in infra carried out by the same authority?<lb/> Generalisation of rules<lb/> Q6A: Are all the funds sources subject to the same fiscal discipline?<lb/> Q6B: Are earmarked and off-budget funds allocation rules required to be<lb/> as close as possible to those for budget funds?<lb/> Q6E: Do national procurement laws apply to all infrastructure funds?<lb/> Controls and monitoring<lb/> Q6C: Is infrastructure spending subject to control to avoid quasi-fiscal<lb/> deficit? 22<lb/> Q6F: Is infrastructure spending subject to audit?<lb/> Q6G: Is infrastructure spending subject to ex-post reporting?<lb/> The centralisation of revenue collection is dominant in the African countries of the survey<lb/> with 15 countries out of 22 having all revenue collection carried out by the same authority. It is a<lb/> first step towards ensuring fiscal prudence as in one snapshot, the authority in charge knows<lb/> what the total available resources are.<lb/> 22. Central bank imbalances between costs and revenues create deficits often not reflected in the budget.<lb/> OECD Development Centre Working Paper No.323<lb/> DEV/DOC(2014)2<lb/> 29<lb/></figure>

			<p>The second modality of fiscal prudence is the application of the same laws and fiscal<lb/> discipline to all sources of funding. Here again, African countries apply fiscal prudence rules<lb/> widely. Only three countries do not impose the same fiscal discipline on all the fund sources and<lb/> only seven countries out of 22 do not require allocation rules for earmarked and off-budget funds<lb/> as close as possible to those for budget funds. Finally, 18 countries out of 22 apply national<lb/> procurement laws to all infrastructure funds.<lb/></p>

			<p>The last modality of fiscal prudence concerns the controls imposed on infrastructure<lb/> spending. Also on this modality African countries globally report good practices. Indeed,<lb/> infrastructure spending is subject to control to avoid quasi-fiscal deficit in 14 countries out of 22,<lb/> to audit in 19 countries and to ex post reporting in 18 countries.<lb/> Globally in Africa, the rules of fiscal prudence are well established but they could be<lb/> improved in four countries: Chad, the Democratic Republic of Congo and São Tomé and Príncipe<lb/> report only three modalities out of the seven considered and Kenya has none of them. The best<lb/> practices are found in Djibouti, Gambia, Madagascar, Mauritius, Niger and Sudan with the seven<lb/> modalities encountered and in Zimbabwe with six modalities.<lb/></p>

			<head>V.3. Is public financing of infrastructure efficient in Africa?<lb/></head>

			<p>The notion of efficiency in the use of public funds for infrastructure financing compares<lb/> the results of the spending to the initial resources mobilised for the said infrastructure.<lb/></p>

			<p>The role of the government here is therefore to first provide adequate resources to achieve<lb/> the infrastructure targets and to design the projects properly so as to ensure their efficiency.<lb/> During the different phases of the project, the role of the government is also to gather<lb/> information on whether and how the funds are actually used. This monitoring exercise is<lb/> needed in order to adapt the subsequent spending to the resources still available and to ensure<lb/> delivery of the highest priority items.<lb/> Globally, governments of African countries are efficient in the use of public funds for<lb/> infrastructure spending even if the funds spent for infrastructure are close to those collected in<lb/> only five countries (question Q7I). This specific result confirms the alarming situation regarding<lb/> the match between available resources and the definition of objectives in the planning stage<lb/> illustrated in question Q5E: infrastructure projects are designed to match the available funds at<lb/> the planning stage only in 10 out of 22.<lb/></p>

			<p>Other aspects of efficiency are however present in half or more of the surveyed countries.<lb/> For instance, the monitoring of expenditures, information on available resources and the<lb/> adaptation of the remaining resources to the core objectives are well established. It is relatively<lb/> easy to track expenditures by category to identify cost overruns and/or issues in delivery for 16<lb/> countries out of 22 (question Q7H). Half of the surveyed countries use accrual-based information<lb/> to report investments expenditures (question Q7J). This method helps to improve effectiveness<lb/> as it allows considering money as an expense even if it is not actually paid. Consequently, it<lb/> prevents over-spending when using money not already paid but intended for another expense.<lb/></p>

			<figure>DEV/DOC(2014)2<lb/> 30<lb/> © OECD/CABRI 2014<lb/> In 18 countries, even when funds are insufficient for the project, the highest priority items are<lb/> included so as to meet the main objectives with the available resource (question Q7G).<lb/></figure>

			<p>Seventeen countries integrate all public funds in infrastructure in the public finance system<lb/> (question Q7C).

			<p>Gambia, Madagascar, Rwanda and Tunisia perform the best whereas Kenya has the worst<lb/> measures here again.<lb/></p>

			<p>The survey also asked directly what the major sources of inefficiency were in the use of<lb/> public funds for infrastructure spending (Q7K, see <ref type="table">Table 6</ref>). Inattention to maintenance and the<lb/> issue of hidden costs 23 were quite equally reported by respectively 17 and 16 countries. Failure to<lb/> spend budgeted funds is quoted by 11 countries. Nine countries quote the three sources as major,<lb/> while Sudan 24 and Tunisia do not report any of the three.<lb/></p>

			<p>The issue of maintenance is long lasting and common to all infrastructure sectors in<lb/> Africa. The legacy of underfunding maintenance is resulting in the need for rehabilitation of<lb/> about 30% of a typical African country&apos;s infrastructure assets (<ref type="biblio">World Bank, 2010</ref>). Although<lb/> identified for a while, the issue of proper maintenance is crowded-out by a capital bias that<lb/> favours new and visible investments.<lb/></p>

			<p>The issue of hidden costs requires improvements in different stages of the infrastructure<lb/> plan. Under-pricing should be avoided thanks to more attention in the planning and design<lb/> phases of the project, while under-collection and excessive technical losses relate to the execution<lb/> stage of the project.<lb/> 23. Hidden costs stand for: i) under-pricing where charging is below economic costs of the goods;<lb/> ii) under-collection where bills are never sent or allowed to go unpaid; iii) excessive technical<lb/> losses such as leaks, thefts).<lb/> 24. In Sudan, the main issue is an insufficient availability of resources inherited from the post-conflict<lb/> situation.<lb/></p>

			<table>OECD Development Centre Working Paper No.323<lb/> DEV/DOC(2014)2<lb/> © OECD/CABRI 2014<lb/> 31<lb/> VI. CONCLUSION<lb/></table>

			<figure>Public financing of infrastructure accounts for two thirds of the total amount of<lb/> infrastructure spending in Africa. Given the crucial role of infrastructure for economic<lb/> development, growth and poverty reduction, the report used a qualitative survey implemented<lb/> in 22 African countries to ask whether or not budgetary processes and institutions in Africa are<lb/> hampering infrastructural development.<lb/> The key findings of the report are the following:<lb/> 1. The selection of projects could be improved. In particular the process of appraisal<lb/> needs a more extensive use of Cost-Benefit and/or Cost-Effectiveness Analyses; the<lb/> selection of projects is not sufficiently based on the improvements of physical<lb/> indicators; civil society is generally not consulted.<lb/></figure>

			<p>As highlighted in numerous reports and papers, the selection phase of an infrastructure<lb/> project is crucial to ensure its viability. The selection of a project should ideally rely on a rigorous<lb/> and careful appraisal of the investment that compares its specific attributes between costs and<lb/> benefits. In the same vein, the selection should be based on objective measurements and<lb/> objectives. The selection should also integrate a consultation of all the economic and social actors<lb/> of the society in order to ensure the desirability of a project.<lb/></p>

			<p>These particular points still need to be improved in Africa according to the survey. Fewer<lb/> than half of the countries surveyed report using Cost-Benefit Analysis and/or Cost-Effectiveness<lb/> Analysis in their selection and design process of infrastructure projects. Only 50% of the<lb/> surveyed countries select their infrastructure projects with a view to obtaining the maximum<lb/> improvement in any physical indicator per dollar spent. Finally, the same low proportion of<lb/> countries has an extensive consultation with civil society and the private sector to exchange<lb/> about infrastructure policies.<lb/></p>

			<figure>2. Highest priority projects are implemented first and the different plan levels<lb/> (national, sectorial, local) generally overlap even though local objectives are given<lb/> less priority.<lb/></figure>

			<p>The concept of prioritisation is widely understood as the great majority of the surveyed<lb/> countries report implementing the highest priority projects first. Concerning prioritisation<lb/> between different plan levels (national, sectorial, regional), the results show that there is no deep<lb/> opposition between regional/sectorial priorities and national plans, and that they generally<lb/> overlap. Yet the survey yet shows that local priorities are lagging behind, possibly due to a lack<lb/> of resources at the decentralised level.<lb/></p>

			<head>Public financial management in infrastructure in Africa<lb/></head>

			<figure>DEV/DOC(2014)2<lb/> 32<lb/> © OECD/CABRI 2014<lb/> 3. The sources of finance infrastructure are various and numerous, but public funds<lb/> represent the bulk of it. The growing trend in the amounts spent over the last ten<lb/> years is consistent with the overall positive functioning of this mode of financing.<lb/> The main challenge is now to circumvent the capital bias that tends to favour new<lb/> investments over operation and maintenance expenditures.<lb/></figure>

			<p>Public funds are mostly from general and central funds and transit through budget<lb/> institutions. They mainly finance new investments in the survey. This illustrates the typical<lb/> capital bias issue that tends to disfavour operation and maintenance expenditures against more<lb/> &quot; visible &quot; investments.<lb/> Public sector financing in Africa is globally described as positively functioning, with a<lb/> general increasing trend in the amounts spent over the last ten years. Nonetheless, there is a clear<lb/> willingness to achieve even more efficient and effective financing of infrastructure through on-<lb/>going and/or foreseen reforms.<lb/></p>

			<head>4. Regarding how African governments</head>

			<figure>use public funds for infrastructure financing,<lb/> the survey underlines the fact that their action is overall effective, efficient and<lb/> subject to the rules of fiscal prudence.<lb/></figure>

			<p>The majority of the countries surveyed show a close link between the initial infrastructure<lb/> projects&apos; objectives and the actual realisations, thanks to statements of credible and quantifiable<lb/> targets and the monitoring of their achievement in national infrastructure policy.<lb/> Effectiveness in infrastructure spending in Africa stems from three modalities according<lb/> to the survey. First, the formulation of infrastructure policy in terms of specific targets against<lb/> which achievements in the use of funds can be measured. Second, the monitoring of targets<lb/> achievements. Third, the implementation of highest priority projects.<lb/> Efficiency in infrastructure spending in Africa is related to the monitoring of<lb/> expenditures, the control of information on available resources and the adaptation of the<lb/> remaining resources to the core objectives<lb/> Finally, fiscal prudence rules are found in the centralisation of revenue collection by the<lb/> same authority, the application of the same fiscal rules to all the sources of funds and the use of<lb/> controls and audits.<lb/></p>

			<head>5. Despite</head>

			<figure>the general optimistic situation described above, some specific aspects<lb/> deserve more attention in order to achieve greater value for money in<lb/> infrastructure spending. In the planning stage, a careful use of economic, financial,<lb/> social and environmental appraisal would ensure the feasibility and the<lb/> desirability of the projects. Inefficiencies related to the inadequate attention to<lb/> maintenance require a change in political objectives for infrastructure spending at<lb/> the planning and budgeting phases.<lb/></figure>

			<head>33<lb/></head>

			<p>As already emphasised, the selection and design stages of infrastructure projects deserve<lb/> more attention so as to balance properly targets and resources. These stages are moreover<lb/> essential in order to provide better estimates that will prevent under-pricing. In particular,<lb/> developing the use of Cost-Benefit Analysis and/or Cost-Effectiveness Analysis is a crucial need.<lb/> As inattention to maintenance is described as the major source of inefficiency in<lb/> infrastructure spending, a greater emphasis on this specific expenditure is needed to circumvent<lb/> the capital bias hampering all infrastructure sectors in Africa.<lb/></p>

			<p>The other major source of inefficiency is related to hidden cost issues and requires<lb/> stronger capacities in the collection process and in controlling the execution/construction stages.<lb/> 37<lb/></p>

			<head>Objectives of the questionnaire<lb/></head>

			<p>The aim of this OECD Development Centre-CABRI questionnaire is to have a better understanding of the<lb/> role of budgetary institutions in infrastructure in Africa. The results will: i) be shared at the</p>

			<table>OECD<lb/> Development Centre-Development Finance Network (DeFiNe) Global Forum on Development, taking<lb/> place in Paris in 2011; ii) be shared at an interactive seminar during CABRI meetings in 2012; and iii) lead<lb/> to a joint OECD Development Centre-CABRI publication. The survey is sent for completion to members<lb/> of the OECD Development Centre Governing Board (Cabo Verde, Egypt, Mauritius, Morocco, Senegal,<lb/> South Africa) and CABRI established partners on infrastructure (Rwanda, Mozambique).<lb/> This work comes under the broader OECD Development Centre framework on the cross-regional analysis<lb/> of public policies related to infrastructure and the interactions among major actors in the infrastructure<lb/> policy-making process (PMP). It also extends the 2008 OECD/CABRI Budgetary Practices and Procedures<lb/> Survey in African countries and the on-going work of CABRI on capacity building in Private-Public<lb/> Partnership (PPP) units at Finance ministries in Africa.<lb/> Problem statement<lb/> CABRI, OECD, IMF and World Bank&apos;s work on budgetary practices and procedures across different<lb/> regions in the world have highlighted their complex and heterogeneous role in fiscal consolidation. This<lb/> work aims at extending that analytical framework by focusing on how institutions shape the infrastructure<lb/> cycle&apos;s policy making process which is characterised by timelines that exceed both budgetary and political<lb/> cycles.<lb/> OECD Development Centre Working Paper No.323<lb/> DEV/DOC(2014)2<lb/> © OECD/CABRI 2014<lb/> 39<lb/> Budgetary institutions are often characterised by their degree of flexibility, transparency, centralisation,<lb/> legislative participation, and use of performance information and sustainability.

This appendix summarises their specificities.<lb/></table>

			<head>DRC<lb/></head>

			<p>Regarding the functioning of the system as a whole, DRC performs relatively bad as<lb/> opposed to the other countries in the survey. Focusing on the role of governments in the use of<lb/> public funds, public spending in infrastructure in DRC seems not neither effective nor efficient:<lb/> the data report only 2 positive indicators for section 5 in the survey and none for section 7. A<lb/> similar alarming situation appears for fiscal prudence with only 3 positive indicators.<lb/></p>

			<p>Other specificities for this country concern particular characteristic related to:<lb/> • the absence or presence of reforms to circumvent respectively under-spending and<lb/> the improvement of off-budgets&apos; functioning,<lb/> • the negative functioning of specialised institutions, associated with a decreasing<lb/> trend in the amounts spent through these institutions.<lb/></p>

			<head>Kenya<lb/></head>

			<p>The situation of Kenya regarding how governments use of public funds to finance<lb/> infrastructure is even worse than the DRC&apos;s results. Whether it concerns effectiveness, efficiency<lb/> or the use of fiscal prudence, the country does not report any positive indicator.<lb/></p>

			<p>Here again, the country appears also as an exception on specific points of the survey:<lb/> • There seems to be neither under nor over-spending<lb/> • The functioning of budget institutions is considered as negative, and associated with<lb/> a decreasing trend in the amounts spent through this source of financing.<lb/></p>

			<p>• The absence of reforms to improve the negative functioning of specialised institutions</p>
