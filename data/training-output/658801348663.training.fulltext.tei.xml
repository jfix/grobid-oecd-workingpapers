			<figure>La réforme récente du Pacte de stabilité et de croissance fournit davantage de marges aux gouvernements<lb/> des pays de l&apos;UE pour dépasser la limite de 3 % du déficit public si cela facilite la mise en oeuvre de réformes<lb/> initialement coûteuses. L&apos;application de ce principe n&apos;est cependant pas évidente car les budgets devraient<lb/> indiquer le profil des coûts et bénéfices budgétaires attendus de ces réformes, non seulement dans l&apos;immédiat<lb/> mais aussi dans une perspective pluriannuelle. Les budgets devraient aussi être explicites sur le coût budgétaire<lb/> de l&apos;inaction pour permettre une évaluation équilibrée des dilemmes auxquels doivent faire face les pays en<lb/> fonction des diverses options disponibles. Cet article fournit d&apos;abord une évaluation des besoins d&apos;information<lb/> pour mettre en oeuvre les nouveaux éléments de flexibilité inclus dans le Pacte de stabilité et de croissance. Il<lb/> présente ensuite des exercices de simulation afin d&apos;illustrer les effets budgétaires positifs de réformes<lb/> structurelles coordonnées dans la zone euro ainsi que la nécessité d&apos;une réponse de politique monétaire adéquate<lb/> afin d&apos;assurer que la demande s&apos;ajuste rapidement à l&apos;amélioration des conditions d&apos;offre. Les gains budgétaires<lb/> seraient alors variables selon le type de réformes réalisées et leur impact sur l&apos;emploi et la productivité. D&apos;un<lb/> autre côté, des réformes menées dans un pays isolé pourraient n&apos;avoir qu&apos;un effet limité, notamment à court<lb/> terme dans le cas d&apos;un grand pays. En effet, dans l&apos;union monétaire, la force des mécanismes d&apos;ajustement<lb/> endogènes semble plus faible dans les grands pays. Enfin, l&apos;expérience de la Nouvelle Zélande et de l&apos;Australie<lb/> montre que les bénéfices à long terme des réformes sont importants à la fois sur le plan budgétaire et pour les<lb/> performances économiques d&apos;ensemble, même s&apos;il n&apos;est pas aisé de distinguer l&apos;influence des différentes forces<lb/> en jeu.

			<p>Introduction<lb/> 1.<lb/> We take it for granted that fiscal discipline is important because: large deficits and rising debt<lb/> undermine the long-run sustainability of fiscal policy, excessive deficits will be a burden on future<lb/> generations, fiscal policy volatility can undermine growth and a pro-cyclical policy can destabilise the<lb/> economy (<ref type="biblio">Fatás, 2005</ref>). Fiscal rules are one way to cope with such fiscal policy biases, even though they<lb/> need to be underpinned by institutional settings so that they can be enforced at the national, and in the case<lb/> of the euro area, at the Community level.<lb/> 2.<lb/> These concerns were not at the root of the EU fiscal framework. It was designed to address<lb/> another key concern, namely that once exchange rates within the single currency area ceased to exist,<lb/> financial markets would no longer discipline fiscal policy. Fiscal profligacy in one country could affect<lb/> area-wide interest rates and crowd out economic activity in other countries. Even though interest rate<lb/> differentials across the euro area countries have narrowed despite a divergent fiscal performance, there is<lb/> little evidence of spill-over effects. The main reason probably is that there is little to crowd out due to<lb/> persistent economic slack in the large euro area countries.<lb/></p>

			<p>3.<lb/> This may be one reason why the arguments in favour of rules-based fiscal co-ordination have<lb/> shifted towards long-term issues, as they should, especially because ageing-related concerns oblige<lb/> governments to recognise the implications of current budget decisions for public finances in the future.<lb/> Also, greater attention has progressively shifted to the incentives built into budgetary institutions that<lb/> produce fiscal biases (higher deficits, expenditure and taxes). Even though these institutions have improved<lb/> to some extent, they are still lagging best practice in many euro area countries.<lb/> 4.<lb/> At the same time, calls to make the Pact more flexible have mushroomed. Some were motivated<lb/> by new member countries&apos; need to boost infrastructure outlays, against the backdrop of relatively low<lb/> public debt levels. Some observers have argued in favour of the &quot; golden rule &quot; , along the lines of the one<lb/> introduced in 1997 in the United Kingdom</p>

			<p>5.<lb/> Another rationale for a rewrite of the rules is that structural reform is expected to yield long-term<lb/> economic gains but often entail up-front costs that may dissuade governments from implementing<lb/> structural reforms. The expected gains of structural reforms are usually uncertain, long-term and spread out<lb/> across the economy whereas any political and budgetary costs, such as compensation schemes to offset<lb/> redistributive effects, are more tangible, are felt immediately and are more concentrated. Moreover, some<lb/> reforms will involve J-curve effects; a cut in taxation will reduce budget receipts immediately while effects<lb/> on incentives to work, save and invest may take some time before they materialise. This asymmetry could<lb/> discourage reforms, especially in a monetary union, where they cannot be supported via an easing of<lb/> monetary policy. Similarly, a move towards privately-funded pension schemes typically leads to deficits in<lb/> the public scheme but initial surpluses in the private schemes as contributors transfer to them.<lb/> 6.<lb/> According to the fiscal rules a waiver can be granted under the excessive deficit procedure to<lb/> countries on the basis of &quot; exceptional circumstances &quot; (EC, 2005a and EC, <ref type="biblio">2006</ref>). While the Treaty had<lb/> already stipulated that &quot; other relevant factors &quot; should be part of the &quot; exceptional circumstances &quot; , these<lb/> were not specified. The revamped Pact decided by the European Council in March 2005 specifies them and<lb/> the conditions under which they are taken into account. These include efforts to pursue the Lisbon agenda,<lb/> to foster R&amp;D or &quot; a high level of financial contributions &quot; to underpin the &quot; unification of Europe &quot; and<lb/> &quot; international solidarity &quot; (development aid). Consideration would also be given to pension reforms.<lb/> Concerning the Lisbon agenda, the new Council Regulation observes: &quot; In order to enhance the<lb/> growth-oriented nature of the Pact, major structural reforms which have direct long-term cost-saving<lb/> effects, including through raising potential growth, and therefore a verifiable impact on the long-term<lb/> sustainability of public finances, should be taken into account when defining the adjustment path to the<lb/> medium-term budgetary objective for countries that have not yet reached this objective and in allowing a<lb/> temporary deviation from this objective for countries that have already reached it &quot; (EC, 2005b). All these<lb/> provisions, however, only apply if &quot; an excess over the reference value is temporary &quot; and if the deficit ratio<lb/> &quot; remains close to the reference value &quot; , as stipulated in the Treaty. In its assessment of the most recent<lb/> batch of stability programmes the Commission (<ref type="biblio">EC, 2006</ref>) noted that no structural reforms were taken into<lb/> account in setting adjustment path towards the medium-term fiscal objectives because of the lack of<lb/> information provided in the programmes on the content of reforms and their budgetary implications.<lb/> Moreover, there were virtually no cases of structural reforms being discussed.<lb/> 7.<lb/> Against this backdrop we will address the following three questions:<lb/> • Do governments actually know the size of the upfront cost of structural reform or do they at least<lb/> make any efforts to estimate them? This is an important question, because without such estimates<lb/> it is hard to see what could eventually underpin a waiver. Unfortunately the answer is a qualified<lb/> no, as will become clear in the first section of this paper.<lb/> • What can the economics profession contribute to estimating the long-run gain of structural<lb/> reform? The usual instrument is to look at macroeconomic feedback mechanisms and to simulate<lb/> various scenarios with an economic model to study the fiscal implications of reforms that affect<lb/> technical progress, the participation rate or the natural rate of unemployment in different settings.<lb/> This is what we will do in the second section.<lb/> • What do historical examples of deep structural reform say about the interplay between structural<lb/> reform and public finances? The answer from New Zealand and Australia is that their structural<lb/> reform programmes were followed by a very strong improvement in their fiscal positions.<lb/></p>

			<head>Costing the impact of reforms on the budget<lb/> The UK budget: a role model?<lb/></head>

			<p>8.<lb/> Assessing the budgetary implications of structural reforms in the short, medium and long run is<lb/> shrouded with many difficulties. In many cases, governments do provide a costing of changes in tax and<lb/> spending plans and often also beyond the current budget. 2 Obviously, changes in tax and spending plans<lb/> are pursued for many other purposes than purely fiscal ones. UK <ref type="biblio">Budgets (HMT, 2001, 2002, 2003 and<lb/> 2004</ref>), for instance, provide an assessment of Budget policy decisions over a three-year horizon under the<lb/> following headings: meeting the fiscal rules and funding public services; meeting the productivity<lb/> challenge; increasing employment opportunity for all; building a fairer society; a modern and fair tax<lb/> system; and protecting the environment.<lb/></p>

			<head>9.<lb/> Budget 2002</head>

			<p>, for instance, lists 54 spending and tax measures and estimates their budgetary<lb/> effect. The budgetary impact of 16 measures implemented since Budget 2001 are estimated as well. The<lb/> biggest measure was a payroll tax increase and the second biggest an increase in the generosity of the<lb/> Child Tax Credit and Working Tax Credit for families with children. All other measures were small,<lb/> ranging from beer duty relief for small brewers to simplifying capital gains tax. While the list of measures<lb/> is long, only those are included where the impact of the decisions and circumstances can be quantified with<lb/> reasonable accuracy. Moreover, spending that is fixed by the spending reviews and embedded in<lb/> Departmental Expenditure Limits is not included in the Budget costing of decisions. In 2002, the net fiscal<lb/> impact of the identified spending and revenue measures was nearly 1% of GDP, but considerably lower in<lb/> most other Budgets (<ref type="table">Table 1</ref>). In comparison, the forecasting error for the deficit was equivalent to 1% of<lb/> GDP for the year-ahead projection in recent years and nearly 1½ per cent of GDP for the two-year ahead<lb/> projection. There is no strong hint in the Budget costings that reforms have generated large budgetary costs<lb/> in the short term. However, this is so mainly, because the spending underpinning the ongoing reforms to<lb/> health, education and infrastructure are built into (hence respect) the Departmental Spending Limits.<lb/></p>

			<p>10.<lb/> What this spending has achieved is open to debate, as the new metrics to measure government<lb/> outputs, following the Atkinson Review, are not yet fully in place. Assessments of feedbacks of tax and<lb/> spending changes on economic activity are even rarer. HMT&apos;s effects of budget measures, for instance, do<lb/> not include effects on overall levels of income and spending. This is not surprising, because there is often<lb/> no consensus on effects. Depending on the underlying model and empirics, a rise in payroll taxes can have<lb/> a negative short, medium or long-term impact on structural unemployment, or none at all. Effects of R&amp;D<lb/> tax credits or grants on R&amp;D spending and ultimately growth are notoriously difficult to quantify. Or the<lb/> effect of savings incentives on substitution between different savings vehicles versus aggregate savings is<lb/> usually impossible to pin down. And sometimes, long lags imply that any discernible effects of reforms<lb/> would only show up after many years. Still, in the United States, attempts are underway to include<lb/> feedback effects in assessing tax and spending proposals (Box 1).<lb/></p>

			<head>Box 1. Dynamic scoring<lb/></head>

			<p>In the United States, legislative proposals are scrutinised by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) and the<lb/> Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT). They provide a baseline and forecasts of the changes in expenditure and<lb/> revenues that would result from proposed legislation over the following ten years.<lb/> 1 The forecasts provide a cost<lb/> estimate or &quot; score &quot; , for each piece of legislation that is reported by a Congressional committee (<ref type="biblio">Page, 2005</ref>). In the<lb/> past, the scoring was static, not taking into account macroeconomic feedback effects. Dynamic scoring, which is still in<lb/> its infancy, takes into account induced changes on output, inflation, interest rates or other macroeconomic feedbacks.<lb/> The scoring is important as it influences how favourably initiatives are viewed in Congress and the Senate. A tax cut,<lb/> for instance, could raise output significantly, with a large cut in tax rates having little implication for net government<lb/> revenues. If this feedback is not included, the tax cut will be viewed less favourably by Congress, which is usually<lb/> constrained to keep the total revenue cost of a tax package within pre-set targets (<ref type="biblio">Altshuler et al., 2005</ref>)<lb/></p>

			<p>The outcome of dynamic scoring depends on the models used and on assumptions about macroeconomic policy<lb/> reactions. In assessing the 2004 budget, forward-looking, life-cycle growth models and more traditional<lb/> macroeconomic forecasting models were used. For the latter, various monetary policy reactions to the fiscal stimulus<lb/> were simulated, while the growth models differ in various respects. Given different models and assumptions, the<lb/> outcomes differed widely. Concerning the JCT&apos;s analysis, incorporating dynamic effects reduced the net revenue cost<lb/> of one proposal by 6 to 28% over the first five years and 3 to 23% over the second five years. <ref type="biblio">Auerbach (2005)<lb/></ref> concludes from these first attempts, that &quot; … it seems clear that dynamic scoring analysis has value, but also that<lb/> adjustments to estimates are smaller than some might have expected. The process to date offers some support to<lb/> those on both sides of the debate. On the one hand, the ability of CBO and JCT to produce dynamic analyses of<lb/> complex, realistic proposals lends credence to the argument that dynamic analysis and, indeed, dynamic scoring may<lb/> be feasible. On the other hand, the many models used and the many assumptions needed leave many with doubts<lb/> about the quality of these estimates and how they would fit into the budget scoring process as currently structured. &quot;<lb/> 1. On the expenditure side, the CBO provides the baseline and the scoring, on the revenue side the CBO provides<lb/> the baseline and the JCT the scoring.<lb/></p>

			<head>Quantifying the cost of inaction<lb/> <ref type="table">11.<lb/></ref> One could argue that, before allowing more leeway under the fiscal rules, unproductive spending<lb/> should be pruned first, which would probably leave enough room to spend on priority areas, without<lb/> running up against the deficit limit. Similar issues relate to reforms, or the lack thereof, of budgetary<lb/> frameworks, which are far from being best practice in many EU countries (<ref type="biblio">Joumard et al., 2004</ref>). The<lb/> design of reforms themselves may also be problematic: perhaps the scope for more cost-effective<lb/> approaches is not being exploited. There are many examples of government spending programmes that<lb/> tend to undermine growth, come at a high budgetary cost, sometimes grow considerably faster than GDP<lb/> and are difficult to reform. They crowd out more productive government spending programmes. As such<lb/> programmes tend to push countries towards the Maastricht deficit limit, the question arises whether policy<lb/> inaction in such areas should not be taken into account, when granting greater flexibility on spending in<lb/> priority areas.<lb/> 12.<lb/> The potential sources of fiscal stress built into government programmes are multiple. Fiscal<lb/> pressures may mount because of biased incentives of government programmes, for example in the case of<lb/> early retirement and disability schemes. The implicit tax on continued work, which gauges incentives to<lb/> quit work before the retirement age, is very high in many European countries (<ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>). There have been<lb/> reforms, but most were minor, though Italy lowered the implicit tax a lot between 1998 and 2003. Early<lb/> retirement lowers labour utilisation and has fiscal costs that can amount to several per cent of GDP.<lb/> Similarly, the number of disability benefit recipients varies considerably across countries and only a few<lb/> countries were successful in reducing the number of beneficiaries (<ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>). In fact, in many countries, the<lb/> number of beneficiaries keeps on rising rapidly.<lb/></p>

			<p>13.<lb/> There are also cases, were reform efforts have been considerable, but reform outcomes tend to<lb/> fall short of expectations. Majnoni d&apos;<ref type="biblio">Intignano (2001)</ref>, for instance, argues that health reforms in France<lb/> are recurrent, actually close to one every year between 1975 and 2000, but have barely dented spending<lb/> growth, or have slowed growth in one year, but with a catch-up towards the underlying spending trend the<lb/> next. The costing of changes in government programmes is not too difficult for programmes that are<lb/> relatively simple and where at least some changes in policy parameters influence private decision making<lb/> in a straightforward way: the implications of pension reforms, for instance, have been well researched by<lb/> the Commission or the OECD. More complex issues, like the effects of health care reforms are much more<lb/> difficult to quantify. There are many actors and incentive effects are difficult to model.<lb/> 14.<lb/> The cost of inaction can be illustrated by resorting to the now fashionable distinction between the<lb/> Nordic, Anglo-Saxon, continental and Mediterranean social models. <ref type="biblio">Boeri (2002)</ref>, for instance, compares<lb/> their performance in terms of meeting three objectives: reductions in income inequality and poverty;<lb/> protection against uninsurable labour market risk; and the reward to labour market participation. And<lb/> indeed, geography and economic characteristic tend to coincide, though the match is not perfect. <ref type="biblio">Sapir<lb/> (2005)</ref> uses the same typology, but focuses on efficiency and equity aspects: Efficiency is measured by a<lb/> high employment rate and equity by a low poverty rate.<lb/> 15.<lb/> <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref> shows that all Nordic and Anglo-Saxon countries are above average in terms of<lb/> employment, whereas most continental countries (except Austria and the Netherlands) and Mediterranean<lb/> countries (except Portugal) rank below average. On the other hand, poverty is relatively high in the<lb/> Mediterranean and Anglo-Saxon countries and relatively low in the continental and Nordic countries. <ref type="biblio">Sapir<lb/> (2005)</ref> has analysed the reasons for these differences. What is important in the context of this paper is the<lb/> fiscal sustainability of social models. Net public debt as a per cent of GDP is much lower in the &quot; efficient &quot;<lb/> countries and much higher in the continental and Mediterranean countries (<ref type="table">Table 2</ref>). Moreover, debt does<lb/> not tend to come down much in the high-debt countries (except Belgium), while it has stayed low or even<lb/> come down further in most better-performing countries.<lb/></p>

			<p>16.<lb/> A similar pattern emerges when looking at growth performance and fiscal policy (<ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>). In<lb/> the period 1999-2005, trend growth was only 1½ per cent per year on average in the three major euro area<lb/> countries, but 3¼ per cent in the smaller countries. Faster growth coincides with a strong fiscal<lb/> performance, while the contrary tends to be true for the slower-growing countries. Econometric work<lb/> provides evidence that fiscal consolidations are more likely to be undertaken and successful if trend<lb/> economic growth is high (von <ref type="biblio">Hagen et al., 2002</ref>). At the same time, the smaller fast growing-economies<lb/> were able to maintain fairly rapid growth in public spending while keeping their government deficits in<lb/> check. Greece is of course an important exception with soaring spending and a whopping government<lb/> deficit despite strong growth.<lb/></p>

The OECD has developed a broad range of indicators concerning the<lb/> stringency of labour and product market regulations. 3 The OECD has also produced a lot of empirical work<lb/> that traces the effects of the regulatory stance on employment and unemployment rates, R&amp;D intensity and<lb/> ultimately growth. This work has culminated in the OECD&apos;s Growth Project (OECD, 2001) and feeds into<lb/> the ongoing structural surveillance work (OECD, 2005). Substantial methodological progress has been<lb/> achieved in constructing structural policy indicators with an econometric link to economic performance.<lb/> 18.<lb/> Such inventories are potentially very useful, but there are also limitations, when assessing the<lb/> budgetary implications of structural reforms:<lb/></figure>

			<p>• These inventories leave out a wide variety of regulations, such as health and safety or<lb/> environmental regulations, which could have a budgetary impact.<lb/></p>

			<p>• There is in general no direct link between these inventories and budgetary effects and it would<lb/> seem difficult to establish the link between reforms and side-payments to get reforms underway.<lb/> 19.<lb/> Moreover, while the body of empirical work on growth is enormous, there are still considerable<lb/> disagreements about what reforms can achieve in the short and long term. In particular, the short-term<lb/> adjustment costs associated with reforms are under-researched. Moreover, results are data-quality, model<lb/> and estimator dependent. While cross-country growth regressions have been an extremely popular means<lb/> of testing ideas about the sources of growth, many of the variables claimed to be significant have not<lb/> passed tests of statistical robustness (<ref type="biblio">Ahn and Hemmings, 2000</ref>). Another problem is the lack of accepted<lb/> formal theoretical models that can accommodate the wide range of variables that are often included as<lb/> explanatory variables, despite advances in the theory of economic growth. A related issue is that causal<lb/> links between aggregate economic variables and growth are bi-directional, hence most estimates are likely<lb/> to suffer from endogeneity problems.<lb/></p>

			<figure>3.<lb/> The World Bank has also developed inventories of policy measures. Another example is the indicators<lb/> developed by the Fondazione Rodolfo Debenedetti.<lb/> Structural reform, feedback mechanisms and fiscal performance: what can a macro-model tell?<lb/></figure>

			<p>20.<lb/> Even if reforms have measurable direct beneficial effects on primary spending, their overall<lb/> effect on the fiscal position depends on economic feedback mechanisms and will vary across countries. To<lb/> quantify the impact of these mechanisms, several simulations were run with the OECD&apos;s Interlink model.<lb/> They show how the macroeconomic effects of structural reform can vary across different situations, and in<lb/> particular they illustrate the difference between concerted reform efforts versus reforms in a single country.<lb/></p>

			<head>Effects of coordinated reform in monetary union<lb/></head>

			<p>21.<lb/> Simulations have been run to quantify the benefits from co-ordinating structural reform with<lb/> monetary policy in the case of the euro area. To set a benchmark, we first construct scenarios in which co-<lb/>ordination with monetary policy is absent. Three scenarios are run: first, total factor productivity is raised;<lb/> second, labour force participation increases; and third, structural unemployment is reduced. These changes<lb/> affect the large euro area countries and thus the overall performance of the euro area, for which the level of<lb/> potential output increases by 1¼ per cent over eight years. The reforms all imply lower inflation and are<lb/> accompanied by lower interest rates in a way that keeps real interest rates unchanged. Exchange rates are<lb/> assumed fixed, except in one simulation. Finally, tax rates are kept constant and also government<lb/> consumption and investment are held fixed in real terms. The results are represented with respect to a<lb/> baseline scenario which goes to 2012, which is based on the premise that countries converge gradually to<lb/> their potential production level. 4<lb/></p>

			<head>Effects of a rise in trend productivity<lb/></head>

			<p>22.<lb/> The first simulation illustrates the effect of a productivity gain on macroeconomic and budgetary<lb/> performance. As many studies have shown there is considerable potential to raise productivity in the euro<lb/> area, be it by product and labour market reforms or stronger innovative activity (OECD, 2003 and 2004).<lb/> The simulation assumes that the level of trend labour productivity goes up by a cumulated increase of 2%<lb/> over eight years. In the simulation, stronger productivity growth leads to a gradual rise in real wages,<lb/> which is compatible with lower inflation (<ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref>). This raises internal demand and boosts net exports,<lb/> which benefit from improved competitiveness. Total demand rises somewhat faster than potential output<lb/> and the output gap closes more quickly than in the baseline. The budget balance improves in actual and<lb/> structural terms by about 1¼ per cent of GDP at the end of the simulation period. This is mainly due to the<lb/> lower nominal interest rates and to a lesser extent to improved social accounts. The reduction of the deficit<lb/> allows only a small decline in the debt/GDP ratio, because lower inflation lowers nominal GDP growth. 5<lb/> 4.<lb/> Medium-term scenarios that prolong the short-term projections are regularly up-dated by the OECD. They<lb/> are based on the premise that the output gap will close over the scenario&apos;s horizon (<ref type="biblio">by 2012</ref>), while<lb/> unemployment converges to the structural unemployment rate. Commodity prices and exchange rates are<lb/> held fixed in real terms, while the oil price declines from $54 at the end of 2007 to $44 per barrel by 2012.<lb/> Monetary policy aims at price stability, while fiscal policy remains unchanged, with the primary budget<lb/> balance virtually stable between 2007 and 2012 in most countries. Details can be found in the OECD<lb/> Economic Outlook 78 (2005).<lb/> 5.<lb/> The debt profile is determined by the following equations:<lb/></p>

			<p>Debt (t) = primary balance (t) + debt (t-1)*(1+ r(t))/(1+g(t)) with r(t) being the nominal interest rate at t and<lb/> g(t) nominal growth of GDP. With no improvement in the primary budget, lower inflation tends to lower<lb/> the growth of nominal GDP, which offsets the effect of lower interest rates. In this case public debt will<lb/> change little with respect to the baseline. If, however, nominal growth declines more than interest rates, a<lb/> snow-ball effect will raise indebtedness, even if there is no deterioration in the primary budget balance.<lb/></p>

			<head>Effects of a rise in participation<lb/></head>

			<p>23.<lb/> <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref> allows a comparison of these first results with a simulation of an increase in labour force<lb/> participation. Considerable room for increases also exist in this domain, especially by sharpening<lb/> incentives for young and older workers to work and by removing obstacles to participation by females<lb/> (<ref type="biblio">Burniaux et al., 2003</ref>). In this simulation it is assumed that changes in incentives push up trend<lb/> participation by 1 percentage point gradually over eight years. As in the earlier case, domestic demand and<lb/> net exports rise. The rise in participation leads, however, to some rise in unemployment, which leads to<lb/> lower real wages and inflation, which stimulates competitiveness and employment and finally disposable<lb/> income. Demand is, however, initially not rising as fast as supply, so that the output gap is higher for some<lb/> years. The budgetary situation also improves in this simulation, while the debt/GDP ratio remains close to<lb/> the baseline. The improvement of the budgetary situation is likely however to be somewhat<lb/> underestimated. Especially a rise in the participation of older workers would reduce spending on early<lb/> retirement, while unemployment should return to the baseline level over the longer term.<lb/></p>

			<head>Effects of a decline in structural unemployment<lb/></head>

			<p>24.<lb/> Also a decline in structural unemployment would raise the employment rate and potential output.<lb/> This is illustrated by a third simulation which reduces structural unemployment gradually by 1 percentage<lb/> point over the first three years. The increase in potential output is thus concentrated in these years and<lb/> initially the output gap widens by more than in the other simulations. This leads to a larger real wage and<lb/> inflation deceleration than in the other two simulations (<ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref>). This stimulates employment,<lb/> profitability and competitiveness and leads to stronger internal and external demand. The budgetary<lb/> improvement is somewhat stronger than in the preceding cases. This is because of lower unemployment. In<lb/> conjunction with the effect of lower interest rates on the budget, also the debt/GDP ratio declines<lb/> somewhat.<lb/></p>

			<head>25.<lb/></head>

			<p>The simulations show the positive medium-term effects of the reforms on the government budget,<lb/> with the gains being larger in the simulations that show a stronger improvement in the primary budget<lb/> balance. However, the effects on indebtedness are minor, because of the deceleration in inflation induced<lb/> by the reforms. A more accommodating monetary policy would contribute to improve the budgetary results<lb/> further. The central role of monetary policy in accompanying the reforms is shown by simulations that<lb/> again reduce the structural unemployment rate, but now under alternative monetary policy assumptions.<lb/> The first assumes that real interest rates decline as well as the exchange rate, while the other assumes that<lb/> nominal interest rates and exchange rates stay at the baseline level.<lb/> 26.<lb/> The simulation shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref> suggests that an easier monetary policy would stimulate<lb/> demand considerably. It is assumed that real interest rates are about 100 basis points below the baseline<lb/> level on average over the simulation period, while the euro is assumed to decline by 5% in real effective<lb/> terms. 6 The effects on external and internal demand would push the output gap above the baseline level,<lb/> which would limit the deceleration of inflation. The budgetary improvement would be considerably<lb/> stronger, in terms of deficits and of debt developments. Concerning the latter, the impact of the<lb/> improvement in the primary deficit of lower interest rates is not offset by the disinflationary effect and the<lb/> debt/GDP ratio would decline by 10 percentage points with respect to the baseline at the end of the<lb/> simulation period.<lb/> 27.<lb/> If, on the other hand, nominal interest rates and exchange rates are kept at their baseline values,<lb/> the higher real interest rates dampen demand considerably and the output gap remains larger than in the<lb/> baseline scenario throughout the simulation period (<ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref>). With activity weaker and unemployment<lb/> higher, the improvement in the primary deficit is much slower to come, while nominal GDP rises by less<lb/> because of lower inflation. The debt/GDP ratio deteriorates considerably as the snow-ball effect is<lb/> reinforced by lower inflation.<lb/> 6.<lb/> In this simulation the exchange rate is assumed to respond to both inflation and interest rates developments.<lb/> On the one hand, an exchange rate purchasing power parity rule applies in the long term, implying stable<lb/> real effective exchanges rates. On the other hand, the lower real interest rates in the euro area induce a real<lb/> depreciation of the euro exchange rate at least for some time.<lb/></p>

			<head>Structural reform in a single country in monetary union<lb/></head>

			<p>28.<lb/> In the previous set of simulations it was assumed that all countries embark on structural reforms<lb/> simultaneously. However, this may not occur in reality, which raises the issue whether the incentives for<lb/> (or reward of) structural reform is sufficiently strong for individual countries. There may also be a divide<lb/> between small and big countries in this regard, due to the difference in openness of their respective<lb/> economies.<lb/></p>

			<head>Effects of a decline in structural unemployment<lb/></head>

			<p>29.<lb/> The importance of monetary policy in facilitating the adjustment of demand to a rise in supply<lb/> and for improving budget balances leads to questions about the reforms pursued by a single country in the<lb/> euro area. This divide appears clearly when simulating the impact of a gradual decline in the structural<lb/> unemployment rate by 1½ percentage points over three years in a small (Belgium) and a large (France)<lb/> country. They are based on the same assumption as above: the nominal interest rate and the exchange rate<lb/> are fixed at the baseline level. The results show a marked contrast between the two countries.<lb/> 30.<lb/> The small country, because of its much greater openness to trade, benefits much more from the<lb/> competitiveness gains, which allows a more rapid adjustment of demand and limits the deceleration in<lb/> inflation (<ref type="figure">Figure 7</ref>). The effect of the reform is positive for the budget balance, though the effect on<lb/> indebtedness is minor.<lb/> 31.<lb/> In contrast, the adjustment path for the large country is much more drawn-out (<ref type="figure">Figure 8</ref>). The<lb/> impact of higher real interest rates tends to neutralise the competitiveness gains due to lower inflation.<lb/> Overall, the output gap remains below the baseline level over the whole simulation period. The budget<lb/> balance hardly improves, while indebtedness is rising. However, significantly lower inflation in a large<lb/> country will affect area-wide inflation, which could lead to some monetary easing. If the interest rate were<lb/> to decline in line with overall inflation, the budget balance would improve by more.<lb/> 32.<lb/> These simulation results are, of course, model dependent. The weak endogenous adjustment<lb/> forces in the case of reforms of a single large euro area economy could be exaggerated. It can not be<lb/> excluded that a better macroeconomic performance, and especially lower unemployment, would lead to<lb/> substantial confidence effects, which are not included in the model. These could lead to greater dynamism<lb/> of consumption and investment. The reaction of the US economy to the productivity shock during the<lb/> 1990s suggests that demand can outstrip supply, following a supply shock. 7 On the other hand, one should<lb/> not underestimate either the role played by the US monetary authorities, which recognized and<lb/> accompanied the structural changes. Also the depth and flexibility of the American financial markets were<lb/> crucial in allowing a rapid transmission of the associated wealth gains onto demand.<lb/> 7.<lb/> This would follow Say&apos;s law, which suggests that supply will create its demand. But the American<lb/> situation even suggests what Val Koromzay dubbed Super-Say&apos;s law, whereby a more optimistic outlook<lb/> on future income can lead to excess demand, when supply conditions improve.<lb/></p>

			<head>Effects of a decline in structural unemployment with a more active fiscal policy<lb/></head>

			<p>33.<lb/> A final set of simulations is designed to examine the role of upfront cost, and more generally to<lb/> look at the possibility that countries use a more activist fiscal policy to accompany their structural reform<lb/> programme. A rise in potential output due to a decline in structural unemployment improves the structural<lb/> budget balance. In the absence of monetary policy, euro area member countries may be tempted to use the<lb/> room for fiscal manoeuvre to accompany reforms to speed up the adjustment of demand to the improved<lb/> supply conditions. Moreover, the reforms could have a budgetary cost, for instance because they include a<lb/> cut in social security contributions.<lb/> 34.<lb/> To illustrate the joint effect of a decline in structural unemployment and of a more active fiscal<lb/> policy two scenarios were run for France. The first assumes that the structural budget balance is kept at the<lb/> baseline level. The second assumes that the decline in unemployment is accompanied by a permanent<lb/> reduction in employers&apos; social security contributions by ½ per cent of GDP. The results are presented in<lb/> <ref type="figure">Figure 9</ref>. They clearly show the limits of loosening fiscal policy to accompany structural reforms: the<lb/> macroeconomic gains are very limited, but the budget deteriorates significantly.<lb/></p>

			<head>&quot; Big bangs &quot; and gradualism: the experiences of New Zealand and Australia<lb/></head>

			<p>35.<lb/> Some OECD economies have undergone radical transformations with major fiscal implications<lb/> and their recent economic histories are consistent with the findings from the above model-based analysis.<lb/> New Zealand is a prime example. It initiated radical and wide-ranging reforms in the mid-1980s. These<lb/> reforms encompassed both macroeconomic stabilisation and structural change (<ref type="biblio">Evans et al., 1996</ref>). The<lb/> reforms followed a decade of anaemic growth, with even lower rates than those currently observed in the<lb/> euro area, while inflation was rampant and the current account in deep deficit (</p>

			<p>Note: The Nairu is assumed to fall progressively by 1.5 percentage points in the first three years of the simulation.<lb/> Nominal exchange rate kept unchanged relative to baseline. Real interest rates at the euro level are maintained<lb/> unchanged relative to baseline.<lb/> 36.<lb/> Key reforms included financial market deregulation and the granting of operational independence<lb/> to the Reserve Bank; deep labour market reforms, though they were only enacted from the early 1990s<lb/> onwards; and telecommunication and electricity reforms. These reforms did not include any<lb/> side-payments, but there were many reforms affecting the budget directly. Support to manufacturing<lb/> industries and agriculture was withdrawn, which lowered spending, but also lowered revenues due to hefty<lb/> tariff cuts on industrial products. Direct government assistance to industry and agriculture declined from<lb/> 16% of primary government spending to just 4% in 1993/94. At the same time, tax policy put a sharp focus<lb/> on the neutrality of the tax system: a comprehensive value added tax replaced a myriad of sales taxes,<lb/> while the corporate and income tax base was broadened and tax rates reduced. Tax incentives concerning<lb/> exports or retirement savings were abolished. On the spending side, focus was put on organisational and<lb/> managerial devolution and improved accountability, for instance in health and education. Chief executives<lb/> became responsible for managing departments, being directly accountable to their Ministers for hitting<lb/> specific output targets. Moreover, the large number of trading departments was turned into state-owned<lb/> enterprises, many of which were subsequently sold.<lb/> 37.<lb/> Stronger growth did not help fiscal consolidation early in the reform era. Partly reflecting heavy<lb/> industrial and agricultural restructuring and job losses from rapid efficiency gains, GDP barely increased<lb/> between 1984 and 1991 (<ref type="table">Table 3</ref>). Also the exchange rate and real interest rate were high. Early in the<lb/> reforms, consolidation was largely achieved by revenue increases and while some spending items were<lb/> pruned severely, spending on health, education and social services increased as a share of GDP. But<lb/> stronger growth followed and a fiscal surplus was achieved in the 1993/94 financial year. Fiscal<lb/> performance has been strong since then, the government recording a deficit in only one year since 1994<lb/> and a net debt position of more than 50% of GDP has swung into a net asset position. This successful fiscal<lb/> consolidation partly reflects a decent, though not outstanding, growth performance and partly the<lb/> principled approach to fiscal management that was put in place in 1994, based on responsibility and<lb/> transparency. This approach has been taken up in the UK&apos;s code of fiscal conduct and the OECD Best<lb/> Practices for Budget Transparency. Macroeconomic policy was set to provide a stable and sound<lb/> framework for fiscal policy rather than stabilise macroeconomic outcomes with short-term adjustments to<lb/> the fiscal stance.<lb/> 38.<lb/> Reforms in New Zealand since the mid-1980s were broad ranging and quick, in the wake of large<lb/> macroeconomic imbalances. By tackling many areas quickly there was no stable coalition formed to<lb/> oppose reforms: for instance, farmers who had their subsidies withdrawn, 8 strongly supported tariff cuts;<lb/> and farmers and other businesses then put pressure on the government to reduce spending to bring down<lb/> the interest and exchange rate. But moving quickly also led to some backlashes, as the reform process<lb/> stalled between 1988 and 1991, from when onward it resumed again. The experience highlights that fiscal<lb/> consolidation and radical change can go hand in hand, even when the results of reforms on economic<lb/> performance do not come quickly.<lb/> 39.<lb/> In contrast with New Zealand, the Australian reform process was gradual, but it was also<lb/> principled and coherent (<ref type="biblio">Banks, 2005</ref>). As in New Zealand, policy prior to the reforms was characterised<lb/> by being highly regulated, anti-competitive and redistributive, even though the macroeconomic<lb/> background, while not brilliant, was more benign (<ref type="table">Table 4</ref>). Productivity growth of just over 1% between<lb/> 1973 and 1990 was relatively poor and, also affected by terms of trade losses, the international<lb/> income-per-capita ranking slipped badly.</p>

			<table>Though reforms started in 1973 with a 25% across-the-board<lb/> 8.<lb/> The largest farmer association, the Federated Farmers of New Zealand argue that the sudden and<lb/> unexpected removal of subsidies have made the farming sector stronger and that farmers are determined<lb/> never again to be dependent upon government handouts (Federated Farmers of New Zealand, 2002).<lb/> Productivity gains, for instance, moved from 1% pre-reform to nearly 6% post-reform, while the initial<lb/> impact of the reform, while sizeable, was much milder than officially projected.<lb/> tariff cut, this precipitated a heavy backlash against reforms. It was not before 1988 that tariff reductions<lb/> were phased in with virtually all tariffs falling to below 5% by 1996. The early 1980s also saw financial<lb/> market reforms. Increased competition led to pressure to reform labour markets and sheltered sectors. The<lb/> reforms ultimately embraced all product markets, factor markets and the public sector, including as in<lb/> New Zealand the commercialisation, corporatisation and privatisation of many government enterprises.<lb/> Table 4.

			<p>40.<lb/> Contrary to New Zealand, Australia adopted a gradual approach to reforms, thus avoiding heavy<lb/> initial adjustment costs. The programme evolved in a cumulative way to encompass reforms across much<lb/> of the economy. Moreover, and again contrary to New Zealand, reforms were accompanied by retraining<lb/> schemes and displaced workers could rely on the relatively generous welfare safety net. Adjustment costs<lb/> were also eased by sector-specific restructuring and assistance schemes, which amounted to AUD 600<lb/> million annually under the Automotive Competitiveness and Investment Scheme. Similarly, when price<lb/> support for the milk industry was abolished in 2000, farmers were provided with a substantial stream of<lb/> payments, financed by a levy on milk consumers. Also regional policy schemes eased the adjustment blow<lb/> in some cases. Policy has thus dealt with the front-loaded timing of the potential losses of reforms as well<lb/> as the fact that costs of reform are often concentrated on particular groups. The reform process had a fiscal<lb/> cost, but it was limited and easily outweighed by the overall gains: concomitant with the reforms, there was<lb/> a sharp rise in the trade to GDP ratio and business R&amp;D surged, boosting productivity growth to among the<lb/> highest in the OECD and the income-per-capita ranking improved from the 15 th place in the mid-1980s to<lb/> the 8 th currently. Not surprisingly, fiscal performance improved a lot as well: the general government<lb/> balance swung from a deficit peak in the early 1990s of more than 6% of GDP into a surplus by 1998. The<lb/> fiscal balance has stayed in surplus since then, except in one year, leading to the elimination of government<lb/> net debt in the course of 2006.<lb/> 41.<lb/> Clearly, for both countries the evidence is that major structural reforms brought a major<lb/> improvement in fiscal performance. Yet, how to apportion the success between a strengthening in<lb/> budgetary institutions and better growth performance is unclear.<lb/></p>

			<head>Policy implications<lb/></head>

			<p>42.<lb/> The recent reform of the Stability and Growth Pact provides more leeway for EU governments to<lb/> temporarily breach the 3% deficit limit if this can be shown to facilitate the implementation of effective,<lb/> but initially expensive, structural reform. While this principle is underpinned by a clear economic rationale,<lb/> its implementation is not obvious. Indeed, for it to be properly implemented a number of conditions will<lb/> have to be met:<lb/> • Budgets would need to clearly identify the structural policy measures that are being taken and<lb/> specify their immediate and multi-annual budgetary cost and benefit profile. So far, this is not<lb/> happening in a systematic way, with probably the United Kingdom being at the frontier (and even<lb/> there the picture is not always clear). Indeed, the Commission in its assessment of the most recent<lb/> batch of stability programmes suggested that the clause related to structural reforms would<lb/> benefit from a clear specification of the quantitative information necessary for assessing the<lb/> impact of structural reforms (EC, 2006).<lb/> • Budgets would also need to be explicit about the fiscal cost of inaction, i.e., report the budgetary<lb/> developments in the absence of structural reform. This is a form of transparency that is necessary<lb/> for the European authorities to call a balanced judgment on countries&apos; trade-offs between the<lb/> various options available, like reforming health care but not pensions, or any other combination<lb/> of reform programmes. However, it is rare to find such information in budgets.<lb/> • Budgets would, finally, need to give some indication of the broader economic effects of action or<lb/> inaction, in order to be able to call a judgment on the ex ante effectiveness and efficiency of the<lb/> proposed measures. However ex ante cost-benefit analysis is rare – not to mention ex post<lb/> cost-benefit analysis. The experience in countries like New Zealand and Australia has shown that<lb/> the longer-term benefits both in terms of the budget and overall economic performance may be<lb/> significant. Even so, it is not easy to disentangle the various forces at play. Fundamentally,<lb/> structural reform and the implementation of smart fiscal frameworks tend to go hand in hand –<lb/> indeed may be two sides of the same coin.<lb/> 43.<lb/> The simulation exercises highlight the positive budgetary effects of coordinated structural<lb/> reforms in the euro area. But they have to be accompanied by an adequate monetary policy response to<lb/> make sure that demand adjusts to the improved supply conditions swiftly. The budgetary gains would still<lb/> depend on the type of reform and their impact on employment and productivity. Efforts to improve supply<lb/> conditions are surely easier to co-ordinate or coordinated in any case, when it comes to single market<lb/> initiatives, such as the current drive to liberalise services across the European Union. Co-ordination is more<lb/> difficult to achieve for labour market reforms. In this domain, national policy initiatives by a single country<lb/> may only have a limited impact, especially in the short term and in the case of a large country. Indeed, in<lb/> monetary union, the strength of endogenous adjustment mechanism appears to be weaker in larger<lb/> countries. Moreover, if reforms were to be accompanied by an easing of fiscal policy, additional<lb/> macroeconomic gains would also appear very limited.<lb/> ECO/WKP(2006)21</p>
