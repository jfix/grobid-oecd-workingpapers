POLICY BRIEF No. 32 OECD DEVELOPMENT CENTRE Commodity Funds: How To Fix Them? Daniel Cohen, Thibault Fally and Sébastien Villemot by @BULLET 
Commodity prices are vulnerable to adverse shocks and slow to recover 
from them; producers, however, need some income stability. @BULLET 
By relating price triggers to historical averages, commodity funds can 
provide some protection to producers without trying to keep prices at 
unsustainable levels. @BULLET 
A commodity fund affording reasonable protection to producers from 
sudden fluctuations in prices can be implemented at a median cost of only 
about six months' worth of exports. POLICY BRIEF No. 32 © OECD 2007 THE OPINIONS EXPRESSED AND ARGUMENTS EMPLOYED IN THIS PUBLICATION ARE THE SOLE

AND DEVELOPMENT The OECD is a unique forum where the governments of 30 democracies work together to address the 
economic, social and environmental challenges of globalisation. The OECD is also at the forefront of efforts 
to understand and to help governments respond to new developments and concerns, such as corporate 
governance, the information economy and the challenges of an ageing population. The Organisation 
provides a setting where governments can compare policy experiences, seek answers to common 
problems, identify good practice and work to co-ordinate domestic and international policies. 
The OECD member countries are: Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, the Czech Republic, Denmark, 
Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Korea, Luxembourg, Mexico, the 
Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Portugal, the Slovak Republic, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, 
Turkey, the United Kingdom and the United States. The Commission of the European Communities takes 
part in the work of the OECD. 
OECD Publishing disseminates widely the results of the Organisation's statistics gathering and research 
on economic, social and environmental issues, as well as the conventions, guidelines and standards agreed 
by its members. 
The Development Centre of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development was established 
by decision of the OECD Council on 23 October 1962 and comprises 22 member countries of the OECD: 
Austria, Belgium, the Czech Republic, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Korea, 
Luxembourg, Mexico, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Slovak Republic, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, 
Turkey and the United Kingdom as well as Brazil since March 1994, Chile since November 1998, India since 
February 2001, Romania since October 2004, Thailand since March 2005 and South Africa since May 2006. 
The Commission of the European Communities also takes part in the Centre's Governing Board. 
The Development Centre, whose membership is open to both OECD and non-OECD countries, occupies 
a unique place within the OECD and in the international community. Members finance the Centre and serve 
on its Governing Board, which sets the biennial work programme and oversees its implementation. 
The Centre links OECD members with developing and emerging economies and fosters debate and 
discussion to seek creative policy solutions to emerging global issues and development challenges. 
Participants in Centre events are invited in their personal capacity. 
A small core of staff works with experts and institutions from the OECD and partner countries to fulfil 
the Centre's work programme. The results are discussed in informal expert and policy dialogue meetings, 
and are published in a range of high-quality products for the research and policy communities. The Centre's 
Study Series presents in-depth analyses of major development issues. Policy Briefs and Policy Insights 
summarise major conclusions for policy makers; Working Papers deal with the more technical aspects 
of the Centre's work.

shocks, whether to export prices or from natural disasters. The lowest-income 
countries have a higher incidence of shocks than other developing countries and 
tend to suffer larger damages when shocks occur. For the poorest countries, the 
average number of disasters between 1997 and 2001 has been one every 
2.5 years. Commodity price shocks are also more severe for poor countries. 
Low-income countries experience this type of shock on average every 3.3 years. 
About 26 highly-indebted countries have an export concentration of more than 
50 per cent in three or fewer commodities, while 62 per cent of the total exports 
of the least developed countries are unprocessed primary commodities. Exogenous shocks on commodity prices have significant direct adverse 
effects on growth and the multiplier effects of negative terms of trade shocks can 
also be large. Collier and Sewn (2001) show, for a sample of cases where the 
direct income loss averaged 6.8 per cent of GDP, the total correlated loss of 
income amounted to about twice that much, to 14 per cent of GDP. Research 
shows that these negative shocks increase the incidence of poverty. The shocks 
also have a significant impact on fiscal and external balances. An IMF study shows 
that terms-of-trade shocks and adverse weather conditions have played an 
important role in exacerbating debt problems 3 . In theory, the desired adjustment to a shock depends on the nature of the 
shock. The response to permanent and to transitory shocks should not be the 
same. If the shock is expected to be permanent, countries should adjust as fast 
as possible to the new environment. If instead a negative shock is expected to be 
reversed by a positive shock, it makes sense to finance the bad years out of savings 
or out of debt. Commodity prices, however, are usually very slow to recover 
from adverse shocks. This is one of the reasons why it has proven so difficult 
either to smooth their effect or to stabilise them. Countries that borrow when 
prices are low are bound to face financial difficulties before prices recover to their 
previous levels. In fact, even if a shock is deemed to be transitory, there can be 
considerable uncertainty about how long it will take to be reversed. Over 
optimism concerning the pace of a recovery has been a key factor behind the 
excessive occurrence of debt by poor countries. Similarly, Commodity Funds that attempt to stabilise prices at a given level 
are bound to fail. Either there is a negative shock and the Fund soon becomes 
insolvent, or there is a positive shock and the Fund becomes so well-endowed 
that the temptation to expropriate it becomes irresistible. This explains why 5 Commodity Funds: How To Fix Them? marketing boards have almost always failed, either through corruption or 
through bankruptcy. As documented in a recent FAO study, however, the 
dismantling of marketing boards has not been without creating new problems. 
Uncertainty regarding their income, in particular, has created credit problems to 
crop producers, so that input use has dropped significantly, explaining in part the 
drop of quality of the products 4 . On the donor community, there have been two major compensatory financing 
programmes for terms of trade shocks: the EU Stabex and Sysmin and the IMF's 
Compensatory Financing Facility (CFF). The EU's programme covered agricultural 
commodity exports and selected mineral exports. From 1975 to 2000, about 
6.1 billion euros was disbursed. The CFF provides financing when a country 
experiences a  " temporary "  shortfall in export earnings or an excess in cereal import 
costs. A total of SDR 25 billion has been disbursed in response to 344 requests for 
assistance since 1963. Neither experience was deemed to be highly successful 
however. As shown in Guillaumont et al. (2003), both mechanisms became 
increasingly contingent on conditionalities of various sorts, which have lengthened 
the delay between the occurrence of the shock and the need of the countries. Delays 
in response have actually been so long that they turn out to be pro-cyclical, rather 
than counter-cyclical as one would have expected (Brun et al. 2001). Collier and Dehn (2001) also present evidence that aid allocations are not well 
targeted to commodity price shocks. Commodity price shocks, they argue, are like 
 " silent crises " . Financial assistance in the event of a terms-of-trade shock appears 
to be harder to design and target than that for natural disasters assistance (natural 
disasters actually attract more external financing than commodity price shocks). These failures explain the conclusion that not much can or should be done 
to stabilise commodity prices. Exporting countries, it is sometimes argued, 
should behave as if any commodity shock was bound to be permanent and adjust 
accordingly. This is too extreme a conclusion. There is no reason why countries 
should not find ways to protect themselves against adverse shocks, if not fully at 
least partially. The idea developed in this Brief builds indeed upon the following 
intuition: countries can get protection against commodity shocks, but for a while 
only rather than indefinitely. Technically, the solution that we explore is the following. We propose to 
create new Commodity Funds, with limited liabilities, to stabilise commodity 
producers' income around a reference price which is a moving average of past 
prices. The reference price upon which the income of the producers is 
calculated is known in advance to the producers and yet is allowed to follow 
market trends smoothly. This avoids the pitfalls of past stabilisation based around 6 OECD Development Centre Policy Brief No. 32 a given reference price, which is bound, sooner or later, to be out of touch with 
market forces. In the simulations that we present, the reference price is a moving 
average of previous prices over the past five years. Even in the event of a 
permanent shock, this gives the country time to take the needed adjustment. How much would it cost to create a Fund that protects producers against 
deviations from such a five-year moving average? The answer is twofold. In the 
worst case scenario where the Fund should stand ready to guarantee producers 
against a total collapse of their prices, it would cost a one-off endowment worth 
2.7 times the yearly value of the exports that one seeks to protect. Note that this 
is a finite number: even if prices were to stay indefinitely nil, the Fund would stop 
guaranteeing producers after five years. In general, however, the Fund is bound 
to cost less. Over a period of 50 years, the median cost would be worth about 
six months exports. The Brief also presents the risk of default of the Fund 
associated to lower levels of endowment than the maximum needed. One year 
of exports would be associated to a risk of default of about 10 per cent over a 
50 years horizon. There are many ways by which the ideas involved in this mechanism could 
be applied. One is simply to create a Fund in which producers would be free to 
participate and which would be endowed accordingly. The Fund would act as an 
insurer, which producers would draw upon or replenish according to the prices 
that they face. Another idea would be to modulate traditional ODA according to the 
moving average idea that we propose. Commodity exporters would receive 
ODA that would vary inversely with deviations of commodity prices from past 
averages. The computations that are performed in the Brief would then help 
donors assess the cost to proceed along these lines. Empirical Investigation We seek to analyse how a Commodity Fund could guarantee a reference 
price to an exporting country, where the reference prices is a moving average of 
the price over the preceding years. In the sequel, we shall focus on a reference 
price based on the average of the past five years. In the simulation that we offer, 
the stabilisation is done through a Fund which is initially endowed with a given 
amount of resources. The aim of this Policy Brief is to determine the probability 
of depletion of the Fund and to investigate how much resources are needed to 
avoid (with various degrees of probability) its bankruptcy. 7 Commodity Funds: How To Fix Them? In order to calibrate the results, monthly commodity price data reported 
in the International Monetary Fund's International Financial Statistics, for the 
period January 1957 to December 2003 are used. The commodities used for the 
study are presented in Table 1. For each selected commodity, the table presents 
the sample period used for the study, the spot price in July 2003, then a figure 
which can be regarded as a rough estimate of the total exports of developing 
countries in 2003. In the following analysis, all prices will be real prices, deflated 
by a US producer price index, taking July 2003 as the reference. Table 1. Selected Commodities Commodities

3 970 Figures 1 to 4 plot monthly spot prices, along with monthly moving averages 
over 2, 5 and 10 years, with an initial lag of 1 year (i.e. the moving average is lagged 
by one year). With the exception of bananas, one striking feature of price 
movements is that the peaks appear to be more accentuated than the troughs, 
a feature that is analysed in Deaton and Laroque (1992). Simulating the Fund 5 There are many parameters which can be adjusted for the simulations. One 
is the number of years over which the moving average is calculated. We present 
simulations based on a 5 years moving average. Another parameter is the yearly 
interest rate, which we take equal to 5 per cent. The other key parameter, which 
we allow to vary in the simulations, is the initial endowment of the Fund, called 0 F . The first set of simulations has computed which endowments are needed 
in order to reduce the risk of bankruptcy of the Fund below a given level. They 
are presented in Table 2. 8 OECD Development Centre Policy Brief No. 32 Figure 1. Bananas 9 Commodity Funds: How To Fix Them? Figure 2. Cocoa Beans 10 OECD Development Centre Policy Brief No. 32 Figure 3. Cotton 11 Commodity Funds: How To Fix Them? Figure 4. Rice 12 OECD Development Centre Policy Brief No. 32 For example, the line for cocoa refers to price stabilisation for cocoa beans. 
With an initial endowment of 1.8 times the annual value of trade, the Fund will 
remain always positive with a 90 per cent chance. With an initial endowment 
worth 2.68 times the volume of trade, the Fund will never become negative, even 
at an infinite time horizon. This is in fact a general statistical property: it never 
takes more than 2.68 times the flows of trade volume to stabilise commodities 
along the lines of our proposal. The intuition is in fact quite simple. The worst case 
scenario is one in which the price of the commodity collapses to zero indefinitely. 
In that case the Fund has to pay the exporters one full year of exports during the 
first year, then 0.75, then 0.5 then 0.25 then nothing. That makes 2.5 years, given 
the interest on the Fund borrowed, that makes a bit more. Clearly, however, the numbers in Table 2 are worst case scenarios. In 
average, the Fund is much less costly. Ups and downs usually alternate, around 
the moving average, so that the Fund sometimes recaptures part of the transfers. 
The median cost of the Fund is simulated, when it is allowed to run for a period 
of 50 years. The results are shown in Table 3 below. Table 2. Endowment and Default Risk of a Commodity Fund Default risk

would take about less than 6 months of exports in 50 per cent of cases. The 
corresponding cost would be around 4 months for bananas. In the case of Cocoa, 
the cost would actually be negative: in average one would gain by offering this 
scheme to exporters. Other Options Two other alternative options were also tested. One is the operating cost 
of a Fund which would pool all five commodities together. In the case of a 10 per 
cent default risk and for a five-year moving average, a cost corresponding to 0.88 
times the volume of trade to be insured is required. This is quite significantly less 
than the amounts obtained for each individual fund, which varied from 1.12 to 
1.80 times the trade flows and shows that there would be some merit to form 
a  " mega Fund "  rather than individual ones. Another simulation is to calculate how large should be the endowment of 
a Fund that would stabilise commodities on an asymmetric basis, that is which 
would transfer resources in case of a bad shock but not to collect them in case 
of a positive one? Table 4 presents the results corresponding to a 10 per cent 
default risk. Table 4. Endowment Needed to Stabilise Prices

3.67 Note: As a fraction of trade volumes, with 10 per cent default risk. 14 OECD Development Centre Policy Brief No. 32 The asymmetrical scheme is clearly much more expensive than the 
symmetric one. In the case of cocoa, for instance, the Fund would need to be 
endowed with six times the corresponding volume of trade, while, under the 
symmetric case, the amount was only 1.81 times the flows involved. One important point should also be noted. As Fally (2004) demonstrates 
theoretically, one should not seek to protect the entirety of the producers' 
income. Indeed, in that case, the scheme would be open to manipulation. In year t 
for instance the producers could reduce production so as to let prices go up and 
then in year t+1 flood the market at the stabilised price. If instead they receive 
a protection for only the first x tons of their output, then the incentive to 
manipulate prices disappear. Policy Implications There is a wide array of institutions and issues implicated in this problem. 
The relevant institutions – whether IDA (the branch of the World Bank lending 
to the poorest countries) or the IMF or other members of the international 
donor community – could lend support to Commodity Funds. Currently, LIC 
government finances absorb alone the risks and shocks associated with a range 
of economic, geopolitical, epidemiological and climatic uncertainties. One could first think of creating new debt instruments that explicitly take 
account of exogenous risks. In September 1999, the World Bank introduced risk 
management products linked to its loan exposure. These hedging products are: 
interest rate swaps, caps and collars; currency swaps; and commodity price-
linked swaps. The Bank decided not to offer specific commodity-based loans at 
that time because it would have been difficult to undertake the commodity-based 
funding and liability management to match the disbursement periods of Bank 
loans while managing associated risks. The approach in this paper would help to overcome these difficulties. One 
idea would be to set up a Fund aimed at smoothing the payments made by the 
debtors to IDA for instance. (Gilbert et al., 2004) have calibrated similar ideas). 
The mechanism described here would not extinguish the debt in case of the 
prices falling to zero. It would simply give time to adjust. On the other hand, this 
would not be very costly. For a loan of 100 whose repayment is 5, all that would 
be needed is a Fund endowed with say 15 (see Cohen and Reisen, 2006, on a 
similar idea). The fact that the Funds have limited liabilities has the merit of putting 
a specific limit to the commitment of the donor community. 15 Commodity Funds: How To Fix Them? Making ODA counter-cyclical is another way of addressing the problem. 
Although this has long been a theme of donor agencies, they often fail to recognise 
that  " counter-cyclicality "  does not mean much when shocks are either long 
lasting or permanent. The idea developed in this brief allows to give a more 
precise content to this idea and to measure the corresponding cost of implementing 
it. ODA could include a component that allows to smooth commodity exporters 
incomes. Donors would commit a given amount of resources to a Commodity 
Fund, whose endowments could be directly counted as ODA at the time when 
they are granted by the donor. Conclusion This paper has presented a scheme which could be used in a variety of 
fashions: either directly to help producers protect themselves against adverse 
shocks, or to calibrate ODA to a government to dampen the impacts of price 
volatility on GDP. The scheme could also help tailor new loans to commodity 
dependent countries, smoothing their repayment pattern accordingly. The 
orders of magnitude presented should give some indication of the costs of 
supplying a revenue-smoothing mechanism. Notes 1.

www.oecd.org/dev/briefs DEVELOPMENT CENTRE POLICY BRIEFS In its research activities, the Development Centre aims to identify and analyse problems the implications of 
which will be of concern in the near future to both member and non-member countries of the OECD. The 
conclusions represent a contribution to the search for policies to deal with the issues involved. The Policy Briefs deliver the research findings in a concise and accessible way. This series, with its wide, 
targeted and rapid distribution, is specifically intended for policy and decision makers in the fields 
concerned. Commodity prices are usually very slow to recover from adverse shocks. This is one of the reasons why 
Commodity Funds have so often failed in the past, and why it is sometimes argued that producers should 
behave as if shocks were permanent. This Policy Brief argues that this would be too extreme a conclusion. 
Countries should be protected against adverse shocks. The goal of a viable Commodity Fund should not be 
to stabilise prices, however, but to smooth the income of the producers. Under the scheme that is presented 
in this Brief, countries get protection against deviation of commodity prices from a moving average of past 
prices. This avoids the pitfalls of past attempts to stabilise prices around a given level, and yet gives countries 
time to adjust to long lasting shocks. The brief calibrates empirically how much it would cost to create 
Commodity Funds of this kind. Over a period of a 50-year time horizon, and depending on the commodity, 
the median cost would be worth about six months of exports.
