			<head>ADDRESSING THE CHALLENGES<lb/> IN HIGHER EDUCATION IN NORWAY<lb/> By Vassiliki Koustogeogopoulou 1<lb/></head>

			<p>Competitiveness in a high-income, high-cost country such as Norway requires a highly skilled and<lb/> adaptable labour force. Access to higher education is also an important avenue for greater inclusiveness<lb/> and wellbeing. High quality tertiary education is of major importance for both economic and social goals.<lb/> Best practice for tertiary education is difficult to define, as the socio-economic and educational structure<lb/> and traditions differ across countries. However, the key challenges for a well-functioning tertiary system<lb/> are broadly the same. The OECD report on Tertiary Education for the Knowledge Society highlights the<lb/> need for responsive institutional governance, an efficient use of public funds, an effective quality assurance<lb/> system, and for polices that promote quality and research excellence (<ref type="biblio">Santiago et al., 2008</ref>). Equity in<lb/> tertiary education through equality of opportunities and improvements in participation of the least<lb/> represented groups add to these policy objectives.<lb/> Norway&apos;s tertiary education system is well-run overall, with a strong commitment to inclusiveness<lb/> and equity and an emphasis on quality. Students face low barriers to participation and attainment rates are<lb/> well above the OECD average. Moreover, research activity has risen rapidly. The system also matches<lb/> relatively well the demand and supply of tertiary graduates. At the same time, weaknesses in learning<lb/> outcomes (reported in some surveys), relatively low completion rates and long duration of studies, a fairly<lb/> dispersed structure, fewer internationally top-ranking universities than in Nordic peers, and the relatively<lb/> high costs of the system in terms of spending per student or share of GDP, point to potential efficiency and<lb/> quality issues.<lb/></p>

			<p>The paper discusses these challenges, and lays out options for improvement. It is important to connect<lb/> closely investment in higher education with outcomes, ensuring high quality. An important challenge in<lb/> structural reform is to resolve tensions between quality (and efficiency) objectives and the maintenance of<lb/> a substantial network of regional tertiary-education providers, many of which are small scale. The analysis<lb/> focuses on issues pertaining to higher education only, given the difference in nature and the small size of<lb/> the still developing vocational sector.<lb/> 1 Vassiliki Koustogeogopoulou is Economist on the Australia/Norway Desk in the Economics Department of OECD. This paper is<lb/> based on Chapter 1 of the 2016 OECD Economic Survey of Norway, published in January 2016 under the authority of the<lb/> Economic and Development Review Committee (EDRC). The author would like to thank Álvaro Pereira, Robert Ford, Piritta<lb/> Sorsa, Philip Hemmings and colleagues from the Education and other OECD Departments for valuable comments on earlier drafts.<lb/> The report also benefited from comments from the Norwegian authorities.

			<head>The Norwegian tertiary education system: Key features and challenges<lb/> A primarily public system with comparatively high spending<lb/></head>

			<p>The Norwegian tertiary education system is predominately public; 96% of spending on educational<lb/> institutions comes from public sources compared to 70%, on average, across OECD countries (<ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>,<lb/> Panel A; Box 1). This reflects a strong view that education should be accessible for all, in line with the<lb/> &quot; welfare society &quot; model characterising the Nordic countries (<ref type="biblio">Ahola et al., 2014</ref>). There are no tuition fees<lb/> at public institutions (these cater for over 85% of all students) in Norway and a financial support system<lb/> for living expenses is available, where all students are eligible for assistance. Public provision also reflects<lb/> the emphasis on regional considerations.<lb/> Spending on tertiary education is comparatively high both in terms of annual expenditure per student<lb/> and as a share of GDP (<ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>, Panels B and C). The difference in total public tertiary expenditure<lb/> vis-a-vis other countries is largely due to subsidies for living costs (scholarships and grants to<lb/> students/households and student loans), amounting to around 1% of GDP (well above the OECD average)<lb/> (<ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>, Panel B). Norway spends in total, as a share of mainland GDP, almost twice the OECD average,<lb/> and somewhat more than the other Nordic countries (<ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>, Panel B). Inclusion of the offshore sector<lb/> lowers Norway&apos;s total tertiary expenditure as a share of GDP, though it remains relatively high in<lb/> international comparison.<lb/></p>

			<head>The structure of provision is fairly decentralised, creating inefficiencies and impairing quality<lb/></head>

			<p>As of 2015, tertiary education in Norway was provided by 53 higher education institutions<lb/> (universities, specialised universities and university-colleges), owned or funded by the government<lb/> (<ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>, Panel A) (Box 1), and over a hundred post-secondary/tertiary vocational institutions (fagskoler),<lb/> offering shorter (up to two years) vocational training courses. In January 2016 some mergers have reduced<lb/> the number of higher education institutions (see below). Universities and university-colleges are the two<lb/> largest parts of the system. The post-secondary/tertiary vocational sector is still limited with about 16 000<lb/> students in 2013 (SSB, 2015a).<lb/> Higher education institutions are dispersed throughout the country and many of them are small. About<lb/> half of the 53 higher education institutions have less than 2000 students and around one-fifth of them less<lb/> than 250 (<ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>, Panel B). This fairly decentralised institutional structure largely reflects Norway&apos;s<lb/> strong commitment to supporting regional economies. Indeed, tertiary education policy was traditionally<lb/> related closely to the broader policy objective of preserving the spatial distribution pattern of population<lb/> (NMER<ref type="biblio">, 2005</ref>). The geographical diffusion of higher education institutions is aimed at increasing tertiary<lb/> participation in non-urban areas and reducing the &quot; brain drain &quot; towards the larger regions, such as Oslo<lb/> and Akershus, and also to alleviate the pressure on the traditional universities (OECD, 2009a).<lb/></p>

Higher education in Norway: Main features<lb/></table>

			<p>The higher education sector in Norway is governed by the Act for Universities and University-Colleges, which<lb/> since 2005, covers both public and private institutions (<ref type="biblio">Reichert and Ekholm, 2009</ref>). The Ministry of Education and<lb/> Research has the overall responsibility for the sector, including funding (NOKUT, 2013a). Public (state) institutions do<lb/> not charge fees for students, apart from those students who are not on a programme that leads to a degree or a<lb/> vocational diploma, as for example is the case of continuing education courses. Private institutions can demand fees<lb/> from students for all types of education, even when they receive state funding; but the fees must be used to the benefit<lb/> of the students. Students in public and private institutions may apply for loans to cover the costs of living, and also that<lb/> of fees in the latter case.<lb/></p>

			<p>The higher education sector principally consists of the following types of institutions: the universities (all of which<lb/> are state-owned), specialised universities (public or private) and the university-colleges (public or private). The<lb/> university-colleges were first formed in 1994 with the merger of 98 regional colleges into 26 new institutions. Since the<lb/> early 2000s the number of universities has doubled from 4 to 8 (NOKUT, 2013b). Three of the four new institutions are<lb/> the result of university-colleges have been upgraded to university status and are often referred to as the &quot; new<lb/> universities &quot; .<lb/></p>

			<p>In terms of programmes provided, universities offer extended education in areas such as medicine and law and<lb/> other programmes at an undergraduate level or above, while the university-colleges provide mainly courses with<lb/> professional orientation such as teacher training, nursing, engineering, and social work. Overall, universities are more<lb/> research-oriented than the university-colleges, the latter traditionally concentrating more on teaching<lb/> (<ref type="biblio">Hovdhaugen, 2013</ref>). However, as described in the main text this distinction is narrowing; several university-colleges<lb/> offer master&apos;s programmes and some also have the right to award doctoral degrees.<lb/> Admission to higher education is based on successful completion of upper secondary education with some<lb/> specified courses (leading to the Higher Education Entrance Qualification); some study fields have additional entrance<lb/> requirements (NOKUT, 2013a). Admission is based, in particular, on a mix of course grades and grades from exams<lb/> which are uniform across the country. Students who have completed upper secondary vocational training and two years<lb/> tertiary vocational education can also be admitted to higher education, conditional on meeting certain Norwegian-<lb/>language requirements. In addition, applicants who are 25 years old or more and do not fill the usual formal<lb/> requirements can be accepted for certain study programmes on an individual assessment based on formal and informal<lb/> skills.<lb/></p>

			<p>Completed higher education courses are measured in credits ( &quot; studiepoeng &quot; ) that comply with European Credit<lb/> Transfer System Standard (ECTS). The full-time workload for one academic year is 60 credits (NOKUT, 2013a).<lb/> A comprehensive reform in higher education 2002, known as the &quot; Quality Reform &quot; , introduced a new degree<lb/> structure (3-year bachelor&apos;s degree, 2-year master&apos;s degree and 3-year doctoral degree), a grading system and a<lb/> quality assurance system in line with the Bologna process (NMER, 2007). The new degree structure was implemented<lb/> for most of the programmes (EC, 2015). The 2002 reform also introduced new teaching and evaluation methods. The<lb/> Norwegian Agency of Quality Assurance (NOKUT), in operation since the early 2000s, is currently responsible for<lb/> monitoring quality in the sector (see below). The Quality Reform&apos;s measures also included a new governance regime,<lb/> that provided increased independence for institutions, and a performance-based funding system in education and<lb/> research (see below) (<ref type="biblio">PC, 2015</ref>).<lb/> Scale of operation plays an important role in the quality and efficiency of education, according to<lb/> OECD Tertiary Education for the Knowledge Society (<ref type="biblio">Santiago et al., 2008</ref>). Although there is no optimal<lb/> size, an important challenge is to ensure that institutions are of a sufficient size to promote regional<lb/> development, and more generally, the quality of tertiary education system. Norway&apos;s many small academic<lb/> environments and scattered education programmes raise important issues in this regard. A recent White<lb/> Paper on the structure of higher education highlights a number of limitations (Government of Norway,<lb/> 2015a). Some institutions, in particular, have difficulties in attracting both staff and students, resulting in<lb/> underutilisation of campus facilities and producing only few graduates and little research (Government of<lb/> <ref type="biblio">Norway, 2015a; Myklebust, 2015</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<p>Norway has a relatively low tertiary student-to-teacher ratio (<ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>, Panel A), especially among the<lb/> smaller institutions (<ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref> Panel B). A minimum number of students for courses is often considered as a<lb/> prerequisite for helping cost-effectiveness, as well as for broader curriculums and better quality of<lb/> programmes and student services, although a simple causal relationship is difficult to establish<lb/> (OECD, 2009b; <ref type="biblio">Vabø and Kårstein, 2014; Government of Norway, 2015a</ref>). The government considers<lb/> that, as a general rule, it is not appropriate that fewer than 20 students are enrolled in any given course.<lb/></p>

			<p>The White Paper on the structure of higher education concludes also that smaller institutions suffer<lb/> particularly from a lack of senior academic staff (i.e. professors, senior lecturers, professors and associate<lb/> professors) (Government of Norway, 2015a). Overall, around 46% of employees in the university-college<lb/> sector hold a doctoral degree, or have comparable academic qualification, on the basis of official data. This<lb/> is not necessarily a problem, what matters is whether the teaching and learning experiences are of high<lb/> quality. In this context, a national student survey of higher education (Studiebarometeret) reveals low<lb/> levels of satisfaction with regard to teachers&apos; feedback and individual counselling (<ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>, Panel A)<lb/> -both of great importance to acquisition of skills and knowledge (<ref type="biblio">Hamberg, et al., 2015</ref>). In addition, the<lb/> findings reveal relatively low scores in some critical areas which serve as proxies for learning outcomes,<lb/> such as indicators of experience with research and development of work and measures of innovative<lb/> thinking, suggesting scope for improvement (NOKUT, 2015) (<ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>, Panel B). Moreover, the OECD&apos;s<lb/> Survey of Adult Skills (a product of the OECD Programme for the International Assessment of Adult<lb/> Competencies – PIAAC) shows that around 10% of 20-34 year old tertiary graduates in Norway attain only<lb/> low levels of literacy (level 2 or below) (<ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref>). While this finding may also reflect, among other things,<lb/> shortfalls at earlier stages of education, and Norway fares better in the PIAAC survey than the OECD<lb/> average (<ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref>), it is still worrying.<lb/></p>

			<p>Furthermore, as noted in the White Paper, according to a large number of independent evaluations,<lb/> many academic environments in Norway are &quot; too small &quot; to conduct internationally competitive research<lb/> (Government of Norway, 2015a). Many of the evaluations highlight the importance of a &quot; critical mass &quot; in<lb/> research. This assessment is backed up by the Research Council of Norway (RCN) which also notes that<lb/> most of the successful research units in areas such as biology and medicine are typically large, and flags<lb/> concerns that the research landscape is &quot; far too often &quot; fragmented (RCN, 2011). Furthermore, international<lb/> evidence also points to links between research quality and the size of the research group (<ref type="biblio">Kenna and<lb/> Berche, 2011a, 2011b</ref>). The &quot; critical mass &quot; (broadly defined as the minimum size for a research group to<lb/> be viable in the longer term) varies substantially across subject areas. Once the critical mass is achieved, a<lb/> research team has increased opportunities for intra-group interactions which, according to Kenna and<lb/> Berche (2011a, 2011b), is a key driver of group quality. There is also a higher value ( &quot; upper critical<lb/> mass &quot; ), also discipline dependent, beyond which the link between research quality and group size weakens<lb/> (or even disappears) (<ref type="biblio">Kenna and Berche, 2011a, 2011b</ref>).<lb/> In addition, many institutions have limited ability to tap into external funding (Government of<lb/> <ref type="biblio">Norway, 2015a</ref>). For example, only about 20% of Norwegian tenured faculty apply for funding from the<lb/> Research Council of Norway (<ref type="biblio">Benner and Öquist, 2014</ref>). In general, Norwegian higher education<lb/> institutions are less successful than similar institutions in other Nordic countries in the competition for<lb/> funding from EU programmes (NMER, 2014). In addition, many institutions have a relatively low overall<lb/> participation in international network co-operations (Government of Norway, 2015a). Despite a rapid rise<lb/> in research activity over the past decade or so, Norway still ranks below the other Nordic countries in terms<lb/> of some key research indicators (see below).<lb/> Reforms underway to restructure the higher education sector (see below) aim to overcome these<lb/> difficulties, and improve quality, while maintaining accessibility throughout the country.<lb/></p>

			<head>A more integrated system has blurred distinction between institutions<lb/></head>

			<p>Norway&apos;s tertiary education system is more &quot; integrated &quot; compared, for instance, to those in Denmark<lb/> and Finland (<ref type="biblio">Ahola et al., 2014</ref>). There are few barriers to the recognition of credits and study programmes<lb/> between higher education institutions (universities and university-colleges), enabling students to combine<lb/> courses and institutions and transfer between them. It is also possible for students who have achieved a<lb/> two-year vocational tertiary education to automatically access higher education in academic tracks<lb/> (see Box 1). Integration of the two types of higher education institutions has been a policy goal over an<lb/> extended period (OECD, 2009a). This is reflected, for example, in the adoption in 1981 of a flexible credit<lb/> transfer system, entitling college graduates to further their education at the university level, and the<lb/> inclusion in mid-1990s of state university-colleges under the same act as universities (Act for Universities<lb/> and University-Colleges), providing a common framework for the organisation and governance of these<lb/> institutions (<ref type="biblio">Kyvik, 2009</ref>).<lb/> Increased integration, however, has blurred the boundaries between universities and<lb/> university-colleges, raising concerns about the diversity, and potentially quality, of the sector<lb/> (OECD, 2012a). Common rules and regulation for the higher education sector, for instance, under the Act<lb/> for Universities and University-Colleges (Box 1), facilitated student mobility but also increased<lb/> standardisation across the two sub-sectors (<ref type="biblio">Maassen, et al., 2011</ref>). University-college sector curricula had<lb/> to adapt to meet the formal requirements for transferability and recognition by the universities, weakening<lb/> the distinctive role of university-college sector as a more practically-oriented type of tertiary education<lb/> (OECD, 2012a).<lb/> The divide between universities and university-colleges has also become blurred following the<lb/> introduction of institutional accreditation in 2002 (under the &quot; Quality Reform &quot; in higher education, see<lb/></p>

			<p>Box 1) which opened up the opportunity for university-colleges to acquire a university status. This has<lb/> resulted in an &quot; academic drift &quot; in the university-college sector, both in terms of programmes at a higher<lb/> level and of institutional hierarchy (NOKUT, 2013b). Four &quot; new &quot; universities have been established<lb/> between 2003 and 2012, three of which being the result of an upgrading in the status of university-colleges<lb/> (<ref type="biblio">Box 1</ref>). At the same time, universities have started to offer professionally related courses, besides the<lb/> traditional academic programmes, in order to retain and attract more students (<ref type="biblio">Maassen et al., 2011;<lb/> OECD, 2012a</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<head>High levels of tertiary attainment in the population and rising research activity<lb/></head>

			<p>Norway&apos;s predominately public and tuition-free tertiary education system has encouraged<lb/> participation, resulting in entry rates that are among the highest in OECD (<ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref>, Panel A). Graduation<lb/> rates are above the OECD average, although they still fall behind those in some neighbouring countries<lb/> (<ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref>, Panel B). Norway enjoys a comparatively high level of tertiary attainment. In total, over 40% of<lb/> adults aged 25-65 had completed this level of education in 2014, outperforming many other countries<lb/> (<ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref>, Panels C). This share is higher for younger adults (25-34 years) than their older counterparts<lb/> (55-64 years) and for women than men (<ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref>, Panels C and D). As one might expect, those with<lb/> tertiary education also have high skills: around 30% of tertiary-educated adults (25-64 year) perform at the<lb/> highest levels in literacy proficiency (Level 4 or 5) compared to less than 10% in the case of those with a<lb/> lower level of education (<ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref>, Panel E).<lb/></p>

			<figure>Developments in research activity are also encouraging. There was a steep rise in research production<lb/> (as measured by publication activity) since 2003, while the total number of research and development<lb/> (R&amp;D) staff in higher education increased by approximately 63% from 2003-2013 (Figure 6, Panel F).<lb/> ECO/WKP(2016)9<lb/> Figure 6. Tertiary education outcomes<lb/></figure>

			<p>1.<lb/> Entry rates and graduation rates include only tertiary-type A education (ISCED 5A), which is largely theory-based<lb/> programmes designed to provide sufficient qualifications for entry to advanced research programmes and professions with<lb/> high skill requirements, such as medicine, dentistry or architecture. Duration at least 3 years full-time, though usually 4 or<lb/> more years. Tertiary-level entry rate is an estimated probability, based on current entry patterns, that a young adult will enter<lb/> tertiary education during his or her lifetime. Graduation rates represent the estimated percentage of an age cohort that is<lb/> expected to graduate over their lifetime.<lb/></p>

			<head>But relatively low degree completion rates and long time to completion<lb/></head>

			<p>Internationally comparable data on completion rates indicate that Norway is below the OECD average<lb/> (<ref type="figure">Figure 7</ref>). National statistics show that less than half of the bachelor&apos;s degree students who enrolled<lb/> in 2009 completed their studies within 3 years, rising to 65% for completions within 5 years (SSB, 2015b)<lb/> (<ref type="figure">Figure 8</ref>). While these shares have increased in recent years (<ref type="figure">Figure 8</ref>), a relatively large number of<lb/> Norwegian students still spend more than the expected time to complete a degree. More than half of those<lb/> not-completing their studies within 5 years drop out.<lb/></p>

			<p>Non-completion and late completion of degrees can reflect various factors such as insufficient<lb/> academic preparation prior to enrolment, inadequate career guidance, and a slow study progression<lb/> (<ref type="biblio">Hovdhaugen, 2012; OECD, 2014a; PC, 2015</ref>). In Norway&apos;s case, however, a key factor is that the cost of<lb/> trying and failing tertiary education is low because there are no tuition fees and jobs are easy to come by.<lb/> This generates high demand for tertiary education, but means little attention may be paid to completion<lb/> (and perhaps also to the vocational aspect of courses when choosing what to study). Hovdhaugen (2012)<lb/> identifies work commitments as the most common reason for dropping out from tertiary education in<lb/> Norway, which is indicative that the healthy job market is indeed a factor behind non-completion or slow<lb/> study progression. These outcomes are not necessarily negative as they can reflect students successfully<lb/> combining work and study.<lb/></p>

			<p>In addition to student incentives, late completions may also reflect the high degree of flexibility of the<lb/> tertiary education sector as this allows for changes in the study programmes and facilitates taking breaks<lb/> ( &quot; stop-outs &quot; ) in studies (NMER, 2005). Available data (Eurostudent IV) show, for instance, that more than<lb/> one in 10 students in Norway had an interruption of longer than one year during their studies, exceeding<lb/> the corresponding shares in other Nordic countries (<ref type="biblio">Orr et al., 2011</ref>). A flexible system can have several<lb/> advantages, notably giving a student the opportunity to make another choice along the way and consider an<lb/> alternative study programme that is more in line with his/her interests. There are challenges to completion,<lb/> however, as students are more likely to drop out the longer they take to finish their studies<lb/> (<ref type="biblio">Hovdhaugen, 2012</ref>). In Norway, students are typically somewhat older, not only when they graduate, but<lb/> also when they commence their studies. The latter arises because many young Norwegians take a period<lb/> off from study after they finish upper secondary school in order to travel or work, for example<lb/> (OECD, 2009a). Half of the Norwegian tertiary education students are aged 25 years and over. Older<lb/> students may take more time to complete their studies, as they usually organise them according to their<lb/> work schedule and financial constraints (<ref type="biblio">Orr et al., 2011</ref>).<lb/> Some caveats on the completion figures are important to consider. Some of the students who have not<lb/> graduated may be still enrolled, or may have finished their education at a different institution than the one<lb/> they started at. This is especially the case in tertiary education systems with flexible structures as in the<lb/> Norwegian one, where transfers are common (<ref type="biblio">Hovdhaugen, 2009, 2011, 2013</ref>). Still, non-completions<lb/> raise efficiency and quality concerns as they can represent a waste of financial and human resources<lb/> (<ref type="biblio">Tremblay et al., 2012</ref>). The long time to completion heightens these concerns. Late completions are an<lb/> important factor for drop outs in Norway (<ref type="biblio">Hovdhaugen, 2012</ref>). OECD estimates suggest large gains in<lb/> terms of graduation rates from an increase in Norway&apos;s completion rates to best international level<lb/> (<ref type="figure">Figure 9</ref>).<lb/> ECO/WKP(2016)9<lb/></p>

			<head>Students&apos; social background still counts<lb/></head>

			<p>As elsewhere, students&apos; socio-economic background has a bearing on participation and performance<lb/> in tertiary education. While complete removal of these influences is practically impossible, disadvantages<lb/> and gaps generated by socio-economic background need to be eroded further. Data from Statistics Norway<lb/> suggest for instance that in 2014, 60% of 19-24 year olds with at least one parent having more than four<lb/> years of tertiary education entered tertiary education, compared to slightly over 16% among those whose<lb/> parents only have compulsory education (<ref type="figure">Figure 10</ref>, Panel A). This disparity has been declining over time,<lb/> especially for women, but is still very large (<ref type="figure">Figure 10</ref>, Panels A and B). International comparisons also<lb/> indicate relative large differences in tertiary participation according to parents&apos; educational attainment<lb/> (<ref type="figure">Figure 10</ref>, Panel C). The immigration status of students also appears to influence tertiary participation,<lb/> according to the data from Statistics Norway for the 19-24 year-old cohort, especially in the case of women<lb/> (<ref type="figure">Figure 10</ref>, Panel D). The difference in attendance rates between first generation immigrants and students<lb/> without an immigrant background stands for young women at over 20 percentage points, compared to<lb/> 15 percentage points for young men. It is worth noting that second generation immigrants is the group with<lb/> the highest participation, and this applies for both genders.<lb/></p>

			<p>Completion rates also differ according to students&apos; educational background, with students from well-<lb/>educated families performing comparatively well. Indicatively, of the new students in 2006 whose parents<lb/> were highly educated (more than four years of tertiary education), around 80% had completed their studies<lb/> after 8 years, against 45% of students whose parents only had compulsory education (<ref type="figure">Figure 10</ref>, Panel E).<lb/> Interesting this discrepancy has fallen in recent years for men but increased for women (<ref type="figure">Figure 10</ref>,<lb/> Panel F). A recent study further points to social differences with regard to the type of study, with students<lb/> from less educated families being more likely to attend professional three-year programmes rather than<lb/> longer ones (<ref type="biblio">Hovdhaugen, 2013</ref>). To the extent that such programmes enable students from less educated<lb/> backgrounds to make a smooth transition into a good quality jobs and careers, however, this should not be<lb/> a concern.<lb/></p>

			<p>Access and success in tertiary education can also be influenced by student&apos;s early schooling<lb/> (OECD, 2014a). Recent results from national tests indicate, for instance, that students whose parents do not<lb/> have tertiary education achieve lower average scores in both reading and mathematics compared to their<lb/> peers whose parents are highly educated (<ref type="figure">Figure 11</ref>). This highlights the importance of addressing<lb/> inequalities in learning opportunities at the earliest stages of schooling.<lb/></p>

			<head>Responsiveness of the system to future labour-market demand is a challenge<lb/></head>

			<p>Overall, the supply of tertiary graduates in Norway has developed broadly in line with demand from<lb/> the labour market (<ref type="biblio">Cappelen et al., 2013</ref>). However, supply shortages for some oil-related positions, in<lb/> particular engineers, have long been an issue (<ref type="biblio">PC, 2015</ref>). Company survey data show, for example, that<lb/> in 2010 there was an unmet demand of about 9 500 workers with engineering and science degrees<lb/> (<ref type="biblio">Cappelen et al., 2013</ref>). The problem has since been reduced by a supply response in terms of engineering<lb/> graduates (see discussion below). The current slowdown in oil investments has also lessened the scale of<lb/> supply shortages. If current trends continue, there may be a more balanced growth (and even a small<lb/> surplus) in the years to come between the demand and supply of engineers and people with backgrounds in<lb/> science, according to long term skills projections of the Statistics Norway (<ref type="biblio">SSB, 2013, 2014</ref>) (<ref type="figure">Figure 12</ref>,<lb/> Panel A).<lb/> However, according to these projections, which should be interpreted with caution given their<lb/> sensitivity to changes in underlying assumptions, the supply of graduates in the fields of economics<lb/> and administration and social sciences and law is set to overshoot in the next decade or so<lb/> (<ref type="figure">Figure 12</ref>, Panels B and C), but to undershoot in some of the more &quot; practical &quot; courses, namely, teachers<lb/> and nurses (<ref type="figure">Figure 12</ref>, Panels D and E) (<ref type="biblio">SSB, 2013, 2014</ref>). The long term skills projections also indicate a<lb/> shortage as well of workers with upper secondary vocational education, probably due to the low<lb/> completion rates, as discussed in previous Surveys (OECD, 2008a, 2014b) (<ref type="figure">Figure 12</ref>, Panel F).<lb/></p>

			<p>There has been a promising upward trend in enrolment in STEM fields (science, technology,<lb/> engineering and maths), which are important for driving innovation (<ref type="figure">Figure 13</ref>, Panel A). A comparatively<lb/> strong labour market in recent years for those with quantitative skills in Norway, along with reforms to<lb/> boost STEM fields, partly explains this upward trend. Such reforms include an increase in higher education<lb/> places on maths, science and technology, a new framework for engineering education, and a write off of<lb/> teachers&apos; student loans if they have an advanced degree in subjects like maths (Government of Norway,<lb/> 2015b). Despite this progress, more efforts may be needed to boost STEM enrolment as Norway is still<lb/> below the OECD average (<ref type="figure">Figure 13</ref>, Panel B). Demand for these skills is expected to increase in the years<lb/> ahead (OECD 2008a, 2014c). In addition, there are complications in using long-run projections for<lb/> assessment. <ref type="figure">Figure 12</ref> (Panel A) suggests that, as a whole, there will be an excess supply of scientists and<lb/> engineers. However, this largely reflects assumptions in the projection about shrinkage of the oil sector and<lb/> corresponding fall in demand of oil-related STEM professions. At the same time, care is needed in<lb/> developing STEM-related policies. Disaggregated data show quite different labour market outcomes across<lb/> STEM disciplines, which vary over time (<ref type="figure">Figure 14</ref>). Also, signals from the data can be mixed. For<lb/> instance, recent business and graduate surveys reveal that employers claim for sizeable shortages in certain<lb/> skills, such as information and communication technology (ICT), even where there is a relatively high<lb/> unemployment rate among graduates in these fields (<ref type="figure">Figure 14</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<p>Addressing skills shortages, wherever they arise, is important for Norway&apos;s ability to be<lb/> internationally competitive. A weak response of skills development to labour-market demand can reflect a<lb/> number of interrelated factors. It may be the case, for example, as noted in the OECD Skills Strategy<lb/> Diagnostic Report for Norway (OECD, 2014c), that students&apos; attention to the job-market &quot; pay-off &quot; in<lb/> choosing courses is weakened because they do not have to fund their own studies, although the recent<lb/> increase in STEM provides some encouraging signs in this regard (OECD, 2014c). But other factors, such<lb/> as inadequate career services and/or weak market signals due to low unemployment and compressed wage<lb/> distribution in Norway, may also contribute. Beyond these possible reasons, however, it may also be the<lb/> case that the consumption-good aspect of tertiary education (enjoyment of study and learning) is a<lb/> comparatively big driver of tertiary education choices for Norwegian students compared with the<lb/> investment-good dimension.<lb/></p>

			<head>International academic credentials are relatively low<lb/></head>

			<p>Norway has fewer universities than its Nordic neighbours in a ranking of top universities on the basis<lb/> of research-related indicators and other indicators, such as the degree of internationalisation of higher<lb/> education institutions and their ability to transfer knowledge to, and attract funding from, the business<lb/> sector (<ref type="figure">Figure 15</ref>, Panels A to D).<lb/> Measures of research quality, such as the European Commission index of research excellence (which<lb/> covers the quality of scientific production as well as technological development) and average cited<lb/> publications, place Norway above EU average but still below its Nordic peers (<ref type="figure">Figure 15</ref>, Panel E). In<lb/> addition, high-impact research, as defined by the share of national publications in a field that are in the<lb/> field&apos;s 10% most cited publications globally, is relatively low compared to neighbouring countries<lb/> <ref type="figure">Figure 15</ref>, Panel E). Norway&apos;s research ranking is the result of multiple factors. A recent analysis of the<lb/> Norwegian university research environments by the Research Council Norway (RCN), for instance,<lb/> cites inward looking leadership, relatively few international recruitments, administrative barriers, the<lb/> extensive teaching tasks in faculties and the predominance of small research groups with limited external<lb/> funding among the factors that can be impeding high-impact research (<ref type="biblio">Benner and Öquist, 2014</ref>).<lb/> The report further highlights the importance of a rigorous scientific quality control of sectoral projects.<lb/> ECO/WKP(2016)9<lb/></p>

			<head>Promoting efficiency and quality in higher education<lb/> Plans to merge institutions are a positive step<lb/></head>

			<p>The Norwegian authorities aim to deal with the quality challenges arising from the many small<lb/> academic environments and scattered education programmes. This is to be achieved by reforming the<lb/> structure of higher education institutions by merging a number of institutions and other measures such as<lb/> reforms in the funding system and stricter accreditation requirements (discussed further below). As of<lb/> January 2016, the total number of higher education institutions has been reduced from 53 to 42. Further<lb/> merging initiatives are under consideration (Government of Norway, 2015a). The first wave of merger<lb/> proposals was initiated by the institutions themselves, though with input and encouragement from the<lb/> government (which also ultimately approves the proposed mergers) in the form of assessment of the<lb/> strength of institutions using a range of quality criteria, including the number of applicants, completions<lb/> and publications. The government has signalled that institutions standing alone after a first round of<lb/> mergers could be reassessed and ultimately merged in a government-driven process. The process underway<lb/> mainly concerns university-colleges merging with universities or other university-colleges (Government of<lb/> Norway, 2015a). Overall, the merging process will result in a significant remapping and re-organisation of<lb/> the higher education sector, and in a reduced number of institutions.<lb/></p>

			<p>These mergers echo previous developments in Norway and also in a number of other countries. For<lb/> instance, mergers have featured in tertiary education reform in the other Nordic countries as well as<lb/> Australia, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom (<ref type="biblio">Kyvik and Stensaker, 2013</ref>) (Box 2). However, it<lb/> seems that there is not a definitive answer when it comes to the outcomes of mergers (Box 2).<lb/> Ensuring good conditions for successful mergers is important. Good outcomes in the merger process<lb/> will require, on the basis of the international experience, careful selection of partners, adequate and<lb/> sufficiently flexible financial support during the merging process, and an effective management and<lb/> leadership (Box 2). It is welcome, in this context, that the merging process currently underway in Norway<lb/> is based on concrete performance criteria, as described above.<lb/></p>

			<p>The financial support to be provided to the merging institutions is also welcome. The upfront costs of<lb/> mergers, including those for upskilling staff and organisational changes, usually tend to be substantial,<lb/> while any financial benefits tend to be long term (<ref type="biblio">Skodvin 2014; Finnegan, 2015</ref>). All the institutions<lb/> involved in the merging process are provided with additional support from the government. Sufficient<lb/> financial flexibility is very important given that the mergers differ in nature and size (<ref type="biblio">Skodvin, 2014</ref>).<lb/> Closely monitoring the outcomes of the merging process is essential given mixed experiences<lb/> (<ref type="biblio">Skodvin, 1999, 2014 and</ref> Box 2). To meet its objective, the reform should pave the wave for more<lb/> high-profile institutions with better access to research facilities and more efficient and better quality<lb/> tertiary education outcomes. More solid higher education institutions will be also better prepared to cater<lb/> for regional needs and development.<lb/></p>

			<head>Box 2. Mergers: International trends and experiences<lb/></head>

			<p>Mergers among higher education institutions have been common in OECD countries in recent decades. Indeed,<lb/> Norway itself saw a significant wave of mergers in 1994, when 98 colleges that offered mainly professional<lb/> programmes (for example, teaching and nurse training and general engineering) were consolidated into 26 state<lb/> university-colleges (<ref type="biblio">Kyvik and Stensaker, 2013</ref>). Furthermore, since the early 2000s university-colleges have opted<lb/> (voluntarily) for a university status that also involved mergers (NOKUT, 2013b). Other countries have also experienced<lb/> important merging processes. In Denmark, for instance, mergers in 2007 saw 13 government research institutions and<lb/> 12 universities merged, respectively, into 3 government research institutions and 8 universities. Furthermore, in 2008,<lb/> the 22 Centres for Further Education were merged into 8 Regional University-Colleges (<ref type="biblio">Amaral, 2009; Finnegan,<lb/> 2015</ref>). In the Netherlands, reforms have seen mergers between research-intensive universities and universities of<lb/> applied science (<ref type="biblio">Santiago, et al., 2008</ref>). In Finland, Aalto University was created in 2010 as a merger of three<lb/> universities and aimed to foster multi-disciplinary education and research in the fields of science, economics and art<lb/> and design. Australia and the United Kingdom have also used mergers in major restructuring efforts to build larger and<lb/> more comprehensive institutions (<ref type="biblio">Santiago, et al., 2008</ref>). Furthermore, there has been a wide variety of international<lb/> collaborations and arrangements between universities across borders with the aim to strengthen performance and add<lb/> economies of scale in teaching and research.<lb/> Mergers vary in character. They can take place between institutions of a comparable or different size; and<lb/> between institutions with similar or complementary profiles and/or statuses (<ref type="biblio">Pruvot et al., 2015</ref>). Governments used<lb/> (and still use) mergers for a variety of reasons, for instance, to address low efficiency and quality, and overcome<lb/> problems of institutional fragmentation (<ref type="biblio">Harman and Harman, 2003</ref>). Institutions themselves also initiate mergers to<lb/> address financial problems or for more strategic reasons, such as to strengthen the institution&apos;s position at the national<lb/> and international context (<ref type="biblio">Skodvin, 2014</ref>).<lb/> In general, according to Skodvin (2014), the merging process is expected to result in: &quot; administrative &quot; benefits<lb/> (for example, savings with regard to human resources due to economies of scale and a more professional and efficient<lb/> administration); &quot; economic &quot; benefits (save money); as well as, &quot; academic &quot; benefits, including eliminating duplicative<lb/> programmes, strengthening research and teaching, increasing academic collaboration/integration, and diversifying<lb/> academic profiles. Potentially, there are strong technical synergies to be gained from mergers derived, for example,<lb/> from the pooling of academic talent, greater staffing/and or financial resources and better access to scientific<lb/> equipment, which can help raise the quality of education and research (Government of Norway, 2015a; <ref type="biblio">Pruvot et al.,<lb/> 2015</ref>).<lb/> However, evidence on the outcomes of mergers is unclear (<ref type="biblio">Goreham, 2011</ref>). Empirical studies show that<lb/> experiences with mergers in Norway and several other countries are &quot; quite mixed &quot; , and this finding refers not only to<lb/> their intended economic and administrative benefits, but also intended improvements in the quality of higher education<lb/> and research (<ref type="biblio">Skodvin 1999, 2014</ref>) – which is a central aim of the Norwegian reform. Overall, mergers are complex,<lb/> resource-intensive, and time consuming processes which require a number of pre-conditions to succeed. While there<lb/> is no single solution for all merger cases, cross-country experience could be helpful in this regard.<lb/></p>

			<head>Some lessons learned from international experience<lb/></head>

			<p>International experience suggests that the approach taken to process in institutional mergers has a significant<lb/> bearing on their success, in particular:<lb/></p>

			<head>Planning and design<lb/></head>

			<p> The motives and objectives of mergers need to be stated with clarity and be, generally, valid and accompanied<lb/> by a detailed planning of the process (<ref type="biblio">Melin et al., 2013; Skodvin, 2014</ref>). Inter alia, this helps keep up reform<lb/> momentum.<lb/></p>

			<p> Voluntary mergers generally work better than the compulsory ones, often initiated by external threats (for<lb/> example, those related to falling student demand and competition), or some degree of government incentive,<lb/> pressure, or direction (<ref type="biblio">Harman and Harman, 2003</ref>). Ideally all institutions involved in merger negotiations<lb/> should have some gains from the process.<lb/></p>

			<p> Where merging institutions have complementary missions and cultures, the chances for succeeding are far<lb/> greater (<ref type="biblio">Skodvin, 2014</ref>).<lb/>  Geographical proximity remains important despite advances in communication technology. International<lb/> experience suggests that most successful mergers took place between institutions which were physically not far<lb/> from each other, or in the same place (<ref type="biblio">Skodvin, 1999</ref>).<lb/></p>

				<formula>(continued)<lb/></formula>

			<head>Box 2-Mergers: International trends and experiences (cont.)<lb/> Effective implementation<lb/></head>

			<p> Strong management and leadership are key for effective implementation of merger plans and help reducing<lb/> the uncertainty and stresses on staff and systems that accompany mergers (<ref type="biblio">Skodvin, 2014</ref>). Key<lb/> management staff should be appointed at the early stage of the process to increase effectiveness (<ref type="biblio">Melin<lb/> et al., 2013</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<head> Involvement</head>

			<p>of the staff, and students, is of great importance for the merging process, helping to boost<lb/> internal support and willingness to co-operate (<ref type="biblio">Melin et al., 2013</ref>).<lb/>  Mergers work best if the participating institutions can move quickly (<ref type="biblio">Harman and Harman, 2003</ref>). A certain<lb/> pace is essential to maintain momentum (<ref type="biblio">Melin et al., 2013</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<head>External funding<lb/></head>

			<p> External financial support helps institutions strike merger deals and smooth merger processes. Transition<lb/> costs can be substantial, especially in areas such as harmonising pay and benefit systems, ICT-systems,<lb/> and upskilling of personnel (<ref type="biblio">Skodvin, 1999, 2014; Finnegan, 2015</ref>). Financial flexibility and access to<lb/> adequate resources are of major importance during the merging process (<ref type="biblio">Skodvin, 2014</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<head>Enhancing the effectiveness of governance and leadership<lb/></head>

			<p>A new system of institutional governance was introduced in 2003 as part of a wider reform on higher<lb/> education (the &quot; Quality Reform &quot; , see Box 1). The new system gave institutions more autonomy in internal<lb/> organisation and leadership. For instance, it gave greater leeway for providers to appoint management and<lb/> for external representatives on boards (<ref type="biblio">Bleiklie, et al., 2011; Maassen et al., 2011</ref>). Institutions can now<lb/> choose between the traditional governance model of an elected rector (who automatically becomes chair of<lb/> the board, and is invariably an existing member of staff) and a model which combines an external chair<lb/> appointed by the Ministry of Education and Research and a rector (who has responsibility for both<lb/> academic and administrative matters) who is appointed by the board. Increased autonomy was<lb/> accompanied by a new funding system and stronger monitoring mechanisms through the establishment of a<lb/> national quality assurance agency (both discussed below).<lb/> Despite these efforts, the system of higher-education governance falls short of the mark on some<lb/> fronts. According to Norway&apos;s Productivity Commission, the system still does not adequately promote<lb/> quality improvement (PC, 2015). In particular, the Commission highlights an apparent inconsistency<lb/> between efforts by government to stimulate competition for students and research funding in tertiary<lb/> education, but meanwhile an absence of mechanisms to bring about closure of weak educational or<lb/> research programmes. There are also concerns about increased bureaucratisation; growth in administrative<lb/> positions has been rapid, typically outpacing increases in teaching and research positions (PC, 2015).<lb/> Potential reasons for this are increased reporting requirements, in tandem with enhanced institutional<lb/> autonomy under the Quality Reform (Box 1), the fast growth of the higher education system and an<lb/> increased scope for externally funded research (<ref type="biblio">PC, 2015; Stensaker, 2015</ref>).<lb/> However, neither the governing bodies of educational institutions appear to have made, so far,<lb/> extensive use of the room for strategic manoeuvre offered to them under the Quality Reform, including the<lb/> right to choose a more managerialist internal governance structure. On the basis of available information,<lb/> only half of the institutions appear to have appointed rectors, so far. Still, there seems to be more deep<lb/> changes at lower levels, with the majority of the institutions having introduced appointed leadership at<lb/> faculty and department levels (<ref type="biblio">Bleiklie, et al., 2011</ref>).<lb/> The government believes that a management model that combines an external chairman and an<lb/> appointed rector assures the recruitment of the most qualified management team and advocates this as the<lb/> main model for higher education institutions. A proposition that changes the Act on Universities and<lb/> University-Colleges by making appointed leadership the main, but still optional, model for recruitment at<lb/> Norwegian higher education institutions is in the parliamentary process. This move goes into right<lb/> direction. A more managerialist governance structure helps institutions adjust and develop business in a<lb/> reorganised higher-education sector. Moreover, an appointed rather than elected leader may find it easier,<lb/> according to an OECD study, to implement important changes that cut across vested interest, though the<lb/> process of appointment is crucial to ensure leader&apos;s credibility within the institution (OECD, 2003).<lb/> International experience also highlights the importance of strong management and leadership for the<lb/> effective implementation of the merging process, and the need for key management staff to be appointed at<lb/> the early stage of the process (Box 2). Moreover, having a single chief executive, the rector, being<lb/> responsible for all matters (academic and administrative) within the institution, as is envisaged by the<lb/> &quot; preferred model &quot; , would strengthen management and accountability, according to the 2009 OECD Review<lb/> of Tertiary Education of Norway (OECD, 2009a). In light of the apparent advantages of this alternative<lb/> management model, the government should consider financial incentives for institutions that adopt it,<lb/> monitoring closely outcomes.<lb/></p>

			<head>Fostering efficiency and quality through the funding system<lb/></head>

			<p>Most of the revenue (around 80%) of Norwegian higher education institutions comes as a block grant<lb/> from the central government. Institutions also receive various forms of external funding, including from<lb/> the Norwegian Research Council, European Union and private projects and donations (<ref type="biblio">Reichert and<lb/> Ekholm, 2009</ref>). Following reform in 2002, the government&apos;s block grant, in broad terms, comprises:<lb/> i) &quot; basic &quot; funding, based on specific priorities over time for the institutions; and ii) &quot; performance-based &quot;<lb/> funding (education and research incentives), determined by a number of indicators, such as study credit<lb/> points, student exchanges with foreign institutions and research publications (Box 3). At present, the basic<lb/> funding accounts for about two-thirds of the government financing and the performance-based funding the<lb/> remaining one third.<lb/></p>

			<p>The funding model adopted in 2002 is better than previous arrangements on several fronts. There is<lb/> stronger focus on results rather than inputs and better transparency in the allocation of funds across<lb/> institutions (at least with regard to the performance-based allocations) (<ref type="biblio">Santiago et al., 2008</ref>). The 2002<lb/> reform also sought to enhance institutional autonomy and flexibility by making the board of each<lb/> institution responsible for the management and use of their total block grant.<lb/> However, the current funding scheme is criticised by some as rigid and static. A recent study by the<lb/> Research Council Norway notes, for instance, that universities flag concerns that room for manoeuvre is<lb/> limited as, at departmental level, funding is tied primarily to positions and only a fraction of university<lb/> researchers receive substantial funding in addition to this (<ref type="biblio">Benner and Öquist, 2014</ref>). Moreover, a public<lb/> consultation on the findings of a recent report on the funding of higher education and research -conducted<lb/> by an expert group which was commissioned by the government in 2014 to review the system -showed<lb/> that a majority of university-colleges (and some universities) are in favour of reform to the &quot; basic &quot;<lb/> component of the funding model. Specifically, they favour the adoption of a formula-based approach using<lb/> a mapping of activities to costs (a view not shared by the government, as discussed below) (<ref type="biblio">Expert<lb/> Group, 2015</ref>). Some institutions argued, for instance, that the current funding model is inflexible and<lb/> outdated, failing to adjust to the increased complexity and importance of goals of these institutions. In<lb/> addition, given the increased time devoted to research in the &quot; new &quot; universities, it is argued that the<lb/> amount designated for research in the basic component of the funding should be increased for these<lb/> universities, aligning it more closely to that for the older ones. At present, former university-colleges that<lb/> have received a university status are still funded in a broadly similar way as university-colleges (<ref type="biblio">Reichert<lb/> and Ekholm, 2009</ref>). There are also questions about the transparency of the elements of the basic funding;<lb/> for instance, the infrastructure portion is said to vary enormously across institutions. To an extent, this<lb/> reflects that the older universities generally own and manage their properties, while the &quot; new &quot; universities<lb/> and university-colleges rent their buildings.<lb/> As for the impact of the funding system on higher education outcomes, the expert group notes an<lb/> overall increase in production of study credits over the past 10 years (<ref type="biblio">Expert Group, 2015</ref>). This, however,<lb/> is mainly due to an increase in the student numbers rather than an increase in their performance (i.e. a rise<lb/> in the number of credits per student per year). Around 35% of Norwegian students still do not finish their<lb/> degree within the expected time (<ref type="figure">Figure 8</ref>). It appears, therefore, that current incentives still make it<lb/> attractive for institutions to focus on producing credits rather than on course completion.<lb/> In terms of research, the expert group on funding concluded that the 2002 reform prompted an<lb/> increase in the number of scientific publications and doctoral candidates, but it did not bring about a major<lb/> increase in the quality of research (<ref type="biblio">Expert Group, 2015</ref>). As mentioned earlier, inward looking<lb/> management practices or administrative barriers may provide some explanation (OECD, 2009a; <ref type="biblio">Benner<lb/> and Öquist, 2014</ref>). The fixed-limit budget envelope for research incentives (unlike the open budget for<lb/> education incentives) under the current funding system (Box 3) may also impact on outcomes. The<lb/> Productivity Commission suggests political intervention in the allocation of research funds may be<lb/> diminishing the efficiency of resource allocation (PC, 2015).<lb/></p>

			<figure>Box 3. Funding arrangements for higher education institutions<lb/> Higher education institutions in Norway are funded directly by the Ministry of Education and Research. The funding<lb/> aims to cover most of the costs necessary for the running of the institutions. Following international trends, Norway<lb/> introduced a performance-based component to funding in the early 2000s and this basic structure has been retained<lb/> since then. A main goal of the 2002 reform was to increase student progression and improve quality (NMER, 2005).<lb/></figure>

			<p>The university funding system comprises a block grant with three components, which each vary from year to year and<lb/> differ in importance between institutions (<ref type="table">Table 1</ref>), reflecting the division of labour between more research-based<lb/> universities and more teaching-based university-colleges (<ref type="biblio">Reichert and Ekholm, 2009</ref>). Specifically:<lb/></p>

			<p> The &quot; basic component &quot; , covers on average 70% of the total allocation and is based on the institution&apos;s historical<lb/> budget level. The allocated amount covers funding for core tasks education (including teaching), operation and<lb/> maintenance of premises, and research and innovation. One &quot; plus &quot; of this type of allocation is that it provides<lb/> stability and predictability (OECD, 2008b), however there are drawbacks too (see text).<lb/>  The &quot; education component &quot; , covers on average 24% of the grant to institutions and is based on study credit<lb/> points (ECTS credits) obtained by students at the institutions and international mobility (student exchange). The<lb/> budget for education incentives is open-ended and aims to provide an incentive to universities and<lb/> university-colleges to offer education of high international quality.<lb/>  The &quot; research component &quot; , covers on average around 6% of the grant to institutions and is granted on the basis<lb/> of the number of publications, PhD-graduates, ability to obtain funding from the EU research programmes, and<lb/> ability to obtain funding from the Research Council of Norway. Funding for research incentives is based on a<lb/> fixed-limit budget.<lb/></p>

			<p>The expert group report also underscored the fact that the current funding system does not promote<lb/> differentiation in institutional profiles, as it provides similar incentives for all institutions (<ref type="biblio">Expert Group,<lb/> 2015; Hedda, 2015</ref>). However, the expert group concluded that concerns that the funding system prompts<lb/> excessive bias towards inexpensive courses at the expense of, for example, natural sciences, or that it<lb/> generates grade inflation were not well founded (however, the report does express concern about the<lb/> differences in grading practices between institutions).<lb/> In light of its assessment, the expert group recommended maintaining the basic structure of the<lb/> current financing structure, but with some new features and parametric adjustments (<ref type="biblio">Expert Group, 2015</ref>).<lb/> In particular the group suggested, among others:<lb/>  Introduction of a funding mechanism based on multi-year performance agreements ( &quot; contracts &quot; )<lb/> between the Ministry of Education and Research and each higher education institution, aiming to<lb/> incentivise differentiation and quality improvement. The three main elements of such agreements<lb/> are the development of quality in education and research, the development of collaboration with<lb/> industry and society, and the development of institutional profiles (<ref type="biblio">Hedda, 2015</ref>). The &quot; contracts &quot;<lb/> would be valid for 3-4 years and a portion (probably 5%) of the &quot; basic &quot; component of the block<lb/> grant to an institution would be linked to them.<lb/>  Changes to the calculation of the performance-related component of funding:<lb/>  On the education dimension, introduction of an indicator reflecting the number of graduates,<lb/> alongside the existing indicator of student credits (the latter would continue to be the most<lb/> important part of the performance-based funding). The report also recommends changes in<lb/> the field specific per credit bonus in favour of laboratory and equipment intensive fields.<lb/> Moreover, the expert group report suggests strengthening incentives for international<lb/> exchange of students (mobility indicator).<lb/>  On the research side, the report notably suggests adjustments that increase incentives to<lb/> attract EU funding and for high-impact publications and publications based on national and<lb/> international co-operation.<lb/></p>

			<p>The recommendations of the expert group, along with the outcomes of public consultation on the<lb/> report, have been examined by the government. The government is particularly supportive of a system of<lb/> multi-year performance agreements and will have a dialogue with the higher education institutions on the<lb/> design of such agreements. It will retain the two main components of the current funding model -the<lb/> &quot; basic &quot; and &quot; performance-based &quot; components -with plans to increase the latter over time (Government of<lb/> <ref type="biblio">Norway, 2015a</ref>). On the other hand, no changes are envisaged in the &quot; basic &quot; component of the current<lb/> system, despite proposals by several institutions during the public consultation for a formula-based basic<lb/> funding that would allow for a mapping of current activities and their cost assessment (see above). In the<lb/> authorities&apos; view (which provides support to the expert group&apos;s recommendation) a formula-based structure<lb/> using national rates for various activities would not be appropriate to fund a diverse sector, as such rates<lb/> would have to reflect averages. Moreover, such structure could bear on institutions&apos; internal allocation of<lb/> funds to the extent that these average national rates were perceived as normative (<ref type="biblio">Expert Group, 2015</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<p>Steps towards a funding system that promotes more efficiency and quality in higher education and<lb/> research are welcome. Envisaged changes to the performance-based component of funding to strengthen<lb/> incentives in key areas such as study completion go in the right direction. The new indicator on graduates,<lb/> for example, proposed in the 2016 national budget, would be expected to reinforce current incentives for<lb/> completion in the system linked to credit-production indicator, but the impact would need to be monitored<lb/> and evaluated. Enhanced incentives for increasing international exchange of students, announced in the<lb/> 2016 budget, are also welcome given the importance of mobility of highly educated individuals to<lb/> knowledge circulation (OECD, 2015). Norway still ranks relatively low in terms of the share of<lb/> international students enrolled in tertiary education (<ref type="figure">Figure 16</ref>). The government also envisages<lb/> strengthening research incentives through changes in the calculation method of publication points<lb/> (rewarding to a larger extent national and international co-operation), an open-ended budget for the number<lb/> of doctoral graduates, and a new indicator for external funding -public and private – received by the higher<lb/> education institutions. Changes in incentives for study completion, aimed directly at higher education<lb/> students (rather than institutions), are also under consideration (see below).<lb/></p>

			<p>The funding system could also be used towards other aspects of higher-education policy. Funding<lb/> mechanisms could, for example, provide differentiated rewards to institutions for successful study<lb/> outcomes for particular groups of students, such as immigrants. This could help address social differences<lb/> in higher education, as noted by the 2009 OECD Tertiary Education Review of Norway (OECD, 2009a).<lb/> Differentiated rewards could also be considered for specific courses that provide skills closely linked to<lb/> labour market needs, such as certain subjects within the STEM disciplines, or nursing and teaching<lb/> qualifications, by assigning a greater weight in the student-credit completions and graduations for these<lb/> courses. This would make the system more responsive to changing needs. Building in graduate labour<lb/> market outcomes to providers&apos; funding formulae could also be considered.<lb/> The expert group&apos;s proposal for some funding to be allocated based on multi-annual performance<lb/> agreements ( &quot; contracts &quot; ) is a sound idea. If designed properly, such agreements have the potential to<lb/> provide incentives to institutions to strengthen their areas of comparative advantage, quality, and<lb/> interactions with business and community. These are difficult objectives to achieve through<lb/> performance-based indicators in a formula-based system that is identical for the entire sector<lb/> (<ref type="biblio">Expert Group, 2015</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<p>, and the Netherlands, that have used<lb/> performance agreements to principally establish or maintain a diversified higher education system, suggest<lb/> that these agreements can indeed work well (<ref type="biblio">de Boer and Jongbloed, 2014</ref>). Benefits not only arise from<lb/> the agreements themselves, but also because the process of reaching agreement improves dialogue between<lb/> the government and institutions and can increase transparency and accountability of tertiary providers<lb/> (depending on the extent to which the negotiations and/or agreements are made public). However, success<lb/> is not guaranteed. For instance, in Germany performance agreements have been rather similar across<lb/> institutions and have not led to greater diversity and specialisation (<ref type="biblio">de Boer and Jongbloed, 2014</ref>). Clear<lb/> targets for the institutions concerned, with rewards only upon the achievement of results, are one ingredient<lb/> to successful performance contracts. In addition, such agreements should not limit institutions&apos; academic<lb/> autonomy and flexibility through detailed requirements or increase administrative burdens (<ref type="biblio">Expert Group,<lb/> 2015</ref>). Engaging higher education institutions in the design of performance agreements, as envisaged by<lb/> the government, should help guard against this.<lb/> It would be also important, from cost-effectiveness and quality points of view, to introduce<lb/> mechanisms to ensure that weak study or research programmes are not renewed. Regular evaluations of the<lb/> funding system for higher education are essential in this regard. At present, however, there are no<lb/> sufficiently solid data on learning outcomes and quality improvements upon which to base such<lb/> evaluations, but steps towards to this end (discussed below) are underway. These are welcome and should<lb/> continue.<lb/></p>

			<head>Improving students incentives for timely study completion<lb/></head>

			<p>Relatively high subsidies (both explicit and implicit) to students taking tertiary education courses do<lb/> not appear to have encouraged timely study completion. In addition, they are costly to the taxpayer. One<lb/> way to see if this public spending is efficient is to examine the internal rate of return to education (<ref type="biblio">Santiago<lb/> et al., 2008</ref>). The OECD provides estimates of both public and private monetary rates of return per<lb/> individual obtaining tertiary education using a net present value approach based on investment theory<lb/> (<ref type="biblio">Cheung et al., 2012; OECD, 2014a</ref>). Ideally, the value of non-monetary social benefits, such as greater<lb/> overall life satisfaction, should be taken into account in the calculations, but these are difficult to quantify.<lb/> Based on the OECD calculations, the returns to tertiary education, both the public and private ones, are<lb/> lower in Norway than in most other countries, especially for men (<ref type="figure">Figure 17</ref>, Panels A and B). However,<lb/> private returns to tertiary education are still sizeable.<lb/> ECO/WKP(2016)9<lb/></p>

			<figure>Figure 17. Internal rate of return of a person attaining tertiary education¹<lb/> As compared with a person attaining upper secondary or post-secondary non-tertiary education, in equivalent USD<lb/> converted using PPPs for GDP<lb/> The internal rate of return indicates at what real interest rate the investment breaks even. 2011 data.<lb/> Source: OECD (2015), Education at a Glance 2015, Tables A7.3a, A7.3b, A7.4a and A7.4b.<lb/></figure>

			<p>In many countries the costs of tertiary education are shared between government and students through<lb/> tuition fees (and also through the progressivity of the personal income tax) (<ref type="biblio">Santiago et al., 2008; OECD,<lb/> 2012b</ref>). A common justification for such fees is that individuals benefit financially from tertiary education<lb/> because it gives them access to better-paid jobs and so, in the interest of fairness, students ought to<lb/> contribute to the cost. Also, a suitably constructed system of tuition fees (accompanied by a scheme of<lb/> income-contingent repayment of loans to overcome concerns about access to tertiary education) could<lb/> improve efficiency and quality by encouraging timely completions and increasing students&apos; expectations<lb/> for value for money, while making them more receptive to market signals (OECD, 2014b, 2014c). In<lb/> addition, tuition charges can widen the sources of funding for institutions, and can provide incentives to<lb/> institutions to respond better to students&apos; and labour market&apos;s demands and provide higher quality<lb/> education (<ref type="biblio">OECD, 2008a, 2009a, 2011</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<p>There have been successful transitions to fee systems. However, there are pitfalls. Knowing that<lb/> students have comparatively easy access to loans and grants to pay tuition fees can prompt providers to<lb/> ramp up the supply of courses, with little regard for course quality, and this may require additional<lb/> mechanisms. The US Gainful Employment regulations, for example, aim to ensure that institutions improve<lb/> their outcomes for students, or risk losing access to federal student aid (U.S Department of Education,<lb/> 2014). Also, tuition fees&apos; role in helping guide student choices can be weakened if (as is often the case)<lb/> institutions set fees at the same level across most of the courses they offer (typical exceptions being<lb/> medicine and performing arts) and, similarly, if there is little differentiation of fees across institutions.<lb/> A number of special factors militate against the introduction of tuition fees in the Norwegian context.<lb/> The relatively high degree of wage compression in Norway, as in other Nordic countries (<ref type="figure">Figure 18</ref>), can<lb/> reduce incentives to invest in higher education, justifying to an extent the large public subsidies to tertiary<lb/> education (OECD, 2010, 2014a). Also, the Nordic social welfare function places a high value on free and<lb/> inclusive education and on delinking support for young adults from their parents&apos; finances, which make the<lb/> introduction of tuition and targeting support based on parents&apos; income politically difficult.<lb/></p>

			<p>However, there is room for policy initiatives regarding the loan-based support for students&apos; living<lb/> expenses. Indeed, adjustment to this support has already been used to encourage more timely completion of<lb/> studies. Changes made in the early 2000s included the introduction of a mechanism allowing up to 40% of<lb/> student loan to be converted into a grant subject to academic progress (Box 4). However, according to<lb/> experts this did not significantly reduce study delays (<ref type="biblio">Opheim, 2011</ref>). This may reflect the fact that other<lb/> factors than financial incentives might weigh more on completions (such as the relative low participation<lb/> cost to tertiary education in the absence of tuition fees) and/or design issues of the financial incentives. For<lb/> example, the reform has increased the income threshold before the amount of grant is reduced, providing<lb/> incentives for work perhaps at the expense of study time (<ref type="biblio">Opheim, 2011</ref>). A previous reform rewarding for<lb/> on-time completion (known as &quot; turbo &quot; reform) appeared to be more effective, although comparison of the<lb/> two incentive schemes is difficult. The reform provided for a reduction of around 10% of the total loan<lb/> amount for students who completed certain graduate programmes between 1990 and 1995 within a certain<lb/> timeframe. According to <ref type="biblio">Gunnes et al. (2011)</ref>, the turbo scheme resulted in an increase of about 10% in<lb/> students who graduated in stipulated time. The reform reduced delays of studies by 0.23 semesters per year<lb/> treated (<ref type="biblio">Gunnes, et al., 2013</ref>).<lb/></p>

Student financial support<lb/></table>

			<p>Norwegian students (and under certain conditions, some foreign students) are entitled to financial support from<lb/> the State Education Loan Fund for a maximum of 10 months per year (which will increase gradually from 10 to 11<lb/> months until 2020) and for a maximum of 8 years. The financial support amounted to NOK 97 850 (around EUR 10<lb/> 600, assuming an exchange rate of 9.2) in academic year 2014-15. The support is meant to cover costs of living, as<lb/> there are no tuition fees at public institutions. Students enrolled in private institutions may also apply for additional<lb/> loans to cover the costs of fees. Around 90% of students take up the loans (Opheim, 2011).<lb/> Key aspects of the student support system are as follows:<lb/></p>

			<p> Students initially receive support as a loan but part of this loan can be converted into a grant (in effect the<lb/> loan is partially written off) conditional on:<lb/> a) Criteria relating to study progression (this dimension was introduced in the 2002 reform). As a main rule,<lb/> 40% of loans are transformed to grants upon completion of semesters. Students are still entitled however<lb/> for government support for up to one year&apos;s delayed study progression (<ref type="biblio">Opheim, 2011</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<head>b</head>

			<p>) Student&apos;s income and assets (notably parental income does not play a role). Most notably there is an<lb/> income threshold beyond which the conversion to grant is reduced.<lb/></p>

			<head>c)</head>

			<p>Whether students live with their parents or not; only students living away are eligible for the grants (those<lb/> living with parents are eligible for student loans only). This appears to be a powerful driver of student<lb/> choices, only around 10% of students are reported to be living with their parents.<lb/></p>

			<head></head>

			<figure>Loans are interest-free and no repayment is required before the completion of studies. Loan repayments<lb/> are calculated on the basis of 20-years repayment on a flat-rate basis.<lb/></figure>

			<p>The government is currently considering the recommendations from the Productivity Commission<lb/> (<ref type="biblio">PC, 2015</ref>) and the expert group on the higher education funding (<ref type="biblio">Expert Group, 2015</ref>) regarding an<lb/> additional incentive to students for completion of all degrees (besides the incentives planned for higher<lb/> education institutions, as discussed above). Given the evidence, further experimentation with &quot; turbo &quot; type<lb/> incentives (see above) in student-loan support, aiming to improve study completion, certainly seems<lb/> worthwhile. Student support could also be better linked to study requirements with a differentiation of the<lb/> length of support, according to the standard duration of the courses. Other policy goals might also be<lb/> achieved (at least partially) through further tweaks to the loan-support system, perhaps along the lines<lb/> already in place that partially write off loans for students attending certain teacher training programs<lb/> (STEM and foreign languages) and for graduate doctors who work in the northern counties. Discounts on<lb/> loan repayment or grant conversions could be offered for students taking courses that are seen as having<lb/> particularly high returns to the general public, such as certain subjects within the STEM disciplines and<lb/> some professions where demand for graduates is likely to increase rapidly (long-term projections suggest<lb/> this may be the case for nurses, for example); though selecting which subjects to support needs careful<lb/> attention. Of course, the private return to education also depends strongly on wage prospects. In this<lb/> context, Norway&apos;s narrow wage distribution has some bearing on student choices. Needless to say,<lb/> uncertainties in the outcomes of reforming the financial incentives for students means any such changes<lb/> should be carefully monitored and evaluated.<lb/></p>

			<p>To reduce delayed completions it may also be necessary to increase higher education admission<lb/> standards, which would make it more difficult for students with a low probability of completion to enter<lb/> the system (PC, 2015). As mentioned earlier, PIAAC data show that a relatively high share of 20-34<lb/> year-old tertiary graduates has low literacy levels, although Norway fares better than the OECD average in<lb/> this regard (<ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref>). Plans by the government to strengthen admission requirements for applicants to<lb/> science studies and teacher training education in science, as well as to bachelor programmes in nursing and<lb/> journalist education are welcome in this regard, and should be implemented. A previous Economic Survey<lb/> (OECD, 2008a) identified insufficient competence at entry to tertiary education as another potential reason<lb/> behind the long duration of tertiary studies.<lb/> Ensuring good communication and data to help prospective students make informed choices is<lb/> particularly important in Norway. Indeed, informing educational choices is one of the main skills<lb/> challenges according to the OECD Skills Strategy for Norway (OECD, 2014c). Easily accessible databases<lb/> to students on courses&apos; outcomes, in terms of career and income prospects, and professional career<lb/> guidance services, would facilitate more informed choices and contribute to higher completion rates.<lb/> Making good use of existing data on labour-market trends would also help. Career guidance and<lb/> counselling services are particularly important to address the information gap for students that come from<lb/> disadvantaged backgrounds as such students often underestimate the net benefits of tertiary education<lb/> (OECD, 2009a). A committee was appointed in 2015 by the government to investigate how the lifelong<lb/> career guidance can be strengthened. It is due to report in the course of 2016.<lb/></p>

			<head>Monitoring quality in the tertiary education sector<lb/></head>

			<p>Mechanisms that monitor outcomes and respond to poor performance are critical for improving the<lb/> quality of tertiary education. The establishment of the Norwegian Agency for Quality Assurance in<lb/> Education (NOKUT) in the early 2000s, and legal requirements for tertiary education providers to run<lb/> internal quality assurance systems (which are audited by NOKUT), had a positive impact on the<lb/> &quot; institutional quality culture &quot; , according to the</p>

			<table>2009 Review of Tertiary Education (OECD, 2009a)<lb/> (Box 5).<lb/></table>

			<p>A recent evaluation report concludes that NOKUT complies with the majority of European Standards<lb/> and Guidelines for quality assurance in higher education, but does highlight some areas for improvement<lb/> (NOKUT, 2013c). In particular, NOKUT was advised to further strengthen auditing, as at present the<lb/> design of audit process and criteria allow &quot; room for interpretation &quot; ; and, to introduce &quot; follow-ups of<lb/> recommendations &quot; in evaluation reports (NOKUT, 2013c). Also, the evaluation concluded that NOKUT&apos;s<lb/> current legal and regulatory framework hampers adjustments to the existing quality assurance framework,<lb/> and hence innovation. NOKUT has limited powers to alter the quality assurance framework without a<lb/> lengthy process of coordination with the Ministry of Education and Research and the need for an approval<lb/> from the government and parliament. Requirements that result in disproportionate time and resources spent<lb/> on the evaluation of small institutions, which cater only few students, compared to the large ones, are<lb/> indicative of these rigidities (NOKUT, 2013c), even though parliamentary procedures allow for enhanced<lb/> scrutiny of legislative instruments.<lb/> Moreover, the accreditation process was found to have an impact on the higher education landscape<lb/> (NOKUT, 2013c). This is reflected, according to the evaluation report, in the increased number of new<lb/> institutions in the sector and the university-colleges that acquired a university status through such process.<lb/> Since the early 2000s there was a doubling in the number of universities (from 4 in 2003 to 8 in 2012), and<lb/> more institutions have aspirations for university status (NOKUT, 2013b). In addition, new providers grew<lb/> fast, as did the number of new advanced programmes in university-colleges, with more than 100 master&apos;s<lb/> programmes and around 30 doctoral ones having been accredited by NOKUT in these institutions between<lb/> 2003 and 2012 (NOKUT, 2013b).<lb/></p>

			<head>Box 5. Quality assurance mechanisms for tertiary education<lb/></head>

			<p>The Norwegian Agency for Quality Assurance in Education (NOKUT) was established under the Quality<lb/> Reform in Higher education in 2002 and is funded fully by the state and regulated by the Ministry of Education and<lb/> Research (<ref type="biblio">Campbell et al., 2015</ref>). The agency is responsible for the accreditation (of institutions and study<lb/> programmes) and quality assessment (audit of internal quality assurance systems) for higher education, as well as<lb/> tertiary vocational education. It also assesses foreign higher education institutions. Higher education institutions in<lb/> Norway also have a role in quality assurance as they are legally required to develop their own quality assurance<lb/> systems – audited by NOKUT.<lb/> Accreditation is based on ex ante evaluation with unlimited periods of validity: once granted to the institution<lb/> the accreditation lasts until explicitly revoked following an assessment (<ref type="biblio">Campbell et al., 2015</ref>). There is a hierarchy<lb/> in accreditation of study programmes. Universities have a self-accrediting status, that is they can decide freely on<lb/> the study programmes to offer, at all levels, without the need to apply to NOKUT for accreditation, while accredited<lb/> university-colleges have to apply for the accreditation for programmes at master&apos;s and doctoral levels (apart from<lb/> specific cases) and specialised universities for programmes outside their field (again apart from specific cases).<lb/> Non-accredited university-colleges must apply to NOKUT for all study programmes (<ref type="biblio">Reichert and Ekholm, 2009</ref>).<lb/> There is also an accreditation control process to protect against potential abuse of the granted powers. This is<lb/> carried out by NOKUT through two external quality assurance processes: ad hoc revisions of an institution or<lb/> programme that may result in a withdrawal of the previously granted accreditation, and cyclical audits of institutions&apos;<lb/> internal quality assurance systems, which are conducted every 6 years (the maximum). Institutions that fail to meet<lb/> such criteria in terms of internal quality assurance lose their right (if themselves are accrediting organisations) to<lb/> establish new study programmes, or to apply for accreditation of new study programmes (in the case of non-<lb/>accredited institutions) (<ref type="biblio">Campbell et al., 2015</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<head>Changing requirements for accreditation and the establishment of advanced research programmes<lb/></head>

			<p>The government plans to tighten the requirements for an institution to apply for accreditation as a specialised<lb/> university and university and for creating programmes at master&apos;s and doctoral levels (Government of Norway,<lb/> 2015a). Specifically, the plans include the following proposals:<lb/></p>

			<p> To qualify as a specialised university, an institution must document an enrolment of at least 15 students per<lb/> doctoral programme over time. Institutions opting for a university status must document that at least two of<lb/> their doctoral programmes have an average graduation of 5 candidates per year over a 3-year period; while<lb/> those seeking to become a specialised university have to prove that the doctoral programme they offer has an<lb/> average graduation of 5 candidates per year over a 3-year period.<lb/></p>

			<p> Accreditation to university status should continue to be subject to offering doctoral degree programmes in four<lb/> subjects, but in addition such programmes should also cover the institution&apos;s main areas of academic activities<lb/> and not only a part of them. In the case of application for accreditation as a specialised university, the<lb/> applicant institution must prove that the doctoral programme covers its main academic areas.<lb/> The government plans to initiate a process, in consultation with NOKUT and the Research Council of Norway,<lb/> to strengthen the requirements for the establishment of master&apos;s and doctoral programmes. Following the<lb/> transitional period, the Ministry will consider whether institutions that offer four master&apos;s programmes may be able to<lb/> self-accredit new master&apos;s programmes.<lb/></p>

			<p>These developments raise questions about diversity. Taking stock of the dynamics in the Norwegian<lb/> tertiary education sector in recent years, NOKUT (2013b) concludes that the profile of programmes<lb/> broadened in each institution, increasing diversity within institutions, while institutional profiles became in<lb/> many ways more similar, reducing diversity between institutions. As discussed above, much of the reduced<lb/> inter-institutional diversity is the result of &quot; academic drift &quot; arising from new universities and university-<lb/>colleges moving into academic subject areas (and research areas) that have traditionally been the domain of<lb/> the older universities (though there has also been some movement in the opposite direction with traditional<lb/> universities branching into vocational courses). Large differences remain between the old universities, the<lb/> new universities and the university-colleges (<ref type="biblio">Bakken and Storm, 2012</ref>); the portfolios of the new<lb/> universities continue to be dominated by traditional professional programmes, such as teaching and nursing<lb/> and relatively fewer students in master&apos;s degree programmes (NOKUT, 2013b). However, if this academic<lb/> drift continues in the future, institutional diversity needs to be closely monitored and safeguarded,<lb/> especially regarding the educational opportunities with a more vocational orientation that might become<lb/> more academically demanding (NOKUT, 2013b). Moreover, there are concerns that such drift, while<lb/> providing academic development, can lead to the creation of too many small institutions offering master&apos;s<lb/> and doctoral programmes, with a potential adverse impact on quality. The merger process (see above) may<lb/> help reduce this risk.<lb/> The government plans to tighten the requirements for accreditation as a specialised university or a<lb/> university, making the upgrading of the status dependent on required minimum enrolments and graduations<lb/> in the institution&apos;s doctoral programme(s), and also on the extent that such programmes cover the key areas<lb/> of the institution&apos;s academic activities (Box 5). Tighter criteria for establishing master&apos;s-and doctoral-level<lb/> programmes are also envisaged, with the aim of increasing their scope and academic credentials<lb/> (Government of Norway, 2015a). In addition, NOKUT&apos;s supervision of existing educational programmes<lb/> will be strengthened.<lb/></p>

			<p>The envisaged changes go in right direction. It is important that the accreditation process, giving the<lb/> opportunity to institutions to apply for a higher status, is based on comprehensive and clear criteria of<lb/> academic performance. Tighter criteria for the establishment of advanced research programmes will also<lb/> help quality. A close monitoring of the impact of the new conditions is important.<lb/></p>

			<p>Beyond the current proposals, harmonisation of quality control of doctoral programmes across<lb/> institutions should also be on the agenda. The Research Council of Norway highlights, in this context, the<lb/> lack of guidance on the length of such programmes, as well as of the monitoring of completion rates<lb/> (RCN, 2011). To this end, the Council recommends the introduction of a national system to enforce and<lb/> maintain the quality of doctoral degrees.<lb/> Also, enhancements in performance indicators are essential for better monitoring quality<lb/> improvements in tertiary education. The requirement for the institutions to produce a yearly report and<lb/> provide data on completions and other performance indicators is welcome in this regard. The authorities<lb/> should expedite initiatives to improve information on learning outcomes. NOKUT is already conducting an<lb/> annual national student survey and experiments with national exams in selected courses, as well as<lb/> developing joint evaluations of research and educational activities in collaboration with the Research<lb/> Council of Norway. Plans also include an internet portal of quality indicators and a survey of employers&apos;<lb/> assessment of education quality (Government of Norway, 2015a).<lb/> While the moves currently underway to improve the quality of tertiary education certainly head in the<lb/> right direction, this is a policy area requiring ongoing campaigns and initiatives. In light of this it is<lb/> welcome that a White Paper on the quality of education is planned, with publication envisaged in<lb/> spring 2017.<lb/></p>

			<head>Recommendations on addressing the challenges in higher education<lb/></head>

			<p>Ensure that the higher education system promotes efficiency and quality through successful mergers, effective<lb/> governance, well-designed financial incentives to institutions for student progress and effective monitoring<lb/> mechanisms. In particular:<lb/></p>

			<p> Continue to promote mergers among higher education institutions. Ensure partner institutions are carefully<lb/> selected and provide adequate and sufficiently flexible financial support during the merging process.<lb/></p>

			<head></head>

			<figure>Monitor closely the impact of the mergers on efficacy and quality in higher education and research.<lb/>  As proposed by the government, encourage institutions to adopt a governance model that entails an<lb/> external chairman and an appointed rector.<lb/>  Pursue plans to include the graduation rates in the formula for performance-based funding.<lb/>  Consider introducing differentiated rewards to institutions via the funding system for particular groups of<lb/> students, such as immigrants, and for those courses that are linked closer to labour market needs.<lb/>  Develop multi-annual performance agreements between the government and each higher education<lb/> institution.<lb/>  Terminate funding for weak study or research programmes.<lb/>  Tighten requirements for institutional accreditation and the establishment of master&apos;s-and doctoral-level<lb/> programmes.<lb/>  Continue to improve data and dissemination via mechanisms such as the annual national student survey,<lb/> and the development of a portal of quality indicators.<lb/> As regards financial support for students:<lb/></figure>

			<p> Further target incentives and financial support to students who complete their courses on time. In particular,<lb/> consider an additional reward on the completion of degrees or linking the length of support to the standard<lb/> duration of courses.<lb/></p>

			<p> Steer student choices, for instance, via loan discounts for subjects with high demand.</p>
