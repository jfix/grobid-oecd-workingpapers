INTRODUCTION Patent data provide an increasingly used means to analyse innovation performance worldwide 
including in countries with incomplete data coverage, such as some developing countries. This paper 
focuses on the construction of indicators and analytical methodologies for measuring innovation in 
climate-and other environment-related technologies. A companion paper discusses the use of such 
indicators for policy purposes (see Haščič and Migotto 2015). More generally, there is a growing demand for analysis of patenting and innovation performance 
worldwide including in countries with incomplete data coverage, such as some developing countries 
(see e.g., Collier and Venables 2012; Belward et al. 2011; Barton 2007). However, past analyses have 
not properly taken into account the varying geographic coverage of patent databases (including those 
by the authors of this paper). This paper builds on the first attempts to reflect upon this issue in Haščič 
et al. (2012). Although the sources of idiosyncrasy are discussed in the context of the EPO's 
PATSTAT database, similar approaches could be used to mitigate biases arising out of other patent 
databases. In addition, patent data are increasingly used for international comparisons and analysis in 
relatively 'narrow' fields of technology, such as many environment-related technologies (see e.g. 
OECD 2011, 2012; Dechezleprêtre et al. 2011). However, achieving both comparability across 
countries and representativity within a country (statistical robustness) creates additional challenges. 
Although several approaches have been developed to improve cross-country comparability of patent 
statistics, these are not always suitable for such analyses – either because they require additional data 
that might not be available in all countries or because they impose restrictions that are less appropriate 
for analysis of narrow technological fields. The simultaneity of these two conditions – narrow 
technological scope and comparability across a wide range of countries – often renders many existing 
indicators inapt for such analyses. This paper first discusses why different patent indicators might be more or less suitable to 
achieve the two objectives simultaneously. It then advocates the use of indicators based on patent 
family size that are more flexible and can be adapted for such applications, provided that certain 
idiosyncratic characteristics of patent databases are addressed. The following section discusses in 
detail these idiosyncratic characteristics of patent databases that are of general relevance (unequal 
country and temporal coverage of patent databases, asymmetric information on designation of member 
states in regional and PCT applications) as well as those that are of relevance particularly for narrow 
technological fields (missing information, identification of relevant patent documents). The paper 
proposes approaches to mitigating potential biases arising out of such idiosyncrasies – both in 
construction of patent statistics (treatment of underlying data) as well as in empirical analyses that use 
such statistics. In particular, it advocates the use of a robust control variable (e.g. TOTPAT) for cross-
country analyses of narrow technological fields. All methodological issues discussed here and 
examples provided are based on the PATSTAT database, but could be applied to patent databases 
more generally. The Use of Patent Statistics for International Comparisons and Analysis of Narrow Technological Fields OECD SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY AND INDUSTRY WORKING PAPERS 6 2. 
ADAPTING PATENT INDICATORS TO DIFFERENT CONTEXTS Many of the existing patent indicators, including counts of patent applications registered at a 
given national or regional patent office, Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) applications, or the triadic 
patent family (TPF) indicator, have one or both of the following shortcomings: i) either they are not 
suitable for international comparisons; and/or b) they are less suitable for analysis of narrow 
technological fields. The joint existence of two requirements on the indicators – comparability across 
countries and statistical robustness – often renders these indicators inappropriate for many 
applications. The reasons range from a home bias in national and regional filings, differences in 
propensities to use the PCT route (a special type of a home bias) 1 , to an overly restrictive quality 
threshold applied precisely to address cross-country differences in patent quality (such as the TPF). 
Moreover, much of the complementary data that is commonly used to assess patent value (e.g. citation 
data) are currently available only in a very limited number of countries. To illustrate the differences, Figures 1-3 give examples of alternative patent indicators for 
technological fields of different 'thickness' and for different geographical scales. Four alternative 
indicators are shown – PCT applications, TPF applications,  " claimed priorities "  (equivalent to patent 
family size>=2, or PF2) and all priorities (equivalent to patent family size>=1, or PF1). 2 Given our reliance upon data obtained from a source which does not include the full population 
of patented inventions within a given field (see below) we do not have any external measure against 
which we can assess which statistic is optimal. However, in order to assess the reliability of the use of 
alternative statistics as indicators of inventive activity, and their suitability for empirical analysis it is 
interesting to compare: a) the degree of correlation between alternative measures; b) the extent of 
variation within fields over time and across countries; and, c) the presence of zero values. To measure inventive activity worldwide in relatively 'thick' fields – several of the indicators 
seem satisfactory (for instance, see renewable energy and water pollution abatement in Figure 1). The 
different measures are highly correlated, and at the country-level the variation is 'plausible "  for most 
countries. The situation changes with a focus on narrower technological fields (e.g. wind power, 
geothermal energy) which compromises performance of the most restrictive versions of these 
indicators. For example, in the case of geothermal energy, the frequency of zero counts is so high that 
it limits the information value of the TPF indicator (Figure 1). These problems are accentuated when the geographic scope is reduced. Focusing on individual 
countries results in high frequency of zero counts for all but the largest inventor countries (Figures 2-
3) Indeed, even for thick fields some of the more restrictive counts (e.g. TPF and PF2) give relatively 
low variation at the country level (Figures 2 and 3). In general, PF2 seems as a suitable compromise between comparability (quality threshold) and 
practicality (variance), except for very narrow technological fields or small inventor countries – in 
which case PF1 might be the only option. In sum, while restricting patent family size is a useful way to impose a certain quality threshold 
across countries (Dernis et al. 2001), the TPF condition of a specific EP-US-JP triad (Dernis and Khan 
2004) is overly restrictive and potentially biased for the contexts discussed here. In such cases, it 
might be better to relax this restriction and instead adjust it depending on the application. While for 
some applications no restriction will be the only option (PF1), for others the dyadic (any office, or 
PF2) restriction might be feasible, and cases of particularly  " thick "  technological fields or broad 
geographic scopes will permit imposing the triadic (any office, or PF3) restriction, or higher. For these The Use of Patent Statistics for International Comparisons and Analysis of Narrow Technological Fields 7 OECD SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY AND INDUSTRY WORKING PAPERS reasons, this paper advocates the use of a range of patent family indicators, as a generalization of the 
TPF concept. It must be noted that PF3 differs from the TPF indicator in two respects – (i) the TPF requires a 
specific triad (EP-US-JP) while PF3 can include any triad; (ii) the TPF is based on an extended patent 
family while PF3 is based on simple patent family. It would be a natural extension of the TPF concept 
to define a  " dyadic patent family "  (DPF) indicator as a dyad, perhaps any dyad of two offices. This 
would however require addressing the problem of regional and international patent filings (see Section 
3 for a discussion). The Use of Patent Statistics for International Comparisons and Analysis of Narrow Technological Fields OECD SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY AND INDUSTRY WORKING PAPERS 8 Figure 1.

Family size >=1, any office,

activity worldwide because the 
entire stock of patent priorities is 
considered; too lax because it 
gives equal weight to low-and 
high-quality inventions; does not 
account for differences in patent 
breadth across offices. PF2 – Claimed priorities 
Family size >=2, any office, 
based on simple patent 
family. 3 A limited quality threshold suitable 
for many narrow tech fields. PF3 
Family size >=3, any office, 
based on simple patent 
family. Only high-quality inventions, but 
less restrictive than the TPF. For the purpose of international comparisons, patent statistics based on counting distinct patent 
families (patent priorities) are preferable for several reasons: (i) considering only priority applications 
(and not their duplicates) avoids double-counting – which would occur if data from multiple patent 
offices were pooled. The data is thus better suited for cross-country analysis; (ii) the data are truly 
world-wide in their coverage – and thus less subject to bias – because the entire stock of patent 
priorities is considered (see also de Rassenfosse et al. 2013). 4 In addition, a subset of these statistics – those based on counting only the 'claimed priorities' (i.e. 
patent priorities that have been 'claimed' as a priority by another patenting filing abroad) provides a 
quality threshold because priority applications which have never been claimed (singletons) are 
excluded. This helps contain concerns over low-value and strategic patenting. Counting the claimed 
priorities gives rise to the PF2 statistic (i.e. patent families with size 2 or greater). It turns out that for many applications related to environmental technologies, the PF2 restriction 
(claimed priorities) is particularly suitable in order to achieve the dual purpose of comparability and 
robustness. The count of claimed priorities (i.e. patent applications deposited at any office world-wide, 
that have been claimed as priority elsewhere in the world) is a suitable statistic for the purpose of 
international comparisons because only the priority applications protecting  " high-value "  invention are The Use of Patent Statistics for International Comparisons and Analysis of Narrow Technological Fields OECD SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY AND INDUSTRY WORKING PAPERS 12 counted. The reason that claimed priorities can be viewed as representing inventions of higher value is 
that patenting is costly (e.g. translation and maintenance fees). As such, a firm will only go abroad to 
protect its intellectual property if it expects that the commercial value of its invention justifies it. 
Previous research has shown that the number of additional patent applications (other than the priority 
application) is a good indicator of patent value (Guellec and van Pottelsberghe 2000; Harhoff et al. 
2003). The results in Guellec & van Pottelsberghe (2000) suggest that patent value increases up to 
family size of 4 (or 5), and decreases thereafter. However, few patent applications have family size 
greater than five. The use of claimed priorities based on an economic threshold criterion was advocated already by 
Faust and Schedl 1983 and Faust 1990. For example, Faust (1990) argued that by excluding priority 
applications which have never been claimed abroad (singletons) this approach will exclude the large 
number of exclusively domestic Japanese patent applications with usually only one claim. 5 Moreover, counts of claimed priorities (PF2 statistics) have the advantage that they do not suffer 
from biases due to changing publication practices at the USPTO. Prior to 2001, only grants (not 
applications) were published by the USPTO. Even after 2001, the rules allow applicants to opt-out 
from having their patent applications made public before grant (i.e. the non-publication request). 
These distinctions between grants and applications create biases in cross country comparisons when 
using the PF1 statistic. This is a limitation of using PF1 statistics compared with PF2, PF3, etc. that 
do not suffer from such bias. The downside of counting claimed priorities is the duplication lag that weighs more on indicators 
with higher minimum family size. Another potential problem for determining family size is the 
question of how to treat applications filed through the regional (EP, AP) and international (PCT) 
routes. For example, should a regional application have an equal weight as a national application (e.g. 
treating EPO as a single jurisdiction), or should it rather be taken to represent individual member 
states? In the latter case how should the individual weights be determined? 6 This is similar to the 
problem of 'nowcasting' PCT applications in international phase towards national/regional phase. And 
again, should PCT applications in national/regional phase have an equal weight as a national 
application, or should a weight be estimated? We propose a solution in Section 3.2 below. While the PF2 is indeed often a good compromise between the too restrictive TPF and the too lax 
count of all priorities (PF1), in some circumstances PF1 can be the only practical approach – e.g. for 
very narrow technological fields or for analysis requiring a high degree of spatial disaggregation. This 
approach can be generalized by allowing the analyst to choose the degree of restriction – the number 
of unique countries (patent offices) within a simple patent family – the minimum 'quality' threshold 
that still allows for sufficient variation in the measured statistic (avoids too many zeros). The choice of 
the restriction is then a function of 'scope' (narrow vs thick) of the technological field analysed, 
geographic coverage, as well as country context (propensity to protect inventions abroad). However, 
construction of a reliable indicator also requires addressing a certain number of potential pitfalls 
associated with patent databases. They are discussed next. The Use of Patent Statistics for International Comparisons and Analysis of Narrow Technological Fields 13 OECD SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY AND INDUSTRY WORKING PAPERS 3. 
IDIOSYNCRATIC ISSUES IN CONSTRUCTION AND ANALYSIS OF PATENT 
STATISTICS 3.1 
Country and temporal coverage of patent databases Analyses using patent data have typically focused on OECD countries for which data availability 
is generally satisfactory. However, the recent growing interest in developing countries raises the 
importance of idiosyncrasies arising out of unequal database coverage which often varies highly 
among countries worldwide. Accounting for such idiosyncrasies is all the more important for analyses 
that study narrow technological fields because the high level of disaggregation leads to high frequency 
of zero (or very low) counts. Ideally, one would need information on the representativeness of PATSTAT with respect to 
national registers. In the absence of such information, we use the EPO's weekly updates of the 
 " contents and coverage of the DOCDB bibliographic file "  – the DOCDB is the source database from 
which a 'snapshot' is drawn biannually and released as PATSTAT. The April 2012 release of 
PATSTAT includes batches of data provided from as many as 94 different patent offices, including all 
major patent offices worldwide. This is shown as cumulative coverage in Figure 4. However, for some 
offices the time series are incomplete and thus the contemporaneous coverage (for a given year) is 
typically somewhat lower. The apparent drop in coverage in recent years is most likely only a 
temporary phenomenon because some batches of new data are included with a lag. On-going efforts of 
the EPO to acquire historical batches of data would shift the curves upward, and bring them closer 
together. Figure 4. Contemporaneous and cumulative data coverage in PATSTAT APR12 Note: Excluding data batches for utility models or petty patents. The status of coverage in PATSTAT can be classified in four categories: (i) For 1980-2009 there 
are 39 offices with complete coverage during the entire 30-year period (e.g. JP, US, EP, IB); (ii) 
Further 16 offices have a complete coverage although defined for less than 30 years (e.g. DD, CS, 
YU) 7 ; (iii) Other 40 offices have only partial coverage of patent applications deposited in any given 
year, for instance only certain months in a year or only certain types of patent applications (e.g. AR, 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 1960

various reasons PATSTAT includes data for additional 19 offices (e.g. inclusion of data on prior art), 
meaning that there is data on an additional 129 inventor countries (Table 2). Coverage of OECD countries is generally complete, although some gaps exist, notably for Chile 
(1980-2004 and 2009 are not covered at all, 2005 and 2008 only partly). Among non-OECD countries 
it is noteworthy that countries such as Brazil, South Africa, Egypt and Russia have complete coverage. 
However, gaps in coverage exist for some other countries, such as Argentina (1995-96 are only partly 
covered), India (2007 is only partly covered, 2008-09 not at all), China (1980-84 are not covered at all, 
1985 only partly), Indonesia (1980-95 and 2002-09 are not covered at all, 1996-97 only partly) and 
Philippines (1999 only partly covered, 2000-09 not at all).

-Notes: 1 Based on TOTPAT #7 counts (singletons + claimed priorities + duplicates) 
2 Single-priority patent families, fractional counts 
3 The African Regional Intellectual Property Organisation (ARIPO) has 17 member states: Botswana, Gambia, Ghana, Kenya, Lesotho, Malawi, 
Mozambique, Namibia, Rwanda, Sierra Leone, Somalia, Sudan, Swaziland, Uganda, Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe. 
4 The Eurasian Patent Organization (EAPO) has 8 member states: Turkmenistan, Belarus, Tajikistan, Russia, Azerbaijan, Armenia, Kazakhstan and 
Kyrgyzstan. 
5 The African Intellectual Property Organisation (OAPI) has 15 member states: Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, Congo, 
Côte d'Ivoire, Gabon, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Senegal and Togo. 
6 The Patent Office of the Cooperation Council for the Arab States of the Gulf (GCC) has 6 member states: United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, 
Oman, Qatar and Kuwait. This is a wealth of information from a large number of patent offices. However, given the 
unequal coverage across countries/offices and over time, the question is how to use this body of data 
for statistical analysis. Clearly, 'raw' patent counts that do not account for the unequal coverage 
should be interpreted with caution, particularly those with emphasis on countries and time periods for 
which the coverage is incomplete. Moreover, while country coverage is an important piece of 
information to assess patenting trends in general, it is particularly so with respect to developing 
countries for whom the coverage varies most. The bias might be particularly important with respect to statistics of market protection (number of 
patent applications deposited at a national office). Implications for invention and co-invention 
indicators are less acute since some of this information can be obtained indirectly through other IP 
offices. Using coverage weights to generate more reliable patent statistics In this paper we take a step towards developing a methodology to account for differences in 
coverage. The detailed metadata described above can be used for this purpose and improve the 
reliability and representativeness of patent statistics. In particular, our intention is twofold: i) 
Identify cases when one can reliably distinguish 'true' zero counts from 'missing' values. 
As explained above, benefits of doing so are particularly high for analyses of narrow 
technological fields and of countries with low levels of patenting activity (e.g. many 
developing countries); ii) 
In cases when values are not missing, the intention is to provide an indication of reliability 
of the observed frequency counts. Again, this is important in data-poor environments, The Use of Patent Statistics for International Comparisons and Analysis of Narrow Technological Fields OECD SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY AND INDUSTRY WORKING PAPERS 18 including those of narrow technological fields or countries with relatively low levels of 
patenting activity. We use the PATSTAT metadata to develop coverage weights to accompany standard patent data 
extractions. In some sense, the weights will give the probability that the frequency counts obtained 
from PATSTAT reflect the 'true' count. For example, one can reasonably expect that if the coverage 
metadata indicate than no data batches were included in PATSTAT from patent office in country X, 
then the probability to have records of duplicates deposited at this country's office will be zero or very 
low (for singleton priorities it will indeed be zero) and for claimed priorities it will be low but non-
zero. This approach will allow choosing the minimum level of coverage that is desired or appropriate 
for a given application (i.e. it allows sample selection). First, we summarize the information provided by the EPO in the  " contents and coverage of 
DOCDB bibliographic files "  and construct a statistic that represents the fraction of a given year for 
which PATSTAT has batches of data from a given patent office, ranging between  " 0 "  (office i in year 
t not covered at all) and  " 1 "  (full coverage) (e.g. if data is available only for 3 months of a year ten 
weight=0.25). Table 3 gives the weights for offices with at least a partial coverage.

14.396 The Use of Patent Statistics for International Comparisons and Analysis of Narrow Technological Fields 23 OECD SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY AND INDUSTRY WORKING PAPERS Second, we define a set of rules to assign these  " coverage weights "  to different types of patent 
documents extracted from PATSTAT (Table 4). On the one hand, any information derived from a 
singleton patent application will be assigned a weight corresponding to the coverage of its priority 
application office. The weight is equal to the theoretical coverage of the priority application office in 
the application year. On the other hand, information derived from a family of patent applications 
(claimed priorities) is assigned a weight corresponding to maximum weight associated with the 
priority and/or duplicate application offices of corresponding family members. And finally, 
information derived from duplicate patent applications due to absence of data from the priority office 
is assigned a weight corresponding to the duplicate application office. Table 4. Assignment rules for coverage weights Document type 
Coverage weight Singleton priority 
w PRIO Claimed priority 
max (w 
PRIO , w 
DUPL ) Duplicate application 
w DUPL The unequal country coverage has only a limited effect on our ability to identify inventions that 
have sought protection elsewhere ('claimed priorities'), because we can impute inventor information 
from other members of the same patent family whose coverage might be superior. However, it does 
potentially compromise our ability to identify inventions that have sought protection only in one 
jurisdiction (singletons) with incomplete coverage, or duplicate applications of foreign patents 
(duplicates) registered in jurisdictions with incomplete coverage. It must be noted that the approach presented here has certain limitations: First, the coverage 
weights as derived here represent only the direct coverage of countries in PATSTAT. Indirect 
coverage, derived by exploiting information on patent families, is not reflected (see e.g. the lower part 
of Table 2). Second, the coverage weights are only assigned to patent offices, not inventor countries 
(this would help with interpretation of the last column in Table 2). In both cases, addressing these 
issues would require estimating such propensities econometrically. However, this would require 
access to data external to PATSTAT. Third, we generate frequency counts along selected vectors – by office, inventor country, priority 
or application year, technology, as well as the coverage weight. This allows making judgements about 
the reliability of observed patent counts, notably to: @BULLET Identify 'true zeros' – i.e. when patent count=0 and coverage weight=1 (or close to 1). Such 
distinction between 'true zeros' and 'missing values is otherwise not possible. @BULLET Identify nonzero counts with 'low reliability' – i.e. when patent count>0 and weight<1 (or 
far from 1). In some cases, one might observe a positive count and a zero coverage weight at 
the same time. Such counts arise through 'indirect' channels discussed above, and should be 
considered as significant underestimates. Among other things, this allows selecting a data 
sample based on a minimum threshold value of coverage. For example, consider only those 
counts derived from information that is 95% complete. However, applying such a 'filter' 
might involve a trade-off between geographical scope and data quality. The Use of Patent Statistics for International Comparisons and Analysis of Narrow Technological Fields OECD SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY AND INDUSTRY WORKING PAPERS 24 3.2 
Protection in national jurisdictions through regional (international) patent filings Regional IP offices play a more-or-less important role in the world. For example, patenting at the 
European Patent Office (EPO) is an increasingly important route of protecting IP rights in Europe. 
Similarly, patenting at the two African regional IP offices (ARIPO, OAPI) also plays an important 
role. 10 However, based on a regional application it is difficult to infer the true protection strategy of a 
patentee. As a consequence, when constructing patent indicators researchers frequently either treat 
EPO and other regional filings as if they were equivalent to national applications or simply set them 
aside as if they never existed. 11 To address the potential biases, in this paper we propose a method to account for filings at the 
EPO by estimating the  " protection propensities " . We then use the propensities to apportion EPO 
counts onto national jurisdictions. And while here we focus on the EPO, this approach could 
potentially be extended to other regional offices subject to data availability. Apportionment of EPO patent filings using protection propensities There are several potential sources of data that are potentially useful for inferring patentee's 
market protection strategies, including (a) list of designated states using the PAT_EP database – a 
straightforward but not satisfactory solution because designation rules have changed over time and 
certain countries are designated 'by default' reducing the value of such data; (b) publication kind 
codes in PATSTAT that identify grants of patents – while recent additions to PATSTAT have made 
this approach more convenient 12 , it is not clear whether a validation of an EP patent in a member state 
is always associated with a corresponding record in PATSTAT; and (c) payment of validation and 
maintenance fees – the major conceptual upside is that the data should be a reliable indicator of 
patentees' preferences because they are associated with financial cost. The latter approach is discussed 
next. In this paper, we use the European Patent Office's Inpadoc Legal Status database, also called 
Patent Register Service (PRS) Legal Status database, to construct  " protection propensities "  over time. 
The database contains data from 41 patent granting authorities going back to 1970. It contains over 
120 million records, each referring to a distinct  " legal status event " , identified by a PRS code. The 
great advantage is that the PRS records are linked to PATSTAT. There are several PRS codes that are potentially useful as evidence that patent applicants have 
designated, validated and maintained their patent rights in certain EPO member states against payment 
of fees. In this paper we use data on post-grant fee payment (PGFP) to calculate the protection propensity 
(other alternatives that were also considered are summarized in the Annex). The major advantage of 
PGFP is that the data should be complete because patent offices have an interest in maintaining 
reliable records of fee payments; however, we identify several years and offices for which data in the 
PRS database are missing or appear incomplete. 13 Another potential downside is the time lag due to 
granting of a patent and fee payment which causes problems for generating timely statistics. 
Therefore, we cannot calculate the protection propensities for the specific subset of relevant patents; 
instead we do so for all patents (PATSTAT total). More formally, the protection propensity is 
calculated as the ratio of a frequency count of EP applications that enter the national phase in a 
given member state as evidenced by payment of post-grant fees, and the frequency count of all 
(distinct) EP applications with PGFP evidence from any state. The protection propensity thus 
shows how often a typical EP application truly sought protection in a given member state (the sum of 
the propensities is thus more than 100%). We construct such propensities for all member states for the The Use of Patent Statistics for International Comparisons and Analysis of Narrow Technological Fields 25 OECD SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY AND INDUSTRY WORKING PAPERS time period starting with the year when they joined the EPO (Table 5). Propensities for selected 
offices are also shown in Figure 5. The propensities implied by this statistic seem to be of reasonable magnitudes. Overall, four 
broad groups of member states can be distinguished: (i) the most frequently protected countries with 
propensities close to 50%, including Germany, the United Kingdom and France, and followed by Italy 
(about 30%); (ii) mid-size markets with propensities between 10% and 20%, including Netherlands, 
Switzerland, Belgium, Sweden, Austria, and Spain; (iii) smaller markets with propensities between 1% 
and 10%, including markets with stable propensities over time (e.g. Greece, Ireland, Portugal) as well 
as more dynamic markets whose propensities are growing quickly (e.g. Turkey, Finland, Poland); and 
finally (iv) markets with propensities of less than 1%. Note that over time there has been a progressive move from single country designation to 
automatic designation of eventually all EPO members in EPO applications after 2004. The legalistic 
interpretation would thus lead to apportioning all EPO member countries to every EPO application 
after 2004. However, such automatic (or default) list of designated countries inflates the  " true "  
intentions of the applicants. Instead, in this paper we adopt the economic interpretation and seek to 
approximate what markets applicants really care about. Our objective is to apportion an EPO filing 
only to those member states where the applicant truly seeks to protect the invention. Evidence of post-
grant fee payment is thus a suitable option. The Use of Patent Statistics for International Comparisons and Analysis of Narrow Technological Fields OECD SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY AND INDUSTRY WORKING PAPERS 26 Table 5. Protection propensities in EPO member states (1990-2012, 3-year moving average) 1990

3.317 Figure 5. Propensity to protect in an EPO member state (PGFP, 3-year MA) In this paper, the protection propensities are generated only over time, assuming that all patent 
applicants in a given year are homogeneous with respect to protection propensities. This could be 
refined further by allowing the propensities to vary not only over time but also across priority office as 
well as duplicate office, inventor country or applicant country (although such information is 
sometimes missing, reducing the sample size). EPO applications could then be apportioned along all 
these vectors. The PRS data necessarily involve certain time lags. Therefore, in this paper we construct 
summary statistics of protection propensities for TOTPAT and apply these on EPAT. This is based on 
the assumption that protection propensities do not vary systematically across technological fields. We 0.00 0.10 0.20 0.30 0.40 0.50 0.60 0.70 1990

We then apply the propensities on the  " environmental "  counts and apportion EPO applications onto 
national patent offices of the member countries (as unit counts, not fractionally). Figure 6 shows the 
evolution over time of national and EP-apportioned patenting activity in air pollution abatement 
technologies for selected countries. An alternative approach would be to estimate the protection 
propensities econometrically as a function of characteristics of patent applicants, inventors, priority 
office, and technological field, and then nowcast the recent years. Figure 6. Patenting activity at the national office versus EP-apportioned filings In sum, construction of 'protection propensities' allows apportioning of regional patent filings 
onto national jurisdictions, and thus allows to correct for the drop in national patenting caused by 
growing tendency to protect inventions at the regional rather than national authorities. Subject to 
availability of protection data, this methodology could be extended to other regional offices. Such EPO protection propensities can be useful for at least two types of applications. First, the 
propensities can be used to estimate patent family size when constructing patent family-based 
indicators. Consider the following example using data from Table 5: Summing across protection 
propensities of all EPO member states in a given year yields the  " aggregate propensity "  – that is, the 
average size of an EP patent family. For most of the 1990-2012 period the aggregate propensity varies 
between 2.5 and 3.2 (last row in Table 5). For example, in year 2000 this is estimated to be 3.082, so a 
singleton application deposited in that year at the EPO corresponds, on average, to a patent family 
with an approximate family size of 3. However, if PATSTAT also contains a trace of a German family 
member then the German application must contribute its full weight (unity) rather than its estimated 
weight in that year (1 rather than 0.553). Therefore, the equivalent size of such patent family is 
approximately 3.5 (Table 6 summarises this example). Table 6. Estimation of patent family size using EP protection propensities Observed family

jurisdictions of EPO member states, for example to construct patent stocks to be used in empirical 
analyses (Figure 7). 0 50 100 150 200 1960

Missing information For narrow technological fields, small inventor countries, or countries with low levels of 
patenting activity – that is, situations with frequent zeros and generally low patent counts – increasing 
the 'yield' of patent data extractions is valuable. However, this should be done in a manner that 
minimizes a potential bias in the analysis (this will be discussed in Section 4 below). Imputing missing information on inventors One way to increase the magnitude and variation of counts is to impute missing inventor 
information. While basic bibliographic information such as application authority and application date 
is always available in patent databases, additional descriptive information such as name and address of 
the inventor(s) and applicant(s) are often missing or incomplete. To mitigate this problem we retrieve 
inventor data for all patent family members and impute from duplicate applications information on 
inventor countries that is not listed in the priority document. The imputed inventor information is then 
stored at the level of the priority because it is common to all members of the single-priority patent 
family. This typically allows increasing the volume of data with known inventor information by 3 to 4 
percentage points (Table 7). 14 While technically the same imputation procedure could be conducted to mitigate missing 
applicant information, conceptually it might be preferable to retain all sets of applicant data within a 
family because applicants might be different for each patent application, i.e. due to change of 
ownership. 0 1000 2000 3000 4000 1960

defined in terms of IPC symbols, the yield can be increased by searching also in the APPLN_ECLA 
(more recently APPLN_CPC) table in addition to APPLN_IPC table. This is because EPO examiners 
often assign ECLA symbols even to foreign filings if they consider that the existing classifications are 
not sufficient or appropriate. For example, in the case of wastewater treatment technologies this allows 
increasing the volume of data by 3 percentage points compared with a search conducted only in the

134,912 Expansion of patent families To construct patent families, we proceed in three steps. First, the patent database is searched for 
the relevant (e.g.  " green "  or  " environment-related " ) patents using a given definition – a search 
strategy. Second, we search for potential family members outside of this subset of documents using 
the DOCDBFAM table that gives patent applications protecting the same set of claims. Third, we 
identify priority relationships within this enlarged subset of patent documents.

3,879 (+5%) This approach also helps to mitigate the bias historically created by the distinction between core-
and advanced-level IPC classes and the differentiated obligations of patent offices to classify in the 
latter (only patent offices in the  " PCT-minimum requirements "  are mandated to classify at the 
advanced level). Hence, when a search strategy is based on advanced-level IPC symbols (which is 
almost always the case), small patent offices that only classify at the core level would be under-
represented in the searches. The next Section discusses this issue in greater detail. Constructing variables to normalize (or control for) missing information While strategies to impute missing information are valuable because they increase the  " yield "  of 
patent extractions, they too might introduce potential biases in analysis. So both, the presence of 
missing information, as well as imputation thereof, might give rise to biases. One way to mitigate 
them is to generate a corresponding count of patent  " totals "  (so-called TOTPAT). By corresponding 
we mean a statistic that is constructed in a manner that is identical to the  " environmental "  count 
(EPAT) with the one exception that all documents (not only  " environmental " ) are considered. For 
example, if missing information on inventors is imputed, this should be done identically for EPAT as 
for TOTPAT. Ways in which such TOTPAT variable can be used for the purposes of normalization in 
descriptive analyses or as a control variable in econometric analyses will be discussed in Section 4 
below. The Use of Patent Statistics for International Comparisons and Analysis of Narrow Technological Fields OECD SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY AND INDUSTRY WORKING PAPERS 32 3.4 
Non-systematic classification of patent documents Assignment of patent classification symbols to patented inventions is not homogeneous across 
patent offices and this is another potential source of idiosyncratic biases in patent analysis. Questions 
arise concerning the best ways to apply a given search strategy to identify the relevant patents in a 
patent database; and, how to identify the relevant population, or a relevant subset in an unbiased 
manner? 15 The use of the international patent classification system (IPC) varies across offices to a certain 
extent. For example, while patent offices listed in the  " PCT minimum requirements "  are obliged to 
assign IPC symbols at the 'advanced' level, other patent offices must do so only at the 'core' level 
although in practice they might assign advanced level symbols in areas of particular interest. This is 
important because search strategies for narrow technological fields are often based on symbols at the 
advanced level of IPC. Such heterogeneous practices in assignment of IPC symbols thus create a 
potential source of a bias. Even more importantly, many national patent offices have developed their own patent 
classification systems (ECLA, USPC, F-terms, etc.) to classify patent applications, the related prior 
art, and perhaps patents in selected domains that are of specific interest to their respective countries. In 
any case, the national patent classification symbols are assigned only to a certain subset of the world's 
 " population "  of patent applications. For example, the EPO uses the ECLA symbols 16 to systematically 
classify all patent documents from the  " PCT minimum requirements "  in one of the EPO official 
languages (incl. German, English and French), with documents filed in other languages (e.g. Japanese, 
Russian, Spanish) are excluded. Patent documents in Dutch (e.g. those filed in the Netherlands, 
Belgium and Luxembourg) are also classified as well as those with first filings residents from Austria, 
Australia and Canada. In addition, Korean, Chinese and Indian documents are classified if they are in 
one of the four EPO languages. Additional documents might be machine-translated if they are in 
selected priority areas (determined based on IPC symbols assigned by home offices). Finally, some 
Japanese documents were classified in the past based on abstracts, and they might be re-classified if a 
subsequent equivalent is published in one of the four EPO languages. 17 The situation is in many 
respects similar, if not  " worse " , at other patent offices worldwide because they too face resource 
constraints. In sum, while the practice of selective classification in national systems might be economically 
justified, from a researcher's point of view it creates another potential source of bias. For example, 
while a large majority of patent documents in PATSTAT have an ECLA symbol assigned, it is not true 
of all the patent documents. Therefore, a search strategy that uses an ECLA symbol might yield biased 
results insofar it cannot identify relevant documents among those without an ECLA symbol. The situation is even more complicated with search strategies that use the recently introduced 
Y02 class (so-called Y-tags) developed by the EPO. While this new tagging scheme greatly facilitates 
identification of many climate-related inventions by non-specialists, users should be aware of its 
implications. 18 To be clear, the new tagging scheme does not substitute for the standard ECLA (or 
CPC) classification symbols, rather it is complementary. Technically, the tagging does not involve 
examination of each individual patent application, rather it is constructed as a set of search algorithms 
that exploit the full stock of descriptive attributes in DOCDB 19 , including the IPC and ECLA symbols, 
as well as EPO's internal schemes of in-computer-only (ICO) classification symbols and keywords 
(KW). In addition, for some technologies keyword searches on English titles and abstracts are 
conducted (either as a single keyword or in combination). Finally, where available, Derwent WPI 
index might be used as well. 20 Therefore, the population of patents from which such searches draw is The Use of Patent Statistics for International Comparisons and Analysis of Narrow Technological Fields 33 OECD SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY AND INDUSTRY WORKING PAPERS unknown (or imperfectly defined, at least). Next we discuss strategies that help mitigate any potential 
biases. Constructing variables to normalize (or control for) non-systematic classification Ideally, every  " environmental "  patent (EPAT) search strategy needs its own corresponding 
TOTPAT control variable. A researcher using an IPC-based (or ECLA-based) search strategy can 
easily generate a corresponding count of patent  " totals "  (e.g. all patents with an/any IPC (ECLA) 
symbol assigned). Similarly, if a search strategy is based on English keywords in titles and abstracts, 
then the corresponding TOTPAT would be constructed as a count of all patent families with an 
English-language title or abstract. In these cases, construction of such variables is straightforward 
because the set of patents from which such searches draw is known – PATSTAT allows identifying 
these relevant sets of documents (see Table 10). At the aggregate level TOTPAT_IPC and 
TOTPAT_ECLA are highly correlated because as many as 80% of all documents (appln_id's) in 
PATSTAT have both IPC and ECLA symbols assigned. However, there are important differences at 
the more disaggregated level. However, in the case of a Y-based search strategy the set of  " potentially identifiable "  documents 
is only imperfectly defined, and therefore it is more difficult to generate a corresponding  " total " . As 
described above, the set of documents that could have theoretically been searched and assigned a 
given Y-tag is only imperfectly defined. Therefore, constructing TOTPAT_YTAG correctly is an 
impossible task, unless a separate TOTPAT count is generated for every Y-symbol which is in most 
practical uses of patent data too costly. 21 In most practical applications, the researcher might use an 
approximation of TOTPAT_YTAG (#4) based on some combination of the corresponding totals – for 
example, the union of the IPC and ECLA TOTPATs (#5 in Table 10). The Use of Patent Statistics for International Comparisons and Analysis of Narrow Technological Fields OECD SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY AND INDUSTRY WORKING PAPERS 34 Table 10. Construction of corresponding totals If EPAT search

84% For these reasons, and when there is a choice between an IPC-based and Y02-based search 
strategy, it might be preferable to use IPC because it allows correctly specifying the "counterfactual" 
(all patents with and assigned IPC symbol, not only the 'environmental' IPC symbol), a task that is 
more difficult (if not impossible) to do for Y-tagging because the individuals to be tagged are not 
drawn randomly from this population (we do not know the 'taggable' population). This might be 
particularly important for regions of the world that are not well covered by the Y02 scheme. This problem will diminish over time because many of the elements (ECLA, ICO, KW) have 
now become part of the new CPC system. As patent classification systems become increasingly 
harmonised, and the CPC is used more widely, the precision of TOTPAT_YTAG will approach that of 
TOTPAT_CPC. Until then, for research hypotheses where it is of key importance to have a precise 
control (counterfactual) IPC might indeed be the better option. In some cases it might be possible to define a  " sectoral total "  instead of a  " PATSTAT total "  as 
discussed above. For example, analysis of electric and hybrid cars patenting can be complemented 
with a  " total "  count for the entire sector of motor vehicles or road vehicles which it is possible to 
define using IPC symbols (Haščič and Johnstone 2011; see also Aghion et al. 2012). Similarly, 
analysis of fuel-efficient energy generation technologies can be complemented with a  " total "  count for 
the entire sector of energy generation from fossil fuel combustion (Lanzi et al. 2011; Noailly and 
Smeets 2013). The Use of Patent Statistics for International Comparisons and Analysis of Narrow Technological Fields 35 OECD SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY AND INDUSTRY WORKING PAPERS 4. 
IMPLICATIONS FOR EMPIRICAL ANALYSIS The need for a normalization count (control variable) Dealing with a narrow technological field is both a boon and a bane. On the one hand, this poses 
certain difficulties in terms of indicator construction (Section 2), but on the other hand it allows 
generating a  " total "  variable that is an appropriate answer to these, and other, difficulties. The 
conceptual justification for the use of such variable is twofold: First, there are conceptual (economic) 
reasons for using a TOTPAT arising out of the need to control for many generic factors that affect 
patenting in a narrow field, including: @BULLET Differences in inventive capacity @BULLET Differences in propensity to patent @BULLET Differences in patent breadth and patent 'quality' @BULLET Other factors that might affect patenting in general Obviously, there might be suitable substitutes for TOTPAT to control for these differences across 
countries, sectors, firms, and over time (while such substitutes may be even better, the data is not 
always readily available). 22 Second, there is another set of reasons that might be even more important and for which it is 
impossible to substitute with other data. These are the methodological (idiosyncratic) reasons calling 
for the use of a TOTPAT arising out of: @BULLET Incomplete information due to differences in coverage of patent databases (Section 3.1) @BULLET Imperfect information on jurisdictions where patent protection is sought through regional 
procedures (Section 3.2) 
@BULLET Extent of missing information on inventors, applicants, patent classes (Section 3.3) @BULLET Non-systematic classification of patent documents (Section 3.4) Using a TOTPAT variable deals perfectly with the latter (idiosyncratic) sources of biases (except 
for those discussed in 3.4) and imperfectly with the former (conceptual) sources of biases. How 
exactly should such a TOTPAT variable be constructed will depend on three factors: i) 
Indicator selected (e.g. PF2 for invention, PF1 for co-invention) ii) 
Search strategy used (e.g. based on IPC, ECLA, keyword searches, or other) iii) 
Algorithm used to construct the EPAT count (i.e. treatment of idiosyncrasies, other 
programming details that might affect the final outcome). The corresponding TOTPAT is identical to EPAT in all the three aspects above. It is measured 
using the same indicator (e.g. PF2, TPF, count of co-inventions), based on the same type of search 
strategy (see Table 10), and constructed using an otherwise identical algorithm. In descriptive analyses, inclusion of a TOTPAT variable provides suitable context and a basis for 
interpretation of trends observed in EPAT. Another option is to 'normalize' the EPAT count, for 
example, as a measure of specialisation expressed as a ratio of a country's share of EPAT on TOTPAT The Use of Patent Statistics for International Comparisons and Analysis of Narrow Technological Fields OECD SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY AND INDUSTRY WORKING PAPERS 36 over the share of EPAT over TOTPAT worldwide (relative propensity to invent, relative propensity to 
patent) although such measures might be difficult for a layperson to interpret. However, this approach yields the greatest benefits in econometric analyses. Indeed, many of the 
potential biases discussed above can be successfully mitigated by inclusion of a TOTPAT control 
variable (of the same dimensionality as EPAT). Such variable has the potential to partially control for 
changes in patenting propensities over time and across countries and offices, and to correct 
measurement error due to the idiosyncrasies detailed above. In empirical research one might be 
tempted to disregard such potential errors; while they might indeed be negligible in the EU-US space, 
shifting the analysis outside of the OECD countries increases the potential for erroneous conclusions, 
and hence the need to control for potential idiosyncratic biases. 5. 
CONCLUDING REMARKS This paper draws attention to several issues that are specific to analysis of narrow technological 
fields in cross-country international comparisons. Moreover, there is a rising interest in patent analyses 
in developing countries and this raises new types of issues. First, the paper advocates the use of a 
range of patent indicators based on international patent family size. While it concludes that 
determining the  " optimal "  family size for a given application is largely an empirical question, PF2 or 
higher-order restrictions are preferable than PF1, unless the technological field studied is so narrow 
that this restricts the variation in the data 'too much' (too many zeros and low counts). In such cases 
one has no other option but to use PF1. There is indeed a trade-off between patent quality and breadth 
of technological fields studied. Second, the paper reviews four types of idiosyncratic problems in the underlying data, including 
how to tell zeros from missings; how to address the problem of regional patent filings; how to increase 
yield of database extractions; and how to face patent identification problems. The paper advocates 
using a normalization (or control) variable constructed in an analogous manner as the indicator of 
primary interest. All patent databases come with a warning – do not blindly estimate on the contents of 
the database! The Use of Patent Statistics for International Comparisons and Analysis of Narrow Technological Fields 37 OECD SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY AND INDUSTRY WORKING PAPERS NOTES 1 PCT count is not always a suitable indicator for inter-country comparisons because the propensity to use the 
PCT route varies across countries and over time (even after year 2000). Inventors from different countries vary 
in their likelihood of pursuing the PCT through to the national/regional phase (e.g. 80% for NL, 30% RU and 
KR), and as such PCT counts suffer from their own specific type of 'home bias'. It is equivalent to a call option 
rather than a true patent application, and because the initial costs are rather low (esp. in the international phase) 
PCT applications often covers inventions of little value (OECD 2009). 2 Working with patent families is essential to avoid double-counting of inventions when patent data from 
multiple patent offices are pooled together. We adopt the notion of single-priority patent family (Martinez 2010) 
because it facilitates many of the steps discussed herein. We calculate the  " international patent family size "  – 
that is, the number of distinct patent authorities within a family. As such, we distinguish between 3 types of 
equivalents – singleton priorities, claimed priorities and duplicates. 3 Claimed priorities with regional weights would yield a  " dyadic patent family "  indicator. 4 In the same vein, de Rassenfosse et al. (2013) advocate a metric based on  " a worldwide count of priority 
patents "  as a measure of inventive activity (equivalent to PF1 presented here). They highlight the advantages of 
such a measure relative to PCT counts. 5 Claimed priorities account for a relatively small proportion of the stock of patent applications. For example, 
in a study focusing on innovation in climate change mitigation technologies found that only about 11% of the 
relevant stock of patent applications included in PATSTAT were CPs, with 34% being their duplicates, and 55% 
being singletons (Haščič et al. 2010). In other words, in climate change mitigation technologies CPs represent 
only 16% of the stock of patented inventions (simple patent families), while the large majority (84%) of these 
inventions were only protected at a single patent office (singletons). It must be noted that there is variation in 
these proportions across patent offices. 6 Note that account has to be taken of changing membership through time. 7 For example, former Eastern Germany (DD) complete data until 1999; former Czechoslovakia (CS) complete 
data until 1993, thereafter complete data separately for SK and CZ; former Yugoslavia (YU) data until 1992. 8 The statistical data for Israel are supplied by and under the responsibility of the relevant Israeli authorities. 
The use of such data by the OECD is without prejudice to the status of the Golan Heights, East Jerusalem and 
Israeli settlements in the West Bank under the terms of international law. 9 a) Note by Turkey: The information in this document with reference to  " Cyprus "  relates to the southern part of the Island. There 
is no single authority representing both Turkish and Greek Cypriot people on the Island. Turkey recognises 
the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (TRNC). Until a lasting and equitable solution is found within the 
context of the United Nations, Turkey shall preserve its position concerning the  " Cyprus issue " . b) Note by all the European Union Member States of the OECD and the European Union: The Republic of Cyprus is recognised by all members of the United Nations with the exception of Turkey. 
The information in this document relates to the area under the effective control of the Government of the 
Republic of Cyprus. 10 ARIPO and OAPI together accounted for 34% of patent applications deposited in Africa during 1980-2009, 
excluding the South African office (Haščič et al. 2012). 11 The ignorance of the  " do nothing "  approach is not necessarily bad as long as one is comfortable with its 
implications, such as (i) wrongly classifying an EP patent application as a singleton when in fact it is a claimed The Use of Patent Statistics for International Comparisons and Analysis of Narrow Technological Fields OECD SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY AND INDUSTRY WORKING PAPERS 38 priority, or (ii) wrongly classifying a patent family as a claimed priority when in fact it is only a singleton (e.g. 
consider a patent family consisting of EP and DE applications with DE as the only designated country). 12 Previously, one needed to determine whether a patent has been granted at each of the 38 member states 
patent authorities, hence making sense of the 38 different publication kind code systems. Fortunately, this has 
been much facilitated in recent editions of PATSTAT. 13 Specifically, data for years prior to 1990 seem rather incomplete; therefore we only construct the propensities 
for the period after 1990 (for Italy only after 2004). Even after 1990, data for some years and offices are missing, 
with two different situations occurring: (1) A year count is missing (GR 2007, LT 2007) and years around seem 
to be correct (the same trend before and after the missing year). In this case we simply impute a value for the 
missing year corresponding to the mean of the year before and the year after. (2) A year count is missing (FR 
2007, IT 2007) and the years before and after show implausibly high numbers above the long-term trend. In this 
case we assume that for an unknown reason the patents have been distributed among the years before and after 
the missing year. ). In this case we re-allocate a third of the count proceeding the missing year, and a third of 
count in the year following the missing year. Moreover, the total on which the propensities are calculated also 
has to be corrected (the total for 2007 is very low compared with other years). The total is the count of distinct 
applications among all countries (no double-counting for applications with protection in multiple states). We use 
the  " duplicate protection "  coefficient observed in 2005 and 2009, take the mean of those two values, and divide 
through the values re-allocated from 2006 to 2007 and from 2008 to 2007 to inflate the total for 2007. 14 A similar approach was developed by De Rassenfosse et al. (2013). 15 Development of a suitable search strategy – that is, a mapping between patent classification systems and a 
definition of  " environmental "  innovation -is a distinct problem and is not addressed here. A companion paper is 
devoted to this issue. 16 Starting 2013 the EPO and USPTO have started using a common classification system (CPC) and 
consequently the use of ECLA and USPC is being discontinued. 17 Personal communication from Mr. Pierre Held of the European Patent Office, November 2012 in Hamburg, 
Germany. 18 The benefit of the new Y02 scheme is twofold. First, it allows identifying patent documents in technological 
fields that would otherwise not be possible by a non-specialist! The tags were developed by patent examiners at 
the EPO who are specialised in the different fields covered. Second, it provides a much greater level of detail 
than what would be possible using the IPC. This is a significant advantage over previous searches based on the 
IPC. See Veefkind et al. (2012) for further details. 19 DOCDB, also referred to as EPODOC, is the EPO's master documentation database. This is the resource 
used by patent examiners for searches of prior art. 20 Personal communication by Mr. Victor Veefkind of the European Patent Office, 2012. 21 In the ideal case, one would construct a different TOTPAT for each of the individual Y02 symbols – 
depending on type of attributes used in the algorithm to assign a given symbol (e.g. some algorithms use 
keywords, others do not). While such information could be made available, it is of limited practical use because 
(i) analysis is rarely conducted at the level of an individual symbol (e.g. Y02E10:43 Fresnel lenses); rather, it is 
the hierarchically more aggregated level (e.g. Y02E10:4 Solar thermal energy) that is of interest to decision-
makers. In such case it is not clear how can one generate a TOTPAT at the aggregate level when individual tags 
use different sets of attributes; (ii) Even if the same set of attributes were used within a given  " field "  of 
technology, analyses often compare several of such  " fields "  implying the use of multiple  " totals "  (e.g. a total for 
solar energy, a total for wind energy, etc.). 22 See Johnstone et al. (2012) for a discussion.

publication kind codes as extracted from the PRS dataset (summarized in Table A1). The order is 
chronological and most likely it correlates with reliability of the statistic – data obtained close to grant 
reflect patentee's intentions better than data gathered at the beginning of the patenting process; moreover, 
patentee's preferences may evolve over time. Table A1. Candidate statistics and legal status search strategy Candidate statistic

Three countries have propensities that approach (or exceed) 90% (Germany, France, UK). While one 
would expect that these countries rank among the most often designated countries, the propensities 
suggested here are surprisingly high. Moreover, several rather minor economies show rather high 
propensities (e.g. Estonia has propensity almost as high as the Czech Republic, and Cyprus is not far from 
Denmark). This indicates that patentees might designate many countries at grant but then do not translate 
the application in the local language (validation) neither pay maintenance fees. Given this, statistic #4 is 
the best option.
