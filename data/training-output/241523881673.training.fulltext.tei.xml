There is no specific immigration policy for health professionals, although the<lb/> permanent and temporary routes make it relatively easy for doctors and nurses who can get their<lb/> qualification recognised to immigrate in New Zealand. At the same time, New Zealand also has high<lb/> emigration rates of health workers, mainly to other OECD countries.

In this context, new approaches to improve the<lb/> international recruitment of health workers, as well as developing alternative policies, may need to be<lb/> considered. As for international recruitment, better coordination and stronger collaboration between main<lb/> stakeholders could contribute to more effective and pertinent international recruitment.<lb/></p>

			<p>The health workforce in New Zealand, as in all OECD countries, plays a central role in the health<lb/> system. In New Zealand, it accounts for about 70% of the costs of delivering public health services and<lb/> 5.5% of the workforce (<ref type="biblio">Health Workforce Advisory Committee, 2002; OECD Health Data, 2007</ref>). Despite<lb/> the key role of the health workforce in the health system, it has not been at the core of the various health<lb/> system reforms in New Zealand. Nonetheless, health workforce issues have captured more attention<lb/> recently, and there is now a growing recognition of their importance.<lb/> 10.<lb/> Maybe more than for any other OECD country, the health workforce in New Zealand cannot be<lb/> considered without taking into account its international dimension. New Zealand has the highest proportion<lb/> of migrant doctors among OECD countries, and one of the highest for nurses. At the same time, New<lb/> Zealand also has high emigration rates of health workers, mainly to other OECD countries. International<lb/> migration is thus at the same time an opportunity and a challenge for the management of the human<lb/> resources for health (HRH) in New Zealand. This emphasises the need to better understand and strengthen<lb/> the interactions between training, career development and international migration of health workers, a<lb/> necessity reinforced by the increasing international competition for talent, and in particular health<lb/> professionals.<lb/> 11.<lb/> This paper examines health workforce and migration policies in New Zealand, with a special<lb/> focus on the international recruitment of doctors and nurses. In the first section, an overview of the health<lb/> workforce is presented. Health workforce policies are discussed in the second section with a focus on<lb/> international mobility. The third section addresses more specifically the current and future challenges<lb/> related to in-and out-migration.<lb/></p>

			<head>Main findings<lb/></head>

			<p>• With 2.2 practising physicians per 1 000 population, New Zealand has a lower density than the<lb/> OECD average (3.1‰). The reverse is true for nurses (9.5‰ as compared to 8.7‰). The<lb/> geographical distribution of doctors and nurses is an important issue in New Zealand, as in many<lb/> other OECD countries. Ageing and feminization of the health workforce are two other features<lb/> that are shared by many other countries.<lb/></p>

			<p>• The importance of in-and out-migration is a key characteristic of the health workforce in</p>

			<table>New<lb/> Zealand. New Zealand has the highest ratios of foreign-born and foreign-trained doctors in<lb/> OECD countries (respectively 52% and 36% in 2005-06) and among the highest for nurses (29%<lb/> and 24%, respectively). New Zealand also has the third highest and the second highest<lb/> expatriation rates for doctors and nurses (28.5% and 23%, respectively).<lb/> • The number of New Zealand-born doctors living in other OECD countries represents half the<lb/> number of foreign-born doctors in New Zealand. The number of New Zealand-born nurses living<lb/> in other OECD countries is matched by the number of foreign-born nurses in New Zealand<lb/> (about 7 500).<lb/> • There is no specific immigration policy for health professionals, although the permanent and<lb/> temporary routes make it relatively easy for doctors and nurses who can get their qualification<lb/> recognised to immigrate in New Zealand.<lb/> • The increasing use of temporary migration gives rise to a large number of short-term stays of<lb/> health workers in New Zealand, in particular for doctors. While this is certainly a good policy to<lb/> address workforce shortages in rural areas, short-term migration raises issues in terms of<lb/> turnover. More generally, in the New Zealand context, retention of health professionals is a key<lb/> issue because attrition rates (for doctors) and turnover rates (for nurses) tend to be quite high.<lb/></table>

			<p>• Despite repeated calls for &quot; self-sufficiency &quot; in recent official reports, New Zealand trains<lb/> proportionally less medical graduates than OECD countries on average. It also has very few<lb/> foreign medical students. As for nurses, the training rate is close to the OECD average, but out-<lb/>migration, notably to Australia, partly offsets this effort.<lb/></p>

			<table>• A broad portfolio of policies, in line with the recommendations of the Health Workforce<lb/> Advisory Committee and more recently of the Health Workforce Taskforce, including improving<lb/> salaries and working conditions, developing further skill-mix approaches, attracting back health<lb/> workers who left New Zealand, reinforcing the links between education and management of the<lb/> health workforce policies, would need further consideration.<lb/> • Strengthening coordination between the main actors—the Department of labour, the Ministry of<lb/> Health, the Ministry of Education, and the Tertiary Education Commission, but also with and<lb/> between District Health Boards (DHBs)—could help to better address short and long-term<lb/> shortages.<lb/></table>

			<p>• To date, immigration has been a very significant part of the supply of health workers in New<lb/> Zealand. However, further increase in the number of overseas-trained health professionals might<lb/> place New Zealand in a delicate position, as it could become too dependent on immigration in a<lb/> context where many other OECD countries are also looking to recruit foreign doctors and nurses.<lb/></p>

			<head>1. OVERVIEW<lb/></head>

			<p>12.<lb/> While the evolution of the health workforce over the past 25 years shows similar trends to those<lb/> observed for the OECD as a whole, density for doctors tends to be lower than the OECD average but it is<lb/> higher for nurses. Recent changes in terms of the regional distribution, gender mix and ageing of the health<lb/> workforce are mostly shared with other OECD countries. At the same time, New Zealand is characterised<lb/> by both large immigration and emigration of doctors and nurses.<lb/></p>

			<head>Health workforce density: occupational, regional and trend variations<lb/></head>

			<p>13.<lb/> As depicted in Chart 1a, with 2.2 practising physicians per 1 000 population, New Zealand is<lb/> below the OECD average of 3.1‰. As for nurses, with 9.5 practising nurses per 1 000 population, New<lb/> Zealand is slightly above the OECD average of 8.7‰. Results are more contrasted in terms of skill mix, as<lb/> the number of nurses per doctor amounts to 4.3 which is significantly higher than the OECD average of<lb/> 2.8. As far as other health professionals are concerned, the population ratio for pharmacists is quite close to<lb/> the OECD average at 0.75‰, while the corresponding figure for dentists is 50% lower than the OECD<lb/> average (0.4‰ as compared to 0.62‰).<lb/> 14.<lb/> Because the population of New Zealand is relatively small (about 4 million), the moderate<lb/> density figures translate into low numbers of doctors and nurses. Indeed, it is estimated that there are 9 000<lb/> practising physicians and around 38 000 practising nurses and midwives in New Zealand (OECD, <ref type="biblio">Health<lb/> Data, 2006</ref>). About a third of the practising physicians are in general practice. While General Practitioners<lb/> are essentially working in ambulatory practices, this is not the case for specialists who mainly work in<lb/> public hospitals. Moreover, the proportion of specialists working in public hospitals increased over time,<lb/> from 49% in 2000 to 74% in 2005 (<ref type="biblio">Medical Council, 2007</ref>). In some specialities such as vascular surgery,<lb/> neurosurgery or paediatric surgery, no more than 20 physicians are registered. 4 In this context, if a few<lb/> specialists opt to emigrate this can have a major impact on health care delivery.<lb/> 15.<lb/> New Zealand is also characterised by significant imbalances in the geographic distribution of<lb/> health professionals, as are most OECD countries. The lowest ratios of medical practitioners to population<lb/> are found in rural regions in the North Island and in the West coast of the South Island (see Map 1). On the<lb/> other hand, the highest ratios are in the larger urban regions, mainly Auckland, and Capital and Coast<lb/> (Wellington and Kapiti) regions.<lb/> 16.<lb/> The differences are even more marked when performing the analysis on the basis of Territorial<lb/> Authorities 5 . While in the cities of Auckland, Dunedin and Hamilton, there are more than 400 full-time-<lb/>equivalent doctors per 100 000 population, the corresponding figure is below 40 in the districts of Opotiki,<lb/> Wairoa, Westland, Waimakariri and Southland (Medical Council of New <ref type="biblio">Zealand, 2004</ref>). A large part of<lb/> 4<lb/></p>

			<p>There are only five specialists registered in breast medicine, 12 in rehabilitation medicine and 13 in oral<lb/> and maxillofacial surgery.<lb/> these differences, notably for specialists, can be attributed to the presence of hospitals in cities. Geographic<lb/> distribution of registered nurses appears to be more even, complementing to some extent the &quot; lack &quot; of<lb/> other types of health professionals in some regions (e.g. West Coast).<lb/></p>

			<head>Demographic characteristics of the health workforce: feminization and ageing<lb/></head>

			<p>19.<lb/> New common trends have emerged in the health workforce of OECD countries in recent years,<lb/> which may impact both the supply and the demand for health care. While health workforce ageing,<lb/> feminization and new working patterns may result in a reduction in the supply of health workers,<lb/> population ageing and technological changes are anticipated to increase the demand for health care<lb/> services.<lb/> 20.<lb/> With regard to the ageing of its health workforce, New Zealand is not an exception: the average<lb/> age is estimated at 45 for nurses and 44 for doctors. In 1990, about 35% of medical practitioners were<lb/> under 35 years of age but by 2003 this percentage had fallen to 23% (see Chart 3a). This trend is even<lb/> more marked for general practitioners and for registered nurses and midwives.<lb/></p>

			<figure>Chart 3b. Age distribution of registered nurses and midwives in New Zealand, 1994-2004<lb/> Note. Data excludes enrolled nurses<lb/> Source: New Zealand Health Workforce Statistics 2004, NZHIS<lb/> 0%<lb/> 5%<lb/> 10%<lb/> 15%<lb/> 20%<lb/> 25%<lb/> 20-24<lb/> 25-29<lb/> 30-34<lb/> 35-39<lb/> 40-44<lb/> 45-49<lb/> 50-54<lb/> 55-59<lb/> 60+<lb/> 1994<lb/> 2000<lb/> 2004<lb/> 21.<lb/> As illustrated in Chart 4, feminization of the medical workforce has been one of most notable<lb/> changes over the past three decades in New Zealand. Women doctors now represent 37% of all medical<lb/> practitioners compared to 16.4% in 1980. They also count for about 50% of the current medical trainees<lb/> (Health Workforce Advisory Committee, 2002; Medical Council of New Zealand<ref type="biblio">, 2004</ref>). The feminisation<lb/> of the medical workforce brings changes in working patterns as female doctors tend to concentrate more in<lb/> primary care (family medicine, paediatrics, and psychiatry) and to work more part-time than their male<lb/> counterparts. However, growing numbers are training in specialist branches such as radiation, oncology,<lb/> pathology and several areas of surgery (Health Workforce Advisory Committee, 2002). In comparison, the<lb/> nursing workforce is still quite gender-biased with only about 6% of male registered nurses and midwives.<lb/></p>

			<figure>Chart 4. Percentage of women medical practitioners in New Zealand, 1980-2006<lb/> Source: New Zealand Medical Workforce Statistics, NZHIS<lb/> 16.4<lb/> 37.1<lb/> 0<lb/> 5<lb/> 10<lb/> 15<lb/> 20<lb/> 25<lb/> 30<lb/> 35<lb/> 40<lb/> %<lb/> 22.<lb/> As a result of multiple factors, including legislative changes7, doctor&apos;s working hours have<lb/> decreased over time in most OECD countries. In New Zealand, the average hours worked per week by<lb/> medical practitioners decreased from 48 in 2001 to 45.8 in 2004 (Medical Council of New Zealand, 2001; ,<lb/> Medical Council of New Zealand, 2004). The results of the 2005 Royal New Zealand College of General<lb/> Practitioners (RNZCGP) Membership Survey suggest that among the 25-45 age</figure>

			<p>cohort, very few GPs<lb/> really want to be in full-time general practice, whether it is salaried or self-employed. There is a preference<lb/> for locum work, part-time general practice, sub-specialties, non-GP medical work, and even non-medical<lb/> work. One reason for this could be the desire for more balance between work and private life. This trend is<lb/> shared by many OECD countries. It is expected to continue and accentuate as the workforce is ageing and<lb/> feminising. This will probably contribute to reinforce the future need for medical practitioners and it raises<lb/> critical issues with regard to ways of ensuring continuity of service.<lb/></p>

			<head>Box 1. Māori health workforce<lb/></head>

			<p>The indigenous Māori population is underrepresented in the health workforce. While Māori population represented<lb/> about 15% of New Zealand population in 2003, Māoris made up only 2.7% of the medical workforce and 6.3% of the<lb/> nursing workforce. Despite the low proportion of Māori in the health workforce, their number is increasing. Policies<lb/> have been developed in order to increase their participation. Specific Māori health workforce plans have been<lb/> established. At national level, the Raranga Tupuake Māori Health Workforce Development Plan has strategies to<lb/> increase the number of Māori in the workforce at all levels, to expand the skill base of Māori currently in the workforce<lb/> and enable equitable access for Māori to future training opportunities. The latter includes collaboration between the<lb/> Minister of Health and traditional Māori healers to explore options for training and career pathways. District Health<lb/> Boards as major employers also have a key role in Māori workforce development. For instance, the MidCentral District<lb/> Health Board developed a Māori Health Workforce Strategy which aims, among other things, to involve Māori at all<lb/> levels including planning, development and the delivery of health care programs and services.<lb/></p>

The current agreement<lb/> between employers and trade unions is to work towards a 60-hour work week limit (see Landrigan 2006).<lb/> Immigrant and expatriate health workforce: New Zealand in a global context<lb/> 23.<lb/> A major feature of the New Zealand health workforce is the importance of immigrant health<lb/> workers. According to the 2006 census, about 52% of the medical doctors (5 200), 29% of the nurses (10<lb/> 500) and 39% and 23% of the dentists (590) and pharmacists (720), respectively were born abroad (see<lb/> Annex 1).<lb/></table>

			<p>24.<lb/> Immigration not only plays an important role in shaping New Zealand health workforce but its<lb/> role in clearly increasing (see Chart 5). The share of foreign-born increased by 10 percentage points among<lb/> doctors and nurses over the past 15 years. This increase was larger than the equivalent increase in the<lb/> foreign-born among the high-skilled workforce in New Zealand.<lb/></p>

			<p>of the immigrant nurses and doctors were from the United<lb/> Kingdom, which is the main origin country (see <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>). The second most important origin country is<lb/> Australia for nurses (8%) and South Africa for doctors (13%). OECD countries as a whole account for<lb/> about half of the immigrant doctors and 65% of the nurses. Pacific Islanders also make a significant<lb/> contribution to the New Zealand health workforce, notably for nurses, especially taking into account the<lb/> small size of their countries of origin.<lb/> 26.<lb/> The information based on place of birth could give a distorted image of the role of international<lb/> migration in shaping the health workforce if a significant share of these foreign-born were actually trained<lb/> in New Zealand and not in their origin country. In the case of New Zealand, however, the two indicators<lb/> are very close for nurses. Around 24% of nurses in New Zealand were foreign-trained in 2004 (see Chart<lb/> 6). This is not the case for doctors, as approximately 36% of active medical practitioners in</p>

			<p>to the importance of out-<lb/>migration. Travelling overseas is viewed as a positive thing and an integral part of the lifestyle choices of<lb/> many young New Zealanders.

Circa 2000,<lb/> the number of New Zealand-born individuals living in other OECD country amounted to about 1 900 for<lb/> doctors, 7 600 for nurses, 410 for pharmacists and 330 for dentists (see <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>). In total, we estimate that<lb/> 23% of New Zealand-born nurses and 29% of doctors were working in another OECD country in their<lb/> occupation. To a certain extent, these figures might even underestimate the importance of out-migration, as<lb/> they do not cover emigration of New Zealanders born outside New Zealand and do not include people who<lb/> were trained as health professionals but are working in another occupation overseas.<lb/></p>

Nonetheless, its importance<lb/> varies across health professions. While it is estimated that 51% of New Zealand-born dentists living abroad<lb/> are in Australia, this figure rises to 72% for nurses. The United Kingdom comes second, followed by the<lb/> United States and Canada. These four countries capture more than 98% of the emigration to other OECD<lb/> countries of New Zealand-born health professionals.<lb/></figure>

			<p>29.<lb/> In comparison to other OECD countries, New Zealand stands out both in terms of immigration<lb/> and emigration. In 2001, among OECD countries, New Zealand had the highest share of foreign-born<lb/> doctors. It is followed by Australia, Ireland, Canada, and the United Kingdom, with percentages ranging<lb/> between 34% and 43%. By contrast, figures range from a low of 1.5% to 4% in Mexico, Poland and<lb/> Finland. For nurses, figures are generally lower but New Zealand is still near top of the list. Switzerland,<lb/> Luxembourg, Australia and New Zealand have the highest share of foreign-born nurses ranging from<lb/> 23.2% to 28.5%. At the same time, New Zealand also has one of the highest expatriation rates among<lb/> OECD countries, only exceeded by Ireland (see Chart 7).<lb/> 30.<lb/> In comparison to the highly skilled in general, it was already pointed out that the share of foreign-<lb/>born tended to be higher amongst health professionals than among the highly skilled group as a whole (see<lb/> Chart 5). Chart 8 compares the expatriation rate of health professionals and of people holding a tertiary<lb/> degree for selected OECD countries around 2000. In the case of New Zealand, the former outstrips the<lb/> latter, meaning that proportionally more doctors and nurses emigrate than other highly skilled workers to<lb/> work in other OECD countries. This is also true for Canada, Finland and Ireland, but not in most other<lb/> OECD countries.<lb/></p>

			<p>31.<lb/> The previous results clearly show the magnitude of out-migration for health professionals. Tables<lb/> 1 and 2 show that the number of New Zealand-born doctors living in other OECD countries is equivalent<lb/> to approximately 50% of the number of foreign-born doctors in New Zealand. The results for nurses are<lb/> even more striking, as the number of New Zealand-born nurses living in other OECD countries is almost<lb/> equivalent to the number of foreign-born nurses in New Zealand. In other words, one could argue that<lb/> immigration replaces on a one to one basis the &quot; lost New Zealand-born nurses &quot; due to emigration.<lb/></p>

			<head>2. HEALTH WORKFORCE MANAGEMENT: TAKING ADVANTAGE OF INTERNATIONAL<lb/> MOBILITY<lb/></head>

			<p>32.<lb/> In New Zealand as in a lot of countries, many factors contribute to shape the health workforce<lb/> and the number of institutional stakeholders involved in policy development is large. In the following, a<lb/> brief overview of recent health care reforms and health workforce planning is presented before focusing on<lb/> education, recruitment and retention policies, with a special focus on the role of international migration.<lb/></p>

			<head>2.1 Health Care reforms and health workforce planning<lb/> Health care reforms<lb/></head>

			<p>33.<lb/> The New Zealand health system has always remained predominantly publicly funded, mainly<lb/> through taxation. The importance of the role of public funding is emphasised by the Social Security Act<lb/> 1938 which marked the introduction of a comprehensive health system that mandated the provision of free<lb/> care for all (<ref type="biblio">French et al., 2001</ref>). This law intended to create a national health service, universally<lb/> accessible and state-funded. Hospitals became publicly owned, providing fully subsidized treatment to<lb/> patients. However, medical practitioners insisted on remaining independent and finally succeeded in<lb/> retaining their private status. The Social Security Act has had a strong and long-term influence on the New<lb/> Zealand health system and it was not until the 1980s that major reforms took place. However, the health<lb/> workforce, and in particular the international mobility of health professionals, were not among the main<lb/> priorities of these reforms. Four time periods can be identified for the health reform priorities in New<lb/> Zealand (<ref type="biblio">Easton, 2002; Ashton 2002, 2005; Gauld, 2003</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<head>! First period: 1983-1992:</head>

			<p>During the 1970s, there was a perception that the health system was<lb/> becoming increasingly complex and needed reform. Then, in the 1980s, decentralization was<lb/> introduced with the creation of 14 Area Health Boards (AHBs) dealing with health care funding and<lb/> service management. It was expected that the introduction of the Areas Health Boards would allow<lb/> efficiency gains, but health expenditures per capita continued to grow (see Chart 9), particularly<lb/> primary medical care subsidies. The AHBs were initially introduced by the National Government in<lb/> 1983, but their role was expanded under the Labour <ref type="biblio">Government (1984-1990</ref>) in the context of public<lb/> sector reforms in New Zealand.<lb/></p>

			<figure>! Second period: 1993-1996: During this period, a market-oriented reform was introduced by the<lb/> National <ref type="biblio">Government (1990-1996</ref>). In particular, the purchaser-provider split model was adopted.<lb/> Under this system, purchasers used public funds to contract with competing public and private<lb/> providers for the provision of health services. Purchasers were encouraged to buy services from the<lb/> best value providers. In addition, budgets were integrated for primary and secondary services under one<lb/> purchaser. However, these reforms were not necessarily supported by individuals working in the health<lb/> system and the outcomes failed to match expectations, particularly in terms of securing efficiency gains<lb/> in the hospital sector.<lb/></p>

			<figure>! Third period 1996-1999: At the end of the 1990s, New Zealand&apos;s first election under proportional<lb/> representation produced a National-led coalition government (<ref type="biblio">1996-1999</ref>) which abandoned the idea of<lb/> competition as a main driver for the health system. Instead, the key guiding principle of collaboration<lb/> instead of competition was introduced.<lb/></p>

			<table>! Fourth period: 2000 and onwards: One key element of this restructuring process, under the<lb/> leadership of a Labour led coalition government (2000 up to present), set out in the New Zealand<lb/> Public Health and Disability Act 2000 is the establishment of 21 District Health Boards (DHBs). Each<lb/> DHB is responsible for providing or purchasing health services, including primary care, for the<lb/> residents in its district. The DHBs are financed by the Ministry of Health on the basis of a formula<lb/> accounting for the demographics of each district. The new health system combines centralised and<lb/> decentralised components. While funding has remained centralised—the Ministry of Health is the key<lb/> funding agent in the health system—health needs assessment, planning, provision and purchasing of<lb/> health care are decentralised through the activities of the DHBs.<lb/></table>

			<p>In the primary sector, in 2001, the implementation of the Primary Health Care Strategy and the creation<lb/> of Primary Health Organizations (PHOs) was an important change to the largely hospital-centered<lb/> string of reforms over the past 20 years. PHOs are non-profit organizations which contract with DHBs<lb/> to provide a comprehensive set of preventive and treatment services for their enrolled population. The<lb/> first PHOs were formed in 2001 and patient enrolment began in 2002. As of July 2007, there were 82<lb/> PHOs, covering 3.9 million people, or 97-98% of the New Zealand population. PHOs are funded for<lb/> each person enrolled with them (capitation basis) supplemented with a co-payment via a fee-for-service<lb/> system. In rural areas, due to recruitment difficulties, some DHBs recruit general practitioners (GPs)<lb/> directly and pay them often a very competitive salary.<lb/></p>

			<head>New Zealand<lb/> OECD<lb/></head>

			<p>34.<lb/> Unfortunately, there is no clear view on the impact and outcomes of each reform. However, the<lb/> restructuring appears to have made little impact on the trends that commonly describe health system<lb/> performance (<ref type="biblio">Ashton, 2002</ref>), although it is also likely that the life of each reform was too short to have a<lb/> long-term impact on the health system (<ref type="biblio">Gauld, 2003</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<head>Health Workforce planning<lb/></head>

			<p>35.<lb/> Prior to the adoption of a market-oriented approach in the 90&apos;s, health workforce planning was<lb/> playing an important role. Then, planning became less important, as market mechanisms were believed to<lb/> contribute to health workforce equilibrium. As a result, workforce planning was neglected, as illustrated by<lb/> the dismantling of most of the previous health workforce planning structures and processes. However, by<lb/> the late 1990s and early 2000s, it appeared that these &quot; laissez-faire &quot; arrangements were not working so<lb/> well. Persistent recruitment difficulties, a degraded infrastructure to support health workforce planning and<lb/> development, an inadequate information base in most respects, lack of communication and co-operation<lb/> between stakeholders including between the 21 DHBs (HWAC, 2003b), all contributed to the idea that<lb/> health workforce planning needed consideration again. As a result, various measures in the field of health<lb/> workforce planning and development were adopted.<lb/> 36.<lb/> Special committees were set up to address health workforce issues. One such committee, the<lb/> Health Workforce Advisory Committee (HWAC), was established in 2001 under the New Zealand Public<lb/> Health and Disability Act 2000 in order to advise the Minister of Health on any workforce issues, and also<lb/> to assess independently workforce capacity and foreseeable workforce needs.<lb/> 37.<lb/> In addition, specific concerns about the medical workforce, in particular, shortages, reliance on<lb/> overseas-trained doctors, and lack of coordination between the medical education and the health sector, led<lb/> the Health Workforce Advisory Committee to establish a Medical Reference Group 9 . The latter argued the<lb/> case for the idea of self-sufficiency for New Zealand (see Box 2)—its report recommends increasing the<lb/> number of medical graduates—and for workforce planning. It stresses the need for leadership and co-<lb/>ordination of medical workforce development in New Zealand, and proposed the development of a national<lb/> body, with a coordinated planning function and capacity to provide a nationally consistent strategic<lb/> overview of workforce development by aligning health and education policies and funding.<lb/></p>

			<head>Box 2. Self-sufficiency for the medical workforce in New Zealand?<lb/></head>

			<p>Over the past decade, self-sufficiency for the medical workforce has been advocated by different advisory committees,<lb/> taskforces as well as the Ministry of Health.<lb/></p>

			<table>&quot; We believe that the strategic aim should be for New Zealand to be self-sufficient in its production of medical<lb/> practitioners &quot; (Health Workforce Advisory Committee -2006, p. vii)<lb/> &quot; Consideration should be given to New Zealand becoming net self-sufficient for medical graduates &quot; (Ministry of Health,<lb/> 2006b, p. 19)<lb/> The workforce taskforce recommends that:<lb/> &quot; The number of medical graduates produced by the training system be increased to ensure that New Zealand moves<lb/> towards achieving ongoing self-sufficiency for its medical workforce &quot; (Workforce Taskforce 2007, p.1). This is part of<lb/> the recommendation of the Workforce Taskforce.<lb/></table>

			<p>The fact that the idea of &quot; self-sufficiency &quot; has gained importance in New Zealand might be surprising. New Zealand is<lb/> indeed a very open economy and immigration plays an important role in most economic sectors. Advocating for self-<lb/>sufficiency for the medical workforce would mean to recognize a &quot; medical exceptionalism &quot; . In this context, it is not<lb/> totally clear what self-sufficiency means and which policies will ensure it.<lb/></p>

However, after six years of existence, some claimed that it did not produce enough real<lb/> practical recommendations for the government. The committee concluded its work in September 2006.<lb/> More recently a Health Workforce Taskforce has been established in order to design more practical plans<lb/> to streamline workforce planning and address issues around training, recruitment and retention of the full<lb/> range of health professionals.<lb/></figure>

			<p>39.<lb/> DHBs are also involved in health workforce planning. Initially, medical workforce development<lb/> was largely left to individual employers, mainly each DHB. Then, efforts were undertaken to develop a<lb/> more global and integrated approach. In particular, District Health Boards New Zealand (DHBNZ) 10 ,<lb/> which groups all 21 DHBs, aims at coordinating DHB policy and at introducing common approaches in<lb/> terms of recruitment and planning. In 2003, DHBNZ developed an overarching &quot; Workforce Action Plan &quot; ,<lb/> which focuses on information, relationships and strategic capability. In 2004/5, DHBNZ developed a<lb/> &quot; Future Workforce Project &quot; focusing on DHB collective priorities and actions for health workforce<lb/> development in the next five years. Eight priorities were identified aiming at nurturing and sustaining the<lb/> workforce or developing workforce capacity. Although, DHBNZ acts more as a facilitator, it has a<lb/> potential to play a greater role in reinforcing coordination between the different stakeholders and in<lb/> insuring workforce development.<lb/> 40.<lb/> While health workforce policy has been the object of greater attention in New Zealand over the<lb/> past decade, at the same time, the growing number of stakeholders involved in health workforce policy<lb/> developments has contributed, to a certain extent, to a fragmentation and to some duplication of activities<lb/> in health workforce planning. Furthermore, despite its intrinsic value the role attributed to health workforce<lb/> planning remains an issue of debate (Box 3).<lb/></p>

			<figure>Box 3. Which role for health workforce planning?<lb/></figure>

			<p>Health workforce planning is advocated by many to facilitate the attainment of an adequate supply of health personnel<lb/> in order to meet population demand for health. In fact, all OECD countries are involved, to different degrees, in health<lb/> workforce planning activities.<lb/> Indeed, there are also a number of relevant reasons, related to health labor market particularities and complexities,<lb/> explaining why public intervention in health workforce management can be of social value. One important reason is<lb/> that medical education is expensive and an oversupply of medical doctors does generate a significant social cost.<lb/> Another reason is the time lag in medical education. Supply adjustment for medical doctors is not immediate as it can<lb/> take up to 10 or more to train a medical specialist. Such lags may cause cycles of alternate shortages and surpluses of<lb/> health workforce, in particular doctors. Specific policies, for instance through various set of incentives, can play a major<lb/> role in minimizing the cyclical imbalances in the health labour market. But planning health labour supply is not an easy<lb/> task and no single country has found the key to solving disparities between health workforce supply and demand<lb/> (<ref type="biblio">Kolars, 2001</ref>).<lb/> First, fixing numerical limits essentially supposes a solid capacity to anticipate future demand. This seldom proves to<lb/> be an easy task and there are many examples of prophecies of shortages or over-supply which never materialise.<lb/> Uncertainties related to future population health needs and technological progress, as well as methodological<lb/> sensitivity, contribute to weaken forecasting exercises. As a result, health workforce planning may mainly serve as a<lb/> broad-brush tool.<lb/> Also, while workforce planning could represent a promising area to consider the dynamic between domestic training<lb/> and international recruitment, this is rarely the case. In the United Kingdom, the period from 1999 to 2005 was one of<lb/> unprecedented staffing growth for the NHS in England, fuelled by the availability of significant growth in funding which<lb/> resulted in increasing international recruitment and enhanced domestic training capacity. However, financial deficits<lb/> emerged in the NHS from 2004-05 onwards, attributed, in part at least, to the costs of workforce expansion (House of<lb/> <ref type="biblio">Commons, Health Committee, 2007</ref>). The deficits have, in turn driven a sudden downturn in workforce size. This<lb/> situation has exposed a disconnection between financial planning and workforce planning. It also shows, to some<lb/> extent, the lack of coordination between migration and domestic training polices as a larger numbers of UK based<lb/> graduates have more difficulties entering the health care labour market (<ref type="biblio">Buchan, 2007</ref>).<lb/></p>

(2001) Forecasting physician supply and demand, Medical<lb/> Education 35(5), 424-425.<lb/> 10<lb/> DHBNZ was formed by all 21 District Health Boards in December 2000 to provide a sector group through<lb/> which DHBs could coordinate their activities at a national level. The overall purpose of DHBNZ is to assist<lb/> DHBs in meeting their objectives.<lb/></figure>

			<head>2.2 Education policies and recognition of foreign qualification<lb/></head>

			<p>41.<lb/> Decisions about the number and the type of health workers trained are critical and affect the<lb/> development of the health workforce. In addition, in the context of New Zealand, given the importance of<lb/> foreign-trained health workers, it is important to have a good understanding of the condition of their<lb/> insertion in the health workforce. In the following, medical and nursing education pathways will be<lb/> examined, as well as the process for the recognition of foreign qualifications.<lb/></p>

			<head>Medical Education<lb/> 42.<lb/> Undergraduate medical education in New Zealand spans six years and is provided by two<lb/></head>

			<p>universities, Auckland and Otago (<ref type="biblio">MoH, 2006b</ref>). This is followed by pre-vocational training that lasts two<lb/> years (PGY 1, PGY 2) or more. It corresponds to a transitional period into professional practice,<lb/> recognised with a registration in a general scope of practice with the Medical Council. Then, once a choice<lb/> for a specific area of medicine is made, vocational training needs to be completed in order to be recognised<lb/> by the relevant Medical College. The last phase lasts between three years for general practice to eight years<lb/> for some hospital specialties (see</p>

			<figure>Annex 2)<lb/> 43.<lb/> Various actors are involved in the funding of medical education in New Zealand. Funding is<lb/> mainly provided by the Education Ministry through the Tertiary Education Commission (TEC), by the<lb/> Ministry of Health through the Clinical Training Agency (CTA), and by the DHBs. While medical<lb/> education until graduation is funded by the TEC, the internship (1 or 2 years) and the postgraduate training<lb/> are mainly funded by the CTA. To a lesser extent, DHBs also play a role in postgraduate training. In 2002,<lb/> it was estimated that 121 million NZ$ (1US$ = 2.16 NZ$, 2002) was spent on medical education and<lb/> clinical training (MoH, 2006b). While TEC expenses on undergraduate education represented 43 million<lb/> NZ$, CTA expenditures on clinical training represented 62.9 million NZ$, and DHBs expenditures 15<lb/> million NZ$. There seems to be some lack of coordination between the Ministry of Education and the<lb/> Ministry of Health. Some claim that there is a lack of global vision for medical education, and argue, for<lb/> instance, that there is a mismatch between the number of available vocational positions (funded by the<lb/> Ministry of Health) and the actual number of medical students starting vocational training (the number of<lb/> medical students is determined by the Ministry of Education).<lb/> 44.<lb/> A recent report by the Health Workforce Taskforce (March 2007) emphasises, among other<lb/> things, (i) the need for further cooperation in the field of education and training of medical practitioners<lb/> through the creation of a Medical Training Board and (ii) that &quot; the number of medical graduates produced<lb/> by the training system be increased to ensure that New Zealand moves towards achieving ongoing self-<lb/>sufficiency for its medical workforce &quot; .<lb/> 45.<lb/> One major characteristic of the medical education system that New Zealand shares with other<lb/> OECD countries is the capped system on funded places for domestic students. The intake of first-year<lb/> students is currently fixed at 325 (TEC, personal communication, 2006). The government quota has been<lb/> lifted twice in the past 20 years. In 1987, the intake at Otago was lifted from 150 to 170 students, and again<lb/> in 2004, to 190. The University of Auckland had its quota raised from 115 to the current figure of 135 in<lb/> 2004 (TEC, personal communication, 2006). The increase in the quotas in 2004 aimed at allowing more<lb/> students from rural areas in medical schools. In addition to the 325 domestic students, about 30-40<lb/> international students are admitted each year. These students pay the full cost of their studies, which<lb/> represents a source of revenue for the University. These students mainly come from the Middle East and<lb/> most are funded by their government. Most students return to their country after graduation, despite the<lb/> fact that for foreign-born medical students completing their degree in New Zealand, it would be relatively<lb/> easy to stay on a permanent basis in New Zealand.<lb/> 46.<lb/> Between 1986 and 2006, the number of medical graduates increased from 228 to 322 per year<lb/> (see Chart 10).Most of the jump in the number of graduates occurred post 1990, presumably a lagged effect<lb/> of the first relaxation of the numerus clausus rule in the late 1980s. Presumably, the second relaxation in<lb/> 2004 will see a further jump in the number of graduates from 2010 on. New Zealand tends to have lower<lb/> graduation rates than most OECD countries. While the average graduation rate per 100 000 population in<lb/> New Zealand is estimated at 7.9 between 1995 and 2004, the corresponding figure for the OECD amounted<lb/> to approximately 9.4 (OECD, 2006). For New Zealand, a graduation rate of 9.4 per 100 000 population<lb/> would correspond to 365 graduates per year, as compared to the average of 305 between 1995 and 2004<lb/> (see Chart 11)—equivalent in a steady-state (and assuming no attrition) to a 12% increase in the current<lb/> annual intake to medical schools.<lb/> Chart 10.

Indeed, recruitment and retention<lb/> problems within academic medicine are common. This persistent problem is largely attributed to higher<lb/> salaries proposed by DHBs. Salary gaps in 2005 between university health professionals involved in<lb/> medical education and health professionals employed by DHBs to deliver health services were estimated at<lb/> between 30 and 60 000 NZ$ (1US$ = 1.42 NZ$, 2005) (<ref type="biblio">MoH, 2006b</ref>). However, the recent wage increases<lb/> in favour of faculty members should contribute to ease such recruitment and retention difficulties.<lb/> 48.<lb/> Although medical education is largely subsidized by the government for domestic students, the<lb/> increasing indebtedness of students is a source of widespread concern and discussion (HWAC<ref type="biblio">, 2005;<lb/> Moore et al., 2006a; Pole, 2006</ref>), and is thought to play a role in the choice of the medical specialty and<lb/> even in out-migration.<lb/> 49.<lb/> The cost of undergraduate medical education in 2002 was estimated at 199 000 NZ$, of which<lb/> 71% is met by the Government and 29% by the student (<ref type="biblio">MoH, 2006b</ref>). This represents about 10 000 NZ$<lb/> per year. As a result, students usually take out a loan in order to pay the fees and to cover their living<lb/> expenses. At the end of their studies, they may end up with a large debt, about 70-80 000 NZ$ for doctors<lb/> and even more for dentists.<lb/> 50.<lb/> <ref type="biblio">Moore et al. (2006b)</ref> found that indebtedness was a key element for those considering emigration<lb/> to Australia or to other countries where wages are higher, so that they can reimburse their debt more easily.<lb/> Student indebtedness is also said to play an important role in the choice of medical specialty. For a<lb/> substantial number of medical graduates, debt was one of the main factors explaining the lack of<lb/> attractiveness of work areas like general practice, public health and psychiatry.<lb/> 51.<lb/> The debt issue is abundantly debated and various measures have been adopted to address this<lb/> concern. They include the introduction by the government of a capped rate of student loan interest at 7% in<lb/> an effort to give greater certainty to students, the institution of a &quot; step-up scholarship &quot; that provides a<lb/> significant subsidy to tuition fees, and more recently, an interest write-off for graduates choosing to stay in<lb/> New Zealand (<ref type="biblio">Pole, 2006</ref>). However, at the same time, those efforts are partially off-set by the Universities<lb/> continual increase of medical fees. Policies of writing off interest for students are also criticised by some<lb/> who claim that it does not represent an efficient allocation of public resources and might encourage more<lb/> borrowing and slower repayment.<lb/></p>

			<head>Nursing and midwifery education<lb/></head>

			<p>52.<lb/> In contrast to medical education, the number of places in nursing and midwifery schools is<lb/> demand-driven although the availability of clinical placements has constrained enrolments. However, from<lb/> 2008, the demand-driven system will be replaced by a global budget system under which each University<lb/> will submit a budget proposal to the TEC.<lb/></p>

			<figure>53.<lb/> Registered nurses in New Zealand, the largest nursing category, are educated via a three-year<lb/> Bachelor of Nursing degree. There are 16 educational institutions offering programs leading to<lb/> registration 11 . Due to this relatively large number of nursing educational institutions and the low number of<lb/> students, in particular in rural areas, concern about the average quality of nursing training programmes has<lb/> been expressed in New Zealand. However, closing nursing programmes in rural areas is seen as difficult,<lb/> since it is likely to make rural recruitment more difficult.<lb/> 54.<lb/> By contrast to medical graduates, over the past decade, the number of nursing graduates has<lb/> decreased, from 1 485 in 1996 to 1 206 in 2004. The number of nursing graduates per 100 000 population<lb/> is slightly below the OECD average, 31.8 per 100 000 population in New Zealand against 32.8 for the<lb/> OECD (see charts 12 and 13).<lb/> Chart 12.

Enrolled Nurses were<lb/> educated in employer-based programmes under the Nurses Act 1977. However, these programmes were<lb/> discontinued by health boards in 1993. The Health Practitioners Competence Assurance Act 2003 (Box 4)<lb/> saw the reinstatement of a second-level nursing programme in educational institutions under a new scope<lb/> of practice and title, Nurse Assistant. Since 2004, the Enrolled Nurse scope of practice has not been open<lb/> for new applicants.Applicants from that date are registered as Nurse Assistants. There are approximately<lb/> 3 800 Enrolled Nurses in New Zealand (New Zealand Health Information Service, 2004). Enrolled Nurses<lb/> work under the direction of a Registered Nurse or Midwife. The responsibilities of Enrolled Nurses include<lb/> assisting patients with the activities of daily living and performing delegated interventions from the nursing<lb/> or midwifery care plan.<lb/> 56.<lb/> Currently, there are about 135 nurse assistants in New Zealand (North, personal communication,<lb/> 2007). Nurse assistants represent a &quot; second-tier person &quot; working under the supervision of a registered<lb/> nurse or midwife in a range of areas. They deliver nursing care to individuals in community, residential<lb/> and hospital settings. To become a nurse assistant, it is compulsory to follow a program length of 1000<lb/> hours, with the students required to complete a minimum of 350 hours theory and 650 hours practice.<lb/> Nurse Assistants are prepared in polytechnic institutes. There are three nurse assistant programmes in New<lb/> Zealand with further programmes under consideration 12 .<lb/> 57.<lb/> Another new category is that of Nurse Practitioner. Legislation establishing Nurse Practitioner<lb/> was enacted in September 2005. Nurse practitioners have an expanded nursing role in clinical settings. In<lb/> addition, they have developed the skills and knowledge to expand their role to include tasks that may have<lb/> been &apos;traditionally&apos; performed by other health professionals, such as prescribing medications and ordering<lb/> diagnostic tests (Nursing Council, 2006). There are only about 40 individuals practising as Nurse<lb/> Practitioners within New Zealand. To become a nurse practitioner, one should be on the nursing register,<lb/> have a minimum of four years of experience in a specific area of practice, have a Masters Degree, and have<lb/> 12<lb/> Northland Polytechnic (aged care) and Christchurch Polytechnic Institute of Technology (long term and<lb/> rehabilitation care).<lb/></figure>

			<p>passed the Nursing Council assessment of Nurse Practitioner competencies and criteria. There are six<lb/> master programmes to become a Nurse Practitioner in New Zealand and there is an education equivalences<lb/> process available to those who have not undertaken one of these approved programmes 13 .<lb/> 58.<lb/> As for midwifery, pre-registration education is through a three-year Bachelor of Midwifery<lb/> programme. There are five pre-registration midwifery programmes in New Zealand 14 . Students are mainly<lb/> direct entry (i.e. with no previous health profession education). However, a midwife may also be a<lb/> registered general and obstetric or comprehensive nurse who has undertaken further education to gain<lb/> midwifery qualifications. Midwifery students who hold a previous nursing registration or those with other<lb/> degrees or other relevant experience are likely to gain credit under these policies and complete a shorter<lb/> programme (New Zealand College of <ref type="biblio">Midwives, 2006</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<head>Box 4: The Health Practitioners Competence Assurance Act 2003<lb/></head>

			<p>Health professionals are regulated professions and registration is essential to practise. A new approach towards<lb/> health profession regulation was adopted with the Health Practitioners Competence Assurance (HPCA) Act 2003<lb/> which came into effect in 2004. While the main purpose of the Act is to protect the public from harm and applies only to<lb/> those practitioners where there is a risk of harm, this act differs from previous legislations. The main differences are<lb/> the extension of the ongoing competency requirements, which applied previously to only the medical profession, to<lb/> other regulated professions; a certification regime for all professions which allows for flexibility in the overall health<lb/> workforce; the delegation to the registration authorities of all clinical decision-making to allow them to respond to<lb/> changing circumstances without the need for legislative change; the introduction of scopes of practice to allow the<lb/> development of new roles; and the separation of the registration function from the disciplinary function. The HPCA Act<lb/> applies to all registered health practitioners including medical practitioners (doctors, surgeons and other specialists),<lb/> dentists, midwives, nurses, pharmacists, physiotherapists, podiatrists and psychologists.<lb/></p>

			<p>Under the HPCA act, &apos;scopes of practice&apos; are used to describe the tasks performed by a professional group,<lb/> instead of &quot; areas of specialty &quot; as was previously the case. For instance, under the HPCA, the previous nursing<lb/> registers have been replaced by four scopes of practice: registered nurse, nurse practitioner, nurse assistant and<lb/> enrolled nurse. As mentioned earlier, enrolled nurses who graduated before 2000 keep their previous title, but those<lb/> educated after 2000 have the title of nurse assistant. The act also established the separate Midwifery Council (from the<lb/> Nursing Council) which has jurisdiction over the education, registration, discipline and competence of all midwives in<lb/> New Zealand.<lb/> A review of the operation of the Act is underway to identify implementation issues requiring any further changes.<lb/></p>

			<head>Recognition of foreign-medical qualifications<lb/></head>

			<p>59.<lb/> Overseas health professionals must meet both the immigration requirements set by the<lb/> immigration services and the registration requirements set by professional bodies. Until the mid 90s, there<lb/> were no real links between the immigration process and the foreign recognitions of qualification. At that<lb/> 13<lb/></p>

			<p>Auckland University of Technology (Master of Health Science in Advanced Nursing Practice), Eastern<lb/> Institute of Technology (Master of Nursing), Massey University (Master of Nursing), Otago Polytechnic<lb/> (Master of Nursing), The University of Auckland (Master of Nursing), University of Otago (Christchurch<lb/> School of Medicine).<lb/> time, New Zealand was keen to attract skilled and highly qualified people and passing the minimum-point<lb/> threshold for immigration gave an automatic right to settle in New Zealand. However, despite being<lb/> granted residence on the basis of their qualifications, a number of highly skilled individuals, including<lb/> doctors, did not meet standards set down by the relevant professional bodies in order to practise in New<lb/> Zealand. Hence, highly skilled permanent immigrants faced increasing difficulties in finding jobs which<lb/> matched their qualification and foreign work experience.<lb/> 60.<lb/> In 1995, the policy for skilled migrants was refined, with increased emphasis on the<lb/> transferability of human capability to New Zealand, via for example, qualification recognition, English-<lb/>language ability, etc. As a result, even if requirements are separate, there is now a more harmonized<lb/> approach between the immigration and registration process. In most of cases, eligibility for registration or<lb/> registration is required in order to qualify for skilled immigration. The sequence in general is as follows for<lb/> health professionals wanting to work in New Zealand: be eligible for registration or be registered, have a<lb/> job offer, obtain a work or residency permit. Most of the time, eligibility for registration is also a pre-<lb/>requisite for the work or residency permit. However, registration is not a pre-requisite for individuals<lb/> migrating to New Zealand through the family or the international humanitarian stream. Available evidence<lb/> suggests that few humanitarian immigrants have medical qualifications, although the situation is less clear<lb/> for nursing.<lb/></p>

			<figure>61.<lb/> The New Zealand Censuses of Population and Dwelling show that employment rates of people<lb/> aged 15-64 with post school qualifications in the medical field (results are similar for nursing and<lb/> midwifery studies) tend to have high employment rates but that people born in Asia and those originating<lb/> from non-English-speaking European countries face more difficulties to integrate in the labour market<lb/> (Chart 14). Part of the discrepancy may be due to difficulties in getting qualifications recognised, but more<lb/> in-depth studies would be needed here to ascertain this point. In any case the improvements recorded<lb/> between 2001 and 2006 may reveal that this is less of an issue than it was in the past.<lb/></figure>

			<p>62.<lb/> The Medical Council of New Zealand is responsible for the registration of doctors in New<lb/> Zealand. Getting registered can be done via several routes depending on the country in which the medical<lb/> degree was obtained, previous work experience and purpose of the stay (Box 5). The first pre-requisite is to<lb/> meet English-language requirements, as determined by the International English Language Testing System<lb/> (IELTS). Individuals graduated in the United Kingdom or Ireland and with one-year of clinical experience<lb/> can get provisional general registration. For individuals who graduated in other countries, a pass in<lb/> USMLE 15 steps one and two is required to prove medical knowledge. Furthermore, they must also pass the<lb/> New Zealand registration examination (the NZREX clinical) to demonstrate clinical ability. Provisional<lb/> registration can also be obtained by individuals who worked continuously for at least three years in a health<lb/> system considered as comparable 16 . As for vocational registration, it applies for individuals with training<lb/> and experience as a specialist overseas.<lb/></p>

			<head>Box 5. Type of medical registration<lb/></head>

			<p>Provisional general: All new registrants, regardless of seniority, must work under supervision for at least their first 12<lb/> months in New Zealand to become familiar with the culture. During this time they are registered within a provisional<lb/> general scope of practice and their performance will be assessed by senior colleagues. They will be required to<lb/> complete certain requirements to be registered within a general scope. The only exception to this supervised period is<lb/> for New Zealand and Australian graduates who have already completed their internship in Australia.<lb/></p>

			<p>General: A doctor who has completed the requirements of a provisional general scope will be registered within a<lb/> general scope of practice. Examples are junior doctors who have completed their first post-graduate year and may be<lb/> in vocational training, doctors who have not started, or have chosen not to do, vocational training, or doctors nearing<lb/> retirement who no longer meet the requirements for registration within a vocational scope of practice. The doctor must<lb/> establish a professional collegial relationship with another doctor who is registered within the same or related<lb/> vocational scope, and must participate in appropriate continuing professional development to maintain and improve<lb/> competence and to be recertified each year.<lb/></p>

			<figure>Provisional vocational: Doctors who have completed their vocational training and who are not already registered in<lb/> New Zealand must work under supervision for at least 12 months. They are registered within a provisional vocational<lb/> scope of practice. During this time they must complete Council&apos;s requirements for registration in a vocational scope.<lb/> Those requirements may include working in a formal assessment position and/or passing an examination.<lb/></figure>

			<p>Vocational: A doctor who has completed his or her vocational training as a consultant and has appropriate<lb/> qualifications and experience can be registered within a vocational scope of practice. These vocational scopes are<lb/> recognised by the medical Council. A doctor registered in a vocational scope must participate in an approved<lb/> continuing professional development programme to maintain competence and be recertified each year.<lb/></p>

			<p>Special purpose scope: A doctor who satisfies the registration criteria to visit New Zealand for one of the following<lb/> defined and specific reasons will be registered within a special purpose scope of practice: i.e. as a visiting expert; as a<lb/> sponsored trainee; for post-graduate training and/or experience; as a medical researcher; as a locum specialist<lb/> working in New Zealand for less than six months; to help in an emergency, or for any other reason approved by<lb/> Council.<lb/></p>

			<p>These doctors will be required to work under supervision for the duration of their employment or appointment. This<lb/> &apos;special purpose&apos; scope of practice is not a pathway to permanent registration.<lb/> Source: New Zealand Medical Council<lb/> 63.<lb/> The Nursing Council of New Zealand is responsible for the recognition of qualifications of<lb/> foreign-educated nurses. The main principles governing registration include that the applicant has<lb/> undertaken a nursing programme that is similar in all specified content and length to the equivalent<lb/> programme in New Zealand, and is able to speak and write in the English language when English is not the<lb/> applicant&apos;s first language. Tests recognised by the Nursing Council are CGNFS, IELTS, and OET. As<lb/> international recruitment is regulated by both immigration and registration proceedings, the registration<lb/> process can also be used to facilitate or discourage immigration. For instance, the required minimum level<lb/> for the IELTS has been raised: a score of not less than 7 in each of the four sections of the exam is now<lb/> required instead of an overall average 7 previously. As a result, registration is more difficult for overseas<lb/> nurses. Applicants who do not meet the requirements for nursing registration may be required to undergo<lb/> further training within a New Zealand educational institution.<lb/></p>

			<head>2.3 National and international recruitment<lb/></head>

			<p>64.<lb/> Although there has been a substantial increase in the number of health workers over the past<lb/> decades in New Zealand, the increasing dependency on foreign health worker is fuelling concerns on<lb/> health worker shortages.<lb/></p>

			<head>Estimating—and responding to—shortages of health personnel<lb/></head>

			<p>65.<lb/> Whether or not a shortage of health workers exists is a critical question but the answer to this<lb/> question tends to vary according to the approaches adopted or to the stakeholder perspective. Nonetheless,<lb/> it is commonly agreed that difficulties do prevail in recruiting nurses and medical practitioners, in<lb/> particular for some medical and nursing specialties, and more generally, in rural areas.<lb/> 66.<lb/> One tool to evaluate and monitor shortages is the Job Vacancy Monitor (JVM) system of the<lb/> Department of Labour (Box 6). The JVM is a monthly analysis of job advertisements published in selected<lb/> newspapers. Their assessment of occupations for 2006 indicate that skill shortages for health professionals<lb/> (excluding nurses and midwives) remain severe with only 41% of advertised vacancies being filled<lb/> (Department of <ref type="biblio">Labour, 2007</ref>). Nurses and midwives moved out of the extreme shortage category in 2006,<lb/> but remain difficult for employers to find, with a little over half the advertised vacancies being filled. On<lb/> this basis, it was considered that there is not a genuine shortage of individuals with the required skills in<lb/> nursing despite employers having considerable difficulty filling vacancies for nurses and midwives<lb/> (Department of <ref type="biblio">Labour, 2005b</ref>). Recently, there has been a slight easing of the health labour market: JVM<lb/> data recorded a decline of 12% in advertised vacancies between 2005 and 2006 for the highly skilled in the<lb/> health sector (Department of <ref type="biblio">Labour, 2006</ref>) 17 . However, skill shortages appear to be chronic for some<lb/> specialities like anaesthetics, radiology, obstetrics, and psychiatric nurses.<lb/></p>

			<figure>Box 6. Job Vacancy Monitoring Programme<lb/> The Job Vacancy Monitoring Programme is designed to provide new insights into skill shortages in New Zealand. It<lb/> aims to identify which skilled occupations are in shortage, and to better understand the supply and demand forces<lb/> contributing to these shortages. The programme currently consists of three components:<lb/> Job Vacancy Monitor: a monthly analysis of job advertisements appearing in 25 daily newspapers and two IT internet<lb/> job boards. This component started from November 2002.<lb/> A Survey of Employers who have Recently Advertised (SERA), with two sub-components:<lb/> SERA Extensive: a large sample survey of employers to establish whether the advertised positions were filled, and<lb/> the number and suitability of applicants.<lb/> SERA Intensive: an in-depth survey of a small number of employers who advertised vacancies in occupations in<lb/> shortage to gain an understanding of the forces contributing to the shortage.<lb/></figure>

			<p>Occupation reports: The results of the SERA surveys are analysed together with other data sources to form a series of<lb/> occupational reports, produced on an annual basis.<lb/> Source: Department of Labour, http://www.dol.govt.nz/publications/jvm/<lb/> 67.<lb/> DHBs which employ the majority of health professionals in New Zealand play a key role in<lb/> recruitment. Until recently, each DHB was recruiting on its own, creating some competition between them,<lb/> and leading to some inefficiency in the recruitment process from a national perspective. Common<lb/> approaches of recruitment between DHBs are now favored, especially for international recruitment. For<lb/> 17<lb/> There are, however, a number of limitations in using vacancy data. In general, vacancy rates may<lb/> understate the extent of shortages. There may be &quot; suppressed &quot; vacancies (where a post is not advertised<lb/> because management has no expectation of successful recruitment), and &quot; hidden &quot; vacancies (where a post<lb/> is filled, but by an individual with insufficient skills or experience to successfully meet the requirements of<lb/> the job). In addition, there seems to be room for more collaboration between the</p>

			<table>Department of Labour and<lb/> the Ministry of Health (and other institutions involved in health workforce planning) regarding the<lb/> identification of health worker shortages.<lb/> instance, efforts are developing to better share information on health personnel needs across DHBs or by<lb/> pooling resources for recruitment, and also to develop a brand in order to facilitate global recruitment for<lb/> New Zealand. Recruitment agencies are not playing a significant role for international recruitment in New<lb/> Zealand, but the Department of Labour has a Relationship Management Team aiming at organising expos<lb/> and recruitment campaigns abroad.<lb/> 68.<lb/> Among the policies to improve recruitment, remuneration and financial incentives are among the<lb/> most common. Information on the employment status of doctors and nurses indicates that the average wage<lb/> in medicine in 2001 was 62 000 NZ$ (<ref type="biblio">Maré and Liang, 2006</ref>). The mean income in the field of medicine is<lb/> comparable in New Zealand with accounting and law and legal studies.<lb/> 69.<lb/> Until 2000, every hospital would negotiate individually with their employees. Now, health<lb/> workers employed by DHBs have common contracts through the Multi-Employer Collective Agreement<lb/> (MECA). As the wage has been aligned on the Auckland DHB MECA, most doctors and nurses have seen<lb/> their wage increased, except those in Auckland. Medical specialists have also benefited from wage<lb/> increases due to the competition between DHBs to recruit them. As for nurses, they have benefited recently<lb/> from a substantial wage increase. However, most international studies investigating the labour supply<lb/> decisions of nurses tend to find that, at least in the short-run, nursing labour supply appears to be fairly<lb/> unresponsive to wage change (<ref type="biblio">Shield, 2004; Chiha and Link, 2003; Antonazzo et al., 2003</ref>). In other<lb/> words, an increase in the wage does not necessarily lead to a substantial increase in labour participation in<lb/> the short-run.<lb/> 70.<lb/> Another type of approach to address potential shortages is through the development of a flexible<lb/> workforce in New Zealand. In particular, as noted above, the use of nurse practitioners has been<lb/> encouraged but this promising initiative is still in its infancy since only 40 nurse practitioners have been<lb/> trained so far, and not all are in employment which fully used their training and skills.<lb/></p>

			<head>International recruitments: immigration policy as a management tool of the health workforce?<lb/></head>

			<p>71.<lb/> In terms of international recruitment of health workers, New Zealand has no specific migration<lb/> programmes. Health professional migration policy is defined in the context of skilled migration. However,<lb/> for those professions listed on shortage occupation lists which include most health professions,<lb/> immigration is facilitated. The fact that shortage occupation lists are used in immigration policy illustrates<lb/> that health workforce concerns are integrated, to a certain extent, in the immigration policy.<lb/> 72.<lb/> Immigration plays an important role in building New Zealand society. The proportion of foreign-<lb/>born population in New Zealand is one of the highest among OECD countries, at 19.4% in <ref type="biblio">2005 (OECD,<lb/> 2007</ref>). Over the past 20 years, the number of individuals migrating to New Zealand has increased and<lb/> diversified. While Europe and Australia still represent the main source countries, Asia is playing a bigger<lb/> role.<lb/> 73.<lb/> New Zealand immigration policy has undergone various changes. Major changes in the selective<lb/> migration policy were introduced, notably in 1995, which aimed at better taking into account language<lb/> proficiency, implementing recognition of qualifications and prioritizing those with a job offer. In recent<lb/> years, the usual distinction between temporary and permanent migrants was questioned. As a result, the<lb/> principles and the procedure governing the permanent migration program were amended to give priority to<lb/> people with New Zealand experience and qualifications, creating bridges between temporary and<lb/> permanent programs. These changes have had a significant impact on the ability of foreign students to stay<lb/> in New Zealand after graduation. In 2005, about 30% of those who entered with a temporary permit in<lb/> 2002 gained permanent residence in New Zealand (<ref type="biblio">DoL, The Migration Trend, 2006</ref>).<lb/> 74.<lb/> The number and composition of permanent residence migration inflow is set annually with regard<lb/> to a range of factors, including the impact of a given level of approval on the economy, social cohesion and<lb/> infrastructure, and the desirability of stability (<ref type="biblio">New Zealand High Commission, 2003</ref>). In 2005/6, around<lb/> 52 000 people were approved for permanent New Zealand residence. Basically there are three entry routes<lb/> to permanent migration to New Zealand: (i) Skilled/Business, (ii) Family Sponsored and (iii) International<lb/> Humanitarian.<lb/> 75.<lb/> The Skilled Migrant Category (SMC) represents the main path to residence, as over half of all<lb/> people approved in 2005/6 gained residence through this category. To be eligible in the skilled migration<lb/> category, one must be under 55 years old and score at least 100 points in their Expression of Interest<lb/> (people with 140 points or more are automatically selected). 18 Additional points are given to occupations,<lb/> recognised prior to arrival, that are included in the Long-<ref type="biblio">Term</ref> Skill Shortage List (LTSSL) (Box 7). This<lb/> list includes almost all health occupations. Additional bonus points are also granted for an employment<lb/> offer for the regions outside Auckland, and for work experience in New Zealand. In 2005/06, 220 doctors<lb/> and 780 nurses entered through the Skill Migrant Category. Figures for the previous year were respectively<lb/> 320 and 920 (see Annex 3).<lb/> Box 7. Occupational Shortage Lists<lb/> The Department of Labour currently maintains two occupational shortage lists: the Immediate Skill Shortage List<lb/> (ISSL), formerly the Occupational Shortage List (OSL) and the Long-Term Skill Shortage List (LTSSL), formerly the<lb/> Priority Occupation List (POL). The ISSL and the LTSSL are reviewed biannually by the Department of Labour. During<lb/> the review, submissions are sought from industry groups about both the nature and extent of skill shortages in their<lb/> area.<lb/></figure>

			<p>The ISSL Skill Shortage List contains professions which are currently in high demand in New Zealand and lists the<lb/> qualifications and /or experience required for work permits and the recommended standard for work permit applicants<lb/> with an offer of employment.<lb/></p>

			<p>The LTSS List contains professions which are currently in extraordinarily high demand in New Zealand and lists the<lb/> qualifications and /or experience required for residence permits and bonus points under the Skilled Migrant Category<lb/> From an employer&apos;s point of view, the occupation shortage lists obviate the need to demonstrate that there is no New<lb/> Zealand citizen or resident available suitably qualified by training and experience to do the job offered. Therefore, once<lb/> a job has been offered to a potential employee, the person will be able to obtain a work visa or permit provided that<lb/> they have the recognized skills and qualifications.<lb/> 76.<lb/> As for temporary migration, one important category for health professionals is the &quot; Work to<lb/> Residence &quot; , which allows getting a work visa as a step towards gaining permanent residence. A major<lb/> entry route for the &quot; Work to Residence &quot; is the &quot; Talent Program &quot; . It includes the case of a person with a job<lb/> offer from an accredited employer (most DHBs are accredited employers) and listed on the LTSSL. In this<lb/> situation the employer can recruit directly from abroad for a period up to two years renewable and<lb/> transferable to a permanent permit. A person with a job offer which is included in the ISSL (most medical<lb/> occupations are also included in this list) can get the same type of work permit without having to pass a<lb/> labour market test. In other cases, the employer must demonstrate that there are no suitably qualified<lb/> and/or experienced New Zealand citizens or residents available to do the job. In 2005/06, there were about<lb/> 1 470 work applications approved for medical doctors and 1 060 for nurses. The latter is on the decrease as<lb/> 18<lb/></p>

			<p>All individuals meeting the criteria are then pooled and ranked according to specific selection criteria.<lb/> People who score between 100 and 140 points and have a job or job offer in New Zealand will be selected<lb/> in sufficient number to meet the New Zealand Immigration Programme numbers. However, not all eligible<lb/> individuals in the pool will necessarily be invited to apply for residence. Individuals who are not invited to<lb/> apply for residence remain in the pool for three months. If they are not selected after this period, they can<lb/> lodge a new Expression of Interest.<lb/></p>

			<head>compared to previous years (1 350 in 2004 and 1 630 in 2003) while</head>

			<p>the former is mostly stable (see<lb/> Annex 3).<lb/> 77.<lb/> Finally, another entry route is the &quot; Working Holiday Scheme &quot; . This program is for individuals<lb/> aged between 18 and 30 years who aim to experience life in New Zealand (about 28 500 persons were<lb/> granted this type of visa in 2005/06). People entering through this route are able to work for part of their<lb/> total permit duration whose maximum period is two years. There are about 25 bilateral agreements with<lb/> origin countries for this program which is capped except for the United Kingdom, Germany, Japan, the<lb/> Netherlands, Norway and Sweden. It seems that some medical doctors, notably from the United Kingdom,<lb/> enter through this route, mainly for temporary stay.<lb/></p>

			<figure>78.<lb/> In New Zealand, international recruitment of health workers is important as illustrated on a long<lb/> period by registration data 19 . It accounted for over 80% of annual registrations of doctors over the period<lb/> 2002-2005, and over 50% of all nursing registrations (New Zealand Medical Council, 2006; New Zealand<lb/> Nursing Council, 2006). The annual number of overseas registrations of medical practitioners rose from<lb/> 452 in 1990 to 1 414 in 2005.<lb/></figure>

			<p>79.<lb/> Over time, the main source countries have remained relatively similar, with the exception of<lb/> South Africa. For the latter, there has been a large increase in medical migration, especially in 1995, which<lb/> was associated with the end of Apartheid. However, concern expressed about the brain drain by the South<lb/> African authorities has led to a decrease in active recruitment from South Africa thereafter. More<lb/> generally, concern about the impact of migration on lower income source countries has led New Zealand to<lb/> sign the Commonwealth Code of Practice for the International Recruitment of Health Workers.<lb/></p>

At the same time, new<lb/> source countries are emerging. There has been a significant increase in the yearly registration of Filipino-<lb/>trained nurses in recent years (from around 50 in 2000 to 150 in 2005). Also, registration from nurses<lb/> trained in India and Zimbabwe has become more important. While almost no registrations were recorded in<lb/> New Zealand from nurses trained in India and Zimbabwe in 2000, registrations from each of these<lb/> countries reached 100 in 2005. By contrast, yearly registrations from nurses trained in South Africa have<lb/> significantly diminished (from 200 in 2001 to around 50 in 2005).<lb/></figure>

			<p>81.<lb/> Over time, there has been an increasing use of temporary migration which has given rise to a<lb/> large number of short-term stays of health workers in New Zealand, in particular for doctors. For instance,<lb/> temporary registration 20 for medical doctors rose from 165 in 1990 to 758 in 2003 (HWAC, 2005).<lb/> 82.<lb/> A number of short stays are doctors coming for a locum in rural areas. In rural areas, where<lb/> recruitment difficulties are particularly notable, especially for general practitioners, special programs have<lb/> been developed. For instance, the New Zealand Rural General Practice Network, a not-for-profit society, is<lb/> representing the interests of rural general practice and, in particular, the rural health workforce. It<lb/> developed to help the recruitment for long-term services or for short-term locum services in rural areas. In<lb/> particular, the locum program is rather successful in helping to replace doctors when they are on<lb/> continuous training or on holiday.<lb/></p>

			<head>2.4 Retention and emigration<lb/></head>

			<p>83.<lb/> Retention is also a critical element in health workforce policy as staff turnover has a cost.<lb/> Moreover, in the context of New Zealand, as mentioned before, emigration is significant, particularly to<lb/> Australia and the United Kingdom, and thus retention and return migration is an important issue.<lb/></p>

			<head>Retention and turnover in the workforce<lb/></head>

			<p>84.<lb/> For nurses, turnover across DHBs is estimated to range between 12% and 25% (<ref type="biblio">North et al.,<lb/> 2006a</ref>). Higher turnover occurs in DHBs in metropolitan areas, areas where there is high competition for<lb/> nurses, and in certain clinical areas such as mental health and emergency services. <ref type="biblio">North et al. (2006b)<lb/></ref> estimated at 19 900 NZ$ the cost per nurse leaver, and between 5 000 NZ$ and 13 000 NZ$ the costs<lb/> associated with recruitment, hiring and training.<lb/> 85.<lb/> In order to improve retention in the job, efforts have been engaged to address working conditions<lb/> through, for example, the development of &quot; magnet hospitals &quot; in New Zealand. Internationally, it has been<lb/> observed that some policies in place in hospitals are more successful in recruiting and retaining health care<lb/> staff. These hospitals have been designated as &quot; magnet hospitals &quot; . Research shows superior outcomes for<lb/> magnet hospitals, such as lower risk-adjusted hospital mortality, higher ratings of quality of care, higher<lb/> patient satisfaction, lower rates of nurse burnout and higher rates of nurse job satisfaction. It appears that<lb/> developing some of the features of a &quot; magnet hospital &quot; is certainly a promising strategy to improve<lb/> retention. Becoming a magnet hospital requires meeting 14 principles including having strong nursing<lb/> leadership, a flat organisational structure, a participatory management style, and promoting work<lb/> autonomy. A New Zealand Magnet Advisory Group was established in February 2002. Several DHBs are<lb/> now actively pursuing the possibility of introducing magnet concepts in New Zealand&apos;s health and<lb/> disability sector. Hutt Valley DHB has been the first to receive magnet hospital accreditation in June 2007<lb/> (<ref type="biblio">Nursing New Zealand, 2007</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<head>20<lb/></head>

			<p>Until recently, doctors visiting New Zealand for up to three years were recorded in a temporary registration<lb/> category. This applied mainly to doctors trained in one of the following countries: United Kingdom,<lb/> Republic of Ireland, Canada, United States, and South Africa. This scope of practice no longer exists under<lb/> the current legislation and these doctors are now registered in either a provisional general or special-<lb/>purpose scope depending on their circumstances<lb/> 86.<lb/> Other types of retention strategies are also being developed at the DHB level. For instance, in the<lb/> Capital and Coast DHB, combined approaches have been developed to improve nurse turnover which was<lb/> around 33%. Following a large wage increase (about 20%), new training approaches, and better work-<lb/>related advantages, turnover rates are significantly lower, around 17%. Other approaches are based on<lb/> engaging staff and include granting awards for long term staff.<lb/> 87.<lb/> Finally, &quot; recruiting back &quot; health professionals to the health workforce is a policy raising growing<lb/> interest as there is a pool of health workers, especially nurses who are either inactive or work in another<lb/> sector. But, to date this interest has not been translated into a specific policy. For instance, 14% of the<lb/> Registered Nurses and Midwives who purchased an Annual Practicing Certificate in 2000 were either in<lb/> non-nursing or midwifery job, or not in paid employment. This percentage was even higher for enrolled<lb/> nurses (21%) (New Zealand Health Information Service, New Zealand Nurses and Midwives 2000,<lb/> NZHIR, 2002). A study on this particular group found that 76% of registered nurses and midwives, and<lb/> 79% of enrolled nurses, would consider returning to the clinical workforce (New Zealand Health<lb/> Information Service, Non-practicing nurses and midwives 2000, NZHIS, 2000). The survey also found that<lb/> the main factors that would attract nurses back to the clinical workforce were more flexible hours of work,<lb/> availability of return-to-work programmes, salary increases, and provision of child-care facilities. For<lb/> enrolled nurses, an improved image of nursing was also a major factor.<lb/></p>

			<head>Retention in, and return to, New Zealand<lb/></head>

			<p>88.<lb/> &quot; Recruiting back &quot; health worker who emigrated is also attracting more attention. In theory, there<lb/> is big pool of potential &quot; returnees &quot; for New Zealand to attract. Efforts are underway to better understand<lb/> why people leave through exit surveys, and strategies to attract back health workers who went overseas are<lb/> being developed. Alumni programs exist at the Wellington and Auckland public hospitals in order to<lb/> maintain contact between the hospital and former nurses.<lb/> 89.<lb/> At the same time, there is an acknowledgement that many leave, at least temporarily, especially<lb/> to Australia, and, to a certain extent, a general acceptance that young individuals will leave New Zealand<lb/> for an overseas experience. In health occupations, a nursing career is even sometimes promoted as<lb/> allowing travels around the world. Higher wages, especially for junior doctors who have to reimburse their<lb/> student loan, professional opportunities and the quest for a new lifestyle are among the main factors<lb/> motivating health professionals to migrate from New Zealand.<lb/> 90.<lb/> Retention of junior doctors is a serious concern in New Zealand. As depicted in Chart 16, by the<lb/> third year after graduation, approximately 30% of doctors from a graduate year will be lost. This retention<lb/> rate has showed little change over the past decade. 21 It can also be noted that about 10% of graduate<lb/> students do not register immediately after graduation; this figure reached almost 20% in 2004. As for<lb/> foreign-trained doctors, data on retention show a marked decrease in the first year after registration. In the<lb/> year after initial registration, less than 50% of international medical graduates remain in New Zealand<lb/> (<ref type="biblio">Medical Council, 2006</ref>). This percentage is 33% in the third year after registration. This illustrates the<lb/> short-term pattern of the migration of health professionals to New Zealand, casting doubts on the role that<lb/> migration might play to address long-term supply needs. Reasons for low retention rates could be due inter<lb/> alia to a strong preference for short-term stays, remigration to other OECD countries or difficulties in<lb/> getting qualifications fully recognized. Further analysis should be carried out to disentangle these different<lb/> factors and identify appropriate policy responses.<lb/></p>

			<figure>arrival data are also available by place of<lb/> birth. It shows a constant negative net migration for nurses born in New Zealand. The figure averages at<lb/> 300 a year, corresponding to about 25% of the nurses graduating each year. The yearly net outflow for<lb/> New Zealand born health professionals (except nursing) is more limited as it reaches about 100.<lb/> 93.<lb/> Australia attracts a large share of New Zealand health professionals. Geographical proximity,<lb/> cultural similarity, and higher wages, all contribute to this emigration.In addition, except for medical<lb/> professionals, migration is also facilitated by the Trans-Tasman Mutual Recognition Arrangement<lb/> (TTMRA) between Australia and New Zealand signed in 1996. The TTMRA established that a person<lb/> registered to practice an occupation in New Zealand is entitled to practise an equivalent occupation in<lb/> Australia (and inversely) without the need to undergo further testing or examination. Movement between<lb/> New Zealand and Australia is also facilitated by the existence of transnational Medical Colleges that set up<lb/> similar requirements for post-graduate medical training in both Australia and New Zealand.<lb/></figure>

			<p>94.<lb/> Australia is the major destination country for New Zealand health professionals, but the converse<lb/> is not true. While in the 2001 census the number of New Zealand-born doctors and nurses in Australia is<lb/> estimated at 1 086 and 5 443, respectively, Australian-born doctors and nurses in New Zealand amounted<lb/> only to 180 and 582, respectively. In 2001, 59% of New Zealand-born medical doctors living overseas<lb/> were in Australia (51% for dentists, 72% for pharmacists and 72% for nurses), whereas only 9.3% of<lb/> Australian-born doctors living overseas were in New Zealand (4% for dentists, 12.5% for pharmacists and<lb/> 13.5% for nurses). Nonetheless, in relative terms, the proportion of Australian-born health professionals in<lb/> New Zealand among health professionals and New Zealand-born health professionals in Australia are very<lb/> similar, at approximately 2%.<lb/></p>

			<figure>95.<lb/> In terms of outflows of New Zealand doctors, the average annual number of arrivals (settlers, and<lb/> permanent and long-terms stays) in Australia is estimated around 330 per year for the period 1998-2006<lb/> (see Chart 18). The corresponding average for nurses is just over 800. These out-migration flows are of<lb/> large magnitude for a country like New Zealand, compared to the annual number of new nursing and<lb/> medical graduates.<lb/> Chart 18.

			<p>The relative importance of migration flows from New Zealand to Australia, and the fact that<lb/> some migrants were perceived as using New Zealand as &apos;a revolving door&apos; into Australia, especially<lb/> throughout the 1990s, led Australia to adopt restrictive measures against New Zealanders. In 2001, it was<lb/> required for New Zealanders to obtain permanent residence if they wished to gain access to social security,<lb/> to have citizenship or to sponsor other people for permanent residence. Otherwise, New Zealanders must<lb/> wait two years before being eligible for social benefits. 23 While these restrictions applied to New<lb/> Zealanders in Australia, the converse did not apply. At the end of the 90&apos;s, New Zealanders were also<lb/> affected by a measure aimed at discouraging the immigration of doctors. It was decided that all doctors<lb/> entering Australia (including those trained in New Zealand) would not be allowed to bill on the Medicare<lb/> system (Medicare is Australia&apos;s public universal health system) until ten years after they had gained<lb/> accreditation. However, this period of ten years is reduced to five years for doctors working in rural and<lb/> remote areas (defined at State level), and does not apply for those working in <ref type="biblio">District</ref> Workforce Shortage<lb/> areas (defined at Federal level). The immediate impact of these measures can be seen on Chart 18 which<lb/> shows a decrease in long-term and permanent arrivals of doctors from New Zealand to Australia after<lb/> 2001.<lb/> 23<lb/> Poot and Sanderson (2007) show that these policy changes affected the duration of stay and the likelihood<lb/> of return migration from Australia to New Zealand.<lb/></figure>

			<p>97.<lb/> Emigration of young new Zealanders is a matter of concern although having international<lb/> experience is strongly encouraged as a way of capitalising knowledge and skills. The key question is: how<lb/> many come back and when? Unfortunately, evidence to answer these questions is scarce, especially in<lb/> terms of specific occupations. The new Zealand Government has recently developed a program to foster<lb/> return migration in general (tax reduction or immunities for those who have been abroad for more than 15<lb/> years, facilitated procedure for the immigration of the partner, etc.), but these measures need to be further<lb/> evaluated.<lb/></p>

			<head>2.4 Retirement<lb/></head>

			<p>98.<lb/> In a context of health workforce ageing, retirement is an important factor to monitor. The ageing<lb/> of the health workforce is a major change observed in most OECD countries. However, specific<lb/> information about the retirement rate of health workers is rather scarce. The statutory pensionable age<lb/> often differs from the actual age of retirement. Evidence suggests that some independent health workers<lb/> continue working after they have reached pensionable age. At the same time, workers in many countries<lb/> are choosing to retire earlier. This trend seems to be taking hold among health workers as well and is likely<lb/> to be reinforced by the increasing presence of women, who retire earlier than their male counterparts.<lb/> 99.<lb/> In New Zealand, older workers are an increasing share of the health workforce (Ministry of<lb/> <ref type="biblio">Health, 2006a</ref>). While in 1990, 35% of the medical workforce was under 35 years of age, this figure had<lb/> fallen to 22% in 2004 (Health Workforce Advisory Committee, 2005). As the proportion of older doctors<lb/> and nurses is increasing, substantial retirement outflows can therefore be expected within the next decades.<lb/> The RNZCGP 2005 Membership survey indicates that retirement is the single most mentioned factor likely<lb/> to influence future work intentions (RNZCGP, 2005 RNZCGP Membership Survey: workforce series 2,<lb/> 2006). For nurses, it is estimated that about 365 nurses or 1.1% retire each year (Department of Labour,<lb/> 2005a).<lb/></table>

			<head>3. FUTURE PERSPECTIVES<lb/></head>

			<p>100.<lb/> The New Zealand health system will face serious challenges in the future. Future demand for<lb/> healthcare services is expected to increase while future supply is thought to be insufficient. As a result,<lb/> health worker shortages are predicted if nothing is undertaken.<lb/> 101.<lb/> Population ageing and its future impact on the demand for health workforce is perceived as a<lb/> major issue in New Zealand. It is projected that while total population will increase by 16% between 2001<lb/> and 2021, the corresponding figure will be 72% for people aged 65 and over (NZIER 2004). The<lb/> percentage increase for Māori and Pacific Islander people is expected to be even greater.<lb/> 102.<lb/> As a result of population ageing, long-term care costs are also expected to rise. Projections of<lb/> public health spending for long-term care for the period 2005 and 2050 suggest that the increase in public<lb/> spending on long-term care, in percentage points of GDP, will vary between 1.2 and 2% for New Zealand,<lb/> which is very similar to the OECD average ranging between 1.3 and 2.2% (<ref type="biblio">Bjornerud et al., 2006</ref>).<lb/> 103.<lb/> On the supply side, various trends need to be taken into consideration. In particular, a move<lb/> towards a better balance between work and leisure for health professionals, the introduction of new time<lb/> directives limiting working hours of health professionals, in particular for junior doctors, and the<lb/> feminisation of the medical workforce.<lb/> 104.<lb/> Relying on three different scenarios, an assessment of future demand and supply of health<lb/> services was undertaken by the NZIER (NZIER 2004). Each scenario was based on different assumptions<lb/> about population growth, morbidity rates and the onset of disease and disability in old age. According to<lb/> the selected scenari, the demand for health services could increase by 40 to 69% between 2001 and 2021.<lb/> Assuming that demand for labour will grow in line with the health service demands, the study finds that the<lb/> demand for health professionals will outstrip supply by 2011. Depending on the scenario, the excess labour<lb/> demand over supply is expected to be equivalent to between 19 0007 and 28 000 health professionals, or<lb/> 28% and 42% of the 2001 health workforce (NZIER, 2004).<lb/> 105.<lb/> Of course, these are only scenarios for the future not exact predictions. Moreover, it is not<lb/> uncommon that predicted shortages or surpluses never materialize. Nonetheless, the results of this<lb/> projection demonstrate the importance of having a health workforce policy to address future challenges.<lb/></p>

			<head>4. CAN NEW ZEALAND COMPETE?<lb/></head>

			<p>106.<lb/> So far, immigration contributes to a large extent to the supply of health workers in New Zealand.<lb/> However, increasing the number of overseas-trained health professionals might place New Zealand in a<lb/> delicate position as it could become too dependent on migration. In this context, one can wonder about the<lb/> sustainability of New Zealand policy in a context of increasing international competition to attract health<lb/> workers.<lb/> 107.<lb/> In particular, ageing in the United Kingdom, United States, and Australia is likely to have an<lb/> impact on labour demand for New Zealand and increase relative demand offshore for medical<lb/> professionals. This would make the New Zealand trained health professionals harder to retain, and the<lb/> potential pool of foreign recruits more difficult to attract.<lb/> 108.<lb/> Given the relative small size of its health workforce and its heavy reliance on immigration, a<lb/> sudden change in the international migration flows, which could result from policy changes in OECD<lb/> countries beyond control of New Zealand authorities, could have a dramatic impact on New Zealand.<lb/> However, at the same time, taking into account the fact that the annual numbers of health professional<lb/> immigrants to New Zealand are relatively small compared the scale of worldwide flows, it is most likely<lb/> that New Zealand will be able to recruit the doctors and nurses it needs but at an increasing cost with<lb/> increasing difficulties to attract the best skills. This will make the education option more attractive but<lb/> taking into account the length of training it might require immediate action.<lb/> 109.<lb/> Furthermore, in order to compete more effectively, New Zealand would need to improve the<lb/> critical issue of the retention of international health worker migrants, and in particular doctors. As<lb/> mentioned previously, turnover is very important, as only 33% of international medical graduates remain<lb/> in New Zealand after registration. A better management of health worker immigration necessitates<lb/> improving retention. In other words, the sustainability of New Zealand health workforce policy is probably<lb/> not so much jeopardized by the large reliance on immigration but rather by the failure to retain<lb/> international health worker migrants in New Zealand on the medium and long term.<lb/></p>

			<head>CONCLUDING REMARKS<lb/></head>

			<p>110.<lb/> Despite the key role of the health workforce in the health system, it has not been at the core of<lb/> various health system reforms in New Zealand. Nonetheless, in recent years, health workforce issues have<lb/> captured more attention, and there is now a growing recognition of its importance. Moreover, in the<lb/> specific context of New Zealand, planning in health human resources is probably more of a challenge than<lb/> in most other OECD countries because of the key role of in-and out-migration which are only partially<lb/> determined by New Zealand policies. Increasing international competition for highly skilled workers raises<lb/> important issues such as sustainability and ability to compete in a global market. In this context, new<lb/> approaches to improve the international recruitment of health workers, as well as developing alternative<lb/> policies, may need to be considered.<lb/> 111.<lb/> As for international recruitment, better coordination and stronger collaboration between the<lb/> Ministry of Labour, the Ministry of Health and the DHBs could contribute to more effective and pertinent<lb/> international recruitment. For instance, the MoH and DHBs could certainly make valuable contributions to<lb/> the occupational shortage lists regarding the definition and discussion about health workforce shortages.<lb/> Also, a better coordination between DHBs in terms of international recruitment would be desirable. For<lb/> instance, a nationwide recruitment process could be considered. In addition, migration policy could also be<lb/> used to address some the concerns about the quality of the provision of aged care. As most people working<lb/> in aged care are unskilled, and an important share is coming from the Pacific Islands, developing bilateral<lb/> agreements with the Pacific Islands in order to set up migration programs with a training component could<lb/> be considered.<lb/> 112.<lb/> The increasing use of temporary migration gives rise to a large number of short-term stay of<lb/> health workers in New Zealand, in particular for doctors. While locum schemes are certainly a good policy<lb/> to address workforce shortages in rural areas, having a large number of migrants coming only for short-<lb/>term stays, raises issues of turnover and its associated costs in terms of recruitment and training costs.<lb/> Moreover, in order to address rural–urban imbalances, refining the points system in the context of the<lb/> migration policy could be considered. For instance, instead of awarding the same additional amount of<lb/> points for people settling outside Auckland as is the case now, one could introduce a points system with<lb/> greater regional variations, depending on the severity of health workforce shortages.<lb/> 113.<lb/> Improving wages and working conditions in the health sector, developing further skill-mix<lb/> approaches, and attracting back health workers who have left New Zealand, are all complementary<lb/> approaches that need further consideration.<lb/> 114.<lb/> While improving working conditions, skill mix and education are the object of a lot of attention<lb/> in many countries, attracting back health workers who have left their country has not captured much<lb/> attention so far. The complexity and the costs associated with such policies are likely to be a serious<lb/> deterrent. However, as the pool of New Zealand-born nurses and doctors living in other OECD countries is<lb/> so important—the number of New Zealand-born nurses living in other OECD countries is almost<lb/> equivalent to the number of foreign-born nurses in New Zealand—it is certainly worth considering specific<lb/> programs to attract back health workers, e.g. developing alumni networks, hospital twinning etc. Recent<lb/> measures adopted by New Zealand to facilitate the return of New Zealanders from abroad are encouraging.<lb/> In this context, focusing efforts on Australia and the United Kingdom would be natural as most New<lb/> Zealand emigrant health worker move to those two countries. Strengthening collaboration between<lb/> Australia and New Zealand on health workforce policy issues could also be a way forward for both<lb/> countries.<lb/> 115.<lb/> As for education, strengthening coordination between the main actors—DHBs, Tertiary<lb/> Education Commission and the Clinical Training Agency—would facilitate the development of a global<lb/> and common view, as emphasised in a recent report of the Health Workforce Taskforce (2007). DHBNZ<lb/> has a potential to play a greater role in this context. The possibility of increasing the annual intake of<lb/> medical students certainly deserves further investigation. Given the importance of immigration by doctors,<lb/> increasing the number of doctors trained domestically would seem a serious option, especially since the<lb/> number of graduates per 100 000 population in New Zealand is below the OECD average. Attracting more<lb/> foreign students is also a promising route, especially taking into account the flexibility of the New Zealand<lb/> migration system to accommodate status changes. This may imply, however, reconsidering the cost-<lb/>sharing of training costs for medical and nursing graduates. An issue which also applies to the case of New<lb/> Zealanders as we have seen that indebtedness remains one of the main incentives for out migration.<lb/></p>
