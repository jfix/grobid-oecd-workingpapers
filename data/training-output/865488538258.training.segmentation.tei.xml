			<front>ABSTRACT <lb/>This study reviews key issues in liberalising network infrastructure services — including <lb/>telecommunications, postal/courier, energy, water and sewage — in the national and multilateral contexts. <lb/>The economic and social significance of these services means that they are high on the list of development <lb/>priorities in many countries. Enhanced trade and investment in network infrastructure services can help <lb/>achieve these development goals. Liberalisation, however, is no easy task and requires sound regulation <lb/>and effective institutions to address market failures and ensure public policy objectives. If appropriately <lb/>designed, bound liberalisation under the GATS can contribute to the advancement of national objectives by <lb/>improving investor&apos;s confidence when countries decide to allow private sector participation in these <lb/>services. The WTO services agreement can affect the regulatory conduct of governments in some areas of <lb/>network infrastructure services, particularly when specific commitments are made. This is intensified by <lb/>the fact that the GATS is a relatively young agreement and some of its provisions remain to be tested in <lb/>practice. It is thus crucial to carefully examine its provisions and tailor-specific commitments to national <lb/>policy objectives. <lb/>Keywords: Network, infrastructure, public services, liberalisation, regulation, GATS. <lb/>AKNOWLEDGEMENTS <lb/>This study has been prepared by Massimo Geloso Grosso of the OECD Trade Directorate under the <lb/>supervision of Dale Andrew, Head of the Trade Policy Linkages Division, and of Julia Nielson.

			<body>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY <lb/>Part I of the study investigates how regulatory objectives can be achieved in liberalised markets by <lb/>exploring experience with competition in several services sectors previously provided solely by <lb/>governments. In recent years, trade in network infrastructure services — including telecommunications, <lb/>postal/courier, energy, water and sewage — has increased, following changes in their provision leading to <lb/>stronger competition. In developing countries, in particular, liberalisation is seen as a way to increase <lb/>investment and improve infrastructure performance. Due to lack of domestic capacity and finance, when <lb/>developing country governments decide to open these services to competition, it usually includes a <lb/>decision to accept foreign participation. Technological innovation has also expanded the scope for <lb/>competition in sectors such as telecommunications and postal/courier and, to a lesser extent, energy. Even <lb/>where competition in the market may not be feasible due to features of scale and natural monopoly <lb/>associated with these services, competition for the market has been introduced through various contractual <lb/>arrangements between the public and private sectors. These have emerged as alternatives to privatisation. <lb/>While liberalisation can confer significant benefits in terms of increased efficiency, access and <lb/>affordability of services, it must be appropriately designed and supported by a strong regulatory <lb/>framework. Governments have at their disposal a variety of regulatory tools and approaches to address <lb/>market failures and meet public policy objectives in the new environment. <lb/>First, governments retain a major role in regulating tariffs in liberalised markets. The challenge is to <lb/>set rates that strike a socially acceptable balance between the interests of investors and consumers, <lb/>attracting needed capital while ensuring that prices are just and reasonable. Second, governments put in <lb/>place policies to ensure access and affordability of services to poor or unserved populations. In some cases <lb/>(e.g. telecommunications) liberalisation itself can increase access as competition lowers prices; in other <lb/>cases, specific measures are necessary, such as network expansion obligations or subsidies targeted at poor <lb/>consumers or at providers. Third, governments maintain responsibility for setting standards for the service, <lb/>either specifying outcomes (e.g. service quality and reliability) or inputs (e.g. materials and design to be <lb/>used by operators). Approaches to induce companies to meet standards range from mandatory service <lb/>obligations to market-based instruments. Standards should be sufficiently flexible to enable operators to <lb/>seek creative approaches to expand service provision, without compromising service quality. <lb/>Furthermore, strong and genuinely independent regulatory agencies and competition authorities, with <lb/>the capacity to put in place appropriate regulation and competition policy as well as ensure enforcement <lb/>are critical. The essential tasks performed by these institutions require considerable expertise in appraising <lb/>the structure and performance of markets. Development of regulatory capacity in developing countries is <lb/>likely to require substantial technical and financial assistance. Transparency in regulatory decision-making <lb/>and in activities between suppliers is also key to ensure accountability and the political acceptability of <lb/>reform. Evidence suggests that consumers are prepared to accept higher prices where service quality is <lb/>improved and the basis for the tariffs is transparent. Making information available to consumers can in turn <lb/>assist in mobilising them to play a role in monitoring the performance of service suppliers and the <lb/>enforcement of regulation. <lb/>There is, of course, no universally appropriate model for reform. Every liberalisation programme must <lb/>take account of each sector&apos;s economic attributes and technological conditions, as well as the country&apos;s <lb/></body>

			<body>economic, social, geographical, institutional and political characteristics. Against this backdrop, Part I of <lb/>the report presents concrete examples from both OECD and non-OECD countries of experiences by <lb/>governments with various regulatory instruments to ensure public policy objectives. <lb/>Part II of the study complements Part I by linking the discussion of the liberalisation of network <lb/>infrastructure services at the national level with the GATS. It explores the main issues related to these <lb/>services in current GATS negotiations in terms of new possibilities for progress in light of real <lb/>liberalisation taking place in many countries and of important considerations specific to these services. <lb/>Enhanced GATS commitments in network infrastructure services can create momentum for further <lb/>domestic reform, and can anchor these reforms within an international legal framework. GATS <lb/>commitments can also provide a credible signal that the government is committed to sector reform and has <lb/>taken the necessary legal and regulatory measures to allow for investment, including FDI. WTO <lb/>commitments can thus contribute to improve the investment climate, helping to attract needed capital as <lb/>well as technical and managerial expertise. Preparedness to make GATS commitments can additionally <lb/>enhance leverage for commitments from trading partners both in services and in other areas of the WTO <lb/>agenda. <lb/>Notwithstanding these benefits, with the exception of telecommunication services, progress on <lb/>committing network infrastructure services under the GATS has been limited. This partly reflects the fact <lb/>that these services were mostly provided by public monopoly operators at the time of the Uruguay Round. <lb/>Nevertheless, significant reforms to introduce competition have since been undertaken which have changed <lb/>the market characteristics of these services in many countries. So there seems to be scope now to achieve <lb/>more progress at the multilateral level and the Doha Round offers WTO Members an opportunity for <lb/>anchoring recent policy reforms, giving them more permanency in a flexible and progressive manner. Yet <lb/>so far only relatively few Members have tabled new or improved offers in these services and developing <lb/>countries&apos; participation remains limited. <lb/>Part of the reason explaining this lack of progress relates to the main classification instruments used <lb/>by WTO Members in making commitments in network infrastructure services. Clarifying and modernising <lb/>the current GATS classifications is viewed by some countries as key to improve commitments in these <lb/>services. Several proposals have thus been submitted by a number of WTO Members suggesting <lb/>alternative or more specific definitions, some of which have already been adopted in the requests and <lb/>offers of a few Members. While in light of divergent views it may be difficult in the short-term to agree on <lb/>new classification instruments, WTO Members are not required to use any particular classification and the <lb/>Members concerned are free to modify the classifications contained in their schedules of commitments (as <lb/>long as consistency with previous commitments is maintained). By the same token, those Members that <lb/>consider that the current GATS classifications remain a valid framework to schedule commitments in the <lb/>relevant sectors can simply maintain them in their schedules. WTO Members have also been discussing <lb/>ways to ensure that any commitments in these services are not undermined by lack of commitments in <lb/>other (related) sectors. <lb/>Perhaps more importantly, concerns have been raised about the potential effect of the GATS on the <lb/>ability of governments to ensure adequate provision of network infrastructure services to the public. In <lb/>practice, this refers to the possible impact of the Agreement on governments&apos; ability to maintain their <lb/>traditional public service responsibilities either through monopoly public utilities, exclusive rights to <lb/>provide services or appropriately regulated competition. In light of the importance of these services for <lb/>society and their highly regulated nature, governments have been cautious about agreeing to subject these <lb/>sectors to binding commitments on competitive supply. The GATS, like other legally bound undertakings <lb/>in the WTO (or other international treaties), can affect the regulatory conduct of governments. At the same <lb/>time, the Agreement affords WTO Members considerable flexibility in this regard. <lb/></body>

			<page>6 <lb/></page>

			<body>In the absence of scheduled commitments, the GATS imposes only limited obligations, which do not <lb/>limit governments&apos; ability to retain control over network infrastructure services. When a country makes a <lb/>commitment, other more significant obligations kick-in, especially concerning market access and national <lb/>treatment. These may have more significant implications on autonomous policy making in these services, <lb/>intensified by the fact that the GATS is a relatively young agreement and some of its provisions remain to <lb/>be tested in practice. Scheduling commitments on network infrastructure services thus raises questions in <lb/>relation to their nature. At the same time, the flexibility imbedded in the Agreement allows countries to <lb/>schedule limitations to avoid these concerns and facilitate the assumption of commitments in these <lb/>services. This is reflected in the Uruguay Round schedules of some WTO Members and explored in Part II <lb/>of the study. <lb/>Once commitments in a particular sector have been made, additional disciplines on regulatory <lb/>measures apply, in particular those contained in Article VI. A closer look at these provisions reveals that <lb/>they do not seem to impinge on governments&apos; ability to regulate network infrastructure services. In <lb/>addition, current discussions under the Article VI:4 mandate indicate that any new disciplines in this area <lb/>will be broad enough to allow regulation for the protection of a wide range of public policy objectives. <lb/>This is confirmed by the Accountancy Disciplines, the one area where negotiations have been concluded <lb/>under the mandate. Another important example of GATS disciplines and the scope for autonomous policy <lb/>making in network infrastructure services is the Reference Paper on Basic Telecommunications. The <lb/>Reference Paper, which attains legal status only to the extent that WTO Members have incorporated it in <lb/>their commitments, consists of a set of pro-competitive regulatory principles for basic telecommunication <lb/>services akin to international best practice. The Reference Paper, in line with the Preamble of the GATS, <lb/>recognises governments&apos; right to regulate the sector to ensure public policy objectives. A case in point is <lb/>universal service requirements; the Reference Paper explicitly confirms the right of Members to establish <lb/>such measures. <lb/></body>

			<body>PART I: REGULATING FOR PUBLIC POLICY OBJECTIVES <lb/>I. <lb/>Introduction <lb/>1. <lb/>This part of the study investigates how regulatory objectives can be achieved in liberalised <lb/>markets by exploring experience with competition in several services sectors previously provided solely by <lb/>governments. The aim is not to advocate particular solutions, but to provide policy makers with <lb/>information to feed into, and adapt to the specificities of, their own economic and political situations, if <lb/>and when they decide to liberalise. <lb/>2. <lb/>The study presents concrete examples from both OECD and non-OECD countries of how <lb/>governments have used various regulatory instruments to achieve public policy objectives. The focus is on <lb/>telecommunication, postal/courier, energy and environmental infrastructure services given their network <lb/>characteristics. <lb/>3. <lb/>The report also includes examples where experience was not positive, with the aim of providing <lb/>some guidance on the pitfalls to be avoided if the benefits of liberalisation are to be realised and sustained. <lb/>A number of cases provide examples of both negative and positive experiences, with initial, less successful <lb/>reforms being adjusted in light of experience and new regulatory solutions adopted. These cases underline <lb/>both the extent of experimentation undertaken in service sector reform in recent years and the need for <lb/>regulatory approaches to be adapted to local circumstances. <lb/>4. <lb/>Examples of regulation of domestic private participants, i.e. where there is no trade, are included <lb/>where there is no apparent reason that the same regulatory measure could not be applied to a foreign <lb/>entrant. Examples of regulatory mechanisms involving publicly-owned companies are incorporated as well <lb/>when they are relevant for any type of operator (public or private). Reforms have at times been progressive <lb/>with the former public monopoly still being the main (or only) service provider, while the new regulatory <lb/>framework is designed. In these cases, the reforms have already been tailored to prepare for the <lb/>introduction of competition. <lb/>5. <lb/>The next section of this part of the study reviews opportunities and challenges of introducing <lb/>competition in network infrastructure services. Section III then identifies a number of key regulatory <lb/>objectives that governments seek to achieve in liberalised markets to address market failures and meet <lb/>public policy objectives, and describes some of the regulatory approaches that can be used to achieve these <lb/>objectives. The last section presents the country examples in the chosen sectors. <lb/>II. <lb/>Opening to competition <lb/>6. <lb/>Historically, trade in network infrastructure services — including telecommunications, <lb/>postal/courier, energy, water and sewage — has been limited because they were mainly provided by <lb/>governments. Government provision was seen as necessary to ensure equitable access to these services and <lb/>because of their natural monopoly characteristics. The scope for competition in several network <lb/>infrastructure services has traditionally been limited given that the existing infrastructure — e.g. <lb/>transmission media in telecommunications, electricity grid and water and sewage pipes — is often <lb/>prohibitively expensive to duplicate. <lb/></body>

			<page>8 <lb/></page>

			<body>7. <lb/>Nevertheless, in recent years trade in network infrastructure services has increased, following <lb/>changes in the provision of these services leading to stronger presence of the private sector. In emerging <lb/>economies and developing countries, in particular, the underlying driver of decisions to liberalise is to <lb/>attract resources for the financing of investment and to improve infrastructure performance. Liberalisation <lb/>of these services is seen as a way to increase investment and service coverage, foster competition where <lb/>feasible and import technology and know-how. Due to lack of domestic capacity and finance, when <lb/>developing country governments decide to liberalise, it usually includes a decision to accept foreign <lb/>participation. <lb/>8. <lb/>Competition in network utilities has also been facilitated by technological innovation. Changes in <lb/>production and technological advances have had especially dramatic effects on the market structure of the <lb/>telecommunication, energy and increasingly postal industries. In telecommunications, technological <lb/>change has almost eliminated natural monopoly in interexchange markets (e.g. long-distance services). The <lb/>rapid growth of cellular telephones, which increasingly substitute for wireline services, has played a big <lb/>role in reducing the importance of scale and natural monopoly associated with conventional local loops <lb/>(World Bank, 2004). Internet-based services are undergoing similar dramatic growth. <lb/>9. <lb/>In recent years, what once was a relatively clear cut divide between the monopoly provision of <lb/>postal services and competitive provision of courier services has become increasingly blurred. In a few <lb/>cases, this has occurred through market reforms which have formally reduced or terminated the scope of <lb/>monopoly rights, but for most countries this has been through the expansion of private sector operators into <lb/>areas once the exclusive preserve of the public service postal providers. Equally, many postal <lb/>administrations have moved beyond the confines of providing traditional postal services in reserved sectors <lb/>into new areas in competition with the private sector. This process of increased competition has accelerated <lb/>with new technological developments in postal services, with the range of possibilities opened up <lb/>considerably through electronic mail and the Internet. <lb/>10. <lb/>In the electricity industry reforms involved unbundling of its four main components — <lb/>generation, transmission, distribution and retail — which led to different forms of competition (see Box 1). <lb/>New technologies have also facilitated the introduction of competition in generation (although there is <lb/>debate on whether the production of energy constitutes a service or a good). Low-cost, small-scale <lb/>generation units allow electric power to be produced closer to end users, reducing reliance on transmission <lb/>and distribution networks, which constitute services, and contributing to undermine their natural monopoly <lb/>characteristics. <lb/>Box 1. Options for restructuring electricity markets <lb/>Electricity markets can be structured in four ways, reflecting varying competition and customer choice: <lb/>• Monopoly — the traditional status quo, where a single entity generates all electricity and delivers it over a <lb/>transmission network to distribution companies or costumers.<lb/>• Single buyer — where a single agency buys electricity from competing generators, has a monopoly on <lb/>transmission, and sells electricity to distributors and large power users without competition from other suppliers.<lb/>• Wholesale competition — where multiple distributors buy electricity from competing generators, use the <lb/>transmission network to deliver it to their service areas under open access arrangements, and maintain monopolies <lb/>on sales in their service areas.<lb/>• Retail competition — where customers have access to competing generators, directly or through a retailer of their <lb/>choice, and transmission and distribution networks operate under open access arrangements. However, retail <lb/>competition may not involve all customers but may be limited to industrial customers.<lb/></body>

			<body>11. <lb/>But even when competition in the market may not be feasible — e.g. local networks of water <lb/>pipes and sewers — it is possible to introduce competition for the market through monopoly franchises. <lb/>Many countries have used innovative strategies to facilitate private participation in these services. <lb/>Contractual arrangements between the private and public sectors, such as concessions, management <lb/>contracts or build operate transfer contracts have emerged as alternatives to privatisation — where <lb/>ownership is transferred through outright divesture. 1 A concession contract, for example, grants a private <lb/>company, typically through competitive bidding, the exclusive right to provide a service for a specified <lb/>period by using existing facilities and developing new ones. Thus, a concession agreement entails only a <lb/>temporary transfer of the infrastructure assets (such as water pipes) to the private sector. At the end of the <lb/>concession period the assets are transferred back to the public authority (World Bank, 2004). <lb/>12. <lb/>These changes are having the effect of gradually bringing network infrastructure services into the <lb/>realm of the market and exposing them to international trade. However, although the benefits of <lb/>liberalisation can be very important both in terms of increased efficiency and of service access and <lb/>affordability, past experience has shown that reforms must be appropriately designed and supported by a <lb/>strong regulatory framework. <lb/>13. <lb/>If a government decides to introduce competition in services previously provided solely by the <lb/>public sector, it needs to shift from being the manager of these services to being their regulator. In light of <lb/>the characteristics of these services, to achieve public policy objectives in the new environment, new <lb/>regulatory tools and approaches are required, including with respect to pricing, universal access (both in <lb/>terms of availability and affordability) and service standards. <lb/>14. <lb/>Another important dimension is the establishment of strong and genuinely independent <lb/>regulatory agencies and competition authorities, with the capacity to put in place appropriate regulation <lb/>and ensure enforcement. When these exist, private participation can lead to improvements in attaining <lb/>public policy objectives, because, for instance, government agencies may be reluctant to monitor and fine <lb/>(other) government providers — a classic conflict of interests. Transparency about government choices <lb/>(and reasons underlying them) and in activities between suppliers is also key, as is the introduction of <lb/>instruments to enhance consumers&apos; involvement in monitoring and evaluating the improvement of services <lb/>and the achievement of public policy objectives. <lb/>15. <lb/>Experience has shown that there is no universally appropriate model for reform. Every <lb/>liberalisation programme must take account of each sector&apos;s features, including its economic attributes and <lb/>technological conditions, as well as the country&apos;s economic, social, geographical, institutional and political <lb/>characteristics (World Bank, 2004). Furthermore, the elaboration of adequate regulatory instruments and <lb/>the establishment of institutions can be costly and may require sophisticated skills, and thus present <lb/>challenges that are likely to be most acute in emerging economies and developing countries. Provision of <lb/>technical assistance and capacity building to support liberalisation are thus particularly important for these <lb/>countries. <lb/>III. <lb/>Regulatory goals and approaches <lb/>Regulating tariffs <lb/>16. <lb/>Unlike for telecommunication services where trade liberalisation, coupled with technological <lb/>advances, has led to significant price decreases, private-sector involvement in water, sewage, electricity <lb/>and postal services can lead to increases in existing fees for service supplied by the government. This is <lb/></body>

			<note place="footnote">1 There is debate among WTO Members on to what extent such contracts represent a form government procurement, <lb/>see Part II. <lb/></note>

			<page>10 <lb/></page>

			<body>because often the price fixed under government monopoly does not even cover the cost of providing the <lb/>service. User-fees are one of the most controversial aspects of liberalisation, especially in environmental <lb/>network services and electricity. Network infrastructure services are capital-intensive services and <lb/>wherever that capital investment comes from, somebody has to pay for it: if not users then taxpayers or aid <lb/>donors. Providing water and sewage services &quot; free &quot; to end users, for example, ignores the huge costs of <lb/>collecting, storing and distributing water, as well as treating waste water. Cost-reflective tariffs are needed <lb/>to bring about the investment necessary to maintain, replace, modernise and expand the facilities and <lb/>services. User fees for water, and for water-waste management, are also crucial to the promotion of <lb/>conservation principles in user households and commercial enterprises (OECD, 2001). <lb/>17. <lb/>A decision to liberalise these services does not of course mean the end of regulation in this <lb/>fundamental regulatory sphere — governments retain a key role in regulating tariffs. The key challenge <lb/>relates to setting rates that strike a socially acceptable balance between the interests of investors and <lb/>consumers, attracting needed capital and ensuring that tariffs are just and reasonable, and contribute to <lb/>universal service objectives. These goals are difficult to achieve simultaneously. Practical regulation may <lb/>entail trade-offs among them and lead to different incentives for economic actors. The optimal choice of <lb/>regulatory mechanisms depends on several factors related to the stage of national development, including <lb/>the sector&apos;s investment requirements, the availability of technical expertise and the quality of accounting <lb/>and auditing systems (see Box 2). <lb/>Box 2. Mechanisms for regulating tariffs <lb/>Two alternative mechanisms for tariff regulation are cost-plus and price caps. <lb/>2 Under cost-plus regulation, the operator <lb/>submits a bill for its operating expenses and capital costs (depreciation plus an after-tax return on its investment that <lb/>equals or exceeds its cost of capital) and the regulator passes on these costs in the prices charged to consumers. One <lb/>of the attractions of cost-plus regulation is that it is likely to attract investment to a regulated sector because investors <lb/>know they will recover their operating and investment costs. However, cost-plus systems may create incentives to <lb/>engage in accounting contrivances and to inflate costs to convince the regulator to approve higher prices. Equally, <lb/>these systems may distort firms&apos; incentives to minimise costs because firms are not rewarded for reducing them. <lb/>Under price caps the regulator defines a set of prices that the operator will be allowed to charge. The utility is free to <lb/>price at or below these ceilings, and thus has a strong incentive to pursue cost-reducing innovation, use the lowest-<lb/>cost technology and operate with no waste. At the same time, consumers are protected because prices do not vary <lb/>with the firm&apos;s reported costs. However, a disadvantage of price caps is the risk of under capitalisation that may lead to <lb/>quality concerns. In addition, it is hard to assess future developments in the utility&apos;s productivity and there is therefore a <lb/>risk of excessive profits or losses. It is thus standard for a price cap mechanism to be reviewed, which may lead to <lb/>price adjustments if the rate of return falls outside a given range. <lb/>In practice, most schemes have tended to be hybrid schemes, with the aim of sharing benefits and burdens between <lb/>the utility and its customers. For example, under some profit sharing mechanisms the firm is allowed to keep all profits <lb/>as long as the rate of return (revenue) falls within a specified range, thereby retaining incentives to achieve cost <lb/>efficiency. But if the rate of return falls outside this range, consumers receive a portion of the gains (or loss). <lb/>Source: World Bank, 2004; and Reineke and Schmitz, 2000. <lb/>18. <lb/>It is important to note that often poor consumers are simply left out of network services, <lb/>including in the case of services being provided by a government monopoly. This typically results in the <lb/>poor paying much more for these services than the better off. In the water supply sector, for example, the <lb/>cost per litre of drinking water in Nairobi is 10 times more for customers of vendors than it is for those <lb/>who are connected to a network. The ratios are similar in Latin America or even higher in the Caribbean <lb/>region. Paradoxically, this gives some ground for optimism. The regrettable fact that the urban poor are <lb/></body>

			<note place="footnote">2 It should be noted that in some sectors, such as telecommunications, regulated prices are often asymmetrical as they <lb/>only apply to incumbents or major suppliers. <lb/></note>

			<page>11 <lb/></page>

			<body>used to pay very high unit prices suggests that there are resources available in the current expenditure of <lb/>poor consumers that could be channelled more efficiently (Simpson, forthcoming). <lb/>Regulating to achieve universal access <lb/>19. <lb/>In addition to introducing cost-reflective tariffs necessary to attract needed investment, <lb/>governments should put in place policies that help to meet the needs of those parts of the population, often <lb/>in poor periurban or geographically remote areas, who cannot afford to pay for network infrastructure <lb/>services. Allowing entry — particularly in sectors or segments where product competition is feasible, e.g. <lb/>telecommunication services — can itself increase services for the poor or unserved populations, as <lb/>competition introduces a range of price and quality options making service possible in outlying regions and <lb/>to populations at lower income levels. The introduction of competition in mobile telephones has <lb/>significantly reduced the universal access problem for the urban poor in many developing countries and <lb/>has also had a considerable impact on low-income users in rural areas (ITU, 2003). Similarly, the <lb/>expansion of private sector operators into areas previously reserved to the public postal monopoly has <lb/>considerably improved mail and parcel delivery in several countries. <lb/>20. <lb/>In general, though, private companies must invest responsibly and therefore cannot alone be <lb/>expected to meet the needs of the poor or unserved population. Private actors, if free to choose, would <lb/>naturally seek profitable networks and most likely invest in utilities serving the cities and large urban areas. <lb/>However, meeting unmet needs should be a priority for governments — indeed, attracting the needed <lb/>resources is often the key motivation for introducing competition in the first place — so tools for inducing <lb/>the private sector to invest in coverage in low-income areas should be an integral part of any reform <lb/>programme. A common measure to extend access to service is to include network expansion obligations in <lb/>contracts with private providers (Gleick et al., 2002). As for pricing, the incentives for investors and <lb/>consumers have to be right, and contracts need to encourage flexible and innovative approaches to meet <lb/>service targets. <lb/>21. <lb/>Governments also have used various forms of subsidies and other support to protect poorer or <lb/>unserved groups within society. With the introduction of competition, direct (non-tariff) subsidies to poor <lb/>consumers have often replaced cross-subsidies. 3 Rather than providing blanket subsidies to hold tariffs <lb/>down, a policy that generally benefits the middle classes who are connected to the network, governments <lb/>have established mechanisms to direct the subsidies to poor neighbourhoods and unserved populations. <lb/>Other mechanisms have been used to promote sustainable use of natural resources while fostering service <lb/>access by the poor. In the water sector, these schemes consist in providing a basic minimum quantity of <lb/>water free or at low cost, but imposing higher charges for greater consumption. A key challenge, however, <lb/>is to target poor people accurately. Thus, these mechanisms require strong administrative capacity. <lb/>22. <lb/>Direct subsidies can additionally be targeted at operators in order to create incentives to extend <lb/>access into otherwise unprofitable areas. In telecommunication services, for example, so-called <lb/>universality funds have been established to collect revenues from various sources, including government <lb/>budgets, charges on international connecting services or levies on all telecommunication service operators. <lb/>Universality funds are generally used to finance specific and targeted high cost areas or low income <lb/>subscribers. They provide subsidies to create incentives for private sector telecommunication operators to <lb/>serve areas that otherwise would be unprofitable (Intven and Tétrault, 2000). <lb/></body>

			<note place="footnote">3 Cross-subsidisation occurs when, for example, the utility charges high-income and low-cost customers prices above <lb/>costs to finance services to low-income and high-cost consumers, who pay prices below costs. For example, in <lb/>telecommunications the provider charges low rates for local calls and higher rates for domestic and international long-<lb/>distance calls. <lb/></note>

			<body>Regulating to meet service standards <lb/>23. <lb/>Government responsibility extends beyond ensuring availability of service at an affordable price. <lb/>Service standards in network infrastructure services have emerged as a major regulatory issue, not least <lb/>because many functions of modern society critically depend on these services. Standards may specify <lb/>outcomes, including with respect to service quality, service reliability and continuity, environmental effects <lb/>and customer relations. In the water supply sector, quality standards are crucial to address long-term <lb/>(chronic) health problems associated with high levels of pollutants. In the postal/courier sector, service <lb/>quality in terms of on-time delivery of letters and parcels and reliability (ensuring that letters are indeed <lb/>delivered) are very important. In electricity (as in water and telecommunications), continuity of service <lb/>(avoiding blackouts and brownouts) is a main issue. The need to address environmental effects caused by <lb/>market externalities, e.g. controlling energy and water resources, is also critical. Customer relations, e.g. <lb/>flexibility in payment methods, is an important aspect for all network infrastructure services, and can <lb/>contribute to meeting universal access objectives. Standards may also specify inputs, including with <lb/>respect to materials and design to be used by operators, and procedures (e.g. documents required from the <lb/>operator and users for service connection applications) (Komives, 1999). <lb/>24. <lb/>Private operators may have few economic incentives to ensure appropriate service standards. <lb/>Therefore, service standards need to be incorporated in the regulation of the utilities. There exist a number <lb/>of approaches to induce companies to meet standards, ranging from mandatory service obligations to <lb/>market-based instruments. Under mandatory service obligations, the regulator sets standards that the <lb/>operators must meet or otherwise face fines or even the cancellation of the contract. These schemes entail <lb/>broader social benefits by ensuring that consumers are protected through guaranteed standards of <lb/>performance. <lb/>25. <lb/>Market-based instruments, on the other hand, aim at providing incentives to companies to meet <lb/>targets through improvements in efficiency. One case in point is the so called quality-incorporated <lb/>benchmarking. For example, under price cap regulation, a company that delivers increased quality relative <lb/>to its peers would be allowed to raise its price, while a corresponding price reduction would be imposed on <lb/>under-performing companies. Moreover, these schemes aim to introduce the dynamic benefits of <lb/>competition to quality provision. By using benchmarking, regulated firms effectively compete against each <lb/>other to deliver at an optimal mix of cost and service quality. Thus, in addition to static gains maximisation <lb/>(through improving the quality of service above a certain threshold), firms face an incentive to pursue <lb/>long-term investments that reduce the cost of quality provision (Giannakis, Jamasb, and Pollitt, 2003). <lb/>26. <lb/>Particularly in developing countries where large shares of the population do not have access to <lb/>services, countries are introducing flexible regulation that provides the strongest incentives for the operator <lb/>to seek creative approaches to meet service standards, while ensuring that important public policy <lb/>objectives, e.g. water quality, are not compromised (World Bank, 2004). <lb/>Effective regulatory agencies and competition authorities <lb/>27. <lb/>The establishment of appropriate regulatory agencies and competition authorities designed to <lb/>signal government&apos;s commitment to potential private investors and protect consumers from exploitation <lb/>are essential to the reform process. In a natural monopoly situation, as is generally the case for water and <lb/>sewage, private participation does not for the most part lead to a competitive market, but to the <lb/>replacement of a public monopoly with a private one. Regulatory agencies and competition authorities thus <lb/>need to ensure that the interests of consumers are defended against potential abuses from a private <lb/>enterprise operating in a non-competitive environment. The crucial tasks performed by these institutions — <lb/>e.g. setting tariffs and quality standards, as well as ensuring enforcement — require considerable expertise <lb/>in appraising the structure and performance of markets. <lb/></body>

			<body>28. <lb/>Another key issue relates to ensuring access to bottleneck facilities, e.g. the local loop in <lb/>telecommunication services and the transmission grid in electricity. These facilities are essential in <lb/>delivering final products and are often too costly to duplicate. Regulatory agencies and competition <lb/>authorities have the difficult task of designing appropriate access rules, without which entry in these <lb/>industries will not materialise. Access prices for interconnection need to be high enough to compensate for <lb/>the use of the network, yet not so high as to preclude efficient operations by entrants. The goal of access <lb/>policy should be that competition in final service markets is efficient and does not favour owners of <lb/>bottleneck facilities or their rivals (World Bank, 2004). <lb/>29. <lb/>Furthermore, particularly in sectors that feature competitive segments, such as <lb/>telecommunication, energy and postal/courier services, regulatory agencies and competition authorities <lb/>need to develop the capacity to identify abuses of market power and provide remedies that help to retain <lb/>competition as the main governor of industry performance. This includes prohibiting anti-competitive <lb/>behaviour, such as price fixing or tactics that hinder third-party access to essential facilities, as well as <lb/>blocking or conditioning mergers and acquisitions deemed damaging to competition. <lb/>30. <lb/>Performing all these tasks effectively also requires that regulatory agencies and competition <lb/>authorities be largely independent from political influence. At the same time, it is important to ensure that <lb/>regulators do not become corrupt or inefficient. Citizens and firms should be able to find out who makes <lb/>regulatory decisions and what guides them, and to voice their concerns. In addition, affected parties should <lb/>be able to obtain redress if a regulator acts arbitrarily or incompetently (World Bank, 2004). <lb/>31. <lb/>Many transition economies and developing countries still lack adequate regulatory agencies and <lb/>competition authorities, which can be costly and require sophisticated skills. Some have yet to implement <lb/>the basic elements of competition law, let alone complex issues such as fair access rules. Development of <lb/>regulatory capacity in these countries thus requires substantial technical and financial assistance. <lb/>Transparency and users&apos; involvement <lb/>32. <lb/>There is evidence that even people with low incomes are willing to pay for network infrastructure <lb/>services when the services are reliable and the cost of delivering them is reasonably transparent and <lb/>understandable. Experience also suggests that people and businesses will pay more when they receive new <lb/>or improved services. In the context of reform, this suggests that dissemination of detailed information <lb/>about the improvement in services, and the capital investment needed to create these improvements, is <lb/>essential for public acceptance of increases in overall prices. The new or improved services need to be <lb/>clearly described and rate changes need to be phased in, together with strong education and information <lb/>programmes describing the changes and their reasons. Phasing in price increases allows people and <lb/>businesses to adjust to price changes if the schedule of change is communicated in advance and people <lb/>believe that it will actually be implemented (Gleick et al., 2002). <lb/>33. <lb/>Making information available to consumers can in turn assist in mobilising them to play a role in <lb/>monitoring the performance of service suppliers and the enforcement of regulation. A number of <lb/>instruments have been introduced to enhance consumers&apos; participation in regulation. So-called citizen <lb/>report cards have been used to survey the opinion of consumers in relation to service provision and their <lb/>interaction with the relevant public agencies. Citizens can provide useful feedback on the quality, <lb/>efficiency and adequacy of services and the problems they face in their interaction with service providers <lb/>(Paul, 2004). Other measures include community-based monitoring and evaluation, designed either by the <lb/>community groups themselves or by government agencies. <lb/>34. <lb/>Ensuring availability of information is also key with respect to activities between suppliers. In the <lb/>telecommunications sector, for example, transparency is important in relation to public licensing criteria, <lb/></body>

In 1990, the former publicly-owned monopoly on electricity distribution <lb/>was divided in 12 Regional Electric Companies (REC). The RECs held a local monopoly on distribution <lb/>and were allowed to generate up to 15% of their power (and purchase the rest from generating companies). <lb/>The RECs also collectively owned the National Grid, a company in charge of transmission. An Office of <lb/>Electricity Regulation (OFFER) was in parallel established and one of its missions was to implement a <lb/>price cap regulation based on the RPI-X formula. 4 <lb/>36. <lb/>The main cost categories used by the regulator to set the price cap are the operating expenditures <lb/>(Opex), which cover the costs of network operation, and the capital expenditures (Capex), which refer to <lb/>spending on long-term assets (e.g. lines and transformers). The incentive-based mechanism determines <lb/>efficiency levels of Opex by benchmarking the utilities&apos; operating costs (deducing some non-controllable <lb/>costs such as transmission system charges and asset depreciation) with respect to a combination of factors <lb/>comprising customer numbers, units of energy delivered and network length. Capex is regulated by using <lb/>forecasts of expenditure for quality improvement for customers and other factors. Inefficient firms are <lb/>required to reduce costs to meet set targets. These mechanisms contributed to a fall of operating costs in <lb/>real terms by nearly 30% between 1990 and 2002, encouraged new investment in the network, and <lb/>increased network reliability. <lb/>37. <lb/>Nevertheless, for the first three years, tariffs for distribution operations were loosely capped in <lb/>order to let companies generate capital to improve their facilities. The result was high profits for the RECs, <lb/>which at the beginning achieved the fund raising objective for the improvement of the network. However, <lb/>at a subsequent stage these profits, and the resulting high prices for consumers, became increasingly <lb/>controversial, particularly in light of decreasing costs for operators. To address these concerns, OFFER <lb/>required significant price reductions averaging at 14% for 1995/96 and 12% for 1996/97, and readjusted <lb/>the price cap for the following years. Recent research also points to the rising concentration of the industry, <lb/>which may raise competition policy concerns. <lb/>Source: Giannakis, Jamasb and Pollitt, 2003; Kwoka, 1997; and Thomas, 2004. <lb/>Selected aspects of the California electricity crisis <lb/>38. <lb/>In June 2000, California&apos;s electricity prices experienced an unprecedented level of volatility and <lb/>price increases, driven by the threat of supply shortages and a series of &quot; rolling black-outs &quot; that affected <lb/>millions of users. The situation led to bankruptcy of one distribution utility as well as considerable political <lb/>turmoil. Among the reasons commonly associated with the California electricity crisis, the particular <lb/>process of restructuring the California electricity sector has been identified as being a key factor. This <lb/>crisis underlines the need for the objectives and constraints of any reform effort to be clearly identified. <lb/></body>

			<note place="footnote">4 The RPI-X formula means that the price cap can increase each year by the Retail Price Index (RPI) minus a certain <lb/>percentage X which reflects the productivity gains expected from the operators. The higher is X, the greater the <lb/>incentive for utilities to reduce costs and be more efficient and the lower the price for consumers. <lb/></note>

			<body>39. <lb/>For instance, any transition from a vertically integrated utility to an unbundled structure <lb/>introduces price risks between generators and distributors that previously did not exist. High wholesale <lb/>prices for generators gives profits that are matched by losses of distributors who have to buy at these high <lb/>prices and sell at predetermined retail prices. The transition to an unbundled industry therefore needs <lb/>contracts and hedging instruments to insure against possible unexpected events that can have dramatic <lb/>effects on wholesale prices. In California, when approximately 20,000 MW of generation capacity were <lb/>sold to five new entrants, commitments were not required from the generators to sell a large fraction of the <lb/>expected annual output as a long-term contract to the three main utility distributors. <lb/>40. <lb/>Further, tight demand with low spare capacity (and inelastic supply) may lead to volatile markets <lb/>and high prices even if there is competition among generators. As demand tightens relative to supply in the <lb/>face of inelastic and unresponsive demand 5 , large price rises have little effect on demand. At the same <lb/>time, each generator has increasing market power. The relatively large price increase caused by any single <lb/>company withdrawing a small amount of capacity is more than sufficient to compensate for the loss of <lb/>profit on that volume of sales, making such withdrawals highly profitable. <lb/>41. <lb/>The case also shows the importance of establishing strong regulatory agencies with broad powers <lb/>to intervene, and which are not fragmented among jurisdictions. The responsibilities of these agencies <lb/>would include resource planning, oversight of competitive generation markets, distribution and <lb/>transmission prices, network access and service standards. <lb/>Source: Wolak and Nordhaus 2001; Wolak, 2003; and Institute of International Education, 2002. <lb/>Difficulties to establish sound regulation to electricity tariff-setting in Zimbabwe <lb/>42. <lb/>In 1991, the Government of Zimbabwe introduced a reform programme of the electricity sector. <lb/>This included a performance improvement programme (PIP) for the national state utility responsible for <lb/>the bulk of electricity generation, transmission and distribution — the Zimbabwe Electricity Supply <lb/>Authority (ZESA). It also initiated a legal and regulatory reform framework for the electricity sector in <lb/>general. The Government and the Board of ZESA initiated the PIP with the appointment of a new Chief <lb/>Executive in December 1992, placing the latter and all senior managers on a performance contract. <lb/>Concurrently, Electricité de France (EDF) was engaged to work with the new management team to develop <lb/>a programme to improve the performance of the organisation in the key areas of technical operations, <lb/>customer service, financial performance and human resources management. Subsequently, several <lb/>programmes were developed between 1993 and 2000 which set performance targets, including with respect <lb/>to profitability to enhance investment, quality standards and customer satisfaction. <lb/>43. <lb/>Profitability objectives were crucial to bring about much need investment and extend electricity <lb/>access to rural areas. One of the key strategies to improve revenues was to seek Government approval for <lb/>cost-reflective tariffs. However, a lack of policy commitment and often change of Ministers for Energy — <lb/>e.g. between early 2000 and 2002 there were three Ministers for Energy — resulted in a failure to <lb/>implement the legal and regulatory framework to underpin the reform. Indeed, the reluctance of the <lb/>Government to establish sound regulation to progressively raise tariffs to cost-recovery levels meant that <lb/>cash flow and profitability remained below targets. Tariffs were only adjusted in response to an actual <lb/>financial crisis, which was reflected in the constant liquidity problems, which ZESA faced over the years. <lb/>Financial deficits were funded through short-term borrowings. When tariff increases were granted, <lb/>profitability recovered almost overnight but for the cash flows it took several months to recover because of <lb/>the heavy short-term debts.

ZESA, therefore, failed to expand generation, negatively <lb/>impacting the rural electrification expansion programme. <lb/>Source: Mangwengwende, 2002. <lb/>Tariff policy in the Chilean water and sewage sectors <lb/>44. <lb/>Chile introduced a new tariff formula in its water and sewage sectors gradually from 1990 to <lb/>1995, when it reformed its publicly-owned Santiago Metropolitan Sanitary Works Enterprise (Empresa <lb/>Metropolitana de Obras Sanitarias, or EMOS) by means of a regulatory framework mimicking the design <lb/>of a concession with a private utility. EMOS was still a state-owned company but started to operate under <lb/>private law (privatisation ultimately occurred in 1999) and under the supervision of an independent <lb/>regulatory agency. <lb/>45. <lb/>The tariff policy was designed both to signal to potential private investors that the government <lb/>was committed to not expropriating their return-on-capital through under-pricing and to curtail the chance <lb/>of monopoly rents. Tariffs are calculated every five years to cover the long run marginal cost 6 of a &quot; model &quot; <lb/>or benchmark company, and then readjusted to permit a &quot; reasonable &quot; return on assets (allowing at least a <lb/>seven percent return on capital). The water tariff is also indexed to a price index. To reduce the risk of <lb/>monopoly rents, the construction of the model company was a black box in order to make it harder for the <lb/>company to manipulate the information. The tariff has thus incentive properties similar to a price cap. If <lb/>EMOS can be more efficient than the model, it earns additional profits, giving the company an incentive to <lb/>maximise its efficiency. At the end of the period, tariffs may be adjusted downward to force the company <lb/>to share its gains with consumers. <lb/>46. <lb/>The reforms led to significant gains to the government through taxes and dividends, while <lb/>consumers benefited from almost 100% coverage of expanding demand, better water pressure and fewer <lb/>interruptions of services. Consumers also had to pay higher prices, but the effects were ameliorated by <lb/>direct subsidies (see below). Employees gained from wages closer to market wages. <lb/>Source: Shirley, Xu and Zuluaga, 2000. <lb/>High tariffs in two water and sewage concessions in Argentina 7 <lb/>47. <lb/>In 1995 private participation was introduced in the water and sewage sector in the province of <lb/>Tucuman, Argentina. A 30 year concession contract was awarded to a consortium composed of Compagnie <lb/>Générale des Eaux and a local investor. Aggressive investment targets were set in the contract. These had a <lb/>major impact on prices, which rose by up to 68%. In addition, this rise was spread across all consumers <lb/>equally, with serious implications for affordability by low income households. These concerns had not <lb/>been foreseen and were not addressed early on in the reform process. The new tariff became very <lb/>unpopular and public disapproval turned to resentment after outbreaks of turbid water. A non-payment <lb/>campaign was organised and an anti-privatisation local government was elected. The financial situation of <lb/>the concessionaire further deteriorated and several attempts to renegotiate the contract failed. A social tariff <lb/>was then proposed but public confidence had been lost and the case ended in international arbitration. <lb/></body>

			<body>48. <lb/>In May 1993, a 30 year concession contract was awarded to a private company to operate the <lb/>water and sewage services in Buenos Aires. Those consumers who were already connected to the system <lb/>initially benefited from a significant drop in tariffs and an improvement in the quality and reliability of <lb/>service. Expansion targets set by geographical area, with poor areas prioritised, resulted in large numbers <lb/>of new households being connected. However, an unpopular decision to pass the cost of system expansion <lb/>on to new consumers in the form of a hefty infrastructure charge was one of the issues that lead to public <lb/>unrest and early contract renegotiation. This very high connection charge, unaffordable for the poor, was <lb/>replaced by a bimonthly Universal Service and Environmental Improvement fee (SUMA), which was <lb/>levied on all customers regardless of when they connected to the network. Connection charges were <lb/>reduced to US$ 120 for water or sewage, repayable over five-years in interest-free instalments averaging <lb/>US$ 4 per month. Despite the fact that the changes resulted in a decrease in average bills in poor areas of <lb/>74%, from US$61 to US$16, even at this level the rates remained unaffordable for the poor. In addition, <lb/>the renegotiation saw a reduction in some of the targets for expansion, again to the detriment of the poor <lb/>who are the primary residents of the unserved areas. <lb/>Source: Estache, Gomez-Lobo and Leipziger, 2000; Haselip, 2004; and Zerah, Graham-Harrison and Brocklehurst, <lb/>2001. <lb/>Regulating to achieve universal access <lb/>Universal access through a competitive mobile phone market and umbrella people in Nigeria <lb/>49. <lb/>Nigeria is Africa&apos;s most populated nation with some 124 million inhabitants in 2002. Until <lb/>August 2001, Nigeria had one of the lowest teledensity rates in the world. In February 2001, the <lb/>government awarded three 15-year mobile cellular GSM licences for USD 285 million and the rise in the <lb/>number of mobile subscribers has been very significant. By December 2001, there were close to 400 000 <lb/>GSM subscribers. The mobile operators managed to provide access to almost as many telephone <lb/>subscribers in four months than had been installed via fixed lines in 40 years since independence (there <lb/>were some 540 000 fixed lines at the end of December 2001). Growth has been relentless, reaching two <lb/>million subscribers by March 2003. Mobile coverage was initially limited to Lagos, the largest city, and <lb/>has now spread to 219 out of 550 local government areas. <lb/>50. <lb/>Although handsets and prepaid cards are expensive, service is being extended to those who <lb/>cannot afford a mobile handset and prepaid card through &quot; umbrella people &quot; . These are resellers of GSM <lb/>wireless service — most of them young women who have settled into the business of selling phone calls, <lb/>earning a high level of financial independence in the process.

Between 1995 and 2000 it supported the provision of payphone <lb/>service to more than 6,000 rural localities with about 2.2 million inhabitants, thereby reducing the <lb/>proportion of Chile&apos;s population living in places without access to basic voice communication from 15% in <lb/>1994 to 1% in 2002. In addition, some 25,000 individual rural telephone lines were provided. The <lb/>subsidies awarded cost the government less than 0.3% of total telecommunications sector revenue during <lb/>the funding period, making it one of the most cost-effective telecommunications support programme <lb/>world-wide, and Fund administration cost about 3% of the subsidies granted. <lb/>Source: Intven, Oliver and Sepúlveda, 2000; and Wellenius, 2001. <lb/>Extending access to telecommunication services to rural Peru <lb/>53. <lb/>As part of the reforms which led to the introduction of competition in its telecommunications <lb/>sector in the 1990s, Peru has established a subsidy programme, known as the Telecommunications <lb/>Investment Fund (FITEL), to finance investment in telecommunication services in rural areas. (A rural area <lb/>is mainly defined as a territory enclosing rural settlements of less than 100 housing units together or more <lb/>than 100 dispersed or scattered units.) The Supervisory Authority for Private Investment in <lb/>Telecommunications (OSIPTEL), the regulatory body for the sector, administers the fund and selects <lb/>projects to be implemented, while the Ministry for Transport and Communications is responsible for <lb/>approving them. The fund&apos;s assets come from a levy of 1 per cent on the turnover of companies. <lb/>54. <lb/>The first stage of the programme involved a pilot project for installation of public telephones in <lb/>the Frontera Norte (north frontier) area. The main objective of this pilot project was to gather knowledge of <lb/>possible drawbacks that might arise with the launch of larger scale projects. The company Gilat To Home <lb/>Perú S.A. (GTH) won the tender to offer the service in the 213 populated centres selected for the project. <lb/>The licensing and financing contracts for the project were signed at the end of 1998, which opened the way <lb/>to the full network installation by end 1999, the agreed delivery date. By mid-2001, the operator was <lb/>providing a normal service. The first assessment of the project revealed that it was a success with regard to <lb/>the use of public funds for the development of rural telephony, bringing services to the local populations <lb/>which had previously been either non-existent or of difficult access. Public investment or subsidy per <lb/>inhabitant came to USD 11, covering a total population of 144 522 inhabitants on the basis of an average <lb/>investment per populated centre of USD 8 609. Nevertheless, the first assessment also highlighted some <lb/>problems for local people, including with respect to non-availability in villages of pre-paid cards or long <lb/>periods without service after equipment failure. A subsequent inspection revealed improvements carried <lb/>out by GTH in response to comments made in the first report. <lb/>Source: ITU, 2001a. <lb/>Achieving universal access through competition and a universal service fund in the Guatemalan <lb/>telecommunications sector <lb/>55. <lb/>Until 1996, telecommunication services in Guatemala were provided by the state-owned <lb/>monopoly, GUATEL.

The 1996 law also <lb/>created a new regulatory agency, the Superintendencia de Telecomunicaciones (SIT). The reform involved <lb/>privatisation of GUATEL, which was transformed into a new company TELGUA, of which 95% stakes <lb/>were sold to the private sector via auction awarded to TELMEX — the Mexican leading <lb/>telecommunications company which was formerly owned by the state and privatised in 1990. There are <lb/>now more than 250 companies involved in providing the full range of telecommunication services in <lb/>Guatemala. These include a number of major international investors such as Bell South, Telefónica, <lb/>TELMEX and Millicom International. Although the local telephony market continues to be dominated by <lb/>TELGUA, with 95% of all fixed line subscribers, sixteen other companies have entered the market. <lb/>57. <lb/>An important consequence of liberalisation has been the need to rebalance call charges, to <lb/>remove the cross-subsidy that previously existed from long distance to local calls. As a result, local call <lb/>charges increased from $0.51 per month (for the basic subscription including 200 free minutes; equivalent <lb/>to $0.003 per minute), to $5.64 per month (equivalent to $0.028 per minute). Even this, though, falls below <lb/>the estimated economic cost of around $0.030 to $0.033 per minute. Competition for long distance services <lb/>has been more vigorous, with fourteen players, of which four major ones. The combination of tariff-<lb/>rebalancing and competition has led to dramatic reductions in long distance charges, from US$1.50 per <lb/>minute to the United States in 1996, to around US$0.30 per minute in 1998. More recently, charges have <lb/>fallen to around US$0.15 per minute as a result of the introduction of the possibility of tele-selection of the <lb/>long distance operator. <lb/>58. <lb/>Mobile telephony service was also introduced through the awarding of four licenses. Calls are <lb/>charged at around $0.14 per minute, with some calling plans costing less than $10 per month. Aided by the <lb/>rapid expansion of cellular telephony, the overall teledensity index for Guatemala has risen almost fivefold <lb/>from 4.2 to 19.7 over the period 1997/01. Although about half of the new cellular subscriptions are second <lb/>telephones for the richest 20% of the population, they are also playing an important role in rural areas <lb/>where they have become as common as fixed line telephones and have begun to be used to provide <lb/>informal public telephone services. <lb/>59. <lb/>The proceeds of the spectrum auctions held for mobile telephony services (up to an annual <lb/>ceiling of US$5 million) were allocated to a special fund (FONDETEL) designed to support the expansion <lb/>of public telephones in rural areas. In line with best practice in a number of other Latin American <lb/>countries, FONDETEL bid out the construction and operation of public telephones to the private operator <lb/>requesting the minimum subsidy. Between 1998/99, FONDETEL disbursed US$7.5 million of subsidies <lb/>for the installation of some 1,600 public telephones. Each US$1 of subsidy leveraged between US$2-4 of <lb/>private investment, so that the total subsidy cost per town was US$4,400. The network of formal public <lb/>telephones in rural areas has increased by 80% and, as result, 50% of rural households now have a public <lb/>telephone in their community, and 80% of rural households live within 6 kilometres (or about half an hour) <lb/>of a public telephone. However, unfortunately, the revenues from spectrum auctions have recently been <lb/>exhausted and no additional funding source has been identified for FONDETEL. <lb/>Source: Foster and Araujo, 2004. <lb/>Universal access through cellular phones in rural areas of Bangladesh <lb/>60. <lb/>Bangladesh is one of the world&apos;s most densely populated and poorest countries.

			<body>90s. The reform programme opened the market to competition and awarded new licenses to private <lb/>companies, including operating in the cellular phone market in 1996. <lb/>61. <lb/>A pilot project by GrameenPhone, a cellular operator with a national license that is building and <lb/>operating a rural phone network, is enabling rural village woman to resell cellular phone services within <lb/>their villages in order to extend access to telecommunications to rural areas at affordable prices. The <lb/>project is carried out by the not-for profit company Grameen Telecom and supported by its parent <lb/>company Grameen Bank, a successful for-profit micro credit bank which is widely established in <lb/>Bangladesh. GrameenPhone is a joint venture of Grameen Telecom (35 %), Norway&apos;s telephone company <lb/>Telenor (51 %) and other stakeholders. The programme began operating in March 1997 and by November <lb/>1999 there were 950 village phones providing telephone access to more than 65,000 people. The micro <lb/>credit bank provides village woman entrepreneurs with credit in form of a lease to buy digital GSM cell <lb/>phones from Grameen Telecom. The women re-sell phone calls and provide services for incoming and <lb/>outgoing calls in their stores, at home, in the local market or elsewhere. The income of the woman <lb/>operators consists of the difference between charges paid by customers and the amount billed to the <lb/>operators by Grameen Telecom. <lb/>62. <lb/>Early findings suggest that the programme has had considerable development benefits. It has <lb/>reduced the cost of communications relative to other services such as transportation. It has boosted <lb/>producers&apos; returns by enabling village pay phone users to compare rural prices with city market prices, <lb/>increasing their bargaining power. It also facilitated the flow of income between oversees workers or <lb/>workers in urban cities and their families in rural villages. Finally, the programme has enabled the village <lb/>pay phone entrepreneurs, poor by most standards but among the better-off in their villages, to turn a profit. <lb/>Still, Grameen Telecom&apos;s rural development programme lags behind the targets. Its initial target was <lb/>40,000 village pay phones installed by 2002, an average of 8,000 a year. But by the end of January 2000 it <lb/>had installed only about 1,700. <lb/>Source: Lawson and Meyenn, 2000; and Richardson, Ramirez and Haq, 2000. <lb/>Universal access in postal and courier services in Guatemala through competition and private sector <lb/>participation <lb/>63. <lb/>Guatemala maintained a state monopoly for postal services until 1997. These services were <lb/>provided by the Directorate of Post and Telegraph Services (DGCT), which operated under the Ministry of <lb/>Communications, Transportation, and Public Works. The sector was characterised by poor and unreliable <lb/>service, highly subsidised tariffs, under-paid staff and financial looses of US $2 million per year. In <lb/>addition, DGCT was not able to ensure service to the geographically remote areas. Nevertheless, service <lb/>roll-out was partly achieved by private companies. Indeed, despite the legally protected monopoly, private <lb/>firms had been operating in the postal and courier market informally since the 1970s. These companies, <lb/>ranging from very small to large international firms, like DHL, engaged in a variety of activities, including <lb/>in-city messenger, in-country delivery, international courier, and international remittance transport. Most <lb/>of the companies in the in-country market were operating regionally and for national coverage they were <lb/>subcontracting each other, especially for coverage in remote areas. The private service companies were <lb/>more expensive than DGCT (although competition helped bringing down prices), yet they reached remote <lb/>villages in the country. <lb/>64. <lb/>The competition (and better performance) by private companies lead the Government to proceed <lb/>with plans to modernise and introduce private-sector participation in the public operator. In 1997, a five <lb/>year management contract was awarded to International Post Services (IPS), a subsidiary of Canada Post, <lb/>to improve postal service and ensure an acceptable level of universal service for the entire country. The <lb/>programme included a Government subsidy paid to the operator to keep tariffs down and ensure universal <lb/></body>

			<body>service. The programme resulted in an increase of the number of access points and there were also <lb/>significant improvements in service quality, including in terms of reductions in mail processing, transit and <lb/>delivery times. The subsidy was still high, but lower than before the management contract. The resulting <lb/>enhanced sector performance has provided an incentive for the Government to award a ten year concession <lb/>contract for service provision to IPS. <lb/>Source: De Rodriguez, 1998; and World Bank, 2003. <lb/>Subsidies for power benefiting the non-poor in Guatemala <lb/>65. <lb/>In 1996, Guatemala reformed its energy sector and unbundled the generation, transmission and <lb/>distribution of electricity. The project included the privatisation of state-owned assets and regulated <lb/>concessions for distribution companies. A social tariff was created to subsidise the consumption of <lb/>electricity for poor households. In 2000, tariffs were capped at USD 0.08 per kWh for all customers <lb/>consuming less than 300kWh per month. As 90% of domestic consumers were under this threshold, the <lb/>cost of subsidies — USD 50 millions — was mostly transferred to commercial and industrial customers. <lb/>However, only 40% of poor households have access to electricity in Guatemala. The consequence was that <lb/>about 90% of the value of subsidies went to the non-poor. <lb/>66. <lb/>An important issue in this cross-subsidisation programme is that the level of the threshold to <lb/>benefit from the social tariff was too high (300kWh per month) — meaning that it was targeted to almost <lb/>all consumers rather than only the poor. But the case also highlights the importance of the connection to <lb/>the network which is often a more important obstacle to universal access than the cost of the service. <lb/>Guatemalan families without a connection to the power grid have to pay significantly more for their <lb/>electricity. For example, by relying on candles they pay the equivalent of USD 5.00 per kWh instead of <lb/>USD 0.08. <lb/>Source: Estache, Foster, and Wodon, 2001. <lb/>Providing incentives to extend water services in Senegal <lb/>67. <lb/>After different reform efforts had failed to improve water and sewage services in Senegal, the <lb/>government decided in 1996 to introduce private participation in the sector. A state-owned holding <lb/>company, SONES (Société Nationale des Eaux du Sénégal), was established to own the assets, carry out <lb/>investments and regulate the water sector. SONES signed an &quot; enhanced &quot; affermage contract with the <lb/>private company Sénégalaise des Eaux (SDE, a subsidiary of the French water company SAUR) to operate <lb/>water utilities. Under a traditional affermage contract, the private company bills all consumers and collects <lb/>the revenue at the tariff set by the government. The company then receives a fixed fee (covering costs and <lb/>a regulated profit) for the total volume of water sold and remits the difference between the revenues <lb/>collected and the fee to the government. This mechanism does not create any disincentives to serve poor <lb/>households as the company receives the same remuneration for all kinds of consumers (that is the <lb/>affermage fee is the same for each cubic meter of water sold). The contract between SONES and SDE is <lb/>said to be an &quot;enhanced&quot; affermage contract in the sense that it incorporates some investment requirements <lb/>as well as incentives in the fee formula to meet targets on leakage and bill collection. <lb/>68. <lb/>A social connection programme was designed to expand service among low-income households. <lb/>SDE receives an additional fee for each new connection in eligible poor households, through a fund <lb/>financed by the government and donors. There is a profit included in this fee to give incentives to the <lb/>company to install social connections. This programme was also consistent with the social tariff <lb/>established as part of the affermage contract which, as seen earlier, is a contract that does not create <lb/>disincentives to serve poor households. Additionally, the government financed with the help of donors and <lb/></body>

There has been a 20% <lb/>increase in the amount of water supplied, and the number of customers connected has increased by 35%. <lb/>Exceeding its target requirements, SDE has installed a cumulative total of 89,000 new connections, among <lb/>which 76% are social connections provided at low cost to poor households. According to the last <lb/>Senegalese Household Survey (2001), drinking water is available (less than 15 minutes away) to more than <lb/>70% of the households (almost 90% in Dakar). <lb/>Source: PPIAF and WSP, 2001; and Brocklehurst and Janssens, 2004. <lb/>Chilean household subsidy programme for water and sewage <lb/>70. <lb/>In 1989 Chile created a system of subsidies for water and sewage, which took effect in 1990. <lb/>Anyone who holds a social classification card (CAS), has a household water connection and is not more <lb/>than three months late in paying their water bill is eligible for the subsidy. The CAS has been in effect <lb/>since 1980 and establishes eligibility for a number of targeted subsidies in addition to water and sewage, <lb/>including a flat-rate family allowance, minimum pensions, and housing assistance. Households applying <lb/>for a CAS are visited by a municipal official who allocates points to the family based on the size and <lb/>composition of the household, the occupation and education of the household head, the assets (car, <lb/>refrigerator, land, etc.) and per capita income of the family, and the characteristics of the dwelling (e.g. <lb/>location, number of rooms, exterior and interior materials used for construction, and whether it has a water <lb/>or electrical connection). Households with less than a maximum number of points are then issued a CAS <lb/>and those with lower points receive higher priority for getting subsidies. The yearly allotments for the <lb/>water and sewage subsidy are based on bi-annual surveys of family income by region. The allotments are <lb/>allocated so as to ensure that no family in the region pays more than five percent of its income for water <lb/>and sewage. The subsidy is paid directly to the water supplier, who subtracts the appropriate amount from <lb/>each household&apos;s water bill and collects the remainder of the bill directly from the customer. On average <lb/>the subsidy covers 60% of the water bill of eligible households, although in regions with high tariffs, up to <lb/>85% may be covered. <lb/>71. <lb/>The number of Chilean households covered by the subsidy has gone from 5% of those eligible in <lb/>1990 to 95% in 1996. The expansion in coverage was largely the result of a public education campaign by <lb/>the water companies to convince eligible consumers to apply, although an easing of the conditions for <lb/>eligibility also helped. Nevertheless, recent research also shows that some amount of the subsidy has <lb/>leaked to higher income groups. In addition, the administrative costs of implementing the regime are high. <lb/>In 2002, the Government decided to redistribute a substantial number of water subsidies based on an <lb/>evaluation which showed that the subsidies were not reaching the target population precisely enough. <lb/>Subsidies are normally given for a three year period; however the conditions of a household can change <lb/>during that time and therefore lower the effectiveness of the programme. <lb/>Source: Shirley, Xu and Zuluaga, 2000; Estache, Gomez-Lobo and Leipziger, 2000; and Gomez-Lobo and Contreras, <lb/>2003. <lb/>Problems with a geographic targeting system for water subsidies in Colombia <lb/>72. <lb/>Colombia adopted a programme of cross subsidies for poor households laid out in the Public <lb/>Residential Services Law of 1994.

A geographic targeting system is used to classify locations into different levels of lower and <lb/>higher socioeconomic groups to determine which customers are eligible to receive a subsidy from the tariff <lb/></body>

The criteria are set up by the National Planning Department – a government <lb/>entity developing strategic plans for the country to promote development and economic growth which <lb/>origins date back to 1936. Households of the first, the lowest category, receive a subsidy of up to 50% of <lb/>the average service costs, those that belong to the second category receive up to 40%, and the ones <lb/>belonging to the third are given a subsidy to up to 15%. The subsidies are funded through a cross subsidy, <lb/>meaning that a surcharge has to be paid by customers of the highest household categories and by industrial <lb/>and commercial customers. The surcharges cannot exceed 20% of the water and sewage bill, and if these <lb/>are not sufficient to pay for the subsidies of the first three categories, the difference can be financed from <lb/>general tax revenues (national and provincial budgets). <lb/>73. <lb/>Almost 83% of households are classified in the first three categories, which makes the subsidy <lb/>programme very costly and difficult to finance through the surcharges. Moreover, studies show that errors <lb/>of inclusion are large, with subsidies often leaking to higher income segments of society. <lb/>Source: Gomez-Lobo and Contreras, 2003. <lb/>Regulating to meet service standards <lb/>Ensuring quality of service in the Brazilian telecommunications sector <lb/>74. <lb/>Quality of service is one of the pillars of the Brazilian telecommunication reform model, and a <lb/>high priority for the Agência Nacional de Telecomunicações (Anatel), Brazil&apos;s recently-created <lb/>independent regulatory agency of the sector. The General Plan of Quality of Service Goals for Fixed <lb/>Switched Telephone Service was issued by Resolution 30 of Anatel&apos;s Board of Directors on 29 June 1998 <lb/>shortly following Anatel&apos;s creation and before Telebrás, the monopoly telecommunications provider, was <lb/>privatised. There are 36 quality of service indicators including goals for response to request for repairs, <lb/>response to requests for change of address, response time by telephone, quality of service for public <lb/>telephones, information regarding provider selection codes for the consumer, emission levels and network <lb/>modernisation. Anatel can impose fines of up to R$ 40 million and has already fined a number of carriers <lb/>for not reaching their quality of service indicators.

The postal sector was <lb/>characterised by weak financial and operational performance, little commercial orientation and under-paid <lb/>staff. Although a monopoly for letter and other basic services existed, it was not appropriately enforced, <lb/>leading to growing unregulated competition from private providers of letter and parcel delivery services. In <lb/>the early 1990s, a reform process was initiated which led to the separation of the telecommunications and <lb/>postal public entities in 1994. The Tanzania Communications Act and the Tanzania Posts Corporation Act <lb/>established the Tanzania Telecommunications Company and the Tanzania Postal Corporation (TPC). The <lb/>reform also led to the creation of the Tanzania Communications Commission (TCC), an institution charged <lb/>to regulate postal and telecommunication tariffs, monitor quality of service, oversee competition and <lb/>safeguard network coverage and access. In 2003, the TCC merged with the Tanzania Broadcasting <lb/>Commission, establishing the Tanzania Communications Regulatory Authority (TCRA). The reforms also <lb/>led to the introduction of competition in the courier sector. Licences were granted to TPC and several <lb/>courier companies to provide express services. <lb/></body>

The board <lb/>of directors and TPC management have financial incentives to perform calculated as a percentage of <lb/>salaries and also significant penalties for under-achievement. This includes the dismissal of the Postmaster <lb/>General in a situation where targets are missed by more than 50%. Thus, the design of the contract <lb/>provides an explicit incentive to reach the set targets. The contract is audited annually by independent <lb/>consultants, including from foreign countries (New Zealand Post International Limited — now Transend <lb/>Worldwide Limited — undertook the second audit). The first audit results indicated that the targets were <lb/>met only in two areas, speed of service and security; however, the second audit results showed that targets <lb/>were met in all parameters expect business growth. <lb/>Source: Ianni and Lohmeyer, 2001; and Guislain, 2004; and UPU, 2004; and Walsh, 2001. <lb/>Improving postal services standards through a management contract in Trinidad and Tobago <lb/>77. <lb/>Until 1999, postal services in Trinidad and Tobago were provided by a division of the Ministry of <lb/>Public Utilities. It was characterised by poor financial performance, low investment and decreasing mail <lb/>volumes. The per capita mail volume stood at 12.6 pieces annually — low for an upper-middle-income <lb/>developing country — and overall mail volumes dropped by 20 % between 1995 and 1999. The quality of <lb/>service was poor with mail frequently taking seven to ten days to be delivered, and universal service <lb/>reached only 50% of households. There was a great deal of unregulated competition for regular mail <lb/>services, much based on &quot; self-delivery &quot; by utility companies. <lb/>78. <lb/>In 1999, the government initiated a reform to modernise the postal industry. It introduced the <lb/>Postal Act, which transformed the postal operator from a government department to a public postal entity, <lb/>with commercial orientation — the Trinidad and Tobago Postal Corporation (TTPost). The TTPost was <lb/>granted more management autonomy and commercial flexibility; a reserved area was maintained for letters <lb/>with the understanding that over time this would be subject to gradual liberalisation. <lb/>79. <lb/>The reform process started with a five-year management contract to improve efficiency, service <lb/>quality, extend universal network coverage and gradually reduce government support. The contract was <lb/>awarded through competitive bidding to New Zealand Post International Limited (now Transend <lb/>Worldwide Limited), which is not a private sector company but has established experience in reform <lb/>processes. Transend has the responsibility to manage TTPost in line with international best practice that <lb/>would be measured by annual quality of service and revenue targets. It has a strong financial interest in <lb/>seeing that the project succeeds, given that the contract entails a compensation package that includes a <lb/>management fee for the day-to-day service provision and for the completion of special agreed upon <lb/>projects. This compensation is enhanced with an incentive mechanism for exceeding certain performance <lb/>targets, coupled with possible fee reduction if one or more of the performance targets are not achieved. The <lb/>management operator will also share profits as TTPost&apos;s financial performance improves. The contract <lb/>involves five performance indicators, namely customer satisfaction, expanded reach of universal delivery, <lb/>standards for transit time, growth of revenue, and net income. The progress achieved is monitored and <lb/>measured by independent third-party organisations. <lb/></body>

Until the late 90s, quality of supply in the UK was regulated through <lb/>guaranteed standards of performance, which entitled consumers to compensation if the regulated firm <lb/>breaches them, and overall standards, which refer to system-level performance. Overall standards were set <lb/>for each distribution utility. In 1999, the regulator and the companies supported the introduction of an <lb/>incentive-based regime for service quality regulation. Since the necessary foundation work had not been <lb/>carried out, it was proposed that the incentive mechanisms should be developed as part of a work <lb/>programme, known as the Information and Incentives Project (IIP). The IIP is divided in two parts. The <lb/>first part defined output measures for service quality, set guidelines for improving the accuracy of their <lb/>measurement, and constructed a framework for reporting and monitoring. The second part of the IIP <lb/>focused on designing an incentive scheme for service quality regulation. This scheme, which is similar to a <lb/>quality-incorporated benchmarking system, links the quality performance of the utilities to their allowed <lb/>revenue. It consists of mechanisms that penalise companies for not meeting their quality of supply targets <lb/>and reward companies that exceed them, including by guaranteeing less strict standards for the next control <lb/>period. <lb/>82. <lb/>The reform of the UK electricity industry led to a noticeable improvement of service quality. <lb/>Between 1995 and 2000, both the number and duration of interruptions have decreased. The average time <lb/>lost per connected customer due to planned outages has dropped from 16.3 minutes to 9.4 minutes. The <lb/>duration of the fault-related interruptions has also declined, albeit to a lesser extent. <lb/>Source: Giannakis, Jamasb and Pollitt, 2003. <lb/>Improving access to electricity in rural Chile through alternative technologies <lb/>83. <lb/>In 1994 Chile launched a subsidy programme to extend access to electricity in rural areas. Most <lb/>of the projects have involved extension of the grid, a solution that usually means a lower cost per <lb/>connected dwelling and a higher quality of service. But several projects have relied on alternative <lb/>technologies, primarily one-house photovoltaic systems. These systems have been installed in isolated <lb/>areas in the northern part of the country (for nearly 1,000 dwellings), which has some of the strongest solar <lb/>radiation in the world. These non-conventional technologies generally provide electricity at a higher cost <lb/>and poorer quality (lower voltage, fewer hours of service). But they have been an attractive alternative <lb/>where extending the grid is too costly because of the distance from the existing grid or the high dispersion <lb/>of dwellings, both of which have increased the marginal cost of rural electrification in Chile. In 1995 the <lb/>average state subsidy per dwelling amounted to US$1,080; in 1999 it reached US$1,510. This outcome is <lb/>nevertheless consistent with the programme&apos;s goal of maximising rural electricity coverage within budget <lb/>constraints. At the same time, it allows a growing role for non-conventional technologies in rural <lb/>electrification projects, as improvements in these technologies can reduce their costs and make them <lb/>increasingly competitive with conventional solutions. <lb/></body>

			<body>Expanding access to electricity in rural Kenya through alternative technologies <lb/>84. <lb/>The 1997 Kenya Electric Power Act liberalised the power sector in the country and privatised the <lb/>main power company, Kenya Power and Light — though the government still owns a controlling share. <lb/>Kenya Power and Light now buys electricity from three new independent power producers, and more <lb/>independent producers are preparing to enter the market. While Kenya Power and Light retains a <lb/>monopoly on distribution, privatisation has forced the utility to carefully scrutinise programmes that are <lb/>not cost-effective, including its rural areas. It has limited generation capacity, about 800 megawatts in <lb/>1999, and has made urban and industrial customers a priority. During the same year, less than two percent <lb/>of the rural population had access to grid electricity, and efforts of the utility to extend access failed, partly <lb/>because of the sparse rural population. <lb/>85. <lb/>As result, some rural households started to use photovoltaic systems to supply electricity <lb/>provided by private companies. The process began in the early 80s when upper-middle class households, <lb/>NGOs and donors of aid projects installed photovoltaic systems in off-grid areas. Since the 90s large <lb/>numbers of rural households started to buy small photovoltaic panels and batteries. About 120,000 solar <lb/>photovoltaic systems for household use were sold in Kenya and between 1992 and 1998 the market grew <lb/>by more than 20% a year. Although early on the process was benefiting mostly upper-middle class <lb/>households, technological innovation made it possible to supply smaller and cheaper products. <lb/>Competition also contributed to lowering the retail price for a photovoltaic system from about US$100 in <lb/>1990 to US$65 in 1998. Furthermore, the introduction of finance agencies has allowed lower-income <lb/>households to buy photovoltaic systems on credit. <lb/>86. <lb/>The introduction of photovoltaic systems through private entrepreneurs has shown to be <lb/>successful in extending electricity access to the rural population. Since 1990, more than 2.5 megawatts of <lb/>photovoltaic capacity have been sold in Kenya. The rural electrification programme of the utility connected <lb/>fewer than 21,000 households between 1995 and 1999, while during the same period more than 80,000 <lb/>households bought solar systems. By 1999, 3 to 4 % of the rural population had acquired a photovoltaic <lb/>system. <lb/>Source: Hankins, 2000. <lb/>Adapting service standards to permit extensions of low-cost water supply and sewage in El Alto <lb/>87. <lb/>In 1997, the then recently-established independent Bolivian regulator (Superintendencia de <lb/>Aguas) approved a Suez-led concession contract for Aguas del Illimani to provide water and sewage <lb/>services in La Paz and El Alto. The contract contained explicit targets for connecting poor households but <lb/>did not provide adequate financial incentives for the company to do so. Moreover, the government did not <lb/>provide targeted subsidies to ease affordability. The concession contract stated that metered, in-house <lb/>water and sewer connections were the only acceptable technology, which put service out of reach of poor <lb/>households and essentially guaranteed that the company would fail to meet its ambitious target of universal <lb/>water coverage within four years. Recognising this dilemma, the regulator and the company agreed to <lb/>experiment with cheaper technology for providing connections. Most notably, the regulator approved the <lb/>establishment of lower-cost condominial sewer and water connections. These systems provide in-house <lb/>connections at lower cost by using smaller pipe diameters and burying pipes in shallow trenches in yards or <lb/>under sidewalks. The technology was found to be acceptable to the unserved population, and has allowed <lb/>affordable service to be extended in the poor neighbourhoods of El Alto and La Paz. In 2001 the <lb/>condominial technology was recognised by the Bolivian Institute for Technical Norms and Standards. <lb/></body>

			<body>Adapting standards to expand access to water and sewage to the poor in Manila <lb/>88. <lb/>Manila introduced private participation in its water and sewage network in 1997 under two <lb/>separate concessions. The two concessionaires have been encouraged to use innovative technology and <lb/>third-party provision by contracts which do not contain strict standards for what constitutes a connection, <lb/>do not disallow third-party provision and allow the concessionaire to add households served through means <lb/>other than conventional utility connections to the covered population for the calculation of compliance <lb/>with coverage targets. <lb/>89. <lb/>Responding to the need for alternatives for reaching the poor, one of the concessionaires has <lb/>developed a system known as Bayan-Tubig (Water for the Community), for water delivery in densely-<lb/>populated, hard-to-reach slum areas. An underground water line carries water to the perimeter of a slum <lb/>neighbourhood, and is then extended above ground, partially covered, attached to a wall, or lying on the <lb/>surface. The line connects to a battery of meters from where each homeowner makes their own plastic <lb/>connection, using small diameter pipes running from the main to households on the surface or along walls. <lb/>Maintenance responsibility for the plastic pipes lies with the customers. Community-based organisations <lb/>and NGOs play a role in intermediation and mapping of the network. <lb/>90. <lb/>Estimates suggest that the Bayan-Tubig connections have reduced water connection costs for <lb/>poor families by up to 25%. As even these reduced costs are sometimes a challenge, the concessionaire has <lb/>also introduced interest-free repayment schemes over 6 to 24 month periods. Introduced in early 1999, the <lb/>programme had provided water connections to 19,000 poor households by the end of that year, and as of <lb/>2001 the figure had risen to over 50,000. The other concessionaire was equally unconventional in serving <lb/>the poor, arranging to sell bulk water to a steel tank manufacturing company which then installed small <lb/>networks to serve poor communities. <lb/>Source: PPIAF, 2002.

It alleged that the same discount should apply to all calls in either direction between fixed <lb/>and mobile stations for its customers as well. The Agency reviewed the case at the request of Médi <lb/>Télécom, and decided that the application of discounts for Maroc Télécom customers only was <lb/>discriminatory and constituted an abuse of Maroc Télécom&apos;s dominant position with respect to the fixed <lb/>network. An initial injunction was therefore issued at the end of February 2001, in which ANRT reviewed <lb/>the facts of the case and instructed Maroc Télécom to adhere strictly to the conditions set out in its terms of <lb/>reference. Since Maroc Télécom did not respond within the allotted 30-day period for doing so, ANRT <lb/>placed Maroc Télécom on notice, giving it 30 days to remedy the situation or otherwise face penalties up to <lb/>permanent withdrawal of the license. Subsequently, Maroc Télécom complied with the regulator&apos;s <lb/>decision. <lb/>Source: ITU, 2001c. <lb/>Peruvian Court for consumer dispute resolution in the telecommunications sector <lb/>93. <lb/>The Peruvian Administrative Court for consumer dispute resolution (TRASU) was created in <lb/>1995 by the regulator, OSIPTEL. TRASU decisions are made on behalf of OSIPTEL, but its decisions are <lb/>taken independently from OSIPTEL&apos;s Board of Directors and administration. TRASU intervenes only once <lb/>the consumer appeals the operator&apos;s response to a claim. Conciliation between the operator and the <lb/>consumer may be possible during the process. TRASU is a six-member collegiate body, supported by a <lb/>technical secretariat. OSIPTEL&apos;s Board of Directors appoints members to TRASU for an undefined term. <lb/>Members are professionals of high standing who serve on a part-time basis. The technical secretariat is <lb/>staffed with competent professionals that support the administrative court decisions. TRASU issues <lb/>guidelines on how it analyses complaints, which are based on previous cases and signal to consumers and <lb/>operators the likely outcome of future decisions. TRASU also rules on the proof needed to resolve claims, <lb/>and which party bears the burden of proof. In case of complaints regarding fixed line local calls, TRASU is <lb/>authorised to ask for the following as evidence: reports on faulty service; records of technical inspection; <lb/>average and variable measured local service usage; itemised call reports; and call investigation <lb/>information. <lb/>94. <lb/>TRASU has the power to interpret and solve claims regarding all telecommunication services, <lb/>which are related to infringements of consumer rights, including billing, installation, and quality of service. <lb/>It can also impose fines if the operator fails to abide by its decisions. TRASU can also rule on procedural <lb/>grounds, e.g. imposing a default judgment in favour of the consumer if the operator fails to meet a court-<lb/>imposed deadline to resolve the consumer&apos;s case. Although TRASU&apos;s decisions may be appealed to the <lb/>courts, few are. Parties are not charged for TRASU´s services, unless there is a clear case of misuse of the <lb/>claim procedure. About 48% of the 35,000 claims handled by TRASU during 1995-2001 were resolved in <lb/>favour of consumers.

			<body>96. <lb/>There are three main reasons for this. The first is that the President appoints all members of the <lb/>NCA Board. Thus, the Board can be removed at any time by the President for &quot; stated reasons &quot; , leaving the <lb/>appointment of the Board open to possible political interference. Further, the formation of the Board was <lb/>delayed — there was no Director-General and the Acting Director was changed three times in the first <lb/>three years. The Board was finally named in 2000 just before the parliamentary elections, but after these <lb/>elections, won by the opposition, a new Board was appointed. Second, the law subjects the NCA&apos;s <lb/>functions to the directions of the Minister of Communications who, since 2000, also serves as the <lb/>Chairman of the Board. For instance, according to the law, &quot; (the Minister) may give to the Authority such <lb/>directions of a general character as appear to him to be required in the public interest relating to the <lb/>discharge of the functions of the Authority &quot; . Thus, the functions of the NCA could also be open to political <lb/>interference. Third, the financial autonomy of the NCA has been seen as excessive. The law empowers it to <lb/>generate funds by requiring payment of a fixed percentage of the total turnover of fixed and mobile phone <lb/>operators. The NCA also collects a further one percent of operators&apos; turnover for the Ghana Investment <lb/>Fund for Telecommunications (GIFTEL) to promote rural telephony in particular and development of <lb/>telecommunications in general. The use of these funds by the NCA has, however, not been specified in the <lb/>law apart from the annual report that the Board must present to the President through the sectoral Minister. <lb/>Source: Ahortor, 2003; and Haggarty, Shirley and Wallsten, 2002. <lb/>Difficulties in establishing effective regulatory bodies in the Indian telecommunications sector <lb/>97. <lb/>India started a gradual liberalisation of its telecommunications sector in 1985. The decision to <lb/>open the wireless telephone market to private companies was taken in 1991 and was implemented in 1994. <lb/>The government&apos;s licenses plan divided the Nation into four large metropolitan areas. Auctions were <lb/>organised to select private companies, from which State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs) in charge of fixed lines <lb/>were barred from participating. Licenses were awarded in the four cities in November 1994 and the <lb/>companies began their operations in 1997. However, competition with incumbent SOEs was weakened <lb/>when the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) allowed SOEs into wireless service in 1996 without <lb/>paying the license fee (or the interconnection charges paid by the private companies). The DoT also <lb/>decided to increase the interconnection charge, further weakening competition. <lb/>98. <lb/>In 1997, a new independent regulator was established, the Telecommunications Regulatory <lb/>Agency of India (TRAI). From its inception, TRAI sought to increase the level of competition among <lb/>operators. It asserted its authority on interconnection prices and asked the government to renounce the <lb/>increase in the interconnection charge. DoT sued TRAI and the High Court ruled that the regulator lacked <lb/>the authority to ask for the rate change. A second conflict occurred over TRAI&apos;s attempt to introduce <lb/> &quot; calling party pays &quot; for interconnections from fixed to wireless telephones (to discourage people from not <lb/>answering their mobile phones and calling back from their fixed line), which TRAI again lost. The next <lb/>battle was between DoT and wireless carriers who where unable to pay their license fees. From the <lb/>government&apos;s point of view, this was the result of over-bidding and poor business decisions, whereas <lb/>operators argued that the government&apos;s inadequate pricing rules prevented them from being commercially <lb/>viable. Unpaid license fees soared and the DoT started to withdraw interconnection from operators unable <lb/>to pay. By early 1999, the Indian telecommunications reform was under significant pressure, with a <lb/>regulator without authority over prices and entry decisions, and many private entrants almost bankrupt and <lb/>unable to compete with SOEs. <lb/>99. <lb/>In March 1999, in an attempt to solve these problems, a new policy was adopted which gave <lb/>TRAI the authority to regulate prices and to adjudicate disputes between SOEs and private entrants. <lb/>Following further controversies, the reform was appealed and a new ruling of the High Court vacated the <lb/>authority of TRAI over the DoT. In January 2000, the government adopted an ordnance that removed <lb/>authority over telecommunications from the High Court and created a Telecommunications Dispute <lb/></body>

ENCOTEL was providing a universal service consisting of the collection and delivery of <lb/>ordinary mail items up to 20 grams, the handling of standard telegrams up to 20 words and giro checks up <lb/>to ARS1000 ($1). The state-owned operator was characterised by poor service, low productivity, limited <lb/>management information and losses of over $150 millions per annum. The monopoly, though, already <lb/>started to weaken in the 70s with the Postal Law allowing private companies to obtain &quot; permissions &quot; to <lb/>service the market. By 1994, about 300 private sector companies were operating in the market with a share <lb/>of 50%, though only 4 were of significant size. <lb/>101. <lb/>In 1992, the Government of Argentina introduced a decree that established a new regulator for <lb/>the sector, the National Post and Telegraph Commission (CNCT), clearly separating the regulatory and <lb/>operating functions. At the same time, ENCOTEL started to operate under private law and became the <lb/>National Post and Telegraph Company (ENCOTESA). One year later, in 1993, the postal monopoly was <lb/>abolished and the market was officially opened to private participation. <lb/>102. <lb/>In 1997 the Government decided to introduce private sector participation in ENCOTESA through <lb/>a 30 year concession contract. The competitive tendering process was awarded to the Macri Group, a local <lb/>consortium, with technical expertise provided by the British Post Office. ENCOTESA was to provide basic <lb/>universal service set at pre-concession levels. Tariffs for these services were also fixed at pre-concession <lb/>levels whereas ENCOTESA was free to set prices for the other services. The concession holder was further <lb/>obliged to invest US $250 million over the first ten years to improve outlets and service provision. It was <lb/>also required to pay a fee for the rights to the concession of USD 104 million per annum in two six-<lb/>monthly tranches. At the same time, an effective regulatory framework was not put in place in the case of <lb/>the other private operators of postal services. No license was required for private companies to access the <lb/>postal market, except for a subscription in the Public Register of the Suppliers of Postal Services and the <lb/>payment of an annual sum of US $5000. In addition, there were no requisites for quality standards and <lb/>private companies were also excluded from requirements of universal postal service. <lb/>103. <lb/>The concession initially led to several improvements, including with respect to efficiency through <lb/>inter alia automation of administrative functions and installation of telecommunication networks <lb/>integrating the first 500 of the mail&apos;s 1,500 branches, thereby offering new services. Financial losses were <lb/>increasingly reduced and reached USD 20 million in 1999. However, the lack of a sound regulatory <lb/>framework to underpin liberalisation coupled with large financial demands on ENCOTESA (fee payments <lb/>plus investment requirements) meant that this process came to a halt. While there has been no contraction <lb/>of services in rural areas neither has there been any significant roll-out of new addresses or postal outlets in <lb/>the country-side. Similarly, limited efforts were made to improve quality of service. <lb/></body>

All <lb/>the private operators are required to obtain ISO 9000 approval as a condition to retain their licenses and <lb/>Article 48 provides for warnings, fines, and temporary or permanent withdrawal of operating rights for <lb/>infringing the regulations. <lb/>Source: Fontdevila and Jensen, 2003; and Walsh, 2001. <lb/>Effective regulation to ensure competition in the postal services in Sweden <lb/>105. <lb/>In 1993, the Swedish postal monopoly was abolished and the postal operator was transformed <lb/>from a government agency to a limited liability company owned by the state, Sweden Post. Since then, <lb/>there are no reserved areas maintained in the postal market and a regulatory authority was established, the <lb/>National Post and Telecom Agency (PTS). PTS is an independent regulator monitoring the liberalised <lb/>postal market, including with respect to pricing, quality of service, and competition in the sector. <lb/>Additionally, during the same period, the Swedish Competition Authority was established charged to <lb/>implement the general competition law in Sweden. The letter mail market is dominated by Sweden Post, <lb/>with a market share of 93% in 2003. Its biggest competitor, CityMail, had a market share of 6.5% during <lb/>the same year while the remaining 0.5% of the letter mail market is handled by 26 local postal operators. <lb/>106. <lb/>Competition rules have been an effective instrument to deal with anti-competitive behaviour in <lb/>the Swedish postal market. Since 1993, the Swedish Competition Authority has had more than a hundred <lb/>cases concerning Sweden Post. In one case, Sweden Post had exclusive agreement conditions tying <lb/>customers into buying from it all or the majority of their distribution needs. The Competition Authority <lb/>considered these practices an abuse of Sweden Post&apos;s dominant position and the Stockholm City Court <lb/>ordered Sweden Post to pay a fine of SEK 3.8 million for infringing the law. In another case, Sweden Post <lb/>applied a zonal pricing scheme for bulk mail postal services. The pricing structure meant that a lower rate <lb/>would be applied to distribution in 19 places/areas, which were then further subdivided into 3 zones. The <lb/>lowest rate was in the area that covered the three largest urban regions — Stockholm, Göteborg and <lb/>Malmö. The Authority considered that Sweden Post&apos;s pricing did not reflect the way individual customers <lb/>purchased postal distribution services, and that they were designed to make it difficult for other companies <lb/>to compete. The practice was thus considered an abuse of Sweden Post&apos;s dominant position and the <lb/>company was ordered under penalty of a fine not to apply zonal pricing. In yet another case, Sweden Post <lb/>applied a &quot; cream skimming&apos;&apos; clause. This meant that customers could anticipate a price increase if they <lb/>purchased a part of their distributional needs from CityMail. The Competition Authority ruled that this was <lb/>a violation of the law, particularly as this practice did not entail any provision of information to customers <lb/>on the price consequences of not purchasing all their needs from Sweden Post. <lb/>Source: Jonsson, 2004; King, 2001; PTS, 1999; and Svensson, 1998. <lb/>An independent regulatory agency in the Chilean water supply sector <lb/>107. <lb/>The Chilean reform of the water supply sector greatly strengthened monitoring, by replacing a <lb/>hands-on government agency with an independent, arms-length regulator. Before reform, the Santiago <lb/>Metropolitan Sanitary Works Enterprise (EMOS) was under the supervision of SENDOS (Servicio <lb/>Nacional de Obras Sanitarias), an arm of the Ministry of Public Works. The reform created an independent <lb/>regulatory agency, the Superintendency of Sanitary Services (SSS), designed to signal government&apos;s <lb/>commitment to potential private investors and avoid consumer exploitation. <lb/>108. <lb/>The organisational design of the SSS was detailed in a law that mandated a small, professional <lb/>staff with above average civil service salaries. The SSS&apos;s maximum professional staff cannot exceed 45 <lb/>according to the law, while SENDOS had over 300 staff when it was dissolved in 1990. Although the staff <lb/></body>

			<body>of both agencies were civil servants, the salaries for SSS professionals are similar to those of bank or stock <lb/>market regulators, and hence higher than those which SENDOS could pay. All SSS professional staff have <lb/>completed at least four years of higher education, which was not true in SENDOS, and most are engineers. <lb/>Unlike SENDOS, the SSS has no management responsibilities. Its focus is on measuring cost and <lb/>efficiency in the context of tariff adjustments and on assuring compliance with quality standards and <lb/>investment plans. In addition, the new regulatory contract for EMOS signals government commitment to <lb/>reform by including specific provisions related to enforcement against government reneging of the <lb/>contract. Any water company can appeal a dispute over tariffs to the SSS within 30 days. If the SSS and <lb/>the company fail to reach agreement, a panel of three arbitrators — one appointed by the company, one by <lb/>the government and one jointly agreed — has 37 days to reach a decision that both sides must accept. <lb/>Decisions can also be appealed to the courts. The fact that utilities can appeal the decision of the regulator <lb/>increases the credibility of the contract. <lb/>Source: Shirley, Xu and Zuluaga, 2000. <lb/>Transparency and users&apos; involvement <lb/>Citizen Report Cards in Bangalore <lb/>109. <lb/>The Public Affairs Centre (PAC) in Bangalore, India, has done pioneering work on Citizen <lb/>Report Cards over the past decade. The first report card on Bangalore&apos;s public agencies in 1994 covered <lb/>municipal services, water supply, electricity, telecom and transport. Since then, PAC has brought out report <lb/>cards on several other cities, rural services and also on social services such as health care. The findings of <lb/>the first CRC on Bangalore were most striking. Almost all the public service providers received low ratings <lb/>from the people. Agencies were rated and compared in terms of public satisfaction, corruption and <lb/>responsiveness. The media publicity that the findings received, and the public discussions that followed, <lb/>brought the issue of public services out in the open. Civil society groups began to organise themselves to <lb/>voice their demands for better performance. Some of the public agencies responded to these demands and <lb/>took steps to improve their services. The inter-agency comparisons and the associated public glare seem to <lb/>have contributed to this outcome. When the second report card on Bangalore came out in 1999, these <lb/>improvements were reflected in the somewhat better ratings that the agencies received. Still several <lb/>agencies remained indifferent and corruption levels continued to be high. The third CRC on Bangalore, in <lb/>2003, has shown a surprising turnaround in the city&apos;s services. It noted a remarkable rise in the citizen <lb/>ratings of almost all the agencies. Not only did public satisfaction improve across the board, but problem <lb/>incidence and corruption seem to have declined perceptibly in the routine transactions between the public <lb/>and the agencies. It is clear that more decisive steps have been taken by the agencies to improve services <lb/>between 1999 and 2003. <lb/>Source: Paul, 2004; and Ravindra, 2004. <lb/>Transparency in Peru&apos;s telecommunications regulator <lb/>110. <lb/>OSIPTEL, Peru&apos;s regulatory body for the telecommunications sector, has established several <lb/>mechanisms to generate a greater level of transparency in its daily activities and especially in its decision <lb/>making.

			<body>PART II: NETWORK INFRASTRUCTURE SERVICES AND THE GATS <lb/>I. <lb/>Introduction <lb/>114. <lb/>The aim of this part of the study is to complement Part I by linking the discussion of the <lb/>liberalisation of network infrastructure services at the national level with the GATS. It explores the main <lb/>issues related to these services in current GATS negotiations in terms of new possibilities for progress in <lb/>light of real liberalisation taking place in many countries and of important considerations specific to these <lb/>services. <lb/>115. <lb/>More precisely, this part of the study starts from the premise that to date, with the exception of <lb/>telecommunication services, progress on bound liberalisation of network infrastructure services under the <lb/>GATS has been limited. This notwithstanding the potential gains that can be derived by making GATS <lb/>commitments in these services. It thus reviews some of the key concerns potentially influencing WTO <lb/>Members&apos; decisions not to enter commitments in these services and attempts to address them. <lb/>116. <lb/>In particular, it reviews problems raised in relation to the main classification instruments used by <lb/>WTO Members in making commitments in network infrastructure services and what options are available <lb/>to countries in this regard. It then examines key GATS provisions that may be relevant for the provision of <lb/>these services to the public. The discussion in Part I shows that there is a strong public service aspect to the <lb/>provision of network infrastructure services and that they require an appropriate regulatory framework to <lb/>ensure social objectives, such as availability, quality and affordability of service. The aim here is to address <lb/>concerns raised in relation to the potential impact of the GATS on governments&apos; control over the provision <lb/>of these services and explore how its framework can accommodate and support the objectives of national <lb/>polices. <lb/>117. <lb/>Like other international treaties, GATS disciplines can put regulatory constraints on Member <lb/>governments. Yet countries accept such disciplines because they deem them necessary to reaping the full <lb/>benefits from international cooperation in a rules-based system. The underlying thread throughout this part <lb/>of the study is that the GATS affords wide flexibility for Members to tailor obligations to their national <lb/>policy objectives. <lb/>118. <lb/>The next section reviews the benefits that may arise from enhanced GATS commitments in <lb/>network infrastructure services. Section III then discusses the limited progress achieved so far on <lb/>liberalising these services under the GATS. Section IV presents the main issues related to the classification <lb/>of network infrastructure services in the context of the GATS. The remaining sections assess whether main <lb/>GATS disciplines may lead to a loss of government ability to ensure adequate provision of these services <lb/>to the public. <lb/>II. <lb/>Benefits of improved GATS commitments <lb/>119. <lb/>It is important to recall the economic case that underpins bound liberalisation of network <lb/>infrastructure services under the GATS. Enhanced GATS commitments in these services can create <lb/>momentum for further domestic sector reform and much needed investment capital, and can anchor these <lb/>reforms within an international legal framework. GATS commitments can also provide a credible signal <lb/></body>

			<note place="headnote">TD/TC/WP(2004)51/FINAL <lb/></note>

			<page>35 <lb/></page>

			<body>that the government is committed to sector reform and has taken the necessary legal and regulatory <lb/>measures to allow for such investment (Bressie et al., 2004). <lb/>120. <lb/>In particular, GATS commitments send a signal to WTO Member governments and, in turn, their <lb/>investors, that there will be a rules-based, transparent, predictable and non-discriminatory regime in place. <lb/>In addition, the dispute settlement system provides an avenue of recourse should a country&apos;s <lb/>implementation of sector reforms fail to satisfy that country&apos;s GATS commitments. Investors who may <lb/>have questioned the government&apos;s commitment to sector reform can rest assured that there is an <lb/>international process for settling these disputes (through their governments) where a WTO Member has <lb/>undertaken GATS commitments in that sector. Without such commitments, investors would have to rely <lb/>solely on domestic legal remedies or international arbitration, if such recourse is available. WTO <lb/>commitments can thus contribute to improve the investment climate and increase the likelihood of new <lb/>investment in the sector. <lb/>121. <lb/>This new investment can in turn provide capital, as well as technical and managerial expertise, to <lb/>build and expand the networks and services. This can be particularly important for network infrastructure <lb/>services which, as seen in Part I, require huge amounts of capital investment. <lb/>122. <lb/>Another dimension of GATS commitments relates to the mercantilist nature of trade negotiations. <lb/>While considerable unilateral liberalisation of trade in services has taken place, it has been uneven, <lb/>especially in areas of export interest to developing countries. However, in trade negotiations, some <lb/>leverage for obtaining commitments from trading partners can be generated if a Member signals a <lb/>willingness to make GATS commitments in sectors or modes of export interest or in other parts of the <lb/>WTO agenda. <lb/>III. <lb/>Uneven and limited progress to date <lb/>123. <lb/>Notwithstanding these benefits, with the exception of telecommunication services, progress on <lb/>committing these services under the GATS has been limited. The telecommunications sector is one of the <lb/>most committed sectors overall. 105 WTO Members (counting EC Member States individually) have made <lb/>specific commitments concerning some aspect of the telecommunications sector. In basic <lb/>telecommunications, commitments have been made by 104 governments, 90 of whom committed during or <lb/>since the negotiations on basic telecommunications that took place after the end of the Uruguay Round. <lb/>Their suppliers account for well in excess of 90% of the world&apos;s total telecommunications revenues. In the <lb/>area of value-added telecommunication services, 89 governments have made commitments. It should be <lb/>recognised, however, that commitments may imply very different levels of access depending on the <lb/>limitations scheduled. <lb/>124. <lb/>Nevertheless, the situation is quite different in the case of the other sectors. Including the post-<lb/>Uruguay Round accession countries, few WTO Members have made commitments in postal services, <lb/>although more Members have committed to courier services (10 and 49 respectively). About 17 <lb/>commitments were made on energy distribution, and 56 commitments (counting EC Member States <lb/>individually) were made on waste water management services. No commitments have been made on water <lb/>distribution services. <lb/>125. <lb/>This varied situation is due to a combination of factors. First, introduction of competition in the <lb/>telecommunications sector, which has been more widely embraced than in other infrastructure sectors, has <lb/>lead to significant price decreases and improved service world-wide. The working group established during <lb/>the Uruguay Round succeeded in producing a substantive sectoral Annex for the sector. The Annex on <lb/>Telecommunications sets out guarantees of reasonable access to and use of basic telecommunication <lb/>services provided by public operators. In addition, unlike the other sectors, telecommunication services <lb/></body>

			<note place="headnote">TD/TC/WP(2004)51/FINAL <lb/></note>

			<page>36 <lb/></page>

			<body>were negotiated by WTO Members as a separate negotiation dedicated to the sector following the Uruguay <lb/>Round. The Reference Paper on Basic Telecommunications (hereafter the &quot; Reference Paper &quot; ) also <lb/>emerged in the separate negotiations. The Reference Paper consists of a set of obligations for a pro-<lb/>competitive regulatory framework for basic telecommunications that become legally binding obligations <lb/>when a Member adds these to its schedule of commitments. To date, 78 Members have committed to the <lb/>Reference Paper in whole or with few, if any departures. <lb/>126. <lb/>Conversely, as seen in Part I, the introduction of competition has been more gradual or difficult <lb/>in the other sectors. Nevertheless, since the Uruguay Round significant reforms to introduce competition <lb/>have been undertaken which have changed the market characteristics of these services in many countries. <lb/>So there seems to be scope now to achieve more progress at the multilateral level and the Doha Round <lb/>offers WTO Members an opportunity for anchoring recent policy reforms, giving them more permanency <lb/>in a flexible and progressive manner. <lb/>127. <lb/>Yet so far, with the possible exception of telecommunications, only relatively few Members have <lb/>tabled new or improved offers in these services and developing countries&apos; participation remains limited. To <lb/>date, only a few Members have offered new commitments or improved upon or clarified existing <lb/>commitments in the relevant network infrastructure services: telecommunications (36), postal services and <lb/>courier services (15) energy services (14) and waste water treatment services (13). <lb/>IV. <lb/>Classification of network infrastructure services <lb/>128. <lb/>Part of the reason explaining this lack of progress relates to classification issues. Two main <lb/>instruments are used in the WTO for this purpose: the GATS Services Sectoral Classification List <lb/>(commonly referred to as W/120) and the United Nations Provisional Central Product Classification <lb/>(Provisional CPC). W/120 lists 12 services sectors, disaggregated in about 160 sub-sectors, indicating for <lb/>each of them the corresponding Provisional CPC number. The GATS does not oblige Members to use any <lb/>specific classification instruments, though once included in a schedule of commitments the corresponding <lb/>classification becomes legally binding. <lb/>129. <lb/>For the most part, the concerns seem to reflect the way in which network infrastructure services <lb/>were provided at the time the classifications were developed. For instance, energy services are not <lb/>classified as a separate section under W/120. The few GATS commitments on energy services are <lb/>scheduled under pipeline transportation of fuels under transport services and as several entries such as <lb/>technical testing and analysis, and services incidental to mining and energy distribution under other <lb/>business services. This is largely due to the fact that energy markets were characterised at the time of the <lb/>Uruguay Round by vertically-integrated, state-owned monopolies, operating mainly in national markets, <lb/>especially in the case of electricity companies. Moreover, it had been a traditional practice in the energy <lb/>sector not to draw clear lines of distinction between goods and services. This was inconsistent with the <lb/>rationale of the Round, which was based on the clear and precise identification of trade-related services. <lb/>130. <lb/>Similar issues also arise in the case of postal/courier and environmental services. The Provisional <lb/>CPC classifies postal services as the relevant delivery services carried out exclusively by national postal <lb/>administrations and courier services as essentially the same delivery services performed by private <lb/>companies. In reality, public postal administrations and private companies compete not only in a number of <lb/>services traditionally open, such as parcel and express delivery, but also in services once more commonly <lb/>reserved to public postal administrations. Several countries are also of the view that W/120 and the <lb/>Provisional CPC — which comprise sewage services, refuse-disposal services, sanitation and similar <lb/>services and other services — are outdated and do not reflect commercial realities in environmental <lb/>services as they focus mainly on waste management and pollution control. <lb/></body>

			<note place="headnote">TD/TC/WP(2004)51/FINAL <lb/></note>

			<page>37 <lb/></page>

			<body>131. <lb/>Furthermore, one important feature of the GATS classification (and of most classifications) is <lb/>that services sectors are broken down into segments, which in reality are often bundled with other <lb/>activities, such as transportation, engineering, construction and financial services. For example, one <lb/>characteristic of postal and courier services is that they typically own their own fleets of trucks and even <lb/>airplanes. They are thus also dependent on commitments in air and road transport services that are <lb/>identified as sectors in their own right in W/120. Road transport may be a significant means of delivery for <lb/>parcels and other items within geographic regions or contiguous countries, and air transport is the <lb/>predominant means of delivery among distant locations. This can have important implications for the value <lb/>of commitments when, for example, different levels of market access are extended to different activities <lb/>that as a practical matter are inter-dependent or supplied in a bundled manner. <lb/>Options available to WTO Members in current negotiations <lb/>132. <lb/>These definitional issues are important because they define the extent to which specific <lb/>commitments apply to a given market. WTO Members have thus been discussing ways to modernise the <lb/>classifications under W/120 and ideas have been put forward to address the related concerns. While in light <lb/>of divergent views it may be difficult in the short-term to agree on new classification instruments, as noted <lb/>earlier, WTO Members are not required to use any particular classification and the Members concerned are <lb/>free to modify the classifications contained in their schedules of commitments (as long as consistency with <lb/>previous commitments is maintained). By the same token, those Members that consider that W/120 <lb/>remains a valid framework to schedule commitments in the relevant sectors can simply maintain it in their <lb/>schedules. <lb/>133. <lb/>For example, in the case of energy several proposals have been tabled by some WTO Members <lb/>concerning the organisation of W/120, with the aim of creating a definition of the sector to facilitate the <lb/>scheduling of commitments. Most of the negotiating proposals define the scope of the energy services <lb/>sector as covering the whole chain of energy activities (from resource identification to transmission and <lb/>distribution). They suggest new classifications or &quot; scheduling guides &quot; that can be used to make <lb/>commitments under the existing classification structure (from recent discussions it seems that these WTO <lb/>Members have abandoned the idea to introduce a new entry for energy in W/120). Some countries <lb/>(Norway and the US) have then presented offers that include a separate energy-related section in the <lb/>schedule. Meanwhile, other Members have made offers containing energy-related commitments under <lb/>other related categories such as transport and business services. <lb/>134. <lb/>For postal and courier services the main issue relates to the integration of courier services into <lb/>postal services, given that the original premise for having separate classifications no longer applies. Most <lb/>submissions thus propose removal of the distinction between postal and courier services. In environmental <lb/>services, several Members have proposed revised classifications of the sector, they felt better reflect the <lb/>commercial realities of the sector. Here again, while some Members have made offers which have de facto <lb/>adopted a new classification for environmental services, other Members have simply retained W/120. The <lb/>most ambitious of the proposals has been submitted by the EC and suggests the creation of seven sub-<lb/>sectors based on the environmental media (air, water, soil, waste, noise and so forth). 9 The EC submission <lb/>includes a category for &quot; Services related to the collection, purification and distribution of water &quot; , which is <lb/>not classified in either W/120 or in the services part of the Provisional CPC, but which is technically often <lb/>closely associated with environmental services as seen in Part I. <lb/>135. <lb/>WTO Members have also been discussing ways to ensure that any commitments in network <lb/>infrastructure services are not undermined by lack of commitments in other sectors. One potential solution <lb/></body>

			<note place="footnote">9 The EC classification proposal closely resembles a similar classification previously developed by the OECD and <lb/>Eurostat (see OECD/Eurostat, 1999 for details). <lb/></note>

			<body>could be the establishment of a list or guide similar to the one proposed by some Members for energy <lb/>services. This list (in addition to the identification of &quot; core &quot; services) would comprise services which are <lb/>not telecommunication, postal/courier or environmental per se, but which are related or important to their <lb/>provision. These related services would be subject to a &quot; cluster &quot; or &quot; check-list &quot; , which could be used as an <lb/>aide-mémoire during the negotiations. The resulting candidates for commitments would then be scheduled <lb/>in the relevant GATS sectors. <lb/>V. <lb/>The GATS and policy control <lb/>136. <lb/>Perhaps more importantly, particularly in the case of environmental network and energy services, <lb/>concerns have been raised about the potential effect of the GATS on the ability of governments to ensure <lb/>adequate provision of these services to the public. In practice, this refers to the possible impact of the <lb/>Agreement on governments&apos; ability to maintain their traditional public service responsibilities either <lb/>through monopoly public utilities, exclusive rights to provide services or appropriately regulated <lb/>competition. These problems are intensified by the fact that the GATS is a relatively young agreement and <lb/>some of its provisions remain to be tested in practice. In light of the importance of these services for <lb/>society and their highly regulated nature, governments have been cautious about agreeing to subject these <lb/>sectors to binding commitments on competitive supply. The GATS, like other legally bound undertakings <lb/>in the WTO (or other international treaties), can affect the regulatory conduct of governments. At the same <lb/>time, the Agreement affords WTO Members considerable flexibility in this regard. <lb/>137. <lb/>The GATS applies to any service in any sector, with two main exclusions, the most important of <lb/>which in the context of network infrastructure services is the exclusion of services supplied in the exercise <lb/>of governmental authority. 10 It defines trade in services by reference to four modes of supply. The <lb/>traditional concept of trade in goods is imbedded in &quot; cross border supply &quot; (mode 1), which refers to the <lb/>supply of a service from the territory of one Member into the territory another Member. &quot; Consumption <lb/>abroad &quot; (mode 2) involves the supply of a service in the territory of one Member to a service consumer of <lb/>another Member. Network infrastructure services are for the most part supplied through the establishment <lb/>of a &quot; commercial presence &quot; (mode 3), possibly accompanied by the &quot; presence of a natural person(s) &quot; <lb/>(mode 4). <lb/>138. <lb/>The Agreement explicitly recognises in its Preamble &quot; the right of Members to regulate the supply <lb/>of services within their territory in order to meet national policy objectives &quot; . Market access (Article XVI) <lb/>and national treatment (Article XVII) need to be granted only in sectors which a Member lists in its <lb/>schedule of specific commitments. Members have also significant flexibility in scheduling as they are free <lb/>to choose and define the sectors, and select the modes of supply for which they are ready to undertake <lb/>specific commitments. Commitments can additionally be qualified with various types of relevant <lb/>limitations, thus allowing Members to tailor them to specific national policy objectives. <lb/>139. <lb/>In the absence of specific commitments, the GATS imposes only limited obligations. The most <lb/>important of these is the most-favoured-nation (MFN) treatment, a prohibition to discriminate among <lb/>foreign providers supplying the same service. Each member had the opportunity to seek exemption from <lb/>the MFN obligation at the date of entry into force of the Agreement (an opportunity also afforded to <lb/>subsequent acceding countries). Even for committed services, many regulatory practices and objectives not <lb/>relevant to listing within the schedule itself are currently subject to fairly minimal disciplines on domestic <lb/>regulation (see below). <lb/></body>

			<note place="footnote">10 The other exclusion relates to measures affecting air traffic rights or services directly related to the exercise of <lb/>traffic rights. <lb/></note>

			<note place="headnote">TD/TC/WP(2004)51/FINAL <lb/></note>

			<page>39 <lb/></page>

			<body>140. <lb/>Regulations may also breach obligations and commitments under the GATS and still be allowed <lb/>under the provisions of Article XIV on exceptions. These provisions can be invoked to protect major <lb/>public interests, including safety, human, plant or animal life or health, national security, public morals and <lb/>public order. They can also be invoked to deal with the effects of a default in services contracts. The <lb/>measures should not, however, be applied in a manner which would constitute a means of arbitrary or <lb/>unjustifiable discrimination between countries where like conditions prevail or a disguised restriction on <lb/>trade in services. <lb/>The carve-out for &quot; services in the exercise of governmental authority &quot; <lb/>141. <lb/>As noted, the GATS applies in principle to all services, except those provided in the exercise of <lb/>governmental authority. GATS Article I.3 (b) states that, for the purpose of the GATS, &quot; services &quot; include <lb/> &quot; any service in any sector except services supplied in the exercise of governmental authority &quot; . This <lb/>exception is further defined in Article I.3 (c), which specifies that &quot; a service supplied in the exercise of <lb/>governmental authority &quot; means &quot; any service, which is supplied neither on a commercial basis, nor in <lb/>competition with one or more service suppliers &quot; . As such, supply of services by a monopoly (whether <lb/>publicly or privately owned) is not alone sufficient to exempt such services from coverage, if they are sold <lb/>to the public on a commercial basis. <lb/>142. <lb/>In practice, since there is no single model of governmental provision of these services within <lb/>WTO membership, as the concept varies according to different sectors or segments, national traditions and <lb/>legal conditions, the coverage of the carve-out will vary depending on the country and service concerned. <lb/>However, uncertainties remain about its exact scope (see Krawjeski, 2003; Cossy, 2005; and Adlung, <lb/>2005). This definition does not provide for a clear determination of whether and under what circumstances <lb/>network infrastructure services provided on a monopoly basis by public utilities of particular Members <lb/>would fall outside the coverage of &quot;services&quot;. <lb/>143. <lb/>This uncertainty stems mainly form the lack of clear definitions or guidelines. For example, <lb/>regarding services supplied on a non-commercial basis, while services provided for free would be likely to <lb/>fulfil this condition, it is less clear whether the same could be said in the case of cost-recovery fees. Even <lb/>equating commercial with profit-seeking would still leave some questions unanswered as to what concepts <lb/>of profit would be relevant. Similar questions arise with respect to the precise meaning of &quot; nor in <lb/>competition with one or more service suppliers &quot; , coupled with the fact that some network infrastructure <lb/>services, e.g. environmental network services, remain for the most part natural monopolies, meaning there <lb/>may only be one supplier in a given market. <lb/>Network infrastructure services and government procurement <lb/>144. <lb/>Another important issue concerning the scope of the GATS relates to government procurement. <lb/>Government procurement of services — defined as the &quot; procurement by governmental agencies of services <lb/>purchased for governmental purposes and not with a view to commercial resale or with a view to use in the <lb/>supply of services for commercial resale &quot; — is exempted from the MFN, market access and national <lb/>treatment obligations (Article XIII:1). Since the conclusion of the Uruguay Round, WTO Members have <lb/>been negotiating the possibility to develop disciplines for procurement of services. For the time being, the <lb/>only comprehensive WTO disciplines in this area are contained in the plurilateral Agreement on <lb/>Government Procurement (GPA). <lb/>145. <lb/>A key question that arises in the context of government procurement of services is to what extent <lb/>contractual arrangements, such as concessions or build-operate-transfers (BOTs), fall under the Article XIII <lb/>definition of government procurement. It is unclear under what circumstances and what types of <lb/>arrangements would fall outside the scope of these three central GATS provisions. As seen in Part I, <lb/></body>

			<note place="headnote">TD/TC/WP(2004)51/FINAL <lb/></note>

			<page>40 <lb/></page>

			<body>concessionary arrangements play a major role in the supply of network infrastructure services. Recent <lb/>discussions show that WTO Members have different views in this regard and that even the definition of <lb/>different kinds of arrangements varies among countries. Some stress that the arrangements providing for a <lb/>contractee to sell commercial services to the public, rather than to sell such services to the government for <lb/>its own use, would not be covered by the definition of government procurement. However, this view is not <lb/>commonly agreed. <lb/>146. <lb/>Cossy (2005) has provided some initial insight into the complex question of contractual <lb/>arrangements and government procurement of services. In the case of concession contracts, she argues that <lb/>for the most part they could not be considered a form of government procurement. This is because they <lb/>typically do not entail a purchase of service by the government and the service is not for the direct <lb/>consumption of the government but is supplied to consumers. For other forms of contracts such as <lb/>management contracts, the case for government procurement appears to be stronger, since the government <lb/>more clearly purchases and consumes the service for its own use. The state of BOT contracts remains to be <lb/>clarified, given that they combine elements of procurement (construction of a public facility) with <lb/>concessional regimes (granting of an exclusive right to provide a service to the public). This situation is <lb/>compounded by the fact that in practice contractual arrangements between a public authority and a private <lb/>supplier may combine different elements. In a few cases, however, WTO Members have scheduled specific <lb/>commitments on concessional arrangements, presumably as limitation on the conditions under which <lb/>foreign suppliers may participate in the market for the services concerned. This would imply a view that <lb/>such arrangements fall within the scope of existing disciplines. <lb/>Implications of misinterpreting the scope of the GATS <lb/>147. <lb/>These uncertainties have tended to cloud discussions on the impact of the GATS on network <lb/>infrastructure services, possibly affecting WTO Members&apos; decisions to schedule commitments in these <lb/>services. However, as pointed out by Adlung (2005), a key question that results from uncertainties on the <lb/>interpretation of the scope of GATS provisions, is the extent to which GATS obligations and commitments <lb/>could lead to a loss of policy control over the provision of these services. As seen earlier, if commitments <lb/>have not been made in a particular sector, only limited disciplines apply, the most important of which is the <lb/>MFN principle (provided that countries have not included the sector in question in their lists of MFN <lb/>exemptions). MFN treatment does not seem to impinge on governments&apos; ability to retain regulatory <lb/>controls over network infrastructure services, given that governments retain the right to exclude any <lb/>foreign participation in the services concerned. <lb/>148. <lb/>Even if a country has made a commitment, Members retain a wide degree of flexibility and <lb/>latitude with respect to regulatory measures, although other more significant GATS obligations apply <lb/>especially in relation to market access and national treatment. While commitments involve different levels <lb/>of access depending on the limitations entered in the schedules, misinterpretation of GATS provisions may <lb/>in such case have important implications. As a last resort, if a country were to introduce new monopoly <lb/>rights in an area in which it had previously made commitments to competitive supply, it would be <lb/>necessary to follow the procedures on modification and withdrawal of commitments contained in GATS <lb/>Article XXI. This would entail the negotiation of commercial equivalent compensatory adjustments to the <lb/>schedule of commitments. If trading partners are not satisfied that such adjustments are made, they can <lb/>ultimately be authorised to take retaliatory measures of commercially equivalent effect. <lb/>149. <lb/>Uncertainties could also arise with respect to national treatment commitments. It is unclear, for <lb/>example, whether national treatment would apply to certain types of treatment or privileges extended to <lb/>public facilities (e.g. postal administrations), in a manner that could require equal treatment of foreign <lb/>services and service suppliers supplying similar services. Such questions can arise with respect to financial <lb/>benefits such as subsidies or &quot;bail outs&quot;, discriminatory pricing controls, or preferences extended to the <lb/></body>

			<note place="headnote">TD/TC/WP(2004)51/FINAL <lb/></note>

			<page>41 <lb/></page>

			<body>services or suppliers concerned. As seen in Part I, subsidies and other incentives are frequently used to <lb/>meet universal access objectives in network infrastructure services. It is possible that where such <lb/>commitments are made these incentives may need to be offered on a non-discriminatory basis to all <lb/>suppliers (domestic and foreign) willing to contribute to universal service objectives. <lb/>150. <lb/>Implications for commitments could also arise if in the future certain kinds of contractual <lb/>arrangements between the public and private sectors were interpreted as falling outside the scope of <lb/>government procurement. If relevant commitments are or were to be taken, a Member concerned would <lb/>need to grant foreigners the right to bid for contracts in the relevant sector and treat their offer like that of <lb/>other national suppliers. Although it is difficult to see how foreign providers would be less suited than their <lb/>domestic counterparts to meet the relevant sector objectives or to bid for contracts to provide service, <lb/>governments should be aware of unintended consequences. <lb/>151. <lb/>Scheduling commitments on network infrastructure services thus raises a number of important <lb/>questions. At the same time, not committing may come at a cost. As seen earlier, GATS commitments in <lb/>these services could bring about gains in terms of increased investment via private sector participation and <lb/>wider availability of services, and thus can make a positive contribution to the fulfilment of the universal <lb/>service objectives laid out by many governments. Moreover, in competitive telecommunication <lb/>environments, for example, the concept of &quot;universal&quot; service has been nearly entirely delinked from the <lb/>notions of governmental or exclusive supply, such that competitive private sector market participants can <lb/>be assigned to assume these requirements consistently with GATS obligations or commitments. <lb/>Limitations on network infrastructure services commitments <lb/>152. <lb/>Pending a clarification of GATS provisions by the WTO membership, one option to avoid some <lb/>of these concerns and facilitate the assumption of GATS commitments may involve careful delineation of <lb/>the activities listed as open to competition and considerable thought given to relevant limitations to be <lb/>inscribed in network infrastructure services. As shown in Table 1 below, WTO Members have wide <lb/>flexibility in this regard. It is possible to confine the scope of commitments to clearly defined and <lb/>circumscribed segments or activities of a sector, for example excluding public monopolies or confining <lb/>specific commitments to the private sector. <lb/>153. <lb/>A great degree of flexibility with respect to scheduling can accommodate governments that so <lb/>wish to gradually move from monopoly service provision to the introduction of competition and private <lb/>sector participation. This includes the use of staged or phased-in commitments to end monopoly or <lb/>exclusive rights provision of certain of these services at a future date. WTO Members made extensive use <lb/>of phased-in commitments in the telecommunications sector during the Uruguay Round. 47 of the 105 <lb/>Members that have made commitments on telecommunication services made use of such phase-ins, giving <lb/>them breathing room to institute the necessary legislative and regulatory frameworks for the introduction <lb/>of competition. <lb/>154. <lb/>At the same time, it is important to recognise that the GATS cannot solve the issue of universal <lb/>access to network infrastructure services. It can only play a role in complementing policy decisions by <lb/>enhancing investor&apos;s confidence when countries decide to introduce competition and allow private sector <lb/>participation in these services. Domestic factors including the state and feature of the different sectors, and <lb/>the country&apos;s economic, social and political characteristics remain central. There are plenty of examples of <lb/>countries that have made full GATS commitments during the Uruguay Round which have had no impact <lb/>on their network infrastructure services. <lb/></body>

			<body>VII. <lb/>Additional disciplines on regulatory measures <lb/>155. <lb/>Once commitments in a particular sector have been made, in addition to the market access and <lb/>national treatment obligations (subject to scheduled limitations), other disciplines apply. The most <lb/>significant of such disciplines relate to regulatory measures and are contained in Article VI, in particular <lb/>paragraphs 1 and 5. The question arises whether these disciplines can limit governments&apos; ability to regulate <lb/>network infrastructure services. <lb/>156. <lb/>Article VI:1 requires Members to ensure that regulatory measures are &quot; administered in a <lb/>reasonable, objective and impartial manner &quot; . Article VI:5 aims at ensuring that licensing, qualification <lb/>requirements and technical standards are inter alia &quot; based on objective and transparent criteria &quot; (examples <lb/>given are competence and the ability to supply the service) and &quot; not more burdensome than necessary to <lb/>ensure the quality of the service &quot; . These criteria are based on Article VI.4, which provides for a negotiating <lb/>mandate to develop strengthened disciplines on these measures. The application of Article VI:5 is subject <lb/>to two limitations, that the measures in question nullify or impair specific commitments and could not <lb/>reasonably have been expected when commitments were made. <lb/>157. <lb/>As noted by Adlung (2005), it is difficult to see how the provisions of Article VI:1 may impinge <lb/>on governments&apos; right to regulate given that they only relate to the &quot; administration &quot; of the measures and <lb/>not their substantive aspects. Article VI:5 may have a wider impact on regulatory capacity since as seen <lb/>above does contain substantive obligations. In this context, concerns have been raised about the fact that <lb/>the not more burdensome than necessary test of Article VI:4 is linked only to the quality of service (see <lb/>also Trachtman, 2003). A narrow interpretation of the objective &quot; quality of service &quot; may leave out <lb/>measures relating to other important objectives seen in Part I. In practice, however, the effects of Article <lb/>VI:5 are likely to be limited given that its application is subject to the two limitations seen earlier. In <lb/>addition, current discussions under the Article VI:4 mandate show that any disciplines in this area will be <lb/>broad enough to accommodate a wide range of national objectives. In the Accountancy Disciplines 11 , the <lb/>one area where negotiations have been concluded under the mandate, the narrower quality objective has <lb/>been replaced with a broader set of objectives, including protection of consumers, the quality of service, <lb/>professional competence and the integrity of the profession. <lb/>158. <lb/>It is also important to recall that even if a Member breaches its obligations under Article VI.5 (or <lb/>other GATS provisions such as the ones to be developed under the Article VI:4 mandate), its regulation <lb/>might still be permitted under the provisions of Article XIV on exceptions. <lb/>The Reference Paper on Basic Telecommunications <lb/>159. <lb/>Another important example of GATS disciplines and the scope for autonomous policy making in <lb/>network infrastructure services is the Reference Paper. The document is a tool for negotiating additional <lb/>commitments on basic telecommunication services under GATS Article XVIII (i.e. beyond those on <lb/>market access and national treatment). Unlike the Annex on Telecommunications, the Reference Paper <lb/>obtains legal status only to the extent that WTO Members have incorporated it in their schedules of <lb/>commitments. <lb/>160. <lb/>The Reference Paper supplements other GATS disciplines, particularly the Annex on <lb/>Telecommunications and Article VIII of the GATS. Its objective is to ensure effective market access by <lb/></body>

			<note place="footnote">11 The Accountancy Disciplines were adopted in December 1998 and are due to be integrated into the GATS at the <lb/>conclusion of the current negotiations. They are applicable only if a Member has made a commitment in the <lb/>accountancy sector and their scope is confined to measures not falling under Articles XVI and XVII. <lb/></note>

			<body>means of additional commitments to put in place a set of pro-competitive regulatory principles akin to <lb/>international best practice. As seen in Part I, ensuring the development of a genuinely competitive market <lb/>can be important because the particular characteristics of telecommunication services (and of other <lb/>network infrastructure services), make it unrealistic to change from monopoly to open, unregulated <lb/>markets, and expect the full benefits to be realised and sustained. Rather, a regulatory environment that <lb/>complements and supports the decision to permit competition is needed. <lb/>161. <lb/>The Reference Paper, like the Annex on Telecommunications, represents a transfer of know-how <lb/>from countries with significant years of experience with reform of their telecommunication service sector <lb/>to other countries and has been used to promote policy reforms and FDI. It has also inspired considerable <lb/>debate on whether its elements can be transferred to other network services, such as postal/courier and <lb/>energy services. The argument is that, given the changing market structure and gradual opening of these <lb/>sectors to competition, regulatory authorities are likely to face issues that are similar to those encountered <lb/>in the liberalisation of the telecommunications sector. Attention, though, should be paid to the differences <lb/>between telecommunications and the other sectors, including with respect to the stronger difficulties <lb/>encountered in conducting liberalisation in the other sectors (as seen in Part I). <lb/>162. <lb/>Specific competition-related disciplines in the Reference Paper include a requirement to prevent <lb/>major suppliers from engaging in anti-competitive cross-subsidisation and an obligation to establish an <lb/>independent regulator. At the same time, the Reference Paper, in line with the Preamble of the GATS, <lb/>recognises governments&apos; right to regulate the sector to ensure public policy objectives. A case in point is <lb/>universal service requirements; the Reference Paper explicitly confirms the right of Members to establish <lb/>these measures. Similarly, it allows considerable scope for each country on how to implement <lb/>liberalisation and regulatory reform. For example, the requirement for an independent regulator is without <lb/>prejudice as to whether the regulator should be separate from the ministry that makes telecommunication <lb/>policy or whether it should be a sector-specific regulator of telecommunication services or a regulator <lb/>operating under the general competition laws. <lb/></body>

			<body>CONCLUSION <lb/>163. <lb/>The economic and social significance of network infrastructure services means that they are high <lb/>on the list of development priorities of many countries. Part II of the report suggests that, if appropriately <lb/>designed, bound liberalisation under the GATS can contribute to the advancement of these development <lb/>goals. By creating a more transparent and predictable legal framework, the GATS can contribute to <lb/>improve the investment climate and help attract FDI in these sectors. This can in turn provide needed <lb/>capital and technical and managerial expertise to build and expand the networks and services. <lb/>164. <lb/>The WTO services agreement can place regulatory constraints on Member governments, <lb/>particularly when specific commitments are made. This is intensified by the fact that the GATS is a <lb/>relatively young agreement and some of its provisions remain to be tested in practice. At the same time, the <lb/>Agreement allows considerable scope through its flexibility to accommodate national policies. It is <lb/>therefore crucial to carefully examine its provisions and tailor specific commitments to national policy <lb/>objectives. <lb/>165. <lb/>The liberalisation of network infrastructure services is no easy task and requires the <lb/>establishment of a strong regulatory framework. To achieve public policy objectives and ensure <lb/>competition in the new environment, new regulatory instruments and approaches are required, which need <lb/>to be adapted to the specificities of different sectors and countries. This is shown in the range of positive as <lb/>well as problem-ridden examples provided in Part I of the study of national experience in liberalising <lb/>network infrastructure services. Sound regulation and effective institutions are thus needed to ensure a <lb/>positive and sustainable outcome from the current round of GATS negotiations. <lb/></body>
