            <figDesc>Quantification of trade effects when the United Kingdom formally exits the European Union<lb/> The impact of trade shocks was analysed with the OECD&apos;s METRO model (OECD 2015), assuming two<lb/> distinct stages:<lb/> • When the UK loses preferential access to the EU market, it faces the EU&apos;s Most Favoured Nation<lb/> (MFN) tariffs. The UK, in turn, imposes MFN rates on its imports (assumed to be equal to the EU&apos;s current<lb/> bound MFN rates). Similarly, the UK faces MFN treatment in all other export markets and in turn imposes<lb/> import tariffs. MFN tariffs are approximated using bound rates of the World Trade Organization. This<lb/> underestimates the true amount of border barriers where there are existing import quotas and complex<lb/> mixed tariffs. Trade costs in financial services between the UK and the EU are allowed to increase by 20%,<lb/> which is a conservative assumption as some studies suggest that exports of financial services to the EU<lb/> could fall by half following the loss of passporting rights for banks (Capital Economics, 2016).</figDesc>

Calibration of the near-term effects of Brexit<lb/> Financial market shocks are assumed to be of a magnitude similar to those observed during the acute<lb/> phase of the euro area crisis in 2011-12, but much smaller than during the financial crisis in 2008-09. An<lb/> equation linking corporate bond spreads, the Economic Policy Uncertainty Index (EPUI) and stock market volatility is<lb/> estimated for the UK since 2010. From April 2016, the bond spread is generated by adding a two standard deviation<lb/> shock to the EPUI and a two standard deviation shock to stock market volatility, relative to a baseline where stock<lb/> market volatility and policy uncertainty are set to their average values in 2014-15. As a result, the corporate bond<lb/> spread is 100 basis points above the baseline in the latter half of 2016 and 150 basis points above the baseline in<lb/> 2017. Broadly reflecting the calibrated shock above, the investment and equity risk premia are raised by 50 basis<lb/> points in the first half of 2016, 150 basis points over 2016H2-2017 and 100 basis points in 2018. Also, the wedge<lb/> between bank borrowing and lending rates for the household and corporate sectors is raised by 100 basis points over<lb/> 2016H2-2017. Finally, the term premium on government long-term bonds is raised, initially by 20 basis points in the<lb/> first half of 2016 and then by 50 basis points over in the rest of the simulation period. After 2018, these financial shocks<lb/> are allowed to fade gradually, although not completely, since formal exit from the EU would itself be an additional<lb/> source of uncertainty and additional risk. UK investment and equity risk premia are assumed to still be 70 basis points<lb/> higher than otherwise by 2023, although the shock to credit conditions is allowed to fade earlier by 2021.</figDesc>

To take this effect into account, a shock is applied raising the ex-ante saving rate by a little<lb/> over 1 percentage point in the latter half of 2016.<lb/> The aftermath of a vote to leave would also be likely to raise sterling risk premia, leading to an additional<lb/> sharp exchange rate depreciation.

            <figDesc>The UK decision to exit could add to centrifugal forces in other parts of Europe and reinforce uncertainty<lb/> about the future of the Union and the Single Market. The resulting uncertainty could lead to more difficult financial<lb/> conditions in other European countries. To illustrate the possible magnitude of such factors, investment and equity risk<lb/> premia and the spread between household borrowing and deposit rates were widened in all European Economic Area<lb/> (EEA) countries. The shocks applied were between one-quarter and one-third of those in the UK, with risk premia<lb/> rising by 50 basis points at their peak and the interest rate spread by 25 basis points. No shocks were applied directly<lb/> to either term premia or to the household saving rate. The risk premia shock was held at 25 basis points over 2019-23.</figDesc>

            <figDesc>Fortrade, a two-stage approach was adopted. The trade effects of the UK leaving the EU were obtained by<lb/> the OECD&apos;s METRO model (Box 2) and were fed into the National Institute Global Econometric Model (NiGEM) macro<lb/> model for the world economy.<lb/> The reduction in UK trade openness would also start to have costs for the overall economic dynamism of<lb/> the UK economy, reducing competition and the inflow of new ideas and products. OECD estimates by Egert and<lb/> Gal (2016) imply that a four percentage points decline in trade openness reduces total factor productivity by 0.8% after<lb/> five years (and by 1.2% after 10 years). In the NiGEM near-term scenario the impact on productivity of the sharp fall in<lb/> trade (Box 2) was modelled as a decline in labour-augmenting technical progress building up to 1.6% by 2023.<lb/> Withdrawal from the EU could also provide scope for the imposition of tighter controls on inward<lb/> migration. This would reinforce the endogenous effects on economic migration coming from a weaker UK economy<lb/> and labour market. Net inward migration is assumed to decline by 84 000 per year over 2019-2023, with around 75%<lb/> of this reflected in the labour force.<lb/> All other model assumptions were the same as without a Brexit. The NiGEM model was run in backward-</figDesc>

            <figDesc>would generate a large negative shock to the UK economy, which would spillover to<lb/> other European countries. Assuming fixed interest rates at the zero lower bound, UK GDP growth would<lb/> be reduced by 0.5 percentage point in both 2017 and 2018. The onset of the trade shock in 2019 adds to<lb/> these costs considerably, with GDP growth reduced by 1.5 percentage points that year. These shocks<lb/> would be larger still without the depreciation of sterling included in the scenario, although the impact of<lb/> such a change may be weaker now than in the past. By 2020, real GDP would be more than 3% below the<lb/> level it would otherwise have been in the absence of Brexit (Figure 11), equivalent to a cost of GBP 2200<lb/> per household. By 2023, even as the risk premia shocks fade, and the economy begins to adjust to the<lb/> large trade shock, helped by a long-lasting depreciation of the real effective exchange rate, real GDP<lb/> would still remain around 2.5% lower than otherwise.

However, the UK terms of trade deteriorate<lb/> sharply, with export prices declining, as exporters try to improve global market share, and import prices<lb/> pushed up sharply by the depreciation of sterling. Lower exports and investment and the real exchange<lb/> rate decline hit import volumes substantially, with a decline of over 9% by 2020. At its peak in 2020, the UK<lb/> unemployment rate would be around 1.5 percentage point above baseline. Business investment would be<lb/> especially hard hit, declining by over 10% by 2020. Equity prices would also be strongly affected, initially<lb/> declining by around 15%.<lb/> The negative shocks would raise the UK budget deficit substantially.

            <figDesc>With shocks of between one-quarter and one-third of those in the UK, the GDP of the reduced<lb/> EU would be little affected in 2016, but would fall by close to 1% by 2020 (Figure 11, Panel B). Even<lb/> as the impact of higher risk premia in these economies starts to fade, the sharp decline in UK import<lb/> demand remains a sizeable drag for some economies. A larger sterling depreciation against domestic<lb/> currencies would magnify the negative impact on other European economies, as would any deeper<lb/> confidence shocks in those economies. On the other hand, a euro depreciation could help to offset some<lb/> of the negative impact, but at the expense of magnifying the negative effects on output in the UK.<lb/> Centrifugal forces within countries and within the reduced EU are not quantified fully, but<lb/> would be a major downside risk. Following the UK decision to exit, there could be doubts about the<lb/> future of the Single Market, and more broadly, of the EU. The UK itself would also face the possibility of a<lb/> break up, with political leaders in Scotland having indicated that they would seek a new referendum on<lb/> Scottish independence. Such developments would tighten financial conditions further. An actual break up,<lb/> either of the EU or the UK, would lead to considerably greater financial turbulence and a much larger<lb/> decline in investment and output.</figDesc>
