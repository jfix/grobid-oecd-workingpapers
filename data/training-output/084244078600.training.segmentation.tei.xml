			<front>Abstract/ Résumé <lb/>How regulatory reforms in Sweden have boosted productivity <lb/>The economic crisis in the early 1990s prompted action on reforming the Swedish welfare state and <lb/>its institutions, including deregulation of a wide range of product markets. In that way, Sweden took early <lb/>action compared to other OECD countries currently struggling with how to make public finances more <lb/>robust in an ageing context. The reforms that were implemented during the 1990s are now paying off in <lb/>terms of productivity and GDP growth. Empirical evidence suggests that deregulation has delivered a <lb/>considerable &quot; productivity dividend &quot; . Although significant progress therefore has been made, renewed <lb/>regulatory reform is needed to safeguard Sweden&apos;s ambitious public policy goals. Efforts should focus on <lb/>improving enterprise formation and labour utilisation, as well as on providing better value for money in the <lb/>public sector by raising its efficiency and delivering high quality services. <lb/>This paper relates to the OECD Reviews of Regulatory Reform Sweden and the OECD Economic <lb/>Survey of Sweden 2007 (www.oecd.org/eco/surveys/sweden). <lb/>JEL classification: D40, E20, E60, F40, H11, H40, H50, H60, J20, L11, L50, L51, L53, O47 <lb/>Key words: Regulatory reform, product market regulation, network industries, productivity dividend <lb/>***** <lb/>Comment les réformes réglementaires en Suède ont stimulé la productivité <lb/>La crise économique du début des années 90 a servi de catalyseur pour la réforme de l&apos;État <lb/>providence suédois, qui s&apos;est aussi accompagnée par une vaste libéralisation de des marchés des produits. <lb/>Ce faisant, la Suède a agi de manière précoce comparée à d&apos;autres pays de l&apos;OCDE qui peinent à trouver <lb/>une solution pour assainir les finances publiques dans le contexte du vieillissement de la population. Les <lb/>réformes mises en oeuvre au cours des années 90 se sont révélées payantes en termes de productivité et de <lb/>croissance du PIB.

			<body>HOW REGULATORY REFORMS IN SWEDEN HAVE BOOSTED PRODUCTIVITY <lb/>By <lb/>Espen Erlandsen and Jens Lundsgaard 1 <lb/>1. <lb/>This working paper was originally prepared for the OECD Reviews of Regulatory Reform Sweden <lb/>(OECD, 2007a). Because of this purpose, the paper combines material from OECD work on a wide set of <lb/>topics, while adding new analysis mainly in the area of productivity developments. The paper also includes <lb/>material prepared for the OECD Economic Survey of Sweden 2007 (OECD, 2007b). <lb/>A successful policy has helped to turn around the economy <lb/>2. <lb/>For several decades, Sweden has ranked highly in most indicators of living standards, e.g. the UN <lb/>Human Development Index (sixth place). In terms of public health, educational attainment, employment <lb/>and poverty alleviation Sweden is in the top handful of OECD countries (OECD, 2005a). The backbone of <lb/>the economy has traditionally been the exploitation of natural resources (forestry and mining) and the <lb/>production of manufactured products (steel, paper and pulp, machinery, motor vehicles, chemicals, <lb/>pharmaceuticals and telecommunication equipment) – supported by a relatively smaller service sector. 2 A <lb/>characteristic feature is that a small group of large companies have dominated on the production side, <lb/>while holdings of financial assets have been concentrated to a few large institutions (banks, insurance <lb/>companies and investment corporations), reflecting a strong belief in economies of scale (Lindbeck, 1997). <lb/>3. <lb/>Developments during the last two decades have been marked by wide-ranging changes in the <lb/>Swedish economy. A combination of external shocks and policy mistakes culminated in a banking crisis, <lb/>balance of payments deficits and a deep economic crisis in the early 1990s. At the same time, a large <lb/>public sector imposed heavy budget deficits which contributed to a rapidly rising national debt. The main <lb/>political priority in this period was therefore to redress the balance of public finances. This was achieved <lb/>through a combination of tax increases and spending cuts, which helped to make the welfare state more <lb/>sustainable. 3 In that way, Sweden took early action compared to other OECD countries currently struggling <lb/>with how to make public finances more robust in an ageing context. <lb/>1. <lb/>The authors are grateful to colleagues at the OECD, especially Andrew Dean, Felix Hüfner, Stéphane <lb/>Jacobzone and Andreas Wörgötter, besides consultant Caroline Varley, for their helpful comments. Special <lb/>thanks go to Paul Conway for his assistance with simulations, to Susan Gascard and Sylvie Ricordeau for <lb/>their secretarial assistance and to Béatrice Guerard for her technical assistance. The authors can be <lb/>contacted at Espen.Erlandsen@fin.dep.no and jens.lundsgaard@oecd.org. <lb/>2. <lb/>In international comparison, the Swedish service sector is close to OECD average in magnitude (see <lb/>Kongsrud and Wanner, 2005). <lb/>3. <lb/>According to the Swedish Ministry of Finance, these policy measures were possible to undertake as there <lb/>was a &quot; crisis mood &quot; among the Swedish population. In addition, the government (in office at that time) <lb/>promised to return to more generous social benefit schemes and to lower the taxes when public finances <lb/>would improve. <lb/></body>

			<body>4. <lb/>The economic crisis accelerated the pace of reforming the Swedish welfare system and its <lb/>institutions (Freeman et al., 2006). Among major reforms undertaken was a change of the macroeconomic <lb/>policy framework. This included the introduction of an inflation targeting regime and a floating exchange <lb/>rate system, and a top-down budget process with multi-year expenditure ceilings and medium-term targets <lb/>for the budget balance. In addition, the tax system was reformed, and measures were put forward to <lb/>decentralise more of the wage bargaining process. Regulatory reform was also used as part of the measures <lb/>to &quot; turn around &quot; the economy, including deregulation of key network sectors such as electricity and <lb/>telecommunication, and strengthening of competition policy. Accession to the EU in 1995 provided a <lb/>further boost for reform of the Swedish economy, 4 with the exception of the agricultural sector where <lb/>liberalisation efforts in the past in fact were replaced by less competition-friendly regulations. <lb/>5. <lb/>The macroeconomic and structural reforms undertaken have contributed to shape the structure of <lb/>the Swedish economy. One prominent feature in this respect is the rising importance of knowledge-<lb/>intensive products, such as electronic communication products (Ericsson is one of the world&apos;s leading ICT <lb/>companies) – sharing features with the Finnish economy. Although the ICT sector has made a significant <lb/>contribution to economic growth since the slump in the early 1990s, traditional manufacturing industries <lb/>(e.g. motor vehicles, machinery and chemicals) are still playing an important role. In fact, over the last <lb/>15 years as a whole the size of the Swedish manufacturing sector has been remarkable stable (measured as <lb/>value added as a share of the total economy), in sharp contrast to other countries which have had to meet <lb/>the challenge of a decline in this sector. 5 Thus, typical transitional challenges stemming from deterioration <lb/>of the manufacturing sector have inter alia been less pronounced in Sweden than in many other countries. <lb/>Reflecting that Sweden is a small open economy equipped with large export industries, foreign trade have <lb/>accounted for on average close to 46% (measured as exports as a share of GDP) over the last five years, <lb/>compared to a little above 44% in the OECD. <lb/>6. <lb/>Per capita incomes in Sweden are relatively high in international comparison (Figure 1). <lb/>However, Sweden&apos;s ranking on this standard of living indicator has changed considerably over the past; <lb/>They slipped from being at the third highest level in the OECD in 1970 to fourteenth place by the early <lb/>1990s, a long-term decline that is considered to reflect poor structural and macroeconomic policies, <lb/>insufficient competition in the business sector, rigid labour markets and an overshooting in the size of <lb/>government (OECD, 2005a). Since then, the macroeconomic policy framework has been improved and <lb/>several product markets have been deregulated, including market elements being introduced in the public <lb/>sector. Along with relatively strong R&amp;D expenditure and more effective competition, structural changes <lb/>have contributed to provide strong economic growth since the mid-1990s. Thereby, Sweden has been <lb/>brought a bit closer to the group of countries with the highest per capita incomes, making it possible to <lb/>sustain a high standard of living. <lb/>7. <lb/>Sweden has, however, not fully regained its position relative to the leading OECD countries. At <lb/>the trough of the crisis in 1993, GDP per capita was 24% below that of the United States and, despite <lb/>Sweden&apos;s recovery, this gap has still been at around 22% since 2000. The remaining gap in per capita <lb/>incomes vis-à-vis OECD peers reflects shortfalls in labour resource utilisation (measured as total hours <lb/>worked per capita) and productivity per hour each accounting for about half of the gap. Sweden has <lb/>progressed less than its neighbouring countries despite the similar welfare orientation in public policies. <lb/>Denmark maintains a slightly higher GDP per capita, and Sweden&apos;s clear lead vis-à-vis Finland in earlier <lb/>decades is almost gone. <lb/>4. <lb/>Although Sweden became a member of EU in 1995, this was preceded by a long period of integration with <lb/>EU countries, and includes the 1972 Free Trade Agreement between Sweden and the European Community <lb/>and the 1992 treaty that established the European Economic Area. <lb/>5. <lb/>In 2001, value added in the manufacturing industry in Sweden, measured as a share of total value added, <lb/>amounted to 20.7% (compared to 18.7% in OECD on average). <lb/></body>

			<body>8. <lb/>Like in other Nordic countries, the notion of having a welfare state plays an important role <lb/>shaping the political economy of reform. Universal public services and a clear taste for equity are key <lb/>components (Figure 2). Other key features of the Nordic model are comparatively high levels of trust and <lb/>political consensus backed by strong democratic control, notably through high participation in elections, <lb/>and a high level of transparency. 6 The challenge is to build on these strong institutions to continuously <lb/>improve economic and social outcomes via regulatory reform. <lb/>Figure 2. Swedish income distribution in international comparison <lb/>1. A higher GINI coefficient implies greater income inequality. It can range from 0 (everyone having the same income) <lb/>to 100 (one person having all the income). <lb/>Source: OECD calculations; Swedish Ministry of Finance; Förster, Michael and Marco Mira d&apos;Ercole (2005), &quot; Income distribution and <lb/>poverty in OECD countries in the second half of the 1990s &quot; , OECD, Social, Employment and Migration Working Papers No. 22. <lb/>9. <lb/>Although a successful policy has helped to turn around the Swedish economy, there is no room to <lb/>rest on the laurels as major challenges will emerge in the years ahead, including the need to tackle the <lb/>looming demographic burden. The first generation of regulatory reforms during the 1990s have produced <lb/>significant gains in terms of productivity, but there is still scope for improvements in regulatory design. <lb/>Also, some sectors are still subject to various barriers that impede competition and hence innovation. To <lb/>sustain future growth and safeguard Sweden&apos;s welfare systems, the following key challenges needs <lb/>therefore to be addressed: <lb/>• Improving labour resource utilisation. Although employment rates are fairly high, in particular <lb/>for women, annual working hours for those in employment are relatively low. High absence rates<lb/>6. <lb/>Sweden ranks as the sixth most transparent country in Transparency International&apos;s Corruption Perceptions <lb/>Index for 2005 (see www.transperency.org). <lb/></body>

			<body>due to various factors (holidays, sickness and parental leave) are considered to be the main reason <lb/>for the shortfall in hours at work in Sweden. <lb/>• Reducing economy-wide regulations in areas where performance so far has been weak. Together <lb/>with exposing the public sector to greater competition, this could be one way of coping with the <lb/>relatively low rate of business formation and enterprise growth in Sweden.<lb/>• Providing better value for money in the public sector. There is a need to raise public sector <lb/>efficiency, in addition to deliver high quality services. Exposing the public sector to greater <lb/>competition (and associated scrutiny) and improving the interface between private and public <lb/>provision of publicly funded services, could be one way to obtain this.<lb/>10. <lb/>This paper is structured as follows. Section 2 presents the macroeconomic context of within <lb/>regulatory reforms in Sweden have taken place. Section 3 discusses emerging regulatory challenges and <lb/>reviews the policy responses to date. Section 4 proposes policy options for strengthening the foundations <lb/>for future growth. <lb/>The macroeconomic context <lb/>Factors driving economic performance over the past decade <lb/>International trade has a rising influence on the Swedish economy <lb/>11. <lb/>International trade and investment has a rising influence on the Swedish economy, supported by a <lb/>pronounced free-trade regime. Indicators on the restrictiveness of trade barriers show that Sweden in 1998 <lb/>had a higher degree of openness than in many other OECD countries, and that efforts to reduce these <lb/>further have been continued (Conway et. al, 2005). <lb/>12. <lb/>For several decades, Sweden&apos;s exports as a share of GDP were slightly lower than in OECD on <lb/>average. 7 This subsequently changed in the first half of the 1990s, notably due to a significant <lb/>improvement in Swedish competitiveness and a favourable composition of world demand (Figure 3, <lb/>panel A). 8 In 2004, Swedish exports amounted to 48.6% of GDP, compared to 45.5% in OECD. The export <lb/>upswing has, however, not been followed by an equivalent shift in the level of Swedish imports, despite a <lb/>pick-up in import penetration (measured as import volumes as a share of total final expenditure). Although <lb/>historically export and imports shares have been closely linked, developments since the mid-1990s appear <lb/>to have altered this pattern. This development is suggestive of structural changes such as the regulatory <lb/>reforms undertaken in the 1990s. In addition, export oriented industries may have benefited in particular <lb/>7. <lb/>Exports as a share of GDP were higher in Sweden than in the OECD if Luxembourg is excluded. <lb/>8. <lb/>From 1992 to 1993 the Swedish krona depreciated effectively by 20%. Combined with large productivity <lb/>gains in the manufacturing sector, this reduced Sweden&apos;s relative unit labour costs in manufacturing by <lb/>almost 30%. Swedish exporters used part of the resultant boost to competitiveness to lower their foreign-<lb/>currency prices, except for in resource-intensive industries (OECD, 1995). Swedish export shares also <lb/>benefited from a favourable composition of world demand, based on a relatively high content of <lb/>infrequently purchased goods, such as passenger cars and household appliances, which had a high weight <lb/>in Swedish exports. Recovering economies such as the United Kingdom, Norway, the United States and <lb/>East Asian countries markedly increased their imports of such goods from Sweden, Furthermore, this <lb/>composition of exports allowed Sweden to benefit disproportionately from emerging markets. <lb/></body>

			<body>from technological development, while globalisation (leading to increased specialisation) may have <lb/>spurred export performance in specific industries. 9 <lb/>13. <lb/>Traditionally, Sweden&apos;s main trading partners have been Denmark, Finland, Germany, Norway, <lb/>the United Kingdom and the United States, which together account for around 50% of total goods export. <lb/>International trade with emerging economies such as China plays a growing role. Since 1998, Swedish <lb/>imports and exports with China increased from 0.9% and 1.7% (measured as a proportion of total imports <lb/>and exports), to 3.0% and 2.2%, respectively. <lb/>14. <lb/>Having a large ICT production is a two-edged sword for an economy, as the ICT industry has <lb/>been characterised not only by rapid technological progress, but also significant price declines. The <lb/>benefits of ICT are thus likely to accrue more to the users than to the producers of ICT (Bayoumi and <lb/>Haacker, 2002). Indeed, this distinction has been evident in the Nordic countries. The differences in the <lb/>composition of exports and imports show up in considerable trend divergences in the terms of trade, in <lb/>particular since the late 1990s (Figure 3, panel B). Between 1991 and 2005, Sweden&apos;s terms of trade <lb/>worsened by 13%. In contrast, Denmark saw an improvement of almost 9%. Prior, the development was <lb/>broadly similar in these countries (OECD, 2006b), pointing to structural changes in the trade composition <lb/>over time. However, other countries with large ICT industries have seen an even larger deterioration in <lb/>their terms of trade (15% for Finland and 36% for Korea). <lb/>Generally high employment rates but low labour market flexibility <lb/>15. <lb/>The Swedish labour market is characterised by a combination of generally high employment rates <lb/>(74.7% compared to 67.4% in OECD, 2004-figures) and low average hours of work. The effect is that total <lb/>labour supply is only around average (Figure 4). Part of the explanation as to why working hours are low is <lb/>that the &quot; standard &quot; working week is around one hour shorter than the European average. Most of the <lb/>shortfall, however, is caused by high absence rates, with holidays, sickness and parental leave as the most <lb/>common reasons. Furthermore, high effective marginal tax rates generate incentives to reduce working <lb/>hours. Taking absences into account, the &quot; average &quot; Swede is away from work almost 17 weeks each year, <lb/>compared to the European average of 11 weeks (OECD, 2005a). <lb/>16. <lb/>In international comparison, Sweden has relatively strict employment protection rules (Figure 5). <lb/>The most significant rule is the last-in-first-out rule that gives a great deal of job security to people who <lb/>stay with the same employer. However, this rule may be deviated from collective agreement, making it <lb/>possible to take into account the employer&apos;s need to keep certain persons in the workforce. Furthermore, an <lb/>employee with longer employment time only has priority over other employees if he or she has satisfactory <lb/>qualifications for the continued work. Certain exemptions from the rule apply for companies with ten or <lb/>fewer employees. Thus, Swedes tend to stay in the same job much longer than in other OECD countries <lb/>(OECD, 2004). While this may help them gain firm-specific skills, and possibly increases the willingness <lb/>of employers to contribute to continuing education of their employees, this reduced job mobility makes it <lb/>harder to reallocate the scarce labour supply to those areas where it is most needed. <lb/>9. <lb/>Sweden is, for example, a relatively large exporter of motor vehicles --an industry which has been <lb/>increasingly specialised in recent years. <lb/></body>

			<body>A highly credible monetary policy <lb/>17. <lb/>Sweden&apos;s present monetary policy framework of inflation targeting emerged from the currency <lb/>crisis in late 1992, due to the collapse of the peg to the D-mark and the following decision to let the <lb/>Swedish krona float. The monetary policy target is (according to the Riksbank&apos;s Act) to maintain price <lb/>stability, and since January 1993 the central bank has defined this as keeping consumer price inflation at <lb/>2% over the medium term with a tolerance band of ±1%. <lb/>18. <lb/>This monetary policy framework has served Sweden well. Sound inflation performance has <lb/>strengthened the central bank&apos;s credibility, and long-run inflation expectations appear to remain firmly <lb/>anchored around the central bank&apos;s desired level (OECD, 2007b). The inflation targeting regime has in <lb/>recent years delivered low and stable inflation and so helped to promote economic growth. This good <lb/>performance is one of the factors that are likely to explain why the spread in long term interest rates has <lb/>been significantly reduced during the last decade. <lb/>A financial sector that helps to underpin the economy <lb/>19. <lb/>Financial and insurance-related services play an important economic role through their impact on <lb/>the technical infrastructure (payment systems, trading platforms, clearing and settlement of securities, <lb/>pooling of risk) and through their direct and indirect effects on value added and employment. In Sweden, <lb/>the financial sector&apos;s share in total value added is slightly less than 4% (compared to a little over 6% in the <lb/>OECD), and its share of employment is slightly higher than 2% (compared to a little over 3% in the <lb/>OECD). The latter share has remained more or less constant over the last decade, while the former shows a <lb/>significant drop since the late 1980s, when the share was around 5% (closer to the OECD average). <lb/>20. <lb/>The development of Swedish financial market over the past two decades has been characterised <lb/>by deregulation of credit and currency markets, increased internationalisation and technological <lb/>development. As a result, product variety is increased, but it has also added greater complexity. In recent <lb/>years, a large number of new banking companies have been established in Sweden (including affiliates of <lb/>foreign corporations). But holdings of financial assets are still concentrated into a few large domestic <lb/>institutions (banks, insurance companies and investment corporations). According to the Competition <lb/>Authority, there is currently an oligopoly-like market structure in the banking industry where the four <lb/>major players&apos; control 73% of total assets managed (Konkurrensverket, 2005). In international comparison <lb/>net interest margins in the Swedish banking sector are close to the OECD average while overhead costs are <lb/>slightly lower (OECD, 2006a). <lb/>High R&amp;D expenditure promotes innovation <lb/>21. <lb/>Innovation is a key element determining long-term economic growth. In this respect, Sweden <lb/>rates highly on a number of contributing factors. R&amp;D expenditure expressed as a share of GDP is higher <lb/>than any other OECD country (Figure 6). A relatively high proportion of R&amp;D is performed by the private <lb/>sector and just four large Swedish companies accounted for some 70% of all private sector R&amp;D in the <lb/>first half of the 1990s. Sweden also has a high share of researchers in the workforce, and one of the highest <lb/>proportions of patent applications per head of population in the OECD (OECD, 2004). But it appears to do <lb/>relatively less well in the practical translation of this effort into the market. When it comes to the number <lb/>of successful innovations in manufacturing and services, Sweden is only middle ranking compared to other <lb/>OECD countries (OECD, 2006a). <lb/>22. <lb/>Sweden&apos;s public policies towards R&amp;D are more neutral than those of several other OECD <lb/>countries, most notably because it does not offer tax subsidies (OECD, 2006a). However, direct <lb/>government funding of business R&amp;D is relatively high. In the three years to 2003, it amounted to 0.18% <lb/></body>

			<body>of GDP in Sweden, compared to 0.06% in OECD on average (OECD, 2006a). The main part of this is for <lb/>defence purposes where the government contracts with the industry include R&amp;D.

Entrepreneurship <lb/>involves seeking out and identifying potentially profitable economic opportunities and taking the risk of <lb/>trying them out. New firms can act as an important &quot; bridge &quot; for the successful application of innovative <lb/>developments into the marketplace, which matters in the Swedish context because this is an area where <lb/>there is still scope for improvement. As well, shifts towards outsourcing, the development of new services, <lb/>and demand for more differentiated products all point to a greater role for small and new firms as engines <lb/>of entrepreneurial change (Henrekson, 2005). New and expanding firms have, not least, the potential to <lb/>generate jobs. <lb/>24. <lb/>Despite a high overall tax pressure, Sweden is among the OECD countries taxing corporate <lb/>income relatively mildly and the marginal effective tax on capital is generally considered to be fairly low <lb/>in Sweden (OECD, 2006e). Furthermore, Sweden often ranks high in international comparisons of where it <lb/>is attractive for firms to locate (OECD, 2007b). However, the fact that there are few start-ups in <lb/>manufacturing as well as services indicates that the climate for entrepreneurship is not as good as it could <lb/>be (Figure 7) – despite the fact that barriers to entrepreneurship are generally lower in Sweden than <lb/>elsewhere in the OECD. All the more so because the firms that are established and survive tend to grow <lb/>more slowly than in other countries (Eurostat, 2005). Relatively few people in Sweden have ever <lb/>considered starting their own business, and a smaller proportion than elsewhere has experience of running <lb/>a business (OECD, 2004). <lb/>ECO/WKP(2007)37 <lb/></body>

			<body>26. <lb/>The strong investments in human capital reflect large public outlays on the Swedish education <lb/>system. In 2002, public financing of education totalled 7.6% of GDP, compared to 5.4% in the OECD. As <lb/>a result, expenditure per pupil was relatively high in international comparison. However, the performance <lb/>of 15 year olds, as highlighted in the last OECD PISA study, is disappointing where the outcome is only a <lb/>bit above average. In mathematics and in problem solving, Sweden is in fourteenth place, far behind <lb/>neighbouring Finland (which tops the ranking). <lb/>Key economic challenges <lb/>27. <lb/>The Swedish economy has undergone important changes over the last two decades, recovering <lb/>from a long-term decline in GDP per capita. Early steps in regulatory reform, taken in the 1990s, are <lb/>paying off in terms of productivity and GDP growth. However, tensions are visible at the margin. <lb/>Employment rates have not recovered to traditionally high levels, and joblessness is widespread among <lb/>immigrants and youngsters. Also, disability and sickness rates are comparatively high (OECD, 2007b). <lb/>Strong and resilient economic growth since the mid-1990s <lb/>28. <lb/>After the crisis, the Swedish economy came back strongly during the second half of the 1990s <lb/>with GDP growth rates well above that of most other European countries (Figure 9). Since 2001, the <lb/>Swedish economy has outperformed several euro area countries. The economy has proved relatively robust <lb/>in the face of some major recent shocks, including a global slowdown and the burst of the telecoms bubble. <lb/>29. <lb/>The sustained upswing is reflected in key macroeconomic indicators. The economy remains <lb/>competitive, with Sweden&apos;s current account moving from a pre-1993 deficit to a large and growing <lb/>surplus. The fiscal accounts have also improved significantly, with a surplus (more or less) over the last <lb/>eight years. Consumer price inflation has been maintained at a low level since the mid-1990s, despite the <lb/>cyclical upswing, reflecting among other factors productivity gains and increased global competition (not <lb/>least from China and other dynamic Asian economies). 10 <lb/>A performance supported by impressive productivity growth <lb/>30. <lb/>Perhaps the most striking feature of Sweden&apos;s economic performance during the last decade is <lb/>the strong resurgence in labour productivity growth relative to the 1980s (where growth rates were weak <lb/>by international standards). Growth in 1991-1998, measured as value added in the total economy per hour <lb/>worked, averaged 2.2%, compared to 1.2% in the 1980-1990 (Figure 10). From 1999 to 2005, it increased <lb/>further, to 2.5% on average. <lb/>31. <lb/>The surge in productivity growth is also apparent vis-à-vis other countries. Sweden has moved <lb/>from a relatively poor performance to one that puts it in a group of countries with relatively high <lb/>productivity growth (Figure 11). Along with Australia, the United Kingdom and the United States, Sweden <lb/>is one of a few countries having experienced accelerating productivity growth over the last 35 years. <lb/>32. <lb/>For the Swedish economy as a whole, capital accumulation added about ¾ percentage point to <lb/>annual labour productivity growth during 1999-2003, thereby continuing at a roughly unchanged pace <lb/>from previous decades. Consequently, the residual part of output growth that cannot be ascribed to <lb/>increased inputs, so-called multi-factor productivity, has accelerated. It accounted for 1¾ percentage points <lb/>10. <lb/>OECD estimates that imports from China and other dynamic Asian economies, due to globalisation, have <lb/>contributed to reduce inflation in the euro area in the period 2001-2005 by 0.3 percentage points (OECD, <lb/>2006c). <lb/></body>

			<body>of annual labour productivity growth 1999-2003, compared to 0-1½ percentage points in most other <lb/>countries. 11 <lb/>33. <lb/>Several factors are likely to explain improved performance. These include: <lb/>• The reform of the macroeconomic policy framework in the 1990s, which helped to strengthen <lb/>fiscal sustainability and increase the credibility of the monetary policy.<lb/>• The shut-down of low-productivity firms during the economic crises.<lb/>• Structural changes in the economy, including a strong expansion of the ICT industry, leading to a <lb/>relatively high share of value-added produced in high growth sectors, especially in knowledge <lb/>intensive services such as telecommunication services where growth has been especially strong. 12<lb/>• Increasing specialisation and outsourcing due to globalisation.<lb/>• Better measurement of price deflators in Swedish national accounts, leading to higher measured <lb/>productivity in service sectors.<lb/>• A better quality labour force (a growing share of employees have university degrees). 13<lb/>34. <lb/>Regulatory reform played also an important role behind productivity improvements (Figure 10). <lb/>The closure of low productivity firms in the crisis was followed by a boost to the emergence of more <lb/>productive firms through deregulation, which promoted greater competition. Other positive effects <lb/>included the liberalisation of the telecommunication market in the early 1990s, which helped to support <lb/>structural changes through the expansion of knowledge intensive services. Strong productivity growth in <lb/>telecommunications over the past ten years suggests that regulatory reform has spurred economic <lb/>performance in this sector, as is the case in many other OECD countries. <lb/>11. <lb/>For 1986-90, annual labour productivity of 1¼ percent was mostly explained by capital accumulation. <lb/>During the crisis and subsequent recovery years 1991-98, annual labour productivity of 2¼ percent was <lb/>due to capital accumulation and multi-factor productivity in roughly equal proportions. <lb/>12. <lb/>In a study by Boug and Naug (2001) analysing why labour productivity growth in the manufacturing sector <lb/>was significantly higher in Sweden than in Norway during the 1990s, they found that this partly could be <lb/>attributed to differences in industrial composition (most of the remaining differences could be explained by <lb/>some specific Norwegian industries with relatively weak performance). <lb/>13. <lb/>Forsling and Lindstrom (2004) finds that a better-quality labour force, reflecting a growing share of <lb/>employees with higher university degrees, has raised labour productivity growth by about 0.2 percentage <lb/>points per year on average in the business sector. <lb/>ECO/WKP(2007)37 <lb/>18 <lb/>Figure 9.

			<body>GDP and productivity growth should be adjusted for the decline in terms of trade <lb/>35. <lb/>Although the Swedish ICT industry has made a significant contribution to GDP and productivity <lb/>growth over the last decade, the long term effect on an economy of a large ICT industry is deterioration in <lb/>the terms of trade as relative ICT prices typically fall over time. If Swedish GDP and productivity growth <lb/>measures are adjusted to take account of this phenomenon, both measures come out a little lower than <lb/>traditional measures (Box 1 and Figure 10). This puts a slightly less positive slant on Sweden&apos;s <lb/>productivity performance, as well as underlining the need to sustain or even improve performance over <lb/>time. For Swedish companies to sustain their competitive edge in export markets, they will need to raise <lb/>productivity more quickly than competitors. <lb/>Box 1. Adjusting GDP and productivity trend growth measures to take account of ICT <lb/>The flipside of the coin of having a large ICT-industry is that prices of ICT goods have been falling on exports <lb/>markets, thereby leading to a trend decline in terms of trade in Sweden. The terms of trade worsening has negative <lb/>economic effects which need to be taken into account and put the faster productivity developments of Sweden <lb/>somewhat into perspective. A decline in the terms of trade means that fewer goods can be imported with the same <lb/>volume of export goods, i.e. the purchasing power of domestic income decreases. Traditional GDP accounting does <lb/>not take such relative price changes into account as all items are expressed in terms of base year prices. To <lb/>approximate effects from terms of trade changes on the purchasing power of domestic income, nominal exports can be <lb/>deflated using the import price deflator, to create an indicator called &quot; command GDP &quot; . According to such a measure of <lb/>overall consumption possibilities of an economy, Sweden&apos;s yearly growth in terms of &quot; command GDP &quot; has on average <lb/>been 0.7 percentage points lower than traditional GDP growth in the six years to 2005. This is smaller than in Finland <lb/>and Korea, while in the UK and Denmark the effect works in the other direction (OECD, 2005b, 2006b, 2007b) <lb/>(Figure 12). <lb/>Calculating labour productivity growth based on &quot; command GDP &quot; instead of traditional GDP, 0.2 percentage <lb/>points of the pick-up in productivity growth from the 1980s to the 1990s vanishes (see Figure 10). This gap has been <lb/>further widened in recent years, to 0.4 percentage points, reflecting worsening in the terms of trade. <lb/>Figure 12.

			<body>The decline in terms-of-trade has implications for the international comparison of GDP per capita. <lb/>Comparisons of GDP levels over time based on current PPPs use a sequence of benchmark PPPs to construct time <lb/>series of PPP price level indices. These are then applied to GDP time series in current national prices. With such a <lb/>method, the effect of terms-of-trade trends on aggregate real income is captured via its effect on nominal GDP (OECD, <lb/>2002a). By contrast, the OECD Going for Growth 2007 includes a figure for each country comparing the GDP level <lb/>with that of the United States where, for consistency, all of these figures are based on constant rather than current <lb/>purchasing power parities (OECD, 2007c). When using constant PPPs, the time series are derived by applying GDP <lb/>volume growth rates for each country to the common-currency GDP levels of the base year. Such an approach implies <lb/>that terms-of-trade trends are not taken account of, meaning that the figure in the OECD Going for Growth 2007 <lb/>overstates the extent to which Sweden&apos;s gap in GDP per capita has narrowed in recent years. <lb/>Strong productivity growth in manufacturing industries, but more mediocre for services <lb/>36. <lb/>The resurgence in Sweden&apos;s labour productivity growth over the last decade has been strongest in <lb/>the manufacturing sector, where growth in value-added per hour worked averaged 5.9% in the period <lb/>1999-2003 (Table 1). The ICT sector, and one telecommunications company in particular (Ericsson), <lb/>accounts for a significant share of growth. 14 Productivity also rose strongly in the auto, pharmaceutical and <lb/>machinery industries. <lb/>37. <lb/>The ICT sector (both in manufacturing and in communication services) has become a flagship for <lb/>Sweden&apos;s corporate sector, but its importance and contribution to Swedish growth needs to be kept in <lb/>perspective. In the late 1990s, the sector was only slightly larger than in the EU on average, and was much <lb/>smaller than in Europe&apos;s &quot; new economy stars &quot; , Finland and Ireland (OECD, 2005a). Traditional <lb/>manufacturing industries still play an important role alongside ICT. In any case, productivity has improved <lb/>in other manufacturing industries as well. <lb/>38. <lb/>Swedish companies are considered to be leaders in their use of the Internet, and over the last <lb/>decade they have invested heavily in ICT equipment (Figure 13). There are, however, few clear signs that <lb/>this has led to a widespread pick-up in labour productivity growth in the service sectors that are commonly <lb/>thought to benefit most from new technologies, where Sweden in fact is ranking in the middle (see <lb/>Table 1). The reasons for this are not obvious, but one possible explanation is that several service <lb/>industries remain still sheltered from effective competition, either because they are dominated by public <lb/>provision or because they are protected by sector-specific regulations. Thus, looking further into measures <lb/>to improve service sector productivity should be made a policy priority, not least as the shift from goods to <lb/>services has become more pronounced over the last decade (Kongsrud and Wanner, 2005). <lb/>14. <lb/>The rise in labour productivity growth in the ICT sector reflects partly a &quot; structural adjustment &quot; effect, i.e. <lb/>reallocation of resources across different sectors (Lind, 2003; OECD, 2005a, 2007b). <lb/></body>

The trend increase in sick leave and disability benefits is a <lb/>matter of significant policy concern. Open unemployment was around 6% (2005), but almost 9% if people <lb/>on active labour market programmes are also included (Ministry of Finance, 2006). If people who could <lb/>work but are currently on sick leave, on a disability pension or a related benefit, the inactivity level would <lb/>be brought up close to 15% (Ljungqvist and Sargent, 2006; McKinsey Global Institute, 2006). <lb/>40. <lb/>The labour market has been slow to bounce back from the economic crisis in the early 1990s <lb/>despite a strong economic performance. It has taken an unusually long time for output growth to feed <lb/>through to the labour market, although this may be changing. Cross-country evidence indicates that the <lb/>employment response to economic growth is relatively low in Sweden (Davis and Henrekson, 2005). In <lb/>countries where employment reacts more strongly on GDP growth, a larger share of total employment is <lb/>found in service sectors, which make extensive use of low skilled labour to produce goods and services. <lb/>Labour intensive service sectors make up a relatively small share of the Swedish economy. This may be <lb/>partly related to high effective marginal tax rates or high social contribution rates on labour income as well <lb/>as to other barriers to employment. Addressing general barriers to employment, as recommended in the <lb/>restated OECD Jobs Strategy, would help improve the response of the services sector to the new <lb/>opportunities. <lb/></body>

			<body>41. <lb/>Although the aggregate employment rate is relatively high, it differs significantly between <lb/>groups. This suggests room for improvement. Overall male employment rates have not recovered to their <lb/>pre-economic crisis levels, despite economic growth (Figure 14). The employment rate for prime-age men <lb/>has been especially low, reflecting an increase in the number of people receiving a disability benefit <lb/>combined with an increase in the number of people studying. The youth employment rate is also low, as <lb/>young Swedes are spending a relatively long time in education (this in itself is an important factor in the <lb/>development of human capital to underpin an R&amp;D oriented economy). However, for older men (aged 55 <lb/>and above) the employment rate is currently around its pre-economic crisis level and quite high in <lb/>international comparison, probably reflecting the 1999 Swedish pension system reform which increased <lb/>incentives for later retirement. The employment rate for women is also quite high in international <lb/>comparison. It is also worth noting that employment rates are also relatively high for migrants. <lb/>Figure 14. Employment rates by age <lb/>Share of population in each age group being employed <lb/>1. The shaded area shows the middle two quartiles (i.e. half of the countries fall in this range). <lb/>Source: OECD Labour force statistics database. <lb/>Public finances are in relatively good shape, but attention is needed to make welfare arrangements <lb/>sustainable <lb/>42. <lb/>Public finances in Sweden are in fairly good shape compared with most other OECD countries. <lb/>The government as a whole (central and local) is currently running a surplus, and financial assets exceed <lb/>financial liabilities. The main challenge therefore lies ahead, when an ageing population will bring about a <lb/>rise in public expenditure. Sweden is already well prepared for this in comparison to many other OECD <lb/>countries. The 1999 reform of the pension system means that the bulk of future increases in old-age <lb/>pension payments will be financed by a build up in assets over the next couple of decades. Preparing for <lb/>the demographic pressures by reducing debt was one of the main reasons for introducing the 2% medium <lb/>term fiscal surplus target for the general government in 1997. The importance of meeting this target has <lb/></body>

			<note place="headnote">ECO/WKP(2007)37 <lb/></note>

			<page>25 <lb/></page>

			<body>been recognised by the government, as the top down budget process with multi-year expenditure ceilings <lb/>and a medium term fiscal target have delivered a surplus close to the target since 2000, despite several <lb/>years of economic weakness. For 2005, the fiscal surplus was 2.7% of GDP. Achieving the 2% surplus <lb/>target is considered to go a long way towards what is needed to safeguard current service levels. However, <lb/>if &quot; no policy change &quot; is assumed, on which current demographic and labour supply outlooks are projected, <lb/>a fiscal surplus of 3% of GDP may be necessary to ensure that fiscal policy is on a sustainable track <lb/>(OECD, 2005a). <lb/>43. <lb/>Although the Swedish fiscal framework has been working well by international and historical <lb/>standards, the government needs to maintain a strong and enduring commitment to sound public finances. <lb/>This includes emphasising the need to use the surplus target as a guide for policy, ensuring that the level of <lb/>the expenditure ceilings is consistent with the surplus target, and ensuring that these remain binding. The <lb/>government should also ensure that there is an adequate margin for business cycle fluctuations so as to <lb/>avoid spending up to the limit even in good years. <lb/>As the tax burden in Sweden is already relatively high… <lb/>44. <lb/>The tax burden in Sweden is relatively high in international comparison, measured as the ratio of <lb/>total tax revenues to GDP (Figure 15). In 2003, total tax revenues amounted to almost 51% of GDP, <lb/>compared to slightly above 36% in the OECD. The overall high tax burden in the Nordic countries reflects <lb/>among other factors extensive welfare state arrangements. From 1965 to 1990, tax revenues in Sweden <lb/>increased from 35% to 53% of GDP, which was considerably more than in other OECD countries. Over <lb/>the last 15 years the tax burden has been a bit reduced, albeit there have been ups and downs reflecting <lb/>swings in the cyclical position of the Swedish economy (sharing features with other OECD countries). This <lb/>is mainly due to consolidation of public finances as well as public expenditure trends (van den Noord and <lb/>Heady, 2001). <lb/>45. <lb/>A key characteristic of Swedish tax revenues is their broad composition, with a large weight <lb/>attached to income taxes, social security contributions as well as consumption taxes and specific taxes on <lb/>goods and services. However, relatively less weight have been given to corporate taxes, where Sweden in <lb/>fact is placed among a group of countries taxing profits relatively mildly. Overall, the marginal effective <lb/>tax rate on capital is considered to be fairly low in Sweden (OECD, 2006e). Thus, disincentives for <lb/>companies to expand by investing in new capital are smaller than in many other countries. Furthermore, <lb/>effective marginal tax rates on inward foreign direct investments (FDI) are relatively low (Yoo, 2003), <lb/>thereby contributing to a higher ex ante rate of return on FDI. <lb/>46. <lb/>Although the business climate for large corporations is comparatively good, there are also tax <lb/>elements that act relatively more as a &quot; burden &quot; . This applies especially to the system for income taxes, <lb/>where marginal effective tax rates are higher than in most other countries, thereby impacting negatively on <lb/>hours of work. High income taxes also discourage entrepreneurial business development in the service <lb/>sector, as it induces more &quot; do-it-yourself &quot; work (Henrekson, 2005). <lb/></body>

Sweden <lb/>ranks also at the top (with Denmark and Iceland) if spending on social benefits are excluded. Given its <lb/>size, improving public sector efficiency could have an impact on public expenditure needs, and help to <lb/>secure the sustainability of current levels of welfare. <lb/>48. <lb/>Productivity gains in the provision of publicly funded services are important to curb the pressure <lb/>on public expenditure. One of the more effective ways of increasing productivity is to expose the public <lb/>sector to greater competition. Studies in Sweden and abroad have shown that the production and provision <lb/>of public goods and services tends to become significantly more efficient when they are opened up to <lb/>competition, while quality has been maintained or improved (OECD, 2005a). <lb/>49. <lb/>Sweden was an early mover in allowing for private initiatives in the provision of publicly funded <lb/>services such as health care, schools and elderly care. But the government&apos;s efforts to promote competition <lb/>appear to have faded. Restrictions have been put in place on surpluses accruing from the provision of <lb/>publicly funded health care services. There has also been a debate over whether this should apply to private <lb/>sector activities in the school sector. Public financing still usually means public production or delivery, and <lb/>public employees still make up nearly 90% of those providing publicly funded welfare services. Sweden is <lb/>still a long way from exploiting the full potential of competition in the public sector, with a level playing <lb/>field which could stimulate responsiveness and increase client satisfaction. <lb/>ECO/WKP(2007)37 <lb/></body>

Weighted average, New Zealand, Mexico and Turkey excluded. <lb/>Source: OECD economic outlook 79 database and OECD System of National Accounts database. <lb/>Regulatory reform: emerging challenges and the policy responses to date <lb/>Emerging challenges: underlying issues and trends <lb/>An ageing population will require vigilance in the management of public finances <lb/>50. <lb/>Sweden already has a relatively old population, with the largest proportion of very old people <lb/>(aged 80 and over) in the OECD. The impact on public finances is therefore happening sooner than in other <lb/>OECD countries. Demographic projections from Statistics Sweden show that over the next 35 years, the <lb/>proportion of the population aged over 65 will increase by almost 40% (Statistics Sweden, 2005). The rise <lb/>in the number of old people is especially pronounced for those aged 80 or more. At the same time, the <lb/>share of the working age population (the proportion of those aged 15-64 years to total population) is <lb/>projected to fall by around 9%. If the current aggregate employment rate is maintained then the number of <lb/>employed workers for each person aged 65 and above will drop from around 2.8 to 1.8. At this point, the <lb/>old-age dependency ratio (the ratio of those over 65 to the working age population) is set to peak at around <lb/>40%. Whilst this is high, the increase in the dependency ratio is one of the lowest in OECD because <lb/>Sweden is already in a mature phase of its ageing process (Gonand, 2005; OECD, 2005c). <lb/>51. <lb/>Sweden has already taken action to counter the impact of its ageing population. Reforms <lb/>designed to put public pensions on a robust financial basis, together with the relatively moderate increase <lb/>in the dependency ratio, look set to ease future budgetary pressures, at least relative to many other OECD <lb/>countries. Projections indicate that the total increase in Swedish health and long term care expenditure <lb/>from 2005 to 2050 is lowest in the OECD, although this also reflects the fact that spending in these areas is <lb/>ECO/WKP(2007)37 <lb/></body>

			<page>28 <lb/></page>

			<body>already fairly high. An important factor is the participation rate of older workers in the labour market, <lb/>which is one of the highest in Europe and helps to mitigate the pressures of ageing. <lb/>52. <lb/>The increase in the dependency ratio will ceteris paribus slow the rate of growth in GDP per <lb/>capita. The direct effect on labour supply stemming from the demographic changes indicates a slowdown <lb/>of average annual growth in GDP per capita to around 1½%, which is almost ¾ percentage points lower <lb/>than the average over the last 40 years (OECD, 2004). Demographic changes might affect GDP per capita <lb/>even more negatively if, for example, the median, or typical, immigrant continues to have a lower <lb/>productivity than the native Swedish counterpart, or if there is a relative shift towards employment in the <lb/>public sector. <lb/>Encouraging entrepreneurial activity is needed to maintain strong economic growth <lb/>53. Entrepreneurial activity is an important element of a dynamic economy, through its impact on <lb/>economic growth, innovation and job creation (Henrekson, 2005). The main lesson from the OECD&apos;s <lb/>policy guidelines for promoting entrepreneurship is the importance of an integrated institutional and <lb/>economic framework which brings together a number of well conceived programmes to encourage <lb/>entrepreneurship (Box 2). Without this framework, individual programmes are likely to generate weak <lb/>results (OECD, 2004). <lb/>Box 2. OECD policy guidelines for fostering entrepreneurship <lb/>The OECD&apos;s policy guidelines for fostering entrepreneurship emphasise the importance of developing an overall <lb/>institutional framework covering the development of specific programmes. Entrepreneurship programmes can improve <lb/>their effectiveness by drawing on the knowledge of local governments. Main elements of the framework are: <lb/>•  Ensuring that product markets are as open and accessible as possible to new entrants. This means<lb/>promoting competition in all sectors of the economy where competition is feasible, including the provision of <lb/>public services. Legal impediments to the entry of new firms should be removed, and barriers, which limit <lb/>the incentive on enterprises to innovate and grow should be dismantled. Administrative and financial <lb/>burdens on business start-ups should be reduced, via lower start-up costs and simplified administrative <lb/>procedures. Encouraging more open international trade and investment in goods and services further <lb/>enhances competition in product markets. <lb/>•  Adapting employment protection legislation to be more flexible. This includes allowing flexible employment<lb/>contracts to be negotiated, with remuneration arrangements and working conditions (including leave of <lb/>absence rules) that are adapted to the needs of dynamic enterprises, and easing of employment protection <lb/>measures that inhibit restructuring or discourage entrepreneurs from taking on new workers. Particular <lb/>features in the tax system, which act to discourage entrepreneurs or financing of entrepreneurial activity <lb/>should be mitigated, and social insurance provisions may need to be readjusted in cases where they <lb/>discourage would-be entrepreneurs. <lb/>•  Reshaping financial regulations to facilitate financing of entrepreneurs. Regulations governing financial<lb/>institutions and/or financial markets should be shaped in a way that facilitates the availability and optimal <lb/>allocation of finance for entrepreneurial activities. Personal bankruptcy legislation should provide an <lb/>appropriate balance between encouraging risk-taking and protecting creditors. Financial barriers could be <lb/>reduced by facilitating the development of market mechanisms for equity financing and related services, <lb/>especially for start-ups. <lb/>•  Encouraging networking among firms in order to foster a culture of co-operation and risk-taking. Efforts to<lb/>foster the growth of clusters are generally recognised to stimulate entrepreneurship. They can be promoted <lb/>by improved access to accommodation and efficient communications and transport infrastructures, as well <lb/>as by facilitating university/industry linkages. <lb/>Source: OECD, 1998, 2005d, 2006d. <lb/></body>

			<body>54. <lb/>Swedish indicators for start-ups and entrepreneurial activities reflect significant gaps, despite the <lb/>fact that government policies have become more favourable in recent years. Addressing this weakness calls <lb/>for a wide policy strategy involving taxes, regulatory burdens for firms, bankruptcy laws, entrepreneurial <lb/>education, access to finance and other factors holding back risk-taking and entrepreneurship. <lb/>55. <lb/>The former government endorsed entrepreneurship as an important element of its Action Plan for <lb/>Employment which was linked to the EU&apos;s Lisbon Strategy. Initiatives included plans to reduce the <lb/>administrative burden for companies, provision of grants to people either unemployed or employed in <lb/>regional development support who wish to start their own businesses, and courses offered in <lb/>entrepreneurship and business skills. The new Government has put entrepreneurship very high in the list of <lb/>its policy priorities as a way of creating new jobs and offering citizens more control and choice over their <lb/>lives (Box 3). <lb/>Box 3. Recent policy initiatives that will promote entrepreneurship <lb/>As part of the 2007 Budget, the new government has introduced a number of policy initiatives aimed at <lb/>improving the conditions for entrepreneurship: <lb/>•  The wealth tax will be halved from 1.5% to 0.75% as a prelude to abolishing it later in this electoral period.<lb/>•  Taxation will be simplified for closely held companies (the so-called 3:12 rules which apply for companies<lb/>with a small number of owners). Pending broad review, changes will be introduced in 2007, inter alia making <lb/>it easier to employ more staff and sell companies. More of the entrepreneur&apos;s own income will be taxed as <lb/>capital income for which the rate is lower than for income from work. <lb/>•  To enhance the role of women in business, a set of initiatives will be taken to enhance support and advice<lb/>for women entrepreneurs as well as research on women&apos;s entrepreneurship. <lb/>•  The regulatory burden for firms should be reduced by 25% over a period of four years, and a special task<lb/>force has been established to achieve this. <lb/>Consideration is being given to introducing state guarantees for borrowing by small and medium-sized firms <lb/>and to adjusting capital taxation in a way that would stimulate the availability of risk capital. <lb/>56. <lb/>More entrepreneurship might enhance the economy&apos;s ability to venture into new business fields <lb/>and also spur less tangible innovation, competition and job creation in domestically oriented sectors. <lb/>Vibrant product market competition is a prerequisite to expanding entrepreneurial activity. Improving the <lb/>balance between public and private providers of publicly funded services could be one place to start, as <lb/>Sweden has one of the largest public sectors in the world, measured as general government employment as <lb/>a share of total employment, but competition in major areas is inadequate or does not exist. Opening up a <lb/>greater proportion of public services to competition would increase the opportunities available to potential <lb/>entrepreneurs and stimulate innovative business ventures. International experience suggests a &quot; snowball <lb/>effect &quot; : the presence of entrepreneurs encourages others to try it too (OECD, 2004). <lb/>57. <lb/>State ownership of business companies is comparatively wide in Sweden and may in some <lb/>sectors hold back entrepreneurship and makes potential competitors less keen on entering (OECD, 2007b). <lb/>It is therefore welcome that the government has announced plans for considerable privatisations at a <lb/>volume of approximately SEK 50 billion a year. First in line are shareholdings in the financial sector <lb/>(Nordea, OMX, SBAB), communication (TeliaSonera), properties (Vasakronan) and retail (Vin&amp;Sprit). <lb/>Thereafter comes areas like transport (SAS). The revenues will be used to reduce central government debt. <lb/></body>

			<body>58. <lb/>Encouragement could also take place through reviewing saving arrangements so as to reduce <lb/>disincentives for entrepreneurial investments. Most entrepreneurs start out by drawing on their own <lb/>savings. But the Swedish system discourages the accumulation of wealth outside of institutional savings <lb/>such as pension plans. Equity financing is another issue. Growing firms can expand by seeking private <lb/>equity financing from &quot; business angels &quot; or venture capital firms. Sweden has a relatively high proportion <lb/>of venture capital aimed at early stage and expansion activities compared to other European countries, but <lb/>the pool of potential &quot; angels &quot; is low due to the relatively small number of successful entrepreneurs. <lb/>59. <lb/>Reviewing employment protection legislation and the unemployment insurance system so as to <lb/>reduce the risk of shifting from secure employment to self-employment could also help foster <lb/>entrepreneurship (Box 4). Currently, Swedish law requires employers to allow their workers to take up to <lb/>six months leave of absence to establish a new business under certain conditions. This is helpful but at the <lb/>same time, employment protection rules are based on a &quot; first in – last out &quot; principle: the longer the service <lb/>the more secure the post. Starting an enterprise, however, is typically risky and may generate very little net <lb/>income for some years. Entrepreneurs cannot be sure that they will be able to get back, and their situation <lb/>is exacerbated by the high earnings-related component of the unemployment insurance system. <lb/>Box 4. Security is lost if an experienced employee quits to start a new business <lb/>Consider a woman entering a large or medium-sized Swedish company at the age of 25. If twenty years later, at <lb/>age 45, she wishes to start a new firm on her own, she will face a difficult trade-off between uncertain business <lb/>success and a very secure job. Her current employer cannot lay her off individually without first trying an internal <lb/>transfer and retraining to enable her to carry out different work. If she is ultimately laid off, she must be given notice six <lb/>months in advance and, should the layoff be judged as unfair, the employer must pay her a compensation equal to <lb/>32 months&apos; salary – larger than in any other OECD country. In case of collective dismissal, the last-in-first-out rule <lb/>reinforces the safe position of experienced staff. This security is lost if leaving the job. If the new business fails, she <lb/>would not only go through a period of low earnings while striving to keep the business alive; when subsequently <lb/>closing down, there will not be a notice period with full salary while looking for a job. Moreover, as the level of <lb/>unemployment benefits is calculated on the basis of previous earnings, failing entrepreneurs are disadvantaged <lb/>relative to someone laid off from a job, as pointed out by OECD in previous Economic Surveys (OECD, 2004). In some <lb/>cases, large companies have circumvented these adverse effects by allowing employees a leave while starting a new <lb/>business and this could be used more. But this still solves only part of the problem, as the extra job security enjoyed if <lb/>having long tenure may still make it difficult for new firms to attract highly talented experienced staff. <lb/>Tough bankruptcy procedures add to the risk of starting a business – in particular if based on innovations for <lb/>which it can be difficult to assess the market potential other than by trying it out in practice. In Sweden, creditors have <lb/>claims on a person&apos;s assets for 10 years following a bankruptcy. Consequently, failing entrepreneurs risk not only <lb/>losing their savings; they will have to live modestly for a long time to come. In most European countries, creditors&apos; <lb/>claims on a bankrupt&apos;s assets expire after less than 10 years, and regulations are fundamentally different in North <lb/>America, where claims expire after just one year (United States) or even shorter time (Canada), thereby making it <lb/>possible for failed entrepreneurs to use their experience to start up a new firm (OECD, 2001 and 2005f). A recent <lb/>Danish poverty study revealed that the downside can be hard for entrepreneurs, as self-employed were found to be the <lb/>socio-economic group most at risk of poverty – several times more at risk than for example single parents as a group <lb/>(Danish Economic Council, 2006). Fluctuating income, small shops and similar factors may explain most of the poverty <lb/>among self-employed, but the finding nevertheless suggests that a study of whether social security and bankruptcy <lb/>rules make the downside excessively hard for Swedish entrepreneurs might be worthwhile. <lb/>Should the new business prove successful, the net income gain is limited by high marginal income taxes which <lb/>set in early. Until this year, wealth tax at a rate of 1½ per cent applied already from SEK 1.5 million, or SEK 3 million <lb/>for couples (for comparison, an average one-family house in greater Gothenburg, Malmö or Stockholm costs <lb/>SEK 2.8 million), further limiting the upside associated with entrepreneurship. Finally, the tax rules for closely held <lb/>companies have until this year been unfavourable to fast-growing firms set up by entrepreneurs, as a large part of <lb/>income accruing from these firms was classified as wage income (Henrekson, 2005). The recent changes in wealth <lb/>and business taxation are therefore welcome (see Box 3). <lb/></body>

			<body>60. <lb/>Although much effort has been devoted to developing policies and programmes in support of <lb/>small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), the relative lack of entrepreneurship has historical, cultural <lb/>and political origins, which reinforce each other. Entrepreneurship does not have great appeal in a country <lb/>where people traditionally look to large companies and state entities for employment, and political <lb/>consensus in decision making may reflect alliances among insiders in the social system, which may <lb/>exclude outsiders such as SMEs or new industries. The issue has been the subject of considerable political <lb/>debate in Sweden. <lb/>61. <lb/>Globalisation is often pointed to as posing a number of challenges for the Swedish economy. <lb/>Given the persistent and large current account surplus and the fact that Sweden has risen steadily in <lb/>international rankings of business climate and competitiveness during recent years, Sweden seems <lb/>relatively well placed to benefit from globalisation. Nevertheless, globalisation accentuates the importance <lb/>of dealing with insider-outsider problems and the lack of entrepreneurship, so as to enhance the economy&apos;s <lb/>ability to &quot; reinvent itself &quot; in the context of restructuring associated with international relocation of activity <lb/>and to ensure that increased mobility does not produce large groups of inactive outsiders. Similarly, <lb/>globalisation accentuates the importance of handling fiscal pressures in a way that does not lead to <lb/>increasing taxes, as international mobility will most likely increase the distortions generated by high taxes. <lb/>There is no room for complacency, and in order to get broadest possible debate on the challenges and <lb/>opportunities that follow from globalisation, the Government intends to appoint a public inquiry a <lb/>Globalisation Council. <lb/>Swedish reforms to date <lb/>Deregulation in the past has strengthened competition… <lb/>62. <lb/>Sweden was an early mover in the use of regulatory reform to open up the economy and boost <lb/>competition following countries like the United Kingdom (see Figure 17). Reforms in the 1990s across a <lb/>range of sectors removed barriers to market entry, dismantled price regulations and abolished controls on <lb/>the number of market players (OECD, 2007a). Stronger competition legislation was also introduced. In <lb/>international comparison, Sweden&apos;s product market regulation is now relatively &quot; light touch &quot; , and Sweden <lb/>is one of the most liberalised countries in the OECD. <lb/>63. <lb/>While several network sectors were liberalised in the 1990s, their speed and rate of success varies <lb/>considerably (SOU, 2005). The isolated effects of specific reforms in these sectors are hard to disentangle <lb/>from other factors such as technological development, globalisation and institutional changes such as <lb/>accession to the EU. In some cases, notably telecommunications, the effect of reform has overall been very <lb/>positive. Prices have fallen (prices for fixed telephony are among the lowest in the OECD) and the range of <lb/>products as well as product volume have increased. The postal market was liberalised much earlier than in <lb/>other EU and OECD countries. The success of reform in some other sectors, however, has been mixed and <lb/>uncertain. <lb/>64. <lb/>The taxi market offers an example of a mixed outcome of deregulation so far. Prices for taxi <lb/>journeys have increased more than prices in general and also more than production costs, but waiting time <lb/>has been reduced. This may well, however, reflect the preference attached by consumers to a short waiting <lb/>time, which has required an increase in the number of taxis. Special measures to maintain taxi traffic in <lb/>large parts of Sweden that are scarcely populated (taxis may offer transport services funded by local <lb/>government) are another complicating element of the picture. Another example is the electricity market, <lb/>where liberalisation has not automatically led to lower prices, either for consumers or for companies. <lb/>Prices have increased faster than consumer prices in general. A number of factors appear to have <lb/>contributed to this disappointing outcome. Generation capacity has fallen with the decommissioning of <lb/>uneconomic plants, and the closure of two nuclear reactors, whilst demand has grown. At the same time, <lb/></body>

			<body>Sweden depends largely on hydro power and hydrological conditions have been unfavourable. Market <lb/>concentration remains an issue (SOU, 2005). Although the Swedish electricity market is less concentrated <lb/>than in many other European countries, few new firms have entered the market after liberalisation, which <lb/>may partly be due to difficulties in obtaining building permits. Other factors leading to higher prices are <lb/>increased market integration with other European countries and the emission trading system. <lb/>…and delivered a considerable &quot; productivity dividend &quot; <lb/>65. <lb/>Regulatory reform in favour of product market competition stimulates productivity growth by <lb/>fostering innovation, giving firms stronger incentives to adopt best practice (Nicoletti and Scarpetta, <lb/>2005a). Empirical evidence suggests that the product market deregulation of the early 1990s played an <lb/>important role in the recovery of the Swedish economy by boosting productivity growth (Box 5). <lb/>Box 5. The &quot; productivity dividend from regulatory reforms in Sweden <lb/>The extent to which product market deregulation has increased labour productivity growth can be tested <lb/>by a sector-based model which has been developed by the OECD. The model is estimated over the period <lb/>1978 to 2003 for 21 OECD countries covered by the OECD indicators of regulation in product markets. The <lb/>indicators used reflect the &quot; knock-on &quot; effects of less competition-friendly product market regulations in non-<lb/>manufacturing sectors (airlines, railways, and road freight, energy (electricity, gas), communications (post, <lb/>telecoms), professional services (accounting, legal, engineering, architecture), retail trade, and banking). <lb/>Productivity growth (measured as value added per worker employed) is linked to a country&apos;s regulatory and <lb/>other characteristics, as well as reflecting the transfer of technology from the country with the highest level of <lb/>productivity (Conway and Nicoletti, 2006). <lb/>1 The model not only tests the direct effect on productivity growth, but <lb/>also the fact that product market regulation can have an indirect effect by influencing the speed with which <lb/>countries catch up with the productivity leader. Barriers to market entry and to competition in a market may <lb/>reduce incentives to invest and adopt leading production techniques, and so lowers a country&apos;s speed of <lb/>convergence. <lb/>This model was used to calculate the labour productivity dividend from deregulation in Sweden since 1988 <lb/>(a year taken to reflect pre-regulatory reform conditions). <lb/></body>

			<note place="footnote">2 The model&apos;s prediction for the average annual growth <lb/>rate of labour productivity in Sweden over the period 1994 to 2003, assuming no change in product market <lb/>regulation from 1988, was compared with the prediction for labour productivity growth based on actual reforms <lb/>(Figure 17). <lb/>The results suggest that, if Sweden had kept product market regulations as they were in 1988, average <lb/>annual labour productivity growth in the business sector would have been 0.4 percentage points lower than <lb/>otherwise over the period 1994 to 2003. This figure reflects the (indirect) effect of product market regulation on <lb/>the ability to keep up with productivity growth and converge towards the country with the highest level of labour <lb/>productivity. More than half of this indirect effect is through non-ICT intensive sectors. In most other countries <lb/>the benefits of reform are typically larger in ICT-intensive sectors, which tend to suffer from less competition-<lb/>friendly regulation. A possible explanation is that Sweden is closer to the productivity frontier in ICT-intensive <lb/>industries than most other countries. This implies that the productivity gains from faster catch-up are now more <lb/>limited relative to countries further behind the frontier. In addition, the results suggest that product market <lb/>regulation has a (direct) effect in ICT-intensive sectors, implying that deregulation since 1988 has added <lb/>0.45 percentage points to annual productivity growth. Both the direct and indirect effects capture the impact of <lb/>product market regulation on productivity growth within sectors. If regulatory reform also leads to resources <lb/>shifting from less to more productive sectors then the overall productivity &quot; dividend &quot; from reform implied by the <lb/>results will be larger. <lb/>Aggregating the two effects, using value added shares in the economy as weights and a classification of <lb/>ICT intensive industries established by the OECD, suggest that deregulation of key network sectors during the <lb/>1990s has lifted labour productivity growth in Sweden on an annual basis by around 0.4 percentage points. <lb/>3 It <lb/>has, however, to be kept in mind that this figure is based on experiences from a large number of OECD <lb/>countries, and the way that deregulation has worked through in Sweden may well have been different because <lb/>of the economic crisis in the 1990s. <lb/></note>

			<body>But more could be done to reap the full benefits of liberalisation in network sectors <lb/>The telecommunications market <lb/>66. <lb/>The liberalised telecommunication market has, over the past decade, played an increasingly <lb/>important role in the Swedish economy through its positive impact on productivity growth and <lb/>technological diffusion. Given the sector&apos;s importance to the economy and the fact that regulatory <lb/>frameworks for infrastructure sectors need regular adaptation to keep up with technological developments, <lb/>it would be helpful to review current arrangements with a view to fine tuning where necessary. The <lb/>Regulatory Reform Commission (SOU, 2005), which has evaluated the deregulation of six Swedish <lb/>network sectors, raises the issue of vertical separation of the major incumbent operator in the fixed <lb/>telephony segment (Telia Sonera AB), as this may improve competition. It also recommends that the <lb/>regulator (PTS) should take a stronger lead in monitoring price developments, and that the government <lb/>should investigate how Sweden could achieve a more effective spectrum use through a system based on <lb/>market determined allocation of spectrum rights. Other regulatory challenges are emerging in the light of <lb/>technological development and the growing integration of fixed and mobile services. <lb/>The electricity market <lb/>67. <lb/>The outcome of liberalisation in the electricity sector has so far been mixed, which may reflect <lb/>issues with the regulatory framework. The Regulatory Reform Commission has pointed out several areas in <lb/>the regulatory framework which need to be improved. These include stronger monitoring by the <lb/>Competition Authority of market concentration among power generators, a stronger and clearer policy for <lb/>mergers and acquisitions, tighter regulation of the grid companies including stronger supervision of <lb/>regional grid companies, and strengthening of the role of consumers (SOU, 2005). <lb/>Regulatory reform: Strengthening the foundations for growth <lb/>An effective and dynamic regulatory policy as a tool for policy coherence and economic growth <lb/>Sweden has fairly flexible product markets… <lb/>68. <lb/>There is growing empirical evidence of a strong link between regulatory reform and economic <lb/>growth, as evidenced by the OECD&apos;s growth study and analysis of the OECD database on Product Market <lb/>Regulation (PMR) (Nicoletti and Scarpetta, 2005a and Conway and Nicoletti, 2006). The growth study <lb/>seeks to establish the extent to which GDP divergences reflects differences in the effectiveness of public <lb/>policies (OECD, 2006a). It develops a benchmarking system based on a set of policy indicators which are <lb/>then linked to high level performance indicators (e.g. GDP per capita or productivity). The PMR database <lb/>seeks to measure, over time, regulatory barriers to competition in product markets. Data collected in 1998 <lb/>and 2003 on economy-wide regulation cover issues such as firm ownership and control, antitrust <lb/>exclusions, and market access; regulatory and administrative policies; administrative requirements for <lb/>business start ups; and discriminatory polices vis-à-vis foreign firms. <lb/>69. <lb/>Analysis of the PMR database shows that there has been clear progress in removing regulatory <lb/>barriers to competition since 1998, as countries with relatively restrictive policies move toward the <lb/>regulatory environment of the more liberalised countries (Conway et. al., 2005). Sweden is among the <lb/>most liberalised countries. Across countries, the largest reductions are in barriers to international flows of <lb/>trade and investment, where all the specific indicators show progress (Figure 18). The area which shows <lb/>least progress is barriers to entrepreneurship where the only significant change is a decline in the number <lb/>of licence and permit systems. Despite progress, a &quot; hard core &quot; of regulations persists in virtually all OECD <lb/>countries. <lb/>ECO/WKP(2007)37 <lb/></body>

There is an <lb/>increasing connection between competition enhancing policies, regulatory reform and enhanced <lb/>productivity performance.

			<body>72. <lb/>Sweden is a country with a low level of product market regulation, but a relatively high level of <lb/>employment protection legislation. Its index for EPL is higher than the OECD average, and higher than for <lb/>the other Nordic countries. Furthermore, no progress has been made since 1998, which puts Sweden close <lb/>to the more restrictive countries (Figure 19). Reviewing labour market legislation so as to achieve greater <lb/>labour market dynamism and promote entrepreneurship while providing workers with adequate protection <lb/>could help to revitalise some service sector activities. Cross-country evidence indicates that flexibility in <lb/>the labour market is important in facilitating growth in the service sector (Kongsrud and Wanner, 2005). <lb/>Figure 19.

Based on the same model as described in Box 5, empirical evidence suggests <lb/>that future gains from moving to current best-practice regulation in non-manufacturing sectors (passenger <lb/>air transport, telecoms, electricity, gas, post, rail, road freight, and professional services, retail and banking <lb/>services) are on the low side. This places Sweden in a group of countries with relatively small gains from <lb/>implementing best-practice regulation, implying that other countries could learn from the deregulation <lb/>process of Swedish network sectors while Sweden can still improve the effectiveness of reforms already in <lb/>place. <lb/>…implementation still needs attention… <lb/>74. <lb/>Although empirical evidence indicates that additional gains from regulatory reform might be on <lb/>the low side, a number of modifying factors should be taken into account. Firstly, actual experience in <lb/>several countries, not least Sweden, shows that productivity gains can be realised by opening up markets <lb/></body>

			<note place="headnote">ECO/WKP(2007)37 <lb/></note>

			<page>37 <lb/></page>

			<body>for competition. But, liberalisation is also typically a learning-by-doing process, whereby the regulatory <lb/>system put in place occasionally needs to be adjusted or reinvigorated. Several adjustments have already <lb/>been made in this respect in Sweden, but still there appear to be scope for improvements (SOU, 2005). <lb/>…and best practise could be further developed <lb/>75. <lb/>Even those countries having implemented best practice regulation could improve their systems. <lb/>This would include further fine-tuning of current regulatory systems, or alternatively inventing new <lb/>systems that are even more effective. Further development could help to shift the best-practice frontier <lb/>outwards, which would inter alia increase potential gains from regulatory reform. <lb/>There are also areas not covered by the regulatory indicators, but where gains from deregulation are <lb/>likely to be large <lb/>76. <lb/>There are also areas which are not covered by the indicators used to calculate productivity gains <lb/>from implementing best-practice regulation – but where gains nevertheless are likely to be large. The <lb/>public sector is particularly relevant in this respect as regulations and actual government behaviour <lb/>determines how well the public/private interface works. Improving this interface by opening up for more <lb/>competition in the provision of publicly financed services may generate significant gains (Lundsgaard, <lb/>2003). This would also give incentives to undertake innovation in the provision of such services. There are <lb/>also other factors that may impact on the productivity gains from implementing best practise regulation, <lb/>such as the interplay between research and development activities carried out in public universities and <lb/>business sector adoption. <lb/>Policy areas for further regulatory reform in Sweden <lb/>Promoting a more efficient and effective public sector <lb/>Expanding public procurement <lb/>77. <lb/>Regulatory reform can promote a more efficient public sector by introducing competition in the <lb/>provision of public services. Involving a wider set of alternative providers is one way of nurturing <lb/>innovation and competition. Sweden has adopted the EC Directive on public procurement, but it has <lb/>proved difficult to ensure full compliance with their requirements, as is the case in other EU countries. <lb/>Openly advertised public procurement amounted to slightly less than 5% of GDP in 2004, which was <lb/>higher than the EU average. However, the total value of public procurement in Sweden is 17% of GDP, <lb/>which is relatively high in international comparison. Public consumption is also higher in Sweden than in <lb/>most other countries, and the scope for further openly advertised public procurement (or other forms of <lb/>exposure to competition) has been estimated at 11-12% of GDP (OECD, 2004). Without changing its <lb/>social model, Sweden can benefit from seeking inspiration from countries like the Netherlands, where the <lb/>majority of long-term care institutions for older persons are non-profit and other private institutions, and in <lb/>neighbouring Norway, where 40% of the children in day care attend private institutions that are publicly <lb/>funded (Figure 20). It seems that there is significant scope for improvement in this area. <lb/>78. <lb/>Aside from improvements in the services provided in Sweden, increased competition and <lb/>innovation in these areas can bring gains in terms of service exports. Back in the early 1990s, Sweden <lb/>carried out a wave of reforms to involve alternative private suppliers in publicly funded services. This has <lb/>paved the way for a number of business successes including a Swedish company winning the largest-ever <lb/>contract made by the UK National Health Service with a private provider for care. 15 The new government&apos;s <lb/>15. <lb/>Capio, which started in Sweden in 1994 and listed on the Stockholm Stock Exchange in 2000, now has <lb/>activities in France, Germany, Spain, the United Kingdom and a number of other European countries.

			<body>centres, sun-bed centres and privately financed health care, either as part of the municipal administration or <lb/>through municipal enterprises. <lb/>80. <lb/>This practice has been reviewed and challenged in a number of reports, including from the <lb/>Swedish Competition Authority, the National Audit Office, and government committees (OECD, 2004). In <lb/>a number of cases it has been found that there is no legitimate reason for the government to engage in <lb/>activities on competitive markets. In addition, such engagement reduces market effectiveness by distorting <lb/>the competitive playing field. These activities are not well policed, state entities often have a head-start on <lb/>private firms through privileged access to essential infrastructure, and they may well be large buyers in a <lb/>small market. Clearer mandates for the agencies&apos; core activities could help, as well as a clear limit on <lb/>expansion beyond the core. It also needs to ensure that local governments agree and respect clear guidance <lb/>on the scope of their local activities. In short, the legal framework governing the market activities of public <lb/>institutions should be strengthened. <lb/>Reforming other sectors which have a broad impact on the economy <lb/>The rental housing market is heavily regulated, hindering mobility <lb/>81. <lb/>A well-functioning rental housing market is important in order not to distort the basis of on which <lb/>people make their choices. It improves overall mobility by making it easier for households to find housing <lb/>according to changing needs. However, rent regulation can be seen as a way of meeting distributional <lb/>objectives as it implies a transfer of resources from landlords to tenants. Another way of doing this is to <lb/>use taxation of rental income to subsidise rent payers. It may also be seen as a protection against excessive <lb/>rent increases imposed by monopolist landlords. Most countries have regulation that limits rent increases <lb/>for sitting tenants, but practices differ for new tenants (OECD, 2006b). Overall, the redistributive effects of <lb/>such policies across the OECD are uncertain and inconsistent (Ellingsen and Englund, 2003). It is not clear <lb/>that the most needy households reap the largest benefits. Also, there are more efficient ways of achieving <lb/>equity objectives (i.e. that citizens obtain proper housing at a reasonable price) in this area. From an <lb/>efficiency point of view, letting tenants in rental housing pay rents that better reflect differences in quality, <lb/>location and demand would considerably improve the functioning of the housing market, in addition to <lb/>promoting the flexibility and mobility which is important to sustain economic growth. <lb/>82. <lb/>The Swedish rental market, however, falls well short of this objective. A large part of the rental <lb/>housing stock is subject to comprehensive rent regulation and extensive tenure rights. This means that <lb/>prices cannot fulfil their role of helping the market to allocate housing efficiently and of providing signals <lb/>to expand the housing stock. The result is a very segregated market and limited turnover as tenants stay <lb/>with low rent apartments, even if these no longer suit their needs or preferences (OECD, 2007b). <lb/></body>
