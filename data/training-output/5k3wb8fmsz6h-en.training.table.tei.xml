            <table>Page | 10<lb/> Parallel to the process of developing competition, many OECD governments have adopted<lb/> policies in order to decarbonise electricity generation in the coming decades. To meet the<lb/> greenhouse gas reduction objectives and mitigate global warming, governments are actively<lb/> pursuing low‐carbon policies. Defining high level principles for the electricity market is simple: set<lb/> a high carbon price, add some technology‐specific support and create a competitive market<lb/> platform to bring in new technologies and innovative solutions. This will create the foundation for<lb/> decarbonising the electricity sector at least cost and delivering adequate generation capacity to<lb/> maintain electricity security of supply. This being said, existing carbon pricing mechanisms such as<lb/> the European Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) seem sufficient to influence dispatching decisions<lb/> and investment choices between readily available technologies such as coal and gas, but do not<lb/> create sufficient incentive for the large‐scale commercial deployment of new low‐carbon<lb/> technologies.<lb/> Uncertainty about climate and renewables policies impacts future<lb/> investment needs<lb/> Policies have been introduced or are being considered to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. But<lb/> defining appropriate policies during the transition is necessarily an incremental development<lb/> process. The global climate negotiations have proved to be challenging and most stakeholders do<lb/> not expect a new global agreement to enter into force before 2020 at the earliest. Regional<lb/> carbon markets introduced to date have resulted in prices that are to too low and too uncertain<lb/> to trigger low‐carbon investments. Given that any carbon market is driven by policy decisions and<lb/> is subject to uncertain economic and technological developments, carbon price volatility is to be<lb/> expected. Facing this situation, some countries have introduced a carbon price floor(s) (the United<lb/> Kingdom) while others are considering introducing sectoral measures restricted to electricity<lb/> generation (the United States) rather than economy‐wide carbon markets.<lb/> Renewables support schemes have proven effective at facilitating deployment.

Examples of such policies include<lb/> providing more certainty for carbon pricing, defining attainable policy goals, developing<lb/> predictable policies for renewables and energy efficiency, and avoiding sudden decisions that can<lb/> erode certainty and confidence among market participants. Governments should aim to provide<lb/> as much certainty and predictability as possible, recognizing that the uncertain economic<lb/> environment and technological developments will demand a degree of flexibility.<lb/> Delivering cost‐effective energy efficiency improvements is a critical component of electricity<lb/> security. If this potential is left untapped, greater investment will be needed in new generation.<lb/> Well‐functioning markets create incentives to deliver innovative and cost‐effective demand<lb/> © OECD/IEA 2012<lb/> Securing Power during the Transition<lb/> Page | 11<lb/> response and energy efficiency. Policies should seek to complement and build on these<lb/> incentives. However it is important that there is as much certainty as possible that energy<lb/> efficiency policies will deliver their targets, both to ensure that costs are minimised and so that<lb/> they do not introduce undue uncertainty in demand trends that would make investment in supply<lb/> more challenging.<lb/> Increasing shares of variable renewables exacerbate the issues with investments in peak power<lb/> plants. The variability of electricity demand and the need to meet peak demand has always been<lb/> a concern for system operators. During a few hours of peak demand, efficient electricity<lb/> wholesale hourly prices are volatile and much higher than the yearly average wholesale price:<lb/> efficient peak prices reflect the costs of the plants needed to meet peak demand. With high<lb/> shares of wind and solar power, new investment in capacity, including generation plants, demand<lb/> response, storage capacity will be needed. However, attracting sufficient and timely investment in<lb/> peak capacity and incentivizing demand response has proven to be a problem for several OECD<lb/> electricity markets.<lb/> Removing restrictions on wholesale peak prices during scarcity conditions is important to<lb/> ensure well‐functioning electricity markets. Wholesale peak prices during scarcity conditions are<lb/> not intrinsically bad, since in periods of scarcity, high prices act to incentivise demand response.<lb/> More sophisticated structural and behavioural remedies should be pursued to address concerns<lb/> about market power, rather than poorly targeted price controls. Ultimately a more flexible<lb/> demand side would contribute to mitigating market power and price volatility, and ought to be<lb/> pursued to enhance market efficiency and flexibility.<lb/> Increasing shares of variable renewables will decrease load factors of base‐load plants and mid‐<lb/> merit plants, add to the variability of revenues and can lead to very low wholesale prices during<lb/> hours of high renewable generation with zero fuel cost. Variable renewable resources will<lb/> reduce conventional base‐load capacity needs over time. Yearly variability of weather conditions<lb/> may further increase the variability of revenues. Compounded with uncertain carbon prices, this<lb/> will further deter market‐based investment in low‐carbon base‐load technologies. Attracting<lb/> financing with more volatile and variable cash flows will become an increasing challenge,<lb/> exacerbated by the current financial context.<lb/> Variable renewables will need to provide flexibility services in<lb/> order to secure system operations<lb/> At significant penetration levels, generation using variable renewable energy magnifies the<lb/> volatility of real‐time electricity balancing, increasing the challenge to maintain reliable and<lb/> secure power system operations.

The higher the carbon price, the more low‐carbon investments are made.<lb/> However, the carbon price alone is currently too low in Europe to support nuclear and renewable<lb/> power investment. Assuming a higher carbon price, investors may fear political intervention,<lb/> which undermines the future credibility of the carbon price.<lb/> Confronted with this situation, the UK Administration&apos;s proposed solution has been to introduce<lb/> long‐term contracts that take away electricity market price risk from investors, and are legally<lb/> enforceable and hence credible in a way that the carbon price − even a carbon price floor − is not.<lb/> This proposal, where the government picks up the technologies and transfers part of the risk to<lb/> taxpayers, is a quite noticeable change in the United Kingdom, which pioneered electricity<lb/> liberalisation in the 1990s.<lb/> Another important question regarding low‐carbon investment concerns the functioning of<lb/> electricity markets when marginal costs are low and investment costs of each plant are high. One<lb/> often mentioned issue is that market prices with high shares of renewables would reduce prices<lb/> and undermine the incentives to invest, even with a high carbon price. According to this analysis,<lb/> investments in low‐carbon generation would stop once prices are too low, and may not deliver<lb/> the investment needed in the nearly full decarbonisation scenarios foreseen in 2050. This issue<lb/> calls for further research.</figDesc>
