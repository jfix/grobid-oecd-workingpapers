			<front>Dalry Primary – An Innovative <lb/>Scottish Case Study <lb/>ISSN 1609-7548 <lb/>Dalry Primary – An Innovative Scottish Case Study <lb/>PEB Exchange 2008/15 <lb/>© OECD 2008 <lb/>By Malcolm Summers, Scottish Government, United Kingdom <lb/>In presenting this case study of an innovative school building in Scotland, the author describes its <lb/>unique design features, conveys the viewpoints of the users, client and design team, and reveals the <lb/>lessons learned. <lb/>Dalry Primary, North Ayrshire <lb/>IntrodUctIon <lb/>Dalry Primary School in North Ayshire is the latest case study featured on the Scottish Government&apos;s <lb/>website. By April 2009, the website will provide 32 case studies of recently completed nursery, primary <lb/>and secondary school buildings in Scotland. The purpose is to highlight good practice and demonstrate <lb/>different approaches to school design issues to help inform local authorities and others involved in the <lb/>planning, briefing and design of school estate projects. <lb/>Dalry Primary is a unique project involving the close collaboration of artists, architects and the county&apos;s <lb/>council in designing and realising a new concept in primary school building. The whole school is <lb/>designed as a learning prototype, offering multiple opportunities to engage with different organisational <lb/>and teaching methods, utilising or modifying the facilities and spaces. It does not impose directions or <lb/>solutions, but offers them as options. <lb/> &quot; The brain &quot; <lb/>PEB Exchange 2008/15 – ISSN 1609-7548 – © OECD 2008 <lb/>Dalry Primary – An Innovative Scottish Case Study <lb/></front>

			<body>deSIGn featUreS <lb/>North Ayrshire Council aimed to create a new language of learning projects, ideas, concepts and data <lb/>through the fabric of the new school building. The architecture is developed through a &quot; geometry of <lb/>information &quot; : routes tell stories, layout suggests systems of measurement, and specific spatial relationships <lb/>inform about the local and global environment. Facts, figures, phrases and fables have been incorporated <lb/>into the structure with historical &quot; site specific &quot; text and information. <lb/>In reference to the vernacular architecture of North Ayrshire, the external fabric is predominantly white <lb/>with black highlighted openings and features. Closer to, and particularly when viewing into or through <lb/>the building, individual features of anomalous shape and colour indicate the internal detail. It is a building <lb/>designed as an educational instrument, offering richness and excitement from the inside looking out. <lb/>Themed class base <lb/>The design places particular importance on the 14 class bases which act as &quot; home bases &quot; for each class&apos;s <lb/>general activities: these are themed classrooms, each containing unique features and instruments. This <lb/>layout enhances a feeling of belonging and offers an exciting backdrop for learning. <lb/>Special purpose houses <lb/>The school is conceived as a collection of houses. Each house is ascribed a particular function or <lb/>thematic description, which suggests patterns of use and occupancy. <lb/>The environmental House rises up through the building, and where it intrudes through the roof it takes <lb/>on the role of observatory designed to monitor and interact with the natural environment. <lb/>The data House (popularly know by pupils as &quot; the brain &quot; ) contains the school&apos;s information and <lb/>communications technology needs and resources in one purpose-built space, conceived by the artist <lb/>as a crash-landed spaceship. <lb/>The Book House (library) is linked on a Pythagorean axis to the data house and explores the architecture <lb/>of complex geometry. <lb/></body>

			<body>The art House is a studio space dedicated to the Arts. The interior is fitted out in robust materials <lb/>able to withstand the rigours of school life. This space is not intended to be precious but to serve for <lb/>experimentation. <lb/>The fitness House is a well-equipped fitness room, specifically designed for children under 16 years. It <lb/>provides an environment in which pupils can focus on preparation for physical activity and learn how <lb/>their bodies perform. <lb/>Sports hall/auditorium <lb/>A high level of community use was planned for the sports hall/auditorium, resulting in the provision <lb/>of facilities at Dalry Primary that in the past would not have been justified. The sports hall has been <lb/>designed to accommodate international competition-standard events. <lb/>The design is inclusive, with features suitable for the pupils and, outside school hours, the wider community. <lb/>As these spaces have a number of uses and users, flexibility is essential. Retractable seating located within <lb/>the sports hall/auditorium accommodates an audience of 264 people, combined with a permanent tiered <lb/>viewing area located at the first floor, which raises the number to 496. This arrangement allows the space <lb/>to be used for a wider range of functions including full school assemblies, theatre, dance, conferences, <lb/>lectures, business events, film showings, concerts, conferences and sporting events. <lb/>ICT facilities <lb/>The &quot; Book House &quot; <lb/>Sports hall/auditorium <lb/>PEB Exchange 2008/15 – ISSN 1609-7548 – © OECD 2008 <lb/>Dalry Primary – An Innovative Scottish Case Study <lb/>An innovative solution to the storage requirements of loose sports equipment was to include three <lb/>underground retractable platforms with mesh walls, the roof of which can be utilised as a raised stage. <lb/>Situated on the northern external wall, these units can be operated at the control panel situated in the <lb/>recessed housing adjacent to each unit or by remote control. <lb/>restaurant <lb/>The double height restaurant is located within the main entrance to the school and is overlooked by the <lb/>entrance gallery. The north facing wall benefits from natural daylight from full-height glazing arranged <lb/>in a bar code pattern, the top section incorporating artwork designed to read &quot; Dalry Primary School &quot; . <lb/>The location of the restaurant was chosen to encourage use as an extension of the activity area, class <lb/>base area and library area. The surfaces and space are designed to allow children to take resources and <lb/>books to continue work in an alternative area. This arrangement permits the space to be used for a wider <lb/>range of functions, from an informal meeting space to community use outside school hours, to chess <lb/>tournaments and aerobic activities undertaken with other schools. <lb/>Materials <lb/>A number of materials were employed to present a variety of textures – insulated metal panels, render, <lb/>roughcast glazed brick and facing brick. To add warmth and visual interest, metallic gold insulated <lb/>panels together with cedar lining were introduced. <lb/>Internal walls are predominately stud partitions finished in a variety of materials offering a stimulating <lb/>and visually rich interior. Floor coverings are a mix of vinyl (safety vinyl in general areas) with carpet <lb/>in offices. A steel polyester powder coated trapezoidal insulated roof panel covers the building. The <lb/>external fabric is conceived as an educational instrument, panels sized to allow the building to be used <lb/>as an instrument of measure and a teaching aid. <lb/>External materials <lb/>© OECD 2008 – ISSN 1609-7548 – PEB Exchange 2008/15 <lb/>Dalry Primary – An Innovative Scottish Case Study <lb/>VIewpoIntS <lb/>Users&apos; perspective <lb/>Dalry Primary&apos;s concepts and designs were not arrived at arbitrarily; the school community was a key <lb/>part of the design process. Extended workshops were organised with pupils, staff and consultants using <lb/>drama, visual arts, film, and discussion to explore how existing spaces were used, what accommodation <lb/>the school should contain and how it would work. During the workshops, pupils had clear ideas on <lb/>areas that are particularly important to them, focusing on toilets and spaces within which to socialise, <lb/>as well as colour, shape and even sounds of the school environment. <lb/>Pupils have been pleased with the building since it opened in August 2007. While acknowledging the <lb/>improvements made on more fundamental things such as the individual toilets and access to individual <lb/>lockers, pupils also enjoy the innovative and unusual parts of the school like the soft, tactile balloon <lb/>material which forms &quot; the brain &quot; . <lb/> &quot; The brain &quot; is one of their favourite spaces, along with the library area and the sports facilities. Physical <lb/>education should be adventurous and engaging, and children at Dalry show expressions of joy, adventure <lb/>and achievement when using their sports facilities. <lb/>The pupils like the reposition of the new school adjacent to the new nursery, permiting them to see <lb/>their younger brothers and sisters in the playground during breaktimes. Many pupils are also fond of <lb/>the outside garden, which gives panoramic views of the surrounding areas and allows the freedom to <lb/>learn outdoors. <lb/>The teachers especially appreciate the breakout spaces outside the class bases that can be used for <lb/>project work or quiet time with pupils. <lb/>client&apos;s perspective <lb/>The aim of the project was to transcend accepted functionality and to stimulate the child&apos;s imagination. <lb/>It was therefore necessary to reasonably question every aspect currently employed in school design and <lb/>to state or restate the true aims and purposes of a primary school. To this end the concept of imbedded <lb/>intelligence was adopted. <lb/>Imbedded intelligence refers to the implicit information that any structure contains: weight, material, <lb/>construction, power requirements, etc. This information is made visible through a variety of means, and <lb/>whilst it may not lead to an instant understanding of how and why the built form has been fabricated in <lb/>such a way, it is available as a learning/teaching aid. <lb/>Other ideas or thoughts are superimposed on the fabric in the form of text, numbers, colour, form, <lb/>geometry and texture. Thus architecture as a learning resource illustrates philosophies, theories and <lb/>ideas, and inspires curiosity. <lb/>design team&apos;s perspective <lb/>The architect and artist on the design team were given latitude to work within and expand upon the themes <lb/>provided by the client, to present ideas and explore the possibilities of a new architecture of learning. <lb/>As witnessed at Dalry (and other North Ayrshire projects at Beith, Lawthorn and Mayfield Primary <lb/>Schools), the decorative impact of art can have far-reaching consequences and rapidly become an <lb/>integral element in a project. <lb/></body>

			<body>Art and architecture are different. It is this difference that creates ideas, while trying to smooth the <lb/>difference results in blandness. Artists discover the nature of the work in making it. In architecture the <lb/>work has to formalise fairly early on in the design process. Artists respond to architectural spaces every <lb/>time they install work or enter into a dialogue relating to context; architects benefit too. <lb/>Semi-open plan with shared breakout space <lb/>View of &quot; the brain &quot; from corridor <lb/>© OECD 2008 – ISSN 1609-7548 – PEB Exchange 2008/15 <lb/>Dalry Primary – An Innovative Scottish Case Study <lb/>Lessons Learned <lb/>North Ayrshire Council stress the importance of risk-taking without accepting failure, and to learn from <lb/>mistakes. <lb/>What lessons have been learned from the collaboration between artists and architects, and what should <lb/>they bear in mind when embarking on future ventures? <lb/>• Artists and architects should collaborate from the inception of the project. Only then will the structure <lb/>and artwork mesh organically.<lb/>• It is important that original ideas are never compromised, and if the logistics of the project are thrashed <lb/>out at an early stage then this can be avoided.<lb/>• Concern exists over the quality of the artists&apos; involvement, as their work tends to be carried out in <lb/>isolation. In addition many contractors tend to find some of the specifications bizarre when presented <lb/>with a medium in which they are unfamiliar.<lb/>• Artwork needs to be installed at the same time as the buildings are erected to ensure that all details <lb/>are properly incorporated.<lb/>• Art has a tremendously valuable role in animating architectural spaces – making them exciting and <lb/>dynamic.<lb/>The council also stress that for future projects the orientation of and relationship between the internal <lb/>and external areas should receive high consideration. They wish to maximise potential for learning and <lb/>teaching outdoors in fair weather, feeling it will be necessary in the future to develop external planning <lb/>which makes allowances for hard and soft landscaped formal playing areas, as well as areas of natural <lb/>and constructed landscape to benefit exploration. <lb/>The Dalry project includes an evaluation programme after five years&apos; use, designed to inform and extend <lb/>future developments. Given the project&apos;s innovative and experimental nature, as well as its potential <lb/>impact on the wider field of educational design, it is important to study the long-term uses and <lb/>effects of the design and to share them with a larger audience. <lb/>For more information, visit www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Education/Schools/Buildings/CaseStudies <lb/>or contact: <lb/>Malcolm Summers <lb/>School Estate Team <lb/>Schools Directorate <lb/>Scottish Government <lb/>2D – South, Victoria Quay <lb/>Edinburgh <lb/>EH6 6QQ, United Kingdom <lb/>Tel.: 44 131 244 0373 <lb/>E-mail: Malcolm.Summers@scotland.gsi.gov.uk <lb/>ORGANISATION FOR ECONOMIC CO-OPERATION <lb/>AND DEVELOPMENT <lb/>The OECD is a unique forum where the governments of 30 democracies work together to <lb/>address the economic, social and environmental challenges of globalisation.
