			<head>ABSTRACT<lb/></head>

			<p>This paper looks at how the income distribution in countries changes when the value of publicly-provided<lb/> services to households is included. We consider five major categories of public services: education, health<lb/> care, social housing, childcare and elderly care. On average across OECD countries, spending on these &quot; in-<lb/>kind &quot; benefits accounts for about 13% of GDP, slightly more than the spending on cash transfers – but<lb/> with considerable cross-country variation. Broadening the income concept to account for in-kind benefits<lb/> considerably increases households &quot; economic resources: in a typical OECD country, the average annual<lb/> household income would be close to USD 28 000, rather than USD 22 000 in purchasing power parities.<lb/> But public services also contribute to reducing income inequality, by between one-fifth and one-third<lb/> depending on the inequality measure. Mexico and, according to most inequality measures, the United<lb/> States, Portugal, Ireland, and the United Kingdom record higher reduction rates, while Slovenia records<lb/> lower ones. Across all countries, redistributive effects are stronger among specific population groups at<lb/> higher risk of poverty. Between 2000 and 2007, the redistributive impact of public services remained stable<lb/> overall. However, the impact became stronger in countries where the share of services in household<lb/> income increased significantly, while it weakened in those countries where this share decreased. The paper<lb/> suggests that publicly provided services fulfil an important direct redistributive role in OECD countries.<lb/></p>

			<head>RÉSUMÉ<lb/></head>

			<figure>Ce document examine la façon dont la distribution des revenus varie dans les pays lorsque la valeur des<lb/> services publics fournis aux ménages est inclue. L&apos;imputation de la valeur de ces services dans les revenus<lb/> des ménages et l&apos;analyse de leur potentiel redistributif posent des défis méthodologiques importants, tels<lb/> que l &quot; estimation et l &quot; allocation de ces services aux bénéficiaires, ou l&apos;ajustement de l&apos;échelle d&apos;équivalence<lb/> aux besoins associés à ces services. Nous présentons des analyses de sensibilité, en utilisant deux<lb/> approches innovatrices mises en avant dans la littérature. Le document considère cinq grandes catégories<lb/> de services publics: éducation, santé, logement social, garde d&apos;enfants et soins aux personnes âgées. En<lb/> moyenne, dans les pays de l&apos;OCDE, les dépenses relatives à ces prestations «en nature» s &quot; élèvent à environ<lb/> 13% du PIB, soit légèrement plus que les dépenses relatives aux transferts en espèces-mais avec beaucoup<lb/> variations entre pays. Elargir le concept de revenu pour tenir compte des avantages « en nature » augmente<lb/> considérablement les ressources économiques des ménages: dans un pays typique de l&apos;OCDE, le revenu<lb/> annuel moyen des ménages serait proche de 28 000 USD, plutôt que 22 000 USD en parité de pouvoir<lb/> d &quot; achat. Mais les services publics contribuent également à réduire l&apos;inégalité de revenus, d &quot; un cinquième à<lb/> un tiers en fonction de la mesure d &quot; inégalité. Le Mexique et, selon la plupart des mesures d &quot; inégalités, les<lb/> États-Unis, le Portugal, l&apos;Irlande et le Royaume-Uni enregistrent des taux de réduction plus élevés, tandis<lb/> que la Slovénie enregistre des taux de réduction plus faibles. Dans tous les pays, les effets redistributifs<lb/> sont plus forts parmi les groupes de population spécifiques à risque de pauvreté plus élevé. Entre 2000 et<lb/> 2007, l&apos;impact redistributif des services publics est resté globalement stable. Toutefois, l&apos;impact est devenu<lb/> plus fort dans les pays où la part des services dans les revenus des ménages a augmenté de manière<lb/> significative, alors qu&apos;il s &quot; est affaibli dans les pays où cette part a diminué. Le document suggère que les<lb/> services publics remplissent un rôle de redistribution directe important dans les pays de l&apos;OCDE.<lb/></figure>

			<head>...................................................... 12<lb/> 1.<lb/> INTRODUCTION<lb/></head>

			<p>1.<lb/> The economic well-being of households is determined, to a large extent, by households &quot;<lb/> disposable cash income. Cash incomes, however, exclude a range of flows that affect a household &quot; s<lb/> consumption possibilities and their capacity to attend to their needs. These include services provided by<lb/> firms as well as other resources such as time and home production that contribute to households &quot; living<lb/> standards and their capacity to attend to their needs. Among the most important factors which are omitted<lb/> from the &quot; standard &quot; accounting framework are government activities that impact on household well-being<lb/> through the in-kind services they provide.<lb/> 2.<lb/> Recently, the Commission on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress<lb/> led by Joseph Stiglitz, Amartya Sen and Jean-Paul Fitoussi published its final report examining measures<lb/> of well-being (www.stiglitz-sen-fitoussi.fr). One of its recommendations is that household income should<lb/> reflect in-kind services provided by the government, such as subsidized health care and educational<lb/> services.<lb/></p>

			<p>3.<lb/> In addition to influencing the overall economic well-being of households, publicly provided<lb/> services also impact on the distribution of resources across households and it can be expected that this<lb/> impact is not the same across countries. Recent years have therefore seen an increasing academic literature<lb/> on the distributive implications of publicly-provided services (see <ref type="biblio">Marical et al. 2006 &amp; 2008, OECD,<lb/> 2008a; Sutherland and Tsakloglou, 2009; Tsakloglou et al., 2009 and Vaalavuo, 2010</ref>).<lb/> 4.<lb/> Most of the available comparative empirical evidence on levels and trends in income inequalities<lb/> and poverty in OECD countries relies on the concept of household disposable cash income, thus ignoring<lb/> the services governments provide to households. Including those services matters a lot, however, for policy<lb/> interpretation. 1 First, some countries rely more on in-kind benefits rather than cash transfers. When, for<lb/> instance, country A heavily subsidizes education, whereas country B primarily relies on private schools<lb/> funded by fees, this difference will not show up in traditional income distribution statistics, even though<lb/> the financial implications for the households in the two countries will differ considerably. Second,<lb/> households see their income reduced due to taxes, so it is important to account for the benefits of the<lb/> services that are funded through taxes<lb/> 5.<lb/> The volume of publicly-provided services – health, education and family services as well as<lb/> social services for elderly, survivors, disabled persons, unemployed and those in respect of housing and<lb/> social assistance – varies considerably across countries (<ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>). For the most recent available year, these<lb/> services constitute about 13% of GDP on average across the 34 OECD countries, ranging from close to 8%<lb/> in Turkey and Chile to 20% in Denmark and Sweden. On average, health care and education services<lb/> account for 5 to 6 percentage points each. The remaining 2% are made up mainly of care services for<lb/> children and the elderly; the latter are particularly important in the Nordic countries, Australia and Japan<lb/> where they exceed 1% of GDP.<lb/> 1<lb/> A growing number of government studies in OECD countries include the effect of services in their regular<lb/> reports on the distributional impact of policies. An example is the United Kingdom &quot; s Spending Review<lb/> carried out by HM treasury, see http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/spend_sr2010_impact_households.htm<lb/> 6.<lb/> On OECD average, more spending goes to these services than to cash transfers which amount to<lb/> 11% of GDP on average. This is because in some countries, the relative share of services is considerably<lb/> higher. This is particularly the case in Mexico, Korea, Iceland, Canada and the United States. By contrast,<lb/> services play a less important role than cash transfers in many EU countries, and particularly so in Austria,<lb/> Italy and Poland.<lb/></p>

			<p>(b) Cash transfers to the elderly, survivors, disabled persons, families, unemployed, as well as those in respect of social assistance.<lb/> Source: OECD Social Expenditure database, OECD Education database, OECD Health database.<lb/> 7.<lb/> How does inequality change once publicly-provided services are taken into account? In a first<lb/> analysis OECD (2008a) found that education, health care and social housing significantly lowered income<lb/> inequality was on measures for a year around 2000 in 17 OECD countries (about one quarter on average).<lb/> But public services typically reduced inequality by less than cash transfers were able to do, which amounts<lb/> to a reduction of about one third. Another finding was that differences between countries in inequality were<lb/> somewhat lower once public services are taken into account than when comparing only cash incomes.<lb/> These results highlighted the importance of taking account of this redistributive impact when making<lb/> policy choices about these programmes.<lb/> 8.<lb/> The present study goes beyond these preliminary analyses in several ways. First, it includes ten<lb/> additional OECD countries and up-dates the estimates to the late 2000s, thus revealing changes in the<lb/> distributive impact of services since the early 2000s. Second, it considers additional public services, in<lb/> particular care for children and the elderly and the distributive impact of specific policies on specific<lb/> groups of the population. Third, it analyses also the effects on low-income households and poverty<lb/> specifically. Finally, the chapter also reports some estimates based on alternative and recently developed<lb/> methods to impute services into household income.<lb/> 9.<lb/> Considering the influence of government services on the distribution of household income<lb/> requires broadening the definition of household income, from the more narrow concept of disposable<lb/></p>

Incorporating the value of<lb/> government services in household income raises a range of questions, some of which are conceptual, and<lb/> others are methodological (see e.g. Marical et al. 2006; Garfinkel et al. 2006; OECD 2008a; Aaberge et al.<lb/> 2010a; Paulus et al., 2010), in particular:<lb/> a) Which of the government services should be included for the analysis of the impact on poverty?<lb/> b) How to value public services?<lb/> c) How to allocate the value of government services among individuals and households?<lb/></table>

			<p>d) Can the same equivalence scale be used for cash and non-cash incomes, or does the inclusion of<lb/> non-cash incomes require a different approach?<lb/> 10.<lb/> Chapter 2 below considers question a) and provides a definition and overview of public services<lb/> to households and its characteristics. Apart from the three services that have been traditionally considered<lb/> when including in-kind benefits (namely education, health care and social housing), also three other<lb/> categories are discussed, i.e. services for early childhood education and childcare, long-term elderly care<lb/> services, and subsidies for public transport and public utilities 3 .<lb/> 11.<lb/> Chapter 3 discusses the remaining three of the above questions, questions b) through d).<lb/> Compared to OECD (2008a) a more refined methodology is presented for estimating the value of social<lb/> housing for its beneficiaries. Also, valuation and allocation methods for early childhood education and<lb/> childcare services and long-term elderly care services are proposed. Further, this chapter addresses<lb/> methodological and conceptual issues in choosing an appropriate equivalence scale for in-kind benefits.<lb/> The use of the &quot; traditional &quot; cash income equivalence scale is compared with that of two innovative<lb/> approaches that have recently been developed in the literature to account for the differences in needs<lb/> between cash and in-kind income. Chapter 3 also proposes an alternative indicator for capturing the<lb/> possible poverty impact of public services.<lb/> 12.<lb/> On the basis of these methodological choices, Chapter 4 presents the empirical results for the<lb/> distributive effects of services, based on micro data from EU-SILC, LIS and HILDA, as well as other<lb/> available OECD and EU data. Chapter 5 concludes.<lb/></p>

			<head>2<lb/></head>

			<p>The value of home production is not considered in this paper, neither the value of in-kind benefits from<lb/> private sources. A recent discussion of the value of home production based on time use surveys can be<lb/> found in Miranda (2011).<lb/></p>

			<head>2.<lb/> OVERVIEW OF SOCIAL PUBLIC SERVICES: DEFINITION AND IMPORTANCE<lb/></head>

			<p>13.<lb/> The focus here is on public social expenditures<lb/> 4 , which are social spending flows controlled by<lb/> General Government (i.e. different levels of government and social security funds), thus excluding pure<lb/> public goods, like national defence and justice<lb/> 5 . Hence, it involves only those expenditures that can be<lb/> attributed to an individual beneficiary and that are excludable. Public education and health care<lb/> expenditures are by far the two major categories of this kind of expenditures, as illustrated in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>.<lb/> 14.<lb/> In all OECD countries except Estonia, Iceland, Israel, Korea, Mexico and Turkey, public health<lb/> care services form the most important category of public services to households (see <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>). On<lb/> average, public spending on health care services amounts to around 6% of GDP, constituting the largest<lb/> part of total health spending of around 9% of GDP (OECD Health Data). Total health spending is by far<lb/> highest in the United States, with more than half accounted for by private health spending. Among<lb/> European countries, France, Germany, Austria and Belgium are the countries with the highest levels of<lb/> overall spending on health care (in excess of 10%), whereas Estonia, Poland and the Czech Republic spend<lb/> the least (below 7%). Differences across countries are also substantial when only public expenditures are<lb/> considered, ranging from 2.6% (Mexico) to almost 8% (Germany and France).<lb/> 15.<lb/> Public investment in education is also considerable. The highest education expenditures of more<lb/> than 6% of GDP are found in the Nordic countries and in Belgium. Lower levels are found in the Slovak<lb/> Republic, Japan and Luxembourg 6 . In all countries, primary to below-tertiary education make up by far the<lb/> largest share of public education expenditures (OECD 2010), while tertiary education accounts for more<lb/> than 1% in most countries.<lb/> 16.<lb/> While cash housing benefits are generally included in household disposable income, the effect of<lb/> social housing is not accounted for. This may provide a misleading picture of the impact of overall housing<lb/> policies on inequality and poverty, as some countries use different policies to help households meet their<lb/> housing expenses (<ref type="biblio">Gardiner et al., 1995; Whitehead and Scanlon 2007</ref>). Unfortunately, no internationally<lb/> comparative estimates of the relative level of social housing as a share of GDP are available. The scale of<lb/> social housing and the conditions of access vary considerably across countries, with relatively high shares<lb/> (almost 20% of total housing) in countries like the Czech Republic, the United Kingdom, Denmark, France<lb/> and the Netherlands (CECODHAS, http://www.cecodhas.org/; <ref type="biblio">Whitehead and Scanlon, 2007</ref>). Also<lb/> conditions of access to social housing vary considerably from one country to another. In the Netherlands<lb/> and Sweden, access to social housing is not explicitly linked to individuals &quot; resources, while Belgium and<lb/> Germany, for example, means-test access to social housing (<ref type="biblio">Andrews et al., 2011</ref>).<lb/> 17.<lb/> Services to families refer largely to Early Childhood Education and Childcare (ECEC). Access<lb/> to affordable childcare is one of the key elements of strategies to reconcile work and family life, promote<lb/> 4<lb/></p>

			<p>Social expenditure are defined as &quot; the provision by public and private institutions of benefits to, and<lb/> financial contributions targeted at, households and individuals in order to provide support during<lb/> circumstances which adversely affect their welfare, provided that the provision of the benefits and financial<lb/> contributions constitutes neither a direct payment for a particular good or service nor an individual contract<lb/> or transfer. &quot; (<ref type="biblio">Adema &amp; Ladaique, 2009)<lb/></ref> 5<lb/></p>

			<p>Though part of these expenditures may have an explicit social aim and can be attributed to a specific<lb/> individual beneficiary, as for instance in the case of free legal support.<lb/></p>

			<p>The spending level in Luxembourg does not include tertiary education.<lb/> equal opportunities and combat social exclusion (<ref type="biblio">Matsaganis and Verbist 2009; OECD 2011a</ref>). Limited<lb/> and unequal access to childcare services perpetuates social inequalities, whereas investment in early<lb/> education can protect children from further social disadvantages and contribute to more equality. With 1%<lb/> or more of GDP, these services are important in all Nordic countries, as well as in France, Hungary and the<lb/> United Kingdom (see <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>). Pre-primary education is a more important category than childcare in most<lb/> countries (OECD, Family Database). In countries with high enrolment rates in formal care for under 3 year<lb/> old, public spending on childcare is accordingly high. This is notably the case in the</p>

			<table>Nordic countries,<lb/> France and the United Kingdom.<lb/> 18.<lb/> Elderly care has emerged as a major social policy concern in OECD countries more recently<lb/> (Österle 2002; OECD 2005b and 2011b; Da Roit et al. 2007; European Commission 2006; Pavolini and<lb/> Ranci 2008). The proportion of GDP spent on long-term care is estimated to at least double and possibly<lb/> triple by 2050 (OECD 2005b; Comas<ref type="biblio">-Herrera et al. 2006</ref>). More than two thirds of the people aged over 70<lb/> years are expected to need help in performing at least one or two daily routines (<ref type="biblio">Eurofound 2006; WHO<lb/> 2008</ref>). Public expenditures on services for the elderly vary between 0.1 per cent of GDP in Estonia and 2.5<lb/> per cent in the Netherlands (<ref type="biblio">Huber et al. 2009</ref>). The variation in expenditure levels is substantially greater<lb/> than for other public spending, such as health care (see also</p>

			<table>Jensen 2008). According to estimates by the<lb/> European Union (EC 2006), public spending on long-term care will increase by around 1 percentage point<lb/> between 2004 and 2050 in most member states, and by over 2 percentage points in Finland, Sweden and<lb/> Slovenia due to their more developed formal care system.<lb/></table>

			<head>Box 1. Other services: public transport subsidies and public utilities<lb/></head>

			<p>Apart from the public social services discussed above, other policy domains of public services have a specific<lb/> social aim, as they involve interpersonal redistribution and may affect the standard of living of households and<lb/> individuals. Major examples are subsidies for public transportation, as well as support for energy costs and other<lb/> utilities. Note that these services are not included in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>, as national estimates for these categories are rare.<lb/> Subsidies on public transport basically have an economic efficiency rationale (<ref type="biblio">Parry &amp; Small, 2009</ref>). This<lb/> means that economies of scale imply that the marginal cost of supplying mobility is less than the average cost.<lb/> Moreover, by stimulating the use of public transport private car use and related negative externalities may be<lb/> reduced. But apart from this efficiency rationale, social arguments play a role, namely that these subsidies intend to<lb/> make mobility more affordable, especially to low-income groups.<lb/></p>

			<p>Most research on the effect of public transport subsidies has focused on the economic efficiency reasons,<lb/> thereby largely ignoring distributive aspects. These aspects can be direct, by reducing the financial cost of mobility or<lb/> indirect, by increasing the labour market opportunities of the beneficiaries. Most of existing research is on urban<lb/> public transport. A number of studies investigate the pro-poorness of public transport subsidies. These studies deal<lb/> in general with a confined geographical area, such as large cities. Recent research includes <ref type="biblio">Asensio et al. (2003)</ref>,<lb/> Carruthers, Dick and Saurkar (2005) and <ref type="biblio">Estupiñán et al. (2007). Fearnley (2006) and Jones (2008)</ref> are among the<lb/> rare studies that provide national estimates, both for the United Kingdom. They find that public transport subsidies<lb/> appear to make the poorest better off, though there is variation by mode of transportation (e.g. bus travel subsidies<lb/> turned out be more pro-poor than those for rail transport) as well as by geographical location.<lb/></p>

			<p>Apart from public transport, also utilities like energy and communication services are provided by the<lb/> government to the public at below-market prices, or entail provisions for low-income or other target groups. <ref type="biblio">Nolan<lb/> and Russel (2001)</ref> for instance investigate the distributive effect of the so-called &quot; free schemes &quot; (for electricity/gas,<lb/> TV license, telephone rental, and free travel) and the Medical Card in Ireland and find that these free schemes are<lb/> more beneficial to the lower income groups, hence reducing inequality and relative poverty (the latter by about one<lb/> fifth). The possible redistributive impact of benefits that are associated specifically with energy provisions is likely to<lb/> become an important policy issue in the future, given the importance of climate change and evolutions of energy<lb/> prices. Many national programmes to subsidise energy use have broadly two aims: first aim, to ensure affordable<lb/> energy (electricity, gas, fuel) for low-income and other vulnerable groups; second, and more recently, to stimulate the<lb/> use of renewable energy sources.<lb/></p>

			<head>3.<lb/> HOW TO ACCOUNT FOR PUBLICLY PROVIDED SERVICES IN HOUSEHOLD<lb/> INCOME: CONCEPTUAL ISSUES AND METHODOLOGY<lb/></head>

			<p>19.<lb/> Including publicly-provided services in the analysis of inequality raises a number of conceptual<lb/> and methodological issues, since the value of government services needs to be incorporated into individual<lb/> household incomes and &quot; extended income &quot; needs to be estimated. The first section of this chapter briefly<lb/> presents the data used for the empirical analysis in this project. In the second section, the issue of how to<lb/> value and allocate publicly provided services is addressed in general terms. The subsequent sections<lb/> describe which methods have been applied to value and allocate services for the five major categories:<lb/> education, health care, social housing, early childhood education and long-term elderly care services,<lb/> respectively. A separate section is devoted to the complex issue of adjusting the equivalence scale for the<lb/> needs associated with public services and presents two recently published innovative methodologies. The<lb/> final section presents and discusses the indicators for estimating the poverty alleviation of public services,<lb/> including an alternative indicator which looks at the poverty reduction potential of services.<lb/></p>

			<head>3.1 Data<lb/></head>

			<p>20.<lb/> The empirical analyses in this project are carried out on 2007 micro data from the European<lb/> Union Survey on Income and Living Conditions (EU SILC) which is available for 24 EU countries as well<lb/> as for Iceland and Norway. The income reference period is 2006. For Australia, the 2007 wave of<lb/> Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) was used, and calculations for Canada,<lb/> Mexico and the United States are performed using data from the Luxembourg Income Study, referring to<lb/> the income year 2004.<lb/> 21.<lb/> Estimates of the value of public services are derived from various sources, in particular the<lb/> OECD Social Expenditure Database (www.oecd.org/els/social/expenditure). For education, the OECD<lb/> Education Online Database was used. For health care, age profiles available from the European<lb/> Commission and the Economic Policy Committee (2009) and from OECD (2006) were used. For social<lb/> housing, the monetary benefit that stems from free or reduced rent housing was estimated by applying<lb/> regression analyses on the micro data of EU-SILC. For child and elderly care, data come from various<lb/> national sources, which are described in the Annex 2.<lb/></p>

			<head>3.2 How to value public services and allocate those to individuals and households?<lb/></head>

			<p>22.<lb/> The standard way to estimate the monetary value of public services is to use a production cost<lb/> approach (see <ref type="biblio">Aaberge and Langørgen, 2006; Marical et al., 2008; Smeeding et al., 1993</ref>). This means that<lb/> the transfer to the beneficiaries is assumed to equal the average cost of providing or producing these public<lb/> services. In other words, one USD spent on services in assumed to equal one USD worth to households or<lb/> individuals. It is important to note that this approach neglects differences within and across countries in the<lb/> quality and efficiency in the provision of these services. Moreover, this approach does not necessarily<lb/> reflect the user &quot; s value of the service, as the public service cannot (easily) be exchanged for other goods.<lb/> For all the services studied in this paper, the production cost is used, with the exception of social housing,<lb/> where the value of the benefit is derived from prevailing market rents.<lb/> 23.<lb/> A second issue is how to allocate these benefits across the population. In the literature two<lb/> approaches have been distinguished, namely the &quot; actual consumption approach &quot; and the &quot; insurance value<lb/> approach &quot; (see e.g. <ref type="biblio">Marical et al., 2008</ref>). The actual consumption approach allocates the value of public<lb/> services to the individuals that are actually using the service. For most services, the actual consumption<lb/> approach will be the most appropriate, if actual beneficiaries can be identified. In some cases an insurance<lb/> value approach may be applicable or even preferable. Such an approach imputes the &quot; insurance value &quot; of<lb/> coverage to each person based on specific characteristics (such as age, sex, socio-economic position). For<lb/> instance, in much of the literature the actual consumption approach is considered to be less appropriate in<lb/> the case of health care, as it ignores the greater needs that are associated with being ill. Hence, the<lb/> insurance value approach is preferred. <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> summarises which of the two approaches are proposed for<lb/> nine different service categories, and which have been used for the five services in this study.<lb/></p>

			<head>3.3 The allocation of education services: actual use approach<lb/></head>

			<p>24.<lb/> The standard method in the literature to include benefits that households derive from education<lb/> services is the actual use approach (see e.g. <ref type="biblio">Antoninis and Tsakloglou, 2001; Garfinkel et al., 2006; Callan<lb/> et al., 2008</ref>). This means that the beneficiaries of education are the pupils and students that are currently<lb/> using these services. Actual participation is largely determined by age, but also by other factors, such as<lb/> individuals &quot; social background and income. In principle, all individuals of compulsory school age benefit<lb/> from education, which makes the approach to allocate public expenditure based on age for this group a<lb/> priori justifiable 7 . Social background plays a more important role for participation in other education<lb/> levels, such as pre-primary education and tertiary education; hence, actual participation should be<lb/> considered. Enrolment rates are almost universal for children aged 5 to 14 and relatively high for<lb/> individuals aged 15 to 19: the average in the OECD is 82% with lower rates in e.g. Turkey (46%) and<lb/> Mexico (52%) and higher rates in Belgium (92%), Poland (93%) and Slovenia (91%). For the older groups<lb/> 7<lb/></p>

			<p>The starting age of compulsory education is 6 in most countries, whereas some countries start earlier at age<lb/> 5 (Hungary, Mexico, the Netherlands, New Zealand and the United Kingdom), and others at age 7<lb/> (Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Poland and Sweden) (see OECD 2010). Ending age of compulsory education<lb/> varies between 14 and 18 years. 90% of the population are enrolled in education for at least 13 years,<lb/> ranging from 11 (e.g. Greece) to 15 years (Belgium, France, Norway and Sweden). A small minority of<lb/> children (often from disadvantaged background) do not attend school at this age. According to OECD<lb/> (2008b), 1.5% of children aged between 5 and 14 are not enrolled in school, on average across OECD<lb/> countries.<lb/></p>

			<p>(20 to 29 year old), enrolment rates are much lower, ranging from less than 10% in Luxembourg (where<lb/> most higher education students study abroad) to 43% in Finland.<lb/> 25.<lb/> Information on actual participation in different types of education is in general available in the<lb/> databases used for individuals aged 16 or older. For younger individuals, age is used to determine<lb/> participation 8 . No distinction could be made in the surveys between participation in publicly or privately<lb/> funded education institutions 9 , nor between general and technical secondary education, nor between Type<lb/> A and Type B tertiary education 10 ; hence, these breakdowns could not be applied either. The breakdown<lb/> applied in this paper refers to the revised International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED-97):<lb/> pre-primary 11 , primary, lower secondary, upper secondary, post-secondary non-tertiary and tertiary<lb/> education.<lb/> 26.<lb/> Each pupil or student that participates in a publicly funded education institution is assigned a<lb/> public education transfer that equals the cost of producing these services in the corresponding level of<lb/> education, according to National Accounts data. Public educational expenditure refers to total direct<lb/> government expenditures for educational institutions per education level, converted to a &apos;per student&apos; basis<lb/> through data on the number of students in each level. These data are obtained from the OECD Education<lb/> Database for OECD countries, which distinguishes per student expenditures for pre-primary, primary,<lb/> lower-secondary, upper-secondary, post-secondary non-tertiary and tertiary education. For tertiary<lb/> education, direct expenditures for research and development activities are excluded, as they do not have<lb/> education as their primary aim (even though there are of course indirect benefits from R&amp;D towards<lb/> students). All education expenditure amounts are imputed to the identified beneficiaries and then added to<lb/> the income of the households where they live, by average public spending per student at the relevant<lb/> educational level.<lb/></p>

			<head>3.4 The allocation of health care services: insurance-value approach<lb/></head>

			<p>27.<lb/> Health care is one of the largest government expenditure items. In order to estimate the<lb/> distributive effects of public health care services in this study, household incomes are increased by the<lb/> imputed monetary value of public health care services. Two main approaches can be distinguished to<lb/> attribute to individuals the benefits from public health care services and have been applied empirically,<lb/> namely the actual consumption approach on the one hand and the insurance-value approach on the other.<lb/> 28.<lb/> Studies that use the actual consumption approach base their analyses on detailed data on the<lb/> effective use of health care services by individuals (see e.g. <ref type="biblio">Evandrou et al. (1993) and Sefton (2002)</ref> for<lb/> the UK); they concluded that public health care expenditures lower income inequality. This approach is,<lb/> however, only feasible if information is available on the actual use of health care services, which is often<lb/> 8<lb/></p>

			<p>The probability of participating in a specific education level is derived from net enrolment rates by single<lb/> year of age presented in Education at a Glance. Information on actual use of pre-primary education is used<lb/> when available in the survey.<lb/></p>

			<head>9<lb/></head>

			<p>Enrolment in private schools may lead to an underestimation of the poverty impact of public education<lb/> services if these students are mainly from better-off families and if public subsidies to private schools are<lb/> lower than the costs of public schools.<lb/></p>

			<head>10<lb/></head>

			<p>Tertiary-type A programmes (ISCED 5A) are largely theory-based and are designed to provide sufficient<lb/> qualifications for entry to advanced research programmes and professions with high skill requirements,<lb/> such as medicine, dentistry or architecture. Tertiary-type B programmes (ISCED 5B) are typically shorter<lb/> than those of tertiary-type A and focus on practical, technical or occupational skills for direct entry into the<lb/> labour market.<lb/> lacking in income surveys. In addition, a fundamental critique often raised against the actual use approach<lb/> is that it ignores the greater needs that are associated with being ill, in the absence of an equivalence scale<lb/> that adjusts for health status (see e.g. <ref type="biblio">Aaberge et al., 2006</ref>). The actual consumption approach implies that<lb/> sick people are ceteris paribus better off than healthy people because they receive more health care<lb/> services. Moreover, research has indicated that poorer people have in general worse health conditions, and<lb/> consequently greater needs for health care (see e.g. <ref type="biblio">Hernández-Quevedo et al., 2006</ref>).<lb/> 29.<lb/> As an alternative, the insurance-value approach is the most frequently used analytical method and<lb/> imputes the &quot; insurance value &quot; of coverage to each person based on specific characteristics (such as age,<lb/> sex, socio-economic position). 12 The insurance value is the amount that an insured person would have to<lb/> pay in each category (e.g. age group) so that the third-party provider (government, employer, other insurer)<lb/> would have just enough revenue to cover all claims for such persons (see <ref type="biblio">Smeeding, 1982</ref>). It is based on<lb/> the notion that what the government provides is equivalent to funding an insurance policy where the value<lb/> of the premium is the same for everybody sharing the same characteristics, such as age (<ref type="biblio">Marical et al.,<lb/> 2006</ref>). Most studies which use the insurance-value approach impute public health care expenditures on the<lb/> basis of people &quot; s age; they report a significant decrease in inequality.<lb/> 30.<lb/> These two alternative approaches can lead to different results. OECD (2008a) applies both the<lb/> insurance-value and the actual consumption approach for health expenditures to eight European countries.<lb/> On average, the distributive effect of health care expenditures turned out to be considerably lower using the<lb/> actual consumption approach than using the insurance-value approach.<lb/> 31.<lb/> However, as argued in <ref type="biblio">Smeeding et al. 2008</ref>, also the insurance value approach should take<lb/> account of differences in health care needs as the specific characteristics on which the insurance value is<lb/> based also relate to difference in needs. Hence, the authors advise to use the insurance-value approach<lb/> combined with the introduction of an equivalence scale that incorporates health care needs. From a<lb/> theoretical point of view this approach is the most appropriate, as different equivalence scales should be<lb/> used in the distribution of disposable income on the one hand and of disposable income plus the value of<lb/> health care services on the other. The logic behind this distinction is that the relative needs of individuals<lb/> belonging to particular groups are probably different for public health care services and for other<lb/> commodities paid out of cash income. Practical implementation of this approach, however, has so far not<lb/> been possible due to the absence of a set of equivalence scales that covers the entire population 13 . As the<lb/> issue of equivalence scales is crucial when studying the incorporation of services in distributive analyses, it<lb/> is discussed in more detail in section 3.8.<lb/> 32.<lb/> As the datasets contain no information on use of health care services, the actual consumption<lb/> approach cannot be applied here. Consequently, this study applies the insurance-value approach for health<lb/> care services, which means that every individual is assumed to receive a public benefit determined by the<lb/> average spending on his/her group, irrespective of whether actual use of health care services was made.<lb/> The groups are determined by age and gender. Health expenditures per age group as a percentage of GDP<lb/> per capita – so called &quot; age profiles &quot; -are available from the European Commission and the Economic<lb/> Policy <ref type="biblio">Committee (2009)</ref> for the EU countries and Norway, and from the OECD expenditure projections<lb/> for health and long-term care for Australia, Canada, Iceland, Mexico and the United States (<ref type="biblio">OECD, 2006</ref>).<lb/> Multiplying these percentages with GDP per capita of the corresponding year provides an estimate of the<lb/> 12<lb/></p>

			<p>For instance, this approach was also followed most recently by INSEE for estimating the redistributive<lb/> impact of in-kind services on the basis of National Accounts data (INSEE 2009).<lb/> insurance value of health care services for each individual. Income of the households is then increased with<lb/> these amounts 14 .<lb/> 33.<lb/> Examples of these profiles are shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref> for a selection of OECD countries. After<lb/> childhood, per capita expenditures increase with age, especially between 60 and 80 years 15 . For some<lb/> countries (e.g. Sweden and Poland) expenditure levels for the highest age groups were available (and not<lb/> grouped for all individuals aged for instance 80 or older as in the case of most countries), showing a<lb/> decline in spending levels for the oldest individuals. 16 Average levels of expenditures on women are higher<lb/> than those on men in middle age groups due to child bearing. For elder groups, men tend to display a<lb/> higher expenditure pattern.<lb/></p>

Even in health care systems with broad or universal<lb/> coverage, some elements are targeted towards low-income groups (e.g. reduced out-of-pocket payments for<lb/> hospitalisation, doctor visits etc.) and these are not accounted for in this type of imputation.<lb/> 15<lb/> It is common belief that health care costs rise steeply with age, because individuals are nearing their death,<lb/> making medical treatments more costly. Busse et al. (2002) conclude however that the relation between<lb/> health care costs and age is more complex. When hospital costs are considered, the most costly patients are<lb/> those who die young.<lb/> 16<lb/> As age is top-coded in EU-SILC at 80, the imputations undertaken in this report use the weighted average<lb/> for individuals aged 80 and over.<lb/> 17<lb/> The invaluable support of Joachim Frick and Markus Grabka (DIW – Berlin) for estimating imputed rent<lb/> for social renters is gratefully acknowledged.<lb/> 0<lb/> 5<lb/> 10<lb/> 15<lb/> 20<lb/> 25<lb/> DEU Men<lb/> DEU Women<lb/> NLD Men<lb/> NLD Women<lb/> SWE Men<lb/> SWE Women<lb/> 0<lb/> 5<lb/> 10<lb/> 15<lb/> 20<lb/> 25<lb/> CZE Men<lb/> CZE Women<lb/> ITA Men<lb/> ITA Women<lb/> POL Men<lb/> POL Women<lb/></figure>

			<p>derive from living in a publicly-provided house at lower rent, is to estimate the value of imputed rent. Due<lb/> to data availability, the effect of social housing is confined to countries in the EU-SILC database.<lb/> 35.<lb/> Three groups of potential beneficiaries of imputed rent can be identified: owner-occupiers, rent-<lb/>free tenants and tenants with below-market rent (including social housing and rent-reduction by employers<lb/> or relatives). Most work on imputed rent until now has focused on estimating the benefits owner occupiers<lb/> derive from their owning the house (e.g. Canberra <ref type="biblio">Group 2001; Frick &amp; Grabka 2003</ref>) Analogously, a<lb/> measure of imputed rent can be derived for tenants who rent in the public sector at a below-market rent.<lb/> However, very little conceptual and empirical work has been done on that issue so far.<lb/> 36.<lb/> Reduced rent tenants can include those (a) renting social housing, (b) renting at a reduced rate<lb/> from an employer and (c) those in accommodation where the actual rent is fixed by law. No differentiation<lb/> between these three types is possible on the basis of the data at hand, which may lead to an overestimation.<lb/> When the term &quot; social renter &quot; is used in the following, this refers to this category of reduced rent tenants.<lb/> 37.<lb/> A general description of the various approaches to calculate imputed rent on the basis of micro<lb/> data can be found in</p>

			<figure>Frick and Grabka (2003), Frick et al. (2006) and Frick et al. (2010). In the current<lb/> paper the opportunity cost approach is used (also known as the &quot; rental equivalence method &quot; ). Using<lb/> information from those households living in the private (non-subsidized) rental market, a rental value for<lb/> all property of tenants in the social rental sector is estimated. It is based on a hedonic regression estimation<lb/> of the logarithm of rent actually paid by main tenants on the private housing market (so excluding social<lb/> housing and any other reduced rent payments) (covariates of the regression can be found in Table A.1 in<lb/> Annex 1).<lb/> Table 2: Method used to estimate imputed rent for social renters and frequency of different categories of<lb/> tenure status (households)<lb/> Source: OECD Secretariat&apos;s computations from EU-SILC 2007.<lb/></figure>

			<p>38.<lb/> Selection bias may occur between private and reduced rent tenants, resulting from e.g. different<lb/> quality of housing between private and social renters. The selection bias is supposed to run along the<lb/> criteria for eligibility and other factors like social segregation. The selection variables used are household<lb/> income, the capacity to face unexpected financial expenses, size of the family, whether or not the family is<lb/> a lone parent (all of which can be considered as indicators for the eligibility criteria) and whether or not the<lb/> head of household has a migration background as an indicator for possible segregation. If there is selection<lb/> bias, then a two-step Heckman procedure is applied to predict the logarithm of rent.<lb/> 39.<lb/> <ref type="table">Table 2</ref> provides an overview of the number of cases of both private and social renters, as well as<lb/> which method is used in each country. In ten countries selection bias between private and social renters is<lb/> significant, and hence a Heckman selection bias correction is applied. In the other countries estimates are<lb/> derived using an OLS regression. No estimates are possible for Denmark and the Netherlands, as social<lb/> renters cannot be identified.<lb/> 40.<lb/> Next, a randomly chosen error term from the true distribution of market renters is added in order<lb/> to maintain variation in the resulting estimates of imputed rent for reduced rent tenants. This is done five<lb/> times, and hence, five different estimates of rent for reduced rent tenants are derived in order to test for the<lb/> quality of the estimation. A measure of imputed rent is derived by taking the antilog of the estimated<lb/> monthly fictitious rent, deducting from it actual rent paid.</p>

			<head>3.6 Early childhood education and childcare services (ECEC): actual use approach<lb/></head>

			<p>41.<lb/> To account for early childhood education and childcare services is the actual use approach, has<lb/> been applied, following Matsaganis and Verbist (2009). Formal care services for children below<lb/> compulsory school age can be categorized in three broad groups: 1) Centre-based day care; 2) Family day<lb/> care; 3) Pre-school education programmes (for more details, see OECD Family Database). As categories of<lb/> pre-primary education and childcare are overlapping in OECD and national data, and in some countries<lb/> there is no distinction between the two, pre-primary education is here taken into account together with<lb/> childcare in order to avoid the double counting of children using these services. It also gives a more<lb/> comparable image of services provided to children under school-age. While almost the entire age group of<lb/> 3 to 6 years-olds is often enrolled in pre-primary school, services provided to younger children (under 3<lb/> years old) are scarcer and opening hours are limited in many countries.<lb/> 42.<lb/> The beneficiaries of publicly funded ECEC services are the children and their parents that are<lb/> using these services. The value of this type of public service can thus be allocated to the child or to its<lb/> parents. If the value of the in-kind benefit is added to household income and distributed evenly over<lb/> household members, then both allocations (to parents or to children) are equivalent. If the value is,<lb/> however, only allocated to the beneficiary, then the choice between parents and child may affect<lb/> distributional results.<lb/> 43.<lb/> For an appropriate identification of beneficiaries, information on whether the user is benefiting<lb/> from subsidized care is needed, as well as on the type of childcare that is used (this is relevant in the case<lb/> where different categories are subsidised in a different way, which is in general the case), and on the<lb/> intensity of use (number of hours, or full-time or part-time). The differentiation between public and private<lb/> services is not available in the datasets used here. Consequently, in some cases public money is allocated to<lb/> people purchasing a private service. This does not introduce much bias in most countries, as private<lb/> services are rare or almost entirely subsidized by the state. But in some countries like the United Kingdom<lb/> and France, where many parents pay for private childcare and are partly reimbursed through the tax<lb/> system, this might lead to double counting of the benefits.<lb/> 44.<lb/> Amounts per user of pre-primary education are derived from the OECD Education Database,<lb/> whereas the amounts for childcare come from various national sources (Vaalavuo 2011, see Annex 2) 18 .<lb/> An hourly price is derived by dividing this benefit by average hours of use. The imputation of ECEC<lb/> transfers is based on the real use of these services by an hourly basis in order to allow for differences in the<lb/> intensity of use. Pre-primary education is free in all countries studied but in kindergartens, crèches and<lb/> other forms of day care, there are often user fees that are tied to parent &quot; s income; these payments are not<lb/> taken into account in the imputation. As fees are income dependent in almost all OECD countries (see<lb/> OECD 2007), this means that the results probably underestimate the distributive effect of ECEC subsidies.<lb/></p>

			<head>3.7 Long-term elderly care services: insurance-value approach<lb/></head>

			<p>45.<lb/> In comparison to childcare, no similar data on the use of elderly care services exists in the<lb/> datasets. Therefore, imputation is based on the insurance value approach as in the case of health care. If<lb/> elderly care is subsidised and access to subsidised facilities is universal, then one can impute the value of<lb/> elderly care services to the elderly, irrespective of whether they are actually using the service or not. These<lb/> expenditures per age group can be considered as a kind of insurance premium by which one is insured for<lb/> the care costs (either in the form of home-help or in an institution) one might incur with increasing age.<lb/> 46.<lb/> In-kind benefits for elderly people fall into two broad categories: first, home-help services, e.g.<lb/> providing assistance to elderly living outside residential care centres for carrying out their daily tasks, and<lb/> second, day care services (provision of residential care in an institution, costs of operating homes for the<lb/> elderly, service flats, sheltered homes, etc). This second category can include both nursing homes, which<lb/> provide nursing and personal care to persons that face restrictions in their activities of daily living, as well<lb/> as institutions that are not designed specifically for people with extra care needs.<lb/> 47.<lb/> Extensive international comparative research on elderly care has been scarce for many reasons:<lb/> designs of systems and administrative auspices are complex and vary remarkably, division between public<lb/> and private responsibilities is unclear, and analytical frameworks lack reliability and consistency (<ref type="biblio">Österle<lb/> 2002). 19</ref> In addition to differences in expenditure levels, a great deal of variation can be found between<lb/> countries in the use of elderly care services. It is difficult to make perfect comparisons between the figures<lb/> shown in <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>			<figure>as the age groups are not identical, but bearing this in mind we can see remarkable<lb/> differences in coverage: in Norway, for instance, 62 per cent of the oldest age group (85+) are using home<lb/> care services while the same figure is 7 per cent in Estonia (80+). The use of institutional care varies from<lb/> 4 per cent in Estonia and 8 per cent in Spain to 34 per cent in Denmark and 40 per cent in Iceland<lb/> (Vaalavuo, 2011).<lb/> <ref type="biblio">19<lb/></ref> Moreover, variance can be found in following areas: branch covering the risk of dependence (healthcare,<lb/> sickness, invalidity, or long-term care), system of coverage (social insurance or social assistance),<lb/> conditions for which benefits are granted, qualifying period, means testing, age groups covered, minimum<lb/> level of dependency, user charges for benefits in kind, level of benefits in cash, and needs-testing according<lb/> to the level of dependency (MISSOC 2009).<lb/></p>

			<p>48.<lb/> Information on publicly-funded elderly care expenditures by age groups is available for the five<lb/> Nordic countries, Estonia, France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, the Netherlands, Slovenia, Spain and the<lb/> United Kingdom. Using the proportions of users by age group (see <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>), the amount of public spending<lb/> on each age group is derived. This amount is further divided by the total number of people in the age group<lb/> in question reflecting now both the volume of spending and the user profile. This results in a monetary<lb/> value per person in each age group that we can then allocate to individuals in the dataset. The logic is the<lb/> same as for the imputation of health care expenditures. The number of age groups varies from one to five<lb/> according to the data available. The possibility to distinct between home care and residential care was<lb/> available for Estonia, Finland, Italy, Iceland, Norway, Sweden and the United Kingdom.<lb/> 49.<lb/> Institutionalisation or reliance on domestic care does not only depend on severity of illness, but<lb/> also on matters such as marital status, availability of informal caregivers, incentives to be found in the<lb/> organisation of public care system and even the walking distance to public transports (<ref type="biblio">Österle 2002</ref>).<lb/> Despite the fact that people living in institutions are excluded from the survey, this in-kind benefit is<lb/> included in the imputation. Even if no respondent in the data is actually staying in an elderly institution,<lb/> this service is considered as an insurance against old age, thus the possible, not real, benefit is taken into<lb/> account here.<lb/></p>

			<head>3.8 Adjusting for differences in needs<lb/> 3.8.1 What equivalence scale should be applied for in-kind benefits?<lb/></head>

			<p>50.<lb/> In distributional studies, it is common practice to correct household income with an equivalence<lb/> scale to take account of economies of scale: the needs of a household grow with each additional member,<lb/> but not in a proportional way (OECD 2005a).

			<p>Home based services<lb/> Institutional care<lb/> non-cash income components are included, this may give rise to what Radner (1997) has called the<lb/> &quot; consistency &quot; problem: some types of non-cash income may have needs associated with them that are<lb/> unmeasured in usual equivalence scales. The question is particularly relevant in the case of poverty<lb/> analysis, as inclusion of non-cash incomes can represent considerable relative changes in income to low-<lb/>income households. Consider two single-person households with each USD 1000 cash income. Person A is<lb/> ill and receives public health care worth USD 200, whereas person B is healthy and needs no health care.<lb/> Consequently, person A could be said to have 20% more needs than B because of differences in health care<lb/> needs, and his equivalence scale should be 1.2 compared to 1 for B.<lb/> 51.<lb/> Even though the problem is recognized in the literature, the standard approach in most empirical<lb/> studies is to apply the same equivalence scale for both cash and extended income. <ref type="biblio">Garfinkel et al. (2006)<lb/></ref> defend this approach because &quot; on the one hand, in-kind benefits do not exhibit economies of scale, which<lb/> implies they should be divided by household size rather than the square of the household size. On the other<lb/> hand, in-kind benefits are not shared equally by all family members, which suggests that they should be<lb/> added to equivalent cash income on an individual basis. (…) Thus our use of the same equivalence scale<lb/> for both cash and in-kind expenditures is a reasonable middle-of-the-road solution &quot; .<lb/> 52.<lb/> <ref type="table">Table 4</ref> illustrates these three options for a &quot; typical &quot; poor household consisting of two adults and<lb/> two children aged 8 and 13. 21 The disposable cash household income is USD 40,000. Applying the<lb/> standard OECD equivalence scale, which is the square root of household size, this is converted to USD<lb/> 20,000 of equivalent income attached to each individual (column (1)). The child of 8 years is enrolled in<lb/> primary school (value estimated as USD 3,000), whereas the 13 year old is in lower secondary education<lb/> (value USD 5,000). The corresponding amounts for extended income (i.e. cash income plus in-kind<lb/> benefits) using the three alternative options are presented in columns (2) through (4).<lb/> 53.<lb/> The amounts of extended income can differ considerably, depending on the option that is chosen.<lb/> Moreover, this will also affect how poverty outcomes are assessed. Using a fixed 22 poverty line (50% of<lb/> the median income before imputation, i.e. USD 21,000), all members of this household are counted as non-<lb/>poor after imputation of education expenditures, on either a cash income equivalence scale (column 2) or<lb/> on a per-capita basis (column 3). However, when in-kind benefits are attributed to the individual user only,<lb/> then the two adults remain poor (column 4). Using a floating poverty line, the assessment differs when in-<lb/>kind benefits are imputed on a per-capita basis: in that case, all family members remain poor.<lb/></p>

			<p>Adult family members<lb/> poor, children not poor<lb/> 54.<lb/> There are two strands of recent work that each proposes an alternative solution to the problem of<lb/> appropriate equivalence scales for in-kind benefits (<ref type="biblio">Aaberge et al. 2010a and 2010b; Paulus et al. 2010</ref>).<lb/> Both approaches rely on actual government spending on public services, though their methodology is<lb/> considerably different. Below, these approaches are applied empirically in order to test the sensitivity of<lb/> the results with regard to the standard use of the cash income equivalence scales to other specifications.<lb/></p>

			<head>3.8.2 A theoretically derived equivalence scale based on minimum expenditures of public services<lb/></head>

			<p>55.<lb/> Very recently <ref type="biblio">Aaberge et al. (2010a and 2010b</ref>) have proposed a new methodology aiming to<lb/> offer a solution to the issue of differences in needs. In the first paper (2010a) the authors derive a<lb/> theoretical model, drawing on detailed Norwegian data, whereas the second paper (2010b) extends the<lb/> application of this approach to EU member countries. 23<lb/> 56.<lb/> The core piece of the methodology of <ref type="biblio">Aaberge et al. (2010a &amp; 2010b</ref>) is the construction of a<lb/> joint equivalence scale for extended income, defined as the weighted average of scales for cash and non-<lb/>cash income. This joint scale implies that &quot; individuals who are unequal with respect to needs for public<lb/> services are given unequal weights in the needs adjustment &quot; (<ref type="biblio">Aaberge et al. 2010b</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<head>3.8.2.1 Theoretical model<lb/></head>

			<p>57.<lb/> This innovative methodology proposes to construct a household equivalence scale that takes<lb/> account of needs that are associated with cash income on the one hand (which corresponds largely to<lb/> consumption of goods) and the needs that are linked with public services such as e.g. health care and<lb/> education, on the other. This latter category in general does not exhibit economies of scale, and<lb/> 23<lb/></p>

			<p>This approach has been discussed with the author at a workshop meeting in May 2010. We would like to<lb/> thank Rolf Aaberge for his availability and him and his team for permission to use this approach in the<lb/> frame of the present study.<lb/> consequently should be derived in a different way as the cash income equivalence scale, which structure is<lb/> typically characterised by scale economies.<lb/> 58.<lb/> The reasoning behind applying a different scale of in-kind services is the assumption that specific<lb/> population groups have extra needs for specific services and that these groups should not suffer<lb/> economically because they belong to a household with a high need for specific services. To take the<lb/> example of health and older people above, this means that health services received by families with older<lb/> people should not only count as an increase in extended income but should also be counterbalanced by<lb/> increasing the equivalence scale for these families.<lb/> 59.<lb/> The construction of a joint equivalence scale involves several steps. In a first step, an equivalence<lb/> scale for public services for each individual is established, based on values of group-specific spending<lb/> (relative to a reference group). In Aaberge et al. 2010a detailed data on local government spending in<lb/> Norway are used to estimate a Linear Expenditure System (LES) that explains differences in spending<lb/> behaviour of Norwegian municipalities. This model is applied to determine the minimum expenditures per<lb/> service category per target group 24 that a social planner considers as necessary, taking into account (a)<lb/> heterogeneity in expenditure needs, and (b) local preferences for allocation of income to different services.<lb/> These minimum expenditures indicate how much budget the social planner has to spend on each person in<lb/> a certain target group to ensure that a certain level of social welfare is attained for each member of this<lb/> target group; they are the basis for deriving for each individual the equivalence scale associated with the<lb/> public services. This individual equivalence scale is derived as the sum of the public service expenditures<lb/> allocated to this individual compared to a reference amount. It is assumed that the sector-specific<lb/> discretionary income is allocated to target groups by the same proportions as minimum expenditures.<lb/> 60.<lb/> What <ref type="biblio">Aaberge et al (2010a &amp; 2010b</ref>) call the needs-adjusted equivalence scale NA for household<lb/> h, is a weighted average of the cash income equivalence scale CI h – which remains the familiar modified<lb/> OECD scale – and the sum of the individual non-cash income equivalence scales NC j (for public service j):<lb/></p>

				<formula>(1) NA h = θ r CI h + (1-θ r )∑ j n hj NC j<lb/></formula>

			<p>The weight θ r is equal to the ratio between the minimum required cash income and the minimum<lb/> required extended income of the reference group r. The number of members of household h in target<lb/> group j is given by n hj .<lb/> 61.<lb/> The choice of the reference person is important as it determines both the non-cash income<lb/> equivalence scale and the weight of the cash and non-cash income equivalence scale. The reference target<lb/> group r can be anybody, e.g. somebody with either high or low needs. Following the theoretical<lb/> framework presented in <ref type="biblio">Aaberge et al (2010a</ref>) the same reference person has to be used for 1) constructing<lb/> the in-kind equivalence scale, and 2) calculating the weight θ r . As the equivalence scale is a relative one,<lb/> the choice of the reference group should not pose a problem (see <ref type="biblio">Blackorby and Donaldson, 1993</ref> for the<lb/> issue of relative and absolute equivalence scales).<lb/> 62.<lb/> As all values are expressed in terms of a reference household by the social planner (hence, a<lb/> relative equivalence scale), the choice of this reference group changes also the reference framework. When<lb/> scale invariant indices (like Gini coefficients and relative poverty rates) are used, the results are<lb/> independent of the choice of reference group. This means that changing the reference target group from<lb/> e.g. a single man aged 40 to a couple with two children (who have considerably higher needs for services,<lb/> see infra), will change the value of the equivalence scale, but not of the Gini coefficients or relative<lb/> 24<lb/> A target group is defined as a group of people with similar needs for public services.<lb/> poverty rates. This is due to the fact that a change of reference group only leads to a scale transformation of<lb/> the needs adjusted-scale, which follows by straightforward calculation.<lb/></p>

			<head>3.8.2.2 Target groups for needs adjustment<lb/></head>

			<p>63.<lb/> Ideally, the definition of the target groups should follow as closely as possible the logic of the<lb/> services concerned. For some services (e.g. elderly care, or disability care, or administration) the definition<lb/> of the target group is rather straightforward, whereas for instance in the case of childcare and tertiary<lb/> education this is more difficult and can be very country specific. In the case of childcare, should all parents<lb/> with children in a specific age group (e.g. 0-6 year old) be considered as one target group, or should a<lb/> distinction be made between full-time working parents and others? In the latter case, why should full-time<lb/> employed parents have higher childcare needs? Perhaps non-working parents have these needs as well, but<lb/> childcare is not available, or not affordable, and thus they are not free in their choice between one and two<lb/> earnership. Research for Norway indicated for instance that childcare needs of parents are in general met,<lb/> thanks to widespread availability of childcare facilities: labour supply went up first, and the demand of<lb/> childcare followed. But this is probably not the case in all countries.<lb/> 64.<lb/> Another service for which the definition of the target group is not evident is tertiary education:<lb/> should one consider only beneficiaries as a target group, or only use age limits to define potential<lb/> beneficiaries (e.g. all individuals aged 18-24)? The choices made to define target groups in this study are<lb/> discussed below for the three sectors of in-kind services considered in this study. For social housing it is<lb/> assumed that this type of costs is covered in the cash income equivalence scale, so there is no need to<lb/> incorporate this service in the non-cash income equivalence scale.<lb/> 65.<lb/> The entire population forms the target groups for health care, though the level of spending differs<lb/> across individuals. Here, the insurance value approach is used to estimate benefits from health care<lb/> services, using age and gender to differentiate the amounts. As the data allow for a breakdown for each age<lb/> level, target groups can be defined here very specifically. For instance, a man aged 62 is allocated a<lb/> different amount compared to a man aged 63, and thus their needs differ and they will belong to different<lb/> target groups. A similar approach is followed for long-term elderly care, though the demarcation of target<lb/> groups is based on broader age groups.<lb/> 66.<lb/> For education, target groups are formed by the actual beneficiaries of education services. As the<lb/> age limits for various education levels differ across countries (e.g. compulsory education has different<lb/> lower and upper age limits), the target groups are not defined by age, but by the actual education level the<lb/> person is currently enrolled in. The following education levels are considered: 1) pre-primary education; 2)<lb/> primary education; 3) lower secondary education; 4) upper secondary education; 5) post-secondary non-<lb/>tertiary education; 6) tertiary education. These groups are mutually exclusive, as one can only participate in<lb/> one education level at a time. It should, however, be noted that an age limit of 30 is applied. This means<lb/> that if somebody of 35 is in education, this person is assumed not to have education needs (even though the<lb/> benefit of the education service will be part of his or her imputed and thus extended income). Also for<lb/> early childhood services, actual beneficiaries are identified as target groups.<lb/> 67.<lb/> <ref type="biblio">Aaberge et al. (2010b)</ref> argue that the observed pattern of public spending on these services across<lb/> target-groups is &quot; a result of complex processes where decisions made by democratic institutions play a<lb/> major role. The relative spending across target groups may thus be considered as reflecting the priorities of<lb/> policy decision makers and/or the expert opinion on relative needs of different target groups. &quot;<lb/></p>

			<head>3.8.2.3 Constructing an equivalence scale adjusted for needs associated with public services.<lb/></head>

			<p>68.<lb/> In order to specify an equivalence scale that incorporates the needs associated with public<lb/> services, we start from the target groups described in the previous section. For each target group a<lb/> monetary value of public services is imputed along the lines described in the previous chapters. A<lb/> reference group is chosen, namely a single man who is aged 40 and has no children. For the various target<lb/> groups, individual non-cash income is divided by that of the reference group in order to construct the non-<lb/>cash income equivalence scale. In the next step the average value of this scale is calculated over<lb/> countries. 25<lb/> 69.<lb/> Hence, the equivalence scale for non-cash incomes is defined in terms of average service<lb/> standards, though in the theoretical framework <ref type="biblio">Aaberge et al. (2010a)</ref> propose to use minimum service<lb/> standards. <ref type="biblio">Aaberge et al. (2010b)</ref> indicate, however, that results are independent of this choice, because<lb/> ratios of standards between different target groups do not change if the average service standard is replaced<lb/> with that of half the median service standard, since the median in kind benefit is equal to the average when<lb/> all in-kind transfers to a given target group are equal (which is the case). Next, the individual non-cash<lb/> income equivalence scales NC j are summed over household members.<lb/> 70.<lb/> In the following step, half of average cash income of the reference target group is calculated over<lb/> countries. Half of the amount is taken in order to be close to the idea of minimum required cash income.<lb/> This amount is then combined with half of the reference amount of in-kind benefits, which is taken as a<lb/> measure of minimum required in-kind income, in order to calculate the weight θ r , which is the ratio<lb/> between the minimum required cash income and the minimum required extended income of the reference<lb/> target group r. In our calculations, θ r is equal to 0.9710, thus a major weight is given to the cash income<lb/> equivalence scale in constructing the overall scale for extended income. Finally, formula (1) is applied to<lb/> derive the needs-adjusted equivalence scale for each household.<lb/> 71.<lb/> <ref type="table">Table 5</ref>			<figure>lists a selection of household types and the corresponding equivalence scales for cash<lb/> income (square root of household size), non-cash income (NC scale) and extended income (NA scale). The<lb/> examples given here are all for households with adults not in education. Results are in line with those<lb/> reported by Aaberge et al. (2010b). The age profiles of health care and long-term elderly care spending are<lb/> reflected in the NC-scale that increases with age and that shows higher needs for women compared to men.<lb/> Also household with children have higher values of the NC-scale, following patterns on education<lb/> spending.<lb/> 25<lb/> In this respect, the approach in this study differs from Aaberge et al. 2010b, who use the median; however,<lb/> as our target groups are very narrowly defined, the median may not return a value for each target group.<lb/> Hence, the average is taken.<lb/> Table 5.

			<head>3.8.3 A sensitivity analysis on the equivalence scale for differences in spending on public services<lb/> across countries 26<lb/></head>

			<p>72.<lb/> The approach presented in <ref type="biblio">Paulus et al. (2010)</ref> also uses actual expenditures on public services<lb/> as an indicator for the needs, but in a different way. Its basic point of departure is that the equivalence scale<lb/> used to measure inequality of disposable income is conditional on the existence of free public services such<lb/> as education and health care. If the value of these public services is included in the income concept, then<lb/> the equivalence scale should also be adapted.</p>

			<p>Lone mother, aged<lb/> 40, 1 child in<lb/> education<lb/> needs of the recipients of these services are equal to a specific sum of money. For example, we could<lb/> assume that the per capita amounts spent by the state for age-specific population groups on public<lb/> education and public health care depict accurately the corresponding needs of these groups. Then the<lb/> recalculation of equivalence scale is straightforward. &quot;<lb/> 73.<lb/> Following this line of argumentation, the following should be valid for a household to remain at<lb/> the same welfare level before and after including public services in the income concept:<lb/></p>

				<formula>(2) y/e = (y + k) / e&apos;<lb/></formula>

			<p>with y being cash disposable income, e the modified OECD equivalence scale, k the value of public<lb/> services and e&apos; the new equivalence scale which incorporates the extra needs of the household<lb/> members for public services.<lb/> 74.<lb/> This formula can be rewritten as<lb/></p>

				<formula>(3) e&apos; = (y + k) e / y<lb/></formula>

			<p>meaning that for all households (with y different from zero) the new equivalence scale can be derived.<lb/> Note that this scale is income-dependent, as its value decreases with income level, implying smaller<lb/> economies of scale for poorer households and larger ones for richer households.<lb/> 75.<lb/> The value of k differs across countries, and can reflect differences social priorities. In this sense<lb/> this approach is similar to the one proposed by <ref type="biblio">Aaberge et al. (2010a)</ref>, namely that actual expenditures on<lb/> public services form the basis for the derivation of the corresponding needs. But as is apparent from a<lb/> comparison of formulae (1) and (3) the form of the proposed equivalence scale differs between the two<lb/> approaches.<lb/> 76.<lb/> <ref type="biblio">Paulus et al. (2010)</ref> propose to exploit differences in expenditures between countries to test the<lb/> sensitivity of distributive results for alternative specifications of k. In each country the value of k used in<lb/> formula (3) is adjusted in such a way that it corresponds to the unweighted average for the different<lb/> services considered. In this study, this would imply that public spending for education (with breakdowns<lb/> for the different levels), for health care (for different age groups), ECEC (for different types) and long-term<lb/> elderly care are adjusted to the EU average spending.<lb/> 77.<lb/> Thus for each household with n members (i=1,...,n) with different characteristics (corresponding<lb/> to the definition of target groups in the approach by <ref type="biblio">Aaberge et al. (2010)</ref>), the value of k is calculated as:<lb/></p>

The new equivalence scale e&apos;<lb/> of formula (3) is then recalculated for all households using the new value of k, which reflects EU<lb/> averages of spending.<lb/> 78.<lb/> Application of this methodology is in fact a sensitivity test for differences in national spending<lb/> across countries, and thus gives an indication of cross-country differences with respect to the underlying<lb/> needs associated with public services. It assumes that the needs of the recipients are reflected in per capita<lb/> spending amounts for specific target groups. In this way it is similar to the approach proposed by <ref type="biblio">Aaberge<lb/> et al. (2010)</ref>. These two approaches are applied in section 4.3 in order to test the sensitivity of the results<lb/> for applying alternative equivalence scales.<lb/></p>

			<head>3.9 Indicators to assess the pro-poorness of publicly provided services<lb/></head>

			<p>79.<lb/> Almost all studies that investigate the distribution of publicly-provided services confine their<lb/> results to inequality indicators. Very few studies investigate the impact on poverty. The most notable<lb/> exception is <ref type="biblio">Smeeding et al. (1993)</ref>, which reports considerable reductions in poverty rates after inclusion<lb/> of public health care and education services. Furthermore, the imputation also slightly alters the ranking of<lb/> the seven countries in this study in terms of the poverty headcount. According to this study which uses data<lb/> for the early 1980s, poverty is reduced by between one quarter and one third in the Continental European<lb/> countries and the United States, but by half to two thirds in Australia, Canada and the United Kingdom<lb/> (<ref type="table">Table 6</ref>). Smeeding et al. opted to use a fixed poverty line (50% of median cash disposable income, kept<lb/> fixed before and after imputation of in-kind services) and in-kind benefits have been equivalised on a per<lb/> capita basis.<lb/></p>

			<table>Table 6: Poverty reduction after imputing education and health care services, seven OECD countries, results<lb/> from earlier studies<lb/> Note: Data refer to the early 1980s.<lb/> Source: Smeeding et al. (1993), Table 7.<lb/></table>

			<head>3.9.1 Should a &quot; fixed &quot; or a &quot; floating &quot; poverty line be used?<lb/></head>

			<p>80.<lb/> A common practice in international comparative research is to use a relative poverty measure,<lb/> referring for instance to the share of people with income below 50% or 60% of the median equivalent<lb/> income. However, should the same poverty line be used for disposable cash and extended income (i.e. a<lb/> &quot; fixed &quot; poverty line), or should it be re-calculated separately for each income concept (i.e. a &quot; floating &quot;<lb/> poverty line)? There are good arguments for both solutions. Applying a fixed threshold (such as in<lb/> <ref type="biblio">Smeeding et al. 1993</ref> above) captures the effect of the size and incidence of in-kind benefits, but disregards<lb/> the re-ranking of individuals and the change in relative income differentials that may occur when moving<lb/> from the cash disposable income distribution to that of extended income. With a floating poverty threshold,<lb/> the poverty line is recalculated in order to comprise both cash and in-kind elements. The use of a floating<lb/> poverty line means that the values of the poverty thresholds are increased in the order of 18 to 47% (<ref type="biblio">Table<lb/> A.3 in Annex 1</ref>) when all in-kind benefits are included in the income concept. This approach is applied in<lb/> Sutherland and Tsakloglou (2009) and the poverty effect then also incorporates the shifts in relative<lb/> positions that arise from including in-kind benefits; it looks at poverty levels that follow from the new<lb/> distribution of resources. The difference that the choice of the poverty line can make was already<lb/> illustrated in a hypothetical example (cf. supra).<lb/></p>

			<head>3.9.2 The role of compositional factors for interpreting results of services&apos; impacts on poverty patterns<lb/></head>

			<p>81.<lb/> In addition to the above conceptual considerations, the interpretation of results based on<lb/> comparing poverty indicators before and after in-kind services is not trivial. Adding in-kind services<lb/> changes the income distribution and the composition of the population at the bottom end, notwithstanding<lb/> which equivalence scale is applied and which poverty threshold is used. Poverty outcomes will be<lb/> determined to a large extent by the interaction between the characteristics of in-kind beneficiaries and<lb/> those of the initially poor population. If, for instance, beneficiaries of compulsory education expenditures<lb/> are predominantly non-poor and clustered around the middle of the distribution before taking account of<lb/> these expenditures (as is the case in the Nordic countries), including education services will further<lb/> accentuate the differential with low-income families without children. The effect on poverty reduction will<lb/> be lower than in countries where children are more concentrated at the bottom of the distribution and it<lb/> could even lead to the counter-intuitive result of increasing overall (relative) poverty. Likewise, in<lb/> countries with high old-age poverty, adding health services will have a higher poverty reduction impact.<lb/> These compositional factors may help explain why earlier studies find a much lower poverty reduction<lb/> effect of services in countries like Sweden and Germany (see <ref type="table">Table 6</ref> above). It is therefore important to<lb/> identify the distributional features and the composition of the poor population prior to the imputation of in-<lb/>kind services.<lb/></p>

			<head>3.9.3 Poverty reduction potential of in-kind benefits<lb/></head>

			<p>82.<lb/> Traditional indicators such as those comparing poverty headcounts before and after accounting<lb/> for services remain of somewhat limited use for policy considerations as they need to be interpreted<lb/> alongside information on the composition of the poor population in a given country, and because they<lb/> require a priori judgements about poverty thresholds. Hence, an alternative way of capturing the possible<lb/> poverty impact of public services is proposed.<lb/> 83.<lb/> This alternative way looks at the &quot; pro-poor &quot; characteristics of services with a particular focus on<lb/> their poverty reduction potential, rather than on their arithmetic effects on poverty rates. Such an approach<lb/> also takes into account that poverty reduction per se is not the prime aim of education and health care<lb/> services. The question here is: what could be the overall impact of in-kind services on poverty given the<lb/> current level and distribution of these benefits and given the current composition of the poor population?<lb/> For instance, a given increase in expenditures on compulsory education will have a greater impact on<lb/> overall poverty reduction in countries where child poverty is much higher than overall poverty and where<lb/> the population share of pupils is high.<lb/> 84.<lb/> To that aim, an indicator is constructed which first calculates the aggregated income shortfall of<lb/> the entire poor population, i.e. the total income value that would have to be spent to pull everyone out of<lb/> poverty – the usual poverty-gap measure. In a second step, the income values of all specific in-kind<lb/> services which accrue to the poor population are aggregated. This second aggregate then is divided by the<lb/> first one to obtain an indication of the poverty reduction potential of in-kind benefits: to which extent<lb/> might in-kind services reduce the current poverty gap? It can be compared to a similar measure for cash<lb/> transfers.<lb/></p>

			<head>4.<lb/> THE IMPACT OF IN-KIND BENEFITS ON INCOME DISTRIBUTION AND POVERTY<lb/></head>

			<p>85.<lb/> This chapter presents the empirical analyses of the distribution effects of public services. In a first<lb/> step the effect of total public services is considered for the entire population. These overall results are<lb/> tested on the sensitivity for other specifications of the equivalence scales, using two innovative approaches<lb/> for incorporating the needs associated with public services (see section 3.8). Next, the effect of five major<lb/> services separately is investigated. These five services are education, health care, social housing, early<lb/> childhood education and childcare, and long-term elderly care.<lb/> 86.<lb/> The presentation below follows three stages. For the total and for each category of services<lb/> separately, first their importance is indicated by their share of disposable income. Second, an overall<lb/> indication of potential distributional consequences is then shown by looking at the quintile distribution of<lb/> the respective benefit over respective beneficiaries. Finally, the distributive impact is considered with the<lb/> help of inequality summary indicators, such as the Gini coefficient and the poverty reduction potential<lb/> indicator (PRPI). 27<lb/></p>

			<head>4.1 The distributive impact of publicly provided in-kind benefits taken together<lb/></head>

			<p>87.<lb/> A first question refers to the overall level of publicly provided services in comparison to cash<lb/> transfers. <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref> presents the value of in-kind benefits as a share of disposable household income for 27<lb/> OECD countries. Taking into account the value of the five types of in-kind benefits considered in this<lb/> study would increase household disposable cash income by as much as 29% on average in the OECD. 28<lb/> For comparison, the share of cash transfers (including old-age and survivor &quot; s benefits) amounts to 23% of<lb/> disposable income. There are only a few countries (Austria, Germany, Poland) where the value of cash<lb/> transfers compared to disposable income is higher than that of services (in line with the results on the<lb/> public spending shares in GDP depicted in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref> above).<lb/> 88.<lb/> The income-increasing effect of services is highest in the Scandinavian countries and Hungary<lb/> (35% or more) and lower in Australia and Greece (around 20%). Health care and education (excluding pre-<lb/>primary education) are by far the most important components. In most countries, the imputed value of<lb/> health care is higher than that of education; exceptions are Canada, Denmark, Ireland, Mexico, Norway<lb/> and Poland, where education forms the largest category. The services for early childhood education and<lb/> childcare increase household income on average by 2% but by more than 3% in Denmark, Finland,<lb/> Hungary and Sweden. Long-term elderly care services raise incomes by 1% and are highest in the four<lb/> Nordic countries and the Netherlands. In three countries, social housing increases household income by<lb/> more than 1%, namely in the Czech Republic (1.2%), in Ireland (1.6%) and in the United Kingdom (2.5%)<lb/> compared to an average of 0.4%.<lb/></p>

			<head>27<lb/></head>

			<p>In the following empirical analyses, the terms &quot; poverty rate &quot; and &quot; &quot; poverty gap &quot; are used as short-cuts for<lb/> at-risk-of poverty rate and at-risk-of poverty gap.<lb/></p>

			<figure>28<lb/> This is equivalent to an increase in households income from USD 21 500 to USD 27 600, for the average<lb/> of countries considered here..<lb/> Figure 3. In-kind benefit from public services as a share of disposable income, 2007<lb/> Notes: 1) ECEC=Early Childhood Education and Childcare; LTC=elderly long-term care; CT=cash transfers. 2) The income concept<lb/> used is that of disposable household income in cash, adjusted for household size with the modified OECD scale. 3) Countries are<lb/> ranked in decreasing order by share of total in-kind expenditures in disposable income.<lb/> Source: OECD Secretariat&apos;s computations from OECD/EU database on the distributional impact of in-kind services and national<lb/> survey data for non-EU countries.<lb/></figure>

			<p>89.<lb/> As the benefits of the two major categories of public services, education and health care, are to a<lb/> large extent determined by age, one may expect different patterns for different age groups. Three broad<lb/> categories are considered, namely children (aged younger than 18), adults of working age (18 – 65 year<lb/> old) and elderly (older than 65). Children (and their families) are the main beneficiaries of education<lb/> services while older people (and their families) are main beneficiaries of health services. In the vast<lb/> majority of countries, children are the ones with the largest share of in-kind benefits in disposable income,<lb/> with on average 40%, followed by 39% for the elderly and 23% for working age individuals (<ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>).<lb/> There are only some exceptions to this pattern, and in all these countries older people would have the<lb/> largest increase in income when in-kind benefits are imputed: especially in Denmark, Iceland, the<lb/> Netherlands, Norway, Sweden and the United Kingdom, the elderly would increase their cash income by<lb/> half or more. For working age adults, the increase in income would be between 10% and 30%, which is in<lb/> all countries the lowest of the three age categories, with the exception of Poland, where the elderly have<lb/> the lowest share.<lb/></p>

			<p>90.<lb/> If benefits are of equal size for all they will, ceteris paribus, translate into larger proportional<lb/> increases in the incomes of poorer households. A first step is therefore to analyse the increase in household<lb/> income resulting from imputation of services by income groups. Income quintiles are built on the basis of<lb/> equivalent disposable household income, before accounting for in-kind services, with Q1 representing the<lb/> poorer 20% and Q5 the richest 20%.<lb/> 91.<lb/> All types of public services considered here account for a much higher share of disposable<lb/> income among lower-income than among higher-income households: 76% of disposable income for the<lb/> poorest 20% and only 14% for the top 20% (<ref type="table">Table 7</ref>). In relative terms, services from social housing and<lb/> elderly care have more significance in the incomes of low-income than those of high-income households.<lb/> This differential is weaker in the case of the other services considered.<lb/></p>

			<p>92.<lb/> Overall, in-kind benefits are rather evenly distributed over different income groups, with only a<lb/> very slight orientation towards lower incomes (<ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref>). This pattern is strikingly similar across countries.<lb/> Only in the Nordic countries, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom, in-kind benefits are somewhat<lb/> more targeted to the lower income groups.<lb/></p>

Before<lb/> considering services, income inequality as measured by the Gini coefficient is high (around 0.37) in<lb/> Portugal and the United States and highest in Mexico (0.47), and comparatively low (0.25 and below) in<lb/> Slovenia, Sweden, Norway and Denmark (see Figure 6). But when services are included the Gini<lb/> coefficient falls by roughly around one fifth, on average, from 0.30 to 0.24. Reduction rates range from<lb/></figure>

			<p>94.<lb/> Table A.5 in Annex 1 presents estimates of the effects of public services for additional inequality<lb/> indicators, the interquintile share ratio S80/S20 (i.e. the sum of income going to the top 20% divided by the<lb/> share going to the bottom 20%) and the P90/P10 decile ratio (i.e. the ratio of the income of the person at<lb/> the 9 th decile to the person at the 1 st decile). Cash income inequality follows a similar pattern for the three<lb/> indicators in terms of country ranking. The effect of including public services in the income concept is<lb/> even more pronounced with the last two measures compared to the Gini: the p90/p10 ratio declines from<lb/> 3.94 to 2.85 (or -26%), and the S80/S20 ratio drops even with almost 30% (from 4.95 to 3.43) after<lb/> including public services. These two tail-sensitive measures report higher inequality reductions due to the<lb/> fact that the in-kind benefits represent a high relative income share for the lower incomes (as was shown in<lb/> <ref type="table">Table 7</ref>).<lb/> 95.<lb/> There is no systematic relation between initial levels of cash income inequality and the degree of<lb/> inequality reduction through in-kind benefits, although some high-inequality countries strongly reduce<lb/> inequality through in-kind benefits. The United Kingdom and, according to most inequality measures, the<lb/> United States, Mexico and Portugal achieve higher reduction rates while the low-inequality country<lb/> Slovenia records lower ones. The variation in inequality levels across OECD countries (as measured by the<lb/> coefficient of variation) is not reduced when taking account of publicly-provided services – but only when<lb/> estimates are based on the Gini coefficient. Using alternative more tail-sensitive inequality measures,<lb/> however, reduces cross-country dispersion. These results are in line with <ref type="biblio">Garfinkel et al. (2006)</ref> who find<lb/> for 10 OECD countries in the late 1990s, that cross-country differences in inequality at the bottom of the<lb/> income distribution are reduced following inclusion of in-kind benefits.<lb/></p>

			<head>4.2<lb/> The impact of publicly provided in-kind benefits on poverty<lb/></head>

			<p>96.<lb/> How do public services affect relative poverty? <ref type="figure">Figure 7</ref> compares poverty rates for cash<lb/> disposable income with poverty rates for extended income (i.e. including the monetary value of public<lb/> services), using both a &quot; floating &quot; and a &quot; fixed &quot; poverty threshold. With a floating poverty line, the poverty<lb/> line is set at 50% of median equivalent cash income and at 50% of median equivalent extended income,<lb/> respectively. The results are illustrative and should not be interpreted as &quot; actual &quot; poverty reduction, as<lb/> discussed in the methodological part of this paper. Before accounting for services, overall poverty rates are<lb/> high in Mexico and the United States, and low in most Nordic countries, the Netherlands and the Czech<lb/> and Slovak Republics. When measuring poverty reduction on the basis of floating poverty lines, poverty is<lb/> almost halved following the inclusion of all public services in the income concept: the overall poverty rate<lb/> decreases from 10% to 5%. In Belgium, Ireland and the United Kingdom, poverty is reduced with close to<lb/> 60%, whereas the reduction is much smaller in Estonia and Sweden (around 25%). There is more of a<lb/> correlation between initial poverty levels and reduction rates which means that cross-country variation in<lb/> poverty based on extended income actually gets higher: at-risk-of poverty levels for disposable income<lb/> vary between 6% and 18% but levels for extended income vary between 3% and 10%.<lb/> 97.<lb/> The arithmetic reduction in poverty rates is even higher when a fixed poverty line is used, i.e.<lb/> 50% of median equivalent cash income is applied to both cash and extended income. On average the head<lb/> count falls from 10% to as low as 2% (corresponding to a reduction of around 80%). Poverty reduction is<lb/> highest (above 85%) in Belgium, the Czech Republic, France, Hungary, Ireland, Iceland, Luxembourg,<lb/> Portugal and Mexico, and lowest in Germany, Greece, Norway and the United States (less than 75%).<lb/></p>

The<lb/> question rather is what could be the overall impact of in-kind services on poverty given the current level<lb/> 0%<lb/> 5%<lb/> 10%<lb/> 15%<lb/> 20%<lb/> 25%<lb/> 0%<lb/> 2%<lb/> 4%<lb/> 6%<lb/> 8%<lb/> 10%<lb/> 12%<lb/> 14%<lb/> 16%<lb/> 18%<lb/> 20%<lb/> Cash disposable income<lb/> Extended income (fixed PL)<lb/> Extended income (Floating PL)<lb/></figure>

			<p>and distribution of these benefits and given the current composition of the poor population. For instance, a<lb/> given increase in expenditures on compulsory education will have a greater impact on overall poverty<lb/> reduction in countries where poverty among families with young children is much higher than overall<lb/> poverty and where the population share of pupils is high.<lb/> 99.<lb/> To that aim, a poverty reduction potential indicator (PRPI) is constructed (see chapter 3.9). It<lb/> measures the amount of the expenditures spent below the poverty line. As can be expected the poverty<lb/> reduction potential of the total of in-kind benefits is very high (on average 80%). With around 90% levels<lb/> are particularly high in France, Ireland, Mexico and Portugal. Australia, Germany and Norway report the<lb/> smallest reduction potential. When compared to cash transfers (excluding old-age and survivor &quot; s benefits)<lb/> the potential of in-kind benefits is much larger in all countries. The gap between cash transfers and in-kind<lb/> benefits is especially large in the Southern European countries and Mexico. Including old-age and<lb/> survivor &quot; s pensions in the cash transfers brings the potential of cash transfers to a higher level (plus 15<lb/> percentage points), reaching a level that is in some countries quite close to the value of public services (e.g.<lb/> in Hungary and Slovenia).<lb/> 100.<lb/> The poverty reduction potential is, however, not the same across the different age groups. Not<lb/> surpisingly, given their population weight, the reduction potential is highest among the people aged<lb/> between 18 and 64 years. Overall, the working age category receives the largest share of expenditures<lb/> below the poverty line: on average 48% of the poverty gap is reduced by spending of which this category is<lb/> beneficiary, on a total of 82%. However, compared to their share in the population (see <ref type="table">Table A</ref>.4 in<lb/> Annex 1) they are underrepresented in the poverty reduction potential gap. The working age population<lb/> accounts on average for 65% of the population, whereas they account for only half of the total PRPI.<lb/> 101.<lb/> The PRPI for the elderly is on average 11%, with much lower shares in Hungary, the Czech<lb/> Republic, Luxembourg and Poland, and the highest one in Slovenia. For children it is on average 23%,<lb/> with the highest share in Mexico, and lower ones in Germany and Finland. The contribution of the<lb/> youngest age group to the reduction of the poverty gap is clearly more than their share in the population<lb/> (which is on average 21% for the OECD, see <ref type="table">Table A</ref>			<figure>.4 in Annex 1).<lb/> Figure 8. Income advantage from public services and cash transfers going below the poverty line as a share of<lb/> the poverty gap of disposable income, poverty line at 50% of median equivalent income<lb/> Note: Countries are ranked in decreasing order by share of in-kind benefits spent below the poverty line in poverty gap.<lb/></figure>

			<head>4.3 The sensitivity of results for alternative specifications of the equivalence scale<lb/></head>

			<p>102.<lb/> In section 3.8, two innovative approaches have been discussed for taking account of the needs<lb/> associated with public services, namely a theoretically based needs-adjusted equivalence scale (proposed<lb/> by <ref type="biblio">Aaberge et al., 2010</ref>, and which is presented here by the abbreviation &quot; sd_aa &quot; ) and the approach<lb/> proposed by <ref type="biblio">Paulus et al. (2010)</ref> which tests the sensitivity for differences in spending levels (further<lb/> abbreviated as &quot; tb_pa &quot; ). For a selection of countries, the inequality and poverty outcomes when using these<lb/> two alternative approaches are compared here with the outcomes in the previous section that make use of<lb/> the cash income equivalence scale for both cash incomes and extended incomes.<lb/> 103.<lb/> <ref type="figure">Figure 9</ref> shows the Gini coefficients for cash and extended income, with three equivalence scales<lb/> for this last income concept. On average, when using the theoretically based approach presented by<lb/> <ref type="biblio">Aaberge et al. (2010)</ref>, inequality decreases in a way that is very similar to the considerable drop that occurs<lb/> when using the standard equivalence scale for extended income. This is the case for all countries. The<lb/> approach proposed by <ref type="biblio">Paulus et al. (2010)</ref>, on the contrary, yields inequality outcomes that hardly change<lb/> on average when moving from cash to extended income. For Estonia and Southern European countries,<lb/> inequality levels even increase somewhat (due to their lower spending levels), whereas in the Nordic<lb/> countries inequality tends to decrease, which follows from their relatively high spending levels. The other<lb/> two inequality indices provide the same picture and are hence not presented.<lb/></p>

			<head>4.5 The distributive impact of education services<lb/></head>

			<p>104.<lb/> Imputing the value of public education services based on actual use of these services increases<lb/> household income by some 12% on average (<ref type="figure">Figure 10</ref>). 29 This increase is larger for Mexico, Denmark,<lb/> Norway and Canada – 15% or more, whereas in Australia, Germany, Greece, Italy and the United<lb/> Kingdom it is below 10%.<lb/> 105.<lb/> Primary and lower secondary education correspond in most countries to compulsory education;<lb/> together they make up on average half of education expenditures in all countries. In some countries they<lb/> are clearly more important (especially in Australia, Luxembourg, Mexico and the United States and the<lb/> Nordic countries), whereas in other countries, their share is relatively small (e.g. Slovakia and Canada).<lb/> Upper secondary education has a share that is similar to that of lower secondary education in most<lb/> countries. Tertiary education is a smaller expenditure category, accounting for 2% of disposable income 30 .<lb/></p>

			<head>29<lb/></head>

			<p>The ranking of countries in terms of spending on education is not necessarily the same as the one in OECD<lb/> 2008b, as the denominator is different (disposable income here versus GDP in OECD 2008b).<lb/></p>

			<head>30<lb/></head>

			<p>The shares of post-secondary non-tertiary education are presented here for illustrative purposes; it<lb/> represents a relatively small proportion of expenditures in most countries and will not be considered<lb/> separately in the further analyses.<lb/></p>

			<p>106.<lb/> Total education expenditures tend to be allocated slightly more to lower incomes than to the top<lb/> groups (see <ref type="figure">Figure 11</ref>, Panel A): the first quintile receives on average 21% of all education expenditures,<lb/> compared to 18% in the fifth quintile. Slovenia, Belgium, Finland, and Estonia are somewhat less oriented<lb/> towards the bottom quintile (with shares of 17%), whereas in countries like Poland, Italy, Greece, Canada<lb/> and Hungary a higher share of total education expenditures is going to the bottom quintile (24-25%). The<lb/> redistributive impact is, however, likely to be different for different levels of education. Compulsory<lb/> education can be expected to be more redistributive than higher education, since the former is supposed to<lb/> benefit equally all school-age children, while tertiary education service has been shown to often be<lb/> regressive (e.g. OECD 2008a).<lb/> 107.<lb/> Compulsory education is slightly more oriented towards low income groups: on average, the<lb/> bottom quintile receives 23% of expenditures of this education category, compared to only 14% for the top<lb/> quintile (<ref type="figure">Figure 11</ref>, Panel B). This pattern is strongest in Greece and Poland (with a Q1 share of 28%), and<lb/> then decreases gradually over the countries towards 20%. In the Nordic countries and in Germany the<lb/> distribution of compulsory education is more middle-class biased, with significantly less than 20% of<lb/> expenditures going to both the bottom and the top quintile. The general progressive pattern elsewhere is<lb/> driven by the fact that children in compulsory education tend to be situated more in the lower parts of the<lb/> income distribution (see <ref type="figure">Figure A.1</ref> in the Annex 1).<lb/></p>

			<p>108.<lb/> The distribution pattern of upper-secondary education tends to be similar to that of compulsory<lb/> education (<ref type="figure">Figure 11</ref> Panel C). In general, these expenditures are distributed rather equally. Countries in<lb/> which less than 15% of expenditures go to the bottom quintile are Iceland, Germany, Mexico and the<lb/> Netherlands (11-13%). Again, this pattern mirrors the relative position of beneficiaries within the income<lb/> distribution (see <ref type="figure">Figure A</ref>.2 in Annex 1).<lb/> 109.<lb/> The pattern of the allocation of tertiary education services is quite different (see <ref type="figure">Figure 11</ref> Panel<lb/> D). The OECD-average indicates a regressive pattern with close to 30% of tertiary education expenditures<lb/> going to the top quintile of the income distribution. This, however, hides considerable cross-country<lb/> variation. The regressive pattern is most pronounced in Estonia and Mexico where the poorest 20% receive<lb/> less than 8% of tertiary education spending while, in the Nordic countries and Germany, this group<lb/> accounts for up to 51% of tertiary education services in Denmark and 25% in Iceland. In these countries,<lb/> many students live away from their parents and are thus classified as a separate household and, due to low<lb/> incomes, are often concentrated in the poorest 20% of the population (see also <ref type="figure">Figure A</ref>.3 in Annex 1).<lb/> 110.<lb/> The Gini coefficient drops considerably when including public education services in the income<lb/> concept. On average, it falls from 0.30 to 0.28, with a relatively low decline in Belgium and Finland and<lb/> more substantial reductions in countries like Mexico, Ireland and Poland (see Figure 12 and Table A.5 in<lb/> Annex 1).<lb/> Figure 12. Gini coefficient before and after inclusion of public education services.<lb/> Note: Countries are ranked in increasing order of Gini for cash income.<lb/> Source: OECD Secretariat&apos;s computations from OECD/EU database on the distributional impact of in-kind services and national<lb/> survey data for non-EU countries.<lb/></figure>

			<p>111.<lb/> The results of the poverty reduction potential indicator for total education are illustrated in <ref type="figure">Figure<lb/> 13</ref>, which also gives the distribution over age groups. The poverty reduction potential of education<lb/> expenditures is considerable: education services could reduce the poverty gap by around 44% on average,<lb/> with the highest cuts in Mexico, the Czech Republic, Ireland and Poland (+55%), and the lowest cuts in<lb/> Greece, Germany and Australia. The PRPI for education is split between the children and working age<lb/></p>

			<p>Source: OECD Secretariat&apos;s computations from OECD/EU database on the distributional impact of in-kind services and national<lb/> survey data for non-EU countries.<lb/> 112.<lb/> Looking at education levels separately reveals further patterns 31 . In most countries, compulsory<lb/> education spending is the main driver behind the potential poverty-gap reduction: 28% (compulsory)<lb/> compared to 12% (upper secondary) and 9% (tertiary). Especially Mexico, Poland, Ireland and<lb/> Luxembourg report high levels, mainly due to high spending on compulsory education, but also because of<lb/> relatively high shares of compulsory education pupils at the lower end of the distribution. The poverty<lb/> reduction potential of upper secondary education is with an average of 12% also important. This category<lb/> has a high score for this indicator (more than 15%) in Hungary, the Czech and Slovak Republics and in<lb/> Belgium, Ireland and Poland. In most countries upper secondary education has a higher poverty reduction<lb/> potential than tertiary education, except in the Nordic countries. In these countries, tertiary education<lb/> expenditures have an indicator of around 20%.<lb/></p>

			<head>31<lb/></head>

			<p>It should be noted that the combined effect of two (or more) education expenditure categories can be<lb/> smaller than the sum of the effect of both types considered separately, due to the fact that different<lb/> education levels may occur in one household. Take a household that is USD 500 below the poverty line<lb/> and receives in-kind benefits for compulsory education worth USD 1,000 and for upper secondary worth<lb/> 2,000. Both benefits separately are sufficient to bring the household above the poverty line, so poverty<lb/> reduction is attributed to both levels when looking at education levels separately. This is of course only an<lb/> issue in households where the sum of benefits of different education levels is higher than its poverty gap.<lb/></p>

			<head>4.6 The distributive impact of health care services<lb/></head>

			<p>113.<lb/> Previous research that bases the imputation of public health care expenditure on the insurance<lb/> value approach reports a significant effect in reducing inequality in the distribution of economic resources<lb/> (see <ref type="biblio">Marical et al., 2006 and 2008</ref> for an overview). A main reason is that health care spending is<lb/> concentrated on the elderly who, in general, have below-average cash incomes (<ref type="biblio">Gardiner et al. 1995</ref>).<lb/> <ref type="biblio">Smeeding et al. (2008)</ref> report results for seven OECD countries that confirm these findings.<lb/> 114.<lb/> Imputing the value of health care services increases disposable income by some 14% on average,<lb/> ranging from 11% in Poland, Australia and the Netherlands to 17% in Belgium, France and Sweden<lb/> (<ref type="figure">Figure 14</ref>). 32 In general, expenditures on women make up a slightly larger proportion than those on men.<lb/></p>

			<head>115</head>

			<p>.<lb/> The distribution of the income advantage deriving from health care is rather uniformly distributed<lb/> in the OECD countries (<ref type="figure">Figure 15</ref>). Somewhat higher shares going to the bottom quintile are found in the<lb/> United Kingdom and Australia, and shares somewhat below 18% in Q1 are found in <ref type="biblio">Luxembourg and<lb/> Hungary.<lb/> 32<lb/></ref> As in the case of education, the ranking of countries in terms of spending need not be the same as in<lb/> OECD, 2008c (Health at a Glance), which uses GDP as a denominator, whereas here disposable income is<lb/> used.<lb/></p>

On average, it falls from 0.30 to 0.27, with relatively low decreases in Norway, the<lb/> Netherlands, Poland and Italy and, contrasted to more important drops in countries like Belgium and<lb/> Portugal (see Figure 16 and Table A.6 in Annex).

			<head>117.<lb/></head>

			<p>Health care expenditures would reduce the poverty gap by 60% on average, which is even more<lb/> than education expenditures (<ref type="figure">Figure 17</ref>). The estimated reduction potential of around 80% is very high in<lb/> Portugal and France, and lower in Nordic countries and the Netherlands. As health care expenditures differ<lb/> between men and women, it is interesting to distinguish the poverty impact of expenditures on men and<lb/> women separately. In all countries, public health care expenditures on women have a far stronger poverty<lb/> reducing potential than expenditures on men. This is due to the relative position of women in the income<lb/> distribution, which is less favourable compared with that of men. The difference between men and women<lb/> is most striking in Estonia, Slovenia and the Czech Republic.<lb/></p>

			<head>4.7 The distributive impact of social housing 33<lb/></head>

			<p>119.<lb/> Previous studies (e.g. <ref type="biblio">Gardiner et al., 2005; Saunders and Siminski, 2005</ref>) suggest that social<lb/> housing is probably the category of government services that benefit the poor the most. However, its<lb/> overall impact is smaller than for health care and education because of the much lower amounts of<lb/> spending. Social housing represents on average merely half a percent of disposable income. Nevertheless<lb/> it is an important service for the beneficiaries. If the analysis is confined to reduced rent tenants (see last<lb/> column of <ref type="table">Table 8</ref>), social housing would increase their disposable income by 9% on average, with much<lb/> higher shares in the United Kingdom and Ireland 34 (more than 14%). But elsewhere too (Belgium, Spain,<lb/> Hungary and Italy), social housing represents more than 10% of disposable income for social renters. In<lb/> general and by design, the income-increasing effect of social housing is largely confined to the lower-<lb/>income quintiles – notable exceptions are the Czech Republic, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden.<lb/></p>

			<figure>33<lb/> Note that no estimates for social housing are available for Australia, Canada, Denmark, Mexico, the<lb/> Netherlands and the United States (see Chapter 3). Results for Greece and the Slovak Republic are only<lb/> illustrative, given the low number of cases in social housing.<lb/> 34<lb/> Note however that the overestimation of imputed rent in these two countries may play a role here, see<lb/> Chapter 3.<lb/> 0%<lb/> 10%<lb/> 20%<lb/> 30%<lb/> 40%<lb/> 50%<lb/> 60%<lb/> 70%<lb/> 80%<lb/> &lt;= 18 year<lb/> 18 -65 y<lb/> 65+ y<lb/> HC men<lb/> HC women<lb/></figure>

Share of beneficiaries of social housing (SH) and in-kind benefit from social housing as a share of<lb/> disposable income per quintile<lb/> Source: OECD Secretariat&apos;s computations from OECD/EU database on the distributional impact of in-kind services and national<lb/> survey data for non-EU countries.<lb/></table>

			<p>120.<lb/> The fact that social housing is often targeted at low income households is confirmed in the first<lb/> panel in <ref type="table">Table 8</ref> and in <ref type="figure">Figure 18</ref>. The share of beneficiaries decreases in all countries when moving up the<lb/> income ladder. For instance in the United Kingdom 36% of individuals in the bottom quintile live in social<lb/> housing, compared to less than 2% of the top quintile. But in other countries, 5 – 10 % of persons in the top<lb/> quintile live in social housing. It may be surprising that social housing is still present in the top quintile,<lb/> even when eligibility criteria include income ceilings. But often income ceilings apply at the moment of<lb/> entry; the social renters may meanwhile improve their income position over time without being obliged to<lb/> move to other housing. The share of social housing expenditures going to the bottom quintile is on average<lb/> 37%, whereas the share of the top quintile is around 9% (<ref type="figure">Figure 43</ref>). However, the share going to the<lb/> bottom quintile exceeds 50% in Belgium, the Slovak Republic and Ireland, and is only around 20% in<lb/> Austria, the Czech Republic and Greece.<lb/> 121.<lb/> The effect of social housing on overall inequality is rather limited. The Gini coefficient drops on<lb/> average with 1% (from 0.298 to 0.296) (see <ref type="table">Table A</ref>.6 in Annex 1)). Notable exceptions are Ireland and the<lb/> United Kingdom, with reductions of around 4%, which is closely linked to the size of the imputed benefit<lb/> in these countries.<lb/></p>

			<p>123.<lb/> Spending on early childhood education and childcare (ECEC) service can be important when<lb/> compared to household income, ranging from 0.4% (Ireland) to 5% (Sweden) (<ref type="figure">Figure 20</ref>). For countries<lb/> where both categories can be estimated, childcare expenditures are predominant in the Nordic countries<lb/> (2.3% in Finland and 2.2% in Norway). In the other countries pre-primary education carries the biggest<lb/> weight, with more than 2% in Hungary, Iceland, Spain and Slovenia.<lb/></p>

			<p>124.<lb/> The distribution of ECEC services over income groups varies greatly over countries (<ref type="figure">Figure 21</ref>).<lb/> In Hungary, Luxembourg, the Czech Republic, the United States and Canada, ECEC services tend to go<lb/> more to the poorer groups: the first quintile receives almost 30% and the top quintile less than 15%. The<lb/> opposite, i.e. a rather regressive distribution is observed in Estonia, Finland, Greece, Denmark and Ireland,<lb/> where the lowest quintile receives less than 15% of all ECEC services. These patterns reflect the<lb/> distribution of ECEC beneficiaries over quintiles (see <ref type="figure">Figure A</ref>.5 in Annex 1), resulting either from the<lb/> demographic pattern (i.e. more or less young children in the quintile), or from differential use of ECEC<lb/> services.<lb/> 35 A more detailed analysis of the distributive impact of ECEC services can be found in Förster and Verbist (2012).<lb/></p>

			<p>To explain such distinction between demographic patterns and differential use, it is useful to<lb/> study the composition ECEC users by income groups: are poorer or richer households more likely to enrol<lb/> their young children in public care services? The answer is provided in <ref type="table">Table 9</ref> and may be surprising at<lb/> first glance: in most countries, children in higher and top income households are more likely to be enrolled<lb/> in public child care than those in lower-income households. This difference is particularly stark in<lb/> Belgium, Poland, the United Kingdom, Ireland and the Slovak Republic. Only Canada, Czech Republic,<lb/> Estonia and Germany have relatively more children from low-income households enrolled in ECEC<lb/> Overall, more than two out of three children are enrolled in public child care in Belgium, Denmark,<lb/> Iceland, the Netherlands, Spain and Sweden. ECEC enrolment rates are lowest (below one third) in<lb/> Canada, Mexico, Poland and the United States.<lb/></p>

			<p>126.<lb/> ECEC services imputed into household income represent a higher share of disposable income for<lb/> poorer than for richer households. This pattern is most pronounced in Hungary, Iceland, Luxembourg,<lb/> Sweden and Spain. In some of these countries, these in-kind benefits even amount to around 10% of<lb/> disposable income in the bottom quintile. The share in the top quintile is much more limited, being around<lb/> 1% in the majority of the countries.<lb/> 127.<lb/> As a consequence, in all countries inequality as measured by Gini coefficient decreases when<lb/> including ECEC services in the income concept (see <ref type="table">Table</ref>			<figure>A.6 in Annex 1). On average, this decrease is<lb/> small with some 1.2%. Reductions are strongest in Hungary, Iceland and Luxembourg. 36 The other two<lb/> indicators (S80/S20 and P90/P10) give similar results.<lb/></figure>

			<p>128.<lb/> While this effect seems low with regard to the overall population, redistribution through childcare<lb/> services is much stronger when the focus is on children and, furthermore, beneficiaries. Förster and <ref type="biblio">Verbist<lb/> (2012)</ref> show that the reduction in overall income poverty is negligible when ECEC services are accounted<lb/> 36<lb/></p>

			<p>Though these are not the countries where the enrolment of low-income children is the highest, they have<lb/> the highest shares of beneficiaries of ECEC services in low-income households: the bottom 20% in<lb/> Hungary and Luxembourg, and the bottom 40% in Iceland.<lb/></p>

			<p>130.<lb/> Elderly care services represent less than 0.5% of disposable income in Germany, Estonia, Italy<lb/> and Slovenia but more than 2% in the Nordic countries and the Netherlands (<ref type="figure">Figure 23</ref>). Even though these<lb/> services benefit only a marginal proportion of the entire population, their redistributive impact can be<lb/> significant, given the high levels of spending per person. The Nordic countries report the highest levels,<lb/> which corresponds with their relatively high budget for this public service. For countries where a split<lb/> between home care and residential care is available, residential care is in general more important.<lb/></p>

			<head>5. THE DISTRIBUTIVE IMPACT OF PUBLIC SERVICES OVER TIME<lb/></head>

			<p>134.<lb/> How has the impact of public services evolved over time? For a sub-set of 17 OECD countries<lb/> the distributive impact of public services can be compared over time with the earlier estimates presented in<lb/> OECD (2008a) which referred to a year around 2000. As only health care, education and social housing<lb/> were considered in OECD (2008a), the comparison is limited to these three policy domains. For reasons of<lb/> consistency, the total of education comprises also pre-primary education 37 .<lb/> 135.<lb/> The importance of public services has increased over time for all the 18 countries considered: in<lb/> 2000 it amounted on average to 13% of GDP, whereas in 2007 it was 14% (<ref type="table">Table 10</ref>.). Especially in the<lb/> United Kingdom, the United States, Ireland and Greece, expenditures on public services became more<lb/> important. In half of the countries, expenditures remained more stable and increased by less than one<lb/> percentage point. Overall, especially public health care expenditures increased, whereas education<lb/> expenditures and spending on other services remained rather stable.<lb/></p>

			<figure>37<lb/> The calculations for 2000 in OECD (2008a) are based on ECHP for the fifteen EU countries, on HILDA<lb/> for Australia and on LIS-data for Canada and the United States. Results for Luxembourg are not entirely<lb/> comparable as education had not been imputed in 2000. Regarding social housing, no estimates were<lb/> possible in 2000 for Australia, Canada, Luxembourg, Sweden and the United States; in the most recent<lb/> year, no estimates are available for Australia, Canada, Denmark, the Netherlands and the United States.<lb/> Estimates of the value of social housing for 2007 use a correction for potential selection bias, which was<lb/> not done for the 2000 calculation.<lb/> 0%<lb/> 1%<lb/> 2%<lb/> 3%<lb/> 4%<lb/> 5%<lb/> 6%<lb/> 7%<lb/> 8%<lb/> 9%<lb/> 10%<lb/> LTC<lb/> Table 10. Evolution of public expenditures on in-kind transfers, in percentage of GDP, 2000 – 2007.<lb/> Source: OECD Social Expenditure database, OECD Education database, OECD Health database.<lb/></figure>

			<p>136.<lb/> Overall, the inequality impact of public services has remained remarkably stable: on average<lb/> across the OECD countries studied here, the Gini coefficient decreases by almost one fifth in both years<lb/> (<ref type="table">Table 11</ref>.). In one third of countries, inequality reduction has increased by more than two percentage<lb/> points (Belgium, Canada, Spain, Finland, United Kingdom, Ireland). In another third, the redistributive<lb/> impact has, however, fallen (Austria, Germany, Denmark, Italy, the Netherlands and Sweden) and in the<lb/> remaining third, changes were below two points (results for the interquintile share ratio are presented in<lb/> <ref type="table">Table A</ref>.6 in Annex 1).<lb/> 137.<lb/> In both years the distributive effect of health care services is the strongest inequality reducing<lb/> component on average with a reduction of 11% in both years. In some countries inequality reduction<lb/> through health care services increases (notably Belgium, Canada, Spain, the United Kingdom, Ireland and<lb/> Portugal), which are all countries that experienced an increase in their public health care expenditures. On<lb/> the contrary, in a number of countries the inequality impact of public health care has weakened (notably<lb/> Australia, Germany, Denmark, Greece, Italy and the Netherlands). The distributive impact of education has<lb/> rather decreased over time on average. Only in Belgium, Finland, Greece and Ireland has the inequality<lb/> reduction become stronger due to the inclusion of public education expenditures in the income concept.<lb/> Social housing has a small tendency of becoming more redistributive over time, but given that different<lb/> countries are involved and that the methodology differs somewhat for both years, it is difficult to draw<lb/> conclusions.<lb/></p>

			<p>There is a strong link between changes in the relative size of health, education and housing<lb/> services (expressed as share of disposable income) and changes in the effectiveness of these services to<lb/> reduce inequality across countries (<ref type="figure">Figure 26</ref>). 38 Belgium and the United Kingdom are two countries which<lb/> combine a considerable increase in spending with a large extent of inequality reduction.

			<head>5. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION<lb/></head>

			<p>139.<lb/> This paper looks at how the income distribution in countries changes when the value of publicly-<lb/>provided services to households is included. It considers five major categories of public services:<lb/> education, health care, social housing, childcare and elderly care. The empirical results in this study refer<lb/> to 2007 for Australia and the European countries, and to 2004 for Canada, Mexico and the United States.<lb/> Some comparisons with results for previous years around 2000 are also presented. The study also gives<lb/> appropriate weight to discussing the methodological underpinning of imputing such &quot; in-kind &quot; income and<lb/> the consequences of applying alternative definitions and concepts. In particular, two very recently<lb/> developed approaches to account for differences in needs are tested and compared. Finally, the results<lb/> presented in this study are novel not only with regard to time and country coverage but also by analyzing<lb/> the effect of particular services separately.<lb/></p>

			<head>5.1<lb/> Identifying the size of social public services<lb/></head>

			<p>140.<lb/> Public social services are social spending flows controlled by the General Government that can<lb/> be attributed to individual beneficiaries. Education and health care services are major categories under this<lb/> heading but also other social services, like those for childcare, elderly care, invalidity, etc. are relevant in<lb/> this context.<lb/> 141.<lb/> Spending on publicly-provided services accounts for about 13% of GDP on average across<lb/> OECD countries, slightly more than the spending on cash transfers. 39 But there is considerable variation<lb/> across countries. In most of the Nordic countries, Australia, Canada, Mexico, the Netherlands, Ireland, the<lb/> United Kingdom and the United States, spending on &quot; in-kind &quot; transfers is considerably higher than cash<lb/> transfer expenditures. On the contrary, cash transfers are more dominant than in-kind services in Austria,<lb/> Italy and Poland.<lb/> 142.<lb/> There is a large variation in the size of services across OECD countries. The shares of in-kind<lb/> services in GDP range from simple to double digits: from around 8% in Turkey and Chile to close to 20%<lb/> in Denmark and Sweden. On average, the bulk of these services is made up of health care and education<lb/> services, some 5 to 6 % of GDP each. The remaining 2% consist of care services to children and the<lb/> elderly and social housing.<lb/></p>

			<head>5.2<lb/> Valuating and allocating public services: methodological challenges<lb/></head>

			<p>143.<lb/> Before imputing the value of these services in household income and analyzing their<lb/> redistributive potential, the paper focuses in chapter 3 on the methodological challenges for empirically<lb/> investigating the distributive outcomes of including public services in an extended income concept. These<lb/> challenges include 1) the valuation of public services, 2) the allocation of these services (i.e. the<lb/> identification of beneficiaries), 3) the adjustment of the equivalence scale for needs associated with the<lb/> services, and 4) the specification of indicators to measure the poverty impact. For each of these challenges,<lb/> this report provides a contribution.<lb/></p>

			<head>39<lb/></head>

			<p>The public effort on this type of social services is, however, not fully captured, as policy domains like<lb/> public transportation and public utilities are not included.<lb/> 144.<lb/> With respect to the issue of valuation, the standard approach of using the value of producing or<lb/> providing the service is applied for all services included but one: for social housing, the value of the in-<lb/>kind benefit is derived from prevailing market rents. For allocating the value of a public service to<lb/> beneficiaries, two possible methodological approaches can be used. This study applies the &quot; actual use<lb/> approach &quot; as the preferred one for imputing education, early childhood education and childcare services<lb/> and for social housing. For conceptual reasons but also because actual users of health care and long-term<lb/> elderly care cannot be identified with the data used in this study, the &quot; insurance value approach &quot; is applied<lb/> for these latter two categories.<lb/> 145.<lb/> The third challenge relates to the fact that public services correspond to specific needs that are<lb/> not captured in the traditional equivalence scales used to correct cash disposable income for household size<lb/> and composition. Even though this problem has for long been recognized in the literature, most existing<lb/> studies apply the same equivalence scale for both cash and extended income. Recently, two innovative<lb/> approaches have been put forward in the literature to tackle this issue. Both use actual expenditures to<lb/> derive, on the one hand, an augmented equivalence scale that incorporates these needs (approach proposed<lb/> by <ref type="biblio">Aaberge et al. 2010</ref>) and to develop, on the other hand, a sensitivity analysis that takes account of<lb/> different public spending levels across countries (proposed by <ref type="biblio">Paulus et al., 2010</ref>).<lb/> 146.<lb/> This study applies both these approaches and compares the resulting estimates in order to test the<lb/> sensitivity of the results for alternative specifications of the equivalence scale. Results in terms of<lb/> redistributive effects based on the first approach are, however, not much different from the &quot; standard &quot; one,<lb/> i.e. using the square root of household size scale for both cash and extended income. Using the second<lb/> approach results in some cross-country variation of redistributive outcomes that are revealed by looking at<lb/> cash incomes only, though differences are not large. Consequently, the &quot; standard approach &quot; using the<lb/> square root of household size scale was used throughout this paper, for both cash and extended income.<lb/> 147.<lb/> With respect to the fourth challenge, an additional alternative way of capturing the possible<lb/> poverty impact of public services is proposed. The poverty reduction potential indicator shows what the<lb/> overall impact of in-kind benefits on poverty would be, given the current level and distribution of these<lb/> benefits and the current composition of the poor population. It gives an indication of the extent to which<lb/> these services might reduce the poverty gap if these in-kind benefits were given in cash to the<lb/> beneficiaries.<lb/></p>

			<head>5.3<lb/> The distributive impact of public services<lb/></head>

			<p>148.<lb/> Broadening the income concept to account for in-kind benefits considerably increases<lb/> households &quot; economic resources and impacts on inequality and poverty outcomes. If all social public<lb/> services were imputed in disposable cash income, households &quot; resources would increase by close to 30%,<lb/> on average. The increase exceeds 40% in Sweden and 30% in Denmark, Norway, Iceland, as well as in<lb/> France and Hungary. In a typical OECD country, the average annual household income would be close to<lb/> USD 28 000, rather than USD 22 000 in purchasing power parities when in-kind benefits are included.<lb/> 149.<lb/> Publicly-provided service benefits also contribute to reducing income inequality. Depending on<lb/> the indicator, in-kind benefits taken together reduce income inequality by one fifth (on the basis of the Gini<lb/> coefficient) to almost one third (when alternative inequality measures are used which give more weight to<lb/> the bottom and the top of the income distribution). The United Kingdom and, according to most inequality<lb/> measures, the United States, Mexico and Portugal achieve higher reduction rates while Slovenia records<lb/> lower ones. There is, however, no systematic relation between initial inequality levels in terms of cash<lb/> income and levels of inequality reduction through inclusion of in-kind benefits, but some high-inequality<lb/> countries record high reduction levels. The variation in inequality levels across OECD countries is<lb/> somewhat reduced when taking account of publicly provided services – but only when using more tail-<lb/>sensitive inequality measures such as quintile share or percentile ratios.<lb/> 150.<lb/> Imputing public services in household income also reduces poverty estimates to a considerable<lb/> amount. At-risk-of poverty rates fall substantially, by almost 40% when a &quot; floating &quot; poverty line is used<lb/> and even by close to 80% when a &quot; fixed &quot; poverty line is used. 40 Consequently, in-kind benefits taken<lb/> together would have the potential to reduce the poverty gap with on average 80%. The poverty impact is<lb/> larger than average for children and elderly, because of their higher use of education and health services.<lb/> 151.<lb/> Redistributive and poverty reduction effects differ between service categories. By their sheer<lb/> size, benefits from total education and health have by far the largest inequality reduction potential. The<lb/> impact of social housing is much more modest, due to the lower budgetary amounts. However, for<lb/> beneficiaries (social renters) this service can make a difference, especially as it is more targeted to low-<lb/>income groups. The same is true for child care services and long-term elderly care: small overall effects,<lb/> but important reductions for the groups concerned. Overall income poverty, for instance, hardly reduced<lb/> when childcare services are accounted for, but poverty among young children falls by one quarter and<lb/> poverty among children enrolled in childcare is more than halved.<lb/> 152.<lb/> Over the 2000s, the redistributive impact of public services has remained remarkably stable on<lb/> average across OECD countries. However, this impact got stronger in those countries where the share of<lb/> services in household income increased significantly, i.e. by more than four percentage points (e.g.<lb/> Belgium) and it weakened in those countries where this share strongly decreased (e.g. Italy).<lb/> 153.<lb/> Taken together, these findings suggest that publicly provided services fulfil an important<lb/> redistributive role in OECD societies. These effects are substantial also in some of the OECD countries<lb/> which record higher inequality levels on the basis of disposable household income only. More importantly,<lb/> redistributive effects are larger for some specific population groups at higher risk of poverty. This is all the<lb/> more noticeable as redistribution is not among the prime aims of delivering public services.<lb/> 154.<lb/> There are several issues which this study cannot address. Differences in the quality of services –<lb/> across but also within countries – is one of the most important among those. In order to materialise the<lb/> considerable redistributive potentials calculated in the analyses above, policies need to ensure that high-<lb/>quality health, education and care services are made available to all citizens. Moreover, in a dynamic<lb/> perspective, public childcare provision has a potential for secondary redistributive effects as childcare<lb/> allows both parents to work and hence helps increase family income. If such an increase is coupled with a<lb/> greater use of childcare by children from lower-income households this could reveal a considerable<lb/> inequality reduction potential among households with children.<lb/> 155.<lb/> Another issue not addressed in this study concerns the tax side of redistribution. As most of the<lb/> available studies, this report takes account of the effects of direct income taxation (income taxes and<lb/> employees &quot; social security contributions) but disregards the impact of indirect consumption taxes. It can be<lb/> expected that consumption taxation is not distributionally neutral and further work is necessary to estimate<lb/> their impact on household income in a cross-country comparative perspective. 41<lb/> 156.<lb/> At the time of writing, many OECD member countries are considering and implementing<lb/> consolidation policies in the aftermath of the financial and economic crisis. This paper provides a large<lb/> amount of background information which will be helpful in evaluating eventual distributive consequences<lb/> 40<lb/> A &quot; fixed &quot; poverty line uses the same poverty threshold for disposable cash and extended income, namely<lb/> 50% of the median disposable cash income. A &quot; floating &quot; poverty line recalculates the poverty threshold in<lb/> order to comprise both cash and in-kind elements. It thus captures the effect of the re-ranking of<lb/> individuals and the change in relative income differentials that may occur when moving from the cash<lb/> disposable income distribution to that of extended income.<lb/> when weighing measures which would impact on spending on particular transfers in cash or in publicly<lb/> provided services.<lb/></p>
