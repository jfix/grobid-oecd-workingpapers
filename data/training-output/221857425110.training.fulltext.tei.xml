			<figure>ECO/WKP(2009)60<lb/> IMPROVING THE FUNCTIONING OF THE SLOVENIAN LABOUR MARKET<lb/> by<lb/> Isabell Koske 1<lb/> Labour market performance has been improving…<lb/> 1.<lb/> Along with the strong economic growth of recent years, labour market performance has improved<lb/> markedly. Between 2003 and mid-2008 the employment rate increased by 5 percentage points to<lb/> around 69%. With labour force participation roughly constant throughout this period the rise in aggregate<lb/> employment was mainly reflected in a fall in the unemployment rate which came down from 6.7% in 2003<lb/> to 4.2% in mid-2008. In 2007 Slovenia had the lowest unemployment among the Central and East<lb/> European OECD countries (<ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>, panel A). Estimates of the NAIRU – the rate of unemployment<lb/> consistent with non-accelerating inflation – suggest that the fall in unemployment was mostly cyclical with<lb/> the unemployment rate falling substantially below the estimated level of the NAIRU, especially in 2007<lb/> and 2008 (<ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref> and Annex 1). This is in line with relatively high wage growth in these years. 2<lb/> Nonetheless, the beneficial effects of the economic upswing seem to have been reinforced by important<lb/> structural reforms (<ref type="biblio">Box 1</ref>) that have been associated with a gradual decline in the NAIRU over time.<lb/> 2.<lb/> Although aggregate employment is close to the OECD average of 70%, 3 large disparities remain<lb/> across different age groups and across groups of different educational attainment. While employment rates<lb/> are around the OECD average for men aged 30 to 49 and well above the OECD average for women in that<lb/> age group, they are very low for the elderly, reflecting low participation rates (<ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>, panel B). In 2007<lb/> only 47% of those aged 55 to 59 and only 17% of those aged 60 to 64 participated in the labour force<lb/> compared with OECD averages of respectively 66% and 43%. The low participation of older age cohorts is<lb/> mirrored in low effective age retirement ages of around 60⅔ years for men and 57½ years for women.</p>

			<head>Recent labour market reforms<lb/></head>

			<p>Slovenia has implemented several reforms of the labour code in recent years aimed at increasing the flexibility of<lb/> its labour market. This was necessary not least to improve the country&apos;s ability to cope with asymmetric shocks in the<lb/> euro area that cannot be dealt with by the common monetary policy. This box briefly outlines the main reforms that<lb/> have been undertaken since 1997, when the OECD&apos;s only other Economic Survey of Slovenia was published.<lb/></p>

			<head>Regulation of employment contracts<lb/></head>

			<p>In 1998, amendments to the Employment and Insurance against Unemployment Act (EIUA) licensed the<lb/> operation of temporary work agencies and thus contributed notably to a liberalisation of temporary employment. More<lb/> flexibility in the area of regular employment was introduced by the 2003 Employment Relationships Act (ERA) which<lb/> shortened notice periods, reduced the levels of severance pay and relaxed regulations on collective dismissals, but put<lb/> additional restrictions on temporary work. More recently, the establishment of specialised temporary work agencies<lb/> was made easier through amendments to the EIUA adopted in 2006.<lb/> 1 The 2007 amendments to the ERA expanded<lb/> the possibilities for fixed-term contracts,<lb/> 2 exempted contracts for project work from the two-year time limit for temporary<lb/> employment, and facilitated the termination of regular work contracts by further shortening notice periods in case of<lb/> termination due to business reasons (to 30 days for less than 5 years of tenure, 45 days for at least 5 years of tenure,<lb/> 60 days for at least 15 years of tenure and 120 days for at least 25 years of tenure) and exempting employers from the<lb/> obligation to pay severance pay if the employer or the Employment Service offers the employee an employment<lb/> contract with another employer during the notice period and the employee concludes this contract. The amount of<lb/> severance pay remained unchanged at one-fifth of the average monthly wage during the last three months before the<lb/> termination of the contract for each year of employment, if the worker has been employed for more than one and up to<lb/> five years (one-fourth if employed for 5 to 15 years and one-third if employed for more than 15 years).<lb/></p>

			<head>Duration and level of unemployment benefits<lb/></head>

			<p>The amended EIUA adopted in 1998 cut the potential period of entitlement to unemployment benefits for some<lb/> groups of the unemployed (to 3 months for insurance up to 5 years, to 6 months for insurance of 5 to 15 years, to<lb/> 9 months for insurance of 15 to 25 years and to 12 months [18 months if the insured person is older than 50 years and<lb/> 24 months if the person is older than 55 years] for insurance of over 25 years). 3 In 2006, stricter rules were introduced<lb/> regarding the obligations of unemployed: they are obliged to actively search for employment and after three<lb/> (six) months of unemployment they have to accept a job offer from the Employment Service for which the education is<lb/> one level (two levels) below the education level of the unemployed person. If the unemployed person does not comply<lb/> with these rules the cash benefit is cut in half for a period of two months. The level of unemployment benefits has not<lb/> changed since the last Economic Survey and amounts to 70% of the average monthly salary received in the 12 months<lb/> prior to unemployment for the first three months and to 60% in the subsequent months. The minimum (maximum)<lb/> benefit is equal to 0.46 (1.37) times the minimum wage. Unemployment assistance was abolished in 2006. Instead, the<lb/> unemployed can get means-tested social assistance after the expiration of unemployment benefits.<lb/></p>

			<head>ECO/WKP(2009)60<lb/> Labour taxation<lb/></head>

			<p>The rates of payroll tax were gradually reduced between 2006 and 2008 and the tax was completely phased out<lb/> in January 2009, considerably reducing unit labour costs. Furthermore, reforms of the personal income tax led to a<lb/> reduction in the number and level of tax rates. In 2005, the number of tax rates was cut from six (from 17% to 50%) to<lb/> five (from 16% to 50%) and in 2007, the number was further reduced to three (16%, 27% and 41%). In 2008, the level<lb/> of general and special personal income tax allowances was raised, lowering the tax burden, in particular for low<lb/> income earners, and special allowances were reduced and simplified.<lb/></p>

			<head>Wage bargaining<lb/></head>

			<p>In 2006, the Collective Agreements Act came into force and introduced significant changes to the system of<lb/> collective bargaining. The Act regulates the parties, scope and hierarchy of collective agreements, and the procedure<lb/> of conclusion and termination of the collective agreement as well as its validity. The Act does not provide for the<lb/> mandatory conclusion of collective agreements or the mandatory content, nor does it determine the types of collective<lb/> agreements and the level of their conclusion. The main novelties introduced by the Act include the principle of<lb/> voluntary conclusion, the possibility of subsequent accession to concluded collective agreements, the restriction of the<lb/> validity of collective agreements to the parties that concluded it or their members, and the regulation that the collective<lb/> agreement that is most favourable to workers should apply if an employer is bound by more than one collective<lb/> agreement of the same type. Wages are limited downwards by the Minimum Wage Act, introduced in 2006. According<lb/> to the Act the minimum wage is determined once a year by the Minister of Labour based on the forecast of consumer<lb/> price inflation, after consulting the social partners.<lb/></p>

			<head>Active labour market policy<lb/></head>

			<p>Slovenia&apos;s expenditure on active labour market policies (ALMP) amounted to around 0.22% of gross domestic<lb/> product (GDP) in 2008, part of which is financed by the European Social Fund. At the end of 2006, new guidelines for<lb/> ALMP were adopted within the Active Labour Market Policy Programme for the period 2007–13. The programme<lb/> envisages measures in four areas: i) counselling and assistance for employment; ii) training and education;<lb/> iii) promotion of employment and self-employment; and iv) programmes for increasing social inclusion. The programme<lb/> is complemented by action plans which are confirmed by the government for each budget period. New ALMP<lb/> envisaged for 2009 include a subsidy programme to promote employment of young people with tertiary education and<lb/> of older and long-term unemployed persons; the promotion of part-time work; and education and training programmes<lb/> for unemployed who wish to become self-employed and for employees of micro and small firms and of firms with<lb/> subsidised full-time employment.<lb/></p>

			<head>Organisation of working time<lb/></head>

			<p>Some measures have been taken to facilitate the reconciliation of work and private life, for example by granting<lb/> parents the right to work fewer hours. The 2007 amendments to the ERA introduced possibilities for longer overtime<lb/> work and, so as to make part-time work more attractive to employers, defined the principle of proportionality of rights of<lb/> part-time employees with respect to the number of working hours. The amended Prevention of Illegal Work and<lb/> Employment Act opened employment possibilities for short-term and small work by considering it as declared work.<lb/> 4<lb/></p>

			<head>Migration<lb/> In 2001, a new Employment and Work of Aliens Act</head>

			<p>came into force, providing for a comprehensive regulation of<lb/> all forms of work by foreigners (excluding citizens of all EU member countries) in a single Act. The Act specifies<lb/> different types of work permits 5 according to the aim and the duration of employment and regulates the number of<lb/> foreigners allowed to enter the Slovenian labour market (the annual quota is set by the government, though it may not<lb/> exceed 5% of the actively working population). In 2005, conditions were tightened for self-employed foreigners (the<lb/> requirement of one year of prior residence in Slovenia was introduced) whereas they were relaxed for seasonal<lb/> workers. In 2007, the Act was amended to simplify procedures for workers from occupations facing labour shortages.<lb/> __________________<lb/> 1. Such agencies can now acquire the right to provide temporary work only by entry in the registry of agencies providing temporary<lb/> work and do not have to conclude a concession contract as other employment agencies have to do.<lb/> 2. In particular, the amendments expanded the possibilities for temporary work contracts to cases where none of the applicants<lb/> fulfils the required conditions for the job, employment of managers and employment on projects.<lb/></p>

			<p>3. The cut in benefit duration had a sizable positive effect on the exit rate out of unemployment at all lengths of the unemployment<lb/> benefit duration (Ours, J.C. van and M. Vodopivec <ref type="biblio">[2006]</ref>, &quot; How Shortening the Potential Duration of Unemployment Benefits<lb/> Affects the Duration of Unemployment: Evidence from a Natural Experiment &quot; , Journal of Labor Economics, Vol. 24, No. 2,<lb/> University of Chicago Press, Chicago), though it did not reduce job match quality (Ours, J.C. van and M. Vodopivec <ref type="biblio">[2008]</ref>, &quot; Does<lb/> Reducing Unemployment Insurance Generosity Reduce Job Match Quality &quot; , Journal of Public Economics, Vol. 92, No. 3-4,<lb/> Elsevier BV, Amsterdam).<lb/> ECO/WKP(2009)60<lb/> 4. Short-term work is unpaid work in micro firms or private institutions by the spouse of the owner or a person to whom he/she is<lb/> related to in the first degree, and which lasts 40 hours a month at the most. Small work lasts not more than 20 hours a week and<lb/> not more than 40 hours a month, while payment does not exceed 50%</table>

			<p>of the minimum wage, and is carried out by a person who<lb/> is not in full-time employment, who does not pursue an independent activity and who does not receive a pension.<lb/> 5. Three different types of work permits exist: personal work permits, employment permits and permits for work. A personal work<lb/> permit is issued on the application of a foreigner who has a temporary or permanent residence permit and who has lived in<lb/> Slovenia for at least one year, and grants free access to the Slovenian labour market. An employment permit is issued upon the<lb/> request of an employer, provided that he meets all necessary conditions, including the provision that hiring a foreigner does not<lb/> adversely affect the domestic unemployment situation. A permit for work allows a foreigner to work in Slovenia for a limited period<lb/> of time defined in advance based on the purpose for which the permit is issued (e.g. seasonal work, managerial work).<lb/></p>

			<head>3.<lb/></head>

			<p>The employment rates of those aged 15 to 24 are also lower than in the average OECD country<lb/> (<ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>, panel B), reflecting a high participation of youth in education and a longer duration of education.<lb/> The unemployment rate of those aged 15 to 24 has fallen considerably in the past years, coming down from<lb/> 15% in 2003 to below 10% in 2008 (<ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>, panel C). Particularly lower-skilled youth (without upper<lb/> secondary education) benefited from this development. Favourable economic conditions as well as active<lb/> policy measures to integrate the youth into the labour market are the main factors behind the decline in<lb/> youth unemployment. In addition, the fact that smaller generations of young people are entering the labour<lb/> market due to the ageing process may have contributed to this development. While unemployment is still<lb/> much more prevalent among the youth than among other age groups, Slovenia performs better than many<lb/> other OECD economies (<ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>, panel D).<lb/> 4.<lb/> Along with the decline in overall unemployment, the pool of long-term unemployed has also<lb/> been reduced in recent years. Past labour market reforms such as the tightening of eligibility criteria for<lb/> unemployment benefits and active labour market policies (ALMP) aimed at upgrading the skills of those<lb/> unemployed, who are unable to return directly from unemployment to a new job, are likely to have<lb/> contributed to this development (Box 1). Nonetheless, the share of long-term unemployed in total<lb/> unemployed remains well above the OECD average (<ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>, panel E). As older workers benefited less<lb/> from the recent fall in long-term unemployment than other groups, they now account for a higher share of<lb/> long-term unemployed than before the economic upswing (<ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>, panel F).<lb/></p>

			<head>… but challenges remain<lb/></head>

			<p>5.<lb/> The substantial and welcome progress in improving labour market outcomes notwithstanding,<lb/> challenges remain in specific areas. In the short term the main challenge will be to cope with rising<lb/> unemployment due to the global economic crisis. The government has adopted a number of measures to<lb/> safeguard jobs and contain the rise in unemployment within the fiscal package adopted in February 2009.<lb/> Whilst such initiatives are vital under current circumstances, it is important that they are well designed and<lb/> do not harm economic growth in the long run. In this respect, the subsidy scheme for shorter working<lb/> hours should be phased out once the crisis dissipates. In the meantime, eligibility should be temporary in<lb/> nature as is the case in several other OECD countries such as Germany (Box 2). Moreover, any measures<lb/> that are detrimental to the functioning of the labour market should be avoided. tightening the rules for<lb/> immigrant workers during the crisis in order to maintain jobs for Slovenian citizens would be the wrong<lb/> way to go as immigrant workers are needed in the longer run to address skill mismatches in the domestic<lb/> labour market.<lb/> 6.<lb/> It is also important to look beyond the short-term horizon and reflect on the structural problems<lb/> of the labour market. As stressed by <ref type="biblio">Høj et al. (2006)</ref>, structural reforms are sometimes easier to<lb/> implement in times of economic crises because bad economic conditions make it clearer that existing<lb/> policies are no longer sustainable, either for individual citizens or for the economy. On the other hand, the<lb/> political opposition to reforms in certain specific labour market areas (for example, employment protection<lb/> legislation) is likely to be stronger during economic downturns as workers are already suffering from high<lb/> unemployment. It therefore seems expedient to proceed rapidly with reforms that are not costly under<lb/> ECO/WKP(2009)60<lb/> current circumstances but have beneficial effects in the long run (such as a reform of the pension system)<lb/> while delaying reforms that face strong opposition due to the crisis until the next economic upswing. On<lb/> the whole, three main areas stand out where further reform is needed (by the importance of issues and<lb/> hence suggested priority for policy makers):<lb/></p>

			<p>• Labour force participation rates among the elderly are very low by international standards.<lb/></p>

			<p>• Despite recent increases, the employment rates of younger age cohorts remain relatively low,<lb/> partly reflecting a long time in completing education.<lb/> • The share of temporary employment has been rising quickly, especially among youth, which<lb/> risks creating a dual labour market.<lb/></p>

			<head>Box 2. The German subsidy scheme for shorter working hours<lb/></head>

			<p>The subsidy scheme for shorter working hours is meant to reduce the labour costs of companies that are in<lb/> temporary distress. Companies are eligible for the subsidy if they face a major drop in orders due to economic reasons<lb/> or extraordinary events, provided the drop in orders is temporary in nature. More than one-third of the employees must<lb/> lose at least 10% of their gross wage for the company to be eligible, though this condition is suspended from<lb/> February 2009 to December 2010 (instead, the subsidy can only be paid to employees who lose more than 10% of<lb/> their gross wage). The scheme can only be introduced if it is agreed in a collective agreement, a company agreement<lb/> or the working contract of the individual employee. If a work council is active in the company it also has to agree to the<lb/> implementation of the scheme. Employees participating in the scheme have to accept a cut in their monthly income as<lb/> the State only pays 60% of the forgone net wage (67% if the employee has children).* Contributions to pension, health<lb/> and care insurance are paid on 80% of the foregone income with the employers paying all of it, i.e. not only their share<lb/> but also the employees&apos; share (part of the payments are currently refunded as part of the government&apos;s fiscal stimulus<lb/> package). The maximum duration of eligibility is generally limited to 6 months, though it has recently been extended to<lb/> 24 months for all employees that become eligible before the end of 2009. Since end 2008, the scheme may also be<lb/> used for workers of temporary work agencies.<lb/> _____________<lb/> * Some collective agreements stipulate that the benefits paid by the State are to be extended by the employer.<lb/></p>

			<head>Boosting the labour force participation of the elderly<lb/></head>

			<p>7.<lb/> The employment rates of older persons have increased markedly over the past decade. The<lb/> increase was particularly strong for persons aged 55 to 59, owing to the effects of the 1999 pension reform<lb/> as well as to demographic effects as the early-retirement generation from the early 1990s is leaving this age<lb/> group. Between 1997 and 2008, the employment rate of this age group rose by around 17%, reaching<lb/> slightly more than 45% in the third quarter of 2008. However, despite this progress the employment rate is<lb/> still the third-lowest in the OECD (<ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>). The employment rate of persons aged 60 to 64 is also<lb/> amongst the lowest in the OECD and, due to rising employment rates in many other OECD countries, has<lb/> even fallen further behind the OECD average in recent years. The low employment rates of older persons<lb/> are mirrored by a low effective retirement age (<ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>). Men retire about three years earlier in Slovenia<lb/> than in the average OECD country whilst for women the difference is as much as five years. 5 The low<lb/> effective retirement age, together with rapid population ageing (<ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref>), puts pressure on the growth of<lb/> public expenditure for old-age pensions and at the same time limits the growth potential of the economy<lb/> through a shrinking labour force. To avoid these negative effects it is essential that steps are taken to boost<lb/> the labour force participation of the elderly.<lb/> 5.<lb/> The effective retirement ages shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>.4 are estimated based on Labour Force Survey (LFS) data<lb/> to be comparable across countries. The figures for Slovenia are somewhat higher than those published by<lb/> the Institute of Pension and Invalidity Insurance of Slovenia (<ref type="biblio">ZPIZ, 2008</ref>) which are based on the actual<lb/> age of the persons applying for pension benefits in a given year. A possible explanation for the difference<lb/> is that some persons are officially retired but continue working in the informal sector. As the LFS considers<lb/> these persons as employed, such informal employment pushes up the estimated effective retirement age.<lb/></p>

			<figure>Figure 4. Average effective age of retirement versus the official age<lb/> 1<lb/> 2002-07<lb/> 1.<lb/></figure>

			<p>The average effective age of retirement is defined as the average age of exit from the labour force during a 5-year period.<lb/> Labour force (net) exits are estimated by taking the difference in the participation rate for each 5-year age group (40 and over)<lb/> at the beginning of the period and the rate for the corresponding age group aged 5-years older at the end of the period. The<lb/> official age corresponds to the age at which a pension can be received irrespective of whether a worker has a long insurance<lb/> record of years of contributions. For Italy, workers can retire at age 57 (56 for manual workers) with 35 years of contributions.<lb/> For Slovenia, the official retirement age of 61 years for women will be reached in</p>

			<p>8.<lb/> Work and retirement decisions are highly complex and depend on a range of institutional settings<lb/> as well as the socio-demographic characteristics of the individual (OECD, 2006a; <ref type="biblio">Vodopivec and Dolenc,<lb/> 2009</ref>). First, so-called &quot; pull &quot; factors, associated primarily with financial incentives embedded in public<lb/> pension and early retirement schemes, are &quot; pulling &quot; older workers into retirement and thus play an<lb/> important role in determining retirement decisions (e.g. <ref type="biblio">Burniaux et al., 2003; Duval, 2003; Burtless,<lb/> 2009</ref>). The decisions will be influenced by the age at which benefits can first be claimed, the generosity of<lb/> replacement rates and the accessibility of informal paths to early retirement through unemployment,<lb/> disability and long-term sickness insurance programmes. Second, so-called &quot; push &quot; factors, which<lb/> determine the available set of job opportunities open to older workers, are &quot; pushing &quot; workers into<lb/> retirement. The job opportunities depend for example on the age profile of labour costs relative to<lb/> productivity, employers&apos; perception about the capacities of older workers, and the strictness of<lb/> employment protection legislation (EPL). In addition, inflexible working time arrangement might be<lb/> pushing workers into early retirement (e.g. <ref type="biblio">Gustman and Steinmeier, 2004</ref>).<lb/> 9.<lb/> Past reforms of the labour code as well as the pension and education system have influenced<lb/> these push and pull factors in the right direction, leading to a significant improvement in both work<lb/> incentives and employment opportunities of older people. Examples include the gradual increase in the<lb/> statutory retirement age, the introduction of ALMP tailored specifically to the needs of the elderly such as<lb/> tax reliefs and exemptions from social security contributions for employers who hire older persons, and the<lb/> launch of a wide range of adult education programmes. However, the recent progress notwithstanding,<lb/> more needs to be done to encourage the elderly to remain active. In particular, retirement needs to be made<lb/> financially less attractive for older persons by further raising the statutory retirement age and adjusting the<lb/> financial incentives for early/late retirement, and the employment prospects of the elderly have to be<lb/> improved to ensure that those wishing to work longer also find appropriate jobs.<lb/></p>

			<head>Further raising the retirement age<lb/></head>

			<p>10.<lb/> Although the retirement age has already been raised by the pension reform adopted in 1999 there<lb/> is room for a further increase. The retirement age (the age at which persons can retire once they have<lb/> completed a pension qualifying period of 20 years) has been raised from 58 years to 63 years for men and<lb/> from 53 years to 61 years for women. While the increase was implemented rather quickly for men at a rate<lb/> ECO/WKP(2009)60<lb/> of 6 months per year, the increase proceeds at just 4 months per year for women. 6 This implies that the<lb/> envisaged retirement age of 61 years will not be reached before 2023. The age limits for retirement with a<lb/> pension qualifying period of respectively 38 years (58 years of age) and 15 years (65 years of age) are also<lb/> raised by a mere 4 months per year. Several countries from Central and Eastern Europe, that had similarly<lb/> low retirement ages for women before they reformed their pension systems, implemented the changes at a<lb/> much faster pace. For example, Bulgaria, Estonia, Hungary and Latvia opted for an increase of 6 months<lb/> per year (12 months every second year in the case of Hungary) and in the Slovak Republic the retirement<lb/> age is even raised at a rate of 9 months per year. In light of the negative effects of the rapid ageing of the<lb/> Slovenian population on public finances, as well as potential economic growth, the increase in the<lb/> pensionable age for women should be phased-in faster.<lb/> 11.<lb/> Even after the 1999 pension reform is fully phased-in, the pensionable age is low by OECD<lb/> standards (<ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref>). The majority of OECD countries currently have a retirement age of 65 years for both<lb/> genders and many of them are planning further increases along with gains in life expectancy. As life<lb/> expectancy in Slovenia is similar to other OECD countries, the lower retirement age implies a higher life<lb/> expectancy at retirement (particularly for women), putting strong pressure on pension costs on the one<lb/> hand and depriving the labour market of valuable resources on the other. The authorities should therefore<lb/> further increase the pensionable age for both genders. Once the increase has been phased-in and life<lb/> expectancy at the full pensionable age has reached a suitable level, additional increases in the pensionable<lb/> age should be linked to gains in life expectancy. The length of the pension qualifying period necessary to<lb/> retire at the minimum pensionable age should be raised accordingly. Moreover, the conditions for women<lb/> should be lined up over time with those for men.<lb/></p>

			<p>was the introduction<lb/> of a comprehensive bonus/penalty system to reward deferral of retirement beyond the pensionable age and<lb/> penalise retirement prior to that age. However, the size of the bonuses and penalties appears relatively<lb/> small and might not provide sufficient incentives for remaining active. 7 In addition, the new Act provides<lb/> several possibilities for individuals to retire prior to the pensionable age without being subject to a penalty.<lb/> First, the pensionable age can be reduced progressively for persons with children (by 8 months for one<lb/> child, by 20 months for two, by 36 months for three and by another 20 months for each additional child). 8<lb/> Second, for women who subscribe to compulsory pension insurance prior to the age of 18, the pensionable<lb/> age is lowered by the duration of insurance prior to that age. 9 Third, insured persons can retire before the<lb/> full pensionable age (provided they have completed a pension qualifying period of 20 years) under special<lb/> conditions such as long-term unemployment, redundancy programmes, programmes allowing the employer<lb/> to replace the insured person by a younger unemployed person, or the bankruptcy of the employer.<lb/> 13.<lb/> Such options for early retirement considerably reduce the actual age at which persons retire.<lb/> Estimates of the median retirement age for the period 2002-07 based on Labour Force Survey data indicate<lb/> that half of all men (women) retired before the age of 56.3 (52.5), which is markedly below the full<lb/> pensionable age prevailing at that time. From a labour supply perspective, there is thus a large pool of still<lb/> relatively young persons whose human capital is lost due to very early retirement. While it appears<lb/> reasonable to allow for some flexibility in the retirement decision to be made by the individual based on<lb/> personal preferences, the design of the pension system must not encourage early retirement. The authorities<lb/> should therefore ensure that the penalties/bonuses for early/late retirement are actuarially neutral, so that<lb/> the change in pension benefits from working one additional year is equal to the entitlement earned in that<lb/> year and, conversely, retiring a year earlier reduces the pension benefit both by the entitlement that would<lb/> have been earned during the year and by an amount to reflect the longer duration for which the pension<lb/> must be paid. 10 The upper limit on the number of additional working years beyond the statutory retirement<lb/> age during which bonuses are paid (currently set at three years) should be abolished. In addition, the<lb/> possibility to retire prior to the pensionable age for special reasons such as the upbringing of children,<lb/> entry into compulsory insurance before the age of 18, long-term unemployment or bankruptcy of the<lb/> employer should be phased out.<lb/> 14.<lb/> Raising the statutory retirement age and closing formal pathways to early retirement (or making<lb/> them less attractive) might encourage individuals to switch to informal early retirement schemes, such as<lb/> disability, long-term sickness and unemployment. Since the 1999 pension reform, the share of inactive<lb/> persons aged 50 to 64 who do not seek employment due to disability or sickness has risen markedly, from<lb/> 6% in 2000 to 22% in 2007. The share has also increased for other age groups, albeit by a much smaller<lb/> amount, indicating that disability and sickness benefits are increasingly used by the elderly to withdraw<lb/> early from the labour force. The authorities should review the disability and long-term sickness insurance<lb/> schemes to ensure that eligibility conditions are sufficiently tight and adequately monitored.<lb/> 7.<lb/> In 2007, 829 persons claimed a higher pension due to late retirement compared with an increase in the<lb/></p>

In<lb/> mid-2008</table>

			<p>the unemployment rate of 50-64 year-olds stood at around 3½ per cent, more than half a<lb/> percentage point below the aggregate rate. However, there is a risk that this pathway becomes more<lb/> popular in the future along with further increases in the retirement age and stricter controls on disability<lb/> and sickness benefit recipients. To prevent this from happening, the generosity of the scheme should be<lb/> reduced further for older people. Currently, older workers with an insurance history of 15 to 25 years are<lb/> eligible for benefits during respectively 18 months (if they are older than 50 years) and 24 months (if they<lb/> are older than 55 years) whereas workers below the age of 50 receive benefits for 12 months. As a result,<lb/> the incidence of unemployment benefits is highly skewed in favour of older workers. The authorities<lb/> should reduce the length of unemployment benefit duration for long-term unemployed older workers<lb/> towards the general length of 12 months, once the current economic crisis dissipates.<lb/></p>

			<figure>16.<lb/> Work decisions may also be influenced by the degree to which an individual&apos;s pension benefits<lb/> are linked to the entire working career in terms of length and level of earnings. If pension benefits are<lb/> calculated based on a finite number of best years, older workers might be encouraged to exit from the<lb/> workforce, particularly if they do not expect any further increases in earnings or have to accept earnings<lb/> cuts to stay employed. Since 2008, pension benefits in Slovenia are based on the 18 best consecutive years<lb/> (the assessment period had been gradually increased from 10 years in 2000 after the passage of the 1999<lb/> PDIA). The link between pension benefits and working careers could be strengthened further by basing<lb/> benefits on full lifetime average earnings as is done in most OECD countries (OECD, 2007).<lb/></figure>

			<head>Making partial retirement more attractive<lb/></head>

			<p>17.<lb/> Inflexible working time arrangements may discourage older workers from continuing to work<lb/> longer due to difficulties in reconciling work with family life. This may result in a cliff-edge pattern of<lb/> retirement with older workers shifting instantly from working full-time to not working at all (OECD,<lb/> 2006a). Such an abrupt departure from the full-time career job may actually not be the preferred path to<lb/> retirement for many workers; they would prefer to gradually reduce their work commitments over a period<lb/> of time. Rigidities to a gradual exit from the labour market may result, first from barriers to part-time work<lb/> in general (as shown in panel A of <ref type="figure">Figure 7</ref> those countries with a higher incidence of part-time<lb/> employment tend to have higher overall labour force participation of the elderly), and second from<lb/> constraints on the right to draw all or part of a pension while continuing to work at the same time. In<lb/> Slovenia, individuals are not allowed to be retired and work at the same time, though it is possible to retire<lb/> partially which means receiving half of one&apos;s pension and continue working half-time (or less). Yet, the<lb/> possibility of partial retirement is hardly used; at the end of 2007, only 184 persons retired in such a way<lb/> (<ref type="biblio">IMAD, 2008a</ref>), which is less than 2% of new old-age pension recipients.<lb/> 18.<lb/> Restrictions on part-time work in general are unlikely to be the main explanation for the low<lb/> number of partial retirees. Although the share of workers aged 50 to 64 working part-time falls short of the<lb/> levels seen in most OECD countries (<ref type="figure">Figure 7</ref>, panel B) and has not increased in recent years, the number<lb/> of such jobs has risen among other age groups, most notably the young (<ref type="figure">Figure 7</ref>, panel C), not least thanks<lb/> to some progress in liberalizing working-time arrangements (Box 1). 11 It thus seems more likely that<lb/> factors related to the partial retirement scheme itself are at the root of its low popularity.<lb/> 19.<lb/> The rules on partial retirement are indeed such that the scheme does not appear very attractive.<lb/> First, the conditions for partial retirement are very tight as it requires the fulfilment of the conditions for<lb/> 11.<lb/> The rise was particularly strong in 2003, which may be related to the acceleration in economic growth and,<lb/> in the case of women, to the right to work reduced hours introduced by the Parental Protection and Social<lb/> Benefit Act (IMAD, 2008a). Moreover, a large share of those aged 15 to 24 in part-time employment is<lb/> student workers.<lb/> ECO/WKP(2009)60<lb/> full retirement and the consent of the employer. Moreover, the partial retiree is allowed to work on a half-<lb/>time basis at the most and will receive one-half of the old-age pension to which he is entitled. Second,<lb/> partial retirement is financially not very attractive as the pension income is taxed as regular income<lb/> (although the pension already represents net income taxed through the translation of the gross pension<lb/> basis to the net pension basis) and the wage income is subject to social security contributions. Whilst the<lb/> contributions to pension insurance translate into a higher replacement rate upon full retirement,<lb/> contributions for health and unemployment insurance act essentially as a tax since individuals who meet<lb/> the criteria for retirement are not eligible for unemployment benefits and since health insurance<lb/> contributions for full retirees are paid for by the Institute of Pension and Invalidity Insurance of Slovenia.<lb/></p>

At the<lb/> very least, the rules for partial retirement should be relaxed and the tax disincentives should be phased out.<lb/> In particular, there is no need to demand the consent of the employer for partial retirement, if EPL is<lb/> sufficiently flexible (see below). While easing barriers to part-time work and partial retirement may lead to<lb/> an increase in the participation of older people, the net impact on effective labour supply will be smaller or<lb/> even negative since some workers, who prior to the change would have continued working full-time, will<lb/> also reduce their hours worked (e.g. <ref type="biblio">Gustman and Steinmeier, 2004</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<head>Raising the demand for older workers<lb/></head>

			<p>21.<lb/> Whilst removing incentives for early retirement and facilitating gradual exits from the labour<lb/> force will help increase the labour supply of older workers, it does not guarantee that the increase in supply<lb/> is matched by a corresponding increase in demand. The demand for older workers may be limited due to<lb/> negative perceptions on the side of employers about the capacities of older workers to adapt to<lb/> technological or organisational changes and due to wage-setting practices that let labour costs rise more<lb/> steeply with age than productivity. These issues have to be addressed in order to ensure that those people<lb/> who wish to work longer also find appropriate jobs.<lb/> 22.<lb/> To counter negative employer attitudes, several OECD countries have launched information<lb/> campaigns and introduced legislation that bans age discrimination in employment (see OECD, 2006a,<lb/> <ref type="table">Table 5</ref>.1 for an overview on the adopted measures). The two approaches are complementary: age-<lb/>discrimination legislation may be less effective if not accompanied by information campaigns and<lb/> guidelines to help employers implement good practices and to make older workers aware of their rights; at<lb/> the same time, information campaigns and guidelines may not be very effective if not backed by sanctions<lb/> for discrimination on the grounds of age (OECD, 2006a). Slovenia banned age discrimination in 2003<lb/> when the Employment Relationships Act was adopted. The legislation was amended in 2007 to define the<lb/> sanctions in more detail and to shift the burden of proof towards the employer. A special information<lb/> campaign to promote the employment of older workers is planned for 2009. The campaign should create<lb/> awareness of the benefits of an age-diverse workforce where older workers share the benefits of their<lb/> greater work experience with younger workers who in turn share their knowledge of new production<lb/> techniques and ways of working with older workers. Emphasising age diversity rather than pointing out the<lb/> needs of older workers reduces the risk that they become a stigmatised group. Prominent examples of<lb/> information campaigns include the UK Age Positive campaign and the Finnish information campaign that<lb/> was launched as part of the Finnish National Programme on Ageing Workers (see OECD, 2006a, Box 5.1<lb/> and 6.5).<lb/> 23.<lb/> Employers might also be reluctant to hire or retain older workers because they cost too much<lb/> relative to their productivity. Some OECD countries have started to tackle this issue by moving away from<lb/> seniority-based wage systems. Examples are Korea where the government has encouraged employers and<lb/> trade unions to adopt a peak-wage system where wages are downward flexible after a certain age in<lb/> exchange for greater job security and Sweden where wage-setting in the public sector has gradually shifted<lb/> from a seniority-based system to one based much more on individual qualification and performance<lb/> (OECD, 2006a). In Slovenia, the Employment Relations Act stipulates that wages must include a<lb/> supplement for the number of years of service, though the size of this seniority bonus can be determined<lb/> freely in collective agreements.<lb/> 24.<lb/> A number of OECD countries have introduced wage subsidies aimed at aligning more closely<lb/> labour costs for older workers and productivity (see OECD, 2006a, <ref type="table">Table 5</ref>.2 for an overview on wage<lb/> subsidy schemes in OECD countries). This is also the approach taken by Slovenia: employers who hire an<lb/> ECO/WKP(2009)60<lb/> unemployed person older than 55 years who has been registered with the Employment Service for over<lb/> 12 months or a registered unemployed person aged over 55 years with an occupation in oversupply are<lb/> exempt from social security contributions. It is welcome that the wage subsidies are not granted solely on<lb/> the basis of age but are more narrowly targeted at specific groups of older workers. As argued by OECD<lb/> (2006a), more narrowly targeted subsidies tend be more effective than subsidies for older workers in<lb/> general, as the latter may involve a substantial deadweight loss (as a large proportion of subsidised workers<lb/> would have been employed even without the subsidy) and substitution effects (as subsidised jobs lead to<lb/> the loss of jobs for other groups of workers ineligible for the subsidy). Moreover, subsidies granted solely<lb/> on the basis of age may again lead to stigmatisation and reinforce negative attitudes on the side of<lb/> employers.<lb/> 25.<lb/> Whilst reforming wage-setting practices to reflect individual performance and providing<lb/> employment subsidies to lower the cost of employing older workers, a closer match between productivity<lb/> and costs can also be achieved by helping older workers to acquire new skills and update existing ones so<lb/> as to raise their productivity as discussed below.<lb/></p>

			<head>Encouraging participation in lifelong learning<lb/></head>

			<p>26.<lb/> Due to organisational and technological change, as well as the ongoing structural shift from<lb/> manufacturing to services, job requirements are constantly changing. As a result, the skills of workers risk<lb/> becoming obsolete, unless they continuously acquire new skills and upgrade existing ones (<ref type="biblio">Behaghel and<lb/> Greenan, 2005</ref>). Participation in lifelong learning can therefore considerably enhance the employability of<lb/> older workers. 12 In addition, job-related training is associated with a higher wage level (<ref type="biblio">Bassanini et al.,<lb/> 2005</ref>) and thus increased incentives to remain active and defer retirement. Providing workers of all ages<lb/> with good access to vocational training and lifelong learning programmes can therefore help to raise the<lb/> employment rates of the elderly. At the same time, workers are more likely to engage in training activities<lb/> if the pension system encourages them to keep working at older ages as this increases the number of years<lb/> available to recoup the returns on investment in training by both workers and employers. 13 As shown in<lb/> panel A of <ref type="figure">Figure 8</ref>, there is a significant positive correlation across countries between the incidence of<lb/> training for older workers relative to younger ones and the average employment rate of older workers. 14<lb/> 27.<lb/> Participation in lifelong learning activities is relatively high in Slovenia (<ref type="figure">Figure 8</ref>, panel B).<lb/> Nevertheless, some scope for further improvements remains, as demonstrated by several other OECD<lb/> countries such as Switzerland and the Nordic countries which have even higher participation rates. More<lb/> importantly, in Slovenia, the share of the population participating in lifelong learning rapidly decreases<lb/> with age which may to some extent reflect fewer expected years left in the workforce and hence fewer<lb/> years to regain the returns on investment in training. While this phenomenon is common across countries,<lb/> the decline is faster in Slovenia than in other OECD countries (<ref type="figure">Figure 9</ref>, panel A). The suggested further<lb/> increase in the pensionable age as well as the removal of incentives for early retirement should make<lb/> participation in training activities more attractive, especially at higher ages.<lb/></p>

			<figure>12.<lb/> Cross country evidence for the positive employment effects of adult learning is provided by OECD (2004).<lb/></figure>

			<p>13.<lb/> This is supported by <ref type="biblio">Bassanini et al. (2005)</ref> reporting a negative correlation between the rate of training for<lb/> older workers (relative to younger ones) and the effective tax on continued work (which is likely to be<lb/> exogenous to training behaviour).<lb/> 14.<lb/> As discussed, the causality can run in both directions with higher participation in training raising the<lb/> employment rates of the elderly and higher employment rates encouraging higher participation in training.<lb/></p>

Several initiatives have been taken in the<lb/> past to promote lifelong learning in Slovenia. In 2006, the National Professional Qualifications Act was<lb/> amended, introducing a system of recognition of non-formal and informal training. Under the Act,<lb/> individuals can obtain a certificate demonstrating that they have the professional or vocational<lb/> competencies necessary to exercise a profession based on either direct demonstration of knowledge, skills<lb/> and competencies, or based on documents and other proof collected by the applicant. In 2007, the<lb/> Resolution on the National Programme of Higher Education of the Republic of Slovenia 2007-10 was<lb/> ECO/WKP(2009)60<lb/> adopted, which envisages an increase in the share of population participating in lifelong learning activities<lb/> and the development of programmes for employees, unemployed and inactive persons who wish to return<lb/> to tertiary education. Measures in the area of lifelong learning are also envisaged in the Social Agreement<lb/> for the period 2007-09 and the Operational Programme for Human Resources Development for the period<lb/> 2007-13. The implementation of the Lifelong Learning Strategy adopted in 2007</table>

			<p>is still hindered by the<lb/> failure to develop an associated operational programme.<lb/> 29.<lb/> To further encourage the population to participate in lifelong learning, the inter-ministerial<lb/> working group which was set up to discuss the implementation of the Lifelong Learning Strategy should<lb/> quickly develop a plan to put the strategy into action. Given the wide range of adult education programmes<lb/> currently available, it is also important to evaluate their impact on labour market outcomes. So far, such<lb/> empirical assessments of specific programmes are rare. As stressed for example by Martin and <ref type="biblio">Grubb<lb/> (2001)</ref>, the outcomes of training programmes vary considerably with programme design. In general,<lb/> training that is targeted and has a strong on-the-job element appears to be the most likely to be successful.<lb/> Furthermore, it is vital that the Active Ageing Strategy, which envisages specific measures to encourage the<lb/> participation of older persons in lifelong learning activities, be swiftly set up and implemented.<lb/> 30.<lb/> The immediate impact on employment rates of any initiatives to encourage participation in<lb/> training activities might be limited though. In the 2006 Labour Force Survey only 5% of employed persons<lb/> stated that they would work longer if they could update their skills (<ref type="figure">Figure 8</ref>, panel B), indicating that the<lb/> lack of lifelong learning possibilities is not the main reason for withdrawing from the workforce.<lb/> Nonetheless such initiatives are an important complement to the further increase in the pensionable age and<lb/> the reduction of early retirement incentives. Both are likely to raise the interest of workers in lifelong<lb/> learning programmes to acquire the skills needed to find employment.<lb/></p>

			<figure>Raising the employment rates of youth<lb/> 31.<lb/> The employment situation of youth has improved markedly in recent years with labour force<lb/> participation of those aged 15 to 29 rising from 52% in 2003 to 61% in mid-2008 and unemployment<lb/> falling from 12.3% to 7.4%. Although the progress clearly reflects the favourable economic conditions<lb/> over that period, the introduction of more flexible forms of employment as well as active labour market<lb/> policies aimed at facilitating the school-to-work transition also contributed to this development. These<lb/> active labour market policies include, for example, employment incentives for the young provided in the<lb/> form of subsidies and tax reliefs for employers, and training and education programmes such as the<lb/> Programme 10000 – Formal Education and Project Learning for Young Adults (see Box 3).<lb/> Box 3. Project Learning for Young Adults<lb/></figure>

			<p>Project Learning for Young Adults (PLYA) is a non-formal education programme for unemployed young adults<lb/> aged 15 to 25 who have failed at school, have no basic vocational education and face social exclusion. The basic<lb/> aim of the programme is to motivate participants to continue their formal education and acquire the knowledge and<lb/> skills needed on the job-market. Participants are meant to gain positive learning experiences and to more clearly<lb/> define their aspirations concerning their career and their general life. The programme has a high success rate<lb/> with 60% to 70% of the participants enrolling in a suitable educational program and/or finding employment. In 2007,<lb/> the programme won the European Regional Champions Award in the area of social policy.<lb/></p>

			<p>Participants can join PLYA any time during the school year. Participation is strictly voluntary and participants<lb/> are entitled to stay in the programme for one year. The education focuses on three main areas. First, participants<lb/> gain basic knowledge in a variety of fields such as mathematics, writing, communication, and natural sciences and<lb/> they acquire the skills required for independent learning. Second, participants are prepared for the working life by<lb/> designing a career plan, establishing links with potential employers and learning the basic components of labour<lb/> legislation. Third, participants acquire socio-cultural skills such as taking responsibility for one&apos;s actions, dealing with<lb/> less favourable incentives from the social environment, and using leisure time more effectively and constructively.<lb/></p>

			<head>ECO/WKP(2009)60<lb/></head>

			<p>Project learning is carried out in four types of project work. Individual learning projects are part of the career<lb/> and individual learning plan of the student. They are derived from his/her defined personal goals such as the passing<lb/> of certain exams. In optional group project work each member of the group realises his/her own learning objectives<lb/> within the context of the common group project (e.g. a theatre play). The student is expected to work on the common<lb/> goals of the group and the group supports the efforts of the individual student. Productive project work is concerned<lb/> with the development of possibilities for the revival of old and disappearing crafts and the use of environment-<lb/>friendly technologies. Extra-curricular activities are used as a tool for raising a student&apos;s motivation and for enlarging<lb/> interests within new fields in which he/she has no experience. The activities can be directly connected with a certain<lb/> project or can be organised independently, just for fun or to satisfy the participant&apos;s own interest.<lb/> While participating in the programme students are guided by mentors. The mentor&apos;s sensibility for the interests<lb/> and abilities of the participant is thus an important element of the programme&apos;s success. Participants actively<lb/> participate in the implementation of the programme by choosing the theme of the project, the methods and<lb/> procedures, which helps to increase their motivation. Every student sets up an individual learning plan that has to be<lb/> realised during the programme. This plan is the foundation for the selection of activities in the programme and is<lb/> also used to evaluate the student&apos;s progress according to the goals set at the beginning.<lb/></p>

			<head>32.<lb/></head>

			<p>The recent progress notwithstanding, several problems remain that need to be addressed. First,<lb/> youth labour force participation is still below the OECD average (<ref type="figure">Figure 10</ref>, panel A), reflecting a<lb/> relatively long duration of initial education. Consistent with this, much of the increase in participation seen<lb/> in the age group 20 to 29 is due to a rising number of student workers who are not in regular employment.<lb/> Second, unemployment is still more prevalent among youth than among other age groups. Particularly<lb/> youth without upper secondary education face considerable difficulties in finding employment (<ref type="figure">Figure 10</ref>,<lb/> panel B). One possible reason is the high minimum wage which might hurt the young disproportionately as<lb/> they tend to be less productive than other workers due to the lack of experience.<lb/></p>

			<head>Achieving the right balance between work and studies<lb/></head>

			<figure>33.<lb/> The demand for tertiary education has expanded rapidly in the last decade with a rising number<lb/> of school leavers wishing to continue education before entering the labour market. In 2006, one-third of<lb/> 20-29 year-olds was enrolled in education compared with one-fourth in the average OECD country<lb/> (OECD, 2008). As longer periods in full time education should filter through to workforce skills and<lb/> ECO/WKP(2009)60<lb/></figure>

			<p>growth potential, the increase in the number of tertiary students is a positive feature provided the right<lb/> skills are acquired at the right pace. However, the average duration of tertiary studies is rather long in<lb/> Slovenia. In the academic year 2006-07, students in higher professional programmes finished their studies<lb/> on average in 5.4 years and students in university programmes needed 6.9 years.<lb/> 34.<lb/> One reason for the relatively long duration of tertiary studies is that the higher education sector<lb/> and particularly the universities have traditionally focused on providing long and strongly academic<lb/> courses. Since the launch of the higher education reform in 2004, the situation is changing as the system is<lb/> transformed into a three-cycle system consistent with the Bologna Declaration (<ref type="figure">Figure 11</ref>). Slovenia opted<lb/> for a gradual implementation of the Bologna reform by the academic year 2009-10 when only post-reform<lb/> programmes will be offered. Until then higher education institutions offer both pre and post-reform<lb/> programmes. As only a very small number of students have so far graduated from the new system, the<lb/> impact of the reform on the length of studies cannot yet be determined.<lb/> 35.<lb/> A second major reason for the long study times is the Slovenian system of study support which<lb/> does not provide enough incentives for rapid graduation (Box 4). The level of benefits granted to students<lb/> enrolled in higher education – such as subsidies for accommodation, transport and meals – appears<lb/> relatively generous. Moreover, about a third of all students receive direct financial support in the form of<lb/> scholarships. As a share of total public expenditure on education, Slovenia spends much more on financial<lb/> aid to students than the average OECD country (<ref type="figure">Figure 12</ref>). Student loans do not currently exist in<lb/> Slovenia (with the exception of loans for studies abroad) as the loans introduced in 1999 were abolished<lb/> again in 2002/03 (Box 4). Higher education is in principle free for full-time students of first and second-<lb/>cycle programmes, though a ministerial decree requires part-time students to pay tuition fees. Institutions<lb/> have the autonomy to determine the level of tuition fees for part-time programmes themselves; in the<lb/> academic year 2008/09 the fees ranged from around EUR 1 800 to EUR 4 000 per annum.<lb/></p>

			<p>Students enrolled in higher education benefit from subsidised accommodation, subsidised meals (coupon<lb/> system), discounts on public transportation, discounts on cultural events (such as theatre tickets) and on subscriptions<lb/> to sports clubs. The only direct financial support is provided in the form of scholarships. First, state scholarships<lb/> targeted at students from low income families are provided to full-time students who enrol in higher education before<lb/> the age of 27 and whose gross income per family member in the previous year did not exceed 130% of the guaranteed<lb/> wage. Second, academically talented students may be eligible for merit-based scholarships, so-called Zois<lb/> scholarships (named after a well-known Slovenian scholar). In addition to publicly provided scholarships, there are also<lb/> company scholarships offered by public and private organisations in relation to their (future) staff requirements. In<lb/> 2007, 18% of all full-time students were granted a state scholarship (of around EUR 180 per month, on average), 11%<lb/> were granted a Zois scholarship (of around EUR 210 per month, on average) and 6% received a company scholarship<lb/> (of around EUR 240 per month, on average).<lb/></p>

			<p>In 1999 a student loan system was first introduced. Loans were offered on the basis of a contract between the<lb/> student, the Employment Service of Slovenia and a bank holding a concession (an interest subsidy) awarded by the<lb/> Ministry of Labour, Family and Social Affairs. Slovenian nationals who were under the age of 27 at the first enrolment,<lb/> who were not employed and who did not receive any type of scholarship were eligible for the loan. As the number of<lb/> applicants was very low, the scheme was abolished in 2002/03. The basic amount of a student loan was about<lb/> EUR 1 050 per annum in 2001, but it could be increased to a maximum amount of EUR 1 580 per annum in special<lb/> cases.<lb/></p>

			<p>36.<lb/> Improving the quality of higher education institutions would also contribute to shortening the<lb/> duration of studies (IMAD, 2008b). The ratio of students to teaching staff, a frequently used indicator for<lb/> the quality of tertiary education, has barely improved in past years and still falls short of the comparable<lb/> ratios of most OECD countries (<ref type="figure">Figure 13</ref>, panel A), the main reason being the relatively low annual<lb/> expenditure per student (<ref type="biblio">Čelebič, 2008</ref>). In 2005, Slovenia spent USD 8 500 per full-time student (in<lb/> purchasing power parities) compared with an OECD average of USD 11 500 (<ref type="figure">Figure 13</ref>, panel B).<lb/> Improving the quality of the teaching process may reduce the number of students who have to repeat<lb/> courses and prevent them from unduly prolonging their studies.<lb/></p>

			<p>37.<lb/> Eligibility for student benefits, including cheap housing, should be made contingent on an annual<lb/> minimum study progress. Similarly, tuition fees in tertiary education that at least partially reflect the cost<lb/> of education should be introduced. This would raise the incentives for students to progress rapidly with<lb/> their studies and also improve market signals between students, providers and the labour market. In<lb/> addition, it would improve the funding of higher education institutions, thus contributing to a higher<lb/> quality of the teaching process. To avoid deterring students, especially those from low-income families, the<lb/> tuition fee system could be accompanied by publicly guaranteed student loans with repayments conditional<lb/> on earnings after graduation.<lb/></p>

			<head>Preventing damage from the minimum wage<lb/></head>

			<p>38.<lb/> The employment opportunities of youth, particularly the less skilled, might also be adversely<lb/> affected by the relatively high minimum wage. Theoretically, a statutory minimum wage set at too high a<lb/> level could become a barrier to employment for low-productivity workers by driving a wedge between<lb/> productivity and labour costs. However, it has proven difficult to pin down the negative employment<lb/> effects empirically (OECD, 2006b). Regarding the impact on the employment opportunities of young<lb/> workers the empirical evidence is mixed with some studies having identified negative effects of minimum<lb/> wages on youth employment, especially if combined with high non-wage labour costs (e.g. <ref type="biblio">Abowd et al.,<lb/> 1997; Bassanini and Duval, 2006</ref>), while others have failed to do so (e.g. <ref type="biblio">Stewart, 2002</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<figure>39.<lb/> Slovenia has had a statutory minimum wage (which covers all sectors of the economy) since<lb/> 1995, when the tripartite social agreement determined a cash figure for the lowest permissible monthly<lb/> wage. Whilst the tripartite agreement concluded in 1997 raised the minimum wage by roughly the same<lb/> amount as pay in general, the agreement for the period 1999-2001 stipulated an extra increase with the aim<lb/> of gradually bringing the minimum wage up to 58% of the average wage in the manufacturing sector. 15<lb/> During 1999-2004, the minimum wage was also adjusted in line with forecast consumer price inflation and<lb/> 15.<lb/> The law implementing the provisions of the social agreement for 1999-2001 introduced, for the first time, a<lb/> national minimum wage in the proper sense as the validity of the part of the law that regulates the<lb/> minimum wage was not limited, as previously, by the duration of the social agreement.<lb/> ECO/WKP(2009)60<lb/> by the real GDP growth rate of the previous year. As a result it increased to around 46.5% of the average<lb/> wage in the private sector (54% of the average wage in the manufacturing sector) by 2004 (Figure 14,<lb/> panel A). Since 2006, the increase in the minimum wage has been decided by the government after<lb/> consulting the social partners, based on forecast consumer price inflation. Since inflation came out higher<lb/> than forecast in 2008 the legislation was amended to provide for an additional increase in the minimum<lb/> wage of about 5¼ per cent in March 2008. When setting annual increases in the minimum wage, mistakes<lb/> in forecasting inflation should not only be corrected when underestimated but also when overestimated.<lb/></figure>

			<p>40.<lb/> Although the minimum wage has declined relative to the average wage in recent years, it is still<lb/> fairly high by OECD standards (<ref type="figure">Figure 14</ref>, panel B) and may present a barrier to employment for young<lb/> people, especially for the less-skilled. The ratio of the minimum wage to the average wage should not<lb/> increase and preferably be further reduced in order to improve the employment prospects of the low-skilled<lb/> young workers. The argument for reducing the relative level of the minimum wage is reinforced by target<lb/> efficiency considerations (OECD, 2006b). Although the minimum wage is meant to improve the income of<lb/> low-income families, a substantial proportion of workers in minimum-wage jobs are likely not to be poor,<lb/> for example because other family members have earnings. And for those who risk sliding into poverty due<lb/> to a relative decline in the level of minimum wages, other instruments such as in-work benefits are<lb/> available that can be better targeted on low-income families. Several OECD countries have lower<lb/> minimum wages for youth, for example Belgium, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom (see OECD,<lb/> 2009, <ref type="table">Table 3</ref> for details). 16 However, the empirical evidence on the employment effects of such sub-<lb/>minima is mixed. While some studies indicate that the negative employment effects of minimum wages are<lb/> smaller when sub-minimum wages exist (e.g. <ref type="biblio">Neumark and Wascher, 1999; Hyslop and Stillman, 2007</ref>),<lb/> others fail to detect any robust effect (e.g. <ref type="biblio">Böckerman and Uusitalo, 2007</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<p>42.<lb/> Despite these legislative changes, employment protection is still relatively high in Slovenia<lb/> (<ref type="figure">Figure 15</ref>). The most serious problem is that EPL tends to be much stricter for regular than for temporary<lb/> work as past reforms eased the use of temporary forms of employment while not going far enough in terms<lb/> of increased flexibility for those under permanent contracts. The administrative procedures for individual<lb/> notice and dismissal are cumbersome and the conditions under which dismissals are legitimate are stricter<lb/> than in many other OECD countries. Moreover, severance payments are still relatively high (Box 1). The<lb/> policy of liberalising temporary employment without a similar adjustment of permanent employment risks<lb/> creating a dual labour market where some jobs are more protected than others. 17 In particular groups with<lb/> weak attachment to the labour market tend to suffer from a partial relaxation of EPL.<lb/> 43.<lb/> The share of workers with fixed-term contracts has indeed increased significantly since the<lb/> liberalisation of temporary employment, from 11% in the late 1990s to over 18% in 2007 (<ref type="figure">Figure 16</ref>,<lb/> panel A). A large share of this temporary employment is involuntary with more than half of all workers<lb/> employed on a temporary basis citing the inability to find a permanent job as the main reason for having a<lb/> temporary one in the 2007 Labour Force Survey. Temporary employment is particularly prevalent among<lb/> young workers; in 2007, more than two-thirds of those aged 15 to 24 had a fixed-term contract which is the<lb/> highest share among European Union countries (<ref type="figure">Figure 16</ref>, panel B). In fact, between 2003 and 2007 the<lb/> 17.<lb/> Temporary contracts tend to be more common in countries with strict EPL on regular contracts even<lb/> though these countries often also have relatively strict rules on temporary contracts.<lb/> ECO/WKP(2009)60<lb/> number of temporary jobs increased by more than the total number of jobs for the young, implying that the<lb/> number of regular jobs actually declined during the economic upswing. A large proportion of the<lb/> temporary employment by youth might be accounted for by student work (see above). The duration of<lb/> fixed-term contracts is generally very short; more than 80% of all temporary workers aged 15 to 24 have a<lb/> contract for less than one year (compared with 44% in the EU15).<lb/></p>

			<p>44.<lb/> The large share of youth on fixed-term contracts observed in Slovenia is consistent with existing<lb/> cross-country evidence showing that a larger difference in employment protection between regular and<lb/> temporary contracts goes along with a higher prevalence of temporary work among youth (<ref type="biblio">OECD, 2004</ref>).<lb/> As the young are more likely to be subject to entry problems into the labour market than other groups of<lb/> the workforce they are more likely to be disproportionately affected by the effects of EPL on firms&apos; hiring<lb/> decisions. Although a temporary job might be the first step towards a more permanent and stable job, this<lb/> is not always the case and workers might get trapped in the situation of moving between temporary work<lb/> and unemployment.<lb/> 45.<lb/> The benefits of enhancing overall firm flexibility notwithstanding, temporary work may<lb/> adversely affect career progression and productivity if workers get trapped in temporary forms of<lb/> employment that are typically characterised by weak job attachments and limited opportunities to upgrade<lb/> human capital (OECD, 2004). The problem of labour market dualism needs to be addressed swiftly, not<lb/> only for reasons of social equality, but also because of economic efficiency. Clawing back past<lb/> achievements in relaxing EPL for temporary work contracts would, however, be the wrong choice. Instead,<lb/> once the current economic crisis dissipates, the authorities should continue to ease EPL for regular job<lb/> contracts. In particular, the administrative burden on individual notice and dismissal should be reduced and<lb/> the conditions under which individual dismissals are legitimate should be relaxed. Moreover, severance<lb/> pay provisions should be reformed. One option would be to follow the Austrian example and transform the<lb/> traditional severance pay system into individual severance accounts (Box 5).<lb/></p>

The Austrian severance pay reform*<lb/></figure>

			<p>Until 2002 severance pay had to be paid to private-sector employees upon termination of the employment<lb/> contract (by the employer or in mutual agreement) provided the employee had worked for the employer for at least<lb/> three years. The payment amounted to two monthly wages after three years of company membership and increased<lb/> with the duration of the job up to a maximum value of one yearly income after 25 years. This system was criticised for<lb/> excluding workers on short-term contracts (e.g. seasonal workers) from the right to severance pay and for inhibiting<lb/> labour mobility as employees lost their entitlement to severance pay in the case of self-termination. Furthermore, it was<lb/> pointed out that SMEs might have liquidity problems if they were to make several severance payments simultaneously.<lb/></p>

			<p>In 2003, the traditional severance pay system was replaced by a system of individual saving accounts. The<lb/> account of each worker is funded by the employer via an untaxed payment of 1.5377% of the gross wage and is<lb/> managed by an employee provision fund that invests the balance on capital markets. The payments start in the second<lb/> month of the employment relationship. If the employee is dismissed after three years of job tenure, he can choose<lb/> between a cash payment, further investment in the same employee provision fund or in the employee provision fund of<lb/> the new employer, and transferring the respective amount as a one-time payment to a pension insurance fund. The<lb/> entitlements to severance pay can thus be cumulated by an employee over his or her entire working career, serving as<lb/> a form of retirement saving. Upon retirement the employee can either claim a cash payment or convert entitlements<lb/> into an annuity. If the employee leaves the company voluntarily or if he is dismissed during the first three years of the<lb/> job contract no cash payment can be claimed, though the claim is not lost as it can be transferred to the new job.<lb/></p>

			<p>The reform extended the entitlement to severance pay considerably as entitlement starts after one month and<lb/> neither depends on the job tenure nor on the way the employment relationship is terminated. The level of the payment<lb/> now depends on the performance of the employee provision fund on the capital market, though the nominal<lb/> contribution paid by the employer is guaranteed.</p>

			<figure>From an employer&apos;s perspective, the new scheme avoids the<lb/> one-time costs of dismissal and the uncertainty related to the size of the payment at the time of hiring. However, the<lb/> contributions to the individual accounts add to labour costs.<lb/> __________________<lb/> * This box draws on Hofer, H.

			<p>46.<lb/> Facilitating access of temporary workers to appropriate training could also help to improve their<lb/> chances of finding a permanent job. Research has shown that job training is strongly correlated with<lb/> opportunities for temporary workers to move into permanent jobs (<ref type="biblio">Grubb et al., 2007</ref>). In this regard, the<lb/> recommendations regarding lifelong learning might help to mitigate the dual labour market issue. Finally,<lb/> the problem of student work needs to be addressed. The preferential treatment of student work may induce<lb/> firms to hire students instead of regular workers and thus intensify labour market duality. The<lb/> reimbursement of social security contributions to employers who hire unemployed persons younger<lb/> than 26, first-time job-seekers whose occupation is in excess supply, or people under 28 who have been<lb/> unemployed for 24 months (introduced in 2006) is likely to mitigate the negative effects somewhat.<lb/> However, subsidising regular work by young graduates in order to prevent it from being crowded out by<lb/> subsidised student work is very costly. Instead, the authorities should consider phasing out the preferential<lb/> treatment of student work as recommended above.<lb/></p>

			<figure>Box 6. Main recommendations to improve the functioning of the labour market<lb/> Mitigating the effect of the economic crisis without jeopardising the long-run functioning of the labour market<lb/> • Ensure that the subsidy scheme for shorter working hours is phased out once the crisis dissipates. In the<lb/> meantime, make eligibility temporary in nature.<lb/> • Avoid any measures that are detrimental to the long-term functioning of the labour market, such as<lb/> tightening the rules for immigrant workers.<lb/> Boosting the labour force participation of the elderly<lb/> • The increase in pensionable ages for women foreseen in the 1999 Pension and Disability Insurance Act<lb/> should be accelerated.<lb/></figure>

			<p>• The pensionable age should be further increased for both genders, possibly taking into account advice from<lb/> an expert commission when deciding about the size of the necessary increase. Once the increase has been<lb/> phased in, and life expectancy at the full pensionable age has reached a suitable level, additional increases<lb/> in the pensionable age should be linked to gains in life expectancy and the length of the pension qualifying<lb/> period should be raised accordingly. The retirement conditions for women should be aligned with those for<lb/> men.<lb/> • Ensure that the penalties/bonuses for early/late retirement are actuarially neutral. Abolish the upper limit on<lb/> the number of additional working years beyond the statutory retirement age during which bonuses are paid<lb/> (currently set at three years).<lb/> • Phase out remaining possibilities to retire prior to the pensionable age. Limit the use of informal pathways to<lb/> early retirement by reviewing the disability and long-term sickness insurance schemes to ensure that<lb/> eligibility conditions are sufficiently tight and adequately monitored, and by reducing the unemployment<lb/> benefit duration for long-term unemployed older workers towards the general length of 12 months once the<lb/> current economic crisis dissipates.<lb/></p>

			<head>•</head>

			<figure>Further strengthen the link between pension benefits and working careers by basing benefits on full lifetime<lb/> average earnings.<lb/> • Allow people to receive wage and pension income at the same time. At the very least, relax the rules for<lb/> partial retirement and phase out the tax disincentives.<lb/> • Ensure that the inter-ministerial working group which was set up to discuss the implementation of the<lb/> Lifelong Learning Strategy quickly develops a plan to put the strategy into action. Evaluate the impact of<lb/> adult education programmes on labour market outcomes. Swiftly set up and implement the Active Ageing<lb/> Strategy.<lb/> ECO/WKP(2009)60<lb/> Rising the employment rates of youth<lb/> • Make eligibility for student benefits, including cheap housing, contingent on an annual minimum study<lb/> progress.<lb/></figure>

			<p>• Introduce tuition fees in tertiary education. To avoid deterring students, especially those from low-income<lb/> families, consider complementing the tuition fee system by publicly guaranteed student loans with<lb/> repayments conditional on earnings after graduation.<lb/></p>

			<head>•</head>

			<figure>Consider phasing out the preferential treatment of student work or at the very least impose an upper age<lb/> limit.<lb/> • When setting annual increases in the minimum wage, correct mistakes in forecasting inflation not only when<lb/> underestimated but also when overestimated.

			<head>Coping with rising labour market dualism<lb/></head>

			<p>• Once the current economic crisis dissipates, continue to ease employment protection legislation for regular<lb/> job contracts. In particular, reduce the administrative burden on individual notice and dismissal, relax the<lb/> conditions under which individual dismissals are legitimate and reform severance pay provisions.<lb/> NAIRU not only on the basis of information on inflationary pressures, but also based on the unemployment<lb/> rate dynamics themselves.

First, the values and variances of the two state variables (the NAIRU and the unemployment<lb/> gap) in the initial period have to be pre-specified.

			<p>The variance of the error term in the transition equation of the NAIRU relative to the one of the error term<lb/> in the Phillips-curve equation (the signal-to-noise-ratio) determines the smoothness of the NAIRU series<lb/> with a smaller ratio resulting in a less volatile NAIRU. While in principle the Kalman filter allows<lb/> estimating the three variances together with the other parameters of the model, this often leads to NAIRU<lb/> series that are too smooth (<ref type="biblio">Richardson et al., 2000</ref>). As a consequence, the variances are typically fixed in<lb/> empirical applications. Following the suggestion by <ref type="biblio">Gordon (1997)</ref>, the signal-to-noise ratio is chosen such<lb/> that it allows the NAIRU to move around freely but rules out sharp quarter-to-quarter gyrations.<lb/> 5.<lb/> The model is estimated over the period 1997Q2 to 2008Q3, the longest period for which all data<lb/> are available. The unemployment gap is found to have a significant influence on consumer price inflation<lb/> suggesting that the derived NAIRU can be interpreted as the unemployment rate consistent with stable<lb/> inflation (<ref type="table">Table A1</ref>.1). The sacrifice ratio implied by the estimated coefficients is equal to 0.59 which is<lb/> consistent with the values obtained by <ref type="biblio">Gianella et al. (2008)</ref> for other OECD countries. The estimates<lb/> suggest that the NAIRU declined throughout the sample period, reaching around 5½ per cent in the third<lb/> quarter of 2008 (<ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>). The sharp drop in unemployment in recent years appears to have been to a large<lb/> extent a cyclical phenomenon as the unemployment rate fell considerably below the NAIRU.<lb/></p>
